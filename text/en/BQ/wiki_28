In 2020, the number of congregations in the United States was 1,463.

&quot;Wesleyan Life&quot; is the official publication. Global Partners is the official non-profit missions organization. The Wesleyan Church world headquarters are in Fishers, Indiana, United States.

== History ==

The Wesleyan Methodist Connection was officially formed in 1843 at an organizing conference in Utica, New York, by a group of ministers and laymen splitting from the Methodist Episcopal Church. The split was primarily over their objections to slavery, though they had secondary issues as well, such as ecclesiastical polity. Orange Scott presided as the meeting formed a federation of churches at first calling themselves the Wesleyan Methodist Connection, a name chosen to emphasize the primacy of the local church, and the intended nature of the denomination as a connection of churches. Other leaders at the organizing conference were La Roy Sunderland, who had been tried and defrocked for his antislavery writings, Lucious C. Matlack, and Luther Lee, a minister who later operated an Underground Railroad station in Syracuse, New York.

The denomination sponsored traveling preachers on the frontier and into Canada, where they appealed to workingmen and farmers. Typical was Rev. James Caughey, an American sent to Ontario by the Wesleyan Methodist Church from the 1840s through 1864. He brought in converts by the score, most notably in the revivals in Canada West 1851–53. His technique combined restrained emotionalism with a clear call for personal commitment, coupled with follow-up action to organize support from converts. It was a time when the Holiness Movement caught fire, with the revitalized interest of men and women in Christian perfection. Caughey successfully bridged the gap between the style of earlier camp meetings and the needs of more sophisticated Methodist congregations in the emerging cities.

In addition to advocating for abolitionism, the early Wesleyan Methodists championed the rights of women. In 1848, the Wesleyan Chapel in Seneca Falls, New York, hosted the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women&#x27;s rights convention. It is commemorated by the Women&#x27;s Rights National Historical Park in the village today. Luther Lee, General President in 1856, preached at the ordination service of Antoinette Brown (Blackwell), the very first woman ordained to the Christian ministry in the United States. The Alliance of Reformed Baptists of Canada ordained the very first woman to the ministry in Canada in the late 1800s. At General Conference in 1867, a resolution was adopted favoring the right of women to vote (as well as the right of freedmen—blacks). This was 44 years before the US constitution was amended to ensure women voting privileges.

In 1966 the Wesleyan Methodist Church merged with the Alliance of Reformed Baptists of Canada and in 1968 with the Pilgrim Holiness Church. It spread through revivals emphasizing a deepening experience with God called holiness or sanctification. Heart purity was a central theme. During this period of time, many small churches developed through revivals and the emphasis of entire sanctification (taught by John Wesley, but not emphasized by some mainline Methodists). As many as 25 or 30 small denominations were formed and eventually merged with other groups to enlarge the church. The church was strong in missionary and revival emphasis. The merger took place in 1968 at Anderson University, Anderson, Indiana. Some conferences and local churches of the Wesleyan Methodist Church objected to the merger, thus resulting in a schism of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection with the Wesleyan Church, as well as the creation of the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches and Bible Methodist Connection of Tennessee around 1968. The Pilgrim Holiness Church of New York (formed in 1963) and Pilgrim Holiness Church of the Midwest (formed in 1967) were also established around this time, with the former in response to the tendency of centralization of the larger Pilgrim Holiness Church and the latter in response to the merger.

==Beliefs==
The Wesleyan Church has the following core values:
* Biblical authority
* Christlikeness
* Disciple-making
* Local church-centered
* Servant leadership
* Unity in diversity

In addition, the Wesleyan Church holds to the following articles of religion:

*Faith in the Holy Trinity — There is one true God, united in three persons: the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

* The Father — the Father created all things, and that all humans are created in the image of God. God, in love, seeks out and receives penitent sinners.

* The Son of God — Jesus Christ is the Son of God, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, fully God and fully man. He died on the cross and was buried as a sacrifice both for original sin and all human transgression and to reconcile us to God. He was raised bodily from the dead, ascended into heaven, and intercedes at the Father&#x27;s right hand, until he returns to judge all humanity.

* The Holy Spirit — The Holy Spirit administers grace to all and is the agent in conviction for sin, in regeneration, in sanctification, and in glorification.

*The sufficiency and full authority of the Holy Scriptures for salvation — The Old and New Testaments are the inspired and infallible Word of God, inerrant in their original manuscripts, superior to any human authority and sufficient for all things necessary to salvation. The Bible has been transmitted to the present without corruption of any essential doctrine.

*God&#x27;s Purpose for Humanity — The divine law is summarized in the commands to love God with all one&#x27;s heart and to love one&#x27;s neighbor as oneself. All persons, therefore, ought to seek to obey God and to preserve and promote for others the exercise of every natural right.

*Marriage and the Family — People are made in the image of God. Marriage is designed by God as a metaphor for His relationship with His covenant people. Therefore, human sexuality ought only to be expressed in heterosexual monogamy. Marriage has the highest priority among social organizations, and was divinely designed for reproduction. Extramarital and same-sex relationships are immoral and sinful.

*Personal Choice — Humans were created with the ability to choose between right and wrong. But, since the fall, humans cannot choose right on their own, because of original sin. Humans are inclined toward sin and cannot, on their own, call on God or exercise faith. But God, through Christ, provides to each person prevenient grace, allowing each to choose salvation.

* Sin: Original, Willful, and Involuntary — All of creation suffers the consequences of Adam and Eve&#x27;s disobedience and groans for redemption. Each person is born with a bent toward sinning, which manifests itself in outward acts of unrighteousness. Failures in judgment and involuntary flaws are not to be equated with willful sin but still require the atonement of Christ for forgiveness. Willful sin is when a free moral agent volitionally chooses to transgress a known law of God. Such sin will result in a loss of fellowship with God, self-absorption, an inability to live righteously, and, ultimately, eternal separation from God. The atonement of Christ is the only remedy for sin, whether original, willful or involuntary.

* The Atonement — Christ&#x27;s crucifixion allows redemption for the whole world. It is the only foundation of salvation from sin. The atonement covers those who mentally cannot choose salvation, but individuals who are mentally accountable must accept the gift of salvation of their own free will.

*Repentance and Faith
**Affirms that salvation is by grace alone but must be accepted by the believer. Denies the Reformed view of unconditional election.
** Affirms that repentance precedes saving faith.
** Affirms that faith is the only condition for salvation. Directly negates any need for good works to attain salvation. Does not negate good works as evidence of salvation.
** Affirms that saving faith publicly acknowledges Christ as Lord.
** Affirms that the saved will identify with the church.

*Justification, Regeneration, and Adoption — Asserts that when one repents and has saving faith in Christ, in that same moment that person is:
**Justified: Granted full pardon for all sin, guilt, and penalty of sins.
**Regenerated: Reborn spiritual life in Christ with a distinct capacity for love and obedience to God.
**Adopted: Given full rights, privileges, and responsibilities of a child of God.

*Good Works — Reaffirms that humankind is justified by faith and affirms that good works are evidence of salvation.

*Sin After Regeneration — Affirms it is possible for a believer to sin after regeneration in salvation and that there is grace and forgiveness for repentant believers.

*Sanctification
** Initial: The work of the Holy Spirit in the moment of conversion in a new believer to be separated from sin to God.
** Progressive: The continual work of the Holy Spirit to grow the believer in love and more perfect obedience.
** Entire&quot; The perfecting of the believer in love and empowerment for service. It follows in lifelong growth in grace and knowledge.

*The Gifts of the Spirit — Asserts that the Holy Spirit gives gifts to people, for the benefit of the Church, but that the Holy Spirit himself is the most desirable gift.

*The Church — The Christian Church is the entire body of believers (both living and those died and in heaven). Jesus Christ is the founder and only head of the Church, which is not identified with any particular institution or denomination. The Church is called to preach the Word of God, administer the sacraments, and live in obedience to Christ. A local church is a body of believers formally organized for the purposes of evangelism, discipleship, and worship. The Wesleyan Church is a denomination within the greater, invisible Church, and that invisible church encompasses Christians who hold to a variety of differing beliefs, not just Wesleyan beliefs.

*The Sacraments
**Baptism — Baptism is a sacrament commanded by our Lord and administered to believers. It works as a symbol and as part of the new covenant of grace.
**The Lord&#x27;s Supper — The Lord&#x27;s Supper is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ&#x27;s death, our hope in his return, and a sign of Christian love for one another.

*The Second Coming of Christ — Asserts that Christ will return, fulfilling numerous biblical prophecies and that this certain event should inspire proper living and evangelization.

*Resurrection of the Dead — Asserts that all will be raised from the dead at Christ&#x27;s return, damnation for the lost and life for the saved, and that the resurrection body will be a spiritual body but still personally recognizable.

*Judgment of All Persons — Asserts a final judgment for all humans before God, regardless of the individual&#x27;s beliefs, and asserts God&#x27;s omniscience and eternal justice.

*Destiny — Asserts that Scripture teaches there is life after death, and the fate of each person is determined by God&#x27;s grace and their individual response, evidenced through moral character rather than arbitrary decree of God. Heaven and Christ&#x27;s presence is the place for those who choose God&#x27;s salvation given through Christ, but hell and separation from Christ is the resulting place for those who neglect the great salvation.

==Organizations and relations==

Local churches are organized into a network of districts with equal representation of clergy and laity at their annual conferences. Each has an elected administrator known as the district superintendent and has a district board of administration with both lay and clergy serving. National and multi-national networks are called general conferences and meet every four years. General conferences exist in the Philippines, the Caribbeans, and North America.

<text>Powder River is a tributary of the Yellowstone River, approximately long in northeastern Wyoming and southeastern Montana in the United States. Combined with its tributary, the South Fork Powder River, it is 550 miles long. It drains an area historically known as the Powder River Country on the high plains east of the Bighorn Mountains.

It rises in three forks in north central Wyoming. The North and Middle forks rise along the eastern slope of the Bighorn Mountains. The South Fork rises on the southern slopes of the Bighorn Mountains west of Casper. The three forks meet on the foothills east of the Bighorns near the town of Kaycee. The combined stream flows northward, east of the Bighorns, and into Montana. It accepts the Little Powder near the town of Broadus, and discharges into the Yellowstone approximately downriver from Miles City, Montana. The Powder River was so named (in the English language as well as in local indigenous languages) because the sand along a portion of its banks resembles powder or dust.

<doc id="492266" wikidata="Q238438" url="?curid=492266" title="Nancy Kress">
<text>Nancy Anne Kress (born January 20, 1948) is an American science fiction writer. She began writing in 1976 but has achieved her greatest notice since the publication of her Hugo- and Nebula-winning novella &quot;Beggars in Spain&quot; (1991), which became a novel in 1993. She also won the Nebula Award for Best Novella in 2013 for &quot;After the Fall, Before the Fall, During the Fall&quot;, and in 2015 for &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Kin&quot;. In addition to her novels, Kress has written numerous short stories and is a regular columnist for &quot;Writer&#x27;s Digest&quot;. She is a regular at Clarion Workshops. During the winter of 2008/09, Nancy Kress was the Picador Guest Professor for Literature at the University of Leipzig&#x27;s Institute for American Studies in Leipzig, Germany.

==Biography==

Born Nancy Anne Koningisor in Buffalo, New York, she grew up in East Aurora and attended college at SUNY Plattsburgh and graduated with an M.A. in English. Before starting her writing career she taught elementary school and then college English. In 1973, she moved to Rochester to marry Michael Joseph Kress. They had two sons, and divorced in 1984. At that time, she went to work at Stanton and Hucko, an advertising agency. She was married to Marcos Donnelly from 1988 to 1994.

In 1998, she married fellow author Charles Sheffield, who died in 2002 of a brain tumor. Kress moved back to Rochester, New York, to be near her grown children. In 2009, she moved to Seattle. In February 2011, she married author Jack Skillingstead.

==Work==

Kress tends to write hard science fiction, or technically realistic stories, often set in a fairly near future. Her fiction often involves genetic engineering and, to a lesser degree, artificial intelligence. There are many invented technologies shared between her stories, including &quot;genemod&quot;, to refer to genetic engineering, and &quot;foamcast&quot;, a lightweight and sturdy building material that appears in many of her novels and short stories.

By conducting extensive research, she keeps her topics within the realm of possibility; however, as Kress clarified for one &quot;Locus&quot; interviewer, with regards to her partner and fellow science fiction writer, &quot;[Sheffield] pronounces it &quot;science&quot; fiction, and I pronounce it science &quot;fiction&quot;.&quot;

Kress also loves ballet, and has written stories around it.

<text>Warrior was a British comics anthology that ran for 26 issues between March 1982 and January 1985. It was edited by Dez Skinn and published by his company Quality Communications. It featured early work by numerous figures who would go on to successful careers in the industry, including Alan Moore, Alan Davis, David Lloyd, Steve Dillon, and Grant Morrison; it also included contributions by the likes of Brian Bolland and John Bolton, while many of the magazine&#x27;s painted covers were by Mick Austin.

==Publication history==
===Creation===
The title &quot;Warrior&quot; was recycled from a short-lived fanzine Skinn had once edited/published; in 1974-1975, he had produced six issues of &quot;Warrior: Heroic Tales Of Swords and Sorcery&quot;. The fanzine featured reprints and new strips, art, and writing from such creators as Steve Parkhouse, Dave Gibbons (who designed the logo), Michael Moorcock, Frank Bellamy, Don Lawrence, and Barry Windsor-Smith.

Following the success of &quot;House of Hammer&quot; and &quot;Starburst&quot;, Skinn was head-hunted by Stan Lee of Marvel Comics to take over the company&#x27;s ailing British division. There, his work included creating the well-received anthology &quot;Hulk Comic&quot;, which mixed reprints of extant American material and work sourced from the burgeoning British comics scene, much of it drawn from Skinn&#x27;s contacts in both the industry and fanzines. In 1980, Skinn left Marvel UK – later explaining that he felt the demands on the wing&#x27;s output had reduced it from making &quot;quality material&quot; to &quot;quantity material&quot;. In response he set up Quality Communications, planning to follow the same successful template with a creator-owned ethos. He revived the name of the 70s fanzine for the project: 

The contents of &quot;Warrior&quot; deliberately mimicked the successful elements from his work for other publishers - &quot;Marvelman&quot; was planned to emulate the revival of Captain Britain in the &quot;Hulk Weekly&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Black Knight&quot; strip, &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; traded on similar motifs to &quot;Night Raven&quot;, &quot;Axel Pressbutton&quot; had a similar theme to Abslom Daak from &quot;Doctor Who Monthly&quot; and &quot;Father Shandor&quot; fitted the sword-and-sorcery profile of &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;. Skinn recruited many of the writers and artists he had previously worked with at Marvel, including Steve Moore, Gibbons, Steve Dillon, Steve Parkhouse and David Lloyd, adding established creators like Bolland and Bolton, as well as emerging young talent such as Alan Moore and Garry Leach. Leach would subsequently be assigned as the magazine&#x27;s art director.

Part of the attraction for the creative staff was &quot;Warrior&quot;&#x27;s unusual payment model. While page rates for the initial work were lower than those offered by rivals IPC Magazines, DC Thomson and Marvel UK, the creators of each strip would receive a share in their output&#x27;s ownership and increased royalties for reprints, instead of the normal industry practice of work-for-hire. Skinn hoped to follow the example of the French anthology &quot;Métal hurlant&quot;, with the various strips both syndicated overseas and, as each reached enough material, in collected albums.

===Contents===
The 52-page magazine had colour front and back covers (the latter usually carrying advertising, but occasionally containing a &#x27;clean&#x27; version of the front cover) but was otherwise in black-and-white; initially it was priced at 50p. The first issue was dated March 1982, with Skinn&#x27;s editorial noting work had begun in April 1981, but the creators had been encouraged to work at getting the first issue &quot;right&quot; rather than working towards a deadline. The issue included a two-page article introducing the creators behind the magazine. Both the editorial-cum-contents page and Skinn&#x27;s replies to readers&#x27; letters would adopt a similarly candid approach, giving a generally unvarnished look at the magazine&#x27;s frequent production problems. Letters page &#x27;Dispatches&#x27; would print both positive and negative missives, with the latter often being upbraided by Skinn or other members of the creative team. 

A Summer Special was planned in 1982 to be a separate special edition alongside the regular issues, featuring self-contained stories. However, various production issues saw some of the planned material merged into various regular issues of &quot;Warrior&quot; instead; in 2007, Skinn would attribute this to himself getting excited and overextending. Repurposed material included the cover for #4 – which bore the text &#x27;Summer Special&#x27; instead of a date. As a result, both Big Ben and Raiko from &quot;Demon at the Gates of Dawn&quot; were featured in the illustration but not in the magazine&#x27;s content, causing some confusion to readers. The Summer Special also bequeathed &quot;The Golden Amazon&quot;, the &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; strip &quot;Vertigo&quot; and the two-page &quot;Madman&quot; strip &quot;ChronoCycle Mk.1&quot; to &quot;Warrior&quot; #5. The magazine would fluctuate between monthly and bi-monthly, which Skinn would state was in response to the industry slowing down in the winter.

In late 1983, the magazine had a print run of around 30,000 copies. &quot;Warrior&quot; #15 saw the first of the &#x27;Sweatshop Talk&#x27; articles featuring interviews with creators – beginning with Steve Moore being &#x27;interviewed&#x27; by his pseudonym Pedro Henry; the pair being one and the same was something of an open secret at the time. Later issues saw &#x27;Henry&#x27; interview Skinn, Alan Moore, Leach and Austin.

===&quot;Warrior&quot; universe and Challenger Force===
Skinn wanted the material in &quot;Warrior&quot; to share a fictional universe, with connections between the strips to be gradually developed, with the various heroes eventually forming a Justice League-style super-team tentatively called Challenger Force. Marvelman, Warpsmith/Aza Chorn, Big Ben and a new character called Firedrake were among the mooted members. As part of the plans for the book, Alan Moore and Steve Moore sketched a far-reaching chronology tying together some of the events from &quot;Marvelman&quot;, &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, &quot;Warpsmith&quot; and &quot;Axel Pressbutton&quot;. Due to being potentially irreconcilable due to their relatively close time periods, &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; was designated as taking place in an alternate universe where Marvelman had never returned; Skinn would joke that V was killed by Kid Marvelman early in his life in the &#x27;regular&#x27; universe. Fate, the computer from &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, was posited as an invention of Marvelman Family creator Emil Gargunza. The Marvelman strip &quot;The Yesterday Gambit&quot; was set three years in the universe&#x27;s future, featuring the title character teaming up with &#x27;Warpsmith&#x27; to battle Kid Marvelman, with a call-out for the mysterious Firedrake and &quot;the others&quot;. Otherwise few of these connections reached print before the title was cancelled, and neither the completed V for Vendetta nor the ongoing Miracleman showed any sign of being connected. However Moore did incorporate the Warpsmiths in &quot;Miracleman&quot;, making several references to &quot;The Yesterday Gambit&quot;. A draft of the timeline was printed in George Khoury&#x27;s &quot;Kimota! The Miracleman Companion&quot; in 2001.

A second attempt at more strongly connected series of strips was planned in 1985, with strips &quot;Big Ben&quot;, &quot;The Liberators&quot;, &quot;The Project Files&quot; and &quot;Wardroid&quot; planned to all be connected to a mysterious foundation called The Project. However, only &quot;Big Ben&quot; and &quot;The Liberators&quot; would reach publication before the magazine&#x27;s cancellation.

===Creative and legal problems===
The high level of creator control led to problems; issues began to turn up late when contributors missed deadlines and fill-in artists could not be commissioned, as the originating artists owned the properties. &quot;Laser Eraser and Pressbutton&quot; stalled when Skinn lost contact with Dillon; material intended for &quot;Warrior&quot; #16 was replaced by a reprint of one of Pressbutton&#x27;s appearances from &quot;Sounds&quot;, and then a one-off war strip by Parkhouse and John Ridgway. Tensions were also growing among the creative staff, with those behind the magazine&#x27;s more popular features feeling the division of spoils was unfair as they were carrying the less popular features. This was exacerbated by the general lack of spoils themselves; despite acclaim &quot;Warrior&quot; was losing money, being propped up by the takings of Skinn&#x27;s Quality Comics store. Deadlines were also a problem, as the difficulty in using fill-in artists meant one strip being late could knock a whole issue off schedule. Further problems arose when creative staff began receiving offers from American publishers and had less time to contribute to &quot;Warrior&quot;, slowing or curtailing storylines.

Marvelman became something of a nexus in the problems surrounding the title. Firstly Alan Moore and artist Alan Davis fell out over an unrelated matter, involving their parallel work on Marvel&#x27;s Captain Britain, and refused to allow anyone else to continue the story - vetoing a mooted continuation by Grant Morrison. Secondly, Alan Moore&#x27;s relationship with Skinn deteriorated; a key point of the dispute was a growing suspicion that the editor had not correctly licensed the character in contrary to what he had told the writer. Thirdly, the publishing of a one-off &quot;Marvelman Special&quot; in July 1984 had drawn legal action for trademark infringement from Marvel Comics; while the strip had already stalled this made potential syndication partners wary as Skinn was attempting to find a package deal for entirety of &quot;Warrior&quot;&#x27;s contents. From &quot;Warrior&quot; #25, the magazine briefly expanded when fellow Quality magazine &quot;Halls of Horror&quot; was merged into the title.

Publicly, Skinn railed against Marvel and their legal tactics, even going as far as printing his correspondence with the rival publisher&#x27;s British legal representatives in columns in &quot;Warrior&quot; while implying that the action was preventing the continuation of Marvelman. However, before the matter could go to court or the creative impasse could be resolved &quot;Warrior&quot;&#x27;s losses finally became too much for Skinn. After 26 issues he shuttered the title, and would later estimate that its run had cost him between $36-40,000 in losses. He would later state the loss of Marvelman played no role in the cancellation. As well as the planned &#x27;Project&#x27; stories, other victims of the cancellation included Leach superhero strip &quot;Power&quot;, Steve Moore and Jim Baikie&#x27;s &quot;Claustrophobia&quot; and &quot;Grysdyke Dean&quot;, which was a submission by readers Paul Alexander and Mike Nicholson.

Instead Skinn focused on attempting to sell the reprint rights for the lucrative American market. After some unsuccessful negotiations, Alan Moore and David Lloyd broke ranks to make their own deal with DC Comics, while Skinn and Mike Friedrich of Star*Reach brokered a deal with Pacific Comics for the remainder. Before anything could be published the Pacific folded and its assets were purchased by Eclipse Comics. Eclipse would publish series based on Marvelman (renamed &quot;Miracleman&quot;) and Pressbutton but would go bankrupt themselves in 1994. &quot;Warrior&quot; Marvelman and Warpsmith material has since been reprinted in updated form in Marvel&#x27;s 2014 &quot;Miracleman&quot; series.

==Stories==
===&quot;V for Vendetta&quot;===

Created by Alan Moore and David Lloyd. A masked vigilante battles a fascist British government in an alternate 1997. Episodes of the serial appeared in all but one issue of &quot;Warrior&quot;, only missing #17. Following the demise of &quot;Warrior&quot;, the story was picked up by DC Comics, who eventually published the material and its continuation in a ten-issue 1988 limited series.

===&quot;Marvelman&quot;===

A revival of the Mick Anglo-created Golden Age British superheroes Marvelman, Young Marvelman and Kid Marvelman. The strip was written by Alan Moore and initially drawn by Garry Leach before he handed over to Alan Davis. Marvelman featured in #1-11, #15-16, #18 and #20-21; related flashback strips drawn by John Ridgway appeared in #12 (&quot;Young Marvelman&quot;) and #17 (&quot;Marvelman Family&quot;). The story was later renamed &quot;Miracleman&quot; in 1985 when it was published by Eclipse Comics, and would continue until 1993 when the American company folded. Following a long hiatus while copyright issues were resolved it returned to publication under the auspices of Marvel Comics in 2014.

===&quot;Laser Eraser and Pressbutton&quot;===

Sociopathic cyborg assassin Axel Pressbutton had been created by Steve Moore and Alan Moore (under the pseudonyms Pedro Henry and Curt Vile, respectively) for music magazine &quot;Dark Star&quot; in 1979, and subsequently appeared in the more-widely read &quot;Sounds&quot; from 1980. For the character&#x27;s appearances in &quot;Warrior&quot;, Skinn requested the creation of a female co-star and Axel was joined by the Laser Eraser Mysta Mystralis. The strip appeared in &quot;Warrior&quot; #1-12 and #15-16 with &#x27;Henry&#x27; writing and Steve Dillon drawing most of it; David Jackson and Mick Austin would also provide art for some episodes. However, after a reprint of a &quot;Sounds&quot; strip in #17, Skinn&#x27;s editorial claimed the artist had &quot;disappeared&quot; with the artwork for the title. The story would return in #21 and appear again in #24-25, now drawn by Alan Davis. The &quot;Warrior&quot; strips would be reprinted by Eclipse in the limited series &quot;Axel Pressbutton&quot; in 1984, after which the American publisher would run new material, first in &quot;Laser Eraser and Pressbutton&quot; and then as a backup feature in &quot;Miracleman&quot;.

===&quot;Father Shandor... Demon Stalker&quot;===
The adventures of a medieval Transylvanian monk turned demon hunter. The character had actually debuted in the 1966 Hammer horror film &quot;&quot;, played by Andrew Keir (the film&#x27;s credits referred to the character as &#x27;Sandor&#x27;). The comic version had been created by Steve Moore for &quot;House of Hammer&quot; and was continued in &quot;Warrior&quot;; issues #1–3 reprinted material from &quot;House of Hammer&quot; #8, #16, and #21; the rest were original to &quot;Warrior&quot;. While the initial reprints featured artwork by Bolton the new material was drawn by Jackson. It was one of the most consistent features of the magazine with either Father Shandor or spin-off Jaramsheela (featuring a demonic succubus enemy of the priest) appearing in #1-10, #13-19, #21 and #23-25.

===&quot;The Spiral Path&quot;===
A fantasy sword and sorcery strip by Steve Parkhouse and Bolton, concerning the travails of Caed and his friend&#x27;s daughter Bethbara in the land of Tairngir. It appeared in #1-2 &amp; #4-12 but &quot;Warrior&quot; ended before a second arc could begin. The completed material was later repackaged as a two-issue &#x27;micro-series&#x27; by Eclipse Comics, which was nominated
for &#x27;Best Limited Series&#x27; at the 1986 Kirby Awards. The story teased a possible continuation, with the title given as &quot;The Silver Circle&quot;, but this never materialized.

===&quot;The Legend of Prester John&quot;===
A retelling of the story of the legendary Christian king (and not to be confused with the Marvel Comics character of the same name) by Steve Parkhouse and John Bolton. While the strip appeared in &quot;Warrior&quot; #1 it then disappeared until #11, due to what Skinn&#x27;s editorial called a &quot;catalogue of ill-luck&quot;; the story was now drawn by John Stokes. However, after #12 it would again disappear for good.

===&quot;The Madman&quot;===
Created, written and initially drawn by Paul Neary. The story concerned the mental journey of Martin Schiller, a catatonic mental patient. The strip debuted in &quot;Warrior&quot; #2 and ran in #3-5 &amp; #7. As Neary&#x27;s workload at Marvel UK increased Austin took over art duties from #5. After the planned conclusion failed to arrive for publication in &quot;Warrior&quot; #8 it was simply abandoned - Skinn would later say Neary &quot;went off the radar in the West Country&quot;.
===&quot;Zirk&quot;===
The magazine&#x27;s ersatz mascot, sweaty, amorous blob Zirk was spun off from &quot;Laser Eraser and Pressbutton&quot;. The Sultan of Slime received his own solo strip in &quot;Warrior&quot; #3, written by Steve Moore (under his Pedro Henry pseudonym) and drawn by Brian Bolland. Another appeared in #13, with art from Leach.

===&quot;Warpsmith&quot;=== 

A science fiction story written by Alan Moore and drawn by Garry Leach concerning the Warpsmiths, a highly advanced race of aliens with the ability to teleport instantaneously. They are locked in a cold war with the Qys Imperium. The characters featured strongly in the mooted chronology of the magazine, first posing as allies of Earth before gradually colonising the world. However, after one - later revealed to be Aza Chorn, but initially only named Warpsmith - appeared as a guest character in &quot;The Yesterday Gambit&quot;, only two episodes (in &quot;Warrior&quot; #9-10), of their own story would be published before &quot;Warrior&quot; was cancelled. These would subsequently be reprinted as back-up material in Eclipse&#x27;s &quot;Axel Pressbutton&quot; series before the characters themselves were folded into &quot;Miracleman&quot; from 1987. Another story, &quot;Ghostdance&quot;, was scripted but did not reach publication before &quot;Warrior&quot; folded in 1985. &quot;Cold War, Cold Warrior&quot; was subsequently coloured by Leach and reprinted by Eclipse in the second issue of their &quot;Axel Pressbutton&quot; series.

Marvel Comics reprinted &quot;Miracleman&quot; from 2014 onwards, including the &quot;Warpsmith&quot; strips. the Warpsmiths still feature in the continuing &quot;Miracleman&quot; storyline, now written by Neil Gaiman.

===&quot;The Bojeffries Saga&quot;===

An absurdist black comedy by Alan Moore and Steve Parkhouse about the eccentric, monstrous Bojefferies family from Northampton (Moore&#x27;s home town) and their bizarre antics. Only four episodes ran in &quot;Warrior&quot; (in #12-13 &amp; #19-20). The series was later continued in the anthologies &quot;Dalgoda&quot; and &quot;A1&quot;.

===&quot;The Twilight World&quot;===
Set on a dystopian future Earth, where the little life remaining on the planet is threatened by Castle Core, the planet&#x27;s faulty defence system. Jay Verlane and the alien Fylar set out to destroy it. Written by Steve Moore and drawn by Jim Baikie, the story ran in #14-17. It was later reprinted in colour as back-up material in Eclipse&#x27;s &quot;Laser Eraser and Pressbutton&quot;.

===&quot;Ektryn&quot;===
Science fiction fantasy set on the planet Naglfar, by Steve Moore and Cam Kennedy. The strip bore one of the few explicit shared connections in the magazine - Mysta Mystralis was cloned from cell tissue of the title character, effectively making &quot;Ektryn&quot; a &quot;Laser Eraser and Pressbutton&quot; prequel. The strip appeared in &quot;Warrior&quot; #14 and #25.

===&quot;Bogey&quot;===

Future-set private eye story written by Antonio Segura and drawn by Leopoldo Sánchez, imported from Spain and translated into English for &quot;Warrior&quot; by Skinn, appearing in #22-23 &amp; #26. Not to be confused with Antonio Ghura&#x27;s 1975 British underground comix volume &quot;Bogey&quot;.

===&quot;Big Ben&quot;===

Originally created by Dez Skinn and artist Ian Gibson as a possible addition to &quot;House of Hammer&quot;, the existence of a completed unpublished story with the character led to the editor requesting Big Ben be included in &quot;Marvelman&quot;. This allowed the strip to be printed in the &quot;Marvelman Special&quot; (where Skinn was credited as Edgar Henry). Rich Johnston has speculated that Marvel UK&#x27;s &quot;The Thing is Big Ben&quot;, starring Ben Grimm of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; fame, was intended to prevent Skinn using Big Ben as a title character. Later, new material featuring the character was created for &quot;Warrior&quot; by Skinn (now credited under his real name); Leach was initially announced as artist but instead Will Simpson would draw the strip. This posited that - contrary to the depiction in &quot;Marvelman&quot; and later minor appearances in &quot;Miracleman&quot; - Big Ben was a shape-shifting alien that had taken on the guise of Lord Benjamin Charterhouse Fortescue. As Big Ben, Fortescue fought crime from a headquarters in the Westminster clock tower, which he accessed via a secret lift in the House of Lords, with the assistance of valet Fosdyke and assistant Tanya. These strips appeared in &quot;Warrior&quot; #19-26; another completed before the cancellation was later included in the &quot;Spring Special&quot; edition of &quot;Comics International&quot;, and has been subsequently used in Marvel Comics&#x27; revival of &quot;Miracleman&quot;. 

===&quot;The Liberators&quot;===

A group of rebels fights the alien Metamorphs in the post-apocalyptic London of 2470; the strip was one of the few to feature clear connections to others in the magazine, with concepts related to &quot;Big Ben&quot;. The first story was printed in &quot;Warrior&quot; #22, written by Skinn and drawn by Ridgway. The first of a two-part prequel written by Grant Morrison (some of his earliest professional work) then appeared in #26; due to Warrior&#x27;s cancellation the second instalment wouldn&#x27;t be printed until the 1996 &#x27;Spring Special&#x27;.
===&quot;The Many World of Cyril Tomkins - Chartered Accountant&quot;===
Whimsical comedy story, in which the title character escapes his mundane everyday life by indulging in fantasy. Written by Carlos Trillo with art by Horacio Altuna, the story was another imported from Spain, and appeared in &quot;Warrior&quot; #25-26.

===One-off strips===
*A True Story?: a &quot;Tharg&#x27;s Future Shocks&quot;-style piece from the first issue, written by Steve Moore and drawn by Bolland.
*The Golden Amazon: a partial adaptation of John Russell Fearn&#x27;s pulp science fiction series &quot;Golden Amazon&quot; by Lloyd, printed in #5. The editorial asked readers to write in if they wanted to see it, though in fact Lloyd&#x27;s schedule would prevent any follow-up.
*Stir Crazy: an EC Comics pastiche by underground comix artist Hunt Emerson, printed in &quot;Warrior&quot; #8 after the final episode of &quot;The Madman&quot; failed to appear.
*The Shroud: a short science fiction strip by Parkhouse and Ridgway printed in #13.
*Home is the Sailor: a World War II story from Parkhouse and Ridgway, printed in #17 in lieu of the planned &quot;Laser Eraser and Pressbutton&quot; continuation.
*Demon at the Gates of Dawn: originally created by Parkhouse in 1977, this tale of demon-battling samurai Raiko and Tsannu in feudal Japan was announced as the first in an occasional series; Bryan Talbot was announced as artist but no further instalments appeared before the magazine ended.
*Zee-Zee&#x27;s Terror Zone: an edited reprint of a &quot;House of Hammer&quot; strip by Martin Asbury, intended as the first of an anthology-style series of unconnected strips. A second in #21 saw Leach and John Boix adapt a Enrique Sánchez Abulí story. 
*The Judgement: a previously-unpublished Alan Booth/David Jackson strip created for the 1970s incarnation of &quot;Warrior&quot;, printed in #20.
*The Black Currant: A comic fantasy strip by Carl Critchlow based in the cartoonist&#x27;s &quot;Thrud the Barbarian&quot; universe that featured in &quot;Warrior&quot; #25.

==Reception==
===Awards===
&quot;Warrior&quot; was a critical rather than commercial hit. It obtained considerable success at the Eagle Awards; in 1984 it won &#x27;Favourite Comic (UK)&#x27; and &#x27;Favourite Comic Cover (UK)&#x27; for Mick Austen&#x27;s work on &quot;Warrior&quot; #7, while &quot;Marvelman&quot;, its lead characters and writer Alan Moore were also honoured. The following year it retained the &#x27;Favourite Comic (UK)&#x27; award.

===Influence===
As well as syndication rights, Skinn and Friedrich also arranged for unsold issues of &quot;Warrior&quot; to be shipped and sold in America; in &quot;Warrior&quot; #5&#x27;s &#x27;Dispatches&#x27; Skinn claimed the US market accounted for 25% of the magazine&#x27;s sales. While large-format black-and-white magazines were falling out of fashion and the exported &quot;Warrior&quot; issues only reached speciality stores it drew some influential readers. Skinn would later attribute Alan Moore&#x27;s selection as writer for &quot;Saga of the Swamp Thing&quot; - a key factor in the so-called British Invasion - to Dick Giordano and Len Wein being &quot;Warrior&quot; readers.

Letters page &#x27;Dispatches&#x27; meanwhile would attract letters from established industry figures including then-&quot;2000 AD&quot; editor Steve MacManus
Martin Lock
Bill Black
and Marv Wolfman, as well as future comics figures Kevin O&#x27;Neill, Bambos Georgiou, Warren Ellis, Lew Stringer, Roger Broughton, Rik Levins and Richard Starkings.

===Legacy===
Lew Stringer acclaimed &quot;Warrior&quot;, stating that &quot;Warrior&quot; as a whole showed that British comics didn&#x27;t have to always pander to kids or be restricted to the old ways of storytelling&quot;.
Comicon.com note the magazine was &quot;incredible, it set the mold for so much of what would come later, and it&#x27;s a slightly lost portion of UK comics&quot;.

Musing on &quot;Warrior&quot; in a 2017 interview, Skinn surmised: &quot;So did the experiment work? Not for the publisher, no. At least not financially. But it did provide a brilliant showcase for creators not shackled by tradition&quot;.

===Continuations and revivals===
After Quality Communications took over Fleetway&#x27;s overseas licence from Eagle Comics, Skinn announced a new 48-page colour version of &quot;Warrior&quot; for 1986. However, the title would not be released.

Alan Moore went on to complete both &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; and his planned storyline for &quot;Marvelman&quot; (as &quot;Miracleman&quot;) working for American publishers. Both have received considerable commercial and critical acclaim; &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; was adapted for cinema in 2005 and David Lloyd&#x27;s art inspired the hacktivist group Anonymous, while &quot;Miracleman&quot; has been continued by Neil Gaiman. &quot;Laser Eraser and Pressbutton&quot; and &quot;The Spiral Path&quot; were also exported via Eclipse Comics. 

Several &quot;Warrior&quot; characters were revived for the 1989 anthology &quot;A1&quot;, published by Leach&#x27;s Atomeka Press. This included &quot;Ghostdance&quot;, a previously-unfinished Alan Moore-written &quot;Warpsmith&quot; story. A &quot;Spring Special&quot; flip book &#x27;issue&#x27; of &quot;Warrior&quot; was published in #67 of Skinn&#x27;s &quot;Comics International&quot; in 1996, featuring previously completed but unpublished &quot;Big Ben&quot; and &quot;Liberators&quot; strips. 

In 2018, Skinn produced a limited edition facsimile of &quot;Warrior&quot;&#x27;s original dummy issue.

<doc id="492269" wikidata="Q3885220" url="?curid=492269" title="Order of the Engineer">
<text>The Order of the Engineer is an association for graduate and professional engineers in the United States that emphasizes pride and responsibility in the engineering profession. It was inspired by the success of the Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer, a similar and much older Canadian ceremony, and has 245 active links (what the Order of the Engineer calls a chapter) across the United States.

==Oath==
Before joining, members must take an oath to abide by a code of ethics called the &quot;Obligation of an Engineer&quot;:

==Ceremony==
During the ceremony, engineering graduates take the Obligation of the Order. After each member takes the obligation, they put their hand through a large representation of the Engineer&#x27;s Ring. A member of the Order of the Engineer then places a stainless steel ring, known as the Engineer&#x27;s Ring, onto the little finger of the graduate&#x27;s dominant hand. The ring is worn on the little finger so that it will drag across any surface on which the wearer writes, providing a constant reminder of the engineer&#x27;s oath.

Each inductee takes the obligation, signs a certificate of obligation and wears the ring as a symbol of their pride in the Order and their obligation to the profession, as well as the public. Often, friends and family join the new initiates to celebrate after the ceremony.

==History==
The first American ceremony was held on June 4, 1970 at Cleveland State University&#x27;s Fenn College of Engineering, though similar ceremonies on which this is based have a much longer history in Canada (dating to 1925). Now, almost all states have universities with chapters, called &quot;links&quot;, that host the Order of the Engineer. Several engineering organizations also host links such as NSPE, United States Army Corps of Engineers, and ASCE.

Early attempts to extend the Canadian ritual to the United States were unsuccessful, due to complications including copyright issues.

<doc id="492271" wikidata="Q199906" url="?curid=492271" title="Clinical psychology">
<text>Clinical psychology is an integration of human science, behavioral science, theory, and clinical knowledge for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically-based distress or dysfunction and to promote subjective well-being and personal development. Central to its practice are psychological assessment, clinical formulation, and psychotherapy, although clinical psychologists also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration. In many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession.

The field is generally considered to have begun in 1896 with the opening of the first psychological clinic at the University of Pennsylvania by Lightner Witmer. In the first half of the 20th century, clinical psychology was focused on psychological assessment, with little attention given to treatment. This changed after the 1940s when World War II resulted in the need for a large increase in the number of trained clinicians. Since that time, three main educational models have developed in the US—the PhD Clinical Science model (heavily focused on research), the PhD science-practitioner model (integrating scientific research and practice), and the PsyD practitioner-scholar model (focusing on clinical theory and practice). In the UK and Ireland, the Clinical Psychology Doctorate falls between the latter two of these models, whilst in much of mainland Europe, the training is at the master&#x27;s level and predominantly psychotherapeutic. Clinical psychologists are expert in providing psychotherapy, and generally train within four primary theoretical orientations—psychodynamic, humanistic, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and systems or family therapy.

Clinical psychology is different from psychiatry. Although practitioners in both fields are experts in mental health, clinical psychologists are experts in psychological assessment including neuropsychological and psychometric assessment and treat mental disorders primarily through psychotherapy. Currently, only seven US states, Louisiana, New Mexico, Illinois, Iowa, Idaho, Colorado and Utah (being the most recent state) allow clinical psychologists with advanced specialty training to prescribe psychotropic medications. Psychiatrists are medical doctors who specialize in the treatment of mental disorders via a variety of methods, e.g., diagnostic assessment, psychotherapy, psychoactive medications, and medical procedures such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Additionally, psychiatrists are legally authorized to prescribe psychotropic medications in all states of the U.S. and in all provinces of Canada. However, Psychiatrists are not usually used for psychometric assessment. In education, clinical psychologists attend a graduate institution and have a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) or a Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) degree, usually following both an undergraduate and master&#x27;s degree in Psychology or a related discipline. Conversely, psychiatrists complete their studies at a medical school and hold a medical degree (M.D.), Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (with additional post-graduate training), or an osteopathic degree and the (D.O.) which is only available in the United States.

==History==

The earliest recorded approaches to assess and treat mental distress were a combination of religious, magical, and/or medical perspectives. In the early 19th century, one approach to study mental conditions and behavior was using phrenology, the study of personality by examining the shape of the skull. Other popular treatments at that time included the study of the shape of the face (physiognomy) and Mesmer&#x27;s treatment for mental conditions using magnets (mesmerism). Spiritualism and Phineas Quimby&#x27;s &quot;mental healing&quot; were also popular.

While the scientific community eventually came to reject all of these methods for treating mental illness, academic psychologists also were not concerned with serious forms of mental illness. The study of mental illness was already being done in the developing fields of psychiatry and neurology within the asylum movement. It was not until the end of the 19th century, around the time when Sigmund Freud was first developing his &quot;talking cure&quot; in Vienna, that the first scientific application of clinical psychology began.

===Early clinical psychology===
By the second half of the 1800s, the scientific study of psychology was becoming well established in university laboratories. Although there were a few scattered voices calling for applied psychology, the general field looked down upon this idea and insisted on &quot;pure&quot; science as the only respectable practice. This changed when Lightner Witmer (1867–1956), a past student of Wundt and head of the psychology department at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed to treat a young boy who had trouble with spelling. His successful treatment was soon to lead to Witmer&#x27;s opening of the first psychological clinic at Penn in 1896, dedicated to helping children with learning disabilities. Ten years later in 1907, Witmer was to found the first journal of this new field, &quot;The Psychological Clinic&quot;, where he coined the term &quot;clinical psychology&quot;, defined as &quot;the study of individuals, by observation or experimentation, with the intention of promoting change&quot;. The field was slow to follow Witmer&#x27;s example, but by 1914, there were 26 similar clinics in the US.

Even as clinical psychology was growing, working with issues of serious mental distress remained the domain of psychiatrists and neurologists. However, clinical psychologists continued to make inroads into this area due to their increasing skill at psychological assessment. Psychologists&#x27; reputation as assessment experts became solidified during World War I with the development of two intelligence tests, &quot;Army Alpha&quot; and &quot;Army Beta&quot; (testing verbal and nonverbal skills, respectively), which could be used with large groups of recruits. Due in large part to the success of these tests, assessment was to become the core discipline of clinical psychology for the next quarter-century, when another war would propel the field into treatment.

===Early professional organizations===
The field began to organize under the name &quot;clinical psychology&quot; in 1917 with the founding of the American Association of Clinical Psychology. This only lasted until 1919, after which the American Psychological Association (founded by G. Stanley Hall in 1892) developed a section on Clinical Psychology, which offered certification until 1927. Growth in the field was slow for the next few years when various unconnected psychological organizations came together as the American Association of Applied Psychology in 1930, which would act as the primary forum for psychologists until after World War II when the APA reorganized. In 1945, the APA created what is now called Division 12, the Society for Clinical Psychology, which remains a leading organization in the field. Psychological societies and associations in other English-speaking countries developed similar divisions, including in Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

===World War II and the integration of treatment===

When World War II broke out, the military once again called upon clinical psychologists. As soldiers began to return from combat, psychologists started to notice symptoms of psychological trauma labeled &quot;shell shock&quot; (eventually to be termed post-traumatic stress disorder) that were best treated as soon as possible. Because physicians (including psychiatrists) were over-extended in treating bodily injuries, psychologists were called to help treat this condition. At the same time, female psychologists (who were excluded from the war effort) formed the National Council of Women Psychologists with the purpose of helping communities deal with the stresses of war and giving young mothers advice on child rearing. After the war, the Veterans Administration in the US made an enormous investment to set up programs to train doctoral-level clinical psychologists to help treat the thousands of veterans needing care. As a consequence, the US went from having no formal university programs in clinical psychology in 1946 to over half of all PhDs in psychology in 1950 being awarded in clinical psychology.

WWII helped bring dramatic changes to clinical psychology, not just in America but internationally as well. Graduate education in psychology began adding psychotherapy to the science and research focus based on the 1947 scientist-practitioner model, known today as the &quot;Boulder Model&quot;, for PhD programs in clinical psychology. Clinical psychology in Britain developed much like in the US after WWII, specifically within the context of the National Health Service with qualifications, standards, and salaries managed by the British Psychological Society.

===Development of the Doctor of Psychology degree===
By the 1960s, psychotherapy had become embedded within clinical psychology, but for many, the PhD educational model did not offer the necessary training for those interested in practice rather than research. There was a growing argument that said the field of psychology in the US had developed to a degree warranting explicit training in clinical practice. The concept of a practice-oriented degree was debated in 1965 and narrowly gained approval for a pilot program at the University of Illinois starting in 1968. Several other similar programs were instituted soon after, and in 1973, at the Vail Conference on Professional Training in Psychology, the practitioner–scholar model of clinical psychology—or &quot;Vail Model&quot;—resulting in the Doctor of Psychology (PsyD) degree was recognized. Although training would continue to include research skills and a scientific understanding of psychology, the intent would be to produce highly trained professionals, similar to programs in medicine, dentistry, and law. The first program explicitly based on the PsyD model was instituted at Rutgers University. Today, about half of all American graduate students in clinical psychology are enrolled in PsyD programs.

===A changing profession===
Since the 1970s, clinical psychology has continued growing into a robust profession and academic field of study. Although the exact number of practicing clinical psychologists is unknown, it is estimated that between 1974 and 1990, the number in the US grew from 20,000 to 63,000. Clinical psychologists continue to be experts in assessment and psychotherapy while expanding their focus to address issues of gerontology, sports, and the criminal justice system to name a few. One important field is health psychology, the fastest-growing employment setting for clinical psychologists in the past decade. Other major changes include the impact of managed care on mental health care; an increasing realization of the importance of knowledge relating to multicultural and diverse populations; and emerging privileges to prescribe psychotropic medication.

==Professional practice==

Clinical psychologists engage in a wide range of activities. Some focus solely on research into the assessment, treatment, or cause of mental illness and related conditions. Some teach, whether in a medical school or hospital setting, or in an academic department (e.g., psychology department) at an institution of higher education. The majority of clinical psychologists engage in some form of clinical practice, with professional services including psychological assessment, provision of psychotherapy, development and administration of clinical programs, and forensics (e.g., providing expert testimony in a legal proceeding).

In clinical practice, clinical psychologists may work with individuals, couples, families, or groups in a variety of settings, including private practices, hospitals, mental health organizations, schools, businesses, and non-profit agencies. Clinical psychologists who provide clinical services may also choose to specialize. Some specializations are codified and credentialed by regulatory agencies within the country of practice. In the United States, such specializations are credentialed by the American Board of Professional Psychology (ABPP).

==Training and certification to practice==

Clinical psychologists study a generalist program in psychology plus postgraduate training and/or clinical placement and supervision. The length of training differs across the world, ranging from four years plus post-Bachelors supervised practice to a doctorate of three to six years which combines clinical placement. The practice of clinical psychology requires a license in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and many other countries.

===US and Canada===
In the US, about half of all clinical psychology graduate students are being trained in PhD programs—a model that emphasizes research—with the other half in PsyD programs, which has more focus on practice (similar to professional degrees for medicine and law). Both models are accredited by the American Psychological Association and many other English-speaking psychological societies. A smaller number of schools offer accredited programs in clinical psychology resulting in a master&#x27;s degree, which usually takes two to three years post-Bachelors.

Although each of the US states is somewhat different in terms of requirements and licenses, there are three common elements:
# Graduation from an accredited school with the appropriate degree
# Completion of supervised clinical experience or internship
# Passing a written examination and, in some states, an oral examination

All U.S. state and Canadian province licensing boards are members of the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB), which created and maintains the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP). Many states require other examinations in addition to the EPPP, such as a jurisprudence (i.e. mental health law) examination and/or an oral examination. Most states also require a certain number of continuing education credits per year in order to renew a license, which can be obtained through various means, such as taking audited classes and attending approved workshops. Clinical psychologists require the psychologist license to practice, although other mental health provider licenses can be obtained with a master&#x27;s degree, such as Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT), Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC), and Licensed Psychological Associate (LPA).

===UK===
In the UK, clinical psychologists undertake a Doctor of Clinical Psychology (DClinPsych), which is a practitioner doctorate with both clinical and research components. This is a three-year full-time salaried program sponsored by the National Health Service (NHS) and based in universities and the NHS. Entry into these programs is highly competitive and requires at least a three-year undergraduate degree in psychology plus some form of experience, usually in either the NHS as an assistant psychologist or in academia as a research assistant. It is not unusual for applicants to apply several times before being accepted onto a training course as only about one-fifth of applicants are accepted each year. These clinical psychology doctoral degrees are accredited by the British Psychological Society and the Health Professions Council (HPC). The HPC is the statutory regulator for practitioner psychologists in the UK. Those who successfully complete clinical psychology doctoral degrees are eligible to apply for registration with the HPC as a clinical psychologist.

In the UK, registration as a clinical psychologist with the Health Professions Council (HPC) is necessary. The HPC is the statutory regulator for practitioner psychologists in the UK. In the UK the following titles are restricted by law &quot;registered psychologist&quot; and &quot;practitioner psychologist&quot;; in addition, the specialist title &quot;clinical psychologist&quot; is also restricted by law.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, training is through institutions like University of Management and Technology, University of the Punjab, University of Central Punjab, Fatima Jinnah Women&#x27;s University, National University of Medical Sciences. Some psychological associations are The Pakistan Psychological Association(PPA), Pakistan Association of Clinical Psychologists(PACP), Pakistan Psychological Association(PPA) and Pakistan Psychological Society(PPS).

==Assessment==
An important area of expertise for many clinical psychologists is psychological assessment, and there are indications that as many as 91% of psychologists engage in this core clinical practice. Such evaluation is usually done in service to gaining insight into and forming hypothesis about psychological or behavioral problems. As such, the results of such assessments are usually used to create generalized impressions (rather than diagnosis) in service to informing treatment planning. Methods include formal testing measures, interviews, reviewing records, clinical observation, and physical examination.

===Measurement domains===
There exist hundreds of various assessment tools, although only a few have been shown to have both high validity (i.e., test actually measures what it claims to measure) and reliability (i.e., consistency). Many psychological assessment measures are restricted for use by those with advanced training in mental health. For instance, Pearson (one of the many companies with rights and protection of psychological assessment tools) separates who can administer, interpret, and report on certain tests. Anybody is able to access Qualification Level A tests. Those who intend to use assessment tools at Qualification Level B must hold a master&#x27;s degree in psychology, education, speech language pathology, occupational therapy, social work, counseling, or in a field closely related to the intended use of the assessment, and formal training in the ethical administration, scoring, and interpretation of clinical assessments. Those with access to Qualification C (highest level) assessment measures must hold a doctorate degree in psychology, education, or a closely related field with formal training in the ethical administration, scoring, and interpretation of clinical assessments related to the intended use of the assessment.

Psychological measures generally fall within one of several categories, including the following:
* Intelligence &amp; achievement tests – These tests are designed to measure certain specific kinds of cognitive functioning (often referred to as IQ) in comparison to a norming group. These tests, such as the WISC-IV and the WAIS, attempt to measure such traits as general knowledge, verbal skill, memory, attention span, logical reasoning, and visual/spatial perception. Several tests have been shown to predict accurately certain kinds of performance, especially scholastic. Other tests in this category include the WRAML and the WIAT.
* Personality tests – Tests of personality aim to describe patterns of behavior, thoughts, and feelings. They generally fall within two categories: objective and projective. Objective measures, such as the MMPI, are based on restricted answers—such as yes/no, true/false, or a rating scale—which allow for the computation of scores that can be compared to a normative group. Projective tests, such as the Rorschach inkblot test, allow for open-ended answers, often based on ambiguous stimuli. Other commonly used personality assessment measures include the PAI and the NEO
* Neuropsychological tests – Neuropsychological tests consist of specifically designed tasks used to measure psychological functions known to be linked to a particular brain structure or pathway. They are typically used to assess impairment after an injury or illness known to affect neurocognitive functioning, or when used in research, to contrast neuropsychological abilities across experimental groups.
* Diagnostic Measurement Tools – Clinical psychologists are able to diagnose psychological disorders and related disorders found in the DSM-5 and ICD-10. Many assessment tests have been developed to complement the clinicians clinical observation and other assessment activities. Some of these include the SCID-IV, the MINI, as well as some specific to certain psychological disorders such as the CAPS-5 for trauma, the ASEBA, and the K-SADS for affective and Schizophrenia in children.
* Clinical observation – Clinical psychologists are also trained to gather data by observing behavior. The clinical interview is a vital part of the assessment, even when using other formalized tools, which can employ either a structured or unstructured format. Such assessment looks at certain areas, such as general appearance and behavior, mood and affects, perception, comprehension, orientation, insight, memory, and content of the communication. One psychiatric example of a formal interview is the mental status examination, which is often used in psychiatry as a screening tool for treatment or further testing.

===Diagnosis===
Psychological assessment usually includes determining a mental disorder diagnosis. Many countries use the &quot;International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems&quot; (ICD-10 or ICD-11) while the US most often uses the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM-5). Both are nosological systems that largely assume categorical disorders diagnosed through the application of sets of criteria including symptoms and signs.

Several new models are being discussed, including a &quot;dimensional model&quot; based on empirically validated models of human differences (such as the five factor model of personality) and a &quot;psychosocial model&quot;, which would take changing, intersubjective states into greater account. The proponents of these models claim that they would offer greater diagnostic flexibility and clinical utility without depending on the medical concept of illness. However, they also admit that these models are not yet robust enough to gain widespread use, and should continue to be developed.

=== Clinical v. mechanical prediction ===
Clinical assessment can be characterized as a prediction problem where the purpose of assessment is to make inferences (predictions) about past, present, or future behavior. For example, many therapy decisions are made on the basis of what a clinician expects will help a patient make therapeutic gains. Once observations have been collected (e.g., psychological testing results, diagnostic impressions, clinical history, X-ray, etc.), there are two mutually exclusive ways to combine those sources of information to arrive at a decision, diagnosis, or prediction. One way is to combine the data in an algorithmic, or &quot;mechanical&quot; fashion. Mechanical prediction methods are simply a mode of combination of data to arrive at a decision/prediction of behavior (e.g., treatment response). The mechanical prediction does not preclude any type of data from being combined; it can incorporate clinical judgments, properly coded, in the algorithm. The defining characteristic is that, once the data to be combined is given, the mechanical approach will make a prediction that is 100% reliable. That is, it will make exactly the same prediction for exactly the same data every time. Clinical prediction, on the other hand, does not guarantee this, as it depends on the decision-making processes of the clinician making the judgment, their current state of mind, and knowledge base.

What has come to be called the &quot;clinical versus statistical prediction&quot; debate was first described in detail in 1954 by Paul Meehl, where he explored the claim that mechanical (formal, algorithmic) methods of data combination could outperform clinical (e.g., subjective, informal, &quot;in the clinician&#x27;s head&quot;) methods when such combinations are used to arrive at a prediction of behavior. Meehl concluded that mechanical modes of combination performed as well or better than clinical modes. Subsequent meta-analyses of studies that directly compare mechanical and clinical predictions have borne out Meehl&#x27;s 1954 conclusions. A 2009 survey of practicing clinical psychologists found that clinicians almost exclusively use their clinical judgment to make behavioral predictions for their patients, including diagnosis and prognosis.

==Intervention==

Psychotherapy involves a formal relationship between professional and client—usually an individual, couple, family, or small group—that employs a set of procedures intended to form a therapeutic alliance, explore the nature of psychological problems, and encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving.

Clinicians have a wide range of individual interventions to draw from, often guided by their training—for example, a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) clinician might use worksheets to record distressing cognitions, a psychoanalyst might encourage free association, while a psychologist trained in Gestalt techniques might focus on immediate interactions between client and therapist. Clinical psychologists generally seek to base their work on research evidence and outcome studies as well as on trained clinical judgment. Although there are literally dozens of recognized therapeutic orientations, their differences can often be categorized on two dimensions: insight vs. action and in-session vs. out-session.
* Insight – emphasis is on gaining a greater understanding of the motivations underlying one&#x27;s thoughts and feelings (e.g. psychodynamic therapy)
* Action – focus is on making changes in how one thinks and acts (e.g. solution focused therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy)
* In-session – interventions center on the here-and-now interaction between client and therapist (e.g. humanistic therapy, Gestalt therapy)
* Out-session – a large portion of therapeutic work is intended to happen outside of session (e.g. bibliotherapy, rational emotive behavior therapy)

The methods used are also different in regards to the population being served as well as the context and nature of the problem. Therapy will look very different between, say, a traumatized child, a depressed but high-functioning adult, a group of people recovering from substance dependence, and a ward of the state suffering from terrifying delusions. Other elements that play a critical role in the process of psychotherapy include the environment, culture, age, cognitive functioning, motivation, and duration (i.e. brief or long-term therapy).

===Four main schools===
Many clinical psychologists are integrative or eclectic and draw from the evidence base across different models of therapy in an integrative way, rather than using a single specific model.

In the UK, clinical psychologists have to show competence in at least two models of therapy, including CBT, to gain their doctorate. The British Psychological Society Division of Clinical Psychology has been vocal about the need to follow the evidence base rather than being wedded to a single model of therapy.

In the US, intervention applications and research are dominated in training and practice by essentially four major schools of practice: psychodynamic, humanism, behavioral/cognitive behavioral, and systems or family therapy.

====Psychodynamic====

The psychodynamic perspective developed out of the psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud. The core object of psychoanalysis is to make the unconscious conscious—to make the client aware of his or her own primal drives (namely those relating to sex and aggression) and the various defenses used to keep them in check. The essential tools of the psychoanalytic process are the use of free association and an examination of the client&#x27;s transference towards the therapist, defined as the tendency to take unconscious thoughts or emotions about a significant person (e.g. a parent) and &quot;transfer&quot; them onto another person. Major variations on Freudian psychoanalysis practiced today include self psychology, ego psychology, and object relations theory. These general orientations now fall under the umbrella term &quot;psychodynamic psychology&quot;, with common themes including examination of transference and defenses, an appreciation of the power of the unconscious, and a focus on how early developments in childhood have shaped the client&#x27;s current psychological state.

====Humanistic/Experiential====

Humanistic psychology was developed in the 1950s in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis, largely due to the person-centered therapy of Carl Rogers (often referred to as Rogerian Therapy) and existential psychology developed by Viktor Frankl and Rollo May. Rogers believed that a client needed only three things from a clinician to experience therapeutic improvement—congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathetic understanding. By using phenomenology, intersubjectivity and first-person categories, the humanistic approach seeks to get a glimpse of the whole person and not just the fragmented parts of the personality. This aspect of holism links up with another common aim of humanistic practice in clinical psychology, which is to seek an integration of the whole person, also called &quot;self-actualization&quot;. From 1980, Hans-Werner Gessmann integrated the ideas of humanistic psychology into group psychotherapy as &quot;humanistic psychodrama&quot;. According to humanistic thinking, each individual person already has inbuilt potentials and resources that might help them to build a stronger personality and self-concept. The mission of the humanistic psychologist is to help the individual employ these resources via the therapeutic relationship.
Emotion focused therapy/Emotionally focused therapy (EFT), not to be confused with Emotional Freedom Techniques, was initially informed by humanistic–phenomenological and Gestalt theories of therapy. &quot;Emotion Focused Therapy can be defined as the practice of therapy informed by an understanding of the role of emotion in psychotherapeutic change. EFT is founded on a close and careful analysis of the meanings and contributions of emotion to human experience and change in psychotherapy. This focus leads therapist and client toward strategies that promotes the awareness, acceptance, expression, utilization, regulation, and transformation of emotion as well as corrective emotional experience with the therapist. The goals of EFT are strengthening the self, regulating affect, and creating new meaning&quot;. Similarly to some Psychodynamic therapy approaches, EFT pulls heavily from attachment theory. Pioneers of EFT are Les Greenberg and Sue Johnson. EFT is often used in therapy with individuals, and may be especially useful for couples therapy. Founded in 1998, Sue Johnson and others lead the International Centre for Excellence in Emotion Focused Therapy (ICEEFT) where clinicians can find EFT training internationally. EFT is also a commonly chosen modality to treat clinically diagnosable trauma.

====Behavioral and cognitive behavioral====

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) developed from the combination of cognitive therapy and rational emotive behavior therapy, both of which grew out of cognitive psychology and behaviorism. CBT is based on the theory that how we think (cognition), how we feel (emotion), and how we act (behavior) are related and interact together in complex ways. In this perspective, certain dysfunctional ways of interpreting and appraising the world (often through &quot;schemas&quot; or &quot;beliefs&quot;) can contribute to emotional distress or result in behavioral problems. The object of many cognitive behavioral therapies is to discover and identify the biased, dysfunctional ways of relating or reacting and through different methodologies help clients transcend these in ways that will lead to increased well-being. There are many techniques used, such as systematic desensitization, socratic questioning, and keeping a cognition observation log. Modified approaches that fall into the category of CBT have also developed, including dialectic behavior therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.

Behavior therapy is a rich tradition. It is well researched with a strong evidence base. Its roots are in behaviorism. In behavior therapy, environmental events predict the way we think and feel. Our behavior sets up conditions for the environment to feedback back on it. Sometimes the feedback leads the behavior to increase- reinforcement and sometimes the behavior decreases- punishment. Oftentimes behavior therapists are called applied behavior analysts or behavioral health counselors. They have studied many areas from developmental disabilities to depression and anxiety disorders. In the area of mental health and addictions a recent article looked at APA&#x27;s list for well established and promising practices and found a considerable number of them based on the principles of operant and respondent conditioning. Multiple assessment techniques have come from this approach including functional analysis (psychology), which has found a strong focus in the school system. In addition, multiple intervention programs have come from this tradition including community reinforcement approach for treating addictions, acceptance and commitment therapy, functional analytic psychotherapy, including dialectic behavior therapy and behavioral activation. In addition, specific techniques such as contingency management and exposure therapy have come from this tradition.

====Systems or family therapy====

Systems or family therapy works with couples and families, and emphasizes family relationships as an important factor in psychological health. The central focus tends to be on interpersonal dynamics, especially in terms of how change in one person will affect the entire system. Therapy is therefore conducted with as many significant members of the &quot;system&quot; as possible. Goals can include improving communication, establishing healthy roles, creating alternative narratives, and addressing problematic behaviors.

===Other therapeutic perspectives===

There exist dozens of recognized schools or orientations of psychotherapy—the list below represents a few influential orientations not given above. Although they all have some typical set of techniques practitioners employ, they are generally better known for providing a framework of theory and philosophy that guides a therapist in his or her working with a client.
* Existential – Existential psychotherapy postulates that people are largely free to choose who we are and how we interpret and interact with the world. It intends to help the client find deeper meaning in life and to accept responsibility for living. As such, it addresses fundamental issues of life, such as death, aloneness, and freedom. The therapist emphasizes the client&#x27;s ability to be self-aware, freely make choices in the present, establish personal identity and social relationships, create meaning, and cope with the natural anxiety of living.
* Gestalt – Gestalt therapy was primarily founded by Fritz Perls in the 1950s. This therapy is perhaps best known for using techniques designed to increase self-awareness, the best-known perhaps being the &quot;empty chair technique.&quot; Such techniques are intended to explore resistance to &quot;authentic contact&quot;, resolve internal conflicts, and help the client complete &quot;unfinished business&quot;.
* Postmodern – Postmodern psychology says that the experience of reality is a subjective construction built upon language, social context, and history, with no essential truths. Since &quot;mental illness&quot; and &quot;mental health&quot; are not recognized as objective, definable realities, the postmodern psychologist instead sees the goal of therapy strictly as something constructed by the client and therapist. Forms of postmodern psychotherapy include narrative therapy, solution-focused therapy, and coherence therapy.
* Transpersonal – The transpersonal perspective places a stronger focus on the spiritual facet of human experience. It is not a set of techniques so much as a willingness to help a client explore spirituality and/or transcendent states of consciousness. Transpersonal psychology is concerned with helping clients achieve their highest potential.
* Multiculturalism – Although the theoretical foundations of psychology are rooted in European culture, there is a growing recognition that there exist profound differences between various ethnic and social groups and that systems of psychotherapy need to take those differences into greater consideration. Further, the generations following immigrant migration will have some combination of two or more cultures—with aspects coming from the parents and from the surrounding society—and this process of acculturation can play a strong role in therapy (and might itself be the presenting problem). Culture influences ideas about change, help-seeking, locus of control, authority, and the importance of the individual versus the group, all of which can potentially clash with certain givens in mainstream psychotherapeutic theory and practice. As such, there is a growing movement to integrate knowledge of various cultural groups in order to inform therapeutic practice in a more culturally sensitive and effective way.
* Feminism – Feminist therapy is an orientation arising from the disparity between the origin of most psychological theories (which have male authors) and the majority of people seeking counseling being female. It focuses on societal, cultural, and political causes and solutions to issues faced in the counseling process. It openly encourages the client to participate in the world in a more social and political way.
* Positive psychology – Positive psychology is the scientific study of human happiness and well-being, which started to gain momentum in 1998 due to the call of Martin Seligman, then president of the APA. The history of psychology shows that the field has been primarily dedicated to addressing mental illness rather than mental wellness. Applied positive psychology&#x27;s main focus, therefore, is to increase one&#x27;s positive experience of life and ability to flourish by promoting such things as optimism about the future, a sense of flow in the present, and personal traits like courage, perseverance, and altruism. There is now preliminary empirical evidence to show that by promoting Seligman&#x27;s three components of happiness—positive emotion (the pleasant life), engagement (the engaged life), and meaning (the meaningful life)—positive therapy can decrease clinical depression.
Community psychology approaches are often used for psychological prevention of harm and clinical intervention.

===Integration===

In the last couple of decades, there has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of cultural, gender, spiritual, and sexual-orientation issues. Clinical psychologists are beginning to look at the various strengths and weaknesses of each orientation while also working with related fields, such as neuroscience, behavioural genetics, evolutionary biology, and psychopharmacology. The result is a growing practice of eclecticism, with psychologists learning various systems and the most efficacious methods of therapy with the intent to provide the best solution for any given problem.

==Professional ethics==
The field of clinical psychology in most countries is strongly regulated by a code of ethics. In the US, professional ethics are largely defined by the APA &quot;Code of Conduct&quot;, which is often used by states to define licensing requirements. The APA Code generally sets a higher standard than that which is required by law as it is designed to guide responsible behavior, the protection of clients, and the improvement of individuals, organizations, and society. The Code is applicable to all psychologists in both research and applied fields.

The APA Code is based on five principles: Beneficence and Nonmaleficence, Fidelity and Responsibility, Integrity, Justice, and Respect for People&#x27;s Rights and Dignity. Detailed elements address how to resolve ethical issues, competence, human relations, privacy and confidentiality, advertising, record keeping, fees, training, research, publication, assessment, and therapy.

The Canadian Psychological Association ethical code principle&#x27;s are: Respect for the Dignity of Persons and Peoples, Responsible Caring, Integrity in Relationships, and Responsibility to Society. It is considered very similar to the APA&#x27;s Code.

In the UK the British Psychological Society has published a Code of Conduct and Ethics for clinical psychologists. This has four key areas: Respect, Competence, Responsibility and Integrity. Other European professional organizations have similar codes of conduct and ethics.

The Asian Federation for Psychotherapy published a code of ethics in 2008 with the following principles: Beneficence, Responsibility, Integrity, Justices, and Respect. Similar to the APA code, it provides detailed instructions for the conduct of psychologists, specifically psychotherapists. Russia, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, China, Malaysia, and Japan are member countries.

The National Latina/o Psychological Association adopted their current ethical guidelines in 2018, stating that &quot;the traditional Eurocentric foundations in mainstream psychology have provided culturally bound knowledge about worldviews, ways of living, and cultural practices.&quot; Their principles are: Respect and Responsibility, Ethical Dilemmas, Ethical Decision-Making and Legal Responsibility, Consultation, Justice and Advocacy, Self-Awareness and Social-Consciousness, Action and Accountability, Training and Creating Infrastructure, and Mentorship.

==Comparison with other mental health professions==
===Psychiatry===
Although clinical psychologists and psychiatrists can be said to share a same fundamental aim—the alleviation of mental distress—their training, outlook, and methodologies are often quite different. Perhaps the most significant difference is that psychiatrists are licensed physicians. As such, psychiatrists often use the medical model to assess psychological problems (i.e., those they treat are seen as patients with an illness) and can use psychotropic medications as a method of addressing the illness—although some also employ psychotherapy as well. Psychiatrists are able to conduct physical examinations, order and interpret laboratory tests and EEGs, and may order brain imaging studies such as CT or CAT, MRI, and PET scanning. Conversely, clinical psychologists conduct specialist assessment and psychometric testing. Such assessments and tests would not normally only be administered and interpreted by psychologists due to their advanced training in psychometric assessment. As standard clinical psychologists also usually possess more advanced training and specialist knowledge in psycho-social development and psychological therapies.

Clinical psychologists generally do not prescribe medication, although there is a movement for psychologists to have prescribing privileges. These medical privileges require additional training and education. To date, medical psychologists (prescribing psychologists) may prescribe psychotropic medications in Colorado, Guam, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, New Mexico, Louisiana, the Public Health Service, the Indian Health Service, and the United States Military.

===Counseling psychology===
Counseling psychologists undergo the same level of rigor in study and use many of the same interventions and tools as clinical psychologists, including psychotherapy and assessment. Traditionally, counseling psychologists helped people with what might be considered normal or moderate psychological problems—such as the feelings of anxiety or sadness resulting from major life changes or events. However, that distinction has faded over time, and of the counseling psychologists who do not go into academia (which does not involve treatment or diagnosis), the majority of counseling psychologists treat mental illness alongside clinical psychologists. Many counseling psychologists also receive specialized training in career assessment, group therapy, and relationship counseling.

Counseling psychology as a field values multiculturalism and social advocacy, often stimulating research in multicultural issues. There are fewer counseling psychology graduate programs than those for clinical psychology and they are more often housed in departments of education rather than psychology. Counseling psychologists tend to be more frequently employed in university counseling centers compared to hospitals and private practice for clinical psychologists. However, counseling and clinical psychologists can be employed in a variety of settings, with a large degree of overlap (prisons, colleges, community mental health, non-profits, corporations, private practice, hospitals and Veterans Affairs).

===School psychology===
School psychologists are primarily concerned with the academic, social, and emotional well-being of children and adolescents within a scholastic environment. In the UK, they are known as &quot;educational psychologists&quot;. Like clinical (and counseling) psychologists, school psychologists with doctoral degrees are eligible for licensure as health service psychologists, and many work in private practice. Unlike clinical psychologists, they receive much more training in education, child development and behavior, and the psychology of learning. Common degrees include the Educational Specialist Degree (EdS), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), and Doctor of Education (EdD).

Traditional job roles for school psychologists employed in school settings have focused mainly on assessment of students to determine their eligibility for special education services in schools, and on consultation with teachers and other school professionals to design and carry out interventions on behalf of students. Other major roles also include offering individual and group therapy with children and their families, designing prevention programs (e.g. for reducing dropout), evaluating school programs, and working with teachers and administrators to help maximize teaching efficacy, both in the classroom and systemically.

===Clinical social work===
Social workers provide a variety of services, generally concerned with social problems, their causes, and their solutions. With specific training, clinical social workers may also provide psychological counseling (in the US and Canada), in addition to more traditional social work.

===Occupational therapy===
Occupational therapy—often abbreviated OT—is the &quot;use of productive or creative activity in the treatment or rehabilitation of physically, cognitively, or emotionally disabled people.&quot; Most commonly, occupational therapists work with people with disabilities to enable them to maximize their skills and abilities. Occupational therapy practitioners are skilled professionals whose education includes the study of human growth and development with specific emphasis on the physical, emotional, psychological, sociocultural, cognitive and environmental components of illness and injury. They commonly work alongside clinical psychologists in settings such as inpatient and outpatient mental health, pain management clinics, eating disorder clinics, and child development services. OT&#x27;s use support groups, individual counseling sessions, and activity-based approaches to address psychiatric symptoms and maximize functioning in life activities.

==Criticisms and controversies==
Clinical psychology is a diverse field and there have been recurring tensions over the degree to which clinical practice should be limited to treatments supported by empirical research.

<doc id="492273" wikidata="Q1484877" url="?curid=492273" title="GB 18030">
<text>GB 18030 is a Chinese government standard, described as &quot;Information Technology — Chinese coded character set&quot; and defines the required language and character support necessary for software in China. GB18030 is the registered Internet name for the official character set of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) superseding GB2312. As a Unicode Transformation Format (i.e. an encoding of all Unicode code points), GB18030 supports both simplified and traditional Chinese characters. It is also compatible with legacy encodings including GB/T 2312, CP936, and GBK 1.0.

The Unicode Consortium has warned implementers that the latest version of this Chinese standard, GB 18030-2022, introduces what they describe as &quot;disruptive changes&quot; from the previous version GB 18030-2005 &quot;involving 33 different characters and 55 code positions&quot;. GB 18030-2022 was enforced from 1 August 2023. It has been implemented in ICU 73.2; and in Java 21, and backported to older Java 8, 11, 17 (LTS releases) and 20.0.2.

In addition to the encoding method, this standard contains requirements about which additional scripts and languages should be represented, and to whom this standard is applicable. This standard however does not define the official character forms for the Chinese characters; this is standardised in &quot;List of Commonly Used Standard Chinese Characters&quot;.

== History ==

The GB18030 character set is formally called &quot;Chinese National Standard GB 18030-2005: Information Technology—Chinese coded character set&quot;. GB abbreviates (), which means &quot;national standard&quot; in Chinese. The standard was published by the China Standard Press, Beijing, 8 November 2005. Only a portion of the standard is mandatory. Since 1 May 2006, support for the mandatory subset is officially required for all software products sold in the PRC.
An older version of the standard, known as &quot;Chinese National Standard GB 18030-2000: Information Technology—Chinese ideograms coded character set for information interchange—Extension for the basic set&quot;, was published on March 17, 2000. The encoding scheme stays the same in the new version, and the only difference in GB-to-Unicode mapping is that GB 18030-2000 mapped the character (ḿ) to a private use code point U+E7C7, and character (without specifying any glyph) to U+1E3F (ḿ), whereas GB 18030-2005 swaps these two mapping assignments. More code points are now associated with characters due to update of Unicode, especially the appearance of CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B. Some characters used by ethnic minorities in China, such as Mongolian characters and Tibetan characters (GB 16959-1997 and GB/T 20542-2006), have been added as well, which accounts for the renaming of the standard.

Compared with its ancestors, GB 18030&#x27;s mapping to Unicode has been modified for the 81 characters that were provisionally assigned a Unicode Private Use Area code point (U+E000–F8FF) in GBK 1.0 and that have later been encoded in Unicode. This is specified in Appendix E of GB 18030. There are 24 characters in GB 18030-2005 that are still mapped to Unicode PUA.

In the GB 18030-2022 update, the requirements for characters to be mapped to PUA has been lifted completely and all characters should be mapped to their standard Unicode codepoints. Of these, 18 mappings were updated by position-swapping similar to what happened between GBK and GB 18030. The remaining six kept the two-byte PUA mappings, so that a change to the 4-byte sequence is needed to follow the non-PUA preference.

== As a national standard ==
The first version of GB 18030, designated GB 18030-2000 &quot;Information Technology—Chinese coded character set for information interchange — Extension for the basic set&quot;, consists of 1-byte and 2-byte encodings, together with 4-byte encoding for CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A matching those in Unicode 3.0. The corresponding Unicode code points of this subset, including provisional private assignments, lie entirely in the BMP. These parts are fully mandatory in GB 18030-2000. Most major computer companies had already standardized on some version of Unicode as the primary format for use in their binary formats and OS calls. However, they mostly had only supported code points in the BMP originally defined in Unicode 1.0, which supported only 65,536 codepoints and was often encoded in 16 bits as UCS-2. This standard is basically an extension based on GBK with additional characters in CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A.

The second version designated GB 18030-2005 &quot;Information Technology—Chinese coded character set&quot; has the same mandatory subset as GB 18030-2000 of 1-, 2- and 4-byte encodings. This version also includes the full CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B in the 4-byte encoding section which is outside the BMP as a suggestion support requirement. However, as the inclusion of CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B in a 4-byte region is required to be maintained during information processing, software can no longer get away with treating characters as 16-bit fixed width entities (UCS-2). Therefore, they must either process the data as a variable-width format (as with UTF-8 or UTF-16), which is the most common choice, or move to a larger fixed-width format (i.e. UTF-32). Microsoft made the change from UCS-2 to UTF-16 with Windows 2000. This version matches with Unicode 3.1, and also provided support for Hangul (Korean), Mongolian (including Manchu, Clear script, &quot;Sibe hergen&quot;, Galik), Tai Nuea, Tibetan, Uyghur/Kazakh/Kyrgyz and Yi.

The third and latest version, GB 18030-2022 &quot;Information Technology—Chinese coded character set&quot;, mandates the suggestion support part of CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B in GB 18030-2005, along with updates up to Unicode 11.0 including Kangxi Radicals and CJK Unified Ideographs URO, Extension C, D, E and F. Additional languages are also recognized by GB 18030-2022 such as part of Arabic, Tai Le, New Tai Lue, Tai Tham, Lisu, and Miao. GB 18030-2022 also introduces three implementation levels, with the requirement of &quot;all products using this standard should implements Implementation Level 1&quot; that includes 66 new BMP characters in the 4-byte encoding region that were added between Unicode 3.1 and Unicode 11.0. Implementation Level 2 requires the support of &quot;List of Commonly Used Standard Chinese Characters&quot;, and Implementation Level 3 requires all other specified regions in the standard.

From late 2022 to 2023, drafts of a further amendment are to be made to GB 18030-2022 available for public consultation. The current draft updates up to Unicode 15.1 on Ideographic Description Characters, CJK Unified Ideographs URO, Extension A, B, C, G, H and I. Originally, in late 2022, it would have placed 897 new sinographic characters in Plane 10 (hexadecimal: 0A), a yet-untitled astral Unicode plane, for citizen real-name certification in China, but eventually the repertoire (reduced to 622 characters after expert review) was fast-tracked into Unicode 15.1 in September 2023, as the CJK Unified Ideographs Extension I block. Following this, the amendment draft was modified to use the Extension I code points.

== Mapping ==
GB 18030 defines a one (ASCII), two (extended GBK), or four-byte (UTF) encoding. The two-byte codes are defined in a lookup table, while the four-byte codes are defined sequentially (hence algorithmically) to fill otherwise unencoded parts in UCS. GB 18030 inherits the bad aspects of GBK, most notably needing special code to safely find ASCII characters in a GB18030 sequence.

The one- and two-byte code points are essentially GBK with the euro sign, PUA mappings for unassigned/user-defined points, and vertical punctuations. The four byte scheme can be thought of as consisting of two units, each of two bytes. Each unit has a similar format to a GBK two byte character but with a range of values for the second byte of 0x30–0x39 (the ASCII codes for decimal digits). The first byte has the range 0x81 to 0xFE, as before. This means that a string-search routine that is safe for GBK should also be reasonably safe for GB18030 (in much the same way that a basic byte-oriented search routine is reasonably safe for EUC).

This gives a total of 1,587,600 (126×10×126×10) possible 4-byte sequences, which is easily sufficient to cover Unicode&#x27;s 1,112,064 (17×65536 − 2048 surrogates) assigned, reserved, and noncharacter code points.

Unfortunately, to further complicate matters there are no simple rules to translate between a 4-byte sequence and its corresponding code point. Instead, codes are allocated sequentially (with the first byte containing the most significant part and the last the least significant part) only to Unicode code points that are not mapped in any other manner. For example:

 U+00DE (Þ) → 81 30 89 37
 U+00DF (ß) → 81 30 89 38
 U+00E0 (à) → A8 A4
 U+00E1 (á) → A8 A2
 U+00E2 (â) → 81 30 89 39
 U+00E3 (ã) → 81 30 8A 30

An offset table is used in the WHATWG and W3C version of GB 18030 to efficiently translate code points. ICU and glibc use similar range definitions to avoid wasting space on large sequential blocks.

== Support ==

=== Encoding ===
GB18030 has been supported on Windows since the release of Windows 95, as code page 54936. Windows 2000 and XP offer a GB18030 Support Package. The open source PostgreSQL database supports GB18030 through its full support for UTF-8, i.e. by converting it to and from UTF-8. Similarly Microsoft SQL Server supports GB18030 by conversion to and from UTF-16.

More specifically, supporting the GB18030 encoding on Windows means that Code Page 54936 is supported by codice_1 and codice_2. Due to the backward compatibility of the mapping, many files in GB18030 can be actually opened successfully as the legacy Code Page 936, that is GBK, even if the Code Page 54936 is not supported. However, that is only true if the file in question contains only GBK characters. Loading will fail or cause corrupted result if the file contains characters that do not exist in GBK (see for examples).

GNU glibc&#x27;s gconv, the character codec library used on most Linux distributions, supports GB 18030-2000 since 2.2, and GB 18030-2005 since 2.14; glibc notably includes non-PUA mappings for GB 18030-2005 in order to achieve round-trip conversion. GNU libiconv, an alternative iconv implementation frequently used on non-glibc UNIX-like environments like Cygwin, supports GB 18030 since version 1.4.

As of 2022, &quot;supporting non-Chinese scripts continues to be optional&quot; (presumably for display/font support only; and in China, since the encoding is a full UTF). The standard is known to support English/ASCII and the &quot;following non-Chinese scripts are recognized by GB 18030-2022: Arabic, Tibetan, Mongolian, Tai Le, New Tai Lue, Tai Tham, Yi, Lisu, Hangul (Korean), and Miao.&quot;

=== Fonts ===
The GB18030 Support Package for Windows contains SimSun18030.ttc, a TrueType font collection file which combines two Chinese fonts, SimSun-18030 and NSimSun-18030. The SimSun 18030 font includes all the characters in Unicode 2.1 plus new characters found in the Unicode CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A block although, despite its name, it does not contain glyphs for all characters encoded by GB 18030, as all (about a million) Unicode code points up to U+10FFFF can be encoded as GB 18030. GB 18030 compliance certification only requires correct handling and recognition of glyphs in the mandatory (two-byte, and CJK Ext. A) Chinese part. Nevertheless, the requirement of PUA characters in the standard have hampered this implementation.

Microsoft YaHei and DengXian provided by Microsoft are updated in 2023 to match GB 18030-2022 implementation level 2, and SimSun is updated to match implementation level 3.

Source Han Sans (and its counterpart Noto Sans CJK) are already compliant with GB 18030-2022 implementation level 2 when the standard update for GB 18030 is announced . Source Han Serif (and its counterpart Noto Serif CJK) however is not compliant at the time, and an update is provided to ensure the font is compliant to implementation level 2. Similarly Microsoft YaHei and PingFang (Apple) require a small number of URO additions that are associated with implementation level 1 in order to become compliant with GB 18030-2022 implementation level 2.

Other CJK font families like HAN NOM and Hanazono Mincho provide wider coverage for Unicode CJK Extension blocks than SimSun-18030 or even SimSun (Founder Extended), but they don&#x27;t support all code points defined in GB 18030.

<doc id="492281" wikidata="Q893290" url="?curid=492281" title="Union type">
<text>In computer science, a union is a value that may have any of multiple representations or formats within the same area of memory; that consists of a variable that may hold such a data structure. Some programming languages support a union type for such a data type. In other words, a union type specifies the permitted types that may be stored in its instances, e.g., codice_1 and codice_2. In contrast with a record, which could be defined to contain both a float &quot;and&quot; an integer; a union would hold only one at a time.

A union can be pictured as a chunk of memory that is used to store variables of different data types. Once a new value is assigned to a field, the existing data is overwritten with the new data. The memory area storing the value has no intrinsic type (other than just bytes or words of memory), but the value can be treated as one of several abstract data types, having the type of the value that was last written to the memory area.

In type theory, a union has a sum type; this corresponds to disjoint union in mathematics.

Depending on the language and type, a union value may be used in some operations, such as assignment and comparison for equality, without knowing its specific type. Other operations may require that knowledge, either by some external information, or by the use of a tagged union.

==Untagged unions==
Because of the limitations of their use, untagged unions are generally only provided in untyped languages or in a type-unsafe way (as in C). They have the advantage over simple tagged unions of not requiring space to store a data type tag.

The name &quot;union&quot; stems from the type&#x27;s formal definition. If a type is considered as the set of all values that that type can take on, a union type is simply the mathematical union of its constituting types, since it can take on any value any of its fields can. Also, because a mathematical union discards duplicates, if more than one field of the union can take on a single common value, it is impossible to tell from the value alone which field was last written.

However, one useful programming function of unions is to map smaller data elements to larger ones for easier manipulation. A data structure consisting, for example, of 4 bytes and a 32-bit integer, can form a union with an unsigned 64-bit integer, and thus be more readily accessed for purposes of comparison etc.

==Unions in various programming languages==
===ALGOL 68===

ALGOL 68 has tagged unions, and uses a case clause to distinguish and extract the constituent type at runtime. A union containing another union is treated as the set of all its constituent possibilities, and if the context requires it a union is automatically coerced into the wider union. A union can explicitly contain no value, which can be distinguished at runtime. An example is:

 mode node = union (real, int, string, void);
 node n := &quot;abc&quot;;
 case n in
 (real r): print((&quot;real:&quot;, r)),
 (int i): print((&quot;int:&quot;, i)),
 (string s): print((&quot;string:&quot;, s)),
 (void): print((&quot;void:&quot;, &quot;EMPTY&quot;)),
 out print((&quot;?:&quot;, n))
 esac

The syntax of the C/C++ union type and the notion of casts was derived from ALGOL 68, though in an untagged form.

===C/C++===
In C and C++, untagged unions are expressed nearly exactly like structures (structs), except that each data member is located at the same memory address. The data members, as in structures, need not be primitive values, and in fact may be structures or even other unions. C++ (since C++11) also allows for a data member to be any type that has a full-fledged constructor/destructor and/or copy constructor, or a non-trivial copy assignment operator. For example, it is possible to have the standard C++ string as a member of a union.

The primary use of a union is allowing access to a common location by different data types, for example hardware input/output access, bitfield and word sharing, or type punning. Unions can also provide low-level polymorphism. However, there is no checking of types, so it is up to the programmer to be sure that the proper fields are accessed in different contexts. The relevant field of a union variable is typically determined by the state of other variables, possibly in an enclosing struct.

One common C programming idiom uses unions to perform what C++ calls a codice_3, by assigning to one field of a union and reading from another, as is done in code which depends on the raw representation of the values. A practical example is the method of computing square roots using the IEEE representation. This is not, however, a safe use of unions in general.

====Anonymous union====
In C++, C11, and as a non-standard extension in many compilers, unions can also be anonymous. Their data members do not need to be referenced, are instead accessed directly. They have some restrictions as opposed to traditional unions: in C11, they must be a member of another structure or union, and in C++, they can not have methods or access specifiers.

Simply omitting the class-name portion of the syntax does not make a union an anonymous union. For a union to qualify as an anonymous union, the declaration must not declare an object.
Example:

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;

int main() {
 union {
 float f;
 uint32_t d; // Assumes float is 32 bits wide

 f = 3.14f;
 std::cout « &quot;Hexadecimal representation of 3.14f:&quot; 
 « std::hex « d « &#x27;\n&#x27;;
return 0;


Anonymous unions are also useful in C codice_4 definitions to provide a sense of namespacing.

==== Transparent union ====
In compilers such as GCC, Clang, and IBM XL C for AIX, a attribute is available for union types. Types contained in the union can be converted transparently to the union type itself in a function call, provided that all types have the same size. It is mainly intended for function with multiple parameter interfaces, a use necessitated by early Unix extensions and later re-standardisation.

===COBOL===
In COBOL, union data items are defined in two ways. The first uses the (66 level) keyword, which effectively maps a second alphanumeric data item on top of the same memory location as a preceding data item. In the example code below, data item is defined as a group containing another group and a numeric data item. is defined as an alphanumeric data item that renames , treating the data bytes continued within it as character data.
 01 PERSON-REC.
 05 PERSON-NAME.
 10 PERSON-NAME-LAST PIC X(12).
 10 PERSON-NAME-FIRST PIC X(16).
 10 PERSON-NAME-MID PIC X.
 05 PERSON-ID PIC 9(9) PACKED-DECIMAL.
 01 PERSON-DATA RENAMES PERSON-REC.

The second way to define a union type is by using the keyword. In the example code below, data item is defined as a 2-byte binary integer containing a version number. A second data item is defined as a two-character alphanumeric variable. Since the second item is &quot;redefined&quot; over the first item, the two items share the same address in memory, and therefore share the same underlying data bytes. The first item interprets the two data bytes as a binary value, while the second item interprets the bytes as character values.
 01 VERS-INFO.
 05 VERS-NUM PIC S9(4) COMP.
 05 VERS-BYTES PIC X(2)
 REDEFINES VERS-NUM
===Pascal===
In Pascal, there are two ways to create unions. One is the standard way through a variant record. The second is a nonstandard means of declaring a variable as absolute, meaning it is placed at the same memory location as another variable or at an absolute address. While all Pascal compilers support variant records, only some support absolute variables.

For the purposes of this example, the following are all integer types: a byte consists of 8 bits, a word is 16 bits, and an integer is 32 bits.

The following example shows the non-standard absolute form:

var
 A: Integer;
 B: array[1..4] of Byte absolute A;
 C: Integer absolute 0;

In the first example, each of the elements of the array B maps to one of the specific bytes of the variable A. In the second example, the variable C is assigned to the exact machine address 0.

In the following example, a record has variants, some of which share the same location as others:

type
 Shape = (Circle, Square, Triangle);
 Dimensions = record
 case Figure: Shape of 
 Circle: (Diameter: real);
 Square: (Width: real);
 Triangle: (Side: real; Angle1, Angle2: 0..360)
 end;
===PL/I===
In PL/I the original term for a union was &quot;cell&quot;, which is still accepted as a synonym for union by several compilers. The union declaration is similar to the structure definition, where elements at the same level within the union declaration occupy the same storage. Elements of the union can be any data type, including structures and array. Here 
vers_num and vers_bytes occupy the same storage locations.
 1 vers_info union,
 5 vers_num fixed binary,
 5 vers_bytes pic &#x27;(2)A&#x27;;
An alternative to a union declaration is the DEFINED attribute, which allows alternative declarations of storage, however the data types of the base and defined variables must match.

===Rust===

Rust implements both tagged and untagged unions. In Rust, tagged unions are implemented using the keyword. Unlike enumerated types in most other languages, enum variants in Rust can contain additional data in the form of a tuple or struct, making them tagged unions rather than simple enumerated types.

Rust also supports untagged unions using the keyword. The memory layout of unions in Rust is undefined by default, but a union with the attribute will be laid out in memory exactly like the equivalent union in C. Reading the fields of a union can only be done within an function or block, as the compiler cannot guarantee that the data in the union will be valid for the type of the field; if this is not the case, it will result in undefined behavior.

==Syntax and example==
===C/C++===
In C and C++, the syntax is:

union &lt;name&gt;
 &lt;datatype&gt; &lt;1st variable name&gt;;
 &lt;datatype&gt; &lt;2nd variable name&gt;;
 .
 &lt;datatype&gt; &lt;nth variable name&gt;;
} &lt;union variable name&gt;;
A structure can also be a member of a union, as the following example shows:

union name1
 struct name2
 int a;
 float b;
 char c;
 } svar;
 int d;
} uvar;

This example defines a variable codice_5 as a union (tagged as codice_6), which contains two members, a structure (tagged as codice_7) named codice_8 (which in turn contains three members), and an integer variable named codice_9.

Unions may occur within structures and arrays, and vice versa:

struct
 int flags;
 char *name;
 int utype;
 union {
 int ival;
 float fval;
 char *sval;
 } u;
} symtab[NSYM];

The number ival is referred to as codice_10 and the first character of string sval by either of codice_11 or codice_12.

===PHP===
Union types were introduced in PHP 8.0. The values are implicitly &quot;tagged&quot; with a type by the language, and may be retrieved by &quot;gettype()&quot;.

class Example
 private int|float $foo;

 public function squareAndAdd(float|int $bar): int|float
 return $bar ** 2 + $this-&gt;foo;
}
===Python===
Support for typing was introduced in Python 3.5. The new syntax for union types were introduced in Python 3.10.

class Example:
 foo = 0

 def square_and_add(self, bar: int | float) -&gt; int | float:
 return bar ** 2 + self.foo
===TypeScript===
Union types are supported in TypeScript. The values are implicitly &quot;tagged&quot; with a type by the language, and may be retrieved using a codice_13 call for primitive values and an codice_14 comparison for complex data types. Types with overlapping usage (e.g. a slice method exists on both strings and arrays, the plus operator works on both strings and numbers) don&#x27;t need additional narrowing to use these features.

function successor(n: number | bigint): number | bigint {
 // types that support the same operations don&#x27;t need narrowing
 return ++n;

function dependsOnParameter(v: string | Array&lt;string&gt; | number) {
 // distinct types need narrowing
 if (v instanceof Array) {
 // do something
 } else if (typeof(v) === &quot;string&quot;) {
 // do something else
 } else {
 // has to be a number
}
===Rust===
Tagged unions in Rust use the keyword, and can contain tuple and struct variants:
enum Foo {
 Bar(i32),
 Baz { x: String, y: i32 },


Untagged unions in Rust use the keyword:
union Foo {
 bar: i32,
 baz: bool,


Reading from the fields of an untagged union results in undefined behavior if the data in the union is not valid as the type of the field, and thus requires an block:
let x = Foo { bar: 10 };
let y = unsafe { x.bar }; // This will set y to 10, and does not result in undefined behavior.
let z = unsafe { x.baz }; // This results in undefined behavior, as the value stored in x is not a valid bool.

<text>The Bank of America Corporate Center is an 871 ft (265 m) skyscraper in Uptown Charlotte, North Carolina. Designed by Argentine architect César Pelli and HKS Architects, and best known as the headquarters of the namesake Bank of America, it has been the tallest building in North Carolina since its 1992 construction, the 51st-tallest building in the United States, and the 174th-tallest building in the world.

Sometimes locally referred to as the &quot;Taj McColl&quot; after former Bank of America CEO Hugh McColl, who was responsible for the tower&#x27;s construction, on a clear day the tower is visible to the naked eye from away.

==Amenities==
===Ben Long Frescoes===
Located in the Corporate Center&#x27;s lobby are three frescoes that measure each and are the largest secular fresco in the United States. Created by North Carolinian artist Ben Long and a team of nine artists, the frescoes were completed in approximately four months in 1992. The three frescoes are a triptych, three related works, which was inspired by Shingon. The first panel Making/Building, on left, depiction of the construction of the Corporate Center. A row of workers holding golden spades appear at the bottom, while at the top is another worker, a leader, holds a spade as he gazes into the distance towards a figure asleep on the hill. The second panel Chaos/Creativity, at center, depicts a jostling crowd of figures of various occupations, while a circle of six nude figures spin above the crowd, creating a contrast. The third panel Planning/Knowledge, on right, is a portrait of a young boy, geometric shapes, a pyramid, people in the lower-left corner in a discussion, a dancing girl, and a figure sitting by a burning tree.

===Blumenthal Performing Arts Center===

Connected to the Corporate Center, along East 5th Street, the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center contains three performance halls: Belk Theater, Booth Playhouse, and Stage Door Theater.

===Founders Hall===

Connected to the Corporate Center, Founders Hall is a large vaulted atrium that features red-brown marble floors and a water fountain. Ringed around it are two levels of retail and restaurants, which are part of the Overstreet Mall, and is connected by skybridges to neighboring Bank of America Center, One South at The Plaza, and Truist Center.

==History==
===Announcement===
On Wednesday, December 10, 1986, North Carolina National Bank announced that it would construct what would become the Corporate Center. Jointly developed with Charter Properties, the project was initially announced as a 50 story tower to be constructed with a 350-room hotel and what would become the North Carolina Blumenthal Performing Arts Center. The initial design for the 50 story tower was created by Charlotte-based Odell Associates. Its design featured a circular tower complete with a Greek cross lying flat on top to pay homage to the intersection of Trade and Tryon.

Additionally, its construction resulted in the demolition of an entire city block bound by North Tryon, East Trade, North College and East 5th Streets. The most notable buildings lost in its construction were the Belk department store, constructed in 1908, along East Trade and the Efird&#x27;s department store, constructed in 1922, on North Tryon.

===Design competition===

On Monday, July 20, 1987, NCNB announced Lincoln Property as a general partner for the project. With the development team set, the process of hiring an architect of the project commenced in August 1987.

The architectural firms that competed for the job included:
* I.M. Pei of New York City
* Skidmore, Owings and Merrill of Chicago
* Cesar Pelli &amp; Associates of New Haven, Connecticut
* HKS Architects of Dallas
* John Burgee Architects of New York City
* WZMH Group of Dallas
* Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates of New York City

On Friday, September 25, 1987, the Cesar Pelli design was announced by NCNB Chairman Hugh McColl as being selected for the project. Additionally at the press conference it was revealed that the tower would be between 55-60 stories tall, sheathed in granite and be officially named the NCNB Corporate Center.

After winning the contract, its design was unveiled eight months later to the public on Tuesday, June 14, 1988. The final design was the 60 floor tower seen today. It features a granite base along North Tryon Street followed by a facade of rosy beige granite and silver glass rising complete with curved sides. The tower gradually tapers through a series of six setbacks at the 13th, 44th and 53rd floors on the corners and at the 47th, 56th and 60th floors on the face as it reaches the tip of its crown above Tryon Street.

===Construction===

On Tuesday, January 3, 1989, demolition commenced on the block where the tower would eventually rise. The demolition work would take just over seven months to complete before excavation could commence. Site preparation would continue from August through November. During the excavation for the foundation, contractors found threads and flakes of gold embedded within pieces of granite removed from the site. The discovery was not unexpected as Charlotte was the center of America&#x27;s first gold rush during the 1830s.

On November 19, 1989, the initial concrete pour was completed signaling the beginning of actual construction.
The mat foundation consists of a thick slab containing of concrete and 150 tons of reinforcing steel at the center of the tower. The foundation reaches below Tryon Street at its deepest point with the tower being supported by 36 concrete and steel piers. These piers are able to withstand the placed upon them by the structure.

After only a couple of months, construction was temporarily halted after Hurricane Hugo slammed Charlotte with winds causing some damage on-site on Friday, September 22, 1989.

By November 1990, the tower had reached its 30th floor and as a result had risen to being the 5th tallest within Charlotte. On Wednesday, March 20, 1991, the tower officially became both Charlotte&#x27;s and North Carolina&#x27;s tallest when it reached a height of at its 47th floor to surpass the tall One First Union Center. The tower was officially topped-out on Wednesday, October 2, 1991 with the final concrete pour completed. From this point, the tall crown was installed with its completion coming in December bringing the tower to its final height.

By January 1992, the tower had since been renamed the NationsBank Corporate Center to reflect the bank&#x27;s name change from NCNB to NationsBank in summer 1991. On May 1, the first tenants moved into the tower with its inaugural crown lighting taking place on May 9.

Completed in July 1992, its official dedication ceremony took place on Saturday, October 17, 1992. The celebrations that day included live entertainment, rappellers from Fort Bragg&#x27;s 16th Military Police Brigade rappelling the height of the tower and a fireworks show.

=== Post-opening ===
Since its completion, the Bank of America Corporate Center has been the world headquarters for what is now Bank of America. NationsBank bought BankAmerica Corporation in 1998, changed its name to Bank of America and sold BankAmerica&#x27;s headquarters at 555 California Street, then the Bank of America Center, in San Francisco. Moore &amp; Van Allen and Ernst &amp; Young are also tenants in the tower.

The Bank of America Corporate Center&#x27;s crown shaped spire is the focal point of the building and it makes it stand out architecturally. Its spire does not reflect from the outside like the Chrysler Building or any others; it shines from within and instead of stainless steel there is glass illuminated by floodlights, making it stand out from the many world skyscrapers. Bank of America began shining the top of the crown shaped spire from white to blue in honor of the Carolina Panthers who were NFC champions in the 2003–2004 NFL season. In 2017 it was announced LEDs had been installed in the spire.

On July 20, 2005 Ken Lewis, then CEO and Mr. Cyprian White of the Credit Bureau of the Bank of America, announced the construction of a brand new 150 key Ritz-Carlton and LEED certified 40 story office retail complex located adjacent to the Bank of America Corporate Center.

==FAA controversy==
On May 15, 1989, a ruling by the Federal Aviation Administration stated that the tower&#x27;s height would potentially jeopardize some flights taking off and landing at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport. The ruling came even though Charlotte&#x27;s dominant airline, USAir, and airport officials had determined that the tower was not a hazard. A June 12 appeal filed with the regional FAA office in Atlanta upheld the original ruling resulting in the case being appealed to Washington. Although the FAA could not force NCNB to halt construction of the tower, its &quot;declaration of hazard to air navigation&quot; could have potentially cost the city millions in federal airport grants as well as impeding the ability of NCNB to secure insurance for the tower upon its completion.

By December 1989, the issue was resolved when the FAA ruled that slight changes in air-traffic procedures around the building would resolve the hazard posed by the tower. With the influence of both U.S. representative Alex McMillan and Senator Ernest Hollings, the reversal of the original ruling was made after further review by the FAA. Since its construction, there has not been an incident involving an aircraft and the tower.

<doc id="492295" wikidata="Q2470517" url="?curid=492295" title="Record (computer science)">
<text>In computer science, a record (also called a structure, [[struct (C programming language)|struct]], or [[compound data type]]) is a composite data structure a collection of fields, possibly of different data types, typically fixed in number and sequence.

For example, a date could be stored as a record containing a numeric year field, a month field represented as a string, and a numeric day-of-month field. A circle record might contain a numeric radius and a center that is a point record containing x and y coordinates.

Notable applications include the programming language &quot;record type&quot; and for row-based storage, data organized as a sequence of records, such as a database table, spreadsheet or comma-separated values (CSV) file. In general, a record type value is stored in memory and row-based storage is in mass storage.

A &quot;record type&quot; is a data type that describes such values and variables. Most modern programming languages allow the programmer to define new record types. The definition includes specifying the data type of each field and an identifier (name or label) by which it can be accessed. In type theory, product types (with no field names) are generally preferred due to their simplicity, but proper record types are studied in languages such as System F-sub. Since type-theoretical records may contain first-class function-typed fields in addition to data, they can express many features of object-oriented programming.

==Terminology==

In the context of storage such as in a database or spreadsheet a record is often called a &quot;row&quot; and each field is called a column.

In object-oriented programming, an object is a record that contains state and method fields.

A record is similar to a mathematical tuple, although a tuple may or may not be considered a record, and vice versa, depending on conventions and the programming language. In the same vein, a record type can be viewed as the computer language analog of the Cartesian product of two or more mathematical sets, or the implementation of an abstract product type in a specific language.

A record differs from an array in that a record&#x27;s elements (fields) are determined by the definition of the record, and may be heterogeneous whereas an array is a collection of elements with the same type.

The parameters of a function can be viewed collectively as the fields of a record and passing arguments to the function can be viewed as assigning the input parameters to the record fields. At a low-level, a function call includes an &quot;activation record&quot; or &quot;call frame&quot;, that contains the parameters as well as other fields such as local variables and the return address.

==History==
The concept of a record can be traced to various types of tables and ledgers used in accounting since remote times. The modern notion of records in computer science, with fields of well-defined type and size, was already implicit in 19th century mechanical calculators, such as Babbage&#x27;s Analytical Engine.
The original machine-readable medium used for data (as opposed to control) was the punch card used for records in the 1890 United States census: each punch card was a single record. Compare the journal entry from 1880 and the punch card from 1895. Records were well-established in the first half of the 20th century, when most data processing was done using punched cards. Typically, each record of a data file would be recorded on one punched card, with specific columns assigned to specific fields. Generally, a record was the smallest unit that could be read from external storage (e.g., card reader, tape, or disk). The contents of punchcard-style records were originally called &quot;unit records&quot; because punchcards had pre-determined document lengths. When storage systems became more advanced with the use of hard drives and magnetic tape, variable-length records became the standard. A variable-length record is a record in which the size of the record in bytes is approximately equal to the sum of the sizes of its fields. This was not possible to do before more advanced storage hardware was invented because all of the punchcards had to conform to pre-determined document lengths that the computer could read, since at the time the cards had to be physically fed into a machine.

Most machine language implementations and early assembly languages did not have special syntax for records, but the concept was available (and extensively used) through the use of index registers, indirect addressing, and self-modifying code. Some early computers, such as the IBM 1620, had hardware support for delimiting records and fields, and special instructions for copying such records.

The concept of records and fields was central in some early file sorting and tabulating utilities, such as IBM&#x27;s Report Program Generator (RPG).
 was the first widespread programming language to support record types, and its record definition facilities were quite sophisticated at the time. The language allows for the definition of nested records with alphanumeric, integer, and fractional fields of arbitrary size and precision, and fields that automatically format any value assigned to them (e.g., insertion of currency signs, decimal points, and digit group separators). Each file is associated with a record variable where data is read into or written from. COBOL also provides a codice_1 codice_2 statement that assigns corresponding fields of two records according to their names.

The early languages developed for numeric computing, such as FORTRAN (up to FORTRAN IV) and ALGOL 60, did not support record types; but later versions of those languages, such as FORTRAN 77 and ALGOL 68 did add them. The original Lisp programming language too was lacking records (except for the built-in cons cell), but its S-expressions provided an adequate surrogate. The Pascal programming language was one of the first languages to fully integrate record types with other basic types into a logically consistent type system. The PL/I language provided for COBOL-style records. The C language provides the record concept using structs. Most languages designed after Pascal (such as Ada, Modula, and Java), also supported records.

Although records are not often used in their original context anymore (i.e. being used solely for the purpose of containing data), records influenced newer object-oriented programming languages and relational database management systems. Since records provided more modularity in the way data was stored and handled, they are better suited at representing complex, real-world concepts than the primitive data types provided by default in languages. This influenced later languages such as C++, Python, JavaScript, and Objective-C which address the same modularity needs of programming. Objects in these languages are essentially records with the addition of methods and inheritance, which allow programmers to manipulate the way data behaves instead of only the contents of a record. Many programmers regard records as obsolete now since object-oriented languages have features that far surpass what records are capable of. On the other hand, many programmers argue that the low overhead and ability to use records in assembly language make records still relevant when programming with low levels of abstraction. Today, the most popular languages on the TIOBE index, an indicator of the popularity of programming languages, have been influenced in some way by records due to the fact that they are object oriented. Query languages such as SQL and Object Query Language were also influenced by the concept of records. These languages allow the programmer to store sets of data, which are essentially records, in tables. This data can then be retrieved using a primary key. The tables themselves are also records which may have a foreign key: a key that references data in another table.   

==Record type==

===Operations===

Operations for a record type include:

* Declaration of a record type, including the position, type, and (possibly) name of each field
* Declaration of a record; a variable typed as a record type
* Construction of a record value; possibly with field value initialization
* Read and write record field value
* Comparison of two records for equality
* Computation of a standard hash value for the record

Some languages provide facilities that enumerate the fields of a record. This facility is needed to implement certain services such as debugging, garbage collection, and serialization. It requires some degree of type polymorphism.

In contexts that support record subtyping, operations include adding and removing fields of a record. A specific record type implies that a specific set of fields are present, but values of that type may contain additional fields. A record with fields &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; would thus belong to the type of records with fields &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, as would a record with fields &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;r&quot;. The rationale is that passing an (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;) record to a function that expects an (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) record as argument should work, since that function will find all the fields it requires within the record. Many ways of practically implementing records in programming languages would have trouble with allowing such variability, but the matter is a central characteristic of record types in more theoretical contexts.

====Assignment and comparison====
Most languages allow assignment between records that have exactly the same record type (including same field types and names, in the same order). Depending on the language, however, two record data types defined separately may be regarded as distinct types even if they have exactly the same fields.

Some languages may also allow assignment between records whose fields have different names, matching each field value with the corresponding field variable by their positions within the record; so that, for example, a complex number with fields called codice_3 and codice_4 can be assigned to a 2D point record variable with fields codice_5 and codice_6. In this alternative, the two operands are still required to have the same sequence of field types. Some languages may also require that corresponding types have the same size and encoding as well, so that the whole record can be assigned as an uninterpreted bit string. Other languages may be more flexible in this regard, and require only that each value field can be legally assigned to the corresponding variable field; so that, for example, a short integer field can be assigned to a long integer field, or vice versa.

Other languages (such as COBOL) may match fields and values by their names, rather than positions.

These same possibilities apply to the comparison of two record values for equality. Some languages may also allow order comparisons (&#x27;&lt;&#x27;and &#x27;&gt;&#x27;), using the lexicographic order based on the comparison of individual fields.

PL/I allows both of the preceding types of assignment, and also allows &quot;structure expressions&quot;, such as codice_7 where &quot;a&quot; is a record, or structure in PL/I terminology.

====Algol 68&#x27;s distributive field selection====
In Algol 68, if codice_8 was an array of records, each with integer fields codice_5 and codice_6, one could write codice_11 to obtain an array of integers, consisting of the codice_6 fields of all the elements of codice_8. As a result, the statements codice_14 and codice_15 would have the same effect.

====Pascal&#x27;s &quot;with&quot; statement====
In Pascal, the command codice_16 would execute the command sequence codice_17 as if all the fields of record codice_18 had been declared as variables. Similarly to entering a different namespace in an object-oriented language like C#, it is no longer necessary to use the record name as a prefix to access the fields. So, instead of writing codice_19 one could write .

===Representation in memory===
The representation of a record in memory varies depending on the programming language. Often, fields are stored in consecutive memory locations, in the same order as they are declared in the record type. This may result in two or more fields stored into the same word of memory; indeed, this feature is often used in systems programming to access specific bits of a word. On the other hand, most compilers will add padding fields, mostly invisible to the programmer, in order to comply with alignment constraints imposed by the machine—say, that a floating point field must occupy a single word.

Some languages may implement a record as an array of addresses pointing to the fields (and, possibly, to their names and/or types). Objects in object-oriented languages are often implemented in rather complicated ways, especially in languages that allow multiple class inheritance.

===Self-defining records===
A &quot;self-defining record&quot; is a type of record which contains information to identify the record type and to locate information within the record. It may contain the offsets of elements; the elements can therefore be stored in any order or may be omitted. The information stored in a self-defining record can be interpreted as metadata for the record, which is similar to what one would expect to find in the UNIX metadata regarding a file, containing information such as the record&#x27;s creation time and the size of the record in bytes. Alternatively, various elements of the record, each including an element identifier, can simply follow one another in any order.

==Key field==

A record, especially in the context of row-based storage, may include key fields that allow indexing the records of a collection. A primary key is unique throughout all stored records; only one of this key exists. In other words, no duplicate may exist for any primary key. For example, an employee file might contain employee number, name, department, and salary. The employee number will be unique in the organization and will be the primary key. Depending on the storage medium and file organization, the employee number might be &quot;indexed&quot;—that is also stored in a separate file to make the lookup faster. The department code is not necessarily unique; it may also be indexed, in which case it would be considered a &quot;secondary key&quot;, or &quot;alternate key&quot;. If it is not indexed, the entire employee file would have to be scanned to produce a listing of all employees in a specific department. Keys are usually chosen in a way that minimizes the chances of multiple values being feasibly mapped to by one key. For example, the salary field would not normally be considered usable as a key since many employees will likely have the same salary.

<text>A witch&#x27;s mark, devil&#x27;s mark or stigma diabolicum was a bodily mark that witch-hunters believed indicated that an individual was a witch, during the height of the witch trials. The beliefs about the mark differed, depending on the trial location and the accusation made against the witch. Use of the term is found earliest in the 16th century, and reaching its peak in 1645, but then essentially disappearing by 1700.

The Witch or Devil&#x27;s mark was believed to be the permanent marking of the Devil on his initiates to seal their obedience and service to him. He is said to create the mark by raking his claw across their flesh, licking the skin to produce a death skull pattern, or using a hot iron to produce a blue or red brand. The Devil was thought to mark the individual at the end of nocturnal initiation rites.

The witch&#x27;s teat was a raised bump somewhere on a witch&#x27;s body. It is often depicted as having a wart-like appearance.

The term &quot;witches&#x27; mark&quot; is also used to describe marks carved into the walls of buildings to protect them and their occupants from evil due to demons, witches or the evil eye.

== Beliefs about the mark on witches ==
The witch&#x27;s teat is associated with the perceived perversion of maternal power by witches in early modern England. The witch&#x27;s teat is associated with the feeding of witches&#x27; imps or familiars; the witch&#x27;s familiar supposedly aided the witch in her magic in exchange for nourishment (blood) from sacrificial animals or from the witch&#x27;s teat. It is also where the devil supposedly suckles when he comes at night to bed his faithful servants, sometimes impregnating them with his seed. Once the devilish half-breed has been conceived, the cambion may only feed upon this teat and no other. Folklore suggests that on the 7th day of the 7th week of consecutive feeding upon the teat, the cambion would grow to adulthood immediately and begin wreaking havoc with a range of demonic powers inherited from its supernatural father. However, should the ritual be disrupted during the 49-day period, the process has to restart all over again.

All witches and sorcerers were believed to have a witch&#x27;s mark waiting to be found. A person accused of witchcraft was brought to trial and carefully scrutinized. The entire body was suspect as a canvas for a mark, an indicator of a pact with Satan. Witch&#x27;s marks were commonly believed to include moles, skin tags, supernumerary nipples, and insensitive patches of skin. Experts, or inquisitors, firmly believed that a witch&#x27;s mark could be easily identified from a natural mark; in light of this belief, protests from the victims that the marks were natural were often ignored.

== Medieval inquisitors ==

Authorities in the witch trials routinely stripped an accused witch of clothing and shaved all body hair so that no potential mark could be hidden. Pins were driven into scars, calluses and thickened areas of skin: the practice of &quot;pricking a witch&quot;. Customarily, this routine was performed in front of a large crowd. Medieval inquisitors also believed that the Devil left invisible marks upon his followers. If after stripping and shaving, the accused witch was found to have no likely blemishes, pins were simply driven into her body until an insensitive area was found. The search for witch&#x27;s marks had disappeared by 1700.

The violence used against accused witches in order to discover the witch&#x27;s mark included torture; &quot;To try to force a confession, priest applied hot fat repeatedly to Catherine Boyraionne&#x27;s eyes and her armpits, the pit of her stomach, her thighs, her elbows, and &#x27;dans sa nature&#x27; – in her vagina. She died in prison, no doubt from injuries.&quot;

During the witch-trials in early modern Europe, individuals were employed to help aid in the discovery and conviction of witches. These individuals were given the title &quot;witch finders&quot;. Perhaps the most famous witchfinder was a man named Matthew Hopkins (c. 1620–1647), who claimed to be the &quot;Witch Finder General&quot;. Hopkins&#x27;s writings reached the height of their popularity during the English Civil War (c. 1645), and contributed to the use of the witch&#x27;s mark as evidence of guilt. The record shows that two Scottish women disguised themselves as men, known as &quot;Mr. Dickson&quot; and &quot;Mr. Peterson&quot;, so they, too, could become witch-finders.

==Historiography==
=== Pagan tattoos theory ===

As far as the historical study of the witch&#x27;s mark goes, historians are split into different camps. The first camp, sometimes called &quot;Murray-ists&quot;, supports British anthropologist Margaret Murray&#x27;s theory of the witch&#x27;s mark. Historical discussion of the witch&#x27;s mark began after the publication of Murray&#x27;s books on the subject: &quot;Witchcult in Western Europe&quot; and &quot;The God of the Witches&quot; in the early 20th century. Her writings argue strongly that Devil&#x27;s marks were in actuality tattoos that identified members of an organized pagan religion that she believed flourished in the Middle Ages. After the publication of her work, the historical community became divided between Murrayist and non-Murrayist scholars: &quot;When the &quot;Witchcult in Western Europe&quot; appeared in 1921, it broke this deadlock; yes, said Murray, witches had indeed been up to something of which society disapproved, but it was in no way supernatural; they were merely members of an underground movement secretly keeping pagan rituals alive in Christian Europe.&quot; Murray&#x27;s work became widely accepted and she was considered an expert in witchcraft studies after its publication. Murray is also credited with the renewed interest in neo-pagan religions, and later, Wicca, which occurred after the publications of her books. However, today her controversial ideas have been largely rejected by scientists and academics due to the lack of any evidence.

=== From a feminist perspective ===
==== Anne Barstow ====
Another camp believes that the witch&#x27;s mark is a gendered aspect of the witch-hunts. In Anne Barstow&#x27;s book, &quot;Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts&quot;, the witch&#x27;s mark is viewed from a feminist perspective. Barstow sees the witch hunts of Europe as an attempt to control women, and the witch&#x27;s mark as an excuse to control women&#x27;s bodies through violence and sadism. The searching of women&#x27;s bodies for the witch&#x27;s mark gives insight into the reality of a woman&#x27;s position during this time: &quot;when &#x27;a personable and good-like woman&#x27; was defended by one of the local gentry the pricker argued that, having been accused, she must be tried anyway&quot;. Barstow views the violent and sexual nature of the witch&#x27;s mark examinations in the witch trials to be further evidence that the witch-hunts were, in fact, &quot;women-hunts&quot;.

==== Deborah Willis: Fear of maternal power theory ====

English Literature professor Deborah Willis, who writes from a feminist perspective, asserts that the witch-hunts resulted from a societal fear of maternal power. Willis argues that the people of early modern Europe all had similar fears about malevolent motherly nurturing, and that the witch&#x27;s teat is a manifestation of that fear. Willis asserts that the witch&#x27;s teat is a perversion of the female power to nourish and strengthen young.

=== Lyme disease theory ===

The witch&#x27;s mark also factors into the theory proposed by M. M. Drymon that Lyme disease is a diagnosis for both witches and witch affliction, finding that many of the afflicted and accused in Salem and elsewhere lived in areas that were tick-risky, had a variety of red marks and rashes that looked like bite marks on their skin, and suffered from neurological and arthritic symptoms. The appearance of the witch&#x27;s mark in Europe is only noted after Columbian contact with the New World in 1492 and may be the result of the transfer of a virulent form of borrelia infection from America into Europe, especially in areas under the control of the Spanish Empire, including parts of the Rhine River Valley that are now in Germany. This topic is the subject of a recent work in the study of witchcraft. This theory is an expansion of the idea first proposed by Laurie Winn Carlson that the bewitched in Salem suffered from encephalitis. Lyme disease is probably the only form of mild or acute encephalitis that is accompanied by a round red mark or bull&#x27;s eye rash on the skin, which can appear after tick attachment.

<text>Five Children and It is a fantasy children&#x27;s novel by English author E. Nesbit. It was originally published in 1902 in the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot; under the general title &quot;The Psammead, or the Gifts&quot;, with a segment appearing each month from April to December. The stories were then expanded into a novel which was published the same year. It is the first volume of a trilogy that includes &quot;The Phoenix and the Carpet&quot; (1904) and &quot;The Story of the Amulet&quot; (1906). The book has never been out of print since its initial publication.

==Plot==
Like Nesbit&#x27;s &quot;The Railway Children&quot;, the story begins when a group of children move from London to the countryside of Kent. The five children (Cyril, Anthea, Robert, Jane, and their baby brother, Hilary, known as &quot;the Lamb&quot;) are playing in a gravel pit when they uncover a rather grumpy, ugly, and occasionally malevolent Psammead, a sand-fairy with the ability to grant wishes. The Psammead persuades the children to take one wish each day to be shared among them, with the caveat that the wishes will turn to stone at sunset. This, apparently, used to be the rule in the Stone Age, when all that children wished for was food, the bones of which then became fossils. The five children&#x27;s first wish is to be &quot;as beautiful as the day.&quot; The wish ends at sunset and its effects simply vanish, leading the Psammead to observe that some wishes are too fanciful to be changed to stone.

All the wishes go comically wrong. The children wish to be beautiful, but the servants do not recognise them and shut them out of the house. They wish to be rich, then find themselves with a gravel-pit full of gold spade guineas that no shop will accept as they are no longer in circulation, so they cannot buy anything. A wish for wings seems to be going well, but at sunset the children find themselves stuck on top of a church bell tower with no way down, getting them into trouble with the gamekeeper who must take them home (though this wish has the happy side-effect of introducing the gamekeeper to the children&#x27;s housemaid, who later marries him). Robert is bullied by the baker&#x27;s boy, then wishes that he was bigger — whereupon he becomes eleven feet tall, and the other children show him at a travelling fair for coins. They also wish themselves into a castle, only to learn that it is being besieged, while a wish to meet real Red Indians ends with the children nearly being scalped.

The children&#x27;s infant brother, the Lamb, is the victim of two wishes gone awry. In one, the children become annoyed with tending to their brother and wish that someone else would want him, leading to a situation where &quot;everyone&quot; wants the baby, and the children must fend off kidnappers and Gypsies. Later, they wish that the baby would grow up faster, causing him to grow all at once into a selfish, smug young man who promptly leaves them all behind.

Finally, the children accidentally wish that they could give a wealthy woman&#x27;s jewellery to their mother, causing all the jewellery to appear in their home. It seems that the gamekeeper, who is now their friend, will be blamed for the robbery, and the children must beg the Psammead for a complex series of wishes to set things right. It agrees, on the condition that they will never ask for any more wishes. Only Anthea, who has grown close to It, makes sure that the final wish is that they will meet It again. The Psammead assures them that this wish will be granted.

==Characters==
===The five children===
* Cyril, known as Squirrel: the eldest sibling, who is brave, diplomatic, and book-smart (very intelligent)
* Anthea, known as Panther: the second eldest, who is kind, sensible, and good-hearted.
* Robert, known as Bobs: the middle child, he is a practical joker with a quick temper.
* Jane, known as Pussy: a generally agreeable little girl with a tendency to be oversensitive, she is sometimes weepy and easily frightened.
* Hilary, the baby, known as the Lamb (because his first word was &quot;baa&quot;). He is too young to walk and has to be carried everywhere.
===The Psammead===

The Psammead is described as having &quot;eyes [that] were on long horns like a snail&#x27;s eyes. It could move them in and out like telescopes; it had ears like a bat&#x27;s ears, and its tubby body was shaped like a spider&#x27;s and covered with thick soft fur; its legs and arms were furry too, and it had hands and feet like a monkey&#x27;s&quot; and whiskers like a rat&#x27;s. When it grants wishes it stretches out its eyes, holds its breath and swells alarmingly.

The five children find the Psammead in a gravel pit, which used to be seashore. There were once many Psammeads, but the others died when they got wet and caught cold. It is the last of its kind. It is thousands of years old, and remembers pterodactyls and other ancient creatures. When the Psammeads were around they granted wishes that were then mostly for food. The wished-for objects turned into stone at sunset if they were not used that day, but this does not apply to the children&#x27;s wishes because what they wish for is so much more fantastic than the wishes the Psammead granted in the past. 

The word &quot;Psammead&quot;, pronounced &quot;sammyadd&quot; by the children in the story, appears to be a coinage by Nesbit from the Greek ψάμμος &quot;sand&quot; after the pattern of dryad, naiad and oread, implicitly signifying &quot;sand-nymph&quot;. However, its hideous appearance is unlike traditional Greek nymphs, who generally resemble beautiful maidens.

==Sequels==
===By Nesbit===
The book&#x27;s ending was clearly intended to leave readers in suspense:
&quot;They did see it [the Psammead] again, of course, but not in this story. And it was not in a sand-pit either, but in a very, very, very different place. It was in a – But I must say no more.&quot;
The children reappear in &quot;The Phoenix and the Carpet&quot; (1904) and &quot;The Story of the Amulet&quot; (1906). The Psammead is offstage in the first of these sequels (it is simply mentioned by the Phoenix, who visits it three times to ask for a helpful wish when the situation becomes difficult), but it plays a significant role in the second sequel after the children rescue it from a pet shop. 
An omnibus edition of the three books titled &quot;Five Children&quot; was published in 1930. The trilogy is also known as the &quot;Psammead&quot; series.
===By other authors===
&quot;The Return of the Psammead&quot; (1992) by Helen Cresswell concerns another family of Edwardian children who discover the Psammead.

&quot;Four Children and It&quot; (2012) by Jacqueline Wilson is a contemporary retelling of the story in which four children from a modern stepfamily encounter the Psammead. One of the children has read the original book and wishes to meet Cyril, Anthea, Jane and Robert.

In &quot;Five Children on the Western Front&quot; (2014) by Kate Saunders, set nine years after the original story, the children encounter the horrors of the First World War.

==Adaptations==

===Television===
* In 1985–86 NHK broadcast a Japanese anime version, &quot;Onegai! Samia-don&quot;. 78 episodes were produced by animation studio TMS. No English dubbed version was ever produced, but it came out in other languages.
* There have been two adaptations on British television of the novel, both by the BBC. In 1951 a basic two part production was dramatised by Dorothea Brooking. This was only shown in the South of England and Midlands. A more lavish production was made in 1991 when the BBC turned the story into a six-part television series. It was released in the UK under the story&#x27;s original title. In the USA it was released as &quot;The Sand Fairy&quot;. This was followed by &quot;The Return of the Psammead&quot; in 1993, where the Psammead alone linkied the two series. Both series were scripted by Helen Cresswell, and Francis Wright puppeteered and voiced the Psammead.
* In 2018, as &quot;The Psammy Show&quot;, an animated series co-produced by DQ Entertainment, Method Animation and Disney Germany. This envisioned the title character as a green dog-like creature.

===Film===
* In 2004 a film version was released, starring Freddie Highmore, Tara FitzGerald, Jonathan Bailey, Zoë Wanamaker and Kenneth Branagh, with Eddie Izzard as the voice of the Psammead.

===Theatre===
*A stage musical adaptation by Timothy Knapman (book) and Philip Godfrey (music/lyrics) was completed in 2016.
* In 2022, it was adapted into another musical by playwright Rita Cheung Baird.
===Comics===
* It was also adapted as a comic strip by Henry Seabright.

==Works inspired by==
A wizard named Psamathos Psamathide, described as a &quot;Psamathist&quot; (expert in sand) appears in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Roverandom&quot;. The character, in an early draft, originally belonged to an order of &quot;Psammeads&quot;.

<doc id="492315" wikidata="Q974247" url="?curid=492315" title="Budweiser Rocket">
<text>The Budweiser Rocket is an American 3-wheeled land vehicle, generally resembling the 1970-era &quot;Blue Flame&quot; land speed record holding vehicle in appearance, powered by a liquid rocket engine with an extra solid-fuel booster from a Sidewinder missile, that has been claimed as being the first vehicle to have broken the sound barrier on land. The original forerunner to the vehicle was the &quot;SMI Motivator&quot; which was damaged badly enough to require a replacement, which in time was called the &quot;Budweiser Rocket&quot;.

The vehicle, like its predecessor, was owned by film director Hal Needham, driven by Stan Barrett and designed and built by William Fredrick (Died in 2020). Neither the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme nor the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile, the official speed record certifying bodies, recognise the record attempt, the speed purported to have been reached or that the vehicle ever attained supersonic speeds. The original Budweiser Rocket was donated to the Smithsonian Institution and a modified version with a narrower track, is in the Talladega Superspeedway Museum, Alabama. The original is no longer on display and is now in storage at the Smithsonian Institution Archives, Record Unit 360, National Museum of American History, Office of Public Affairs and Records.

==Controversy==
The first run of the car at Bonneville Salt Flats showed that the propulsion system was unable to develop enough thrust to sustain a speed high enough to establish a new official World Land Speed Record. The team decided then that their goal would be to exceed the speed of sound on land, if only briefly, although no official authority would recognize this achievement as a record. The speed of sound is a function of the air temperature and pressure. In other words, the sound barrier is not an absolute speed value, but dependent on air conditions. The speed of sound during Barrett&#x27;s speed run was .

The claim of breaking the sound barrier on land was made on December 17, 1979 after a run on Rogers Dry Lake at Edwards AFB. While it has been claimed that the Budweiser Rocket did briefly break the sound barrier, it could not gain any official titles because standard ground speed record regulations measure an average speed over a measured distance (either one kilometer or one mile (1.6 km), depending on the particular sanctioning body&#x27;s rules). The measurement of the vehicle&#x27;s top speed during the run has been disputed primarily because of the methods used to calculate the speed, and its extremely small margin of success.

No independent authority sanctioned the performance, although United States Air Force radar tracked the vehicle and recorded the azimuth, elevation, timing, and range data from which a top speed solution was calculated. This, along with the on-board accelerometer data was used to produce the estimated top speed of 739.666 miles per hour, or Mach 1.01. This data, however, has never been publicly released.

Witnesses dispute whether a sonic boom was heard. At least one reported hearing the boom. It is claimed that no-one heard the boom because of the short distance between the observers and the deafening sonic waves from the combined liquid and solid-fuel rockets used to propel the vehicle. Standing shock waves in the rocket exhaust produce continuous supersonic shock waves (a continuous &quot;sonic boom&quot;). The auditory dynamics of two roaring rocket exhausts, combined with the pounding physical effects of such intense sound waves over the short distance to the observers, made it questionable whether close observers could have differentiated the vehicle&#x27;s sonic boom from the general cacophony of background noise. No boom was heard at greater distances either, in marked contrast to the runs of ThrustSSC, which generated extensive and well attested sonic booms over a wide area and a clearly visible shockwave.

Despite an unauthorized written speed certification by the United States Air Force, there is much debate over the validity of the claim. The Air Force states it &quot;never intended to give official sanction to test results, nor to give the appearance of expressing an official view as to the speed attained by the test vehicle. Any such opinion was that of individual Air Force personnel, not of the Air Force&quot;. None of the land speed record sanctioning groups was present for the run, nor was the run duplicated within any particular time frame as required by most sanctioning bodies for official recognition of a new land speed record. No accurate measurement was taken of the car&#x27;s speed, which was announced as having been calculated from radar tracking data along with accelerometer data which has not been made public. As a result, the Budweiser Rocket Car is not officially considered as the first vehicle to have broken the sound barrier on land, and few people believe the car to have actually done so. The British Thrust SSC is officially recognized by the FIA as breaking the land speed record — and the sound barrier as well — in 1997, with an average speed of 763.035 mph (1227.99 km/h) on a measured mile in both directions.

<doc id="492321" wikidata="Q5153657" url="?curid=492321" title="Commonplace book">
<text>Commonplace books (or commonplaces) are a way to compile knowledge, usually by writing information into books. They have been kept from antiquity, and were kept particularly during the Renaissance and in the nineteenth century. Such books are similar to scrapbooks filled with items of many kinds: notes, proverbs, adages, aphorisms, maxims, quotes, letters, poems, tables of weights and measures, prayers, legal formulas, and recipes.

Entries are most often organized under systematic subject headings and differ functionally from journals or diaries, which are chronological and introspective.

==Overview==
&quot;Commonplace&quot; is a translation of the Latin term &quot;locus communis&quot; (from Greek &quot;tópos koinós&quot;, see literary topos) which means &quot;a general or common place&quot;, such as a statement of proverbial wisdom. In this original sense, commonplace books were collections of such sayings, such as John Milton&#x27;s example. &quot;Commonplace book&quot; is at times used with an expansive sense, referring to collections by an individual in one volume which have a common theme (e.g. ethics) or explores several themes. The term overlaps with aspects of the terms &quot;anthology&quot; or &quot;mixed-manuscript&quot; in these productions but most properly refers to a collection of sayings or excerpts by an individual, often collected under thematic headings.

Commonplaces are a separate genre of writing from diaries or travelogues. Commonplaces are used by readers, writers, students, and scholars as an aid for remembering useful concepts or facts; sometimes they were required of young women as evidence of their mastery of social roles and as demonstrations of the correctness of their upbringing. They became significant in Early Modern Europe. As a genre, commonplace books were generally private collections of information, but as the amount of information grew following the invention of movable type and printing became less expensive, some were published for the general public.

In 1685 the English Enlightenment philosopher John Locke wrote a treatise in French on commonplace books, translated into English in 1706 as &quot;A New Method of Making Common-Place-Books&quot;, &quot;in which techniques for entering proverbs, quotations, ideas, speeches were formulated. Locke gave specific advice on how to arrange material by subject and category, using such key topics as love, politics, or religion. Following the publication of his work, publishers often printed empty commonplace books with space for headings and indices to be filled in by their users. An example is &quot;Bell&#x27;s Common-Place Book, Formed generally upon the Principles Recommended and Practised by Mr Locke&quot; which was published by John Bell almost a century after Locke&#x27;s treatise. A copy of this blank commonplace was used by Erasmus Darwin from 1776 to 1787, and it was later used by Charles Darwin who called it &quot;the great book&quot; when composing his grandfather&#x27;s biography.

By the early eighteenth century, they had become an information management device in which a note-taker stored quotations, observations, and definitions. They were used in private households to collate ethical or informative texts, sometimes alongside recipes or medical formulae. For women, who were excluded from formal higher education, the commonplace book could be a repository of intellectual references. The gentlewoman Elizabeth Lyttelton kept one from the 1670s to 1713 and a typical example was published by Mrs Anna Jameson in 1855, including headings such as &quot;Ethical Fragments&quot;; &quot;Theological&quot;; &quot;Literature&quot; and &quot;Art&quot;.

Commonplace books were used by scientists and other thinkers in the same way that a database might now be used: Carl Linnaeus, for instance, used commonplacing techniques to invent and arrange the nomenclature of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; (which is the basis for the system used by scientists today).

The commonplace system of categorized note-keeping was not restricted to books. In the twentieth century, Henri de Lubac traveled with his notes in a sack. Erasmus of Rotterdam traveled with a chest of notes, including examples of well-written Latin that formed the basis of his &quot;Adagia&quot;. In &quot;De Copia&quot; his &quot;Method of Collecting Examples&quot; (&quot;Ratio collegendi exampla&quot;) advocated a hierarchical but &quot;ad hoc&quot; breakdown of topics: for example, the top-level might be &quot;Piety&quot; and &quot;Impiety&quot;, under Piety might come &quot;Gratitude&quot;, and under these headings one puts example texts. The commonplace proper would be some simple aphorism or moral, possibly several, that can be drawn from the example, such as &quot;The crowd loves and hates thoughtlessly.&quot;

As a result of the development of information technology, there exist various software applications that perform the functions that paper-based commonplace books served for previous generations of thinkers.

==History==
=== Philosophical origins ===
Beginning in &quot;Topica&quot;, Aristotle distinguished between forms of argumentation and referred to them as commonplaces. He extended the idea in &quot;Rhetoric&quot; where he suggested that they also be used to explore the validity of propositions through rhetoric. Cicero in his own &quot;Topica&quot; and &quot;De Oratore&quot; further clarified the idea of commonplaces and applied them to public speaking. He also created a list of commonplaces which included sententiae or wise sayings or quotations by philosophers, statesmen, and poets. Quintilian further expanded these ideas in &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot;, a treatise on rhetoric education, and asked his readers to commit their commonplaces to memory. He also framed these commonplaces in moral and ethical overtones.

While there are ancient compilations by writers including Pliny and Diogenes Laertius, many authors in the Renaissance credited Aulus Gellius as the founder of the genre with his commonplace &quot;Attic Nights&quot;.

In the first century AD, Seneca the Younger suggested that readers collect commonplace ideas and sententiae as a bee collects pollen, and by imitation turn them into their own honey-like words. By late antiquity, the idea of employing commonplaces in rhetorical settings was well established.

Stobaeus, a writer usually placed in the fifth century, compiled an extensive two volume manuscript commonly known as &quot;The Anthologies&quot;, containing excerpts from 1,430 works of poetry and prose; all but 315 of these works are lost except for Stobaeus&#x27;s quotations.

In the sixth century Boethius had translated both Aristotle and Cicero&#x27;s work and created his own account of commonplaces in &quot;De topicis differentiis&quot;.

=== Florilegium ===

By the eighth century, the idea of commonplaces was used, primarily in religious contexts, by preachers and theologians, to collect excerpted passages from the Bible or from approved Church Fathers. Early in this time period passages were collected and arranged in the order of their appearance in the works from which they were taken, but by the thirteenth century they were more commonly arranged under thematic headings. These religious anthologies were referred to as &quot;florilegia&quot; which translates as &quot;gatherings of flowers&quot;. Often these collections were used by their creators to compose sermons.

=== Early examples ===
Precursors to the commonplace book were the records kept by Roman and Greek philosophers of their thoughts and daily meditations, often including quotations from other thinkers. The practice of keeping a journal such as this was particularly recommended by Stoics such as Seneca and Marcus Aurelius, whose own work Meditations (second century AD) was originally a private record of thoughts and quotations. &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; of Sei Shonagon, a courtier of the tenth or eleventh-century Japan is likewise a private book of anecdote and poetry, daily thoughts and lists. However, none of these include the wider range of sources usually associated with commonplace books.

A number of renaissance scholars kept something resembling a commonplace book – for example Leonardo da Vinci, who described his notebook exactly as a commonplace book is structured: &quot;A collection without order, drawn from many papers, which I have copied here, hoping to arrange them later each in its place, according to the subjects of which they treat.&quot; French encyclopediast Jean Bodin used the commonplace book as &quot;an arsenal of &#x27;factoids&#x27;.&quot;

===Zibaldone===

During the course of the fifteenth century, the Italian peninsula was the site of the development of two new forms of book production: the deluxe registry book and the zibaldone (or hodgepodge book). What differentiated these two forms was their language of composition: a vernacular. Giovanni Rucellai, the compiler of one of the most sophisticated examples of the genre, defined it as a &quot;salad of many herbs&quot;.

Zibaldone were always paper codices of small or medium format – never the large desk copies of registry books or other display texts. They also lacked the lining and extensive ornamentation of other deluxe copies. Rather than miniatures, a zibaldone often incorporates the author&#x27;s sketches. Zibaldone were in cursive scripts (first chancery minuscule and later mercantile minuscule) and contained what palaeographer Armando Petrucci describes as &quot;an astonishing variety of poetic and prose texts&quot;. Devotional, technical, documentary, and literary texts appear side by side in no discernible order. The juxtaposition of taxes paid, currency exchange rates, medicinal remedies, recipes, and favourite quotations from Augustine and Virgil portrays a developing secular, literate culture.

By far the most popular literary selections were the works of Dante Alighieri, Francesco Petrarca, and Giovanni Boccaccio: the &quot;Three Crowns&quot; of the Florentine vernacular traditions. These collections have been used by modern scholars as a source for interpreting how merchants and artisans interacted with the literature and visual arts of the Florentine Renaissance.

The best-known zibaldone is Giacomo Leopardi&#x27;s nineteenth-century &quot;Zibaldone di pensieri&quot;, however, it significantly departs from the early modern genre of commonplace books and is rather comparable to the intellectual diary which was practiced, for example, by Lichtenberg, Joubert, Coleridge, Valery, among others.

===English===
By the seventeenth century, commonplacing had become a recognized practice that was formally taught to college students in such institutions as Oxford. John Locke appended his indexing scheme for commonplace books to a printing of his &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;. The commonplace tradition in which Francis Bacon and John Milton were educated had its roots in the pedagogy of classical rhetoric, and &quot;commonplacing&quot; persisted as a popular study technique until the early twentieth century. Commonplace books were used by many key thinkers of the Enlightenment, with authors like the philosopher and theologian William Paley using them to write books. Both Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau were taught to keep commonplace books at Harvard University (their commonplace books survive in published form).

However, it was also a domestic and private practice that was particularly attractive to authors. Some, such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Mark Twain, and Virginia Woolf kept messy reading notes that were intermixed with other quite various material; others, such as Thomas Hardy, followed a more formal reading-notes method that mirrored the original Renaissance practice more closely. The older, &quot;clearinghouse&quot; function of the commonplace book, to condense and centralize useful and even &quot;model&quot; ideas and expressions, became less popular over time.

* Amos Bronson Alcott, 1877: &quot;The habit of journalizing becomes a life-long lesson in the art of composition, an informal schooling for authorship. And were the process of preparing their works for publication faithfully detailed by distinguished writers, it would appear how large were their indebtedness to their diary and commonplaces. How carefully should we peruse Shakespeare&#x27;s notes used in compiling his plays—what was his, what another&#x27;s—showing how these were fashioned into the shapely whole we read, how Milton composed, Montaigne, Goethe: by what happy strokes of thought, flashes of wit, apt figures, fit quotations snatched from vast fields of learning, their rich pages were wrought forth! This were to give the keys of great authorship!&quot;
* In Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes stories, Holmes keeps numerous commonplace books, which he sometimes uses when doing research. For example, in &quot;The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger&quot;, he researches the newspaper reports of an old murder in a commonplace book.
* In Alan Moore&#x27;s graphic novel Providence, the protagonist Robert Black keeps a commonplace book; his entries into this book make up the second halves of the novel&#x27;s chapters, contrasting with the graphic sections.
* In Lemony Snicket&#x27;s &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; a number of characters including Klaus Baudelaire and the Quagmire triplets keep commonplace books.
* In Michael Ondaatje&#x27;s &quot;The English Patient&quot;, Count Almásy uses his copy of Herodotus&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot; as a commonplace book.
* Virginia Woolf, mid-twentieth century: &quot;[L]et us take down one of those old notebooks which we have all, at one time or another, had a passion for beginning. Most of the pages are blank, it is true; but at the beginning we shall find a certain number very beautifully covered with a strikingly legible hand-writing. Here we have written down the names of great writers in their order of merit; here we have copied out fine passages from the classics; here are lists of books to be read; and here, most interesting of all, lists of books that have actually been read, as the reader testifies with some youthful vanity by a dash of red ink.&quot;

<doc id="492328" wikidata="Q267685" url="?curid=492328" title="Butterfly McQueen">
<text>Butterfly McQueen (born Thelma McQueen; January 8, 1911December 22, 1995) was an American actress. Originally a dancer, McQueen first appeared in films as Prissy in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939). She also appeared in the films &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot; (1943), &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (1944), and &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946).

Often typecast as a maid, she said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t mind playing a maid the first time, because I thought that was how you got into the business. But after I did the same thing over and over, I resented it. I didn&#x27;t mind being funny, but I didn&#x27;t like being stupid.&quot; She continued as an actress in film in the 1940s, and then moved to television acting in the 1950s. She won a 1980 Daytime Emmy Award for her performance in the &quot;ABC Afterschool Special&quot; episode &quot;Seven Wishes of a Rich Kid&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born January 8, 1911, in Tampa, Florida, Thelma McQueen was the daughter of Wallace McQueen, a stevedore/dockworker, and Mary McQueen, who worked as a maid. After her parents separated, Thelma lived with her mother in Augusta, Georgia, where she was educated by nuns at a convent. She had planned to become a nurse until a high-school teacher suggested that she try acting. McQueen initially studied with Janet Collins and danced with the Venezuela Jones Negro Youth Group. Around this time she acquired the nickname &quot;Butterfly&quot; – a tribute to her constantly moving hands – for her performance of the Butterfly Ballet in a production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Disliking her birth name, she later legally changed it to Butterfly McQueen. She performed with the dance troupe of Katherine Dunham before making her professional debut in George Abbott&#x27;s &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;.

==Career==

McQueen was appearing as a student in the Broadway comedy &quot;What a Life&quot; in 1938 when she was spotted by Kay Brown, talent scout for David O. Selznick, then in pre-production for &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; (eventually released in 1939). Brown recommended that McQueen audition for the film. After Selznick saw her screen test, he never considered anyone else and McQueen was cast in the role that would become her most identifiable – &quot;Prissy&quot;, a simple-minded house maid. She uttered the famous words: &quot;Oh, Miss Scarlett! I don&#x27;t know nothin&#x27; &#x27;bout birthin&#x27; babies!&quot; Her distinctive, high-pitched voice was described by a critic as &quot;the itsy-little voice fading over the far horizon of comprehension&quot;. While the role is well known to audiences, McQueen did not enjoy playing the part and felt it was demeaning to African-Americans. She was unable to attend the film&#x27;s premiere because it was held at a whites-only theater.

She had an uncredited bit part as a sales assistant in &quot;The Women&quot; (1939), filmed after &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; but released before it. She also played Butterfly, Rochester&#x27;s niece and Mary Livingstone&#x27;s maid, in Jack Benny&#x27;s radio program in the 1940s. She appeared in an uncredited role in &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (1945) and played a supporting role in &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946). By 1947, she had grown tired of the ethnic stereotypes she was required to play and ended her film career. During World War II, McQueen frequently appeared as a comedian on the Armed Forces Radio Service broadcast &quot;Jubilee&quot;. Many of these broadcasts are available on the Internet Archive.

From 1950 until 1952, she was featured (and briefly reunited with fellow &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; actor Hattie McDaniel, who appeared in the first six episodes before withdrawing due to illness) in another racially stereotyped role on the television series &quot;Beulah&quot;, in which she played Beulah&#x27;s friend Oriole, a character originated on radio by Ruby Dandridge, who took over the TV role from McQueen in 1952–53. In 1964 she starred alongside Marion Marlowe in the Off-Broadway commercial flop, The Athenian Touch. In a lighter moment, she appeared in a 1969 episode of &quot;The Dating Game&quot;.

McQueen was in the original version of the stage musical &quot;The Wiz&quot; when it debuted in Baltimore, Maryland in 1974. She played the Queen of the Field Mice, a character from the original L. Frank Baum novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. However, when the show was revised prior to going to Broadway, McQueen&#x27;s role was cut by incoming director Geoffrey Holder.

Offers for acting roles began to dry up around this time, and she devoted herself to other pursuits including political study. She received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from City College of New York in 1975. McQueen played the character of Aunt Thelma, a fairy godmother, in the &quot;ABC Weekend Special&quot; episode &quot;The Seven Wishes of Joanna Peabody&quot; (1978) and the &quot;ABC Afterschool Special&quot; episode &quot;Seven Wishes of a Rich Kid&quot; (1979); her performance in the latter earned her a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Children&#x27;s Programming.

Her final feature film role was in &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; (1986). Her final appearance was in the TV movie &quot;Polly&quot;, a reimagining of the &quot;Pollyanna&quot; story with a Black cast.

==Personal life==
McQueen neither married nor had children. She lived in New York in the summer months and in Augusta, Georgia, during the winter.

A Democrat, she supported Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s campaign during the 1952 presidential election.

In 1975, aged 64, McQueen received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from City College of New York.

In July 1983, a jury awarded McQueen $60,000 in a judgment stemming from a lawsuit she filed against two bus terminal security guards. McQueen sued for harassment after she claimed the security guards accused her of being a pickpocket and a vagrant while she was at a Washington, D.C. Greyhound bus terminal in April 1979.

=== Atheism ===
In 1989, the Freedom From Religion Foundation honored her with its Freethought Heroine Award. &quot;I&#x27;m an atheist,&quot; she had declared, &quot;and Christianity appears to me to be the most absurd imposture of all the religions, and I&#x27;m puzzled that so many people can&#x27;t see through a religion that encourages irresponsibility and bigotry.&quot;

She told a reporter, &quot;As my ancestors are free from slavery, I am free from the slavery of religion.&quot; This quote was used by the Freedom From Religion Foundation in advertisements inside Madison, Wisconsin, buses in 2009 and in an Atlanta market in 2010.

She lamented that, if humans had focused on Earth and on people, rather than on mythology and on Jesus, there would be less hunger and homelessness. &quot;They say the streets are going to be beautiful in Heaven. Well, I&#x27;m trying to make the streets beautiful here ... When it&#x27;s clean and beautiful, I think America is heaven. And some people are hell.&quot;

==Death==
McQueen died at age 84 on December 22, 1995, at Doctors Hospital in Augusta, from burns sustained when a kerosene heater she attempted to light malfunctioned and burst into flames. McQueen donated her body to medical science and remembered the Freedom From Religion Foundation in her will.

<doc id="492331" wikidata="Q204333" url="?curid=492331" title="Arab citizens of Israel">
<text>The Arab citizens of Israel form the country&#x27;s largest ethnic minority. Their community mainly consists of former Mandatory Palestine citizens (and their descendants) who continued to inhabit the territory that was acknowledged as Israeli by the 1949 Armistice Agreements. Notions of identity among Israel&#x27;s Arab citizens are complex, encompassing civic, religious, and ethnic components. Some sources report that the majority of Arabs in Israel prefer to be identified as Palestinian citizens of Israel, while recent surveys indicate that most name &quot;Israeli&quot;, &quot;Israeli-Arab&quot;, or &quot;Arab&quot; as the most important components of their identity, reflecting a shift of &quot;Israelization&quot; among the community. 
In the wake of the 1948 Palestine war, the Israeli government conferred Israeli citizenship upon all Palestinians who had remained or were not expelled. However, they were subject to discrimination by being placed under martial law until 1966, while other Israeli citizens were not. In the early 1980s, Israel granted citizenship eligibility to the Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the Syrian citizens of the Golan Heights by annexing both areas, though they remain internationally recognized as part of the Israeli-occupied territories, which came into being after the Six-Day War of 1967. Acquisition of Israeli citizenship in East Jerusalem has been scarce, as only 5% of Palestinians in East Jerusalem were Israeli citizens in 2022, largely due to Palestinian society&#x27;s disapproval of naturalization as complicity with the occupation. 
According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, the Israeli Arab population stood at 2.1 million people in 2023, accounting for 21% of Israel&#x27;s total population. The majority of these Arab citizens identify themselves as Arab or Palestinian by nationality and as Israeli by citizenship. They mostly live in Arab-majority towns and cities, some of which are among the poorest in the country, and generally attend schools that are separated to some degree from those attended by Jewish Israelis. Arab political parties traditionally did not join governing coalitions until 2021, when the United Arab List became the first to do so. The Druze and the Bedouin in the Negev and the Galilee have historically expressed the strongest non-Jewish affinity to Israel and are more likely to identify as Israelis than other Arab citizens.
Speakers of both Arabic and Hebrew, their traditional vernacular is mostly Levantine Arabic, including Lebanese Arabic in northern Israel, Palestinian Arabic in central Israel, and Bedouin Arabic across the Negev. Because the modern Arabic dialects of Israel&#x27;s Arabs have absorbed many Hebrew loanwords and phrases, it is sometimes called the Israeli Arabic dialect. By religious affiliation, the majority of Arab Israelis are Muslims, but there are significant Christian and Druze minorities, among others. Arab citizens of Israel have a wide variety of self-identification: as Israeli or &quot;in Israel&quot;; as Arabs, Palestinians, or Israelis; and as Muslims, Christians or Druze.

==Terminology and identity==

The choice of terms to refer to Arab citizens of Israel is a highly politicized issue, and there is a broad range of labels that members of this community use to self-identity. Generally speaking, supporters of Israel tend to use &quot;Israeli Arab&quot; or &quot;Arab Israeli&quot; to refer to this population without mentioning Palestine, while critics of Israel (or supporters of Palestinians) tend to use &quot;Palestinian&quot; or &quot;Palestinian Arab&quot; without referencing Israel. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, most preferred to identify themselves as Palestinian citizens of Israel rather than as Israeli Arabs, as of 2012. &quot;The New York Times&quot; uses both &#x27;Palestinian Israelis&#x27; and &#x27;Israeli Arabs&#x27; to refer to the same population.

The relationship of Arab citizens to the State of Israel is often fraught with tension and can be regarded in the context of relations between minority populations and state authorities elsewhere in the world. Arab citizens consider themselves to be an indigenous people. The tension between their Palestinian Arab national identity and their identity as citizens of Israel was famously described by an Arab public figure as: &quot;My state is at war with my nation&quot;.

===List of demonyms===
Arab/Palestinian citizens of Israel may refer to themselves by a wide range of terms. Each of these names, while referring to the same group of people, connotes a different balance in what is often a multilayered identity assigning varying levels of priority or emphasis to the various dimensions which may be historic-geographic (&quot;Palestine (region)&quot;), &quot;national&quot; or ethnoreligious (Palestinian, Arab, Israeli, Druze, Circassian), linguistic (Arabic-speaking), civic (feeling &quot;Israeli&quot; or not), etc.:
* Palestinian citizens of Israel is a term that most Arab citizens of Israel prefer to refer to themselves, and which some media (BBC, &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;Washington Post&quot;, NBC News) and other organizations use to refer to Israeli Arabs, either consistently or alternating the use of other terms for Israeli Arabs.
* Palestinian Arabs
* Palestinian Arabs in Israel
* Palestinian Israelis
* Palestinians in Israel
* Israeli Arabs
* Israeli Palestinian Arabs
* Israeli Palestinians
* Arab citizens of Israel
* Arab Israelis
* 48ers, &#x27;48 Arabs

Two appellations, among others listed above, are not applied to the East Jerusalem Arab population or the Druze in the Golan Heights, as these territories were occupied by Israel in 1967:
* &quot;the Arabs inside the Green Line&quot;
* &quot;the Arabs within&quot; ().

===Demonym preferences===
According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, as of 2012, most Israeli Arabs preferred to identify themselves as Palestinian citizens of Israel rather than as Israeli Arabs. The &quot;Council on Foreign Relations&quot; also states that most members of the Israeli Arab community prefer this term. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; asserted in 2021 that &quot;surveys showed&quot; that Israeli Arabs preferred the term &quot;Palestinian citizen of Israel&quot; and that &quot;for people who often feel caught between two worlds, however, the contours of what it means to be a Palestinian citizen of Israel remain a work in progress.&quot; However, these findings conflict with a 2017 Tel Aviv University poll which showed most Israelis self-identify as either Arab-Israeli or simply Israeli.

Similar terms that Israeli Arabs, media and other organizations may use are &quot;Palestinian Arabs in Israel&quot; and &quot;Israeli Palestinian Arabs&quot;. Amnesty reports that &quot;Arab citizens of Israel&quot; is &quot;an inclusive term used by Israel that describes a number of different and primarily Arabic-speaking groups, including Muslim Arabs&quot;, Christian Arabs, Druze and Circassians. They further stated that &quot;considering the number of those defined as Muslim Arabs and Christian Arabs together, the population of Palestinian citizens of Israel amounted to around 1.8 million&quot; in 2019.

There are at least two terms which specifically exclude the East Jerusalem Arab population and the Druze and other Arabs in the Golan Heights: &quot;the Arabs inside the Green Line&quot;, and &quot;the Arabs within&quot; (). These terms clarify that
* Although Israel annexed East Jerusalem in 1967, the vast majority of its Arab population does not have Israeli citizenship
* Although Israel annexed the Golan Heights, that area was originally part of Syria, not Mandatory Palestine.

====Identification as Palestinian====
While known officially by the Israeli government only as &quot;Israeli Arabs&quot; or &quot;Arab Israelis&quot;, the development of Palestinian nationalism and identity in the 20th and 21st centuries has been met by a marked evolution in self-identification, reflecting a rising identification with Palestinian identity alongside Arab and Israeli signifiers. Many Palestinian citizens of Israel have family ties to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as well as to Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.

Between 1948 and 1967, very few Arab citizens of Israel identified openly as &quot;Palestinian&quot;, and an &quot;Israeli-Arab&quot; identity, the preferred phrase of the Israeli establishment and public, was predominant. Public expressions of Palestinian identity, such as displays of the Palestinian flag or the singing and reciting of nationalist songs or poetry were illegal. With the end of military administrative rule in 1966 and following the 1967 war, national consciousness and its expression among Israel&#x27;s Arab citizens spread. A majority then self-identified as Palestinian, preferring this descriptor to Israeli Arab in numerous surveys over the years. In a 2017 telephone poll, 40% of Arab citizens of Israel identified as &quot;Arab in Israel / Arab citizen of Israel&quot;, 15% identified as &quot;Palestinian&quot;, 8.9% as &quot;Palestinian in Israel / Palestinian citizen of Israel&quot;, and 8.7% as &quot;Arab&quot;; the focus groups associated with the poll provided a different outcome, in which &quot;there was consensus that Palestinian identity occupies a central place in their consciousness&quot;. A November 2023 poll asked respondents from this demographic what the most important &quot;component in their personal identity&quot; was to them; 33 percent answered &quot;Israeli citizenship&quot;, 32 percent &quot;Arab identity&quot;, 23 percent &quot;religious affiliation&quot;, and 8 percent &quot;Palestinian identity&quot;.

University of Haifa professor Sammy Smooha commented in 2019, &quot;The largest now and the most growing identity is a hybrid identity, which is &#x27;Palestinian in Israel&#x27; or a similar combination. I think that’s what’s going to take over.&quot;

=====Distinction of Druze and Circassian citizens=====
In the Amnesty International 2022 report &quot;Israel&#x27;s Apartheid against Palestinians: Cruel System of Domination and Crime against Humanity&quot;, the organization excludes the Israeli Arab Druze and non-Arab Circassians from the term Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel:
* The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially classifies the roughly 2.1 million Palestinian citizens of Israel as &quot;Arab citizens of Israel&quot;, reflecting their attributing a racialized non-Jewish, Arab status to all of them
* The term &quot;Arab citizens of Israel&quot; includes Muslim Arabs including Bedouins, Christian Arabs, the 20–25,000 Druze, and even the 4–5,000 Circassians, whose origins are in the Caucasus but are mostly Muslim.
* According to Amnesty, the Israeli state views and treats Palestinian citizens of Israel differently from the Druze and Circassians, who must for example serve in the army while Palestinian citizens need not serve.
* Nonetheless, Israeli authorities and media refer to those who self-identify as Palestinians – as &quot;Israeli Arabs&quot;.

The &quot;Washington Post&quot; included the Druze among the Palestinians. The Council of Foreign Relations stated:&quot;The majority of Arab citizens are Sunni Muslims, though there are many Christians and also Druze, who more often embrace Israeli identity.&quot;

====Identification as Arab Israeli====
The question of Palestinian identity extends to representation in the Israeli Knesset. Journalist Ruth Margalit says of Mansour Abbas of the United Arab List, a member of the governing coalition, &quot;The traditional term for this group, Arab Israelis, is increasingly controversial, but it&#x27;s the one that Abbas prefers.&quot; Abbas gave an interview to Israeli media in November 2021 and said &quot;My rights don&#x27;t just come from my citizenship. My rights also come from being a member of the Palestinian people, a son of this Palestinian homeland. And whether we like it or not, the State of Israel, with its identity, was established inside the Palestinian homeland,&quot; Sami Abu Shehadeh of Balad is &quot;an outspoken advocate of Palestinian identity&quot;. He says, referring to the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, &quot;... If the past weeks provided lessons for the international community, then a main one is that they cannot continue to ignore the Palestinian citizens of Israel. Any solution should include full equality for all citizens as well as the respect and recognition of our rights as a national minority.&quot;

Some media using the term &quot;Palestinian citizens of Israel&quot; or &quot;Palestinians in Israel&quot; have treated the terms as interchangeable with &quot;Arab citizens of Israel&quot; or &quot;Israeli Arabs&quot;, and have not discussed whether Druze and Circassians are exceptions. such as the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

===Israeli surveys===
Surveys of Arab-Israeli self-identification are diverse, and have often presented differing if not contradictory results. In 2017 the Konrad Adenauer Foundation&#x27;s Program for Jewish-Arab Cooperation at the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University conducted a telephone poll, in which the results were:
* National identity with Israeli civil component 49.7%, of which
** Palestinian (citizen) of Israel 8.9%
** Arab (citizen) of Israel 40.8%
* Pure national identity 24.1%, of which
** Palestinian 15.4%
** Arab 8.7%
* Civil identity: Israeli 11.4%
* Religious identity 9.5%
* Other / Don&#x27;t know 5.3%

The focus groups associated with the poll provided a different outcome, in which &quot;there was consensus that Palestinian identity occupies a central place in their consciousness&quot;. reflecting &quot;the strength of Palestinian-Arab identity&quot;, and that they do not see a contradiction between that and Israeli &quot;civic&quot; identity. The focus group revealed strong opposition to the term &quot;Israeli-Arab&quot; and to the concept of Israel&#x27;s &quot;Independence Day&quot;. The study concluded that the focus group findings of strong Palestinian national identity, not conflicting with Israeli civic identity, match those seen in the public sphere.

According to a 2019 survey by University of Haifa professor Sammy Smooha, conducted in Arabic among 718 Arab adults, 47% of the Arab population chose Palestinian identities with an Israeli component (&quot;Israeli Palestinian&quot;, &quot;Palestinian in Israel&quot;, &quot;Palestinian Arab in Israel&quot;), 36% prefers Israeli Arab identities without a Palestinian component (&quot;Israeli&quot;, &quot;Arab&quot;, &quot;Arab in Israel&quot;, &quot;Israeli Arab&quot;), and 15% chose Palestinian identities without an Israeli component (&quot;Palestinian&quot;, &quot;Palestinian Arab&quot;). When these two components are presented as competitors, 69% chose exclusive or primary Palestinian identity, compared with 30% who chose exclusive or primary Israeli Arab identity. 66% of the Arab population agreed that &quot;the identity of &#x27;Palestinian Arab in Israel&#x27; is appropriate to most Arabs in Israel.&quot;

According to a 2020 survey by Camil Fuchs of Tel-Aviv University, 51% of Arabs identify as Arab-Israeli, 7% identify as Palestinian, 23% identify as Israeli, 15% identify as Arab, and 4% identify as &quot;other.&quot; This significantly differs from their 2019 survey, in which 49% identified as Arab-Israeli, 18% as Palestinian, 27% as Arab, and 5% as Israeli.

===Academic practice===
Common practice in contemporary academic literature is to identify this community as &quot;Palestinian&quot; as it is how the majority self-identify (See Self-Identification for more). Terms preferred by most Arab citizens to identify themselves include &quot;Palestinians&quot;, &quot;Palestinians in Israel&quot;, &quot;Israeli Palestinians&quot;, &quot;the Palestinians of 1948&quot;, &quot;Palestinian Arabs&quot;, &quot;Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel&quot; or &quot;Palestinian citizens of Israel&quot;. There are, however, individuals from among the Arab citizenry who reject the term &quot;Palestinian&quot; altogether. A minority of Israel&#x27;s Arab citizens include &quot;Israeli&quot; in some way in their self-identifying label; the majority identify as Palestinian by nationality and Israeli by citizenship.

===Israeli establishment===
The Israeli establishment prefers &quot;Israeli Arabs&quot; or &quot;Arabs in Israel&quot;, and also uses the terms &quot;the minorities&quot;, &quot;the Arab sector&quot;, &quot;Arabs of Israel&quot; and &quot;Arab citizens of Israel&quot;. These labels have been criticized for denying this population a political or national identification, obscuring their Palestinian identity and connection to Palestine. The term &quot;Israeli Arabs&quot; in particular is viewed as a construct of the Israeli authorities. It is nonetheless used by a significant minority of the Arab population, &quot;reflecting its dominance in Israeli social discourse.&quot;

===Historical===
Between 1920 and 1948, in what was then Mandatory Palestine, all citizens were known as Palestinians, and the two primary communities were referred to by the British authorities as &quot;Arabs&quot; and &quot;Jews&quot;. Between 1948 and 1967, very few citizens of Israel identified openly as &quot;Palestinian&quot;. An &quot;Israeli-Arab&quot; identity, the preferred phrase of the Israeli establishment and public, was predominant. Public expressions of Palestinian identity, such as displays of the Palestinian flag or the singing and reciting of nationalist songs or poetry were illegal. Ever since the 1948 Nakba, the Palestinians that have remained within the 1949 Armistice borders have been colloquially known as &quot;48 Arabs&quot; (). With the end of military administrative rule in 1966 and following the 1967 war, national consciousness and its expression among Israel&#x27;s Arab citizens spread. A majority then self-identified as Palestinian, preferring this descriptor to Israeli Arab in numerous surveys over the years.

===East Jerusalem and Golan Heights===
Arabs in East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights (Syrian Golan) are special cases regarding citizenship and identity.

Arabs living in East Jerusalem, occupied and administered by Israel since the Six-Day War of 1967 hold Israeli ID cards, but most are non-citizen permanent residents since few accepted Israel&#x27;s offer of citizenship after the war&#x27;s end, refusing to recognize its sovereignty, and most maintain close ties with the West Bank. As permanent residents, they are eligible to vote in Jerusalem&#x27;s municipal elections, although only a small percentage takes advantage of this right.

The Golan Heights was not part of Mandatory Palestine or the Ottoman political units which preceded it, but rather was part of Syria, and the UN still recognizes it as such, and calls it the Syrian Golan. The remaining Druze population of the Golan Heights, occupied and administered by Israel in 1967, are considered permanent residents under Israels Golan Heights Law of 1981. As of mid 2022, 4,303 Druze citizens of Syria have been granted Israeli citizenship, or, 20% of the total Druze residents in the Golan Heights.

==History==
===1948 Arab–Israeli War===
Most Jewish Israelis refer to the 1948 Arab–Israeli War as the War of Independence, while most Arab citizens refer to it as al-Nakba (the catastrophe), a reflection of differences in perception of the purpose and outcomes of the war.

In the aftermath of the 1947–49 war, the territory previously administered by the British Empire as Mandatory Palestine was de facto divided into three parts: the State of Israel, the Jordanian-held West Bank, and the Egyptian-held Gaza Strip. Of the estimated 950,000 Arabs that lived in the territory that became Israel before the war, over 80% fled or were expelled. The other 20%, some 156,000, remained. Some of them supported Israel from the beginning. Arab citizens of Israel today are largely composed of the people who remained and their descendants. Others include some from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank who procured Israeli citizenship under family-unification provisions made significantly more stringent in the aftermath of the Second Intifada.

Arabs who left their homes during the period of armed conflict, but remained in what had become Israeli territory, were considered to be &quot;present absentees&quot;. In some cases, they were refused permission to return to their homes, which were expropriated and turned over to state ownership, as was the property of other Palestinian refugees. Some 274,000, or 1 of every 4 Arab citizens of Israel are &quot;present absentees&quot; or internally displaced Palestinians. Notable cases of &quot;present absentees&quot; include the residents of Saffuriyya and the Galilee villages of Kafr Bir&#x27;im and Iqrit.

===1949–1966===
Between Israel&#x27;s declaration of independence on 14 May 1948 and the Israeli Nationality Law of 14 July 1952, there technically were no Israeli citizens.

While most Arabs remaining in Israel were granted citizenship, they were subject to martial law in the early years of the state. Zionism had given little serious thought as to how to integrate Arabs, and according to Ian Lustick subsequent policies were &#x27;implemented by a rigorous regime of military rule that dominated what remained of the Arab population in territory ruled by Israel, enabling the state to expropriate most Arab-owned land, severely limit its access to investment capital and employment opportunity, and eliminate virtually all opportunities to use citizenship as a vehicle for gaining political influence&#x27;. A variety of Israeli legislative measures facilitated the transfer of land abandoned by Arabs to state ownership. These included the Absentee Property Law of 1950 which allowed the state to expropriate the property of Palestinians who fled or were expelled to other countries, and the Land Acquisition Law of 1953 which authorized the Ministry of Finance to transfer expropriated land to the state. Other common legal expedients included the use of emergency regulations to declare land belonging to Arab citizens a closed military zone, followed by the use of Ottoman legislation on abandoned land to take control of the land. Travel permits, curfews, administrative detentions, and expulsions were part of life until 1966.

Arabs who held Israeli citizenship were entitled to vote for the Israeli Knesset. Arab Knesset members have served in office since the First Knesset in 1949. The first Arab Knesset members were Amin-Salim Jarjora and Seif el-Din el-Zoubi who were members of the Democratic List of Nazareth party and Tawfik Toubi, member of the Maki party.

In 1965 a radical independent Arab group called &quot;al-Ard&quot; forming the Arab Socialist List tried to run for Knesset elections. The list was banned by the Israeli Central Elections Committee.

In 1966, martial law was lifted completely, and the government set about dismantling most of the discriminatory laws, while Arab citizens were granted the same rights as Jewish citizens under law.

===1967–2000===

After the 1967 Six-Day War, Arab citizens were able to contact Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for the first time since the establishment of the state. This, along with the lifting of military rule, led to increased political activism among Arab citizens.

In 1974, a committee of Arab mayors and municipal councilmen was established which played an important role in representing the community and pressuring the Israeli government. This was followed in 1975 by the formation of the Committee for the Defense of the Land, which sought to prevent continuing land expropriations. That same year, a political breakthrough took place with the election of Arab poet Tawfiq Ziad, a Maki member, as mayor of Nazareth, accompanied by a strong communist presence in the town council. In 1976, six Arab citizens of Israel were killed by Israeli security forces at a protest against land expropriations and house demolitions. The date of the protest, 30 March, has since been commemorated annually as Land Day.

The 1980s saw the birth of the Islamic Movement. As part of a larger trend in the Arab World, the movement emphasized moving Islam into the political realm. They built schools, provided other essential social services, constructed mosques, and encouraged prayer and conservative Islamic dress. The Islamic Movement began to affect electoral politics particularly at the local level.

Many Arab citizens supported the First Intifada and assisted Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, providing them with money, food, and clothes. A number of strikes were also held by Arab citizens in solidarity with Palestinians in the occupied territories.

The years leading up to the Oslo Accords were a time of optimism for Arab citizens. During the administration of Yitzhak Rabin, Arab parties played an important role in the formation of a governing coalition. Increased participation of Arab citizens was also seen at the civil society level. However, tension continued to exist with many Arabs calling for Israel to become a &quot;state of all its citizens&quot;, thereby challenging the state&#x27;s Jewish identity. In the 1999 elections for prime minister, 94% of the Arab electorate voted for Ehud Barak. However, Barak formed a broad left-right-center government without consulting the Arab parties, disappointing the Arab community.

===2000–present===

Tensions between Arabs and the state rose in October 2000 when 12 Arab citizens and one man from Gaza were killed while protesting the government&#x27;s response to the Second Intifada. In response to this incident, the government established the Or Commission. The events of October 2000 caused many Arabs to question the nature of their Israeli citizenship. To a large extent, they boycotted the 2001 Israeli Elections as a means of protest. This boycott helped Ariel Sharon defeat Ehud Barak; as aforementioned, in the 1999 elections, 94 percent of Israel&#x27;s Arab minority had voted for Ehud Barak. IDF enlistment by Bedouin citizens of Israel dropped significantly.

During the 2006 Lebanon War, Arab advocacy organizations complained that the Israeli government had invested time and effort to protect Jewish citizens from Hezbollah attacks, but had neglected Arab citizens. They pointed to a dearth of bomb shelters in Arab towns and villages and a lack of basic emergency information in Arabic. Many Israeli Jews viewed the Arab opposition to government policy and sympathy with the Lebanese as a sign of disloyalty.

In October 2006, tensions rose when Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert invited a right-wing political party Yisrael Beiteinu, to join his coalition government. The party leader, Avigdor Lieberman, advocated an ethnicity based territory exchange, the Lieberman Plan, by transferring heavily populated Arab areas (mainly the Triangle), to Palestinian Authority control and annexing major Jewish Israeli settlement blocs in the West Bank close to the green line as part of a peace proposal. Arabs who would prefer to remain in Israel instead of becoming citizens of a Palestinian state would be able to move to Israel. All citizens of Israel, whether Jews or Arabs, would be required to pledge an oath of allegiance to retain citizenship. Those who refuse could remain in Israel as permanent residents.

In January 2007 the first non-Druze Arab minister in Israel&#x27;s history, Raleb Majadele, was appointed minister without portfolio (Salah Tarif, a Druze, had been appointed a minister without portfolio in 2001). The appointment was criticized by the left, which felt it was an attempt to cover up the Labor Party&#x27;s decision to sit with Yisrael Beiteinu in the government, and by the right, who saw it as a threat to Israel&#x27;s status as a Jewish state. In 2021, Mansour Abbas, the leader of the United Arab List, made history by becoming the first Israeli Arab political leader to join an Israeli governing coalition.

During the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis widespread protests and riots intensified across Israel, particularly in cities with large Arab populations. In Lod, rocks were thrown at Jewish apartments and some Jewish residents were evacuated from their homes by the police. Synagogues and a Muslim cemetery were vandalized. Communal violence including &quot;riots, stabbings, arson, attempted home invasions and shootings&quot; was reported from Beersheba, Rahat, Ramla, Lod, Nasiriyah, Tiberias, Jerusalem, Haifa and Acre.

The Arab community in Israel has seen a significant increase in violence and organized crime, including a rise in gang-related murders in recent years. A report by the Abraham Initiative highlighted that 244 Arab community members were killed in Israel in 2023, more than double the previous year&#x27;s count. The report attributed this surge in homicides directly to National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who campaigned on a platform promising to improve personal security and oversees law enforcement. Prominent organized crime families among Israeli Arabs include Al-Hariri, Bakri, Jarushis, and the Druze Abu Latifs.

Since the outbreak of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Israel has carried out mass arrests and detentions of Palestinian workers and Arab citizens of Israel. On 5 November 2023, CNN reported that &quot;dozens&quot; of Palestinian residents and Arab Israelis were arrested in Israel for expressions of solidarity with the civilian population of Gaza, sharing Quran verses, or expressing &quot;any support for the Palestinian people&quot;. &quot;Haaretz&quot; described the widespread targeting of Arab Israelis by Israeli security forces. Referring to &quot;hundreds&quot; of interrogations, &quot;El País&quot; reported on 11 November that Israel increasingly treats its Arab minority as a &quot;potential fifth column&quot;. At the same time, the conflict saw an increased self-identification with Israel among Arab citizens. According to different polls, a majority of Israeli Arabs condemned the 7 October massacre, but also opposed the mass bombardment of Gaza. Many Israeli Arabs expressed a general resentment over the war, as other Palestinians regarded them as supporters of Israel, whereas Israeli Jews saw them as potential Hamas supporters.

==Sectarian and religious groupings==
In 2006, the official number of Arab residents in Israel – including East Jerusalem and Golan Heights permanent residents many of whom are not citizens – was 1,413,500 people, about 20% of Israel&#x27;s population. The Arab population in 2023 was estimated at 2,065,000, representing 21% of the country&#x27;s population. According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (May 2003), Muslims, including Bedouins, make up 82% of the entire Arab population in Israel, along with around 9% Druze, and 9% Christians. Projections based on 2010 data, predicted that Arab Israelis will constitute 25% of Israel&#x27;s population by 2025.

The national language and mother tongue of Arab citizens, including the Druze, is Arabic and the colloquial spoken language is of the Palestinian Arabic dialect. Knowledge and command of Modern Standard Arabic varies.

===Muslims===
Muslims comprise 17.9% of the Israeli population in 2019. The majority of Muslims in Israel are Sunni Arabs, with an Ahmadiyya minority. There are around 4,000 Alawites in Israel and the majority of them live in Ghajar village in the occupied Golan Heights near the border with Lebanon. The Bedouin in Israel are also Arab Muslims, with some Bedouin clans participating in the Israeli army. The small Circassian community is composed of Sunni Muslims uprooted from the North Caucasus in the late 19th century. In addition, smaller populations of Kurdish, Romani and Turkish Muslims also live in Israel.

In 2020, Jerusalem hosted the largest Muslim population in Israel, numbering 346,000 residents, constituting 21.1% of Israel&#x27;s Muslim population and about 36.9% of the city&#x27;s total residents. Rahat followed with the second-largest Muslim population at 71,300 residents, while Umm Al-Fahm and Nazareth had approximately 56,000 and 55,600 residents, respectively. The eleven towns of the Triangle area are home to approximately 250,000 Israeli Muslims.

Regarding regional distribution in 2020, approximately 35.2% of Israeli Muslims resided in the Northern District, 21.9% in the Jerusalem District, 17.1% in the Central District, 13.7% in the Haifa District, 10.9% in the Southern District, and 1.2% in the Tel Aviv District. The Israeli Muslim population is notably youthful: about 33.4% are aged 14 and under, while those aged 65 and older account for only 4.3%. Furthermore, the Muslim community in Israel boasts the highest fertility rate among religious groups, standing at 3.16 children per woman.

According to study published by Pew Research Center in 2016, while Muslims living in Israel, overall, are more religious than Israeli Jews, they are less religious than Muslims living in many other countries in the Middle East. Muslim women are more likely to say that religion has high importance in their lives, and younger Muslims are generally less observant than their elders. According to the Israel Democracy Institute survey conducted in 2015, 47% of Israeli Muslims identified as traditional, 32% identified as religious, 17% identified as not religious at all, 3% identified as very religious.

====Settled====
Traditionally settled communities of Muslim Arabs comprise about 70% of the Arab population in Israel. In 2010, the average number of children per mother was 3.84, dropping from 3.97 in 2008. The Muslim population is mostly young: 42% of Muslims are under the age of 15. The median age of Muslim Israelis is 18, while the median age of Jewish Israelis is 30. The percentage of people over 65 is less than 3% for Muslims, compared with 12% for the Jewish population.

====Bedouin====

According to the Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel, 110,000 Bedouins live in the Negev, 50,000 in the Galilee, and 10,000 in the central region of Israel.

Prior to the establishment of Israel in 1948, there were an estimated 65,000–90,000 Bedouin living in the Negev. The 11,000 who remained were relocated by the Israeli government in the 1950s and 1960s to an area in the northeastern Negev comprising 10% of the Negev desert. The Israeli government built seven development towns for the Bedouin between 1979 and 1982. Around half the Bedouin population live in these towns, the largest of which is the city of Rahat, others being Ar&#x27;arat an-Naqab (Ar&#x27;ara BaNegev), Bir Hadaj, Hura, Kuseife, Lakiya, Shaqib al-Salam (Segev Shalom) and Tel as-Sabi (Tel Sheva). In 2005, Bedouin were estimated to amount to 10% of the Arab citizens of Israel. Approximately 40–50% of Bedouin citizens of Israel live in 39–45 unrecognized villages that are not connected to the electrical grid and water mains. A study published by the Taub Center for Social Policy Studies in 2017 found that Bedouins have the lowest achievements in the Arab sector on all indices: bagrut scores, rates of college graduates, and fields of employment. As they tend to be the least educated.

===Druze===
Most Israeli Druze reside in the northern part of the country and are officially recognized as a separate religious community with their own courts. They maintain Arabic language and culture as integral parts of their identity, and Arabic is their primary language. The Galilean Druze and Druze of the Haifa region received Israeli citizenship automatically in 1948. After Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and annexed it to Israel in 1981, the Druze of the Golan Heights were offered full Israeli citizenship under the Golan Heights Law. Most declined Israeli citizenship and retain Syrian citizenship and identity and are treated as permanent residents of Israel. As of 2011, fewer than 10% of the Druze population in the Golan Heights had accepted Israeli citizenship.

At the end of 2019, approximately 81% of the Israeli Druze population lived in the Northern District and 19% lived in the Haifa District, and the largest population of Druze were Daliyat al-Karmel and Yirka. Israeli Druze live in 19 towns and villages, either singly or mixed with Christians and Muslims, all located on the tops of the mountains in northern Israel (Upper and Lower Galilee and Mount Carmel), including Abu Snan, Beit Jann, Daliyat al-Karmel, Ein al-Asad, Hurfeish, Isfiya, Julis, Kafr Yasif, Kisra-Sumei, Maghar, Peki&#x27;in, Rameh, Sajur, Shefa-Amr, Yanuh-Jat, and Yarka. There are four remaining Druze villages in the Israeli-annexed portion of the Golan Heights—Majdal Shams, Mas&#x27;ade, Buq&#x27;ata, and Ein Qiniyye—in which 23,000 Druze live.

During the British Mandate for Palestine, the Druze did not embrace the rising Arab nationalism of the time or participate in violent confrontations. In 1948, many Druze volunteered for the Israeli army and no Druze villages were destroyed or permanently abandoned. Since the establishment of the state, the Druze have demonstrated solidarity with Israel and distanced themselves from Arab and Islamic radicalism. Male Druze citizens serve in the Israel Defense Forces.

From 1957, the Israeli government formally recognized the Druze as a separate religious community, and are defined as a distinct ethnic group in the Israeli Ministry of Interior&#x27;s census registration. On the other hand, the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics categorizes Druze as Arabs in their census. While the Israeli education system is basically divided into Hebrew and Arabic speaking schools, the Druze have autonomy within the Arabic speaking branch. Israeli Druze are Arabic in language and culture, and their mother tongue is the Arabic Language.

Some scholars maintain that Israel has tried to separate the Druze from other Arab communities, and that the effort has influenced the way Israel&#x27;s Druze perceive their modern identity. Survey data suggests that Israeli Druze prioritize their identity first as Druze (religiously), second as Arabs (culturally and ethnically), and third as Israelis (citizenship-wise). A small minority of them identify as Palestinians, distinguishing them from the majority of other Arab citizens of Israel, who predominantly identify as Palestinians.

In a survey conducted in 2008 by Dr. Yusuf Hassan of Tel Aviv University 94% of Druze respondents identified as &quot;Druze-Israelis&quot; in the religious and national context, while a 2017 Pew Research Center poll reported that while 99% of Muslims and 96% of Christians identified as ethnically Arab, a smaller share of Druze, 71%, identified likewise. Compared to other Christians and Muslims, Druze place less emphasis on their Arab identity and self-identify more as Israeli. Most do not identify as Palestinians. However, they were less ready for personal relationships with Jews compared to Israeli Muslims and Christians. Scholars attribute this trend to cultural differences between Jews and Druze. Druze politicians in Israel include Ayoob Kara, who represented Likud in the Knesset; Majalli Wahabi of Kadima, the Deputy Speaker of the Knesset; and Said Nafa of the Arab party Balad.

===Christians===

Christian Arabs comprise about 9% of the Arab population in Israel. At the end of 2019, approximately 70.6% reside in the Northern District, 13.3% in the Haifa District, 9.5% in the Jerusalem District, 3.4% in the Central District, 2.7% in the Tel Aviv District and 0.5% in the Southern District. There are 135,000 or more Christian Arabs in Israel (and more than 39,000 non-Arab Christians). As of 2014 the Melkite Greek Catholic Church was the largest Christian community in Israel, where about 60% of Israeli Christians belonged to the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, while around 30% of Israeli Christians belonged to the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem. The Christian communities in Israel run numerous schools, colleges, hospitals, clinics, orphanages, homes for the elderly, dormitories, family and youth centers, hotels, and guesthouses.

Nazareth has the largest Christian Arab population, followed by Haifa. The majority of Haifa&#x27;s Arab minority is Christian as well. The Christian Arab communities in Nazareth and Haifa tend to be wealthier and better educated compare to other Arabs elsewhere in Israel. Arab Christians also live in a number of other localities in the Galilee; such as Abu Snan, Arraba, Bi&#x27;ina, Deir Hanna, I&#x27;billin, Jadeidi-Makr, Kafr Kanna, Mazra&#x27;a, Muqeible, Ras al-Ein, Reineh, Sakhnin, Shefa-Amr, Tur&#x27;an and Yafa an-Naseriyye. localities such as Eilabun, Jish, Kafr Yasif and Rameh are predominantly Christians. Nearly all the population of Fassuta and Mi&#x27;ilya are Melkite Christians. Some Druze villages, such as Daliyat al-Karmel, Ein Qiniyye, Hurfeish, Isfiya, Kisra-Sumei, Maghar, Majdal Shams and Peki&#x27;in have small Christian Arab populations. Mixed cities such as Acre, Jerusalem, Lod, Ma&#x27;alot-Tarshiha, Nof HaGalil, Ramla and Tel Aviv-Jaffa have significant Christian Arab populations.

Many Christian Arabs have been prominent in Arab political parties in Israel, and leaders have included Archbishop George Hakim, Emile Toma, Tawfik Toubi, Emile Habibi, and Azmi Bishara. Notable Christian religious figures include the Melkite Archbishops of the Galilee Elias Chacour and Boutros Mouallem, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem Michel Sabbah, and Bishop Munib Younan of the Lutheran Church of Jordan and the Holy Land. Israeli Supreme Court judges Salim Joubran and George Karra are Christian Arab. Notable Christian figures in science and high tech include Hossam Haick who has many contributions in multidisciplinary fields such as nanotechnology, nanosensors and molecular electronics, and Johny Srouji who is Apple&#x27;s senior vice president of hardware technologies.

Among Arab Christians in Israel, some emphasize pan-Arabism, whilst a small minority enlists in the Israel Defense Forces. Since September 2014 Christian families or clans who have either Aramaic/Assyrian or Maronite cultural heritage are considered an ethnicity separate from Israeli Arabs and can register themselves as Arameans. This recognition comes after about seven years of activity by the Aramean Christian Foundation in Israel, which rather than sticking to an Arab identity, wishes to assimilate into an Israeli lifestyle. Aram is led by IDF Major Shadi Khalloul Risho and the Israeli Christian Recruitment Forum, headed by Father Gabriel Naddaf of the Greek-Orthodox Church and Major Ihab Shlayan. The move was condemned by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, which described it as an attempt to divide the Palestinian minority in Israel. Other pro-Zionist advocates supporting similar ideas received extensive coverage in Israeli state sponsored media and Jewish news outlets to severe criticisms from their co-religionists (see Yoseph Haddad).

Christian Arabs are one of the most educated groups in Israel. Statistically, Christian Arabs in Israel have the highest rates of educational attainment among all religious communities, according to a data by Israel Central Bureau of Statistics in 2010, 63% of Israeli Christian Arabs have had college or postgraduate education, the highest of any religious and ethno-religious group. Despite the fact that Arab Christians only represent 2% of the total Israeli population, in 2014 they accounted for 17% of the country&#x27;s university students, and for 14% of its college students. There are more Christians who have attained a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher academic degrees than the median Israeli population. The rate of students studying in the field of medicine was higher among Christian Arab students than that of all other sectors, and the percentage of Arab Christian women who are receiving higher education is also higher than that of other groups.

The Israel Central Bureau of Statistics noted that when taking into account the data recorded over the years, Israeli Christian Arabs fared the best in terms of education in comparison to any other group receiving an education in Israel. In 2012 Christian Arabs had the highest rates of success at matriculation examinations, In 2016, Arab Christians had the highest rates of success at matriculation examinations, namely 73.9%, both in comparison to Muslim and Druze Israelis (41% and 51.9% respectively), and to the students from the different branches of the Hebrew (majority Jewish) education system considered as one group (55.1%).

In terms of their socio-economic situation, Arab Christians are more similar to the Jewish population than to the Muslim Arab population. They have the lowest incidence of poverty and the lowest percentage of unemployment, at 4.9%, compared to 6.5% among Jewish men and women. They have also the highest median household income among Arab citizens of Israel and second highest median household income among the Israeli ethno-religious groups. Also Arab Christians have a high presentation in science and in the white collar professions. In Israel Arab Christians are portrayed as a hard working and upper middle class educated ethno-religious minority. According to study the majority of Christians in Israel (68.2 per cent) are employed in the service sector, i.e. banks, insurance companies, schools, tourism, hospitals etc.

According to the study &quot;Are Christian Arabs the New Israeli Jews? Reflections on the Educational Level of Arab Christians in Israel&quot; by Hanna David from the University of Tel Aviv, one of the factors why Israeli Arab Christians are the most educated segment of Israel&#x27;s population is the high level of the Christian educational institutions. Christian schools in Israel are among the best schools in the country, and while those schools represent only 4% of the Arab schooling sector, about 34% of Arab university students come from Christian schools, and about 87% of the Israeli Arabs in the high tech sector have been educated in Christian schools. A 2011 Maariv article described the Christian Arab sector as &quot;the most successful in the education system&quot;, an opinion supported by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics and others who point out that Christian Arabs fared best in terms of education in comparison to any other group receiving an education in Israel.

===Lebanese people===
There are 3,500 Lebanese people in Israel, most of them are former members of the South Lebanon Army (SLA) and their families. The SLA was a Christian-dominated militia allied with the Israel Defense Forces during the South Lebanon conflict until Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from Lebanon in May 2000 that ended the Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon. The majority are Maronites but there are also Muslims, Druze and Christians of other denominations among them. They are registered by the Ministry of Interior as &quot;Lebanese&quot; and hold Israeli citizenship. They are located across the country, mainly in the Northern District, in cities such as Nahariya, Kiryat Shmona, Tiberias, and Haifa.

The native language of former SLA members is Lebanese Arabic. However, the language is only partially transmitted from one generation to another. The majority of the second generation understand and speak Lebanese Arabic but are unable to read and write it. Young Lebanese Israeli mainly text in Hebrew or, more rarely, in Lebanese Arabic written in the Hebrew alphabet. Religious books for children and youths are similarly written in Classical Arabic (or in Lebanese Arabic for some songs) in Hebrew letters.

==Population==
In 2006, the official number of Arab residents in Israel was 1,413,500 people, about 20% of Israel&#x27;s population. This figure includes 209,000 Arabs (14% of the Israeli Arab population) in East Jerusalem, also counted in the Palestinian statistics, although 98% of East Jerusalem Palestinians have either Israeli residency or Israeli citizenship. In 2012, the official number of Arab residents in Israel increased to 1,617,000 people, about 21% of Israel&#x27;s population. The Arab population in 2023 was estimated at 2,065,000 people, representing 21% of the country&#x27;s population.

According to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics census in 2010, &quot;the Arab population lives in 134 towns and villages. About 44 percent of them live in towns (compared to 81 percent of the Jewish population); 48 percent live in villages with local councils (compared to 9 percent of the Jewish population). Four percent of the Arab citizens live in small villages with regional councils, while the rest live in unrecognized villages (the proportion is much higher, 31 percent in the Negev)&quot;. The Arab population in Israel is located in five main areas: Galilee (54.6% of total Israeli Arabs), Triangle (23.5% of total Israeli Arabs), Golan Heights, East Jerusalem, and Northern Negev (13.5% of total Israeli Arabs). Around 8.4% (approximately 102,000 inhabitants) of Israeli Arabs live in officially mixed Jewish-Arab cities (excluding Arab residents in East Jerusalem), including Haifa, Lod, Ramle, Jaffa-Tel Aviv, Acre, Nof HaGalil, and Ma&#x27;alot Tarshiha.
In Israel&#x27;s Northern District Arab citizens of Israel form a majority of the population (52%) and about 50% of the Arab population lives in 114 different localities throughout Israel. In total there are 122 primarily if not entirely Arab localities in Israel, 89 of them having populations over two thousand. The seven townships as well as the Abu Basma Regional Council that have been constructed by the government for the Bedouin population of the Negev, are the only Arab localities to have been established since 1948, with the aim of relocating the Arab Bedouin citizens (&quot;see preceding section on Bedouin&quot;).

46% of the country&#x27;s Arabs (622,400 people) live in predominantly Arab communities in the north. In Nazareth was the largest Arab city, with a population of , roughly 40,000 of whom are Muslim. Shefa-&#x27;Amr has a population of approximately and the city is mixed with sizable populations of Muslims, Christians, and Druze.

Jerusalem, a mixed city, has the largest overall Arab population. Jerusalem housed 332,400 Arabs in 2016 (37.7% of the city&#x27;s residents) and together with the local council of Abu Ghosh, some 19% of the country&#x27;s entire Arab population.

14% of Arab citizens live in the Haifa District predominantly in the Wadi Ara region. Here is the largest Muslim city, Umm al-Fahm, with a population of . Baqa-Jatt is the second largest Arab population center in the district. The city of Haifa has an Arab population of 10%, much of it in the Wadi Nisnas, Abbas and Halissa neighborhoods. Wadi Nisnas and Abbas neighborhoods, are largely Christian, Halisa and Kababir are largely Muslim.

10% of the country&#x27;s Arab population resides in the Central District of Israel, primarily the cities of Tayibe, Tira, and Qalansawe as well as the mixed cities of Lod and Ramla which have mainly Jewish populations.

Of the remaining 11%, 10% live in Bedouin communities in the northwestern Negev. The Bedouin city of Rahat is the only Arab city in the Southern District and it is the third largest Arab city in Israel.

The remaining 1% of the country&#x27;s Arab population lives in cities that are almost entirely Jewish, such as Nazareth Illit with an Arab population of 22% and Tel Aviv-Yafo, 4%.

In February 2008, the government announced that the first new Arab city would be constructed in Israel. According to Haaretz, &quot;[s]ince the establishment of the State of Israel, not a single new Arab settlement has been established, with the exception of permanent housing projects for Bedouins in the Negev&quot;. The city, Givat Tantur, was never constructed even after 10 years.

===Major Arab localities===


Arabs make up the majority of the population of the &quot;heart of the Galilee&quot; and of the areas along the Green Line including the Wadi Ara region. Bedouin Arabs make up the majority of the northeastern section of the Negev.

===Perceived demographic threat===

The phrase &quot;demographic threat&quot; (or &quot;demographic bomb&quot;) is used within the Israeli political sphere to describe the growth of Israel&#x27;s Arab citizenry as constituting a threat to its maintenance of its status as a Jewish state with a Jewish demographic majority. In the northern part of Israel the percentage of the population that is Jewish is declining. The increasing population of Arabs within Israel, and the majority status they hold in two major geographic regions – the Galilee and the Triangle – has become a growing point of open political contention in recent years. Among Arabs, Muslims have the highest birth rate, followed by Druze, and then Christians.
Israeli historian Benny Morris stated in 2004 that, while he strongly opposes expulsion of Israeli Arabs, in case of an &quot;apocalyptic&quot; scenario where Israel comes under total attack with non-conventional weapons and comes under existential threat, an expulsion might be the only option. He compared the Israeli Arabs to a &quot;time bomb&quot; and &quot;a potential fifth column&quot; in both demographic and security terms and said they are liable to undermine the state in time of war.

Several politicians have viewed the Arabs in Israel as a security and demographic threat.

The phrase &quot;demographic bomb&quot; was famously used by Benjamin Netanyahu in 2003 when he noted that, if the percentage of Arab citizens rises above its current level of about 20 percent, Israel will not be able to maintain a Jewish demographic majority. Netanyahu&#x27;s comments were criticized as racist by Arab Knesset members and a range of civil rights and human rights organizations, such as the Association for Civil Rights in Israel. Even earlier allusions to the &quot;demographic threat&quot; can be found in an internal Israeli government document drafted in 1976 known as the Koenig Memorandum, which laid out a plan for reducing the number and influence of Arab citizens of Israel in the Galilee region.

In 2003, the Israeli daily &quot;Ma&#x27;ariv&quot; published an article entitled &quot;Special Report: Polygamy is a Security Threat&quot;, detailing a report put forth by the Director of the Population Administration at the time, Herzl Gedj; the report described polygamy in the Bedouin sector a &quot;security threat&quot; and advocated means of reducing the birth rate in the Arab sector. The Population Administration is a department of the Demographic Council, whose purpose, according to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, is: &quot;...to increase the Jewish birthrate by encouraging women to have more children using government grants, housing benefits, and other incentives&quot;. In 2008 the minister of the interior appointed Yaakov Ganot as new head of the Population Administration, which according to &quot;Haaretz&quot; is &quot;probably the most important appointment an interior minister can make&quot;.

A January 2006 study rejects the &quot;demographic time bomb&quot; threat based on statistical data that shows Jewish births have increased while Arab births have begun to drop. The study noted shortcomings in earlier demographic predictions (for example, in the 1960s, predictions suggested that Arabs would be the majority in 1990). The study also demonstrated that Christian Arab and Druze birth rates were actually below those of Jewish birth rates in Israel. The study used data from a Gallup poll to demonstrate that the desired family size for Arabs in Israel and Jewish Israelis were the same. The study&#x27;s population forecast for 2025 predicted that Arabs would comprise only 25% of the Israeli population. Nevertheless, the Bedouin population, with its high birth rates, continues to be perceived as a threat to a Jewish demographic majority in the south, and a number of development plans, such as the Blueprint Negev, address this concern.

A study showed that in 2010, Jewish birthrates rose by 31% and 19,000 diaspora Jews immigrated to Israel, while the Arab birthrate fell by 2%.

===Land and population exchange===


Some Israeli politicians advocate land-swap proposals in order to assure a continued Jewish majority within Israel. A specific proposal is that Israel transfer sovereignty of part of the Arab-populated Wadi Ara area (west of the Green Line) to a future Palestinian state, in return for formal sovereignty over the major Jewish settlement &quot;blocks&quot; that lie inside the West Bank east of the Green Line.

Avigdor Lieberman of Yisrael Beiteinu, the fourth largest faction in the 17th Knesset, is one of the foremost advocates of the transfer of large Arab towns located just inside Israel near the border with the West Bank (e.g. Tayibe, Umm al-Fahm, Baqa al-Gharbiyye), to the jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority in exchange for Israeli settlements located inside the West Bank.

In October 2006, Yisrael Beiteinu formally joined in the ruling government&#x27;s parliamentary coalition, headed by Kadima. After the Israeli Cabinet confirmed Avigdor Lieberman&#x27;s appointment to the position of &quot;minister for strategic threats&quot;, Labour Party representative and science, sport and culture minister Ophir Pines-Paz resigned his post. In his resignation letter to Ehud Olmert, Pines-Paz wrote: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t sit in a government with a minister who preaches racism.&quot;

The Lieberman Plan caused a stir among Arab citizens of Israel. Various polls show that Arabs in Israel do not wish to move to the West Bank or Gaza if a Palestinian state is created there. In a survey conducted by Kul Al-Arab among 1,000 residents of Um Al-Fahm, 83 percent of respondents opposed the idea of transferring their city to Palestinian jurisdiction, while 11 percent supported the proposal and 6 percent did not express their position.

Of those opposed to the idea, 54% said that they were against becoming part of a Palestinian state because they wanted to continue living under a democratic regime and enjoying a good standard of living. Of these opponents, 18% said that they were satisfied with their present situation, that they were born in Israel and that they were not interested in moving to any other state. Another 14% of this same group said that they were not prepared to make sacrifices for the sake of the creation of a Palestinian state. Another 11 percent cited no reason for their opposition.

==Politics==

===Arab political parties===
There are three mainstream Arab parties in Israel: Hadash (a joint Arab-Jewish party with a large Arab presence), Balad, and the United Arab List, which is a coalition of several different political organizations including the Islamic Movement in Israel. In addition to these, there is Ta&#x27;al, which currently run with Hadash. All of these parties primarily represent Arab-Israeli and Palestinian interests, and the Islamic Movement is an Islamist organization with two factions: one that opposes Israel&#x27;s existence, and another that opposes its existence as a Jewish state. Two Arab parties ran in Israel&#x27;s first election in 1949, with one, the Democratic List of Nazareth, winning two seats. Until the 1960s all Arab parties in the Knesset were aligned with Mapai, the ruling party.

A minority of Arabs join and vote for Zionist parties; in the 2006 elections 30% of the Arab vote went to such parties, up from 25% in 2003, though down on the 1999 (31%) and 1996 elections (33%). Left-wing parties (i.e. Labor Party and Meretz-Yachad, and previously One Nation) are the most popular parties amongst Arabs, though some Druze have also voted for right-wing parties such as Likud and Yisrael Beiteinu, as well as the centrist Kadima.

Arab-dominated parties typically do not join governing coalitions. However, historically these parties have formed alliances with dovish Jewish parties and promoted the formation of their governments by voting with them from the opposition. Arab parties are credited with keeping Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in power, and they have suggested they would do the same for a government led by Labor leader Isaac Herzog and peace negotiator Tzipi Livni. A 2015 &quot;Haaretz&quot; poll found that a majority of Israeli Arabs would like their parties, then running on a joint list, to join the governing coalition.

===Representation in the Knesset===

Palestinian Arabs sat in the state&#x27;s first parliamentary assembly in 1949. In 2011, 13 of the 120 members of the Israeli Parliament are Arab citizens, most representing Arab political parties, and one of Israel&#x27;s Supreme Court judges is a Palestinian Arab.

The 2015 elections included 18 Arab members of Knesset. Along with 13 members of the Joint List, there were five Arab parliamentarians representing Zionist parties, which is more than double their number in the previous Knesset.

Some Arab Members of the Knesset, past and present, are under police investigation for their visits to countries designated as enemy countries by Israeli law. This law was amended following MK Mohammad Barakeh&#x27;s trip to Syria in 2001, such that MKs must explicitly request permission to visit these countries from the Minister of the Interior. In August 2006, Balad MKs Azmi Bishara, Jamal Zahalka, and Wasil Taha visited Syria without requesting nor receiving such permission, and a criminal investigation of their actions was launched. Former Arab Member of Knesset Mohammed Miari was questioned 18 September 2006 by police on suspicion of having entered a designated enemy country without official permission. He was questioned &quot;under caution&quot; for 2.5 hours in the Petah Tikva station about his recent visit to Syria. Another former Arab Member of Knesset, Muhammad Kanaan, was also summoned for police questioning regarding the same trip. In 2010, six Arab MKs visited Libya, an openly anti-Zionist Arab state, and met with Muammar al-Gaddafi and various senior government officials. Gaddafi urged them to seek a one-state solution, and for Arabs to &quot;multiply&quot; in order to counter any &quot;plots&quot; to expel them.

According to a study commissioned by the Arab Association of Human Rights entitled &quot;Silencing Dissent&quot;, over the period 1999–2002, eight of nine of the then Arab Knesset members were beaten by Israeli forces during demonstrations. Most recently according to the report, legislation has been passed, including three election laws [e.g., banning political parties], and two Knesset related laws aimed to &quot;significantly curb the minority [Arab population] right to choose a public representative and for those representatives to develop independent political platforms and carry out their duties&quot;.
The Knesset Ethics Committee has on several occasions banned Arab MKs that the committee felt were acting outside acceptable norms. In 2016, Hanin Zoabi and Jamal Zahalka were banned from plenary sessions for four months and Basel Ghattas for two months after they had visited families of Palestinian attackers killed by Israeli security forces. Ghattas was again banned for six months in 2017 over charges of having smuggled cell phones to Palestinian prisoners and Zoabi was banned for a week for having called IDF soldiers &quot;murderers.&quot;

In 2016, the Knesset passed a controversial law that would allow it to impeach any MK who incites racism or supports armed struggle against Israel. Critics said that the law was undemocratic and would mainly be used to silence Arab MKs. As of 2020, no MK has been impeached by the law. In 2018, the Israeli supreme court of justice rejected arguments that the law would harm specific political parties and ruled that checks and balances within the law serve as sufficient protection against abuse of rights. For example, the law requires 70 Knesset members, 10 of whom must be from the opposition, to petition to the Knesset House Committee, and could only be finalized with a vote of 90 out of 120 MKs in favor of the impeachment.

===Representation in the civil service sphere===
In the public employment sphere, by the end of 2002, 6% of 56,362 Israeli civil servants were Arab. In January 2004, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon declared that every state-run company must have at least one Arab citizen of Israel on its board of directors.

===Representation in political, judicial and military positions===

Knesset:
Arab citizens of Israel have been elected to every Knesset, and held 17 of its 120 seats. The first female Arab MP was Hussniya Jabara, a Muslim Arab from central Israel, who was elected in 1999.

Government: Until 2001, no Arab had been included Israel&#x27;s cabinet. In 2001, this changed, when Salah Tarif, a Druze Arab citizen of Israel, was appointed a member of Ariel Sharon&#x27;s cabinet without a portfolio. Tarif was later ejected after being convicted of corruption. The first non-Druze Arab minister in Israel&#x27;s history was Raleb Majadele, who in 2007 was appointed a minister without portfolio, and a month later appointed minister for Science, Culture and Sport. Following this precedent, additional Muslim Arabs served as ministers or deputy ministers, including Issawi Frej, Abd el-Aziz el-Zoubi and Nawaf Massalha

The appointment of Majadele was criticized by far-right Israelis, some of whom are also within the Cabinet, but this drew condemnation across the mainstream Israeli political spectrum. Meanwhile, Arab lawmakers called the appointment an attempt to &quot;whitewash Israel&#x27;s discriminatory policies against its Arab minority&quot;.

Supreme Court:
Abdel Rahman Zuabi, a Muslim from northern Israel, was the first Arab on the Israeli Supreme Court, serving a 9-month term in 1999. In 2004, Salim Joubran, a Christian Arab from Haifa descended from Lebanese Maronites, became the first Arab to hold a permanent appointment on the Court. Joubran&#x27;s expertise lies in the field of criminal law. George Karra, a Christian Arab from Jaffa has served as a Tel Aviv District Court judge since 2000. He was the presiding judge in the trial of Moshe Katsav. In 2011, he was nominated as a candidate for the Israeli Supreme Court.

Foreign Service:
Ali Yahya, an Arab Muslim, became the first Arab ambassador for Israel in 1995 when he was appointed ambassador to Finland. He served until 1999, and in 2006 was appointed ambassador to Greece. Other Arab ambassadors include Walid Mansour, a Druze, appointed ambassador to Vietnam in 1999, and Reda Mansour, also a Druze, a former ambassador to Ecuador. Mohammed Masarwa, an Arab Muslim, was Consul-General in Atlanta. In 2006, Ishmael Khaldi was appointed Israeli consul in San Francisco, becoming the first Bedouin consul of the State of Israel.

Israel Defense Forces:
Arab Generals in the IDF include Major General Hussain Fares, commander of Israel&#x27;s border police, and Major General Yosef Mishlav, head of the Home Front Command and current Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories. Both are members of the Druze community. Other high-ranking officers in the IDF include Lieutenant Colonel Amos Yarkoni (born Abd el-Majid Haydar/ عبد الماجد حيدر) from the Bedouin community, a legendary officer in the Israel Defense Forces and one of six Israeli Arabs to have received the IDF&#x27;s third highest decoration, the Medal of Distinguished Service.

Israeli Police:
In 2011, Jamal Hakroush became the first Muslim Arab deputy Inspector-General in the Israeli Police. He has previously served as district commander of two districts.

Jewish National Fund:
In 2007, Ra&#x27;adi Sfori became the first Arab citizen of Israel to be elected as a JNF director, over a petition against his appointment. The court upheld the JNF&#x27;s appointment, explaining, &quot;As this is one director among a large number, there is no chance he will have the opportunity to cancel the organization&#x27;s goals.&quot;

===Other political organizations and movements===
; Abna el-Balad
Abnaa el-Balad is a political movement that grew out of organizing by Arab university youth, beginning in 1969. It is not affiliated with the Arab Knesset party Balad. While participating in municipal elections, Abnaa al-Balad firmly reject any participation in the Israeli Knesset. Political demands include &quot;the return of all Palestinian refugees to their homes and lands, [an] end [to] the Israeli occupation and Zionist apartheid and the establishment [of] a democratic secular state in Palestine as the ultimate solution to the Arab-Zionist conflict.&quot;

; High Follow-Up Committee for Arab Citizens of Israel
The High Follow-Up Committee for Arab Citizens of Israel is an extra-parliamentary umbrella organization that represents Arab citizens of Israel at the national level. It is &quot;the top representative body deliberating matters of general concern to the entire Arab community and making binding decisions.&quot; While it enjoys &quot;de facto&quot; recognition from the State of Israel, it lacks official or &quot;de jure&quot; recognition from the state for its activities in this capacity.

; Ta&#x27;ayush
Ta&#x27;ayush is &quot;a grassroots movement of Arabs and Jews working to break down the walls of racism and segregation by constructing a true Arab-Jewish partnership.&quot;

; Regional Council of Unrecognized Villages
The Regional Council of Unrecognized Villages is a body of unofficial representatives of the unrecognized villages throughout the Negev region in the south.

===Attempts to ban Arab political parties===
Amendment 9 to the &#x27;Basic Law: The Knesset and the Law of Political Parties&#x27; states that a political party &quot;may not participate in the elections if there is in its goals or actions a denial of the existence of the State of Israel as the state of the Jewish people, a denial of the democratic nature of the state, or incitement to racism.&quot; There have been a number of attempts to disqualify Arab parties based on this rule, however as of 2010, all such attempts were either rejected by the Israeli Central Elections Committee or overturned by the Israeli Supreme Court.

====Progressive List for Peace====
An Israeli Central Elections Committee ruling which allowed the Progressive List for Peace to run for the Knesset in 1988 was challenged based on this amendment, but the committee&#x27;s decision was upheld by the Israeli Supreme Court, which ruled that the PLP&#x27;s platform calling for Israel to become &quot;a state of all its citizens&quot; does not violate the ideology of Israel as the State of the Jewish people, and thus section 7(a) does not apply.

====Balad====
In December 2002, Azmi Bishara and his party, Balad, which calls for Israel to become &quot;a state of all its citizens&quot;, were banned by the Israeli Central Elections Committee, for refusing to recognize Israel as a &quot;Jewish and democratic state&quot; and making statements promoting armed struggle against it. The Supreme Court overruled the decision in January 2003. Bishara served as a Knesset member from 1996 to 2007. He reportedly told an audience in Lebanon in December 2005 that Arab citizens &quot;... are like all Arabs, only with Israeli citizenship forced upon them ... Return Palestine to us and take your democracy with you. We Arabs are not interested in it&quot;. Bishara resigned his Knesset office and left the country in 2007 amidst news that criminal charges were being laid against him. He has been charged with espionage and money laundering, stemming from allegations that he gave Hizbullah information on strategic targets that should be attacked with rockets during the 2006 Lebanon War, in exchange for large amounts of money.

====United Arab List – Ta&#x27;al and Balad====
In 2009, United Arab List – Ta&#x27;al and Balad were disqualified, on grounds that they do not recognize the State of Israel and call for armed conflict against it. The Supreme Court overturned the committee&#x27;s decision by a majority of eight to one.

==Legal and political status==
Israel&#x27;s Declaration of Independence called for the establishment of a Jewish state with equality of social and political rights, irrespective of religion, race, or sex.

The rights of citizens are guaranteed by a set of basic laws (Israel does not have a written constitution). Although this set of laws does not explicitly include the term &quot;right to equality&quot;, the Israeli Supreme Court has consistently interpreted &quot;Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty&quot; and &quot;Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation (1994)&quot; as guaranteeing equal rights for all Israeli citizens.

The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that &quot;Arab Israelis are citizens of Israel with equal rights&quot; and states that &quot;The only legal distinction between Arab and Jewish citizens is not one of rights, but rather of civic duty. Since Israel&#x27;s establishment, Arab citizens have been exempted from compulsory service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).&quot; Druze and Circassians are drafted into the Israeli army, while other Arabs may serve voluntarily; however, only a very small number of Arabs choose to volunteer for the Israeli army.

Many Arab citizens feel that the state, as well as society at large, not only actively limits them to second-class citizenship, but treats them as enemies, affecting their perception of the &quot;de jure&quot; versus &quot;de facto&quot; quality of their citizenship. The joint document &quot;The Future Vision of the Palestinian Arabs in Israel&quot;, asserts: &quot;Defining the Israeli State as a Jewish State and exploiting democracy in the service of its Jewishness excludes us, and creates tension between us and the nature and essence of the State.&quot; The document explains that by definition the &quot;Jewish State&quot; concept is based on ethnically preferential treatment towards Jews enshrined in immigration (the Law of Return) and land policy (the Jewish National Fund), and calls for the establishment of minority rights protections enforced by an independent anti-discrimination commission.

A 2004 report by Mossawa, an advocacy center for Palestinian-Arab citizens of Israel, states that since the events of October 2000, 16 Arabs had been killed by security forces, bringing the total to 29 victims of &quot;institutional violence&quot; in four years. Ahmed Sa&#x27;adi, in his article on &quot;The Concept of Protest and its Representation by the Or Commission&quot;, states that since 1948 the only protestors to be killed by the police have been Arabs.

Yousef Munayyer, an Israeli citizen and the executive director of The Jerusalem Fund, wrote that Palestinians only have varying degrees of limited rights in Israel. He states that although Palestinians make up about 20% of Israel&#x27;s population, less than 7% of the budget is allocated to Palestinian citizens. He describes the 1.5 million Arab citizens of Israel as second-class citizens while four million more are not citizens at all. He states that a Jew from any country can move to Israel but a Palestinian refugee, with a valid claim to property in Israel, cannot. Munayyer also described the difficulties he and his wife faced when visiting the country.

===Arabic and Hebrew as official languages===

Arabic was until July 2018 one of Israel&#x27;s official languages. The use of Arabic increased significantly following Supreme Court rulings in the 1990s. Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People defines Hebrew as the official language of the State and gives the Arabic language a special status.

Government ministries publish all material intended for the public in Hebrew, with selected material translated into Arabic, English, Russian, and other languages spoken in Israel. There are laws that secure the Arab population&#x27;s right to receive information in Arabic. Some examples include a portion of the public television channels&#x27; productions must be in Arabic or translated into Arabic, safety regulations in working places must be published in Arabic if a significant number of the workers are Arabs, information about medicines or dangerous chemicals must be provided in Arabic, and information regarding elections must be provided in Arabic. The country&#x27;s laws are published in Hebrew, and eventually English and Arabic translations are published. Publishing the law in Hebrew in the official gazette (&quot;Reshumot&quot;) is enough to make it valid. Unavailability of an Arabic translation can be regarded as a legal defense only if the defendant proves he could not understand the meaning of the law in any conceivable way. Following appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court, the use of Arabic on street signs and labels increased dramatically. In response to one of the appeals presented by Arab Israeli organizations, the Supreme Court ruled that although second to Hebrew, Arabic is an official language of the State of Israel, and should be used extensively. Today most highway signage is trilingual (Hebrew, Arabic, and English).

Many Arab villages lack street signs of any kind and the Hebrew name is often used. The state&#x27;s schools in Arab communities teach in Arabic according to a specially adapted curriculum. This curriculum includes mandatory lessons of Hebrew as foreign language from the 3rd grade onwards. Arabic is taught in Hebrew-speaking schools, but only the basic level is mandatory. In the summer of 2008, there was an unsuccessful attempt of right-wing lawmakers to strip Arabic of its status alongside Hebrew as an official language of the state.

===Israeli national symbols===

Some Arab politicians have requested a reevaluation of the Israeli flag and national anthem, arguing that the Star of David at the flag&#x27;s center is an exclusively Jewish symbol, and Hatikvah does not represent Arab citizens, since it speaks of the Jewish people&#x27;s desire to return to their homeland. The High Follow-Up Committee for Arab Citizens of Israel and the National Committee for the Heads of the Arab Local Authorities in Israel stated in 2006,

Michael Oren, the former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, has argued that since the Seal of Solomon (Star of David) is also considered to be an Islamic symbol, Arab citizens of Israel should be able to feel the same sense of loyalty to the flag as Jewish citizens do.

===Independence Day===
In Israel, Independence Day takes place on 5 Iyar according to the Hebrew calendar, which means it falls on different dates every year under the Gregorian calendar. Arab citizens of Israel generally mark al-Nakba both on this day, and on 15 May, as do other Palestinians. Druze soldiers, however, were present at Israel&#x27;s first Independence Day Parade in 1949, and there have since been parades for Druze and Circassians, as well as special events for Bedouins, on Independence Day.

In January 2008, the mayor of Shefa-&#x27;Amr, Ursan Yassin, met with officials of the Israeli state committee on the celebrations for the 60th anniversary of independence and announced that Shefa-&#x27;Amr intended to take part in the celebrations. He stated: &quot;This is our country and we completely disapprove of the statements made by the Higher Monitoring Committee. I want to hold a central ceremony in Shefa-&#x27;Amr, raise all the flags and have a huge feast. The 40,000 residents of Shefa-&#x27;Amr feel that they are a part of the State of Israel...The desire to participate in the festivities is shared by most of the residents. We will not raise our children to hate the country. This is our country and we want to live in coexistence with its Jewish residents.&quot;

===Citizenship===
====Barriers for East Jerusalem Palestinians====
As of 2022, only 5% of East Jerusalem Palestinians had Israeli citizenship, despite Israel&#x27;s having unilaterally annexed the area in 1967. From 1967 to 1974 hundreds per year became Israeli, which the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research attributes to then-lax Israeli policy, also noting that by the mid-1970s, Palestinian society started to disapprove of becoming Israeli, seeing it as complicit with or collaborating with Israeli occupation. Since 2005, the Israeli West Bank barrier that separates them from Palestinians in the West Bank has changed education and employment markets, and the taboo has weakened — (Israeli citizenship no longer seen as detracting from being Palestinian. However, Israel&#x27;s Population and Immigration Authority made the process more difficult. From 2002 to 2021, only 34% of naturalization applications were approved, and the process may take years. Israel may justify the rejection for any of a wide variety of reasons such as a family member owning land or having a utility bill in the West Bank, posting the Palestinian flag or mentioning the Nakba on social media, a past failed Hebrew proficiency test, refusal to renounce Jordanian citizenship, minor criminal charges, or &quot;security impediments&quot;. Non-citizens cannot vote in Israeli legislative elections; to travel abroad they must get a &quot;laissez passer&quot;, many jobs are closed to them, and Israel can at any time revoke their residency status, whereby they lose their health insurance, their right to enter Jerusalem, and thus usually also their source of income.

====2003 Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law====
On 31 July 2003, Israel enacted the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Provision), 5763–2003, a one-year amendment to Israel&#x27;s Citizenship Law denying citizenship and Israeli residence to Palestinians who reside in the West Bank or Gaza Strip and who marry Israelis; the rule has been waived for any Palestinian &quot;who identifies with the State of Israel and its goals, when he or a member of his family has taken concrete action to advance the security, economy or any other matter important to the State&quot;. Defenders of the Citizenship and Entry Law say it is aimed at preventing terrorist attacks and preserving the &quot;Jewish character&quot; of Israel by restricting Arab immigration. The new bill was formulated in accordance with Shin Bet statistics showing that involvement in terror attacks declines with age. This newest amendment, in practice, removes restrictions from half of the Palestinian population requesting legal status through marriage in Israel. This law was upheld by a High Court decision in 2006.

=====Discriminatory/racist character=====
Although this law theoretically applies to all Israelis, it has disproportionately affected Arab citizens of Israel; Arabs are far more likely to have Palestinian spouses than other Israelis. Thus the law has been widely considered discriminatory and the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has unanimously approved a resolution saying that the Israeli law violated an international human rights treaty against racism.

=====Extensions and current status quo=====
Upon expiration the law was extended for six months in August 2004, and again for four months in February 2005. On 8 May 2005, the Israeli ministerial committee for issues of legislation once again amended the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law, to restrict citizenship and residence in Israel only to Palestinian men over the age of 35, and Palestinian women over the age of 25.

The law expired in 2021 and about 12,700 Palestinians married to Israeli Arab citizens are able to apply for citizenship but Israel has delayed all family reunification requests, maintaining the status quo.

===Civil rights===

The Israeli Declaration of Independence stated that the State of Israel would ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex, and guaranteed freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture. While formally equal according to Israeli law, a number of official sources acknowledge that Arab citizens of Israel experience discrimination in many aspects of life. Israeli High Court Justice (Ret.) Theodor Or wrote in The Report by the State Commission of Inquiry into the Events of October 2000:
The Arab citizens of Israel live in a reality in which they experience discrimination as Arabs. This inequality has been documented in a large number of professional surveys and studies, has been confirmed in court judgments and government resolutions, and has also found expression in reports by the state comptroller and in other official documents. Although the Jewish majority&#x27;s awareness of this discrimination is often quite low, it plays a central role in the sensibilities and attitudes of Arab citizens. This discrimination is widely accepted, both within the Arab sector and outside it, and by official assessments, as a chief cause of agitation.

The Or Commission report also states that activities by Islamic organizations may be using religious pretenses to further political aims. The commission describes such actions as a factor in &#x27;inflaming&#x27; the Muslim population in Israel against the authorities, and cites the al-Sarafand mosque episode, with Muslims&#x27; attempts to restore the mosque and Jewish attempts to stop them, as an example of the &#x27;shifting of dynamics&#x27; of the relationship between Muslims and the Israeli authorities.

According to the 2004 U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Israel and the Occupied Territories, the Israeli government had done &quot;little to reduce institutional, legal, and societal discrimination against the country&#x27;s Arab citizens&quot;.

&quot;The 2004 U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices&quot; notes that:
* &quot;Israeli-Arab advocacy organizations have challenged the Government&#x27;s policy of demolishing illegal buildings in the Arab sector, and claimed that the Government was more restrictive in issuing building permits in Arab communities than in Jewish communities, thereby not accommodating natural growth.&quot;
* &quot;In June, the Supreme Court ruled that omitting Arab towns from specific government social and economic plans is discriminatory. This judgment builds on previous assessments of disadvantages suffered by Arab Israelis.&quot;
* &quot;Israeli-Arab organizations have challenged as discriminatory the 1996 &quot;Master Plan for the Northern Areas of Israel,&quot; which listed as priority goals increasing the Galilee&#x27;s Jewish population and blocking the territorial contiguity of Arab towns.&quot;
* &quot;Israeli Arabs were not required to perform mandatory military service and, in practice, only a small percentage of Israeli Arabs served in the military. Those who did not serve in the army had less access than other citizens to social and economic benefits for which military service was a prerequisite or an advantage, such as housing, new-household subsidies, and employment, especially government or security-related industrial employment. The Ivri Committee on National Service has issued official recommendations to the Government that Israel Arabs not be compelled to perform national or &#x27;civic&#x27; service, but be afforded an opportunity to perform such service.&quot;
* &quot;According to a 2003 University of Haifa study, a tendency existed to impose heavier prison terms to Arab citizens than to Jewish citizens. Human rights advocates claimed that Arab citizens were more likely to be convicted of murder and to have been denied bail.&quot;
* &quot;The Orr Commission of Inquiry&#x27;s report ... stated that the &#x27;Government handling of the Arab sector has been primarily neglectful and discriminatory,&#x27; that the Government &#x27;did not show sufficient sensitivity to the needs of the Arab population, and did not take enough action to allocate state resources in an equal manner.&#x27; As a result, &#x27;serious distress prevailed in the Arab sector in various areas. Evidence of distress included poverty, unemployment, a shortage of land, serious problems in the education system, and substantially defective infrastructure.

&quot;The 2007 U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices&quot; notes that:
* &quot;According to a 2005 study at Hebrew University, three times more money was invested in education of Jewish children as in Arab children.&quot;

Human Rights Watch has charged that cuts in veteran benefits and child allowances based on parents&#x27; military service discriminate against Arab children: &quot;The cuts will also affect the children of Jewish ultra-orthodox parents who do not serve in the military, but they are eligible for extra subsidies, including educational supplements, not available to Palestinian Arab children.&quot;

According to &quot;the Guardian&quot;, in 2006 just 5% of civil servants were Arabs, many of them hired to deal with other Arabs, despite the fact that Arab citizens of Israel comprise 20% of the population.

Although the Bedouin infant mortality rate is still the highest in Israel, and one of the highest in the developed world, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reports that in the 2002 budget, Israel&#x27;s health ministry allocated Arab communities less than 1% of its budget for healthcare facility development.

In March 2010, a report released by several Israeli civil rights groups stated that the current Knesset was &quot;the most racist in Israeli history&quot; with 21 bills proposed in 2008 and 2009 that would discriminate against the country&#x27;s Arab minority.

A preliminary report commissioned by Israel&#x27;s Courts Administration and the Israel Bar Association found in 2011 that Israeli Arabs are more likely than Israeli Jews to be convicted of crimes after being charged, more likely to be given custodial sentences, and were given longer sentences. It did not account for &quot;mitigating or aggravating circumstances, prior criminal record and the convict&#x27;s gender&quot;.

===Property ownership and housing===

The Jewish National Fund (JNF) is a private organization established in 1901 to buy and develop land in the Land of Israel for Jewish settlement; land purchases were funded by donations from world Jewry exclusively for that purpose. The JNF currently owns 13% of land in Israel, while 80% is owned by the government, and the rest, around 7%, is evenly divided between private Arab and Jewish owners. Thus, the Israel Land Administration (ILA) administers 94% of the land in Israel. A significant portion of JNF lands were originally properties left behind by Palestinian &quot;absentees&quot; and as a result the legitimacy of some JNF land ownership has been a matter of dispute. The JNF purchased these lands from the State of Israel between 1949 and 1953, after the state took control of them according to the Absentee Properties Law. While the JNF charter specifies the land is for the use of the Jewish People, land has been leased to Bedouin herders. Nevertheless, JNF land policy has been criticized as discrimination. When the ILA leased JNF land to Arabs, it took control of the land in question and compensated the JNF with an equivalent amount of land in areas not designated for development (generally in the Galilee and the Negev), thus ensuring that the total amount of land owned by the JNF remains the same. This was a complicated and controversial mechanism, and in 2004 use of it was suspended. After Supreme Court discussions and a directive by the Attorney General instructing the ILA to lease JNF land to Arabs and Jews alike, in September 2007 the JNF suggested reinstating the land-exchange mechanism.

While the JNF and the ILA view an exchange of lands as a long-term solution, opponents say that such maneuvers privatize municipal lands and preserve a situation in which significant lands in Israel are not available for use by all of its citizens. As of 2007, the High Court delayed ruling on JNF policy regarding leasing lands to non-Jews, and changes to the ILA-JNF relationship were up in the air. Adalah and other organizations furthermore express concern that proposed severance of the relation between the ILA and JNF, as suggested by Ami Ayalon, would leave the JNF free to retain the same proportion of lands for Jewish uses as it seeks to settle hundreds of thousands of Jews in areas with a tenuous Jewish demographic majority (in particular, 100,000 Jews in existing Galilee communities and 250,000 Jews in new Negev communities via the Blueprint Negev).

The Israel Land Administration, which administers 93% of the land in Israel (including the land owned by the Jewish National Fund), refuses to lease land to non-Jewish foreign nationals, who include Palestinian residents of Jerusalem who have identity cards but are not citizens of Israel. When ILA land is &quot;bought&quot; in Israel it is actually leased to the &quot;owner&quot; for a period of 49 years. According to article 19 of the ILA lease, foreign nationals are excluded from leasing ILA land, and in practice foreigners may just show that they qualify as Jewish under the Law of Return.

Israeli law also discriminates between Jewish and Arab residents of Jerusalem regarding rights to recover property owned before the dislocations created by the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The 1950 Absentees Property Law said that any property within post-war Israel which was owned by an Arab who had left the country between 29 November 1947 and 19 May 1948, or by a Palestinian who had merely been abroad or in area of Palestine held by hostile forces up to 1 September 1948, lost all rights to that property. Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes by Jewish or Israeli forces, before and during the 1948 Arab–Israeli war, but remained within the borders of what would become Israel, that is, those currently known as Arab citizens of Israel, are deemed present absentees by the legislation. Present absentees are regarded as absent by the Israeli government because they left their homes, even if they did not intend to leave them for more than a few days, and even if they did so involuntarily.

Following the 1967 Six-Day War in which Israel occupied the West Bank, from where it annexed East Jerusalem, Israel then passed in 1970 the &quot;Law and Administration Arrangements Law&quot; allowing for Jews who had lost property in East Jerusalem and the West Bank during the 1948 war to reclaim it. Palestinian residents of Jerusalem (absentees) in the same positions, and Arab Israelis (present absentees), who owned property in West Jerusalem or other areas within the state of Israel, and lost it as a result of the 1948 war, cannot recover their properties. Israeli legislation, therefore, allows Jews to recover their land, but not Arabs.

In the early 2000s, several community settlements in the Negev and the Galilee were accused of barring Arab applicants from moving in. In 2010, the Knesset passed legislation that allowed admissions committees to function in smaller communities in the Galilee and the Negev, while explicitly forbidding committees to bar applicants based on the basis of race, religion, sex, ethnicity, disability, personal status, age, parenthood, sexual orientation, country of origin, political views, or political affiliation. Critics, however, say the law gives the privately run admissions committees a wide latitude over public lands, and believe it will worsen discrimination against the Arab minority.

===Contesting allegations of discrimination===
While groups are not separated by official policy, Israel has a number of different sectors within the society that maintain their strong cultural, religious, ideological, and/or ethnic identity. The Israeli foreign ministry maintains that in spite of the existing social cleavages and economic disparities, the political systems and the courts represent strict legal and civic equality. The Israeli foreign ministry in 2006 described the country as: &quot;Not a melting-pot society, but rather more of a mosaic made up of different population groups coexisting in the framework of a democratic state&quot;.

According to Ishmael Khaldi, an Arab citizen of Israel and the nation&#x27;s first high-ranking Muslim in the Israeli foreign service, while Israeli society is far from perfect, minorities in Israel fare far better than any other country in the Middle East. He wrote:

===Opposition to intermarriage===
Intermarriage is prohibited by the Jewish Halakha. In the case of mixed Arab-Jewish marriages, emotions run especially high. A 2007 poll found that more than half of Israeli Jews believed intermarriage was equivalent to national treason. Around 2009 a group of Jewish men in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev started patrolling the neighborhood to stop Jewish women from dating Arab men. In 2008 the municipality of Petah Tikva had a telephone hotline for friends and family to report Jewish girls who date Arab men as well as psychologists to provide counselling. The city of Kiryat Gat launched a campaign in schools to warn Jewish girls against dating local Bedouin men.

A 2015 survey found that 82% of Israeli Muslims, 87% of Israeli Druze, and 88% of Israeli Christians would be uncomfortable with a child of theirs marrying a Jew. 97% of Israeli Jews would be uncomfortable if a child of theirs married a Muslim and 89% would be uncomfortable if a child of theirs married a Christian.

In 2018, Arab-Israeli journalist Lucy Aharish married Jewish-Israeli actor Tzachi HaLevy, triggering a public controversy. A number of Israeli right-wing politicians, such as Oren Hazan, criticized HaLevy&#x27;s marriage to an Arab Muslim woman as &quot;assimilation&quot; while many members of the Knesset, including other government officials, congratulated the couple and dismissed their colleagues as racist.

===Knesset===
The Mossawa Center – an advocacy organization for Arabs in Israel – blames the Knesset of discrimination against Arabs, citing a 75% increase in discriminatory and racist bills submitted to the Knesset in the year 2009. According to the report, 11 bills deemed by the center to be &quot;discriminatory and racist&quot; were placed on the legislature&#x27;s table in 2007, while 12 such bills were initiated in 2008. However, in 2009 a full 21 bills deemed discriminatory by the Mossawa Center were discussed in the Knesset.

The reports categorizes as &quot;racist&quot; proposals such as giving academic scholarships to soldiers who served in combat units, and a bill to revoke government funding from organizations acting &quot;against the principles of the State&quot;. The Coalition Against Racism and the Mossawa Center said that the proposed legislation seeks to de-legitimize Israel&#x27;s Arab citizens by decreasing their civil rights.

==Economic status==

In 2011, Nazareth had over 20 Arab-owned high-tech companies, mostly in the field of software development. According to the &quot;Haaretz&quot; newspaper the city has been called the &quot;Silicon Valley of the Arab community&quot; in view of its potential in this sphere.

Inequality in the allocation of public funding for Jewish and Arab needs, and widespread employment discrimination, present significant economic hurdles for Arab citizens of Israel. On the other hand, the Minorities at Risk (MAR) group states that &quot;despite obvious discrimination, Israeli Arabs are relatively much better off economically than neighboring Arabs.&quot;

The predominant feature of the Arab community&#x27;s economic development after 1949 was its transformation from a predominantly peasant farming population to a proletarian industrial workforce. It has been suggested that the economic development of the community was marked by distinct stages. The first period, until 1967, was characterised by this process of proletarianisation. From 1967 on, economic development of the population was encouraged and an Arab bourgeoisie began to develop on the margin of the Jewish bourgeoisie. From the 1980s on, the community developed its economic and, in particular, industrial potential.

In July 2006, the Government categorized all Arab communities in the country as &#x27;class A&#x27; development areas, thus making them eligible for tax benefits. This decision aims to encourage investments in the Arab sector.

Raanan Dinur, director-general of Prime Minister office, said in December 2006 that Israel had finalized plans to set up a NIS 160 million private equity fund to help develop the businesses of the country&#x27;s Arab community over the next decade. According to Dinur, companies owned by Arab citizens of Israel will be eligible to apply to the fund for as much as NIS 4 million (US$952,000), enabling as many as 80 enterprises to receive money over the next 10 years. The Israeli government will, according to Dinur, solicit bids to operate the fund from various financial institutes and private firms, which must pledge to raise at least NIS 80 million (about US$19 million) from private investors.

In February 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that 53 percent of the impoverished families in Israel were Arabs. Since the majority of Arabs in Israel do not serve in the army, they are ineligible for many financial benefits such as scholarships and housing loans.

Arab towns in Israel are reluctant to collect city taxes from their residents. Sikkuy, a prominent Arab-Jewish NGO, found that Arabs as a group have the highest home ownership in Israel: 93% compared to 70% among Jews.

While per capita income is lower in the Arab community, these figures do not take into account age (the average age in the Arab community is lower and young people earn less), the low percentage of women who join the workforce, and the large size of Arab families.

In 2005, of the 40 towns in Israel with the highest unemployment rates, 36 were Arab towns. According to the Central Bank of Israel statistics for 2003, salary averages for Arab workers were 29% lower than for Jewish workers. Difficulties in procuring employment have been attributed to a comparatively low level of education vis-a-vis their Jewish counterparts, insufficient employment opportunities in the vicinity of their towns, discrimination by Jewish employers, and competition with foreign workers in fields, such as construction and agriculture. Arab women have a higher unemployment rate in the work force relative to both religious and secular Jewish women. While among Arab men the employment was found to be on par with Jewish men, 17% of Arab women were found to be employed. This puts the Arab employment at 68% of the Israeli average. The Druze and Christian Arabs have higher employment than Muslims.

Imad Telhami, founder and CEO of Babcom, a call center in the Tefen Industrial Park with 300 employees, is committed to developing career opportunities for Arab workers in Israel. Telhami, a Christian Arab, was a senior executive at the Delta Galil Industries textile plant before establishing Babcom. He hopes to employ 5,000 workers within five years: &quot;Israeli companies have been exporting thousands of jobs to India, Eastern Europe and other spots around the globe. I want to bring the jobs here. There are terrific engineers in the Arab sector, and the potential is huge.

In March 2010, the government approved a $216 million, five-year development plan for the Israeli Arab sector with the goal of increasing job accessibility, particularly for women and academics. Under this program, some 15,000 new employees will be added to the work roster by 2014.

By the 2010s, the Israeli-Arab standard of living was found to be improving, with the number of middle class Arabs growing. In 2017, &quot;Haaretz&quot;, which termed Arabs as Israel&#x27;s &quot;new yuppies&quot;, reported that Arabs, especially women, were pursuing higher education in increasing numbers, and increasingly seeking white-collar jobs. According to Professor Aziz Haidar of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in 2017 about 27% of Arabs were middle class (as opposed to 17% two decades before) and 3% were wealthy, and although most Arabs were still in lower-income brackets, the Arab middle class is expanding dramatically.

Across all groups, Arab Christians tend to be the most educated, and most of them are middle and upper middle class, and they have the lowest incidence of poverty and the lowest percentage of unemployment; a study published by the Taub Center for Social Policy Studies in 2017 found that &quot;Christian population has the highest achievements in the Arab sector on all indices: bagrut scores, rates of college graduates, and fields of employment&quot;. The study found also that the achievements of the Druze are mixed, and they have the second highest achievements in the Arab sector on all indices. While Bedouins has the lowest achievements in the Arab sector on all indices, as they tend to be the least educated.

==Health==

The most common health-related causes of death are heart disease and cancer. Roughly 14% were diagnosed with diabetes in 2000. Around half of all Arab men smoke. Life expectancy has increased 27 years since 1948. Further, due largely to improvements in health care, the Arab infant mortality rate dropped from 32 deaths per thousand births in 1970 to 8.6 per thousand in 2000. However, the Bedouin infant mortality rate is still the highest in Israel, and one of the highest in the developed world.

In 2003, the infant mortality rate among Arab citizens overall was 8.4 per thousand, more than twice as high as the rate 3.6 per thousand among the Jewish population. In the 2002 budget, Israel&#x27;s health ministry allocated Arab communities less than 1% of its 277 m-shekel (£35m) budget (1.6 m shekels {£200,000}) to develop healthcare facilities.

Nazareth have three private hospitals serving its districts: The Nazareth Hospital (also called the English Hospital), French Nazareth Hospital, and the Italian Nazareth Hospital. All of these hospitals run by the Christian community of Nazareth. The Christian Arab community run also the Italian Hospital in Haifa.

Despite the fact that Arab represent 20% of the total Israeli population, in 2015 they accounted 35% of all doctors in Israel, and according to a study by the Tel Aviv University Arabs account about 35% of all pharmacists in Israel. The Arabic local council Arraba has one of the highest numbers of doctors per capita in the world.

==Education==
The Israeli government regulates and finances most of the schools operating in the country, including the majority of those run by private organizations. The school system has two branches, Hebrew-speaking and Arabic-speaking. The curricula for the two systems are almost identical in mathematics, sciences, and English. It is different in humanities (history, literature, etc.). Hebrew is taught in Arabic schools from third grade and obligatory for Arabic-speaking school&#x27;s matriculation exams, a basic knowledge of Arabic is taught in Hebrew schools, usually from the 7th to the 9th grade. Arabic is not obligatory for Hebrew speaking school&#x27;s matriculation exams. The schooling language split operates from preschool to the end of high school. At the university level, they merge into a single system, which operates mostly in Hebrew and in English.

In 2001, Human Rights Watch described government-run Arab schools as &quot;a world apart from government-run Jewish schools.&quot; The report found striking differences in virtually every aspect of the education system.

In 2005, the Follow-Up Committee for Arab Education said that the Israeli government spent an average of $192 a year on Arab students compared to $1,100 for Jewish students. The drop-out rate for Arabs was twice as high as for Jews (12% versus 6%). There was a 5,000-classroom shortage in the Arab sector.

According to the 2004 U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Israel and the occupied territories, &quot;Israeli Arabs were underrepresented in the student bodies and faculties of most universities and in higher professional and business ranks. Well educated Arabs often were unable to find jobs commensurate with their level of education. According to Sikkuy, Arab citizens held approximately 60 to 70 of the country&#x27;s 5,000 university faculty positions.&quot;

Arab educators have long voiced concerns over institutionalized budgetary discrimination. An August 2009 study published by the Hebrew University&#x27;s School of Education claimed that Israel&#x27;s Education Ministry discriminated against Arabs in its allocations of special assistance for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds and the average per-student allocation at Arab junior high schools was one-fifth the average at Jewish ones. This was due to the allocation method: funds were first divided between Arab and Jewish school systems according to the number of students in each, and then allocated to needy students; however, due to the large proportion of such students in the Arab sector, they receive less funds, per student, than Jewish students. The Ministry of Education said it was discontinuing this method in favor of a uniform index. Ministry data on the percentage of high school students who passed their matriculation exams showed that Arab towns were ranked lowest except for Fureidis, which had the third highest pass rate (76%) in Israel.

According to the study by Hanna David from the University of Tel Aviv, Arab Christian schools in Israel are among the best schools in the country, and while those schools represent only 4% of the Arab schooling sector, about 34% of Arab university students come from Christian schools, and about 87% of the Israeli Arabs in the high tech sector have been educated in Arab Christian schools. These 47 Arab Christian schools accommodate 33,000 Christian students, Muslims, Druze and some Jews from across the country.

===Higher education===

Nearly half of Arab students who passed their matriculation exams failed to win a place in higher education because they performed poorly in the Psychometric Entrance Test, compared to 20% of Jewish applicants. Khaled Arar, a professor at Beit Berl College, believes the psychometric test is culturally biased: &quot;The gap in psychometric scores between Jewish and Arab students has remained steady – at more than 100 points out of a total of 800 – since 1982. That alone should have raised suspicions.&quot;

However, a 1986 research found negligible differences in construct or predictive test validity across varying cultural groups and the findings appeared to be more consistent with the psychometric than with the cultural bias position.

According to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics census in 2020, 83.6% of Christians were entitled to a matriculation certificate, followed by Druze (79.9%), and Muslims (60.3%). While 80.2% of the Israeli Jews were entitled to a matriculation certificate.

Statistically, Christian Arabs in Israel have the highest rates of educational attainment among all religious communities, according to a data by Israel Central Bureau of Statistics in 2010, 63% of Israeli Christian Arabs have had college or postgraduate education, the highest of any religious and ethno-religious group. According to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics census in 2020, 70.9% of Christians in Israel have a college degree, followed by Druze (15.3%), and Muslims (10%).

Among Israeli higher education institutions the University of Haifa has the largest percentage (41%) of Arab-Israeli students. The Technion Israel Institute of Technology has the second largest percentage (22.2%) of Arab-Israeli students.

==Military conscription==
Unlike their Jewish counterparts, Arab citizens are not required to serve in the Israeli military, and, outside the Bedouin community, very few (around 120 a year) volunteer. Until 2000, each year between 5–10% of the Bedouin population of draft age volunteered for the Israeli army, and Bedouin were well known for their unique status as volunteers. The legendary Israeli soldier, Amos Yarkoni, first commander of the Shaked Reconnaissance Battalion in the Givati Brigade, was a Bedouin (born &quot;Abd el-Majid Hidr&quot;). Bedouin soldiers dominate the elite human tracking units that guard Israel&#x27;s northern and southern border. Lieutenant Colonel Magdi Mazarib, a Bedouin, who is the Israeli army&#x27;s highest-ranking tracking commander, told the AFP that he believes that &quot;the state of Bedouin in Israel is better, as far as the respect we get, our progress, education&quot;. In 2004 the number of Bedouin in the army may have been be less than 1%. A 2003 report stated that willingness among Bedouin to serve in the army had drastically dropped in recent years, as the Israeli government has failed to fulfill promises of equal service provision to Bedouin citizens. However, a 2009 article in Haaretz stated that volunteer recruitment for a crack elite Bedouin army unit rose threefold.

IDF figures indicate that, in 2002 and 2003, Christians represented 0.1 percent of all recruits. In 2004, the number of recruits had doubled. Altogether, in 2003, the percentage of Christians serving had grown by 16 percent over the year 2000. The IDF does not publish figures on the exact number of recruits by religious denomination, and in 2005 it was estimated that a few dozen Christians currently served in the IDF.

The Druze are required to serve in the IDF in accordance with an agreement between their local religious leaders and the Israeli government in 1956. Opposition to the decision among the Druze populace was evident immediately, but was unsuccessful in reversing the decision. Many Druze in the IDF become officers and some rising to general officer rank. In recent years, a growing minority from within the Druze community have denounced this mandatory enrollment, and refused to serve. In 2001, Said Nafa, who identifies as a Palestinian Druze and serves as the head of the Balad party&#x27;s national council, founded the &quot;Pact of Free Druze&quot;, an organization that aims &quot;to stop the conscription of the Druze and claims the community is an inalienable part of the Arabs in Israel and the Palestinian nation at large&quot;.

===National service===
Rather than perform army service, Israeli Arab youths have the option to volunteer to national service and receive benefits similar to those received by discharged soldiers. The volunteers are generally allocated to Arab populations, where they assist with social and community matters. there are 1,473 Arabs volunteering for national service. According to sources in the national service administration, Arab leaders are counseling youths to refrain from performing services to the state. According to a National Service official: &quot;For years the Arab leadership has demanded, justifiably, benefits for Arab youths similar to those received by discharged soldiers. Now, when this opportunity is available, it is precisely these leaders who reject the state&#x27;s call to come and do the service, and receive these benefits.&quot;

==Intercommunal relations==
===Surveys and polls===
In a 2004 survey by Sammy Smooha of the University of Haifa Jewish-Arab Center, 85% of Israeli Arabs stated that Israel has a right to exist as an independent state, and 70% that it has a right to exist as a democratic, Jewish state. A Truman Institute survey from 2005 found that 63% of the Arab citizens accepted the principle that Israel is the state of the Jewish people.

A 2006 poll by the Arab advocacy group &quot;the Center Against Racism&quot; showed negative attitudes towards Arabs. The poll found that 63% of Jews believe Arabs are a security threat; 68% would refuse to live in the same building as an Arab; 34% believe that Arab culture is inferior to Israeli culture. Support for segregation between Jewish and Arab citizens was higher among Jews of Middle Eastern origin.

In a 2006 patriotism survey, 56% of Israeli Arabs were not proud of their citizenship and 73% were not ready to fight to defend the state, but 77% said that Israel was better than most other countries and 53% were proud of the country&#x27;s welfare system. Eighty-two percent said they would rather be a citizen of Israel than of any other country in the world.

An Israeli Democracy Institute (IDI) poll in 2007 showed that 75% of &quot;Israeli Arabs would support a constitution that maintained Israel&#x27;s status as a Jewish and democratic state while guaranteeing equal rights for minorities, while 23% said they would oppose such a definition&quot;. Another survey that year showed that 62% of Israel&#x27;s Arabs would prefer to remain Israeli citizens rather than become citizens of a future Palestinian state. A separate 2008 poll found that 77% would rather live in Israel than in any other country in the world. Another 2007 poll by Sammy Smooha found that 63% of Jewish Israelis avoided entering Arab towns and cities; 68% feared the possibility of widespread civil unrest among Israeli Arabs; 50% of Israeli Arabs justified Hezbollah&#x27;s capture of IDF reservists Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev in a cross-border raid; 19% thought Israel was justified in going to war following the kidnapping; 48% justified Hezbollah rocket attacks on northern Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War; 89% of Israeli Arabs saw the IDF bombing of Lebanon as a war crime, while 44% of Israeli Arabs viewed Hezbollah&#x27;s bombing of Israel as a war crime; 62% of Israeli Arabs worried that Israel could transfer their communities to the jurisdiction of a future Palestinian state, and 60% said they were concerned about a possible mass expulsion; 76% of Israeli Arabs described Zionism as racist; 68% of Israeli Arabs would be content to live in the Jewish state alongside a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip; 41% of Israeli Arab citizens denied the Holocaust ever happened.

In 2007, the &quot;Association for Civil Rights in Israel&quot; reported a &quot;dramatic increase&quot; in racism against Arab citizens, including a 26 percent rise in anti-Arab incidents. ACRI president Sami Michael said that &quot;Israeli society is reaching new heights of racism that damages freedom of expression and privacy&quot;.

A 2008 poll on intercommunal relations by Harvard Kennedy School found that Arabs and Jews in Israel underestimated the extent to which their communities &quot;liked&quot; one another. 68% of the Jews supported teaching Arabic in Jewish schools.

A 2008 poll by the Center Against Racism found that 75% of Israeli Jews would not live in a building with Arabs; over 60% would not invite Arabs to their homes; 40% believed that Arabs should be stripped of the right to vote; over 50% agreed that the state should encourage emigration of Arab citizens to other countries; 59% considered Arab culture primitive. Asked &quot;What do you feel when you hear people speaking Arabic?&quot; 31% said hate and 50% said fear. Only 19% reported positive or neutral feelings.

Surveys in 2009 found a radicalization in the positions of Israeli Arabs towards the State of Israel, with 41% of Israeli Arabs recognizing Israel&#x27;s right to exist as a Jewish and democratic state (down from 66% in 2003), and 54% believing Israel has a right to exist as an independent country (down from 81% in 2003). Polls also showed that 40% of Arab citizens engaged in Holocaust denial.

A 2010 poll of Israeli high school students found that 50% did not think Israeli Arabs were entitled to the same rights as Jews in Israel, and 56% thought Arabs should not be elected to the Knesset. The figures rose among religious students.

A 2010 Arab Jewish Relations Survey, compiled by Prof. Sami Smoocha in collaboration with the Jewish-Arab Center at the University of Haifa shows that 71% Arab citizens of Israel said they blamed Jews for the hardships suffered by Palestinians during and after the &quot;Nakba&quot; in 1948. 38% denied the Holocaust. The percentage supporting the use of violence to advance Arab causes climbed from 6% in 1995 to 12% in 2010. 66% say they reject Israel as a Jewish and Zionist state, while 30% opposed its existence under any terms. 63% saw the Jews as &quot;foreign settlers who do not fit into the region and will eventually leave, when the land will return to the Palestinians&quot;.

A 2010 University of Maryland / Zogby International poll of 600 Arab Israelis compiled by Shibley Telhami found that 36 percent considered their Arab identity to be &quot;most important&quot;, while 22% answered &quot;Palestinian&quot;, 19% Muslim, and 12% Israeli.

Amongst other things, a 2012 survey by Mada al-Carmel, the Arab Center for Applied Social Research, asked Arab students what obstacles they felt they faced in getting into university: 71% said the psychometric exam was the primary obstacle, while 40% cited &quot;Jewish racism&quot;. The survey also found that 45 percent of those questioned felt no pride in Israeli achievements in whatever field, with another 13% reporting negative feelings about them.

A Pew Research poll released in March 2016 showed that close to half of all Israeli Jews are in favor of &quot;transferring or expelling&quot; Israel&#x27;s Arab population. 48% of Israeli Jews strongly agree or agree with the idea, and 46% strongly disagree or disagree. The in-person polling was conducted in a relatively &quot;calm&quot; from late 2014 through early 2015.

In December 2022, support for a two-state solution was 33% among Palestinians, 34% among Israeli Jews, and 60% among Israeli Arabs. At the end of October 2023, after the Hamas-led attack on Israel, the two-state solution had the support of 71.9% of Israeli Arabs and 28.6% of Israeli Jews. According to a poll published by the Israel Democracy Institute, only 24% of Israeli Arabs believe that the IDF is trying to uphold international law in the war between Israel and Hamas.

In December 2023, during the Israel-Hamas war, the Druze were the Israeli Arab minority which most identified with the state of Israel (80%), followed by Christians (73%) and Muslims (62%). For residents of the Negev, most of whom are Bedouin, the figure was 73%.

===Involvement in terrorist attacks===
Because Israeli Arabs have Israeli citizenship, they have become increasingly targeted for recruitment as operatives by organizations that attack civilians. According to the Israeli General Security Service (Shabak), from 2001 to 2004, at the height of the Second Intifada, there were 102 cases where some Arab-Israelis were involved in some way in terrorist attacks killing hundreds of Israelis. In 2001, for example, passengers disembarking from a train in Nahariya were attacked by an Israeli Arab who killed 3 and wounded 90. In March 2007, two Israeli Arabs were convicted of manslaughter for smuggling a suicide bomber into Israel.

From 2000 to 2004, some 150 Arabs from East Jerusalem were arrested for participation in such attacks.

Hezbollah has taken advantage of family and criminal ties with Israeli-Arabs who can easily cross the border into Lebanon, meet with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, transfer weapons, drugs and money to Israel, gather intelligence and recruit operatives. This phenomenon is particularly widespread in the village of Ghajar. Arab citizens of Israel have been convicted of espionage for Hezbollah. Arab-Israeli terror cells have been established, such as a cell in Reineh whose members were arrested in February 2004.

===Violence against Arab citizens in Israel===
Alexander Yakobson of Jerusalem&#x27;s Hebrew University has said &quot;There is very little actual violence between Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs. Given the length and the intensity of the conflict, that is both surprising and encouraging.&quot;

In the 1956 Kafr Qasim massacre, 48 unarmed Arab citizens, returning to their village, were gunned down by an Israel Border Police platoon; a curfew had been imposed, but the villagers were not informed of it. Arab citizens have also been killed by Israeli security forces in the wake of violent demonstrations and riots, such as the March 1976 Land Day demonstrations, which left 6 dead, and the October 2000 events in which 12 Israeli Arabs and one Palestinian from Gaza were killed.

In 2005 an AWOL IDF soldier, Eden Natan-Zada opened fire in a bus in Shefa-Amr in northern Israel, murdering four Arabs and wounding twenty-two others. No group had taken credit for the terrorist attack and an official in the settler movement denounced it.

Arab activists have complained about the police abandoning Arab towns to intra communal violence at the hands of common criminals and murderers, calling for cooperation with Israeli police and internal security services under the slogan of &quot;Arab Lives Matter&quot;.

===Arab victims of terrorism===

Arab citizens have also been victims of Palestinian, Arab, or Islamist attacks on Israel and Israelis. For example, on 12 September 1956, three Druze guards were killed in an attack on Ein Ofarim, in the Arabah region. Two Arab citizens were killed in the Ma&#x27;alot massacre carried out by the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine on 15 May 1974. In March 2002, a resident of the Arab town of Tur&#x27;an was killed in an attack on a Haifa restaurant. Two months later, a woman from Jaffa was killed in a Hamas suicide bombing in Rishon LeZion. On 18 June 2002, a woman from the Arab border town of Barta&#x27;a was one of 19 killed by Hamas in the Pat Junction Bus Bombing in Jerusalem. In August 2002, a man from the Arab town of Mghar and woman from the Druze village of Sajur were killed in a suicide bombing at Meron junction. On 21 October 2002, an Isfiya man and a Tayibe woman were among 14 killed by Islamic Jihad in the Egged bus 841 massacre. On 5 March 2003, a 13-year-old girl from the Druze town of Daliyat al-Karmel was one of 17 killed in the Haifa bus 37 suicide bombing. In May 2003, a Jisr az-Zarqa man was killed in an Afula mall suicide bombing. On 19 March 2004, Fatah al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades gunmen killed George Khoury, a Hebrew University student. On 12 December 2004, five Arab IDF soldiers were killed in an explosion and shooting at the border with Egypt for which the Fatah Hawks claimed responsibility. On 4 October 2003, four Arab citizens of Israel were among the 21 killed by Hanadi Jaradat in the Maxim restaurant suicide bombing. In July 2006, 19 Arab citizens were killed due to Hezbollah rocket fire in the course of the 2006 Lebanon War.

On 22 August 2006, 11 Arab tourists from Israel were killed when their bus overturned in Egypt&#x27;s Sinai Peninsula. Israel sent Magen David Adom, but the ambulances waited for hours at the border before receiving Egyptian permission to enter and treat the wounded, responsible for at least one of the deaths. The victims say that the driver acted as part of a planned terrorist attack, and are attempting to receive compensation from the government.

==Relations with other Palestinians==
During the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, according to Al Arabiya, Fatah backed a call for a general strike on 18 May 2021 in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and Palestinians in Israel were asked to take part. In an unusual display of unity by &quot;Palestinian citizens of Israel, who make up 20% of its population, and those in the territories Israel seized in 1967&quot; the strike went ahead and &quot;shops were shuttered across cities in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and in villages and towns inside Israel&quot;.

==Culture==

Many Arab citizens of Israel share in the culture of the Palestinian people and wider Arab region of which many of them form a part. There are still some women who produce Palestinian cultural products such as Palestinian embroidery, and costume. The Palestinian folk dance, known as the dabke, continues to be taught to youth in cultural groups, and is often danced at weddings and other parties.

===Cultural centers===

As the largest Arab city in Israel, Nazareth is a cultural, political, economic and commercial center of the Arab citizens of Israel, and became also a center of Arab and Palestinian nationalism. Haifa, however, is the center of liberal Arabic-speaking culture, as it was under British colonial rule. Arabs in Haifa (mostly Christians and Muslims) tend to be wealthier and better educated compared to Arabs elsewhere in Israel. An active Arab cultural life has developed in the 21st century. Haifa is center of many Arab-owned businesses such as theaters, bars, cafes, restaurants and nightclubs which host also a different cultural discussions and art exhibitions.

Other centers of Arab and Palestinian cultures includes Kafr Yasif and Rameh. According to the historian Atallah Mansour, Kafr Yasif is the &quot;most academic Arab town in Israel&quot;, while journalist Sylvia Smith calls it &quot;the preeminent [Arab] cultural town&quot;. With the near total depopulation of the Palestinian Arabs in the major cities of Haifa and Jaffa as a result of the 1948 war, Kafr Yasif and Rameh became one of a few villages in the newly established state of Israel to emerge as a central space for Arab culture and politics. Its schools, proximity and location between major cities and other Arab villages, the relatively equal distribution of land ownership among its households and the diversity brought about by the influx of internally displaced Palestinians all contributed to its local importance.

In 1948, it was the only Arab locality in the Galilee to contain a high school outside of the cities of Nazareth, Shefa-Amr and Haifa. Following the war, the high school enrolled students from over fifty Arab villages. Several students, including Mahmoud Darwish, became well-known poets, and the village hosted weekly poetry recitals. As of the 1960s, the people of Rameh have been noted for their high levels of education and standards of living.

===Language===
Linguistically speaking, the majority of Arabic citizens of Israel are fluently bilingual, speaking both a Palestinian Arabic dialect and Hebrew. In Arab homes and towns, the primary language spoken is Arabic. Some Hebrew words have entered the colloquial Arabic dialect. For example, Arabs often use the word &quot;beseder&quot; (equivalent of &quot;Okay&quot;) while speaking Arabic. Other Hebrew words that are regularly interspersed are &quot;ramzor&quot; (stoplight), &quot;mazgan&quot; (air conditioner), and &quot;mahshev&quot; (computer). The resulting dialect is usually referred to as &#x27;Israeli Arabic&#x27;.

Such borrowings are often &quot;Arabized&quot; to reflect not only Arabic phonology but the phonology of Hebrew as spoken by Arabs. For example, the second consonant of מעונות (&quot;me&#x27;onot&quot;, &quot;dormitory&quot;) would be pronounced as a voiced pharyngeal fricative rather than the glottal stop traditionally used by the vast majority of Israeli Jews. A survey by the Central Bureau of Statistics released in 2013 found that 60% of Israeli Arabs were proficient or highly proficient in Hebrew, while 17% could not read it and 12% could not speak it.

There are different local colloquial dialects among Arabs in different regions and localities. For example, the Little Triangle residents of Umm al-Fahm are known for pronouncing the kaph sound with a &quot;ch&quot; (as-in-cheese) rather than &quot;k&quot; (as-in-kite). Some Arabic words or phrases are used only in their respective localities, such as the Nazareth word for &quot;now&quot; which is &quot;issa&quot;, and &quot;silema&quot; a local modification of the English word &quot;cinema&quot;. The Druze Arabic dialect, especially in the villages, is often different from the other regional Israeli Arabic dialects. Druze Arabic dialect is distinguished from others by retention of the phoneme /&quot;qāf&quot;/. They often use Hebrew characters to write their Arabic dialect online.

Arab citizens of Israel tend to watch both the Arab satellite news stations and Israeli cable stations and read both Arabic and Hebrew newspapers, comparing the information against one another.

===Music and art===
The Palestinian art scene in general has been supported by the contributions of Arab citizens of Israel. In addition to the contribution of artists such as singer Rim Banna (from Nazareth) and Amal Murkus (from Kafr Yasif) to evolving traditional Palestinian and Arabic music styles, a new generation of Arab youth in Israel has also begun asserting a Palestinian identity in new musical forms. For instance of the Palestinian hip hop group DAM, from Lod, has spurred the emergence of other hip hop groups from Akka, to Bethlehem, to Ramallah, to Gaza City. DAM is the first Palestinian hip hop group.

Singer-songwriter such as Nasrin Kadri, Mira Awad, Lina Makhul, Luay Ali, Sharif &quot;the druze boy&quot; have put Arab citizens of Israel on the musical map.

In the art scene, the Palestinian minority in Israel has asserted its identity according to Ben Zvi, who suggests that this group of artists who are identified &quot;on the one hand, as part of a broad Palestinian cultural system, and on the other — in a differentiated manner — as the Palestinian minority in Israel.&quot; The issue of identity becomes particularly clear in an artwork of the Palestinian artist Raafat Hattab from Jaffa. The video performance &quot;untitled&quot; was part of the exhibition &quot;Men in the Sun&quot; in the Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art in 2009. In the work, Raafat Hattab is seen as he pours water into a bucket in order to lengthily water an olive tree which is a sign for the lost paradise before 1948. The scene is primed by the song &quot;Hob&quot; (Love) by the Lebanese Ahmad Kaabour which expresses the need for Palestinian solidarity. The chorus repeats the phrase &quot;I left a place&quot; and it seems as if the video is dealing with memory. But as the camera zooms out, the spectator realizes that Hattab and the olive tree both actually stand in the middle of the Rabin Square, a main place in Tel Aviv, and the water used for watering the tree comes from the nearby fountain. &quot;In my installations I appear in different identities that combined are my identity — a Palestinian minority in Israel and a queer minority in the Palestinian culture&quot;, explains Rafaat Hattab in an interview with the Tel Avivian City Mouse Magazine. Asim Abu Shaqra&#x27;s focus of the sabra plant (prickly pear cactus) in his paintings is another example of the centrality of identity, especially vis-a-vie the Palestinian subject&#x27;s Israeli counterpart, in Palestinian art. Tal Ben Zvi writes that Abu Shaqra is one of the very few Palestinian artists, who have succeeded in entering the canon of Israeli art. Abu Shaqra painted various paintings featuring the sabra, both a symbol for the Palestinian Nakba and a symbol for the new Israeli and his work stirred up a debate in the Israeli art discourse over the image of the sabra in Israeli culture and over questions of cultural appropriation and ownership of this image.

===Cuisine===

Arab cuisine in Israel is similar to other Levantine cuisines and is rich in grains, meat, potato, cheese, bread, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, fresh fish and tomatoes. Perhaps the most distinctive aspect of Israeli Arab and Levantine cuisine is &quot;meze&quot; including &quot;tabbouleh&quot;, &quot;hummus&quot; and &quot;baba ghanoush&quot;, &quot;kibbeh nayyeh&quot; is also a popular mezze among Israeli Arabs. Other famous foods among Israeli Arab include falafel, sfiha, shawarma, dolma, kibbeh, kusa mahshi, shishbarak, muhammara, and mujaddara. Druze pita is a Druze-styled pita filled with labneh (thick yoghurt) and topped with olive oil and za&#x27;atar, and a very popular bread in Israel.

Arabic restaurants are popular in Israel and relatively inexpensive establishments often offer a selection of &quot;meze&quot; salads followed by grilled meat with a side of &quot;chips&quot; (french fries, from British English) and a simple dessert such as chocolate mousse for dessert. &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; is a popular Arab seafood restaurant in the southern part of Ajami, Jaffa. Abu Hassan is a small hummus restaurant located at the northern tip of Ajami. It was opened in 1959 by Ali Karawan and now has two additional branches in Jaffa. It has been rated as the best hummus restaurant in Israel in many lists. The restaurant is famous for its loyal clientele of Arabs and Jews.

Falafel HaZkenim (Hebrew: &quot;the elders&quot;) is an Arab Israeli restaurant and falafel stand, located in Wadi Nisnas, Haifa. Since its foundation, guests are greeted with a free falafel ball dipped in tahini. Foodies consider HaZkenim&#x27;s falafel among the best in Israel. It was founded in 1950 by George and Najala Afara. The falafel stand initially had no signage. Jewish customers often said that they would go to &quot;hazkenim&quot; (the old folks) for falafel, while Arab customers identified the place with the female co-owner. When the owners did put up a sign, it contained both names.

===Athletics===

Arab Citizens of Israel have been prominent in the field of Athletics, as seen specifically by their contributions to Israeli football. Players such as Abbas Suan have had illustrious careers playing not only professional football, but also most notably for the Israel national football team. These players have been argued to represent symbols of political movement and civil justice for the Arab Citizens of Israel, considering alleged discriminatory sentiments against the Arab population. Specifically in a 2005 World Cup Qualifying match, Suan and his Arab teammates played significant roles for the Israeli National Team, where Suan scored an equalising goal against the Republic of Ireland national football team. Following this match, Arab Citizens of Israel received unprecedented media attention from Israeli TV stations. Even without the publicity, the Arab Citizens of Israel have been said to look up to these players in hopes that they speak up for them as their political voice within Israel.
In the following months, Suan and other players were supposedly being criticised by the Hebrew Media for their involvement with political issues. This was due to their answers to questions regarding their partaking in the singing of the Hatikvah, the national anthem of Israel.

Overall, Israel-Palestinian soccer players are looked up to greatly by the Arab citizens of Israel, yet are allegedly criticised and silenced when it comes to their attempts to involve themselves in political issues surrounding equality for Arab Citizens in Israel.

===Cinema and theater===
Arab citizens of Israel have made significant contributions in both Hebrew and Arabic cinema and theater. Mohammad Bakri, Hiam Abbass. and Juliano Mer-Khamis have starred in Israeli film and television. Directors such as Mohammad Bakri, Elia Suleiman, Hany Abu-Assad, Michel Khleifi, and Maysaloun Hamoud have put Arab citizens of Israel on the cinematic map.

Avoda Aravit (2007), or in English, &quot;Arab Labor&quot;, is a satirical sitcom written by Kashua and aired on Israel&#x27;s Channel 2. A large part of the dialogue is in Arabic with Hebrew subtitles. The show holds a mirror up to the racism and ignorance on both sides of the ethnic divide and has been compared with &quot;All in the Family&quot;. The show received overwhelmingly positive reviews, winning awards for Best Comedy, Best Lead Actor in a Comedy, Best Lead Actress in a Comedy, Best Director, and Best Screenplay at the 2013 Israeli Academy of Film and Television awards.

<text>Kamehameha II (November 1797 – July 14, 1824) was the second king of the Kingdom of Hawaii from 1819 to 1824. His birth name was Liholiho and full name was Kalaninui kua Liholiho i ke kapu ʻIolani. It was lengthened to Kalani Kaleiʻaimoku o Kaiwikapu o Laʻamea i Kauikawekiu Ahilapalapa Kealiʻi Kauinamoku o Kahekili Kalaninui i Mamao ʻIolani i Ka Liholiho when he took the throne.

Due to his young age, his power was limited and he was controlled under Ka&#x27;ahumanu, the queen consort of his father Kamehameha I. However, Kamehameha II is disreputably known for the &#x27;Ai Noa, when he broke traditional religious laws, leading to a lengthened period of taboo-breaking, the disbanding of the social class of priest, and the destruction of temples and images. With increased European contact, Christianity and Western influence began to appear during his reign.

==Early life==
Kamehameha II was born in the month of Hanaiaʻeleʻele (corresponding to November) 1797 in Hilo, on the island of Hawaiʻi, the first born son of Kamehameha I with his highest-ranking wife Keōpuolani. It was originally planned that he would be born at the Kūkaniloko birth site on the island of Oʻahu but the Queen&#x27;s sickness prevented travel. 

Given in care to his father&#x27;s trusted servant Hanapi, who took the child to the lands of Kalaoa in Hilo Paliku, he was taken back, after five or six months, by his maternal grandmother Kekuʻiapoiwa Liliha because she felt he was not getting the right diet. Kamehameha I, then, put him in the care of Queen Kaʻahumanu (another wife of Kamehameha I), who was appointed as Liholiho&#x27;s official guardian.

Jean Baptiste Rives, a Frenchman about his age, arrived on the islands in the early 19th century. Rives taught the royal princes some English and French, becoming a close friend (&quot;ʻaikāne&quot;). Other companions included Charles Kanaʻina, Kekūanaōʻa and Laʻanui.

He was named Kalaninui kua Liholiho i ke kapu ʻIolani. &quot;Liholiho&quot; (meaning glowing), a contraction of &quot;Kalaninuiliholiho&quot; or &quot;Kalaninui kua Liholiho i ke kapu&quot; meant &quot;the great chief with the burning back kapu&quot;. &quot;ʻIolani&quot; meant &quot;royal hawk&quot; after the Hawaiian hawk (ʻio) whose high flight signified royalty.

==Ascension==
Liholiho officially inherited the throne upon Kamehameha I&#x27;s death in May 1819. However, Queen Kaʻahumanu had no intention to give him actual leadership. When Liholiho sailed toward the shores of Kailua-Kona (the capital at the time), she greeted him wearing Kamehameha&#x27;s royal red cape, and she announced to the people on shore and to the surprised Liholiho, &quot;We two shall rule the land.&quot; Liholiho, young and inexperienced, had no other choice. Kaʻahumanu became the first Kuhina Nui (co-regent) of Hawaii. He was forced to take on merely a ceremonial role; administrative power was to be vested in Kaʻahumanu. He took the title &quot;King Kamehameha II&quot;, but preferred to be called ʻIolani, which means &quot;heavenly (or royal) hawk&quot;.

==Reign==
Kamehameha II is best remembered for the &#x27;Ai Noa, the breaking of the ancient &quot;kapu&quot; (taboo) system of religious laws six months into his reign when he sat down with Kaʻahumanu and his mother Keopuolani and ate a meal together. The strict rules of the Hawaiian religion were no longer followed, leading to the traditional culture. 

Kamehameha I had bequeathed his war god Kūkaʻilimoku and his temples to his cousin Kekuaokalani. Kekuaokalani demanded that Liholiho withdraw his edicts against the Hawaiian priesthood, permit rebuilding of the temples, and dismiss both Kalanimōkū and Kaʻahumanu. Kamehameha II refused. At the battle of Kuamoʻo on the island of Hawaiʻi, the king&#x27;s better-armed forces, led by Kalanimōkū, defeated the last defenders of the Hawaiian gods, temples, and priesthoods of the ancient organized religion. The first Christian missionaries arrived only a few months later in the Hawaiian Islands.

He never officially converted to Christianity because he refused to give up four of his five wives and his love of alcohol. He (like his father) married several relatives of high rank, but he was the last Hawaiian king to practice polygamy. His favorite wife was his sister Kamāmalu. Kīnaʻu (Kamāmalu&#x27;s full-blood sister) was his second wife who would later remarry and become Kuhina Nui. Princess Kalani Pauahi was his niece by his half-brother Pauli Kaōleiokū. She later remarried and gave birth to Princess Ruth Keʻelikōlani. Kekāuluohi was half-sister of Kamāmalu and Kīnaʻu through their mother Kaheiheimālie who was another of his father&#x27;s wives. Princess Kekauʻōnohi was Liholiho&#x27;s niece and granddaughter of Kamehameha I, and would later become royal governor of the islands of Maui and Kauaʻi.
He was known to be impulsive. For example, on November 16, 1820 he bought a Royal Yacht known as Cleopatra&#x27;s Barge for 8000 piculs of sandalwood (over a million pounds), estimated to be worth about US$80,000 at the time. It had been sold a few years before for $15,400 by the Crowninshield family of Salem, Massachusetts. Kamehameha II was quite proud of his ship; in the words of Charles Bullard, the agent for the shipowner:

If you want to know how Religion stands at the Islands I can tell you — All sects are tolerated but the King worships the Barge.

He tried to gain favor with missionaries by offering free passage on the opulent ship, and regularly entertained foreign visitors with their choice of alcoholic beverages. On April 18, 1822 it required a major overhaul because most of the wood had rotted. He paid to have wood shipped in from the Pacific Northwest for repairs, and then renamed his ship &quot;Haʻaheo o Hawaiʻi&quot; (&quot;Pride of Hawaii&quot;). After re-launching May 10, 1823 it was wrecked less than a year later.

In the summer of 1821, he was in a small boat intended for the ʻEwa beach, just west of Honolulu. A few nobles such as Chiefess Kapiʻolani and Governor Boki were aboard, with about 30 men. He ordered the ship to instead cross a dangerous channel all the way to the island of Kauaʻi, despite having no compass, charts, nor provisions on board. They somehow made it to Kauaʻi. When they arrived, the local Chief Kaumualiʻi did not fire his cannons on the unarmed ship but welcomed the young king. The Royal Yacht was sent for, and the royal party entertained themselves for over a month. Then one night after he invited Kaumualiʻi on board, Kamehameha II abruptly ordered the yacht to sail in the night. Upon returning to Honolulu, he had Kaumualiʻi &quot;marry&quot; Kaʻahumanu and kept him under house arrest in exile until his death.

==Fatal visit to Great Britain==

Another of his voyages would prove fatal. On April 16, 1822 English missionary William Ellis arrived with a schooner &quot;Prince Regent&quot; of six guns to add to his growing collection of ships. It was a gift from George IV the King of Great Britain, and Kamehameha II wrote to thank him, requesting closer diplomatic ties. He wanted to travel to London, but all his advisors including Keōpūolani and Kaʻahumanu were opposed to the idea. After his mother Keōpūolani&#x27;s death on September 16, 1823, he made up his mind to go.

In November 1823 Kamehameha II and Queen Kamāmalu commissioned the British whaling ship (French for &quot;the Eagle&quot;) under Captain Valentine Starbuck to carry them to London. Going along were High Chief Boki and wife High Chiefess Kuini Liliha, and other chiefs and retainers including Manuia, Naihekukui, James Young Kānehoa, Kekūanaōʻa, Kauluhaimalama, Naʻaiweuweu, and Naukane who had already been to America (where he picked up the name John Coxe) and then England.

Since Ellis wanted to travel back to England anyway, he offered to be translator and guide, but Starbuck refused. Somehow Rives talked his way on board instead as translator.

In February 1824 they arrived at Rio de Janeiro in the newly independent Empire of Brazil. Emperor Pedro I received the visitors, presenting Kamehameha II with a ceremonial diamond-encrusted sword with a gold sheath, and in return accepting an ʻahu ʻula, a traditional feather cloak associated with high rank, which was lost in the 2018 fire at the National Museum of Brazil. Queen Kamāmalu received a diamond ring; in return, she offered a yellow feather necklace.
They arrived on May 17, 1824 in Portsmouth, and the next day moved into the Caledonian Hotel in London. Foreign Secretary George Canning appointed Frederick Gerald Byng (1784–1871) to supervise their visit. Byng was a Gentleman Usher, fifth son of John Byng, 5th Viscount Torrington and friend of Beau Brummell, known more for his gaudy fashions than diplomacy. Byng made sure they would have appropriate attire for all their public appearances.

Their arrival was met by the local press with a mixture of curiosity and derision. They were not sure what to call the king, spelling his &quot;Liholiho&quot; name various ways such as &quot;Rheo Rhio&quot;. Some made puns on the fact that Byng&#x27;s nickname was &quot;Poodle&quot; and in Hawaiian &quot;ʻīlio ʻīlio&quot; would mean &quot;dog of dogs&quot; and that the British name of the kingdom was &quot;Sandwich Islands&quot;. 

On May 28 a reception with 200 guests including several dukes was held in their honor. They toured London, visiting Westminster Abbey, but the king refused to enter because he did not want to desecrate the British royal burial place &quot;with his presence or his feet stepping in that area.&quot; They attended opera and ballet at Royal Opera House in Covent Garden on May 31, and the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane on June 4 in the Royal Box.
He and Kamāmalu were an unusual sight to the British people who had seen few Native Hawaiians, moreover, Kamāmalu was over six-feet tall. Several members of the court had portraits painted by the Hayter family.
King George IV finally scheduled a meeting for June 21, but it had to be delayed as Kamāmalu became ill. The Hawaiian court had caught measles, to which they had no immunity. They probably contracted the disease on their June 5 visit to the Royal Military Asylum (now the Duke of York&#x27;s Royal Military School). Kamāmalu died on July 8, 1824. The grief-stricken Kamehameha II died six days later on July 14, 1824.

Vast crowds lined up when he was laid in state at the Caledonian Hotel on July 17.
On July 18 the bodies were stored in the crypt of St Martin-in-the-Fields church where they awaited transportation back home. Boki took over lead of the delegation and finally did have an audience with King George IV. Kānehoa (James Young), with superior English language skills conferred by his English father John Young, was entrusted with the official letters of introduction and served as new translator. Rives and Starbuck were accused of misspending the royal treasury and departed.

In August 1824 the bodies returned to Hawaii on the enormous Royal Navy frigate under the command of Captain George Anson Byron.

The &quot;Blonde&quot; arrived back in Honolulu on May 6, 1825. Kalanimōkū had been notified of the deaths in a letter from Rives, so Hawaiian royalty gathered at his house where the bodies were moved for the funeral. The marines and crew from the ship made a formal procession, the ship&#x27;s chaplain read an Anglican prayer, and an American missionary was allowed to make a prayer in the Hawaiian language.
They were buried on the grounds of the ʻIolani Palace in a coral house meant to be the Hawaiian version of the tombs Liholiho had seen in London. They were eventually moved to the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii known as &quot;Mauna ʻAla&quot;. Kamehameha II was succeeded by his younger brother Kauikeaouli, who became King Kamehameha III.

<text>King&#x27;s College is a private Catholic university in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States. It is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and located within the Diocese of Scranton.

==History==

King&#x27;s College was founded in 1946 by Congregation of Holy Cross priests and brothers from the University of Notre Dame. The original mission of the college was to educate the sons of local miners and mill workers who lived in the Northeastern Pennsylvania region. The college&#x27;s Administration Building indicates the links to the coal mining industry: Built in 1913, it was designed by Daniel Burnham of Chicago to serve as the headquarters of the Lehigh Valley Coal Company.

The institution&#x27;s chapel, The Chapel of Christ the King, is located on West North Street. It features a 4,200-pound anthracite altar, highlighting the relationship between the coal industry and the institution. It was created for King&#x27;s in 1954 by renowned African-American sculptor and Wilkes-Barre resident, C. Edgar Patience.

In June 1972, massive flooding occurred in downtown Wilkes-Barre. Rains from Tropical Storm Agnes caused the neighboring Susquehanna River to overflow and flood most of the campus.

===Presidents===
==Campus==
The campus covers nearly 50 acres in downtown Wilkes-Barre (adjacent to the Susquehanna River). Situated at the center of the campus, Monarch Court is the site of many campus community activities. The court includes a brick-paved area that encompasses a large King&#x27;s Block K, also in brick, at its center. Each of the bricks surrounding the K is engraved with the names of students, alumni, and local businesses.

The Richard Abbas Alley Center for Health Sciences is home to academics programs such as Physician Assistant Studies, Athletic Training, and Exercise Science. It also includes student residences, an art and cultural display center, and a Chick-fil-A restaurant.

Many of King&#x27;s athletic teams train and compete two miles from campus at the Robert L. Betzler Athletic Complex, a 33.5-acre athletic facility that includes McCarthy Stadium, a field house, and fields for baseball, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, football, and field hockey.

<doc id="492336" wikidata="Q962080" url="?curid=492336" title="Peter Brown (historian)">
<text>Peter Robert Lamont Brown (born 26 July 1935) is an Irish historian. He is the Rollins Professor of History Emeritus at Princeton University. Brown is credited with having brought coherence to the field of Late Antiquity, and is often regarded as the inventor of said field. His work has concerned, in particular, the religious culture of the later Roman Empire and early medieval Europe, and the relation between religion and society.

==Early life and education==

Peter Brown was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1935, to a Scots-Irish Protestant family. Until 1939, he spent winter and spring each year in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, where his father worked as a railway engineer based at Khartoum. For the rest of the year, he would return with his mother to Bray, in County Wicklow, near Dublin. Following the outbreak of war, Brown and his mother remained in Ireland, though his father did not return finally until 1948. Brown has a stutter and came later in life to be noted as an example of a successful public speaker with a stutter.

Brown has written and spoken about the influence of the Sudanese connection on several occasions. Speaking to the &quot;Daily Princetonian&quot;, he has remarked:
 After his father had returned to Ireland, &#x27;a handbook of &quot;Sudanese Courtesy Customs&quot;, containing delicate Arabic phrases of greeting and polite enquiry, was prominent on his bookshelf, as was a deluxe edition of T. E. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;The Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;, which I would read, from cover to cover, every time that I returned home on holiday from my school in England.&quot; Such influences, with &quot;roots deep in my childhood, already ensured, perhaps, that both religion and the &#x27;exotic&#x27; (the non-European and, by implication, the non-classical) were both too large, too ever-present and too rich for their intrusion into the classical world to be dismissed out of hand, as unambiguously negative symptoms of decline. The power of both had begun to puzzle and intrigue me. The collapse of an enlightened empire might, indeed, be a catastrophic event, for all I knew; but it was unlikely to be uninteresting.&quot;

Brown was initially educated at Aravon School – now closed but, at that time, a distinguished preparatory school in Bray, County Wicklow, where he first studied Latin and French. Brown was then educated at Shrewsbury School and New College, Oxford. At Shrewsbury, Brown expected to concentrate on sciences, but first studied Ancient Greek and turned in earnest to the study of history:
When asked to comment on his intellectual formation, Brown has also indicated that he completed his public schooling a year early, returning to Ireland (as he had done for school holidays) in 1952, the year he turned 17. It was then in Dublin that he read Michael Rostovtzeff&#x27;s (1926), which he borrowed from the lending library of the Royal Dublin Society at Ballsbridge. The academic year 1952–1953 was a &quot;hiatus&quot; for Brown, between school and university, during which he learned to type at a secretarial school, and received German lessons from an academic at Trinity College Dublin who had been a refugee from Nazi Germany.

In 1953, Brown took up a scholarship to read Modern History at New College, leaving in 1956. Most of his degree was &quot;devoted to English History in its entirety and to the European High Middle Ages, from 919 to 1127&quot;, but in his final academic year, he undertook a Special Subject on The Age of Augustine, and was particularly influenced by the writings of Marrou and Piganiol. That Special Subject had a profound influence on Brown:

==Career==

===Employment and professional memberships===
Following his graduation Brown began, but did not complete, a doctoral thesis under the external supervision of Arnaldo Momigliano (at that time professor of ancient history at University College London). The potential he had shown as an undergraduate was recognized by the award of the Harmsworth Senior Scholarship at Merton College, Oxford, and a seven-year Prize Fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford. At a time when it was normally possible to remain in the college after the Prize Fellowship, All Souls College subsequently elected him a research fellow in 1963 and a senior research fellow in 1970. The Modern History Faculty of the University of Oxford appointed him a special lecturer in 1970 and a reader (&quot;ad hominem&quot;) in 1973. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1971. Brown left Oxford to become professor of modern history and head of the Department of History at Royal Holloway College in the University of London (1975–78). He subsequently left Britain to become professor of classics and history in the University of California at Berkeley (1978–86) and then Philip and Beulah Rollins Professor of History at Princeton University (1986–2011). He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1979, a fellow of the Medieval Academy of America in 1988, and a resident member of the American Philosophical Society in 1995.

Before joining the tenured faculty at UC Berkeley and Princeton, Brown held visiting professorships at both institutions: at UC Berkeley in 1975, and at Princeton in 1983–6. He has also held visiting professorships at UCLA and in Italy. Other engagements as a visiting teacher have taken Brown to Toronto in the 1970s and, since 2000, to Hungary and Iceland. At Princeton, Brown was given the President&#x27;s Award for Distinguished Teaching in 2000.

===Speaking engagements===
Brown has delivered several named lecture series. These include the Carl Newell Jackson Lectures at Harvard University (1976); the Haskell Lectures at the University of Chicago (1978); the ACLS Lectures in the History of Religion (1981-2); the Curti Lectures at the University of Wisconsin, Madison (1988); the Tanner Lectures at Cambridge and Yale (1993 and 1996 respectively); the Menahem Stern Lectures in Jerusalem (2000); the Lectures in Human Sciences at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna (2012); and the James W. Richard Lectures at the University of Virginia (2012).

He has also delivered a multitude of named single lectures. These include national academic occasions in the UK and US: the Raleigh Lecture in History in the British Academy (1992); and the Charles Homer Haskins Lecture (&quot;A Life of Learning&quot;) for the American Council of Learned Societies (2003).

Other named lectures include the Stenton Lecture at Reading University (1976); the Sigmund H Danziger Jr Memorial Lecture at the University of Chicago (1997); a Presidential Lecture at Stanford University (2002); the Clark Lecture at Trinity College, Cambridge (2004); the Gennadius Library Lecture at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens (2007); the Fr. Alexander Schmemann Lecture at St. Vladimir&#x27;s Orthodox Theological Seminary, NY (2013); the Annual Distinguished Lecture in Religion at Rutgers University (2013); the Nicolai Rubinstein Lecture at Queen Mary College, University of London (2013); the Patricia H. Labalme Friends of the Library Lecture at the American Academy in Rome (2013); the Burke Lecture on Religion and Society, University of California, San Diego (2014); the Corish Lecture at Maynooth College, Ireland (2014); the Etienne Gilson Lecture at the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, Toronto (2014); and the inaugural Costan Lecture at Georgetown University (2014).

He has also been a named lecturer, usually in retrospect, in all the universities at which he has held substantive posts: lectures include the Magie Lecture at Princeton (1991); the Pritchett Lecture at UC Berkeley (1993); the Hayes Robinson Lecture at Royal Holloway College, University of London (1997); the Ronald Syme Lecture at Wolfson College, Oxford, and the Dacre Lecture in the History Faculty at Oxford (2006 and 2010 respectively).

In 2007, Brown gave an inaugural talk at the opening of the Oxford Centre for Late Antiquity. In 2015 he was hosted by the Group for the Study of Late Antiquity at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel, in a public discussion with Paula Fredriksen.

Brown has also frequently been a keynote speaker at conferences and congresses. These include the International Congress of Medieval Studies at Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo (1986); the International Medieval Congress at Leeds (1999); the Sewanee Medieval Colloquium (2012); and the First Annual Symposium on Medieval and Renaissance Studies at St. Louis University (2013). He gave the inaugural address at the first Coloquio Internacional &quot;Nuevas perspectivas sobre la Antigüedad tardía&quot; in Segovia (2009).

===Editorial work===
For several decades, Brown has been General Editor of the book series &quot;The Transformation of the Classical Heritage&quot;, published by the University of California Press. The first volume in the series was published in 1981. The full published list to date now exceeds fifty-five titles.

===Research grants===
Following his earlier books, Brown has received some prestigious and substantial research grants. These include the MacArthur Fellowship in 1982 and the Distinguished Achievement Award for scholars in the humanities from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in 2001.

==Research overview==

Brown, who has a knowledge of at least 26 languages, has been instrumental in the development of the study of late antiquity as a field. Within this broad field, he has also been central in the study of Augustine, monasticism (both the eremitical &quot;holy man&quot; and coenobitic alternatives), the cult of the saints and the practice of sexual renunciation. More recently, he has made fundamental contributions to the study of power relations in late Roman society and to the study of financial giving. He has produced a steady stream of articles (several being classics in the field) since 1961, and a steady series of influential books since 1967.

Janet Nelson, the distinguished British historian of the early Middle Ages, has said: &quot;He took the study of medieval history into fields of cultural history and social history, social psychological history. He was interested in religion but not in an old-fashioned ecclesiastical history, institutional sort of way, but what made people think in this way: how did they conceptualise God? How did they think about religious symbols and rituals in the ways that they did? Why did these things change? That was his agenda. He wrote mostly about late antiquity, the very early period, but he sometimes ventured into the Middle Ages and whenever he did he transformed the scene. The great area he&#x27;s famous for doing is the cult of the saints.&quot;

Drawing on her interview with Brown, Ruby Shao has remarked: &quot;Brown cites the balance of his scholarship between eastern and western Christianity as his proudest accomplishment. Few scholars research both equally, as the task demands mastery of different languages and intuitions. His commitment has challenged him throughout his career to break into new territory, such as by examining the Desert Fathers, Syriac poetry, and languages like Greek and Coptic.&quot;

===1956 to 1971===

Following his exposure to the works of Marrou and Piganiol as an undergraduate, and shortly after joining All Souls College as a Prize Fellow, Brown travelled in Italy in 1957–8, doing research at the British School in Rome. During that time, he was especially influenced by the work of Santo Mazzarino, which provided a stimulus for Brown&#x27;s earliest lectures at Oxford, on return from Italy in 1958. Other early influences were Norman Hepburn Baynes, William Frend and A. H. M. Jones.

Brown&#x27;s earliest research articles concerned the Christianization of the senatorial aristocracy of Rome (1961), and the phenomena of religious dissent and coercion in late Roman North Africa (1961, 1963). From there, he turned to the study of Augustine&#x27;s own views on the state (1963) and its use of coercion in matters of religion (1964). Italy and Africa in the fourth and early fifth centuries provided the principal context for the life of Augustine, which became the subject of Brown&#x27;s substantial first book - &quot;Augustine of Hippo: A Biography&quot; (1967). This was followed by related articles that explored both the Pelagian milieu in Italy (1968, 1970) and the relation between Christianity and local culture in Roman Africa (1968).

Following the completion of &quot;Augustine&quot;, however, Brown felt &quot;free, at last&quot; to take a wider approach to Late Antiquity, and to turn in particular to the Near East and Central Asia. In 1964, A. H. M. Jones&#x27;s vast magnum opus on &quot;The Later Roman Empire, 284–602: A Social, Economic and Administrative Survey&quot; had appeared, on which Brown wrote a long and important review article for the &quot;Economic History Review&quot; (1967). In addition, as Augustine had been a Manichaean for many years, Brown already had a natural route into the religious history of the eastern half of the later Roman Empire and the Persian Empire. An article on &quot;The Diffusion of Manichaeism in the Roman Empire&quot; (1969) reflected the direction of his interests, and was spectacularly corroborated when, shortly after, the Cologne Mani-Codex came to light.

In 1969, Geoffrey Barraclough (as General Editor of the Thames &amp; Hudson &quot;Library of European Civilization&quot; series) approached Brown with a view to commissioning a book on late antiquity - and Brown has since noted that it might well have been Barraclough who suggested &quot;The World of Late Antiquity&quot; as a title. At this point, Brown engaged increasingly with the work of Henri Pirenne – and also with that of the French Annales School, in particular Fernand Braudel. Their work, combined with the eastward shift in his interests, prompted Brown to think increasingly of the Mediterranean as &quot;truly distinctive&quot;.

Brown&#x27;s interest in analyzing culture and religion as social phenomena, and as part of a wider context of historical change, had already been fostered by engagement with the work of Baynes, Frend and Jones. But the &quot;Annales&quot;″ influence in Brown&#x27;s work can be seen in his increasing use of anthropology and sociology as interpretative tools for historical analysis. Brown was influenced by Anglo-American anthropology, himself noting the role of both a largely British tradition of social anthropology and a largely American tradition of cultural anthropology.

===1971 to present===
Brown&#x27;s views slightly shifted in the eighties. In articles and new editions Brown said that his earlier work, which had deconstructed many of the religious aspects of his field of study, needed to be reassessed. His later work shows a deeper appreciation for the specifically Christian layers of his subjects of study.

His most recent research focuses on wealth and poverty in late antiquity, especially in Christian writers.

==Principal publications==

===&quot;Augustine of Hippo: A Biography&quot; (1967; 2000)===
Brown&#x27;s biography of Augustine of Hippo was widely acclaimed. Reviewing it in the &quot;Journal of Theological Studies&quot;, William Frend – with whom Brown had had a courteous but critical difference of opinion on the religious history of Roman Africa – wrote: &quot;This is a superb book, an intensely personal interpretation of its central figure, but one in which the scholar&#x27;s full range of skills, those of the historian, the philosopher, and human psychologist have been brought to bear, sustained throughout by a profound knowledge of Augustine&#x27;s writings and those of his contemporaries, as well as of modern critical works. The entire compass of the life and thought of the later Roman Empire in the West is its canvas.&quot;

The idiosyncrasies of the book did not go unnoticed. Another great master of Augustinian studies, the Rev. Henry Chadwick, remarked that Brown&#x27;s book was a &quot;biography without the theology&quot; - a judgment that Brown has accepted as &quot;fair&quot;. For this reason, among Anglophone students, Brown&#x27;s book has often been read hand in hand with Gerald Bonner&#x27;s &quot;St Augustine of Hippo: Life and Controversies&quot;, which first appeared four years earlier, in 1963, and which Bonner updated in subsequent editions.

Equally, however, it was Brown&#x27;s distinctive and subtle de-emphasis of theological content, combined with his use of psychoanalytic insight - which was then highly unusual in the study of an ancient figure - that helped to set Augustine convincingly, as an individual, within a historical landscape. This was noticed by Richard Southern, who praised Brown for &quot;bringing Augustine out of the tomb of theological doctrine, and setting his mind and emotions working before our eyes.&quot;

Brown published a new edition in 2000, closing with two new chapters, one focusing on new evidence and the other on new interpretations.

===&quot;The World of Late Antiquity&quot; (1971)===
In his second book &quot;The World of Late Antiquity&quot; (1971), Brown offered a radically new interpretation of the entire period between the second and eighth centuries AD. The traditional interpretation of this period was centred around the idea of decadence from a &#x27;golden age&#x27;, classical civilisation, after the famous work of Edward Gibbon &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (1779). On the contrary, Brown proposed to look at this period in positive terms, arguing that Late Antiquity was a period of immense cultural innovation.

===&quot;The Rise and Function of the Holy Man in Late Antiquity&quot; (1971)===
His most celebrated early paper concerned the figure of the &#x27;holy man&#x27;. According to Brown, the charismatic, Christian ascetics (holy men) were particularly prominent in the late Roman empire and the early Byzantine world as mediators between local communities and the divine. This relationship expressed the importance of patronage in the Roman social system, which was taken over by the Christian ascetics. But more importantly, Brown argues, the rise of the holy man was the result of a deeper religious change that affected not only Christianity but also other religions of the late antique period – namely the need for a more personal access to the divine.

=== &quot;The Body and Society&quot; (1988) ===
Published in 1988, Peter Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Body and Society&quot; was a groundbreaking study of the marriage and sexual practices of early Christians in the ancient Mediterranean and Near East. Brown focuses on the practice of permanent sexual renunciation-continence, celibacy, and lifelong virginity in Christian circles from the first to the fifth centuries A.D. and traces early Christians&#x27; preoccupations with sexuality and the body in the work of the period&#x27;s great writers.

&quot;The Body and Society&quot; questions how theological views on sexuality and the human body both mirrored and shaped relationships between men and women, Roman aristocracy and slaves, and the married and the celibate. Brown discusses Tertullian, Valentinus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Constantine, the Desert Fathers, Jerome, Ambrose, and Augustine, among others, and considers asceticism and society in the Eastern Empire, martyrdom and prophecy, gnostic spiritual guidance, promiscuity among the men and women of the church, monks and marriage in Egypt, the ascetic life of women in fourth-century Jerusalem, and the body and society in the early Middle Ages. In his new introduction, Brown reflects on his work&#x27;s reception in the scholarly community.

===&quot;Through the Eye of a Needle&quot; (2012)===
Brown&#x27;s longest book to date, &quot;Through the Eye of a Needle&quot; concerns attitudes to philanthropic giving in the Latin West in Late Antiquity. Divided into five parts, the core of the book – the long Parts II and III – focuses on two generations between about AD370 and 430, when a rich diversity of views gave way to an increasing polarization of thought brought on by the debate between Augustine and the Pelagians. Parts I and IV–V place this highly focused study in the much wider frame of the social structures of the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries.

==Honours==
Brown has received formal recognition for his academic achievements in at least twelve countries on three continents.

===Honorary degrees and college fellowships===
He has received some twenty honorary degrees. From outside the US, he has received honorary doctorates from the University of Fribourg, Switzerland (1974), Trinity College Dublin (1990), the University of Pisa (2001), Cambridge (2004), the Central European University in Budapest (2005), Oxford (2006), King&#x27;s College London (2008), The Hebrew University of Jerusalem (2010), the Aristotle University in Thessaloniki (2010), and the University of St Andrews (2014). His US honorary doctorates include the University of Chicago (1978), Wesleyan University (1993), Tulane (1994), Columbia University (2001), Harvard University (2002), Southern Methodist University (2004), Yale University (2006), University of Notre Dame (2008), Amherst College (2009), and St Vladimir&#x27;s Orthodox Theological Seminary, NY (2013).

He is an honorary fellow of Royal Holloway College in the University of London (1997), and of New College at Oxford University (1998).

===Prizes===
Brown has received several major prizes, including the Heineken Prize for History from the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (1994), the Ausonius Prize for Ancient History from the University of Trier (1999) and the Premio Anaxilao from the Municipality of Reggio di Calabria (1999). In 2008 he was the co-winner, with Indian historian Romila Thapar, of the semi-regular Kluge Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Study of Humanity, from the US Library of Congress. In 2011, Brown was awarded the prestigious International Balzan Prize for the Humanities, for his works on Graeco-Roman antiquity. He shared the Dan David Prize in the category of &quot;Retrieving the Past: Historians and their Sources&quot; in 2015.

===Learned centres, societies and academies===
In addition to the professional memberships acquired during his career in the UK and US, Brown has received honorific recognition from a number of other learned bodies.

He is a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (1991); a corresponding member of the Royal Academy of Letters in Barcelona (1997); an honorary fellow of the Italian Association for the Study of Sanctity, Cults and Hagiography; an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy (2010); a foreign member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in Italy (2015); and a fellow of the Ecclesiastical History Society in the UK (2016).

He is also honorary president (from 2012) of the Centro Internacional de Estudios sobre la Antigüedad Tardía &#x27;Teodosio el Grande&#x27;, in the Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia, at Segovia.

===Foreign public recognition===
Brown is a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters in France (1996).

===Book prizes===
Brown has won several distinguished book prizes. &quot;Augustine of Hippo: A Biography&quot; (1967) won the Arts Council of Great Britain Prize. &quot;The Body and Society: Men, Women, and Sexual Renunciation in Early Christianity&quot; (1988) won the Vursell Award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the Ralph Waldo Emerson Award of Phi Beta Kappa. &quot;Through the Eye of a Needle: Wealth, the Fall of Rome, and the Making of Christianity in the West, 350–550AD&quot; (2012) won the Jacques Barzun Prize in Cultural History from the American Philosophical Society, and the Philip Schaff Prize from the American Society of Church History. It also secured the R.R. Hawkins Award (the top prize in a tiered structure) at the American publishing industry&#x27;s annual PROSE Awards.

<text>Michael John Witbrock is a computer scientist in the field of artificial intelligence. Witbrock is a native of New Zealand and is the former vice president of Research at Cycorp, which is carrying out the Cyc project in an effort to produce a genuine artificial intelligence.

== Background and affiliations ==

Witbrock was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, and has a Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University. Before joining Cycorp, he was a principal scientist at Terra Lycos, working on integrating statistical and knowledge-based approaches to understanding Web user behavior; he has also been associated with Just Systems Pittsburgh Research Center and the Informedia Digital Library at Carnegie Mellon.

In 2016, Witbrock joined and led the Reasoning Lab at IBM Watson.

In 2019, Witbrock was recruited by the government and returned to his home country to establish and lead AI research initiatives in New Zealand

== Research topics ==

Witbrock&#x27;s dissertation work was on speaker modeling; before going to Cycorp, he published in a broad range of areas, including:

* Neural networks
* Multimedia information retrieval
* Natural language understanding
* Genetic design
* Computational linguistics
* Speech recognition
* Web-browser design

His work at Cycorp has focused on improving its knowledge formation efforts, particularly dialogue processing, machine reasoning, and on improving accessibility to the Cyc project.

At the University of Auckland, Witbrock&#x27;s research spans natural language processing, multi-hop reasoning, causal inference, graph neural networks, focusing on advancing AI&#x27;s interpretability, robustness, and real-world applications.

<text>The Bene Israel (), also referred to as the &quot;Shanivar Teli&quot; () or &quot;Native Jew&quot; caste, are a community of Jews in India. It has been suggested that they are the descendants of one of the Ten Lost Tribes via their ancestors who had settled there centuries ago. Starting in the second half of the 18th century, after they were taught about normative Sephardi Judaism, they migrated from villages in the Konkan region where they had previously lived to nearby cities throughout British India—primarily to Mumbai where their first synagogue opened in 1796 but also to Pune, Ahmedabad, and Karachi (now in Pakistan), where they gained prominent positions within the British colonial government and the Indian Army.

In the early part of the 20th century, many Bene Israel became active in the Indian film industry as actresses/actors, producers, and directors. With Indian independence in 1947 followed by the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948, many Bene Israel, including those who had arrived in India after their exodus from newly-independent Pakistan, soon emigrated to the State of Israel, the United States, as well as Canada, and other Commonwealth countries. Emigration from India (mostly to Israel but also to the UK, the US, Canada and Australia) reduced the approximate population there from a peak of 20,000 in 1951 to 16,000 in 1961 and 5,500 in 1971, after which the emigration greatly declined.

==History==

The Bene Israel community believes that their ancestors fled Judea during the persecution under Antiochus Epiphanes and are descended from fourteen Jews, seven men and seven women, who came to India as the only survivors of a shipwreck near the village of Navagaon on the  coast about south of Mumbai. Some historians have thought their ancestors may have belonged to one of the Lost Tribes of Israel. They took up the work of oil pressing and running grocery shops but abstained from working on the Sabbath, and hence were called Shanivar Teli. Genetic evidence as of 2005 suggests that the Bene Israel appear to carry a haplotype which points to a Middle Eastern origin, and Jews may have formed part of the founding group. They gradually assimilated to the people around them, while retaining customs that are considered Jewish. The medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides may have been referring to the Bene Israel when he wrote in a letter: &quot;The Jews of India know nothing of the Torah, and of the laws nothing save the Sabbath and circumcision.&quot;

At a point in history which is uncertain, an Indian Jew from Cochin named David Rahabi discovered the Bene Israel in their villages and recognized their vestigial Jewish customs. Rahabi taught the people about normative Judaism. He trained some young men among them to be the religious preceptors of the community. Known as &quot;Kajis&quot;, these men held a position that became hereditary, similar to the Cohanim. They became recognized as judges and settlers of disputes within the community.

Bene Israel tradition places Rahabi&#x27;s arrival at either 1000 or 1400, although some historians have dated his arrival to the 18th century. They suggest that the &quot;David Rahabi&quot; of Bene Israel folklore was a man named David Ezekiel Rahabi, who lived from 1694 to 1772, and resided in Cochin, then the center of the wealthy Malabar Jewish community. Others suggest that the reference is to David Baruch Rahabi, who arrived in Bombay from Cochin in 1825.

It is estimated that there were 6,000 Bene Israel in the 1830s; 10,000 at the turn of the 20th century; and in 1948—their peak in India—they numbered 20,000. Since that time, most of the population has immigrated to Israel. In 2020, the Jewish population in Mumbai numbered about 3,500, out of which 99% were from the Bene Israel community. Mumbai and surrounding regions like Raigad houses several synagogues, most of which belong to the Bene Israel community.

Under British colonial rule, many Bene Israel rose to prominence in India; they were less affected by discriminatory legislation and gained prominent positions within the colonial government and the Indian Army, at a higher rate overall than their non-Jewish counterparts. Some of these enlistees with their families later immigrated to the British protectorate of Aden. In the 19th century, the Bene Israel did however meet with hostility from the newly anglicized Baghdadi Jews who considered the Bene Israel to be &quot;Indian&quot;. They also questioned the Jewishness of the community. In response, the Bene Israel educator and historian, Haeem Samuel Kehimkar, spearheaded the defence of the Jewishness of the Bene Israel in the late 1800s. In his writings, he tried to portray the Bene Israel as a totally foreign community in India. He also divided the community into two endogamous groups, white (gora) and black (kala). He claimed the whites had pure blood and the blacks were the progeny of Indian women and therefore impure.

In the early twentieth century, numerous Bene Israel became leaders in the new film industry in India. In addition, men worked as producers and actors: Ezra Mir (alias Edwin Myers) (1903-1993) became the first chief of Films Division of India, and Solomon Moses was head of the Bombay Film Lab Pvt Ltd from the 1940s to 1990s. Ennoch Isaac Satamkar was a film actor and assistant director to Mehboob Khan, a director of Hindi films.

Given the relatively privileged position they had held under British colonial rule, many Bene Israel prepared to leave India at independence in 1947. They believed that nationalism and the emphasis on indigenous religions would mean fewer opportunities for them. Most immigrated to the state of Israel, which was newly established in 1948 as a Jewish homeland.

==Life in Israel==

Between 1948 and 1952, some 2,300 Bene Israel immigrated to Israel. In India, the Bene Israel and other Jews lived in urban areas, however in Israel they were settled into development towns. Members of the Bene Israel faced discrimination from other Jewish groups, including due to their darker skin colour. Several rabbis refused to marry Bene Israel to other Jews, on grounds that they were not legitimate Jews under Orthodox law. Between 1952 and 1954, following sit-down protests and hunger strikes by Bene Israel demanding to be sent back to India, the Jewish Agency repatriated 337 members of the Bene Israel community to India, though most eventually returned to Israel years later.

In 1962, authorities in Israel were accused of racism towards the Bene Israel. In the case that caused the controversy, the Council of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel ruled that before registering a marriage between Indian Jews and Jews not belonging to that community, the registering rabbi should investigate the lineage of the Indian applicant for possible non-Jewish descent, and in case of doubt, require the applicant to perform conversion or immersion. The discrimination may actually be related to the fact that some religious authorities believed that the Bene Israel were not fully Jewish because of inter-marriage during their long separation. Between 1962 and 1964, the Bene Israel community staged protests against the religious policy. In 1964 the Israeli Rabbinate ruled that the Bene Israel are &quot;full Jews in every respect&quot;.

The &quot;Report of the High Level Commission on the Indian Diaspora&quot; (2012) reviewed life in Israel for the Bene Israel community. It noted that the city of Beersheba in Southern Israel has the largest community of Bene Israel, with a sizable one in Ramla. They have a new kind of transnational family. Generally the Bene Israel have not been politically active and have been of modest means. They have not formed continuing economic connections to India and have limited political status in Israel. Jews of Indian origin are generally regarded as Sephardic; they have become well integrated religiously with the Sephardic community in Israel. Abbink, on the other hand, states that the Bene Israel have become a distinct ethnic minority in Israel. The community despite being in Israel for many generations has maintained many of their traditions from India such as a form of Malida dedicated to the Jewish prophet Elijah as a thanksgiving ritual and wedding rituals such as mehndi. The prophet Elijah has become a kind of patron saint for Bene Israel. A ritual of thanksgiving dedicated to the Prophet Elijah is called Eliahu HaNabi (the Hebrew name for Elijah), and is performed at weddings and other celebratory events. The ceremony features a tray of flattened rice, grated coconut, raisins, spices, and fruit of two or more different kinds. The ceremony is regarded as a boundary marker between the Bene Israel and other Jewish communities. The Community also observes Tashlich, the ceremony of taking a ritual bath at Rosh Hashanah. The Bene Israel also like to attend their own synagogues to maintain group life. This is also seen in higher levels of endogamy compared to other Jewish groups.

Religiously, the Bene Israel adopted the devotional singing style Kirtan from their Marathi Hindu neighbors. A popular Kirtan is one based on the Story of Joseph. Their main traditional musical instruments are the Indian Harmonium and the Bulbul tarang.

The Central Organisation of Indian Jews in Israel (COIJI) was founded by Noah Massil. The organization has twenty chapters around Israel. Maiboli, the newsletter for the Bene Israel community is edited by Noah Masil. There is also a website called Indian Jewish Community in Israel which coordinates various cultural activities organized by the community. The community in Israel opened the museum of Indian Jewish Heritage in the town of Dimona in 2012. The museum is currently run by volunteers. At present, the museum has a small collection of items donated by the community. It also holds cultural and cooking classes for all communities.

==Migration to other countries==
Members of Bene Israel also settled in Britain and North America, mostly in Canada.

<text>Vigna subterranea (common names: Bambara groundnut, Bambara nut, Bambara bean, manicongo, Congo goober, earth pea, ground-bean, or hog-peanut) is a member of the family Fabaceae. Its name is derived from the Bambara ethnic group. The plant originated in West Africa. As a food and source of income, the Bambara groundnut is considered to be the third most important leguminous crop in those African countries where it is grown, after peanut and cowpea. The crop is mainly cultivated, sold and processed by women, and is, thus, particularly valuable for female subsistence farmers.

Bambara groundnut represents the third most important grain legume in semi-arid Africa. It is resistant to high temperatures and is suitable for marginal soils where other leguminous crops cannot be grown. It is a low-impact crop. The entire plant is known for soil improvement because of nitrogen fixation.

&quot;Vigna subterranea&quot; is geocarpy which ripens its pods underground, much like the peanut (also called a &quot;groundnut&quot;). They can be eaten fresh or boiled after drying, and can be ground either fresh or dry to make puddings.

== Origins and domestication ==
The Bambara groundnut is thought to have originated in West Africa, particularly in areas now known as Nigeria, Cameroon, and the Central African Republic. It was domesticated by local communities and has been cultivated for centuries as an important source of nutrition and sustenance. Its cultural significance is notable among the Bambara people of Mali, from whom its common name is derived.

== Distribution ==
The spread of &quot;V. subterranea&quot; beyond its native range is closely linked to the interplay of human migration, trade, colonialism and agricultural practices.

The Bambara groundnut is predominantly cultivated across Sub-Saharan Africa, encompassing several regions. In West Africa, it is grown in countries such as Benin, Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, and Senegal. In Central Africa, it is found in Cameroon, Chad, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Nations in East Africa like Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Sudan also cultivate it. In Southern Africa, it is grown in countries such as Angola, Namibia, Mozambique, Zambia, and Eswatini (formerly Swaziland).

Beyond Africa, Bambara groundnut has been introduced to other continents. On the Indian Ocean Islands, it is found in Madagascar, where it is known locally as &quot;voanjobory&quot; or &quot;voanjabory&quot; and remains an important component of traditional cuisine. It is also cultivated in Mauritius and the Comoro Islands. In Asia, it is cultivated in India, particularly in the state of Karnataka, and in Indonesia, especially on the island of Java. In Australasia, it is grown in Papua New Guinea.

In the Caribbean, it is grown in Dominican Republic where it is known as &quot;manicongo&quot;, it was once common in local markets but has since declined in prevalence over the past decades. This particular lineage, descends from seeds that were carried to the Americas by enslaved people during the Atlantic slave trade and the Age of Discovery.

== Biology ==

=== Growth, development, physiology ===
Bambara groundnut is a herbaceous, intermediate, annual plant, with creeping stems at ground level. It is a small legume plant that grows to a height of 0.25–0.37m with compound leaves of three leaflets having stipules about 3 mm long. The flowers have a tube calyx about 1 mm long and 5 lobes about 1 mm long as well as a whitish yellow corolla, 4–7 mm long. The fruit is an indehiscent pod almost globose about 2.5 cm in diameter. The plant generally looks like bunched leaves arising from branched stems, which form a crown on the soil surface.

Bambara is considered as a fast-growing crop. The growth cycle is between (min-max) 90–170 days and under optimal conditions the cycle is about 120–150 days to pod maturity. Flowers appear 40–60 days after planting. After pollination, the pod reaches maturity, and during another 55 days, the seeds fully develop, producing again every 30 days.

Generative reproduction is for the Bambara groundnut autogamous, (self-fertilization), and (self-pollinating). After self-fertilization, pale yellow flowers are borne on the freely growing branching stems; these stems then grow downwards into the soil, taking the developing seed within the pods, which makes breeding and development of new cultivars for the traits of interest difficult. The seeds will form pods encasing seeds just below the soil. The pods are round, wrinkled and each contains one or two seeds that are round, smooth and very hard when dried.The seeds may be cream colored, brown, red, mottled or black eyed and their size is about 8.5–15 mm × 6.5–10 mm × 5.5–9 mm.

Several factors are essential for promoting cross-pollination in Bambara and these include a proper nursery habitat, short day lengths (&lt;12h), an average temperature of 26 °C, which is necessary for optimum flowering and pod formation and a relative humidity of 90%. The strict photoperiod requirement of Bambara also limits its productivity in countries further away from the equator. In some accessions, long days (&gt;12h) negatively affect pod-setting, resulting in crop failure.

The genus Vigna, which includes about 80 species, is found throughout the tropics. There are considerable morphological differences between wild and domesticated types of Bambara groundnuts. Long runners are produced by wild Bambara groundnut, and the seeds are smaller (9–11 mm long) and more uniform in size. The pods are thin and do not wrinkle when drying. Domesticated versions are more compact, have fleshy pods that wrinkle as they dry, with longer, less slender, and more erect petioles, and larger seeds (11–15 mm long). Wild and domesticated types are sometimes distinguished as &quot;var. spontanea&quot; (Harms) Hepper (wild) and &quot;var. subterranea&quot; (cultivated).

=== Biological nitrogen fixation ===
Like many other legumes, Bambara groundnut fixes atmospheric nitrogen through the process of biological nitrogen fixation. Its potential to be used as an alternative to chemical fertilizer in agriculture has been investigated for many years. The process is also very important to improve soil fertility and to supply other non-leguminous crops with the nitrogen left in the soil after the legume is harvested.

== Cultivation ==

=== Soil requirements ===
Optimal soils for Bambara groundnut production are sandy soils to prevent waterlogging. Well-drained soils make the harvest easier and prevent rotting of the pods. Stony areas are typically avoided to prevent damage of the pods.

Optimal soil depth is between 50 and 100 cm, with a light soil texture. Soil fertility should be low and soil pH is best suited between 5 and 6.5 and should not be lower than 4.3 or higher than 7. Bambara groundnut is tolerant to salinity, but high sodium chloride concentration in the soil will result in yield losses.

=== Climate requirements ===
The production is best suited between a latitude of 20° and 30°, i.e. the tropical wet and dry (Aw) and the subtropical dry summer (Cs) climate zones. Optimal temperature is between 19 °C and 30 °C. Temperatures below 16 °C and above 38 °C are not suited for the production of Bambara groundnut.

The Bambara groundnut is very drought-resistant. The minimal annual rainfall requirement is about 300 mm and optimal annual rainfall is between 750 mm and 1400 mm and should not exceed 3000 mm. Bambara groundnut can tolerate heavy rainfall, but it will result in yield losses if they happen at harvest.

=== Seedbed requirements and sowing ===
Before sowing, the seeds can be treated with pesticides to prevent insect and fungal attack, and being eaten by bush fowl (&quot;Numida meleagris&quot;). Priming the seeds with water by soaking them overnight and then drying them before sowing improves seedling emergence, vigour and yield.

Sowing is usually performed manually by peasant farmers in tropical Africa, but it can also be done mechanically on industrial farms using modified soya bean planters. Manual sowing is generally done using a hoe or a cutlass to open the soil. One seed is placed in each hole which are then closed.

Seedbed type doesn&#x27;t seem to affect yield or biomass production of Bambara groundnut. The crop can thus be planted on flat terrain, although it is also planted in ridges. Studies show that increased sowing density has a positive effect on production calculated on a per-area basis, but has a negative effect on per-plant yield. It is assumed that at higher sowing densities, increased competition between plants is the cause of lower pod and seed number per plant.

=== Cropping system and fertilization ===
The cropping system is semi-permanent and the Bambara groundnut can be cultivated as single crop or as intercrop. Best suited intercrops are sorghum, millet, maize, peanut, yams and cassava. Bambara groundnut is mainly cultivated as intercrop, however the planting density varies between 6 and 29 plants per square meter. For woodland savannas of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, the highest yield is attainable with a plant density of 25 plants per square meter. Despite its suitability for intercropping systems due to its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, a non-negligible proportion of farmers grow the Bambara groundnut in monoculture and report that its performance is better as a single crop. Cultivation is mainly performed manually and is comparable to the production of peanut.

The Bambara groundnut can grow on soils with low fertility and is even reported to do better on these soils than on fertile ones. Nevertheless, phosphate fertilization can have a beneficial effect. For example, the application of superphosphate can improve the yield of the Bambara groundnut. Moreover, fertilization with phosphorus enhances the crop&#x27;s nitrogen fixation and increases its nitrogen content.

=== Harvest and postharvest treatment ===
The Bambara bean typically takes about 130–150 days to mature, but early or late harvests only marginally reduce the yield. The pods, which grow belowground, are harvested manually by pulling out the whole crop and picking the pods by hand. Then, they are usually dried in the sun for some days. Post-harvest losses are reported to be on a low level. However, insect pests can cause damage to stored grains, most importantly Bruchids.

=== Interactions: Pests, diseases, symbionts ===
It is widely regarded as a pest and disease resistant crop. However, there is a lack of evidence to support this claim, with reports of fungal attacks by &quot;Rhizoctonia solani&quot; in Southern Thailand, and &quot;Cercospora canescens&quot; and &quot;Colletotrichum capsici&quot; in Nigeria, causing brown blotch disease. The crop is also susceptible to attack by cowpea weevil (&quot;Callosobruchus maculatus&quot;).

== Production ==

=== Importance ===
The annual production of Bambara groundnut is estimated to be 0.2 million tonnes from an area of 0.25 million hectares worldwide. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is the largest producer of Bambara groundnut, while a small quantity is produced in Southeast Asia (e.g., Thailand and Indonesia), the United States, and Australia. Additionally, the crop is cultivated in Brazil, where it was putatively introduced in the 1600s with the slave trade. West Africa is the main Bambara groundnut production region in SSA, where Burkina Faso, Niger, and Cameroon are the leading producers, contributing to 74% of global production. However, it was reported by Ghanaian farmers to contribute neither to a large part of the subsistence food nor of the income.

=== Worldwide production and yield ===
World production of &quot;Vigna subterranea&quot; increased from 29,800 tonnes in 1972 to 79,155 tonnes in 2015. 

The top six Bambara groundnut producing countries in Africa in 2018 include Burkina Faso, Niger, Cameroon, Mali, Togo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo with a total production of 0.06, 0.05, 0.04, 0.03, 0.02, and 0.01 million tonnes, respectively.

The yield level of Bambara groundnut in Africa varies from 0.6 to 1 tonne per hectare, depending on variety and production conditions. However, unshelled mean yields of up to 3 tonnes per hectare were reported when cultivating some landraces in the transition agro-ecological zone in Nigeria . A low mean yield of 0.85 tonnes per hectare was reported in Ghana under good management practices close to yield levels of other legumes such as cowpeas (0.80 tonnes per hecatare) and pigeon peas (0.78 tonnes per hectare).

== Nutrition ==
This nutrient-dense legume is sometimes termed a “complete food” due to its balanced macronutrient composition. It is considered to be a neglected and underutilized food source in Benin. The brown hull showed the highest concentrations of rutin and myricetin among flavonoids, while the red hull resulted in having with the highest concentrations of chlorogenic and ellagic acid among tannin compounds.

=== Macronutrient content ===
Bambara groundnut has nutritive value ranging between 57.9% to 64% carbohydrate and 24.0% to 25.5% protein content. In comparison, soybean (&quot;Glycine max&quot;) and chickpea (&quot;Cicer ariteneum&quot;) have 27% and 61% of carbohydrates.

=== Micronutrient content ===
=== Anti-nutritional factors ===
The presence of anti-nutritional factors (ANFs) in the &quot;Vigna subterranea&quot; can reduce protein digestibility, affecting bioavailability of amino acids by up to 50%, as well as lowering digestibility and bioavailability of other nutrients. ANFs include enzyme inhibitors, flatulence factors, tannins, phytic acid and saponins. ANFs can be removed or lowered by a variety of treatments:

# Cooking and thermal treatment of pulse seeds.
# Applications of pressure, heat, infrared radiation, dry extrusion and chemicals such as cysteine have been shown to reduce trypsin inhibitor activity in whole soybean.

== Culinary use ==
The seeds are used for food, beverages because of their high protein content and for digestive system applications. In West Africa, the nuts are eaten as a snack, roasted and salted, processed into cake, or as a meal, boiled similarly to other beans.

The Bambara groundnut needs to be cooked for a relatively long time, which means that more fuel is needed than for cooking other legumes. The cooking time for fresh beans is 45–60 minutes, and dry beans may even take 3–4 hours. This presents an obstacle to a more widespread use of this crop. Moreover, if the bean is not cooked enough, it can cause bloating of the stomach, constipation and flatulence.

=== Traditional culinary use of Bambara groundnut in Nigeria ===
In South Eastern Nigeria, particularly in Enugu, the dried Bambara beans are ground into a fine powder, then mixed with palm oil, water and, more rarely, vegetables (e.g., utazi), then poured into banana leaf wraps or one-liter cellophane bags before being boiled into a pudding to make &quot;okpa&quot;, a common breakfast food. During the rainy season in many parts of central Nigeria, the fresh Bambara beans are cooked with their shells still on them, then eaten as a snack.

=== Potential use in probiotic beverage ===
Bambara groundnut milk can be fermented with lactic acid bacteria to make a probiotic beverage that not only increase the economic value of the nutritious legume but also help in addressing malnutrition.

=== Use as livestock feed ===
The Bambara groundnut plays an important role in the diet and culture of populations. The leaves, rich in phosphorus, are used for livestock feed. Seeds are given to pigs and poultry.

==Traditional African medicine ==
The Bambara groundnut is used in some traditional African medicine.

==Crop development==
There are genetic resources available for breeding since around 6145 germplasms of the Bambara groundnut have been collected and are stored ex situ.

The primary goal of Bambara improvement programs is to focus on seed yield and nutritional quality traits. There is a notable gap between the potential yield of 4 t/ha and the average yield of 0.85 t/ha reported for African countries. Thus, breeding should aim at improving the yield. Results of studies exhibited high protein content among the test genotypes. Similarly, high levels of essential fatty acids, thiamine, ribovin, and vitamin K were recorded. Moreover, scientists examined the chemical properties of starches in Bambara groundnut. The results revealed that seed source and crop management practices affected chemical composition. Food fortification, the use of artificial supplements, and food imports are among the strategies used to overcome the problem of malnutrition in Africa. The adoption of traditional plant breeding methods to enhance nutritional benefits of locally grown food crops such as Bambara groundnut is an economic and affordable strategy to decrease malnutrition in Africa.

The form and colour of Bambara groundnut were all important factors to optimize the best extraction yield of phytochemicals. Overall, the hulls of the crop were the optimum source of flavonoids and tannins: the brown and red hulls had the highest concentration of flavonoids compared to whole and dehulled, with the highest flavonoid concentration being rutin at 24.46 mg g−1 found in brown hulls and myricetin at 1.80 mg g−1 found in red hulls. Lastly, formulating products with higher concentration of Bambara groundnut hulls could potentially result in a product with higher phytochemical content.

<text>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is Australia&#x27;s central bank and banknote issuing authority. It has had this role since 14 January 1960, when the &quot;Reserve Bank Act 1959&quot; removed the central banking functions from the Commonwealth Bank.

The bank&#x27;s main policy role is to control inflation levels within a target range of 2–3%, by controlling the unemployment rate according to the &#x27;non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment&#x27; (NAIRU) by controlling the official cash rate. The NAIRU was implemented in most western nations after 1975, and has been maintained at a target of 5–6% unemployment. The average unemployment rate in Australia between the end of the Second World War and the implementation of the NAIRU was consistently between 1 and 2%. Since the implementation of the NAIRU, the average unemployment rate in Australia has been close to 6%.

The RBA also provides services to the Government of Australia and services to other central banks and official institutions. The RBA currently comprises the Payments System Board, which sets the payment system policy of the bank, and the Reserve Bank Board, which sets all other monetary and banking policies of the bank.

Both boards consist of members of the bank, the Treasury, other Australian government agencies, and leaders of other institutions that are part of the Australian economy. The structure of the Reserve Bank Board has remained consistent ever since 1951, with the exception of the change in the number of members of the board. The governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia is appointed by the Treasurer and chairs both the Payment Systems and Reserve Bank Boards and when there are disagreements between both boards, the governor resolves them.

==Roles and responsibilities==
The Reserve Bank is currently governed by the &quot;Reserve Bank Act 1959&quot;. Section 10(2), commonly referred to as the Bank&#x27;s charter, states that Bank&#x27;s duty is &quot;to ensure that the monetary and banking policy of the Bank is directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia&quot; to be achieved by exercising its powers &quot;to contribute to:
In practice the Reserve Bank concentrates on the first objective, that is to control inflation through monetary policy. The current objective is a policy of inflation targeting aimed at maintaining the annual inflation rate at between &quot;2–3 per cent, on average, over the cycle&quot;. This target was first set in 1993 by the then Reserve Bank Governor Bernie Fraser and was then formalised in 1996 by the then Treasurer Peter Costello and incoming Reserve Bank Governor Ian Mcfarlane.

The Reserve Bank gives banking and registry services to agencies of the government, to other central banks, and other official institutions. The assets of the bank include the gold and foreign exchange reserves of Australia, which is estimated to have a net worth of A$101 billion.

Nearly 94% of the RBA&#x27;s employees work at its headquarters and at the Business Resumption Site, both in Sydney. The remainder of the total of 926 staff work in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth, London and New York City. A wholly owned subsidiary of the bank is Note Printing Australia, which employs 257 other workers, and which manufactures the Australian dollar and other securities, for markets both in and outside of Australia.

The Payments System Board fills the role of deciding on the bank&#x27;s payments system policy and the Reserve Bank Board is responsible for all other monetary and banking policies of the bank. Conflicts between the two boards do not occur often, and when they do, they are resolved by the governor.

==Governors and their roles==
The Reserve Bank governor is the most senior position in the RBA. The governor is appointed for a term of up to seven years by the Treasurer and is eligible to be reappointed at the end of their term. The governor is the chairman of both the Payment Systems Board and the Reserve Bank Board and resolves any disputes that occur between the two boards.
The governor of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia was both an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the Notes Board from 1920 to 1924 and of the eight directors of the Commonwealth Bank from 1924 to 1945. The Commonwealth Bank and Bank Acts in 1945 stated the governor&#x27;s responsibilities of managing the CBA. In 1951, legislation established a 10-member board of which the CBA governor was a member. The CBA has maintained a similar structure since 1951.

The RBA governor is required by the &quot;Reserve Bank Act 1959&quot; to keep in contact with the Treasury Secretary on matters concerning both the Treasury and Reserve Bank and vice versa. It also mandates that the RBA board inform the government of the bank&#x27;s monetary and banking policy, which is often accomplished through the governor&#x27;s meetings with the Treasurer. Since 1996, the governor and other senior members of the RBA have appeared twice annually before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics to explain the conduct of the bank. 

===List of Governors of the CBA and RBA===


The longest-serving governor, if his periods of service to both the Commonwealth Bank and the Reserve Bank of Australia are included, is H. C. Coombs, who served nineteen years and six months combined. He is regarded by some as one of the most committed anti-inflationists in government throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The longest-serving Commonwealth Bank governor is Sir Ernest Riddle, who served eleven years and four months, while the longest-serving Reserve Bank governor is Ian Macfarlane, who served ten years. The shortest-serving governor by many years is James Kell, who served two years for the Commonwealth Bank.

In July 2023, the RBA announced the appointment of Michele Bullock as its new Governor, taking up the role in September 2023. This made Bullock the RBA&#x27;s first female Governor.

==Reserve Bank Board==

The Reserve Bank Board consists of nine members, including three &quot;ex officio&quot; members: the Governor of the Reserve Bank, who is Chair of the Board; the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, who is the Deputy Chair of the Board; and the Secretary to the Treasury.

The board also has six external members who are appointed by the Treasurer for five years. According to section 17(1) of the &quot;Reserve Bank Act&quot;, members of the board are not allowed to be a director, officer, or employee of an institution that is authorised to take in deposits. Excluding changes in the number of members, the structure of the board has remained unchanged since 1951.

The current members of the board are:

The board normally meets eleven times each year, on the first Tuesday of each month except January. Board meetings are usually held at the Reserve Bank&#x27;s Head Office in Sydney. Meetings are held in two other Australian cities each year. Five members of the board must meet in order to constitute a quorum, and the meeting must be chaired by the governor, or the deputy governor in his absence.

The board usually forms a consensus without a need for structured voting on the issues at hand. Meetings of the board are held in the boardroom of the Reserve Bank&#x27;s Head Office in Sydney or a similar facility in one of the bank&#x27;s State Offices when meetings are held interstate (a secure location is used in Australian cities where the bank does not have its own premises). The meetings begin at 9:00 am and continue for three-and-a-half hours, with minutes published two weeks after the meeting is held.

==Payments System Board and Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission==
The &quot;Reserve Bank Act 1959&quot; authorises the Payments System Board to decide the Reserve Bank&#x27;s payments system policy. This is done so it can control risk, promote efficiency and to aid in competitiveness and balance in the financial system. The bank&#x27;s power through the &quot;Payment Systems Act 1998&quot; allows it to regulate any payment system and can create binding rules for security and performance in the system. If members of a payment system are at odds over issues of market risk, admission, safety and rivalry, the RBA can additionally administer arbitration with the consent of those involved. The RBA is also permitted to gather information from a payment system or participants thereof. The bank can also regulate the competition of transactions since August 2001.

The &quot;Payment Systems and Netting Act 1998&quot; gives the board power in areas of the law that were previously uncertain. It removed the zero-hour rule that allowed a bankruptcy to date a bankruptcy the previous midnight and the Act made it so payments the same day could not be undone. Before the removal of the zero-hour rule, the real-time gross settlement system had been violated because payments in the system should inherently not be reversed. Some payments systems had previously agreed to pay and receive obligations to the whole system, rather than merely maintaining their own. But in the event of a bankruptcy, the bankrupt institution did not pay what it owed back to the solvent parties, while they had to pay their dues to the failed bank. This was later changed, when cheques were deemed void if the bankrupt institution does not have the funds to back them up, after the &quot;Cheques Act 1986&quot; was amended in 1998. The &quot;Trade Practices Act 1974&quot; generally does not allow competitors to make cooperative agreements, but the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) is permitted to make exceptions for competitors making agreements among themselves. The ACCC and the Payments Systems Board are encouraged to work together regarding access and rivalry through the &quot;Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998&quot;.

Members of the Payments System Board are defined by Section 25A of the &quot;Reserve Bank Act 1959&quot;, with three of the members being &quot;ex officio&quot; or representatives of another organisation. The governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia is the Chairman of the Payments System Board, there is one representative of the RBA, and there is one representative of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). In addition, there are up to five other members of the board who are appointed by the Treasurer for a term of up to five years. The board meet once per quarter, usually in Sydney with five members forming a quorum, which must be chaired by the Governor or, in his or her absence, the Deputy Chair. The Chairman meets with the Chairman of the ACCC at least once annually on issues of interest to both parties in the payments system, in addition to members of both organisations consulting over issues that are mutually important.

The current members of the Payments System Board are:

==History ==
From the middle of the 19th century into the 1890s, the prospects for the forming of a central bank grew. In 1911, the Commonwealth Bank was established, but did not have the authority to print notes, which function was still that of the Treasury. A movement toward re-establishing the gold standard occurred after World War I (1914–1918) with John Garvan leading various boards in contracting the money supply on the route to doing so, and the gold standard was instituted for both the British pound sterling and the Australian pound in 1925.

During the Great Depression, the Australian pound became devalued, no longer worth the same as the pound sterling, and formally departed from the gold standard with the Commonwealth Bank Act of 1932. Legislation in 1945 led to regulation of private banks which Herbert Coombs was opposed to, and when he became governor in 1949, he gave them more overall control over their institutions. When the monetary authorities implemented the advice of Coombs to have a flexible interest rate, it allowed the bank to rely more on open market operations. In 1980 the issue of short-term government bonds—Treasury notes of 13 and 26 weeks&#x27; duration—changed from a tap system, in which the price was set, to a tender system in which the volume of stock was set and the price determined by the market. Soon afterwards the tender system was extended to the issue of longer-term government bonds.

The float of the Australian dollar happened in 1983, around the same period of time that the financial system in Australia was deregulated. Administration of the banks was transferred in 1998 from the bank to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Payments System Board was created, while the bank was given power within the board in the same year. The current governor of the Reserve Bank is Michele Bullock, who succeeded Philip Lowe as governor on 18 September 2023.

In May 2022, the bank increased the nation&#x27;s interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. This move was designed to combat high rates of inflation. The move generated considerable discussion, as it was taken during a federal election campaign that was heavily focused on increased costs of living.

===Mid-19th century–1924===
Proposals for a national bank in Australia were first raised in the mid-19th century, and got a significant boost in the 1890s as a result of the Australian banking crisis of 1893 during which many commercial banks and building societies collapsed, leading to a general economic depression. The Australian Labor Party, formed during this period, proposed a bank which would be a protected and cheap way of providing financial services. The party&#x27;s platform for the 1908 election was for a &quot;Commonwealth Bank&quot;, which would have both commercial and central bank functions.

Regardless, Fisher&#x27;s Labor government established the Commonwealth Bank by the &quot;Commonwealth Bank Act 1911&quot;, which came into effect on 22 December 1911. The new bank was a government-owned commercial bank, without any central bank functions. He stated that &quot;Time and experience will show how its functions for usefulness may be extended [towards central banking].&quot; The only function at the time that made the bank characteristic of a central one was that it was the banker to the Australian government, in addition to it being the same for the states. At the time, the Treasury of Australia maintained the role of issuing bank notes through the &quot;Australian Notes Act 1910&quot;. The bank was also the first bank in Australia to receive a federal government guarantee. 

The Commonwealth Bank gradually acquired central bank functions. In response to the disruption of trade during World War I it was given responsibility to manage the Australian government debt. Nevertheless, at the end of the war, the bank&#x27;s primary role was as a savings and trading bank. In the war, to fund the great increase in government spending, the currency of Australia went off the gold standard, as did those of the United Kingdom and other parts of the British Empire.

The Australian pound remained tied to the pound sterling. Inflation in Australia thus increased, less than in Britain, but more than in the United States. The case for a central bank was increased by the need for the government to cut spending after the war to reduce its debt. Commonwealth Bank Governor Denison Miller had been arguing for the issue of Australian currency to be switched from the treasury to the bank, as it had more staff and more monetary knowledge.

The Australian Notes Board (ANB) was created in 1920 and partially acceded to Miller&#x27;s request, in having four directors, with the governor of the bank being an &quot;ex officio&quot; member. The ANB began to follow a policy of board member John Garvan, in contracting the money supply, with the goal of reducing prices so that free convertibility of the Australian pound to gold could be re-established at pre-war rates, that is return to the former gold standard.

This was accomplished by refusing the exchange of notes for gold and it was hoped that this would lower domestic prices and raise the exchange rate for the Australian pound. When gold arrived from New York the government sold securities to diminish the effect of monetary expansion, therefore executing the first open market operations in the history of Australia and thus the first attempt of central banking.

===1924–present===

The Australian Notes Board (ANB) was created in 1920, within the Department of Treasury, which issued notes until 1924, when this function was transferred to the Commonwealth Bank. The ANB was abolished by the &quot;Commonwealth Bank Act 1924&quot;. 

The Treasurer and Country Party Leader Earle Page wanted to end the monetary contraction which particularly hurt his farming constituents, who were as a result receiving reduced export prices. The new board of directors replacing it, which was composed of various areas of the industry, soon appointed Garvan chairman, and thus he continued his policies. In 1925, both the pound sterling and Australian pound returned to the pre-war gold standard. The primary role of the Commonwealth Bank continued to be a savings and trading bank, even though the government attempted to make the bank into a central bank through its actions in 1924.

Legislation was introduced to the Parliament at the height of the Great Depression, in May 1930, by Treasurer E.G. Theodore, to transfer central banking powers from the Commonwealth Bank to a new central bank, but this failed. The Australian pound was devalued in 1931 and it ceased to be tied to the pound sterling. The Reserve Bank departed from the gold standard with the &quot;Commonwealth Bank Act 1932&quot;, which made the notes no longer exchangeable into gold and allowed the bank not to keep any gold reserves. The monetary policy of the bank from 1931 until the early 1970s had been to maintain a stable exchange rate with the pound sterling.

Through the new &quot;Commonwealth Bank Act&quot; and the &quot;Banking Act 1945&quot;, the board was replaced by a six-member council, consisting of bank and treasury officials. It additionally formalised the bank&#x27;s administrative powers of monetary and banking policy and exchange control and also stated the governor was responsible for managing the bank. Highly debated legislation in 1945 caused high amounts of regulation on private banks, which later-Governor H.C. Coombs was opposed to, along with his opposition to bank nationalisation in 1947. When he became governor in 1949, he allowed private banks to have more control over their liquidity and attempted to introduce market-based monetary policy. He also warned of the possibility of stagflation in 1959.

Legislation in 1951, substituted the council by a 10-member board which included the governor, deputy governor and the secretary to the treasury. The board took over the management of the bank from the governor. The &quot;Reserve Bank Act 1959&quot; (23 April 1959) took out the part of the Commonwealth Bank that executed central bank functions and placed it into the Reserve Bank, while the commercial and savings bank functions stayed with the Commonwealth Bank. This finally created a separate central bank for Australia in 1959, which took effect 14 January 1960, many years after several other nations already had one and similar to the early proposal by Treasurer Theodore.

In the mid-1960s, monetary authorities accepted Coombs&#x27; conclusions and allowed a flexible interest rate, making it easier for the bank to rely on open market operations. The Exchange Control was abolished after the float of the Australian dollar occurred in 1983. In the five years after the Campbell Committee probe, 1979–1984, the financial system in Australia became deregulated. Another probe was the Wallis Committee in 1996, which took effect in 1998. The effects were the transfer of overseeing the banks from the RBA to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and the creation of the Payments System Board (PSB), which would attempt to maintain the safety and performance of the payments system. The bank was given powers within the PSB through additional legislation in 1998.

In August 1996, then bank Governor-designate Ian Macfarlane and the Treasurer issued a &quot;Statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy&quot; which restated the roles of the Reserve Bank and the Government of Australia. It affirmed government endorsement of the Reserve Bank&#x27;s inflation objective, which was introduced in 1993. A change of government in December 2007 led to another &quot;Statement&quot;, which was issued by both former Treasurer Wayne Swan and Reserve Bank Governor Glenn Stevens. This amends previous statements by giving the bank independence and encourages transparency and communication.

==&quot;Securency&quot; scandal ==
Since 2007, the RBA&#x27;s reputation has been affected by the &#x27;Securency&#x27; or Note Printing Australia scandal. These RBA subsidiaries were involved in bribing overseas officials so that Australia might win lucrative polymer note-printing contracts. Australian press coverage, which continued into late 2011, reflects concerns with the apparent laxity and tardiness of corrective actions undertaken by relevant RBA board members and officials. The matters were not reported to the Federal Police in 2007, although they have been since, while in 2011 it was revealed that the RBA had to correct inaccurate evidence previously given to parliamentary committees.

In July 2014, WikiLeaks released a copy of a court order prohibiting publication throughout Australia of information that &quot;reveals, implies, suggests or alleges&quot; corruption involving specifically named past and present high-ranking Malaysian, Indonesian and Vietnamese officials in relation to the Note Printing Australia bribery allegations.

<doc id="492361" wikidata="Q1105126" url="?curid=492361" title="Cochin Jews">
<text>Cochin Jews (also known as Malabar Jews or Kochinim from ) are the oldest group of Jews in India, with roots that are claimed to date back to the time of King Solomon. The Cochin Jews settled in the Kingdom of Cochin in South India, now part of the present-day state of Kerala. As early as the 12th century, mention is made of the Jews in southern India by Benjamin of Tudela.

Following their expulsion from Iberia in 1492 by the Alhambra Decree, a few families of Sephardi Jews eventually made their way to Cochin in the 16th century. They became known as Paradesi Jews (or Foreign Jews). The European Jews maintained some trade connections to Europe, and their language skills were useful. Although the Sephardim spoke Ladino (Spanish or Judeo-Spanish), in India they learned Judeo-Malayalam from the Malabar Jews. The two communities retained their ethnic and cultural distinctions. In the late 19th century, a few Arabic-speaking Jews, known as Baghdadis, also immigrated to southern India from the Near East.

After India gained its independence in 1947 and Israel was established as a nation, most of the Cochin Jews made Aliyah and emigrated from Kerala to Israel in the mid-1950s. 
In contrast, most of the Paradesi Jews (Sephardi in origin) preferred to migrate to Australia and other Commonwealth countries, similar to the choices made by Anglo-Indians.

Most of their synagogues still exist in Kerala, with a few being sold or adapted for other uses.
Among the 8 synagogues that survived till the mid-20th century, only the Paradesi synagogue still has a regular congregation. Today it also attracts tourists as a historic site. 
The Kadavumbhagam Ernakulam Synagogue was restored in 2018, it houses a sefer torah with occasional services, managed by one of few remaining Cochin Jews of the ancient Malabar Jewish tradition. A few synagogues are in ruins and one was even demolished and a two-storeyed house was built in its place.
The synagogue at Chendamangalam (Chennamangalam) was reconstructed in 2006 as Kerala Jews Life Style Museum. 
The synagogue at Paravur (Parur) has been reconstructed as Kerala Jews History Museum.

==History==
===First Jews in South India===
P. M. Jussay wrote that it was believed that the earliest Jews in India were sailors from King Solomon&#x27;s time. It has been claimed that following the destruction of the First Temple in the Siege of Jerusalem (587 BCE), some Jewish exiles came to India. Only after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE are records found that attest to numerous Jewish settlers arriving at Cranganore, an ancient port near Cochin. Cranganore, now transliterated as Kodungallur, but also known under other names, is a city of legendary importance to this community. Fernandes writes, it is &quot;a substitute Jerusalem in India&quot;. Katz and Goldberg note the &quot;symbolic intertwining&quot; of the two cities.

Ophira Gamliel notes however that the first physical evidence of the presence of Jews in South India dates only to the granting of the Kollam copper plates. The copper plates are a trade deed dated to the year 849 C.E bestowed upon the Nestorian merchant magnate Maruvan Sapir Iso and the Saint Thomas Christian community by Ayyan Atikal, the ruler of the Kingdom of Venad. The copper plates include signatures in Kufic, Pahlavi, and Hebrew and serve as evidence of West Asian mercantilism in Kerala. 

In 1768, a certain Tobias Boas of Amsterdam had posed eleven questions to Rabbi Yehezkel Rachbi of Cochin. The first of these questions addressed to the said Rabbi concerned the origins of the Jews of Cochin and the duration of their settlement in India. In Rabbi Yehezkel&#x27;s response , he wrote: &quot;after the destruction of the Second Temple (may it soon be rebuilt and reestablished in our days!), in the year 3828 of anno mundi, i. e., 68 CE, about ten thousand men and women had come to the land of Malabar and were pleased to settle in four places; those places being Cranganore, Dschalor, Madai [and] Plota. Most were in Cranganore, which is also called &quot;Mago dera Patinas&quot;; it is also called Sengale.&quot;

Saint Thomas, an Aramaic-speaking Jew from the Galilee region of Israel and one of the disciples of Jesus, is believed to have come to Southern India in the 1st century, in search of the Jewish community there. It is possible that the Jews who became Christians at that time were absorbed by what became the Nasrani Community in Kerala.

A number of scholars have noted that the Cochin Jews maintain striking cultural similarities to the Knanaya, Jewish-Christian migrants from Persia who settled in Kodungallur, Kerala in the 4th or 8th century. These symmetries are noted in both the wedding traditions and especially the folk songs of the two communities, some songs maintaining the exact same lyrics with few corruptions and variations.

Central to the history of the Cochin Jews was their close relationship with Indian rulers. This was codified on a set of copper plates granting the community special privileges. The date of these plates, known as &quot;Sâsanam&quot;, is contentious. The plates are physically inscribed with the date 379 CE, but in 1925, tradition was setting it as 1069 CE. Indian rulers granted the Jewish leader Joseph Rabban the rank of prince over the Jews of Cochin, giving him the rulership and tax revenue of a pocket principality in Anjuvannam near Cranganore, and rights to seventy-two &quot;free houses&quot;.

The Hindu king gave permission in perpetuity (or, in the more poetic expression of those days, &quot;as long as the world, sun and moon endure&quot;) for Jews to live freely, build synagogues, and own property &quot;without conditions attached&quot;. A family connection to Rabban, &quot;the king of Shingly&quot; (another name for Cranganore), was long considered a sign of both purity and prestige within the community. Rabban&#x27;s descendants led this distinct community until a chieftainship dispute broke out between two brothers, one of them named Joseph Azar, in the 16th century.

The Jewish traveler Benjamin of Tudela, speaking of Kollam (Quilon) on the Malabar Coast, writes in his &quot;Itinerary&quot;:&quot;[t]hroughout the island, including all the towns thereof, live several thousand Israelites. The inhabitants are all black, and the Jews also. The latter are good and benevolent. They know the law of Moses and the prophets, and to a small extent the Talmud and Halacha.&quot;These people later became known as the Malabari Jews. They built synagogues in Kerala beginning in the 12th and 13th centuries. The oldest known gravestone of a Cochin Jew is written in Hebrew and dates to 1269 CE. It is near the Chendamangalam Synagogue, built in 1614, which is now operated as a museum.

In 1341, a disastrous flood silted up the port of Cranganore, and trade shifted to a smaller port at Cochin (Kochi). Many of the Jews moved quickly, and within four years, they had built their first synagogue at the new community.

The Portuguese Empire established a trading beachhead in 1500, and until 1663 remained the dominant power. They continued to discriminate against the Jews, although doing business with them. A synagogue was built at Parur in 1615, at a site that according to tradition had a synagogue built in 1165. Almost every member of this community emigrated to Israel in 1954.
In 1524, the Muslims, backed by the ruler of Calicut (today called Kozhikode and not to be confused with Calcutta), attacked the wealthy Jews of Cranganore because of their primacy in the lucrative pepper trade. The Jews fled south to the Kingdom of Cochin, seeking the protection of the Cochin Royal Family (Perumpadapu Swaroopam). The Hindu Raja of Cochin gave them asylum. Moreover, he exempted Jews from taxation but bestowed on them all privileges enjoyed by the tax-payers.

The Malabar Jews built additional synagogues at Mala and Ernakulam. In the latter location, Kadavumbagham Synagogue was built about 1200 and restored in the 1790s. Its members believed they were the congregation to receive the historic copper plates. In the 1930s and 1940s, the congregation was as large as 2,000 members, but all emigrated to Israel.

Thekkambagham Synagogue was built in Ernakulam in 1580, and rebuilt in 1939. It is the synagogue in Ernakulam sometimes used for services if former members of the community visit from Israel. In 1998, five families who were members of this congregation still lived in Kerala or in Madras.

===A Jewish traveler&#x27;s visit to Cochin===
The following is a description of the Jews of Cochin by 16th-century Jewish traveler Zechariah Dhahiri (recollections of his travels &quot;circa&quot; 1558).
===1660 to independence===

The Paradesi Jews, also called &quot;White Jews&quot;, settled in the Cochin region in the 16th century and later, following the expulsion from Iberia due to forced conversion and religious persecution in Spain and then Portugal. Some fled north to Holland but the majority fled east to the Ottoman Empire. Both &quot;Black Jews&quot; and the &quot;White Jews&quot; (the Spanish Jews) of Malabar claimed that they are the true inheritors of the old Jewish culture.

Some went beyond that territory, including a few families who followed the Arab spice routes to southern India. Speaking Ladino language and having Sephardic customs, they found the Malabari Jewish community as established in Cochin to be quite different. According to the historian Mandelbaum, there were resulting tensions between the two ethnic communities. The European Jews had some trade links to Europe and useful languages to conduct international trade 

When the Portuguese occupied the Kingdom of Cochin, they allegedly discriminated against its Jews. Nevertheless, to some extent they shared language and culture, so ever more Jews came to live under Portuguese rule (actually under the Spanish crown, again, between 1580 and 1640). The Protestant Dutch killed the raja of Cochin, allied of the Portuguese, plus sixteen hundred Indians in 1662, during their siege of Cochin. The Jews, having supported the Dutch military attempt, suffered the murderous retaliation of both the Portuguese and Malabar populations. A year later, the second Dutch siege was successful and, after slaughtering the Portuguese, they demolished most Catholic churches or turned them into Protestant churches (not sparing the one where Vasco da Gama had been buried). They were more tolerant of Jews, having granted asylum claims in the Netherlands. (See the Goa Inquisition for the situation of Jews in nearby Goa.)

The Paradesi Jews built their own house of worship, the Paradesi Synagogue. The latter group was very small by comparison to the Malabaris. Both groups practiced endogamous marriage, maintaining their distinctions. Both communities claimed special privileges and the greater status over each other.

In the early 20th century, Abraham Barak Salem (1882–1967), a young lawyer who became known as a &quot;Jewish Gandhi&quot;, worked to end the discrimination against &quot;meshuchrarim&quot; Jews. Inspired by Indian nationalism and Zionism, he also tried to reconcile the divisions among the Cochin Jews. He became both an Indian nationalist and Zionist. His family were descended from &quot;meshuchrarim&quot;. The Hebrew word denoted a manumitted slave, and was at times used in a derogatory way. Salem fought against the discrimination by boycotting the Paradesi Synagogue for a time. He also used &quot;satyagraha&quot; to combat the social discrimination. According to Mandelbaum, by the mid-1930s many of the old taboos had fallen with a changing society.

Although India is noted for having four distinct Jewish communities, &quot;viz&quot; Cochin, Bene Israel (of Bombay and its environs), Calcutta, and New Delhi, communications between the Jews of Cochin and the Bene Israel community were greatest in the mid-19th century. According to native Bene Israel historian Haeem Samuel Kehimkar (1830-1909), several prominent members from the &quot;White Jews&quot; of Cochin had moved to Bombay in 1825 from Cochin, of whom are specifically named Michael and Abraham Sargon, David Baruch Rahabi, Hacham Samuel, and Judah David Ashkenazi. These exerted themselves not only in changing the minds of the Bene-Israel and of their children generally, but also particularly in turning the minds of these few of the Bene-Israel, who through heathen influence had gone astray from the path of the religion of their forefathers, to the study of their own religion, and to the contemplation of God. David Rahabi effected a religious revival at Revandanda, followed by his successor, Hacham Samuel.

Although David Rahabi was convinced that the Bene Israel were the descendants of the Jews, he still wanted to examine them further. He therefore gave their women clean and unclean fish to be cooked together, but they singled out the clean from the unclean ones, saying that they never used fish that had neither fins nor scales. Being thus satisfied, he began to teach them the tenets of the Jewish religion. He taught Hebrew reading, without translation, to three Bene Israel young men from the families of Jhiratker, Shapurker and Rajpurker. 

Another influential man from Cochin, who is alleged to have been of Yemenite Jewish origin, was Hacham Shelomo Salem Shurrabi who served as a &quot;Hazan&quot; (Reader) in the then newly formed synagogue of the Bene-Israel in Bombay for the trifling sum of 100 rupees &quot;per annum&quot;, although he worked also as a book-binder. While engaged in his avocation, he was at all times ready to explain any scriptural difficulty that might happen to be brought to him by any Bene Israel. He was a Reader, Preacher, Expounder of the Law, &quot;Mohel&quot; and &quot;Shochet&quot;. He died on 17 April 1856 in Bombay.

==Since 1947==
India became independent from British rule in 1947 and Israel established itself as a nation in 1948. With the heightened emphasis on the Partition of India into a secular republic of India and a semi-theocratic Pakistan, most of the Cochin Jews emigrated from India. Generally they went to Israel (made aliyah).
Many of the migrants joined the &quot;moshavim&quot; (agricultural settlements) of Nevatim, Shahar, Yuval, and Mesilat Zion. Others settled in the neighbourhood of Katamon in Jerusalem, and in Beersheba, Ramla, Dimona, and Yeruham, where many Bene Israel had settled. The migrated Cochin Jews still continue to speak Malayalam. Since the late 20th century, former Cochin Jews have also immigrated to the United States. It is recorded that currently only 26 Jews live in Kerala, who is located in different parts of Kerala such as Cochin, Kottayam and Thiruvalla.

In Cochin, the Paradesi Synagogue is still active as a place of worship, but the Jewish community is very small. The building also attracts visitors as a historic tourist site.

February 3, 2005, the Cochin Royal Family Heritage Historical Society along with the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation and Dr. Kenneth X. Robbins M.D. presented a historical interpretive marker in the Kalikota Palace in Ernakulim. It is sited below the painting of His Highness, Rama Varma Pareekshith Thampuran, the Last Maharaja of Cochin.

The text is written in English with Hebrew additions from the Prophet Jeremiah and the 72 Psalm of King David. 

″1949“...A glorious chapter of unbroken love and affection on the one hand, and deep devotion and loyalty on the other, between the Maharajas of Cochin and their Jewish subjects... The memory of your early association with this country has always been pleasant. Your people began to visit this coast as early as the days of King Solomon. In the early centuries of the Christian era, some of them left their hearts and homes and settled in Cochin. The people of Cochin welcomed you with open arms, and the Ruling Family protected you from plunder and persecution. My grandmother used to tell us of the very pleasant hours she and the other princesses of her age spent in the company of your womenfolk who usually gathered at the palace in the afternoon. This temple of historic importance is a standing monument of religious tolerance and hospitality that has prevailed here since time immemorial. I am glad to say no other people deserved such treatment better. You have, on occasions, more than one shown your unflinching loyalty to the King and country that adopted you and gave you shelter. I assure you that all legitimate interests of the minorities shall be scrupulously safeguarded...”

==Genetic analysis==

Genetic testing into the origins of the Cochin Jewish and other Indian Jewish communities noted that until the present day the Indian Jews maintained in the range of 3%-20% Middle Eastern ancestry, confirming the traditional narrative of migration from the Middle East to India. The tests noted however that the communities had considerable Indian admixture, exhibiting the fact that the Indian Jewish people &quot;inherited their ancestry from Middle Eastern and Indian populations&quot;.

==Traditions and way of life==

The 12th-century Jewish traveller Benjamin of Tudela wrote about the Malabari coast of Kerala: &quot;They know the law of Moses and the prophets, and to a small extent the Talmud and Halacha.&quot; European Jews sent texts to the community of Cochin Jews to teach them about normative Judaism.

Maimonides (1135–1204), the preeminent Jewish philosopher of his day, wrote,
&quot;Only lately, some well-to-do men came forward and purchased three copies of my code [the Mishneh Torah], which they distributed through messengers... Thus, the horizon of these Jews was widened, and the religious life in all communities as far as India revived.&quot;

In a 1535 letter sent from Safed to Italy, David del Rossi wrote that a Jewish merchant from Tripoli had told him the India town of Shingly (Cranganore) had a large Jewish population who dabbled in yearly pepper trade with the Portuguese. As far as their religious life, he wrote that they &quot;only recognize the Code of Maimonides, and possessed no other authority or traditional law&quot;. According to the contemporary historian Nathan Katz, Rabbi Nissim of Gerona (the Ran) visited the Cochini Jews. They preserve in their song books the poem he wrote about them. In the Kadavumbhagam synagogue, a Hebrew school was available for both &quot;children&#x27;s education and adult study of Torah and Mishnah&quot;.

The &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; (1901-1906) said,
&quot;Though they neither eat nor drink together, nor intermarry, the Black and the White Jews of Cochin have almost the same social and religious customs. They hold the same doctrines, use the same ritual (Sephardic), observe the same feasts and fasts, dress alike, and have adopted the same language Malayalam. ... The two classes are equally strict in religious observances&quot;,According to Martine Chemana, the Jews of Cochin &quot;coalesced around the religious fundamentals: devotion and strict obedience to Biblical Judaism, and to the Jewish customs and traditions ... Hebrew, taught through the Torah texts by rabbis and teachers who came especially from Yemen.&quot;

=== Piyyutim ===
The Jews of Cochin had a long tradition of singing devotional hymns (piyyutim) and songs on festive occasions such as Purim. Women used to sing Jews songs in Judeo-Malayalam. They did not adhere to the Talmudic prohibition against public singing by women (kol isha).

==Judeo-Malayalam==
Judeo-Malayalam (; ) is the traditional language of the Kochinim, spoken today by a few dozens of people in Israel and by probably fewer than 25 in India. In their antiquity, Malabar Jews may have used Judeo-Persian as evident from the Kollam Copper plates.

Judeo-Malayalam is the only known Dravidian Jewish language. Since it does not differ substantially in grammar or syntax from other colloquial Malayalam dialects, it is not considered by many linguists to be a language in its own right, but a dialect, or simply a language variation. Judeo-Malayalam shares with other Jewish languages like Ladino, Judeo-Arabic, and Yiddish, common traits and features. For example, verbatim translations from Hebrew to Malayalam, archaic features of Old Malayalam, Hebrew components agglutinated to Dravidian verb and noun formations and special idiomatic usages based on its Hebrew loanwords. Due to the lack of long-term scholarship on this language variation, there is no separate designation for the language (if it can be so considered), for it to have its own language code (&quot;see also SIL and ISO 639&quot;).

Unlike many Jewish languages, Judeo-Malayalam is not written using the Hebrew alphabet. It does, however, like most Jewish languages, contain many Hebrew loanwords, which are regularly transliterated, as much as possible, using the Malayalam script. Like many other Jewish languages, Judeo-Malayalam also contains a number of lexical, phonological and syntactic archaisms, in this case, from the days before Malayalam became fully distinguished from Tamil.
==Cochin Jewish synagogues==
A synagogue is called a beit knesset (Mal: &quot;ബേത് ക്‌നേസേത്&quot; | Heb: &quot;בית&quot; &quot;כנסת&quot;) in Judeo-Malayalam or &quot;Jootha Palli&quot; (Mal: &quot;ജൂതപള്ളി&quot;) with &quot;joothan&quot; meaning Jew in Malayalam and -&quot;palli&quot; a suffix added to prayer houses of the Abrahamic faiths. Throughout their history numerous synagogues have been constructed and lost to time. in their first settlement at Shingly (Cranganore), there were 18 synagogues as per their oral traditions. Today no archaeological evidence has been yet uncovered to validate these traditions. However the custom of naming their synagogues as &quot;&quot;Thekkumbhagam&quot; (lit: south side) and &quot;Kadavumbhagam&quot;&quot; (lit: River side) is cited as a cultural memory of two such synagogues that once stood in Muziris. Several oral songs sung by Cochini women also contain references to these synagogues. Apart from these, numerous Syrian Christian churches of the St. Thomas Christian community in Kerala claim to have been built on old synagogues, though archaeological evidence is scarce.

<text>The Farnese Hercules () is an ancient statue of Hercules made in the early third century AD and signed by Glykon, who is otherwise unknown; he was an Athenian but he may have worked in Rome. Like many other Ancient Roman sculptures it is a copy or version of a much older Greek original that was well known, in this case a bronze by Lysippos (or one of his circle) that would have been made in the fourth century BC. This original survived for over 1500 years until it was melted down by Crusaders in 1205 during the Sack of Constantinople. The enlarged copy was made for the Baths of Caracalla in Rome (dedicated in 216 AD), where the statue was recovered in 1546, and is now in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples. The heroically-scaled &quot;Hercules&quot; is one of the most famous sculptures of antiquity, and has fixed the image of the mythic hero in the European imagination.

The &quot;Farnese Hercules&quot; is a massive marble statue, following a lost original that was cast in bronze through a method called lost wax casting. It depicts a muscular, yet weary, Hercules leaning on his club, which has the skin of the Nemean lion draped over it. In myths about Heracles, killing the lion was his first task. He has just performed one of the last of The Twelve Labours, which is suggested by the apples of the Hesperides he holds behind his back.

The type was well known in antiquity, and among many other versions a Hellenistic or Roman bronze reduction, found at Foligno is in the Musée du Louvre. A small Roman marble copy can be seen over the Museum of the Ancient Agora, Athens (see illustration).

== Description ==
Hercules is depicted in a moment of rest, but full of strength. Leaning on his gnarled club, which is draped in the skin of the Nemean lion, he holds the golden apples stolen from the Hesperides, hiding them behind his back, in his right hand.

== History ==
The rediscovered statue quickly made its way into the collection of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, grandson of Pope Paul III. Alessandro Farnese was well placed to form one of the greatest collections of classical sculpture that had been assembled since antiquity. It stood for generations in its own room at Palazzo Farnese, Rome, where the statue was surrounded by frescoed depictions of the hero&#x27;s mythical feats that were created by Annibale Carracci and his studio, executed in the 1590s. The Farnese statue was moved to Naples in 1787 with most of the Farnese Collection and is now displayed in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale there.

The sculpture has been reassembled and restored by degrees. According to a letter of Guglielmo della Porta, the head had been recovered separately, from a well in Trastevere, and was bought for Farnese through the agency of della Porta, whose legs made to complete the figure were so well-regarded that when the original legs were recovered from ongoing excavations in the Baths of Caracalla, della Porta&#x27;s were retained, on Michelangelo&#x27;s advice, in part to demonstrate that modern sculptors could bear direct comparison with the ancients. The original legs, from the Borghese collection, were not reunited with the sculpture until 1787. Goethe, in his Italian Journey, recounts his differing impressions upon seeing the Hercules with each set of legs, however, marvelling at the clear superiority of the original ones.

Hercules is caught in a rare moment of repose. Leaning on his knobby club which is draped with the pelt of the Nemean lion, he holds the apples of the Hesperides, but conceals them behind his back cradled in his right hand. Many engravings and woodcuts spread the fame of the Farnese&#x27;s Hercules. By 1562 the find was already included in the set of engravings for &quot;Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae&quot; (&quot;Mirror of Rome&#x27;s Magnificence&quot;) and connoisseurs, artists, and tourists gaped at the original, which stood in the courtyard of the Palazzo Farnese, protected under the arcade. In 1590–91, during his trip to Rome, Hendrik Goltzius sketched the statue in the palazzo courtyard. Later (in 1591) Goltzius recorded the less-common rear view, in a bravura engraving (&quot;illustration, right&quot;), which emphasizes the already exaggerated muscular form with swelling and tapering lines that flow over the contours. The young Rubens made quick sketches of the planes and massing of the statue of Hercules. Before photography, prints were the only way to put the image into many hands.
The sculpture was admired from the start, reservations about its exaggerated musculature only surfacing in the later eighteenth century. Napoleon remarked to Antonio Canova that its omission from the museum he accumulated in Paris was the most important gap in the collection. More than once, the sculpture was crated and made ready for shipment to Paris before the Napoleonic regime fled Naples.

== List of other ancient copies ==

The prominently sited statue was well liked by the Ancient Romans, and copies have been found in Roman palaces and gymnasiums: another, coarser copy stood in the courtyard of Palazzo Farnese; one with the feigned (but probably ancient) inscription &quot;Lykippos&quot; has stood in the court of Palazzo Pitti, Florence, since the sixteenth century. Ancient copies of the statue include:
* Hercules, 2nd century AD, Roman copy, Uffizi Gallery, Florence.
* The &quot;Weary Herakles&quot; is a heavily broken Roman marble statue that was excavated in 1980 in Perge, Turkey. The looted upper torso was sold to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in 1981. The upper torso was returned to Turkey in 2011 and is now displayed with the rest of the piece at the Antalya Museum.

== Later copies ==
After rediscovery of the Farnese Hercules, copies appeared in sixteenth and eighteenth-century gardens throughout Europe. During construction of the Alameda de Hercules (1574) in Seville, the oldest public garden preserved in Europe, at its entrance were installed two columns from a Roman temple, elements of a building still preserved in the &quot;Mármoles&quot;, an unquestionable sign of admiration for the Roman archaeological sites. On them were placed two sculptures by Diego de Pesquera, in 1574, recognizing Hercules as founder of the city, and Julius Caesar, restorer of Híspalis. The first was a copy of the Farnese Hercules, nearly the monumental size of the original. At Wilhelmshöhe, near Kassel, a colossal version 8.5 m high produced by Johann Jacob Anthoni, 1713–1717, has become a symbol for the city.

André Le Nôtre placed a full-size gilded version against the skyline at the far end of the main vista at Vaux-le-Vicomte. At the Palace of Versailles is a copy by Jean Cornu (1684–86). In Scotland a copy made in lead in 1743 by John Cheere is sited incongruously in the central Highlands, overlooking the recently restored Hercules Garden in the grounds of Blair Castle. A further early eighteenth-century lead copy can be found in England, at the Quarry in Shrewsbury. Wealthy collectors were able to afford any one of numerous bronze replicas, created in various sizes for free-standing or table-top display.

The statue is shown in the 1954 film &quot;Journey to Italy&quot; along with the Farnese Bull.

A replica, titled &quot;Herakles in Ithaka I&quot;, was erected in 1989 on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. The statue was a gift from its sculptor, Jason Seley, a professor of fine arts. Seley created the sculpture in 1981 out of chrome automobile bumpers.

The statue has inspired artists such as Jeff Koons and Matthew Darbyshire to create their own versions in plaster and polystyrene, respectively. Their use of white materials to re-create the sculpture has been interpreted by classicist Aimee Hinds as a perpetuation of colourism in classical art.

A copy of the sculpture is among the ten statues adorning the front yard of the Schlossgarten in Karlsruhe, Germany.

<doc id="492391" wikidata="Q7775597" url="?curid=492391" title="The Women (play)">
<text>The Women is a 1936 American play, a comedy of manners by Clare Boothe Luce. Only women compose the cast. 

The original Broadway production, directed by Robert B. Sinclair, opened on December 26, 1936, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, where it ran for 657 performances with an all-female cast that included Margalo Gillmore, Ilka Chase, Betty Lawford, Jessie Busley, Phyllis Povah, Marjorie Main, and Arlene Francis.

==Synopsis==
The play is a commentary on the pampered lives and power struggles of various wealthy Manhattan socialites and up-and-coming women and the gossip that propels and damages their relationships. While men frequently are the subject of their lively discussions and drive the action on-stage, they never are seen or heard.

==Production==
Following a premiere December 7, 1936, at the Forrest Theatre in Philadelphia, &quot;The Women&quot; opened December 26, 1936, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre in New York City. Produced by Max Gordon, the original Broadway production was directed by Robert B. Sinclair with settings by Jo Mielziner and costumes by John Hambleton. 

The play was revived on Broadway in 1973 at the 46th Street Theatre, running April 25-June 17, with 63 performances. It was directed by Morton Da Costa, with scenic design by Oliver Smith, costume design by Ann Roth, and lighting design by John Gleason. Other supporting staff included: production stage manager Victor Straus; stage managers Nick Malekos and Suzanne Egan; costume supervisor Ray Diffen; press representatives Shirley Herz and Stuart Fink. 

A second revival opened November 8, 2001, at the American Airlines Theatre and closed January 13, 2002, after a 77 performances. Production staff included Director Scott Elliott, with assisting direction by Marie Masters; production stage manager Peter Hanson; stage manager Valerie A. Peterson; scenic designer Derek McLane; costume designer Isaac Mizrahi; lighting designer Brian MacDevitt; and sound designer Douglas J. Cuomo. Jeff Francis did hair design, and Gary Arave designed the wigs.

<doc id="492394" wikidata="Q2918103" url="?curid=492394" title="Signal (bridge)">
<text>A (bridge) signal is a move in the card game of contract bridge in which partners defending against a contract play particular cards in a manner which gives a coded meaning or &quot;signal&quot; to guide their subsequent card play. This may also be referred to as &quot;carding&quot;. Signals are usually given with the cards from the two-spot to the nine-spot. There are three types of signals:
* attitude signals – the most frequently used, to encourage or discourage continuation of the suit led by partner
* count signals – showing either an even or odd number of cards held in the suit led and
* suit preference signals – the least frequently used, indicating partiality for a specific side suit.

The methods used for each type of signal have evolved over time and fall into two broad categories:
* standard signals, where a high card or one followed by a lower card is encouraging when it is an attitude signal or shows an even number of cards when it is a count signal; and
* reverse (upside-down) signals, where the meanings are reversed. A low card or one followed by a higher card is discouraging when it is an attitude signal and shows an odd number of cards when it is a count signal.

Partnerships decide on which methods to adopt and must disclose them to their opponents. Use and interpretation is dependent upon their context, such as the contract, the auction, the opening lead or prior play, the cards visible in dummy, the cards visible in one&#x27;s hand, who has led to the current trick and whether following suit or discarding.

Accordingly, partnerships generally have an order of precedence for the interpretation of signals such as that indicated in the adjacent table. In the vast majority of cases, the third-hand follow-suit signal is an attitude signal, but when the attitude signal does not apply, it is a count signal. Usually, it is relatively easy to recognize a signal correctly when the declarer leads – either a count signal when following suit, or an attitude signal when discarding, and when they do not apply, it is a suit-preference signal.

While signals are a means of permissible communication between defenders, they are considered as providing guiding information to partner and are not absolutely binding; the partner may proceed otherwise as they deem rationally appropriate. Because the declarer is entitled to know the meaning of all partnership agreements, including defenders&#x27; signals, they are also privy to the information being exchanged; this may give way to falsecarding tactics by the defenders.

==Attitude signal==
When signaling standard attitude, a high card is encouraging and a low card is discouraging. Attitude is normally signaled when following suit to partner&#x27;s led suit and when discarding on either partner&#x27;s or declarer&#x27;s led suit.

For example, if one&#x27;s partner leads with the Ace of Spades, one might signal with the nine if the King is held (requesting partner to continue the suit), or with the three if one holds nothing but spade cards with low ranks (notifying the partner that a switch to another suit is likely best).

One can only signal with the cards held. Signaling low is easy, but if one&#x27;s lowest card is the eight, one&#x27;s partner might have difficulty &quot;reading&quot; it as low. When signaling high, play the highest card possible. Having easily readable cards to signal relies on luck.

Suppose the declarer draws trumps and one is out on the third round. Discarding should be an attitude signal for one&#x27;s partner. For example, playing a high diamond card can ask one&#x27;s partner to lead with diamonds if they gain the lead. Normally, one would have an honor or honors in diamonds in this case. Playing a low diamond card asks one&#x27;s partner to &quot;not&quot; lead with diamonds if they gain the lead.

If declarer plays another round of trump, one may be able to play another diamond: this will make it unambiguous to one&#x27;s partner whether one is encouraging diamonds (by playing high-low) or discouraging diamonds (by playing low-high).

===Attitude signals at notrump contracts===
With standard attitude signals one generally plays the highest card you can afford for that purpose. Typically attitude signals are made when partner leads an honor (either on the opening lead or later) and requests a continuation. The usual reason for this is that one possesses an honor equal to the honor played or promised by the lead. Against a notrump contract (especially on the opening lead), one&#x27;s partner will lead an honor from a solid or broken sequence, such as QJ10 or KQ10. With less solid holdings like QJxx(x) or KQxx(x) partner will lead with their fourth best card. The reason to signal is, if partner leads from a broken sequence and there are small cards in dummy, partner may not know whether to continue the suit.

&quot;Examples:&quot;

Partner leads the king against a notrump contract. With J83, one would play the 8, so that if partner has something like KQ1062 and declarer A95 they can continue the suit without giving up a trick if the declarer lets it hold.
If one plays the 3, one&#x27;s partner may take this view of the suit, and may switch to another suit hoping to get one in to lead though declarer&#x27;s probable jack. It is also possible that one have the singleton or doubleton 8, in which case declarer would have 4 or 5 cards in the suit with the bidding revealing that. If the declarer had bid the suit, one&#x27;s partner would also be less likely to lead from a broken honor sequence or lead the suit.

Some players agree to unblock their highest honor when a King is led against a notrump contract, and with no honor to give a count signal.

===When not to signal===
The general principle is to not signal if doing so will help the declarer more than the defenders.

Example 1: One assumes they hold virtually all of the defensive cards, and their partner will most likely never gain the lead. Signalling is strongly discouraged. One&#x27;s partner, on the other hand, knowing the situation, should consider signalling honestly.

Example 2: Signalling against a slam is dangerous. Make the declarer work as hard as possible.

==Count signal==
The standard count signal is to play high-low with an even number of cards, and low-high with an odd number. Normally, one &quot;gives count&quot; when following suit to the declarer&#x27;s led suits. This will help one&#x27;s partner determine the distribution of the suit. See duck (bridge) for an example.

Count in the trump suit is normally inverted. Thus, high-low shows an odd number of trumps. Some partnerships (by advance agreement) signal this way only when they have a desire or ability to ruff something.

==Suit preference signal==
This signal is used infrequently. When it is clear that the choice of lead is between two suits, the play of a high card on a previous trick suggests the lead of the higher-ranking suit and a low card suggests the lower-ranking suit. There are four common cases:
*When following suit on one&#x27;s partner&#x27;s lead (complement to the attitude signal): In situations where one&#x27;s partner has made an opening lead and an attitude signal would not be meaningful, such as when dummy displays a singleton or void in the suit being led, a suit preference signal is used to indicate which of the other two suits to lead – excluding trumps and the suit originally led. The signal can also be useful when a switch to a side suit is not desired, since there are hands in which continuing the original suit or switching to a trump is the right thing to do. In this case, a middle card is often used to indicate this situation, but it can be hard to read.
*When leading in a suit one&#x27;s partner is expected to ruff: The rank of the card led suggests a preference for the suits to be returned by one&#x27;s partner after the ruff. Letting one&#x27;s partner know this may allow one to regain the lead for another ruff. For example, in each of the two hands below, partner has led what is likely a singleton club against a 4 contract. After winning the A, the lead of 10 for the first hand and 2 for the second hand indicates which suit partner should return.
**
*When following suit on the declarer/dummy&#x27;s lead of a long suit (complement to the count signal): When partner has a single honor, a suit preference signal shows which of dummy&#x27;s side suits is preferred for partner to return after winning a trick. If there is no side entry, the card is a count signal to show one&#x27;s partner when is best to win or duck a trick.
*When discarding – see below
*Some defenders use the trump suit to show suit preference. When a defender can afford to play either of two trump cards, following suit with the higher card first shows interest in the higher ranking suit while playing the lower card first indicates interest in the lower ranking suit. This is a non-standard agreement – see count signal above.

==Upside down count and attitude==
Some partnerships agree in advance to play Upside Down Count and Attitude (UDCA). With this agreement, the standard count and attitude signals are inverted: when signaling attitude, a low card is encouraging and a high card is discouraging; when signaling count, high-low shows odd count and low-high shows even count.

Many experienced players believe UDCA is superior to standard signaling. Most importantly, it is often easier for one&#x27;s partner to read one&#x27;s signals. Also, one does not have to &quot;waste&quot; high cards in suits you like.

UDCA, as the name states, only applies to count and attitude signals. Suit preference signals are played standard. Also, one&#x27;s leads (as opposed to signals) are unchanged—one still leads high from a doubleton, for example, barring another special agreement to the contrary.

As mentioned above, standard count in the trump suit is already &quot;upside down&quot;. Experts recommend that trump signaling be the same in UDCA as standard trump signaling, that is, when playing UDCA, signal the same in all four suits.

==Discarding agreements==
Some partnerships agree in advance to assign special meaning to the first .

===Lavinthal (McKenney)===
With this agreement, the first discard is suit preference. One does not like the led suit and does not want the suit discarded. One&#x27;s suit preference signal tells one&#x27;s partner which of the two remaining suits one prefers: a high card for the higher ranking of the remaining suits and a low card for the lower ranking. This treatment is known as Lavinthal in the United States, or McKenney in the UK. The potential disadvantage of this method is that one always have to give preference for one suit or other when one may not want any switch in particular. This can be overcome at times by signalling for an &quot;impossible&quot; switch, such as a suit in which the dummy has a very strong holding such as AKQ.

There is another slightly different Lavinthal used by &quot;SAYC OKBridge Style Simplified&quot;: discarding a low card of either remaining suit (excluding trumps and the suit one does not have) asks for the lower suit. For example, if hearts are trumps and one is discarding on clubs, then a low spade &quot;or&quot; diamond asks for a diamond. Discarding a high card of either remaining suit asks for the higher suit.

===Revolving discard===
As with Lavinthal, one has the possibility to request suit preference in two ways. A low discard indicates interest in the suit directly below (a low club signaling spades); a high discard signals preference for the suit directly above (a high spade signaling clubs). The lead suit is skipped in reading the signal. This is considered by many to be easier to remember than Lavinthal.

===Odd–even (Roman)===
With this agreement, the first discard shows the following: if it is an odd spot card (three, five, seven or nine) it is encouraging in that suit; if it is a low even spot card (deuce or four), it shows preference for the lower ranking suit of the other two suits; if it is a high even spot card (six or eight), it shows preference for the higher ranking suit. The even card often has a dual function: aside from indicating suit preference, it is also a negative indication for the suit being used for the even card. A high odd card followed by a low odd card may show both preference and count (odd or even number of cards, depending on partnership agreement).

===Surrogate===
A surrogate suit is one played by the declarer in which a defender does not need to signal his attitude or count nor use to give a preference signal; usually the trump suit is a good surrogate suit if a trump echo is not needed. The suit in which the count will be given is called the target suit.

==Disclosure==
The declarer is entitled to know what signaling agreements one has with one&#x27;s partner, and one must disclose them if asked. However, one does not have to interpret any particular play (and should not, because it might transmit information to one&#x27;s partner). For example, if partner plays the 5 of clubs and one is asked what it means, one can say &quot;a high club encourages clubs, a low club discourages clubs&quot; (assuming that is your agreement). If one sees the 4, 3, and 2 in your hand, one knows that the 5 is a low club and therefore discouraging, but one should refrain from saying so. As far as one&#x27;s partner knows it might equally well be declarer who holds those cards and then you might misread the 5 as encouraging.

Most regulating bodies in bridge also prohibit the use of encrypted signals. These signals convey a message that can only be interpreted by knowing some specifics of the hands of the defenders. For example, the declarer&#x27;s bidding might promise exactly a certain number of spades. By looking at the dummy, each defender knows how many spades the other has. An agreement applied in such circumstances, such as &quot;if I have an even number of spades at the start of play, then we play standard signals on this deal, otherwise upside-down signals&quot; would be encrypted and therefore widely prohibited.

==Falsecarding==
In general, the partner will gain more from a player&#x27;s signals than the declarer&#x27;s, so it is worthwhile to signal honestly most of the time. However, since the declarer can see one&#x27;s signals as well, a player who gains a reputation for always giving accurate count, for example, may find information given away by their signals used to their disadvantage. It is common practice to throw in a misleading signal now and then.

<text>The Korean Communist Party () was a communist political party organized in Shanghai, China and Irkutsk, Russia in 1921. It has its origins in the Siberian region after the Russian Revolution. It dissolved in 1922.

==Background==
It was an organization organized that followed communism. The Korean communist movement originally arose in Siberia after the Russian Revolution. The Korean Socialist Party was organized in Khabarovsk in May 1918, and the &#x27;Irkutsk Korean Communist Party Branch&#x27;, the Korean branch of the Russian Bolshevik Party at the time, was organized in Irkutsk on January 22, 1920. The former was represented by Yi Dong-hwi, and the latter was represented by Kim Cheol-hoon. Both were fundamentally passionate independence activists. However, the difference in constitution between the two organizations was that the former was a group of naturalized people from Western Siberia, while the latter was a group of naturalized people from Eastern Siberia. The former&#x27;s purpose was to rally Koreans in Siberia to the anti-Japanese movement, and the latter&#x27;s purpose was to mobilize Koreans in western Siberia to the Bolshevik front.

==Formation==
In 1919, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was established in Shanghai. Yi Dong-hwi arrived in Shanghai at the end of August of that year and was inaugurated as the first Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. Yi Dong-hwi formed a communist group in Shanghai in the spring of 1920 as the first step toward achieving independence with the help of the Soviet Union. This organization is centered around executives of the Korean Socialist Party.

Meanwhile, in Omsk, the Korean Department of the Omsk Communist Party was formed in November 1919, and in Irkutsk, the Korean Department of the Irkutsk Communist Party was organized in January 1920. As the function of overseeing the Korean socialist movement was transferred to the Korean Department under the Eastern Peoples Department of the Siberian Department of the Communist Party, Irkutsk became the center. The leadership of the Korean Department of the Irkutsk Communist Party consists of Advisor Boris Shumyatsky, Chairman Kim Cheol-hoon, Secretary General Yi Seong, Political Department Director Andrei Han, Propaganda Department Director Choi Go-ryeo , Military Department Director Oh Hamuk, and Transportation Director Park. (Park) Inogenchi, and 26 members of the central committee. This party became the limb of the Comintern&#x27;s Oriental Secretariat, which dealt with the foreigners of Siberia. Communist education and military training were provided to Korean youth, and efforts were made to educate party members and the general public through political ideology and infiltrate Bolshevik policies through an organ called Gyeongsejong (警世鐘).

Yi Dong-hwi, Kim Rip, and others from the Korean Socialist Party formed a temporary organization called the ‘Korean Communist Party’ in Shanghai around May 1920. Meanwhile, in Irkutsk, the Central General Assembly of the Former Korean Communist Party was formed in July 1920. Both the Jaesang Korean Communist Party and the Central General Assembly of the Korean Communist Party were aiming to build a unified Communist Party organization, but they were in conflict with each other over the leadership in founding the Communist Party.

This party convened the first representative meeting of Korean communist organizations in Russia in Irkutsk in July 1920 and changed its name to the Former Korean Communist Party. Afterwards, the Korean Communist Congress was held from May 4 to 17, 1921, and another Korean Communist Party was formed to oppose Yi Dong-hwi&#x27;s Shanghai faction Korean Communist Party. This is called the Irkutsk faction of the Korean Communist Party. Since this party is a joint communist party of forces that broke away from the Shanghai faction of the Korean Communist Party and the Irkutsk faction, all former executives of the former Koryo Communist Party resigned and Ahn Byeong-chan, Han Myeong-seo, Nam Man-chun, Han Gyu- seon, Jaebok Lee was elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee. However, on November 3 of that year, several sections of the party leadership, including Chairman Kim Cheol-hoon, Secretary General Han Andrei, Political Department Director Lee Seong, Propaganda Department Director Choi Choi-ryeo, Military Government Committee Chairman Oh Hamuk, and Transportation Department Director Park Ino Genchiro, were returned to the party leadership.

In December 1920, Kim Lip, who had transported Moscow funds to Shanghai, secretly stored this money instead of giving it to the Provisional Government. As a result of this incident, Yi Dong-hwi&#x27;s prestige fell significantly, and the departure of Provisional Government officials from the communist group quickly surfaced. Yi Dong-hwi held a meeting on May 10, 1921. It was here that he finally decided to use Moscow funds for the communist movement. He also renamed the communist group the Goryeo Communist Party, and on the 23rd of that month adopted 12 amendments to the party&#x27;s provisional chapter, 5 amendments to party discipline, and 5 clauses to party politics. Therefore, the Korean Communist Party Representative Meeting was convened in Shanghai in May 1921. Representatives from Korea, Manchuria, and Vladivostok participated. At this meeting, the election statement and platform regulations were adopted, and leadership was elected including Lee Dong-hwi as a member of the Central Committee, Central Committee members Kim Lip, Lee Han-yeong, Kim Man-gyeom, and Ahn Byeong-chan, Translation Associate Member Yeo Woon-hyung, and Publication Associate Member Jo Dong-ho. This party is called the Shanghai faction of the Korean Communist Party.

Separately, the founding convention of the Korean Communist Party was held in Irkutsk in May 1921. Held for 12 days from May 4, 1921, this conference was attended by 85 representatives from 26 organizations from Korea, Soviet Union, the Far East Republic, and China. Through this convention, another Korean Communist Party was formed. Kim Man-gyeom, Kim Cheol-hoon, Jang Geon-sang, Choi Choi-ryeo, and Han Myeong-se were elected as central committee members. Many Koreans who had naturalized in Soviet Russia participated in the Korean Communist Party formed in Irkutsk.

The ‘All-Korea Communist Party Congress’ was held in Shanghai for four days from May 20, 1921. About 30 representatives of Korean communist organizations from Korea, China, Manchuria, Japan, etc. participated in this competition, and through this competition, the &#x27;Korean Communist Party&#x27; was formed. Yi Dong-hwi, Kim Lip, Park Jin-sun, Kim Cheol-soo, and Jang Deok-su were elected as central committee members.

==Factions==
These two Korean Communist Parties were called ‘Shanghai Participant Korean Communist Party’ and ‘Irkutsk Participant Korean Communist Party’ after the names of the regions in which they were formed. The Shanghai faction and the Irkutsk faction were not only different in the regions in which they were formed, but also in the revolutionary theories they pursued. The Shanghai faction of the Korean Communist Party believed that a national revolution was necessary to escape colonial rule by Japan, and that it could then transition to a proletarian revolution. However, the Irkutsk faction of the Korean Communist Party believed that the construction of the Soviet Union through socialist revolution was necessary. Later, like the Shanghai School, it changed into a two-stage revolutionary theory, but its radical nature did not disappear. These differences in revolutionary theory were even more pronounced in the policies of the National Unification Front. Because the Shanghai faction of the Korean Communist Party prioritized national revolution, it was active in pursuing broad nationalist forces and a national united front. On the other hand, the Irkutsk-affiliated Korean Communist Party was passive toward the national unification front and was negative toward alliances with nationalist forces.

===Shanghai faction===
The Korean Socialist Party was formed by Yi Dong-hwi, Park Ae, and Jeon Il, with the support of Krastochekov, chairman of the Far East People&#x27;s Committee, who was dispatched from the Bolshevik Party. At the time, the Korean Socialist Party was the only Korean Socialist (Communist) party recognized by the Comintern. Initially, it was a convenient communist organization for national liberation, but due to differences in policy with the members of the Provisional Government, it withdrew from the Provisional Government and was renamed the Korean Communist Party in May 1921.

The armed units of this faction are as follows: 
* Nihang Army: Led by Park Il-ya, was named because it was based in Nikolayevsk Port. Park renamed his unit the Sakhalin Volunteer Corps.
* Davan Army: Led by Nikolai Choi, was named after its formation in Davan, a Korean village in Khabarovsk.

===Irkutsk faction===
Meanwhile, in Irkutsk on September 5, 1919, Kim Cheol-hoon (金哲勳), Oh Hamuk (吳夏默), etc., with the support of Sumiyasky, formed the Former Korean Communist Party. The All-Korean People’s Party was organized. This organization was made official on January 22, 1920 as the &#x27;Irkutsk Communist Korean Department&#x27;, a Korean branch of the Russian Bolshevik Party. Accordingly, the function of overseeing the Korean socialist movement was transferred from Omsk to the Korean Department under the Eastern Peoples Department of the Siberian Department of the Communist Party, and Irkutsk became the center.

The leadership of the Korean Department of the Irkutsk Communist Party consists of Advisor Boris Sumiyasky, Chairman Kim Cheol-hoon, Secretary General Lee Jae-bok (aka 李檉), Political Department Director Andrei Han, Propaganda Department Director Choi Go-ryeo, Military Department Director Oh Hamuk, There are 26 central committee members, including Minister of Transportation Park Inogenchi.

This party convened the first representative meeting of Koryo communist organizations in Russia in Irkutsk in July 1920 and changed its name to the Former Korean Communist Party. Afterwards, the Korean Communist Congress was held from May 4 to 17, 1921, and another Goryeo Communist Party was formed to oppose Yi Dong-hwi&#x27;s Shanghai faction. This is called the Irkutsk faction.

The armed units of this faction are as follows:
*Freedom Battalion: A Korean partisan unit became a special Korean infantry battalion belonging to the Far East Republic. Oh Ha-muk was the commander and the garrison was in Free City.
* Korean Independence Army: Organized in 1919 in Bongo-dong, Wangcheong-hyeon, Manchuria. Their commander was Hong Beom-do.

===Factional strife===
The Shanghai faction and the Irkutsk faction, the Korean Communist Party, entered into a relationship of struggle, each claiming sole legitimacy and competing to approach the Soviet Union. The Shanghai faction expanded its power through alliances with Chinese and Japanese communists, domestic operations, and support for national armed groups. On the other hand, the Irkutsk faction expanded its influence by establishing a Shanghai branch, organizing the Shanghai Korean Communist Party, taking control of Korean military organizations in Russia, and working to turn Koreans into Bolsheviks in Russia.

==Dissolution==
As the factional strife between the two factions became more severe, the Comintern recommended reconciliation and unification, but failed. The two sides entered into a struggle over the right to command Korean resistances forces. On June 28, 1921, the Sakhalin Volunteer Corps, supported by the Shanghai Faction, fought against the Irkutsk Faction, which had joined the Russian Red Army, in Surasekhka, but was surrounded and attacked by the 29th Regiment of the Russian Red Army, leaving 144 dead and missing and 864 survivors. The Soviet Union and the Far East General Directorate ordered the disbandment of all the factions in December 1922 to organize the Corburo under the Comintern. It consisted of Yi Dong-hwi and Yun Ja-young from the Shanghai faction, and Han Myeong-seo, Jang Geon-sang, and Kim Man-gyeom from the Irkutsk faction. It is as if the Comintern forced the two Korean Communist Party factions to merge into a unified Communist Party. The unprincipled factional strife between the Shanghai and Irkutsk factions had a negative impact not only on the early communist movement but also on the entire Korean Independence Movement.

<doc id="492400" wikidata="Q1806489" url="?curid=492400" title="Yokota Air Base">
<text>, is a Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) and United States Air Force (USAF) base in the Tama Area, or Western Tokyo.

It occupies portions of Akishima, Fussa, Hamura, Mizuho, Musashimurayama, and Tachikawa.

The base houses 14,000 personnel. It occupies a total area of and has a runway.

It features the JASDF Air Defense Command Headquarters (ADC headquarters) since 26 March 2012. The headquarters of United States Forces Japan is also located there. Other base facilities are the broadcast center for the American Forces Network Tokyo radio service and a detachment of Pacific Air Forces&#x27; Band of the Pacific.

==History==
===Tama Airfield===
The facility which houses Yokota Air Base was originally constructed by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) in 1940 as Tama Airfield, and used as a flight test center. During World War II Yokota became the center of Japanese Army Air Forces flight test activities and the base was the site of the first meeting between Japanese and Italian wartime allies.

Tama was first identified by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) in November 1944 by a 3rd Reconnaissance Squadron F-13 Superfortress photo-reconnaissance aircraft, flying from Tinian in the Mariana Islands. It was identified as being associated with the aircraft manufacturing plant belonging to Nakajima Aircraft Company in the nearby town (now city) of Musashino. Along with Tachikawa Air Base to the east and the factory of Showa Aircraft Industry to the south, it was compared to the aircraft development complex of the USAAF Wright-Patterson Field in Ohio. According to the USAAF intelligence at the time, the two bases conducted all IJA flight testing. In the spring of 1945, XXI Bomber Command attacked the base eight times along with the aircraft manufacturing plant, but each time heavy clouds forced the bombers to attack secondary targets. The Nakajima plant was finally attacked in April 1945, but the Tama airfield never was bombed.

===Postwar years===
With the Surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945, a detachment of the United States Army 1st Cavalry Division arrived at the base on 4 September. The airfield&#x27;s buildings were largely intact, and some 280 of the IJA&#x27;s most modern aircraft were discovered in hangars.

The 1st Cavalry named the facility Fussa Army Airfield, then at the end of September renamed it Yokota Army Airfield after a nearby village (now incorporated in Musashimurayama) the name of which appeared on a 1944 US map.

The name was to have been changed to Wilkins Army Air Base (WAAB) after Medal of Honor recipient Raymond &quot;Ray&quot; Wilkins, but orders for this never arrived and it remained under the name Yokota Army Airfield until the USAAF became the USAF in 1947, at which point it became Yokota Air Base. Some metal manhole covers stamped &quot;WAAB&quot; remain in use around the base as of 2017.

The initial USAAF use for the base was for airlift operations when the 2d Combat Cargo Group arrived with four C-47 Skytrain squadrons. When the old runway deteriorated under heavy usage, the runway was repaired and Yokota supported operations of the A-26 Invader-equipped 3d Bombardment Group by August 1946. Additional construction during the 1940s and 1950s was completed and the base reached its current size around 1960.
On the occasion of extension, the course of Hachiko Line and National Route 16 was changed, and Itsukaichi Kaidō was divided.

During the initial postwar occupation years, Yokota hosted the following known USAAF/USAF units:

*20th Combat Mapping Group (October 1945 – April 1946) (F-7 Liberator)
*8th Reconnaissance Group (June 1946 – October 1947) (F-7)
*71st Reconnaissance Group (February 1947 – April 1949) (RB-17, RB-29, RF-51, RF-61 and RF-80)

These units performed photographic reconnaissance and mapping of Japan and South Korea.

*6th Night Fighter Squadron (1946–47) (P-61A/B)Inactivated and personnel, mission and equipment transferred to 339th Fighter Squadron (347th Fighter Group) with F-82F/G Twin Mustangs at Nagoya Air Base.
*82nd Photo Reconnaissance Squadron (1947–48) (FP-80)
*3d Emergency Rescue Squadron (July 1947 – April 1950) (SB-17G)Flew modified B-17G bombers equipped with a 27-foot boat (termed the A-1) under their bellies that could be dropped by parachute and contained enough food, water, and clothing for twelve survivors to last for about twenty days in the ocean.

====Korean War====
During the Korean War, Yokota was used for combat missions over North and South Korea. Known units based there were:

*Fighter units
**27th Fighter-Escort Wing (November – December 1950)Flew F-84E Thunderjets on armed reconnaissance, interdiction, fighter escort, and close air support missions.
**35th Fighter-Interceptor Wing (April - August 1950)Flew F-80Cs on air defense missions.
***339th Fighter Squadron (April – August 1950)Attached to 35th Fighter-Interceptor Wing and flew F-82F/G Twin Mustang missions over South Korea during the first few months of hostilities.
*Bombardment units
**92d Bombardment Group (325th, 326th and 327th Bombardment Squadrons) (July – October 1950)Deployed squadrons from Spokane Army Airfield, Washington. Flew B-29 Bombing missions over North Korea.
**98th Bombardment Wing (343d, 344th and 345th Bomb Squadrons) (August 1950 – July 1954)Group, then Wing deployed from Spokane Army Airfield. Flew B-29 Bombing missions over North Korea. Two days after arriving at Yokota, the squadrons conducted a bomb mission against marshalling yards at Pyongyang, North Korea. The 98th BG engaged primarily in interdiction of enemy communications centers but also supported UN ground forces. Interdiction targets included marshalling yards, oil centers, rail facilities, bridges, roads, troop concentrations, airfields, and military installations.
*Reconnaissance units
**31st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron Photographic (July–August 1950)Flew combat missions to provide FEAF (Far East Air Forces) Bomber Command with target and bomb-damage assessment photography.
**91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, Medium, Photographic (December 1950 – December 1954)Assigned to 407th Strategic Fighter Wing (1953–54)Absorbed the personnel and resources of the 31st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron in Japan. Using RB-29, RB-45, RB-50 and RB-36 aircraft, it performed target and bomb-damage assessment photo and visual reconnaissance for FEAF Bomber Command, flew other special photographic missions, and conducted electronic &quot;ferret&quot; reconnaissance to determine frequency, location, and other characteristics of enemy ground radar. The squadron also performed shipping surveillance over the Sea of Japan near the Siberian coast and leaflet drops over North Korea. Beginning in late 1952, rotating aircrews of the Philippine-based 581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing augmented the 91st SRS in flying leaflet missions.
**512th Bombardment Squadron (January – August 1950)Operated the B/RB/WB-29 aircraft and flew weather reconnaissance missions.
**56th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron (September 1951 – July 1972)Replaced the 512th Bomb Squadron in their weather reconnaissance mission. They operated WB-29, WB-50, WC-135B and RB-57 aircraft used to sample airborne nuclear debris as well as weather patterns in the Pacific.

===Cold War===
With the Korean War reaching an armistice in July 1953, Yokota Air Base returned to a peacetime Cold War status. Two major wings were stationed at the base during the 1950s, the 67th Reconnaissance Wing (1956–60) flying RF-80s, RF-84s and lastly RF-101s. The 35th Fighter-Interceptor Wing (1954–57) flew F-86 Sabres from the base. A Tactical Air Command (TAC) air refueling unit, the 421st Air Refueling Squadron flew KB-29s, and later KB-50Js from Yokota from 1953 to 1965. All of these units were under the command of the 41st Air Division.

The 35th TFW was reassigned in 1957 and the 67th TRW in 1960. Defense budget restrictions in the late 1950s caused several PACAF wings based in Japan to be reassigned or inactivated. These tactical fighter units were replaced by the B-57 equipped 3rd Bombardment Wing where it trained in bombardment, reconnaissance and aerial refueling operations. The Air Defense Command 40th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (December 1961 – May 1962) equipped with the F-102 Delta Dagger performing an air defense mission.

The 6102d Air Base Wing assumed host unit status for the base, being replaced by the 441st Combat Support Group in 1964.
The Vietnam War resulted in an increased combat and airlift aircraft presence at the base. Yokota was used for ferrying B-52 Stratofortresses to Southeast Asia along with being a base for US-based deployed F-105 Thunderchief 35th, 36th and 80th Tactical Fighter Squadrons. The 610th Military Airlift Support Squadron (1966–78) was created by Military Airlift Command (MAC) to service the large increase in transiting airlift. The 65th Military Airlift Support Group (1969–71) was a headquarters organization for MAC airlift support squadrons in the Pacific and Far East.

The F-105 squadrons deployed frequently to USAF-operated bases in Thailand to fly combat missions over North and South Vietnam, and to South Korea for alert missions. Initially the fighter squadrons were under the command of the 41st Air Division, but was reassigned shortly after to the 6441st Tactical Fighter Wing, activated in April 1965 to control the F-105 squadrons after their parent organization, the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing, relocated to George Air Force Base, California to become an F-4 Phantom II unit. With the reassignment of the 347th Fighter Wing to Yokota in 1968, the 347th assumed responsibility for all tactical fighters until its reassignment to Kunsan Air Base, South Korea in March 1971.

In 1971, all combat squadrons were transferred to Kadena and Misawa Air Base and Yokota became a non-flying station hosted by the 475th Air Base Wing. The 475th had no numbered flying squadrons, but operated a few T-39 Saberliners and UH-1 helicopters, along with supporting transient MAC cargo and passenger aircraft. Assigned flying squadrons returned to Yokota in 1975 when the 345th Tactical Airlift Squadron was assigned with its C-130Es.

Headquarters, Fifth Air Force was transferred to Yokota on 11 November 1974 from Fuchū Air Base, Japan.

===Post-Cold War===
In 2005, the Japanese government announced that the headquarters of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force Air Defense Command would be moved to Yokota.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has advocated opening Yokota to civilian flights as a method of relieving traffic at Haneda and Narita Airport. Governor Shintaro Ishihara raised the joint-use proposal during the 2003 gubernatorial election, and Governor Naoki Inose made comments in 2013 that suggested joint use as a possible solution to cope with visitor demand during the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. A broad agreement on civil-military use of the base was agreed on in 2005.

In November 2009, the base was attacked by Kakurōkyō members using improvised mortar barrages.
In April 2010 Colonel Frank Eppich, the USAF commander of base, banned screenings of the film &quot;The Cove&quot; at the base theater. A base spokesman said that &quot;The Cove&quot; was banned because using a base venue to display the film could be seen as an endorsement of the film. The spokesman added, &quot;We have a lot of issues with Japan... and anything done on an American base would be seen as an approval of that event.&quot;

Personnel and aircraft from the base assisted with Operation Tomodachi following and during the March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and Fukushima I nuclear accidents. The base also served as an important hub for airlifted assistance during the disaster recovery efforts. During the crisis, around 600 American family members voluntarily departed the base for locations outside Japan.
On 21 March 2012 JASDF units completed moving from Fuchū Air Base (Tokyo). On 26 March, JASDF Yokota Air Base started operations.

In 2013, the air base was again attacked by Kakurokyo members by improvised mortar barrages.

On 5 April 2018 five CV-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft deployed to the base. They had originally been scheduled to deploy to Yokota in 2020, but the deployment was brought forward. As the first permanent deployment of the aircraft outside of Okinawa, the move sparked local protests. The number of aircraft will eventually reach 10.

RQ-4B Global Hawks of Detachment 1, 319th Operations Group deploy to Yokota from Andersen AFB in Guam during the typhoon season, normally between June and December.

====AMC passenger terminal====
The newly renovated Air Mobility Command (AMC) Passenger Terminal is on the main part of the base next to the flightline. It is a 5 to 7-minute walk from the Kanto Lodge (see below) and offers Space-Available flights to various destinations in PACAF such as Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, Korea, Okinawa, Singapore, as well as the Continental United States.

== Based units ==
Flying and notable non-flying units based at Yokota Air Base.

Units marked GSU are Geographically Separate Units, which although based at Yokota, are subordinate to a parent unit based at another location.

==Lawsuits==
Resistance to the air base immediately followed the end of US occupation. Gravel used in the construction of the airfields was taken from the Tama River, lowering the riverbed and affecting the traditional irrigation system (Fuchū-yōsui), which had provided water to local communities since the early Edo period. The base also caused great stress to nearby inhabitants in a number of other ways, such as fuel leaks and spills that contaminated groundwater and well water, foul odors and fires, deafening noise pollution, and repeated plane crashes. Although local leaders succeeded in bringing about the return of land that had been taken for the base in Tachikawa, at Yokota, the number of departures and landings per year reached 20,000. Pilot training that simulated landing jets on aircraft carriers was also held several times each year, often throughout the night. Because such training, together with the engine testing and daily flights, created a level of noise pollution that local inhabitants found unbearable, numerous lawsuits were filed against the Japanese and U.S. governments, calling for a halt in flights and compensation for damages caused by the noise pollution. At present, a small fraction of the compensation demanded for past damages appears likely to be awarded. &quot;Yokota Airbase Pollution Lawsuit No. 9&quot;, filed on 12 December 2012 and &quot;New Yokota Airbase Pollution Lawsuit No. 2&quot;, filed on 26 March 2013, are currently being disputed.

==Base amenities==
===The 374th Force Support Squadron===
The 374th Force Support Squadron is responsible for providing an enhanced quality of life, facilities and programs for 11,000 military, civilian and dependents as well as 150,000 transient personnel per year. The 374th Force Support Squadron provides manpower and personnel support, membership clubs, child development, youth programs, food service, lodging, sports/fitness, recreation/leisure activities, comprehensive readiness program, marketing/publicity, linen exchange, and mortuary operations for Yokota AB.

===Friendship Festival===

Each year in May, Yokota Air Base opens the gates to the Japanese community for its annual Friendship Festival. For two days, local residents can learn about Yokota Air Base. Food and events are provided for all ages. Roughly 200,000 visitors show up each year, although non-Japanese visitors may be turned away from the gates for security reasons.

For those two days, visitors are able to examine many types of aircraft and tour some of the large cargo planes from inside. Each year, service member volunteers base-wide form &quot;D Squadron&quot; for the event, offering some visitors an enhanced on-base experience.

In 2020 and 2021, it was canceled due to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. 2022 was held on May 21 and May 22, three months earlier than usual. On the May 22, the 46th President of the United States, Joe Biden, visited Japan with the arrival of related equipment, including the dedicated Air Force One, but the Friendship Festival was held as scheduled.

===Education===

The Department of Defense Education Activity operates schools at Yokota for children of personnel assigned to the base.

* Joan K. Mendel Elementary School (formerly known as Yokota East Elementary School)
* Yokota West Elementary School
* Yokota Middle School: School Dedication Ceremony took place on 13 June 2000. YMS initial year began with only grades 7 and 8, with the upstairs specialty wing housing High School classes until construction modifications to YHS were completed. Class officially began August 2000.
* Yokota High School: The Home of the Yokota Panthers. The school was constructed in 1973. A new &quot;21st century&quot; school started construction in 2015 and finished in 2017. The new school replaced the old Yokota High School.

Higher educational opportunities for those in the military and working for the Department of Defense, as well as for family members at Yokota are available through several contracted academic institutions. For example:
* The Asian Division of University of Maryland Global Campus (UMGC) (known as the University of Maryland University College until July 1, 2019)

===Tama Hills Recreation Area===
The Tama Hills Recreation Area comprises about one-half of the 500-acre Tama Services Division Annex, the other half being the Tama Hills Golf Course.

==In popular culture==
The base was the setting of &quot;Almost Transparent Blue&quot;, a best-selling novel written by Ryu Murakami and published in 1976, as well as the anime &quot;Blood the Last Vampire&quot; and the short film &quot;Baby Blue&quot; from Genius Party, directed by Shinichiro Watanabe. Yokota Air Base and its surrounding area were the central location for the 2006 movie &quot;Sugar and Spice&quot; and mentioned briefly in &quot;Patlabor 2: The Movie&quot;. It is also the setting of parts of &quot;The Yokota Officers Club : A Novel&quot; by Sarah Bird. The base is also the birthplace of US Marine Captain, former UFC fighter and Fox Sports analyst Brian Stann. The base was also briefly featured in the 2016 biopic &quot;Snowden&quot; as one of Edward Snowden&#x27;s workplaces.

<text>Margaret Ellen &quot;Peggy&quot; Noonan (born September 7, 1950) is a weekly columnist for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and contributor to NBC News and ABC News. She was a primary speechwriter and Special Assistant to President Ronald Reagan from 1984 to 1986 and has been right-leaning in her writings since leaving the Reagan administration. Five of Noonan&#x27;s books have been &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers. Noonan was nominated for an Emmy Award for her work on &quot;&quot;.

==Early life and early career==
Noonan was born on September 7, 1950, in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of a merchant seaman. She is of Irish descent. Noonan is a graduate of Rutherford High School in Rutherford, New Jersey, and Fairleigh Dickinson University. Noonan worked as the daily CBS Radio commentary writer for anchorman Dan Rather at CBS News, whom she once called &quot;the best boss I ever had&quot;. From 1975 through 1977, she worked the overnight shift as a newswriter at WEEI Radio in Boston, where she was later Editorial and Public Affairs Director. In 1978 and 1979, she was an adjunct professor of journalism at New York University.

==Speechwriting==

In 1984, Noonan, as a speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan, authored his &quot;The boys of Pointe du Hoc&quot; speech on the 40th anniversary of D-Day. She also wrote Reagan&#x27;s address to the nation after the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, drawing upon the poet John Magee&#x27;s words about aviators who &quot;slipped the surly bonds of earth ... and touched the face of God.&quot; The latter is ranked as the eighth best American political speech of the 20th century, according to a list compiled by professors at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and Texas A&amp;M University. Her &quot;The boys of Pointe du Hoc&quot; speech ranks as the 58th best speech of the century, according to the website American Rhetoric.

Noonan worked on a tribute Reagan gave to honor President John F. Kennedy at a fundraising event held at the McLean, Virginia, home of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, in the spring of 1984. Later, while working for then Vice President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s 1988 presidential campaign, Noonan coined the phrase &quot;a kinder, gentler nation&quot;, and also popularized &quot;a thousand points of light&quot;, two memorable catchphrases used by Bush. Noonan also wrote Bush&#x27;s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in New Orleans, in which he pledged &quot;Read my lips: no new taxes&quot;. Bush&#x27;s subsequent reversal of this pledge is often cited as a major reason for his defeat in his 1992 re-election campaign. In 1995, Noonan received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Edmund Morris.

==Later career==

Noonan worked as a consultant on the American television drama &quot;The West Wing&quot;. In 2003, Noonan was a supporter of the US invasion of Iraq. In mid-August 2004, she took a brief unpaid leave from &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; to campaign for George W. Bush&#x27;s reelection. In 2007, Noonan was one of the founding members of the now-shuttered wowOwow.com, along with Liz Smith, Lesley Stahl, Mary Wells Lawrence, and Joni Evans.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, Noonan wrote about Sarah Palin&#x27;s vice presidential candidacy in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. In one opinion piece, Noonan expressed her view that Palin did not demonstrate &quot;the tools, the equipment, the knowledge or the philosophical grounding one hopes for, and expects, in a holder of high office&quot;, concluding that Palin&#x27;s candidacy marked a &quot;vulgarization in American Politics&quot; that is &quot;no good ... for conservatism ... [or] the country&quot;. Tony Blankley sharply criticized Noonan for her criticism of Palin. 

Noonan&#x27;s weekly column for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, entitled &quot;Declarations&quot;, has been running since 2000. She is also a regular commentator on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press. &quot;In 2017, Noonan won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for &quot;rising to the moment with beautifully rendered columns that connected readers to the shared virtues of Americans during one of the nation&#x27;s most divisive political campaigns.&quot;

==Personal life==

In November 1985, at age 35, Noonan married 43 year old Richard W. Rahn, who was then chief economist at the US Chamber of Commerce. It was his third marriage, her first. Their son Will was born in 1987. Noonan and her husband were divorced after five years of marriage. In 1989, a few months after separating from Rahn, she returned with her son to her native New York. In 2004, according to an interview with &quot;Crisis Magazine&quot;, she lived in a brownstone in Brooklyn Heights with her son, who attended the nearby Saint Ann&#x27;s School.

Noonan lives in Manhattan. She is a practicing Catholic and attends St. Thomas More Church on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side. Since the late 2010s, Noonan has distanced herself from the Republican Party under Donald Trump. Both in 2016 and 2020, she declined to vote for either Trump or his Democratic opponent. In 2020, she wrote in 18th-century political philosopher Edmund Burke.

==Reception==
While Noonan&#x27;s speechwriting has been praised, her books and &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; columns have been the source of criticism and mockery. Critics have singled out her reliance on personal anecdotes to make broad assertions about current events and changes in American politics and society. During Hurricane Katrina, Noonan called for looters in New Orleans to be shot. Henry Giroux called it a &quot;barely coded rationale to shoot low-income Black people.&quot;

In a March 2013 column, she used her experience staying at a short-staffed airport hotel to demonstrate the Obama administration&#x27;s lack of focus on job creation and infrastructure spending, even though infrastructure was a significant component of Obama&#x27;s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which Noonan had previously criticized in November 2010. 
In August 2019, Noonan was mocked for writing a column on Donald Trump&#x27;s support among Hispanic Americans which centered on a conversation she had with a Dominican friend who worked at the deli counter at her grocery store.

Recurring themes in Noonan&#x27;s books and columns include the decline of civility, social graces, religiosity, patriotism, bipartisanship and statesmanship in contemporary American politics and society, as well as enduring praise for past conservative political figures such as Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. As a result, her writing is criticized for being overly nostalgic. In June 2019, after Noonan called on congressional Democrats to censure President Trump in the wake of the Mueller report, he attacked her on Twitter, calling her &quot;simplistic&quot; and claiming that she &quot;is stuck in the past glory of Reagan&quot;. In June 2022, Trump issued a statement calling Noonan a &quot;weak and frail RINO... who did much less for Ronald Reagan than she claims, and who actually said bad things about him and his ability to speak&quot; after she wrote in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; that the Republican Party was &quot;rejecting&quot; Trump in the aftermath of the 2021 United States Capitol attack.

<text>Michelle Meyrink (born September 1, 1962) is a Canadian teacher and former actress.

==Early life==
Meyrink was born on September 1, 1962, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and began acting at an early age.

==Acting career==
She performed roles during the 1980s in both television and in feature films, mostly playing roles as offbeat teen girls. She appeared in many comedy films, including 1983&#x27;s &quot;Valley Girl&quot; as Suzi Brent and &quot;The Outsiders&quot; as Cherry Valance&#x27;s best friend, Marcia. In 1984, she guest-starred on the television show &quot;Family Ties&quot; as Mallory&#x27;s friend (and neighbor Skippy&#x27;s latest infatuation).

She is best remembered as the female nerd Judy in the 1984 comedy &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; and as the hyperactive whiz-kid Jordan Cochran in Martha Coolidge&#x27;s 1985 film &quot;Real Genius&quot;. Her last Hollywood role was in the 1988 film &quot;Permanent Record.&quot;

==Post-acting==
Meyrink gave up acting as a career in 1989, stating she wanted more out of life than the profession was offering. During this transition period she became interested in the practice of Zen Buddhism. She moved for a time to the Dominican Republic to be near family members living there. Meyrink later returned to her hometown of Vancouver, where in 1996 she met her future husband John Dumbrille at the Zen Centre of Vancouver. Following their wedding, she and John began raising a family of three children.

Meyrink and Dumbrille currently live in Vancouver. Her family was the subject of a 2004 episode of the Canadian television series &quot;Quiet Mind&quot;, which focused on their embrace and practice of Zen Buddhism.

In 2013 Meyrink started her own acting school named Actorium in Vancouver. It is modeled, in part, after the Loft Studio, which she attended with other Hollywood actors while she worked in Los Angeles.

<doc id="492407" wikidata="Q661854" url="?curid=492407" title="Kuruş">
<text>Kuruş ( ; ), also gurush, ersh, gersh, grush, grosha, and grosi, are all names for currency denominations in and around the territories formerly part of the Ottoman Empire. The variation in the name stems from the different languages it is used in (Arabic, Amharic, Turkish and Greek) and the different transcriptions into the Latin alphabet. In European languages, the kuruş was known as the [[piastre]].

Today the kuruş (.&quot;&quot;) is a Turkish currency subunit, with one Turkish lira equal to 100 kuruş as of the 2005 revaluation of the lira. Until the 1844 subdivision of the former Ottoman gold lira, the kuruş was the standard unit of currency within the Ottoman Empire, and was subdivided into 40 &quot;para&quot; or 120 &quot;akçe&quot;.

==Name==
The Turkish word &quot;kuruş&quot; (, &quot;kurûş&quot;); , ; plural , ) is derived from the French &quot;gros&quot; (&quot;heavy&quot;), which itself is derived from the Latin &quot;grossus&quot; (&quot;thick&quot;). It is cognate with the German &quot;Groschen&quot; and Hungarian &quot;garas&quot;.

== History ==
The Ottoman &quot;kuruş&quot; was introduced in 1688. It was initially a large silver piece (similar to the European thalers issued by the Ottomans), approximately equal to the French écu, or, from other sources, to the Spanish dollar. It was worth 40 &quot;para&quot;. In 1844, following sustained debasement, the gold &quot;lira&quot; was introduced, worth 100 kuruş. During the late 18th to early 19th centuries it was further reduced to a billon coin weighing less than 3 grams.

As the Ottoman Empire broke up, several successor states retained the kuruş as a denomination. These included Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Lebanon and Turkey itself. Others, including Jordan and Sudan, adopted the kuruş as a denomination when they established their own currencies.

At the beginning of the 19th century, silver coins were in circulation for 1 akçe, 1, 5, 10 and 20 para, 1, 2 and kuruş, together with gold coins denominated in &quot;zeri mahbub&quot; (3,5 kurush) and &quot;altin&quot;. As the silver coins were debased, other denominations appeared: 30 para, , 3, 5 and 6 kuruş. The final coinage issued before the currency reform consisted of billon 1, 10 and 20 para, and silver , 3 and 6 kuruş.

In 1844, the Turkish gold lira was introduced as the new standard denomination. It was divided into 100 silver kuruş and the kuruş continued to circulate until the 1970s.

Kuruş eventually became obsolete due to the chronic inflation in Turkey in the late 1970s. A currency reform on 1 January 2005 provided its return as of the new lira.

<doc id="492413" wikidata="Q14961002" url="?curid=492413" title="Revaluation of the Turkish lira">
<text>The new Turkish lira () was the currency of Turkey and the de facto independent state of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2008 which was a transition period for the removal of six zeroes from the currency. The new lira was subdivided into 100 &quot;new kuruş&quot; (&quot;yeni kuruş&quot;). The symbol was &quot;YTL&quot; and the ISO 4217 code was &quot;TRY&quot;.

==History==
Because of the chronic inflation experienced in Turkey from the 1970s through to the 1990s, the old lira experienced severe depreciation. Turkey has consistently had high inflation rates compared to developed countries: from an average of 9 lira per U.S. dollar in the late 1960s, the currency came to trade at approximately 1,650,000 lira per U.S. dollar in late 2001. This represented an average inflation of about 38% per year. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had called this problem a &quot;national shame&quot;. With the revaluation of the Turkish old lira, the Romanian leu (also revalued in July 2005) briefly became the world&#x27;s least valued currency unit.

In late December 2003, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey passed a law that allowed for the removal of six zeroes from the currency, and the creation of the new lira. It was introduced on 1 January 2005, replacing the previous lira (which remained valid in circulation until the end of 2005) at a rate of 1 new lira = 1,000,000 old lira.

Following its introduction, the official name of the currency was the &quot;New Turkish Lira&quot;, but according to the Central Bank, the word &quot;new&quot; (&quot;yeni&quot;) was only a &quot;temporary&quot; measure. A news agency reported that &quot;new&quot; would be removed on January 1, 2009. The same source also indicated that the banknotes would have &quot;different shapes and sizes to prevent forgery&quot;. The issuance of a new highest denomination, 200 lira, was contemplated at the same time.

==Coins==
Coins were introduced in 2005 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 new (Yeni) kuruş and 1 new (Yeni) lira. The 1 new (Yeni) kuruş was minted in brass and the 5, 10 and 25 new kuruş in cupro-nickel, whilst the 50 new kuruş and 1 new lira are bimetallic. All coins show portraits of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.

To the dismay of the European Central Bank, the sizes and compositions of the 50 new kuruş and 1 new lira coins clearly resemble those of the €1 and €2 coins respectively. (See comparison photo in of YTL 1 coin and €2 coin.) This could cause confusion in the eurozone. It also caused trouble to businesses using vending machines (particularly at airports) in the eurozone since a number of vending machines at the time accepted the 1 new lira coin as a €2 coin. Since €2 is worth roughly four times more, vending machines affected had to be upgraded at the expense of their owners.

==Banknotes==
Banknotes, referred to by the Central Bank as the &quot;E-8 Emission Group&quot;, were introduced in 2005 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 new lira. Whilst the lower four denominations replaced older notes and used very similar designs, the 50 and 100 new lira notes did not have equivalents in the old currency. All notes show portraits of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk from different points of his life and images of various historical and otherwise important buildings and places in Turkey. A new series of banknotes, the &quot;E-9 Emission Group&quot;, entered circulation on 1 January 2009, with the E-8 group ceasing to be valid after 31 December 2009 (although still redeemable at branches of the Central Bank until 31 December 2019). The E-9 banknotes refer to the currency as &quot;lira&quot; rather than &quot;new lira&quot;, and include a 200 lira denomination.

<doc id="492415" wikidata="Q1619595" url="?curid=492415" title="Valley of the Dolls (novel)">
<text>Valley of the Dolls is the first novel by American writer Jacqueline Susann. Published in 1966, the book was the biggest-selling novel of its year. By 2016 it had sold more than 31 million copies, making it one of the all-time best-selling fictional works in publishing history.

==Plot==
In 1945 beautiful ingenue Anne Welles moves to New York City to escape the ennui of her Massachusetts hometown. She finds work as a secretary to Henry Bellamy, an entertainment lawyer, and befriends Neely O&#x27;Hara, an ebullient vaudevillian and aspiring stage actress. Henry&#x27;s employee, Lyon Burke, returns to the agency after World War II, and Anne quickly falls in love with him despite Henry&#x27;s warning. Meanwhile Anne goes on some dates with a small-time salesman named Allen Cooper. Allen suddenly reveals that he is a millionaire pretending to be a normal person in order to make sure Anne&#x27;s feelings are genuine. He proposes to Anne and their love story becomes a media sensation.

Anne befriends Helen Lawson, a brilliant, ruthless, unhappy Broadway legend. Neely is hired for Helen&#x27;s latest show but Helen takes a dislike to her and minimizes her role. Anne uses her friendship with Lyon to secure Neely a bigger role, and Neely becomes a breakout star; Helen cruelly rejects Anne by revealing she was only interested in Anne&#x27;s friendship for the chance at a sexual relationship with Allen&#x27;s father. Anne also befriends Jennifer North, a kindhearted young actress famous for her attractive figure.

On the night of the show&#x27;s opening, Anne and Lyon consummate their feelings, and Anne and Allen break up. The production is a massive success. Neely enjoys a meteoric rise to fame and moves to California to begin a film career. Anne&#x27;s mother dies and she returns to her hometown with Lyon, who wants to quit the agency, live in Anne&#x27;s family home, and write novels. Though Anne loves Lyon deeply, she refuses to move back to Massachusetts. Lyon breaks up with Anne and moves to England to write, leaving Anne heartbroken. Though Anne takes years to move on, she eventually becomes a model for beauty products and starts dating the cosmetics company owner, the older, wealthy Kevin Gillmore.

Meanwhile Jennifer begins a relationship with the childish, sex-obsessed singer Tony Polar, but their romance is frequently interrupted by his domineering older sister, Miriam. Jennifer pressures Tony into marrying her and quickly falls pregnant. After reuniting with an increasingly unsympathetic Neely, who is in the midst of an affair, Jennifer becomes dependent on &#x27;dolls&#x27;, amphetamines and barbiturates, to calm her frayed nerves. Finally Miriam reveals why she opposed Jennifer and Tony&#x27;s relationship: Tony has developmental disabilities and the baby will likely inherit them. Devastated, Jennifer has an abortion and agrees to divorce Tony. Jennifer then moves to Europe and finds work in art house films, which, owing to her nudity, are considered softcore pornography in the United States.

By 1950 Neely has become a celebrated actress enjoying a lucrative film career and twin sons with her second husband. However long workdays and the stress over her husband&#x27;s infidelity (with both men and women) keep her dependent on &#x27;dolls&#x27; and she is becoming increasingly unpopular with the studio because of her tantrums and walkouts. Neely accidentally overdoses on pills but makes a full recovery. Still, the studio fires her from the production and replaces her with the boss&#x27;s young lover. Anne reconnects with Neely; Kevin suggests resurrecting Neely&#x27;s career by having her sing on a televised spectacular for his brand. Neely at first refuses but following a successful supper-club performance and a run-in with a belligerent Helen she agrees. Unable to cope with the demands of the rehearsals, she overdoses to avoid performing. To Anne&#x27;s distress Neely disappears to Europe.

Jennifer, in Europe, is pressured to undergo plastic surgery; as she has always lied about her true age she is now ten years older than her claimed age of 27. Unhappy with her European career and boyfriend, she returns to the United States. Three years later she becomes engaged to an older senator, who she believes loves her for more than her body, and she is excited to get married and have a child. But a routine test reveals that she has breast cancer and will require a mastectomy and the treatment will likely render her infertile. After her fiancé says he doesn&#x27;t want children and makes a comment suggesting he&#x27;s only interested in her body Jennifer becomes convinced that she will never be loved for who she is. She leaves the hospital and commits suicide.

Neely reappears in the midst of Jennifer&#x27;s funeral. She has lost her voice, apparently from psychological issues. After bungling a self-harm attempt Neely becomes institutionalized, which a guilty Anne pays for. Meanwhile Lyon returns to New York and reconnects with Anne, much to the chagrin of Kevin. Anne is unable to overcome her passion for Lyon and the two begin an affair. Kevin eventually learns of this and breaks up with Anne. Some time later Neely finds her voice again after an impromptu sanitarium performance with a now-incompetent Tony Polar. Anne works with Henry to get Lyon to abandon his non-starter career as a writer and become a partner at the agency, with Henry lending Lyon money that secretly comes from Anne.

Lyon is initially put off by Neely, who has become obese, but successfully plots her career comeback. Anne and Lyon get married and Anne quickly becomes pregnant, but her happiness is short-lived when Neely demands that Lyon escort her everywhere on her comeback tour. Lyon learns from Neely about how Anne secretly lent him money and feels outraged and emasculated. He and Neely begin a brazen public affair. Henry persuades Anne to wait out the humiliation and pretend she knows nothing, assuring her that Lyon will grow tired of Neely and return to her. The affair stretches out for years, with Neely pressuring Lyon to end his marriage. Anne becomes dependent on the &#x27;dolls&#x27; to relax, but Lyon reluctantly stays with Anne. After repaying Anne&#x27;s loan he breaks off the affair (losing Neely as a client in the process) but quickly begins a new one with a teenaged up-and-coming singer. Though Anne finally admits to herself that Lyon will never stop having affairs, she assures herself that she will eventually fall out of love and become numb to all of her pain before reaching for her &#x27;dolls&#x27; again.

== Background ==
Susann had apparently been thinking about the novel for some time. Some years earlier, she had begun &quot;Underneath the Pancake&quot;, a show-business novel, with her actress friend Beatrice Cole (c. 1910–1999). Later, she considered writing a novel about drug usage in show business to be called &quot;The Pink Dolls&quot;.

&quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; is considered a &quot;roman à clef&quot;, with its characters based on famous figures such as Judy Garland, Carole Landis, Dean Martin, and Ethel Merman. In 1973, after the publication of her third novel, Susann said: &quot;They can keep calling it that &quot;roman à clef&quot;. It&#x27;ll only make my books sell. I don&#x27;t care&quot;. Susann insisted that she began each book with a theme: &quot;Then I start asking, what kind of a personality? And because I have a good ear, I unconsciously pick up certain people&quot;.

Susann dedicated the book to her poodle Josephine, and to her husband Irving Mansfield.

==Reception==
The book was published by Bernard Geis Associates on February 10, 1966, and &quot;took off like a Cape Canaveral space shot&quot;.

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, in an advance review, called the novel &quot;big, brilliant and sensational&quot;, if &quot;poorly written&quot;. The book received largely negative reviews. Feminist Gloria Steinem criticized the book in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, as did &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine called it the &quot;Dirty Book of the Month&quot;, and said: &quot;It might more accurately be described as a highly effective sedative, a living doll&quot;.

Despite the poor reviews, the book was a runaway commercial success. On May 8, 1966, in its ninth week on the list, the book reached #1 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller List, where it remained for 28 consecutive weeks. With a total of 65 weeks on the list, the book became the best-selling novel of 1966. By the time of Susann&#x27;s death in 1974, it had entered the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the best-selling novel in publishing history, with more than 17 million copies sold. By 2016, the book had sold more than 31 million copies.

== In popular culture ==
In Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, when Billy Pilgrim is brought to Tralfamadore for the first time and asks for reading material, he is given &quot;The Valley of The Dolls,&quot; which is the only physical copy of an English-speaking book the Tralfamadorians have aboard their spaceship.

In a 1969 episode of &quot;That Girl&quot; (Season 4, Episode 11; &quot;Kiss That Girl Goodbye&quot;), the two main characters, Ann Marie and Donald Hollinger, play charades. Donald correctly guesses &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; after Ann has only given him the clues of it being four-words and a book title.

In &quot;Black Mirror&quot; (Season 6, Episode 3;, &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;), the character of Lana is seen reading the book.

In the Stephen King novel &quot;Billy Summers&quot;, the character Alice Maxwell makes reference to the book.

In &quot;State of Grace&quot; (Season 2, Episode 12), the main characters, Hannah and Grace, are at a bookstore looking at the book&#x27;s cover and pondering what it&#x27;s about. Just as they&#x27;re starting to take a peek inside the book to find out, Grace&#x27;s mother Tattie snatches the book away and scolds them, saying the book is a &quot;trashy&quot; one for adults and &quot;not for children!&quot;

In &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; season 3 episode 5, Eric&#x27;s bunk-mate criticizes the book&#x27;s ending.

In 2012, Marina and The Diamonds released her &quot;Electra Heart&quot; album, the tenth track on the album is named &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, one of the lyrics is as follows; &quot;in the valley of the dolls, we sleep, got a hole inside of me.&quot;

In the 2023 tactical first-person shooter game &quot;Ready or Not&quot;, one of the levels involving a child sexual abuse sting bears the name of the novel.

== Adaptations and character portrayals ==
In 1967, the book was adapted into a film of the same name, directed by Mark Robson (&quot;Peyton Place&quot;), and starring Barbara Parkins as Anne, Patty Duke as Neely, Paul Burke (Lyon), Sharon Tate (Jennifer), and Susan Hayward (Helen). The screenplay was written by Helen Deutsch (&quot;National Velvet&quot;) and Dorothy Kingsley (&quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;), and produced by Robson and David Weisbart. Like the book, although the reviews were scathing, the film was an enormous box-office hit, becoming the sixth most popular of the year with $44 million at the domestic box office. Susann, who had a cameo in the film as a news reporter, hated the film. The film became a celebrated cult classic in later years, often cited as a key example of camp in cinema.

Because of the success of the film adaptation, a sequel was rushed into development by Fox in early 1968. Susann provided a title for the film, &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot;, and a treatment that involved Anne Welles moving into television journalism while attempting to raise her teenage daughter, Julie, as a single mother following another rocky love affair with Lyon Burke. After a year&#x27;s work by two screenwriters did not result in a script Fox executives wanted to produce, Susann and her husband, Irving Mansfield, who was attached as producer, were removed from the project. &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot; was instead made and released in 1970 as an unofficial sequel/musical-comedy parody of the first film. Sexploitation filmmaker Russ Meyer produced and directed &quot;Beyond&quot; from a screenplay by his friend, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert. While a modest box-office hit and later a cult classic, the X-rated film resulted in an ultimately successful lawsuit from Susann and varying levels of embarrassment from future Fox regimes over the film&#x27;s uses of nudity and violence. Because of the legal issues with Susann, the characters of Anne and Lyon were renamed and recast without Parkins and Burke.

The novel was re-adapted by Fox for television in 1981 as &quot;Jacqueline Susann&#x27;s Valley of the Dolls&quot;, a mini-series executive-produced by Susann&#x27;s widower, Irving Mansfield, and directed by Walter Grauman. This version stars Catherine Hicks, Lisa Hartman, and Veronica Hamel. In 1994 a late-night, syndicated television soap opera, &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, ran for one season and 65 episodes. The premise was a loose adaptation of the novel. BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 15-episode dramatisation scripted by Yvonne Antrobus over three weeks in August and September 2005. It was part of the Woman&#x27;s Hour programme&#x27;s ongoing fifteen-minute daily drama slot, and has been rebroadcast several times on BBC Radio 4 Extra in three 70-minute omnibus episodes.

The creation of the novel, film and the never-made film sequel meant to star Parkins and Burke are the subjects of an acclaimed 2020 non-fiction book written by Stephen Rebello, &quot;Dolls! Dolls! Dolls!: Deep Inside Valley of the Dolls, the Most Beloved Bad Book and Movie of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="492421" wikidata="Q3629904" url="?curid=492421" title="Sikander Bakht">
<text>Sikander Bakht (24 August 1918 – 23 February 2004) was an Indian politician belonging to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who served as the 15th governor of Kerala from 2002 until his death. He was elected as the Vice President of the BJP, served as its leader in the Rajya Sabha, and as a cabinet minister in the NDA government headed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee. In 2000, he was awarded Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian honour of the Government of India.

==Early life==
Sikander Bakht was born in Quresh Nagar in Delhi, India in 1918. He attended the Anglo Arabic Senior Secondary School, Delhi and completed his Bachelor of Science from the Anglo-Arabic College (now known as Zakir Husain College) in Delhi. During his school and college days he was a keen hockey player and represented Delhi University and Delhi in various tournaments. He also played and captained the Independents Hockey Club. He once said he is a member of BJP and always maintained that India is a land of secularism and supported the ethos of India.

==Political career==
In 1952, Bakht was elected to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi as a Congress candidate. In 1968 he was elected as the Chairman of Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking. In 1969 the Congress party split and Bakht stayed with Congress (Organisation). Bakht was then elected to The Metropolitan Council of Delhi as a Congress (O) candidate. On 25 June 1975, Emergency was declared by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Bakht along with other opposition leaders was imprisoned on 25 June 1975. He was lodged in the Rohtak Jail until his release in December 1976. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered General Elections in March 1977. As soon as the opposition leaders were released, they merged all opposition parties to form The Janta Party.

In March 1977, Bakht was elected to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Indian Parliament) as a Janata Party candidate, from Chandni Chowk in New Delhi. Morarji Desai was appointed prime minister and he appointed Bakht as a Cabinet Minister for Works, Housing, Supply and Rehabilitation. He served in this capacity till July 1979.

In 1980 the Janta Party split and Bakht opted to be with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He was appointed General Secretary of BJP. In 1984 he was made the Vice President of BJP.

In 1990 Bakht was elected to the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of the Indian Parliament) from Madhya Pradesh. In 1992 he became the Leader of Opposition in the &quot;Rajya Sabha&quot;. (The Leader of Opposition is equivalent to Cabinet Minister&#x27;s post.) On 10 April 1996 he was reelected from Madhya Pradesh to the &quot;Rajya Sabha&quot;.

In May 1996, during the first Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ministry, Bakht served as Minister of External Affairs and Minister of Urban Affairs. After the collapse of the Vajpayee government, Bakht became the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha once again.

In 1998 Vajpayee was again appointed prime minister and Bakht was appointed Industry Minister, a post he held until 2002. In addition, he was appointed the Leader of the House in Rajya Sabha. After serving an entire term as Industries Minister, Bakht retired from active politics and was appointed the Governor of Kerala in 2002. He was the first BJP leader ever to be appointed the governor of Kerala.

==Awards==
In 2000 Bakht was awarded the Padma Vibhushan. This is the second highest Indian civilian award. The four other persons from the BJP who have been awarded the &quot;Padma Vibhushan&quot; are Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Lal Krishna Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley. Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani have since been awarded the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award of India.

==Death==
Bakht finished his term in Rajya Sabha on 9 April 2002. 9 days later, he was sworn in as Governor of Kerala, succeeding Sukhdev Singh Kang. At the age of , he was the oldest Governor of Kerala state. He was highly popular and served in this post until his death. Bakht died in the Medical College Hospital in Kerala&#x27;s capital city Thiruvananthapuram on 23 February 2004, from complications of intestinal surgery which was performed on 19 February. He was the first Governor of Kerala who died in office. He was replaced two days later by Karnataka governor T. N. Chaturvedi. There was concern, particularly among BJP members, that Bakht might have died because of medical negligence, but nothing was proven. Chief Minister A. K. Antony, at the time of Sikander Bakht&#x27;s death, had to give into popular demand to order an inquiry to examine if there was any lapse on part of doctors or any other motive.
The President of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, said &quot;In his death we have lost a prominent public personality and a statesman.&quot; Prime Minister Vajpayee said &quot;Mr. Bakht was a freedom-fighter. He struggled for democracy and the nationalist cause with courage and conviction. He rendered distinguished service as a member of my Cabinet for sometime.&quot;

<text>Triloki Nath Chaturvedi (18 January 1928 — 5 January 2020) spent almost 70 years of his life in the administrative and political system of independent India. He was a member of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), held the constitutional position of Comptroller &amp; Auditor General of India, was an elected member of the Indian Parliament, and was appointed by the President of India to the constitutional office of Governor of Karnataka and Kerala. He was honored with the Padma Vibushan for public service in 1991. He was associated with numerous academic, research, literary and philanthropic institutions as a member and in various leadership capacities.

==Early life and education==

Triloki Nath Chaturvedi was born in the village of Tirwa, in the Kannauj area of Uttar Pradesh on January 18, 1928. His father, Pandit Kamta Nath Chaturvedi, was a lawyer and homeopath. He lost his mother, Vidyavati, when he was less than a year old.

After studying at the local village school and college he joined Christ Church College, Kanpur and subsequently Allahabad University, from where he obtained an MA LLB degree. He stood First Class throughout in MA, and was presented the University Gold Medal for Economics and Political Science. He sat for the Provincial Civil Service (PCS) examination and stood first in the entire nation. He also sat for the new Indian Administrative Service examination and was selected. 

He married Prakashvati Dubey (1933–89) in 1952. They had one daughter and three sons.

==Civil service (1950-84)==

In 1950, Triloki Nath Chaturvedi was inducted into the first batch of the IAS after the commencement of the Constitution of India. He trained at Metcalfe House in Delhi, and received in-service training in Allahabad and Moradabad. 

He was then attached to the Rajasthan cadre of the IAS, and served there in various capacities, such as private secretary to the chief minister of Rajasthan, collector and district magistrate of Ajmer, and secretary in the departments of Industries, Mines, Town Planning, and Tourism. He was also chairman of the Jaipur Development Authority. During his stay in Ajmer, he was responsible for clearing the area around the historic dargah of Moinuddin Chisthi. After the slum and encroachments were cleared, a wide road was built as well as a market nearby.

As a Fellow of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (an arm of the World Bank), he studied in the US in the 1950s. He visited Columbia University, Harvard University, and the University of Chicago. He met scholars and administrators such as Henry Kissinger, George F Kennan, and John Kenneth Galbraith.
TN Chaturvedi was sent on deputation to the Central Government in 1967 by the Government of Rajasthan, after 17 years of service in the state administration. He was appointed Joint Director, National Academy of Administration (later Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration), Mussoorie, and served there from 1967 to 1971. The academy is the training centre for newly-inducted members of all Central Administrative Services such as the Indian Administrative Service, Indian Foreign Service, Indian Police Service etc. Some of his illustrious trainees during this period were Gopal Gandhi, Wajahat Habibullah and Aruna Roy. 

He was posted as chief secretary, Delhi Administration, where he served from 1971 to 1973. He then served as director, India Investment Centre, from 1973 to 1976. 
He was appointed chief commissioner, Chandigarh in 1976, and was there till 1978, during the period of internal emergency. As chief commissioner, he was the administrative head of Chandigarh. During his tenure, among his achievements was the construction of quarters for the employees of Chandigarh Administration, thus fulfilling a long-standing demand. He also gave Nek Chand, an employee of the Chandigarh Administration, the founder of the Rock Garden, the full-time job of expanding and maintaining the garden. 
During this period he was made a member of a three-man committee to review the working of the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla. While the majority report recommended that the Institute be shut down as a waste of public money, TN Chaturvedi put in a minority report, in which he insisted that it was an institute of national importance, and should continue its work. He suggested ways and means by which reforms could improve its effectiveness. The minority report ensured that the Institute was not closed down.
At the end of the emergency period, he was transferred back to Rajasthan in 1978 as chairman, Rajasthan Industrial and Minerals Development Corporation (RMIDC). A few months later, the executive council of the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA) in Delhi requested the Central Government for his services as director of the institute. The institute is a centre for academic research in administration. TN Chaturvedi recruited new staff, and encouraged the implementation of academic programs which served as mid-career refresher courses for administrators. Under his editorship, the Indian Journal of Public Administration became an internationally-recognized journal in its field.

TN Chaturvedi joined the IIPA as a member in 1959. He was elected a member of the Executive Council of IIPA from 1970 to 2002. He was editor of the prestigious &quot;Indian Journal of Public Administration&quot; from 1971 to 1997. He was elected chairman of the standing committee from 1990 to 2002. He was elected vice-president, IIPA, from 1994 to 2004. He was elected chairman, IIPA in 2004 and served till his death in 2020.
He was appointed Union Education Secretary in the Ministry of Education in 1982 for a brief period. The Education Ministry at the time incorporated the subsequent ministries of sports, women and child welfare, culture, and education. At the instance of the prime minister, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, he was appointed as Union Home Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs, and remained in this position until 1984. As home secretary, he dealt with numerous issues of national importance, such as the insurgencies in Kashmir and Punjab, and the students’ movement against infiltrators in Assam.

==Comptroller and Auditor General of India==
He was deemed retired from the IAS upon his appointment as Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG, 1984–90). The CAG is a constitutional position, and the holder is appointed by the president. 

TN Chaturvedi began the process of modernization of the office of the CAG. He made the first changes in the administrative structure of the office since independence, which led to expansion of opportunities for officers of the CAG, and making it more efficient. New concepts, such as scientific audit, concurrent audit, and internal audit were introduced. Efforts were made at the international level to connect with the audit institutions of other countries which culminated in India offering training to audit officers of many countries, and being empanelled as a United Nations auditor.
An effort was also made to make the audit reports more understandable to the layman. The traditionally low-key profile of the CAG was suddenly raised as these reports were brought into the public realm by media. The institution of the CAG, and Chaturvedi personally, came under attack inside and outside Parliament by the government and the Congress Party in 1989 after the release of an audit report of the purchase of the Swedish Bofors gun by the army, which pointed out lapses in the procurement process.

==Political career==

TN Chaturvedi joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1991, at the request of BJP leaders Dr Murli Manohar Joshi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha election from Kannauaj. He was twice elected to the Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh in 1992 and 1998. He was a member of the National Council of the BJP, its highest policy-making body.
An active parliamentarian, he was on the panel of vice-chairmen of the Rajya Sabha. He was chairman of the Committee on Industry and of the Delhi Public Library. He was also a member of the Committees on external affairs, defence, public accounts, money laundering, patents, and on the securities scam. He was a member of Indian Council of Social Science Research, Indian Council of Historical Research, National Book Trust, and Asiatic Society (Kolkata). 
He was also Chancellor of the Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapith. He was vice-chairman, Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML) Society (now renamed Prime Mimisters’ Museum and Library) and the chairman of its Executive Council (2001–04), He was elected as India’s representative on the Executive Board of UNESCO in 2001. 

He was the first pathak prahari (ombudsman) of the Hindi newspaper Navbharat Times in 1990. Prime Minister Chandrasekhar was the chief guest at the inaugural function.

==Governor==

TN Chaturvedi was appointed Governor of Karnataka by President APJ Abdul Kalam in August 2002. In 2004, he was also briefly Governor of Kerala. Chaturvedi was praised for the manner in which he handled the situation when the coalition government in Karnataka of the Congress and the Janata Dal (S) broke down, and the Janata Dal (S) partnered with the BJP. He won the trust and respect of all political parties in the state. The historian Ramchandra Guha described him as one of the best governors that Karnataka had seen.

==Publications==

He published two books, Transfer of Technology, and Comparative Public Administration (in Hindi and English). He edited or co-edited over 30 books. Academically inclined, he wrote articles and gave lectures on subjects as varied as public administration, ethics in public life, accountability, good governance, the Renaissance in India, Sri Sarda Devi, etc. He was an accomplished writer and speaker in both English and Hindi. His editorials in Sahitya Amrit evoked great interest, with readers sending letters praising them, or asking further questions on the issues discussed.

==Awards==

He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan for public service in 1991.
Among his many other awards were the Magsaysay Plaque for Distinguished Contributions to Public Service and Public Audit by EROPA, Manila (1987), and the first DAV Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2017.

==Personal life==

TN Chaturvedi had always been interested in spiritual subjects since childhood. While open to all paths, he was particularly interested in Sai Baba, Sathya Sai Baba, Ramana Maharishi, Sri Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda, and Sri Aurobindo.
A life-long lover of books, and a voracious reader, he amassed an immense collection of 1,20,000 books in Hindi and English. These cover all aspects of world history, and specifically Indian history and religion, spirituality, the Nationalist Movement, Indian Renaissance, public administration, economics, management. He had many rare books, including a first edition of Hind Swaraj by Mahatma Gandhi. After his death, his family donated them to the Prime Ministers’ Museum and Library, where an annual lecture in his memory is also held. The first lecture was delivered by His Holiness the Dalai Lama of Tibet in January, 2023.

He was also a great lover of dogs, having kept eight dogs at his house since 1984. He was a familiar and loved figure to stray dogs in his neighbourhood, and they adopted him, taking him for long walks and ensuring that he remembered to give them biscuits.

<doc id="492429" wikidata="Q1128459" url="?curid=492429" title="Electret">
<text>An electret (formed as a portmanteau of &quot;electr-&quot; from &quot;electricity&quot; and &quot;-et&quot; from &quot;magnet&quot;) is a dielectric material that has a quasi-permanent electrical polarisation. An electret has internal and external electric fields, and is the electrostatic equivalent of a permanent magnet. 

The term electret was coined by Oliver Heaviside for a (typically dielectric) material which has electrical charges of opposite sign at its extremities. Some materials with electret properties were already known to science and had been studied since the early 1700s. One example is the electrophorus, a device consisting of a slab with electret properties and a separate metal plate. The electrophorus was originally invented by Johan Carl Wilcke in Sweden in 1762 and improved by Alessandro Volta in Italy in 1775. The first documented case of production was by Mototarô Eguchi in 1925 who melting a suitable dielectric material such as a polymer or wax that contains polar molecules, and then allowing it to solidify in a powerful electric field. The polar molecules of the dielectric align themselves to the direction of the electric field, producing a dipole electret with a quasi-permanent polarization. Modern electrets are sometimes made by embedding excess charges into a highly insulating dielectric, e.g. using an electron beam, corona discharge, injection from an electron gun, electric breakdown across a gap, or a dielectric barrier.

== Electret types ==
There are two types of electrets:
* Real-charge electrets which contain excess free charges such as electrons or electron holes of one or both polarities which can move around, either
** on the dielectric&#x27;s surfaces (a surface charge)
** within the dielectric&#x27;s volume (a space charge)
** Space charge electrets with internal bipolar charges known as ferroelectrets.
* Oriented-dipole electrets contain oriented (aligned) dipoles. These contain bound charges at their surface, which are not free to move around. These are similar to ferroelectric materials, and are always in materials which have no inversion symmetry so would also display piezoelectricity.
== Similarity to magnets ==
Electrets, like magnets, are dipoles. Another similarity is the fields: they produce an electrostatic field (as opposed to a magnetic field) outside the material. When a magnet and an electret are near one another, a rather unusual phenomenon occurs: while stationary, neither has any effect on one another. However, when an electret is moved with respect to a magnetic pole, a force is felt which acts perpendicular to the magnetic field, pushing the electret along a path 90 degrees to the expected direction of &quot;push&quot; as would be felt with another magnet.

== Similarity to capacitors ==
There is a similarity between an electret and the dielectric layer used in capacitors; the difference is that dielectrics in capacitors have an induced polarisation that is only transient, dependent on the potential applied on the dielectric, while dielectrics with electret properties exhibit quasi-permanent charge storage or polarisation. Some materials also display ferroelectricity (i.e. they react to the external fields with a hysteresis of the polarisation). Ferroelectrics can retain the polarisation permanently because they are in thermodynamic equilibrium, and thus are used in ferroelectric capacitors. Although electrets are only in a metastable state, those fashioned from very low leakage materials can retain excess charge or polarisation for many years. An electret microphone is a type of condenser microphone that eliminates the need for a polarisation voltage from the power supply by using a permanently charged material.

== Materials ==
Electret materials are quite common in nature. Quartz and other forms of silicon dioxide, for example, are naturally occurring electrets. Today, most electrets are made from synthetic polymers, e.g. fluoropolymers, polypropylene, polyethyleneterephthalate (PET), etc. Real-charge electrets contain either positive or negative excess charges or both, while oriented-dipole electrets contain oriented dipoles. The quasi-permanent internal or external electric fields created by electrets can be exploited in various applications.

== Manufacture==
Bulk electrets can be prepared by heating or melting the material, then cooling it in the presence of a strong electric field. The electric field repositions the charge carriers or aligns the dipoles within the material. When the material cools, solidification &quot;freezes&quot; the dipoles in position. Materials used for electrets are usually waxes, polymers or resins. One of the earliest recipes consists of 45% carnauba wax, 45% white rosin, and 10% white beeswax, melted, mixed together, and left to cool in a static electric field of several kilovolts/cm. The thermo-dielectric effect, related to this process, was first described by Brazilian researcher Joaquim Costa Ribeiro.

Electrets can also be manufactured by embedding excess negative charge within a dielectric using a particle accelerator, or by &quot;stranding&quot; charges on, or near, the surface using high voltage corona discharges, a process called &quot;corona charging&quot;. Excess charge within an electret decays exponentially. The decay constant is a function of the material&#x27;s relative dielectric constant and its bulk resistivity. Materials with extremely high resistivity, such as PTFE, may retain excess charge for many hundreds of years. Most commercially produced electrets are based on fluoropolymers (e.g. amorphous Teflon) machined to thin films.

<text>François Lonseny Fall (born 21 April 1949) is a Guinean diplomat and politician. He briefly served as Prime Minister of Guinea from February 23, 2004 to July 15, 2004, under authoritarian President Lansana Conté. Later, under democratically elected president Alpha Condé, he was Secretary-General of the Presidency from December 2010 to October 2012 and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs from October 2012 to January 2016.

==Early life and career==
Fall received a master&#x27;s degree in law from the University of Conakry in 1976 and was Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Law at the same university from 1977 to 1979.

==Career in diplomacy==
In 1979, Fall began a diplomatic career, holding diplomatic posts in Paris, New York City, Lagos, Cairo, and Conakry from 1982 to 1990; he was Director of the Department of Legal and Consular Affairs at the Guinean Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1996 to 2000.

Fall was Guinea&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations from 2000 to 2002. In 2000, he was Vice-President of the Fifty-Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. From 2000 to 2002, he was a member of the United Nations Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. He was then appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs on June 10, 2002. As foreign minister, he was Guinea&#x27;s delegate to the United Nations security council during the debate over the United States military action in Iraq, and he acted as President of the United Nations Security Council in March 2003. He was also a member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Ministerial Committee for Security and Mediation from 2002 to 2004.

Fall was appointed as prime minister on February 23, 2004. After only two months, Fall resigned as prime minister on April 30, saying that President Lansana Conté would not let him attempt to fix the economy. He was not replaced as prime minister until December 2004, and until July 2004 there was some dispute as to whether he had actually left office formally.

In May 2005, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Fall to be his Special Representative for Somalia. In that capacity, Fall also assumed charge of the UN&#x27;s Political Office for Somalia (UNPOS), located in Nairobi, Kenya. From the date of his appointment through mid-2005, Fall&#x27;s principal task was to persuade and assist rival Somali warlords to lay down their weapons, resolve their differences, and restore national government to a country that had not had one since 1992. On 21 February 2017, he was appointed Special Representative for Central Africa and Head of the United Nations Regional Office for Central Africa (UNOCA) by Secretary-General António Guterres, after serving in that capacity as Acting Special Representative since November 2016.
Lonseny Fall was a minor candidate in the first round of the 2010 presidential election. He then supported Alpha Condé in the second round. Condé won in the second round; shortly after he was sworn in as president, he appointed Lonseny Fall as Secretary-General of the Presidency on 23 December 2010. Lonseny Fall served in that post for nearly two years; he was then appointed to the government as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Guineans Abroad on 5 October 2012.

Fall was dismissed from the government in early 2016, but he remained involved in regional diplomacy through other roles. Beginning in January 2016, Fall served as Vice-Chairman of the Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission of the South Sudan Peace Agreement (JMEC), under the leadership of Chairman Festus Mogae. On 14 October 2016, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed him as his Acting Special Representative for Central Africa and Head of the United Nations Regional Office for Central Africa (UNOCA); he took up the post on 1 November.

In January 2022, Francois Lounceny Fall leaves his post as United Nations Special Representative for Central Africa.
