<text>Aswad are a British reggae group, noted for adding strong R&amp;B and soul influences to the reggae sound. They have been performing since the mid-1970s, having released a total of 21 albums. Their UK hit singles include the number one &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Around&quot; (1988) and &quot;Shine&quot; (1994). &quot;Aswad&quot; is Arabic for &quot;black&quot;. They are three-time Grammy Award nominees.

==History==
The members of Aswad are UK descendants of immigrants from the Caribbean. They attended John Kelly/Holland Park School. Aswad was formed in 1975 in Ladbroke Grove area of West London.

The original members of Aswad were guitarist/vocalist Brinsley &quot;Chaka B&quot; Forde, drummer/vocalist Angus &quot;Drummie Zeb&quot; Gaye, lead guitarist/vocalist Donald &quot;Dee&quot; Griffiths, bassist George &quot;Ras&quot; Oban, and keyboardist Courtney &quot;Khaki&quot; Hemmings. Aswad were the backing band of Burning Spear&#x27;s 1977 &quot;Live&quot; album, recorded at the Rainbow Theatre in London. Other contributors included Vin Gordon, and Karl Pitterson.

Initially, the band produced music in the roots reggae vein, with members contributing songs individually and with Forde acting as the band&#x27;s principal songwriter. The band&#x27;s dynamic soon began to change however. Shortly after the release of their self-titled debut album in 1976, Hemmings left and was replaced by Tony &quot;Gad&quot; Robinson (the only time in the band&#x27;s history where a departing member would be officially replaced by an incoming musician). The band then released their second studio effort, &quot;Hulet&quot;, in 1978, before George Oban ( who later played with Burning Spear and African Headcharge ) departed the band in 1979, with Robinson taking over the position of bassist as well as continuing his role as keyboardist. The following year saw Griffiths depart, leaving Forde as the band&#x27;s sole guitarist. During this early period in the band&#x27;s history they were distinctly different from Jamaican reggae acts, in that they wrote songs that dealt with the issues surrounding the experiences of black youths growing-up in the UK; such as &quot;Three Babylon&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Not Our Wish&quot;,&quot;Natural Progression&quot;, &quot;Ghetto in the Sky&quot;. and the powerful jazz-influenced instrumental &quot;Warrior Charge&quot;, which is still much played by roots reggae sound systems worldwide. The band continued making roots reggae and dub music, and in 1985, released &quot;Jah Shaka Meets Aswad in Addis Ababa Studio.&quot;

Once the band&#x27;s line-up had stabilised into the trio of Forde, Gaye, and Robinson, Aswad followed a more commercial reggae style, gaining a wider audience with the &quot;New Chapter&quot; album (1981). They then followed this with the Michael Reuben Campbell-produced &quot;A New Chapter of Dub&quot; LP which was a dub of the entire &quot;New Chapter&quot; album. Clifton &quot;Bigga&quot; Morrison of Prince Far I&#x27;s band, The Arabs, played bass on some of the tracks. &quot;Not Satisfied&quot; was a London roots-reggae album released in 1982. In August 1983, Aswad played live at Meanwhile Gardens on the Sunday of the Notting Hill Carnival; the resulting live album &quot;Live and Direct&quot; is a faithful record of that event, where they played a live dub set. &quot;Love Fire&quot; gained wide recognition when it was used as the backing rhythm for Dennis Brown&#x27;s &quot;Promised Land&quot;.

Among Aswad&#x27;s catalogue of hits is &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Around&quot;, a UK No. 1 hit in 1988, originally recorded by Tina Turner as a B-side to her &quot;Typical Male&quot; single. They followed this up with UK No. 11 hit &quot;Give a Little Love&quot;, and a reggae-flavoured rendition of &quot;Best of My Love&quot;, first popularised and written by The Eagles. In 1989, they contributed the single &quot;Set Them Free&quot; to the Greenpeace &quot;Rainbow Warriors&quot; album. In the same year, they performed together with Cliff Richard the song &quot;Share a Dream&quot;, recorded the previous year, at Wembley Stadium as part of The Event (16 and 17 June 1989). Their next single, &quot;Shine&quot;, was released in 1994 and was a big hit in much of Europe. Another track was the upbeat 1998 remake of The Police&#x27;s &quot;Invisible Sun&quot;, performed with Sting.

The band also hold the distinction of having played with each one of the ex-Wailers.

The band has toured extensively, playing in diverse locations from London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall and Montego Bay&#x27;s Reggae Sunsplash, to gigs in West Africa, Israel and Japan.

Aswad underwent their first line-up change in sixteen years in 1996, when Forde departed the band for spiritual reasons, leaving Gaye as the only founding member. Once again, the remaining members opted not to seek to recruit a replacement musician, and thus Aswad became a duo of Gaye and Robinson. With the exception of a brief reunion with Forde in 2009 for the Island record label&#x27;s 50th-anniversary celebrations, the band&#x27;s line-up remained the same until Angus Gaye’s death on 2 September 2022, aged 62.

Aswad released their final studio album to date in 2009, with &quot;City Lock&quot;. They released the singles &quot;What Is Love?&quot; and &quot;Do That Thing&quot; in the same year.

<text>Stephen John Ging Fearing (born January 14 1963) is a Canadian roots/folk singer-songwriter. In addition to his solo career, Fearing co-founded Canadian roots-rock supergroup Blackie and the Rodeo Kings with Colin Linden and Tom Wilson. He is one half of the duo Fearing &amp; White, with Irish artist Andy White.

== Solo career ==
Stephen Fearing was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, and raised in Dublin, Ireland. He returned to Canada in 1981 via Minneapolis, Minnesota, and began pursuing a career in music. Soon after his return, he released a cassette-only, self-titled album in 1986. He was then signed to the Canadian label Aural Tradition. In 1988 he released &quot;Out to Sea&quot;, which was co-produced by Steve Darke and Fearing in Vancouver. The album was followed by &quot;Blue Line&quot;, in 1991, which was produced in London by Clive Gregson and features B.J. Cole on pedal steel.

Soon after, Fearing was signed to True North Records. It was also at this time that he began working with manager Bernie Finkelstein. True North re-released Fearing&#x27;s first two efforts &quot;Out to Sea&quot; and &quot;Blue Line&quot;. His first official release for the label was &quot;The Assassin&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, in 1994. Produced by Los Lobos&#x27; Steve Berlin, the album features musical contributions from Sarah McLachlan and Richard Thompson. It was nominated for Best Roots &amp; Traditional Album at the 1995 Juno Awards.

In 1996, Fearing joined forces with Colin Linden and Tom Wilson to form Blackie and the Rodeo Kings. Originally teaming up to record a tribute album to the work of Ontario-born songwriter Willie P. Bennett, the band has gone on to write and record original material for a series of critically acclaimed albums.

Fearing returned to his solo career with 1998&#x27;s &quot;Industrial Lullaby&quot;. The album features two co-writes with Blackie and the Rodeo Kings bandmate Tom Wilson. It also includes a collaboration with Willie P. Bennett on the track &quot;Coryanna&quot;. The album went on to earn a Best Roots &amp; Traditional Album nomination at the 1998 Juno Awards.

In 2000, Fearing released &quot;So Many Miles&quot;. Recorded by Colin Linden, the album compiles two nights of performances at Toronto&#x27;s Tranzac and is made up of songs from his catalogue and a cover of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Thrasher&quot;, which he had originally recorded for the 1994 album &quot;Borrowed Tunes: A Tribute to Neil Young&quot;.

For his next album, &quot;That&#x27;s How I Walk&quot;, Fearing enlisted the help of Colin Linden as a co-producer. The sessions for the album took place in Toronto and Nashville and featured the backing band of Gary Craig (drums and percussion), John Dymond (bass), Ben Riley (drums and percussion), and Roberto Occhipinti (upright bass). Richard Bell, Ian Thornley (Big Wreck), Leonard Podolak (Scruj MacDuk), and Shawn Colvin also made guest appearances. The album was mastered by John Whynot. Its cover photo was shot by Margaret Malandruccolo and features art direction from Michael Wrycraft. Considered one of Fearing&#x27;s definitive works, it was nominated for Best Roots and Traditional Album at the 2003 Juno Awards.

His next album, &quot;Yellowjacket&quot;, saw him taking on the role of producer for the first time on his own. Scott Merritt engineered and mixed the session. The title track was written with Tom Wilson. The idea was spawned following a drive they shared from Nashville to Ontario while taking Yellow Jacket caffeine pills to stay awake. The album features performances from Dan Whiteley (Heartbreak Hill), Jeff Bird (Cowboy Junkies), backing vocalist Suzie Vinnick, Josh Finlayson, Colin Linden, Gary Craig, John Dymond and Richard Bell. It went on to earn Fearing his first solo Juno Award, taking home the 2007 Roots &amp; Traditional Album of the Year: Solo award.

In 2009, Fearing returned with &quot;The Man Who Married Music&quot;, a best-of collection compiling songs from his back catalogue and featuring two new tracks (&quot;The Big East West&quot; and &quot;No Dress Rehearsal&quot;). Following the release of the album, he left True North Records after 20 years.

&quot;Between Hurricanes&quot; was released January 29, 2013, on LowdenProud Records. The album features 10 songs written or co-written by Fearing with a bonus cover of the Gordon Lightfoot song &quot;Early Morning Rain&quot;. The record was coproduced by John Whynot, who has worked with Fearing on numerous Blackie and the Rodeo Kings albums.

In 2017 Fearing released his 10th solo album, &quot;Every Soul&#x27;s a Sailor&quot;. The album was preceded by the single &quot;Blowhard Nation&quot;, an anti-Trump protest song which was released in September 2016 prior to the controversial United States presidential election that year. Recorded primarily at Canterbury Music Company in July 2016, the record was co-produced by Fearing and David Travers-Smith. Gary Craig (drums) and John Dymond (bass), the acclaimed rhythm section for Blackie and The Rodeo Kings for over 20 years, performed on the album. Rose Cousins provided guest vocals for the tracks &quot;Gone But Not Forgotten&quot; and &quot;Red Lights in the Rain&quot;, and co-producer Travers-Smith plays horns for &quot;Gone But Not Forgotten&quot;. The album was named the 2017 Worldwide Album of the Year by Blues &amp; Roots Radio and earned Fearing the 2017 Contemporary Singer of the Year award from the Canadian Folk Music Awards.

He followed up the acclaimed studio album with a limited-edition, vinyl-only release &quot;The Secret of Climbing&quot; on September 10, 2018. Fearing collaborated on the project with two music industry legends: the album&#x27;s co-producer and veteran engineer Roy Gandy, co-founder of UK-based hi-fi manufacturer Rega Research, and international mastering engineer Ray Staff.

Fearing has also produced recordings for other artists, including Suzie Vinnick’s Juno-nominated &quot;Happy Here&quot; (2008), for which Fearing co-wrote most of the songs.

== Fearing and White ==
In 2011, Fearing collaborated with longtime friend, Northern Ireland–born performer Andy White, to write and record a full-length album, &quot;Fearing &amp; White&quot;. Produced by Scott Merritt at his Guelph studio, the Cottage, the record features thirteen songs, written over the course of the duo&#x27;s ten-year friendship.

In 2014 the duo released a second album, &quot;Tea and Confidences&quot;, on LowdenProud Records.

<text>Twins in mythology are in many cultures around the world. In some cultures they are seen as ominous, and in others they are seen as auspicious. Twins in mythology are often cast as two halves of the same whole, sharing a bond deeper than that of ordinary siblings, or seen as fierce rivals. They can be seen as representations of a dualistic worldview. They can represent another aspect of the self, a doppelgänger, or a shadow.

Twins are often depicted with special powers. This applies to both mortal and immortal sets of twins, and often is related to power over the weather. Twins in mythology also often share deep bonds. In Greek mythology, Castor and Pollux share a bond so strong that when mortal Castor dies, Pollux gives up half of his immortality to be with his brother. Castor and Pollux are the Dioscuri twin brothers. Their mother is Leda, a being who was seduced by Zeus who had taken the form of a swan. Even though the brothers are twins, they have two different fathers. This phenomenon is a very common interpretation of twin births across different mythological cultures. Castor&#x27;s father is Tyndareus, the king of Sparta (hence the mortal form). Pollux is the son of Zeus (demigod). This brothers were said to be born from an egg along with either sister Helen and Clytemnestra. This etymologically explains why their constellation, the Dioskouroi or Gemini, is only seen during one half of the year, as the twins split their time between the underworld and Mount Olympus. In an aboriginal tale, the same constellation represents the twin lizards who created the plants and animals and saved women from evil spirits. Another example of this strong bond shared between twins is the Ibeji twins from African mythology. Ibeji twins are viewed as one soul shared between two bodies. If one of the twins dies, the parents then create a doll that portrays the body of the deceased child, so the soul of the deceased can remain intact for the living twin. Without the creation of the doll, the living twin is almost destined for death because it is believed to be missing half of its soul. Twins in mythology are often associated with healing. They are also often gifted with the ability of divination or insight into the future.

Divine twins in twin mythology are identical to either one or both place of a god. The Feri gods are not separated entities but are unified into one center. These divine twins can function alone in one body, either functioning as a male or as male and female as they desire. Divine twins represent a polarity in the world. This polarity may be great or small and at times can be opposition. Twins are often seen to be rivals or adversaries.

<text>In number theory, more specifically in local class field theory, the ramification groups are a filtration of the Galois group of a local field extension, which gives detailed information on the ramification phenomena of the extension.

==Ramification theory of valuations==
In mathematics, the ramification theory of valuations studies the set of extensions of a valuation &quot;v&quot; of a field &quot;K&quot; to an extension &quot;L&quot; of &quot;K&quot;. It is a generalization of the ramification theory of Dedekind domains.

The structure of the set of extensions is known better when &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is Galois.

===Decomposition group and inertia group===

Let (&quot;K&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) be a valued field and let &quot;L&quot; be a finite Galois extension of &quot;K&quot;. Let &quot;Sv&quot; be the set of equivalence classes of extensions of &quot;v&quot; to &quot;L&quot; and let &quot;G&quot; be the Galois group of &quot;L&quot; over &quot;K&quot;. Then &quot;G&quot; acts on &quot;Sv&quot; by σ[&quot;w&quot;] = [&quot;w&quot; ∘ σ] (i.e. &quot;w&quot; is a representative of the equivalence class [&quot;w&quot;] ∈ &quot;Sv&quot; and [&quot;w&quot;] is sent to the equivalence class of the composition of &quot;w&quot; with the automorphism ; this is independent of the choice of &quot;w&quot; in [&quot;w&quot;]). In fact, this action is transitive.

Given a fixed extension &quot;w&quot; of &quot;v&quot; to &quot;L&quot;, the decomposition group of &quot;w&quot; is the stabilizer subgroup &quot;Gw&quot; of [&quot;w&quot;], i.e. it is the subgroup of &quot;G&quot; consisting of all elements that fix the equivalence class [&quot;w&quot;] ∈ &quot;Sv&quot;.

Let &quot;mw&quot; denote the maximal ideal of &quot;w&quot; inside the valuation ring &quot;Rw&quot; of &quot;w&quot;. The inertia group of &quot;w&quot; is the subgroup &quot;Iw&quot; of &quot;Gw&quot; consisting of elements &quot;σ&quot; such that σ&quot;x&quot; ≡ &quot;x&quot; (mod &quot;mw&quot;) for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;Rw&quot;. In other words, &quot;Iw&quot; consists of the elements of the decomposition group that act trivially on the residue field of &quot;w&quot;. It is a normal subgroup of &quot;Gw&quot;.

The reduced ramification index &quot;e&quot;(&quot;w&quot;/&quot;v&quot;) is independent of &quot;w&quot; and is denoted &quot;e&quot;(&quot;v&quot;). Similarly, the relative degree &quot;f&quot;(&quot;w&quot;/&quot;v&quot;) is also independent of &quot;w&quot; and is denoted &quot;f&quot;(&quot;v&quot;).

== Ramification groups in lower numbering ==
Ramification groups are a refinement of the Galois group formula_1 of a finite formula_2 Galois extension of local fields. We shall write formula_3 for the valuation, the ring of integers and its maximal ideal for formula_4. As a consequence of Hensel&#x27;s lemma, one can write formula_5 for some formula_6 where formula_7 is the ring of integers of formula_8. (This is stronger than the primitive element theorem.) Then, for each integer formula_9, we define formula_10 to be the set of all formula_11 that satisfies the following equivalent conditions.
*(i) formula_12 operates trivially on formula_13
*(ii) formula_14 for all formula_15
*(iii) formula_16

The group formula_10 is called &quot;formula_18-th ramification group&quot;. They form a decreasing filtration,
:formula_19
In fact, the formula_10 are normal by (i) and trivial for sufficiently large formula_18 by (iii). For the lowest indices, it is customary to call formula_22 the inertia subgroup of formula_1 because of its relation to splitting of prime ideals, while formula_24 the wild inertia subgroup of formula_1. The quotient formula_26 is called the tame quotient.

The Galois group formula_1 and its subgroups formula_10 are studied by employing the above filtration or, more specifically, the corresponding quotients. In particular,
*formula_29 where formula_30 are the (finite) residue fields of formula_31.
*formula_32 is unramified.
*formula_33 is tamely ramified (i.e., the ramification index is prime to the residue characteristic.)

The study of ramification groups reduces to the totally ramified case since one has formula_34 for formula_35.

One also defines the function formula_36. (ii) in the above shows formula_37 is independent of choice of formula_38 and, moreover, the study of the filtration formula_10 is essentially equivalent to that of formula_37. formula_37 satisfies the following: for formula_42,
*formula_43
*formula_44
*formula_45

Fix a uniformizer formula_46 of formula_4. Then formula_48 induces the injection formula_49 where formula_50. (The map actually does not depend on the choice of the uniformizer.) It follows from this
*formula_51 is cyclic of order prime to formula_52
*formula_53 is a product of cyclic groups of order formula_52.
In particular, formula_24 is a &quot;p&quot;-group and formula_22 is solvable.

The ramification groups can be used to compute the different formula_57 of the extension formula_2 and that of subextensions:

:formula_59

If formula_60 is a normal subgroup of formula_1, then, for formula_62, formula_63.

Combining this with the above one obtains: for a subextension formula_64 corresponding to formula_60,
:formula_66

If formula_67, then formula_68. In the terminology of Lazard, this can be understood to mean the Lie algebra formula_69 is abelian.

===Example: the cyclotomic extension===
The ramification groups for a cyclotomic extension formula_70, where formula_71 is a formula_72-th primitive root of unity, can be described explicitly:
:formula_73
where &quot;e&quot; is chosen such that formula_74.

===Example: a quartic extension===
Let &quot;K&quot; be the extension of generated by formula_75. The conjugates of formula_76 are formula_77, formula_78, formula_79.

A little computation shows that the quotient of any two of these is a unit. Hence they all generate the same ideal; call it . formula_80 generates 2; (2)=4.

Now formula_81, which is in 5.

and formula_82 which is in 3.

Various methods show that the Galois group of &quot;K&quot; is formula_83, cyclic of order 4. Also:

: formula_84

and formula_85

formula_86 so that the different formula_87

formula_76 satisfies &quot;X&quot;4 − 4&quot;X&quot;2 + 2, which has discriminant 2048 = 211.

== Ramification groups in upper numbering ==
If formula_89 is a real number formula_90, let formula_91 denote formula_10 where &quot;i&quot; the least integer formula_93. In other words, formula_94 Define formula_95 by
:formula_96
where, by convention, formula_97 is equal to formula_98 if formula_99 and is equal to formula_100 for formula_101. Then formula_102 for formula_103. It is immediate that formula_95 is continuous and strictly increasing, and thus has the continuous inverse function formula_105 defined on formula_106. Define
formula_107.
formula_108 is then called the &quot;v&quot;-th ramification group in upper numbering. In other words, formula_109. Note formula_110. The upper numbering is defined so as to be compatible with passage to quotients: if formula_60 is normal in formula_1, then
:formula_113 for all formula_114
(whereas lower numbering is compatible with passage to subgroups.)

===Herbrand&#x27;s theorem===
Herbrand&#x27;s theorem states that the ramification groups in the lower numbering satisfy formula_115 (for formula_116 where formula_117 is the subextension corresponding to formula_60), and that the ramification groups in the upper numbering satisfy formula_119. This allows one to define ramification groups in the upper numbering for infinite Galois extensions (such as the absolute Galois group of a local field) from the inverse system of ramification groups for finite subextensions.

The upper numbering for an abelian extension is important because of the Hasse–Arf theorem. It states that if formula_1 is abelian, then the jumps in the filtration formula_108 are integers; i.e., formula_122 whenever formula_123 is not an integer.

The upper numbering is compatible with the filtration of the norm residue group by the unit groups under the Artin isomorphism. The image of formula_124 under the isomorphism

:formula_125

is just

:formula_126

<doc id="501615" wikidata="Q33797" url="?curid=501615" title="Norfuk language">
<text>Norfuk () (increasingly spelt Norfolk) or Norf&#x27;k is the language spoken on Norfolk Island (in the Pacific Ocean) by the local residents. It is a blend of 18th-century English and Tahitian, originally introduced by Pitkern-speaking settlers from the Pitcairn Islands. Along with English, it is the co-official language of Norfolk Island.

Norfuk has always been a linguistic cant. As travel to and from Norfolk Island becomes more common, Norfuk is falling into disuse. Efforts are being made to restore the language to more common usage, such as the education of children, the publication of English–Norfuk dictionaries, the use of the language in signage, and the renaming of some tourist attractions – most notably the rainforest walk &quot;&quot; – to their Norfuk equivalents. In 2007, the United Nations added Norfuk to its list of endangered languages.

== History ==
In the 1970s, the Norfolk community and specialists from mainland Australia noted that the Norfuk language was falling into decline, prompting discussions about how to implement Norfolk into the school system. At this point in time, Norfuk did not have a standardized writing system, as it was mostly an oral language. The Society of the Descendants of Pitcairn Islanders, founded in 1977, was a driving force behind the campaign to include Norfuk language as a teachable subject in schools. Faye Bataille was one of the first to teach Norfolk classes in public schools, in the 1980s.

The first Norfolk dictionary was compiled in 1986 by Beryl Nobbs-Palmer. It was titled &quot;A Dictionary of Norfolk words and usages&quot; and contained examples of words in the Norfuk language and how to use them.

The book &quot;Speak Norfuk Today&quot; was written by Alice Buffett and Dr Donald Laycock. It is an encyclopedia incorporating a large majority of the information about the Norfuk language and was one of the first instances in which the orthography of Norfuk was documented.

Norfuk became a language of Norfolk Island in 2004 by virtue of the Norfolk Island Language (Norf&#x27;k) Act 2004 passed by the island&#x27;s legislative assembly.

In 2018, Eve Semple and colleagues received a grant from the Australian Research Council, in order to promote and facilitate revival.

==Relationship to Pitkern==
Norfuk is descended predominantly from the Pitkern (Pitcairnese or Pi&#x27;kern) spoken by settlers from the Pitcairn Islands. The relative ease of travel from English-speaking countries such as Australia and New Zealand to Norfolk Island, particularly when compared with that of travel to the Pitcairn Islands, has meant that Norfuk has been exposed to much greater contact with English relative to Pitkern. The difficulties in accessing the Pitcairn population have meant that a serious comparison of the two languages for mutual intelligibility has proven difficult.

==Classification==
Norfuk has been classified as an Atlantic Creole language, despite the island&#x27;s location in the Pacific Ocean, because of the heavy influence of Ned Young, a Saint Kitts Creole-speaker, and his role as a &quot;linguistic socializer&quot; among the first generation of children born on Pitcairn.

The language is closely related to Pitkern but has no other close relatives other than its parent tongues of English and Tahitian. It is generally considered that English has had more of an influence upon the language than Tahitian, with words of Tahitian extraction being confined largely to taboo subjects, negative characterisations, and adjectives indicating that something is undesirable.

Many expressions which are not commonly used in contemporary English carry on in Pitkern. These expressions include words from British maritime culture in the age of sailing ships. The influence of Seventh-day Adventist missionaries and the King James Version of the Bible are also notable.

In the mid-19th century, the people of Pitcairn resettled on Norfolk Island; later, some moved back. Most speakers of Pitkern today are the descendants of those who stayed. Pitkern and Norfuk dialects are mutually intelligible, but differ significantly in vocabulary and grammar.

The Norfolk language uses the subject–verb–object (SVO) basic word order.

== Phonology ==
==Orthography==
The language is largely a spoken rather than written language, and there is a lack of standardisation. However, a number of attempts have been made at developing an orthography for the language. Early attempts either attempted to enforce English spelling onto the Norfuk words, or used diacritical marks to represent sounds distinct to the language.

Alice Buffett, a Norfolk Island parliamentarian and Australian-trained linguist, developed a codified grammar and orthography for the language in the 1980s, assisted by Dr Donald Laycock, an Australian National University academic. Their book, &quot;Speak Norfuk Today,&quot; was published in 1988. This orthography has won the endorsement of the Norfolk Island government, and its use is becoming prevalent.

==Vocabulary==
The language itself does not have words to express some concepts, particularly those having to do with science and technology. Some Islanders believe that the only solution is to create a committee charged with creating new words in Norfuk rather than simply adopting English words for new technological advances. For example, Norfuk recently adopted the word , a Norfuk-ised version of &quot;computer&quot;. Processes similar to this exist in relation to other languages around the world, such as the Māori language in New Zealand and the Faroese and Icelandic languages. Some languages already have official bodies, such as New Zealand&#x27;s Māori Language Commission or France&#x27;s Académie française, for creating new words.

Norfuk vocabulary has been heavily influenced by the history of Norfolk Island. Many words were created for specific animals or plants on the island and the way in which these things are named is unique to the Island of Norfolk. For example, many fish that are indigenous to the island were named either by the people who caught them or by whoever received them after dividing the catch. One such instance is the naming of the fish which received its name by a man named Sandford Warren after receiving the fish as his share.

==Personal pronouns==
There is also for &#x27;it&#x27; in its object form.

<doc id="501627" wikidata="Q1546111" url="?curid=501627" title="Troika Games">
<text>Troika Games was an American video game developer co-founded by Jason Anderson, Tim Cain, and Leonard Boyarsky. The company was focused on role-playing video games between 1998 and 2005, best known for &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

==History==

In 1997, Tim Cain, Leonard Boyarsky, and Jason Anderson worked on the &quot;Fallout&quot; sequel at Interplay. Finishing the initial design for &quot;Fallout 2&quot;, they were unable to come to an agreement with Interplay about the future team structure. They formed their new company, called Troika Games (a Russian word &quot;Тройка&quot; meaning &quot;three of a kind&quot;) since they were the three key developers behind the critically acclaimed &quot;Fallout&quot;, on April 1, 1998. They initially planned to do games exclusively for one publisher (Sierra Entertainment), but a different company published each game. After being unable to secure funding for future projects, they were forced to lay off their staff in late 2004 and later closed their doors on February 24, 2005.

==Games==
In 1998, Troika started designing a steampunk fantasy crossover role-playing video game named &quot;&quot; and convinced Sierra Entertainment to publish it. The game was launched on August 21, 2001. While criticized for being unpolished and having a bad combat engine, it received generally favorable reviews, averaging 81% on Metacritic. With 234,000 units sold, it is Troika&#x27;s best-selling game. In 2016 it was released on Steam, where as of March 2017, it has over 200,000 owners.

After &quot;Arcanum&quot; was released in 2001, two teams started to work on two different games. One team created &quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot; for publisher Atari which was released on September 26, 2003. It was lauded for the good implementation of the D&amp;D 3.5 system, but overall it got mixed reviews due to gameplay bugs and a lack of a plot. With a 71% on Metacritic, it was the lowest-rated Troika game. It sold about 128,000 units.

The other team worked for Activision on &quot;&quot;. Using an early version of the Source engine, development was finished in October 2004. Due to contractual obligations with Valve, Activision was not allowed to release the game before Valve released &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, scheduled for release in November 2004. Troika Games used the interim period to code a patch into the main program. &quot;Bloodlines&quot; was released on November 16, 2004 (the same day as &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;). Critics praised &quot;Bloodlines&quot;″ visuals, audio, and story but warned of bugs. It got a rating of 80% on Metacritic and sold merely 72,000 units on its original release. With the addition of the game to the digital distributors Direct2Drive and Steam in 2016, many units were sold digitally. As of March 2017, approximately 550,000 people own the game on Steam.

In 2004, Troika tried to find a publisher for an unnamed post-apocalyptic role-playing video game but was unsuccessful, leading to rumors in January 2005 that the company had already shut down. Screenshots of the unnamed game were posted in 2004 to the &quot;Fallout&quot; fan sites &quot;No Mutants Allowed&quot; and &quot;Duck and Cover&quot;. A tech demo video was released in early 2005, weeks before closing. Tim Cain later confirmed that this was supposed to be a sequel to &quot;Fallout&quot;: &quot;Leonard pursued &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, which ultimately went to Bethesda, who outbid us.&quot;

===List of games===
== Trivia ==
Troika, which means &quot;three of a kind&quot; in Russian (&quot;Тройка&quot;) ultimately made a total of three games over a course of three years with three developers.

<doc id="501628" wikidata="Q941322" url="?curid=501628" title="Third Battle of Gaza">
<text>The Third Battle of Gaza was fought on the night of 1–2 November 1917 between British and Ottoman forces during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I and came after the British Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) victory at the Battle of Beersheba had ended the Stalemate in Southern Palestine. The fighting occurred at the beginning of the Southern Palestine Offensive, and, together with attacks on Hareira and Sheria on 6–7 November and the continuing Battle of Tel el Khuweilfe, which had been launched by General Edmund Allenby on 1 November, it eventually broke the Gaza-to-Beersheba line defended by the Yildirim Army Group. Despite having held this line since March 1917, the Ottoman Army was forced to evacuate Gaza and Tel el Khuweilfe during the night of 6–7 November. Only Sheria held out for most of 7 November before it too was captured.

Following British defeats at the First and Second battles of Gaza in March and April 1917, Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode commanding the EEF&#x27;s Eastern Force and Kress von Kressenstein&#x27;s Ottoman Empire force had each adopted a defensive posture and a stalemate had developed in Southern Palestine. Entrenched defences approximately on the lines held at the end of the second battle were strengthened, and both sides undertook regular mounted reconnaissances into the open eastern flank. In late June, Allenby replaced General Archibald Murray as commander of the EEF, which he quickly reorganised. At about the same time, the Ottoman Fourth Army was also restructured. As the stalemate continued in terrible conditions through the summer, reinforcements began to arrive to replace the large number of casualties suffered by the EEF during the previous fighting for Gaza, while several additional divisions also arrived. The Ottoman defenders were also reinforced at this time, and both sides carried out training while manning the front lines and monitoring the open eastern flank. By mid-October, as the Battle of Passchendaele continued on the Western Front, the last of the British reinforcements arrived as Allenby&#x27;s preparations to commence a campaign of manoeuvre neared completion.

Prior to the Second Battle of Gaza, the town had been developed into a strong modern fortress, with entrenchments, wire entanglements and a glacis on its south and south–eastern edges. A series of field works, mutually supported by artillery, machine guns and rifles, extended from Gaza eastwards to within of Beersheba. Beginning on 27 October, the EEF began a heavy and almost continuous bombardment of Gaza. During this time, the EEF&#x27;s XXI Corps, holding the Gaza section of the line, had been mostly passive until the night of 1/2 November, when a series of determined night-time assaults were mounted against the Gaza defences. Yet these attacks were only partially successful due to the strength of the garrison. The bombardment of Gaza intensified on 6 November and during the night of 6/7 November successful attacks were launched on several trench systems. On the morning of 7 November, Gaza was found to have been evacuated during the night. The Gaza to Beersheba line subsequently collapsed and the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies were forced into retreat. Following several battles during the pursuit, the EEF captured Jerusalem on 9 December 1917.

== Background ==

Gaza was &quot;a strong modern fortress, well entrenched and wired, with good observation and a glacis on its southern and south–eastern face.&quot; These defences which were too strong for a daytime attack were extended eastwards by a series of &quot;field works&quot; to from Beersheba. These fortifications were between apart, each mutually supported by fire from artillery, machine guns and rifles.

As the troops of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) began to concentrate in preparation for their attacks, they left their camps standing to deceive German and Ottoman aerial reconnaissances. The EEF assumed their opponents thought there were still six infantry divisions in the Gaza area and one in the eastern sector towards Beersheba. However, according to Falls, &quot;[t]here is evidence that the [Yildirim Army Group] were fairly accurately informed of the British dispositions.&quot; On 28 October, they knew the camps at Khan Yunis and Rafa were empty and accurately placed three infantry divisions east of the Wadi Ghuzzee with a fourth, the 10th (Irish) Division approaching the wadi. They estimated more cavalry at Asluj and Khalasa than was actually there.
The loss of Beersheba on 31 October stunned the Yildirim Army Group commander and staff. The Beersheba garrison withdrew either to the Ottoman defences around Tel es Sheria or northwards to Tel el Khuweilfe to defend the Hebron road. Here a considerable force, including all available reserve units, was deployed in the Kuweilfeh area to stop a threatened advance up the Hebron road to Jerusalem about to the north. According to Powles, &quot; ... the Turkish line had been thrown back on its left, but not broken.&quot; The remainder of the Ottoman line stretching westward to the Mediterranean coast continued to be strongly defended, particularly at Hareira, Sharia and Gaza, but the loss of Beersheba had placed EEF mounted units across the Beersheba to Hebron and Jerusalem road, and three Eighth Army infantry battalions were sent by the German General Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein to reinforce the Ottoman troops fighting at Khuweilfe to protect the road. They established a new defensive line north of Beersheba, and the 19th Division was sent from the XXII Corps defending Gaza to reinforce the new line at Ebuhof. However, the objective of the EEF advance north of Beersheba was to separate the Ottoman forces supplied by the roads and railways from Ramleh on the maritime plain from those supplied by the motor road from Jerusalem north of Beersheba. Such an advance would also place the EEF infantry corps in a position to begin to &quot;roll up&quot; the Ottoman flank.

== Prelude ==

The EEF controlled the coastal sea lanes, and the Intelligence Service spread rumours about possible sea landings in the rear of Gaza. Ships were seen taking soundings off the coast and a fleet of small boats was located near Deir el Belah. During the late afternoon of 1 November, an embarkation of members of the Egyptian Labour Corps onto motor launches, trawlers and tugs at Deir el Belah was staged as a feint, giving the appearance of continuing into the night. The next morning, two trawlers appeared off the mouth of the Wadi el Hesi north of Gaza. To add to the confusion, between the Battle of Beersheba on 31 October and the main attacks at the Battle of Hareira and Sheria beginning on 6 November, the Ottoman left flank north of Beersheba was being fiercely contested during the Battle of Tel el Khuweilfe for control of the road to Hebron and Jerusalem. According to Wavell, &quot;an assault on a portion of the Gaza defences was to be made by the XXI Corps.&quot; The date of this attack, which was primarily a feint, was scheduled for between 24 and 48 hours before the attack on Sheria.

Meanwhile, preparations for the main attacks on the Gaza line at Hareira and Sharia, began on 1 November when the 53rd (Welsh) Division, with the Imperial Camel Brigade on the right, advanced northwards to occupy a line to the west without opposition. This placed the infantry in a position from which they could cover the right flank of the proposed attack by the XX Corps on Hareira and Sheria.

=== Defenders ===
After the second battle for Gaza in April 1917, Kress von Kressenstein commander of the victorious 3rd, 16th and 53rd Divisionswas reinforced by the 7th and 54th Divisions. The 7th Infantry Division (later part of the Eighth Army) had experienced four months of strategic movement, similar to that of the 54th Division. Having arrived at Jerusalem, in early Infantry Regiment began company-level training. After moving to Beersheba where they remained in reserve, they participated in theatre-specific training until late June, when they went into the front line. Training in fortification, reconnaissance, and counter–reconnaissance continued. The 21st Infantry Regiment received similar training, and on 6 August the regimental colours of the 20th and 21st Infantry Regiments were awarded military medals for service in the Gallipoli Campaign. At Beersheba on 28 June, the 7th Infantry Division inactivated the fourth company of each infantry battalion, before activating a machine gun company armed with light machine guns, in every infantry battalion on 10 August. Every Ottoman infantry division in Palestine repeated this reorganisation, with one quarter of their rifle strength being replaced by light machine guns, considerably increasing their fire power and strengthening their offensive and defensive capabilities. Following orders from von Kressenstein commanding the Gaza to Beersheba line defences, assault detachments equivalent to the German &quot;Stosstruppen&quot; (Stormtroopers) were formed. The 7th Division activated an assault detachment of fifty men on 17 July 1917.

The Yildirim Army Group under the command of Field Marshal Erich von Falkenhayn was responsible for the defence of Palestine. On the western flank the Ottoman Eighth Army was composed of the XXII Corps&#x27; 3rd and 53rd Divisions defending Gaza and the XX Corps&#x27; 26th and 54th Divisions defending the line stretching to the east of Gaza, under the command of von Kressenstein. The defence of Gaza was the responsibility of XXII Corps, which had two divisions in the front line (53rd, 3rd from west to east) and two in reserve (7th and 19th). The XXII Corps&#x27; four regiments had 4,500 rifles, which were reinforced by two divisions to bring the total to 8,000 defenders, deployed thus:
* 53rd Division holding from the Mediterranean shore to the eastern side of Gaza (veteran of the Second Battle of Gaza),
* 3rd Division on their left (veteran of the First and Second Battles of Gaza), and the
* 7th Division in reserve close behind.

These three divisions were supported by the 116 guns of the Ottoman XXII Corps artillery, six large naval guns and several batteries of 150 mm howitzers.

On the left of the XX Corps the Ottoman Seventh Army defended Beersheba, under the command of Fevzi Pasa.

=== Attackers ===

The EEF comprised 200,000 men including Arab workers, 46,000 horses, 20,000 camels, more than 15,000 mules and donkeys, and hundreds of artillery pieces. The fighting strength of the EEF was 100,189:
* Desert Mounted Corps commanded by Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel had 745 officers, 17,935 other ranks in the Anzac, Australian and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions;
* XX Corps commanded by Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode had 1,435 officers, 44,171 other ranks in the 10th, 53rd, 60th and 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions; and
* XXI Corps commanded by Lieutenant General Edward Bulfin had 1,154 officers and 34,759 other ranks in three infantry divisions. By 30 October there were 35,000 rifles in the XXI Corps deployed to attack Gaza. They were:

:*52nd (Lowland) Division (veteran of the First and Second Battles of Gaza)
:*54th (East Anglian) Division (veteran of the First and Second Battles of Gaza)
:*75th Division
:* Composite Force of almost a division, consisting of the 25th Indian Infantry Brigade, a West Indian battalion, the French &quot;Détachement français de Palestine&quot; and the Italian &quot;Distaccamento italiano di Palestina&quot;, was camped east of the 75th Division.
:*Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade 1,000 sabres
:*XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment, also known as the Composite Regiment, consisted of one squadron each from the Royal Glasgow Yeomanry, the Duke of Lancaster Yeomanry, and the 1/1st Hertfordshire Yeomanry.
The majority of General Edmund Allenby&#x27;s infantry were Territorial divisions, mobilised at the outbreak of the war. Most had fought the Ottoman Army before. During the Gallipoli Campaign, the 52nd (Lowland) Division fought at Cape Helles, the 53rd (Welsh) Division and the 54th (East Anglian) Division fought at Suvla Bay, while the 60th (London) Division had served on the Western Front and on the Salonika front. The recently formed 74th (Yeomanry) Division was raised from eighteen under-strength yeomanry regiments, all of which had fought dismounted at Gallipoli. The 10th (Irish) Division was a New Army (K1) division, and had also fought at Suvla Bay and at Salonika. All three of the brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division and the two light horse brigades of the Australian Mounted Division had also fought at Gallipoli.

Army Wing aircraft were assigned to carry out strategic reconnaissances, to report on Ottoman reserves well behind their lines, to carry out daily photography, and to conduct air raids. Fighter and bombing squadrons were established for these purposes while the Corps Squadrons were attached to the two infantry corps carried out artillery and contact patrols, along with tactical reconnaissance.

==== Sherifial Forces ====
In July, Allenby was hopeful that T. E. Lawrence and the Sherifial Arab force could support a September attack by the EEF, recognising that harvests were being collected before that time, and that after the end of September they normally moved to camel-grazing lands in the Syrian desert. He wrote, &quot;They, naturally, won&#x27;t and can&#x27;t do much unless I move; and it is not much use their destroying the Turks&#x27; communications unless I take immediate advantage of such destruction ... If I bring them into the fight and do not make progress myself, this will also expose them to retaliationwhich to some tribes, such as the Druzes, S. of Damascus, may mean annihilation.&quot; The EEF encouraged the Bedouin to defect:
== Battle ==
Four EEF infantry brigades of 10,000 rifles attacked four Ottoman regiments of 4,500 rifleswhich were reinforced by two divisions to over 8,000. Both sides suffered heavy losses. The attacks were to be carried out by well-prepared troops, with overwhelming artillery support and six Mark IV tanks. These attacks were designed to keep the Gaza garrison of 8,000 riflemen supported by 116 guns in place after the capture of Beersheba and during preparations for the main EEF attacks on Hareira and Sheria.

=== Preliminary raids on Outpost Hill ===

On 26 October, units of the 75th Division raided Outpost Hill. Then, just hours after the capture of Beersheba, on 1 November, a second raid by five officers and 220 riflemen of the 3/3rd Gurkhas Rifles (233rd Brigade 75th Division) was carried out against Outpost Hill. At 03:00, under cover of an intense bombardment, they entered the Ottoman defences on the hill; two Gurkhas were killed and twenty-three wounded. During the fighting, they killed twenty-eight Ottoman soldiers and captured sixteen, before returning to their lines. The division was to make another attack during the next night, (1/2 November) towards Atawineh Redoubt, on the Gaza to Beersheba road.

=== Bombardment ===
On 27 October, the XXI Corps artillery began the bombardment of Gaza, which gradually grew more intense with the support of British and French Navy&#x27;s guns from 29 October. They included the guns on HMS &quot;Raglan&quot;, the Monitors &quot;M15&quot; guns, the &quot;M29&quot;, the &quot;M31&quot;, and the &quot;M32&quot; with guns, the cruiser &quot;Grafton&quot;, and the destroyers &quot;Staunch&quot; and &quot;Comet&quot;. French vessels included the &quot;Requin&quot;, &quot;Arbalète&quot;, &quot;Voltigeur&quot;, &quot;Coutelas&quot;, &quot;Fauconneau&quot; and &quot;Hache&quot;. There were also two river gunboats &quot;Ladybird&quot; and &quot;Aphis&quot;, and three seaplane bombers. This flotilla was in actionalthough not altogether to allow for return to Port Said for refuellinguntil the attack on Gaza was launched. The flotilla was targeted by hostile aircraft, while a shell from an Ottoman shore battery hit the mess deck of the &quot;Requin&quot;, causing 38 casualties.

The land based artillery of Bulfin&#x27;s XXI Corps&#x27; heavy artillery consisted of 68 medium and heavy guns and howitzers, which were directed on to the Ottoman batteries during the battle. In addition two 6-inch guns made a surprise attack on the Ottoman railhead at Beit Hanun at a range of , supported by balloon observation. Between 27 October and the attack on Gaza, 15,000 rounds were fired by the heavy artillery; three hundred rounds were allocated for the destruction of each Ottoman battery which had been located. The anti–battery bombardments between 29 and 31 October also fired gas shells, which apparently had little or no effect. Together with the corps&#x27; three divisional artilleries, the guns produced the heaviest bombardment of World War I outside European theatres. The sixth night&#x27;s bombardment from onshore and offshore guns produced &quot;an even heavier concentration of fire on a small area than had been put in on the first day of the Battle of the Somme.&quot; The six-day bombardment program was arranged &quot;so that the whole of the front of our group is plastered all day and every day.&quot;

=== 1/2 November night attacks ===

The XXI Corps attacks were focused on a stretch of sandhills stretching from Umbrella Hill about south-west of Gaza to the Mediterranean Sea. They were timed for the night because the strength of the Ottoman machine guns in defensive positions made day-time attacks impossible. On the right flank, the final objective of the attack was only behind the Ottoman front line, but on the left it was away.

The first phase was the attack at Umbrella Hill by the 1/7th Battalion Scottish Rifles with one company of 1/8th Battalion, Scottish Rifles (156th Brigade, 52nd Division). The second phase was the capture on a broad front of El Arish Redoubt to the Sea Post on the shore by the 1/4th Battalion, Royal Scots and one company of 1/8th Battalion, Scottish Rifles (156th Brigade). The third phase was to be conducted by the 161st Brigade (less one battalion) and the 163rd Brigade (54th Division) against Gaza&#x27;s south-western defences, while the fourth phase by the 162nd Brigade was to capture Gun Hill and Sheikh Hasan behind the front line at Sheikh Ajlin. On 1 and 2 November, the Ottoman 7th and 53rd Divisions continued to defend most of their front line, carrying out locally successful counterattacks.

==== Phase one: Umbrella Hill ====

On 1 November, the assault of Umbrella Hilla sand dune south–west of Gaza to the west of the Rafa to Gaza road overlooking the main objectiveswas to begin at 23:00. The defending garrison was &quot;assumed to be about 350 strong&quot;. However, at 10:50 a preliminary move into No Man&#x27;s Land was observed by Ottoman soldiers in Fisher&#x27;s Orchard, who gave the alarm and began firing machine guns and rifles from the Ottoman trenches on Umbrella Hill. At 23:00, an intense EEF bombardment began enabling a tape to be laid, along which the attacking troops formed up to launch their attack ten minutes later. Under cover of the intense ten-minute bombardment, the 1/7th Battalion, Scottish Rifles with one company of 1/8th Battalion, Scottish Rifles (156th Brigade, 52nd (Lowland) Division) attacked Umbrella Hill. After killing many of the defenders, they quickly captured the hill, three officers, fifty-five Ottoman soldiers, three Lewis guns and numerous bombs. The attackers suffered light casualties; however the sand dune was difficult to defend because the Ottoman trencheswithout revetmentshad virtually disappeared during the previous bombardments. The following Ottoman bombardment of Umbrella Hill caused 103 casualties to the 1/7th Battalion Scottish Rifles during the next twenty-four hours. However, with the hill captured by the 52nd (Lowland) Division, the main attack could begin.

==== Phase two: El Arish redoubt ====

The second phase began at 03:00 on 2 November when the 156th Brigade of the 52nd (Lowland) Division launched the first attack on the El Arish Redoubt. This attack was aimed at breaking the line of defensive fortifications consisting of three groups of trench complexes and redoubts. These were the El Arish, Rafa, and Cricket redoubts, which were connected by a &quot;series of trench lines several layers thick, and backed by other trenches and strong points&quot; stretching along the seaward defences to the west of Umbrella Hill. The attack on El Arish redoubt was to be supported by two of the six available tanks of the Palestine Tank Detachment&#x27;s eight tanks.

The 1/4th Battalion, Royal Scots (156th Brigade) assault on El Arish Redoubt was carried out in waves through the Ottoman trenches, during which six Ottoman mines exploded, causing EEF casualties. The Ottoman artillery, which had become active as a result of the first attack, had stopped shortly before the second attack began at 06:00 with an intense, ten-minute bombardment. At 06:30, a heavy Ottoman counterattack drove back the leading company of Royal Scots, causing a number of casualties. A platoon from another company helped rally the remnants of the leading company, which was reinforced by the 1/4th Battalion Royal Scots and 1/8th Battalion Scottish Rifles when the position was consolidated. Two tanks passed through El Arish Redoubt, but shortly afterwards one was abandoned and the other hit, while a third tank moved along the front line rolling out wire from Sea Post on the coast to Beach Post.

==== Phase three: coastal defences ====

When the Royal Scots had entered the eastern section of the El Arish Redoubt during the second phase of the attack, the western half was still held by Ottoman defenders. These defences became the objectives of the attacks by the 161st and 163rd Brigades of the 54th (East Anglian) Division, supported by four tanksincluding the two which had passed through the El Arish redoubt. On the right of the 163rd Brigade&#x27;s advance, the 1/5th Battalion, The Suffolk Regiment moved towards the Ottoman trenches following a creeping barrage to attack and over–run the western El Arish trenches during hand–to–hand fighting when the 1/5th Battalion, The Suffolk Regiment suffered light casualties. Although they had captured the third line, part of this captured territory had to be abandoned because it was exposed to hostile fire, so they consolidated their position along the second line. Half of the 1/8th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment attacked Burj Trench while the other half attacked Triangle Trench, although it was not their objective. This caused some confusion, and the 1/4th and 1/5th Battalions, The Norfolk Regiment lost direction in the dust and smoke of the cloudy, hazy night. As a result, only small numbers reached Gibraltar and Crested Rock, from where they were quickly forced to withdraw.

On the left, the attacks by the 161st Brigade were similarly weakened by loss of direction when the 1/5th Battalion, The Essex Regiment attacked Rafa Redoubt instead of Zowaiid trench. However, the 1/6th Battalion, The Essex Regiment attacked and captured Beach and Sea Posts before attacking the Rafa Redoubt and trench systems, suffering light casualties. In support, a tank rolled out wire as it drove along the front line from Sea Post to Beach Post. Cricket Redoubt was captured with the help of the tank from Beach Post; although the tank was temporarily disabled in the process. After being repaired, the tank was transporting some engineers&#x27; stores to Sheikh Hasan when it was hit and disabled again. Two reserve tanks were ordered forward carrying engineers&#x27; storesincluding sandbags which were set on fire by hostile fire.

==== Phase four: 2 November ====
On their right, the 1/10th Battalion, London Regiment (161st Brigade) finished capturing and consolidating the Rafa redoubt, which had only been partly captured by the 1/6th Battalion, The Essex Regiment. Without the assistance of tanks which had been put out of action, this battalion lost contact with the barrage and suffered heavy losses. Nevertheless, they captured Gun Hill and by 06:00 on 2 November they were preparing to attack Sheikh Hasan, which they captured fifteen minutes later along with 182 prisoners.

Lion Trench, north-east of Sheikh Hasan, was attacked at 07:30 by the 1/4th Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment (162nd Brigade) with the objective of clearing a gap through which the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade could advance. However, 20 minutes after their successful attack, the Northamptonshire without artillery support were almost surrounded and forced to retreat to Sheikh Hasan on the coast. Here a strong counterattack was threatened by two regiments of reinforcements from the Ottoman 7th Division, which were advancing from Deir Sneid to the north and north-east. (See Falls Map 6 Coastal sector) These Ottoman reinforcements were stopped by accurate shelling by the Corps Heavy Artillery, which fired on a line previously registered and by shelling from the monitors off the coast. A planned repeat of the Lion Trench attack was postponed when the 1/4th Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment attacked Yunis Trench instead. Although they captured the trench they were driven back by a counterattack. Throughout the remainder of the day, Ottoman heavy batteries shelled Sheikh Hasan, before the batteries were withdrawn during the night to the north-east of Gaza. During the night of 2/3 November, Ottoman troops strengthened their defences on Turtle Hill, facing Sheikh Hasan.

The Third Battle of Gaza was never intended to capture the town, but to keep the garrison in place after the capture of Beersheba. Only the first line of Ottoman trenches had been the objectives of the XXI Corps, which used new infantry tactics, tanks and massed artillery organised in accordance with Western Front standards. Although all objectives had not been won, the operations had forced two regiments of the Ottoman 7th Division reserve to move away from Hareira and Sheria, forward to strengthen the Ottoman defences between Gaza and the sea. According to the British official historian, &quot;The attack on the western defences of Gaza ... had fulfilled the Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s object.&quot; The EEF had also inflicted severe losses on the Ottoman defenders; more than one thousand of whom the EEF buried in the captured trenches. The EEF captured twenty-eight officers, 418 soldiers, twenty-nine machine guns and seven trench mortars. During the fighting, the corps infantry had advanced about on a front, and held their gains against repeated Ottoman counterattacks, although the attempt to create a gap for the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade to ride through was not successful. The front line defensive system on the south–west side of Gaza had been captured and the infantry occupied a position from which they could threaten &quot;Ali Muntar and the rest of the defences in front of the town.&quot; The XXI Corps suffered 350 killed, 350 missing and two thousand wounded during this fighting. Many casualties were blamed on loss of direction and crowding in the captured trenches, which were too shallow.

=== Air raids ===
Air raids by the EEF were carried out during the night of 1/2 November, with twelve bombs being dropped on Gaza, and on 3 and 4 November, with air raids over the hills north of Beersheba.

== Aftermath ==
=== 3–6 November ===
During a Khamsin on 3 November while the bombardment of Gaza resumed, the 1/4th Battalion The Essex Regiment (161st Brigade, 54th Division, XXI Corps) attacked and captured Yunis trench at 04:30. However, they were heavily counterattacked and forced to withdraw. The following night, several strong Ottoman counterattacks were made on the 75th Division&#x27;s position at Sheikh Abbas on the eastern side of Gaza, which were all stopped by machine gun and rifle fire. Meanwhile, the newly won position at Sheikh Hasan on the Ottoman right flank was consolidated.

By 5 November 1917, the Ottoman XXII Corps commander in charge of the defence of Gaza, Colonel Refet Bele, was continuing to maintain the &quot;integrity of the Gaza fortress&quot;, despite the Gaza garrison&#x27;s artillery batteries having only about 300 shells left. These batteries had also been suffering from effective counter-battery fire from the EEF Heavy Artillery Groups. Refet had been warned the day before that evacuation may be necessary because of the loss of Beersheba, so plans were prepared for the complete withdrawal from the town during the night of 6/7 November, to a new defensive line on the Wadi Hesi. Falkenhayn commanding Yildirim Army Group realised that the Ottoman forces could not hold the EEF any longer, and he ordered the Eighth and Seventh Armies to withdraw about . The first indications of the withdrawal were seen by EEF aerial reconnaissance, which reported Ottoman hospitals being moved back towards Mejdel. At midnight on 6/7 November, XXI Corps infantry patrols found Gaza had been evacuated by the Ottoman defenders. Until 6 November, German aircraft had rarely been seen over the Gaza lines, but that afternoon two R.E.8s and two B.E.12.as from No. 1 Squadron AFC patrolling and taking photographs were attacked and badly damaged by four Albatros aircraft.

Meanwhile, the heavy EEF bombardment of the Ottoman line in the XXI Corps area at Gaza, which had resumed on 3 November, grew in intensity with the naval guns joining in on 5 and 6 November, and it reached its maximum intensity on 6 November. During the night of 6/7 November the XXI Corps was to launch an attack on Outpost Hill and the Yunus and Belah trench systems, after the main EEF attack on Hareira and Sheria began. This attack on the Wadi esh Sheria was to be &quot;carried out in the most favourable circumstances&quot; against only two Ottoman regiments holding the line.

After launching the successful attack on 6 November against Hareira, the Sheria trenches were also attacked late in the day. These attacks were supported by renewed attacks in the Tel el Khuweilfe area at the eastern extremity of the Ottoman front line. During these attacks, the whole of the Kawukah trenches and part of the Rushdi system which protected Hareira Redoubt, were captured and the Ottoman defenders were forced to withdraw to the Hareira Redoubt. Late in the day a large part of the Sheria defences were also captured after Hareira was bypassed. Only Tel esh Sheria blocked the British advance and Allenby ordered the next day&#x27;s attacks to continue on Tel esh Sheria, and to be renewed at Gaza. While these attacks took place on 6 November, EEF aircraft bombed Gaza, the main Ottoman positions behind the Kauwukah defences near Um Ameidat, and positions west of Sheria. Three air combats were also fought against three hostile aircraft during the day. Mejdel was also bombed by EEF aircraft. Allenby wrote:

=== 7 November ===
==== Occupation of Gaza ====

The EEF&#x27;s occupation of Gaza, which had a pre-war population of approximately 40,000, was not strongly resisted and a general advance during the morning of 7 November found the town abandoned. Orders for an attack at 04:50 by the 75th Division on Outpost Hill on the eastern side of Gaza had been issued; these were expanded to include Middlesex Hill and a 54th (East Anglian) Division attack on the Belah and Yunis trenches, and Turtle Hill in the coastal sector. However, by 04:35, two battalions each from the 161st and the 162nd Brigades (54th Division) supported by artillery had already advanced to occupy Lion and Tiger Trenches and Sheikh Redwan in the coastal sector to the north-north-west of Gaza. The advance by the 162nd Brigade took them through &quot;the gardens and fields of Gaza to the main road northwards&quot;, when patrols sent into the city found it deserted; EEF artillery bombardments of Gaza had severely damaged or destroyed the majority of the city&#x27;s housing. The 54th (East Anglian) Division subsequently took up a line stretching from the Jaffa road north of Sheikh Redwan to the Mediterranean sea.

When the Ottoman withdrawal became apparent on 7 November, the Royal Flying Corpswhich had been mainly involved in strategic reconnaissance for the 40th (Army) Wing, artillery registration and tactical photography for the 5th (Corps) Wingbegan bombing and machine gun air raids. For seven days, they also made numerous air attacks on Ottoman infrastructure including aerodromes, transport, artillery, and retreating columns.

==== Mounted breakthrough ====

The 75th Division (XXI Corps) with the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade attached had been ordered to attack Outpost Hill on the eastern side of Gaza, and exploit any potential breakthrough. By 01:00 on 7 November, the 233rd Brigade (75th Division) had already occupied Outpost Hill, and as the brigade moved forward to occupy Green Hill and the Labyrinth at 05:00, they were only opposed by individual riflemen. By 07:00, the 233rd Brigade had patrols on Ali Muntar ridge, while on their right, the 234th Brigade found that the Beer trenches and Road Redoubt defending the Gaza to Beersheba road were still held in strength with machine guns. Throughout the day the Ottoman rearguards in Tank and Atawineh Redoubts continued to fire their artillery at the increasing numbers of EEF troops advancing behind both these Ottoman rearguard&#x27;s flanks. However, by nightfall, the Beer trenches, and the Road and Tank Redoubts had been captured.

The Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade, which had been carrying out patrolling duties based at Tel el Jemmi, was ready to exploit a breakthrough at Gaza, and the Anzac and Australian Mounted Divisions were also prepared for a pursuit through a breach in the line at Sheria. At 09:00, the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade rode through the ruins of Gaza to reach Beit Hanun at 13:00, where they encountered part of the Gaza garrison defending a strong rearguard position on a ridge south-east of Beit Hanun.

The Hyderabad and Mysore Lancers had advanced through Jebaliya to link with the Glasgow, Lancashire, and Hertfordshire squadrons of the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment, holding the high ground at Beit Lahl north of Gaza, where they threatened the Ottoman flank. While the Corps Cavalry Regiment captured Beit Lahia, the Hyderabad Lancers advanced at 15:00 to capture the ridge west of Beit Hanun at Sheikh Munam, but the village was strongly defended by numerous Ottoman machine gun detachments. Early in the afternoon, a regiment of the 4th Light Horse Brigade rode across to the north-west to link with the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade, which had been out of contact with the XX Corps and the Desert Mounted Corps. The 12th Light Horse Regiment (4th Light Horse Brigade) met up with the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade east of Beit Hanun at 14:45. Here they delivered orders for the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade to attack the Ottoman rearguard on the Wadi el Hesi near Tumra to the north of Beit Hanun. (See sketch map showing the advance by the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade and the 52nd (Lowland) Division on 7 November 1917). By 16:55, the rearguard was reported to still be holding Beit Hanun, with concentrations of Ottoman forces at Al Majdal (also known as el Mejdel and Ashkelon) and Beit Duras.

The lancers advanced from the east onto the ridge overlooking Beit Hanun, and despite meeting considerable resistance, captured the position. In the process, they secured twenty-three prisoners, some artillery pieces and a large quantity of ammunition. They also captured the town&#x27;s water pumping machinery intact, but were forced to withdraw back to Jebaliye for water as the equipment ran on gas made from charcoal, which had to be converted before it could be used.

==== Infantry pursuit ====

While the 52nd (Lowland) Division was ordered by the XXI Corps to take up a line from the Jaffa road north of Sheikh Radwan to the sea on the northern outskirts of Gaza, the 157th Brigade (52nd Division) began the infantry pursuit by advancing along the shore, reaching Sheikh Hasan by 12:15. By 16:00, these troops were seen marching along the coast towards the mouth of the Wadi Hesithe nearest likely defensive line north of Gaza. By dusk, the 157th Brigade had reached and crossed the Wadi el Hesi near its mouth north of Gaza while the remainder of the XXI Corps occupied Gaza. Although dumps of rations, ammunition and engineer stores had been formed in concealed positions in the XXI Corps area before the battle, the corps was not in a position to move any distance. Almost all of their transport except ammunition tractors had been transferred to the XX Corps and the Desert Mounted Corps for their attack at the Battle of Beersheba.

=== 8 November ===
By the evening of 8 November, all the Ottoman positions of the Gaza to Beersheba line had been captured and the Eighth Army was in full retreat. In conjunction with the captures in the centre of the line at Sheria, the occupation of Gaza enabled a swift direct advance northwards, preventing a strong consolidation of the Wadi Hesi rearguard position. However, the Ottoman XXII Corps was not defeated at Gaza, but conducted a skillful, tactical retreat from the town, demonstrating both operational and tactical mobility. Late in the afternoon of 8 November, twenty-eight British and Australian aircraft flew over Huj, the headquarters of the Ottoman force, targeting German and Ottoman aerodromes, railway junctions, dumps, and troops in close formation with bombs and machine guns. Arak el Menshiye was raided twice during the day with two hundred bombs dropped, forty-eight hit ten hostile aircraft still on the ground. The next day, Et Tine was bombed, with at least nine hostile aircraft damaged. Virtually continual aerial attacks were made on railway stations, troops on the march and transport, while a German aircraft was shot down in flames near the Wadi Hesi.

<doc id="501632" wikidata="Q698818" url="?curid=501632" title="Sweetheart cake">
<text>A sweetheart cake or wife cake or marriage pie is a traditional Chinese cake with a thin crust of flaky pastry, made with a filling of winter melon, almond paste, and sesame, and spiced with five spice powder.
&quot;Wife cake&quot; is the translation of 老婆饼 from Chinese, and although the meaning is &quot;wife&quot;, the literal translation is &quot;old lady cake&quot;, paralleling the colloquial usage of &quot;old lady&quot; for &quot;wife&quot; in English. In Hong Kong, it is known as a specialty of the Yuen Long District.

==Variants==
The traditional variant is from Guangdong province, where the filling consists of candied wintermelon. The candied wintermelon mash is then combined with white sesame seeds and glutinous rice flour. Coconut in the form of mash or desiccated shreds and almond paste, as well as vanilla, are also sometimes added. The paste is encased in Cantonese-style pastry dough; the authentic flavour and flaky texture of the pastry is traditionally produced by using pork lard shortening, and glazing with egg wash. Due to its rising popularity in Western countries, brought about by immigration, butter is sometimes substituted in place of lard, though this will alter the taste. The level of sweetness is mild, compared to Western sweet pastries.

Southeast Asian variations can include spices such as Chinese five spice (五香粉). Although this spice is of Chinese origin, it was not traditionally used in sweetheart cakes. Sweetheart cake may be confused with the husband cake (老公饼 or Lao gong bing), which uses star anise in its filling.

==Legends of origin==
There are many legends that attempt to explain the origins of the sweetheart cake. One tells the tale of a couple that lived a very poor life in imperial China. They loved each other and lived in a small village. Suddenly, a mysterious disease spread and the husband&#x27;s father became very sick. The couple spent all of their money in order to treat the man&#x27;s father. The wife sold herself as a slave in exchange for money to buy medicine for her father-in-law. Once the husband learned about what his wife did, he made a cake filled with sweetened wintermelon and almond. He dedicated this pastry to his wife whom he could never forget, and sold it on the street. His cake became so popular that he was able to earn enough money to buy his wife back.

There is another version where the man went searching for his wife after he earned enough money to buy her back. In his search, he had a cup of tea at a local teahouse, when he suddenly recognised the pastry they were serving with the tea. The man and his wife were reunited at the teahouse.

Another story tells of a dim sum chef&#x27;s wife creating a pastry with wintermelon paste influenced by a recipe from her mother&#x27;s family. The new pastry was found to taste better than the dim sums that were being sold in teahouses, and the chef proudly told everyone it was made by his wife, hence it was named &quot;Wife Cake&quot;.

<text>The Unix wars were struggles between vendors to set a standard for the Unix operating system in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

==Origins==
Both AT&amp;T Corporation and University of California, Berkeley are important in the early history of Unix. Although AT&amp;T&#x27;s Bell Labs created Unix, by the 1980s, Berkeley&#x27;s Computer Systems Research Group was the leading non-commercial Unix developer. In the mid-1980s, the three common versions of Unix were AT&amp;T&#x27;s System III, the basis of Microsoft&#x27;s Xenix and the IBM-endorsed PC/IX, among others; AT&amp;T&#x27;s System V, which it sought to establish as the new Unix standard; and the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). All were derived from AT&amp;T&#x27;s Research Unix but had diverged considerably. Further, each vendor&#x27;s version of Unix was different to some degree.

For example, at a mid-1980s Usenix conference, many AT&amp;T staff had buttons that read &quot;System V: Consider it Standard&quot; and a number of major vendors were promoting products based on System V. On the other hand, System V did not yet have TCP/IP networking built-in, while BSD 4.2 did; vendors of engineering workstations were nearly all using BSD, and posters reading &quot;4.2 &gt; V&quot; were available.

Several vendors formed the X/Open standards group in 1984 to promote compatible open systems, and they chose to base their system on Unix. X/Open caught AT&amp;T&#x27;s attention. To increase the uniformity of Unix, AT&amp;T and leading BSD Unix vendor Sun Microsystems started work in 1987 on a unified system. (The feasibility of this had been demonstrated a few years earlier by the US Army Ballistic Research Laboratory&#x27;s System V environment for BSD Unix.) This was released in 1988 as System V Release 4 (SVR4) which still lives to this day through its derivative OpenIndiana.

While this decision was applauded by customers and the trade press, certain other Unix licensees feared Sun would be unduly advantaged. They formed the Open Software Foundation (OSF) in 1988. The same year, AT&amp;T and another group of licensees responded by forming Unix International (UI). Technical issues soon took a back seat to vicious and public commercial competition between the two &quot;open&quot; versions of Unix, with X/Open holding the middle ground.

A 1990 study of various Unix versions&#x27; reliability found that in each version, between a quarter and a third of operating system utilities could be made to crash by fuzzing; the researchers attributed this, in part, to the &quot;race for features, power, and performance&quot; resulting from BSD–System V rivalry, which left developers little time to worry about reliability.

==Standardization==
The 1988 POSIX standard initially concentrated on system C library functions beyond what was included in the forthcoming C standard; later it expanded to specify other aspects of the system environment. POSIX specified a &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; that could be met by both System V and BSD-based variants, as well as some non-Unix systems, with a reasonable amount of effort.

In March 1993, the major participants in UI and OSF formed the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) alliance, effectively marking the end of the most significant era of the Unix wars. In June, AT&amp;T sold its Unix assets to Novell, and in October Novell transferred the Unix brand to X/Open.

In 1996, X/Open and the new OSF merged to form the Open Group. COSE work such as the Single UNIX Specification, the current standard for branded Unix, is now the responsibility of the Open Group, which also controls the current POSIX standards.

Since then, occasional bursts of Unix factionalism have broken out, such as the HP/SCO &quot;3DA&quot; alliance in 1995, and Project Monterey in 1998, a teaming of IBM, SCO, Sequent, and Intel which was followed by litigation (SCO v. IBM) between IBM and the new SCO, formerly Caldera.

==BSD and the rise of Linux==
BSD worked to purge copyrighted AT&amp;T code from their version between 1989 and 1994. During this time, various open-source BSD x86 derivatives took shape, starting with 386BSD, which was soon succeeded by FreeBSD and NetBSD. OpenBSD emerged in 1995 as a fork of NetBSD, and DragonFly BSD as a fork from FreeBSD in 2003. Mac OS X v10.5 is the first operating system with open source BSD code to be certified as fully Unix compliant. BSD systems can claim direct ancestry from Version 7 Unix. According to Open Source advocate Eric Raymond, BSD systems can be considered &quot;genetic Unix&quot;, if not &quot;trademark Unix&quot;.

During BSD&#x27;s period of legal turmoil (1992–94), the nearly-complete GNU operating system was made operational by the inclusion of the Linux kernel and lumped together under the label &quot;Linux&quot;. GNU had been written from scratch to avoid copyright issues. Linux systems broadly aim for compatibility with POSIX.

<text>Diffa is a city and Urban Commune in the extreme southeast of Niger, near the border with Nigeria. It is the administrative seat of both Diffa Region, and the smaller Diffa Department. , the commune had a total population of 56,437 people.

==History==
In 2002, it was the centre of the first military uprising in the country since President Tandja Mamadou instituted civilian rule; the uprising led to a government crackdown against the civilian press.

=== Nigerian refugees ===
In recent years, refugees from Nigeria fleeing violence from Boko Haram have settled in Diffa and surrounding area.

==Geography==

Diffa is situated on the north bank of the Komadougou Yobe river; the river&#x27;s seasonal floodplain lies immediately to the south and east. Much of the riverbank is lined with gardens and small allotments which grow the town&#x27;s well-known red peppers. The town is bisected in an arc by the Route Nationale 1 road; the eastern part of town is centred on the &quot;Grand Marché&quot;, which also acts as the transport hub for the city.

===Climate===
Diffa has a hot climate with a wet and dry season. On 7 September 1978, Diffa recorded a temperature of , which is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Niger.

==Architecture==
===Sports buildings===

A traditional wrestling arena is located to the northeast of the &quot;Grand Marché&quot;. Diffa Stadium can be found west of the RN1.

===Religious buildings===
The town contains several mosques, most notably the Grande Mosquée de Diffa on the RN1.

==Transport==
Diffa marks the eastern end of the paved section of Route Nationale 1, the main east-west highway across Niger, although the section between Zinder and Diffa is only partially paved in places. RN1 continues north to N&#x27;guigmi more than 100 km. Maïné-Soroa, the other major town of the Region, lies less than 100 km to the west of Diffa. The border with Nigeria, at the Nigerian town of Duji, is 5.5 km to the south of Diffa. Diffa Airport lies to the north of the town.

<text>Frank Brian Fargo (born December 15, 1962) is an American video game designer, producer, programmer and executive, and founder of Interplay Entertainment, inXile Entertainment and Robot Cache.

In 2009, he was chosen by IGN as one of the top 100 game creators of all time.

==Biography==

===Early life===
A descendant of the family that created the banking giants Wells Fargo and American Express, Fargo was born in Long Beach, California, and grew up in Whittier and Newport Beach. The only child of Frank Byron Fargo and Marie Curtis Fargo, he attended Corona del Mar High School, where he participated in track and field and developed a desire to create video games after his parents bought him an Apple II computer in 1977.

Brian Fargo wrote his first video game, &quot;Labyrinth of Martagon&quot;, with his friend Michael Cranford while still in high school. The team&#x27;s first widely distributed game was the graphical text adventure &quot;The Demon&#x27;s Forge&quot;, which Brian self-published and guerilla marketed in 1981 (and was later re-released by Boone Corporation). In 1982, 
&quot;Softline Magazine&quot; printed a letter from Fargo asking how On-Line Systems stored graphics in its graphic adventure &quot;The Wizard and the Princess&quot;. During this time period, he also wrote educational games for the &quot;World Book Encyclopedia&quot;.

===Interplay===
In 1983, Fargo founded Interplay Productions prior to landing his first contract in 1983 with Activision for &quot;Mindshadow&quot;, a graphical text adventure game for the Apple II and Commodore 64. After the release of &quot;Mindshadow&quot;, Fargo hired an old high school friend and started work to create a role-playing game &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; for the Apple II and C64 for a then-new publisher Electronic Arts. Fargo subsequently co-designed Interplay&#x27;s early RPGs, including the critically acclaimed &quot;Wasteland&quot;, where a character named Faran Brygo is a play on his name.

Interplay at the time was utilizing small development teams of one to three people to produce games for other companies to publish, which only allowed Interplay to break even at best. In 1988, Fargo decided to make the transition from a development house to a developer/publisher, adding the additional costs of production and marketing, with both the risk and possible reward of publishing successful games. The first title produced by Interplay in this era was the internally developed &quot;Battle Chess&quot;, followed by Quicksilver Software&#x27;s &quot;Castles&quot;. The company was also experimenting at the time with new ideas and products such as &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, a video game version of the novel by William Gibson.

By 1992, Interplay contracted with an old friend of Fargo&#x27;s, Allen Adham, and his partner, Michael Morhaime, to create &quot;RPM Racing&quot;. This was Adham and Morhaime&#x27;s first contract to produce a game as Silicon &amp; Synapse and was one of the first of such finds for Fargo, who had an eye for recognizing talent in small development teams. Adham and Morhaime eventually changed the name of their company to Blizzard Entertainment, future developer of the &quot;Warcraft&quot;, &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;Diablo&quot; franchises.

Interplay continued to expand in the mid-1990s, adding licensed titles to its own intellectual properties such as &quot;Stonekeep&quot;, by acquiring rights to the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; and creating a series of its adaptations. Fargo also continued to find talented small developers designing innovative games. One was Parallax Software, whose demo game eventually became the hit game &quot;Descent&quot;. Parallax, later renamed Volition, was eventually bought by THQ. In 1994, Universal/MCA bought a 45% stake in Interplay, which later went public in 1998.

Interplay grew to over 600 employees at its zenith in the mid-1990s. One of the most successful groups within Interplay was formed during this period, Black Isle. Black Isle focused on role-playing games and eventually included the games of a new developer called BioWare, which was initially contracted by Interplay to make &quot;Shattered Steel&quot;. The next game they developed for Interplay, through the Black Isle division, was &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, which proved to be a big hit, followed by others, such as &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; and the critically acclaimed &quot;&quot;.

In 1996, the company expanded again, adding a division focusing on sports games called VR Sports and buying Shiny Entertainment. Fargo&#x27;s goal in the acquisition of Shiny was to help Interplay transition into the console business, in addition to its successful PC game releases. That same year, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; ranked Fargo as the third most influential &quot;industry player&quot; of all time, as he &quot;has shown both brilliant product vision and great business talents.&quot;

In 1998, Interplay filed for an initial public offering (IPO) of stock to fund future development and retire debt the company held. At the time, the market for IPOs had started to slow from the boom years of the early and mid-1990s, yet the need for capital drove Fargo to file the offering. Increased competition, less than stellar returns on Interplay’s sports division and the lack of console titles forced the company to seek additional funding two years later with an investment from Titus Software, a Paris-based game company. In 1999, the relationship between Fargo and majority shareholder Titus deteriorated, according to Fargo, due to a &quot;different ideology of management&quot;. In 2000, Titus exercised a majority control of Interplay, and as a result, Fargo resigned his position with the company.

In addition to his work at Interplay, Fargo also formed an online entertainment company Engage! with partner SoftBank in 1996, and sat on the board of Virgin Europe in 1998.

===InXile Entertainment===
After leaving Interplay, Fargo looked to find outlets for his creative drive and founded inXile Entertainment in 2002, a video game developer and publisher that includes many former Interplay employees. The name inXile sprang from a joke for his post-Interplay career: initially, Fargo gave himself the title of &quot;leader-in-exile&quot; at the company.

InXile Entertainment released a new &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; as one of its first titles, released by Vivendi Universal Games, but has found success in a new category of downloadable games, such as &quot;Line Rider&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Contraption&quot;. The company also developed a major title for Bethesda Softworks, &quot;&quot;.

In 2012, inspired by the success of &quot;Double Fine Adventure&quot;″s fan funded model, Fargo announced that he was going to attempt to fan-fund &quot;Wasteland 2&quot; using the webservice Kickstarter. The project&#x27;s fundraising campaign reached its $900,000 funding goal in its second day and Fargo said hopes that all of his future projects involve Kickstarter as it &quot;offers all the freedoms that a developer hopes for.&quot; The &quot;Wasteland 2&quot; Kickstarter campaign ended on April 17, 2012, raising a total of $2,933,252, making it the third highest crowd funded video game on Kickstarter to date, with an additional $107,152 in PayPal pledges. The Kickstarter campaign was documented in the documentary, Capital C. 

On March 6, 2013, Fargo followed through on his promise to fund future projects through Kickstarter and launched &quot;&quot;, described as &quot;a story-driven CRPG crafted in the tradition of &quot;Planescape: Torment&quot; and set in the world of Monte Cook&#x27;s Numenera.&quot; The project reached its goal of $900,000 in just six hours and went on to break the Kickstarter record for fastest project to reach $1 million. The previous record had been held by the Ouya video game console which reached $1 million in 8 hours 22 minutes; &quot;Torment&quot; reached this amount in less than seven hours.

In May 2015 Fargo revealed The Bard&#x27;s Tale IV and his intentions to launch a Kickstarter for it on June 2, 2015. It is a direct continuation of that story from the previous The Bard&#x27;s Tale games. The Kickstarter concluded on July 10, 2015 with a final pledge total of $1,519,681 USD and 33,741 backers.

In March 2017, Fargo had announced his plans to retire from inXile following the release of &quot;Wasteland 3&quot;. However, in November 2018, Microsoft Studios announced their intention to buy inXile and make the studio a subsidiary. Because this would provide the studio with significantly more resources, Fargo stated he no longer plans to retire but instead will continue to lead the company.

===Robot Cache===
Fargo announced the founding of Robot Cache, a new digital games storefront for personal computer games expected to go live in Q2 2018. Robot Cache will deliver games via blockchains which can be decrypted or re-encrypted through the service; this will effectively allow players to buy and sell digital games without publishers fearing that the original owner can retain a copy after selling. This allows the service to ensure a higher percentage of each game sale goes back to the publisher; publishers are set to receive 95% of original game sales, and 70% of used game sales. While the site will accept normal forms of payment, it will also use a new cryptocurrency called Iron, which users will receive when reselling games and can be applied towards the purchase of new or used games.

===Others===
Fargo was a founder member of the board of advisors for Fig, a mixed investment/crowdfunding platform, since its launch in December 2015. As part of his involvement, he used Fig to crowdfund development of &quot;Wasteland 3&quot;. With inXile&#x27;s purchase by Microsoft Studios, Fargo plans to remain on the board to help determine which games that Fig should support, but otherwise does not plan to use Fig for funding.

<doc id="501660" wikidata="Q1392936" url="?curid=501660" title="A Dance to the Music of Time">
<text>A Dance to the Music of Time is a 12-volume &quot;roman-fleuve&quot; by English writer Anthony Powell, published between 1951 and 1975 to critical acclaim. The story is an often comic examination of movements and manners, power and passivity in English political, cultural and military life in the mid-20th century. The books were inspired by the painting of the same name by French artist Nicolas Poussin.

The sequence is narrated by Nicholas Jenkins. At the beginning of the first volume, Jenkins falls into a reverie while watching snow descending on a coal brazier. This reminds him of &quot;the ancient world—legionaries ... mountain altars ... centaurs ...&quot; These classical projections introduce the account of his schooldays, which opens &quot;A Question of Upbringing&quot;. Over the course of the following volumes, he recalls the people he met over the previous half a century and the events, often small, that reveal their characters. Jenkins&#x27;s personality is unfolded slowly, and often elliptically, over the course of the novels.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine included the novel in its list of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005. The editors of Modern Library ranked the work as 43rd-greatest English-language novel of the 20th century. The BBC ranked the novel 36th on its list of the 100 greatest British novels. In 2019 Christopher de Bellaigue wrote in &quot;The Nation&quot; that &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot; is &quot;perhaps the supreme London novel of the 20th century, an examination of the human behavior that defines the upper echelons of this brash, resilient, often pitiless place.&quot;

==Inspiration==

Jenkins reflects on the Poussin painting in the first two pages of &quot;A Question of Upbringing&quot;:

These classical projections, and something from the fire, suddenly suggested Poussin&#x27;s scene in which the Seasons, hand in hand and facing outward, tread in rhythm to the notes of the lyre that the winged and naked greybeard plays. The image of Time brought thoughts of mortality: of human beings, facing outward like the Seasons, moving hand in hand in intricate measure, stepping slowly, methodically sometimes a trifle awkwardly, in evolutions that take recognisable shape: or breaking into seemingly meaningless gyrations, while partners disappear only to reappear again, once more giving pattern to the spectacle: unable to control the melody, unable, perhaps, to control the steps of the dance.

Poussin&#x27;s painting is housed at the Wallace Collection in London.

==Analysis==
Its 12 novels have been acclaimed by such critics as A. N. Wilson and fellow writers including Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis as among the finest English fiction of the 20th century. Auberon Waugh dissented, calling it &quot;tedious and overpraised—particularly by literary hangers-on&quot;. The work was more heavily criticised towards the late 1960s, seen as being old-fashioned. Long-time friend V. S. Naipaul cast similar doubts regarding the work, if not the Powell &quot;oeuvre&quot;. Naipaul described his sentiments after a long-delayed review of Powell&#x27;s work following the author&#x27;s death this way: &quot;it may be that our friendship lasted all this time because I had not examined his work&quot;.

While the work is often compared to Proust, others find the comparison &quot;obvious, although superficial&quot;, with its narrator&#x27;s voice more like the participant-observer of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; than that of Proust&#x27;s self-regarding narrator. Two essays by Perry Anderson demonstrate significant differences between the two writers. The comparative analysis, &quot;A Dance to Lost Time: Marcel Proust&#x27;s &#x27;In Search of Lost Time&#x27; compared with Anthony Powell&#x27;s &#x27;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;&#x27; by Patrick Alexander explores the reception of the two.

Powell&#x27;s official biographer, Hilary Spurling, has published &quot;Invitation to the Dance – a Handbook to Anthony Powell&#x27;s A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;. This annotates, in dictionary form, the characters, events, art, music, and other references. She has also calculated the timeline employed by the author: this is used in the synopses linked from the novels below.

Bernard Stacey compiled a catalog and analysis of the poetic allusions in the novel.
The various aspects of the novel-sequence are also analysed in &quot;An Index to &#x27;A Dance to the Music of Time{{&#x27;}}&quot; by B. J. Moule, D. McLeod, and Robert L. Selig. Volumes 7-9, &quot;The War Trilogy,&quot; --&quot;The Valley of Bones&quot;, &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Art&quot; and &quot;The Military Philosophers&quot;—are the focus of Bernard Stacey&#x27;s &quot;War Dance.&quot;

==The novels==

Published dates are those of the first UK publication. The narrative is rarely specific about the years in which events take place. Those below are suggested by Hilary Spurling in &quot;Invitation to the Dance – a Handbook to Anthony Powell&#x27;s A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;. Dust jackets of the first editions were designed by James Broom-Lynne.

==Principal characters==

==Adaptations==
The cycle was adapted by Frederick Bradnum as a &quot;Classic Serial&quot; on BBC Radio 4.
In order to fit the material in, it was broadcast as four separate serials each based on a set of three books: the first three serials had six episodes, the last eight. The series were broadcast between 1979 and 1982. The cycle was adapted again as a six-part &quot;Classic Serial&quot; on BBC Radio 4 from 6 April to 11 May 2008, directed by John Taylor. The cycle was adapted as a four-part TV series &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot; by Anthony Powell and Hugh Whitemore for Channel 4 in 1997, directed by Christopher Morahan and Alvin Rakoff.{{Citation needed|date=June 2024}}

<text>Kimon Georgiev Stoyanov (; August 11, 1882 – September 28, 1969) was a Bulgarian general who was the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Bulgaria from 1934 to 1935 and again from 1944 to 1946. He was considered a &quot;master in the art of coup d&#x27;etats.&quot;

== Early life ==

=== Early life and education ===
Kimon Georgiev Stoyanov was born on 11 August 1882 in the town of Tatar Pazardzhik, then part of Eastern Rumelia, into a middle-class family. His paternal grandfather, called Stoyan Balkachiyata, moved to the town from the village of Debrashtitsa in the early 19th century. His father was Georgi Stoyanov Krustyov, born around 1848. His maternal grandfather was Todor Bogdanov, who came to Pazardzhik from the village of Kalugerovo. His mother was Maria Bogdanova-Abadzhieva, born around 1858. He had an older brother and sister, so he was the youngest child in his family. At the time, his father died of tuberculosis only three months after his birth.

He graduated primary education in Pazardzhik in 1897. He was firstly interested in engineering, but his family couldn&#x27;t afford to study abroad, so they later directed him into starting his military career, where he was accepted into the Military University in Sofia.

He graduated in 1902 and was promoted to second-lieutenant on 1 January 1902 at an official ceremony in the Tsar&#x27;s Palace. He was also a commander in the 3rd Reserve Regiment of the 2nd Infantry Thracian Division in Peshtera, then moved to Pazardzhik. There, he was promoted to lieutenant in 1905 and then commander.
=== Balkan Wars ===
On mobilization on the eve of the First Balkan War, Kimon Georgiev became commander of the 2nd Company of the 27th Chepinski Infantry Regiment in Pazardzhik, which was shortly afterwards transferred to the frontier at Ladzhene. The regiment was part of the Rhodope detachment commanded by General Stiliyan Kovachev and after the outbreak of the war in early October advanced westwards towards Mehomiya. Georgiev&#x27;s company was among the units that captured Predela and moved briefly into the Struma Valley, supporting the advance of the Seventh Rila Infantry Division, then returned via Bansko and continued south through Breznitsa, Nevrokop, Sadovo and Banitsa to Serres. From Serres, the Twenty-seventh Regiment advanced rapidly towards Salonika, but was halted after Xylopoli, as the Seventh Division and Greek troops were already in the city. He was then promoted to captain in 1913 and then appointed as a commander of an infantry regiment in Kardzhali.

=== World War I ===
During the mobilization when Bulgaria entered World War I, Kimon Georgiev became a company commander in the newly formed Forty-fourth Infantry Tundzhan Regiment and shortly after was appointed commander of its 2nd Troop. The regiment was part of the Second Infantry Thracian Division under the command of General Dimitar Geshov and fought on the Salonika front. Georgiev distinguished himself in the fighting at Kayali, where he would capture 316 British soldiers, in which became a major in 1916.

He participated in the Battle of the Crna Bend, where his detachment was in key positions at the village of Brod and the mouth of the Sakuleva River, which it occupied on 8 October. During the following days it was subjected to intense artillery shelling and repeated attacks by Entente forces, with Georgiev proving to be an effective field officer, holding off the enemy on the opposite bank of the Cherna. On 19 October, he lost one eye and severely wounded.

After recovering from his wound, Kimon Georgiev was appointed as an instructor and then as a member of the Ordnance Council at the headquarters of the army. On 27 February 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel. During demobilization after the Armistice of Salonica, he was transferred to the War Ministry, and from 26 October 1918 was head of the Inspectorate Section.

Kimon Georgiev became a member of the Military Union after the returning of headquarters of the army in Sofia and headed its organization for the Sofia garrison. He actively participated in the preparation of its Founding Congress, at which he was elected a member of the first Permanent Presence of the organization. On 2 November 1919, he was appointed commander of the sixth infantry regiment in Sofia.

Over 100 officers protested against the appointment of Gavril Lichev as head of the War Office on 9 September 1919. This action provoked a reaction from Prime Minister Aleksandar Stamboliyski, who also was Minister of War. The Supreme Military Council condemned the action and took measures to dissolute the Military Union. On the same day, Georgiev was appointed commander of the 39th regiment in Burgas on the pretext that he was unfit for enlistment. He went on leave, but the command wanted to remove him from Sofia and terminated his leave. On 12 October 1919, he submitted a request to be dismissed. On his dismissal from the army, he was promoted to colonel. He left the military in 1920.

== Early political career ==

=== Military Union and People&#x27;s Alliance ===
The dismissal of Kimon Georgiev was followed by the purge of other key figures of the Union by the end of 1920. Despite the government&#x27;s measures, the Military Union was gradually restored with the active efforts of Nikola Rachev, Damyan Velchev and Kimon Georgiev - the structure of the organization in the army was reorganized, with fewer people involved in its activities, but under a tighter conspiracy.

His political career started in 1921, where he was one of the founders of the organization People&#x27;s Alliance and kept ties with the Military Union. He also participated in the negotiation ties between opposition parties to create the Constitutional Bloc in 1922.

=== 1923 coup d&#x27;état ===

He was one of the main leaders of the Military Union, which took participation in the 1923 coup d&#x27;état. He was also in the home of Ivan Rusev during the night of the coup. He was an active role in the unification of parties to create the Democratic Alliance. In October, he participated in the negotiations for the creation of an electoral coalition with the Bulgarian Workers&#x27; Social Democratic Party (broad socialists), and in the elections of 18 November he was elected deputy from the Sofia Rural Collegium.

In April 1925, Georgiev attended the funeral of retired General Konstantin Georgiev, a deputy and chairman of the Sofia organization of the Democratic Union and garrison leader of the Military Union, and was wounded in the St Nedelya Church assault. In an article dedicated to Nikola Rachev, who died in the blast, he called the bombers &quot;freaks&quot; preparing a &quot;death blow&quot; against Bulgaria. Later that year, he was sent to Pirin as a government representative during the Incident at Petrich.

=== Andrey Lyapchev&#x27;s cabinet ===
At the end of 1925 Kimon Georgiev actively participated in the events that led to the fall of Aleksander Tsankov. He was one of the activists of the People&#x27;s Congress who at that time advocated changes in the cabinet, and was charged by the leadership of the Democratic Congress to present its decision in this direction to Tsankov. Discussed as a possible interior minister in a new cabinet, on 4 January 1926 he became Minister of Railways, Posts and Telegraphs in Andrey Lyapchev&#x27;s first cabinet.

After leaving the cabinet, Georgiev was among the members of the internal opposition in the Sgora, grouped around the newspaper &quot;Luch&quot; edited by Petar Todorov, which is why its representatives are often called racists. They advocate stronger state intervention in the economy, limiting partisan appointments in the administration and active action against IMRO. In response, Lyapchev made some concessions, such as the removal of war minister Ivan Valkov. A split occurred within the Radiationist group itself in 1930, when three of its members, including Aleksander Tsankov, were given cabinet seats, and the more extreme opponents, led by Kimon Georgiev, continued to criticize the government. In September, Georgiev himself sharply attacked the war minister in parliament over the Spy Affair. In November, a final rift between the two groups occurred, with the extreme opposition increasingly distancing itself from the Democratic Alliance, consolidating around the Political Circle &quot;Zveno&quot;.

=== Zveno ===
Kimon Georgiev established the political circle &quot;Zveno&quot; with Damyan Velchev in 1927, firstly as a non-partisan organization that aims to improve the socio-political climate in the country. It proclaimed its support for authoritarian power, raised above the strictly party interests, with national purpose. The fascists influence on the Zveno is undisputed, but its not characterized as fascist, but a corporate statism in which it mainly drew inspiration from Italian fascism. Georgiev ceased ties with the Democratic Alliance in 1930 and after the 1931 Bulgarian parliamentary election, he was no longer a deputy of his group. He became a leader of the Zveno and in the beginning of 1932, a newspaper &quot;Izgrev&quot; was published with one of the editors being Georgiev himself. He published articles in which he criticized communism and the Soviet Union, as well as declaring for a strong government &quot;in the name of order and state intervention in economic life.&quot; The primary component of Zveno&#x27;s ideology was anti-communism, which embraced strong &quot;supra-party&quot; authoritarian bourgeois power of the fascist variety while rejecting the bourgeois democratic system of governance. The bulk of Zveno members joined Aleksander Tsankov&#x27;s Popular Social Movement in January 1934, but a smaller group led by Kimon Georgiev kept the group operating independently. Zveno was a little organization with little social interaction. It made touch with the Military League, which was once more planning a violent change of government.

=== 1934 coup d&#x27;état ===
The 1934 coup d&#x27;état was executed by the Military Union and the Zveno, who removed Nikola Mushanov from power. It reflected the authoritarian trend in Europe. In this coup, Kimon Georgiev played an important role. At a meeting of the Union&#x27;s Central Government, held at the house of Kimon Georgiev, it was decided to stage a coup on 19 May. Damyan Velchev and Kimon Georgiev were at the head of the coup.

== Three terms as prime minister ==
=== First Georgiev Cabinet ===

Kimon Georgiev became prime minister on 19 May 1934, after the coup d&#x27;état. He served as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Religious Affairs (19-23 May 1934) and Minister of Justice (23 May 1934 – 22 January 1935) and temporarily served as Minister of War on 19 May 1934. Kimon Georgiev led the new Cabinet, which was primarily made up of Zveno and Military League representatives. Although they denounced the coup, the other bourgeois parties and the non-fascist bourgeois parties accepted it. The BCP called it a fascist coup, but they were unable to put up a united front to fight it due to mistakes in secretarian doctrine. The coup&#x27;s perpetrators said in their manifesto that a &quot;national supra-party power&quot; would be established. They abolished the Parliament, dissolved the IMRO, and restructured the governmental apparatus on a fascist basis.

The government dissolved the National Assembly in its first days and the cabinet ruled by ordinance-laws signed by the tsar, invoking Article 47 of the Tarnovo Constitution. On 14 June political parties and trade unions were banned and their property was nationalised. Counties and municipalities were clustered, their self-government abolished and replaced by government-appointed officials. Stricter qualification criteria for teachers were introduced, dozens of schools were closed and over 2,000 teachers were left unemployed. A campaign was organized to replace the traditional names of many villages in the country with Bulgarian ones. Strict censorship was introduced and many printed publications were banned. In order to increase state revenues and subsidize agriculture, the government established state monopolies in the grain, alcohol, and tobacco trades, severely disrupting activity in these sectors. Up to 40% of debts that were difficult to service after the Great Depression were cancelled, the rest were rescheduled, and enforcement measures were limited. Several distressed private banks were consolidated and reactivated with state capital to form the Bulgarian Credit Bank. The two large state-owned banks were also merged into the Bulgarian Agricultural and Cooperative Bank. A Public Assistance Service was established under the Ministry of the Interior, financed by a special tax, and free treatment of the poor in public hospitals was introduced. On 4 September, a Decree-Law on the Safety of the State was issued, practically outlawing the IMRO and assigning the investigation of its activities to the military courts, the police and the army. Mass arrests of IMRO activists and confiscations of weapons and property began. Over the next two years, the Sofia Military Field Court dealt with dozens of cases of murders, kidnappings and racketeering committed by IMRO activists in southwestern Bulgaria. Numerous heavy sentences were handed down, including 21 death sentences against the organization&#x27;s leader, Ivan Mihailov.

The government made changes in foreign policy, in which it advocated continuity with the previous cabinets, strengthening good relations with neighbouring countries, which had concluded the Balkan Pact at the beginning of the year. The goal of the new government was to completely &quot;renovate&quot; the Bulgarian parliamentary system and change the country&#x27;s foreign policy. It released the following declaration on foreign policy: &quot;Reestablishment of our relations with Soviet Russia; peace and good relations with all the Great Powers and especially with our neighbors.&quot; The government&#x27;s readiness to disband the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) was demonstrated by its proclamation of the &quot;reéstablishment of the public authority over the entire extent of the territory.&quot; In fact, it moved right away to restructure the local administration into seven departments, each headed by a governor with extensive powers. Naturally, the Petrich district—which the Macedonian revolutionaries had previously controlled—was one of them. With Yugoslavia a trade treaty was made and at the end of September, Alexander I made a visit to Sofia in which he was welcomed by thousands of people. Kimon intensified negotiations with the Soviet Union initiated by the previous cabinet and in July 1934, the first diplomatic relations were made between the two countries. In the autumn of 1934, a pro-monarchist wing led by Pencho Zlatev and a pro-republican wing led by Damyan Velchev took shape in the ruling circles of the Zveno and Military Union. Kimon Georgiev began measures to remove Zlatev from his War Office, but its unsuccessful, due to the leadership of the Military Union resisting. Damyan Velchev remained in isolation after the Union&#x27;s Congress in November with the organization rejecting much of the cabinet&#x27;s policies. On 22 January 1935, Boris III executed a counter-coup to strength his role in Bulgarian politics, in which Georgiev resigned and Pencho Zlatev took control as a pro-monarchist. Kimon Georgiev was given a chance to be Minister of Justice, but declined.
=== The end of the 30s ===
Kimon Georgiev was put under police surveillance after the removal from premiership in which he fell into political isolation. He still maintained active contacts of Damyan Velchev, members of the Zveno and foreign diplomats and journalists, including Soviet ambassador Fyodor Raskolnikov.

He gave an interview to the Yugoslav newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; in which he rejected the new government&#x27;s accusations against him and criticized it. The previous day, Aleksandar Tsankov was given a similar interview. On 18 April 1935, he was interned St. Anastasia Island. Many ministers resigned, in which the Military Union was stripped from leadership and a cabinet headed by Andrey Toshev was formed. The new government began measures to neutralize radical circles within the Military Union, which forced Kimon Georgiev to leave Sofia for Burgas. He was arrested on 2 October in Yambol due to Velchev&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état attempt. On 14 October, he was released but only after 3 days he was briefly arrest, but after no evidence founded of him participating in the plot, he was interned in Burgas. During the trial of Damyan Velchev, he was active in his support and during his time in prison, Georgiev was his legal guardian. Zveno became more closer to the left wing opposition, which is the BZNS and Bulgarian Communist Party. Georgiev was constantly monitored by State Security, however he was not completely isolated from ruling circles and public events.

After the parliament was formed, it had to approve the post-coup ordinance-laws, and during the debates the opposition, and especially Dimitar Gichev, harshly criticized Zveno, the Military Union, and Kimon Georgiev personally for their actions after the coup. He attempted to defend himself with the pamphlet &quot;My Program&quot;, which was, however, seized by the authorities and Georgiev was put on trial, but the case was dropped in 1939. Although from 1936 Georgiev and Zveno advocated the restoration of the Tarnovo Constitution, they maintained their foreign policy line. In March 1939, he published the pamphlet A View of Our Foreign Policy Situation (the first book of the Brazdy Library), in which he acknowledged Bulgaria&#x27;s &quot;indisputable rights&quot;, but expressed fears of possible international isolation and advocated the preservation of the Bulgarian-Yugoslav Pact of 1937.

=== World War II ===
Immediately after the start of World War II, Kimon Georgiev sent a letter to Prime Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov, advocating rapprochement with the Soviet Union. During the changes in government in October 1939, Georgiev was received at a two-hour meeting by Tsar Boris III, with whom he discussed the political situation and tried unsuccessfully to secure the release of Damyan Velchev and the other convicted activists of the Military Union. In November 1940, Georgiev supported the Soviet proposal for a mutual aid pact. Apart from the old activists of Zveno, the proposal for the pact is supported only by the Communists, the BZNS-Pladne and some radicals. In January 1941, Kimon Georgiev was among the leaders of almost all the former parties who signed a joint request for an audience with the Tsar, insisting on the preservation of Bulgaria&#x27;s neutrality. He also expressed this position in a long letter to Prime Minister Bogdan Filov on 11 February, but shortly afterwards the country joined the Tripartite Pact and allowed German troops into Greece.

The anti-fascist Zveno members, especially its prominent representative Kimon Georgiev, were reached out to by the Bulgarian Communist Party, which began collaborating with them to free the nation from the fascist tyranny. With the founding of the Fatherland Front in 1942 at Georgi Dimitrov&#x27;s instigation, Kimon Georgiev and some of his supporters became members of the National Committee.

The Communists contacted Kimon Georgiev through Racho Angelov, which resulted in the circles around Zveno joining the Fatherland Front. Initially, its activity consisted mainly in maintaining contacts between the activists of the different organizations and issuing common documents, and dozens of committees were established throughout the country. On 10 August 1943, a National Committee of the OF was established, including Kiril Dramaliev, Nikola Petkov, Kimon Georgiev, Grigor Cheshmedzhev and Dimo Kazasov. After the death of Tsar Boris III on 28 August 1943, Kimon Georgiev was among the opposition politicians with whom Prime Minister Bogdan Filov held consultations about the emerging crisis. On 1 September, Georgiev was among the ten opposition figures who signed a joint declaration to implement the Tarnovo Constitution and convene a Grand National Assembly to elect regents. They saw the situation as an opportunity to change the country&#x27;s foreign policy course, but the government rejected their proposals.

In the autumn of 1943, the Fatherland Front suffered a severe crisis and was on the verge of splitting over the publication of its first official bulletin. Kimon Georgiev, actively supported by Nikola Petkov, drafted an article with the organization&#x27;s position on the Macedonian question, advocating the creation of a united and independent Macedonian state. The Communists tried not to take a public position on the issue, as the Soviet Union was committed to restoring pre-war borders, and Georgi Dimitrov did not rule out the possibility of a Balkan federation including Bulgaria. Georgiev&#x27;s main argument to the Communists was that without a clear position on the Macedonian question, Fatherland Front propaganda among the officers would be difficult. Eventually, in December, a compromise text was published avoiding the question of Macedonia&#x27;s return to Yugoslavia. At the beginning of 1944, Kimon Georgiev and Petko Stainov, a deputy close to Zveno, attempted to coordinate joint actions of the opposition parties, including those outside the Fatherland Front. Georgiev prepared an address to the government and parliament calling for the restoration of neutrality, the return of occupation troops from Yugoslavia and Greece to Bulgaria, and improved relations with the Soviet Union. It is to be discussed and signed by leaders of various opposition groups on 11 January, but heavy bombing the day before prevents the meeting and Kimon Georgiev sends the address on his own behalf.

After the bombing, Kimon Georgiev left with his family for Burgas, where he was placed under house arrest on 12 January. Initially living in his wife&#x27;s hereditary house, he was then moved under permanent police surveillance to his villa in a vineyard outside the city, where he remained until the end of August. In the spring of 1944, the Fatherland Front leadership considered forming a clandestine government for Bulgaria, and he agreed to head it, preparing to go underground, but the partisans&#x27; inability to secure relatively safe territory for the government prevented its establishment. From Burgas, Georgiev maintained active contacts with the capital Sofia, mainly through Hristo Stoykov. In April, he participated in a new appeal by opposition leaders to the regents and the prime minister to dissociate from Germany and change the government, also signed by Nikola Mushanov, Atanas Burov, Krustyo Pastukhov, Dimitar Gichev, Aleksander Girginov, Petko Stainov, Vergil Dimov, Nikola Petkov and Konstantin Muraviev. On 6 August, he participated in a meeting of a wide range of opposition leaders in Sofia - at his insistence, communists also participated - which adopted the so-called Declaration of the 13.

=== 1944 coup d&#x27;état ===
At the end of August, the parliament considered various options for forming a new government, including a Fatherland Front cabinet led by Kimon Georgiev. On 27 August he was sent with police guards to the regents in Chamkoria and they tried to persuade him to join a cabinet without the Communists, but Georgiev refused, after which he was released and returned to Sofia. On 30 August, he was among the 14 leaders of the Fatherland Front who issued a Manifesto to the Bulgarian People, the organization&#x27;s first public document signed by specific individuals.

In the following days, Kimon Georgiev&#x27;s house became the centre of the coup prepared by the Fatherland Front, visited daily by the leaders of the organisation. Damyan Velchev moved entirely into Georgiev&#x27;s home. On 6 September, a permanent armed guard of several partisans, headed by Ivan Bonev, was posted there. Following the failure of General Ivan Marinov&#x27;s attempt to peacefully change the government, a narrowed-down National Committee of the Fatherland Front decided to carry out a military coup at a meeting at the home of Kimon Georgiev on 7 September. At ten o&#x27;clock on the same day, a meeting of activists of the Military Union, led by Damyan Velchev, was held to coordinate the actions of the Union to carry out the coup. On the morning of 8 September, representatives of the Fatherland Front - Kimon Georgiev, Nikola Petkov, Dimitar Neykov, Kiril Dramaliev and Dimo Kazasov - met with the Prime Minister, protesting the dispersal of opposition demonstrations in the previous days and demanding that rallies be allowed in the major cities. Kimon Georgiev hosted a meeting of the Fatherland Front&#x27;s National Committee at 4 p.m. on 8 September. The government&#x27;s composition was settled upon, and its policy text is approved.

The composition of the future government and the new regents were specified at a meeting between Kimon Georgiev, Dobri Terpeshev, Nikola Petkov and Damyan Velchev at Georgiev&#x27;s home at 4 pm on 8 September. It was agreed that the cabinet would include four representatives each of the BRP, Zveno and BZNS-Pladne, two of the BRSD and two independents, and that the prime minister would be Kimon Georgiev, a decision agreed with Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. Georgiev spent the night of the coup with Damyan Velchev, Nikola Petkov, and Traicho Dobroslavsky at the home of Yanko Antonov near the Eagles Bridge - he was a neighbor of Peter Vranchev, in whose apartment the Communist leaders - Dobri Terpeshev, Anton Yugov, Georgi Chankov, Angel Tsanev, and Katya Avramova were at the time.

The coup began at 2 a.m. on 9 September with the seizure of the War Ministry building. War Minister Ivan Marinov sided with the coup and issued the appropriate orders to the First Infantry Division and the School for Reserve Officers. Within 4 hours, the main administrative and communication nodes in the capital were brought under control and the political leaders of the coup moved to the War Ministry. At 6:25 a.m., Kimon Georgiev read a short Proclamation to the Bulgarian people over the radio and announced the composition of the new government, approved a short time later by decree of the regents Prince Kiril and Nikola Mihov.

=== Second Georgiev Cabinet ===
The first step of the new government is to settle relations with the Soviet Union. On the evening of 9 September, a delegation including Dimitar Mikhalchev, Kiril Stanchev, Dimitar Ganev and Raicho Slavkov was sent to Marshal Fyodor Tolbukhin, commander of the Third Ukrainian Front, and at 10 p.m. Stalin issued an order to halt Soviet military action against Bulgaria. On 17 September, Kimon Georgiev announced the government&#x27;s program at a rally in the Palace of Justice.

Zveno officially resumed its activities on 18 September, and on 1 October a national conference was held, at which the organization was transformed into a political party, the People&#x27;s Union Zveno, and Kimon Georgiev became chairman of its Executive Bureau. Zveno began to establish its own structures throughout the country, expanding its base among the middle class, but at the local level it met with resistance from the communists - people from local organizations were arrested, extorted for money by the militia, not allowed to join the local structures of the Fatherland Front, and declared &quot;fascists.&quot;

The first months of the new government were accompanied by terror perpetrated by the communists controlling the interior and justice ministries. According to various estimates, between 2,000 and 30,000 people were killed by the end of November. In mid-November, the Council of Ministers publicly declared against the lynchings, but they were not stopped in practice. At the insistence of the Soviet Union, on 10 October the withdrawal of Bulgarian troops from the parts of Macedonia and Thrace that had been in Greece and Yugoslavia until the war began. On 28 October 1944, a delegation led by Foreign Minister Petko Staynov and including Ministers Nikola Petkov, Dobri Terpeshev and Petko Stoyanov signed an armistice with the Allies. Bulgaria was forced to accept harsh conditions - maintenance of the Soviet troops stationed in the country, placing the government under the control of the Allied Control Commission, and involvement in the hostilities against Germany.

On 3 December, at the suggestion of Damyan Velchev, the Council of Ministers passed a decree enabling the military officers charged under the People&#x27;s Court Act to go to the front and, if they showed bravery, be discharged. The next day the Communists declared the decree &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; and organised demonstrations against it, and on 6 December, at the insistence of the head of the Union Control Commission, Sergei Biryuzov, the decree was revoked. In the following days, Communists and Soviet officers headed the General Staff and its Intelligence Department, and held two deputy ministerial posts in the War Ministry.

On 26 January 1945, the Council of Ministers approved the &quot;Ordinance-Law for the Protection of People&#x27;s Power&quot;, which contained 18 articles - 5 of them providing for the death penalty and 4 for life imprisonment. In the following years, it became the basis for the prosecutions of the opposition and the officers during the imposition of the totalitarian regime in the country. Between 23 and 31 January, Kimon Georgiev visited Moscow, where he met Joseph Stalin and Georgi Dimitrov for the first time. The main purpose of the visit was the conclusion, with Soviet mediation, of an alliance treaty between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. Secret letters to the treaty envisaged the future creation of a federation, without specifying whether on an equal basis between the two countries, which Bulgaria insisted on, or by incorporating Bulgaria into Yugoslavia as a sixth republic, which was the Yugoslav position. The treaty was never concluded because of the opposition of the United Kingdom and the United States, who believed that Bulgaria could not act independently until a peace treaty was concluded.

On 9 February 1945, Kimon Georgiev gave a report on the government&#x27;s work to the First Congress of the Fatherland Front. Days after the first executions under the decision of the so-called People&#x27;s Court, he deplored the &quot;cases of self-destruction, arbitrariness and violence&quot; that had been allowed to take place, claimed that they had been curbed quickly, and expressed satisfaction at their being channeled through the People&#x27;s Court. He states that the constitution and &quot;the rights and liberties of the Bulgarian people&quot; have been restored, although the Council of Ministers rules by ordinance-laws and political organizations outside the Fatherland Front have not been legalized.

In the spring of 1945, tensions between communists and farmers in the Fatherland Front intensified and led to the split of the BZNS. The main part of the organization, headed by Nikola Petkov (BZNS - Nikola Petkov), went into opposition and was replaced in the government by representatives of the pro-communist wing (BZNS (Kazionen). In this environment, in June, Kimon Georgiev and Damyan Velchev met with Traicho Kostov and received assurances about the preservation of the Fatherland Front as a multi-party coalition, as well as for its own positions in the government. As a result, during the 1945 crisis, Zveno remained in the Fatherland Front, with Georgiev remaining fully loyal to the Communists and playing an important role in neutralizing opposition sentiment within Zveno itself. Georgiev&#x27;s government scheduled elections for 26 August 1945, despite the protests of the opposition, which had no right to exist legally. Bulgaria was under intense pressure from the United States and Britain to postpone the elections to allow them to be held freely, but the Communists firmly refused. Only a day before the date of the elections they were postponed until November on Stalin&#x27;s personal instructions. In the following weeks the opposition parties were legalised and martial law was lifted. At the elections held on 18 November, which were boycotted by the opposition, Kimon Georgiev was elected as a deputy in Burgas. In December, the United States and Britain made the inclusion of two opposition representatives in the Bulgarian government a condition for its recognition. On Stalin&#x27;s instructions on 5 January 1946, Kimon Georgiev, Damyan Velchev and Anton Yugov met with opposition leaders Nikola Petkov and Kosta Lulchev, but they flatly refused to enter the government, rejecting the legitimacy of the elections and demanding an end to the Communists&#x27; terror. On 7 January Georgiev was summoned to Stalin, who sharply criticised him for his soft attitude towards the opposition. On 10 January, Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Vyshinsky met with Petkov and Lulchev in Sofia, but they did not change their position.

=== Third Georgiev Cabinet ===

In March 1946, the government of Kimon Georgiev was reorganized—two ministries were added, the number of sub-chairmen was reduced, and there were personnel changes and changes in the proportions of the coalition parties. This was on the orders of Joseph Stalin, who criticised the Bulgarian communists for the slow imposition of the totalitarian regime in the country. He demanded the strengthening of the presence of the BPC and BZNS in the cabinet, the removal of the foreign minister Petko Staynov and a purge of the foreign ministry staff, and the replacement of the finance minister Stancho Cholakov. Despite the pressure against Zveno, Georgiev himself retained the confidence of Stalin and Georgi Dimitrov and remained at the head of the cabinet. Apart from being prime minister, he remained a minister without portfolio.

On Joseph Stalin&#x27;s direct instructions to Georgi Dimitrov, a purge in the army began in the summer of 1946, accompanied by public show trials against alleged officer organizations - &quot;Tsar Krum&quot;, &quot;Neutral Officer&quot; and others, as well as opposition leaders such as G. M. Dimitrov and Krustyo Pastukhov. These were coordinated with the parallel mounted trial in Yugoslavia against Draža Mihailović, during which Mihailović&#x27;s links with Bulgarian public figures such as G. М. Dimitrov, Asen Stamboliyski and the war minister Damyan Velchev. In this setting, Kimon Georgiev publicly spoke out in support of the Military Union and personally of Damyan Velchev, whom he called his &quot;closest and most inseparable personal friend, political associate and comrade in the cabinet&quot;. However, Georgiev already has limited influence in the government and pressure against Velchev was increasing. On 2 July the Communists passed for one day a law on control of the army, seizing powers from the war minister at the expense of the Council of Ministers. On 2 August, Kimon Georgiev agreed to the removal of his close associates Kiril Stanchev (arrested and convicted in a show trial) and Damyan Velchev (effectively replaced as minister by Krum Lekarski and interned).

From 11 August to 3 September, Kimon Georgiev was in Paris at the head of a Bulgarian delegation preparing the Paris Peace Treaty. There he met with various politicians, including the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, Vyacheslav Molotov, and the United States, James Byrnes. Bulgaria unsuccessfully insisted on being recognized as a country that had fought against Germany, but with the support of the Eastern Bloc countries, it managed to significantly reduce the reparations demanded by Greece. Upon his return to Bulgaria, Kimon Georgiev managed to personally solicit protections for Damyan Velchev from Georgi Dimitrov. On 25 September, Georgiev nominally became head of the War Ministry, and Velchev was sent as ambassador to Switzerland, avoiding for the moment a show trial. In September-November 1946, Georgiev was in charge of the War Ministry. During this period, he was promoted to the rank of colonel general.

On 5 October 1946, at a rally in Sofia, Kimon Georgiev opened the Fatherland Front&#x27;s election campaign for the election of the Sixth Grand National Assembly. The Fatherland Front participated in the elections with a common list and separate ballots for the member parties. While the Communists obtained an absolute majority in the parliament, the People&#x27;s Union Zveno had an extremely poor result of about 70,000 votes, and its leaders, including Georgiev himself, became deputies only thanks to the common list of the Fatherland Front.

== Ministries held ==
After the elections to the Grand National Assembly and the declaration of Bulgaria as a republic, the post of prime minister was occupied by the Communist leader Georgi Dimitrov, and Kimon Georgiev became deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs in place of Petko Stainov, who had lost the confidence of the Soviet government. In this post he participated in the Bulgarian delegation and signed the Paris Peace Treaty of 10 February 1947.

In the second government of Georgi Dimitrov of 12 December 1947 he was removed from the Foreign Ministry and became Minister of Electrification and Land Reclamation, remaining in this post until 1959, after which he briefly served as Chairman of the Committee on Construction and Architecture. He was Deputy Prime Minister until 1950 and again in 1959–1962. Kimon Georgiev was expelled from the country&#x27;s political leadership, which was placed under the full control of the Bulgarian Communist Party. At the same time, as Minister of Electrification, he played an important role, as the construction of the power industry was key to the Communists&#x27; policy of massive industrialization. Between 1947 and 1959, electricity production increased more than sixfold, and numerous power plants, dams and transmission facilities were built.

In 1948, after the revocation of Damyan Velchev&#x27;s Bulgarian citizenship, the State Security started a secret investigation against Georgiev. This took place in the context of growing tensions between Yugoslavia and the Soviet bloc, and Georgiev was known for his long-standing position in favour of friendly relations between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. The investigation did not lead to public accusations, and Georgiev himself learned about it years later. In September 1949, Stalin put an end to so-called &quot;people&#x27;s democracy&quot; in Eastern Europe, beginning the final formation of totalitarian regimes in the region. Those closest to the communists, the Zveno activists, such as Traicho Dobroslavsky, Trifon Trifonov, and Kiril Shterev, demanded a public stand against the disgraced Damyan Velchev, Vasil Yurukov, and Petko Stainov. In a conference held on February 19, 1949, the People&#x27;s Union Zveno accepted that it had fulfilled its role and decided to dissolve itself and join the Fatherland Front in full. With this act, Zveno ceased to exist as an independent political organization. Georgiev left politics in 1952 and led a reclusive life until his death.
== Personal life ==
Kimon Georgiev married Veselina Rodeva from the prominent Rodeva family of Burgas, they had two daughters - Maria (1928–1986) and Kornelia (b. 1931). Maria became an agronomist and university lecturer and was married to the Fatherland Front functionary Ginyo Ganev.

Kimon Georgiev during his non-political time, he would engage in public work, in which he supported himself from his wife&#x27;s large vineyards. This brought him a considerable income, in which he earned about 4-5 million leva from the production of wine and grapes in the 1940s.

== Death ==
Kimon Georgiev died suddenly of a stroke at around 1 pm on 28 September 1969 at the rest station of the Council of Ministers in Varna, shortly after visiting the Varna TPP, which had opened a month earlier. He was buried on 30 September in the Central Sofia Cemetery with state honours, with Prime Minister Todor Zhivkov attending the ceremony.

== Awards ==
From 1962 until his death in 1969 Kimon Georgiev was a member of the Presidium of the National Assembly. Twice, in 1962 and 1967, he received the title &quot;Hero of Socialist Labour&quot;.

<text>The Inland Valley Daily Bulletin is a daily newspaper based in Ontario, California, serving the Pomona Valley and southwest San Bernardino County. The &quot;Daily Bulletin&quot; is a member of the Southern California News Group (formerly the Los Angeles Newspaper Group), a division of Digital First Media. After 30 years of operations from its Ontario Office, the &quot;Daily Bulletin&quot; moved to Rancho Cucamonga in 2015.

Donrey Media formed the paper in 1990 by merging the Progress Bulletin of Pomona with &quot;The Daily Report&quot; of Ontario. Donrey had owned both papers since 1967. It is owned by Digital First Media, which took control of the paper in 1999.

The coverage area for the &quot;Daily Bulletin&quot; includes Pomona, San Dimas, La Verne and Claremont in Los Angeles County, Chino, Chino Hills, Montclair, Ontario, Rancho Cucamonga and Upland in San Bernardino County.

<text>The Celastraceae (staff-vine or bittersweet) are a family of 98 genera and 1,350 species of herbs, vines, shrubs and small trees, belonging to the order Celastrales. The great majority of the genera are tropical, with only &quot;Celastrus&quot; (the staff vines), &quot;Euonymus&quot; (the spindles) and &quot;Maytenus&quot; widespread in temperate climates, and &quot;Parnassia&quot; (bog-stars) found in alpine and arctic climates.

Of the 98 currently recognized genera of the family Celastraceae, 19 are native to Madagascar and these include at least 57 currently recognized species. Six of these 19 genera (&quot;Brexiella&quot;, &quot;Evonymopsis&quot;, &quot;Hartogiopsis&quot;, &quot;Polycardia&quot;, &quot;Ptelidium&quot;, and &quot;Salvadoropsis&quot;) are endemic to Madagascar. These genera each have distinctive traits and functions of their own.

<text>In baseball, the field manager (commonly referred to as the manager) is the equivalent of a head coach who is responsible for overseeing and making final decisions on all aspects of on-field team strategy, lineup selection, training and instruction. Managers are typically assisted by a staff of assistant coaches whose responsibilities are specialized. Field managers are typically not involved in off-field personnel decisions or long-term club planning, responsibilities that are instead held by a team&#x27;s general manager. 

== Duties ==
The manager chooses the batting order and starting pitcher before each game, and makes substitutions throughout the game – among the most significant being those decisions regarding when to bring in a relief pitcher. How much control a manager takes in a game&#x27;s strategy varies from manager to manager and from game to game. Some managers control pitch selection, defensive positioning, decisions to bunt, steal, pitch out, etc., while others designate an assistant coach or a player (often the catcher) to make some or all of these decisions.

Some managers choose to act as their team&#x27;s first base or third base coach while their team is batting in order to more closely communicate with baserunners, but most managers delegate this responsibility to an assistant. Managers are typically assisted by two or more coaches.

== In professional baseball ==
In many cases, a manager is a former professional, semi-professional or college player. From 1901 to 1981, 21% of MLB managers had played catcher during their playing career--the most common. Outfielders made up 16.6% and second basemen made up 13% of managers. Over the same period, managers who were second basemen had the highest winning percentage.

The manager&#x27;s responsibilities normally are limited to in-game decisions, with off-field roster management and personnel decisions falling to the team&#x27;s general manager. The term &quot;manager&quot; used without qualification almost always refers to the field manager (essentially equivalent to the head coach in other North American professional sports leagues), while the general manager is often called the GM. This usage dates back to the early days of professional baseball when it was common practice for teams to have just one &quot;manager&quot; on their staff, and where GM duties were performed either by the field manager or (more commonly) by the owner of the team. Some owners (most famously, Connie Mack of the Philadelphia Athletics) carried out both GM and field managerial duties themselves.

Major League Baseball managers differ from the head coaches of most other professional sports in that they dress in the same uniform as the players and are assigned a jersey number. The wearing of a matching uniform is frequently practiced at other levels of play, as well. The manager may be called &quot;skipper&quot; or &quot;skip&quot; informally by his players.

==Baseball Hall of Fame managers==
There have been 24 people who have been elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum primarily for their careers as managers. Of the 24 Hall of Fame managers, 20 were Major League players before becoming managers (the exceptions being Jim Leyland, Joe McCarthy, Frank Selee, and Earl Weaver). The most recent manager to be elected was Leyland, who was elected to the Hall of Fame by the Contemporary Baseball Era Committee in 2024.

<text>The Fatherland Front () was a Bulgarian pro-communist political resistance movement, which began in 1942 during World War II. The Zveno movement, the communist Bulgarian Workers Party, a wing of the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union and the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party all became part of the OF. The constituent groups of the OF had widely contrasting ideologies and had united only in the face of the pro-German militarist dictatorship in Bulgaria. At the beginning, the members of the OF worked together, without a single dominating group. Professional associations and unions could be members of the front and maintain their organisational independence. However, the Bulgarian Communist Party soon began to dominate. In 1944, after the Soviet Union had declared war on Bulgaria, the OF carried out a coup d&#x27;état (9 September 1944) and declared war on Germany and the other Axis powers. The OF government, headed by Kimon Georgiev of Zveno, signed a ceasefire treaty with the Soviet Union (28 October 1944). In the summer of 1945 most of BANU led by Nikola Petkov and most of the Social-Democrats had left the OF and became a large opposition group which later on after the 1946 Grand National Assembly election would become a coalition named &quot;Federation of the village and urban labour&quot; with 99 MPs out of 465.

On November 18, 1945, the OF won a large majority in national elections. In November 1946 Georgiev resigned as Prime Minister and was succeeded by Georgi Dimitrov, leader of the communists. Bulgaria became a People&#x27;s Republic on 15 September 1946 after a referendum. In 1948 and 1949 all the remaining parties in the OF save for the pro-communist wing of the BANU self-dissolved and merged into the BCP. The OF eventually transformed into a wide-ranging popular front under overall Communist control.

From 1947 onward, the Fatherland Front was effectively the only legally permitted political organization in Bulgaria. Voters were presented with a single list from the Front at all elections from 1949 to 1986, with official figures showing well over 99 percent of voters approving the list. With the fall of communism in Bulgaria the Fatherland Front was dissolved in 1990.

<text>The École spéciale d&#x27;architecture (ÉSA; formerly École centrale d&#x27;architecture) is a private school for architecture at 254, boulevard Raspail in Paris, France. The diploma from the École spéciale d&#x27;architecture (DESA), recognized by the State since 1934, entitles the holder to registration with the Order of Architects.

The school was founded in 1865 by engineer Emile Trélat as reaction against the educational monopoly of Beaux-Arts architecture. It was endorsed by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, a childhood friend, who after many infructuous attempts at reforming the École des Beaux-Arts had imagined the idea in 1863. Viollet le Duc provided many of the educational precepts and became one of its original stockholders, along with other notables including : Ferdinand de Lesseps, Anatole de Baudot, Eugène Flachat, Dupont de l&#x27;Eure, Jean-Baptiste André Godin, and Émile Muller.

Even at its beginning it included innovative courses such as domestic hygiene and urban public health. It was officially recognized as providing &quot;public utility&quot; in 1870, and recognized by the state as an institution of higher education in 1934.

Today, the school issues the &quot;Architecte DE&quot; degree awarding a master&#x27;s degree in architecture, and the &quot;Architecte DESA, HMONP&quot; degree, recognized by the European Union allowing architects to open their own architectural practice, and is organized into five departments: 
:Architecture and Environment
:Visual Arts and Representation
:History and Human Science
:Building Science and Technology
:Computer applications and Communications.

It is a &quot;free school&quot; governed in part by its students and alumni. Major decisions are taken by the administrative council and the general assembly consisting of students, alumni, teaching staff and administrators. It has an international exchange student program with the Cal Poly Pomona College of Environmental Design, in California, United States, and with the University of Cincinnati College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning, in Ohio, United States.

Notable students and staff include Ricardo Larraín Bravo, Pierre Karkar, Albert Besson, Jon Condoret, Jules Dormal Godet, Robert Mallet-Stevens, Farah Pahlavi, Auguste Perret, Henri Prost, Vartan Hovanessian, René Sergent, Luis Malausséna, Paul Virilio, and Christian de Portzamparc.

<doc id="501691" wikidata="Q3352816" url="?curid=501691" title="Ontario Mills">
<text>Ontario Mills is a shopping and outlet mall located in Ontario, California, within the Los Angeles metropolitan area. With 28 million annual visitors, it is one of the top shopping and tourist destinations in California. It is one of three Mills landmarks in California that are now managed by Simon Property Group since April 2007. Simon owns 50% of it. The Outlets at Orange and The Great Mall are the others. Ontario Mills was designed by the architectural firm, F+A Architects.

The mall is near the Ontario International Airport and Auto Club Speedway, as well as the interchange between the Ontario Freeway (Interstate 15) and the San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10), one of the busiest in Southern California.

==Size==
According to the mall&#x27;s former owners, the Mills Corporation, it is the largest one-level shopping mall in Western North America (there are larger malls, but they have two or more levels). In addition, it is California&#x27;s largest outlet and value retail shopping destination.

Like other Mills malls, Ontario Mills is divided into neighborhoods. This mall has the most out of the Mills malls with ten.

==Tenants==
Some of the mall&#x27;s major tenants include Off 5th Saks Fifth Avenue, H&amp;M, Skechers Factory Store, Nike Factory Store, Forever 21, Nordstrom Rack, Marshalls, Burlington Coat Factory, Uniqlo, a 30-screen AMC Theatres megaplex, the dining and entertainment venue Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s video game arcade, and the Ontario IMPROV comedy club.

Ontario Mills is home to many designer-label outlet stores, including Tory Burch, Ann Taylor, Ralph Lauren, Hugo Boss, DKNY, Tommy Hilfiger, Perry Ellis, Calvin Klein, Coach, Kate Spade, LACOSTE and Michael Kors. Other stores include GameStop, LEGO Store, Disney Store Outlet, Tumi, Movado, J. Crew, ULTA Beauty, Express, and Levi&#x27;s.

The mall also has a large food court called &quot;Market&quot;, formerly called &quot;Big Food&quot;, with about 1,000 seats and tenants like Panda Express, Burger King, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Sbarro, Starbucks Coffee, and Cinnabon. Restaurants outside the food court include Rainforest Cafe, Market Broiler, and Blaze Pizza.

==History==
Ontario Mills opened to the public on November 14, 1996, across the highway from the site of the Ontario Motor Speedway (built on the site of the old speedway parking lot). Like all other Mills properties, it was first developed and once owned by the Mills Corporation. Ontario Mills is the first Mills landmark center to have the racetrack layout and themed neighborhoods. On December 13, 1996, AMC Ontario Mills 30 opened, making it the largest theatre in the world at the time.

An IMAX-like UltraScreen theater and a California Welcome Center operated by the entrance near the food court until 2000, when it was replaced by the Ontario IMPROV comedy club, Market Broiler, and a Nike Factory Store. Ontario Mills was formerly home to a Vans Skate Park, which in early 2005 was closed and converted into Steve &amp; Barry&#x27;s. In 2009, Steve &amp; Barry&#x27;s and Virgin Megastore were closed due to their chains&#x27; liquidations. Sports Authority closed its store in 2004 when the company merged with Gart Sports; Sports Authority then reopened in the mall next to the Nike Factory Store in 2012, but closed again in August 2016 due to Chapter 11 Bankruptcy of the company, leading to the liquidation of all stores; it is now occupied by Aki Home. The well-known Wolfgang Puck Cafe closed in early 2005 and was replaced by the Polo Ralph Lauren Factory Store. A Neiman Marcus Last Call opened in 2012 on the former Steve &amp; Barry&#x27;s, along with an expansion of the existing Forever 21 and Nordstrom Rack stores and a new renovated food court. Ontario Mills also had one of the few JCPenney 5 Star outlets in the country, but it closed after JCPenney liquidated them in 2013 and was replaced by Fashion Q in 2014. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond moved its store out of the mall across the street into a new shopping center in 2015; Restoration Hardware opened an outlet store in the former Bed Bath &amp; Beyond space in 2016, and an Ulta Beauty also opened that year at the mall. Neiman Marcus Last Call closed on December 31, 2016 and was replaced by the Skechers Factory Store. One of the former video game arcade tenants opened on July 20, 1997, GameWorks closed in July 2017 after 20 years in Ontario Mills and was replaced by the Under Armour Factory Store. On May 13, 2018 (Mother&#x27;s Day), after opening the previous year, Toys R Us Outlet closed due to Chapter 11 Bankruptcy after the company announced they would be going out of business. 
The mall&#x27;s first expansion opened in the former JCPenney 5 Star Outlet building in the Summer of 2016, including an expanded Tommy Hilfiger store, and new tenants including Uniqlo, The North Face, Coach, and a Blaze Pizza with an outdoor patio. A new mall entrance was also added to the area with a more contemporary and modernized look.

Like other premium outlet centers, Ontario Mills was built in an area that had ample land available. The development of the mall has since contributed to the further urbanization of the eastern Ontario area and adjacent cities.

<text>Braj, also known as Vraj, Vraja, Brij or Brijbhumi, is a region in India on both sides of the Yamuna river with its centre at Mathura-Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh state encompassing the area which also includes Palwal, Ballabhgarh and Nuh in Haryana state, Deeg, Bharatpur, Karauli, and Dholpur in Rajasthan state and Morena District in Madhya Pradesh. Within Uttar Pradesh, it is very well demarcated culturally, the area stretches from the Mathura, Aligarh, Agra, Hathras and districts up to the Etah district. Braj region is associated with Radha and Krishna who according to scriptures were born in Barsana and Mathura respectively. It is the main centre of Krishna circuit of Hindu pilgrimage.

It is located 150 km south of Delhi and 50 km northwest of Agra.

Ecologically, the character of Braj has drastically changed in the last 200 years, with a heavy decline in the number of wild animals along with deforestation. Writing in the late 1980s, Entwistle noted there were only a few groves left in the region, and that many sacred sites were being encroached upon by human agricultural settlements.

==Etymology==
The term Braj is derived from the Sanskrit word व्रज &quot;vraja&quot;. Vraja was first mentioned in Rigveda, and in Sanskrit it means a pasture, shelter or resort for cattle from the Sanskrit term &quot;&quot; which means &quot;to go&quot; in English.

==Braj pilgrimage circuits==


The&quot; Braj Yatra&quot; circuit of pilgrimage was formally established by the 16th-century sadhus of the vaishnava sampradaya with fixed routes, itinerary and rituals. The area the circuit covers is spread across 2500 km2 with 84 kos or 300 km long periphery extending 10 km to the east and 50 km to the north and west. Braj has two main types of pilgrimage circuits, the traditional longer &quot;Braj Yatra&quot; encompassing the whole circuit, and the other shorter significantly modified contemporary point-to-point pilgrimage to visit the main sites at Mathura, Vrindavan, Gokul, Govardhan. The former, longer traditional pilgrimage route, also includes additional sacred sites Nandgaon and Barsana with travel on foot.

<text>Bundeli (Devanagari: बुन्देली/बुंदेली) or Bundelkhandi is an Indo-Aryan language spoken in the Bundelkhand region of central India. It belongs to the Central Indo-Aryan languages and is part of the Western Hindi subgroup.

==Classification==
A descendant of the Sauraseni Apabhramsha language, Bundeli was classified under Western Hindi by George Abraham Grierson in his Linguistic Survey of India. Bundeli is also closely related to Braj Bhasha, which was the foremost literary language in north-central India until the nineteenth century.

Like many other Indo-Aryan languages, Bundeli has often been subject to a designation as a dialect, instead of a language. Furthermore, as is the case with other Hindi languages, Bundeli speakers have been conflated with those of Standard Hindi in censuses.

Grierson divided Bundeli into four dialect groups:

* Standard Bundeli, Bundeli, language of Tikamgarh, Lalitpur etc.
* Northeaster Bundeli (closely related to Bagheli)
* Northwester Bundeli (similar to Braj Bhasha)

<text>The [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] Fair is an annual county fair. It was first held on October 17, 1922, and ran for five days through October 21, 1922, in a former beet field in Pomona, California. Highlights of the fair&#x27;s first year were harness racing, chariot races and an airplane wing-walking exhibition. The fair is one of the largest county fairs in the United States. Attendance has topped one million people every year with the exception of three years since 1948, and is the 4th largest fair in the United States. Since its opening year, over 89,000,000 visitors have attended the LA County Fair.

Since its inception, the fair has been the link between California’s agriculture industry and the public, providing a community gathering place where people learn about California’s heritage and enjoy traditional fair food, activities and entertainment. In recent years, the fair has moved away from such agricultural heritage by transitioning from livestock competitions for area growers and ranchers to hired petting zoos. In addition to the Ray Cammack Shows carnival, the fair has an operational farm, an outdoor miniature garden railroad, California’s Heritage Square historical exhibit and America’s Kids-Education Expo. They also have the Flower and Garden Pavilion, a grandstand for shows and several large Expo Halls.

The May Concert Series features multiple nights of musical entertainment, including many well-known acts. When the Fair was held in September, there was the &quot;End of Summer Concert Series&quot; which also included motocross and monster truck performances. 

The fair is operated by the Los Angeles County Fair Association, a non-profit 501(c)(5) corporation. The fair has been regularly held during the end-of-summer months from its inception in 1922 through the 2000s, except for all fairs since 2022, held in May. The fair is built on of fairgrounds known as Fairplex (Los Angeles County Fair, hotel and exposition complex). This also generates a national economic impact of more than $250 million.

The Los Angeles County Fair&#x27;s mascot &quot;Thummer&quot; was introduced in 1948 as &quot;Porky the Hitchhiking Pig&quot;. The artist - Morrie Stewart - originally designed the pig mascot for Kaiser Steel before being approached by the fair to create a new mascot with the re-opening of the fair following World War II. &quot;Porky the Hitchhiking Pig&quot; appeared at the Los Angeles County Fair through 1952 when another cartoon claimed naming rights to the name. The fair held a naming contest through radio and television, and the name &quot;Thummer&quot; was adopted. Thummer has been a regular appearance at the Los Angeles County Fair ever since. Thummer wore his trademark outfit and carried a briefcase through the 1980s when a &quot;Mrs. Thummer&quot; was introduced. Thummer disappeared in the early 1980s, but reappeared in 1988.

Fairplex also includes the Sheraton Fairplex Hotel &amp; Conference Center, the Sheraton KOA/RV Park, Barretts Sales and Racing, a defunct horse racing track, the Millard Sheets Art Center, the Child Development Center at Fairplex, the Fairplex railway exhibit, Barretts Equine Ltd., a thoroughbred horse racing auction facility and the Wally Parks NHRA Motorsports Museum.

The Los Angeles County Fair was canceled shortly after the 1941 fair due to the outbreak of World War II and re-opened in 1948. The 2020-21 fairs were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in California, deferring, as announced in May 2021, the next fair to May 2022, citing that summer heat resulted in reduced attendance.

Patrollers include security guards, the Pomona Police and Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Office.

==History==
*The Tongva village site of Tooypinga was located at or near the grounds of the fair.
*These grounds were once used as the Wartime Civilian Control Administration Pomona Assembly Center during World War II. Japanese Americans were held here before being sent to internment camps. A historical marker was placed at the site in 2016. It was occupied from May 7 to August 24, 1942, and held more than 5,000 people. There are few, if any, buildings left from the original assembly center.
*The first L.A. County Fair was held in 1922, at the Los Angeles Fairgrounds in Pomona. The grounds, now known as Fairplex (short for L.A. County Fair, Hotel and Exposition Complex), are home to hundreds of other year-round events and activities other than the Fair. The Wally Parks NHRA Motorsports Museum is located on the grounds, as well as the Sheraton Fairplex Hotel &amp; Conference Center, the Rail Giants Museum (Fairplex railway exhibit), and the Auto Club Raceway at Pomona.
*Besides 1942, it was also cancelled from 1943 to 1947 and again from 2020 to 2021, coming back in 2022 for its 100th anniversary.

==Events held during the Fair==
The Los Angeles County Fair offers visitors a number of rides as well as a variety of food and drinks available. Community days feature community heroes (senior, adult and youth), elected officials and high school marching bands from cities within the 15-mile radius of Fairplex. The May concert series feature singers, bands and entertainers perform during the evening. Until 2013, there was horse racing during the Los Angeles County Fair meet at the Fairplex Park. From 2014 to 2021, all races during the Los Angeles County Fair meet had been held at the Los Alamitos Race Course for two weeks (8 race days, Thursday–Sunday). Thereafter, those races are at Santa Anita Park. At the start of each year, a theme for the fair is chosen by the Los Angeles County Fair Association.

==In popular culture==
The county fair is played as a carnival in the HBO series &quot;Euphoria&quot;, however, the carnival is built outside the county fair.

<doc id="501697" wikidata="Q2356364" url="?curid=501697" title="Bagheli language">
<text>Bagheli (Devanagari: बघेली) or Baghelkhandi is a Central Indo-Aryan language spoken in the Baghelkhand region of central India.

==Classification==

A language belonging to the Eastern Hindi subgroup, Bagheli is one of the languages designated as a &#x27;dialect of Hindi&#x27; by the Indian Census Report of 2011. Bagheli is a regional language used for intra-group and inter-group communication. 

George Abraham Grierson in his &quot;Linguistic Survey of India&quot; classified Bagheli under Eastern Hindi. The extensive research conducted by local specialist Dr.Bhagawati Prasad Shukla is commensurate with Grierson&#x27;s classification. Ethnologue cites Godwani, Kumhari and Rewa as dialects of Bagheli. According to Shukla, the Bagheli language has three varieties:

# Pure Bagheli
# Western-Mixed Bagheli
# Southern-Broken Bagheli

Like many other Indo-Aryan languages, it has often been subject to erroneous, arbitrary, or politically-motivated designation as a dialect, instead of a language. Furthermore, as is the case with other Hindi languages, Bagheli speakers have been conflated with those of Standard Hindi in censuses.

== Geographical distribution ==

Bagheli is primarily spoken in the Mauganj, Rewa, Satna, Sidhi, Singrauli, Shahdol, Umaria, Anuppur, Katni districts of Madhya Pradesh and in some parts of Prayagraj and Chitrakoot districts of Uttar Pradesh and also Baikunthpur of Madhya Pradesh.

== Popular culture ==

The Pao, a scheduled tribe also known as the Pabra, speak Bagheli as their first language. Their language was mistakenly reported to be Tibeto-Burman by &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, perhaps due to confusion with the Pao language of Burma.

There are several radio and TV programmes in Bagheli. All India Radio is broadcasting Bagheli songs and agricultural programmes from Shahdol, Rewa and Bhopal. Furthermore, courses about Bagheli literature are available to be studied at Awadhesh Pratap Singh University, Rewa.

<doc id="501699" wikidata="Q1462535" url="?curid=501699" title="Monokini">
<text>The monokini (also known as a &quot;topless [[bikini]]&quot; or &quot;unikini&quot;) was designed by Rudi Gernreich in 1964, consisting of only a brief, close-fitting bottom and two thin straps; it was the first women&#x27;s topless swimsuit. His revolutionary and controversial design included a bottom that &quot;extended from the midriff to the upper thigh&quot; and was &quot;held up by shoestring laces that make a halter around the neck.&quot; Some credit Gernreich&#x27;s design with initiating, or describe it as a symbol of, the sexual revolution.

Gernreich designed the monokini as a protest against a repressive society. He did not initially intend to produce the monokini commercially, but was persuaded by Susanne Kirtland of &quot;Look&quot; to make it available to the public. When the first photograph of a frontal view of Peggy Moffitt wearing the design was published in &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; on June 3, 1964, it generated a great deal of controversy in the United States and other countries. Gernreich sold about 3,000 suits, but only two were worn in public. The first was worn publicly on June 19, 1964, by Carol Doda in San Francisco at the Condor Nightclub, ushering in the era of topless nightclubs in the United States, and the second at North Avenue beach in Chicago in July 1964 by artist&#x27;s model Toni Lee Shelley, who was arrested.

== Etymology ==

Gernreich may have chosen his use of the word &quot;monokini&quot; (&quot;mono&quot; meaning &#x27;single&#x27;) through back-formation by interpreting the &quot;bi&quot; of &quot;bikini&quot; as the Latin prefix &quot;bi-&quot; (&#x27;two&#x27;), denoting a two-piece swimsuit. But in fact the bikini swimsuit design was named by its inventor Louis Réard after the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific, five days after Operation Crossroads, the first peace-time test of nuclear weapons, took place there. Réard hoped his design would have a similarly explosive effect.

== Background ==

Austrian-American fashion designer, co-founder of the Mattachine Society, and nudist Rudi Gernreich had strong feelings about society&#x27;s sexualization of the human body and disagreed with religious and social beliefs that the body was essentially shameful. Gernreich developed a reputation as an avant-garde designer who broke many of the rules, and his swimsuit designs were unconventional. In its December 1962 issue, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; remarked, &quot;He has turned the dancer&#x27;s leotard into a swimsuit that frees the body. In the process, he has ripped out the boning and wiring that made American swimsuits seagoing corsets.&quot; That month he first envisioned creating a topless swimsuit which he called a monokini.

== Origins ==
At the end of 1963, editor Susanne Kirtland of &quot;Look&quot; called Gernreich and asked him to submit a design for the suit to accompany a trend story along futuristic lines. He resisted the idea at first, but said, &quot;It was my prediction. For the sake of history, I didn&#x27;t want Pucci to do it first. Gernreich found the design more difficult than he expected. His initial designs looked like trunks or boxer shorts. He felt the swimsuit ought to just be bikini bottoms, but realized that this wouldn&#x27;t constitute a unique design. He initially designed a Balinese sarong that began just under the breasts, but Kirtland didn&#x27;t feel the design was bold enough and needed to make more of a statement. Gernreich finally chose a design that ended around mid-torso and then added two straps that rose between the breasts and were tied around the neck. The first two initial attempts to cut the design failed. When a photo shoot was arranged on Montego Bay in the Bahamas, all five models hired for the session refused to wear the design. The photographer finally persuaded an adventurous local to model it.

To avoid letting others sensationalize the swimsuit and to retain some control of the design, Gernreich asked William Claxton, the husband of Gernreich&#x27;s usually sole model Peggy Moffitt, to take pictures of his wife in the yellow wool swimsuit. Claxton, Moffitt, and Gernreich wanted to publish their own pictures for the fashion press and news media, and Gernreich gave pictures of Moffit modeling the monokini to a carefully selected handful of news organizations.

Moffitt was initially resistant to the idea of posing topless. She said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to do it when he asked me. I am a puritanical descendent of the Mayflower. I carried that goddamned Plymouth Rock on my back. When I did give in, I did so with a lot of rules. I would not show myself on the runway that way. I&#x27;d do it only with Bill. Since Rudi would never ever have enough money to do this, I did it for free. But I had final say on everywhere it went photographically.&quot; &quot;Look&quot; published a rear view, of an adventurous local from Montego Bay, modeling the swimsuit on June 2, 1964. Claxton took his pictures of Moffit to &quot;Life&quot; but they said they could only print pictures of naked breasts &quot;if the woman is an aborigine.&quot; Claxton took additional pictures of Moffit especially for &quot;Life&quot; with her arms covering her breasts. The picture was one of several images of Moffit in a story about the historical evolution of the breast in fashion history from 1954 to 1964. Moffit said, &quot;The photograph of me in that issue—hiding my breasts with my arms—is dirty. If you are wearing a fashion that does not have a top as part of its design and hold your arms over your bosom, you&#x27;re going along with the whole prudish, teasey thing like a Playboy bunny.&quot;

The following day columnist Carol Bjorkman of &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; published Claxton&#x27;s frontal view of Moffitt wearing the suit. It became a celebrated image of the extremism of 1960s designs. Moffit later said, &quot;It was a political statement. It wasn&#x27;t meant to be worn in public.&quot;
On June 12, 1964 the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; featured a photo of a woman in a monokini with her exposed breasts clearly visible on its front page. Claxton&#x27;s frontal image of Moffit modeling the swimsuit was subsequently published by &quot;Life&quot; and numerous other publications. &quot;Life&quot; writer Shana Alexander noted, &quot;One funny thing about toplessness is that it really doesn&#x27;t have much to do with breasts. Breasts of course are not absurd; topless swimsuits are. Lately people keep getting the two things mixed up.&quot; She mocked the swimsuit design as a &quot;joke&quot;. The photo catapulted Moffitt into instant celebrity, reportedly resulting in her receiving everything from marriage proposals to death threats. Moffitt and Claxton later wrote &quot;The Rudi Gernreich Book&quot;, described as an aesthetic biography of the fashion revolutionary.

Gernreich originally thought that only &quot;six or seven&quot; monokinis would likely be sold, but decided to design it anyway. However, when the design got worldwide notice, orders for the non-existent suit poured in until over 1,000 orders were pending. Despite the reaction of fashion critics and church officials, Harmon Knitwear made over 3,000 monokinis. Gernreich first sold the suit to the Joseph Magnin department store in San Francisco, where it was an instant hit. In New York City, leading stores like B. Altman &amp; Company, Lord &amp; Taylor, Henri Bendel, Splendiferous and Parisette placed orders. On June 16, 1964, Gernreich&#x27;s topless swimsuit went on sale in New York City. The suit was priced at $24 each.

Moffit said in 1985 that she had been offered $17,000 in 1964 () by &quot;Playboy&quot; to publish Claxton&#x27;s photograph of her wearing the suit, but refused. &quot;I turned it down as unthinkable. And I don&#x27;t want to exploit women any more now than I did in 1964. The statement hasn&#x27;t changed. The suit still is about freedom and not display.&quot;

On August 13, 1985, Los Angeles Fashion Group produced a gala at the Wiltern Theatre to benefit the Rudi Gernreich Design Scholarship Fund. Moffit was a member of the committee. When the group considered showing the Monokini suit during the benefit, Moffitt strongly objected. She told the Los Angeles Times,

The regional director of the Fashion Group, Sarah Worman, believed that the swimsuit was &quot;the single most important idea he ever had—the one that changed the way women dressed all over the Western world.&quot; She said Moffitt&#x27;s refusal to show it on a model did not make sense when the benefit was modeling everything else he ever did on live models.

== Fashion statement ==
Gernreich did not originally intend to produce the swimsuit commercially. It had more meaning to Gernreich as an idea than as a reality. Gernreich had Moffitt model the suit in person for Diana Vreeland of &quot;Vogue&quot;, who asked him why he conceived of the design. Gernreich told her he felt it was time for &quot;freedom-in fashion as well as every other facet of life,&quot; but that the swimsuit was just a statement. He said, “[Women] drop their bikini tops already,” he said, “so it seemed like the natural next step.” She told him, &quot;If there&#x27;s a picture of it, it&#x27;s an actuality. You must make it.&quot; Gernreich said in television interview, &quot;It may well be a bit much now. But, just wait. In a couple of years topless bikinis will be a reality and regarded as perfectly natural.&quot;

Gernreich purposefully used his designs to advance his socio-political views. He wanted to reduce the stigma of a naked body, to “cure our society of its sex hang up,” as he put it. Gernreich stated, &quot;To me, the only respect you can give to a woman is to make her a human being. A totally emancipated woman who is totally free.&quot;

Gernreich said, &quot;Baring the breasts seemed logical in a period of freer attitudes, freer minds, the emancipation of women.&quot; Gernreich told &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1969, the monokini &quot;is a natural development growing out of all the loosening up, the re-evaluation of values that&#x27;s going on. There is now an honesty hangup, and part of this is not hiding the body—it stands for freedom.&quot;

In January 1965, he told Gloria Steinem in an interview that despite the criticism he&#x27;d do it again.

Moffitt said the design was a logical evolution of Gernreich&#x27;s avant-garde ideas in swimwear design as much as a scandalous symbol of the permissive society. She said, &quot;He was trying to take away the prurience, the whole perverse side of sex.&quot; She said his design was &quot;prophetic.&quot; &quot;It had to do with more than what to wear to the beach. It was about a changing culture throughout all society, about freedom and emancipation. It was also a reaction against something particularly American: the little boy snickering that women had breasts.&quot;

Los Angeles Times staff writer Bettijane Levine wrote, &quot;His topless was an artistic statement against women as sex objects, much as Pablo Picasso painted &quot;Guernica&quot; as a statement against war.&quot; Over the next few weeks, his design was covered in more than 20,000 press articles.

==History==
There was a strong public reaction to the original swimsuit design. The Soviet Union denounced the suit, saying it was &quot;barbarism&quot; and indicated &quot;capitalistic decay&quot;. The Vatican denounced the swimsuit, and the &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; said the &quot;industrial-erotic adventure&quot; of the topless bathing suit &quot;negates moral sense.&quot; Many of Rudi&#x27;s contemporaries in the fashion industry reacted negatively. In the US, some Republicans tried to blame the suit on the Democrats&#x27; stance on moral issues. Gernreich introduced the monokini at a time when U.S. nudists were trying to establish a public persona. The United States Postmaster General had banned nudist publications from the mail until 1958, when the Supreme Court of the United States declared that the naked body in and of itself could not be deemed obscene. Use of the word &quot;monokini&quot; was first recorded in English that year.

In the 1960s, the monokini influenced the sexual revolution by emphasizing a woman&#x27;s personal freedom of dress, even when her attire was provocative and exposed more skin than had been the norm during the more conservative 1950s. Quickly renamed a &quot;topless swimsuit&quot;, the design was never successful in the United States, although the issue of allowing both genders equal exposure above the waist has been raised as a feminist issue from time to time.

As the suit gained notoriety, the New York City Police Department was strictly instructed by the commissioner of parks to arrest any woman wearing a monokini. In Dallas, Texas, when a local store featured the suit in a window display, members of the Carroll Avenue Baptist Mission picketed until they removed the display. Copious coverage of the event helped to send the image of exposed breasts across the world. Women&#x27;s clubs and the Catholic church actively condemned the design. In Italy and Spain, the Catholic Church warned against the topless fashion.

=== France ===
In France in 1964, Roger Frey led the prosecution of the use of the monokini, describing it as: &quot;a public offense against the sense of decency, punishable according to article 330 of the penal code. Consequently, the police chiefs must employ the services of the police so that the women who wear this bathing suit in public places are prosecuted.&quot; At St. Tropez on the French Riviera, where toplessness later became the norm, the mayor ordered police to ban toplessness and to watch over the beach via helicopter.

Jean-Luc Godard, a founding mover of French New Wave cinema, incorporated monokini footage shot by Jacques Rozier in Riviera into his film &quot;A Married Woman&quot;, but it was edited out by the censors. A few defended Gernreich&#x27;s design. Fashion designers Geraldine Stutz, president of Henri Bendel, said, &quot;I only wish I were young enough to be one of the pioneers myself.&quot; Carol Bjorkman, a columnist at &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear-Daily&#x27;s&quot; wrote, &quot;What&#x27;s the matter with the front? After all, it is here to stay, and it is awfully nice being a girl.&quot;

=== Chicago ===
When Toni Lee Shelley, a 19-year-old artists model, wore the topless bathing suit to the North Avenue beach in Chicago in 1964, 12 police officers responded, 11 to control and disperse the public and photographers, and one to arrest her. She was charged with disorderly conduct, indecent exposure, and appearing on a public beach without suitable attire. At her arraignment she asked for an all-male jury. She told the press that the swimsuit was &quot;certainly more comfortable.&quot; Shelley was fined US$100 for wearing the swimsuit on a public beach.

=== San Francisco ===

On 12 June 1964, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; published on its front page a photo of a woman
with clearly visible, exposed breasts wearing a monokini.

On 19 June 1964, Davey Rosenberg saw an Joseph Magnin ad for the Monokini in a newspaper. Davey Rosenberg, the publicist of the Condor Club in San Francisco&#x27;s North Beach district, bought Gernreich&#x27;s monokini from Joseph Magnin, and gave it to former prune picker, file clerk, and waitress Carol Doda to wear for her act. That night, June 19, Doda became the first modern topless dancer in the United States, renewing the burlesque era of the early 1900s in the U.S. San Francisco Mayor John Shelley said, &quot;topless is at the bottom of porn.&quot; Within a few days, women were baring their breasts in many of the clubs lining San Francisco&#x27;s Broadway St., ushering in the era of the topless bar. Doda’s debut as a topless dancer was featured in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in April 1965.

San Francisco public officials tolerated the topless bars until April 22, 1965, when Doda was arrested along with Pete Mattioli and Gino del Prete, owners of the Condor Club. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the police department, calling for release of both Doda and free speech activist Mario Savio, held in the same station. Doda, Mattioli and Gino del Prete were cleared when two judges instructed not-guilty verdicts. Judge Friedman&#x27;s memorandum to opposing attorneys reads, &quot;Whether acts ... are lewd and dissolute depends not on any individual&#x27;s interpretation or personal opinion, but on the consensus of the entire community...&quot;. Doda rapidly became a symbol of sexual freedom, while topless restaurants, along with shoeshine parlors, ice-cream stands and girl bands proliferated in San Francisco and elsewhere. Journalist Earl Wilson wrote in his syndicated column, &quot;Are we ready for girls in topless gowns? Heck, we may not even notice them.&quot; English designers created topless evening gowns inspired by the idea. The &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; published a real estate advertisement that promised &quot;bare top swimsuits are possible here&quot;.

== Later designs ==


Going topless reached its highest popularity during the 1970s. In the early 1980s monokini designs that were simply a bikini-bottom (also known as the unikini) became popular. , some swimsuit designers continue to produce a variety of monokini or topless swimsuits that women can wear in private settings or in places where topless swimsuits are allowed.

Unlike Gernreich&#x27;s original design exposing the women&#x27;s breasts, current designs are one-piece swimsuits that cover the women&#x27;s breasts but typically include large cut-outs on the sides, back, or front. The cutouts are connected with varying fabrics, including mesh, chain, and other materials to link the top and bottom sections together. From the back the monokini looks like a two-piece swimsuit. The design may not be functional but aesthetic. Some suits are designed with a g-string style back and others offer full coverage.

=== Pubikini ===

In 1985, four weeks before his death, Gernreich unveiled the lesser-known pubikini, a topless bathing suit that exposed the wearer&#x27;s &quot;mons pubis&quot;. It was a thin, V-shaped, thong-style bottom that in the front featured a tiny strip of fabric that exposed the wearer&#x27;s pubic hair. The pubikini was described as a &quot;pièce de résistance&quot; totally freeing the human body.

<text>Rudolf &quot;Rudi&quot; Gernreich (August 8, 1922 April 21, 1985) was an Austrian-born American fashion designer whose avant-garde clothing designs are generally regarded as the most innovative and dynamic fashion of the 1960s. He purposefully used fashion design as a social statement to advance sexual freedom, producing clothes that followed the natural form of the female body, freeing them from the constraints of high fashion.

He was known for the early use of vinyl and plastic in clothing, and for his use of cutouts. He designed the first thong bathing suit, unisex clothing, the first swimsuit without a built-in bra, the minimalist, soft, transparent No Bra, and the topless monokini. He was a four-time recipient of the Coty American Fashion Critics Award. He produced what is regarded as the first fashion video, &quot;Basic Black: William Claxton w/Peggy Moffitt&quot;, in 1966. He had a long, unconventional, and trend-setting career in fashion design.

He was a founding member of and financially supported the early activities of the Mattachine Society. He consciously pushed the boundaries of acceptable fashion and used his designs as an opportunity to comment on social issues and to expand society&#x27;s perception of what was acceptable.

==Early years==
Gernreich was the only child of Siegmund Gernreich and Elisabeth (née Müller) Gernreich, a Jewish couple who lived in Vienna, Austria. His father was a stocking manufacturer who had served in World War I and who died by suicide when Gernreich was eight years old.

Gernreich learned about high fashion from his aunt, Hedwig Müller, who with her husband Oskar Jellinek, owned a dress shop. He spent many hours in his aunt&#x27;s shop sketching her designs for Viennese high society and learned about fabrics. He also gained early impressions of sexuality. He later told one of his favorite models, Leon Bing, about images of &quot;leather chaps with a strap running between the buttocks of street laborers&#x27; work pants and the white flesh of women&#x27;s thighs above gartered black stockings.&quot; When he was 12, Austrian designer Ladislaus Czettel saw his sketches and offered Gernreich a fashion apprenticeship in London, but his mother refused, believing her son was too young to leave home.

===Jewish refugee===
After the German Anschluss (when Nazi Germany annexed Austria) on 12 March 1938, Hitler, among many other acts, banned nudity. Austrian citizens were advocates of exercising nude, a rejection of the over-civilized world. His mother took 16-year-old Rudi and escaped to the United States as Jewish refugees, settling in Los Angeles, California. To survive, his mother baked pastries that Rudi sold door-to-door. His first job was washing bodies to prepare them for autopsy in the morgue of Cedars of Lebanon Hospital. He told Marylou Luther, &quot;I grew up overnight. I do smile sometimes when people tell me my clothes are so body-conscious [that] I must have studied anatomy. You bet I studied anatomy.&quot; He attended Los Angeles City College, where he studied art and apprenticed for a Seventh Avenue clothing manufacturer. He attended Los Angeles City College from 1938 to 1941, and the Los Angeles Art Center School from 1941 to 1942.

==Career==
He briefly worked in Hollywood costume design, but hated it. In 1942, he joined the Lester Horton&#x27;s modern dance company as both a dancer and designer. Gernreich said &quot;I never was a very good dancer ... I wanted to become a choreographer, but that never happened.&quot; Of his time with the Theater, Gernreich said that dancing made him &quot;aware of what clothes did to the rest of the body.&quot; He also designed freelance but left Lester Horton in 1948 and became a fabric salesman for Hoffman Company. Gernreich moved into fashion design from fabric design.

The fashion climate at that time was dictated by designers in Paris. In 1949 he briefly worked in New York at George Carmel but didn&#x27;t like the position because he felt pressured to imitate Parisian fashion. Gernreich said, &quot;Everyone with a degree of talent was motivated by a level of high taste and unquestioned loyalty to Paris. Dior, Fath, Balenciaga were gods—kings. You could not deviate from their look.&quot;

In 1951, still attempting to gain entry into the fashion world, Gernreich got a job with Morris Nagel to design for Versatogs, but Nagel required Gernreich to stick to the Versatogs design formula, which Gernreich hated.

He began designing his own line of clothes in Los Angeles and New York until 1951, when fellow Viennese immigrant Walter Bass in Beverly Hills convinced him to sign a seven-year contract with him. William Bass Inc. produced a collection of dresses that they sold to Jack Hanson, the owner of Jax, an emerging Los Angeles boutique that focused on avant-garde clothing that was fun and adventuresome. He also designed costumes for Lester Horton until 1952. For most of the 1950s, he collaborated with Hungarian Holocaust survivor and immigrant Renée Firestone in Los Angeles, before she started her own line in 1960.

In 1955, he began designing swimwear for Westwood Knitting Mills in Los Angeles. They hired him in 1959 as the swimwear designer. Genesco Corporation also hired him as a shoe designer in 1959. He completed his seven-year contract with Walter Bass in 1960 and founded his firm G.R. Designs in Los Angeles. He changed his company&#x27;s name to Rudi Gernreich Inc. in 1964. His designs were featured in what is generally regarded as the first fashion video, &quot;Basic Black: William Claxton w/Peggy Moffitt&quot;, in 1966.

In the early 1960s, Gernreich opened a Seventh Avenue showroom in New York City where he showed his popular designs for Harmon knitwear and his own more expensive line of experimental garments. Gernreich wanted his designs to be affordable and in 1966, he broke American fashion&#x27;s unwritten rule that name designers don&#x27;t sell to chain stores. On January 3, 1966, he took the unprecedented action of signing a contract with Montgomery Ward, a chain store. Rudi&#x27;s fashions proved popular and lasted several seasons, showing that original designs would sell at popular prices.

In 1966, Gernreich was named one of the &quot;fashion revolutionaries&quot; in New York by &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot;, alongside Edie Sedgwick, Tiger Morse, Pierre Cardin, Paco Rabanne, Baby Jane Holzer, André Courrèges, Emanuel Ungaro, Yves Saint Laurent, and Mary Quant.
He designed the Moonbase Alpha uniforms worn by the main characters of the 1970s British science-fiction television series &quot;&quot;, pushing the boundaries of the futuristic look in clothing over the course of three decades.

===Fashion as social commentary===
Gernreich was very much against sexualization of the human body and the notion that the body was essentially shameful. Gernreich developed strong feelings about society&#x27;s sexualization of the human body and disagreed with religious and social beliefs that the body was essentially shameful. He wanted to reduce the stigma of a naked body, to &quot;cure our society of its sex hang up,&quot; as he put it. Gerneich stated, &quot;To me, the only respect you can give to a woman is to make her a human being. A totally emancipated woman who is totally free.&quot;

Gernreich approached fashion as a social commentary. He said, &quot;I realized you could say things with clothes.&quot; Editors of &quot;Life&quot; magazine asked him to envision clothes in the future for its January 1, 1970, issue, and he produced designs of minimalist, unisex garments that could be worn by either men or women. He said he wanted to create a &quot;utility principle&quot; that would &quot;take our mind off how we look and concentrate on really important matters.&quot; Fashion writer Marylou Luther, who became a good friend of Gernreich, wrote that he had two motives in his designs: one was to create modern fashion &quot;for the 20th century and beyond,&quot; and the other was as &quot;a social commentator, who just happened to work in the medium of clothes.&quot; Gernreich purposefully used his designs to advance his socio-political views.

===Impact on fashion design===
During his career, he was compared in influence to these same fashion houses: Balenciaga, Dior, and André Courrèges, but he steadfastly refused to show his designs in Paris. Instead, he named Claire McCardell as his influence. Gernreich developed a reputation as an avant-garde designer who broke many design rules. As a former dancer, Gernreich was interested in liberating the body from the limitations of clothing. In 1952, while designing for Westwood, he introduced the first swimsuit without a built-in bra. Most swimsuits at the time had stiff inner construction with boned linings. His designs used elasticized wool knits that clung to the woman&#x27;s body.

In its December 1962 issue, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; remarked, &quot;He has turned the dancer&#x27;s leotard into a swimsuit that frees the body. In the process, he has ripped out the boning and wiring that made American swimsuits seagoing corsets&quot;. He was regarded as the designer who freed women from the limits of high fashion by creating vibrant, young, &quot;often daring clothing that followed the natural form of the female body.&quot;

Gernreich is regarded by some as the &quot;most innovative and dynamic fashion designers of the 20th century.&quot; In 1964, he created the first topless swimsuit, which he called the &quot;monokini&quot;. Gernreich was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; in December 1967 with models Peggy Moffitt and Leon Bing. The magazine described him as &quot;the most way-out, far-ahead designer in the U.S.&quot;

Cynthia Amnéus, Chief Curator and Curator of Fashion and Textiles at the Cincinnati Art Museum in Ohio, said &quot;Rudi was one of the most important and visionary American fashion designers of the 21st century ... Rudi was doing very shocking and avant-garde things, like taking all the structure out of swimwear, and creating a trapeze dress in the 1950s way before Yves Saint Laurent did.&quot;

He worked closely with model Peggy Moffitt and her husband and photographer William Claxton for many years, pushing the boundaries of the &quot;futuristic look&quot; in clothing over the course of three decades. His work paired minimalist designs with bright, psychedelic colors and strong geometric patterns, pushing the boundaries of contemporary women&#x27;s clothing. Moffitt increased the notoriety of his designs with avant-garde makeup and haircuts.

He was the sixth American designer to be elected to the Coty American Fashion Hall of Fame. He designed the first see-through chiffon blouse, fashioned clothes from leotards and tights, decorated them with zippers and dog leash clasps, and in 1970 introduced the idea of unisex clothing that was minimalist, utilitarian, and optional, including men&#x27;s suits and hats for women.. He showed his designs on a male and female model who were both shaved. He designed coordinated outfits of dresses, handbags, hats, and stockings. He was among the first to regularly use vinyl and plastic in clothes, used cut-out details, and designed the first soft, transparent bra — the No Bra.

In 1974, in response to Los Angeles banning nude beaches, he designed and named the first thong bathing suit that exposed the buttocks for both men and women. Gernreich patented the thong design but gave up enforcing his rights due to legal difficulties. From 1970 to 1971 he designed furnishings for Fortress and Knoll International, and in 1975 he designed men&#x27;s style underwear for Lily of France.

The next year he worked on cosmetics for Redken and costumes for the Bella Lewitzky Dance Company, along with kitchen accessories and ceramic bathroom accessories. Gernreich continued to collaborate with Lewitzky, designing sets and costumes for &quot;Pas de Bach&quot; in 1977,&quot; Rituals&quot; in 1979, &quot;Changes &amp; Choices&quot; in 1981, and &quot;Confines&quot; in 1982, all danced by the WCK3.

===Monokini===

Gernreich is most well known for his design of the first topless swimsuit, which he called the &quot;Monokini&quot;. Gernreich conceived the Monokini at the end of 1963, after Susanne Kirtland of &quot;Look&quot; called Gernreich and asked him to draw a suit to accompany a trend story along futuristic lines. That month he first envisioned a topless swimsuit that became the Monokini. The Monokini bottom was similar to a maillot swimsuit style but ended at mid-torso and was supported by two straps between the breasts and around the neck.

When Claxton&#x27;s photograph of his wife Peggy Moffitt modeling the design was published in &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; on June 4, 1964, it generated a great deal of controversy in the United States and other countries. Moffitt said the design was a logical evolution of Gernreich&#x27;s avant-garde ideas in swimwear design as much as a scandalous symbol of the permissive society. He saw the swimsuit as a protest against repressive society. He predicted that &quot;bosom will be uncovered within five years&quot;. He saw baring of a woman&#x27;s breasts as a form of freedom.

He initially did not intend to produce the design commercially, but Kirtland of &quot;Look&quot; urged him to make it available to the public. &quot;I thought we&#x27;d sell only six or seven, but I decided to design it anyway.&quot; Moffitt later said that the Monokini &quot;was a political statement. It wasn&#x27;t meant to be worn in public.&quot;

In January, 1965, he told Gloria Steinem in an interview that despite the criticism he&#x27;d do it again.

He later designed the &quot;pubikini&quot;—a bikini bottom with a window in front that revealed the model&#x27;s dyed and shaped pubic hair.

===No Bra===
Gernreich preferred that his designs should be worn braless, and in October 1964, at the request the brassiere manufacturer Exquisite Form, Gernreich announced the &quot;No Bra&quot;. The bra was made of sheer fabric without underwires or lining of any kind. Unlike contemporary bras, his design allowed breasts to assume their natural shape, rather than being molded into an aesthetic ideal.

It was a soft-cup, light-weight, seamless, sheer nylon tricot and elastic bra only available for small-breasted women. It came in three sheer colors: powder puff, black, and white, and in sizes 32 to 36, A and B cups. It had a single hook in the back.

The No Bra was a big departure from the sculpted, bullet-shaped bosom of the previous decade. It was quite similar to the original bra of the 1920s and like the first modern bra invented by Mary Phelps Jacob, two handkerchiefs attached to a band and tied around the chest. Gernreich&#x27;s no-bra was little more than that. Both the 1920s and the 1960s celebrated the stick-like figure of adolescence, and with that meant small, flat breasts.

His minimalist bra revolutionized brassiere design, initiating a trend toward more natural shapes and soft, sheer fabrics.

The retail success of the No Bra was followed in 1965 with the next design, a &quot;no-side&quot; bra to accommodate dresses with deep armholes. It had a narrow stretch band around the torso that allowed women to wear open-sleeved garments without displaying a bra band. The sheer cups were cut part of the bias and part of the half-bias. He also produced a &quot;No Front&quot; maillot design with a deep, plunging front for slit-to-the-waist necklines, and a &quot;No-Back&quot; long-line version that was anchored using contoured stretch-waistband that allowed a woman to wear a backless dress.

===Exhibitions===
Rudi exhibited his fashion at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York in 1967, &quot;Two Modern Artists of Dress: Elizabeth Hawes and Rudi Gernreich&quot;. A retrospective titled &quot;Fashion Will Go Out of Fashion&quot; was assembled in Kunstlerhaus Graz, Austria, in 2000. In 2003, an exhibition of his work held at the Phoenix Art Museum, in Phoenix, Arizona, hailed him as one of the most original, prophetic, and controversial American designers of the 1950s through to the 1970s. In 2019, the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles created &quot;Fearless Fashion: Rudi Gernreich&quot;, a major exhibition detailing Gernreich&#x27;s life and career.

===Awards and recognition===
Gernreich received his first design award in 1956, a junior award from &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. They awarded him the American Sportswear Design Award for his design of a black-and-white check wool jersey tank suit with no built-in bra. He won the Wool Knit Association award in 1960. In 1963, Gernreich won two major awards: in May he received &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;&#x27;s Sporting Look Award and in June he was awarded the Coty American Fashion Critics Award. The Coty Award stirred a controversy when the first recipient of the award, Norman Norell, gave his Coty Award back as a protest against Gernreich&#x27;s recognition. Norell told &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot;, &quot;It no longer means a thing to me. I can&#x27;t bear to look at it anymore. I saw a photograph of a suit of Rudi&#x27;s and one lapel of the jacket was shawl and the other was notched—well!&quot; He blamed the vote on &quot;jury members from &quot;Glamour&quot; and &quot;Seventeen&quot; who don&#x27;t get around to high fashion collections are responsible for the Gernreich vote.&quot; In response to Norell&#x27;s protest, the Bonwit Teller department store ran a half-page ad with the headline: &quot;Rudi Gernreich, we&#x27;d give you the Coty Award all over again!&quot; He received the award again in 1963, 1966, and 1967.

Additional awards included the Neiman Marcus award, Dallas, 1961; Sporting Look award, 1963; &quot;Sunday Times&quot; International Fashion Award, London, 1965; Filene&#x27;s Design award, Boston, 1966; Knitted Textile Association award, 1975; Council of Fashion Designers of America Special Tribute, 1985. Marylou Luther, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; fashion editor, wrote, &quot;To most of the people in the fashion industry, he was considered the most inventive designer of these times.&quot;

In 1985 Tom Bradley, the Mayor of the City of Los Angeles, proclaimed August 13 as &#x27;Rudi Gernreich Day&#x27; in recognition of Gernreich&#x27;s contributions to fashion and Los Angeles, declaring &quot;His designs were social commentary and forecast on our times and the future lifestyles of our nation.&quot;

On April 2, 2012, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named him to its list of the &quot;All-TIME 100 Fashion Icons&quot;. In 2000, the city of New York placed bronze plaques honoring American fashion designers, including Gernreich, along Seventh Avenue.

===Later life===
In his later life, Gernreich devoted himself to gourmet soups. He is credited with a recipe for red pepper soup, a cold soup served in red pepper cases and garnished with caviar and lemon.

==Personal life==

Gernreich became a U.S. citizen in 1943. He met Los Angeles-based Communist and gay rights activist Harry Hay in July 1950, and the two became lovers. Hay showed Gernreich &quot;The Call&quot;, a document outlining his plan for a gay support organization, and Gernreich told him, &quot;You know that I&#x27;m an Austrian refugee. This is the most dangerous thing I have ever read. And, yes, I&#x27;m with you 100 percent.&quot; In 1951 Gernreich was arrested and convicted in a police homosexual entrapment case, which was common in Southern California at that time.

Gernreich was a founding member of and an enthusiastic financial supporter of the Mattachine Society, though privately, preferring to be known by the initial &quot;R&quot;. Gernreich ended the relationship with Hay in 1952.

In 1953, Gernreich met Oreste Pucciani, future chairman of the UCLA French department, who was a key figure in bringing Jean-Paul Sartre to the attention of American educators. Oreste Pucciani was also a pivotal figure in the gay rights movement. The two men kept their relationship private as Gernreich believed public acknowledgment of his homosexuality would negatively affect his fashion business.

Gernreich never announced his sexual orientation. Moffit said, &quot;He just thought his sexuality was obvious.&quot; Gernreich typically wore a toupee, Gucci loafers, and jumpsuits with industrial zippers and drove a white Bentley around West Hollywood, where he lived with Pucciani until he died. Gernreich was diagnosed with lung cancer in January 1985 and died on April 21, 1985, at age 62. Oreste Pucciani, Gernreich&#x27;s partner for 31 years, endowed a trust in their name for the American Civil Liberties Union in 1988.

==In popular culture==
In 1967, he portrayed himself on an episode of the TV Series &quot;Batman&quot;, along with Eartha Kitt as “Catwoman”, entitled “Catwoman’s Dressed To Kill” (S3E14).

In 2009, Gernreich and the Mattachine Society became the subjects of the play &quot;The Temperamentals&quot; by Jon Maran. After workshop performances in 2009, the play opened off-Broadway at New World Stages in February 2010. Actor Michael Urie, who performed the role of Gernreich, received a Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Lead Actor.

After his death due to lung cancer, Moffitt retained the trademark on Gernreich&#x27;s name. In 2003, she signed a contract to re-create his designs with Rei Kawakubo, an avant-garde Japanese designer under her Comme des Garcons label. Some designs were reissued under the Peggy Moffitt/Comme des Garçons label. In 2012, Women&#x27;s Wear Daily reported that a German investor had committed to reissuing some of Gernreich&#x27;s designs.

The New York Metropolitan Museum of Art contains more than 100 pieces of Gernreich&#x27;s designs in its collection.

A knit coat dress was sold at auction for $1,245 in 2008 at Christie&#x27;s. Doyle&#x27;s holds the record for Gernreich, set in 2002: $8,500 for two minidresses with peekaboo vinyl inserts. On October 30, 2008, one of Gernreich&#x27;s original retail monokini was auctioned by Christie&#x27;s for £1,250 ($2,075).

<text>Zveno (), &quot;Politicheski krag &quot;Zveno&quot;&quot;, officially Political Circle &quot;Zveno&quot; was a Bulgarian political organization, founded in 1930 by Bulgarian politicians, intellectuals and Bulgarian Army officers. It was associated with a newspaper of that name.

As a palingenetic nationalist movement, &quot;Zveno&quot; advocated for rationalization of Bulgaria&#x27;s economic and political institutions under a dictatorship that would be independent from both the Soviet Union and the Axis powers. They strongly opposed the Bulgarian party system, which they saw as dysfunctional, and the terror of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), the Bulgarian Macedonians&#x27; liberation movement. &quot;Zveno&quot; was also closely linked to the so-called Military League, the organization behind a coup in 1923, responsible for killing Prime Minister Aleksandar Stamboliyski.

In 1934, pro-&quot;Zveno&quot; officers like Colonel Damyan Velchev and Colonel Kimon Georgiev seized power. Georgiev became prime minister. They dissolved all parties, political organizations and trade unions and openly attacked the IMRO. As a political organization itself, Zveno dissolved itself. The new government introduced a corporatist economy, similar to that of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italy. As a nationalist organization, Zveno changed many of the Ottoman-era Turkish place names of villages and towns in Bulgaria to Bulgarian ones. King Boris III, an opponent of &quot;Zveno&quot;, orchestrated a coup through a monarchist &quot;Zveno&quot; member, General Pencho Zlatev, who became Prime Minister (January 1935). In April 1935, he was replaced by a civilian, Andrey Toshev, also a monarchist. After participating in the Bulgarian coup d&#x27;état of 1934, Zveno supporters declared their intention to immediately form an alliance with France and to seek the unification of Bulgaria into an Integral Yugoslavia. Zveno supported an Integral Yugoslavia that included Bulgaria as well as Albania within it.

In 1943, &quot;Zveno&quot; joined the anti-Axis resistance movement, the Fatherland Front. In September 1944, the Fatherland Front engineered a coup d&#x27;état. Georgiev became prime minister and Velchev Minister of Defense, and they managed to sign a ceasefire agreement with the Soviet Union.

In 1946, Velchev resigned in protest against communist actions, while Georgiev was succeeded by communist leader Georgi Dimitrov, after which Bulgaria became a People&#x27;s Republic. Georgiev remained in government until 1962, but &quot;Zveno&quot; was disbanded as an autonomous organization in 1949. &quot;Zveno&quot; continued to exist within the Fatherland Front but was only a puppet organization by then.

<text>Celastrus, commonly known as staff vine, staff tree or bittersweet, is the type genus of the family Celastraceae; it contains over 40 species of shrubs and vines, which have a wide distribution in East Asia, Australasia, Africa, and the Americas.

==Description==
The leaves are alternate and simple, ovoid, and typically long. The flowers are small, white, pink or greenish, and borne in long panicles; the fruit is a three-valved berry.

In North America, they are known as bittersweet, presumably a result of confusion with the unrelated bittersweet (&quot;Solanum dulcamara&quot;) by early colonists. &quot;C. orbiculatus&quot; is a serious invasive weed in much of eastern North America.

<text>Mahadevi Verma (26 March 1907 – 11 September 1987) was an Indian Hindi-language poet, essayist, sketch story writer and an eminent personality of Hindi literature. She is considered one of the four major pillars of the &quot;Chhayawadi&quot; era in Hindi literature. She has also been addressed as the modern Meera. Poet Nirala had once called her &quot;Saraswati in the vast temple of Hindi Literature&quot;. Verma witnessed India before and after its independence. She was one of those poets who worked for the wider society of India. Her poetry, along with her work towards social upliftment and women&#x27;s welfare, were depicted in her writings. These works, especially her anthology Deepshikha, greatly influenced both readers and critics.

She developed a soft vocabulary in the Hindi poetry of Khadi Boli, which before her was considered possible only in Braj Bhasha. She was also well-versed in music, and her songs were characterised by a tone that conveyed sharp expressions in a nuanced and euphemistic style. She started her career as a teacher, and went on to become the principal of Prayag Mahila Vidyapeeth. Verma chose to live an ascetic life, despite being married. She was also a skilled painter and creative translator. She had the distinction of receiving all the important awards in Hindi literature. As the most popular female litterateur of the last century, she remained revered throughout her life. Her birth centenary was celebrated in 2007. Later, Google also celebrated this day through its Google Doodle.

== Life and education ==

=== Early life ===
Verma was born on 26 March 1907 in a Hindu Chitraguptavanshi Kayastha family of Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh, India. Her father, Govind Prasad Verma was a college professor in Bhagalpur. Her mother&#x27;s name was Hem Rani Devi; a religious, passionate, and vegetarian woman with a keen interest in music. Her mother would spend hours reciting Ramayana, Gita and &quot;Vinay Patrika&quot;. In contrast, her father was a scholar, music lover, atheist, hunting enthusiast, and cheerful person. Sumitranandan Pant and Suryakant Tripathi &quot;Nirala&quot; were close friends of Mahadevi Varma. It is said that for 40 years Varma tied Rakhi to Nirala.

=== Education ===
Verma was originally admitted to a Convent school, but upon protests and an unwilling attitude, she was admitted to Crosthwaite Girls College in Prayagraj (then Allahabad). According to Verma, she learned the strength of unity while staying in the hostel at Crosthwaite. Students of different religions lived together there. Verma started to write poems secretly; but upon discovery of her hidden stash of poems by her roommate and senior Subhadra Kumari Chauhan (known in the school for writing poems), her hidden talent was exposed.

She and Subhadra would also send poems to publications such as weekly magazines and managed to get some of their poems published. Both the budding poets also attended poetry seminars, where they met eminent Hindi poets, and read out their poems to the audience. This partnership continued until Subhrada graduated from Crosthwaite.

In her childhood biography &quot;Mere Bachpan Ke Din&quot; (My Childhood Days), Verma has written that she was very fortunate to be born into a liberal family at a time when a girl child was considered to be a burden upon the family. Her grandfather reportedly had the ambition of making her a scholar; although he insisted that she comply with tradition and marry at the age of nine. Her mother was fluent both in Sanskrit and Hindi, and was a very religious and pious lady. Mahadevi credits her mother for inspiring her to write poems and to take an interest in literature.

Having been wed as a child, Mahadevi was expected to go live with her husband following her graduation in 1929, which she refused as she found his hunting and meat-eating offensive. Her remorseful father offered to convert along with her if she wanted to divorce and remarry (as Hindus could not legally divorce at the time) but she refused, saying she wanted to remain single. She even unsuccessfully tried to convince her husband to remarry. Later, she reportedly considered becoming a Buddhist nun but eventually chose not to, although she studied Buddhist Pali and Prakrit texts as part of her master&#x27;s degree.

== Professional career ==

=== Literary ===
&quot;Nihar&quot; (IPA: Nīhār) was her debut collection of poems. In 1930, &quot;Nihar&quot;, in 1932, &quot;Rashmi&quot;, in 1933, &quot;Neerja&quot; were composed by her. In 1935, her collection of poems called &quot;Sandhyageet&quot; was published. In 1939, four poetic collections were published with their artworks under the title &quot;Yama&quot;. Apart from these, she had written 18 novels and short stories in which &quot;Mera Parivar&quot; (My Family), &quot;Smriti ki Rekhaye&quot; (Lines of Memory), &quot;Patha ke Sathi&quot; (Path&#x27;s Companions), &quot;Srinkhala ke Kariye&quot; (Series of Links) and &quot;Atit ke Chalachrit&quot; (Past Movies) are prominent. She is also considered the pioneer of feminism in India.

=== Women&#x27;s advocacy ===

Varma&#x27;s career had always revolved around writing, editing, and teaching. She contributed significantly to the development of Prayag Mahila Vidyapeeth in Allahabad . This kind of responsibility was considered a revolutionary step in the field of women&#x27;s education at the time. She also had been its Principal. In 1923, she took over the women&#x27;s leading magazine &quot;Chand&quot;. In the year 1955, Varma established the Literary Parliament in Allahabad with the help of Ilachandra Joshi, and took up the editorship of its publication. She laid the foundation for women&#x27;s poets&#x27; conferences in India. Mahadevi was greatly influenced by Buddhism. Under the influence of Mahatma Gandhi, she took up public service and worked in Jhansi alongside the Indian freedom struggle. 

In 1937, Mahadevi Varma built a house in the village of &quot;Umagarh&quot;, Ramgarh, Uttarakhand, 25  km from Nainital. She named it Meera Temple. She started working for the village people and their education till she stayed there. She did a lot of work, especially for women&#x27;s education and their economic self-sufficiency. Today, this bungalow is known as Mahadevi Sahitya Museum. In the series of attempts, she was able to raise the courage and determination for the liberation and development of women. 

The way she has condemned social stereotypes made her to be known as a woman liberationist. She had also been called a social reformer due to the development work and public service towards women and their education. Throughout her creations, there are no visions of pain or anguish anywhere, but the indomitable creative fury reflected in the society&#x27;s indomitable desire for change and an innate attachment towards development.

In &quot;Hindu Stree Ka Patnitva&quot; (The Wife-hood of Hindu Women) marriage is compared to slavery. Not being affiliated with any political or financial authority, she writes, women are assigned to lives of being wives and mothers. Her feminism is often overshadowed by her poetic persona. Through poems like &quot;Cha&quot;, she explored themes and ideas of female sexuality, while her short stories such as &quot;Biblia&quot;, discuss the subject of experiences of women&#x27;s physical and mental abuse.

She spent most of her life in Allahabad (Prayagraj) of Uttar Pradesh. She died in Allahabad on 11 September 1987.

== Critical analysis ==

A section of critics is those who believe that the poetry of Mahadevi is very personal. Her agony, anguish, and compassion, are artificial.

Moral critics like Ramchandra Shukla have put a question mark on the truth of her anguish and feelings. He quotes: On the other hand, Hazari Prasad Dwivedi considered her poetry to be a collective criterion of emotions. Poetic works like &quot;Deep&quot; from (Nihar), &quot;Madhur Madhur Mere Deepak Jal&quot; from (Neerja) and &quot;Mome Sa Tan Gal Hai&quot;, concludes that these poems not only explain Mahadevi&#x27;s self-centeredness but also to be considered a representative form of general posture and texture of her poems. Satyaprakash Mishra says about her philosophy of metaphysics related to cinematography: 

American novelist David Rubin has said the following about her works:
Prabhakar Shrotriya believes that those who consider her a poet of anguish and despair do not know how much fire there is in that suffering which exposes the truth of life. He says: Varma&#x27;s poetic world indeed comes under the shadow of Chhayavaad (shadows), but to see her poetry completely unconnected to her era, one would be doing injustice to her. Mahadevi was also a conscious writer. During the Bengal famine in 1973, she published a poetry collection and also wrote a poem called &quot;Banga Bhu Shanth Vandana&quot; related to Bengal. Similarly, in response to the invasion of China, she had edited a collection of poems called &quot;Himalaya&quot;.

== Honours and awards ==

* 1956: Padma Bhushan
*1979: Sahitya Akademi Fellowship
*1982: Jnanpith Award for her poetry collection Yāmā.
*1988: Padma Vibhushan

In 1979, the famous Indian filmmaker Mrinal Sen produced a Bengali film on her memoir &quot;Woh Chini Bhai,&quot; titled Neel Akasher Neechey. On 14 September 1991, the Postal Department of the Government of India issued a doubles stamp of 2 honouring her and Jaishankar Prasad.

==Literary contributions==

The emergence of Mahadevi Varma in literature happened at a time when the shape of Khadi Boli was being refined. She introduced Braj bhasha softness to Hindi poetry. She gave us a repository of songs with a heartfelt acceptance of Indian philosophy. In this way, she did important work in the three fields of language, literature and philosophy which later influenced an entire generation. She created a unique rhythm and simplicity in the composition and language of her songs, as well as the natural use of symbols and images that draw a picture in the mind of the reader. Her contribution to the prosperity of Chhayavadi poetry is very important. While Jaishankar Prasad gave naturalization to the Chhayavadi poetry, Suryakant Tripathi &quot;Nirala&quot; embodied the liberation in it and Sumitranandan Pant brought the art of delicateness, but Varma embodied life to the Chhayavadi poetry. The most prominent feature of her poetry is emotionalism and intensity of feeling. A such lively and tangible manifestation of the subtlest subtle expressions of the heart makes &#x27;Varma&#x27; among the best Chhayavadi poets. She is remembered with respect for her speeches in Hindi. Her speeches were full of compassion for the common man and firm in the truth. At the 3rd World Hindi Conference held in Delhi in 1983, she was the chief guest of the closing ceremony.

Apart from the original creations, she was also a creative translator, with works like her translation of &quot;Saptaparna&quot; (1980). With the help of her cultural consciousness, she has presented 39 selected important pieces of Hindi poetry in her work by establishing the identity of Vedas, Ramayana, Theragatha and the works of Ashwaghosh, Kalidas, Bhavabhuti and Jayadeva. In the beginning, in the 61-page &quot;Apna Baat&quot;, she gives thorough research with this invaluable heritage of Indian wisdom and literature, which enriches the overall thinking and fine writing of Hindi, not just limited female writing.

<doc id="501722" wikidata="Q222982" url="?curid=501722" title="Flying ace">
<text>A flying ace, fighter ace or air ace is a military aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft during aerial combat. The exact number of aerial victories required to officially qualify as an ace is varied but is usually considered to be five or more.

The concept of the &quot;ace&quot; emerged in 1915 during World War I, at the same time as aerial dogfighting. It was a propaganda term intended to provide the home front with a cult of the hero in what was otherwise a war of attrition. The individual actions of aces were widely reported and the image was disseminated of the ace as a chivalrous knight reminiscent of a bygone era. For a brief early period when air-to-air combat was just being invented, the exceptionally skilled pilot could shape the battle in the skies. For most of the war, however, the image of the ace had little to do with the reality of air warfare, in which fighters fought in formation and air superiority depended heavily on the relative availability of resources. The use of the term ace to describe these pilots began in World War I, when French newspapers described Adolphe Pégoud, as (the ace) after he became the first pilot to down five German aircraft. The British initially used the term &quot;star-turns&quot; (a show business term).

The successes of such German ace pilots as Max Immelmann and Oswald Boelcke, and especially Manfred von Richthofen, the most victorious fighter pilot of the First World War, were well-publicized for the benefit of civilian morale, and the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;, Prussia&#x27;s highest award for gallantry, became part of the uniform of a leading German ace. In the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;, the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot; was nicknamed &quot;Der blaue Max&quot;/The Blue Max, after Max Immelmann, who was the first pilot to receive this award. Initially, German aviators had to destroy eight Allied aircraft to receive this medal. As the war progressed, the qualifications for &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot; were raised, but successful German fighter pilots continued to be hailed as national heroes for the remainder of the war.

The few aces among combat aviators have historically accounted for the majority of air-to-air victories in military history.

==History==
===World War I===

World War I introduced the systematic use of true single-seat fighter aircraft, with enough speed and agility to catch and maintain contact with targets in the air, coupled with armament sufficiently powerful to destroy the targets. Aerial combat became a prominent feature with the Fokker Scourge, in the last half of 1915. This was also the beginning of a long-standing trend in warfare, showing statistically that approximately five percent of combat pilots account for the majority of air-to-air victories.

As the German fighter squadrons usually fought well within German lines, it was practicable to establish and maintain very strict guidelines for the official recognition of victory claims by German pilots. Shared victories were either credited to one of the pilots concerned or to the unit as a whole – the destruction of the aircraft had to be physically confirmed by locating its wreckage, or an independent witness to the destruction had to be found. Victories were also counted for aircraft forced down within German lines, as this usually resulted in the death or capture of the enemy aircrew.

Allied fighter pilots fought mostly in German-held airspace and were often not in a position to confirm that an enemy aircraft had crashed, so these victories were frequently claimed as &quot;driven down&quot;, &quot;forced to land&quot;, or &quot;out of control&quot; (called &quot;probables&quot; in later wars). These victories were usually included in a pilot&#x27;s totals and citations for decorations.

The British high command considered the praise of fighter pilots to be detrimental to equally brave bombers and reconnaissance aircrew – so that the British air services did not publish official statistics on the successes of individuals. Nonetheless, some pilots did become famous through press coverage, making the British system for the recognition of successful fighter pilots much more informal and somewhat inconsistent. One pilot, Arthur Gould Lee, described his own score in a letter to his wife as &quot;Eleven, five by me solo — the rest shared&quot;, adding that he was &quot;miles from being an ace&quot;. This shows that his No. 46 Squadron RAF counted shared kills, but separately from &quot;solo&quot; ones—one of a number of factors that seems to have varied from unit to unit. Also evident is that Lee considered a higher figure than five kills to be necessary for &quot;ace&quot; status. Aviation historians credit him as an ace with two enemy aircraft destroyed and five driven down out of control, for a total of seven victories.

Other Allied countries, such as France and Italy, fell somewhere in between the very strict German approach and the relatively casual British one. They usually demanded independent witnessing of the destruction of an aircraft, making confirmation of victories scored in enemy territory very difficult. The Belgian crediting system sometimes included &quot;out of control&quot; to be counted as a victory.

The United States Army Air Service adopted French standards for evaluating victories, with two exceptions – during the summer 1918, while flying under the operational control of the British, the 17th Aero Squadron and the 148th Aero Squadron used British standards. American newsmen, in their correspondence to their papers, decided that five victories were the minimum needed to become an ace.

While &quot;ace&quot; status was generally won only by fighter pilots, bombers and reconnaissance crews on both sides also destroyed some enemy aircraft, typically in defending themselves from attack. The most notable example of a non-pilot ace in World War I is Charles George Gass with 39 accredited aerial victories.

===Between the world wars===
Between the two world wars two conflicts produced flying aces, the Spanish Civil War and the Second Sino-Japanese War.

The Spanish ace Joaquín García Morato scored 40 victories for the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War. Part of the outside intervention in the war was the supply of &quot;volunteer&quot; foreign pilots to both sides. Russian and American aces joined the Republican air force, while the Nationalists included Germans and Italians.

The Soviet Volunteer Group began operations in the Second Sino-Japanese War as early as December 2, 1937, resulting in 28 Soviet aces. The Flying Tigers were American military pilots who were recruited sub rosa to aid the Chinese Nationalists. They spent the summer and autumn of 1941 in transit to China, and did not begin flying combat missions until December 20, 1941.

===World War II===

In World War II many air forces adopted the British practice of crediting fractional shares of aerial victories, resulting in fractions or decimal scores, such as or 26.83. Some U.S. commands also credited aircraft destroyed on the ground as equal to aerial victories. The Soviets distinguished between solo and group kills, as did the Japanese, though the Imperial Japanese Navy stopped crediting individual victories (in favor of squadron tallies) in 1943.

The Soviet Air Forces has the top Allied pilots in terms of aerial victories, Ivan Kozhedub credited with 66 victories and Alexander Pokryshkin scored 65 victories. It also claimed the only female aces of the war: Lydia Litvyak scored 12 victories and Yekaterina Budanova achieved 11. The highest scoring pilots from the Western allies against the German Luftwaffe were Johnnie Johnson (RAF, 38 kills) and Gabby Gabreski (USAAF, 28 kills in the air and 3 on the ground). In the Pacific theater Richard Bong became the top American fighter ace with 40 kills. In the Mediterranean theater Pat Pattle achieved at least 40 kills, mainly against Italian planes, and became the top fighter ace of the British Commonwealth in the war. Fighting on different sides, the French pilot Pierre Le Gloan had the unusual distinction of shooting down four German, seven Italian and seven British aircraft, the latter while he was flying for Vichy France in Syria.

The German Luftwaffe continued the tradition of &quot;one pilot, one kill&quot;, and now referred to top scorers as &quot;Experten&quot;. Some Luftwaffe pilots achieved very high scores, such as Erich Hartmann (352 kills) or Gerhard Barkhorn (301 kills). There were 107 German pilots with more than 100 kills. Most of these were won against the Soviet Air Force. The highest scoring fighter ace against Western allied forces were Hans-Joachim Marseille (158 kills) and Heinz Bär (208 kills, of which 124 in the west). Notable are also Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer, with 121 kills the highest-scoring night-fighter ace, and Werner Mölders, the first pilot to claim more than 100 kills in the history of aerial warfare. Pilots of other Axis powers also achieved high scores, such as Ilmari Juutilainen (Finnish Air Force, 94 kills), Constantin Cantacuzino (Romanian Air Force, 69 kills) or Mato Dukovac (Croatian Air Force, 44 kills). The highest scoring Japanese fighter pilot was Tetsuzō Iwamoto, who achieved 216 kills. 

A number of factors probably contributed to the very high totals of the top German aces. For a limited period (especially during Operation Barbarossa), many Axis victories were over obsolescent aircraft and either poorly trained or inexperienced Allied pilots. In addition, Luftwaffe pilots generally flew many more individual sorties (sometimes well over 1000) than their Allied counterparts. Moreover, they often kept flying combat missions until they were captured, incapacitated, or killed, while successful Allied pilots were usually either promoted to positions involving less combat flying or routinely rotated back to training bases to pass their valuable combat knowledge to younger pilots. An imbalance in the number of targets available also contributed to the apparently lower numbers on the Allied side, since the number of operational Luftwaffe fighters was normally well below 1,500, with the total aircraft number never exceeding 5,000, and the total aircraft production of the Allies being nearly triple that of the other side. A difference in tactics might have been a factor as well; Erich Hartmann, for example, stated &quot;See if there is a straggler or an uncertain pilot among the enemy... Shoot him down&quot;, which would have been an efficient and relatively low-risk way of increasing the number of kills. At the same time, the Soviet 1943 &quot;Instruction For Air Combat&quot; stated that the first priority must be the enemy commander, which was a much riskier task, but one giving the highest return in case of a success.

===Post-World War II aces===
====Korean War====
The Korean War of 1950–53 marked the transition from piston-engined propeller driven aircraft to more modern jet aircraft. As such, it saw the world&#x27;s first jet-vs-jet aces. The highest scoring ace of the war is considered to be the Soviet pilot Nikolai Sutyagin who claimed 22 kills.

====Vietnam War====

The Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force had begun development of its modern air-forces, primarily trained by Czechoslovak and Soviet trainers since 1956. The outbreak of the largest sustained bombardment campaign in history prompted rapid deployment of the nascent air-force, and the first engagement of the war was in April 1965 at Thanh Hóa Bridge which saw relatively outdated subsonic MiG-17 units thrown against technically superior F-105 Thunderchief and F-8 Crusader, damaging 1 F-8 and killing two F-105 jets. The MiG-17 generally did not have sophisticated radars and missiles and relied on dog-fighting and maneuverability to score kills on US aircraft. Since US aircraft heavily outnumbered North Vietnamese ones, the Warsaw Pact and others had begun arming North Vietnam with MiG-21 jets. The VPAF had adopted a strategy of &quot;guerrilla warfare in the sky&quot; utilizing quick hit-and-run attacks against US targets, continually flying low and forcing faster, more heavily armed US jets to engage in dog-fighting where the MiG-17 and MiG-21 had superior maneuverability. The VPAF had carried out the first air-raid on US ships since WW2, with two aces including Nguyễn Văn Bảy attacking US ships during the Battle of Đồng Hới in 1972. Quite often air-to-air losses of US fighter jets were re-attributed to surface-to-air missiles, as it was considered &quot;less embarrassing&quot;. By the war&#x27;s end, the US had nevertheless confirmed 249 air-to-air US aircraft losses while the figures for North Vietnam are disputed, ranging from 195 North Vietnamese aircraft from US claims to 131 from Soviet, North Vietnamese and allied records.

American air-to-air combat during the Vietnam War generally matched intruding United States fighter-bombers against radar-directed integrated North Vietnamese air defense systems. American F-4 Phantom II, F-8 Crusader and F-105 fighter crews usually had to contend with surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft artillery, and machine gun fire before opposing fighters attacked them. The long-running conflict produced 22 aces: 17 North Vietnamese pilots, two American pilots, three American weapon systems officers or WSOs (WSO is the USAF designation, one of the three was actually a US Naval aviator, with an equivalent job, but using the USN designation of Radar Intercept Officer or RIO).

====Arab–Israeli war====

The series of wars and conflicts between Israel and its neighbors began with Israeli independence in 1948 and continued for over three decades.

====Iran–Iraq war====
Brig. General Jalil Zandi (1951–2001) was an ace fighter pilot in the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force, serving for the full duration of the Iran–Iraq War. His record of eight confirmed and three probable victories against Iraqi combat aircraft qualifies him as an ace and the most successful pilot of that conflict and the most successful Grumman F-14 Tomcat pilot worldwide.

Brig. General Shahram Rostami was another Iranian ace. He was also an F-14 pilot. He had six confirmed kills. His victories include one MiG-21, two MiG-25s, and three Mirage F1s.

Colonel Mohammed Rayyan was an Iraqi ace fighter pilot who shot down 10 Iranian aircraft, mostly F-4 Phantoms during the war.

==== Indo-Pakistan War ====
Air Commodore Muhammad Mahmood Alam was an ace fighter pilot in the Pakistan Air Force. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Alam claimed to have downed five aircraft in a single sortie on 7 September 1965 with four downed in less than a minute, establishing a world record. These claims, however, have been widely contested by Indian Air Force officials.

==== Russo-Ukrainian War====
On 13 October 2022, the Ukrainian government claims that Ukrainian pilot Vadym Voroshylov shot down 5 Shahed 136 drones before being forced to eject from his MiG-29 aircraft after it was hit by debris from the last Shahed-136 that had shot down. Voroshylov had shot down two Russian cruise missiles the day prior.

According to the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, during the fighting in Ukraine, Lieutenant Colonel Ilya Sizov &quot;destroyed 12 Ukrainian aircraft (3 Su-24 aircraft, 3 Su-27 aircraft, 3 MiG-29 aircraft, 2 Mi-24 helicopters, 1 Mi-14 helicopter) and two Buk-M1 anti-aircraft missile complexes.

==== Red Sea crisis ====
In February 2024, it was reported that Captain Earl Ehrhart V of the United States Marine Corps had shot down seven Houthi drones while piloting an AV-8B Harrier II ground-attack aircraft from the amphibious assault ship USS &quot;Bataan&quot;.

==Accuracy==
Realistic assessment of enemy casualties is important for intelligence purposes, so most air forces expend considerable effort to ensure accuracy in victory claims. In World War II, the aircraft gun camera came into general usage by the Luftwaffe as well as the RAF and USAAF, partly in hope of alleviating inaccurate victory claims.

=== World War I aerial victory accuracy ===

In World War I the standards for confirmation of aerial victories were developed. The most strict were the German and French ones which required both the existence of traceable wrecks or observations of independent observers. In contrast to this, the British system also accepted single claims of the pilots and deeds such as enemy planes &quot;out of control&quot;, &quot;driven down&quot; and &quot;forced to land&quot;. Aerial victories were also divided among different pilots. This led to vast overclaims on the British and partially on the US American side. Some air forces, such as the USAAF, also included kills on the ground as victories.

The most accurate figures usually belong to the air arm fighting over its own territory, where many wrecks can be located, and even identified, and where shot down enemy aircrews are either killed or captured. It is for this reason that at least 76 of the 80 aircraft credited to Manfred von Richthofen can be tied to known British losses. The German Jagdstaffeln flew defensively, on their own side of the lines, in part due to General Hugh Trenchard&#x27;s policy of offensive patrol.

=== World War II aerial victory accuracy ===

In World War II overclaims were a common problem. Nearly 50% of Royal Air Force (RAF) victories in the Battle of Britain, for instance, do not tally statistically with recorded German losses; but at least some of this apparent over-claiming can be tallied with known wrecks, and German aircrew known to have been in British PoW camps. An overclaim of about 2-3 was common on all sides, and Soviet overclaims were sometimes higher. The claims of the Luftwaffe pilots are considered as mostly reasonable and more accurate than those according to the British and American system.

To quote an extreme example, in the Korean War, both the U.S. and Communist air arms claimed a 10-to-1 victory/loss ratio.

==Non-pilot aces==
While aces are generally thought of exclusively as fighter pilots, some have accorded this status to gunners on bombers or reconnaissance aircraft, observers in two-seater fighters such as the early Bristol F.2b, and navigators/weapons officers in jet aircraft such as the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. Because pilots often teamed with different air crew members, an observer or gunner might be an ace while his pilot is not, or vice versa. Observer aces constitute a sizable minority in many lists. 

In World War I, the observer Gottfried Ehmann of the German &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; was credited with 12 kills, for which he was awarded the Golden Military Merit Cross. In the Royal Flying Corps the observer Charles George Gass tallied 39 victories, of which 5 were actually confirmed. The spread was caused by the lavish British system of aerial victory confirmation.

In World War II, United States Army Air Forces S/Sgt. Michael Arooth, a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress tail gunner serving in the 379th Bombardment Group, was credited with 19 kills and the Consolidated B-24 Liberator gunner Arthur J. Benko (374th Bombardment Squadron) with 16 kills. The Royal Air Force&#x27;s leading bomber gunner, Wallace McIntosh, was credited with eight kills while serving as a rear turret gunner on Avro Lancasters, including three on one mission. Flight Sergeant F. J. Barker contributed to 12 victories while flying as a gunner in a Boulton Paul Defiant turret-equipped fighter piloted by Flight Sergeant E. R. Thorne. On the German side, Erwin Hentschel, the Junkers Ju 87 rear gunner of Luftwaffe pilot and anti-tank ace Hans-Ulrich Rudel, had 7 confirmed kills. The crew of the bomber pilot Otto Köhnke from &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 3 is credited with the destruction of 11 enemy fighters (6 French, 1 British, 4 Soviet).

With the advent of more advanced technology, a third category of ace appeared. Charles B. DeBellevue became not only the first U.S. Air Force weapon systems officer (WSO) to become an ace but also the top American ace of the Vietnam War, with six victories. Close behind with five were fellow WSO Jeffrey Feinstein and Radar Intercept Officer William P. Driscoll.

==Ace in a day==

The first military aviators to score five or more victories on the same date, thus each becoming an &quot;ace in a day&quot;, were pilot Julius Arigi and observer/gunner Johann Lasi of the Austro-Hungarian air force, on August 22, 1916, when they downed five Italian aircraft. The feat was repeated five more times during World War I.

Becoming an ace in a day became relatively common during World War II. A total of 68 U.S. pilots (43 Army Air Forces, 18 Navy, and seven Marine Corps pilots) were credited with the feat, including legendary test pilot Chuck Yeager.

In the Soviet offensive of 1944 in the Karelian Isthmus, Finnish pilot Hans Wind shot down 30 Soviet aircraft in 12 days with his Bf 109 G. In doing so, he obtained &quot;ace in a day&quot; status three times.

During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Pakistani pilot Muhammad Mahmood Alam claimed to have downed five aircraft in a single sortie on 7 September 1965 with four downed in less than a minute, establishing a world record. According to some sources Alam is the only ace-in-a-day achiever in the jet age. These claims, however, have been contested by the Indian Air Force.

<doc id="501723" wikidata="Q387587" url="?curid=501723" title="Takifugu">
<text>Takifugu, also known by the Japanese name , is a genus of pufferfish with 25 species, most of which are native to salt and brackish waters of the northwest Pacific, but a few species are found in freshwater in Asia or more widely in the Indo-Pacific region. Their diet consists mostly of algae, molluscs, invertebrates and sometimes crustaceans.

The fish contains lethal amounts of the poison tetrodotoxin in the internal organs, especially the liver and the ovaries, but also in the skin and the testes. The poison paralyzes the muscles while the victim stays fully conscious, and eventually dies from asphyxiation. There is currently no antidote, and the standard medical approach is to try to support the respiratory and circulatory system until the effect of the poison wears off.

==Distribution and conservation status==
There are 25 species belonging to the genus &quot;Takifugu&quot;. Most species are restricted to salt and brackish waters of the northwest Pacific, but a few occur more widely in the Indo-Pacific region or in freshwater of Asia. Although several are euryhaline (can adapt to various salinities) to some extent, most are unable to live in freshwater. Two exceptions are the anadromous &quot;Takifugu obscurus&quot; and the &quot;Takifugu ocellatus&quot;, which lives in coastal marine waters but migrates into fresh water to spawn in rivers.

Most species in the genus are not considered threatened, but there are two notable exceptions: the critically endangered &quot;Takifugu chinensis&quot; and the endangered &quot;Takifugu plagiocellatus&quot;.

&quot;Takifugu rubripes&quot; serves as a model organism in biological research.

==Morphology and behaviour==
Not all &quot;Takifugu&quot; have been studied in detail, but the most researched species is &quot;Takifugu rubripes&quot;, due to the commercial farming of this fish for human consumption. &quot;Takifugu rubripes&quot;, for example, breeds from March to May and lays eggs attached to rocks at a depth of around . As far as known, most species live exclusively in marine and brackish water, also breeding in this habitat. The anadromous &quot;Takifugu obscurus&quot; migrates from its coastal marine habitat into fresh water to spawn. An even more exceptional and unique breeding behavior is displayed by &quot;Takifugu niphobles&quot;. They gather in groups at certain beaches, throw themselves onto land where fertilization happens and then return to the water. The eggs either float back into the water or may stay on land under rocks for a period, only hatching when again submerged by high tide. This breeding behavior is unique among pufferfish, but found in a few other unrelated fish like capelin and grunion.

Fugu can also change color over time. This helps them to camouflage.

==Toxicity==
The fish&#x27;s main defense is the neurotoxin contained in its internal organs, mainly the ovaries and the liver, to a lesser extent in the intestines and the skin, and only minute amounts in the muscles and blood. This makes the fugu a lethal meal for most predators, including the occasional human.

The toxin is called tetrodotoxin, or more precisely &quot;anhydrotetrodotoxin 4-epitetrodotoxin&quot; and is about 1200 times deadlier than cyanide. This poison can also be found in other animals such as the blue-ringed octopus, cone snails, and even some newts. The pufferfish does not create the poison itself; rather it is generated by bacteria e.g. &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; within the fish. The fish obtains the bacteria by eating food containing these bacteria. Pufferfish that are born and grown in captivity do not produce tetrodotoxin until they receive some of the poison-producing bacteria, often by eating tissues from a toxin-producing fish. Also, some fish are more poisonous than others. Each fish has enough poison to kill around thirty adult humans.

==Genome==
Apparently due to some unknown selection pressure, intronic and extragenic sequences have been drastically reduced within this family. As a result, they have the smallest-known genomes yet found amongst the vertebrate animals, while containing a genetic repertoire very similar to other fishes and thus comparable to vertebrates generally. Since these genomes are relatively compact it is relatively fast and inexpensive to compile their complete sequences, as has been done for two species of pufferfishes (&quot;Takifugu rubripes&quot; and &quot;Tetraodon nigroviridis&quot;). The former species was the second vertebrate in history to have its genome mapped, after humans.

==Species==
, there are 25 recognized species in the genus &quot;Takifugu&quot;:

<text>Suryakant Tripathi (21 February 1899 – 15 October 1961) was an Indian poet, writer, composer, and sketch artist who wrote in Hindi. He is considered one of the four major pillars of the Chhayavad period in Hindi literature. He is renowned with the epithet Mahāprāṇ and his pen name Nirālā.

He possessed a mastery of traditional poetic meters, with many of his compositions adhering to these forms. Additionally, he revolutionised Hindi poetry by pioneering the use of free verse, becoming the first Hindi poet to do so. He demonstrated to readers that poetry could retain its poetic essence and rhythm even without rhyming lines.

He experienced a tumultuous life, marred by family losses and societal hardships. His writings, marked by a deep affinity with nature and a critique of social injustices, established him as a prominent figure in Chhayavadi and subsequent poetic movements, connecting traditional and contemporary themes. His dedication to social reform and literary creativity highlights his significant impact on modern Hindi literature.

== Biography ==
Tripathi was born on 21 February 1899 at Mahishadal in Midnapore in Bengal Presidency into a Kanyakubja Brahmin family. Nirala&#x27;s father, Pandit Ramsahaya Tripathi, was a government servant and was a tyrannical person. His mother died when he was very young. Nirala was educated in the Bengali medium at Mahishadal Raj High School at Mahishadal, a princely state in Purba Medinipur. Subsequently, he shifted to Lucknow and thence to village Gadhakola of Unnao district, to which his father originally belonged. Growing up, he gained inspiration from personalities like Ramakrishna Paramhansa, Swami Vivekananda, and Rabindranath Tagore.

After his marriage at the age of 15, Nirala learned Hindi at the insistence of his wife, Manohara Devi. He independently started deciphering the grammar of modern standard Hindi by studying two Hindi journals available to him in Bengal: Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi&#x27;s influential magazine &quot;Sarasvatī&quot; and &quot;Maryādā&quot;, edited from Varanasi. Soon, he started writing poems in Hindi, instead of Bengali. After a bad childhood, Nirala had a few good years with his wife. But this phase was short-lived as his wife died when he was 22, and later his daughter Saroj also died. Nirala lost half of his family, including his wife and daughter, in the 1918 Spanish flu influenza outbreak.

Most of his life was somewhat in the bohemian tradition. He wrote strongly against social injustice and exploitation in society. Since he was more or less a rebel, both in form and content, acceptance did not come easily. What he got in plenty was ridicule and derision. All these may have played a role in making him a patient of schizophrenia in his later life and he was admitted to Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi.

== Works ==
Nirala&#x27;s early works were shaped by the literary culture of West Bengal and the influence of Rabindranath Tagore. His initial poetry reflects the Bengali Renaissance and Contextual Modernism, aligning with the mystical-romanticism, or Chhayavad, that emerged in Hindi literature in the subsequent decades. Over time, Nirala evolved a distinctive style, diverging from his early influences and exploring a range of literary genres, including free verse.
Nirala&#x27;s poetry illustrated a profound connection with the living spirits of nature. His mystical poems, rich with the devotion of medieval Bhakti poetry, explored nature within a metaphysical framework that aligned with his Advaita beliefs. While the concept of nature as a manifestation of the absolute was common among Chhayavadi poets, Nirala uniquely portrayed the natural world, not only as a female but also as a fundamentally erotic entity, as seen in works such as &quot;Sandhyā Sundarī&quot;, &quot;Jūhī kī kalī&quot;, and &quot;Yāminī jāgī&quot;.

Nirala&#x27;s poetry and prose were also deeply rooted in populism. He aimed to create a society free from exploitation, injustice, and tyranny. This commitment to social reform makes Nirala the only Chhayavadi poet whose works bridge into the poetic movements of the post-Chhayavad period, such as Prayogvad and Pragativad.

His poem Rām kī śakti Pūjā explores selfless action through the struggles of Rama, serving as an allegory for broader themes of resilience and social struggle. Saroj Smriti, written after the untimely death of his daughter Saroj, transcended his emotional outpouring with a deep sense of regret and sadness. Its subdued treatment and pensive dignity elevated it to epic stature, and it remained one of the finest elegies in Hindi literature. 

In &quot;Kukkurumuttā&quot;, he used the metaphor of mushrooms growing in lowly conditions to critique capitalism. This poem, while presenting a light-hearted narrative, contains a critical examination of socio-economic injustices.

Themes of minority subjectivity and social critique are also prominent in Nirala&#x27;s prose writings, such as &quot;Kullī bhāṭ&quot; and &quot;Caturī Camār&quot;. These works critique entrenched hierarchies and caste-bound structures. In &quot;Kullī bhāṭ&quot; he reflects on his personal experiences, including his wife&#x27;s support, his devotion to Saraswati, his encounter with Kulli - a socially disapproved man, and his commitment to Hindi literature, which collectively influenced his progressive and romantic poetics.

Nirala was also a musician who composed songs using the harmonium. His anthology of songs, titled &quot;Gītikā &quot; and published in 1936, features a collection of his musical works. In the preface of this book, he demonstrates his compositional skills and elaborates on the various talas and ragas suitable for his songs. Over time, his works from &quot;Geetika&quot; and other anthologies have been set to music by prominent artists, including those specialising in genres of Hindustani classical music like Dhrupad, and Khayal, as well as popular music artists with a wider appeal.

== Analyses and Translations ==
Ram Vilas Sharma, a prominent literary critic, described Nirala&#x27;s &quot;Rāma kī Śakti Pūjā&quot;, &quot;Tulsīdās&quot;, &quot;Saroj-smṛti&quot;, and &quot;Parimal&quot; as exemplary models of creative criticism. Sharma was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1970 for his scholarly work, &quot;Nirālā kī sāhitya sādhānā&quot;, which is a comprehensive three-part study of Nirala presented at a session of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan.

Another critical analysis of Nirala&#x27;s works is &quot;Nirala: Aatmhanta Astha&quot;, written by Doodhnath Singh, a noted Hindi writer, critic, and poet. 

Many of Nirala&#x27;s poems were translated by David Rubin, and are available in the collections, &#x27;A Season on the Earth: Selected Poems of Nirala&#x27; (Columbia University Press, 1976), included in the UNESCO Representative Works of Indian series;, &#x27;The Return of Sarasvati: Four Hindi Poets&#x27; (Oxford University Press, 1993), and &#x27;Of Love and War: A Chayavad Anthology&#x27; (Oxford University Press, 2005). Nirala&#x27;s literary oeuvre has been the subject of extensive study, with numerous books and research papers continuing to be published today.

== Honors and Legacy ==

Despite his extensive literary contributions, Nirala was not conferred with any civilian or literary awards during his lifetime, possibly due to his rebellious nature and his avoidance of gifts and honours. In 1947, the Nagari Pracharini Sabha commemorated his birth on Vasant Panchami, and the Uttar Pradesh government awarded his collection of poems, &quot;Aparā&quot;, a reward of Rs 2100. Posthumously, in 1970, Nirala was featured on a commemorative postal stamp released by the Government of India to mark his birth anniversary.

In 1998, the Films Division of India produced a 20-minute short documentary film on Nirala&#x27;s life, directed by Rajiv Kumar, which explores his works and achievements.

Doordarshan, the national broadcaster of India, produced a half-hour film titled &quot;Aparājeya Nirālā&quot; (lit. Unvanquished Nirala), focusing on Nirala&#x27;s life. This film included songs based on Nirala&#x27;s poems and featured Kathak recitals by various artists.

In 2016, Kumar Vishwas hosted &quot;Mahākavī&quot;, a television documentary series that premiered on the television channel ABP News. This series aimed to present the life stories, poems, and previously unknown facts about ten legendary Hindi poets of the twentieth century. The third episode was dedicated to Nirala, that featured Saurabh Raj Jain in the role of Nirala and included poems sung by Kumar Vishwas.

Sculptures of Nirala have been installed at various cultural venues across different cities. His bust is located at his final residence in the Daraganj neighbourhood of Allahabad. In front of the central library at Allahabad Central University stands a statue of Nirala. Additionally, a full-sized sculpture is installed at Nirala Chowk in Lucknow, which is named in his honour.

In the Unnao District, a park named &quot;Nirālā Udyān&quot;, an auditorium called &quot;Nirālā Prekṣāgṛha&quot;, and a degree college known as &quot;Mahāprāṇ Nirālā Degree College&quot; have all been named in his honour.

<text>Damyan Velchev or Velcev () (4 March 1883, Gabrovo – 25 January 1954, Paris) was a Bulgarian politician and general.

From 1925 to 1935 he was the leader of the Military League (Bulgaria) (1919–1947), an organization of Bulgarian officers which carried the 1923, 1934 and 1944 coup d&#x27;etats. In 1930 he became a member of the &quot;Zveno&quot; group. In 1934 he led the pro-&quot;Zveno&quot; coup, but did not become a minister and stayed in the background. After King Boris III&#x27;s counter-coup of 1935 Velchev fled abroad, but later slipped back into the country wanting to make another coup d&#x27;état and was arrested. He was sentenced to death in 1936, but Boris spared his life.

In 1943 he joined the Fatherland Front, an anti-Axis resistance movement. In 1944 the Fatherland Front seized power and Velchev became Minister of Defence with the rank of colonel general. He resigned in 1946 because of communist purges within the army. Later he became ambassador to Switzerland as an act by the communists to keep him away from Bulgarian matters, but in 1947 he resigned and asked for political asylum. He remained in Switzerland until his death in France in 1954.

<text>Euonymus is a genus of flowering plants in the staff vine family Celastraceae. Common names vary widely among different species and between different English-speaking countries, but include spindle (or spindle tree), burning-bush, strawberry-bush, wahoo, wintercreeper, or simply euonymus. It has about 140 species of deciduous and evergreen shrubs, small trees and lianas. They are mostly native to East Asia, extending to the Himalayas, and they are also distributed in Europe, Australasia, North America, and Madagascar. Fifty species are endemic to China.

==Description==
The inconspicuous flowers occur in small groups, and can be green, yellow, pink or maroon in color depending on species. The leaves are opposite (rarely alternate) and simple ovoid, typically 2–15 cm long, and usually with a finely serrated margin. The fruit is a pink or white four- or five-valved pod-like berry, which splits open to reveal the fleshy-coated orange or red seeds.

The seeds are eaten by frugivorous birds, which digest the fleshy seed coat and disperse the seeds in their droppings. Many species are used in traditional medicines, and parts of the plants can be poisonous to humans.

==Cultivation and uses==
The wood of some species was traditionally used to make spindles for spinning wool; this use is the origin of the British English name of the shrubs.

Euonymus are popular garden shrubs, grown for their foliage, the deciduous species often exhibiting very bright red autumnal colours, and also for the decorative berries. &quot;Euonymus alatus&quot; (winged euonymus or burning-bush) is considered an invasive species in the woodlands of the northeastern United States.

<text>Sokodé is the second largest city in Togo, with a population of about 189,000. It is a commercial center for the surrounding agricultural areas, and seat of the Tchaoudjo Prefecture and Centrale Region. It is in the center of the country, north of Lomé, between the Mo and Mono rivers. It is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious city, but is dominated by Islam. The ethnic majority are Kotokolis, who live alongside Muslims.

== History ==

Ancient indigenous stock of the region mixed with more recent migrants of Gurma, from the eastern part of the Niger Bend, between Ouagadougou and Niamey, who brought the political system of chiefdoms with them. Added to this structure were Western Sudanic traders and craftsmen (the Mandinka, from historic Mali) and Hausa, a dynamic force since the 16th century. By choosing, in late 1897, to establish an outpost at Sokodé, Germans entrenched the role of the now dominant Kotokoli chiefdoms.

The city developed in precolonial times as a commercial crossroads on the Kola nut route between Ghana and Benin. Currently it is center on the only north-south road in Togo, linking the capital Lomé to Burkina Faso. Urbanization accelerated during colonization. The city consists of older villages that have now become neighborhoods.

Sokodé continues to be governed by a system balanced between a municipal administration and traditional chiefs. Historically, the chiefs of various villages were included in a leadership council, the Tchaoudjo.

==Geography==

Sokodé&#x27;s region is characterized by a dense network of rivers and hilly terrain. The two main rivers are the Kpondjo and Kpandi, which flow into the Na which in turn feeds the Mono River. The border between the Mono and the Volta River drainage basins is located a few kilometers north of the city. It is now in the catchment of the river Mô.

==Demographics==

Sokodé is the city with the highest proportion of Muslims in Togo. 70% of the population is Muslim and the remaining 30% are Christians, mostly Catholics. Sokodé is home to the Tem people and most people in Sokodé speak Kotokoli (or Tem). The ethnonym Kotokoli is the name that was given to these speakers by traders of the Niger Bend. Many other languages are spoken in Togo, especially Ewé, the dominant language of the south, and Kabyé, dominant language of the Kara region, further north. The Kotokoli and Kabyè languages are closely related.

From the standpoint of urban landscape, the city can be divided into two parts: the center, with high density traditional housing, and the suburbs, with housing becoming progressively less dense as one moves away from the center. Modern materials have been increasingly replacing traditional materials (mudbrick).

==Climate==
Situated at an average altitude of , midway between the ocean and the Sahel strip, Sokodé experiences a tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;), with two distinct seasons: the rainy season, which lasts from April to October, peaking from July to September and the dry season from November to March. The rainfall is between per year and the number of rainy days varies between 100 and 130. The average temperature is (1961–1990). The evaporation rate is high, estimated at / year, and is particularly marked in the harmattan period from November to January. The humidity is very variable, and depends on all the above factors.

==Economy==
The economy of Sokodé is dominated by transport, trade and handicrafts. There is little industrial activity, like cotton ginning and sugar processing.

Farmers grow primarily corn, cassava, yams, pepper and beans, and many gardeners and farmers live on the periphery of Sokodé. They have herds of cows in the fields. Meanwhile, nomadic Fulani frequently pass near Sokodé, with their herds of zebu en route between Burkina Faso and Nigeria.

The vegetables are grown especially along the Kpondjo and Inusayo rivers. Most agricultural areas are floodplains, with growers beginning cultivation following the rainy season.

==Culture==

===Festivals===
&quot; &#x27;Gadao-Adossa-Kosso&quot;&#x27;: the main Kotokoli festival consists of three days of festivities, from Friday to Sunday. Celebrated the evening before Adossa, Gadao&#x27;s function is to thank the ancestors for abundant harvests. Adossa, or the Festival of Knives, is an initiation rite originating with Semassi warriors who demonstrate their strength and courage by undergoing physical challenges. The next day is Kosso, the Festival of Women, in which women dance in the Municipal Park in Sokodé City.

Among others, major festivals are held by different Sokodé clans. In most festivals traditional dancers are invited from the region, as well as riders mimicking the Semassi warriors, spinning at full speed in the middle of the crowd.

== Places of worship == 
Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Diocese of Sokodé (Catholic Church), Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Togo (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Togo Baptist Convention (Baptist World Alliance), Living Faith Church Worldwide, Redeemed Christian Church of God, Assemblies of God.

<doc id="501746" wikidata="Q7078789" url="?curid=501746" title="Of Moths and Men">
<text>Of Moths and Men is a book by journalist Judith Hooper about the Oxford University ecological genetics school led by E.B. Ford. The book specifically concerns Bernard Kettlewell&#x27;s experiments on the peppered moth which were intended as experimental validation of evolution. She highlights supposed problems with the methodology of Kettlewell&#x27;s experiments and suggests that these issues could invalidate the results obtained, ignoring or disparaging evidence supporting natural selection while repeatedly implying that Kettlewell and his colleagues committed fraud or made careless errors. Subject matter experts have described the book as presenting a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; with &quot;errors, misrepresentations, misinterpretations and falsehoods&quot;. The evolutionary biologist Michael Majerus spent the last 7 years of his life systematically repeating Kettlewell&#x27;s experiments, demonstrating that Kettlewell had in fact been correct.

== Allegations of poor experimental practice ==
Hooper alleges several flaws in experimental methodology, including gluing the moths in place on parts of trees where they would not naturally settle, feeding birds heavily enough to condition them to expect feeding at that point, artificially boosting recapture rates, altering experiments (unconsciously) to favour the expected outcome, and errors in statistical analysis.

The historian of biology David Rudge has carefully reexamined the records upon which Hooper&#x27;s argument is based. His conclusions were that her historical research was poor and she had shown fundamental misunderstandings about the nature of science.

==Reviews==

The book was described as well-written in reviews in the mainstream press, but it was severely criticised in scientific publications. Writing in &quot;Nature&quot;, Coyne (2002) attacked Hooper&#x27;s &quot;flimsy conspiracy theory [of] ambitious scientists who will ignore the truth for the sake of fame and recognition [by which] she unfairly smears a brilliant naturalist&quot;. In &quot;Science&quot;, Grant (2002) critically summarised the book&#x27;s content, saying &quot;What it delivers is a quasi-scientific assessment of the evidence for natural selection in the peppered moth (&quot;Biston betularia&quot;), much of which is cast in doubt by the author’s relentless suspicion of fraud&quot;. Bryan Clarke, who worked alongside Kettlewell at Oxford, described Hooper&#x27;s book as &quot;a treasury of insinuations worthy of an unscrupulous newspaper&quot;.

The entomologist and expert on peppered moth evolution Michael Majerus described the book as &quot;littered with errors, misrepresentations, misinterpretations and falsehoods&quot;. He spent the last 7 years of his life on research, systematically refuting Hooper&#x27;s claims. Much of the work was published posthumously, the data being reviewed by a team of evolutionary biologists, leading to a vindication of Kettlewell&#x27;s findings, the re-establishment of his reputation, and the restoration of the peppered moth as an exemplar of Darwinian evolution.

<doc id="501748" wikidata="Q304303" url="?curid=501748" title="Cromwell tank">
<text>The Cromwell tank, officially Tank, Cruiser, Mk VIII, Cromwell (A27M), was one of the series of cruiser tanks fielded by Britain in the Second World War. Named after the English Civil War–era military leader Oliver Cromwell, the Cromwell was the first tank put into service by the British to combine high speed from a powerful, reliable engine (the Rolls-Royce Meteor) and reasonable armour. The intended dual-purpose high-velocity gun could not be fitted in the turret, so a medium-velocity dual-purpose gun was fitted instead. Further development of the Cromwell combined with a high-velocity gun led to the Comet tank.

The name &quot;Cromwell&quot; was initially applied to three vehicles during development. Early Cromwell development led to the creation of the A24 Cavalier. Later Cromwell development led to the creation of the competing Centaur tank (officially the &quot;Tank, Cruiser, Mk VIII, Centaur (A27L)&quot;). This was closely related to the Cromwell, both vehicles being externally similar. The Cromwell and Centaur tanks differed in the engine used; the Centaur had the 410 hp Liberty engine, the Cromwell had the significantly more powerful 600 hp Meteor; Centaur hulls were converted to Cromwells by changing the engine.

The Cromwell first saw action in the Battle of Normandy in June 1944. The tank equipped the armoured reconnaissance regiments of the Royal Armoured Corps, in the 7th Armoured Division, 11th Armoured Division and the Guards Armoured Division. While the armoured regiments of the latter two divisions were equipped with M4 Shermans, the armoured regiments of the 7th Armoured Division were equipped with Cromwells. The Centaurs were not used in combat except for a few fitted with a 95 mm howitzer, which were used in support of the Royal Marines during the amphibious landings of Normandy.

==Development==

===Initial designs: A23, A24===
Development of the Cromwell and Centaur dates to 1940, as the Crusader tank was being readied for service. The General Staff were aware that the Crusader would become obsolete, and in late 1940 they set out the specifications for a replacement tank, expected to enter service in 1942, fitted with the QF 6 pounder gun.

Vauxhall responded with the A23, a scaled down version of their A22 Churchill infantry tank. This would have had 75 mm of frontal armour, used a 12-cylinder Bedford engine, carried a crew of five and would have had the same suspension as the A22.

Nuffield submitted the A24, heavily based on its Crusader design and powered by its version of the Liberty engine, a V-12 design dating to the late days of World War I and now thoroughly outdated. Nevertheless, as the design was based on the Crusader, it was expected it could be put into production rapidly.

The final entry was from Leyland and Birmingham Railway Carriage &amp; Wagon (BRC&amp;W). Their design was similar to the Nuffield, but with different suspension and tracks.

The designs were received and examined in January 1941, with Nuffield&#x27;s A24 being declared the winner on 17 January. Six prototypes of the Cromwell were ordered for the spring of 1942. These arrived four months late, and by this time the design was already outdated. It was put into production anyway, but in service it proved underpowered. Only a small number were built.

Delays in the A24 program led to demands to get the QF 6 pounder into service earlier. This led to a series of up-gunned Crusaders mounting the 6 pounder.

===Introduction of Meteor engine===

With the start of the war, Rolls-Royce ended car production and set up a design team looking for other ways to use their design capability. The team formed under the direction of W. A. Robotham at Clan Foundry in Belper, north of Derby. They began recovering and refurbishing parts from crashed Merlin engines with the intention of using them for non-aviation purposes.

In October 1940, Robotham met Henry Spurrier of Leyland Motors to discuss British tank design. The Tank Board desperately needed a more powerful tank engine to replace the aging Liberty. Robotham and Spurrier decided to attempt to fit a refurbished and re-worked Rolls-Royce Merlin engine to a Leyland tank for testing. Design had three priorities:
* To remove the supercharger and make the engine operate on standard fuel;
* To fit the engine into a current Crusader tank so the engine, and the remaining elements of the tank could be tested under greater load;
* To improve the cooling system such that the larger output engine could be cooled in the same space.

They removed the supercharger from a Merlin Mk. III to downgrade the performance to a suitable level for tank use, reversed the direction of engine rotation to match tank transmissions, and fitted the resulting engine to a Leyland-built Crusader.

Delivered to Aldershot on 6 April 1941, the test team had trouble timing its runs because it was so fast, estimating it reached . Leyland arranged to start production of 1,000 examples of the engine as the Meteor.

With engine power doubled, it soon became apparent that the additional stresses placed on the Crusader components required significant re-work to increase reliability. Leyland had no spare capacity, and re-work commenced with the help of BRC&amp;W. It was planned to fit this to BRC&amp;W-built versions of their original A24 submission.

===Design splits, and production commences: A24, A27L, A27M===
Refitting the design of the A24 Cromwell for the Meteor engine was not acceptable to Nuffield, and hence a new specification of tank was created working with Leyland, the &quot;A27&quot; Cromwell.

In mid-1941, Leyland changed its mind, concerned about cooling problems. This was a major concern for the Tank Board, as cooling issues had been a major problem for the previous generation of Crusader and Covenanter tanks. The Tank board was still committed to the Meteor, but to avoid dedicating all resources into a potentially flawed design, the design was split into three separate vehicles:
* &quot;A24 Cromwell I&quot; under Nuffield, later known as &quot;Cavalier&quot;. This was based on the existing specification of Liberty engine and Wilson steering, working from experience learned with the Crusader.
* &quot;A27L Cromwell II&quot; initially under English Electric, but design taken over by Leyland, later known as &quot;Centaur&quot;. This was to be based on a revised and upgraded Liberty engine from Morris Motors and the newly available Merrit-Brown gearbox as used on the Churchill tank.
* &quot;A27M Cromwell III&quot; under BRC&amp;W, which carried the Cromwell name through to production and service. This was to be based on the new Meteor engine and the Merrit-Brown gearbox, but was also to be designed such that the Liberty engine could be fitted if problems arose.

These early design designations of Cromwell I, II, and III are not to be confused with the later production designations of Cromwell I, II, etc. which were production variants of the A27M.

While Leyland continued with the Liberty under A27L, the Tank Board continued with the Meteor engine by placing an order directly with Rolls-Royce. Leyland also suggested using a diesel engine of their own design, although this was later abandoned. BRC&amp;W became parent to the Cromwell in September 1941 working with David-Brown (gearbox) RR (engine) and Leyland (tracks and sprockets) and produced a pilot in January 1942.

Cromwell&#x27;s cooling system was a new design and put through over nine months of testing in a variety of configurations. This included the development of new fan drives and inlet louvres, which can be seen on the Cromwell&#x27;s engine deck. The resulting system for a Meteor-powered tank delivered both the necessary cooling performance, and reduced the power lost in driving the cooling system from 90 to 30 hp. This made the performance improvement of the Meteor over the Liberty even more pronounced and left room for expected development of the A27.

The first (mild steel) prototype of a Meteor-powered A27M Cromwell was delivered to the Army for trials in March 1942, several months before the A24 that was supposed to precede it, and also prior to the A27L Centaur pilot vehicle which was delivered in June 1942. With nearly it proved to be exceptionally mobile when tested.

Orders were placed for both A27L and A27M versions as there were concerns about the production rate of the Meteor. Design also commenced on a 17-pounder armed version under specification A30, leading to parallel development of the A30 Challenger.

As all of Rolls-Royce&#x27;s production capacity was engaged in producing the Merlin engine for aircraft, production of the Meteor version was initially based solely on parts recovered from crashed aircraft, with many engines still showing crash damage. Additional sources for manufacturing the Meteor engine were investigated. Even when assigned reduced production quotas, BRC&amp;W proved unable to meet the demand for Cromwell, and Leyland became the design and production parent of both the A27L and A27M versions including subcontracted work.

===Engine production===
Rolls was at this time having trouble meeting demand for the Merlin, let alone the Meteor. Meanwhile, Rover was having troubles turning Frank Whittle&#x27;s Power Jets W.2 jet engine design into a produceable design due to increasing animosity between the engineers at Power Jets and Rover. Things became particularly heated when Whittle learned that Rover had set up a secret project (with the approval of the Ministry of Aircraft Production) to develop a simpler-to-produce &quot;straight-through&quot; version of the W.2. Whittle had, though Stanley Hooker of RR&#x27;s supercharger division, been in contact with Rolls for help delivering some of the required parts that Rover proved unable to produce.

At the same time MAP was frustrated with Power Jets&#x27; complaints about Rover and the lack of a usable engine and had proposed in December 1942 that RR take over Power Jets but were not in a position to force such an event. The solution came in an agreement between Rover and RR. Ernest Hives, the head of Rolls had met Whittle and was fascinated by the jet engine (Rolls-Royce&#x27;s major product was piston aero engines) called a meeting with his counterpart at Rover, Spencer Wilks, and the two met late in 1942 at the Swan and Royal pub in Clitheroe. Hives offered to trade the Meteor for the W.2, an offer Wilks jumped at. With approval by the company&#x27;s boards and the MAP, Rover&#x27;s jet engine team and production transferred to RR while Rover set up production of the Meteor engine at their Tyseley factory, and an additional line was set up by Morris Motors in Coventry.

Production began in November 1942. In August, new names had been given to all three designs; the original A24 Cromwell I became the Cavalier, the Liberty powered A27L Cromwell II became Centaur, and the Meteor powered A27M kept the name Cromwell. It would take considerable time for Rover to make ready production lines for the Meteor, and it was not until a few months later, in January 1943, that sufficient Meteor engines were available and the A27M Cromwell began production. The official handover of the Meteor and W.2 took place on 1 January 1943.

===Armament choice===
To increase production of Meteor engines Rover and Morris required machine tools from the US, which took time to arrive. In the interim, Centaur production continued, to avoid closing Cromwell tank production lines. The Cromwell had - in line with the then General Staff policy - originally be armed primarily for anti-tank work and the current QF 6-pounder (a high velocity tank gun with armour piercing (AP) ammunition met the requirement. A smaller number of tanks were to have the Ordnance QF 95 mm howitzer to fire high explosive and smoke shells as close support tanks.

The British experience in North Africa campaign was that during breakthroughs of the enemy line, tanks were encountered less but anti-tank guns and infantry were the main targets. The US-supplied M3 Grant and M4 Sherman tanks in North Africa had a dual purpose 75 mm gun which fired a more effective HE shell than the 6-pounder at the cost of a reduction in armour-piercing performance and this was seen as desirable for British tanks. Once the Vickers 75 mm HV gun was seen to be too big for the Cromwell turret, work was begun in December 1942 on the Ordnance QF 75 mm (a development of the 6-pounder that fired US ammunition) for fitting to British tanks. The new General Staff policy was announced at start of 1943; British medium weight tanks would be equipped with dual-purpose guns that were effective against current German tanks and they would be supported by tanks with high power anti-tank guns and close support weapons. Mark IV Cromwells were delivered with 75 mm guns from October 1943.

To maintain the capability to take on Axis tanks, production was to be split:
* 10 percent fitted with Ordnance QF 95 mm howitzer;
* 30 percent with a high velocity weapon: either 6-pounder or under the A30 development the 76mm 17-pounder;
* 60 percent with a &quot;dual purpose weapon&quot;.

Noting the problems with the medium velocity 75 mm dual purpose weapon, Vickers had already commenced development of a high velocity 75 mm gun that would fire American 75 mm ammunition but at a much higher velocity.

A complete move to Sherman tanks was not acceptable to British forces who would then be dependent on the US for tank production. At the same time, Cromwell with the Meteor engine and a HV weapon was shown to have superior power and armament, while US efforts to produce the Sherman replacement, the T20 medium tank, were not receiving sufficient attention.

A compromise was achieved with a reduction in British tank production during 1943 and 1944, with an increase in consumption of Sherman tanks, the remainder being delivered in parts as spares. Centaur production bore the brunt of this reduction, having only been continued to maintain factories producing Cromwell hulls while the number of Meteor engines was inadequate. It had already been arranged that Centaur production would be phased out when Meteor engine production increased. The list of machine tools required for the increase in Meteor output was also agreed upon, allowing Cromwell manufacture to scale.

At the same time as negotiations with the US, problems were being encountered with the use of the Vickers 75 mm HV gun in the Cromwell, with a larger turret ring being required. This was now expected to be introduced in mid-1944, leaving the majority of Cromwells with the medium velocity guns similar to the Shermans. Design of the high velocity variant was split to a separate specification. Intended as just another version of Cromwell, the new &quot;A34&quot; version eventually needed significant re-engineering leading to production of the A34 Comet, which used a high velocity gun firing 17-pounder projectiles with a smaller cartridge down a shorter barrel. In the interim, the A27M version started.

===Early trials===
The first real field test of the design was carried out in August–September 1943, when examples of the Centaur and Cromwell were tested against Shermans (the diesel-engined M4A2 and multibank petrol-engined M4A4) in Exercise Dracula, a long trip around Britain. The Shermans proved to be the most reliable by far, requiring 420 hours of specialist fitter attention over a total distance travelled of with 199 defects. This corresponds to 0.03 hours per mile. In comparison, the Cromwells drove with 367 defects and required 814 hours, or 0.07 hours per mile. The Centaur managed only with 297 defects, due to constant breakdown, and required 742 hours, or 0.087 hours per mile.

The Cromwell and Centaur were given additional time to work out these problems. The Cromwell problems were mostly related to oil leaks and brake and clutch failures, an observer noting that these were well-known and should already have been corrected. The crews expressed their love for the design and especially its speed and handling. The Centaur was largely dismissed, with one observer expressing his hope that units were being equipped with it only for training purposes. The same reviewers unanimously supported the Sherman. A similar test in November demonstrated the Cromwell was improving, while the underpowered Centaur fared no better than in the first test.

Alongside Cromwell production, Centaur production design also allowed for the later conversion to the Meteor engine. A small number were retro-fitted for trials as Cromwell III and Cromwell X. As the Cromwell proved itself, larger numbers were fitted with the Meteor engine on the production line as Cromwell III and IV (not to be confused with the earlier Cromwell III design project).

===Final specification===
The production model design was finalised on 2 February 1944 when Leyland released specifications for what they called the &quot;Battle Cromwell&quot;.

This included a number of minor changes to the basic design, including of extra armour below the crew compartment, the introduction of an all-round vision cupola for the commander, seam welding all joints to waterproof and strengthen the tank, and standardising on the A27M version with Meteor engine and Merritt-Brown transmission.

The Cromwell Final Specification was applied part way through the production of Cromwell III and IV, changing the appearance and specification of both vehicles. The specification was later improved toward the end of the war with the Cromwell VII, resulting in an upgrade programme.

Centaur and Cavalier never met the requirements to enter front-line service. Most were used for training, although a few notable exceptions were used in action. 

==Production==
Total A27 production consisted of 4,016 tanks, 950 of which were Centaurs and 3,066 Cromwells. In addition, 375 Centaur hulls were built to be fitted with an anti-aircraft gun turret; only 95 of these were completed.

Production was led by Leyland Motors on Centaur, and Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company (BRC&amp;W) on Cromwell. Several other British firms also built Centaur and Cromwell tanks, however, as the numbers required were greater than any one company could deliver. Companies contracted to build the tanks included English Electric, Harland and Wolff, John Fowler &amp; Co., LMS Railway, Metro-Cammell, Morris Motors and Ruston-Bucyrus.

Production of Cromwell and Centaur was split into two different groups. Cromwell was to be built by BRC&amp;W and Metro-Cammell while Centaur was to be built by Leyland, English-Electric, Harland &amp; Wolf, John Fowler &amp; Co., LMS, Morris, Ruston-Bucyrus. Nuffield also switched production to Centaur when Cavalier completed. To increase Cromwell production capacity, English Electric switched from manufacturing Centaur to Cromwell, but remained tooled for Centaur. This resulted in a number of Cromwells being built with Centaur hulls. By January 1943, when production started, Leyland had become the production and design lead for A27 series including subcontractors producing components. Records show that John Fowler &amp; Co. also produced both varieties.

Vauxhall produced two Cromwell pilot models—with a turret similar to that of the Churchill—in the expectation that they would build Cromwells once production of Churchill was terminated in 1943, but Churchill production was extended and Vauxhall withdrew from the Cromwell programme.

==Design==
===Hull===
The frame was of riveted construction, though welding was used later. The armour plate was then bolted to the frame; large bosses on the outside of the plate were used on the turret.

The suspension was of the Christie type, with long helical springs (in tension) angled back to keep the hull sides low. Of the five road wheels each side, four had shock absorbers. The tracks were driven by sprocketed wheels at the rear and tension adjusted at the front idler, this being standard British practice. Some variants were produced with tracks; later, 15.5-inch tracks were used. As with previous Christie-suspension cruiser tanks, there were no track return rollers, the track being supported instead on the tops of the road wheels, known as the &quot;slack-track&quot; design. The side of the hull was made up of two spaced plates, the suspension units between them, and the outer plate having cutouts for the movement of the road-wheel axles.

The gearbox had five forward and one reverse gears. The first gear was for &quot;confined spaces, on steep inclines or...sharp turns&quot;. The transmission was the new Merrit-Brown Z.5, which offered differential steering without clutching or braking, a major advance on previous designs. It gave the Cromwell superb manoeuvrability.

The Meteor engine delivered 540 hp at 2,250 rpm giving the Cromwell speed as well as manoeuvrability. This was the maximum rpm, which was limited by governors built into the magnetos. Fuel consumption on &quot;pool&quot; petrol (67 octane) was between 0.5 and 1.5 miles per gallon depending on terrain.
The driver sat on the right in the front of the hull, with the hull gunner on the left, separated by a bulkhead. The driver had two periscopes and a visor in the hull front. The visor could be opened fully or a small &quot;gate&quot; in it opened; in the latter case, a thick glass block protected the driver. The gunner had a single sighting periscope. A bulkhead with access holes separated the driver and hull gunner from the fighting compartment.

A further bulkhead separated the fighting compartment from the engine and transmission bay. The engine compartment drew cooling air in through the top of each side and the roof and exhausted it to the rear. To allow fording through up to deep water, a flap could be moved to cover the lowermost air outlet. Air for the engine could be drawn from the fighting compartment or the exterior; it was then passed through oil bath cleaners. It was modified so that the exhaust fumes were redirected so that they were not drawn into the fighting compartment, a problem found when tanks were drawn up together, preparing to advance.

In June 1944, the Cromwell saw action during Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy. It had a mixed reception by crews, being faster, and with a lower profile than the Sherman tank, but also being smaller and more cramped. Cromwell had of frontal armour, compared with on the glacis of the early Shermans, though it was unsloped and hence less effective in practice. 123 Cromwells were later produced with applique armour on the hull front that reached .

===Turret and armament===
Following British tank doctrine of the time, the vehicle was designed to fire on the move. The turret offered hydraulically powered turret traverse motors with proportional speed control. Later vehicles fitted an all-round view cupola for the commander to identify and track targets. Both gunner and commander had rotating and pivoting Vickers Gundlach tank periscopes, while two fixed episcopes were fitted in the rotating cupola. There was a 7.92 mm Besa machine gun mounted co-axially to the main armament, operated by the gunner. A second was gimbal mounted in the front of the hull, with 45 degrees horizontal and 25 degrees vertical movement. Sighting was by a No. 35 telescope, which was connected through a linkage to the mounting. In the top of the turret was a 2-inch &quot;bombthrower&quot; angled to fire forward. Thirty smoke grenades were carried for it.

Early models of the Cromwell were equipped with the QF 6-pounder (57 mm). Using the new armour-piercing discarding sabot round, which became available in quantity in early 1944, this gun could penetrate over 100 mm of steel armour at ranges on the order of , making it effective against all but the most heavily armoured tanks. However, British tankers had long complained about this weapon&#x27;s lack of a useful high explosive (HE) round for attacking soft targets like trucks, anti-tank guns and infantry defences. A HE shell had been introduced for the 6-pounder, but it was described as being largely useless—the calibre of the gun was simply too small to carry a useful load of explosive. This was not entirely accidental; British tank policy of the time suggested that different models of the same tank, carrying different specialised weapons, was a better solution to this problem than a single weapon that attempted to do all things.

Experience with the US M3 75 mm gun suggested this thinking was wrong, that a single gun could be used in a &quot;dual purpose&quot; role against both tanks and softer targets. This led Vickers to begin development of a 75 mm weapon of 50 calibres in length, which would fire the same HE shell as the US gun, but with a higher propellant load that would make its anti-tank rounds more effective. However, as examples of this weapon began to arrive in May 1943, it was clear it would not fit into any turret that could be mated to the Cromwell&#x27;s turret ring.

This problem was eventually solved by the realisation that the 6-pounder could be bored out to 75 mm and fire unmodified US ammunition. While this would lead to less anti-tank performance, this was considered a reasonable trade-off in exchange for the rapid introduction of the HE rounds. The resulting ROQF 75 mm could be easily swapped out with the 6-pounder, and newly built models mounting the gun were known as the Mark V. The ROQF 75 mm would be the primary weapon for the majority of Cromwells produced.

A close support version of the Cromwell was fitted with the QF 95 mm howitzer in place of the 75 mm. This too fired HE, though its primary role was delivering smoke shells, covering the other tanks in the unit.

Some command or OP tanks had the armament removed, leaving space in the turret for further radios. These were fitted with a dummy wooden gun, so as not to appear different to the enemy and attract hostile fire.

===Cromwell and Centaur differences===
Aside from the engine and its ancillaries (fans, radiator, clutch, etc.), both vehicles are very similar designs. While similar however, there were a number of minor variations between the Cromwell and Centaur caused by the divergence of design and production.

Increases in the Cromwell&#x27;s design weight from 24 to 27 tons resulted in a reworking of the suspension during the design process, which was not reflected on the Centaur. The Cromwell had heavier grade suspension with longer suspension arms. The Cromwell&#x27;s shock absorbers and springs were improved against the Cavalier, and increased to four (compared with the Centaur&#x27;s three).

The method of track tensioning is a commonly noted difference. Initially, the design based on A24 Cavalier used a worm drive for tensioning. This was noted as being slow to operate, and trapped dirt. BRC&amp;W developed an alternative ratchet mechanism based on the Valentine tank, and this was incorporated into the A27M Cromwell design, also enabling the tank to accept wider tracks. Centaur under Leyland continued without this development.

Some of these differences can be seen in Cromwells built with Centaur hulls, although many were removed with the introduction of the Cromwell Final Specification. This included the Cromwell method of track tensioning.

By comparison, the Cavalier can easily be identified by the vehicle&#x27;s rear armour plate, which incorporates Crusader-style horizontal angled exhaust louvres. The Cromwell and Centaur both have a flat rear armour plate, with exhaust venting to the top immediately behind the engine deck. For this reason, many Cromwell and Centaur vehicles had a cowl fitted to direct the exhaust gases back where they could not re-enter the tank fighting compartment.

===Further developments===
An earlier requirement for a 17-pounder armed tank became more important when the 50 calibre Vickers 75 mm HV gun failed to fit on the Cromwell. A version of the Cromwell mounting the more powerful Ordnance QF 17-pounder (76.2 mm) had been commenced by BRC&amp;W early in the development process. This required a much larger turret ring, which in turn required the hull to be lengthened (with an additional road wheel added to each side for a total of six) and the centre hull section widened. The result was the A30 Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger, but had its limitations and only 200 were produced. While successful, production ceased in favour of the much easier conversion of Sherman Fireflys, originally developed as a safeguard for the A30 programme, allowing greater numbers to be fielded.

However, development of the Vickers HV 50 calibre 75 mm gun continued, with the bore increasing to fire modified versions of the 17-pounder ammunition. This gun and its ammunition were designed specifically to fit in a turret that a reworked Cromwell-sized design could carry. This became the 77 mm HV with only slightly lower performance than the base 17-pounder. By the time this weapon was ready, a number of other changes had been worked into the tank design, producing the Comet, which replaced both the Cromwell and Challenger.

==Performance==

The A24 design specification had originally been constrained by the available tank engines of the time, delivering only 300 hp and limiting the weight. The evolution to A27M increased the weight slightly, but fitting a 600 hp engine almost doubled the power-to-weight ratio and created a very fast tank. This was combined with the Merrit-Brown gearbox that allowed the tank to steer while still powering both tracks, allowing it to maintain speed while manoeuvring, while tanks like the Sherman or T-34 lost power while turning and necessarily slowed down.

The Cromwell was the fastest British tank to serve in the Second World War, with a top speed of . This speed was extremely beneficial in both attack and defence, outmanoeuvring opponents. At least one case is known of vehicle commanders using the vehicle&#x27;s fast speed to jump large gaps. In the Netherlands, a troop of three Cromwells was able to leap a wide canal when surprised by enemy forces. This speed proved too much for even the Christie suspension and in later models the final drive ratio was changed to lower the top speed to , which was still fast for its time.

The Cromwell&#x27;s armament was changed from the 6-pounder to the dual-purpose 75 mm. This gave a significant reduction in armour penetration compared to newer 6-pounder armour-piercing discarding sabot ammunition, which was becoming available, but added the ability to fire high explosive (HE) shells, which were more capable against other targets, such as anti-tank guns. The high velocity 75 mm gun was developed in an attempt to give both good anti-tank and HE performance, but in May 1943 proved too big to be fitted to the Cromwell. This issue led to the development of the A34 Comet, while the gun bore was increased to 76.2 mm to become compatible with 17-pounder ammunition, albeit with smaller shell casings with less propellant. The lack of a high-velocity weapon proved to be a significant limitation against opponents such as the Tiger, and the Cromwell had to rely on mobility.

The dual-purpose 75 mm main gun fired the same ammunition as the US 75 mm gun as used on the Sherman, and was also fitted to the Churchill and other British tanks later in the war, it had around the same HE and armour-piercing capabilities as the 75 mm-equipped Sherman tank. The Cromwell&#x27;s speed and low profile gave an advantage over the Sherman, however, giving the tank the element of surprise and making return fire more difficult. Cromwell crews in north-west Europe succeeded in outflanking the heavier and more sluggish German tanks with superior speed, manoeuvrability and reliability.

The armour on the Cromwell ranged from to thick overall. On all-welded vehicles built by BRC&amp;W, the weight saved by the welding allowed for the fitting of additional appliqué armour plates on the nose, vertical driver&#x27;s plate and turret front, increasing the maximum thickness there to . These vehicles are identified by their War Department numbers carrying the suffix W, e.g. T121710W. The armour compared well with that of the Sherman, although the Cromwell did not share the Sherman&#x27;s sloped glacis plate.

While the Cromwell was a match for the majority of Axis tanks in use, it was not a match for the armour and armament of the latest German heavy vehicles developed at the same time. British tank design would go through another stage, the Comet cruiser, before developing the Centurion tank.

==Combat service==

===World War II===
The Cromwell tank entered front-line service with the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944. Cromwells landed with the following forces on D+1. They saw extensive action with the British Army, forming part of the 6th Airborne Division, 7th Armoured Division, 11th Armoured Division, Guards Armoured Division, and 1st (Polish) Armoured Division. The tank was also used by the 1st (Czechoslovakian) Independent Armoured Brigade Group as part of the First Canadian Army in Dunkirk.

Cromwells were used as the main tank in the armoured brigades of the 7th Armoured Division, while being used in the armoured reconnaissance regiments of the other British armoured divisions, Guards Armoured Division and 11th Armoured Division, in north-west Europe. It excelled at this task because of its speed and low profile. The tank was praised for its speed and reliability, while its low profile made it harder to spot.

The standard 75 mm gun could tackle the majority of German armoured vehicles, and the HE shell was effective, but could not penetrate the front of heavier German tanks such as the Tiger or Panther. Although a rare occurrence on the battlefield, during the Battle of Normandy it was in the British sector where the majority of these German machines were encountered. The issue with the 75 mm gun was perhaps most pronounced during the Battle of Villers-Bocage in which the Cromwells were unable to engage German Tiger tanks frontally with any reasonable chance of success. Several Tigers were knocked out by British forces in the battle nonetheless.

The 75 mm HV had been intended to rectify this, but prior to entering service it was found to be too large to fit in the Cromwell&#x27;s turret. Instead, Cromwells fought alongside the 17-pounder-armed Sherman Fireflys or Challengers, both of which could destroy Panthers and Tigers at standard combat distances. Cromwells (and 75 mm-armed Shermans) were supplemented by these vehicles at varying ratios per troop of 1/2 to 1/3. Though this provided a good solution to the issue of heavy German tanks, it added an additional level of complexity for battlefield commanders in having to place the 17-pounder tanks tactically within a formation. However this complication was not unique to the British Army; the US employed similar methods and faced the same issue with their 75 mm Sherman tanks.

This situation persisted until the development of the A34 Comet, mounting the new 77 mm HV gun, removed the need for mixed units.

In contrast, the Centaur was chiefly used for training; only those in specialist roles saw action. The Centaur IV close support version, equipped with a 95 mm howitzer, saw service in small numbers as part of the Royal Marine Armoured Support Group on D-Day. Originally intended to be used from landing craft and serve as static pillboxes, these examples retained the engines, allowing the marines to drive the tanks inland. A number of Centaurs were also re-purposed as combat engineering vehicles, such as armoured bulldozers.

The Sherman remained the most common tank in British and other Commonwealth armoured units in Europe. The Cromwell, in turn, was succeeded by small numbers of the Comet tank. This was based on the Cromwell and shared many components but had been designed from the outset to mount a superior gun, the 77 mm tank gun (a version of the 17-pounder with different ammunition). Only the 11th Armoured Division was fully re-equipped with the Comet before the war ended.

=== Units equipped ===
* 2nd Battalion Welsh Guards
* 8th King&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars
* 1st Royal Tank Regiment
* 5th Royal Tank Regiment
* 4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters) (to July 1944)
* 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards
* 2nd Northamptonshire Yeomanry (to August 1944)
* 15th/19th King&#x27;s Royal Hussars (from August 1944)
* 6th Airborne Reconnaissance Regiment, RAC, within 6th Airborne Division
* 16th Independent Armoured Brigade (Polish)
* 10th Mounted Rifle Regiment (Polish)
* Royal Marines Armoured Support Group (Centaur IV)

===Post-war===
During the Korean War, the British had a total of 14 Cromwell tanks: six of the 8th King&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars Regiment and eight of the 45th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery. The Royal Artillery Cromwells were artillery observation tanks, lacking the main gun, but with expanded observation and communication equipment.

In December 1950, 14 tanks were organized into &quot;Cooper Force&quot;, led by Captain Donald Ashley-Cooper, and were deployed to Jangheung, Yangju to support the 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles Regiment, whose duty was to defend northwest of Seoul. On the night of 3 January 1951, the 1st Battalion of the Royal Ulster Rifles and Cooper Force retreated under orders from superior command to withdraw. During the process, 157 soldiers were killed and all the tanks were destroyed or abandoned as they escaped along the gorge without protection provided by friendly units.

One of the captured Cromwells operated by the Communist Party was destroyed by a British Centurion tank near Hangang Railway Bridge on February 1. Another captured tank, deployed to Wolmido near Incheon by the communists, was recaptured by South Korean marines on February 10. American marines helped South Korean marines to repair the recaptured Cromwell for usage. However, the &quot;Marine Cromwell&quot; only rolled for a few days until it was handed back to its original owner, the British.

Cromwell tanks were used by Czechoslovakia and Israel.

Fifty-two Centaur I tanks were donated in early 1946 to the Greek Army during the opening stages of the Greek Civil War but they were kept in storage due to the lack of trained personnel. In 1947, the first Greek officers returned from training courses in the United Kingdom and training of tank crews began. In April 1948, the Centaurs were organised in three Centaur tank companies, initially numbered II, IX and XI, but a year later were renumbered 381, 382, and 383 and temporarily attached to reconnaissance regiments 391, 392, and 393. The Centaurs saw limited service in the war because battles were fought mainly in mountainous areas, but proved useful in supporting infantry units and in defence of inhabited areas. After the end of the war, in October 1949, the three Centaur companies were organised into the 391 Tank Regiment. The Centaurs were replaced by US built M47s and in 1962 were sold and scrapped. One Centaur is preserved in the Greek Army Tank Museum.

The British Army, Austria and Jordan used the larger-gunned Charioteer development of the Cromwell post-war. Jordanian vehicles saw action in conflicts in the Middle East.

==Operators==
* 
* : in 1944, up to 150 Cromwell-type tanks was provided to the French army. some sources suggest those were all Centaur I and Cavalier I. those were scrapped in 1945 and the turret was used to build fortifications in Indochina. 
* : Handful captured from the British &quot;Cooper Force&quot; during the Korean War.
* : 1 recaptured from North Korea then returned to the United Kingdom.
* 

==Variants==
Development of hull types and armaments occurred independently. Hull types applied to all variants. A single mark could cover up to four types, and a type up to six marks making classification complex. Combinations of mark and type were applied by different manufacturers.

===Cromwell===
;Cromwell I: Early vehicles armed with the Royal Ordnance QF 6 pounder (57 mm) gun (with 64 rounds of ammunition). Only 357 produced due to the switch from the 6 pounder (57 mm) to the 75 mm gun.

;Cromwell II: Pilot vehicle built by Vauxhall with cast turret similar to Churchill VII. This did not enter production.

;Cromwell III: Centaur I hull fitted with Meteor V12 engine to A27M standard. Turret houses Royal Ordnance QF 6 pounder. Only ~ 200 produced due to scarcity of Centaur I&#x27;s.

;Cromwell IV: Centaur III hull re-engined with Meteor engine. Turret houses 75 mm ROQF Mk V gun. Later Cromwell IV&#x27;s saw the introduction of the Final Specification, changing some features (such as track-adjuster) to normal Cromwell standard. The most numerous variant with over 1,935 units produced.

;Cromwell V: Cromwell built to Final Specification and armed with the 75 mm gun.

;Cromwell VI: Cromwell built to Final Specification and armed with 95 mm howitzer. 341 produced.

;Cromwell VII: Upgrade to Cromwell IV, V, and VI armed with the 75 mm gun. Some hulls were upgraded with features from later hull types. Wider (15.5 inch) tracks, and upgraded suspension (where not fitted earlier in the production programme). These were introduced very late in the war and did not see much in the way of combat. ~ 1,500 produced, Some saw combat in the Korean War and many were later converted to FV4101 Tank, Medium Gun, Charioteer.

;Cromwell VIII: Cromwell VI reworked with same upgrades as VII but retaining the 95 mm howitzer.

===Centaur===
;Centaur I: Armed with the Royal Ordnance QF 6 pounder (57 mm) gun (with 64 rounds of ammunition). It was used only for training. 1,059 produced.

;Centaur II: Mark I with wider tracks and no hull machine gun. Experimental only.

;Centaur III: Centaur armed with the 75 mm ROQF Mk V gun. In 1943, most Centaur I were converted to IIIs, but a few remained as such. 233 produced.

;Centaur IV: Centaur armed with a 95 mm howitzer (with 51 rounds of ammunition). This is the only version of the Centaur known to have seen combat, in service with the Royal Marines Armoured Support Group. The vehicles were fitted with wading gear to get them ashore. Trunking waterproofed the engine inlets and covers were fitted to the guns. 114 produced.
;Centaur Bulldozer: A Centaur tank with the turret removed and installed a simple winch-operated bulldozer blade. Used as armoured obstacle-clearing vehicle. Issued to the 79th Armoured Division in Belgium during the latter part of 1944.

===Hull variants===

Hull types ranged from type A to type F. Each type applied a different package of changes to the hull design to different marks of tank. Changing the vehicle type allowed the introduction of changes without changing the overall offensive capability.
==Vehicles based on chassis==

===Conversions===
A number of further vehicles were based on the Cromwell tank hull, either re-working existing vehicles or built from scratch with the Cromwell as the basis:

;Cromwell command
:The main gun was removed and it carried one each of the No. 19 (low power) and No. 19 (high power) wireless sets. These were used by brigade and divisional headquarters.
;Cromwell observation post
: Cromwell IV, Cromwell VI, or Cromwell VIII fitted with extra radio equipment; 2 x No. 19 and 2 x No. 38 (portable) radios. The main gun was retained.
;Cromwell control
:Two No. 19 low power radios. Main armament kept. Used by regimental headquarters
;Centaur, AA Mk I: Used a Crusader III, anti-aircraft Mk II turret fitted with twin 20 mm Polsten guns instead of Oerlikons. Were originally deployed in Normandy, but withdrawn as unnecessary due to Allied air superiority. 95 were produced.
;Centaur, AA Mk II: Same turret as Crusader III, AA Mk III but with twin 20 mm Polsten AA guns.

;Centaur dozer: A Centaur with the turret removed and given a simple dozer blade operated by a winch. Since the winch passed over the top of the hull it was not possible to retain the turret. Issued one per Cromwell squadron and to RE. One of &quot;Hobart&#x27;s Funnies&quot;. 250 produced.
;Centaur observation post (OP): A Centaur with a dummy main gun, and extra radio communications.
;Centaur Kangaroo: A Centaur with turret removed to make space for passengers. (Few produced)
;Centaur armoured recovery vehicle (ARV): A Centaur with turret removed, and replaced with winch fitted instead, and an optional A-frame.

Post-war, a number of Cromwells were upgraded to meet the new Cold War threat:
;FV 4101 Charioteer: Cromwell hull with a QF 20-pounder gun in a tall turret, designed in the 1950s to give more fire support. 200 produced.

===Designs based on the Cromwell===
The Cromwell tank design was also used as the basis for the design other vehicles:
* Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger (A30): combined a lengthened Cromwell chassis with widened superstructure to mount the 17-pounder gun in a new turret.
* A30 Avenger SP 17pdr, a version of the Challenger using a lighter more open turret as a self-propelled gun role.
* Excelsior (Tank, Heavy Assault, A33), an experimental design with elements of an infantry tank as a possible replacement for the Churchill tank. When the Churchill continued to meet requirements, development was halted.
* Comet (A34), A tank based on lessons learned from the Cromwell development, incorporating a larger turret ring, enabling the use of a more powerful 76 mm gun. This tank reflects much of what was intended for the Cromwell.

The Challenger was ordered into production in limited numbers and saw service alongside the Cromwell, the Comet entered service later in the war.

The A31 and A32 were attempts to convert the Cromwell to an infantry tank that never got beyond the design stage.

The majority of following British tank designs utilised the Meteor engine and Merritt-Brown steering and gearbox combination initially developed for the Cromwell, lasting all the way through the Centurion. This proved to be one of the primary elements in the development of the main battle tank.

<doc id="501757" wikidata="Q2723400" url="?curid=501757" title="Chinese noodles">
<text>Chinese noodles vary widely according to the region of production, ingredients, shape or width, and manner of preparation. Noodles were invented in China, and are an essential ingredient and staple in Chinese cuisine. They are an important part of most regional cuisines within China, and other countries with sizable overseas Chinese populations.

Chinese noodles can be made of wheat, buckwheat, rice, millet, maize, oats, acorns, kudzu, Siberian elm, soybeans, mung beans, yams, cassava, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and meats such as fish and shrimp. There are over 1,200 types of noodles commonly consumed in China today, with tens of thousands of noodle dish varieties prepared using these types of noodles.

Chinese noodles have entered the cuisines of neighboring East Asian countries such as Korea, Japan, and Mongolia, as well as Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, the Philippines and Thailand.

==Nomenclature==

Nomenclature of Chinese noodles can be difficult due to the vast spectrum available in China and the many dialects of Chinese used to name them. In Mandarin, miàn (; often transliterated as &quot;mien&quot; or &quot;mein&quot; ) refers to noodles made from wheat flour, while fěn () or &quot;fun&quot; refers to noodles made from other starches, particularly rice flour and mung bean starch. Each noodle type can be rendered in pinyin for Mandarin, but in Hong Kong and neighboring Guangdong it will be known by its Cantonese pronunciation (&quot;meen&quot; or &quot;mien&quot; for wheat noodles, &quot;fun&quot; for non-wheat). Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore and many other Overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia may use Hokkien (Min Nan) instead (e.g. &quot;mee&quot; for wheat noodles, &quot;hoon&quot; or &quot;hun&quot; for non-wheat). Wheat noodles, for example, are called mian in Mandarin, mein in Cantonese, men in Japanese, mee in Thai and &quot;guksu&quot; in Korean.

Sometimes, the principal ingredient used in the preparation such as wheat, buckwheat, rice, potato, corn flour, bean, soybean flour, yam flour, mung-bean starch, sweet potato, cassava, etc. may also form the basis of naming noodles.

==History==

The earliest written record of noodles is from a book dated to the Eastern Han period (25–220 AD). Noodles, often made from wheat dough, became a prominent staple of food during the Han dynasty. In the Western Han dynasty, due to demand by the military, it was necessary for the government to implement food processing technologies that would make the food storage easier and more affordable. During this time, “Laomian” emerged, it was made with starch-rich buckwheat, millet and pea flours with lower water content, making it easier to store and transport.

During the Song dynasty (960–1279) noodle shops were very popular in the cities, and remained open all night. During the earlier dynastic periods Chinese wheat noodles were known as &quot;soup cake&quot; (), as explained by the Song dynasty scholar Huáng Cháo Yīng (黃朝英) mentions in his work &quot;A delightful mixed discussion on various scholarly topics&quot; (, Scroll 2) that in ancient times bready foods like pasta are referred collectively as &quot;bing&quot; and differentiated through their cooking methods.·

Up until 1992, most dried Chinese noodles in the United States could not be sold labelled as &quot;noodles&quot;. This is due to fact that many Chinese noodles are made without eggs and do not always use wheat as starch, thus resulting in the United States Department of Agriculture obliging manufacturers to label them as &quot;imitation noodles&quot; or &quot;alimentary paste&quot;.

==Production==
Chinese noodles are generally made from either wheat flour, rice flour, or mung bean starch, with wheat noodles being more commonly produced and consumed with the ancient wooden noodles mold technology in northern China and rice noodles being more typical of southern China. Egg, lye, and cereal may also be added to noodles made from wheat flour in order to give the noodles a different color or flavor. Egg whites, arrowroot or tapioca starch are sometimes added to the flour mixture in low quantities to change the texture and tenderness of the noodles&#x27; strands. Although illegal, the practice of adding the chemical cross-linker borax to whiten noodles and improve their texture is also quite common in East Asia. In general, the Chinese noodles cooking method involves making a dough with flour, salt, and water; mixing the dough by hand to form bar shapes; bending the bars for proofing; pulling the bars into strips; dropping the strips into a pot with boiling water; and removing the noodles when finished cooking. Chinese type noodles are generally made from hard wheat flours, characterized by bright creamy white or bright yellow color and firm texture.

Before the automatic noodle machine was invented in 1950s, the processing of Chinese noodles were made with four steps, including:
* Fresh – The noodles are often consumed within 24 hours of manufacture due to quick discoloration. Their shelf life can be extended to 3–5 days if stored under refrigeration;
* Dried – Fresh noodle strands are dried by sunlight or in a controlled chamber;
* Boiled – Fresh noodle strands are either parboiled or fully cooked. After parboiling, Chinese noodles are rinsed in cold water, drained and covered with 1–2% vegetable oil to prevent sticking;
* Steamed – Fresh alkaline noodle strands are steamed in a steamer and softened with water through rinsing.

The dough for noodles made from wheat flour is typically made from wheat flour, salt, and water, with the addition of eggs or lye depending on the desired texture and taste of the noodles. Rice or other starch-based noodles are typically made with only the starch or rice flour and water. After the formation of a pliable dough mass, one of the six below types of mechanical processing may be applied to produce the noodles:

While cut and extruded noodles can be dried to create a shelf-stable product to be eaten months after production, most peeled, pulled and kneaded noodles are consumed shortly after they are produced.

==Cooking==

Noodles may be cooked from either their fresh (moist) or dry forms. They are generally boiled, although they may also be deep-fried in oil until crispy. Boiled noodles may then be stir fried, served with sauce or other accompaniments, or served in soup, often with meat and other ingredients. Certain rice-noodles are made directly from steaming the raw rice slurry and are only consumed fresh.

Unlike many Western noodles and pastas, Chinese noodles made from wheat flour are usually made from salted dough, and therefore do not require the addition of salt to the liquid in which they are boiled. Chinese noodles also cook very quickly, generally requiring less than 5 minutes to become &quot;al dente&quot; and some taking less than a minute to finish cooking, with thinner noodles requiring less time to cook. Chinese noodles made from rice or mung bean starch do not generally contain salt.

==Types==

===Wheat===

These noodles are made only with wheat flour and water. If the intended product is dried noodles, salt is almost always added to the recipe.
====Lye-water or egg====
These wheat flour noodles are more chewy in texture and yellow in color either due to the addition of lye (sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium hydroxide, or potassium hydroxide) or egg (either using only the egg white, yolk, or both). This class of lye-water noodles () has a subtle but distinctive smell and taste, described by some as being &quot;eggy&quot;.

===Rice===
Rice-based noodles can be: 
#Extruded from a paste and steamed into strands of noodles
#Steamed from a slurry into sheets and then sliced into strands
These noodles are typically made only with rice and water without the addition of salt. Although unorthodox, some producers may choose to add other plant starches to modify the texture of the noodles.

===Starch===
These noodles are made using various plant starches. Mung bean starch noodles will often be cut with tapioca starch to make them more chewy and reduce production costs.

===Oat===

In China, particularly in western Inner Mongolia and Shanxi province, oat (&quot;Avena nuda&quot;) flour is called &quot;yóu miàn&quot; (莜面), and is processed into noodles or thin-walled rolls, which are consumed as staple food. The process of making oat noodles relies on twisting them on a marble plate to ensure the dough will not stick on it, and turning them into strips and thin-rolls. It can be boiled or steamed, then served with different sauces to eat.

=== Millet ===
The oldest archaeological evidence of noodles shows that they came from China and were made from millet, which is an indigenous crop to northern China. In 2005, a team of archaeologists reported finding an earthenware bowl that contained 4000-year-old noodles at the Lajia archaeological site. These noodles were said to resemble lamian, a type of Chinese noodle. Analyzing the husk phytoliths and starch grains present in the sediment associated with the noodles, they were identified as millet belonging to &quot;Panicum miliaceum&quot; and &quot;Setaria italica&quot;.

==Chinese noodle dishes==

The following are a small portion of Chinese dishes that incorporate noodles:
*Ban mian
*Beef chow fun
*Cart noodle
*Char kway teow
*Chow mein
*Laksa
*Lo mein
*Re gan mian
*Wonton noodles

<doc id="501758" wikidata="Q6731660" url="?curid=501758" title="Magnetocrystalline anisotropy">
<text>In physics, a ferromagnetic material is said to have magnetocrystalline anisotropy if it takes more energy to magnetize it in certain directions than in others. These directions are usually related to the principal axes of its crystal lattice. It is a special case of magnetic anisotropy. In other words, the excess energy required to magnetize a specimen in a particular direction over that required to magnetize it along the easy direction is called crystalline anisotropy energy.

== Causes ==
The spin-orbit interaction is the primary source of magnetocrystalline anisotropy. It is basically the orbital motion of the electrons which couples with crystal electric field giving rise to the first order contribution to magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The second order arises due to the mutual interaction of the magnetic dipoles. This effect is weak compared to the exchange interaction and is difficult to compute from first principles, although some successful computations have been made.

== Practical relevance ==
Magnetocrystalline anisotropy has a great influence on industrial uses of ferromagnetic materials. Materials with high magnetic anisotropy usually have high coercivity, that is, they are hard to demagnetize. These are called &quot;hard&quot; ferromagnetic materials and are used to make permanent magnets. For example, the high anisotropy of rare-earth metals is mainly responsible for the strength of rare-earth magnets. During manufacture of magnets, a powerful magnetic field aligns the microcrystalline grains of the metal such that their &quot;easy&quot; axes of magnetization all point in the same direction, freezing a strong magnetic field into the material.

On the other hand, materials with low magnetic anisotropy usually have low coercivity, their magnetization is easy to change. These are called &quot;soft&quot; ferromagnets and are used to make magnetic cores for transformers and inductors. The small energy required to turn the direction of magnetization minimizes core losses, energy dissipated in the transformer core when the alternating current changes direction.

==Thermodynamic theory==
The magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy is generally represented as an expansion in powers of the direction cosines of the magnetization. The magnetization vector can be written , where is the saturation magnetization. Because of time reversal symmetry, only even powers of the cosines are allowed. The nonzero terms in the expansion depend on the crystal system (&quot;e.g.&quot;, cubic or hexagonal). The &quot;order&quot; of a term in the expansion is the sum of all the exponents of magnetization components, &quot;e.g.&quot;, is second order.

===Uniaxial anisotropy===

More than one kind of crystal system has a single axis of high symmetry (threefold, fourfold or sixfold). The anisotropy of such crystals is called &quot;uniaxial anisotropy&quot;. If the axis is taken to be the main symmetry axis of the crystal, the lowest order term in the energy is

:formula_1

The ratio is an energy density (energy per unit volume). This can also be represented in spherical polar coordinates with , , and :

:formula_2

The parameter , often represented as , has units of energy density and depends on composition and temperature.

The minima in this energy with respect to satisfy

:formula_3
If ,
the directions of lowest energy are the directions. The axis is called the &quot;easy axis&quot;. If , there is an &quot;easy plane&quot; perpendicular to the symmetry axis (the basal plane of the crystal).

Many models of magnetization represent the anisotropy as uniaxial and ignore higher order terms. However, if , the lowest energy term does not determine the direction of the easy axes within the basal plane. For this, higher-order terms are needed, and these depend on the crystal system (hexagonal, tetragonal or rhombohedral).

====Hexagonal system====

In a hexagonal system the axis is an axis of sixfold rotation symmetry. The energy density is, to fourth 
order,

:formula_4

The uniaxial anisotropy is mainly determined by these first two terms. Depending on the values and , there are four different kinds of anisotropy (isotropic, easy axis, easy plane and easy cone):

* : the ferromagnet is isotropic.
* and : the axis is an easy axis.
* and : the basal plane is an easy plane.
* and : the basal plane is an easy plane.
* : the ferromagnet has an &quot;easy cone&quot; (see figure to right).

The basal plane anisotropy is determined by the third term, which is sixth-order. The easy directions are projected onto three axes in the basal plane.

Below are some room-temperature anisotropy constants for hexagonal ferromagnets. Since all the values of and are positive, these materials have an easy axis.
Higher order constants, in particular conditions, may lead to first order magnetization processes FOMP.

====Tetragonal and rhombohedral systems====
The energy density for a tetragonal crystal is

:formula_5.

Note that the term, the one that determines the basal plane anisotropy, is fourth order (same as the term). The definition of may vary by a constant multiple between publications.

The energy density for a rhombohedral crystal is

:formula_6.

===Cubic anisotropy===
In a cubic crystal the lowest order terms in the energy are

:formula_7

If the second term can be neglected, the easy axes are the ⟨100⟩ axes (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the , , and , directions) for and the ⟨111⟩ directions for (see images on right).

If is not assumed to be zero, the easy axes depend on both and . These are given in the table below, along with &quot;hard axes&quot; (directions of greatest energy) and &quot;intermediate axes&quot; (saddle points) in the energy). In energy surfaces like those on the right, the easy axes are analogous to valleys, the hard axes to peaks and the intermediate axes to mountain passes.


Below are some room-temperature anisotropy constants for cubic ferromagnets. The compounds involving are ferrites, an important class of ferromagnets. In general the anisotropy parameters for cubic ferromagnets are higher than those for uniaxial ferromagnets. This is consistent with the fact that the lowest order term in the expression for cubic anisotropy is fourth order, while that for uniaxial anisotropy is second order.
==Temperature dependence of anisotropy==

The magnetocrystalline anisotropy parameters have a strong dependence on temperature. They generally decrease rapidly as the temperature approaches the Curie temperature, so the crystal becomes effectively isotropic. Some materials also have an &quot;isotropic point&quot; at which . Magnetite (), a mineral of great importance to rock magnetism and paleomagnetism, has an isotropic point at 130 kelvin.

Magnetite also has a phase transition at which the crystal symmetry changes from cubic (above) to monoclinic or possibly triclinic below. The temperature at which this occurs, called the Verwey temperature, is 120 Kelvin.

==Magnetostriction==

The magnetocrystalline anisotropy parameters are generally defined for ferromagnets that are constrained to remain undeformed as the direction of magnetization changes. However, coupling between the magnetization and the lattice does result in deformation, an effect called magnetostriction. To keep the lattice from deforming, a stress must be applied. If the crystal is not under stress, magnetostriction alters the effective magnetocrystalline anisotropy. If a ferromagnet is single domain (uniformly magnetized), the effect is to change the magnetocrystalline anisotropy parameters.

In practice, the correction is generally not large. In hexagonal crystals, there is no change in . In cubic crystals, there is a small change, as in the table below.

<text>is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the west of Bavaria, Germany with a population of 95,000. Neighbouring districts are (from the north clockwise) Ansbach, Roth, Eichstätt and Donau-Ries. It is located in the south of Middle Franconia, 50 kilometres south of Nuremberg. Largest city and the administrative center is Weißenburg in Bayern.

==Geography==
The district is located on the Hahnenkamm and on the Franconian Alb in the North of the Altmühltal. In the north there are several lakes of the Franconian Lake District. The highest point of the district is the Dürrenberg. The Altmühl flows through the district. From here comes the Solnhofen limestone. Among its nature reserves is the Brombachmoor.

==History==
The district was formed in 1972 by a merger of the districts of Gunzenhausen, Weißenburg, and the previously independent urban district of Weißenburg.
==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of the district is divided into three fields: left, right and bottom. The bottom of the coat of arms (silver kettle hats on blue) derives from the Counts of Pappenheim, and was taken from the coat of arms of the former district Weißenburg. The half eagle (black on yellow) in the right stands for the city of Weißenburg, and the red-yellow horizontal bars in the left are taken from the coat of arms of the former district Gunzenhausen.

<doc id="501765" wikidata="Q3304436" url="?curid=501765" title="List of tallest buildings in Melbourne">
<text>Melbourne is home to approximately 758 completed high-rise buildings. Of those completed and or topped-out, 77 buildings are defined as &quot;skyscrapers&quot;–buildings which reach a height of at least ; more than any other city in Australia. Overall, Melbourne&#x27;s skyline ranks the tallest in the Oceania region and the 24th tallest in the world by the number of completed skyscrapers. Melbourne comprises five of the ten tallest buildings in Australia and the city has routinely hosted the tallest building in Australia to architectural feature or roof. , the tallest building in Melbourne is the 100-storey Australia 108, which stands in height and whilst the second–tallest building in Australia, it is the tallest to roof.

Geographically, most of Melbourne&#x27;s tallest skyscrapers are concentrated in the City Centre precinct; however, other locations of prominent skyscrapers and tall buildings in Melbourne include Box Hill, Carlton, Docklands, Southbank, South Melbourne, South Yarra and St Kilda Road. The Melbourne central business district, defined by a grid of streets known as the Hoddle Grid, has a historically low central shopping area with high rise cluster in the western financial district, and another cluster in eastern end. Buildings are more densely packed in the west than the east, although the east has two of the city&#x27;s tallest buildings to architectural feature—120 Collins Street and 101 Collins Street, respectively, whilst the Rialto Towers (located on the west side) is tallest by roof. In the 2010s, another skyscraper cluster rose in the northern section, with Aurora Melbourne Central the tallest.

Historically, Melbourne has represented several &quot;firsts&quot; and been the holder of various records, both in Australia and internationally. The city is notable for being one of the first cities in the world to build numerous tall office buildings, alongside New York City and Chicago in the United States, though Melbourne&#x27;s first skyscraper boom was very short lived, 1888–1892. Melbourne was the location for Australia&#x27;s first high–rise, the APA Building, constructed during this boom in 1889. Melbourne was also the location for the first modern post World War II high-rise in Australia, ICI House built in 1958. From 1986 to 2005, Melbourne&#x27;s held the title of tallest building in Australia, with the Rialto Towers (1986–1991), 101 Collins Street (1991), and 120 Collins Street (1991–2005). Since 2006, the city has been home to the second-tallest building in the country, the Eureka Tower (2006–2020) and Australia 108 (2020–present); surpassed only by the Gold Coast&#x27;s Q1, both the Eureka Tower, and later Australia 108, have maintained the title of tallest building in Australia to roof.

==History and specifications==


===19th century===
The late 1880s &#x27;land boom&#x27; saw the construction of approximately a dozen &#x27;lofty edifices&#x27; of 8 to 10 floors, made possible by the introduction of a pressurised hydraulic power network to operate lifts, and taking load bearing brickwork to great heights. The APA Building (Australian Building) at 12 floors plus spire, was by far the tallest, and can claim to be Australia&#x27;s first &#x27;skyscraper&#x27; and amongst the tallest building in the world when completed in 1889. Aside from the APA Building, a total of 11 &#x27;skyscrapers&#x27; were located in the Melbourne city centre during this period, including the Finks Building and 3 matching &#x27;Prell&#x27;s Buildings&#x27;. They were all built in an elaborate High Victorian style, with facades of stucco Renaissance Revival elements, except the APA building which was in red brick Queen Anne, prompting architectural historian Miles Lewis to comment that Melbourne had become a &quot;Queen Anne Chicago&quot;. All except two were torn down in the post war boom of the 1960s and 1970s, with the APA controversially demolished in 1981. 

===20th century===
Following much discussion, a height limit was introduced to Melbourne in 1916, along with regulations concerning fire-proof construction. This height is often said to have been the limit of fire ladders at the time, but this was an idea that the then fire chief allowed to be widely circulated even though the tallest ladder rose to only , in order to ensure that fire safety was paramount. The main reasons for the limit, as well as fire proofing, were the preservation of light and air to the streets, avoiding congestion, and the influence of the City Beautiful movement, preferring evenly scaled streetscapes over those with buildings of varying heights. The height limit remained in force for nearly 40 years, allowing only uninhabited &#x27;architectural features&#x27; to project beyond the 40 metre limit. The Manchester Unity Building (1932), for instance, achieved a total height of to the top of its corner tower.

Melbourne was the first city in Australia to undergo a post-war high-rise boom beginning in the late 1950s, (though Sydney in the following decades built more) with over 50 high-rise buildings constructed between the 1970s and 1990s. ICI House (1955) was constructed after being granted a variation to the height limit; at a height of , the building was Australia&#x27;s first modern high-rise. Its variation was on the basis that the design included an open garden space at ground level, introducing the concept of floor area ratio, where a total allowable floor area is used instead of a specific height limit. This was formalised by &#x27;plot ratios&#x27; of 1:8 to 1:12 for different areas of the CBD in the &quot;Borrie Report&quot; in 1964, which was modified into a series of &#x27;plot ratio benefit&#x27; scheme in the early 1980s, where the upper level of floor area could only be achieved in return for certain public benefits, such as a public arcade. Plot ratios remained in force for every site until 1999, when the &#x27;New Format&#x27; Planning Scheme included plot ratios for entire city blocks rather than individual sites, a control that was mostly ignored.

In 1972, 140 William Street (formerly BHP House) became Melbourne&#x27;s first building to surpass the height of , and thus, Melbourne&#x27;s first &quot;skyscraper&quot;. The William Street building was the city&#x27;s tallest for a few years, and remains one of the few heritage registered skyscrapers in Melbourne. Slightly taller, the Optus Centre was completed in 1975; and then in 1977 Nauru House was crowned the tallest building in Melbourne, at a height of . In 1978, what would be the first of two Collins Place towers was opened, at a height of .

By the early 1980s, Melbourne had a total of 6 buildings above , with the completion of the Wentworth (later Regent then Sofitel) Hotel at Collins Place in 1980. In 1986, the Rialto Towers surpassed Sydney&#x27;s MLC Centre as the tallest building not only in Australia but in the Southern Hemisphere, with a height of . At the time of its opening, it was the 25th–tallest building in the world. The 1990s brought Melbourne another 9 buildings over ; 5 of which exceed heights of . Specifically, 1991 saw the construction of the 101 Collins Street, which was crowned the tallest building in Australia and the Southern Hemisphere; it was surpassed in height later that year with the completion of the nearby 120 Collins Street. The skyscraper, which stands at in height, held the titles for tallest building in Australia and the Southern Hemisphere for fourteen years, until the completion of the Gold Coast&#x27;s Q1 in 2005.

===21st century===

During the 2000s, over 20 high-rise structures were completed, including the Eureka Tower (2006), which overtook 120 Collins Street as the tallest building in Melbourne, and further became the second-tallest in Australia (although tallest to its roof). Eureka Tower was also the tallest residential building in the world to roof, until surpassed by Ocean Heights and the HHHR Tower in Dubai. It is currently the 15th-tallest apartment building in the world.

Construction trends significantly increased throughout the 2010s, which included the completion of Prima Pearl (2014) and Aurora Melbourne Central (2019), both of which exceed in height. Throughout the decade, the city experienced an &quot;unprecedented&quot; skyscraper construction boom, with 22 skyscrapers constructed between 2010 and 2019. This feat had been described as the &quot;Manhattanization of Melbourne&quot;.

During this period, new towers in the CBD had average plot ratios of 37:1. In September 2015, the Minister for Planning, Richard Wynne, introduced a 12-month height limit of approximately for all buildings proposed in the Melbourne central business district and segments of Southbank, along with interim planning laws that re-introduced a floor area ratio of 18:1, which could be exceeded up to a maximum of 24:1 only with the provision of certain public benefits. Should projects exceed the plot ratio, developers will need to make a special case to the Minister, outlining the proposal&#x27;s state significance. These controls were made permanent in September 2016. Buildings proposed prior to September 2015, such as Australia 108, which has a plot ratio of 46.6:1, were exempt from the new law.

The beginning of the 2020s saw the completion of Australia 108, which surpassed Eureka Tower as the tallest building in Melbourne and the tallest building in Australia to roof in 2020. It also became the Southern Hemisphere&#x27;s first skyscraper to comprise at least 100 floors, and Melbourne&#x27;s first building to be defined as a &quot;supertall&quot; skyscraper (buildings between the heights of to ). In 2021, 12 skyscrapers were completed in the city— five more than the previous peak in 2020, and more than double prior peaks in 2017, 2005, and 1991. Among the tallest built in 2021 were West Side Place Tower A and Queens Place North Tower, both of which exceed in height. Of future skyscrapers, 6 have topped-out, 7 are under-construction, over 20 have received approval, and another few have been proposed. The tallest of these is the currently approved dual-skyscraper project STH BNK by Beulah. Tower 1 will rise to in height —supplanting Australia 108 as the tallest building in Melbourne and Q1 as the tallest building in Australia— whilst Tower 2 will rise to , taller than any other completed building in Australia outside of Melbourne and the Gold Coast.

The proliferation of skyscrapers in Australia over the past decades has also contributed to the city rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne. Whilst the first skyscraper in Australia was constructed in Sydney in 1967 (Australia Square), Melbourne has had the most skyscrapers in the country and indeed within Oceania, for over 35 years in total; from 1972 to 1989 (equal first with Sydney during 1972–74 and 1976–77), from 1991 to 1999, in 2006 (shared with Sydney), and again since 2015 (equal to Sydney from 2015 to 2016).

===Precincts===

The central business district skyline is broken down into two distinct sections: the east and west, divided by Swanston Street. The tallest buildings on the eastern side of the skyline are 120 Collins Street and 101 Collins Street, whilst the tallest on the western side are the Rialto Towers, 568 Collins Street, and Bourke Place.

Significant new skylines have emerged outside of the Melbourne central business district, especially within the inner-city suburb of Southbank. This precinct, located adjacent to the City Centre, includes some of the tallest buildings in Melbourne, such as Australia 108, Eureka Tower, and Prima Pearl.

South Yarra, St Kilda Road (a locality adjacent to the City Centre), the inner-city suburbs Carlton, and Docklands each comprise a skyscraper. Other inner-city suburbs, such as Port Melbourne and South Melbourne each have skyscrapers in proposed or approved stages of development.

===Functions===
Most of Melbourne&#x27;s skyscrapers constructed by the 1990s were built for commercial purposes—specifically, used as offices. Exceptions to this, include the mixed-use building Sofitel Hotel (1980) on Collins Place, and the all-hotel Crown Towers (1997) in Southbank. 2005 ushered in the first residential skyscrapers in Melbourne, with two built that year. By 2010, 72% of skyscrapers built in Melbourne were of commercial use, 12% residential, 12% mixed-use, and 4% hotel. The trend towards residential skyscrapers has continued significantly; in 2015, 58% of skyscrapers present within the city were of commercial use, 26% residential, 13% mixed-use and 3% hotel. These figures are set to change dramatically by 2020; when factoring those buildings still under-construction (but to be completed by 2020), 44% of the city&#x27;s skyscrapers will be of residential use, 35% commercial, 18% mixed-use, 2% hotel, and 2% government.

==Completed==

===Overall===
Melbourne has 77 skyscrapers completed or topped out within the city, which stand at least tall, based on standard height measurement. Such measurement includes spires and architectural details, but does not include antenna masts. An equal sign (=) following a rank indicates the same height between two or more buildings. An asterisk (*) indicates that the building is still under construction, but has topped out. The &quot;built&quot; column indicates the year in which a building was completed.
Height: S = Spire, R = Roof. 

===Tallest buildings by precinct===
This lists the tallest building in each precinct of Melbourne based on standard height measurement.

===Tallest buildings by function===
This lists the tallest buildings in Melbourne by their respective functions—office, hotel, residential and mixed-use—based on standard height measurement.

===Skyscrapers at least 200 metres in height===
Melbourne comprises 29 skyscrapers (completed or topped-out) which reach a height of at least —more than any other city within Australia and Oceania. Of those, twenty-three skyscrapers are located within the City Centre, five are located within Southbank, and one in Carlton.

<doc id="501767" wikidata="Q754282" url="?curid=501767" title="Soda lime">
<text>Soda lime, a mixture of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and calcium oxide (CaO), is used in granular form within recirculating breathing environments like general anesthesia and its breathing circuit, submarines, rebreathers, and hyperbaric chambers and underwater habitats. Its purpose is to eliminate carbon dioxide () from breathing gases, preventing carbon dioxide retention and, eventually, carbon dioxide poisoning. The creation of soda lime involves treating slaked lime with a concentrated sodium hydroxide solution.

==Chemical components==
The primary components of soda lime include: calcium oxide (CaO) constituting approximately 75%, water () accounting for around 20%, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) making up about 3%, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) present at approximately 0.1%.

==Anaesthesia==

During general anaesthesia, a patient&#x27;s exhaled gases, containing carbon dioxide, pass through an anaesthesia machine&#x27;s breathing circuit, containing a soda lime canister filled with soda lime granules. Medical-grade soda lime includes an indicating dye that changes color when it reaches its carbon dioxide absorption capacity. To ensure proper functioning, a carbon dioxide scrubber (or soda lime canister) should not be used if the indicating dye is activated. Standard anesthesia machines typically contain up to of soda lime granules.

Recent carbon dioxide absorbents have been developed to minimize the risk of toxic by-product formation resulting from the interaction between the absorbent and inhaled anesthetics, like halothane. Some absorbents, including those made from lithium hydroxide, are available for this purpose.

==Space flight==
In space flights, lithium hydroxide (LiOH) is used as a carbon dioxide absorbent due to its low molecular weight (Na: 23 g/mol; Li: 7 g/mol), saving weight during launch. During the Apollo 13 flight, high carbon dioxide levels in the Lunar Module led the crew to adapt spare absorbent cartridges from the Apollo capsule to the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) system.

==Rebreather use==
Exhaled gas in a breathing circuit must pass through a carbon dioxide scrubber where carbon dioxide is absorbed before the gas is circulated for breathing again. In rebreathers, this scrubber is integrated into the breathing loop. However, in larger settings like recompression chambers or submarines, a fan is employed to ensure a continuous flow of gas through the scrubbing canister. The use of indicating dye in United States Navy fleet applications ceased in 1996 due to concerns about potential chemical releases into the circuit.

==Chemical reaction==
The overall chemical reaction is:

:CO2 + Ca(OH)2 → CaCO3 + H2O + heat (in the presence of water)

Each mole of CO2 (44 g) reacts with one mole of calcium hydroxide (74 g) and produces one mole of water (18 g).

The reaction can be considered as a strong-base-catalysed, water-facilitated reaction.

The reaction mechanism of carbon dioxide with soda lime can be decomposed in three elementary steps:

:1) &lt;chem&gt; CO2(g) &lt;=» CO2(aq)&lt;/chem&gt; (CO2 dissolves in water – slow and rate-determining),

:2) &lt;chem&gt;CO2(aq) + NaOH -&gt; NaHCO3&lt;/chem&gt; (bicarbonate formation at high pH),

:3) &lt;chem&gt;NaHCO3 + Ca(OH)2 -&gt; CaCO3 + NaOH + H2O &lt;/chem&gt; (NaOH recycled to step 2 – hence a catalyst).

This sequence of reactions explains the catalytic role played by sodium hydroxide in the system and why soda lime is faster in chemical reactivity than calcium hydroxide alone. The moist sodium hydroxide impregnates the surface and the porosity of calcium hydroxide grains with a high specific surface area. It reacts much more quickly and so contributes to a faster elimination of the carbon dioxide from the rebreathing circuit. The formation of water by the reaction and the moisture from the respiration also act as a solvent for the reaction. Reactions in aqueous phase are generally faster than between a dry gas and a dry solid. Soda lime is commonly used in closed-circuit diving rebreathers and in the anesthesia breathing circuit in anesthesia systems.

The same catalytic effect by the alkali hydroxides (function of the Na2Oeq content of cement) also contributes to the carbonation of portlandite by atmospheric CO2 in concrete although the rate of propagation of the reaction front is there essentially limited by the carbon dioxide diffusion within the concrete matrix less porous.

==Analogy with the alkali–silica reaction==

A similar reaction to above, also catalysed by sodium hydroxide, is the alkali–silica reaction, a slow degradation process causing the swelling and the cracking of concrete containing aggregates rich in reactive amorphous silica. In a very similar way, sodium hydroxide greatly facilitates the dissolution of the amorphous silica. The produced sodium silicate then reacts with the calcium hydroxide (portlandite) present in the hardened cement paste to form calcium silicate hydrate (abbreviated as C-S-H in the cement chemist notation). This silicification reaction of calcium hydroxide on its turn continuously releases again sodium hydroxide in solution, maintaining a high pH, and the cycle continues up to the total disappearance of portlandite or reactive silica in the exposed concrete. Without the catalysis of this reaction by sodium- or potassium-soluble hydroxides, the alkali–silica reaction would not proceed or would be limited to a very slow pozzolanic reaction. The alkali–silica reaction can be written like the soda lime reaction, by simply substituting carbon dioxide by silica dioxide in the reactions mentioned here above as follows:

<doc id="501773" wikidata="Q24740310" url="?curid=501773" title="Cytochrome C1">
<text>Cytochrome C1 (also known as Complex III subunit 4) is a protein encoded by the &quot;CYC1&quot; gene. Cytochrome is a heme-containing subunit of the cytochrome b-c1 complex, which accepts electrons from Rieske protein and transfers electrons to cytochrome c in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It is formed in the cytosol and targeted to the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Cytochrome c1 belongs to the cytochrome c family of proteins.

== Function ==
Cytochrome C1 plays a role in the electron transfer during oxidative phosphorylation. As an iron-sulfur protein approaches the b-c1 complex, it accepts an electron from the cytochrome b subunit, then undergoes a conformational change to attach to cytochrome c1. There, the electron carried by the iron-sulfur protein is transferred to the heme carried by cytochrome c1. This electron is then transferred to a heme carried by cytochrome c. This creates a reduced species of cytochrome c, which separates from the b-c1 complex and moves to the last enzyme in the electron transport chain, cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV).

== Species ==
&quot;CYC1&quot; is a human gene that is conserved in chimpanzee, Rhesus monkey, dog, cow, mouse, rat, zebrafish, fruit fly, mosquito, &quot;C. elegans&quot;, &quot;S. cerevisiae,&quot; &quot;K. lactis&quot;, &quot;E. gossypii&quot;, &quot;S. pombe&quot;, &quot;N. crassa&quot;, &quot;A. thaliana&quot;, rice, and frog. There are orthologs of CYC1 in 137 known organisms.

In its structure and function, the cytochrome b-c1 complex bears extensive analogy to the cytochrome b6f complex of chloroplasts and cyanobacteria; cytochrome c1 plays an analogous role to cytochrome f, despite their different structures.

== Clinical relevance ==
Mutations in the &quot;CYC1&quot; gene are associated with mitochondrial complex III deficiency nuclear type 6. The disease symptoms include early childhood onset of severe lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis, usually in response to infection. Insulin-responsive hyperglycemia is also present, but psychomotor development appears normal. Mutation of &quot;CYC1&quot; was observed to cause instability in the cytochrome b-c1 complex, which decreased its ability to create energy through oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial complex III deficiency nuclear type 6 is autosomal recessive.

<doc id="501780" wikidata="Q379740" url="?curid=501780" title="Quoll">
<text>Quolls (; genus Dasyurus) are carnivorous marsupials native to Australia and New Guinea. They are primarily nocturnal, and spend most of the day in a den. Of the six species of quoll, four are found in Australia and two in New Guinea. Another two species are known from fossil remains in Pliocene and Pleistocene deposits in Queensland. 

Genetic evidence indicates that quolls evolved around 15 million years ago in the Miocene, and that the ancestors of the six species had all diverged by around four million years ago. The six species vary in weight and size, from to . They have brown or black fur and pink noses. They are largely solitary, but come together for a few social interactions, such as mating, which occurs during the winter season. A female gives birth to up to 30 pups, but the number that can be raised to adulthood is limited by the number of teats (6–7). They have a life span of 1–5 years (species dependent).

Quolls eat smaller mammals, small birds, lizards, and insects. All species have drastically declined in numbers since Australasia was colonised by Europeans, with one species, the eastern quoll, becoming extinct on the Australian mainland in the 1960s. Major threats to their survival include the toxic cane toad, predators such as feral cats and foxes, urban development, and poison baiting. Conservation efforts include captive breeding programs and reintroductions.

== Taxonomy ==
The name &quot;Dasyurus&quot; (from Ancient Greek δασύουρος, &quot;dasýouros&quot;) means &quot;hairy-tail&quot;, and was coined by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1796 from δασύς (&quot;dasýs&quot;) &quot;hairy&quot; and οὐρά (&quot;ourá&quot;) &quot;tail&quot;.

In 1770, Captain Cook collected quolls on his exploration of the east coast of Australia, adopting an Aboriginal name for the animals. Although the origin of Cook&#x27;s specimens are unclear, the word and its variants &quot;je-quoll&quot;, &quot;jaquol&quot; or &quot;taquol&quot; are derived from the word &quot;&quot; in the language of the Guugu Yimithirr people of far north Queensland. No evidence indicates the local indigenous people used the word in the Sydney area. They were likened in appearance to a polecat or marten in the earliest reports, the tiger quoll (spotted-tailed) being called &quot;spotted marten&quot; and eastern quoll &quot;spotted opossum&quot;, but by 1804, the names &quot;native fox&quot;, &quot;native cat&quot; and &quot;tiger cat&quot; had been adopted by early settlers; quolls are still called &quot;marsupial foxes&quot; or &quot;marsupial cats&quot;.

In the 1960s, noted naturalist David Fleay pushed for the revival of the term &quot;quoll&quot; to replace the then-current vernacular names that he felt were misleading.
Four species have been recovered from Pleistocene cave deposits from Mount Etna Caves National Park near Rockhampton in central Queensland. Remains of the spotted-tailed quoll and the northern quoll, and a species either identical or very similar to the eastern quoll, as well as a prehistoric species as yet undescribed, all lived in what was a rainforest climate. The northern quoll is still found in the region. The fossil species &quot;D. dunmalli&quot;, described by Bartholomai in 1971, is the oldest species recovered to date. Its remains were found in Pliocene deposits near Chinchilla in southeastern Queensland. Known only from a lower jaw and some teeth, it was a relative of the spotted-tailed quoll.

The first species described, the eastern quoll, was originally placed in the American opossum genus &quot;Didelphis&quot; by an anonymous author, and named &quot;Didelphis maculata&quot;. This name is no longer considered valid, and the second part of the name is now given to a different species, the spotted-tailed quoll, &quot;Dasyurus maculatus&quot;, while the eastern quoll was renamed &quot;Dasyurus viverrinus&quot; by George Shaw in 1800.

The tribe Dasyurini, to which quolls belong, also includes the Tasmanian devil, the antechinus, the kowari, and the mulgara. Genetic analysis of cytochrome b DNA and 12S rRNA
of the mitochondria indicates the quolls evolved and diversified in the late Miocene between 15 and 5 million years ago, a time of great diversification in marsupials. The ancestors of all current species had diverged by the early Pliocene, around 4 million years ago.

===Species===
The genus &quot;Dasyurus&quot; consists of six species of quoll:
The following is a phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial genome sequences:
==Description==
Quolls are solitary, nocturnal animals. Depending on the species, adult quolls can be long, with hairy tails about long. Average weight differs greatly depending on the species; male western and eastern quolls weigh about and females . The spotted-tailed quoll is the largest, with the male weighing about and the female . The northern quoll is the smallest, and the male weighs on average , and the female . Their coats are sandy, brown, or black, with a sparse scattering of white spots. They have bright pink noses and long snouts.

Females have &gt;8 teats and develop a pouch during the breeding season, which opens toward the tail (with the exception of the spotted-tailed quoll, which has a true pouch) when they are rearing young. Their natural lifespans are 1–5 years; the larger species tend to live longer.
==Distribution and habitat==

Quolls are indigenous to mainland Australia, the island state of Tasmania, and New Guinea. The six species were once widely distributed across the three land masses, but are now restricted to only a few areas. 

Although primarily ground-dwelling, the genus has developed secondary arboreal characteristics. Each species of quoll lives in distinct geographical areas. The spotted-tailed quoll is an exclusively zone species; inhabiting wetter habitats. The western quoll also inhabits mesic habitat, but has adapted to arid regions across inland Australia, while the northern quoll inhabits tropical habitat of high rainfall.

==Behaviour==
Quolls are carnivorous marsupials. They are primarily nocturnal, sleeping in hollowed-out logs or rocky dens and coming out to hunt during the night, though on rare occasions they can be seen looking for prey during the day.

They are mostly ground-dwelling, but it is not uncommon to see a quoll climbing a tree. Quolls mark their territory several kilometres away from their dens. A male&#x27;s territory often overlaps many females&#x27; territories, and male and female quolls only meet for mating. Some quolls use communal latrines, usually on an outcropping used for marking territory and social functions, which may have up to 100 droppings in them. Quolls are mostly solitary, limiting contact with other quolls to mating or other social activities.
==Diet==

Quolls are mostly carnivorous. The smaller quolls primarily eat insects, birds, frogs, lizards and fruit; the larger species eat birds, reptiles, and mammals, including echidnas and possums. The spotted-tailed quoll&#x27;s diet is dominated by mammals such as brushtail possums, rabbits, hares and invertebrates. The exact mix is variable depending on the availability of prey after bushfires, and can include carrion or bandicoots when food is scarce. The other species of quoll have also been known to eat carrion.

Quolls hunt by stalking. Quolls pin small prey down with their front paws while devouring it, and jump onto larger prey, sinking in their claws and closing their jaws around the neck. The paws and vibrissae of quolls allow them to reach into small burrows to find prey. Quolls can obtain all the water they need from their food, making them adaptable during droughts or other periods of water shortage. A study of historical records revealed 111 written accounts of quolls opportunistically feeding on human remains in Australia.

== Reproduction ==
Mating occurs during the winter months. Once a female quoll has been impregnated, the folds on her abdomen convert into a pouch that opens at the back. The gestation period is ~21 days (species dependent). A newborn quoll, or joey, is the size of a grain of rice at birth. Up to 30 quolls (species dependent) can be born in each litter, but the number that can be raised is limited by the number of teats. The survivors fuse to the teats and suckle milk in their mother&#x27;s pouch for 6–8 weeks. After this, the pups unfuse from the teats and the mother can deposit them in a den where they can remain for over a month.

Quolls reach maturity at one year old, and have a natural lifespan of 1–5 years (species dependent). The appearance of their pouches have been reported to be a reliable indicator of reproductive status: during the follicular phase pouches are red and have secretions, and after ovulation pouches are deep and wet. This can determine where a female quoll is in her ovarian cycle, which is anticipated to be helpful in breeding management.

==Threats==
 Cane toads were introduced into Queensland in 1935; their numbers have since grown exponentially. These poisonous toads pose a significant threat to the northern quoll, which may die after consuming one. The Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has stated that cane toads are highly invasive and are major threats to the survival of northern quolls.

Predators such as red foxes and feral cats prey on quolls and compete with them for food. For example, both quolls and foxes catch and consume rabbits. Since the introduction of foxes, quoll populations have declined dramatically. Foxes have been eradicated from many of the islands off the coast of Australia in an effort to protect quolls.

Quoll habitat suffers from urbanisation, housing development, mining development, and agricultural expansion. Habitats are also being destroyed by large herbivores trampling the grass and overgrowth, making camouflage difficult. Bushfires and weeds also contribute to habitat destruction.

The natural poison fluoroacetate (Compound 1080) is commonly used in Australia to control introduced pests such as European rabbits, foxes, feral predators, and dingoes. The poison is extremely toxic to introduced pests, but less so to native animals as it is found naturally in many Australian plants. However, juvenile quolls may be susceptible to the poison. research was being undertaken to determine whether the number of quolls protected from predators may be less than those killed by the poison.

==Conservation==
Since 1770, all Australian quoll species have declined due to habitat destruction through urbanisation. European rabbits were introduced to Australia with the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788 as part of biodiversity enrichment efforts. The native quolls predated upon rabbits and prior to 1870, many accounts recorded quolls impeding their establishment on the mainland while island colonies thrived. In response, quolls were systematically exterminated by colonists to defend introduced species such as chickens; rabbits populations subsequently reached plague proportions.

Quolls have been studied in captivity, with the ultimate aim of supporting conservation of the species, and future translocations. These studies include investigations into their haematology and blood biochemistry profiles, and dietary studies.

Creating a native pet industry in Australia related to quolls could aid in their conservation. However, concerns exist about this methodology in regards to animal husbandry, conservation benefits, and other issues. Some scientists believe that keeping quolls as pets could aid in their long-term conservation, but further research is needed.

=== Spotted-tailed quoll ===
In late October 2011, a litter of five spotted-tailed quoll pups was born at Wild Life Sydney in Darling Harbour, Australia. The pups were born to inexperienced parents, both just one year old. The reason for the young parents was because older male quolls can become violent and kill the female if they do not want to mate. By breeding one-year-old quolls, there was no threat of violence. Four of the quoll pups will be sent to other zoos or wildlife parks across Australia, but one, which the researchers named Nelson, will stay at the centre to become an &quot;ambassador for all quolls&quot;.

On 28 September 2023, it was reported that a farmer in Beachport, South Australia set up a trap to catch what he thought was a fox or a cat eating his chickens and caught a Spotted-tailed quoll. It is the first time in 130 years that a quoll has been found in South Australia. It was considered to be extinct in South Australia. The captured quoll was handed over to the National Parks and Wildlife Service where it will be DNA tested and treated by a veterinarian.

=== Western quoll ===
Fox control programs have benefited the western quoll. The Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia) monitors western quoll populations in the Jarrah Forest as part of its faunal management programs, as well as ongoing research into fox control, timber harvesting, and prescribed burning.

The Perth Zoo has been monitoring a successful captive-breeding program since 1989. It has successfully bred more than 60 western quolls, most of which it transferred to Julimar Conservation Park, with proposals to translocate to Wheatbelt reserves and Shark Bay.

=== Eastern quoll ===
In 2003, the eastern quoll was reintroduced to a 473 ha fox-proof fenced sanctuary at Mt Rothwell Biodiversity Interpretation Centre at Mount Rothwell in Victoria. In 2016, the eastern quoll was also successfully reintroduced to Mulligans Flat Woodland Sanctuary in the Australian Capital Territory.

Bristol Zoo was the first zoo in the UK to successfully breed eastern quolls.

In March 2018, twenty eastern quolls bred in a wildlife park in Tasmania were released into the Booderee National Park on the south coast of NSW. In May 2021, the reintroduction of eastern quolls to Booderee National Park has been reported to have failed when numbers were down to one male.

=== Northern quoll ===
The northern quoll is threatened by toxic cane toads, but a University of Sydney project revealed in 2010 is teaching them to avoid eating the invasive amphibians.

In 2008, the Northern Territory Wildlife Park in Australia recorded their first litter of northern quoll pups in the park. The quolls bred well in captivity, with over 15 litters in the 2008 breeding season alone.

=== Bronze quoll ===
The bronze quoll occurs in a few protected areas, such as Wasur National Park and Tonda Wildlife Management Area. More research on distribution and threats is needed for further conservation.

==Culture contexts==
Tjilpa is the name given to the quoll amongst the Northern Arrernte language group of Australian Aboriginal people.

<doc id="501787" wikidata="Q1423906" url="?curid=501787" title="GNU/Linux naming controversy">
<text>Since the 1990s there is an ongoing controversy whether computer operating systems that use GNU software and the Linux kernel should be referred to as &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; or &quot;Linux&quot; systems.

Proponents of the term &quot;Linux&quot; argue that it is far more commonly used by the public and media and that it serves as a generic term for systems that combine that kernel with software from multiple other sources, while proponents of the term &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; note that &quot;GNU&quot; alone would be just as good a name for GNU variants which combine the GNU operating system software with software from other sources.

The term &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; is promoted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and its founder Richard Stallman. Their reasoning is that the operating system is seen as a modified version of the GNU operating system. Linux as a kernel is just a part of an operating system, whereas the whole operating system is basically the GNU system. Several distributions of operating systems containing the Linux kernel use the name that the FSF prefers, such as Debian, Trisquel and Parabola GNU/Linux-libre. Others claim that GNU/Linux is a useful name to make a distinction between those and Linux distributions such as Android and Alpine Linux.

== History ==
In 1983, Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, set forth plans of a complete Unix-like operating system, called GNU, composed entirely of free software. In September of that year, Stallman published a manifesto in &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot; detailing his new project publicly, outlining his vision of free software. Software development work began in January 1984. By 1991, the GNU mid-level portions of the operating system were almost complete, and the upper level could be supplied by the X Window System, but the lower level (kernel, device drivers, system-level utilities and daemons) was still mostly lacking.

The kernel officially developed by GNU was called GNU Hurd. The Hurd followed an ambitious microkernel design, which proved unexpectedly difficult to implement early on. However, in 1991, Linus Torvalds independently released the first version of the Linux kernel. Early Linux developers ported GNU code, including the GNU C Compiler, to run with Linux, while the free software community adopted the use of the Linux kernel as the missing kernel for the GNU operating system. This work filled the remaining gaps in providing a completely free operating system.

Over the next few years, several suggestions arose for naming operating systems using the Linux kernel and GNU components. In 1992, the Yggdrasil Linux distribution adopted the name &quot;Linux/GNU/X&quot;. In Usenet and mailing-list discussions, one can find usages of &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; as early as 1992, and of &quot;GNU+Linux&quot; as early as 1993. The Debian project, which was at one time sponsored by the Free Software Foundation, switched to calling its product &quot;Debian GNU/Linux&quot; in early 1994.
This change followed a request by Richard Stallman (who initially proposed &quot;LiGNUx,&quot; but suggested &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; instead after hearing complaints about the awkwardness of the former term). GNU&#x27;s June 1994 &quot;Bulletin&quot; described &quot;Linux&quot; as a &quot;free Unix system for 386 machines&quot; (with &quot;many of the utilities and libraries&quot; from GNU), but the January 1995 &quot;Bulletin&quot; switched to the term &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; instead.

Stallman&#x27;s and the FSF&#x27;s efforts to include &quot;GNU&quot; in the name started around 1994, but were reportedly mostly via private communications (such as the above-mentioned request to Debian) until 1996. In May 1996, Stallman released Emacs 19.31 with the Autoconf system target &quot;linux&quot; changed to &quot;lignux&quot; (shortly thereafter changed to &quot;linux-gnu&quot; in emacs 19.32), and included an essay &quot;Linux and the GNU system&quot; suggesting that people use the terms &quot;Linux-based GNU system&quot; (or &quot;GNU/Linux system&quot; or &quot;Lignux&quot; for short). He later used &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; exclusively, and the essay was superseded by Stallman&#x27;s 1997 essay, &quot;Linux and the GNU System&quot;.

== Composition of operating systems ==
Modern free software and open-source software operating systems are composed of software by many different authors, including the Linux kernel developers, the GNU project, and other vendors such as those behind the X Window System. Desktop and server-based distributions use GNU software such as the GNU C Library (glibc), GNU Core Utilities (coreutils), GNU Compiler Collection, GNU Binutils, GNU gzip, GNU tar, GNU gettext, GNU grep, GNU awk, GNU sed, GNU Findutils, gnupg, libgcrypt, gnutls, GRUB, GNU readline, GNU ncurses, and the Bash shell.

In a 2002 analysis of the source code for Red Hat Linux 7.1, a typical Linux distribution, the total size of the packages from the GNU project was found to be much larger than the Linux kernel. Later, a 2011 analysis of the Ubuntu distribution&#x27;s &quot;Natty&quot; release main repository found that 8% to 13% of it consisted of GNU components (the range depending on whether GNOME is considered part of GNU), while only 6% is taken by the Linux kernel (9% when including its direct dependencies). Determining exactly what constitutes the &quot;operating system&quot; &quot;per se&quot; is a matter of continuing debate.

On the other hand, some embedded systems, such as handheld devices and smartphones (like Google&#x27;s Android), residential gateways (routers), and Voice over IP devices, are engineered with space efficiency in mind and use a Linux kernel with few or no components of GNU, due to perceived issues surrounding bloat, and impeded performance. A system running μClinux is likely to substitute uClibc for glibc, and BusyBox for coreutils. Google&#x27;s Linux-based Android operating system does not use any GNU components or libraries, using Google&#x27;s own BSD-based Bionic C library in place of glibc. The FSF agrees that &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; is not an appropriate name for these systems.

There are also systems that use a GNU userspace and/or C library on top of a non-Linux kernel, for example Debian GNU/Hurd (GNU userland on the GNU kernel) or Debian GNU/kFreeBSD (which uses the GNU coreutils and C library with the kernel from FreeBSD).

== Opinions ==

=== GNU/Linux ===
The FSF justifies the name &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; primarily on the grounds that the GNU project was specifically developing a complete system, of which they argue that the Linux kernel filled one of the final gaps; the large number of GNU components and GNU source code used in such systems is a secondary argument:

Other arguments include that the name &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; recognizes the role that the free-software movement played in building modern free and open source software communities, that the GNU project played a larger role in developing packages and software for GNU/Linux or Linux distributions, and that using the word &quot;Linux&quot; to refer to the Linux kernel, the operating system and entire distributions of software leads to confusion on the differences about the three. Because of this confusion, legal threats and public relations campaigns apparently directed against the kernel, such as those launched by the SCO Group or the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution (AdTI), have been misinterpreted by many commentators who assume that the whole operating system is being targeted. SCO and the AdTI have even been accused of deliberately exploiting this confusion.

Regarding suggestions that renaming efforts stem from egotism or personal pique, Stallman has responded that his interest is not in giving credit to himself but to the GNU Project: &quot;Some people think that it&#x27;s because I want my ego to be fed. Of course, I&#x27;m not asking you to call it &#x27;Stallmanix&#x27;.&quot; In response to another common suggestion that many people have contributed to the system and that a short name cannot credit all of them, the FSF has argued that this cannot justify calling the system &quot;Linux&quot;, since they believe that the GNU project&#x27;s contribution was ultimately greater than that of the Linux kernel in these related systems.

In 2010, Stallman stated that naming is not simply a matter of giving equal mention to the GNU Project, saying that because the system is more widely referred as &quot;Linux&quot;, people tend to &quot;think it&#x27;s all Linux, that it was all started by Mr. Torvalds in 1991, and they think it all comes from his vision of life, and that&#x27;s the really bad problem.&quot;

Ariadne Conill, developer and security chair of Alpine Linux, has stated that in her opinion GNU/Linux is the correct name when referring to Linux distributions that are based on glibc and GNU coreutils, such as Debian and Fedora Linux. This can be contrasted to other Linux distributions which are based on bionic (Android) and musl (Alpine).

=== Linux ===
Proponents of naming the operating systems &quot;Linux&quot; state that &quot;Linux&quot; is used far more often than &quot;GNU/Linux&quot;.

Eric S. Raymond writes (in the &quot;Linux&quot; entry of the Jargon File):

When Linus Torvalds was asked in the documentary &quot;Revolution OS&quot; whether the name &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; was justified, he replied:

An earlier comment by Torvalds on the naming controversy was:

The name &quot;GNU/Linux,&quot; particularly when using Stallman&#x27;s preferred pronunciation, has been criticized for its perceived clumsiness and verbosity, a factor that Torvalds has cited as the downfall of operating systems such as 386BSD.

The &quot;Linux Journal&quot; speculated that Stallman&#x27;s advocacy of the combined name stems from frustration that &quot;Linus got the glory for what [Stallman] wanted to do.&quot;

Others have suggested that, regardless of the merits, Stallman&#x27;s persistence in what sometimes seems a lost cause makes him and GNU look bad. For example, Larry McVoy (author of BitKeeper, once used to manage Linux kernel development) opined that &quot;claiming credit only makes one look foolish and greedy&quot;.

Many users and vendors who prefer the name &quot;Linux,&quot; such as Jim Gettys, one of the original developers of the X Window System, point to the inclusion of non-GNU, non-kernel tools, such as KDE, LibreOffice, and Firefox, in end-user operating systems based on the Linux kernel:

<text>Josephine &quot;Josie&quot; Ho Chiu-yi (; born 26 December 1974) is a singer and actress from Hong Kong. She is the daughter of the Macao casino magnate Stanley Ho.

==Acting career==
She has played many roles, including portraying the parts of prostitutes, which were in strong contrast to her own wealthy upbringing as a billionaire&#x27;s daughter. For the film &quot;Exiled&quot;, Ho did not work with a script. Recalling the experience in a recent interview, she said of director Johnnie To, &quot;[He] basically tells actors what to do ... Johnnie wants us to come to the set with our mind completely clean, like a white piece of paper. That way, he can draw whatever he wishes on us.&quot; Ho starred alongside Eason Chan in the Pang Ho-cheung directed slasher film, &quot;Dream Home&quot;.

In 2009, Ho along with husband Conroy Chan, and Andrew Ooi, co-founded 852 Films, a film production company.

==Personal life==
Ho is the youngest daughter of businessman Stanley Ho and Ho&#x27;s second wife Lucina Lam. She has 3 older sisters and 1 younger brother, Pansy, Daisy, Maisy and Lawrence, as well as numbers of half-brothers and half-sisters.

In November 2003, Ho married musician-actor Conroy Chan Chi-chung in Australia.

She credits her oldest sister Pansy with supporting her early efforts to establish a singing career over the objections of their father.

<text>Banteay Srei ( ) is a 10th century CE Cambodian temple dedicated to the Hindu gods Shiva and Parvati. Located in the area of Angkor, it lies near the hill of Phnom Dei, north-east of the main group of temples that once belonged to the medieval capitals of Yaśodharapura and Angkor Thom. Banteay Srei is built largely of red sandstone, a medium that lends itself to the elaborate decorative wall carvings which are still observable today. The buildings themselves are miniature in scale, unusually so when measured by the standards of Angkorian construction. These factors have made the temple extremely popular with tourists, and have led to its being widely praised as the jewel of Khmer art.

==History==

===Foundation and dedication===

Consecrated on 22 April 967 CE, Banteay Srei was the only major temple at Angkor not built by rulers; its construction is credited to the courtiers named Vishnukumara and Yajnavaraha (modern ), who served as counsellors to King Rajendravarman II (modern ). The foundational stela says that Yajnavaraha, grandson of King Harshavarman I, was a scholar and philanthropist who helped those who suffered from illness, injustice, or poverty. His pupil was the future King Jayavarman V (r. 968 – ca. 1001). Originally, the temple was surrounded by a town called Ishvarapura.
Yajnavaraha&#x27;s temple was primarily dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. Originally, it carried the name &quot;Tribhuvanamaheshvara&quot;—great lord of the threefold world—in reference to the Shiva statue that served as its central religious image. However, the temple buildings appear to be divided along the central east–west axis between those buildings located south of the axis, which are devoted to Shiva, and those north of the axis, which are devoted to Vishnu.

The temple&#x27;s modern name, &quot;Banteay Srei&quot;—citadel of the women, or citadel of beauty—is probably related to the intricacy of the bas relief carvings found on the walls and the tiny dimensions of the buildings themselves. Some have speculated that it relates to the many devatas carved into the walls of the buildings.

===Expansion and rededication===
&quot;Banteay Srei&quot; was subject to further expansion and rebuilding work in the eleventh century CE. At some point it came under the control of the king and had its original dedication changed; the inscription K 194 from &quot;Phnom Sandak&quot;, dated Monday, the 14th July 1119 AD records (line B 13) the temple being given to the priest &quot;Divakarapandita&quot; and being rededicated to Shiva. It remained in use at least until the fourteenth century CE according to the last known inscription K 569, dated Thursday, 8 August 1303 CE.

===Restoration===
The temple was rediscovered in 1914 and was the subject of a celebrated case of art theft when André Malraux stole four devatas in 1923 (he was soon arrested, and the figures were returned). The incident stimulated interest in the site, which was cleared the following year.

In the 1930s Banteay Srei was restored through the first important use of anastylosis at Angkor whereby a ruined building or monument is restored using the original architectural elements to the greatest degree possible. Until the discovery of the foundation stela in 1936, it had been assumed that the extreme decoration indicated a later date than was the case.

To prevent the site from water damage, the joint Cambodian-Swiss Banteay Srei Conservation Project installed a drainage system between 2000 and 2003. Measures were also taken to prevent damage to the temples walls from nearby trees.

Unfortunately, the temple has been ravaged by pilfering and vandalism. When, toward the end of the 20th century, authorities removed some original statues and replaced them with concrete replicas, looters took to attacking the replicas. A statue of Shiva and Parvati, removed to the National Museum in Phnom Penh for safekeeping, was attempted to be assaulted in the museum itself and the vandals were caught later and the statues were safely kept.

==Materials and style==
Banteay Srei is built largely of a hard red sandstone that can be carved like wood. Brick and laterite were used only for the enclosure walls and some structural elements. The temple is known for the beauty of its sandstone lintels and pediments.

A pediment is the roughly triangular space above a rectangular doorway or openings. At Banteay Srei, pediments are relatively large in comparison to the openings below, and take a sweeping gabled shape. For the first time in the history of Khmer architecture, whole scenes of mythological subject-matter are depicted on the pediments.

A lintel is a horizontal beam spanning the gap between two posts. Some lintels serve a structural purpose, serving to support the weight of the superstructure, while others are purely decorative in purpose. The lintels at Banteay Srei are beautifully carved, rivalling those of the 9th century Preah Ko style in quality.

Noteworthy decorative motifs include Kala (a toothy mythical lion), the guardian dvarapalas (an armed protector of the temple) and devatas (gods and goddesses), the false door, and the colonette. Indeed, decorative carvings seem to cover almost every available surface. According to pioneering Angkor scholar Maurice Glaize, &quot;Given the very particular charm of Banteay Srei – its remarkable state of preservation and the excellence of a near perfect ornamental technique – one should not hesitate, of all the monuments of the Angkor group, to give it the highest priority.&quot; At Banteay Srei, wrote Glaize, &quot;the work relates more closely to the art of the goldsmith and to carving in wood than to sculpture in stone&quot;.

==The site==

The site consists of three concentric rectangular enclosures constructed on an east–west axis. A causeway situated on the axis leads from an outer gopura, or gate, to the third or outermost of the three enclosures. The inner enclosure contains the sanctuary, consisting of an entrance chamber and three towers, as well as two buildings conventionally referred to as libraries.

===The outer gopura===
The gopura is all that remains of the outer wall surrounding the town of Ishvarapura. The wall is believed to have measured approximately 500 m square, and may have been constructed of wood. The gopura&#x27;s eastern pediment shows Indra, who was associated with that direction, mounted on his three-headed elephant Airavata. The 67 m causeway with the remains of corridors on either side connects the gopura with the third enclosure. North and south of this causeway are galleries with a north–south orientation.

===The third (outer) enclosure===

The third enclosure is 95 by 110 m; it is surrounded by a laterite wall breached by gopuras at the eastern and western ends. Neither pediment of the eastern gopura is &quot;in situ&quot;. The west-facing pediment is now located in the Guimet Museum in Paris. It depicts a scene from the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; in which the asura brothers Sunda and Upasunda fight over the apsara Tilottama and both Sunda and Upasunda kill each other and Tilottama escapes. The east-facing pediment is lying on the ground. It depicts a scene from the &quot;Ramayana&quot; in which the demon Maricha seizes Rama&quot;&quot;&#x27;s wife Sita and Maricha is killed by Rama. Most of the area within the third enclosure is occupied by a moat divided into two parts by causeways to the east and west.

===The second enclosure===
The second enclosure sits between an outer laterite wall measuring 38 by 42 m, with gopuras at the eastern and western ends, and a brick inner enclosure wall, measuring 24 by 24 m. The western gopura features an interesting bas relief depicting the duel of the Vanara Kings Vali and Sugriva, as well as Rama&#x27;s intervention on Sugriva&#x27;s behalf and Rama kills Vali and makes Sugriva win the duel. The inner enclosure wall has collapsed, leaving a gopura at the eastern end and a brick shrine at the western. The eastern pediment of the gopura shows Shiva in the form of Nataraja; the west-facing pediment has an image of Karaikkal Ammaiyar, one of the three women saints amongst the sixty three Nayanars (hounds of Shiva). Likewise, the laterite galleries which once filled the second enclosure (one each to north and south, two each to east and west) have partially collapsed. A pediment on one of the galleries shows Vishnu as Narasimha, the fourth avatara of Vishnu in the Dashavatara disemboweling and killing the demon Hiranyakashipu to death and Narashima killed Hiranyakashipu.

===The first (inner) enclosure===
Between the gopuras on the collapsed inner wall are the buildings of the inner enclosure: a library in the south-east corner and another in the north-east corner, and in the centre the sanctuary set on a T-shaped platform 0.9 m high. Besides being the most extravagantly decorated parts of the temple, these have also been the most successfully restored (helped by the durability of their sandstone and their small scale). In 2010, the first enclosure is open to visitors again, but the inner temples are roped off and inaccessible.

====The libraries====

The two libraries are of brick, laterite and sandstone. Each library has two pediments, one on the eastern side and one on the western. According to Maurice Glaize, the four library pediments, &quot;representing the first appearance of tympanums with scenes, are works of the highest order. Superior in composition to any which followed, they show true craftsmanship in their modelling in a skilful blend of stylisation and realism.&quot;
The east-facing pediment on the southern library shows Shiva and Parvati seated on the summit of Mount Kailasha, their mythological abode. Their respective consorts Parvati and Shiva both sit near them and clings anxiously to their torsos. Other beings are also present on the slopes of the mountain, arranged in a strict hierarchy of three tiers from top to bottom. In the top tier sit bearded wise saints and ascetics, in the middle tier mythological figures with the heads of animals and the bodies of humans, and in the bottom tier large animals, including a number of lions. In the middle of the scene stands the ten-headed demon king Ravana. Ravana is shaking the mountain in its very foundations as the animals flee from his presence and as the wise saints and mythological beings discuss the situation and pray to Parvati and Shiva. According to the legend, Shiva and Parvati stopped Ravana from shaking the mountain by using their toes to press down on the mountain and to trap Ravana underneath before releasing him after sometime.
The west-facing pediment on southern library shows Shiva again seated on the summit of Mount Kailasha. He is looking to his left at the god of love Kamadeva, who is aiming an arrow at him. Parvati sits to Shiva&#x27;s right and Shiva sits to Parvati&#x27;s left; he is handing her a chain of beads and she is taking it from him. The slopes of the mountain are crowded with other beings, again arranged in a strict hierarchy from top to bottom. Just under Shiva and Parvati sits a group of bearded wise saints and ascetics, under whom the second tier is occupied by the mythological beings with the heads of animals and the bodies of humans; the lowest tier belongs the common people, who mingle sociably with tame deer and large gentle cattle and other animals. According to the legend, Kamadeva fired an arrow at Shiva in order to cause Shiva to take an interest in Parvati. Shiva and Parvati, however, was greatly disturbed by this provocation as they did not want him to do so, and both burned Kamadeva by gazing upon him with their third eyes, burning Kamadeva to ashes and resurrecting him later.

The east-facing pediment on the northern library shows the god of the sky Indra creating enormous rains to put out a forest fire started by the god of fire Agni for purposes of killing the Naga king Takshaka who lived in Khandava Forest. In the &quot;Mahabharata,&quot; Krishna, the eighth avatara of Vishnu in the Dashavatara of Vishnu and his cousin, the Pandava Arjuna are shown helping Agni by firing a dense hail of arrows to block and destroy Indra&#x27;s rains. Takshaka&#x27;s son Ashvasena is depicted attempting to escape from the conflagration and he escapes so, while other animals stampede about in panic and also escape away.

The west-facing pediment on the northern library depicts Vishnu as Krishna killing his own evil maternal uncle Kamsa in Mathura.

====The sanctuary====
The sanctuary is entered from the east by a doorway only 1.08 m in height: inside is an entrance chamber (or &quot;mandapa&quot;) with a corbelled brick roof, then a short corridor leading to three towers to the west: the central tower is the tallest, at 9.8 m. Glaize notes the impression of delicacy given the towers by the antefixes on each of their tiers. The six stairways leading up to the platform were each guarded by two kneeling statues of human figures with animal heads; most of those now in place are replicas, the originals having been stolen or removed to museums.

<text>The Mercedes-Benz 600 (W100) is a line of ultra-luxury cars produced by Daimler-Benz from 1963 to 1981. The forerunner of the modern Maybach marque, the &quot;Grosser Mercedes&quot; (&quot;Grand Mercedes&quot;) succeeded the Type 300d &quot;Adenauer&quot; (W189) as the company&#x27;s flagship model. It was positioned above the subsequent 300-series (W112) in price, amenities, and status. In 1963 the Mercedes-Benz 600 was the most expensive car in the world. Its few competitors included British and American equivalents such as Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Lincoln Continental, Cadillac Series 75, and Chrysler Imperial. It was well known for its ownership among celebrities and political leaders and royalty throughout the late 20th century. Many experts and enthusiasts consider it to be the greatest luxury vehicle ever made. Even today owning a Mercedes-Benz 600 can be very expensive and extremely costly to maintain, they can cost as much as 3.5 million dollars.

Generally, the short-wheelbase (SWB) models were designed to be owner-driven, whereas the long-wheelbase (LWB) and limousine models, often incorporating a central divider with power window, were intended for chauffeur operation.

&quot;Living legend: the Mercedes-Benz 600 is nothing but grand. With its groundbreaking engineering, this iconic vehicle has been defining automotive luxury since its first appearance in 1963.&quot; - Mercedes Benz

== History ==
The 600 replaced the Mercedes-Benz W189 300d limousine, the final version of the W186 and W189 model 300-series company flagship produced between the early 1950s and early 1960s. It received the nickname &quot;Adenauer&quot; after Konrad Adenauer, the first Chancellor of West Germany, who employed several of these automobiles during his tenure in office.

Production began in 1964 and continued through to 1981. During this time, production totalled 2,677 units, comprising 2,190 Saloons, 304 Pullmans, 124 6-door Pullmans and 59 Landaulets.

The 600 succeeded the 1961 Mercedes-Benz W112 in using a pneumatic self-levelling suspension, an enhancement of the Mercedes-Benz 300d &quot;Adenauer&#x27;s&quot; dashboard activated mechanical torsion bar based system. A version is incorporated in Mercedes&#x27; current Active Body Control.

With its demise in 1981, the 600 marked the last ultra-luxury model that the brand produced in an unbroken line since the model 60 hp Simplex from 1903. The company would return to this segment some 20 years later with the Maybach 57/62, but these extremely expensive cars failed to sell in expected and necessary numbers. As a result, Daimler ended production of the Maybach brand in 2012 and has not returned to this segment. 

, the Mercedes flagship is the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class, which occupies a considerably lower price bracket and is not a true successor to the 600 and earlier models. However, it is seen as a spiritual successor, since it is the first luxury Mercedes-Benz production model since the 600 to feature some bespoke design touches not available on the standard S-Class.

==Models==

The 600 came in two main variants:
* A short wheelbase 4-door saloon, available with a power divider window separating the front seats from the rear bench seat, although most were built without this feature.
* A long wheelbase 4-door &quot;Pullman&quot; limousine (with two additional rear-facing seats separated from the driver compartment by a power divider window, of which 304 were built), and a 6-door limousine (with two forward-facing jump-seats at the middle two doors and a rear bench-seat).

A number of the limousines were made as landaulets, with a convertible top over the rear passenger compartment. Two versions of the convertible roof were made: long roof and short roof. Of them, the short roof, which opens only above the last, third row of seats, is the more common version. Rarer, especially with the 6-door landaulets, is the long roof, called the &quot;Presidential roof&quot;. In all, 59 landaulets were produced, and of them, only 26 were 6-door landaulets. Of these 26, only nine were 6-doors landaulets with the long Presidential-type roof. One of these nine cars was used by the former Yugoslavian president Josip Broz Tito, and it was sold in 2017 in England, for £2.5 million.

Landaulets like these were also notably used by the German government, as during the 1965 state visit of Queen Elizabeth II. The Vatican, in addition to an elongated Mercedes 300d 4-door landaulet, used for the Pope a specially designed Mercedes 600 4-door landaulet, which now resides at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart. Production of the landaulet versions of the 600 ended in 1980.

Mercedes also made two special 600 coupés: one as a gift for retiring long-time Mercedes chief designer Rudolf Uhlenhaut, and the other for Fritz Nallinger, head of the Mercedes research and development centre in the 1950s and 60s. These cars had a wheelbase 22 cm (8.6 inches) shorter than the SWB saloon. A single example of a SWB 4-door landaulet, combining the handling of a short-wheelbase with the qualities of a landaulet, was built by Mercedes in 1967 for former racing driver Philipp Constantin von Berckheim.

==Mechanical==

The 600&#x27;s great size, weight, and numerous hydraulically driven amenities required more power than Mercedes&#x27; largest engine at that time, the 3-litre 6-cylinder M189, could produce. A new V8 with more than twice the capacity was developed, the M100. It featured single overhead camshafts (SOHC) and a Bosch-made intermittent multi point manifold injection, and developed .

The 600&#x27;s complex hydraulic pressure system powered the automobile&#x27;s windows, seats, sun-roof, boot lid, and automatically closing doors. Adjustable air suspension delivered excellent ride quality and sure handling over any road surface.

<text>The Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) was the interim legislature of Hong Kong that operated from 1997 to 1998. The legislature was founded in Guangzhou and sat in Shenzhen from 1996 (with offices in Hong Kong), until the 1997 handover when it moved to Hong Kong to temporarily replace the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. 

The legislature was established by the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by resolution at its Second Plenary Session on 24 March 1996. The 60 members of the PLC were elected on 21 December 1996 by the 400-member Selection Committee for the First Government of the HKSAR, which also elected the first Chief Executive. The official start date for this council was on 25 January 1997.

==History==
=== 1992 electoral reforms ===
When the Hong Kong Basic Law was promulgated on 4 April 1990, the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) issued a decision on the same day on the formation of the first government and legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The decision and the Basic Law envisioned the Legislative Council returned from the 1995 Hong Kong legislative election to continue operating until 1998, when the next legislative election would be due.

The NPC decided that the first legislature was to be formed according to &quot;principles of State sovereignty and smooth transition&quot;. More specifically, the first legislature was to have 60 members, 20 of which returned from direct geographical constituency elections, 30 members from functional constituencies and 10 members returned by an election committee. If the composition of the last colonial Legislative Council conforms to the NPC decision and the Basic Law, its members automatically become members of the first post-handover Legislative Council, provided that they uphold the Basic Law, plead allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and meet the requirements of the Basic Law.

The automatic transition (or the &quot;through-train&quot; model) was abandoned on 31 August 1994, when the NPC decided the 1995 Legislative Council would end with British sovereignty over Hong Kong. The policy changed when the Hong Kong government decided the 1995 legislature would be formed with a new electoral formula from the 1994 electoral reform announced by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten in October 1992. Although the new formula expanded Hong Kong&#x27;s electoral base, it conformed with the seat composition described in the NPC decision by only allowing 33 percent of seats to be elected through universal suffrage. This was possible only because decision did not define the election committee and the functional constituency electorate.

The electoral reform created nine functional constituencies that gave paid labourers voting rights and abolished voting by corporations, which could vote in the old functional constituencies. As a result, the number of voters in the functional constituencies increased to about 2.7 million from 104,609. The reform also defined the election committee to consist of district board members, who were themselves elected by universal suffrage.

China did not recognise the Legislative Council returned after the electoral reform. It stated the new composition violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law and the NPC decision made in 1990. It also stated the reforms were introduced unilaterally, and China was not consulted on the change in seat composition.

Negotiations between the British and Chinese governments on the legislative transition began in April 1993, but ended in November 1993 without a consensus. On 2 July 1993, the NPC Standing Committee (NPCSC) formed the Preliminary Working Committee, an organisation that prepared for the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 1996. According to legal scholar Albert Chen, the PLC was an idea of the Preliminary Working Committee.

=== Establishment ===
On 26 January 1996, the Preparatory Committee was formed in accordance with the 1990 NPC decision. At its second plenary session on 24 March 1996, the Preparatory Committee established the PLC. The PLC&#x27;s composition was consistent with the 1990 NPC decision, but all members were to be chosen by the Selection Committee. By the end of 1996, all 60 members of the PLC had been chosen by the selection committee controlled by China. The Democratic Party boycotted the PLC and criticised it for being undemocratic, while politicians Tsang Yok-sing, Elsie Tu, Dominic Chan and Peggy Lam gained a seat.

The Provisional Legislative Council convened its first meeting on 25 January 1997 at the Shenzhen Guesthouse Hotel in Shenzhen. At the meeting, it elected its first president, Rita Fan. From 1 July 1997 to 1998, it sat at the then Legislative Council Building in Hong Kong.

Council committees and the LegCo Secretariat sat at various locations, including:
* Huaxia Art Centre – 1 Guanqiao Street in the Overseas Chinese Town in Nanshan District, Shenzhen from 22 February to 21 June 1997
* Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre Extension – 1 July 1997

The Council held 60 meetings, 17 motions and passed 13 bills introduced by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong. The Legco Secretariat offices were on the 3rd Floor of the Huaxia Art Centre.

==Organisation==
===President of the Provisional Legislative Council===

The president of the PLC was Rita Fan, who later led the legislative council following the handover.

===Members===
===Officers of the Provisional Legislative Council===
The only officer found in the records was for the Clerk, Pauline Ng Man-Wah. Immediately after the Provisional Legislative Council was disbanded, she became the clerk of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. She retired from this position on 28 August 2012.

=== Standing committees ===

* Finance Committee
* Public Accounts Committee
* Committee of Members&#x27; Interest

== Legislative functions ==
The legislative functions of the PLC are described by the Preparatory Committee in 1996.

== Proceedings ==
=== Meeting broadcast ===
Sessions of the PLC were broadcast with assistance from the Shenzhen Television Station.

== Legal status ==
The PLC is neither referred to in the Basic Law nor the Joint Declaration as their drafters assumed the last colonial legislative session would automatically become the Special Administrative Region&#x27;s first legislature. The legality of the PLC was challenged in the case &quot;HKSAR v Ma Wai Kwan&quot; decided by the Court of Appeal on 29 July 1997. The defendants argued that the PLC was unlawful because it did not satisfy the Basic Law&#x27;s definition of Hong Kong&#x27;s legislature in Annex II. The court dismissed the argument. Among other reasons, the court held that as a local court it had no power to review an act of a sovereign authority. The court reasoned that since Article 19 of the Basic Law did not expand its judicial powers and that it had no power to review the validity of a sovereign act under colonial rule, it did not hold such power after the handover. While Justice Gerald Nazareth agreed with the majority decision, he questioned whether the constitutional structure of China and that of the United Kingdom were analogous. He also noted there was no &quot;detailed review&quot; of the Chinese constitution during the trial. The decision in &quot;Ma Wai Kwan&quot; was upheld by the Court of Final Appeal in &quot;Ng Ka Ling v Director of Immigration&quot; decided in January 1999.

Johannes Chan commented that the lack of judicial review power to review acts of Parliament reflected parliamentary supremacy, a doctrine borne out of unwritten constitutional systems. Since China has a written constitution and that the Basic Law describes the relationship between Hong Kong and the central government unlike the colonial Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions, Chan questioned whether parliamentary supremacy still fully applies in Hong Kong after 1997.

<text>Oscarshall Palace is a &quot;maison de plaisance&quot; located in the small fjord Frognerkilen on Bygdøy in Oslo, Norway.

== History ==
The palace was built from 1847 to 1852 by the Danish architect Johan Henrik Nebelong on commission from King Oscar I and Queen Joséphine of Norway and Sweden. In 1881, King Oscar II opened the palace to the public as a museum.

The palace, with its secondary buildings and surrounding park, is considered to be one of the finest examples of neo-Gothic architecture in Norway and is one of the country&#x27;s most important embodiments of the National Romantic style which was popular in Norway during the period.

The interior was wholly constructed and decorated by Norwegian artists and artisans. The walls of the dining hall are decorated with paintings by Joachim Frich, Adolph Tidemand, and Hans Gude while the decoration and furniture in the drawing room evokes the style of the old Norwegian guildhall.

Oscarshall was sold by King Carl IV to the Norwegian state in 1863. The palace was almost given a new role when it was decided in 1929 that Oscarshall would become the new residence of Crown Prince Olav and Princess Märtha. These plans were never realized, however, as both financial problems and political opposition arose. The situation was later solved when Fritz Wedel Jarlsberg sold his estate Skaugum to the royal couple. Today it is the property of the state and is placed at the disposal of the King.

== Open to the public ==
Between 2005 and 2009 Oscarshall underwent a total renovation and restoration, bringing colours and furniture back to its original style from 1859. The renovation completed, Oscarshall was once again open to the public.

The palace is now open for guided tours during the summer season. In 2013, Queen Sonja opened the Queen Joséphine Gallery on the grounds of Oscarshall. The gallery exhibits graphic prints and featured prints by Her Majesty herself during its first season.

<doc id="501808" wikidata="Q615302" url="?curid=501808" title="Pistol slide">
<text>The slide on the majority of fully/semi-automatic pistols is the upper part that reciprocates (&quot;slides&quot;) with recoil during the gun&#x27;s operating cycle. It serves as the bolt carrier group (BCG) and partly as the receiver, and generally houses the firing pin/striker, the extractor and frequently also the barrel, and provides a mounting platform for iron and optical sights.

Through the principles of short recoil or simple blowback operations, the slide is moved backwards with each shot by the energy of expanding gasses caused by the combusting propellant (often a nitrocellulose-based smokeless powder, very rarely black powder). Because the slide is spring-loaded, once at the rearmost position, the spring tension will push it back towards the front. Generally, this slide movement cycle serves three functions: the extractor will empty the chamber by pulling out the spent casing from the previous shot (which then gets removed out of the gun by the ejector), the slide inertia will cock the hammer/striker to prepare for the next shot, and the bolt will push a new cartridge from the magazine into the chamber when the slide comes back forward. This action cycle will be repeated for continued firing as long as the magazine contains rounds and there is no failure to extract/eject (which causes stovepiping and double-feeding), failure to feed, or out-of-battery malfunction.

Fully/semi-automatic air pistols&#x27; slides operate with similar principles as firearms, except they utilize pneumatic energy from compressed gas (usually air, , propane or refrigerants) instead of burning propellants. Because air pistols typically have much lower muzzle energy than firearms, there is less recoil that can be used to operate the slide. However, because airgun pellets/shots have no casings that needed to be extracted (unlike firearm cartridges), a very brief slide movement is sufficient to cycle the action and load the subsequent shot, so only a small amount of energy is needed to move the slide.

On most modern designs, once the magazine is empty, a slide stop will catch and lock the slide at its rearmost position, and will only be released to move back forward after the slide release is depressed.

Having the slide automatically loading the chamber and cocking the hammer/striker with each prior shot is essential for the function of double-action/single-action pistols. Hammerless and striker-fired pistols, lacking an external hammer that can be directly manipulated, need to have the whole slide manually pulled back to cock the hammer/striker if the gun is not already cocked for firing.

<doc id="501814" wikidata="Q2512993" url="?curid=501814" title="Whit Monday">
<text>Whit Monday or Pentecost Monday, also known as Monday of the Holy Spirit, is the holiday celebrated the day after Pentecost, a moveable feast in the Christian liturgical calendar. It is moveable because it is determined by the date of Easter. In the Catholic Church, it is the Memorial of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of the Church, marking the resumption of Ordinary Time.

Whit Monday gets its English name from &quot;Whitsunday&quot;, an English name for Pentecost, one of the three baptismal seasons. The origin of the name &quot;Whit Sunday&quot; is generally attributed to the white garments formerly worn by those newly baptized on this feast.

==Observance==

Pentecost is always on a Sunday and is therefore usually a non-working day. That said, the Monday after Pentecost is a public holiday in Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Austria, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Benin, The British Virgin Islands, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, Cyprus, Denmark, Dominica, France, Gabon, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Hungary, Iceland, Ivory Coast, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Monaco, Montserrat, The Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Saint Lucia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Solomon Islands, Switzerland, Togo and Ukraine. In many of these countries, Whit Monday is known as &quot;the second day of Pentecost&quot; or &quot;the second Whitsun&quot;.

In France, it became a work day for many workers from 2005 to 2007. This was to raise extra funds following the government&#x27;s lack of preparation for a summertime heat wave, which led to a shortage of proper health care for the elderly. It continues to be a &quot;worked public holiday&quot; in France. In Liechtenstein, Whit Monday is considered to be a &quot;favorite holiday&quot;, much like Christmas in many other countries. In Germany, Whit Monday ( ) is a Holy Day of obligation for Roman Catholics. It is celebrated in South Tyrol, and for its capital city Bolzano it replaces the holiday of the local patron saint celebrated elsewhere in Italy.

Until 1973, Whit Monday was a public holiday in Ireland (also called a bank holiday). It was a bank holiday in the United Kingdom until 1967. There it was formally replaced by the fixed Spring Bank Holiday on the last Monday in May in 1971. It was also a public holiday in various former British colonies, especially in the Pacific. It remains a public holiday in some of the countries of the Commonwealth Caribbean. In Sweden, Whit Monday was a public holiday until 2004; it was replaced by the National Day of Sweden in 2005.

Although Whit Monday is a civil holiday in many countries, it was not a Catholic religious holiday any more than the other weekdays that follow Pentecost Sunday. Until the 1969 revision of the General Roman Calendar, they were part of the octave of Pentecost, which was added in the 7th century. The Monday after Pentecost is now the first day of the resumption of Ordinary Time. While the details differ from diocese to diocese, the most widespread practice in Germany (where the holiday remains an obligation) was to have a compulsory votive Mass of the Holy Spirit outranking even solemnities (these would be local solemnities in that case).

However, in February 2018, Pope Francis declared that henceforth, Whit Monday will be the fixed date for the celebration of a new feast, officially known as the &quot;Memorial of Mary, Mother of the Church&quot; to be celebrated throughout the Western Catholic Church, with the exception of the Ordinariates, where the octave of Whitsun Week has been restored and the new Memorial is observed on the Saturday after Ascension Day.

===Observance in Eastern Orthodoxy and the Eastern Catholic Churches===
In the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches Whit Monday is known as &quot;Monday of the Holy Spirit&quot; or &quot;Day of the Holy Spirit&quot; and is the first day of the afterfeast of Pentecost, being dedicated specifically to the honor of God the Holy Spirit and particularly in commemoration of his descent upon the apostles at Pentecost. The day following is known as Third Day of the Trinity. In the services on the Monday of the Holy Spirit many of the same hymns are sung as on the day of Pentecost itself. During the Divine Liturgy the Deacon intones the same introit as on the day of Pentecost, and the dismissal is the same as on the day of Pentecost. Special canons to the Holy Spirit are chanted at Compline and Matins.

<text>Jonathan George Snow  (born 28 September 1947) is an English journalist and television presenter. He is best known as the longest-running presenter of &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;, which he presented from 1989 to 2021. On 29 April 2021, Snow announced his retirement from the role; his final programme aired on 23 December 2021. Although Channel 4&#x27;s news programming is produced by ITN, Snow was employed directly by the broadcaster.

Snow has held numerous honorary appointments, including Chancellor of Oxford Brookes University from 2001 to 2008.

==Early life and education==
Snow was born in Ardingly, Sussex, the son of George D&#x27;Oyly Snow, Bishop of Whitby, and Joan, a pianist who studied at the Royal College of Music. He is a grandson of First World War General Sir Thomas D&#x27;Oyly Snow (about whom he writes in his foreword to Ronald Skirth&#x27;s war memoir &quot;The Reluctant Tommy&quot;) and is the cousin of retired BBC television news presenter Peter Snow. He grew up at Ardingly College, where his father was headmaster. In 2013, he recounted how the inquiry into Sir Jimmy Savile had allowed him to re-evaluate his own childhood, having been molested by one of the college&#x27;s domestic staff when he was aged six.

Snow won a choral scholarship to Winchester Cathedral and spent five years at the Pilgrims&#x27; School. He subsequently attended St Edward&#x27;s School in Oxford. When he was 18, he spent a year as a VSO volunteer teaching in Uganda.

After mixed success in his first attempt to pass his A-level qualifications, he moved to the Yorkshire Coast College, Scarborough, where he later obtained the necessary qualifications to gain a place reading Law at the University of Liverpool. However, he did not complete his undergraduate studies, being expelled for his part in a 1970 anti-apartheid socialist student protest, which he later described as &quot;an absolute watershed in my life&quot;.

==Career==
After his law degree studies were terminated at Liverpool University, Snow was hired by Lord Longford to direct the New Horizon Youth Centre, a day centre for homeless young people in central London, an organisation with which he has remained involved and of which he subsequently became chairman.

In 1973 he became a presenter on LBC Radio, a then new commercial radio station.

By 1978, he was working as a correspondent for ITN, and in November of that year was sent on a mission to Vietnam to report on the plight of the boat people. He served as ITN&#x27;s Washington correspondent (1983–1986) and as diplomatic editor (1986–1989) before becoming the main presenter of Channel 4 News in 1989. In 1992, he was the main anchor for ITN&#x27;s election night programme, broadcast on ITV; he presented the programme alongside Robin Day, Alastair Stewart and Julia Somerville. (Previously ITN&#x27;s programme had typically been presented by Alastair Burnet, who left ITN in 1991. The 1992 election night programme was the only one hosted by Snow. He was replaced by Jonathan Dimbleby from 1997 onwards.) Snow has won several RTS Awards – two for reports from El Salvador, one for his reporting of the Kegworth air disaster as well as the 1995 Award for Best Male Presenter and the 1980 Award for TV Journalist of the Year for his coverage of Afghanistan, Iran and the Middle East.

Snow is known for sporting his vast collection of colourful ties and socks.

While working as a journalist in Uganda, he flew alongside President Idi Amin in the presidential jet, and Snow has recounted how while Amin appeared to be asleep he thought seriously about taking Amin&#x27;s revolver and shooting him dead, but was worried about the consequences of firing a loose round in a jet.

In 1976, Snow reportedly rejected an approach by British intelligence services to spy on his colleagues. At first he was asked to supply information about the Communist Party, but he was then asked to spy on certain &quot;left-wing people&quot; working in television. In return he would have received secret monthly, tax-free payments, matching his then salary.

In 1980, in the early stages of the Iran–Iraq War, he helped rescue a British ship that had become trapped in Iranian waters.

In 2002 he returned to radio, presenting &quot;Jon Snow Reports&quot; on Oneword Radio, a weekly show and podcast. He wrote regular articles for the Channel 4 News website and &quot;Snowmail&quot; – a daily email newsletter on the big stories coming up on the evening edition of Channel 4 News.

In 2003, at the height of the dodgy dossier affair, Alastair Campbell walked into the studio to rebut statements by the BBC. Without notes or preparation, Snow attempted to question Campbell about the affair.

In 2004, Snow published an autobiography, &quot;Shooting History&quot;. The book was published by Harper Perennial and detailed Snow&#x27;s life from his childhood up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Snow refuses to wear any symbol that may represent his views on air; in the run up to Remembrance Day, he condemned what he called &quot;poppy fascism&quot; because &quot;in the end there really must be more important things in life than whether a news presenter wears symbols on his lapels&quot;.
On 28 February 2008, Snow said that the silence of the British media on the decision to allow Prince Harry to fight in Afghanistan was unacceptable: &quot;I never thought I&#x27;d find myself saying thank God for Drudge. The infamous US blogger has broken the best kept editorial secret of recent times. Editors have been sworn to secrecy over Prince Harry being sent to fight in Afghanistan three months ago.&quot; These remarks provoked criticism from some viewers and media outlets.

On 9 February 2009, Snow interviewed Lt-Col Yvonne Bradley, the military counsel for Binyam Mohamed, a British resident detained for five years at Guantánamo Bay. Snow asked whether Mohamed&#x27;s allegations of torture were justified; Bradley said there was no doubt at all that he had been tortured. Mohamed was released and returned to Britain on 23 February 2009.

In November 2010 Snow was sent to Haiti to report on the cholera outbreak.

On 14 June 2011, Snow presented the multiple award-winning investigation documentary &quot;Sri Lanka&#x27;s Killing Fields&quot;, directed by Callum Macrae, which documented war crimes committed in the final days of the Sri Lankan conflict in 2009. The second part, &quot;Sri Lanka&#x27;s Killing Fields: War Crimes Unpunished&quot; was broadcast in March 2012.

In early 2014, Snow had a debate with comedian and actor Russell Brand who appeared in a Channel 4 interview about his petition for a debate on British drug laws.

===Accusations of bias===
In June 2017, it was reported that Snow had shouted &quot;fuck the Tories&quot; at Glastonbury. He was criticised for his views on air by a guest on Channel 4 News, Conservative minister Grant Shapps later refused to appear on the show, doubting its neutrality. Shapps stated: &quot;I don’t think he [Jon Snow] can deal in an even handed manner in any interview with a Conservative MP. He has lost all credibility.&quot; MP Andrew Bridgen called for Snow&#x27;s resignation, arguing that Snow&#x27;s &quot;extreme views&quot; were incompatible with an impartial interviewer. Rival presenter for the BBC, Andrew Marr, commented that if he had made similar comments, he would have lost his job. Channel 4 released a statement saying that Snow had been “spoken to and reminded of his responsibilities around due impartiality”.

In March 2019, while reporting at a pro-Brexit protest, Snow said that he had &quot;never seen so many white people in one place&quot;. Media regulator Ofcom received 2,644 complaints about Snow&#x27;s comment; viewers &quot;considered the comment unnecessary&quot;. A Channel 4 spokeswoman released a statement stating that it was &quot;an unscripted observation&quot; and that the broadcaster regretted any offence caused. Ofcom investigated whether the comment &quot;broke our rules on offensive content&quot;, and ruled in August to clear him over the remarks.

== Other ventures ==
Following his retirement from ITN as the news anchor for Channel 4 in 2021, Snow continued his long association with the state-owned broadcaster by travelling to Greece, Japan and California to research and present his two-part documentary on &quot;How to Live to 100,&quot; broadcast during January 2023. The programme sought to reveal to viewers the secrets of a long, happy and healthy life by examining the lifestyles of the residents of three continents who were approaching 100 years of age.

==Awards and honours==
Snow declined an OBE because he believes working journalists should not take honours from those about whom they report.

In May 2015, Snow accepted a BAFTA Fellowship at the 2015 BAFTA Awards Ceremony.

Snow was also awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by the University of Liverpool in 2011,
by Sussex University in 2015 and by Keele University in 2018. He has an honorary degree from the University of Aberdeen.

Snow is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects.

==Personal life==
Snow was once engaged to fellow television newsreader Anna Ford. For 35 years Snow&#x27;s partner was human rights lawyer Madeleine Colvin, with whom he has two daughters. In March 2010, Snow married Precious Lunga, a scientist who was born and raised in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). They had a child together by surrogacy in March 2021. Snow lives in Primrose Hill, north London.

Known as a keen cyclist and advocate of the activity, Snow served as president of CTC Cycling UK from 2007 onwards, to around 2020. When his beloved Condor, titanium-framed silver hybrid cycle was stolen from his home, he publicised the theft on his blog and offered £250 reward for its safe return.

Snow served as a governor at Brecknock Primary School, Camden, for many years.

He is the cousin of the equally renowned journalist and broadcaster Peter Snow.

<text>The Coat Protein Complex II, or COPII, is a group of proteins that facilitate the formation of vesicles to transport proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus or endoplasmic-reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartment. This process is termed anterograde transport, in contrast to the retrograde transport associated with the COPI complex. COPII is assembled in two parts: first an inner layer of Sar1, Sec23, and Sec24 forms; then the inner coat is surrounded by an outer lattice of Sec13 and Sec31.

The COPII coat is responsible for the formation of vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These vesicles transport cargo proteins to the Golgi apparatus (in yeast) or the endoplasmic-reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC, in mammals).

Coat assembly is initiated when the cytosolic Ras GTPase Sar1 is activated by its guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sec12. Activated Sar1-GTP inserts itself into the ER membrane, binding preferentially to areas of membrane curvature. As Sar1-GTP inserts into the membrane, it recruits Sec23 and Sec24 to make up the inner cage. Once the inner coat is assembled, the outer coat proteins Sec13 and Sec31 are recruited to the budding vesicle. Hydrolysis of the Sar1 GTP to GDP promotes disassembly of the coat.

Some proteins are found to be responsible for selectively packaging cargos into COPII vesicles. More recent research suggests the Sec23/Sec24-Sar1 complex participates in cargo selection. For example, Erv29p in &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; is found to be necessary for packaging glycosylated pro-α-factor.

Sec24 proteins recognize various cargo proteins, packaging them into the budding vesicles.

==Structure==

The COPII coat consists of an inner layer – a flexible meshwork of Sar1, Sec23, and Sec24 – and an outer layer made of Sec13 and Sec31. Sar1 resembles other Ras-family GTPases, with a core of six beta strands flanked by three alpha helices, and two flexible &quot;switch domains&quot;. Unlike other Ras GTPases, Sar1 inserts into membranes via an N-terminal helix (rather than myristoylation or prenylation).

These coat proteins are necessary but insufficient to direct or dock the vesicle to the correct target membrane. SNARE, cargo, and other proteins are also needed for these processes to occur.

Pre-budding complex (composed of Sar1-GTP and Sec23/24) recruits the flexible Sec13p/31p complex, characterized by polymerization of the Sec13/31 complex with other Sec13/31 complexes to form a cuboctahedron with a broader lattice than its Clathrin vesicle analog. The formation of the cuboctahedron deforms the ER membrane and detaches the COPII vesicle (alongside cargo proteins and v-SNAREs), completing the COPII vesicle budding process.

==Regulation==
The signal(s) that triggers Sec12 to initiate COPII assembly remains unclear, though some regulators of coat formation are now known. The frequency of COPII formation is regulated in part by Sec16A and Tango1 proteins, likely by concentrating Sec12 in a given location, so it can more efficiently activate Sar1.

==Evolution==
In mammals there are two Sar1 genes: &quot;SAR1A&quot; and &quot;SAR1B&quot; (&quot;SAR1B&quot; was previously known as &quot;SARA2&quot;). In cultured mammalian cells the two Sar1 genes appear redundant; however, in animals SAR1B is uniquely required for the formation of large (over 1 micrometer across) COPII-coated vesicles.

Similarly, mammals express two Sec23 genes: &quot;SEC23A&quot; and &quot;SEC23B&quot;. The two Sec23 isoforms have identical function but are expressed in different body tissues. Both Sec23 proteins can interact with any of the four Sec24 proteins: SEC24A, SEC24B, SEC24C, and SEC24D.

==Role in disease==
Lethal or pathogenic variants of most COPII proteins have been described. Loss of Sar1B in mice results in death soon after birth. In humans, inheriting two copies of certain SAR1B variants results in Chylomicron retention disease, and loss of Sar1B causes a combination of chylomicron retention disease and the neuromuscular disorder Marinesco–Sjögren syndrome.

Loss of Sec23A is lethal to mice &quot;in utero&quot;. In humans, a Sec23A variant causes Cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia, while Sec23B variants are associated with the bone marrow disease congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II and some cancers. Mice without Sec23B die soon after birth. Halperin-Birk syndrome (HLBKS), a rare autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder, is caused by a null mutation in the SEC31A.

==Conformational changes==
CopII has three specific binding sites that can each be complexed. The adjacent picture (Sed5) uses the Sec22 t-SNARE complex to bind. This site is more strongly bound, and therefore is more favored. (Embo)

==Research==
Mutations the threonine at position 39 to asparagine generates a dominant negative Sar1A bound permanently to GDP; mutating histidine 79 to glycine generates a constitutively active Sar1A, with GTP hydrolysis slowed dramatically.

<text>COPI is a coatomer, a protein complex that coats vesicles transporting proteins from the &quot;cis&quot; end of the Golgi complex back to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they were originally synthesized, and between Golgi compartments. This type of transport is &quot;retrograde transport&quot;, in contrast to the &quot;anterograde transport&quot; associated with the COPII protein. The name &quot;COPI&quot; refers to the specific coat protein complex that initiates the budding process on the &quot;cis&quot;-Golgi membrane. The coat consists of large protein subcomplexes that are made of seven different protein subunits, namely α, β, β&#x27;, γ, δ, ε and ζ.

==Coat proteins==
Coat protein, or COPI, is an ADP ribosylation factor (ARF)-dependent protein involved in membrane traffic. COPI was first identified in retrograde traffic from the &quot;cis&quot;-Golgi to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is the most extensively studied of ARF-dependent adaptors. COPI consists of seven subunits which compose the heteroheptameric protein complex.

The primary function of adaptors is the selection of cargo proteins for their incorporation into nascent carriers. Cargo containing the sorting motifs KKXX and KXKXX interact with COPI to form carriers which are transported from the cis-Golgi to the ER. Current views suggest that ARFs are also involved in the selection of cargo for incorporation into carriers.

==Budding process==
ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) is a GTPase involved in membrane traffic. There are 6 mammalian ARFs which are regulated by over 30 guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). ARF is post-translationally modified at the N-terminus by the addition of the fatty acid myristate.

ARF cycles between GTP and GDP-bound conformations. In the GTP-bound form, ARF conformation changes such that the myristate and hydrophobic N-terminal become more exposed and associate with the membrane. The interconversion between GTP and GDP bound states is mediated by ARF GEFs and ARF GAPs. At the membrane, ARF-GTP is hydrolyzed to ARF-GDP by ARF GAPs. Once in the GDP-bound conformation, ARF converts to a less hydrophobic conformation and dissociates from the membrane. Soluble ARF-GDP is converted back to ARF-GTP by GEFs.

# Luminal proteins: Proteins found in the lumen of the Golgi complex that need to be transported to the lumen of the ER contain the signal peptide KDEL. This sequence is recognized by a membrane-bound KDEL receptor. In yeast, this is ERD2P and in mammals it is KDELR. This receptor then binds to an ARF-GEF, a class of guanine nucleotide exchange factors. This protein in turn binds to the ARF. This interaction causes ARF to exchange its bound GDP for GTP. Once this exchange is made ARF binds to the cytosolic side of the cis-Golgi membrane and inserts the myristoylated N-terminal amphipathic alpha-helix into the membrane.
# Membrane proteins: Transmembrane proteins which reside in the ER contain sorting signals in their cytosolic tails which direct the protein to exit the Golgi and return to the ER. These sorting signals, or motifs, typically contain the amino acid sequence KKXX or KXKXX, which interact with COPI subunits α-COP and β&#x27;-COP. The order in which adaptor proteins associate with cargo, or adaptor proteins associate with ARFs is unclear, however, in order to form a mature transport carrier coat protein, adaptor, cargo, and ARF must all associate.

Membrane deformation and carrier budding occurs following the collection of interactions described above. The carrier then buds off of the donor membrane, in the case of COPI this membrane is the cis-Golgi, and the carrier moves to the ER where it fuses with the acceptor membrane and its content is expelled.

== Structure ==

On the surface of a vesicle COPI molecules form symmetric trimers (&quot;triads&quot;). The curved triad structure positions the Arf1 molecules and cargo binding sites proximal to the membrane. The β′- and α-COP subunits form an arch over the γζβδ-COP subcomplex, orienting their N-terminal domains such that the K(X)KXX cargo-motif binding sites are optimally positioned against the membrane. Thus β′- and α-COP do not form a cage or lattice as in COPII and clathrin coats as previously suggested; instead, they are linked to one another via the γζβδ-COP subcomplexes, forming an interconnected assembly. The triads are linked together with contacts of variable valence making up four different types of contacts.

<text>The equals sign (British English) or equal sign (American English), also known as the equality sign, is the mathematical symbol , which is used to indicate equality. In an equation, it is placed between two expressions that have the same value, or for which one studies the conditions under which they have the same value.

In Unicode and ASCII, it has the code point U+003D. It was invented in 1557 by Robert Recorde.

==History==

Before the 16th century, there was no common symbol for equality, and equality was usually expressed with a word, such as &quot;aequales, aequantur, esgale, faciunt, ghelijck,&quot; or &quot;gleich,&quot; and sometimes by the abbreviated form &quot;aeq&quot;, or simply and . Diophantus&#x27;s use of , short for ( &#x27;equals&#x27;), in &quot;Arithmetica&quot; () is considered one of the first uses of an equals sign.

The symbol, now universally accepted in mathematics for equality, was first recorded by Welsh mathematician Robert Recorde in &quot;The Whetstone of Witte&quot; (1557). The original form of the symbol was much wider than the present form. In his book Recorde explains his design of the &quot;Gemowe lines&quot; (meaning &quot;twin&quot; lines, from the Latin )

The symbol was not immediately popular. After its introduction by Recorde, it wasn&#x27;t used again in print until 1618 (61 years later), in an anonymous Appendix in Edward Wright&#x27;s English translation of &quot;Descriptio&quot;, by John Napier. It wasn&#x27;t until 1631 that it received more than general recognition in England, being adopted as the symbol for equality in three influential works, Thomas Harriot&#x27;s &quot;Artis analyticae praxis&quot;, William Oughtred&#x27;s &quot;Clavis mathematicae&quot;, and Richard Norwood&#x27;s &quot;Trigonometria&quot;. Later used by John Wallis, Isaac Barrow, and Isaac Newton, which helped it spread throughout the rest of Europe.

=== Competing symbols ===
There were several other competing symbols for equality, especially outside of England around the 16th and 17th centuries, and Recorde&#x27;s version made no significant influence in the European continent until 1650 or 1660. In 1559, the French Monk Johannes Buteo published his &quot;Logistica&quot; using the symbolformula_1 for equality. In In 1571 Wilhelm Xylander published an edition of Diophantus&#x27; &quot;Arithmetica&quot; in which two parallel vertical lines were used for equality. This version was adopted by several prominent writers, including Giovanni Glorioso, Cardinal Michelangelo Ricci, and many French and Dutch mathematicians in the hundred years after, including René Descartes in 1621. 

A major competitor to Recorde&#x27;s sign was Descartes&#x27; own symbol, introduced in his &quot;La Géométrie&quot; (1637). In fact, Descartes himself used the sign for equality in a letter in 1640. Descartes does not give any reason for introducing his new symbol, however Florian Cajori suggests it is because was also being used for a difference operation at the time. Due to the prominence of &quot;La Géométrie&quot;, by 1675, Descartes&#x27; symbol gained favor over Recorde&#x27;s in Europe, and the majority of writers of the seventeenth century on the continent either used Descartes&#x27; notation for equality or none at all. Around the turn of the 18th century, Recorde&#x27;s notation gained favor rapidly. The dominating trend in mathematics of the time was differential and integral calculus. The fact that both Newton and Leibniz used Recorde&#x27;s symbol led to its general adoption.

==Usage in mathematics and computer programming==
In mathematics, the equal sign can be used as a simple statement of fact in a specific case (&quot;), or to create definitions (&quot;), conditional statements (&quot;), or to express a universal equivalence (&quot;).

The first important computer programming language to use the equal sign was the original version of Fortran, FORTRAN I, designed in 1954 and implemented in 1957. In Fortran, serves as an assignment operator: sets the value of to 2. This somewhat resembles the use of in a mathematical definition, but with different semantics: the expression following is evaluated first, and may refer to a previous value of . For example, the assignment increases the value of by 2.

A rival programming-language usage was pioneered by the original version of ALGOL, which was designed in 1958 and implemented in 1960. ALGOL included a relational operator that tested for equality, allowing constructions like with essentially the same meaning of as the conditional usage in mathematics. The equal sign was reserved for this usage.

Both usages have remained common in different programming languages into the early 21st century. As well as Fortran, is used for assignment in such languages as C, Perl, Python, AWK, and their descendants. But is used for equality and not assignment in the Pascal family, Ada, Eiffel, APL, and other languages.

A few languages, such as BASIC and PL/I, have used the equal sign to mean both assignment and equality, distinguished by context. However, in most languages where has one of these meanings, a different character or, more often, a sequence of characters is used for the other meaning. Following ALGOL, most languages that use for equality use for assignment, although APL, with its special character set, uses a left-pointing arrow.

Fortran did not have an equality operator (it was only possible to compare an expression to zero, using the arithmetic IF statement) until FORTRANIV was released in 1962, since when it has used the four characters to test for equality. The language B introduced the use of with this meaning, which has been copied by its descendant C and most later languages where means assignment.

Some languages additionally feature the &quot;spaceship operator&quot;, or three-way comparison operator, , to determine whether one value is less than, equal to, or greater than another.

===Several equal signs===
In some programming languages, codice_1 and codice_2 are used to check equality, so codice_3 will return true.

In PHP, the triple equal sign, , denotes value and type equality, meaning that not only do the two expressions evaluate to equal values, but they are also of the same data type. For instance, the expression is true, but is not, because the number 0 is an integer value whereas false is a Boolean value.

JavaScript has the same semantics for , referred to as &quot;equality without type coercion&quot;. However, in JavaScript the behavior of cannot be described by any simple consistent rules. The expression is true, but is false, even though both sides of the act the same in Boolean context. For this reason it is sometimes recommended to avoid the operator in JavaScript in favor of .

In Ruby, equality under requires both operands to be of identical type, e.g. is false. The operator is flexible and may be defined arbitrarily for any given type. For example, a value of type is a range of integers, such as . is false, since the types are different (Range vs. Integer); however is true, since on values means &quot;inclusion in the range&quot;. Under these semantics, codice_2 is non-symmetric; e.g. codice_5 is false, since it is interpreted to mean codice_6 rather than codice_7.

==Other uses==
===Spelling===
====Tone letter====
The equals sign is also used as a grammatical tone letter in the orthographies of Budu in the Congo-Kinshasa, in Krumen, Mwan and Dan in the Ivory Coast. The Unicode character used for the tone letter () is different from the mathematical symbol (U+003D).

====Personal names====

A possibly unique case of the equals sign of European usage in a person&#x27;s name, specifically in a double-barreled name, was by pioneer aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont, as he is also known not only to have often used a double hyphen resembling an equal sign between his two surnames in place of a hyphen, but also seems to have personally preferred that practice, to display equal respect for his father&#x27;s French ethnicity and the Brazilian ethnicity of his mother.

Instead of a double hyphen, the equals sign is sometimes used in Japanese as a separator between names. In Ojibwe, the readily available equals sign on most keyboards is commonly used as a substitute for a double hyphen.

=== Linguistics ===
In linguistic interlinear glosses, an equal sign is conventionally used to mark clitic boundaries: the equals sign is placed between the clitic and the word that the clitic is attached to.

===Chemistry===
In chemical formulas, the two parallel lines denoting a double bond are commonly rendered using an equals sign (hence, a triple bond is commonly rendered using a triple bar).

===LGBT activism===

In recent years, the equal sign has been used to symbolize LGBT rights. The symbol has been used since 1995 by the Human Rights Campaign, which lobbies for marriage equality, and subsequently by the United Nations Free &amp; Equal, which promotes LGBT rights at the United Nations.

===Telegrams and Telex===
In Morse code, the equals sign is encoded by the letters B (-...) and T (-) run together (-...-). The letters BT stand for Break Text, and are put between paragraphs, or groups of paragraphs in messages sent via Telex, a standardised tele-typewriter. The sign, used to mean Break Text, is given at the end of a telegram to separate the text of the message from the signature.

==Related symbols==
===Approximately equal===
Symbols used to denote items that are &quot;approximately equal&quot; include the following:
* ≈ (, LaTeX &quot;\approx&quot;)
* ≃ (, LaTeX &quot;\simeq&quot;), a combination of and , also used to indicate asymptotic equality
* ≅ (, LaTeX &quot;\cong&quot;), another combination of ≈ and =, which is also sometimes used to indicate isomorphism or congruence
* (, LaTeX &quot;\sim&quot;), which is also sometimes used to indicate proportionality or similarity, being related by an equivalence relation, or to indicate that a random variable is distributed according to a specific probability distribution (see also tilde), or alternatively between two quantities to indicate they are of the same order of magnitude.
* ∽ (, LaTeX &quot;\backsim&quot;), which is also used to indicate proportionality
* ≐ (, LaTeX &quot;\doteq&quot;), which can also be used to represent the approach of a variable to a limit
* ≒ (, LaTeX &quot;\fallingdotseq&quot;), commonly used in Japan, Taiwan, and Korea.
* ≓ (, LaTeX &quot;\risingdotseq&quot;)

In some areas of East Asia such as Japan, &quot;≒&quot; is used to mean &quot;the two terms are almost equal&quot;, but in other areas and specialized literature such as mathematics, &quot;≃&quot; is often used. In addition to its mathematical meaning, it is sometimes used in Japanese sentences with the intention of &quot;almost the same&quot;.

===Not equal===
The symbol used to denote inequation (when items are not equal) is a slashed equal sign (U+2260). In LaTeX, this is done with the &quot;\neq&quot; command.

Most programming languages, limiting themselves to the 7-bit ASCII character set and typeable characters, use , , , or to represent their Boolean inequality operator.

===Identity===
The triple bar symbol (U+2261, LaTeX &quot;\equiv&quot;) is often used to indicate an identity, a definition (which can also be represented by or ), or a congruence relation in modular arithmetic. Also, in chemistry, the triple bar can be used to represent a triple bond between atoms.

===Isomorphism===
The symbol is often used to indicate isomorphic algebraic structures or congruent geometric figures.

===In logic===
Equality of truth values (through bi-implication or logical equivalence), may be denoted by various symbols including , , and .
===In geometry===
The symbol formula_2 (LaTeX \bumpeq) is used to show two directed line segments have the same length and direction, equipollence.

===Other related symbols ===
Additional precomposed symbols with code points in Unicode for notations related to the equal sign include the following:
* ≔ () (used to define a symbol or assign a variable)
* ≕ () (defines the symbol on the right-hand side)
* ≗ ()
* ≙ () (the left-hand side is an estimator for the right-hand side)
* ≛ ()
* ≜ () (used to define a symbol)
* ≟ ()
* ⩴ () (see also Backus–Naur form for )
* ⩶ ()

==Incorrect usage==
The equals sign is sometimes used incorrectly within a mathematical argument to connect math steps in a non-standard way, rather than to show equality (especially by early mathematics students).

For example, if one were finding the sum, step by step, of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, one might incorrectly write
:1 + 2 = 3 + 3 = 6 + 4 = 10 + 5 = 15.
Structurally, this is shorthand for
:([(1 + 2 = 3) + 3 = 6] + 4 = 10) + 5 = 15,
but the notation is incorrect, because each part of the equality has a different value. If interpreted strictly as it says, it would imply that
:3 = 6 = 10 = 15 = 15.
A correct version of the argument would be
:1 + 2 = 3, 3 + 3 = 6, 6 + 4 = 10, 10 + 5 = 15.

This difficulty results from subtly different uses of the sign in education. In early, arithmetic-focused grades, the equals sign may be &quot;operational&quot;; like the equal button on an electronic calculator, it demands the result of a calculation. Starting in algebra courses, the sign takes on a &quot;relational&quot; meaning of equality between two calculations. Confusion between the two uses of the sign sometimes persists at the university level.

==Architecture==
The architecture of Nagercoil consists of an eclectic combination of architectural styles, ranging from those that predate the creation of the town, from the early Dravidian architecture and Kerala Architecture, to English Gothic Revival, to the 21st century contemporary. Although there are prehistoric and classical structures in the city, the architectural history of Nagercoil effectively begins with the first small settlements from 3 AD. The Roman naturalist and writer Pliny the Elder mentions Nagercoil as a commercial metropolis, having trade links with his contemporaneous Roman merchants, who traded and stayed in unique rock-walled, clay-roofed structures. This legacy can be found in some of the town&#x27;s old heritage structures like the Nagaraja Temple, Nagercoil. The temple has two main deities, Krishna (revered as Ananda Krishna) and Nagaraja. The upadevathas are Shiva, Subrahmanya Swami, Ganesha, Devi, and Dwarapalaka. As an ancient tradition, the priests are Namboothiri Brahmins who are referred by the Pambumekkat mana in Thrissur, Kerala. Later on, Dravidian and Kerala architectural styles began to appear in the area. This can be attributed to the construction of the Thanumalayan Temple in the 16th century.

The 14th century St. Francis Xavier&#x27;s Cathedral, Kottar serves as a testimony to the mix of Roman and native architecture. While Saint Xavier was doing missionary work at Kottar and its neighbourhood, he averted an invasion of Padagas and thus protected the people of the Venad kingdom from that attack which was appreciated by the king, Unni Kerala Varma. In recognition of Xavier&#x27;s services, the king allotted him a piece of land to construct a Catholic church, as a gesture of goodwill, as per the church records. There was already a small church, in the same place where St. Xavier&#x27;s church stands at present, dedicated to Mary the Mother of God, since AD 1544.

The brilliant artistic influence of Kerala and British architecture marvels are seen in the Nagercoil Palace, Nagercoil Clock Tower, Home Church, Scott Christian College, Scott School, Carmel Higher Secondary School, St. Joseph Convent, Sethu Lakshmi Bai School, Nagercoil Court, The Concordia Seminary, Filter House, The Salvation Army Catherine Booth Hospital and many more heritage structures in and around the town.

The Nagercoil Clock Tower is the most visible to the outside world, situated in the heart of the town, which was built to commemorate the visit of Sri Moolam Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, in 1893, and was designed by Hogeorf and S. Horesly of England. The Maharajah himself inaugurated it on 15 February of that year. The pendulum of the clock was made in Derbyshire by Smith of Derby Group, London. The clock is attached to a 60-foot-long chain with a weight, operated with pulleys through gravitational force. The clock in the Nagercoil Clock Tower was presented to the Maharajah by Rev. James Duthie. of the London Missionary Society. The total cost for constructing the Nagercoil Clock Tower was ₹ 3,258, 9 Chakrams and 12 Kasu. The Maharajah of Travancore donated ₹ 1017, and the balance was donated by the public.

<text>Elysian Fields is a rural unincorporated community in Harrison County, Texas, United States. It lies 11 miles southeast of the county seat of Marshall.

The community was originally the site of a Caddo village named Big Springs. The name of the town is believed to have originated from a dinner conversation in New Orleans in which Capt. Edward Smith compared its beauty to the Elysian Fields of Greek Mythology in 1817. Smith and his family settled in the area in the 1830s. In 1910 the community relocated one mile to the west, so it could be linked to a railroad. The community is now the center of the Elysian Fields Independent School District.

The school district has an estimated population of 3,917.

<text>Jawi (; ; Kelantan-Pattani: &quot;Yawi&quot;; ) is a writing system used for writing several languages of Southeast Asia, such as Acehnese, Banjarese, Betawi, Magindanao, Malay, Mëranaw, Minangkabau, Tausūg, Ternate and many other languages in Southeast Asia. Jawi is based on the Arabic script, consisting of all 31 original Arabic letters, six letters constructed to fit phonemes native to Malay, and one additional phoneme used in foreign loanwords, but not found in Classical Arabic, which are &quot;ca&quot; ( ), &quot;nga&quot; ( ), &quot;pa&quot; ( ), &quot;ga&quot; ( ), &quot;va&quot; ( ), and &quot;nya&quot; ( ).

Jawi was developed during the advent of Islam in Maritime Southeast Asia, supplanting the earlier Brahmic scripts used during Hindu-Buddhist era. The oldest evidence of Jawi writing can be found on the 14th century Terengganu Inscription Stone, a text in Classical Malay that contains a mixture of Malay, Sanskrit and Arabic vocabularies. However, the script may have used as early as the 9th century, when Peureulak Sultanate has been established by the son of a Persian preacher. There are two competing theories on the origins of the Jawi alphabet. Popular theory suggests that the system was developed and derived directly from the Arabic script, while scholars like R. O. Windstedt suggest it was developed with the influence of the Perso-Arabic alphabet.

The ensuing trade expansions and the spread of Islam to other areas of Southeast Asia from the 15th century carried the Jawi alphabet beyond the traditional Malay-speaking world. Until the 20th century, Jawi was the standard script of the Malay language, and gave birth to traditional Malay literature when it featured prominently in official correspondences, religious texts, and literary publications. With the arrival of Western influence through colonization and education, Jawi was relegated to religious education, with the Malay language eventually adopting a form of the Latin alphabet called &quot;Rumi&quot; that is currently in general usage.

Today, Jawi is one of two official scripts in Brunei. In Malaysia, the position of Jawi is protected under Section 9 of the National Language Act 1963/67, as it retains a degree of official use in religious and cultural contexts. In some states, most notably Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang, Jawi has co-official script status as businesses are mandated to adopt Jawi signage and billboards. Jawi is also used as an alternative script among Malay communities in Indonesia and Thailand.

Until the early 20th century, there was no standard spelling system for Jawi. The earliest orthographic reform towards a standard system was in 1937 by The Malay Language and Johor Royal Literary Book Pact. This was followed by another reform by Za&#x27;aba, published in 1949. The final major reform was the &quot;Enhanced Guidelines of Jawi Spelling&quot; issued in 1986&quot;,&quot; which was based on the Za&#x27;aba system. Jawi can be typed using the Jawi keyboard.

==Etymology==
The word () is a shortening of the term in , which is the term used by Arabs for Nusantara. The word is a loanword from which is Javanese Krama word to refer to the Java Island or Javanese people.

According to Kamus Dewan, () is a term synonymous to &#x27;Malay&#x27;. The term has been used interchangeably with &#x27;Malay&#x27; in other terms including or (Kelantan-Pattani Malay, a Malayan language used in Southern Thailand), (literally &quot;to become Malay&quot;, referring to the practice of circumcision to symbolise the coming of age), and or (literally &#x27;Malay of the town&#x27; or &#x27;Malay born of&#x27;, referring to the Malay-speaking Muslims of mixed Malay and Indian ancestry). With verb-building circumfixes , (literally ), also refers to the act of translating a foreign text into Malay language. The phrase that means is another derivative that carries the meaning &#x27;Malay script&#x27;.

==Early history==
Prior to the onset of Islamisation, the Pallava script, Nagari, and old Sumatran scripts were used in writing the Malay language. This is evidenced from the discovery of several stone inscriptions in Old Malay, notably the Kedukan Bukit inscription and Talang Tuo inscription. The spread of Islam in Southeast Asia and the subsequent introduction of Arabic writing system began with the arrival of Muslim merchants in the region since the seventh century. Among the oldest archaeological artefacts inscribed with Arabic script are; a tombstone of Syeikh Rukunuddin dated 48 AH (668/669 CE) in Barus, Sumatra; a tombstone dated 290 AH (910 CE) on the mausoleum of Syeikh Abdul Qadir Ibn Husin Syah Alam located in Alor Setar, Kedah; a tombstone found in Pekan, Pahang dated 419 AH (1026 CE); a tombstone discovered in Phan Rang, Vietnam dated 431 AH (1039 CE); a tombstone dated 440 AH (1048 CE) found in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei; and a tombstone of Fatimah Binti Maimun Bin Hibat Allah found in Gresik, East Java dated 475 AH (1082 CE). Islam was spread from the coasts to the interior of the island and generally in a top-down process in which rulers were converted and then introduced more or less orthodox versions of Islam to their peoples. The conversion of King Phra Ong Mahawangsa of Kedah in 1136 and King Merah Silu of Samudra Pasai in 1267 were among the earliest examples.

At the early stage of Islamisation, the Arabic script was taught to the people who had newly embraced Islam in the form of religious practices, such as the recitation of Quran as well as salat. The Arabic script was accepted by the Malay community together with their acceptance of Islam and was adapted to suit spoken Classical Malay. Six letters were added for sounds not found in Arabic: &quot;ca&quot;, &quot;pa&quot;, &quot;ga&quot;, &quot;nga&quot;, &quot;va&quot; and &quot;nya&quot;. Some Arabic letters are rarely used as they represent sounds not present in modern Malay however may be used to reflect the original spelling of Arabic loanwords. The sounds represented by these letters may be assimilated into sounds found in Malay&#x27;s native phoneme inventory or in some instances appear unchanged. Like the other Arabic scripts, some letters are obligatorily joined while some are never joined. This was the same for the acceptance of Arabic writing in Turkey, Persia and India which had taken place earlier and thus, the Jawi script was then deemed as the writing of the Muslims.

The oldest remains of Malay using the Jawi script have been found on the Terengganu Inscription Stone, dated 702 AH (1303 CE), nearly 600 years after the date of the first recorded existence of Arabic script in the region. The inscription on the stone contains a proclamation issued by the &quot;Sri Paduka Tuan&quot; of Terengganu, urging his subjects to &quot;extend and uphold&quot; Islam and providing 10 basic Sharia laws for their guidance. This has attested the strong observance of the Muslim faith in the early 14th century Terengganu specifically and the Malay world as a whole.

The development of Jawi script was different from that of Pallava writing which was exclusively restricted to the nobility and monks in monasteries. The Jawi script was embraced by the entire Muslim community regardless of class. With the increased intensity in the appreciation of Islam, scriptures originally written in Arabic were translated in Malay and written in the Jawi script. Additionally local religious scholars later began to elucidate the Islamic teachings in the forms of original writings. Moreover, there were also individuals of the community who used Jawi for the writing of literature which previously existed and spread orally. With this inclusion of written literature, Malay literature took on a more sophisticated form. This was believed to have taken place from the 15th century and lasted right up to the 19th century. Other forms of Arabic-based scripts existed in the region, notably the Pegon alphabet used for Javanese in Java and the Serang alphabet used for Buginese in South Sulawesi. Both writing systems applied extensive use of Arabic diacritics and added several letters which were formed differently from Jawi letters to suit the languages. Due to their fairly limited usage, the spelling system of both scripts did not undergo similar advanced developments and modifications as experienced by Jawi.

==The spread and extent of Jawi script==
The script became prominent with the spread of Islam, supplanting the earlier writing systems. The Malays held the script in high esteem, believing it was a gateway to understanding Islam and its Holy Book, the Quran. The use of Jawi script was a key factor driving the emergence of Malay as the lingua franca of the region. 

Jawi was widely used in the Sultanate of Malacca, Sultanate of Johor, Sultanate of Maguindanao, Sultanate of Brunei, Sultanate of Sulu, Sultanate of Pattani, the Sultanate of Aceh to the Sultanate of Ternate in the east as early as the 15th century. It was used in royal correspondences, decrees, poems and was widely understood by the merchants in the port of Malacca as the main means of communication. Early legal digests such as the &quot;Undang-Undang Melaka&quot; Code and its derivatives including the Codes of Johor, Perak, Brunei, Kedah, Pattani and Aceh were written in this script. 

Jawi is a traditional symbol of Malay culture and civilisation, used not only amongst the ruling class, but also the common people. The Islamisation and Malayisation of the region popularised Jawi into a dominant script.

Examples of royal correspondences in Jawi are the letter between Sultan Hayat of Ternate and King John III of Portugal (1521), the letter from Sultan Iskandar Muda of Acèh Darussalam to King James I of England (1615), and the letter from Sultan Abdul Jalil IV of Johor to King Louis XV of France (1719). Many literary works such as epics, poetry and prose use the Jawi script. Historical epics such as the &quot;Malay Annals&quot;, as listed by UNESCO under Memories of the World, are among the countless epics written by the Malay people. The Sufic poems by Hamzah Fansuri and many others contributed to the richness and depth of the Malay civilisation.

Jawi script was the official script for the Unfederated Malay States when they were British protectorates. The growth of the printing industry in early 20th century Malaysia saw the development of a wide range of Jawi literature. The primary topics of Jawi books were religious and political. From the 1940s to the 1960s, erotica () began to be printed in Jawi, although many authors later switched to Rumi. A 1954 meeting of the saw Rumi officially adopted as a Malay script alongside Jawi in the Federation of Malaya, and government policy over the next few decades favoured Rumi in education, resulting in Jawi literacy becoming less common. Jawi was removed from the national curriculum in the mid-1980s. 

As the public educational system stopped producing Jawi texts, Jawi literature printed by private companies became dominant. Most privately produced Jawi textbooks were targeted at Islamic schools, and their contents were more conservative than in the former public school textbooks. This shift in usage led to Jawi becoming closely associated with Islam and Malay identity, with Rumi replacing its use for non-religious purposes. Over time, the use of Jawi in Malaysia became a sensitive issue. Some view attempts to promote Jawi as Islamisation or Malay chauvinism. Conversely, some view Jawi as a religious script that should not be used by non-Muslims.

==Jawi today==

Today, Jawi is one of the official scripts of Brunei. In Malaysia, it is used for religious and cultural administration in the states of Terengganu, Kelantan, Kedah, Perlis, Penang, Pahang and Johor. Various efforts were in place to revive the Jawi script in Malaysia and Brunei due to its role in the Malay and Islamic spheres. Jawi is also seen on the reverse of Malaysian ringgit and Brunei dollar banknotes. Malays in Patani still use Jawi today for the same reasons.

=== In Malaysia ===
In August 2019, the Malaysian Government&#x27;s plans to introduce the teaching of Jawi at the most basic level in ethnic Chinese and Tamil vernacular schools attracted opposition from ethnic Chinese and Indian education groups, which claimed that the move would lead to an Islamization of the Malaysian education system. The Chinese educationist group Dong Jiao Zong organised a conference calling on the Malaysian Government to rescind its decision in late December 2019. Perhaps fearing violence, the Royal Malaysia Police obtained a court injunction against it on the grounds it would trigger ethnic tensions.

The state government of Kedah in Malaysia has long defended the use of Jawi in the state. The Menteri Besar of Kedah has denied the allegation that the state government was trying to create an Islamic state ambience by promoting the use of Jawi in 2008, saying that it is a normal occurrence evidenced by Chinese coffeeshops and pawnshops having signboards written in Jawi. This can further be seen later on when the Kedah state government has shown its support with Johor state government&#x27;s move to use Jawi in official matters in 2019. The exco of local authority of the state of Kedah had also stated that the Jawi script in billboards in Kedah is not forbidden, but rather recommended. He claims that the recommendation to use Jawi script has been gazetted in the state law, and that it has been part of the state identity to have billboards in Jawi script in addition to other scripts. He also stated that there are high demands in incorporating Jawi script in billboards in Kedah.

Kuantan, the state capital of Pahang in Malaysia has introduced the usage of Jawi on all signage across the city from 1 August 2019. This was done after a recommendation from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, who was then the Regent of Pahang, to uphold usage of the writing system. The Pahang state government has since expanded the order and made it mandatory for every signage statewide including road signs to display Jawi alongside other scripts from 1 January 2020 after being delayed a few times. Premises that fail to comply with this order will be fined up to a maximum of RM250, with the possibility of revocation of their business licences if they still do not comply afterwards. In the early stage, usage of Jawi stickers are allowed to put on existing signage instead of replacing the whole signage.

In Johor, the test required to become a lawyer in a Syariah Court is written in Jawi. A lack of Jawi literacy is thought to be a contributing factor to a lack of Syariah lawyers in the state.

=== In Indonesia ===
Indonesia, having multiple regional and native languages, uses the Latin script for writing its own standard of Malay in general. Nonetheless, the Jawi script does have a regional status in native Malay areas such as Riau, Riau archipelago, Jambi, South Sumatra (i.e Palembang Malay language), Aceh, and Kalimantan (i.e. Banjar language). This is due to the fact that regional and native languages are compulsory studies in the basic education curriculum of each region (examples include Javanese for Javanese regions, Sundanese for Sundanese regions, Madurese for Maduranese regions, and Jawi for Malay regions). Jawi script is widely used in Riau and Riau Island province, where road signs and government building signs are written in this script. A sister variant called Pegon is used to write Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese and is still widely used in traditional religious schools across Java, but has been supplanted in common writing by the Latin alphabet and, in some cases, Javanese script and Sundanese script.

==Letters==
* Letters with no initial and middle forms adopt either isolated or final form, because they cannot be joined with suffixing letter. (, , , , , , )
* The letter &quot;hamzah&quot; may also appear in its three-quarter form &quot;&quot; (&quot;hamzah tiga suku&quot;), above &quot;alif&quot; &quot;أ&quot;, below &quot;alif&quot; &quot;إ&quot; or housed (above &quot;ya&quot; &quot;ئ&quot; or &quot;wau&quot; &quot;ؤ&quot;).[e]

===Spelling===
Modern Jawi spelling is based on the dictionary. Older texts may use different spellings for some words. Nonetheless, even different modern sources may use different spelling conventions; they may differ especially in the usage of the matres lectionis ( , and ) and the , as well as in the spelling of vowels and consonant clusters in loanwords from English. One source tends to use the following conventions; there are numerous exceptions to them nonetheless.

* Loanwords may be spelled differently. Particularly, loanwords from Arabic often keep their original spellings.

: The letters , , , , , , , , , , and are mostly used to spell Arabic loanwords, e.g., , , , , , , , , , . The letter is mostly used to spell English loanwords, e.g., . The letters , , , and are mostly used to spell loanwords from English, Arabic or Dutch, e.g., , , , , , , , and .

: Rumi used to spell loanwords from English may be spelled using different Jawi letters, depending on pronunciation, e.g., in or in .

: The letter is also used to represent especially for words derived from Classical Malay language, e.g., ; and loanwords, e.g., .

: Native Malay root morphemes with Rumi in the syllable coda are glottal stops (pronounced ) and are written with , e.g., , , , , . Loanwords where the Rumi is derived from Western languages are spelled with : the initial and medial forms use the glyph , e.g., and ; the final form dominantly uses instead of , although the latter Arabic glyph is alternatively found often in some old writings and signages (e.g. variant spelling of as ).

: The letter was historically used to represent (Jawi: ) and such usage may still be found in archaic Jawi spellings. This is because is a non-native consonant in Malay found only in loanwords and in the past was often approximated as a .

* Though there are exceptions, vowels and diphthongs tend to be spelled this way:

* When spelling vowels, there are many exceptions to the conventions stated above and below. Common exceptions include , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
* Some words spelled distinctly in Rumi may be homographs in Jawi, e.g., and are both , and are both , and are both , and are both , and are both , and and are both .
* Using or omitting when representing in closed syllables and in the last letter of a root morpheme:

: When representing , is mostly omitted in CVC-syllables.

: However, it is usually not omitted in monosyllabic words that start with , e.g., , , .

: It is also usually not omitted in root morphemes which first syllable is open and contains and which second syllable is closed and begins with , e.g., words with a /Ce.waC/ structure (where each C is a consonant) like , , , , , , , , , .

: Final is generally kept to represent at the end of a word.

: However, in native Malay disyllabic root morphemes with the form /Ca.C*a/ [Ca.C*ə], where /C*/ is any of the following 12 consonants , , , , , , , , , , , (mnemonic: ), final is not written, e.g., , , , , , , , , , , , , and .

: Some native Malay trisyllabic root morphemes ending with , with three open syllables and which include the abovementioned 12 consonants, may also omit the final .

* As the final letter of a word, root morpheme-final that is spelled with in Rumi may be represented by in Jawi. In the middle of a word, root morpheme-final that is spelled with in Rumi may be represented by in Jawi instead, e.g., → , → .
* The may be used to spell some diphthongs. Sources differ as to whether and when it should be on the line , or placed above the previous mater lectionis, such as in with above , or even if it should be used at all in some words.

: Furthermore, it may be used to represent a hiatus, or a glottal stop , especially when (but not limited to) separating vowels at the boundary of a root morpheme and an affix, e.g., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , .
* Arabic numerals are the preferred form for writing numerals in Jawi script, Eastern Arabic numerals are generally not used (except when indicating plural words, i.e., = ).

: Full reduplication of a base word is represented with the numeral , e.g., , while the suffixed reduplication of a base word is represented with the hyphen &quot;-&quot;, e.g., , , and .

*Punctuation marks used in written Jawi are as follows:
==Examples==
Akin to the Arabic script, Jawi is constructed from right-to-left. Below is an exemplification of the Jawi script extracted from the first and second verse of the notable , (English: A Ghazal for Rabiah).

<text>Public interest immunity (PII), previously known as Crown privilege, is a principle of English common law under which the English courts can grant a court order allowing one litigant to refrain from disclosing evidence to the other litigants where disclosure would be damaging to the public interest. This is an exception to the usual rule that all parties in litigation must disclose any evidence that is relevant to the proceedings. In making a PII order, the court has to balance the public interest in the administration of justice (which demands that relevant material is available to the parties to litigation) and the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of certain documents whose disclosure would be damaging. PII orders have been used in criminal law against large organised criminal outfits and drug dealers where the identity of paid police informants could be at risk.

==Seeking the order==
An order that PII applies would usually be sought by the British government to protect official secrets, and so can be perceived as a gagging order. Where a minister believes that PII applies, he signs a PII certificate, which then allows the court to make the final decision on whether the balance of public interest was in favour of disclosure or not. Generally, a court will allow a claim of PII without inspecting the documents: only where there is some doubt will the court inspect the documents to decide whether PII applies.

Originally, a government minister was under a duty to advance a PII point where PII could be relevant, and the court took a certificate from a minister claiming PII as final and conclusive. However, over time, there has been an increase in both the ability of a minister to make a disclosure, notwithstanding the potential application of PII, and the ability of the courts to review a claim of PII. In &quot;Conway v Rimmer&quot; [1968], the House of Lords held that the courts retained the final decision on whether PII should be upheld, and, in &quot;R v Chief Constable of West Midlands, ex parte Wiley&quot; [1995], the House of Lords decided that a minister could discharge his duty by making his own judgment of where the public interest lies (that is, to disclose or to assert PII). In practice, this is thought to have led to a reduction in the number of cases when PII is asserted.

==History==
PII was previously known as Crown privilege, and derived from the same principle as the sovereign immunity of the Crown from prosecution before the Crown Proceedings Act 1947. However, PII is not limited to the Crown (see the &quot;NSPCC&quot; case mentioned below), and cannot be waived save in exceptional circumstances.

A number of PII certificates were signed in relation to the prosecutions of individuals involved in the Matrix Churchill &quot;Arms to Iraq&quot; case, a subject that was subsequently investigated in the Scott Report.

===Examples===
*&quot;Duncan v Cammell Laird and Co Ltd&quot; [1942] AC 624. The submarine sank on 1 June 1939 during sea trials with the loss of 99 lives. The families of the sailors who had been killed in the disaster claimed damages from the builders, Cammell Laird. The House of Lords upheld a certificate issued by the Admiralty claiming PII in relation to the plans of the submarine. The House of Lords also held that the courts should take a PII certificate at face value.
*&quot;Tomlinson v HMG&quot;. In 1995, former MI6 officer Richard Tomlinson attempted to bring MI6 before an employment tribunal to seek compensation for unfair dismissal. MI6 argued that this would &quot;damage national security&quot; and obtained a PII certificate from the then foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind to block Tomlinson&#x27;s application. Tomlinson argued vociferously that the real reason that MI6 obtained the PII certificate was to cover up their incompetent and dishonest personnel management.
*&quot;Conway v Rimmer&quot; [1968]. The House of Lords held that the courts are the final arbiters of whether PII applies or not. 
*&quot;D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children&quot; [1978] AC 171. The NSPCC investigated an allegation that D was mistreating her child. D claimed damages, and sought documents from the NSPCC to identify who had made the allegation. The House of Lords upheld the NSPCC&#x27;s claim of PII, since its legitimate role in protecting the welfare of children was clearly in the public interest and would be threatened by disclosure.
*&quot;Air Canada v Secretary of State for Trade&quot; [1983] 2 AC 384. A group of airlines claimed that the British Airports Authority had unlawfully increased landing fees at the instigation of a government minister. The minister disclosed some documents, but claimed PII in respect of others. The House of Lords decided not to inspect the disputed documents, holding that inspection was only required if they were &quot;reasonably likely&quot; to assist or damage a party&#x27;s case.
*&quot;R v Chief Constable of West Midlands, ex parte Wiley&quot; [1995] 1 AC 274. The House of Lords decided that a minister could discharge his duty by making his own judgment of where the public interest lies, and was not obliged to claim PII in all cases where it may be applicable.
* The Scott Inquiry in 1996 found that public interest immunity certificates had been issued which withheld from defence counsel certain documents which would have exonerated the defendants in the Matrix Churchill trial.
* &quot;R v Paul Burrell&quot; [2002]. A public interest immunity certificate allowed the prosecution to apply to the judge for a ruling that disclosure of certain information would be harmful to the public interest and should not be made public.
* &quot;R v Hicks, Nute and Rowe&quot; [2002]. A public interest immunity certificate was presented to the court by the Crown Prosecution Service after about ten minutes of this hearing. A possible reason for the introduction of the PII certificate was that the Duchy of Cornwall refuses to reveal the circumstances under which it transferred several of its properties (including Tintagel Castle) to the care of English Heritage.
* &quot;R v Yam&quot; [2008] (trial of Wang Yam for the murder of Allan Chappelow). In December 2007 the Crown Prosecution Service indicated it would ask for this trial for murder, burglary and deception to be held &quot;in camera&quot;, making it the first UK murder trial ever heard behind closed doors without access by press or public. A public interest immunity certificate was sought by the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith; it was reported by &quot;The Times&quot; on 13 December 2007 that the grounds were &quot;on the basis of protecting national security interests and to protect the identity of informants&quot;. A further order was made under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 prohibiting the press from any speculation as to the reasons for parts of the trial being held in private. In the Court of Appeal on 28 January, the &quot;gagging order&quot; was upheld, with the Lord Chief Justice insisting that a fair trial would be possible even if some or all of it is held &quot;in camera&quot;.
*&quot;R (Mohamed) v Foreign Secretary&quot; [2010]
*During the public inquiry into the Horizon scandal, it came to light that two lawyers for the Post Office who were conducting a prosecution of a sub-postmaster in Birmingham crown court had persuaded the judge to allow them, on grounds of public interest immunity, not to disclose to the defence a report by forensic accountants which alleged prosecutorial misconduct by the Post Office in similar cases. This was unusual in that Post Office Ltd was a private company, albeit one entrusted with a public function.

== European Convention on Human Rights ==
Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights protects the right to a fair trial; an &quot;implied&quot; right stemming from this is that of &quot;equality of arms&quot; – the idea that hearings should be adversarial and both parties should have access to the same evidence and witnesses. The European Court of Human Rights has held that Article 6 (especially the &quot;implied&quot; rights) is not an absolute right and that measures restricting the rights of the defence so as to safeguard an important public interest are lawful if &quot;strictly necessary&quot;.

It is of note that fewer PII certificates have been issued in recent years. For example, MI6 have not succeeded in obtaining a PII certificate since the 1995 Tomlinson case, and have thus been subject to court scrutiny for investigations such as the inquest into the death of the Princess of Wales, and allegations that their officers partook in torture.
