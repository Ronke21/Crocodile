<text>The Didaktik was a series of 8-bit home computers based on the clones of Intel 8080 and Zilog Z80 processors produced by Didaktik in Skalica, in the former Czechoslovakia.

Initially the company produced PMD 85 compatible machines aimed at schools, then switching to the home market with ZX Spectrum clones.

Didaktik&#x27;s glory diminished with the falling price of the 16-bit computers, such as the Atari and Amiga, around the middle of the 1990s until it was finally steam-rolled by the PC soon after. The production of Didaktik computers stopped in the year 1994.

==Didaktik Alfa==

Didaktik Alfa was produced in 1986, as a &quot;more professional&quot; clone of PMD 85. It featured 2.048 MHz Intel 8080 CPU, 48 KB RAM, 8 KB ROM with built-in BASIC, good keyboard (compared with PMD 85), monitor video output (but no TV output) with 288×256 resolution and four possible colours. Despite some changes in ROM, it was mostly compatible with PMD 85. Didaktik Alfa 1 was a clone of PMD 85-1, Didaktik Alfa 2 of PMD 85-2.

==Didaktik Beta==

Didaktik Beta was a slightly improved version of previous Didaktik Alfa, having almost identical hardware. Didaktik Alfa and Beta were mostly deployed in schools to replace older PMD 85 computers.

==Didaktik Gama==

Didaktik Gama was a ZX Spectrum clone with 80 KB RAM divided into two switched 32 KB memory banks and 16 KB of slower RAM containing graphical data for video output, while the size of ROM was 16 KB. A peripheral interface with a 8255 chip was added, providing centronics plotter and printer connections and a Kempston joystick port.

The case was similar to that of the ZX Spectrum+, a grey or black box in A5 size, with a flat plastic keyboard and connectors mounted on the rear side. The Gama uses a standard ULA chip made by Ferranti. All games developed for the ZX Spectrum 48K were generally compatible with this computer. An audio cassette was used as data storage and a TV served as a monitor. It is generally said the Gama was unreachable to buy and there were waiting lists several years long. 

Didaktik Gama was produced in three variants: the first, Gama &#x27;87, fixed some bugs in the original ZX Spectrum ROM (thus breaking compatibility with some software) and introduced its own bugs effectively inhibiting the use of the second 32 KB memory bank from BASIC. Gama &#x27;88 fixed the original ZX Spectrum bugs in a more compatible way, and also fixed the memory switching bug. The final and the more compatible model was Gama &#x27;89. 

The computer was expensive but available on the market and could be purchased in Czechoslovak currency outside specialized Tuzex stores, unlike other foreign home computers. Production of Didaktik Gama computers ceased in 1992.

==Didaktik M==

The Didaktik M introduced in 1990, was more advanced in design and reliability than the Gama. The computer was considerably redesigned, the case was more modern, with an ergonomic-like shape and separate arrow keys.

Instead of the original ULA, a custom circuit from Russian company Angstrem was used, giving a square screen aspect ratio, instead of a typical 4:3 rectangle. In addition, the whole RAM was implemented by a single set of 64 KB chips, from which only 48 KB were used. There was no difference between fast and slow memory regarding video content. System timings were different to the original ZX Spectrum, which prevented some software from correctly displaying timing dependent visual effects. Though this didn&#x27;t significantly affect majority of games or regular software, it could negatively impact demos which would be employing more advanced visual techniques. 

Unlike the original ZX Spectrum, Didaktik M already provided two builtin connectors for joysticks. For this, the computer included own integrated Kempston and Sinclair interfaces (each with one dedicated port). These ports were hard-wired to the interfaces, so it was not possible to switch to e.g. a &quot;Sinclair Left + Sinclair Right&quot; layout (as would be seen on a real ZX Interface 2), the available Sinclair joystick port was always mapped to what would be the &quot;Sinclair Right&quot; or &quot;Interface 2 Right&quot; joystick in games and the &quot;Kempston joystick&quot; was then present on the other dedicated port (even thought the actual joystick hardware was the same and joysticks could be plugged to either of the ports interchangeably). Unfortunately, these ports were direct PCB edge connectors - therefore physically incompatible with any typical Atari-style joystick on the market at the time.

Locally, Kovodružstvo Náchod and Didaktik Skalica manufactured joysticks with connectors directly compatible with Didaktik M joystick ports. As the ports were otherwise pin-to-pin compatible with the Atari standard, it was relatively common to owners to create or buy an inexpensive DYI adapter to allow connection of any typical Atari 2600 / ZX Spectrum / C64 compatible joystick (the locally produced joysticks were not highly regarded for their build quality or ergonomics). Essentially, the adapter would just wire the edge connectors pins into standard 9-pin D-sub ports, which were left out of the Didaktik M design due to cost saving measures, adding the &quot;missing&quot; D-sub connector onto an edge connector. This would also provide much necessary protection as frequent insertions and removals of an original joystick would wear down the edge connector significantly, or could even lead to breaking off part of the PCB during less careful manipulation.

A 5.25-inch floppy disk drive, called D40, was introduced in 1992 and featured a &quot;Snapshot&quot; (see hibernation) button that stored the current memory contents on diskette. It was then possible to later load this memory image and continue the software from its previous state.

A 3.5-inch floppy disk drive, called D80, was also introduced later in 1992, simultaneously to the release of the Didaktik Kompakt.

==Didaktik Kompakt==
The Didaktik Kompakt from 1992 was basically a Didaktik M with a built-in 3.5-inch 720 KB floppy drive and a parallel printer port. It also incorporated the internal updates of the previous Didaktik M revisions and added own minor updates (such as a redesigned motherboard, or addition of RGB SCART output).

<doc id="496992" wikidata="Q1032806" url="?curid=496992" title="Canapé">
<text>A canapé () is a type of starter, a small, prepared, and often decorative food, consisting of a small piece of bread (sometimes toasted) or cracker, wrapped or topped with some savoury food, held in the fingers and often eaten in one bite.

==Name==
The name comes from the French word for sofa, drawing on the analogy that the garnish sits atop the bread as people do on a sofa.

==Details==
Because they are often served during cocktail hours, it is often desired that a canapé be either salty or spicy, in order to encourage guests to drink more. 

A canapé may also be referred to as finger food, although not all finger foods are canapés. Crackers or small slices of bread or toast or puff pastry are cut into various shapes, used as the base for savory butters or pastes, and often topped with other savory foods such as meat, cheese, fish, caviar, &quot;foie gras&quot;, purées or relish.

Traditionally, &quot;canapés&quot; are built on stale bread (although other foods such as puff pastry, crackers, or fresh vegetables may be used as a base) cut in thin slices and then shaped with a cutter or knife into circles, rings, squares, strips or triangles. These are then deep fried, sautéed, or toasted, then topped or piped with highly processed and decoratively applied items. Colorful and eye-pleasing garnishes often complete the presentation. 

The &quot;canapés&quot; are usually served on a canapé salver and eaten from small canapé plates.

==Composition==
The composition of a canapé consists of a base (e.g., the bread or pancake), a spread, a main item, and a garnish. 

The spread is traditionally either a compound butter, made by creaming butter with other ingredients such as ham or lobster, or a flavored cream cheese. Mayonnaise salads can also be prepared as spreads. 

Common garnishes can range from finely chopped vegetables, scallions, and herbs to caviar or truffle oil.

According to &quot;Lowney&#x27;s Cook Book&quot; (1912):

Canapés are made from white, graham, and brown bread, sliced very thin and cut in various shapes. They may be dipped in melted butter, toasted or fried. 

They could be served hot or cold, spread with anchovy, crab or caviar paste, served with garnishes like green and red peppers, paprika, and lemon juice. 

Bread triangles can be sauteed in bacon fat, deep fried, or just buttered and browned in the oven. 

Mustard can be use as a spread for canapés garnished with chopped bacon, grated cheese, or chopped olives.

<doc id="496994" wikidata="Q939369" url="?curid=496994" title="Lou Barlow">
<text>Louis Knox Barlow (born July 17, 1966) is an American alternative rock musician and songwriter. A founding member of the groups Dinosaur Jr., Sebadoh and the Folk Implosion, Barlow is credited with helping to pioneer the lo-fi style of rock music in the late 1980s and early 1990s. His first band, which was formed in Amherst, Massachusetts, was Deep Wound.

Barlow has released four solo albums.

==Early life==
Barlow was born in Dayton, Ohio, and raised in Jackson, Michigan, and Westfield, Massachusetts.

==Dinosaur Jr.==
Barlow attended high school in Westfield, Massachusetts, where he met Scott Helland. The two formed the Massachusetts-based hardcore punk band Deep Wound. J Mascis joined the band after answering their ad for a &quot;drummer wanted to play really fast&quot;. After becoming disillusioned with the constraints of hardcore, Deep Wound broke up in 1984. Mascis and Barlow reunited that year to form Dinosaur, later Dinosaur Jr. Mascis and Barlow had personality conflicts throughout Dinosaur Jr.&#x27;s early existence, and after the 1988 release of their third album, &quot;Bug&quot;, and the initial supporting tour, Barlow was kicked out of the band.

In 2005, Barlow rejoined the band alongside the original drummer, Murph. Since then, the band has reissued its first three records, toured extensively worldwide and released five new records, &quot;Beyond&quot;, &quot;Farm&quot;, &quot;I Bet on Sky&quot;, &quot;Give a Glimpse of What Yer Not&quot;, and &quot;Sweep It Into Space &quot;.

==Sebadoh, Sentridoh and the Folk Implosion==
After his dismissal from Dinosaur Jr., Barlow turned his attention to his band Sebadoh, which he had formed earlier with multi-instrumentalist Eric Gaffney. The project featured low fidelity recording techniques and combined Barlow&#x27;s introspective, confessional songwriting with Gaffney&#x27;s discordant noise collages. Bassist and songwriter Jason Loewenstein was added to the line-up in 1989. Sebadoh&#x27;s early releases include &quot;The Freed Man&quot; (1989) and &quot;Weed Forestin&#x27;&quot; (1990), the latter of which was originally self-released under the name Sentridoh in 1987. Both albums were officially released by Homestead Records, as was the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Sebadoh III&quot; (1991), which helped establish the &quot;lo-fi&quot; subgenre and became a defining album of 90s indie rock. The band released several studio-recorded albums on Sub Pop Records throughout the 1990s.

As Sebadoh grew in popularity and critical acclaim, Barlow continued work on the Sentridoh side project, which featured mostly home-recorded material similar to his output on the first three Sebadoh albums, but often recorded solo and with a less consistent sound quality. Sentridoh released a trio of cassette-only albums on Shrimper Records in the early 1990s, with the highlights later being collected on CD and vinyl compilations like &quot;Winning Losers: A Collection of Home Recordings 89–93&quot; (1994) and &quot;Another Collection of Home Recordings&quot; (1994). In 1993, Sentridoh released a popular single for the song &quot;Losercore,&quot; on the label Smells Like Records founded by Steve Shelley of the American rock band, Sonic Youth. Barlow has called it &quot;the most finely executed of all my releases&quot; thanks to Shelley, who &quot;made sure this looked and sounded great.&quot; Numerous other Sentridoh releases on a variety of record labels followed, including releases on his own Loobiecore label.

In 1994, Barlow formed the Folk Implosion with singer-songwriter John Davis. The band released several singles and EPs, and in 1995 reached the Top 40 with the song &quot;Natural One&quot;, from the soundtrack to the film &quot;Kids&quot; by Larry Clark. It remains Barlow&#x27;s biggest commercial hit.

After the release of Sebadoh&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;The Sebadoh&quot;, in 1999, the band went on hiatus and its members went on to pursue other projects. Barlow continued to work with the Folk Implosion, releasing &quot;One Part Lullaby&quot; in 1999. Barlow took a break from the Folk Implosion in 2000 to collaborate on the album &quot;Subsonic 6&quot; with Belgian musician, Rudy Trouvé. In 2003, Barlow released &quot;The New Folk Implosion&quot; featuring Imaad Wasif on guitar and Sebadoh drummer Russ Pollard on drums. The same year, he appeared as a musician in the film &quot;Laurel Canyon&quot;. In the spring of 2004, Barlow briefly reunited with Loewenstein for the &quot;Turbo Acoustic&quot; Sebadoh tour. During this tour, he also reunited with J Mascis for a performance of the song &quot;Video Prick&quot; with former Deep Wound vocalist Charlie Nakajima. This performance led to a full-fledged Dinosaur Jr. reunion in 2005, with original members Barlow, Mascis and Murph performing &quot;The Lung&quot; on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; on April 15, 2005, and a show at Spaceland in Los Angeles the following night. The band then played well-received tours of the U.S. and Europe throughout the rest of the year, and in 2006 headed to Japan, Australia and New Zealand. In 2007, Barlow reunited with Loewenstein and Gaffney to perform the first Sebadoh shows with the &quot;classic&quot; lineup in 14 years. In June 2013, Sebadoh released their first new music in 14 years; the music was released as an EP precursor to their new album, &quot;Defend Yourself,&quot; which was released in September 2013. Both of the new EP and LP albums were released through Joyful Noise Recordings.

==Solo work==
Barlow released the first album under his own name, &quot;Emoh&quot;, in January 2005 on Merge Records. It featured long-time collaborators such as Sebadoh members Jason Loewenstein and Russ Pollard and Lou&#x27;s sister Abby Barlow, and featured a higher production value than many of his previous solo releases. Jason Crock of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called it &quot;the most consistently strong record he&#x27;s released since the Folk Implosion&#x27;s &quot;One Part Lullaby&quot;&quot; and wrote that &quot;even if much of it was recorded at home, &quot;Emoh&quot;&#x27;s 14 unassuming folk songs sound like they were created in a professional setting.&quot; In November 2005, Barlow toured the Iberian Peninsula to promote the album.

<text>The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, doing business as Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS), is an American multinational pharmaceutical company. Headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey, BMS is one of the world&#x27;s largest pharmaceutical companies and consistently ranks on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 list of the largest U.S. corporations. For fiscal 2022, it had a total revenue of $46.2 billion.

Bristol Myers Squibb manufactures prescription pharmaceuticals and biologics in several therapeutic areas, including cancer, HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psychiatric disorders.

BMS&#x27;s primary research and development (R&amp;D) sites are located in Lawrence, New Jersey (formerly Squibb, near Princeton), Summit, New Jersey, formerly HQ of Celgene, New Brunswick, New Jersey, Redwood City, California, and Seville in Spain, with other sites in Devens and Cambridge, Massachusetts, Braine-l&#x27;Alleud, Belgium, Tokyo, Japan, Hyderabad; Bangalore, India and Wirral, United Kingdom. BMS previously had an R&amp;D site in Wallingford, Connecticut (formerly Bristol-Myers).

==History==
===Squibb===

The Squibb corporation was founded in 1858 by Edward Robinson Squibb in Brooklyn, New York. Squibb was known as an advocate of quality control and high purity standards early within the pharmaceutical industry. He went on to self-publish an alternative to the U.S. Pharmacopeia titled &quot;Squibb&#x27;s Ephemeris of Materia Medica,&quot; after failing to convince the American Medical Association to incorporate higher purity standards.

&quot;Materia Medica&quot;, Squibb products, and Edward Squibb&#x27;s opinion on the fundamentals of pharmacy are found in many medical papers of the late 1800s. The &quot;American Journal of Pharmacy&quot; published more than one hundred papers of Squibb&#x27;s research surrounding the industry.

The sons of Edward Squibb sold the company to Lowell M. Palmer and Theodore Weicker in 1905, who incorporated the company. Around this time, the Squibb logo was developed, which represented the company&#x27;s products of &quot;uniformity, purity, efficacy, and reliability based on research.&quot;

Squibb Corporation served as a major supplier of medical goods to the Union Army during the American Civil War, providing portable medical kits containing morphine, surgical anesthetics, and quinine for the treatment of malaria (which was endemic in most of the Eastern United States at that time).

In 1944, Squibb opened the world&#x27;s largest penicillin plant in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
===Bristol-Myers===
In 1887, Hamilton College graduates William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical company of Clinton, New York. In May 1898, they decided to rename it Bristol, Myers and Company. Following Myers&#x27; death in 1899, Bristol changed the name to the Bristol-Myers Corporation.

During the 1890s, the company introduced its first nationally recognized product Sal Hepatica, a laxative mineral salt, followed by Ipana toothpaste in 1901. Other divisions were Clairol (hair colors and haircare) and Drackett (household products such as Windex and Drano).

In 1943, Bristol-Myers acquired Cheplin Biological Laboratories, a producer of acidophilus milk in East Syracuse, New York, and converted the plant to produce penicillin for the World War II Allied forces. After the war, the company renamed the plant Bristol Laboratories in 1945 and entered the civilian antibiotics market, where it faced competition from Squibb.

Penicillin production at the East Syracuse plant ended in 2005, when it became less expensive to produce overseas. As of 2010, the facility was used for the manufacturing process development and production of other biologic medicines for clinical trials and commercial use.

===Merger===
In 1989, Bristol-Myers and Squibb merged and became Bristol-Myers Squibb.

In 1999, then-U.S. President Bill Clinton awarded Bristol-Myers Squibb the National Medal of Technology, the nation&#x27;s highest recognition for technological achievement, &quot;for extending, and enhancing human life through innovative pharmaceutical research and development and for redefining the science of clinical study through groundbreaking and hugely complex clinical trials that are recognized models in the industry.&quot;

===2000 to 2010===
In 2002, the company was involved in a lawsuit of illegally maintaining a monopoly on Taxol, its cancer treatment, and it was again sued for the antitrust lawsuit five years later, which cost the company $125 million for settlement.

Also in 2002, Bristol-Myers Squibb was involved in an accounting scandal that resulted in a significant restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. The restatement was the result of an improper booking of sales related to &quot;channel stuffing&quot; as the practice of offering excess inventory to customers to create higher sales numbers. The company has since settled with the United States Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission, agreeing to pay $150 million, while neither admitting nor denying guilt.

On 24 October 2002, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. restated earnings downward for parts of 2000 and 2001, while revising 2002 earnings upward because of its massive inventory backlog imbroglio that spurred two government investigations. On 15 March 2004, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. adjusted upward its fourth-quarter and full-year 2003 results after reversing an earlier decision about how to deal with accounting errors made in prior years.

As part of a deferred prosecution agreement, the company was placed under the oversight of a monitor appointed by the U.S. attorney in New Jersey. In addition, the former head of the Pharma group, Richard Lane, and the ex-CFO, Fred Schiff, were indicted for federal securities violations.
In July 2006, an investigation of the company was made public, and the FBI raided the company&#x27;s corporate offices. The investigation centered on the distribution of Plavix and charges of collusion. On 12 September 2006, the monitor, former Federal Judge Frederick B. Lacey, urged the company to remove then-CEO Peter Dolan over the Plavix dispute. Later that day, BMS announced that Dolan would indeed step down.

The deferred prosecution agreement expired in June 2007 and the Department of Justice did not take any further legal action against the company for matters covered by the DPA. Under CEO Jim Cornelius, who was CEO following Dolan until May 2010, all executives involved in the &quot;channel-stuffing&quot; and generic competition scandals have since left the company.

In 2009, the company began a major restructuring focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, along with productivity initiatives and cost-cutting and streamlining business operations through a multiyear program of on-going layoffs. This was part of a business strategy launched in 2007 to transform the company from a large, diversified pharmaceutical company to a specialty biopharma company, which also included the closure of half of their manufacturing facilities. As another cost-cutting measure, Bristol-Myers Squibb also reduced health-care subsidies for retirees and planned to freeze their pension plan at the end of 2009.

BMS is a &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 Company (#114 in 2010 list). &quot;Newsweek&#x27;s &quot;2009 Green Ranking recognized Bristol-Myers Squibb as eighth among 500 of the largest United States corporations. Also, BMS was included in the 2009 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index of leading sustainability-driven companies.

Lamberto Andreotti was named CEO in 2010; he had previously served as &quot;president and COO responsible for all pharmaceutical operations worldwide.&quot;

===2010 onward===

In 2010, Lou Schmukler joined Bristol-Myers Squibb as the president of global product development and design. Schmukler led the team that completed the company&#x27;s strategic transformation to a specialty biopharmaceutical company that had begun in 2007. As of 2011, the company had a dozen manufacturing facilities and six product development sites.

Citing major developments and a market capitalization of US$87 billion and stock appreciation of 61.4%, Bristol-Myers Squibb was ranked as the best drug company of 2013 by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine.

In December 2014, the company received FDA approval for the use of the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo) in treating patients whose skin cancer cannot be removed or have not responded to previous drug therapies. In February 2015, the company initiated a research partnership with Rigel Pharmaceuticals which could generate more than $339 million. In March, the company obtained an exclusive opportunity to both licence and commercialise PROSTVAC, Bavarian Nordic&#x27;s phase III prostate-specific antigen targeting cancer immunotherapy. Bavarian Nordic would receive an upfront payment of $60 million and incremental payments up to $230 million, if the overall survival of test patients exceeds that seen in Phase II tests. Bavarian could also receive milestone payments of between $110 million and $495 million, dependent on regulatory authorization, and these payments have the potential to total up to $975 million.

In May 2015, Dr. Giovanni Caforio became CEO of the company; Caforio was formerly the company&#x27;s COO and succeeded Andreotti upon his retirement. Andreotti subsequently succeeded James Cornelius as executive chairman upon his retirement.

In late February 2017, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;Fortune&quot;, among others, reported that activist investor Carl Icahn had taken a stake in the company, signaling a potential future takeover from the likes of Gilead Sciences.

In April 2018, the company reported net income of $1.5 billion, or 91 cents per share, for the first quarter of the year, thanks to the increased sales of their cancer drug Opdivo.

=== Corporate acquisitions and divestments as Bristol Myers Squibb ===

In August 2009, during a major restructuring activity, BMS acquired the biotechnology firm Medarex as part of the company&#x27;s &quot;String of Pearls&quot; strategy of alliances, partnerships, and acquisitions. In November 2009, Bristol Myers Squibb announced that it was &quot;splitting off&quot; Mead Johnson Nutrition by offering BMY shareholders the opportunity to exchange their stock for shares in Mead Johnson. According to Bristol Myers Squibb, this move was expected to further sharpen the company&#x27;s focus on biopharmaceuticals.

In October 2010, the company acquired ZymoGenetics, securing an existing product, as well as pipeline assets in hepatitis C, cancer, and other therapeutic areas. 

Bristol Myers Squibb agreed to pay around $2.5 billion in cash to buy Inhibitex Inc. in attempt to compete with Gilead/Pharmasset to produce hepatitis C drugs. The settlement will be finished in 2 months for its Inhibitex&#x27;s shareholders acceptance of 126% premium price of its price over the previous 20 trading days ended on 6 January. On 29 June, BMS extended its portfolio of diabetes treatments when it agreed to buy Amylin Pharmaceuticals for around in cash and pay to Eli Lilly to cover Amylin&#x27;s debt and its outstanding collaboration-related obligations. AstraZeneca, which already collaborated on several diabetes treatments with BMS, agreed to pay US$3.4 billion in cash for the right to continue development of Amylin&#x27;s products. Two years later, the company divested Amylin to AstraZeneca.

In April 2014, BMS announced its acquisition of iPierian for up to $725 million.

In February 2015, the company acquired Flexus Biosciences for $1.25 billion. As part of this deal, BMS will gain full rights to Flexus&#x27; lead small molecule IDO1-inhibitor, F001287. In November, the company acquired the cardiovascular disease drug developer Cardioxyl for up to $2.075 billion. The deal strengthens the BMS&#x27; critical pipelines with the phase II candidate for acute decompensated heart failure, CXL-1427.

In March 2016, the company announced it would acquire Padlock Therapeutics for up to $600 million. In early July, the company announced it would acquire Cormorant Pharmaceuticals for $520 million, boosting BMS&#x27; oncology offering through Cormorants monoclonal antibody targeted against interleukin-8.

In August 2017 the company acquired IFM Therapeutics for $300 million upfront, with contingency payments of $1.01 billion due on certain milestones – allowing BMS to better compete against Merck &amp; Co&#x27;s cancer rival treatment, Keytruda.

In early January 2019, the company announced it would acquire Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) for $74 billion ($95 billion including debt), in a deal that would become the largest pharmaceutical-company acquisition ever. The Celgene acquisition aimed to be a refresher to the company&#x27;s pipeline, helping to overcome from declining sales of Opdivo relative to competitor Keytruda. Under the terms of the deal, Celgene shareholders would receive one BMS share as well as $50 in cash for each Celgene share held, valuing Celgene at $102.43 a share; representing a 54% premium to the previous days closing price. Investor opposition to this acquisition, leading into a 12 April shareholder vote, appeared when BMS&#x27;s second-largest investor, Wellington Management, voiced its opposition, followed by investor Starboard Value. In April 2019 BMS announced that 75% of its shareholders voted to approve the pending merger with Celgene. Transaction to close in the third quarter of 2019, subject to regulatory approvals. Newly issued BMS shares and CVRs will commence trading on the New York Stock Exchange, with the CVRs trading under the symbol &#x27;BMYRT&#x27;.

The strategic divestment of the company&#x27;s consumer health business, UPSA, to Taisho completed in 2019. UPSA focused product delivery on France and the rest of Europe. As early as 2005, the company had divested individual consumer products, and its US- and Canada-focused consumer products business.

In August, the Amgen announced it would acquire the Otezla drug programme from Celgene for $13.4 billion, as part of Celgene and BMS&#x27;s merger deal.

In February 2020, BMS and partner Biomotiv launched a new company called Anteros Pharmaceuticals, which focuses on creating inflammation and fibrosis medicines. In August, the business announced it would acquire Forbius and its TGF-beta 1 &amp; TGF-beta 3 inhibitors. In October, BMS announced it would acquire cardiology company MyoKardia for $13.1 billion ($225 per share) gaining control of mavacamten, a cardiovascular drug for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and the development of two key treatments: danicamtiv (MYK-491) and MYK-224.

In June 2022, BMS announced it would acquire Turning Point Therapeutics Inc for $4.1 billion in cash ($76 per share, a 122.5% premium to its last closing price), helping to boost its complement of cancer drugs, specifically repotrectinib. That same month, the company announced it would be investing $180m in French AI company Owkin, to design potentially more precise and efficient clinical trials. The collaboration will initially focus on cardiovascular diseases, and has the potential to extend into projects in other therapeutic areas.

<text>Rudy Trouvé (born 28 January 1967) is a Belgian musician.

In the early nineties, he founded the Heavenhotel record label and released dozens of records since. Between 1993 and 1995 he was part of Deus, quitting the band in favour of focusing on his own solo career, exploring obscure music groups and temporary collaborations.

Since 1995, he scored most success with Kiss My Jazz and Dead Man Ray, and recorded a split album with Lou Barlow on the Sub Rosa label.

Rudy Trouvé is regarded highly as an improvisor; in jam sessions and experimental concerts he has shared the stage with Mauro Pawlowski, Zeitkratzer Ensemble (Germany), Marc Ribot (US), Pierre Bastien, Pierre Berthet, members of DAAU, Zita Swoon, among others.

As a former student at St-Lucas in Ghent, Rudy Trouvé is also famous for his artwork: figurative paintings and blow-ups which can be found on the record sleeves of most of his self-produced records and the bands he performed with. One of them was &quot;Worst Case Scenario&quot; by dEUS.

<text>The Battle of [[Fitjar]] (&quot;Slaget ved Fitjar på Stord&quot;) took place in 961 in Fitjar at Stord in the county of Hordaland, Norway.

==Battle and aftermath==
The Battle of Fitjar at Stord was the last battle in a war between the sons of Eric Bloodaxe and their uncle King Haakon the Good for power over Norway. It also formed part of a contest between Norway and Denmark to control the area of Oslofjord.

Erling Eiriksson, Sigurd Sleva and Harald Greycloak, three of the sons of Eric Bloodaxe (&quot;Eirikssønnene&quot;) landed unnoticed on Hordaland in 961 and surprised the king at Fitjar. The battle was won by the forces of King Haakon, but he was wounded in the battle and died soon after it. According to Fagrskinna and Heimskringla, the dying king, wishing to end the conflict, handed over his kingship and retinue (hird) to Harald Greycloak, sending a letter to that effect. 

After Haakon&#x27;s death, Harald Greycloak and his brothers became kings of Norway, but they had little authority outside western Norway. The third son of Eric Bloodaxe, Harald was the most powerful of the brothers by right of being the eldest surviving son. The succession issue was finally settled after Harald ascended the throne as Harald II of Norway. However, the Norwegians were severely tormented by years of war, and many were dissatisfied by the destruction of pagan shrines by the hands of the Christian sons of Eric. After the assassination of Harald II, Harald Bluetooth (Harald I of Denmark) managed to force the people of Norway into temporary subjection.

==Legacy==

In memory of Haakon, his follower the skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir composed the poem &quot;Hákonarmál&quot;. The poem tells of the battle, the king’s death, and how he is greeted by the gods in Valhalla.

At Håkonarparken in Fitjar, a statue of King Haakon serves as a memorial to the Battle of Fitjar. The coat-of-arms of the municipality of Fitjar show a golden helmet. This is derived from the fact that King Haakon wore a golden helmet at the Battle of Fitjar.

<text>A rift valley is a linear shaped lowland between several highlands or mountain ranges produced by the action of a geologic rift. Rifts are formed as a result of the pulling apart of the lithosphere due to extensional tectonics. The linear depression may subsequently be further deepened by the forces of erosion. More generally the valley is likely to be filled with sedimentary deposits derived from the rift flanks and the surrounding areas. In many cases rift lakes are formed. One of the best known examples of this process is the East African Rift. On Earth, rifts can occur at all elevations, from the sea floor to plateaus and mountain ranges in continental crust or in oceanic crust. They are often associated with a number of adjoining subsidiary or co-extensive valleys, which are typically considered part of the principal rift valley geologically.

==Earth&#x27;s rift valleys==
The most extensive rift valley is located along the crest of the mid-ocean ridge system and is the result of sea floor spreading. Examples of this type of rift include the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East Pacific Rise.

Many existing continental rift valleys are the result of a failed arm (aulacogen) of a triple junction, although there are three, the East African Rift, Rio Grande rift and the Baikal Rift Zone, which are currently active, as well as a fourth which may be, the West Antarctic Rift System. In these instances, not only the crust but entire tectonic plates are in the process of breaking apart forming new plates. If they continue, continental rifts will eventually become oceanic rifts.

Other rift valleys are the result of bends or discontinuities in horizontally-moving (strike-slip) faults. When these bends or discontinuities are in the same direction as the relative motions along the fault, extension occurs. For example, for a right lateral-moving fault, a bend to the right will result in stretching and consequent subsidence in the area of the irregularity. In the view of many geologists today, the Dead Sea lies in a rift which results from a leftward discontinuity in the left lateral-moving Dead Sea Transform fault. Where a fault breaks into two strands, or two faults run close to each other, crustal extension may also occur between them, as a result of differences in their motions. Both types of fault-caused extension commonly occur on a small scale, producing such features as sag ponds or landslides.

===Rift valley lakes===

Many of the world&#x27;s largest lakes are located in rift valleys. Lake Baikal in Siberia, a World Heritage Site, lies in an active rift valley. Baikal is both the deepest lake in the world and, with 20% of all of the liquid freshwater on earth, has the greatest volume. Lake Tanganyika, second by both measures, is in the &quot;Albertine Rift&quot;, the westernmost arm of the active East African Rift. Lake Superior in North America, the largest freshwater lake by area, lies in the ancient and dormant Midcontinent Rift. The largest subglacial lake, Lake Vostok, may also lie in an ancient rift valley. Lake Nipissing and Lake Timiskaming in Ontario and Quebec, Canada lie inside a rift valley called the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben. Þingvallavatn, Iceland&#x27;s largest natural lake, is also an example of a rift lake.

==Extraterrestrial rift valleys==
Rift valleys are also known to occur on other terrestrial planets and natural satellites. The 4,000 km long Valles Marineris on Mars is believed by planetary geologists to be a large rift system. Some features of Venus, most notably, the 4,000 km Devana Chasma and a part of the western Eistla, and possibly also Alta and Bell Regio have been interpreted by some planetary geologists as rift valleys. Some natural satellites also have prominent rift valleys. The 2,000 km long Ithaca Chasma on Tethys in the Saturn system is a prominent example. Charon&#x27;s Nostromo Chasma is the first confirmed in the Pluto system, however large chasms up to 950 km wide observed on Charon have also been tentatively interpreted by some as giant rifts, and similar formations have also been noted on Pluto. A recent study suggests a complex system of ancient lunar rift valleys, including Vallis Rheita and Vallis Alpes. The Uranus system also has prominent examples, with large &#x27;chasma&#x27; believed to be giant rift valley systems, most notably the 1492 km long Messina Chasma on Titania, 622 km Kachina Chasmata on Ariel, Verona Rupes on Miranda, and Mommur Chasma on Oberon.

<doc id="497008" wikidata="Q238452" url="?curid=497008" title="Arish">
<text>ʻArish or el-ʻArīsh ( &quot;&quot; ) is the capital and largest city of the North Sinai Governorate of Egypt, as well as the largest city on the Sinai Peninsula, lying on the Mediterranean coast northeast of Cairo and west of the Egypt–Gaza border. The population was 204,391 in 2023.

In antiquity and the Early Middle Ages, the city was known as [[Rhinocorura|Rinokoroura]] (, ).

ʻArīsh is located at the mouth of Wadi al-Arish, a long ephemeral watercourse. The Azzaraniq Protectorate is on the eastern side of ʻArīsh.

== Etymology ==
There are several hypothetical possibilities for the origin of the modern name of the city, which is first mentioned under it in the 9th century. One possibility is that the name might be an Arab phonetic transcription of a pre-existing toponym. However, there is no name that fully qualifies as such, apart from the Ariza () of Hierokles, which is difficult to interpret.

Another possibility is that the name el-Arish was given to a city that already existed in the Byzantine period. However, no Arab source mentions such a change of name for any city in the region, and there is no plausible explanation for this change.

A third possibility is that the name el-Arish was created when a new settlement of some &quot;huts&quot; () was established in the 7th or 8th century. It is possible that the city of Rinokoloura fell into ruins in the first half of the 7th century, and a new community arose that the new inhabitants started to call el-Arish, after their poor living conditions.

M. Ignace de Rossi derived the Arabic name from the Egyptian , an analogue of Greek Rinocorura.

A Coptic-Arabic colophon dating to 1616 mentions the writer &quot;Solomon of Shorpo, son of Michael, from the city of Mohonon&quot; (ⲥⲱⲗⲟⲙⲟⲛ ⲛϣⲱⲣⲡⲟ ⲡϣⲏⲣⲓ ⲙⲓⲭⲁⲏⲗ ⲛⲧⲉ ⲡⲟⲗⲓⲥ ⲙⲟϩⲟⲛⲟⲛ); in the Arabic version, the writer is identified as being &quot;of el-Arish&quot;. Timm raises the possibility that &quot;Shorpo&quot; () may be another name for el-Arish. 

== Geography ==
Arish is in the northern Sinai, about from the Rafah Border Crossing with the Gaza Strip. North Sinai is targeted by Egyptian government planners to divert population growth from the high-density Nile Delta. It is proposed that by completing infrastructure, transportation and irrigation projects, three million Egyptians may be settled in North Sinai.

&quot;Arish is considered part of Bilad al-Sham.
Arish is the closest city to Lake Bardawil.

=== Climate ===
Its Köppen climate classification is hot desert (BWh), although prevailing Mediterranean winds moderate its temperatures, typical to the rest of the northern coast of Egypt.

The highest record temperature was , recorded on May 29, 2003, while the lowest record temperature was , recorded on January 8, 1994.

== Transport ==
The city is served by el Arish International Airport. The Northern Coastal Highway runs from el-Qantarah at the Suez Canal through Arish to the Gaza border crossing at Rafah. The railway line from Cairo is under re-construction with formation works completed only as far as Bir al-Abed, west of Arish. The route was formerly part of the Palestine Railways built during World War I and World War II to connect Egypt with Turkey. The railway was cut during the formation of Israel.

The city is the site of a deep-water seaport capable of serving ships up to 30,000 tonnes, the only such port on the Sinai Peninsula. Its major exports are cement, sand, salt and marble. The Sinai White Cement Company plant is located south of the city.

==Education==
The city is home to Arish University.

== History ==
Herodotus describes a city named &quot;Ienysos&quot; () located between Lake Serbonis and Kadytis. It is possible that Ienysos is the predecessor of Rinokoloura, but there is no clear evidence to support this identification.

=== Foundation ===
The foundation of the city is closely linked to the etymology of its name. The explanation given by the classic authors is that it comes from a compound of &quot;nose&quot; () and &quot;curtail, cut short&quot; ().

Thus modern scholars, following the version given by Seneca, believe that in the 4th century BC, a Persian king, believed to be either Artaxerxes II or Artaxerxes III, conducted a campaign in Syria where he punished people, possibly a tribe, by mutilating their noses. As a result, the places where these people came from or relocated to were given new names that reflected their disfigurement. While the Greek name Rinokoloura may have existed from the outset, it is possible that it was a translation of a name with the same meaning in another language.

When the city became a part of the Ptolemaic Empire, an Egyptian tradition emerged that may have transformed the Persian king into an Ethiopian king named Actisanes. First mentioned by Diodorus, who based his information on the Aegyptiaca of Hecataeus of Abdera, written in the 4th century BC, Actisanes conquered Egypt during the reign of king Amasis. He governed Egypt with justice and benevolence, and instead of executing convicted criminals, he had their noses cut off and relocated them to a city at the desert&#x27;s edge, near the border between Egypt and Syria.

=== Antiquity ===
In Ptolemaic Egypt, Rinocoroura was considered the last city of Egypt, on the border with Coele-Syria. 

During the second invasion of Antiochus IV in the spring of 168 BCE, an embassy of Ptolemy VI met him near Rinokoloura, which in about 79 BCE came under the rule of the Judaean Kingdom of Alexander Jannaeus, while in 40 BCE, Herod I sought refuge in Rinokoloura on his way to Pelusium, where he received news of his brother&#x27;s death.

The Oxyrhynchus papyrus, traditionally referred to as &#x27;an invocation of Isis&#x27; or &#x27;a Greek Isis litany,&#x27; is believed to have been transcribed during the reigns of Trajan or Hadrian, but its composition dates back to the late 1st century. This text contains numerous invocations of Isis and mentions Rinokoloura, where she is called &#x27;all-seeing&#x27; ().

A number of funerary steles with a repeated consolation formula &quot;nobody is immortal&quot; () were found in and around the city.

The earliest reliable Christian reference to Rinokoloura can be found in Athanasius&#x27;s &quot;Epistula ad Serapionem&quot;, in which Salomon was appointed as bishop of Rinokoloura, possibly in 339 AD. Sozomen also refers to Rinokoloura in the mid-5th century AD, stating that the city was a center of scholarship, with a meditation school () located in the desert north of the city, a church illuminated by oil lamps, and an episcopal dwelling where the entire clergy of the city resided and dined together.

Hieronymus reported that in the early 5th century the inhabitants of Rinokoloura and other nearby cities spoke Syrian. However, as most of the epitaphs discovered in the area are written in Greek, and one is in Coptic, it is unclear which segment of the population Hieronymus was referring to.

According to John of Nikiu, in 610 AD the army of general Bonosos passed through Rinocoroura (mentioned under the corrupted name Bikuran) on its way to Athribis.

==== The Brook of Egypt ====
The story of Hesychios of Jerusalem reveals the existence of a wadi near Rinokoloura. In one instance, the Septuagint (Isaiah 27:12) translates &#x27;the brook of Egypt,&#x27; which designates the southern border of Israel, as Rinokoloura, suggesting that the translators were perhaps aware of a similar &#x27;brook&#x27; in the vicinity of the city. However, it appears that the association between Rinokoloura and the &#x27;brook of Egypt&#x27; may be due more to the contemporary political border between Egypt and Syria, which had shifted further southward since the 8th century AD.

=== After the Arab Conquest ===

In the Middle Ages, pilgrims misidentified the site as the Sukkot of the Bible. New fortifications were constructed at the original site by the Ottoman Empire in 1560. During the Napoleonic Wars, the French laid siege to the fort, which fell after 11 days on February 19, 1799. 

Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, proposed ʻArīsh as a Jewish homeland since neither Sultan Abdul Hamid II nor Kaiser Wilhelm II supported settlement in Palestine. In 1903, Joseph Chamberlain, the British colonial secretary, agreed to consider ʻArīsh, and Herzl commissioned the lawyer David Lloyd George a charter draft, but his application was turned down once an expedition, led by Leopold Kessler had returned and submitted a detailed report to Herzl, which outlined a proposal to divert some of the Nile waters to the area for the purpose of settlement.

During World War I, the fort was destroyed by British bombers. It was later the location of the 45th Stationary Hospital which treated casualties of the Palestine campaign. The remains of those who died there were later moved to Kantara Cemetery.

== Modern war and conflict ==

=== World Wars I and II ===
In December 1916, during World War I, the Anzac Mounted Division and other British Empire units captured the &#x27;Arish area from Ottoman forces. In Australia, the town of El Arish, Queensland was named in memory of this action. 

El-ʻArīsh Military Cemetery, designed by Robert Lorimer, was built in 1919 for Commonwealth personnel who died during World War I. It is one of several commonwealth war cemeteries in the region, including two in the Gaza Strip. 

A Royal Air Force airfield, known as RAF El Arish, was a base for air sea rescue and other operations, during World War II.

=== Israeli conquest 1948 to 1967 ===

ʻArīsh was briefly controlled by Israeli forces, during both the 1948 Palestine war and the 1956 Suez War. On December 8, 1958, there was an air battle between Egyptian and Israeli air forces over ʻArīsh. As a result of the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, &#x27;Arish was under Israeli occupation; it was returned to Egypt in 1979 after the signing of the Egypt–Israel peace treaty.

==== El Arish massacre ====
In 1967 there was a massacre of Egyptian prisoners of war by the Israeli Defense Forces during the Six Day War. According to the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, the Israeli Defense Forces massacred &quot;hundreds&quot; of Egyptian prisoners of war and wounded soldiers in the Sinai Peninsula, on 8 June 1967. Survivors alleged that approximately 400 wounded Egyptians were buried alive outside the captured El Arish International Airport, and that 150 prisoners in the mountains of the Sinai were run over by Israeli tanks.

In 1995, two graves holding the remains of 30 to 60 people, allegedly Egyptian soldiers killed after their surrender during the 1967 War, were found near Arish.

<doc id="497010" wikidata="Q17104010" url="?curid=497010" title="Reduced Shakespeare Company">
<text>The Reduced Shakespeare Company (RSC) is an American touring acting troupe that performs fast-paced, seemingly improvisational condensations of different topics. The company&#x27;s style has been described as &quot;New Vaudeville,&quot; combining both physical and verbal humor, as well as highbrow and lowbrow.

Known as the &quot;Bad Boys of Abridgment,&quot; the RSC has created ten stage shows: &quot;The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)&quot; in 1987, &quot;The Complete History of America (abridged)&quot; in 1992, &quot;The Bible: The Complete Word of God (abridged)&quot; in 1995, &quot;The Complete Millennium Musical (abridged)&quot; in 1998, &quot;All the Great Books (abridged)&quot; in 2002, &quot;Completely Hollywood (abridged)&quot; in 2005, &quot;The Complete World of Sports (abridged)&quot; in 2010, &quot;The Ultimate Christmas Show (abridged)&quot; in 2011, &quot;The Complete History of Comedy (abridged)&quot; in 2013 and &quot;William Shakespeare&#x27;s Long Lost First Play (abridged)&quot; in 2016. The company tours in the US and UK, and has performed in Belgium, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, China, Singapore, Barbados, Bermuda, Israel, Qatar and Ireland. The Reduced Shakespeare Company is also heard on NPR and the BBC.

==Formation and early years==
The company was founded in 1981 by Daniel Singer, who wrote a 25-minute, four-actor version of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, to be performed at the Renaissance Pleasure Faire in Novato, California. He cast himself as Polonius, Horatio, and Laertes; Jess Borgeson (now Jess Winfield) as the prince; Michael Fleming as Bernardo, Claudius, and the Ghost of Hamlet&#x27;s father; and Barbara Reinertson as Ophelia and Gertrude. When Reinertson broke her ankle three weeks into the run, Borgeson suggested that school chum Adam Long fill in for her in drag.

Borgeson returned to college in 1983 to pursue a degree in English literature, leaving Singer and Long to continue under the RSC banner. They penned a 20-minute version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, which they performed at Renaissance fairs, on street corners, beaches, and at private events. Crowds were amazed to see two men arrive with a small basket of costumes, two fencing foils, two bottles of poison, a rose, a dagger, a wig and a dummy, and proceed to enact the entire story with the zany style of a Marx Brothers movie.

Borgeson rejoined the troupe in 1985, and so Singer&#x27;s version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; was resurrected into the repertoire. Several actors had come and gone in the roles of Bernardo, the Ghost, and Claudius; the last in the series excused himself when his daughter was born. The three-man RSC was born at that time, with Long taking over those roles. In 1987, a friend of the company suggested that they&#x27;d find a welcome reception at the famous Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland. The ideal show length being about an hour, they decided they needed about 20 more minutes of material, and proposed doing Shakespeare&#x27;s other 35 plays to round out an abridgement of everything the bard wrote in less than one hour. Sa Thomson (now Sa Winfield), brought on to design and fabricate the troupe&#x27;s quick-change props and costumes, became a full partner in 1988, and also occasionally appeared as a performer with the troupe, most famously in the title role of the RSC&#x27;s incarnation as the Abbreviated Ballet Theatre for &quot;Lucinda, Wood Nymph of the Glade.&quot;

==Touring==
The Complete Works script that resulted from these collaborations successfully premiered in an open-framed barn at the Paramount Ranch in Agoura, adjacent to the site of the Southern California Renaissance Faire. It then moved to Edinburgh proper, being performed in a church basement at 10:30 a.m. for a three-week run to generally sold-out houses. After that, the show (expanded to 97 minutes) toured theatres and festivals around the world. In repertory with the RSC&#x27;s second show, &quot;The Complete History of America (abridged)&quot;, &quot;The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)&quot; ran for nine years at the Criterion Theatre, London West End, with the company&#x27;s third show, &quot;The Bible: The Complete Word of God (abridged),&quot; joining the line-up for the final three years of the London run.

Singer left the Company in 1989 and was replaced by Reed Martin; Borgeson left in 1992 and was replaced by Austin Tichenor. In 1993 Long, Martin and Tichenor wrote the company&#x27;s second play, &quot;The Complete History of America (abridged)&quot;. They followed this up with &quot;The Bible: The Complete Word of God (abridged)&quot; in 1995.
==Recordings==
In 1994 Tichenor, Long and Martin created a six-part radio series called &quot;The Reduced Shakespeare Radio Show&quot;. It was broadcast on the BBC World Service from May 11 to June 22, 1994. In 1994 they also produced &quot;The Ring Reduced&quot;, a half-hour version of Richard Wagner&#x27;s operatic Ring Cycle, as part of Channel 4&#x27;s Wagner season. In 1995, the RSC recorded &quot;The Reduced Shakespeare Company Christmas&quot;, a take on Christmas and other December-related holidays. For the turn of the century Martin and Tichenor wrote &quot;The Complete Millennium Musical (abridged)&quot; along with composer Nick Graham. A video version of &quot;The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (abridged)&quot; was released on DVD in 2001. Also in 2001, John Knox/Westminster Press published Martin and Tichenor&#x27;s comic, spiritual memoir entitled &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Sold.&quot;

In August 2005, at the Sebastiani Theatre in Sonoma, California, the Reduced Shakespeare Company recorded its second show on DVD, &quot;The Complete History of America (abridged)&quot;. Martin and Tichenor&#x27;s second book, &quot;Reduced Shakespeare: The Attention Impaired Reader&#x27;s Guide to the World&#x27;s Best Playwright (abridged)&quot; was published by Hyperion in 2006. &quot;The Reduced Shakespeare Company Podcast&quot; was also introduced in 2006. It is a free, weekly twenty-minute podcast available on iTunes, as well as on the Reduced Shakespeare Company website. The Reduced Shakespeare Company has been nominated for an Olivier Award in London, two Helen Hayes Awards, a Bay Area Theatre Critics Circle Award, and two Podcast Awards. The company won a Shorty Award for Outstanding Use of Twitter by a Cultural Institution in 2009. In 2010 Martin &amp; Tichenor reduced the first five season of the hit television series &quot;Lost&quot; into a comical ten minutes for Sky TV in Britain. They performed &quot;Lost Reduced&quot; along with Matt Rippy. It can be seen on YouTube.
==Other works==
Martin and Tichenor created the troupe&#x27;s fifth stage show &quot;All the Great Books (abridged)&quot; in 2002, followed by &quot;Completely Hollywood (abridged)&quot; in 2005. Both these shows toured extensively across the USA and Great Britain, including runs at the Kennedy Center and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. &quot;The Complete World of Sports (abridged)&quot; by Martin and Tichenor debuted 2010 and has also toured across the USA and Great Britain with runs at the New Victory Theater in New York City, the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, and the Arts Theatre in London. The RSC premiered &quot;The Ultimate Christmas (abridged)&quot; in 2011 at Merrimack Repertory Theatre in Lowell, MA and performed the show at San Diego Repertory Theatre in 2012. In November 2013 &quot;The Complete History of Comedy (abridged)&quot; premiered with a seven-week run at Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park, with a month-long run at Merrimack Repertory Theatre to follow beginning in April 2014.

 In January 2014, some controversy surrounded the announcement of a performance of &quot;The Bible: The Complete Word of God (abridged)&quot; in at a borough-owned theatre in Newtownabbey, Northern Ireland: a Newtownabbey Borough Councillor from the Democratic Unionist Party decried the shows blasphemous nature, saying &quot;I&#x27;d be calling for public pressure to have it pulled. My wife, councillor Audrey Ball, has recently been put on the artistic board&quot; and that &quot;Those against her strong beliefs better watch out.&quot; On January 23, 2014 the Newtownabbey Borough Council voted to cancel the performances. This decision led to tremendous public outcry and show support for the RSC from many sources including Richard Dawkins, Tim Minchin, the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and Amnesty International. As a result, the council reversed its decision on January 27 and the performances went on as originally scheduled and received a rave review from the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot;. The publicity surrounding these events led to a huge boost in ticket sales for the entire 2014 UK tour of the show.

The RSC premiered &quot;William Shakespeare&#x27;s Long Lost First Play (abridged)&quot; at the Folger Theatre in Washington DC in April/May 2016 to rave reviews, followed by the European premiere at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 2016.

==Records==
The RSC was listed in the 2017 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records for holding the Guinness record for the longest-running Shakespeare show in the West End with 3,744 performances between March 7, 1996 and April 3, 2005 at the Criterion Theatre; and for the highest theatrical performance, for their performance aboard an EasyJet flight from London to Verona on Shakespeare’s birthday in 2014.

<text>Kokoszki (; ; ) is a district of Gdańsk, Poland, located in the western part of the city.

==History==

As part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, Kokoszki was a private village of Polish nobility, administratively located in the Gdańsk County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship. Kiełpino Górne and Smęgorzyno which are part of the district had the same status, while Bysewo was a royal village of the Polish Crown.

During the Second World War it was a location of two German concentration camps: &quot;Danzig-Burggraben&quot; and &quot;Kokoschken&quot;, which were SS sub-camps (Außenlager) of the Stutthof concentration camp located east of Gdańsk.

Camp Danzig-Kokoschken operated from September 13, 1944 with prisoners from Poland, France, Netherlands, Lithuania, Latvia, Germany and Hungary, mostly of Jewish origin. The first transport brought about 500 women. Within several weeks the number grew to 1,600. In the winter of 1945 the Poles imprisoned by the Gestapo office in Danzig were sent in. The prisoners were kept in barracks from where they were transported every day by train to the &quot;Schichau-Werke&quot; shipyard, to work two 12-hour shifts building submarines and anti-raid shelters. The prisoners received rations of half-a-litre of watery soup and 250 grams of bread per day; not enough to sustain their ability to work. There was no proper clothes in winter. People died in great numbers as a result of epidemics, workplace accidents, and beatings by the guards. Archival material indicate that such treatment was common already at the end of 1944. Dead bodies were burned in a crematorium but also buried in mass graves at the cemetery in Saspe (Zaspa).

<doc id="497015" wikidata="Q7883883" url="?curid=497015" title="Underwater warfare">
<text>Underwater warfare, also known as undersea warfare or subsurface warfare, is naval warfare involving underwater vehicle or combat operations conducted underwater. It is one of the four operational areas of naval warfare, the others being surface warfare, aerial warfare, and information warfare. Underwater warfare includes:
*Actions by submarines actions, and anti-submarine warfare, i.e. warfare between submarines, other submarines and surface ships; combat airplanes and helicopters may also be engaged when launching special dive-bombs and torpedo-missiles against submarines;
*Underwater special operations, considering:
**Military diving sabotage against ships and ports.
**Anti-frogman techniques.
**Reconnaissance tasks.

==History==

In the 20th century underwater warfare was dominated by the submarine. They first came to prevalence during the First World War, when German U-boats attacked and sank many allied vessels, such as the sinking of the &quot;Lusitania&quot; in 1915. A similar scenario occurred during the Second World War, when German U-boats launched a prolonged campaign against Allied shipping, especially in the mid-Atlantic. Japanese submarines also played a minimal role on the Pacific front, and American submarines sank a total of 5.3 million tons of Axis shipping throughout the war, most of which was scored against the Japanese. In the 21st century unmanned underwater vehicles are coming to play a significant part in underwater warfare.

==Seabed warfare==

Seabed warfare is defined as &quot;operations to, from and across the ocean floor.&quot; In general the target of seabed warfare is infrastructure in place on the seabed such as power cables, telecom cables, or natural resource extraction systems.

<text>This is a list of current and former programmes broadcast on BBC Radio 4.

When it came into existence – on 30 September 1967 – Radio 4 inherited a great many continuing programme series which had been initiated prior to that date by its predecessor, the BBC Home Service (1939–1967), and in some cases even by stations which had preceded the Home Service. Such inherited programmes are included in the list.

The years indicated in brackets after programme titles refer to the dates, where known, of each programme&#x27;s first, subsequent, and final broadcasts – and, in cases where Radio 4 programmes began their run on stations other than the Home Service, the names of those originating stations are also shown.

Note that many of Radio 4&#x27;s past comedy and drama productions have been, and continue to be repeatedly rerun on Radio 4, as well as on the digital radio channel BBC Radio 4 Extra (previously BBC Radio 7).

<doc id="497025" wikidata="Q1001086" url="?curid=497025" title="Buddy system">
<text>The buddy system is a procedure in which two individuals, the &quot;buddies&quot;, operate together as a single unit so that they are able to monitor and help each other.
As per Merriam-Webster, the first known use of the phrase &quot;buddy system&quot; goes back to 1942. Webster goes on to define the buddy system as &quot;an arrangement in which two individuals are paired (as for mutual safety in a hazardous situation).”

==Advantages==
In adventurous or dangerous activities, where buddies are often required, the main benefit of the system is improved safety; each may be able to prevent the other from becoming a casualty or rescue the other in a crisis.

When this system is used as part of training or the induction of newcomers to an organization, the less experienced buddy learns more quickly from close and frequent contact with the experienced buddy than when operating alone.

==Organizations==
The buddy system is used in the United States Armed Forces, and referred to by various names in each branch (&quot;Wingmen&quot; in the Air Force, &quot;Battle Buddies&quot; in the Army, &quot;Shipmates&quot; in the Navy), as well as the Boy Scouts of America and the Girl Scouts of the USA.

It is also used by religious organizations like the LDS Church. Members on the mission form a companionship constituted by two or sometimes more missionaries, which are not allowed to be alone for two years: &quot;Stay Together. Never be alone. You must stay with your companion at all times.&quot;

The buddy system is used in new employee induction for assisting with the formalities in an organization. The period could be from a month to two months. The buddy helps in acclimatizing the new employee to the culture and day-to-day aspects of working, in a shorter period. The buddy helps the new employee to become knowledgeable about department practices and organizational culture in a shorter period. The purpose of assigning new employees with a buddy is to help welcome employees and reaffirms their decision to join the organization. It provides new employees with a reliable, motivated, single point of contact for their basic questions regarding their work experience. The buddy system is an effective method to provide support, monitor stress, and reinforce safety procedures.

The buddy system is also informally used by school-aged children, especially on field trips. Assigning each student a buddy provides an extra measure of safety and removes some of the burdens of keeping an eye on a large number of children in an unfamiliar environment from the supervising adults.

The buddy system encourages open and effective dialogue among peers and tends to break down social barriers with their classmates. It helps create a collaborative learning environment in which peers feel less hesitant to raise questions. This enables students to develop social networks and cross-cultural experiences. It provides effective support for the students who are at risk and lowers the attrition rate at the higher education level.

== Education ==

=== Benefits of a buddy system ===

A buddy system in a school is where a child gets paired with another child, usually one that is older and of higher abilities. A buddy system helps to promote friendship, better support of coursework, behavioral and social needs, and can foster a greater sense of belonging and a more inclusive school community. Students create friendships that enable both older and younger &quot;buddies&quot; to bond more closely with their school, increasing the likelihood of more positive school behavior and positive response towards learning for all students. The buddy system helps students starting at a new school have a welcoming experience from the very beginning. The older children learn to take on responsibility, while the younger children know that they have a fellow student they can confidently turn to for support.

Buddy systems in schools can have numerous benefits such as promoting an inclusive environment for all, better acceptance of differences, promoting better self-control, expansion of communicative interaction with peers, decrease in behavioral problems, and even personal maturation or growth in career aspirations.

The buddy system positively affects the culture of the school and it greatly affects the troubled student as well as the older buddy. The students learn and share from their peers and learn collaboratively. The students actively participate with each other and enjoy the informal setting and feel comfortable discussing with peers rather than a teacher. The opportunity for active participation, clearing doubts and discussions help students to continue with studies or activities with joy and creates a depth in the subject matter. The buddy system helps to increase self-confidence for all involved in the system and in the process helps build trust and co-operation within individuals. It benefits the buddies, buddy learner, school/university and the parents as well. The buddies involved also learn leadership skills and in turn can take up the role of buddy leader.

The buddy system helps in reducing the stress level of the learner. It reduces the levels of anxiety experienced by the students who struggle to engage with course material or with the school/university in general. &quot;When there&#x27;s a companion available, the physiological measure of stress—cortisol levels in the blood—can be alleviated somewhat&quot;, explains Jim Winslow, PhD, a specialist in behavioral neuroscience and pharmacology and head of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Intramural Research Program, Non-Human Primate Core.

Teachers at progressive schools collaborate to improve their students&#x27; learning—and their own. It gives independence to all students, and increases self-esteem and peer acceptance. Children become protectors of each other.

Christine Hogan states that the buddy system approach is highly appropriate for organizational behavior studies adding to the students&#x27; range of learning strategies. The technique not only works with peers of the same nation but has also proved to be of particular importance to foreign students.

=== Pairing types ===

There are numerous pairings styles: newly admitted students paired with older students, low achieving elementary school students paired with high achieving elementary school students; behaviorally challenged teenagers paired with adults; autistic children paired with non autistic children; severely disabled children paired with regular children; and even college students paired with post-bachelor students.

=== Metropolitan Nashville Peer Buddy Program ===

An example of a successful peer buddy system was in Nashville, Tennessee&#x27;s McGavock High School. Teachers were concerned with having a more inclusive environment for special education students. Not only were the specialized students excluded academically but there was social exclusion as well. This adversely affects specialized students when there is a need for them to later assimilate when out of high school. Students with disabilities were eating with their buddies and their friends, which resulted in the expansion of their circle of friendship and thus allowed for the special needs students to feel more normal and included. The program was so successful it was later adopted in the other 11 high schools of that district.

=== Buddy systems for mainstream students ===

There are more examples of buddy systems for developmentally challenged students than there are of students with normal development but with behavioral or academic needs. If a system can be implemented that can help autistic or behaviorally challenged children or children with intellectual disabilities, than similar buddy systems can be incorporated into mainstream classrooms to help aid students that have a hard time learning but who may not qualify for the special needs programs. Students with disabilities report feeling more included, able to start friendships and conversations, and these same benefits can be transferred over to students that have social problems but are not able to be in special needs programs. Similarly, a student who is struggling academically can be paired with someone more adept with certain subjects.

=== Implementation of buddy systems ===

Students that qualify for special needs services receive a lot of attention. For the students that do not qualify but might be struggling behaviorally and socially, then programs like these could potentially have similar benefits for them as well. Carolyn Hughes and Erik Carter promote a more ubiquitous peer buddy system in their book by laying out different strategies and benefits if schools were to include these systems in their curriculum. Examples they provide are: administrators assisting in the publication of the program, school counselors signing up students for a credit based buddy system course, general education teachers providing support for special needs students who might be in their classroom and having parents providing impetus and support for a program to begin. Carolyn Hughes and Erik Carter suggest starting on a smaller scale, perhaps a classroom or two and then growing a base of support.

=== Peer-to-peer buddy systems for students with autism ===

A key element of education is to build empathy and understand other people in the society. This approach sees a small group of students in a class being made &quot;buddies&quot; for an autistic student. The students are made aware of particular challenge a student has and are asked to take special care to include them, to be on the lookout for any bullying or exclusion and to be supportive to the student if they get stressed out or upset at break time or in class. The students who are selected would be chosen for their maturity and kindness. Parental consent would be sought from the parents of the students involved. While not every autistic student will instantly begin to socialise or make friends, this approach will at the very least ensure inclusion and also that there will be a friendly pair of eyes when teachers are not present or are out of ear-shot. For instance – maybe a student is having a bad day, is upset about something or just is not very good at starting conversations or making friends alone. Under this system, a class would explore difference as a whole and recognize that everyone in a class is different and so have different needs, strengths, abilities and oddities. They would then either be paired up or each student would draw a name and become &quot;buddy&quot; to that person, perhaps without them even being made aware of it. Before the draw or pairing it could be discussed with the teacher, to ensure an autistic student gets an especially strong buddy.
The advantage of this system is that it does not single out the autistic student, especially if they are not comfortable with that, and instead includes everyone. Additionally, it gives the autistic person a role in being a buddy too, which can be used to teach social skills, expectations and etiquette.

=== Quarreling in China ===

In Shandong University, the buddy system is aimed to help the International students and help Chinese students broaden their horizons.

However, the gender ratio and the proportion of the student system have caused controversy in mainland China. The first batch of buddies&#x27; gender ratio is 1 to 1, but in 2018 the third batch changed to &quot;141 Chinese students and 47 international students form 47 friendly &#x27;buddies&#x27; groups&quot;. The number of foreign students and local students has reached an astonishing 1:3, and the number of students enrolled in the school is overwhelming. The move caused a heated discussion among netizens on Weibo. Many netizens believed that this move proved that Shanda&#x27;s &quot;Chongyang Meiwai&quot; is essentially a &quot;pimping strip&quot;.

<doc id="497028" wikidata="Q4379618" url="?curid=497028" title="Buddy check">
<text>The buddy check is a procedure carried out by scuba divers using the buddy system where each dive buddy checks that the other&#x27;s diving equipment is configured and functioning correctly just before the start of the dive. A study of pre-dive equipment checks done by individual divers showed that divers often fail to recognize common equipment faults. By checking each other&#x27;s equipment as well as their own, it is thought to be more likely that these faults will be identified prior to the start of the dive. The correct use of a well designed written checklist is known to be more reliable, and is more likely to be used by professional divers, where it may be required by occupational health and safety legislation, and by technical divers, where the equipment checks are more complex.

The wide variety of types of buoyancy compensator, diving suits and types of scuba equipment means that it is important for each buddy to understand the other&#x27;s equipment configuration in case one has to help or rescue the other. The buddy check is a last minute opportunity to become familiar with the dive buddy&#x27;s equipment. Since many buddy pairings are arbitrarily assigned by the diveing service provider just before the dive, this may be the only time the buddy pair get to familiarise themselves with each other&#x27;s equipment.

Other systems are used by technical team divers and professional divers with the similar goal of ensuring that the divers are ready to safely enter the water. Professional divers may be required by organizational policy to use an itemised checklist.

==Purpose==
The basic buddy check is a pre-dive equipment check intended to reduce the risk of the diver entering the water with life-support equipment which has not been checked to be functioning correctly. The extended buddy checks include dive planning information sharing to improve the ability of the divers to co-operate usefully both during the planned dive and in case of a contingency, and may include a review of the current conditions and a basic risk assessment. Checklists have been shown to be highly effective at reducing operator error in several fields where the correct completion of a series of tasks is of critical importance. 

===Effectiveness===
Although generally not a written checklist, a simple buddy check can be effective in avoiding major problems due to failure to prepare critical equipment correctly. Effectiveness can vary depending on the completeness of the checks, and the attention given, and can be reduced by distractions, interruptions, and time pressure.

==Procedures==
There are several formats of buddy check, but almost all cover these four aspects:
*Checks on breathing apparatus function and breathing gas supply.
*Checks on buoyancy and weighting equipment.
*Checks on harness security and connectors, and quick release functions.
*Checks on hose routing, attachment and presence of auxiliary equipment: Mask, dive computer, knife etc.
Buddy checks may be extended to include aspects of dive planning, to ensure that the divers are agreed on the intended activity and contingency plans. When larger groups and more complex dive plans are involved this would be considered part of the dive briefing.
*Risk assessment update
*Emergency plans
*Contingency plans
*Dive plan, including planned activities, route, decompression if applicable, and who will lead.
To be effective, all safety critical items must be checked, and shown to be functional within specification, and preferably all items that could cause a premature termination of the dive if not set up correctly should be verified to be correct. This requires some attention by the diver to ensure that all the checks are done, particularly if the sequence is interrupted to make corrections. 

===Breathing apparatus checks===
*Adequate supply of breathing gases. (cylinder volume and pressure checks)
*Suitable type and quality of breathing gas. (correctly and unambiguously identified if applicable)
*Cylinders mounted securely and accessibly.
*Valves opened or closed as planned, accessible if applicable.
*Demand valves functioning correctly. (work of breathing low, no leaks or free-flows)
*Hose routing correct, no kinks or hoses trapped under other equipment, pressure gauges accessible.
*Demand valves secured correctly where applicable.

For rebreathers the list is longer and may include:
*Oxygen monitoring functioning if applicable.
*Prebreathing has been done to ensure scrubber function.
===Buoyancy and weighting equipment checks===
*Low pressure inflation hose secure and free of leaks.
*Operation of inflation and deflation valves to ensure that BCD can be filled and vented. 
*Oral inflation valve function.
*Dump valves function and accessible.
*Weight belts or weight pockets in place and have the correct weight to compensate for the diving suit and other equipment.
*Trim weights secured if applicable.
*Dry suit inflation hose connected if applicable, inflation valve functions without sticking.

===Harness security and release function checks===
*Scuba/BCD harness adjusted and secured, buckles accessible for quick release as applicable. Straps adjusted and lying flat.
*Weight belt secured, buckle accessible. Belt free to drop clear if ditched in an emergency. Integrated weight system pockets secure, accessible and free to ditch in an emergency. 
*Other equipment attached to the diver secure, accessible and can be removed if necessary.

===Presence and condition of required equipment===
*Diving suit fasteners done up correctly, Dry suit zipper closed, neck and wrist seals lying smooth and good fit.
*Mask (and snorkel if applicable)
*Fins
*Depth gauge and timer or dive computer. Computer set to correct gas if applicable.
*Diver&#x27;s knife or cutting implement secure and accessible.
*Compass, slate, cameras etc. secure.

==Mnemonics==
There are several mnemonics for the buddy check taught by the various training agencies. All have the intended function of ensuring that the pre-dive checks are done effectively. The equipment and procedures used by recreational divers tends to be much the same between agencies, but the mnemonics vary considerably, even in the number of groups listed, and the scope of the checks. No data on the relative effectiveness of these mnemonics has been published, and well designed written checklists have been shown experimentally to be consistently more reliable.

===BWRAF===
The Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) use the formula BWRAF to represent the following checks:

; B - BCD : Function of the BCD is tested by operating inflation and deflation valves to ensure that the BCD can be filled and can release air. Both oral and low pressure inflator valves are checked to ensure that the valves operate freely, do not stick, and the low pressure inflation hose is connected correctly. All dump valves are operated to verify that they open correctly and close automatically. Shoulder straps, cummerbund, waist belt, crotch strap and other harness components have no slack or twists, and are lying flat.

; W - Weights : If a weight belt is worn, the belt is checked for security and position, and that the buckle is positioned so that it can be released by the diver&#x27;s right hand. Weights on the belt should be secured to prevent sliding along the belt not and must be sufficient for the buoyancy of diver and equipment at the end of the dive, but not excessive at the start of the dive. If a weight harness is worn, or the BCD uses an integrated-weights system, the system is checked for correct assembly and function of clip release. A secondary check is to ensure that the buddy is familiar with the weight system of the diver being checked, and is able to operate it to ditch weights in an emergency. 

; R - Releases : The buddy will locate and check that all of the diver&#x27;s harness fasteners are properly secured and they know how to release them in an emergency. This includes the velcro waist band, shoulder clips, and where present, the chest and waist clip. It is recommended to touch and name each clip as it is checked, as this makes it less likely to miss one. The tank strap and clip can be checked by testing whether lifting the cylinder causes the strap to move.

; A - Air : The cylinder valve is checked to ensure that it is fully open. The practice of closing by a quarter-turn is recommended by some instructors as it leaves the valve easy to turn, which allows a quick check to ensure it is not closed. A fully open valve may be damaged if the cylinder is empty and someone tries to open it, thinking it is tightly closed, as may happen if the cylinder is empty. However, this practice has been widely discouraged, after several fatalities were attributed to divers mistakenly closing the valve and then opening a quarter turn. (This means that adequate airflow may be delivered at the surface, but restricted at depth due to increased air density.) After opening the valve, the demand valves are tested for function by drawing full breaths while monitoring the pressure gauge to ensure that the valve allows adequate gas flow. Both should breathe comfortably, and not &#x27;free-flow&#x27; when purged. Taste and smell of the air is assessed. Contaminated air is extremely dangerous under pressure, but can often be recognized through an unpleasant, often oily, taste or smell. The secondary regulator (the &#x27;octopus&#x27;) is confirmed to be attached in the triangle between the chin and the base of the ribs, and can be released easily, to ensure easy access for the buddy in the event of an emergency.

; F - Final Check : The final check ensures that hoses lead correctly and are clipped to the diver neatly, that the diver has fins, a mask, and any other accessories (cameras, reels, knife, compass, torch etc.) needed for the dive, and that these are secured to the diver, or are placed ready to be handed down once the diver is in the water.

PADI teach the mnemonic Begin With Review And Friend, but many divers have their own.

=== BAR ===
BAR is another acronym for the parts of a buddy check, used by the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC):

; B - Buoyancy : Test and demonstrate how each buoyancy device, such as a buoyancy compensator or dry suit is inflated or vented. It is important to test common failure modes, for example, that the device remains inflated when required and that the inflation stops when required. Rebreather divers may test the breathing loop to ensure that it does not leak under a positive internal pressure and negative internal pressure.

; A - Air : Test that each air source has its cylinder valve open, has sufficient gas, is functioning and has no taste. If the indicating needle of the contents gauge moves when the diver inhales that may indicate the cylinder valve is only partially open and may not provide enough gas at the higher ambient pressures at depth. An oily taste to the gas may indicate a contaminated gas fill. Some rebreather divers breathe from the loop for 2 or 3 minutes before entering the water, to check that the soda lime of the carbon dioxide scrubber is active, but this has been shown to be unreliable.

; R - Releases : Check how to operate the releases that can be used in an emergency to separate the diver from the weighting system, buoyancy compensator and scuba set.

===SEABAG===
The National Association of Underwater Instructors uses the acronym SEABAG to address all pre-dive preparations: The first part relates to dive and contingency planning, and the second part to the equipment checks

; S - Site : The site survey checks if the chosen site is acceptably diveable under the prevailing weather and tidal conditions, and whether currents or other local transient hazards are present. 

; E - Emergencies : The established emergency procedures and equipment are reviewed to ensure that they are appropriate for the prevailing conditions. This may include availability of emergency oxygen available and the route to the closest recompression chamber. 

; A - Activities : What is the purpose of the dive? Are there any special risks or concerns that must be addressed?

; B - Buoyancy : Buoyancy checks include negative and positive buoyancy control devices (this includes environmental suits and equipment), and knowing where the buddy&#x27;s weight and harness releases are in case they must be ditched.

; A - Air : Both buddies check each other&#x27;s first and second stages, confirm the locations of their octopuses, and proof check by breathing from each other&#x27;s equipment. Surface Air Consumption (SAC) rates and available breathing gas are confirmed.

; G - Gear : Other gear is checked.

===DIR equipment checks===
The equipment check is the DIR diving equivalent of a &quot;buddy check&quot; procedure. Before the dive, all members of the diving team in turn examine and announce to other team members the presence, configuration, functionality, place and form attachment of each item of their standardized diving equipment.

The complete dive plan review uses the mnemonic SADDDD:
*Sequence: Who leads, who follows, and the responsibilities of each member of the team. 
*Air: Turn pressure, decompression (&#x27;deco&#x27;), bailout deco.
*Distance: Planned penetration of a cave/ wreck, how far from boat/ shore, etc.
*Depth: Planned maximum and average depths of the dive.
*Direction
*Dive

In 2006, SADDDD was replaced within the Global Underwater Explorers organisation with GUE EDGE which stands for:
*G : Goal, dive objectives
*U : Unified team, team strategies 
*E : Equipment match
*E : Exposure, planned depth and time profile 
*D : Decompression strategies (planned profile and contingency plans) 
*G : Gas strategies (planned turn points, critical pressures) 
*E : Environmental issues

<text>Oliwa () (; ; ) is a northern district of the city of Gdańsk, Poland. From east it borders Przymorze and Żabianka, from the north Sopot and from the south with the districts of Strzyża, VII Dwór and Brętowo, while from the west with Matarnia and Osowa. It is known for its medieval monastery with the Oliwa Cathedral, the 1627 Battle of Oliwa and the 1660 Treaty of Oliva.

==Administration==
Oliwa is a part of the city of Gdańsk now in northern Poland. It is bordered on the east by the Bay of Gdańsk (Zatoka Gdańska), on the north by the town of Sopot, on the south by the boroughs of Wrzeszcz and Zaspa and on the west by the chain of hills and forest surrounding Gdańsk. Except for the &#x27;old city&#x27; Oliwa encompasses the boroughs of Polanki, Jelitkowo, Przymorze and Żabianka.

==Population and sites==
The population in 2004 was 19,824. The area is with a population density of . The landmark of Oliwa is the Cistercian-Cathedral complex with the Oliwa Cathedral, Baroque Abbot&#x27;s Palace, Adam Mickiewicz Park, botanical garden and old granaries. The complex is listed as a Historic Monument of Poland. The complex houses two branches of the National Museum in Gdańsk: the Department of Modern Art in the Abbot&#x27;s Palace and the Ethnographic Department in one of the historic granaries. Other sights of Oliwa include the observation tower at the Pachołek Hill, the Gdańsk Zoo.

The Hala Olivia indoor arena, home venue of the Stoczniowiec Gdańsk ice hockey team, is located in Oliwa.

==History==
===Oliwa abbey===
It is not exactly known when Oliwa was established. Archeological excavations suggest that the first settlement in this area was established in early Iron Age. The Cistercian Monks&#x27; tradition (unconfirmed by other sources) speaks of it as an early seat of power of the Pomeranian Princes. The name of this suspected burgh is unknown. 

The first mention of Oliwa dates to 1186 when the Cistercians established a monastery there. The Cistercian Monks named it &quot;Oliva&quot;, either derived from an older Slavic name or the biblical Mount of Olives or olive tree. The monks received a deed of ownership from Duke Sambor I of Pomerania in 1188. The deed encompassed a number of villages, including Oliwa which became a monastic village for long centuries to come. The village&#x27;s history is directly linked to the development of the monastery.

The village was raided by Old Prussians in 1224 (1226?) and 1234 (1236?) and by Teutonic Knights in 1246, 1247 and 1252. In 1308, the Polish coastal region was invaded by the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and in 1309 it was captured and occupied by the Teutonic Knights in 1309 after the Teutonic takeover of Gdańsk, however, Poland made attempts to regain the region. In 1350, the monastery suffered a fire. In 1433, there were incursions of Hussites during the Polish–Teutonic War of 1431–1435. In 1454, King Casimir IV Jagiellon reincorporated the territory to the Kingdom of Poland. The subsequent Thirteen Years&#x27; War ended in 1466 with a peace treaty, confirming the reincorporation of Oliwa to Poland. Oliwa was a private church village of the local monastery, administratively located in the Gdańsk County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship.

In 1588, 1653 and 1709 Oliwa was hit by epidemics. During the Polish–Swedish War of 1626–1629, Oliwa was invaded by Sweden in 1626, and the Battle of Oliwa was fought nearby in 1627, considered one of the greatest victories in the history of the Polish Navy. Oliwa was invaded by Sweden once again in 1656, and the Swedish war against Poland ended with the Treaty of Oliwa signed in the village in 1660. Oliwa was devastated once again during the War of the Polish Succession in 1733–1734.

As a result of the First Partition of Poland in 1772 Oliwa became part of Prussia, at that time it was inhabited by about 500 people and counting approximately 70 buildings. The Prussians confiscated all of the Cistercian Monks&#x27; possessions. The abbey prior received a salary and the monastery received financial reparations. In 1804 Oliva became an administrative headquarters for the surrounding villages and the administrator settled in the former abbey gatehouse.

===Modern history===

In 1807 the Napoleonic armies took the village over and set up a field hospital in the abbey. Napoleon stayed in one of the local estates. Oliva became part of the Free City of Danzig (Gdańsk) until 1813 when the Russians entered Oliva and once again used the abbey as a field hospital. In 1815 Oliwa was re-annexed by Prussia.

A period of relative calm ensued. In 1822 a paved road joining Oliva and Danzig (Gdańsk) was built. In 1831 the monastery was liquidated. The abbey became a Catholic parish and the former parish church was transferred to the local Evangelical Protestant community. The Oliva parish consisted of a number of small settlements from Zoppot (Sopot) to Danzig including today&#x27;s boroughs of Wrzeszcz, Zaspa, Nowy Port, Wysoka and Rynarzewo. The &quot;Dom Bramny&quot; underwent renovation in 1836 so as to be able to function as a modern administrative center. Gustav Schilling was nominated as the first Vogt (administrator of a number of villages) in 1852.

In 1864 the villages of Polanki and Schwabenthal (Dolina Radości) became part of Oliva, which by then numbered approximately 2,000 inhabitants. In 1867 a new &quot;Vogt&quot; is nominated i.e. Herman Tümmler. During his term Oliva gained a rail connection with Danzig (Gdańsk) and Köslin (Koszalin) in 1870. In 1873 a local enterprise Quistrop established a horse drawn tramline. The line met its demise in 1879 because it was not very profitable. In 1874 Oliva community leader became Georg Czachowski. During his term a number of paved roads joining the township with surrounding settlements were built and the number of inhabitants surpassed 4,000. Between 1885 and 1907 Oliva was headed by a number of administrators and slowly expanded in all directions, not in the least due to the continuing efforts in improving the infrastructure. The present-day separate districts of Jelitkowo, Przymorze and Żabianka were incorporated by Oliva in 1907. Jelitkowo became a center of leisure with bathhouses and a wooden pier. In the same year a gas factory was built. In 1911 Oliva received running water, although a sewage system was not installed until 1921. By 1910 there were more than 9000 inhabitants.

In 1910 Oliva celebrated the 250th anniversary of the Treaty of Oliva. In 1911 a Catholic school was established at today&#x27;s Cistercians&#x27; Street. The surrounding forest was enriched by a botanical garden in 1912. In 1913 another railway line was added, joining Oliva with the Kashubian town of Kościerzyna. After World War I and on the basis of the Treaty of Versailles the Free City of Danzig was established on November 15, 1920 under the protectorate of the League of Nations and Poland. The borders of the free city included Oliva; a part of the parish was however in Poland. In 1922, the former abbey church became a cathedral of a newly established Catholic diocese.

In 1921 Herbert Creutzburg was nominated as the mayor of Oliva. His term was disastrous. He wanted to open a casino styled on the Sopot casino (by then Sopot was a renowned seaside spa). He ruined the city funds and the losses amounted to 400,000 guilders. The losses were paid up by the city of Danzig which sped up the incorporation of Oliva by Danzig on July 1, 1926. The remainder of the twenties brought a lot of prosperity. A paint factory &quot;Daol&quot; and a chocolate factory &quot;Anglas&quot; were established. These still exist today, although under different names. The world-renowned Dr.Oetker company also established a factory in Oliva in the twenties. In 1926 a small Zoo and fur farm were established. The Zoo is today one of the largest in Poland. The most important event of 1926 were however the celebrations of the 750th anniversary of Oliwa. In 1927, a municipal museum was established at the monastery.

In the thirties the National-Socialist NSDAP was gaining strength in the free city. In 1930 the party numbered 500 in Danzig. In 1932 when Adolf Hitler made a stopover at the Zaspa airport he was greeted by 10,000 NSDAP members. In 1939 the square in front of the (then recently upgraded) Oliva cathedral was paved with granite slabs and was frequently used as a drill terrain for the Hitlerjugend. On August 23, 1939 Albert Forster was named head of state and took full control of the free city. A week later World War II started when the German cruiser Schleswig-Holstein attacked a small outpost on the Westerplatte. Polish activists including priests were arrested by the Germans who took over all the important control points and marched into Poland. Freie Stadt Danzig with Oliva, together with the Polish Pomeranian Voivodeship were annexed by Nazi Germany as Reichsgau Danzig-Westpreußen.

In March 1945 the advancing Red Army captured Oliwa and afterwards it became again part of Poland. During the postwar years Oliwa developed in tune with the rest of the city of Gdańsk.

The Kompleks Alchemia and Olivia Business Centre business parks are located in Oliwa.

==Education==
The main campus of the University of Gdańsk is located in Oliwa.

==Transport==
The Gdańsk Oliwa railway station is located in the district.

<doc id="497036" wikidata="Q1064061" url="?curid=497036" title="Charles Darrow">
<text>Charles Brace Darrow (August 10, 1889 – August 28, 1967) was an American board game designer who is controversially credited as the inventor of the board game &quot;Monopoly&quot; by Parker Brothers, the game&#x27;s publisher.

==Personal life==
Darrow was a domestic heater salesman from Germantown, a neighborhood in Philadelphia (the part of Germantown he lived in is now called Mount Airy) during the Great Depression. The house he lived in still stands at 40 Westview Street. While Darrow eventually sold his version of &quot;Monopoly&quot; to Parker Brothers, claiming it to be his own invention, modern historians credit Darrow as just one of the game&#x27;s final developers.

==&quot;Monopoly&quot;==
 

Monopoly is a board game which focuses on the acquisition of fictional real estate titles, with the incorporation of elements of chance. After losing his job at a sales company following the Stock Market Crash of 1929, Darrow worked at various odd jobs. Seeing his neighbors and acquaintances play a board game in which the object was to buy and sell property, he decided to publish his own version of the game, with the help of his first son, William, and his wife Esther. Darrow marketed his version of the game under the name &quot;Monopoly&quot;.

In truth, Darrow was just one of many people in the American Midwest and East Coast who had been playing a game of buying and trading property. The game&#x27;s direct ancestor was &quot;The Landlord&#x27;s Game&quot;, created by Elizabeth Magie. The game was used by college professors and their students, and another variant, called &quot;The Fascinating Game of Finance&quot;, was published in the Midwest in 1932. From there the game traveled back east, where it had remained popular in Pennsylvania, and became popular with a group of Quakers in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Darrow was taught to play the game by Charles Todd, who had played it in Atlantic City, where it had been customized with that city&#x27;s street and property names.

In 2004 the PBS program &quot;History Detectives&quot; investigated a game board owned by Ron Jarrell of Arden, Delaware, which had elements of both &quot;The Landlord&#x27;s Game&quot; and &quot;Monopoly&quot;. The investigators concluded that this game board had &quot;key elements in it that link the Landlord&#x27;s Game and the Monopoly Game together&quot;.

The Darrow family initially made their game sets on flexible, round pieces of oilcloth instead of rigid, square carton. Charles drew the designs of the properties with drafting pens, and his son and wife filled in the spaces with colors and made the title deed cards and Chance and Community Chest cards. On these early round boards, Darrow included some of the icons (actually designed for him by a hired graphic artist) that the later &quot;Monopoly&quot; made famous, such as the large red arrow for &quot;Go&quot;, the black locomotives on the railroad spaces, the faucet on &quot;Water Works&quot; and light bulb on &quot;Electric Company&quot; and the question marks on the &quot;Chance&quot; spaces. Darrow then secured a copyright for the game in 1933. The next known versions he produced had printed &quot;boards&quot; on oilcloth squares with hand colored details.

==Commercial sales==
By 1934, Darrow started having the game printed on cardboard, and sold copies in long white boxes to Wanamaker&#x27;s Department Store in Philadelphia. Later that year, Darrow showed his game first to Milton Bradley, who rejected it initially, and later to Parker Brothers.

Darrow reinvested money from the sales into smaller sets, sold in black cardboard boxes, with boards sold separately from the sets. After Darrow started to take orders from other Philadelphia department stores, Parker Brothers reconsidered buying the rights to the game.

Parker Brothers negotiated the rights to produce the game in large scale from Darrow. Darrow sought and received on the game in 1935, which Parker Brothers acquired. Within a year, 20,000 sets of the game were being produced every week. &quot;Monopoly&quot; became the best-selling board game in America that year, and it made Darrow the first millionaire game designer in history.

Parker Brothers also promoted Darrow as the sole inventor of the game, though later research has shown that Magie, Jesse Raiford, Ruth Hoskins, Louis and Ferdinand Thun, and Daniel Layman, among others, were responsible for manyor allof the game&#x27;s significant elements collectively. Darrow&#x27;s contribution was the visual appearance of the game and the iconic cartoon-like illustrations on the corner spaces. He also standardized the number of houses and hotels (32 and 12, although in his oilcloth version it was 42 and 10).

A posed photograph of and a credit to Charles B. Darrow appear on the Parker Brothers stock exchange game &quot;Bulls and Bears&quot; copyrighted in 1936. In this case, Darrow was used as a &quot;celebrity endorser&quot;, although he had not created the game.

==Later life and death==

In 1957, Darrow appeared as a mystery challenger on the TV panel show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;.

Darrow died on August 28, 1967, at his home in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

==Legacy==
In 1970, three years after Darrow&#x27;s death, Atlantic City placed a commemorative plaque in his honor on The Boardwalk near the corner of Park Place. In 1973 Ralph Anspach, an economics professor at San Francisco State University, produced &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot;, a game similar to &quot;Monopoly&quot;, for which Parker Brothers sued him. 

During the ten-year suit, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that Darrow had directly copied the rules (including the misspelling of Marven Gardens as &quot;Marvin Gardens&quot;) from the version Charles Todd had produced.

<text>Sheung Wan (Chinese: 上環) is an area in Hong Kong, located in the north-west of Hong Kong Island, between Central and Sai Ying Pun. Administratively, it is part of the Central and Western District. The name can be variously interpreted as &quot;Upper District&quot; (occupying relatively high ground compared to Central and Wan Chai), or &quot;Gateway District&quot; (perhaps a reference to the location where the British first entered and occupied Hong Kong).

==History==
Sheung Wan was one of the earliest settled places by the British, and belonged to the historical Victoria City. The site of the original occupation of Hong Kong Island by British forces in 1842 was at Possession Street, between Queen&#x27;s Road Central and Hollywood Road. A plaque to this effect can be found in Hollywood Road Park at the top of Possession Street. The foot of Possession Street, Possession Point, was at that time on the shoreline, but is now several hundred yards inland due to reclamation.

==Geography==
Sheung Wan is surrounded by Sai Ying Pun in the west, Central in the east, Victoria Harbour in the north and Victoria Peak in the south. Part of the Mid-Levels is located within Sheung Wan. The border between Central and Sheung Wan consists of the entire Castle Lane, the entire Aberdeen Street, the entire Wing Kut Street, the section of Des Voeux Road Central between Wing Kut Street and Wing Wo Street, the section of Wing Wo Street north of Des Voeux Road Central, the section of Connaught Road Central between Wing Wo Street and Rumsey Street, and the section of Rumsey Street from Connaught Road Central to the waterside. Garfield Mansion is in Sheung Wan while Green Field Court is in Central. The border&#x27;s location south of Seymour Road in the Mid-Levels is unknown.

==Features==

===The Sheung Wan Route===
The Sheung Wan Route is one part of Central and Western Heritage Trail designed by the Antiquities and Monuments Office and Leisure and Cultural Services Department. The route covers 35 historic buildings and sites in Sheung Wan.

==Streets==
Streets in Sheung Wan include:

* Aberdeen Street, marking the border with Central
* Bonham Strand and Bonham Strand West
* Bridges Street
* (). Named after Charles Saint George Cleverly, the 2nd Surveyor General of Hong Kong Government.
* Des Voeux Road Central and Des Voeux Road West
* Gough Street
* Hillier Street
* Hollywood Road (also in Central)
* Jervois Street
* Ladder Street and other ladder streets
* Man Wa Lane
* Morrison Street ()
* Possession Street
* Pound Lane, a ladder street
* Queen&#x27;s Road Central and Queen&#x27;s Road West

* Upper and Lower Lascar Row
* Wellington Street, Hong Kong (also in Central)
* Wing Lee Street
* Wing Sing Street
==Economy==
The head office of Wing On is in () in Sheung Wan.

==Education==
Sheung Wan is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 11. Within the school net are multiple aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money) and the following government schools: Bonham Road Government Primary School and (李陞小學).

Another school in the area is Discovery Montessori School, a Montessori-based school located at 3/F Mandarin Building, 43B Bonham Strand, Sheung Wan. Discovery Montessori School (DMS) is for children from 6 months to 6 years old, with programs including playgroup, nursery, and kindergarten.

Due to the high French expatriate population, the French International School of Hong Kong previously operated a Kindergarten campus in Shops 2-4 on the ground floor of Tung Fai Gardens () in Sheung Wan.

==Transport==

Sheung Wan is served by the Sheung Wan station, formerly the western terminus of the Island line of the MTR metro system. Kennedy Town became the new terminus of the Island on 28 December 2014.

Trams also run through Sheung Wan, and one of the tram termini, Western Market, is located at the junction of Des Voeux Road Central and Morrison Street near its namesake.

The Hong Kong–Macau Ferry Terminal in the Shun Tak Centre has ferries and helicopters to Macau and to several destinations in Mainland China.

Numerous bus routes run through Sheung Wan. Central (Macau Ferry) Bus Terminus, located next to the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal, is one of the largest bus termini on Hong Kong Island.

<doc id="497039" wikidata="Q14551923" url="?curid=497039" title="Oblique projection">
<text>Oblique projection is a simple type of technical drawing of graphical projection used for producing two-dimensional (2D) images of three-dimensional (3D) objects.

The objects are not in perspective and so do not correspond to any view of an object that can be obtained in practice, but the technique yields somewhat convincing and useful results.

Oblique projection is commonly used in technical drawing. The cavalier projection was used by French military artists in the 18th century to depict fortifications.

Oblique projection was used almost universally by Chinese artists from the 1st or 2nd centuries to the 18th century, especially to depict rectilinear objects such as houses.

Various graphical projection techniques can be used in computer graphics, including in Computer Aided Design (CAD), computer games, computer generated animations, and special effects used in movies.

== Overview ==


Oblique projection is a type of parallel projection:
* it projects an image by intersecting parallel rays (projectors)
* from the three-dimensional source object with the drawing surface (projection plane).
In both oblique projection and orthographic projection, parallel lines of the source object produce parallel lines in the projected image. The projectors in oblique projection intersect the projection plane at an oblique angle to produce the projected image, as opposed to the perpendicular angle used in orthographic projection.

Mathematically, the parallel projection of the point formula_1 on the formula_2-plane gives formula_3. The constants formula_4 and formula_5 uniquely specify a parallel projection. When formula_6, the projection is said to be &quot;orthographic&quot; or &quot;orthogonal&quot;. Otherwise, it is &quot;oblique&quot;. The constants formula_4 and formula_5 are not necessarily less than 1, and as a consequence lengths measured on an oblique projection may be either larger or shorter than they were in space. In a general oblique projection, spheres of the space are projected as ellipses on the drawing plane, and not as circles as they would appear from an orthogonal projection.

Oblique drawing is also the crudest &quot;3D&quot; drawing method but the easiest to master. One way to draw using an oblique view is to draw the side of the object in two dimensions, i.e. flat, and then draw the other sides at an angle of 45°, but instead of drawing the sides full size they are only drawn with half the depth creating &#x27;forced depth&#x27; – adding an element of realism to the object. Even with this &#x27;forced depth&#x27;, oblique drawings look very unconvincing to the eye. For this reason oblique is rarely used by professional designers or engineers.

==Oblique pictorial==
In an &quot;oblique pictorial&quot; drawing, the angles displayed among the axis, as well as the foreshortening factors (scale) are arbitrary.
More precisely, any given set of three coplanar segments originating from the same point may be construed as forming some oblique perspective of three sides of a cube. This result is known as Pohlke&#x27;s theorem, from the German mathematician Pohlke, who published it in the early 19th century.
The resulting distortions make the unsuitable for formal, working drawings. Nevertheless, the distortions are partially overcome by aligning one plane of the image parallel to the plane of projection. Doing so creates a true shape image of the chosen plane. 
This specific category of oblique projections, whereby lengths along the directions formula_9 and formula_10 are preserved, but lengths along direction formula_11 are drawn at angle using a reduction factor is very much in use for industrial drawings.
* &quot;Cavalier projection&quot; is the name of such a projection, where the length along the formula_11 axis remains unscaled.
* &quot;Cabinet projection&quot;, popular in furniture illustrations, is an example of such a technique, where in the receding axis is scaled to half-size (sometimes instead two-thirds the original).

==Cavalier projection==
In cavalier projection (sometimes cavalier perspective or high view point) a point of the object is represented by three coordinates, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot;. On the drawing, it is represented by only two coordinates, &quot;x″&quot; and &quot;y″&quot;. On the flat drawing, two axes, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;z&quot; on the figure, are perpendicular and the length on these axes are drawn with a 1:1 scale; it is thus similar to the dimetric projections, although it is not an axonometric projection, as the third axis, here &quot;y&quot;, is drawn in diagonal, making an arbitrary angle with the &quot;x″&quot; axis, usually 30 or 45°. The length of the third axis is not scaled.

It is very easy to draw, especially with pen and paper. It is thus often used when a figure must be drawn by hand, e.g. on a black board (lesson, oral examination).

The representation was initially used for military fortifications. In French, the &quot;cavalier&quot; (literally &quot;rider, horseman&quot;, see &quot;Cavalry&quot;) is an artificial hill behind the walls that allows sighting of the enemy above the walls. The cavalier perspective was the way the things were seen from this high point. Some also explain the name by the fact that it was the way a rider could see a small object on the ground from his horseback.

==Cabinet projection==
The term &quot;cabinet projection&quot; stems from its use in illustrations by the furniture industry. Like cavalier perspective, one face of the projected object is parallel to the viewing plane, and the third axis is projected as going off at an angle (typically or about ~63.4°). Unlike cavalier projection, where the third axis keeps its length, with cabinet projection the length of the receding lines is cut in half.

=== Mathematical formula ===
As a formula, if the plane facing the viewer is &quot;xy&quot;, and the receding axis is &quot;z&quot;, then a point &quot;P&quot; is projected like this:
:formula_13
Where formula_14 is the mentioned angle.

The transformation matrix is:
: formula_15

Alternatively one could remove one third from the leading arm projected off the starting face, thus giving the same result.

==Military projection==
In the &quot;military projection&quot;, the angles of the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;z&quot;-axis and &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; -axis are at 45°, meaning that the angle between the &quot;x&quot;-axis and the &quot;y&quot;-axis is 90°. That is, the &quot;xy&quot;-plane is not skewed. It is rotated over 45°, though.

==Examples==
Besides technical drawing and illustrations, video games (especially those preceding the advent of 3D games) also often use a form of oblique projection. Examples include &quot;SimCity&quot;, &quot;Ultima VII&quot;, &quot;Ultima Online&quot;, &quot;EarthBound&quot;, &quot;Paperboy&quot; and, more recently, &quot;Tibia&quot;.

<text>Start the Week is a discussion programme broadcast on BBC Radio 4 which began in April 1970. The current presenter is Tom Sutcliffe. The previous regular presenters were Richard Baker, Russell Harty, Melvyn Bragg, Jeremy Paxman and Andrew Marr.

It is broadcast (usually) live on Monday mornings between 9:02am and 9:45am, and repeated in a shortened, edited version at 9:30pm the same evening. Its guests typically come from the worlds of politics, journalism, science and the arts. Prior to Marr the programme had a number of regular secondary presenters including Ken Sykora, Kenneth Robinson (who began in 1971 during the Baker era), Rosie Boycott, Catherine Bennett and Lisa Jardine.

==History==
===Richard Baker (1970–1987)===
The original programme differed from its current form; for the first year or so it was entirely pre-recorded. Produced by Michael Ember, a flamboyant producer from the BBC Hungarian Service, the 1970 show was supposed to be intelligent banter on a weekly theme held together in a jocular fashion by Richard Baker, a well-known television newsreader. 

If that week contained Valentine&#x27;s Day, for example, the show would start with some hints as to proper behaviour for that day, a bit of history, then a tape recorded by Doug Crawford, a former pirate radio DJ, consisting of a montage of music, archive recordings, opinions recorded on the street and the like, presenting the public&#x27;s image of the day in question. 

After eight minutes or so, the programme returned to the live studio for anecdotes and discussion from a variety of guests. Regulars included Lance Percival, a satirist from TV shows of the time who sang the &quot;Start the Week&quot; intro theme as a topical calypso, cookery with Zena Skinner. 

The programme had a regular following but was thought to be too light-hearted and irreverent for 9.00am on Monday mornings by a new Director of Programmes.

===Russell Harty (1987–1988)===
The programme turned towards being a chat show during Harty&#x27;s year in the chair; Melvyn Bragg, a friend of Harty&#x27;s first appeared on the programme as a substitute presenter before illness led to Harty&#x27;s death in 1988.

===Melvyn Bragg (1988–1998)===
After Harty&#x27;s death, several presenters were tried out, including Kate Adie, Sue Lawley, George Melly and Melvyn Bragg. During Bragg&#x27;s tenure the programme gained &quot;a new reputation for &quot;gravitas&quot;&quot;; and also a larger audience, which by 1996 was &quot;at one to one and a half million, slightly more than the far more middle-brow programmes such as &quot;Midweek&quot;, &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; and &quot;Loose Ends&quot;, which occupy the slot on other days.&quot;

According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;rows, however innocuous some of them seemed at the time, have become a trademark under Bragg: among the most notable have been Ben Elton vs Brenda Maddox, Rosie Boycott and Bragg vs novelist Kathy Lette, Armistead Maupin vs Libby Purves, and Bragg himself vs (separately) Joan Smith, Michael Dobbs, William Cash, Tony Parsons and Jean Aitchison.

The programme&#x27;s prominence in Radio 4&#x27;s schedule meant that Bragg&#x27;s elevation to the House of Lords as a life peer necessitated Bragg&#x27;s relinquishing of an involvement in the programme.

===Jeremy Paxman (1998–2002)===

Paxman&#x27;s tenure was relatively short for a broadcaster of his stature because his aggressive style of interviewing was not considered compatible with the programme.

===Andrew Marr (2002–2020)===

Andrew Marr took over as the programme&#x27;s presenter in 2002. Occasional stand-in presenters in recent years have included David Baddiel and Sue MacGregor. In January 2013, Marr suffered a stroke and went on sabbatical from the show, though he did chair a one-off episode in November and several episodes in December 2013. He thereafter returned as the presenter of the show, but not on a full-time basis. Since 2013, he has alternated with various presenters, currently Tom Sutcliffe, Kirsty Wark, Adam Rutherford and Amol Rajan.

==Awards==
&quot;Start the Week&quot; won the Best Radio Programme category in the 1994 and 2005 Voice of the Listener &amp; Viewer Awards, and is only the second programme to win the award twice.

<doc id="497042" wikidata="Q165365" url="?curid=497042" title="CASA C-101 Aviojet">
<text>The CASA C-101 Aviojet is a low-wing single engine jet-powered advanced trainer and light attack aircraft designed and manufactured by Spanish aircraft company Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA).

The C-101 was developed in response to a Spanish Air Force requirement, which needed a replacement for the outdated Hispano Saeta. During 1975, CASA commenced work on what would become the C-101. In addition to its own design team, technical assistance was provided by Germany&#x27;s Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) and the United States&#x27; Northrop. In June 1977, the first of four prototypes performed the type&#x27;s maiden flight. The design was somewhat reminiscent of other jet trainers of the era, such as the BAE Hawk and the Alpha Jet, but was less aerodynamically sophisticated, being equipped with an unswept wing. Performance of the C-101 during flight testing was reported in excess of predictions.

On 17 March 1980, the first examples were introduced to operational service with the Spanish Air Force, which would be the principal customer for the C-101. The initial model possessed only a limited weapons capability, this attack capability was expanded upon later-built aircraft. Several models were exported to overseas operators; the C-101 has been adopted by the Chilean Air Force, Honduran Air Force and the Royal Jordanian Air Force. A final improved model, designated &quot;C-101DD&quot;, was demonstrated but did not find customers and thus it did not enter serial production. In addition to its use as a trainer aircraft, it has been used to perform aerobatics; in the latter context, it has been flown by the &quot;Patrulla Aguila&quot; aerobatics team. As of 2019, the C-101 remains in service in the Spanish Air Force and several other countries.

Early on in the 2010s there were talks about the replacement of the C-101. Finally, in 2020 it was decided that the C-101 would be replaced by the Pilatus PC-21 (24) and the Airbus Future Jet Trainer(50 - 55).

==Design and development==


The C-101 was designed in response to a Spanish Air Force requirement issued in 1975, calling for a new jet trainer to replace its aging fleet of Hispano HA-200s and Ha.220s. Akin to the majority of contemporary European jet trainers, it was also to have a limited attack capability. During 1972, Hispano had been absorbed by Spanish aircraft company Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA), who took an interest in the trainer requirement. During October 1975, CASA was awarded a development contract based upon their submission, requiring a pair of static airframes and four flight-capable prototypes to be built for testing purposes at a cost of 1,297 million pesetas ($22 million).

To develop the aircraft, CASA sought technical assistance from abroad. Both the German manufacturing conglomerate Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) and American defense company Northrop opted to participate in the venture; specifically, engineers at MBB worked on the design of the rear fuselage and tail section while Northrop&#x27;s team were responsible for the design of the aircraft&#x27;s wings and engine inlets. Out of these efforts, a relatively conventional design was developed; according to aviation author John C. Fredriksen, the principles of simplicity and economy were highly emphasised by the design, shunning high performance features.

In terms of its basic configuration, the C-101 is a low-mounted monoplane, with unswept wings. The cockpit, which was relatively spacious amongst its peers, accommodated a crew of two in a tandem seating; the seats were staggered to provide the instructor in the rear position with greater visibility. The fuselage provided considerable internal space, permitting the installation of various additional aviation or supplemental systems as to suit future requirements or other secondary roles. Foreseen secondary roles included ground attack, armed escort, photographic reconnaissance, and as an electronic countermeasures (ECM) platform.

The only unconventional feature of the aircraft was the presence of a large internal weapons bay located beneath the rear cockpit; this allowed for a wider variety of armament to be carried than the underwing hard points could accommodate; alternatively, this bay enabled the carriage of other equipment, including reconnaissance payloads. In addition to the weapons bay, both armaments and stores could be fitted upon six underwing hard points. The design was produced in a modular fashion, which eases both manufacture and maintenance activities. It was provisioned with a considerable endurance range as a result of the initial requirement having called for a self-deployment capability to the Canary Islands from the Spanish mainland.

The powerplant selected for the aircraft was the Honeywell TFE731-5-1J turbofan engine. This unit was actually a commercial engine that had been re-developed for military use. Even from an early stage of development, the TFE731 was viewed as a front runner for the aircraft. According to Fredriksen, it provided relatively favourable performance and a high level of fuel economy amongst its peers. Overall, the aircraft provided mainly favourable characteristics while remaining an affordable trainer in comparison to international competition.

==Operational history==
Although the first flight took place on 27 June 1977, the test flight phase, which included vibration, flutter and spin tests, did not commence until 17 April 1978. The prototype was flown in the Farnborough International Airshow during late July 1978. Performance was reportedly found to be better than anticipated by the designers. An initial order for 88 aircraft was placed by the Spanish Air Force; built as a dedicated trainer version, designated as &quot;C-101EB-01&quot; by CASA and &quot;E.25 Mirlo&quot; (&quot;Blackbird&quot;) by the air force. On 17 March 1980, the first aircraft entered service with the Spanish Air Force.

Shortly after this dedicated trainer model was introduced, the aircraft was followed in production by a combination attack/trainer variant. Equipped with an uprated engine, this variant was designated &quot;C-101BB-02&quot;. It was bought by numerous export customers, including Honduras, which bought four, and Chile, which bought four aircraft and parts for another eight to be assembled locally by ENAER. The Chilean BB-02s are designated &quot;T-36 Halcón&quot;.

In 1983, CASA flew a dedicated attack version, the &quot;C-101CC-02&quot;, which was again ordered by Chile. This time, only the prototype was built in Spain, with the remaining 22 machines built by ENAER. This variant featured yet another engine upgrade and increased fuel capacity; it has been designated &quot;A-36 Halcón&quot; (&quot;Falcon&quot;).

Sixteen similar aircraft, the &quot;C-101CC-04&quot; were sold to Jordan. During 2018, the last of these aircraft were phased out by the Royal Jordanian Air Force.

The final version of the C-101 to be developed, designated &quot;C-101DD&quot;, was first demonstrated by CASA during 1985. This model featured vastly improved avionics and featured systems such as a head-up display, HOTAS-cockpit, AN/ALR-66 radar warning receiver, chaff and flare countermeasures, as well as the capability to carry the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile; however, as of 2000 it had not attracted any orders.

Between 1990 and 1992, all Spanish Air Force C-101s received an extensive upgrade package which mainly focused on the aircraft&#x27;s navigation and armament systems.

<text>Chasewater is a reservoir located in the parish of Burntwood and the district of Lichfield in Staffordshire, England. Originally known as Norton Pool and Cannock Chase Reservoir, it was created as a canal feeder reservoir in 1797. The reservoir was created to directly supply the Wyrley and Essington Canal and maintain levels in the Birmingham Canal Network. During a period of great industrial growth in the Black Country region the maintenance of water levels in canal infrastructure was essential and Chasewater was in great demand. As canals became less essential for transport of goods during the mid-20th century, the reservoir diversified and became a popular public amenity with activities such as water-skiing, sailing, wakeboarding and cycling. Chasewater is the third largest reservoir by volume in the county of Staffordshire and the largest canal feeder reservoir in the West Midlands.

==History==
An act of Parliament, the Wyrley and Essington Canal Act 1794 (34 Geo. 3. c. 25), received royal assent on 28 March 1794, entitled &quot;An Act for extending the Wyrley and Essington Canal&quot;, this authorised a long extension, from Sneyd past Lichfield to Huddlesford Junction on the Coventry Canal, together with the raising of up to £115,000 to complete construction. As part of the act the Wyrley and Essington Canal Company were required to provide a water source to keep the new length of canal topped up.

A site in the Crane Brook Valley was selected to be dammed to create a reservoir which would provide water to the new stretch of canal. Excavations started in the valley floor in 1796 and were used to build earthwork dams along the eastern and western edges of the reservoir. A feeder channel to supply water to the canal was cut through from the eastern dam to the top of the locks at Ogley Hay to the south east.

The reservoir opened on 8 May 1797, however in June 1799 the eastern dam burst releasing a flood wave downstream along the Crane Brook Valley towards Shenstone, about 4.5 miles to the south east. The cause of the burst was not clear however it was likely that no overflow system was provided and a summer storm caused the dam to overtop and erode the earth embankment. The flood wave caused significant damage with roads and bridges destroyed, fields flooded and livestock killed. The canal company paid out compensation to all who had suffered losses and set about rebuilding the dam. The dam was rebuilt thicker and wider than previously with its inner faces lined with limestone. In the March 1800 the dam had been rebuilt by Thomas Dadford and the reservoir refilled. A watch house was built by the canal company with a full-time watchman to safeguard against any similar incidents in the future.
In 1840 ownership of the reservoir passed to Birmingham Canal Navigations after the company acquired the Wyrley and Essington Canal Company. During the mid-19th century the coal deposits beneath the reservoir and the surrounding area began to be mined on a large scale due to the Industrial Revolution. The landowner of the area, the Marquess of Anglesey planned to open pits near to the reservoir. The Anglesey Branch of the Wyrley and Essington Canal was constructed between 1848 and 1850 and made the existing feeder channel navigable. In 1849 the marquess opened the Hammerwich Colliery, located adjacent to the Anglesey Branch at the toe of the dam. After barely eight years of operation the colliery last drew coal in January 1857, as it became impossible to work due to the influx of sand and gravel caused by working too close to unconsolidated surface deposits. Many other collieries were opened at this time around the reservoir and continued to be mined into the 20th century.

After the opening of the South Staffordshire Railway Line in 1849 rail infrastructure serving the collieries around the reservoir began to expand. John Robinson McClean engineered the rail line linking the South Staffordshire Line to the Hammerwich and Uxbridge Collieries as well as the Norton Branch. McClean leased pits from the Marquess of Anglesey and formed the Cannock Chase Colliery Company in 1859. In 1871 the rail line linking the Norton Branch and the Uxbridge Colliery was built. This line, now used by Chasewater Railway, involved the building of a causeway across the Crane Brook valley at the western end of the reservoir. Subsidence in the 1890s led to the extension of the western embankment north to the railway causeway and Norton East Road. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the eastern dam was raised, with this a new hexagonal valve house and weir was built and the capacity of the reservoir was increased. The increased capacity of the reservoir created Jeffries Swag at the western end of the reservoir.

Under the terms of an act of Parliament authoring abandonment obtained in 1954, most of the branches of the original Wyrley and Essington Canal were closed, including the branch from Ogley to Huddlesford, which was abandoned in 1955. The closing of this section of canal reduced the demand for water from Chasewater. On 21 Oct 1957 the reservoir was purchased by Brownhills Urban District Council from the British Transport Commission for £5,600 and the reservoir was renamed Chasewater.

During the mid-20th century the majority of mines were closed around Chasewater and the area was becoming increasingly used for leisure purposes. In the early 1950s sailing dinghies were the first to arrive, subsequently speedboats joined them a little further up the shore. By the early 1960s the sailing club moved to its present position and a funfair etc. was set up on the south shore, in 1961 the pier and the castle were built along the south shore. The 1960s saw the final rail traffic passing over the causeway and the final coal barge leaving Anglesey Basin. In 1984 a Chasewater Master Plan and Development Strategy was published, which recognised the nature conservation value of Chasewater and the surrounding land. In 1994 Lichfield District Council became responsible for management of Chasewater and the site became a country park in 1998. Continued investment in the nature and leisure value at Chasewater led to the building of the £1.9 million Forest of Mercia Innovation Centre in 2000 and the restoration of the Chasewater Railway as a heritage line. Following an inspection in 2006 it was discovered that remedial works were needed to the eastern dam. As a result of this the reservoir was drawn down in spring 2010 for works to be complete by spring 2012. In May 2011 Staffordshire County Council took over ownership of the reservoir to ensure completion of the remedial works.

==Dam and reservoir==

Chasewater reservoir is retained by two earth embankment dams. The main eastern dam runs north-south along the eastern side of the reservoir and is long with a maximum height of , a crest width of and maximum width at its base of . The secondary western dam is a continuous embankment along the western side of the reservoir and is long with a maximum height of .

The eastern dam was constructed between 1796 and 1797 across the Crane Brook valley damming Crane Brook; a tributary of the River Tame. The dam was constructed with the boulder clay and alluvium excavated from the reservoir bed. Later additions to the dam are formed with colliery waste from mining activity in the area. The overflow level of the dam was raised in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to increase the capacity of the reservoir. The dam was raised by approximately , a new bridge was built across the outflow basin above the old one, a new valve house was constructed on the raised crest and a wave wall was built along the crest.

The western dam stretches from approximately north of Brownhills West station to Norton East Road. The embankment dams the headwaters of streams which formerly flowed westwards to discharge into the River Penk. The dam was constructed between 1796 and 1797 with excavated materials from the reservoir bed, however it was extended northwards in the 1890s to counteract the settlement of the land due to mining subsidence. The extended section of the dam was formed with tipped material containing burnt clay and a core of clay puddle. South of the railway causeway the dam was widened when the area was landscaped using colliery waste as fill, it now does not resemble a dam although it still acts as one. The extension of the western dam allowed the overflow to be raised on the eastern dam in the late 19th century. This increased the capacity of the reservoir and created Jeffries Swag on the north side of the railway causeway.

The reservoir has a capacity of 4,400,000m3 (4.4 billion litres) and a surface area of 1.08 km2 (270 acres) with a maximum water depth of near its eastern end. Chasewater is the third largest reservoir in Staffordshire by capacity and second by surface area.

==Flora and fauna==
The Chasewater habitat supports several rare plant and animal species including: floating water-plantain (&quot;Luronium natans&quot;), round-leaved wintergreen (&quot;Pyrola rotundifolia&quot;), the carnivorous round-leaved sundew (&quot;Drosera rotundifolia&quot;), adder&#x27;s tongue (&quot;Ophioglossum&quot;), black spleenwort (&quot;Asplenium adiantum-nigrum&quot;), goldeneye duck (&quot;Bucephala&quot;) and tufted duck (&quot;Aythya fuligula&quot;)

==Today==

The surrounding area is designated as a country park. The reservoir hosts a variety of activities including water skiing, sailing, angling and bird watching. Running around Chasewater is the Chasewater Railway.

The large house situated halfway along the dam wall was originally the weir master&#x27;s cottage. The weir master would walk up to the hexagonal valve house, constructed to the same design as BCN tollhouses, and operate the gate valves to release water from Chasewater reservoir into the canal. The construction of the M6 Toll between the reservoir and the A5 required the construction of a new bridge over the motorway to access the southern side of the lake, where an Innovation Centre provides enhanced access to the waterfront. Selling land for motorway construction also allowed the Chasewater Railway to construct new premises and a large engine shed on the lake side.

In June 2019, a parkrun (a free, weekly timed 5 km run/walk) event started at Chasewater, taking place every Saturday morning at 9am.

==Dam repair==

Following an inspection in 2006 and further investigations in the years that followed, it was decided that maintenance works were needed to the eastern dam. The threats to the dam included internal erosion and overtopping of the dam during a storm event. Lichfield District Council appointed Galliford Try as principal contractor for works to start in December 2010. In May 2011 ownership of the reservoir passed to Staffordshire County Council to ensure successful completion of the works. The county council maintained the principal contractor and appointed civil engineers, URS to complete the works.

The water level in the reservoir was lowered by from February to April in 2010, in order for the works to be carried out on the eastern dam. To reduce the risk of internal erosion filters were installed at the downstream toe of the embankment to control and monitor seepage through the dam. To meet regulations the reservoir has to be able to withstand a 1 in 10,000-year storm event. To increase the overflow capacity culverts were installed through the causeway carrying Chasewater Railway, this was to increase water flows from Jeffries Swag into the main body of the reservoir. A new bridge, weir and spillway were built at the southeastern end of the reservoir. The drawdown culvert which runs from the reservoir bed to the canal was inspected and restored for the first time in 200 years. The £5.5 million repairs were completed in April 2012.

When the water was lowered, two suspected bombs were discovered on the reservoir bed, these were later determined to be mortar rounds dating from the Second World War.

<text>Hans Eichel (born 24 December 1941) is a German politician (SPD) and the co-founder of the G20, or &quot;Group of Twenty&quot;, an international forum for the governments and central bank governors of twenty developed and developing nations to discuss policy issues pertaining to the promotion of international financial stability.

He was Germany&#x27;s Minister of Finance between 1999 and 2005.
Eichel was chairman of the G7 in 1999 and chairman of the G20 in 2004. Before that, Eichel served as the 6th Minister President of Hesse from 1991 to 1999 and as the 52nd President of the Bundesrat in 1998/99.

During his time in office, Eichel played a very important role in two landmark reforms – the far reaching reform of German society and economy (also known as Agenda 2010) and the creation of the G-20 to reflect the rebalancing of world power. Some argue that Agenda 2010 helped turn Germany from the &#x27;sick man of Europe&#x27; into the best performing major Western economy in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. While some parties regarded it as the most successful economic reforms in Germany in over half a century, as well as in any G7 country in 30 years, it also created massive controversy and protests. The effects of the Agenda 2010 on German economic development remain disputed.

As chairman of the G7, Eichel initiated the creation of the G20 together with then US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and hosted its inaugural meeting in Berlin. The G20 rapidly grew to become the most influential economic body in the world. Eichel went on to serve as chairman of the G20 in 2004, when he pressed for the reforming of the international financial architecture and establishing a code of conduct on preventing financial crises.

==Early life and education==
Eichel was brought up in Kassel where he did his Abitur in 1961. He then completed a degree in German, philosophy, political science, history and education at the universities of Marburg and Berlin, graduating in 1970. After that, he worked as a teacher for five years in a Kassel Gymnasium, the Wilhelmsgymnasium, before winning election as the mayor of Kassel at age 33.

==Political career==
===Career in local politics===
In his early days, Eichel was known for his campaigns for green causes and against nuclear weapons but for most of his political career, he became associated with stimulating investment and creating jobs. He was noted for his consensus building skills and an ability to mix pragmatism with a mastery of detail. Eichel believed strongly in European federation and on merging Europe&#x27;s armies and foreign services, and on giving them a single foreign minister. He argued that Europe would be very much stronger if it spoke to the outside world with one voice.

From 1975 to 1991, Eichel served as mayor of Kassel, initially gaining the office at the age of only 33. 

===Minister-President of Hesse, 1991–1999===
From 1991 to 1999, Eichel was the Minister-President of Hesse in a coalition government with the Green Party. The coalition won again four years later and was the first red-green coalition to serve two consecutive terms. Eichel also served as President of the Bundesrat from November 1998 to April 1999. However, he unexpectedly lost the 1999 state elections to Roland Koch&#x27;s CDU and lost his office.

===Minister of Finance, 1999–2005===
In March 1999, Oskar Lafontaine resigned as Minister of Finance in the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, and Eichel replaced him a month later. He served as a member of the Bundestag from 2002 to 2009.

At the beginning of his term, Eichel tried to decrease the German federal deficit and wanted a balanced budget until 2006. Initially he was successful and earned the nickname Iron Hans or Iron Minister because of his ability to exercise strict budget discipline. &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine&#x27;s description of him:

&quot;It was Mr Eichel who achieved Germany&#x27;s biggest tax cuts in half a century, preached a fierce austerity, and stuck rigidly to a policy of squeezing the budget. For two years after taking over as finance minister in 1999 from the left-wing, fiscally extravagant Oskar Lafontaine, Mr Eichel was the government&#x27;s star. Despite his penchant for spending cuts, he was widely admired for his integrity, courage, and unwavering loyalty to Chancellor Gerhard Schröder&quot;

Despite initial success, due to constraints by the cabinet and by the worsening economic situation after the short boom in 1999/2000, he had to abandon those plans. After the election Eichel had to recalculate the budget due to the deteriorating economy and found that he would have $18 billion less in tax revenue than was anticipated. The German budget deficit was 3.8%, exceeding the 3% ceiling set by the EU&#x27;s Stability Pact. Until 2005, when he stepped down, Eichel did not reduce the deficit to under the 3% stability threshold, mainly due to the decision from Chancellor Schroder to not force excessive austerity on the German people on top of the deep economic reforms taking place.

Toward the end of his term, in late 2004, Eichel and U.S. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow worked out a proposal to cancel 80 percent, or about $33 billion, of the debt owed by Iraq to a group of creditor nations known as the Paris Club, capping an American effort for debt forgiveness.

===Controversy===
Eichel had a public spat in 2003 with then International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Horst Köhler, accusing Köhler and the IMF of being too harsh on Germany and too soft on the risks and policy failures of the United States. Köhler defended the harsh criticism of Germany and rejected the notion that the IMF was too soft on the US. However, experts pointed out in 2003 that there was growing evidence that the IMF was reluctant to explore the more problematic aspects of American economic and financial policies such as the concentration of derivative risks at a few big US financial institutions and early warning signs of the building up of risks in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The public and global sentiment in 2003 was against Eichel as Germany was then viewed as the &#x27;sick man of Europe&#x27; but consequently, the developments of the global financial crisis radiating out of the US, happening in parallel with the renaissance of the German economy, would suggest that Eichel was in the right.

After the tax reforms of 2001 and 2002, the German banking industry association sent Eichel&#x27;s internal revenue ministry three letters in total in late 2002 and early 2003 warning about a tax loophole allowing investors to receive more than one tax reimbursement for a single short transaction. Depending on how many times investors short sold a share in a period of 48 hours after a dividend disbursement, tax refunds were erroneously paid out up to four or five times for that single short-sell transaction. Eichel&#x27;s ministry took no corrective action in response, and from that time forward, gradually larger and larger amounts of forfeited tax revenue resulted.

===G-20===
The G-20 was created in 1999 in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis as a forum for cooperation and consultation on matters pertaining to the international financial system.

According to senior researchers at the Brookings Institution, the G-20 was founded at the initiative of Eichel, then German finance minister who was also concurrently chair of the G-7. Other sources identify Hans Eichel, US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin as the three key initiators.

According to University of Toronto professor John Kirton, the membership of the G-20 was decided by Eichel&#x27;s assistant Caio Koch-Weser and Summers&#x27; assistant Timothy Geithner. In Kirton&#x27;s book &#x27;G20 Governance for a Globalised World&#x27;,

&quot;Geithner and Koch-Weser went down the list of countries saying, Canada in, Spain out, South Africa in, Nigeria and Egypt out, and so on; they sent their list to the other G7 finance ministries; and the invitations to the first meeting went out.&quot;

The group was formally inaugurated in September 1999, Canadian finance minister Paul Martin was chosen to be the first chairman and German finance minister Hans Eichel hosted the first G-20 meeting of finance ministers in December 1999 in Berlin.

==Other activities==
Eichel currently leads the expert group on sustainable structural development for the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, the world&#x27;s oldest and largest foundation to promote democracy and political education.

In addition, Eichel has been holding various paid and unpaid positions since leaving active politics, including the following:

<text>Claude Berri (; 1 July 1934 – 12 January 2009) was a French film director, writer, producer, actor and distributor.

==Early life==
Born Claude Beri Langmann in Paris, Berri was the son of Jewish immigrant parents. His mother, Beila (née Bercu), was from Romania, and his father, Hirsch Langmann, was a furrier from Poland. His sister was the screenwriter and editor Arlette Langmann.

==Career==
Berri won the &quot;Best Film&quot; BAFTA for &quot;Jean de Florette&quot;, and was also nominated for twelve César Awards, though he never won. Berri also won the Oscar for Best Short Film for &quot;Le Poulet&quot; at the 38th Academy Awards in 1966, and produced Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Tess&quot; which was nominated for Best Picture in 1981.

Internationally, however, two films in 1986 overshadow all his other achievements. &quot;Jean de Florette&quot; and its sequel &quot;Manon des Sources&quot; were huge hits. In 1991, his film &quot;Uranus&quot; was entered into the 41st Berlin International Film Festival. Six years later, his film &quot;Lucie Aubrac&quot; was entered into the 47th Berlin International Film Festival.

In 2003, he was elected President of the Cinémathèque Française where he obtained enough state subsidies to cover the costs of its resurgence at its new site in the rue de Bercy.

==Personal life==
Berri&#x27;s wife, Anne-Marie Rassam, committed suicide in 1997, jumping from the apartment of Isabelle Adjani&#x27;s mother. Berri and Rassam had two children: actor Julien Rassam and actor and film producer Thomas Langmann.

==Death==
Berri died of a stroke, in Paris, aged 74. After his death, a group of nine works by Robert Ryman, Ad Reinhardt, Giorgio Morandi, Richard Serra and Lucio Fontana was promised to the Centre Pompidou in Paris in lieu of tax. But the heirs of the film director finally sold them through French art dealer Philippe Ségalot for about €50 million to Qatar.

<doc id="497052" wikidata="Q2701266" url="?curid=497052" title="Petaling District">
<text>The Petaling District is a district located in the heart of Selangor in Malaysia. Petaling is not to be confused with the city of Petaling Jaya located in it, nor the &quot;mukim&quot; of Petaling under Subang Jaya City. The district office is located in Subang.

The district of Petaling was established on 1 February 1974, the same day Kuala Lumpur was declared a Federal Territory. This district is located in the middle of the Klang Valley adjacent to the capital and thus has experienced tremendous urbanisation. Some of the original forests remain in the Bukit Cherakah Forest Reserve (including the National Botanic Gardens), Kota Damansara Community Forest Park and Bukit Gasing. During the 1991 census, it recorded 633,165 people.

The official 2010 census recorded the population of Petaling as 1,660,869 people, excluding foreigners. Petaling is 484.32 km2 in area. The urban centres are divided into the cities of Shah Alam, Petaling Jaya and Subang Jaya. However, there are numerous town subdivisions, old subdistrict administrations (mukim), all of which share the same names like Damansara, Subang, and Petaling, which add much to the administrative confusion along with the rapid growth. Some five types of subdivisions exist for Petaling District, namely the re-organized municipal council majlis, the majlis subdivisions, the community names (also known as townships), electoral constituencies, and the subdivisions (&quot;mukim&quot;).

It is host to many thriving townships such as the Damansara area, which hosts several shopping malls including a Tesco and an IKEA outlet. Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport is situated in Subang.

==Population==

The following is based on Department of Statistics Malaysia 2010 census.
==Administrative divisions==

Petaling District is divided into 4 &quot;mukims&quot;. It was formed in 1974 by incorporating mukim Bukit Raja and Damansara (Klang District) with mukim Sungai Buloh and Petaling which was part of Kuala Lumpur district. However, this definition is for historic administrative purposes only and does not reflect the modern rapid growth and subsequent reorganisation in 1997.

===Government===

The district is highly urbanised, and as such, the administration and maintenance of the public facilities in the district have been divided and delegated to the three local governments.

Shah Alam City Council

The Shah Alam City Council (MBSA) governs the city centre of Shah Alam. It also exercises jurisdiction over some parts of the south of Klang District, Bukit Raja, Setia Alam, Subang and Sungai Buloh area.

Petaling Jaya City Council

The city council (MBPJ) administers the area of the city of Petaling Jaya which includes Damansara (Petaling Jaya Utara, PJU), Petaling Jaya centre and most of Petaling Jaya Selatan (PJS) except PJS7/PJS9/PJS11 (commonly known as Bandar Sunway) which is partially jurisdictional and postcode allocated for location purposes, and SS12-SS19 which previously administrates under MBPJ previous incarnation Petaling Jaya Municipal Council (MPPJ), transferred the administration power to Subang Jaya Municipal Council (MPSJ) on 1997, the same year MPSJ was upgraded from Petaling District Council.

Subang Jaya City Council

The city council governs the southern parts of the district with the main populated areas such as Subang Jaya, UEP Subang Jaya (USJ), Putra Heights, Batu Tiga, parts of Puchong and Seri Kembangan under its jurisdiction.

<doc id="497054" wikidata="Q6589790" url="?curid=497054" title="List of bus routes in Melbourne">
<text>This is a list of bus routes that are part of the bus network, in Melbourne, Australia, which is overseen by Public Transport Victoria.

Kinetic Melbourne operate approximately 30% of the bus network, signing contracts in 2021 as part of the Melbourne Metropolitan Bus Franchise. The remaining 70% of the network is operated under 23 contracts with other bus operators, all of these contracts were entered into in mid-2018 and will expire in 2025 or 2028.

==Route numbering scheme==
The route number of buses in Melbourne can tell a little about the route&#x27;s operator, area served and even its history.

Route numbering was a reflection of the designated zonal area used during the 1980s. Areas were referred to as &quot;Neighbourhood Zones&quot;. However, as part of the &quot;Grow or Go&quot; policies, route numbers across the bus network were affected. There are no two-digit route numbers – these are used exclusively by trams.

*150–199, 400–899: These routes are run by private companies. Most are found in the middle and outer suburbs, where they provide feeders to railway stations and provide local travel.
*200–399: These routes were former government-run routes (Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board and then MetBus). They are found mostly in inner suburbs such as Footscray/Sunshine, Elsternwick-Brighton, Clifton Hill and Port Melbourne. Routes in the Doncaster/Templestowe area also have these numbers due to a Tramways board takeover after the area&#x27;s private operator collapsed. In the 1990s all MetBus routes were put out to private franchise. Until August 2013, these services were operated by Melbourne Bus Link and National Bus Company. All of these services were taken over by Transdev Melbourne in August 2013, and then taken over by Kinetic Melbourne in January 2022.
*900 series: Historically these route numbers were used by Victorian Railways, who ran buses co-ordinated with trains on some routes. Routes with these numbers have either been abolished or incorporated into other routes. The 900 series is now used for the high frequency SmartBus services, which are mostly cross-town and orbital routes.

<doc id="497057" wikidata="Q7691137" url="?curid=497057" title="Tea sandwich">
<text>A tea sandwich (also referred to as finger sandwich) is a small prepared sandwich meant to be eaten at afternoon teatime to stave off hunger until the main meal.

== History ==
Tea sandwiches became popular when tea parties were a common afternoon entertainment for the well-off. Recipes for tea sandwiches appeared in &quot;Mrs. Hill&#x27;s New Cook Book&quot; (1867).

== Ingredients, preparation, and serving ==
The tea sandwich may take a number of different forms, but they typically are sized to be easy to handle and capable of being eaten in two or three bites. Shapes may be long and narrow, triangular, round, or a decorative shape created with a cookie cutter.

The bread is traditionally a soft white bread, thinly sliced, and buttered. The bread crust is cut away cleanly from the sandwich after the sandwich has been prepared but before serving. Modern bread variations might include wheat, pumpernickel, sour dough or rye bread. The bread used for preparing finger sandwiches is sometimes referred to as sandwich bread.

Fillings are light, and are &quot;dainty&quot; or &quot;delicate&quot; in proportion to the amount of bread. Spreads might include butter, cream cheese or mayonnaise mixtures, and the sandwiches often feature fresh vegetables such as radishes, olives, cucumber, asparagus, or watercress. The cucumber tea sandwich in particular is considered the quintessential tea sandwich. A cucumber sandwich made with Benedictine is a classic in Kentucky, US.

Other popular tea sandwich fillings include tomatoes, pimento cheese, ham with mustard, smoked salmon with cream cheese, fruit jam, curried chicken, fish paste, and egg salad.

<text>Bill Moyer (September 17, 1933 – October 21, 2002) was a United States social change activist who was a principal organizer in the 1966 Chicago Open Housing Movement. He was an author, and a founding member of the Movement for a New Society.

== Chicago Open Housing Movement ==
Initially trained as an engineer, Moyer was introduced to the philosophy and practice of nonviolence by Quaker friends, and completed a degree in social work. He became involved in campaigns for civil rights and open housing integration, working and organizing in the early and mid-1960s with the Chicago branch of the Quaker-based American Friends Service Committee along with Kale Williams, civil rights activist Bernard Lafayette, and others. Then, in 1966, he joined with James Bevel, Martin Luther King Jr. and the other leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) during the Chicago Movement.

James Bevel, who strategized and directed that action, credits Moyer with influencing him to center the Chicago Movement on open housing.

== Further social movements ==
Over the next decade, Moyer was involved in the SCLC&#x27;s 1969 Poor People&#x27;s Campaign in Washington, D.C., nonviolent blockades of arms shipments to Bangladesh (1971) and to Vietnam (1972), support for the American Indian Movement occupation at Wounded Knee, South Dakota (1973), and a nuclear power plant blockade at Seabrook, New Hampshire (1977).

It was during the nonviolent blockade of the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, which involved the arrest of 1,414 individuals (most charges were later dropped), that Moyer recognised the need for social change activists to understand the dynamics behind movement success. In particular, the need to openly address the contradiction that activists often perceive the normal signs of campaign progress as signs of failure.

Moyer developed the Movement Action Plan (MAP) to achieve this end. Since its development it has been used to train hundreds of activists, most notably in the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe.

After the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, Moyer participated in many workshops in Eastern Europe about nonviolence and social change. In the mid-1980s, he moved to San Francisco, California, where he began to explore Transpersonal psychology and continued his participation in the Friends meeting there. He also developed a workshop called &quot;Creating Peaceful Relationships&quot; based on his realizations regarding dominator cultures.

Moyer&#x27;s book &quot;Doing Democracy&quot; (New Society Publishers), co-authored by JoAnn McAllister, Mary Lou Finley and Steven Soifer, summarises his theories of social change with case studies from the Civil Rights Movement, anti-nuclear, gay and lesbian, breast cancer and Global Justice movements.

<text>The Albany River Rats were a minor league professional ice hockey team in the American Hockey League. They played in Albany, New York at the Times Union Center.

==History==

===Before the formation of the franchise===
Without a viable indoor arena with an ice surface, through the end of the 1980s the city of Albany had never had a minor league professional hockey team. Three separate attempts to establish teams in the neighboring cities of Schenectady and Troy had proven unsuccessful.

The first was in the 1952-53 season when the Capital Region had its first foray into pro hockey in the form of the Troy Uncle Sam Trojans, who played a single season in the Eastern Hockey League, finishing last in the five-team loop and folding after the season.

Professional hockey would not return to the Capital Region until the 1980s, with a pair of failed attempts to establish franchises in the low-level Atlantic Coast Hockey League. The Schenectady Chiefs were awarded a charter franchise in the ACHL&#x27;s inaugural 1981-82 season, but after drawing minuscule crowds in a rink built in a converted department store, that team folded on November 18, 1981 after just nine games. Roughly five years later, the Troy Slapshots joined the same league and played just 6 games before folding in November 17, 1986.

After this troubled period for hockey in the region, construction of the palatial Knickerbocker Arena in downtown Albany in 1990 changed the face of the sport in the Capital District. The week that the new arena opened, plans were unveiled worldwide for the formation of the fledgling Global Hockey League, a challenger to the NHL with teams in North America and Europe that would begin play in November of that year. One of six inaugural franchises announced in the league&#x27;s initial press conference was the Albany Admirals, which was to be owned by businessman Joseph O&#x27;Hara and had signed a lease to play in the Knickerbocker Arena. The Capital hockey community was abuzz with excitement, and commitments for over 3,000 season tickets were received. However, by the end of May, disagreements between O&#x27;Hara and the league founders led O&#x27;Hara to withdraw his franchise from the new league. In June, the league postponed its opening season by a year, but the venture never materialized and the Global Hockey League never made it to the ice.

Since 1979, Capital Region hockey fans, press and media had effectively adopted the Adirondack Red Wings as their pseudo-home team. Although the American Hockey League team was based 45 minutes north of Albany in Glens Falls, NY, it relied on fans from the Capital Region as a vital part of their market. The situation set the stage for a flurry of activity as other teams and leagues eyed the area. 

It began when area investors tried to secure an expansion American Hockey League franchise for Albany, but the Adirondack Red Wings nixed the effort by invoking their territorial rights to the Tri-Cities area. Soon after, an attempt to establish an International Hockey League franchise at the &quot;Knick&quot; was vetoed by IHL Governors concerned about the travel costs for teams in the Midwest-based league. Then attempts to lure the A-Wings to the new arena were thwarted when that franchise signed a new ten-year lease to remain in Glens Falls.

In the summer of 1990, David Welker, the owner of the Fort Wayne Komets of the International Hockey League, having made an arrangement to absorb a portion of other teams&#x27; travel costs, announced he was moving his franchise to Knickerbocker Arena, and the Albany Choppers were born.

===The Birth of the Capital District Islanders===
Officials of the established American Hockey League felt that the Midwest-based IHL was invading their territory, and the hockey war was on. The AHL hoped to create a situation that might somehow force the IHL team out of the market. League officials felt that if they added an additional AHL franchise to the market, they&#x27;d create a natural rival for the Adirondack Red Wings. Although the Choppers had the distinct advantage of the new arena, the AHL was hoping to counter that advantage with the established fan base of the AHL, the affiliations of NHL clubs, the higher classification and better quality of play of the AHL, and the new rivalry between the established Wings and the fledgling Islanders.

The AHL knew the market was not big enough to support three professional hockey teams, but they were willing to take the risk. The AHL convinced the Adirondack Red Wings to waive their territorial rights to the Capital Region, and a new AHL team was granted to neighboring Troy. Local car dealer Mike Cantanucci formed the Capital District Islanders, who would play in the RPI&#x27;s Houston Fieldhouse and be affiliated with the NHL&#x27;s New York Islanders.

Despite playing in the state-of-the-art Knickerbocker Arena, the Choppers became the casualty of the Tri-Cities price and attendance wars. Welker&#x27;s management style turned off advertisers, sponsors, and fans alike, and on February 11, 1991 with dwindling attendance, high lease and travel costs, no NHL affiliation to help pay expenses, and not enough money to meet player payroll, the Choppers folded in midseason.

The AHL was the clear winner in the battle for hockey in the Capital Region, and the result was a new AHL franchise that would become the predominant hockey franchise in the metropolitan area for the next two decades.

The team competed in the AHL as the Capital District Islanders for three seasons, playing on campus at RPI located across the Hudson River in Troy, New York.

The Islanders showed slow but modest improvement in their three years in Troy, moving from a seventh-place division finish in their inaugural season to a fourth-place finish and playoff berth in season two, to a 34-34-12 record in 1992-93, good for third in the division and another first-round playoff exit.

===Transition from the Islanders to the River Rats===

Significant changes were made for the 1993-94 season. Cantanucci sold the franchise to local insurance executive Al Lawrence, and the team switched affiliations from the Islanders to the New Jersey Devils. With the Knickerbocker Arena untapped as a hockey facility, the franchise moved from the campus of RPI to the 15,000-seat downtown arena, and changed their nickname to the Albany River Rats.

The Rats&#x27; glory days came in the mid- to late-1990s making seven consecutive playoff appearances, winning two division titles, and taking home the AHL&#x27;s Calder Cup in 1995. Also in 1995, their parent club, the New Jersey Devils, won the Stanley Cup.

However, wins declined after the 1997–98 season, the last time Albany won a playoff series. By 1998, owner Al Lawrence had been mired in bankruptcy court and was forced to sell the River Rats hockey team. Walter Robb purchased the franchise, allowing the franchise to remain in Albany.

The River Rats finished last in each of the six seasons between 2000–01 and 2005–06. A new affiliation with the Carolina Hurricanes beginning in the 2006–07 season brought hope of a return to AHL glory not seen in Albany since the late 1990s.

On March 22, 2006, the Devils announced that they were cutting ties with the River Rats after the 2005–06 AHL season, as the parent club announced the purchase of the Lowell Lock Monsters. Despite the move, the River Rats were not relocated. In April 2006, The Carolina Hurricanes signed a one-year agreement (with the option to renew for two additional) with the River Rats to be their farm affiliate; the end result was essentially a swap of AHL affiliates as the Lowell franchise had previously been the top affiliate of Carolina. Later on, Carolina was joined by the Colorado Avalanche in a one-year partnership agreement. On February 22, 2007, the Carolina Hurricanes and Albany River Rats announced that their affiliation agreement had been extended through the 2008–09 season.

On April 24, 2008, the River Rats lost 3–2 to the Philadelphia Phantoms in the (until then) longest game played in AHL history. The Phantoms&#x27; Ryan Potulny scored 2:58 into the fifth overtime. Albany gave up 101 shots on goal, and goaltender Michael Leighton made 98 saves.

===2009 bus crash===
On February 19, 2009, five people were seriously injured when a bus carrying the team home from a game in Lowell struck a guard rail and rolled on its side on Interstate 90 in Becket, Massachusetts. Nicolas Blanchard, Joe Jensen, Jonathan Paiement, Casey Borer, and the River Rats radio color commentator John Hennessy were taken to Berkshire Medical Center in Pittsfield with serious injuries.

===Move to Charlotte===
In late January, 2010, word began to leak out of Raleigh that the franchise was about to be sold and moved to Charlotte, North Carolina. On February 10, it became official as the Albany River Rats website announced that the sale of the franchise had been completed, and that the team would be moving to Charlotte at the conclusion of the 2009–10 AHL Season. &quot;Capital District Sports, Inc. announced today that its subsidiary, the Albany River Rats, has sold its American Hockey League franchise to MAK Hockey, LLC located in Charlotte, North Carolina. The sale will not affect the remainder of the 2009-10 season, with regular season games concluding on April 10, 2010 followed by the 2010 Calder Cup Playoffs.&quot;

The relocated team, to be known as the Charlotte Checkers, would remain the top affiliate of the Carolina Hurricanes and replace that city&#x27;s ECHL franchise of the same name.

===Hockey in Albany after the River Rats===
Shortly after the announcement of the sale of the franchise, officials in Albany, as well as AHL President Dave Andrews, told media outlets that the city would likely have a team for the 2010-2011 season and might even keep the River Rats nickname and logo, which remained the property of former owner Walter Robb. On March 15, it was reported in the &quot;Albany Times Union&quot; and the &quot;Portland Press Herald&quot; that Albany officials had their sights set on the AHL&#x27;s Portland Pirates as a potential candidate for relocation, but talks between the Times Union Center and Pirates ownership eventually broke off.

Although relocation of the Portland franchise would not come to fruition, Albany did not go long without an AHL franchise. On June 6, it was announced that the Lowell Devils would be relocating to Albany, reestablishing the city&#x27;s connection with the New Jersey Devils. Despite the tradition of the River Rats branding, officials announced that as a separate entity from the previous franchise, the new team would be known as the Albany Devils. The relationship only lasted through the 2016–17 season, after which the Devils announced they would be relocating their AHL team to Binghamton, New York to replace the Ottawa Senators&#x27; team after they relocated.

<doc id="497068" wikidata="Q155813" url="?curid=497068" title="Ostalgie">
<text>In German culture, Ostalgie () is nostalgia for aspects of life in Communist East Germany. It is a portmanteau of the German words &quot;&quot; (east) and &quot;&quot; (nostalgia). Its anglicised equivalent, ostalgia (rhyming with &quot;nostalgia&quot;), is also sometimes used. Another term for the phenomenon is GDR nostalgia ().

The term was coined by the East German standup comic in 1992. 
Social scientist Thomas Ahbe argues that the term &quot;ostalgia&quot; is often misunderstood as a lack of willingness to integrate, an attempt to reverse German reunification and reinstate the GDR. However, Ostalgia is rather an integration strategy used by East Germans who wanted to retain their own original experiences, memories and values incompatible with those of the West German majority.

As with other cases of Communist nostalgia, there are various motivations, whether ideology, nationalism, wistfulness for a lost sense of social status or stability, or even aesthetics or irony.

In 2023, a poll found that while 52% of Germans living in the former East Germany identified as Germans, 40% identify as East Germans.
==History==
Ostalgie is a complex term that should not be described as a simple emotion of nostalgia. As Ostalgie relates back to the history of the Cold War, it is better to examine this term in the context of history and current influence in Western society; in doing so, the meaning of this term becomes clearer.

The division of Germany into East and West for over 35 years engendered the formation of distinct identities between the two regions. Despite their shared language and history, the capitalist FRG and socialist GDR differed in many obvious political, economic and cultural respects; thus, their respective societies cultivated cultural identities distinct to each region. These pre-existing differences were then exposed during and after the reunification process.

==Effects==

After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the following German reunification a year later, many of the symbols of the German Democratic Republic were swept away. The process of unification gave rise to feelings of resentment and nostalgia amongst former GDR citizens. They felt short-changed by a unification process which they equated to a colonial take over. One particular focus of Ostalgie centred around unemployment. Officially, unemployment had not existed in the GDR, but this employment security disappeared with reunification and unemployment became endemic at around 20% of the workforce. The social security provided by the work place in the GDR was a great focus of Ostalgia. Kolinsky presents reunification as characterised by Easterners&#x27; disaffection. The mass experience of unemployment emerged as a key tenet of a re-forged East German identity based on the collective experience of employment-loss and the perceived economic destruction of their region. Subsequently, many constructed a retrospective image of the GDR as a stable and caring environment. Unification was felt to have been to their disadvantage and to have isolated them as second-class citizens.

Reunification presented a particular challenge to women. This was particularly true for working women who had enjoyed organised healthcare and equal pay in the GDR and who faced the greatest unemployment post-Wende. Approximately 70% of East German women lost their job after 1990. Women were laid off faster than men, as well as suffering the consequences of the collapse of state-run childcare facilities and traditional ideals of female domesticity and consumerism were reinvoked, having been challenged by the state in the GDR.

Ostalgie was also felt for commodities of the GDR. Almost all GDR brands of products disappeared from the stores and were replaced by Western products. However, after some time many Eastern Germans began to miss certain aspects of their former lives (like culture or the known brand marks). &quot;Ostalgie&quot; particularly refers to the nostalgia for aspects of regular daily life and culture in the former GDR, which disappeared after reunification.

==Commercialisation==

Ostalgie is expressed in present day Germany through commodities and products reminiscent of the East-German era.

Many businesses in Germany cater to those who feel &quot;Ostalgie&quot; and have begun providing them with artifacts that remind them of life under the GDR; artifacts that imitate the old ones. Available again are brands of East German food, old state television programmes on video tape and DVD, and the once widespread Wartburg and Trabant cars.

==Popular culture==

Those seeking the preservation of East German culture banded together to save the &quot;Eastern Crosswalk Man&quot; (Ost-Ampelmännchen), an illuminated depiction of a man wearing a &quot;perky&quot;, &quot;cheerful&quot; and potentially &quot;petit bourgeois&quot; hat (inspired by a summer photo of Erich Honecker in a straw hat) in crosswalk lights. Many German cities in and near the former East German border, including Berlin, Lübeck and Erfurt, still retain the use of the &quot;Ampelmännchen&quot; at all or some pedestrian crossings due to its cultural relevance, and many souvenirs sold in the new states and in Berlin make use of the icon.

Life in the GDR has also been the subject of several films, including Leander Haußmann&#x27;s &quot;Sonnenallee&quot; (1999), Wolfgang Becker&#x27;s internationally successful &quot;Good Bye, Lenin!&quot; (2003), and Carsten Fiebeler&#x27;s &quot;Kleinruppin forever&quot; (2004).

==Critical interpretations==
Ostalgie could be inspired by the longing of the &quot;Ossis&quot; (German for &quot;Easterners&quot;, a term for former GDR citizens) for the social system and the sense of community of the GDR. When &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; asked former GDR-inhabitants whether the GDR &quot;had more good sides than bad sides&quot; in 2009, 57% of them answered yes. To the statement of the interviewing journalist that &quot;GDR inhabitants did not have the freedom to travel wherever they wanted&quot;, respondents replied that &quot;present-day low-wage workers do not have that freedom either&quot;.

===&quot;Ostalgie&quot; as &quot;West-algie&quot;===
According to Dominic Boyer, the concept of nostalgia has been described for several centuries. Nostalgia is connected with nationalism; longing for the former homeland generates love for everything associated with it. This evokes negative feelings toward &quot;foreign&quot; products, customs or cultural influences. Boyer says that &quot;ostalgie&quot; is more than East German nostalgia, examining nostalgia in the context of the Second World War and &quot;Vergangenheitsbelastung&quot; (&quot;the burden of the past&quot;). The division of East and West Germany was not punishment for Germany&#x27;s war crimes. Nazi Germany has made the German postwar generation shameful and anxious about its past. West and East Germany claimed that the other side was more &quot;German&quot;, and more responsible for war crimes; this created a symbiotic relationship, which was eliminated by German reunification.

According to Boyer, West German opinion dominates the discourse about the West-East relationship and refuses to take the opinions of former East German members seriously. Boyer writes that &quot;ostalgie&quot; has created a &quot;no-place&quot; East Germany, which is only &quot;realistic&quot; from a West German perspective. The East German perspective (despite its individual history, policy, structure, way of life, and outlook) is invalid, and unable to challenge the &quot;Western&quot; image of East Germany. Enns Anthony wrote that understanding &quot;ostalgie&quot; should go &quot;beyond the simple question of whose representation of the GDR is more valid or authentic&quot;; what matters is the situation of former residents of the GDR.

<text>Andrea Fischer (born 14 January 1960) is a former member of the German Bundestag for the German Green Party and from 1998 until 2001 was Federal Minister for Health. She dropped out of the Bundestag in 2002.

==Life==
===Education and profession===
After graduating from high school, Andrea Fischer completed an apprenticeship as an offset printer. She then worked as a printer and proofreader and additionally completed her studies in economics at the Free University of Berlin. After completing her studies, she worked as a research assistant at the European Parliament, the WZB Berlin Social Science Center
and the &quot;Federal Insurance Institution for Employees&quot; (&quot;Bundesversicherungsanstalt für Angestellte&quot;).

===Political career===
She has been a member of the German Green Party since 1985, before that she was a member of the Group of International Marxists (GIM), the then German section of the Fourth International. From 1994 to 2002 she was a member of the German Bundestag. After the 1998 federal elections, she was appointed Federal Minister of Health on 27 October 1998, as a member of the federal government headed by Gerhard Schröder. She resigned from office on 9 January 2001 in the wake of the BSE crisis. Shortly afterwards, the resignation of the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Karl-Heinz Funke, was also announced. In the film &quot;Schlachtfeld Politik – Die finstere Seite der Macht&quot; (&quot;Battlefield Politics – The dark side of power&quot;) by Stephan Lamby, she describes that there was massive pressure from the party leadership. The film asks whether Andrea Fischer had to resign after &quot;Joschka Fischer&#x27;s wild years&quot; (Der Spiegel edition 2/2001), not so much because of the BSE crisis as to relieve Joschka Fischer.

Fischer was elected as the leading Alliance 90/The Greens candidate in the Berlin election on 18 September 2011, in the district assembly (&quot;Bezirksverordnetenversammlung&quot;) of Berlin&#x27;s Mitte borough, where she was chair of the Alliance 90/The Greens parliamentary group until 30 October 2012.

On 15 October 2012 Fischer was elected by the Regional Assembly to the office of Finance Director of the Hanover Region, which had been restructured by Regional President Hauke Jagau. It manages the areas of finance, facility management and hospitals. In April 2013 she took over as chairman of the supervisory board of the &quot;Klinikum Region Hanover&quot;.

===Lobbyism===
After her time as an active politician, Fischer became active as a freelance publicist and lobbyist in international health policy. From 2001 to 2009 she was patron of the &quot;Federal Association of Experienced Psychiatrists&quot; (&quot;Bundesverband Psychiatrie-Erfahrener&quot;). From 2004 to 2006 Fischer was a member of the management team of the consulting firm &quot;Institut für Organisationskommunikation&quot; (IFOK GmbH), where she was responsible for health and nutrition. Previously, she was head of the Center of Canadian Universities (CUC) in Berlin.

Fischer is Vice Chairwoman of the Board of Trustees of the Institute of Man, Ethics and Science (&quot;Institut Mensch, Ethik und Wissenschaft&quot;).

From 2006 to 2009 she worked at the PR agency Pleon in Munich, where she headed the medical-pharmaceutical area of healthcare. Since then she has been self-employed in this field. Since April 2006, Fischer has been co-editor of &quot;GesundheitsNachrichten&quot;, a specialist journal for the health industry.

===Journalism===
From October 2002 to the end of 2003, Andrea Fischer and BamS editor-in-chief Claus Strunz hosted the n-tv programme &quot;Grüner Salon&quot;. She appears regularly in broadcasts on Deutschlandradio Kultur, where she presents new publications of German-language crime literature.

===Other commitments===
Fischer supported the Berlin Pro-Reli campaign, which failed in April 2009, as a testimonial. Since 2008 she has been the diocesan leader of the Malteser Hilfsdienst in Berlin.

===Religion===
As a young woman, Fischer left the Catholic Church, into which she rejoined a good twenty years later.

Starring Vincent Cassel, Hubert Koundé and Saïd Taghmaoui, the film chronicles a day and night in the lives of three friends from a poor immigrant neighbourhood in the suburbs of Paris.

However, his boxing gymnasium was destroyed in the riots. , a young North African Muslim, acts as a mediator between Vinz and who constantly argue.

The three friends lead a directionless daily routine and frequently find themselves under police surveillance. At a rooftop party which is broken up by the police, Vinz insults a plainclothes police officer. After the trio leaves, Vinz reveals that he has discovered the .44 Magnum revolver lost during the riot. He plans to use it to kill a police officer if Abdel dies. While disapproves, Vinz secretly takes the gun with him. They try to visit Abdel in the hospital but are stopped by the police. is arrested after they aggressively refuse to leave, but he is later released with the assistance of a police officer who knows his brother.

A disagreement arises between Vinz and regarding their perspectives on policing and violence, leading them to part ways temporarily. accompanies Vinz, while briefly returns home. They reunite at another gathering in the , which quickly descends into chaos when Abdel&#x27;s brother attempts to murder a police officer as an act of revenge. This triggers a confrontation with the police, and the group narrowly escapes after Vinz almost shoots a riot officer. They board a train to Paris, where their interactions with both friendly and hostile Parisians escalate several situations into dangerous confrontations.

In a public restroom, they encounter a Polish survivor of the gulag who tells them a story about a man who froze to death after he refused to relieve himself in public near the train and then failed to re-board in time. The trio is perplexed by the meaning of the story.

Later, they visit , a frequent cocaine user who owes money to . This visit leads to a violent confrontation, as appears to force Vinz to play Russian roulette, although the gun is secretly unloaded. They encounter sadistic plainclothes police officers who arrest and while Vinz manages to escape. The police officers verbally and physically abuse the duo before imprisoning them until late at night, causing the three friends to miss the last train from Saint-Lazare station and spend the night on the streets.

After being kicked out of an art gallery and failing to hotwire a car, the trio takes shelter in a shopping mall. They hear from a news broadcast that Abdel has died. They make their way to a rooftop, where they insult skinheads. However, they encounter the same group of skinheads who mercilessly attack and Hubert. Vinz intervenes, holding one of the skinheads at gunpoint. Despite Hubert pushing Vinz to execute him, Vinz hesitates and ultimately lets the skinhead go.

In the early morning, the trio returns home, and Vinz hands the gun over to . Vinz and encounter the officer whom Vinz had insulted at the rooftop party.

A tense Mexican standoff ensues between and the officer, as closes his eyes. A single gunshot is heard, leaving it unclear who fired the shot or who may have been struck.

This climactic standoff is accompanied by a voice-over of &#x27;s slightly modified opening lines (&quot;It&#x27;s about a society in free fall...&quot;) and the recurring phrase (&quot;so far so good&quot;). The film portrays a microcosm of French society&#x27;s descent from hostility into senseless violence, emphasizing that despite appearances, all is not well and the future remains uncertain.

Kassovitz has said that the idea came to him when a young Zairian, , was shot in 1993. He was killed at point blank range while in police custody and handcuffed to a radiator. The officer was reported to have been angered by &#x27;s words, and had been threatening him when the gun went off accidentally. Kassovitz began writing the script on 6 April 1993, the day was shot. He was also inspired by the case of , a 22-year-old student protester who died after being badly beaten by the riot police after a mass demonstration in 1986, in which he did not take part. &#x27;s death is also referred to in the opening montage of the film. included his own experiences; he took part in riots, he acts in a number of scenes and includes his father Peter in another.

The majority of the filming was done in the Parisian suburb of . Unstaged footage was used for this film, taken from 1986 to 1995; riots still took place during the time of filming. To actually film in the , Kassovitz, the production team and the actors, moved there for three months prior to the shooting as well as during actual filming. Due to the film&#x27;s controversial subject matter, seven or eight local French councils refused to allow the film crew to film on their territory. Kassovitz was forced to temporarily rename the script . Some of the actors were not professionals and the film includes many situations that were based on real events.

<text>The mitre (Commonwealth English) or miter (American English; see spelling differences; both pronounced ; ) is a type of headgear now known as the traditional, ceremonial headdress of bishops and certain abbots in traditional Christianity. Mitres are worn in the Catholic Church, Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church (IOC), Malankara Syrian Orthodox Church (Jacobites), Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Anglican Communion, some Lutheran churches, for important ceremonies, by the Metropolitan of the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church, and also, in the Catholic Church, all cardinals, whether or not bishops, and some Eastern Orthodox archpriests.

==Etymology==
 (Ionic ) is Greek, and means a piece of armour, usually a metal guard worn around the waist and under a cuirass, as mentioned in Homer&#x27;s Iliad. In later poems, it was used to refer to a headband used by women for their hair, and a sort of formal Babylonian headdress, as mentioned by Herodotus (&quot;Histories&quot; 1.195 and 7.90). It also refers to a kind of hairband, such as &quot;the victor&#x27;s chaplet at the games&quot;, a headband and a badge of rank at the Ptolemaic court, an oriental headdress, perhaps a kind of turban, worn &quot;as a mark of effeminacy&quot;, a diadem, the headdress of the priest of Heracles, or the headdress of the High Priest of Israel referenced in the Septuagint (Greek) text of Exodus 29:6.
==Western Christianity==

In its modern form in Western Christianity, the mitre is a tall folding cap, consisting of two similar parts (the front and back) rising to a peak and sewn together at the sides. Two short lappets always hang down from the back.

=== History ===
The &quot;camelaucum&quot; (Greek: καμιλαύκιον, &quot;kamilaukion&quot;), the headdress that both the mitre and the papal tiara stem from, was originally a cap used by officials of the Imperial Byzantine court. &quot;The tiara [from which the mitre originates] probably developed from the Phrygian cap, or frigium, a conical cap worn in the Graeco-Roman world. In the 10th century the tiara was pictured on papal coins.&quot; Other sources say the tiara developed the other way around, from the mitre. In the late Empire it developed into the closed type of Imperial crown used by Byzantine Emperors (see illustration of Michael III, 842–867).

Worn by a bishop, the mitre is depicted for the first time in two miniatures of the beginning of the eleventh century. The first written mention of it is found in a Bull of Pope Leo IX in the year 1049. By 1150 the use had spread to bishops throughout the West.

In the Church of England, the mitre fell out of use after the Reformation, but was restored in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a result of the Oxford Movement, and is now worn by most bishops of the Anglican Communion on at least some occasions. In The Episcopal Church of the United States, the first Presiding Bishop, Samuel Seabury, wore a mitre as early as 1786. The mitre is also worn by bishops in a number of Lutheran churches, for example the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia, the Church of Sweden, and the Lutheran Church in Great Britain.

In the Catholic Church, ecclesial law gives the right to use the mitre and other pontifical insignia (crosier, pectoral cross, and ring) to bishops, abbots, cardinals, and those canonically equivalent to diocesan bishops who do not receive episcopal ordination. The principal celebrant presents the mitre and other pontifical insignia to a newly ordained bishop during the Rite of Ordination of a Bishop and to a new abbot during the Rite of Blessing of an Abbot. In the case of a person who is canonically equivalent to a diocesan bishop but does not receive episcopal ordination, this presentation normally occurs during a public installation as the ordinary of his jurisdiction. Catholic ecclesial law also permits former Anglican bishops received into full communion and subsequently ordained to the order of presbyter in the Catholic Church to obtain permission to use pontifical insignia as a mark of recognition of their previous ministry (they also may be admitted to the national or regional episcopal conference with status equivalent to that of retired Catholic bishops), but former Anglican bishops typically have not requested permission to use pontifical insignia under this provision.

Three types of mitres are worn by Roman Catholic clergy for different occasions:
# The &quot;simplex&quot; (&#x27;simple&#x27;, referring to the materials used) is made of undecorated white linen or silk and its white lappets traditionally end in red fringes. It is worn most notably at funerals, Lent, on Good Friday and by concelebrant bishops at a Mass. Cardinals in the presence of the Pope wear a mitre of white linen damask.
# The &quot;auriphrygiata&quot; is of plain gold cloth or white silk with gold, silver or coloured embroidered bands; when seen today it is usually worn by bishops when they preside at the celebration of the sacraments.
# The &quot;pretiosa&quot; (&#x27;precious&#x27;) is decorated with precious stones and gold and worn on the principal Mass on the most solemn Sundays (except in Lent) and feast days. This type of mitre is rarely decorated with precious stones today, and the designs have become more varied, simple and original, often merely being in the liturgical colour of the day.

The proper colour of a mitre is always white, although in liturgical usage white also includes vestments made from gold and silver fabrics. The embroidered bands and other ornaments which adorn a mitre and the lappets may be of other colours and often are.

On all occasions, an altar server may wear a shawl-style veil, called a vimpa, around the shoulders when holding the bishop&#x27;s mitre.

=== Heraldry ===
In ecclesiastical heraldry, a mitre was placed above the shield of all persons who were entitled to wear the mitre, including abbots. It substituted for the helm of military arms, but also appeared as a crest placed atop a helmet, as was common in German heraldry. In the Anglican Churches, the Church of Sweden, and the Lutheran Church of Finland, the mitre is still placed above the arms of bishops instead of the ecclesiastical hat. In the Roman Catholic Church, the use of the mitre above the shield on the personal arms of clergy was suppressed in 1969, and is now found only on some corporate arms, like those of dioceses. Previously, the mitre was often included under the hat, and even in the arms of a cardinal, the mitre was not entirely displaced. In heraldry the mitre is always shown in gold, and the lappets (&quot;infulae&quot;) are of the same colour. It has been asserted that before the reformation, a distinction was used to be drawn between the mitre of a bishop and an abbot by the omission of the infulae in the abbot&#x27;s arms. In England and France it was usual to place the mitre of an abbot slightly in profile.

With his inauguration as pope, Benedict XVI broke with tradition and replaced the papal tiara even on his papal coat of arms with a papal mitre (containing still the three levels of &#x27;crowns&#x27; representing the powers of the papacy in a simplified form) and pallium. Prior to Benedict XVI, each pope&#x27;s coat of arms always contained the image of the papal tiara and St. Peter&#x27;s crossed keys, even though the tiara had fallen into disuse, especially under popes John Paul I and John Paul II. Pope Paul VI was the last pope to date to begin his papal reign with a formal coronation in June 1963. However, as a sign of the perceived need for greater simplification of the papal rites, as well as the changing nature of the papacy itself, he abandoned the use of his tiara in a dramatic ceremony in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica during the second session of Vatican II in November 1963. However his 1975 Apostolic Constitution made it clear the tiara had not been abolished: in the constitution he made provision for his successor to receive a coronation. Pope John Paul I, however, declined to follow Paul VI&#x27;s constitution and opted for a simpler papal inauguration, a precedent followed by his three successors. Pope John Paul II&#x27;s 1996 Apostolic Constitution left open several options by not specifying what sort of ceremony was to be used, other than that some ceremony would be held to inaugurate a new pontificate.

==Eastern Christianity==

The most typical mitre in the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches is based on the closed Imperial crown of the late Byzantine Empire. Therefore, it too is ultimately based on the older καμιλαύκιον although it diverged from the secular headdress at a much later date, after it had already undergone further development. 

=== History ===
Orthodox bishops started wearing mitres around the 16th or 17th century, but the date of adoption is disputed. The use of headgear of any kind by the Byzantine church was a late development, and before the 1500s they wore no headgear. Theodore Balsamon, Patriarch of Antioch (ca. 1130–1140) stated that the patriarch of Alexandria was the only Orthodox prelate to wear a hat during the liturgy. This claim was repeated by Symeon of Thessalonica in the fifteenth century, who in his &quot;Concerning the Holy Temple,&quot; wrote that all Eastern hierarchs and priests, with the exception of the patriarch of Alexandria conduct sacred service with uncovered heads. 

Another evidence pointing to the lack of headgear among the Orthodox bishops was the complaint against John XI of Constantinople who was accused of copying the Catholic pope in wearing a mitre. In 1585 a Russian envoy witnessed the patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria, and Jerusalem celebrated the divine liturgy together and only the Alexandrian patriarch wore a mitre. 

Some modern scholars believe that the mitre was first adopted among the Orthodox when Cyril Lucaris (previously patriarch of Alexandria) became Ecumenical Patriarch in the early 1600s. Others instead claim that the mitre started being used after the fall of Constantinople (1453). There are some examples of Orthodox religious headgear (and possibly mitres) as early as the 14th century, such as a fresco of Metropolitan Kalevit in the Kremikovtsi Monastery or the mitre donated to the patriarch of Belgrade by Katarina Branković.

Some have hypothesized that shape of the mitres adopted after the fall of Constantinople was likely derived by the &quot;stemma&quot;, the Byzantine imperial crown. Together with other imperial-derived vestements like the sakkos, the crown-like mitre embodied the regality and richness of the defunct empire, of which the bishops inherited the legacy. 

In medieval Russia bishops wore hats with a fringe, but not a mitre. This is in contrast to Constantinople and most other Orthodox clergy who did not wear any headgear, and might be accounted for by the cold temperatures in Russia. The mitre was first appeared in Russia with Patriarch Nikon, who adopted it from the tradition of the Patriarch of Constantinople. Initially, it was only worn by the Patriarch of Moscow, but it was soon adopted by the rest of the bishops, and a council in 1675 mandated the mitre for all bishops, following the Greek custom. Mitres were also given to some archimandrites, by the decree of Peter the Great in 1705; in 1786 Catherine the Great awarded a mitre to her spiritual father, Archpriest John Pamphilov. In 1797 the decree of Paul I allowed the mitre to be awarded to archpriests as mark of special distinction. In 1988, the Holy Synod of the Russian Church decided that the mitres of all bishops would be topped with a cross, which until then was reserved for the Patriarch (also granted to the metropolitan of Kiev starting in 1686).

=== Use ===
The Eastern mitre is made in the shape of a bulbous crown, completely enclosed, and the material is of brocade, damask or cloth of gold. It may also be embroidered, and is often richly decorated with jewels. There are normally four icons attached to the mitre (often of Christ, the Theotokos, John the Baptist and the Cross), which the bishop may kiss before he puts it on. Eastern mitres are usually gold, but other liturgical colours may be used.

The mitre is topped by a cross, either made out of metal and standing upright, or embroidered in cloth and lying flat on the top. In Greek practice, the mitres of all bishops are topped with a standing cross. The same is true in the Russian tradition. Mitres awarded to priests will have the cross lying flat. Sometimes, instead of the flat cross, the mitre may have an icon on the top.

As an item of Imperial , along with other such items as the sakkos (Imperial dalmatic) and epigonation, the mitre came to signify the temporal authority of bishops (especially that of the Patriarch of Constantinople) within the administration of the &quot;Rum millet&quot; (i.e., the Christian community) of the Ottoman Empire. The mitre is removed at certain solemn moments during the Divine Liturgy and other services, usually being removed and replaced by the protodeacon.

The use of the mitre is a prerogative of bishops, but it may be awarded to archpriests, protopresbyters and archimandrites. The priestly mitre is not surmounted by a cross, and is awarded at the discretion of a synod of bishops.

==Military uniform==
During the 18th century (and in a few cases the 19th), soldiers designated as grenadiers in various northern European armies wore a mitre (usually called a &quot;mitre cap&quot;) similar in outline to those worn by western bishops. As first adopted in the 1680s this cap had been worn instead of the usual broad-brimmed hat to avoid the headdress being knocked off when the soldier threw a grenade. The hand grenade in its primitive form had become obsolete by the mid-18th century but grenadiers continued as elite troops in most European armies, usually retaining the mitre cap as a distinction.

Militarily, this headdress came in different styles. The Prussian style had a cone-shaped brass or white metal front with a cloth rear having lace braiding; the Russian style initially consisted of a tall brass plate atop of a leather cap with a peak at the rear, although the German model was subsequently adopted. The British style—usually simply called a &quot;grenadier cap&quot; instead of a mitre—had a tall cloth front with elaborate regimental embroidery forward of a sloping red back, lined in white. Some German and Russian fusilier regiments also wore a mitre with a smaller brass front-plate.

By the end of the 18th century, due to changes in military fashion, the mitre had generally given way to the bearskin or had been replaced by the standard infantry tricorn or bicorn. The British Army made this change in 1765 and the Prussian Army in 1790. All Russian grenadiers continued however to wear mitre caps until 1805, even when on active service. The mitre in its classic metal-fronted 18th-century form survived as an item of ceremonial parade dress in the Prussian &quot;Leib-Grenadier No 1&quot; and regiments; plus the Russian Pavlovskii Regiment, until World War I.

==Other uses==
The bishop in the board game chess is represented by a stylised Western mitre having Unicode codes U+2657 (white) and U+265D (black): ♗♝.

The crowns of the Austrian Empire and Imperial Russia incorporated a mitre of precious metal and jewels into their design. The Austrian Imperial Crown was originally the personal crown of Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II and has the form proper to that of a Holy Roman Emperor. At the Roman rite of their Coronation, the Pope placed a mitre on their heads before placing the crown over it. Their empress consorts also received both a mitre and crown on their heads from a cardinal bishop at the same ceremony. The form of the Russian Imperial Crown dates back to the time of Peter the Great’s early attempts to westernise Russia and was probably inspired by the crowns worn by Habsburg emperors of the Holy Roman Empire and possibly also the Orthodox mitre.

Abbesses of certain very ancient abbeys in the West also wore mitres, but of a very different form than that worn by male prelates.

The mitral valve of the human heart, which is located between the left atrium and the left ventricle, is named so because of its similarity in shape to the mitre. Andreas Vesalius, the father of anatomy, noted the striking similarity between the two while performing anatomic dissections in the sixteenth century.

<text>Casino Lisboa (, ) is a hotel casino in Sé, Macau, owned by the Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau (STDM). This three-storey complex was built in late 1960s.

The original casino and the 12-storey round hotel tower were built in 1970 by Stanley Ho, Teddy Yip, Yip Hon and Henry Fok. A 270-room extension was added in 1991 for a total of 927 rooms. In 2006, another extension, the Grand Lisboa, was built next to the current complex. Therefore, a total of 2,362 rooms are in place in Hotel Lisboa as of 2010. This expansion was partly done in competition with the newly opened Wynn Macau, located right next to the original Casino Lisboa.

==Robuchon á Galera==

&quot;Robuchon á Galera&quot;, owned by the late chef Joël Robuchon, has been awarded three stars by the Michelin Guide in 2008. Robuchon á Galera serves European cuisine such as roasted guinea fowl and foie gras from its à la carte menu. The restaurant has since moved to the top floor of the Grand Lisboa hotel and has been renamed Robuchon au Dôme.

<doc id="497087" wikidata="Q491766" url="?curid=497087" title="Mathieu Kassovitz">
<text>Mathieu Kassovitz () is a French actor, film director, film producer and screenwriter. He has won three César Awards: Most Promising Actor for &quot;See How They Fall&quot; (1994), and Best Film and Best Editing for &quot;La Haine&quot; (1995). He also received Best Director and Best Writing nominations.

==Early life==
Mathieu Kassovitz is the son of Peter Kassovitz, a film producer, director, and writer, and Chantal Rémy, a film editor. His mother is a French Catholic, while his father is a Hungarian Jew who fled during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Mathieu has described himself as &quot;not Jewish but I was brought up in a world of Jewish humor&quot;.

==Career==
===Filmmaker===
As a filmmaker, Kassovitz has made several artistic and commercial successes. He wrote and directed &quot;La Haine&quot; (&quot;Hate&quot;, 1995), a film dealing with themes around class, race, violence, and police brutality. The film won the César Award for Best Film and netted Kassovitz the Best Director prize at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival. 

He later directed &quot;The Crimson Rivers&quot; (2000), a police detective thriller starring Jean Reno and Vincent Cassel, another massive commercial success in France, and &quot;Gothika&quot; (2003), a fantasy thriller (considered by some to be a commercial failure, although it grossed over three times its roughly $40 million budget), with Halle Berry, Robert Downey Jr., and Penélope Cruz. He used the money he made from &quot;Gothika&quot; to develop a far more personal project &quot;Babylon Babies&quot;, the adaptation of one of Maurice G. Dantec&#x27;s books, which eventually would become &quot;Babylon A.D.&quot;. Kassovitz established the film production firm MNP Entreprise in 2000 &quot;to develop and produce feature films by Kassovitz and to represent him as a director and actor.&quot; MNP Entreprise is responsible for the co-productions of a number of films including &quot;Avida&quot; (2006) in which Kassovitz acted and &quot;Babylon A.D.&quot; which he directed. Kassovitz purchased the film rights for the novel &quot;Johnny chien méchant&quot; by Congolese writer Emmanuel Dongala. The film adaptation titled &quot;Johnny Mad Dog&quot;, written and directed by Jean-Stéphane Sauvaire, premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival where it was screened within the Un Certain Regard section.

In 2011, he starred in and directed &quot;Rebellion&quot;, a war film based on a true story of French commandos who clashed with tribes in New Caledonia, the Melanesian territory of France. His future project science fiction film &quot;MNP&quot; is named after Mir Space Station, whose writing in Cyrillic letters (Мир) look like the letters MNP, and also the production company.

===Actor===

Kassovitz is most famous outside France for his acting role as Nino Quincampoix in Jean-Pierre Jeunet&#x27;s film&quot; Amélie&quot;. He also had small roles in &quot;La Haine&quot; (which he also directed), &quot;Birthday Girl,&quot; and &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;. He played leading roles in &quot;A Self-Made Hero&quot; (1996) by Jacques Audiard and in &quot;Amen.&quot; (2003) by Costa-Gavras. Kassovitz is also recognizable for playing a conflicted Belgian explosives expert in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2005 film &quot;Munich&quot;, alongside Eric Bana, Daniel Craig, and Geoffrey Rush. Kassovitz was a jury member for the 2001 Cannes Film Festival.

Since 2015, Kassovitz has been starring in the acclaimed espionage thriller series &quot;The Bureau&quot;, broadcast in France on Canal+ and made available around the world on Amazon Prime Video. So far five seasons have been screened.

==Personal life==
Kassovitz was married to French actress Julie Mauduech, whom he directed and acted alongside in his 1993 film &quot;Métisse&quot; (&quot;Café au lait&quot;, English title) and also made a brief appearance in &quot;La Haine&quot; (during the scene in the Parisian art gallery).

In 2009, Kassovitz won with a Tesla Roadster the &quot;Rallye Monte Carlo des Véhicules à Énergie Alternative&quot; (starting event of the FIA Alternative Energies Cup) in the category reserved to electric vehicles.

Kassovitz is also known for his outspokenness, frequently making controversial comments on socio-political issues. Kassovitz was an ardent critic of former president Nicolas Sarkozy, whom he described in his blog as having &quot;ideas that not only reveal his inexperience of politics and human relations, but which also illuminate the purely demagogical and egocentric aspects of a puny, would-be Napoleon.&quot; In a 2012 interview, he labeled the outgoing Sarkozy administration as &quot;horrible&quot;.

On 3 September 2023, while engaged in a training course at the Autodrome de Linas-Montlhéry, Kassovitz was involved in a &quot;serious&quot; motorcycle accident that caused head trauma and a fractured pelvis.

<doc id="497096" wikidata="Q2283166" url="?curid=497096" title="Rama Revealed">
<text>Rama Revealed (1993) is a science fiction novel by Arthur C. Clarke and Gentry Lee. It is the last in a four-book series of Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot; by these authors and reveals the mysteries behind the enigmatic &quot;Rama&quot; spacecraft.

== Plot summary ==

The book picks up the story immediately after the end of &quot;The Garden of Rama&quot;. The book follows the story of Nicole Wakefield and her escape from imprisonment left at the cliffhanger of the previous book.

At this point, the humans had already come into contact with two alien species known as &quot;octospiders&quot; and &quot;myrmicats&quot;. The octospiders were a simple species until a space-faring species made contact with them and forever changed their society. By undergoing genetic enhancements, the octospiders became biological wizards and were eventually able to form a utopia of sorts. The myrmicats (named by Richard Wakefield, a combination of the Greek word for ant, myrmex, due to their ant-like appearance, and the English word &quot;cat&quot; due to their feline size and running gait) were a naturally heteromorphic species whose final form was a large, interconnected sentient mesh which was able to directly interface with the human brain through a network of fibers connected to the body; while entering a symbiosis with another sentient &quot;avian&quot; species. Through this medium, it was able to communicate to Richard the threat posed to the species by the violent colonists, and at the request of the myrmicats he leaves their habitat carrying some of their eggs for preservation.

As the human colony continues to degenerate with respect to living conditions and human rights, the members of Nicole&#x27;s family escape to the region nicknamed &quot;New York&quot;, where they used to live in &quot;Rama II,&quot; and are eventually reunited with Richard.

Before long, the human colony police come after Nicole&#x27;s family in &quot;New York&quot; and they flee to the octospider city. After the human colony leader starts bombing the octospider city under a made-up pretext and the octospiders retaliate, the situation becomes dire enough that Rama&#x27;s controlling intelligence intervenes to end the conflict caused by the humans aboard, by sending everybody into hibernation until the end of the journey, except for the surviving myrmicats which are allowed to lead their daily life.

The Rama spacecraft rendezvous with another Node, an enormous tetrahedron near the star Tau Ceti, designed to research any intelligent life capable of spaceflight. The humans are divided into two groups based mainly on the degree of xenophobia they had exhibited during the journey. One group will stay at the Node to be studied; the xenophobes are segregated and never allowed to see another alien again. Before her death of old age, Nicole is allowed access to Raman technology unveiling universal insights.

<doc id="497098" wikidata="Q16919096" url="?curid=497098" title="Scottish Qualifications Authority">
<text>The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA; Gaelic: &quot;Ùghdarras Theisteanas na h-Alba&quot;) is the executive non-departmental public body of the Scottish Government responsible for accrediting educational awards. It is partly funded by the Education, Communities and Justice Directorates of the Scottish Government, and employs approximately 750 staff based in Glasgow and Dalkeith.

SQA is best known for the delivery of the annual diet of public examinations within Scotland for school pupils. SQA Higher examinations are the general acceptable level for entry to university, with Scottish universities usually requesting a minimum of 3 Highers, all above C level. However, a greater number of candidates of all ages participate in SQA specialist, vocational and higher education qualifications. SQA is accredited by the UK government to offer educational qualifications.

On 21 June 2021, it was announced that the SQA would be replaced following a review by the OECD. Despite such announcements, the SQA continues to function for the academic year 2024-25 before being replaced sometime in autumn 2025 in time for the next exam year.

== History ==
The SQA&#x27;s functions and responsibilities are laid out in the Education (Scotland) Act 1996 as amended by the Scottish Qualifications Authority Act 2002. Until their merger, the two major Scottish examination authorities were the Scottish Examination Board (SEB) and the Scottish Vocational Education Council (SCOTVEC). The former issued the school-level examinations, then called Standard Grade, Higher Grade and Certificate of Sixth Year Studies (CSYS). A legacy of its two precursor bodies, the Authority&#x27;s offices remain split over two sites, one in Glasgow and one in Dalkeith.

Under a major reform of Scottish exams (the National Qualifications or &quot;Higher Still&quot; reforms), the CSYS was replaced with a broadly equivalent qualification called Advanced Higher. Some curriculum changes were also made to the Higher grade at this time. The introduction of the reformed examinations system was criticised in the press and by the government after a series of administrative and computer errors led to several thousand incorrect Higher and Intermediate certificates being sent out. The crisis took several months to resolve, and several management figures, including the Chief Executive Ron Tuck, resigned or were fired.

==Scottish Candidate Number==
The Scottish Candidate Number (SCN) (formerly SCOTVEC number) is allocated to pupils at school and in further-education colleges who undertake Scottish Qualifications Authority (formerly SCOTVEC or Scottish Examination Board) courses.

== Qualification types ==
SQA has a statutory responsibility to provide public examinations for Scottish state schools, though these are also used more widely. It has a statutory responsibility to &quot;accredit&quot; (formally, scrutinise them and confirm that they conform to agreed UK criteria) vocational qualifications. None of its qualifications, still less its vocational qualifications, is protected by statute, but the Authority has a largely dominant position within all sectors of qualifications within Scotland. SQA awards are also exported to a number of countries including China, Africa, the Middle East, Russia and former Soviet republics and other countries. SQA also provides the licensing certification for many merchant navies throughout the world.

=== National Qualifications ===
A National Qualification (NQ) takes the form of National Courses.

Standard Grades were in existence before the Higher Still reforms. There were three Standard Grade Levels: Foundation, General and Credit. They were normally set at age 14–15 (sometimes at age 16 for students whose birthdays are before May), usually when attending High School.

National Courses were introduced with the &quot;Higher Still&quot; reforms. There are seven National Courses: National 1, National 2, National 3, National 4, National 5, Higher, Advanced Higher. National Courses can be taken in a wide range of subjects, from the purely academic, such as English and Mathematics—to the purely vocational, such as Accounting and Mental Health Care. A Course Assessment is normally taken at the end of a one-year course in the early summer.

In addition to traditional National Qualification Courses, a new suite of &quot;pre-vocational&quot; courses entitled &quot;Skills for Work&quot; was rolled out. Primarily available at Intermediate 1 and Intermediate 2 levels, these prevocational courses, aim to give students an awareness of the workplace environment, the skills required for entry to an industry as well as generic employment skills. Each of these Courses is awarded on the Scottish Qualifications Certificate.

==== Reorganisation of National Qualifications ====

National Qualifications were redesigned as follows in 2013:

According to the SQA, the new qualifications have &quot;more focus on skills development compared to the existing qualifications ... There is also a greater emphasis on by helping learners to think for themselves; to apply and interpret the knowledge and understanding they have developed and to demonstrate the skills they have learned.&quot;

National 1-4 are assessed internally by the student&#x27;s own institution, subject to regulation by the SQA. National 5 courses and above have internal assessments, followed by an externally marked exam.

==== National Assessment Bank ====
With the introduction of Highers, Intermediate 1 and Intermediate 2 courses, the SQA also introduced a National Assessment Bank of short examinations for each subject. These were more commonly known as NABs or unit assessments, and contained questions from specific academic units at a basic level. Each candidate had to pass a certain number of NABs (usually three) before they could be presented for the final examination.

==== Release of results ====

Students for &quot;National Qualifications&quot; receive their results on, generally, the first Tuesday in August. Students signed up for the authority&#x27;s &quot;MySQA&quot; system are able to check their record online throughout the year and get their exam results by text and/or email on the day that the results are issued. Those signed up to the service received their results one day earlier than the official postal results. This also occurred in subsequent years, however only due to a mistake by the company holding the results. In another incident, the SQA itself sent the results out on the right day, but Robert Gordon University&#x27;s business school leaked whether students had been let in, and a technical error with St Andrew&#x27;s University&#x27;s website also leaked the results of applicants.

Due to the high volume of exam marking with the Scottish examination boards and those across the rest of the UK, where it is thought that exam marking inaccuracies may occur, there are each year a vast number of students requesting for an exam &quot;re-mark&quot;. After the SQA introduced fees, requests for exam remarking fell by 55,000 students—a decline of 77%.

In order to fight (supposed) grade inflation within the Scottish education sector, SQA has introduced academically and cognitively more rigorous examination standards and stricter marking; this resulted in strong criticism towards the SQA exam board and in decreases of exam pass rates of up to 15%.

=== National units and programmes ===
There are the many qualifications often imperfectly referred to as vocational, though these are frequently stepping-stones for students at Scottish Colleges of Further Education to pursue one- or two- year programmes tailored from a wide-ranging catalogue of National Units. The actual programme may be very rigidly prescribed by employers or be entirely freely chosen by the student to meet particular needs. The prescribed programmes may be recognised by a National Certificate or a Scottish Progression Award.

=== SVQs and modern apprenticeships ===
Scottish Vocational Qualifications (SVQ) are an award for vocational education and training awarded by the SQA or other approved awarding bodies in conjunction with industry bodies. Scottish National Qualifications and Scottish Progression Awards are often important in a Modern Apprenticeship scheme along with SVQs. SVQs are developed by United Kingdom employers in tandem with National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) for England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

SVQ are assessed in the workplace (or closely regulated training workshops) by employers, training providers or colleges approved and monitored by the SQA (or other awarding bodies) accredited by its independent &quot;Accreditation Unit&quot;.

=== Higher National Certificates and Diplomas ===
Qualifications aimed at students in their first two years of Higher Education include HNCs (Higher National Certificates)—taken as a one-year full-time course or as a two-year part-time course—and HNDs (Higher National Diplomas). These qualifications are extremely popular in colleges, workplaces and community education centres in Scotland, the rest of the UK and throughout the world.

=== Students with disabilities ===
These include specific qualifications for those with severe to moderate difficulties (Access), the right to aid in completing assessments (for example, a scribe) and the right to challenge any unfair or artificial barrier in the rules for any qualification.

=== English as a second language ===
There is a suite of National Units addressing the needs of economic migrants, asylum seekers and (the biggest group) those seeking to master English before returning to their own countries. It has also developed qualifications for those seeking to teach English to refugees.

== Partnerships ==
SQA is one of the four partner national organisations involved in the Curriculum for Excellence. It works with partners on all strands of the development. Its principal role is to contribute to work on qualifications and assessment. SQA&#x27;s role in Curriculum for Excellence is to design and develop the new qualifications and assessment.

SQA has joined with Universities Scotland, QAA Scotland and the Scottish Government to create the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework or SCQF. Every Scottish qualification—from the Access level for those with learning difficulties to a Doctorate and including vocational as well as ESOL and BSL qualifications—is allocated a level and credit value within this framework, which all partners have agreed to recognise.

==Controversy==
===2015 Higher Maths exam===
The Higher Maths exam sat by students in May 2015 was said to be far too difficult. This evoked heated debates among students, teachers and educationalists; the corresponding grade boundaries for the respective exam were thus adjusted accordingly, with a pass mark as low as 34%. The SQA later admitted that one of their Higher Maths exam papers had been unusually hard and unfit for purpose.

===2016 exams===
Several exams that were set from the SQA in 2016 were criticised by pupils, parents, teachers and MSPs.

====National 5 Maths exam====
The National 5 Maths exam, sat on 12 May 2016, in particular Paper 1 (non-calculator), was also criticised by students after being considered much more difficult than previous years. A petition was created by students which was to be sent to the SQA demanding to know why the exam was exceedingly difficult, and it gained over 25,000 signatures.

====National 5 Computing Science exam====
Scottish Green MSP, Ross Greer criticised the SQA for mistakes in the National 5 Computing Science exam and called for an investigation into the exam, he defended teachers and students who thought that this was the worst exam ever set by the SQA. The SQA later admitted that the exam had mistakes.

=== 2018 exams ===

==== National 5 History exam ====
The SQA faced criticism for the 2018 National 5 History exam as the wrong date was given for the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots. While the SQA insist their mistake did not disadvantage any pupil, teachers disagreed, saying that the mistake meant that pupils second guessed their knowledge. The mistake was criticised by many including historian Tom Devine, who called the error &quot;unacceptable&quot;.

===2019 exams===
Certain exams set by SQA in 2019 have received widespread criticism from pupils, parents, and teaching staff within schools and colleges.

====National 5 and Higher Biology and Human Biology exams====
The National 5 and Higher Biology and Human Biology exams, which took place on 30 April 2019, received criticism from candidates on social media, and featured on national news. They claimed they bore no resemblance to previous papers, and relied too heavily on problem solving and mathematics skills as opposed to biology content. A petition was created by pupils, demanding that the pass mark be lowered. SQA defended the examinations, claiming that they were fair tests of the subject.

===2020 exams===
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the SQA cancelled the 2020 exam diet. This was the first time in SQA&#x27;s history that all exams were cancelled. Grades were given based on results in preliminary examinations and predicted grades from teachers.

After pupils received their results on 4 August, it emerged that the SQA had moderated downwards 124,000 grades from up to 75,000 pupils. This received criticism from candidates, teachers and politicians in all political parties in Scotland.

The subsequent criticism was heavily featured on social media and national news.

On 11 August, it was subsequently announced during an emergency statement by the Scottish education secretary that the SQA would reverse all downgraded results, while leaving upwards moderated results in situ. The change&#x27;s resulting unprecedented increase in year-on-year performance was said to be &#x27;outweighed&#x27; by the concerns of those affected and the loss of faith in the system.

=== 2021 exams ===
On 7 October 2020, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the SQA announced that the National 5 exams for 2021 were to be cancelled, but Highers and Advanced Highers would still go ahead. However, on 8 December 2020, Scottish Education Secretary John Swinney announced that the Highers and Advanced Highers would also be cancelled, meaning all SQA exams in 2021 would not go ahead, with grades for all levels being decided instead by teacher judgement.

=== 2022 exams ===
After announcing in February 2022, that exams would be shifting to &#x27;Scenario 2&#x27;. On 7 March 2022, the SQA&#x27;s guidance on the 2022 exams were leaked via Twitter. The content of the guidance was described as &quot;woefully inadequate&quot; and in many cases provided no clarification for what to expect in an exam paper.

=== 2024 exams ===
====National 5 and Higher Engineering Science exams====
The Higher and National 5 Engineering Science exams in May 2024 were disrupted and faced criticism due to an error by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), which resulted in an incorrect edition of the data booklet being provided to candidates. Some examination centres were able to resolve this issue by distributing the correct data booklet.

Blank emails on Results Day

On Results Day at 8am, candidates receiving their results by email got a blank email which didn’t contain their grades. This reportedly affected over 7,000 students who signed up exclusively to receive their grades by email. The SQA’s Chief Examiner Fiona Robertson apologised for the incident and it was remedied by 10am.

<text>The Scottish Examination Board (SEB), formerly known as the Scottish Certificate of Education Examination Board (SCEEB), was the academic examination board for Scottish schools from 1965 to 1997.

==History==
From their introduction in 1888 until 1964, Scottish school qualifications were awarded directly by the UK Government&#x27;s Scottish Education Department.

The Scottish Certificate of Education Examination Board (SCEEB) was established in 1964 to take over the awarding of Scottish school qualifications from 1965. The SCEEB became known as the Scottish Examination Board (SEB) in 1982.

The SEB used to administer all of Scotland&#x27;s academic qualifications, including Standard Grades and Highers.

On 1 April 1997, the Scottish Examination Board merged with the Scottish Vocational Education Council (SCOTVEC) to form the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA).

<text>Standard Grades were Scotland&#x27;s educational qualifications for students aged around 14 to 16 years. Introduced in 1986, the Grades were replaced in 2013 with the Scottish Qualifications Authority&#x27;s National exams in a major shake-up of Scotland&#x27;s education system as part of the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework overhaul.

Scottish Standard Grades roughly matched the English, Welsh and Northern Irish General Certificate of Secondary Education examinations in terms of level subject content and cognitive difficulty.

==History==
Following the Munn and Dunning reports published in 1977, the Standard Grade replaced the old O-Grade qualification, and was phased in from 1986.

Standard Grade courses were taken over a student&#x27;s third and fourth year in secondary education. Exams were taken at the end of the 4th Year (around May), with preliminary examinations taken several months earlier in November. (However, certain subjects may have been &quot;fast tracked&quot; at some schools (for example Dalziel High school, which was the first school to use this system), where the course is started in at the beginning of 2nd year and finished at the end of 3rd year (this meant that pupils start standard grades at age 12/13 and finish them at age 14/15). The exams were provided by the Scottish Qualifications Authority, which also offers the more recent National Qualifications on the Scottish Qualifications Certificate.

Students would typically study 8 subjects at Standard Grade. Generally speaking, different subjects could be taken independently of each other, although English and Mathematics were compulsory, and most schools would structure student choices so that at least one science subject, one social science (and often a modern language) were chosen. The two main restrictions on this choice were timetable arrangements, and the fact that many less popular subjects were not offered by all schools.

== Levels of award ==
There are three sub-levels (or &quot;tiered&quot; papers) at which Standard Grade exams can be taken, namely &quot;Foundation Level&quot;, &quot;General Level&quot; and &quot;Credit Level&quot;. At one sitting, students generally sit either the Foundation and General level papers together, or the General and Credit level papers together.

Students are awarded a numerical grade for each examination (which may consist of several papers) ranging from 1 (best) to 7. The table below lists the grades, the exam level and equivalence to the new National Qualification exams and the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF for short).
==Higher Still ==
The Scottish Government Authorities responsible for Education decided to slowly phase out the Standard Grade system in favour of the Scottish Qualifications Authority&#x27;s Higher Still system as many students and teachers felt that the jump from Standard Grade to Higher was too difficult, particularly in subjects such as English. Although they are not exactly the same, the Foundation Level is similar to Higher Still&#x27;s Access 3 level, whilst General is similar to Intermediate 1 and Credit is similar to Intermediate 2.

Standard Grade exams were replaced progressively by the Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) system. Unlike Standard Grades the CfE does not involve external exams for the majority of levels. The new curriculum involves 5 levels; National 1, National 2, National 3, National 4, and National 5. National 1 to National 4 are awarded on the basis of coursework and tests generated and marked by the school, whereas students can achieve National 5 by passing examinations externally set by the SQA.

==Standard Grade subjects==

===Compulsory subjects===

The Scottish Government states that all pupils must take the subjects below. However, there are exceptions.
* English (4 hours per week minimum)
* Mathematics (4 hours per week minimum)
* Science (At least one from: &quot;Chemistry, Biology, Physics, General Science&quot;) (3 hours per week minimum)
* Social Sciences (At least one from: &quot;History, Geography, Modern Studies or Classical Studies&quot;) (3 hours per week minimum)
* Physical Education (PE) * (1 hour per week minimum)
* Religious, Moral and Philosophical Education (RMPS) * (1 hour per week minimum)
* Education for Personal and Social Development (PSE)* (1 hour per week minimum)
Most schools in Scotland have periods between 50–55 minutes long, although this is generally accepted as an hour of a compulsory subject.

The course choice process begins after the Christmas and New Year of S2, with the completed forms being handed in around the end of February.

<text>The Greatest Generation is a 1998 book by journalist Tom Brokaw that profiles those who grew up in the United States during the deprivation of the Great Depression and then went on to fight in World War II as well as those whose productivity within the home front during World War II made a decisive material contribution to the war effort. The book popularized the term &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; for the name of the cultural generation before the Silent Generation.

==Summary==
Brokaw profiles those who came of age during World War II in the United States, stemming from his attendance at the D-Day 40th anniversary celebrations. In the book, Brokaw wrote that &quot;it is, I believe, the greatest generation any society has ever produced.&quot; He argued that these men and women fought not for fame and recognition, but because it was the &quot;right thing to do.&quot;

<doc id="497109" wikidata="Q1780723" url="?curid=497109" title="Party Monster (film)">
<text>Party Monster is a 2003 American biographical crime drama film written and directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, who are also producers along with Jon Marcus and Christine Vachon. It stars Macaulay Culkin as the drug-addled &quot;king of the Club Kids&quot;. The film tells the story of the rise and fall of the infamous New York City party promoter Michael Alig. This was Macaulay Culkin&#x27;s first film in nearly nine years since his starring role in the 1994 film &quot;Richie Rich&quot;.

The film is based on &quot;Disco Bloodbath&quot;, the memoir of James St. James which details his friendship with Alig, that later fell apart as Alig&#x27;s drug addiction worsened, and ended after he murdered Andre &quot;Angel&quot; Melendez and went to prison. Bailey and Barbato had previously directed a 1998 documentary on the murder, also called &quot;Party Monster: The Shockumentary&quot;, from which certain elements were used for this film.

==Plot==
The film opens with Michael Alig as a small-town outcast who lived with his mom before moving to New York. Michael learns the New York party scene from James St. James, who teaches him the &quot;rules of fabulousness&quot;, which mostly revolve around attracting as much attention to oneself as possible.

Despite James&#x27; warning, Alig hosts a party at The Limelight, a local club owned by Peter Gatien. With Alig as its main attraction, The Limelight soon becomes the hottest club in New York. Alig is named &quot;King of the Club Kids&quot; and goes on a cross country journey in search of more club kids. Alig and James pick up Angel Melendez, Gitsie, and Brooke. Gitsie becomes Michael&#x27;s latest sidekick although the movie implies the relationship was little more than platonic. However, after Michael descends further into drug abuse, his life starts to spiral out of control, eventually culminating in his involvement in the murder of Angel. Gitsie and Michael decide to go to rehab but ultimately return to NY with the same drug problems as before, causing Michael to lose his job and end up in a motel in New Jersey where he is arrested and sent to prison after being ousted by James. James then begins to write his &quot;Great American Novel&quot;, published first as &quot;Disco Bloodbath&quot; and later as &quot;Party Monster&quot;.

==Cast==
==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack peaked at number 21 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance/Electronic Albums.


==Release==
&quot;Party Monster&quot; made its world premiere at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 2003, and later played at the Cannes Film Festival in May of that year. On September 5, 2003, the film was put on limited release to different art house theaters in major US cities.

==Reception==
The film received mainly negative reviews; it currently holds a 29% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 79 reviews; the consensus states &quot;The lurid display of camp soon turns tedious.&quot; It was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival, however, and &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, calling Culkin&#x27;s performance &quot;fearless&quot;, though he remarks that &quot;the movie lacks insight and leaves us feeling sad and empty—sad for ourselves, not Alig—and maybe it had to be that way&quot;.

The film was only given a limited release. According to Box Office Mojo, the film only grossed $742,898 domestically (and $782,606 worldwide total) out of a budget of $5 million in its theatrical release.

==Home media==
The film was released on DVD in the United States and Canada in February 2004 through 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment; the DVD contained various cast interviews, an audio commentary, behind-the-scenes footage, the film&#x27;s original theatrical trailer, and a real interview with Michael Alig as bonus materials. In 2009, the DVD has been discontinued and is now largely unavailable for purchase at standard retail stores. This movie is widely available for streaming on various platforms.

<text>Jelitkowo () is one of the quarters of Żabianka-Wejhera-Jelitkowo-Tysiąclecia in the city of Gdańsk, just south of Sopot, Poland.

As part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland it was a private church village of the Cistercian Monastery in Oliwa, administratively located in the Gdańsk County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship.

Located on the seaside, with beautiful sandy beaches, the town became known as an Ostsee-Bad Glettkau, a Baltic Sea (spa-vacation town). Some important hotels, windsurfing schools, and centres of water sports are in today&#x27;s Jelitkowo. In the past, an old tram route ran from Danzig, the main city, to the tram loop in Glettkau. It now runs from Gdańsk to Jelitkowo.

The population (together with Żabianka) is 23,145 inhabitants on an area of 2.1 km2 (population density 10,923 inhabitants/km2).

Sea-front Jelitkowo encompasses coastal Jelitkowo Beach, famous in the summer with local people, who package the Out Door health club, windsurfing schools, and volleyball courts. Park Jelitkowski includes calm, shaded paths, and a couple of historical, white-washed fishermen&#x27;s cottages sit close to its northwestern border. Ice cream kiosks and bucolic beer bars miss the shore, with al-fresco taverns offering breaded cod or herring dishes.

<text>In the Scottish secondary education system, the Higher () is one of the national school-leaving certificate exams and university entrance qualifications of the Scottish Qualifications Certificate (SQC) offered by the Scottish Qualifications Authority. It superseded the old Higher Grade on the Scottish Certificate of Education (SCE). Both are normally referred to simply as &quot;Highers&quot;. 

The modern Higher is Level 6 on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
In 1888, the Scottish Leaving Certificate was established in response to the terms of the Education Act of 1872. It was designed to have higher and lower levels assessed as individual subjects including Mathematics, Ancient or Modern Foreign Language, Science, etc. The higher level aimed at university entrance and the lower to suit the General Medical Council entrance requirements. This was later revised to higher level for entry to university and lower for banking insurance and business.
Between 1963 and 1982 Higher Grades were awarded by the Scottish Certificate of Education Examination Board (SCEEB), which later became the Scottish Examination Board (SEB), and was the historical terminal exam for the majority of Scottish secondary school pupils, especially those seeking work in skilled industries or progress onto higher education. They were usually taken in the 5th Year of secondary school (often referred to as S5, and entered at age 15 or 16). The SCE Higher progressed on from the SCE Ordinary Grade.

Pupils studied for one academic year (in practice two terms – Winter and Spring), sitting exams in the May of S5. The majority of courses were examined by written papers with practical work present in subjects such as Art and Design.

There existed a further extension qualification, the Certificate of Sixth Year Studies, which was awarded on a separate certificate.

=== 1992 revision ===
As a result of the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992 a series of Revised Higher Grade courses was put in place. When listed on the SCE the subject name would be followed by (Revised).

The revision process changed the curriculum content and the method of examination with the majority of Higher Grade courses changing to two terminal papers with a coursework element. Paper A was a short answer question paper and Paper B required longer, more in-depth answers. Coursework could account for anything from 0% (English) to 30% (Computing Studies) of the final mark.

The majority of Scottish Higher Education Institutions were generally only accepting Revised Higher Grade for entry, except where a pupil was classed as a mature student (aged over 25).

=== 1999 revision ===
In 1999, a reform of the examination system known as &quot;Higher Still&quot; took place. In the process, a new style of Higher examination system was introduced in Scotland. The new Higher was designed to operate within a framework of qualifications known as National Qualifications. This was designed to link the most basic examination offered by the SQA (Access 1) with the most difficult one (Advanced Higher) on a continuous &quot;ladder of achievement&quot;.

Qualifications offered under the &quot;Higher Still&quot; framework have a common structure, typically consisting of a mixture of summative and formative assessment. Qualifications usually consist of units of work ending in a basic competency test that functions as an internal assessment (commonly known as a &quot;NAB&quot; as they are drawn from the National Assessment Bank), and a terminal examination which serves to determine the final grade. To obtain a qualification, all the internal units for that qualification must be passed, and a passing grade must be obtained on the terminal examination. It is possible to sit the examination only, in which case &quot;Exam Only&quot; will be recorded on the Certificate. In some schools, all units must be passed (with two or less attempts) or the student is not allowed to sit the final national exam.

==== Criticism of modularisation ====
The system was criticised at the time of introduction as objections were made to the modularisation of subjects such as English and Art which require an accumulation of critical and productive skills over a full year rather than the passing of discrete modules, which was seen as a system much better suited to scientific subjects. However, strictly speaking, English teaching is not modularised, given that the internal assessments do not assess fixed blocks of knowledge, as in the sciences, rather, they assess specific skills and can be delivered at different points in the year. The modularisation of the Higher examination and the other qualifications under the &quot;Higher Still&quot; umbrella is also not the same as that of the English A-level, in which terminal examinations are themselves arranged into modules. Under the Scottish system, the final examination is still essentially synoptic in nature and draw from all units. Additionally, the internal units do not contribute to the grade awarded.

Higher became Level 6 on the SCQF and is now a &quot;National Course&quot;.

==== 2000 marking controversy ====
The administrative structure accompanying the new system was not entirely successful, and 2000 saw a marking fiasco that cost the head of the authority his job and severely damaged the career of the Education Minister, Sam Galbraith. Thousands of pupils received incorrect or late results, leading to difficulties for the pupils, UCAS (the University and Colleges Admissions Service) and Higher Education Institutions, as many pupils did not receive accurate exam results until after the universities&#x27; academic year had started.

== Role in university admissions ==
The most able candidates in S5 typically take five Higher subjects, and matriculation requirements for courses are specified from a range from CC to AAAAAA depending on the course and university. UK universities outside of Scotland may require students to study to Advanced Higher level, given that the Higher is equivalent to AS-level on the UCAS tariff. As Scottish university courses traditionally have a duration of 4 years, the loss of one year&#x27;s schooling is compensated by an additional university year. The flexibility of the [National Qualifications] framework means that candidates may take a mixture of Higher courses and National 5 courses in S5, with a view to studying the Higher equivalent in S6, thus gaining university qualifications across two years. This system maximises the opportunities available to candidates of differing abilities.

An advantage of the system is that candidates will apply to University in S6 on the basis of determined Higher results. This avoids the problem of having to apply on the basis of predicted grade results, and eliminates much uncertainty involved in the setting of conditional offers.

== Current courses ==
All National Qualification Higher subjects follow the same modular structure and grading system. It is a common mistake to confuse vocational Higher National Courses with NQ Higher courses.

=== Structure ===
As a result of the Higher reforms, every Higher course now consists of:

* A compulsory core which all candidates must complete
* Optional elements which a candidate and/or centre choose to study
* Three Unit Assessments, (commonly referred to as UASPs). These are assessed by a centre and moderated by the SQA
* A final exam and, where applicable, coursework which determine the grade and level of pass.

Formerly, a candidate must pass all Unit Assessments as well as the final Course Assessment to pass a course. A student who fails a Unit Assessment is allowed one re-sit opportunity on a fresh, unseen assessment but may only get a second re-sit opportunity in exceptional circumstances. In theory, therefore, a student who passed all but one Unit, and went on to pass the final exam, would not be awarded the overall pass for the course until they had completed the outstanding Unit in a subsequent year.

=== Grades ===

Higher examinations, in common with all National Qualification levels, have 5 grades: A, B, C, D and No Award. On standardised mark scales, a D-grade represents scores of 40-49%. Furthermore, each is given tariff points towards the UCAS system.


These are general grade boundaries and will vary by a few percentage points depending on the difficulty of the exam. The ultimate determination of grade boundaries depends upon the quantity of raw marks that would demonstrate achievement of criteria laid out in course specifications.

Ronald Reagan Park is nearby.

== Etymology ==
There are numerous speculations surrounding the name &quot;Brzeźno&quot;. According to one, the word &quot;Brzeźno&quot; was the name of a lake, with the possessive suffix &quot;-no&quot;, added to &quot;brzoza&quot; (birch). Thus, the name of the lake derives from birch trees surrounding its waters. The lake was located by the settlement named &quot;Prusęcino&quot; (deriving from the Old Prussians that lived there). It is believed that Prusęcino changed its name to &quot;Bresno&quot; (first noted in 1323). Due to the double-meaning of the name &quot;Bresno&quot;, the name of the lake was changed to &quot;Zaspa&quot;. The other hypothesis for the naming of the settlement derives from the word &quot;brzeg&quot; (Polish: &quot;coast&quot;), in regards to the coastal location of Brzeźno.

==History==
Brzeźno was a private church village of the abbey in Oliwa, administratively located in the Gdańsk County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship of the Kingdom of Poland.

<text>Wrzeszcz (pronounced , ; ) is one of the boroughs of the Northern Polish city of Gdańsk. With a population of more than 65,000 in an area of (population density 6,622), Wrzeszcz is the most populous part of Gdańsk.

== History ==
The current name Wrzeszcz comes from the old name of the area – &quot;Wrzost&quot;, which derives from &quot;wrzos&quot;, a Polish and Kashubian word for heather. The area of modern Wrzeszcz used to be forest and fields of heather.

Historical sources mention &quot;Vriezst&quot; in 1263 AD and Vriest 1283 as a place of a mill and by the end of the 13th century the Cistercian Monks of Oliwa owned four or five water mills on the Strieß (Strzyża), the creek running through Wrzeszcz. Vriest is Low German as well as Dutch language word meaning &quot;frost&quot;.

In 1412 AD, this suburban village was granted to Danzig city councillor Gerd von der Beke, an ally of the Teutonic Knights. The place was known as Langfuhr in the German language.

Early area landowners included the Bischof family, who held the increasingly residential settlement in the late-16th century and early-17th century, and the Köhne family, which started acquiring possessions in the Langfuhr area in 1616 AD. Danzig patrician Zacharias Zappio acquired most of the land between today&#x27;s &quot;Slowackiego&quot; and &quot;Do Studzienki&quot; streets and built a palace there. When King John III Sobieski visited the palace in 1677 AD, the little valley where the palace was located was renamed Königstal (Dolina Krolewska), or King&#x27;s Valley, to commemorate the occasion. Strictly speaking, in the 17th century the name Langfuhr referred only to a small market square, 130 m by 35 m, on what today is known as .

Between 1767 and 1770, Danzig mayor Daniel Gralath made a personal project of turning the two kilometers of old road between Langfuhr and Danzig proper into the four-lane, tree-lined Grand Avenue, as it was then renamed. Each lane of the avenue was lined by 350 trees imported from the Netherlands, and the entire cost of the project was the immense sum (for the time) of 100,000 guilders.

In the 18th century, residential construction aimed at the wealthy city folk took precedence. The erected residences were mostly classical style with beautiful gardens and the obligatory tree-lined driveways. By 1804, Langfuhr had about 900 residents, most of them working in breweries, distilleries, retailers, and factories making a kind of ash used to bleach cloth.

On 6 December 1807, under French occupation, the Danzig-Prussian convention made the town part of the Napoleonic Free City of Danzig. After the Congress of Vienna of 1814–1815, Danzig was reincorporated into Prussia.

From the mid-19th century onwards, Langfuhr grew to become a fashionable and wealthy borough with beautifully decorated city villas for wealthier residents and even spacious accommodation for local labourers. In 1872, Langfuhr was joined to Danzig by a horse-drawn tram along the Grand Avenue.
In 1904, the Königliche Technische Hochschule zu Danzig Grand Hall was built, soon followed by the city hospital, which is now the medical academy. Until 1919 Langfuhr was the garrison of the 1st Life Hussar Regiment (since 1901 Brigade) with large barracks built in the 1890s. In 1910 the first airfield of Danzig was established on the hussar&#x27;s parade ground. After World War I Erhard Milch&#x27;s &quot;Danziger Luftpost GmbH&quot; (Danzig Airmail) and the &quot;Lloyd Ostflug&quot; were located at Langfuhr.

== Effects of World War II ==

After World War II the town became part of Poland according to the Potsdam Conference and renamed to the Polish &quot;Wrzeszcz&quot;. Its German inhabitants either fled before the advancing Red Army or were expelled. The renaming was based on medieval records but caused the protests of the arriving Polish settlers as it was regarded unpronounceable and has a similarity to the Polish term &quot;wrzeszczeć&quot; (to bellow, to scream).

== Present ==

The airport was closed and replaced by the Gdańsk Lech Wałęsa Airport in 1974 and large housing complexes have been built on the former airport area. One of the old airport hangars was subsequently converted into a shopping centre, which opened in 1994 and was enlarged and renamed to in 2016.

The borough is now developing rapidly. A great deal of commercial activity (particularly banking and shopping) now takes place in Wrzeszcz. A number of international firms such as Citibank, ING Bank, Fortis Bank, and Shell have chosen to locate their offices there rather than in the Gdańsk city center, large shopping centers such as Galeria Bałtycka and Centrum Handlowe Manhattan are opening along Grunwaldzka Street, and extensive military properties have been sold to housing developers.

<text>Piecki-Migowo () is a quarter of the city of Gdańsk, Poland. It consists of two parts: Piecki and Migowo. Populated by 23,593 inhabitants in an area of 3.8 km² (population density 6,224), 
Piecki-Migowo together are popularly called &quot;Morena&quot; (&quot;Moraine&quot;). It is located on top of a hill more than 100 meters above sea level that used to be an example of Arcadian nature. It is an example of a multi-story housing estate that is claimed to fail to properly use the beauty of the landscape. The housing estate was built in the second half of the 1970s and in the 1980s. The construction areas are slowly being extended to the area of the former military training areas. The prevailing type of new structures are family houses or small buildings.

==Piecki==

In 1439 the Teutonic knights handed over the settlement of Pietzkendorf to Maciej from Łostowice (Schönfeld) and Jakub Czan, it consisted of 36 gardens on about 200 ha. The center of the village was located along modern Piecewska street. Piecki was a private church village, administratively located in the Gdańsk County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship of the Kingdom of Poland. In 1577 the village was destroyed during the Danzig rebellion against Polish King Stephen Báthory. In 1698 Johann Uphagen became the chairman of the St. Elisabeth and Holy Ghost hospitals in Danzig, which leased the village. In the second half of the 18th century the Uphagen family built a Rococo mansion in Pietzkendorf, which consisted of three peasant farms and two taverns in 1793. At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, the manor house was expanded. In 1945 Pietzkendorf was renamed &quot;Piecewo&quot; by the new Polish authorities, in 1948 the current name was officially adopted. In 1954 the village was incorporated in the administrative boundaries of the city of Gdańsk.

==Migowo==
The settlement was first mentioned in 1379 as Emugow, in 1437 as Muckaw and later as Müggau. In 1506 it was leased by Peter Mellin, a councillor of Danzig, in the late 16th century a brickyard existed (around today&#x27;s Belgradzka St. and Bułgarska St.). In the late 18th century, Müggau became a suburban residence of Danzig burghers, a mansion located in a Baroque park (currently ul. Myśliwska 6) was built. Müggau was incorporated in the City of Danzig administration on 26 March 1942, which was not recognized by Polish authorities after 1945. Müggau was renamed Migowo on 1 July 1947 and again incorporated into the City limits on 15 January 1954.

==Modern development==
In 1972 a development project of the Association of Polish Architects started, in the following years industrialized apartment blocks were built in the area of the villages. Morena is characterized by a very cold and extremely windy climate, in sharp contrast with neighbouring areas of Gdańsk. Air pollution is virtually nonexistent because of a sea breeze of over 40 km per hour.

The hill is connected with Wrzeszcz by a convenient bicycle route.

<text>Xfig is a free and open-source vector graphics editor which runs under the X Window System on most UNIX-compatible platforms.

In Xfig, figures may be drawn using objects such as circles, boxes, lines, spline curves, text, etc. It is also possible to import images in a number of formats, including JPEG, EPS, PostScript, and SVG. Those objects can be created, deleted, moved or modified. Attributes such as colors or line styles can be selected in various ways. For text, 35 fonts are available.

Xfig saves figures in its native text-only &quot;Fig&quot; format. Xfig has a facility to print figures to a PostScript printer, too.&lt;br&gt;
A convenient feature is the PSTricks or PGF/TikZ packages code that allows a smooth integration of Xfig-generated images into LaTeX documents. However, through the EPS export facility, figures can be imbedded into groff documents also, when rendered to PostScript, e. g. though &quot;grops&quot;.

Most operations in Xfig are performed using the mouse, but some operations may also be performed using keyboard accelerators (shortcuts). The interface is designed for a three-button mouse, although it is also possible to use a two-button or a one-button mouse with appropriate emulation, for example on a Macintosh under OS X.

== History ==
Xfig was written by Supoj Sutanthavibul in 1985 for SunView. Ken Yap ported xfig to X11. In 1989, Brian V. Smith added many features. In 1991, Paul King added many features including overhauling the GUI for version 2.0. In 1997, Tom Sato added Japanese text support, spell checker, and search/replace.

== Imports ==
Xfig can import various files as images:
*Raster formats: GIF, JPEG, PCX, PNG, PPM, TIFF, XBM, and XPM
*Vector graphics formats: EPS, PostScript

== Exports ==
Xfig can export into various formats:
*Raster formats: GIF, JPEG, PNG, PPM, XBM, XPM, PCX, TIFF, SLD
*Formats for printed documents: PostScript, PDF, HP-GL (printer control language used by Hewlett-Packard plotters),
*Vector graphics formats: EPS, SVG, PIC, CGM, Metafont, MetaPost, EMF, Tk
*LaTeX files: PGF/TikZ, PStricks

<doc id="497157" wikidata="Q1190037" url="?curid=497157" title="Wilson Cruz">
<text>Wilson Cruz (born Wilson Echevarría; December 27, 1973) is an American actor known for playing Rickie Vasquez on &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;, Dr. Hugh Culber on &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, and the recurring character Junito on &quot;Noah&#x27;s Arc&quot;. As a gay man of Afro-Puerto Rican ancestry, he has served as an advocate for gay youth, especially gay minorities.

==Early life==
Cruz was born in Brooklyn, New York, to parents born in Puerto Rico. His family eventually moved to Rialto, California, where he attended Eisenhower High School, graduating in 1991. At age 19, Cruz came out to his parents as gay, first to his mother and then to his father. While his mother was initially hurt and shocked, she eventually accepted the news. His father, however, threw him out of the house, and Cruz spent the next few months living in his car and at the homes of friends. He later reconciled with his father.

==Career==
Cruz went to Hollywood to seek work as an actor, intending to be open about his sexuality from the beginning of his career. In 1994, he was cast as Enrique &quot;Rickie&quot; Vasquez, a troubled, gay teen, in the short-lived, critically acclaimed cult classic TV series &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;. This made Cruz the first openly gay actor to play an openly gay character in a leading role in an American television series.

Following &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;&#x27;s cancellation, Cruz went on to play J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s servant Joaquin in Oliver Stone&#x27;s film &quot;Nixon&quot; and had a small role in the television movie &quot;On Seventh Avenue&quot;. In 1996, he appeared with David Arquette as Mikey in &quot;Johns&quot;, about the day-to-day struggles of male prostitutes. In 2000, he played Victor in the final season of &quot;Party of Five&quot;. He also had a recurring role as Rafael de la Cruz on the series, &quot;Raising the Bar&quot;.

Cruz&#x27;s other acting credits include the films &quot;Joyride&quot; (1996), &quot;All Over Me&quot; (1997), &quot;Supernova&quot; (2000), &quot;Party Monster&quot; (2003), Margaret Cho&#x27;s &quot;Bam Bam and Celeste&quot; (2005), &quot;Coffee Date&quot; (2007), and &quot;He&#x27;s Just Not That Into You&quot; (2009); the television film &quot;The Perfect Pitch&quot; (2002); and guest appearances on the series &quot;Great Scott!&quot;, &quot;Sister, Sister&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;Noah&#x27;s Arc&quot;, and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. Cruz starred as Adrian in the film &quot;The Ode&quot; (2007), based on the novel &quot;Ode to Lata&quot; by Ghalib Shiraz Dhalla.

He also appeared/starred in the 2009 movie &quot;The People I&#x27;ve Slept With&quot;. He plays the best friend of a promiscuous woman who tries to find out who got her pregnant so that she can get married.

Since 2017, Cruz has portrayed Dr. Hugh Culber on the science fiction series &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;.

Since 2020, Cruz has been a recurring guest on &quot;25 Words or Less&quot;.

In 2023, Cruz became the new chair of the board of directors for GLSEN.

==Personal life==

Cruz works with and advocates on behalf of LGBTQ youth, especially youth of color. He has volunteered his time as host for the Youth Zone, an online community at Gay.com for LGBT youth. He was the Grand Marshal of the 1998 West Hollywood Gay Pride parade, the 2005 Chicago Pride Parade and the 2019 Fierté Montréal Pride Parade in Québec. In 2008, he was the keynote speaker at the University of Illinois at Chicago&#x27;s Lavender Graduation and Rainbow Banquet honoring graduating LGBT students.

Cruz joined the board of directors of GLAAD in 1997 to assist the organization through a leadership transition, and joined the staff of GLAAD in 2012 as a National Spokesperson and Strategic Giving Officer.

Cruz&#x27;s maternal stepaunt Brenda Lee Marquez McCool was among the 49 victims killed in the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting; Cruz stated that she was killed while protecting her son Isaiah, who survived the gunfire.

In 2020, Wilson was honored on one of the covers of &quot;Out&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual Out100 issue, saying Wilson &quot;beautifully weaves his activism inside every aspect of his work&quot;.

<doc id="497158" wikidata="Q1019157" url="?curid=497158" title="Angwantibo">
<text>Angwantibos are two species of strepsirrhine primates classified in the genus Arctocebus of the family Lorisidae. They are also known as golden pottos because of their yellow or golden coloration.

Angwantibos live in tropical Africa and their range includes Nigeria, Cameroon north of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Angwantibos grow to a size of 22 to 30 cm, and have almost no tail at all. They only weigh up to 0.5 kg. Their fur is yellow brown to golden in color. Their snout is more pointed than that of the other lorids and this, along with their round ears, gives it the bear-like appearance that lends them their name in German: &quot;Bärenmaki&quot;, &quot;bear lemur&quot;.

Solitary, nocturnal and arboreal, they prefer the underbrush and the lower layers of the forests. They spend the day hidden in the leaves. Like all lorisids they are characterized by slow movements.

The diet of angwantibos consists predominantly of insects (mostly caterpillars), and occasionally fruits. Owing to their careful movements and their good sense of smell, they can quietly stalk and close-in on their prey and catch it with a lightning-quick movement.

The males mate with all available females whose territory overlaps with theirs. Copulation takes place hanging onto a branch. Gestation lasts 130 days and births are of a single offspring. The juvenile clasps itself first to the belly of the mother and later she may park her offspring on a branch while she goes searching for food. Within three to four months the young are weaned, at about six months it leaves its mother, and at an age of eight to ten months it becomes fully mature. The life expectancy of angwantibos is at most 13 years.

A subplot in Gerald Durrell&#x27;s first book &quot;The Overloaded Ark&quot; centres on his attempts to secure an angwantibo for zoological study.

<text>Merfolk, Mercreatures, Mermen or Merpeople are legendary water-dwelling, human-like beings. They are attested in folklore and mythology throughout the ages in various parts of the world. Merfolk, Merpeople, or simply Mer refers to humanoid creatures that live in deep waters like Mermaids, Sirens, Cecaelia etc. 

In English, female merfolk are called mermaids, although in a strict sense, mermaids are confined to beings who are half-woman and half-fish in appearance; male merfolk are called mermen. Depending on the story, they can be described as either ugly or beautiful.

Chinese &quot;rényú&quot; () stands for &quot;merfolk&quot;, but in ancient geographical or natural historical tracts, the term referred to &quot;human-fish&quot; or &quot;man-fish&quot; purported to inhabit rivers or lakes in certain parts of China. The Japanese analogue &quot;ningyo&quot; () likewise translates to &quot;human-fish&quot; while, at the same time, having also applied to various human-like fish recorded in writings from medieval times into the Edo Period.

==China==
Certain fantastical types of &quot;fish&quot;, generically referred to as &quot;renyu&quot; (, &quot;human-fish&quot;) are alleged to occur in various parts of China according to the &quot;Shan Hai Jing&quot; (&quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot;, 4th century BC). It is mentioned in the &quot;Bei Shan Jing&quot; (&quot;Classic of the Northern mountains&quot;), &quot;Zhong Shan Jing&quot; (Central Mountains), and &quot;Xi Shan Jing&quot; (Western Mountains) sections of this work.

This work and others also mention several additional types of &quot;anthropomorphic fish&quot; with limbs in other regions such as the (; &quot;red ru fish&quot;) and (; &quot;hill-fish&quot;), considered to be in the same category of creatures. Certain tribes or races of humans were also described being part-fish, namely the .

It is recorded that the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor was illuminated with lamps fueled by the oil of the human-fish (&quot;renyu&quot;), whose flames were meant to last a very long time.

In the Chinese Song Dynasty&#x27;s supernatural tale collection &quot;Yijian Zhi&quot; (夷堅志), there are stories of sea sirens similar to those in other folklore. One tale describes a beautiful female demon living on a cliff of an island. A man sailed to the island, married a woman there, and she taught him how to recognize plants and avoid dangers, protecting him from wild beasts. They had two sons together. However, when a fellow townsman arrived on the island and took the man back by boat, the woman cursed him, throwing their sons into the water in a fit of rage and yelling at him to leave. The man stayed silent after boarding the ship.

Another tale from Guangzhou tells of a merchant who, upon reaching an island, was captured by two women and taken into the mountains. They fed him daily, but he couldn&#x27;t tell if he was still alive. After about a year, he overheard the women discussing magic, and he begged them to take him to the place where it was performed. When they did, he sought help, causing the women to flee by flying away. Though he was revived, his food gradually dwindled, and he died two months later.

===&quot;Renyu&quot; or human-fish===
;(aka &quot;haieryu&quot;. subtypes &quot;tiyu&quot; and &quot;niyu&quot; )
The &quot;renyu&quot; (; human-fish) is described in the &quot;Bei Shan Jing&quot; (&quot;Classic of the North Mountains&quot;) section as dwelling on Mt. Longhou (, &quot;Dragon-Marquis Mountain&quot;) in the waters of the Jueshui (, &quot;Bursting River&quot;), which flows eastward into the Yellow River. It is said to &quot;resemble the &quot;tiyu&quot;&quot; (translated as &quot;resemble catfish&quot;) possess four legs, with a voice like baby crying.

Eating the fish purportedly cured idiocy or dementia. This fish as a cure was also quoted in the &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; or &quot;Bencao Gangmu&quot; (1596) under its entry for &quot;Tiyu&quot; () 

The &quot;Bencao Gangmu&quot; categorized the &quot;tiyu&quot; () as one of two types of &quot;human-fish&quot; (&quot;renyu&quot;). The human-fish were also known as &quot;child-fish&quot; or &quot;haieryu&quot; (; ).

The other type, called the &quot;niyu&quot; () is elaborated in a separate section. It has been noted by Li Shizhen that the character for the &quot;Niyu&quot; (&quot;Ni&quot; fish) consists of the &quot;fish&quot; indexing component () and &quot;child&quot; () radical.

Translators of the &quot;Bencao Gangmu&quot; attempt to match entries with actual taxa of animals, forbs, etc., where possible, and the &quot;tiyu&quot; type is glossed as &quot;newts&quot; while the &quot;niyu&quot; type is &quot;Chinese giant salamander&quot;.

===&quot;Chiru&quot; or red ru fish===

The (; &quot;red ru fish&quot;. Wade-Giles: &quot;ch&#x27;ih-ju&quot;; &quot;red ju&quot;) is described in the &quot;Nan Shan Jing&quot; (&quot;Classic of the Southern Mountains&quot;) as a human-headed fish. It is said to be found in the Qingqushan ( &quot;Green-Hills Mountains&quot;) in the Pool-of-Yi (Yì zhī zé ; &quot;Carp-Wings Lake&quot;). It is described as basically fish-form but having a human face, and issuing sounds like the mandarin duck. Eating it purportedly prevented scabies or itchy skin.

The illustration of the &quot;chiru&quot; from China may have influenced the legless, human-faced fish visualization of some of the &quot;ningyo&quot; in Japan, according to the hypothesis of .

===Jiaoren===
The &quot;jiaoren&quot; ( &quot;flood dragon people&quot; or &quot;shark people&quot;) that appear in medieval writings are considered to be references to merfolk.

This mythical southern mermaid or merman is recorded in &#x27;s &quot;Records of Strange Things&quot; (early 6th century CE).

In the midst of the South Sea are the houses of the &quot;kău&quot; () people who dwell in the water like fish, but have not given up weaving at the loom. Their eyes have the power to weep, but what they bring forth is pearls.

Similar passages appear in other texts such as the &quot;Bowuzhi&quot; (, &quot;Treatise of Manifold &quot; ) as &quot;weep[ing] tears that became pearls&quot;.

These aquatic people supposedly spun a type of raw silk called &quot;jiaoxiao&quot; &quot;mermaid silk&quot; or &quot;jiaonujuan&quot; &quot;mermaid woman&#x27;s silk&quot;. Schafer equates this with sea silk, the rare fabric woven from byssus filaments produced by Pinna &quot;pen shell&quot; mollusks.

=== &quot;Loting&quot; ===

Loting (盧亭) is a mysterious ethnic group residing in Hong Kong&#x27;s Myths. They are legendary merfolk half human and half fish, also known as Lo Yu, Lu Heng, or Lo Ting Fish Man. They have lived on Tai O&#x27; Lantau Island in Hong Kong since the local civil uprising in the Eastern Jin Dynasty of China. It is said that Loting has fish scales on his fish-like human body, a face that resembles humans, and he enjoys sucking chicken blood. They could use their catch to fish from Tai O and trade chickens with the local human inhabitants to survive.

==Japan==
The &quot;ningyo&quot; ( &quot;human-fish&quot;) of Japan has its own history in the country&#x27;s literary record. The earliest references (in the &quot;Nihon shoki&quot;, entry for year 619, reign of Empress Suiko) do not specifically use the term &quot;ningyo&quot;, and the &quot;thing&quot; appeared in fresh water (a river in Ōmi Province, canal Settsu Province), and may presumed to be a giant salamander. Later accounts claim that Empress Suiko&#x27;s regent Prince Shōtoku knew the creature to be a &quot;ningyo&quot; when one was presented to him by representatives of Ōmi. The appearance of the human-fish was strongly associated with ill omen in later treatments of the Prince&#x27;s encounter with the human-fish.

During the Kamakura Period, &quot;ningyo&quot; of the marine sort were frequently reported as washing ashore, and these were taken to be ominous signs usually prefiguring bloody battles.

The &quot;ningyo&quot;, or rather &quot;renyu&quot; () and the like found in Chinese sources (&quot;chiru&quot;, &quot;tiyu&quot; etc., etc., discussed above) were also discussed in Japanese literature, for example, works of scholars of herbal and traditional medicine, such as Kaibara Ekiken (d. 1714) and Ono Ranzan (d. 1810). These Japanese scholars were also aware of European discussions on &quot;sirens&quot;, &quot;anthropomorphic fish&quot;, &quot;&quot;peixe muller&quot; (fish-woman)&quot;, etc.

==In popular culture==
*Merfolk are a fictional race of humanoids that live underwater in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.
*Merfolk are humanoid aquatic creatures with fish-like characteristics in &quot;&quot;.
*Merfolk are humanoid aquatic creatures with fish-like characteristics in &quot;Spectromancer&quot;.
*In &quot;One Piece&quot;, the Merfolk are among the different races in the anime and one of the two types that dwell underwater (the other being the Fishmen).

*In Monster Musume, Meroune Lorelei is a mermaid princess wearing gothic loli clothes who moves around in a wheelchair when she&#x27;s out of water.
*The Techno Trolls introduced in Trolls World Tour bears a striking resemblance to mermaids but are able to survive and walk on dry land like the other tribes of trolls.

The two met when Lovato was 17 and Valderrama was 29, though they did not begin dating until Lovato turned 18. Lovato later released the song &quot;29&quot; (2022), which was widely interpreted as a condemnation of Valderrama now that the singer herself was 29, although Lovato did not directly confirm the inspiration and simply stated, &quot;I feel like the song says it all&quot;.

In January 2020, Valderrama became engaged to Amanda Pacheco, who is eleven years his junior. In December 2020, the couple announced they were expecting their first child. Their daughter was born on February 15, 2021. In February 27, 2025, Valderama and Pacheco are expecting their second child.

<doc id="497171" wikidata="Q1070005" url="?curid=497171" title="Patria Pasi">
<text>The Patria Pasi (earlier known as the Sisu Pasi) is a Finnish-made six-wheeled armoured personnel carrier (APC) originally designed for Finnish Defence Forces. The first variant was produced in 1983 and serial production began in 1984. It was designed to operate with ease of use, simple structure and low-cost maintenance. The basic appearance and configuration of the Pasi is similar to most other wheeled APCs. The XA-180 and XA-185 are fully amphibious, while other variants are not.

==Development==

In 1980, Sisu produced an XA-180 prototype for Finnish Army tests. It competed against two other prototypes, and was declared the winner of the trials in 1983. In December 1983, the Finnish Army ordered a first batch of fifty XA-180s. Nine were reserved for UN duties. The vehicle proved quite successful and more orders followed.

The vehicle&#x27;s widely known nickname &quot;Pasi&quot;, also a common given name of Finnish men, stems from the Finnish designation &quot;panssari-Sisu&quot; (). The main superstructure is mainly manufactured from 6 to 12 mm of armoured steel. The bottom is mine-strengthened. The front windows are bullet-resistant and equipped with protective hatches. The vehicle has continuous six-wheel drive and good capabilities for off-road driving. It can take inclines up to a maximum of 60°.

The Pasi has no standard armament, but is equipped with a rotating turret structure for eventual installations of light/heavy machine guns or autocannons. It has 8 BMP-style firing ports on the sides and rear. Therefore, passengers, usually a squad of infantry, can fire their weapons from the cover of the armor.

The Pasi is popular in peacekeeping missions due to its mobility, non-aggressive appearance, and good protection against mines and improvised explosive devices (IED). The vehicle offers a good combination of armament, comfort, mine protection, protection against shrapnel and small-calibre fire, road speed, short time of learning how to drive, and an acceptable terrain mobility. It offers more internal space compared to other similar APCs like the Fuchs or the BTR-80.

The early variants of the Pasi (such as the XA-180 and XA-185) were manufactured by Sisu Auto until 1997, when its defense subsidiary &quot;Sisu Defence Oy&quot; was acquired by Patria. The later variants (such as the XA-202 and XA-203) were then manufactured by Patria until 2003, when the then new Patria AMV entered serial production. By then, over 1,300 Pasis had been produced.

==Operational service==
The Pasi has seen service in several conflict areas, including Afghanistan, Bosnia, Croatia, Eritrea, Golan Heights, Iraq, Kosovo, Lebanon, Macedonia, Namibia, Liberia, Somalia and Chad.

The Pasi has been used by the Finnish police in sieges and SWAT operations.

In 2018, Estonia deployed five XA-188s to Mali as part of Estonia&#x27;s contribution to Operation Barkhane.

In 2022, Finland reportedly donated an unknown number of XA-180/185s to Ukraine as part of a military and humanitarian aid package following the escalations of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War. At least ten have been lost in combat.

==Versions==
;Sisu XA-180: Original six-wheeler, carries crew of 2 and 16 troops. Empty weight ca. 12 tonnes.
;Sisu XA-185: Upgraded version, carries crew of 2 and 18 troops. Has a more powerful engine and improved power transmission. Used as an ambulance in the Norwegian Army.
;Patria XA-186:Upgraded armour. Armoured and equipped with machine-assisted gun turret (.50 BMG). Cannot swim because of the heavy armour. Empty weight ca 19 tonnes. Engine and transmission same as XA-185.
;Patria XA-188:Used by the Royal Netherlands Army.
;Patria XA-202/203: The 200 series looks a little different from earlier variants due to increased armour. It lacks amphibious capabilities but can wade through water that is up to 1.5 m deep. The improved armour protects the passengers against up to 14.5 mm small-arms fire. It is equipped with modern optical aids like periscopes and night vision. The armor upgrade was initiated after the realisation that the previous armor was inadequate, even modern armor-piercing 7.62 mm ammunition could pierce the older XA-180 and XA-185 models in certain areas. The XA-202 was originally developed for Communications and Command. The XA-203 variant was made as a temporary replacement for the earliest XA-185s, and is intended to be replaced by Patria AMVs in Finnish service.

In addition to standard variants, there are numerous sub-versions for specific missions, e.g. ambulance, command &amp; communications, electronic warfare, air defence, radar surveillance, firefighting and anti-tank variants among others.

<text>In architecture, a niche (, or ) is a recess or cavity constructed in the thickness of a wall for the reception of decorative objects such as statues, busts, urns, and vases. In Classical architecture examples are an exedra or an apse that has been reduced in size, retaining the half-dome heading usual for an apse. In the first century B.C, there was no exact mention of niches, but rather a zotheca or small room. These rooms closely resemble alcoves similar to a niche but slightly larger. Different sizes and sculpture methods suggest the term niche was understood. Greeks and Romans especially, used niches for important family tombs.

==Etymology==
The word derives from the Latin (), via the French . The Italian &quot;nicchio&quot; () may also be involved in the origin of the word, as the traditional decoration for the top of a niche is a scallop shell, hence also the alternative term of &quot;conch&quot; for a semi-dome, usually reserved for larger exedra. As early as the 4th century, such architectural features, or the frame surrounding them are called tabernacles. This definition extends to the ornamentation or framework surrounding doors, windows and niches.

==Types==

A is a very shallow niche, usually too shallow to contain statues, and may resemble a blind window (a window without openings) or sealed door. (Compare: blind arcade)

In Gothic architecture, a niche may be set within a tabernacle framing, like a richly decorated miniature house (&quot;aedicula&quot;), such as might serve for a reliquary. The backings for the altars in churches (reredos) can be embedded with niches for statues.

Though a niche in either Classical or Gothic contexts may be empty and merely provide some articulation and variety to a section of wall, the cult origins of the niche suggested that it be filled with a statue.

In the Encyclopedia Methodique, the authors divide niches into different classes. The classes refer to the shape of the plan and the head (top and bottom), the ornamentation, and entablature. They vary according to their characteristics, from simple to extremely ornate.

==Examples==
One of the earliest buildings which uses external niches containing statues is the Church of Orsanmichele in Florence, built between 1380 and 1404. 

The Uffizi Palace in Florence (1560–81) modified the concept by setting the niche within the wall so it did not protrude. The Uffizi has two dozen or so such niches containing statues of great historical figures. In England, the Uffizi style niches were adopted at Montacute House (c. 1598), where there are nine exterior niches containing statues of the Nine Worthies.

In Fra Filippo Lippi&#x27;s Madonna, the &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; niche frames her as with the canopy of estate that was positioned over a personage of importance in the late Middle Ages and Early Modern Europe. At the same time, the Madonna is represented as an iconic sculpture who has &quot;come alive&quot; with miraculous immediacy. 

In Iran, a Mihrab is a type of niche in the wall of a mosque at the point nearest to Mecca toward which the congregation faces to pray. This is The Great Mosque of Cordoba, It&#x27;s Mihrab is formed of small, glazed glass tiles and plaster creating a mosaic.

Niches aren&#x27;t only one sided as is the case of the Porta Maggiore where niches flank both sides of the gate and at one time displayed statues. Small Roman temples called Aedicula were often decorated with niches. For example, an aedicula on Lake Albano in Italy has six niches of varying heights, suggesting that anything up to the height of the statue could be accommodated.

<text>Zaspa (; ) is one of the quarters of Gdańsk, Poland, located in the northern part of the city. It is divided into two administrative districts: Zaspa-Młyniec and Zaspa-Rozstaje.

Zaspa was founded on a place previously occupied by an airport. The concrete airstrip of the airport was not dismantled, and now forms the axis of the district.

Zaspa buildings are mainly high-rise condominiums (between 4 and 12 stories high) erected in the early 1980s and additional thermal isolation in the form of styrofoam sheets was applied in the early 2000s. In the following years the buildings were also painted in pastel colours.

==History==

As part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland it was a private church village of the Cistercian Monastery in Oliwa, administratively located in the Gdańsk County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship.

During World War II, on October 5, 1939, the Germans carried out an execution of 39 Poles, defenders of the Polish Post Office in Gdansk, in the district. There are memorials to the defenders at the site of the execution and at the site of their former mass grave, which was discovered in 1991. The defenders were then officially buried at the cemetery of victims of Nazi Germany in Zaspa in 1992.

During the Solidarity times, Lech Wałęsa had an apartment on Zaspa. The pope John Paul II visited the district on 12 June 1987 during his third pilgrimage to Poland.

==Sights==
The Park Zaspa is one of the largest public parks in Gdańsk, and the large cemetery of victims of Nazi Germany is also located in Zaspa.

==Transport==
The Gdańsk Zaspa railway station is located in Zaspa.

==Religion==
Catholic churches of Saint Casimir and of Divine Providence are located in Zaspa.

<text>Pei-Yuan Wei () was a Taiwanese-American businessman who created ViolaWWW, the first popular graphical web browser.

==Career==
Pei-Yuan Wei was born in Pingtung County, Taiwan. He graduated from Berkeley High School in 1986. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of California, Berkeley, and was a member of the student club, the eXperimental Computing Facility (XCF).

In the 1990s, Wei was a founding employee of Global Network Navigator, one of the first Internet-based businesses. Later he worked for various Palm OS-related businesses. Since 2008, Perry has lived in both Taiwan and the US, devoting most of his time to taking care of his ill family member.

==Controversy==
Pei-Yuan Wei was at the center of a controversy over patents relating to embedded objects in a web browser, which revolves around whether his browser, ViolaWWW, had the capability to launch embedded objects, prior to the date a patent was filed by Michael David Doyle of Eolas, and the University of California. If it did, it would constitute prior art, which may invalidate the patent issued to Eolas. If it did not, in addition to major financial penalties against such companies as Microsoft, the way the World Wide Web and the way browsers that surf it work may be forced to change.

Eolas&#x27; claim was eventually found invalid by a Texas court.

<doc id="497200" wikidata="Q633087" url="?curid=497200" title="Flag of Montana">
<text>The flag of the state of Montana consists of the image of the Montana state seal centered on a blue field.

==History==
Within the seal, a plow, shovel, and pick rest in a field in front of the Great Falls of the Missouri River. The ribbon contains the state motto, &quot;ORO Y PLATA&quot;, which is Spanish for “gold and silver&quot;. The current flag was adopted in 1905, and the word “MONTANA” above the seal was added in 1981. In 1985, the flag was again modified to specify the font used in “MONTANA”: Helvetica Bold. Before it was adopted as a state flag, it was used by Montana troops deploying for the Spanish–American War.

The North American Vexillological Association (NAVA) declared the flag of Montana to be the third worst state/provincial flag, 70th in a field of 72 in a list that contained all the provinces of Canada, U.S. states and U.S. territories. Georgia&#x27;s flag was named the worst, but has since been changed, and Nebraska&#x27;s flag was named second worst. NAVA stated that about half of U.S. states used blue fields, which rendered them difficult to distinguish; furthermore, the survey ranked flags which had both words and complex seals the lowest.
==Proposed changes==

In 1974, the Montana Legislature considered adopting a new flag to replace the 1905 design. The first design submitted for proposal had a white field with three stylized mountain peaks of black in the upper hoist, and a green horizontal stripe along the bottom. The second proposal was designed by James Croft and featured a blue stripe representing Montana’s &quot;Big Sky State&quot; nickname, a white stripe for the state’s pure rivers, and a green stripe symbolizing forests and fields. A stylized mountain silhouette symbolized the &quot;Land of Shining Mountains&quot; and the Spanish word montaña (mountainous), while a copper arrowhead at the staff finial honored Montana’s Indigenous heritage. However, on February 8, 1975, the Senate rejected Croft&#x27;s proposal by a vote of 30-19, postponing further flag redesign considerations for at least a year.

In 1979, Edward Mooney, an undergraduate at Montana State University, along with friends, designed another alternative flag. The design featured a green bottom third to represent Montana’s productive land and a blue top two-thirds for the “Big Sky” slogan, separated by a white line that formed an &quot;M&quot; on the left side, symbolizing both Montana and the state’s geographic divide between the Rocky Mountains in the west and Great Plains in the east. A white five-pointed star above the “M” symbolized Montana’s statehood, while the white color also represented the snows of winter. Mooney and his group presented the design to Governor Thomas Lee Judge and members of the Montana Legislature, with all parties refusing to consider the change. However, the 1981 legislature did agree to add the word “MONTANA” to the existing flag, which remains the current flag to this day. 

In 2021, Democratic Rep. Moffie Funk proposed a bill to study the possibility of designing a new state flag, with an emphasis on evaluating whether the flag truly represents Montana&#x27;s diversity and magnificence. Republican Rep. Caleb Hinkle then proposed an amendment to Funk&#x27;s bill that would add firearms to the state flag as a tribute to Montana’s history with pioneers, soldiers, Native tribes, and hunters. His design concept suggested including semi-automatic rifles, such as the AR-15, but it faced strong criticism, including from Democratic Rep. Jonathan Windy Boy of the Chippewa Cree tribe. Windy Boy pointed out the negative historical associations of firearms for Native Americans, and lawmakers ultimately voted against Hinkle’s amendment, with only 12 in favor and 88 opposed. Funk’s original proposal to create a committee to consider a new design also failed with a vote of 37-63.

<text>Aniołki (, ; lit. &quot;Little Angels&quot;) is one of the quarters of Gdańsk in Poland.

== Location ==
Aniołki is located in the centre of the city, mainly around Victory Alley. It borders Wrzeszcz Górny and Wrzeszcz Dolny in the north, Młyniska in the east, Śródmieście and Siedlce in the south, and Suchanino in the west.

== History ==
The name of Aniołki comes from the Church of St. Michael and All the Heaven&#x27;s Angels, where an old tank currently stands as a statue. The church&#x27;s ruins were uncovered in 2021.

Near the quarter of Brama Oliwska, a railway station (built in 1870) functioned that was the main connection to most of Pomerania. Around 1900, the Gdańsk Główny railway station was built and the station was destroyed.

In 1896, the ruins of a cemetery were removed and replaced with Steffens Park, named after Otto Steffens.

In 1946, the ruins of the Church of St. Michael and All the Heaven&#x27;s Angels were replaced with a T-34 tank.

<text>Wzgórze Mickiewicza () is one of the quarters of the city of Gdańsk, Poland. It was established on 5 October 1954 in the area of the village of Nowe Ujeścisko () which was renamed to after the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz. It is literally translated into English as &quot;The Hillock of Mickiewicz&quot;.
Wzgórze Mickiewicza borders with two other districts of Gdańsk: Siedlce and Chełm i Gdańsk Południe. It is situated close to the Gdańsk cemetery Cmentarz Łostowicki.

Most streets are named after the characters of Mickiewicz&#x27;s book Pan Tadeusz (e.g. Ulica Jacka Soplicy, Ulica Telimeny). Some of them bear the names of the characters of other works (e.g. Ulica Świtezianki, Ulica Rusałki) by Mickiewicz or of people connected with the poets life (e.g. Ulica Maryli, Ulica Filaretów).

<text>Brętowo (; ) is one of the quarters of the city of Gdańsk, Poland. It includes 2 osiedles, Niedźwiednik and Matemblewo, that are located inside Oliwa forests.

==History==
The area of the settlement belonged to the Cistercian abbey in Oliwa, which operated a mill, and was first mentioned in 1570 as &quot;Bringenthute&quot;. In the late 16th century it was property of the Schröer family from Danzig (Gdańsk) and consisted of the Schöer manor and a mill. In the 18th century an inn and two coppersmiths operated in the village. 

In the First Partition of Poland, in 1772, the settlement was annexed by Prussia, and from 1871 it was also part of Germany. In 1784, it was called &quot;Brentau&quot;. In 1885, it was inhabited by 216 people, a two-class school existed. In 1910 it consisted of 224 farm- and 76 residential buildings, inhabited by 1,179 people. The Forges and a grain mill still operated. In 1913, Brentau was connected to the railway line from Langfuhr (Wrzeszcz) to Kokoschken (Kokoszki). Following World War I it became part of the newly formed Free City of Danzig (Gdańsk). In the mid-1930s, the village occupied 372 ha and was inhabited by 1,845 people. On 15 August 1933 it was incorporated into the city limits of Danzig. In 1939, along with the city, it was annexed by Nazi Germany. Following Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, in 1945, it became again part of Poland. In 1949, its Polish name Brętowo was officially confirmed.

==Transport==
The old (closed and now re-opened) railway track from Wrzeszcz to Kartuzy goes through the quarter, with Gdańsk Brętowo (PKP station) being the former station. As few railway bridges had been destroyed, their remnants were used by alpinists to train until the railway got reconstructed.

<text>Clifford Charles Arquette (December 28, 1905 ⁠– September 23, 1974) was an American actor and comedian. He was best known for performing comedic routines as his alter-ego Charley Weaver on numerous television and radio shows.

==Early life and career==
Cliff Arquette was born on December 27 1905, in Toledo, Ohio, the youngest of four children born to Winifred Ethel Clark (July 30, 1878 ⁠– February 12, 1966) and Charles Augustus Arquette (October 23, 1878 ⁠– August 12, 1927), a vaudevillian. His siblings were Naomi &quot;Jane&quot; Arquette Hammett (1899⁠–1934), Russell Arquette (1901⁠–1982), and Lester Kear Arquette (1904⁠–1969). Cliff was of part French-Canadian descent, and his family&#x27;s surname was originally &quot;Arcouet&quot;. Cliff Arquette fathered a son named Alden Arquette in 1921 when he and his girlfriend were 16. Their marriage was annulled (there is no record of the marriage) but there is a record of Alden&#x27;s birth. 

Arquette is credited for inventing the modern rubber theatrical prosthetic mask, which was flexible enough to allow changing facial expressions, and porous enough to allow air to reach the actor&#x27;s skin.

Arquette had been a performer in radio, theatre, and motion pictures until 1956, when he retired from show business. At one time, he was credited with performing in 13 different daily radio shows at different stations in the Chicago market, getting from one studio to the other by way of motorboats along the Chicago River through its downtown. One such radio series he performed on was &quot;The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok&quot;.

Arquette and Dave Willock had their own radio show, &quot;Dave and Charley&quot;, in the early 1950s, as well as a television show by the same title that was on the air for three months. It was when Arquette performed on the shows that he created and inaugurated his performances as his eventual trademark character of Charley Weaver.
==Charley Weaver==
Arquette accepted Jack Paar&#x27;s invitation to appear on Paar&#x27;s NBC &quot;Tonight Show&quot; in 1957. Arquette had previously created the character of &quot;Charley Weaver, the wild old man from Mount Idy&quot;. He would read a letter from his &quot;Mamma&quot; back home. This characterization proved so popular that Arquette almost never again appeared in public as himself, but almost always as Charley Weaver, complete with his squashed hat, little round glasses, rumpled shirt, broad tie, baggy pants, and suspenders. Arquette could often convulse Paar and the audience into helpless laughter by way of his timing and use of double entendres in describing the misadventures of his fictional family and townspeople. As Paar noted, in his foreword to Arquette&#x27;s first Charley Weaver book:

Sometimes his jokes are old, and I live in the constant fear that the audience will beat him to the punch line, but they never have. And I suspect that if they ever do, he will rewrite the ending on the spot. I would not like to say that all his jokes are old, although some have been found carved in stone. What I want to say is that in a free-for-all ad lib session, Charley Weaver has and will beat the fastest gun alive.

Arquette, as Charley Weaver, hosted &quot;Charley Weaver&#x27;s Hobby Lobby&quot; on ABC from September 30, 1959, to March 23, 1960. He also appeared as Charley Weaver on &quot;The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show&quot; in 1962. 

In 1960, Arquette was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to radio.

==Later career and legacy==
Arquette&#x27;s Charley Weaver character was a fixture on the TV game show &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; for many years, always sitting in the lower left corner of the tic-tac-toe board. As a rule, he was given questions about American History, and as a rule, his answers were correct. 

A Civil War buff, Arquette opened the Charley Weaver Museum of the Civil War in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania in the 1950s. The museum was housed in a building that had served as headquarters for General O.O. Howard during the Battle of Gettysburg, and remained in operation for about ten years. The site later became the Soldier&#x27;s National Museum, and closed in early November 2014.

Arquette spent some time hospitalized in the early 1970s due to heart disease. He suffered a stroke in 1972 that kept him off of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; for some time.

==Death==
Arquette died in Burbank, California, following a stroke on September 23, 1974. He was 68 years old.

<doc id="497214" wikidata="Q752562" url="?curid=497214" title="Flag of Nevada">
<text>The [[flag]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Nevada]] consists of a cobalt blue field with a variant of the state&#x27;s emblem in the upper left-hand corner. The emblem constitutes a silver star (a reference to the state&#x27;s nickname, the Silver State), with the state&#x27;s name below. Above the star is a golden-yellow scroll with the words &quot;Battle Born&quot;, one of the state&#x27;s mottos (in reference to Nevada becoming a state during the American Civil War). Below the star and state name are two sprays of green sagebrush (the state flower) with yellow flowers.

==History==
The first flag of Nevada was created by Governor John Sparks and Colonel Harry Day in 1905. It was based strongly on Nevada&#x27;s natural resources of gold and silver. The blue of the flag was to be the same as the blue on the flag of the United States.

The second flag of Nevada was designed by Miss Clara Crisler in 1915. The flag sought to be more representative of Nevada by adding the state seal as the center point of the flag. The flag retained the same blue field as the previous flag. The 36 stars on the flag represented how Nevada was the 36th state in the union. The flag proved popular, but the abundance of colors on the seal was too expensive to produce which led to the adoption of a new flag in 1929.

The current flag had its origin in a design contest announced in 1926. The winning design, by Louis Shellback III, was subjected to some revision in the state legislature, where there was disagreement between the two houses over the placement of the word &quot;Nevada&quot; on the flag. A compromise was reached, and in 1929 Governor Fred B. Balzar signed into law a bill adopting the new flag. In 1989, however, a legislative researcher discovered that the bill as sent to and signed by the governor did not accurately reflect the 1929 legislative agreement. The flag used from 1929 until it was revised in 1991 displayed the letters of the word &quot;Nevada&quot; in a complete circle around the flag&#x27;s single star, with the &quot;N&quot; of Nevada at the uppermost tip of the star indicating its &quot;northern&quot; position in the civil war, and with each of the other letters of the word Nevada located in the spaces between the remaining points of the star, displaying near each junction of the star&#x27;s pentagonal center. Thus, &quot;Nevada&quot; was spelt from the &quot;N&quot; at the top, radiating clockwise E, V, A, D, A, in the spaces between the star&#x27;s points. A law enacted in 1991 directed that the word &quot;Nevada&quot; appear below the star and above the sagebrush sprays, thus producing the current design.

<doc id="497218" wikidata="Q1385851" url="?curid=497218" title="Eynhallow">
<text>Eynhallow is a small, presently uninhabited island in Eynhallow Sound, between Rousay and the Mainland of Orkney, off the north coast of mainland Scotland. It is in area.
There is an unnamed skerry about to the north-east of the island, separated by Fint Sound. Sheep Skerry adjoins the southern end of the island.

There is no ferry to the island, although Orkney Heritage Society organises a trip each July. Otherwise, visitors have to arrange their own transport to the island by private local boat hire. Access can be problematic, as there are strong tidal surges in the surrounding strait, funnelled between Mainland and Rousay.

==Etymology==
The Norse named the island &quot;Eyinhelga&quot;, meaning &quot;holy island&quot;. Johan Blaeu&#x27;s 17th century &quot;Atlas Novus&quot; records the name as &quot;Alhallow&quot;. Skene&#x27;s 19th century translation of John of Fordun&#x27;s 14th century &quot;Chronica Gentis Scotorum&quot; records the name as &quot;Enhallow&quot;.

==History==

The island&#x27;s main attraction is Eynhallow Church, dating from the 12th century or earlier, and perhaps originally part of a monastery. The site is maintained by Historic Scotland.

In 1841 the island had a population of 26. It has been uninhabited since the landowner cleared crofters away in 1851. The clearing led to the discovery of the church ruins, forgotten until then. The island is now a bird sanctuary.

Described as &quot;perhaps the most mystical of the Orkney isles&quot;, it has its own folklore concerning the initial finding of the island. Eynhallow was believed to be the summer residence of the shape-shifting mer-people the Finfolk before they were driven away by a farmer from Evie, the Guidman o&#x27; Thorodale.

==Cinderella stamps==
Cinderella stamp issues have been made for Eynhallow since at least 1973. They have no postal currency.

<doc id="497219" wikidata="Q1588477" url="?curid=497219" title="Sound power">
<text>Sound power or acoustic power is the rate at which sound energy is emitted, reflected, transmitted or received, per unit time. It is defined as &quot;through a surface, the product of the sound pressure, and the component of the particle velocity, at a point on the surface in the direction normal to the surface, integrated over that surface.&quot; The SI unit of sound power is the watt (W). It relates to the power of the sound force on a surface enclosing a sound source, in air. 

For a sound source, unlike sound pressure, sound power is neither room-dependent nor distance-dependent. Sound pressure is a property of the field at a point in space, while sound power is a property of a sound source, equal to the total power emitted by that source in all directions. Sound power passing through an area is sometimes called &quot;sound flux&quot; or &quot;acoustic flux&quot; through that area.

==Sound power level &quot;L&quot;WA==

Regulations often specify a method for measurement that integrates sound pressure over a surface enclosing the source. &quot;L&quot;WA specifies the power delivered to that surface in decibels relative to one picowatt. Devices (e.g., a vacuum cleaner) often have labeling requirements and maximum amounts they are allowed to produce. The A-weighting scale is used in the calculation as the metric is concerned with the loudness as perceived by the human ear. Measurements in accordance with ISO 3744 are taken at 6 to 12 defined points around the device in a hemi-anechoic space. The test environment can be located indoors or outdoors. The required environment is on hard ground in a large open space or hemi-anechoic chamber (free-field over a reflecting plane.)

===Table of selected sound sources===
Here is a table of some examples, from an on-line source. For omnidirectional point sources in free space, sound power in &quot;L&quot;wA is equal to sound pressure level in dB above 20 micropascals at a distance of 0.2821 m

==Mathematical definition==
Sound power, denoted &quot;P&quot;, is defined by
:formula_1
where
*f is the sound force of unit vector u;
*v is the particle velocity of projection &quot;v&quot; along u;
*&quot;A&quot; is the area;
*&quot;p&quot; is the sound pressure.

In a medium, the sound power is given by
:formula_2
where
*&quot;A&quot; is the area of the surface;
*&quot;ρ&quot; is the mass density;
*&quot;c&quot; is the sound velocity;
*&quot;θ&quot; is the angle between the direction of propagation of the sound and the normal to the surface.
*&quot;p&quot; is the sound pressure.
For example, a sound at SPL = 85 dB or &quot;p&quot; = 0.356 Pa in air (&quot;ρ&quot; = and &quot;c&quot; = ) through a surface of area &quot;A&quot; = normal to the direction of propagation (&quot;θ&quot; = 0°) has a sound energy flux &quot;P&quot; = .

This is the parameter one would be interested in when converting noise back into usable energy, along with any losses in the capturing device.

==Relationships with other quantities==
Sound power is related to sound intensity:
:formula_3
where
*&quot;A&quot; stands for the area;
*&quot;I&quot; stands for the sound intensity.

Sound power is related sound energy density:
:formula_4
where
*&quot;c&quot; stands for the speed of sound;
*&quot;w&quot; stands for the sound energy density.

==Sound power level==

Sound power level (SWL) or acoustic power level is a logarithmic measure of the power of a sound relative to a reference value.&lt;br&gt;
Sound power level, denoted &quot;L&quot;&quot;W&quot; and measured in dB, is defined by:
:formula_5
where
*&quot;P&quot; is the sound power;
*&quot;P&quot;0 is the &quot;reference sound power&quot;;
* is the neper;
* is the bel;
* is the decibel.

The commonly used reference sound power in air is
:formula_6
The proper notations for sound power level using this reference are or , but the suffix notations , , dBSWL, or dBSWL are very common, even if they are not accepted by the SI.

The reference sound power &quot;P&quot;0 is defined as the sound power with the reference sound intensity passing through a surface of area :
:formula_7
hence the reference value .

===Relationship with sound pressure level===
The generic calculation of sound power from sound pressure is as follows:
:formula_8
where:
formula_9 defines the area of a surface that wholly encompasses the source. This surface may be any shape, but it must fully enclose the source. 
In the case of a sound source located in free field positioned over a reflecting plane (i.e. the ground), in air at ambient temperature, the sound power level at distance &quot;r&quot; from the sound source is approximately related to sound pressure level (SPL) by
:formula_10
where
*&quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot; is the sound pressure level;
*&quot;A&quot;0 = 1 m2;
*formula_11 defines the surface area of a hemisphere; and 
*&quot;r&quot; must be sufficient that the hemisphere fully encloses the source.

Derivation of this equation:
:formula_12
For a &quot;progressive&quot; spherical wave,
:formula_13
:formula_14 (the surface area of sphere)
where &quot;z&quot;0 is the characteristic specific acoustic impedance.

Consequently,
:formula_15
and since by definition , where is the reference sound pressure,
:formula_16

The sound power estimated practically does not depend on distance. The sound pressure used in the calculation may be affected by distance due to viscous effects in the propagation of sound unless this is accounted for.

<text>The flag of the state of New Mexico, also referred to as the New Mexican flag, is a state flag, consisting of a sacred red sun symbol of the Zia tribe on a field of gold (yellow). It was officially adopted on March 15, 1925 to highlight the state&#x27;s Indigenous and Hispanic heritage: it combines a symbol of the Puebloan people, who have ancient roots in the state, with the colors of the flag of Spain, whose empire had established and ruled over “” for over two and a half centuries.

The New Mexico flag is among the more distinctive and iconic in the U.S., and has been noted for its simple and aesthetically pleasing design. It is one of four U.S. state flags without the color blue (along with Alabama, California, and Maryland) and the only one among the four without the color white. New Mexico is one of only two U.S states (along with Oklahoma) that depicts indigenous iconography in its flag.

The proportions of the symbol are fixed by New Mexico law: the four groups of rays are set at right angles, with the two inner rays one-fifth longer than the outer rays, and the diameter of the circle in the center is one-third the width of the symbol.

== History ==
=== First flag ===

During its first thirteen years as a state, New Mexico did not have an official flag. The San Diego World&#x27;s Fair of 1915, which occurred three years after New Mexico&#x27;s admission to the union, featured an exhibit hall where all U.S. state flags were displayed; lacking an official flag, New Mexico displayed an unofficial one designed by Ralph Emerson Twitchell, the mayor of the state capital, Santa Fe. Known as the &quot;Twitchell flag&quot;, it consisted of a blue field with the U.S. flag in the upper left corner, the words &quot;New Mexico&quot; in silver lettering in the center of the flag, the number &quot;47&quot; in the upper right corner (in reference to New Mexico being the 47th state), and the state seal in the bottom right corner (which in some historical references is wrapped with the words &quot;The Sunshine State&quot;). As of 2005, the only known Twitchell flag in existence was displayed at the Palace of the Governors in Santa Fe.

=== Second flag (1925–present) ===

==== 1920 redesign ====
In 1920, the New Mexico chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) called for the creation of an official flag that would reflect the state&#x27;s unique heritage and culture. A statewide contest was held in 1923 to solicit new designs. Eventually, a design made by Harry Mera of Santa Fe and sewn by his wife Reba Mera was selected. In 1925, Governor Arthur T. Hannett signed legislation proclaiming the Mera design the official state flag, which remains in use and unchanged to this day.

Mera was a physician and archaeologist who was familiar with the Zia sun symbol, initially found at Zia Pueblo on a 19th century pottery jar (which was later revealed to have been taken from a tribal secret society by James and Matilda Stevenson in the 1890s). The symbol has sacred meaning to the indigenous Zia people. Four is a sacred number symbolizing the Circle of Life: the four directions, the four times of day, the four stages of life, and the four seasons; the circle binds these four elements of four together. 

The symbol was used without the permission of the Zia people, and they have fought to prevent it from being used without their permission, including via attempting to copyright it, during and after its adoption as a symbol of the state, and due to concerns over desecration of the symbol. A 2012 joint memorial by the state and the Zia people later acknowledged the state had appropriated the image without permission. Due to its longstanding use, the symbol is now unlikely to be eligible for copyright, falling into the American public domain, which remains a point of contention between the state and the Zia people, as the tribe was unaware of the specifics of such laws at the time the symbol was co-opted.

The salutation, &quot;I salute the flag of the State of New Mexico and the Zia symbol of perfect friendship among united cultures&quot;, is commonly recited in New Mexico public schools after the United States pledge of allegiance.

The New Mexico flag was rated first in a 2001 survey of 72 U.S. and Canadian flags by the North American Vexillological Association.

==== Adoption ====
The flag is officially defined in law as:
The flag is worn on uniforms by sailors aboard the submarine .

==Pledge ==

The pledge to the state flag is available in English and Spanish:

<doc id="497222" wikidata="Q2449390" url="?curid=497222" title="Lamb Holm">
<text>Lamb Holm is a small uninhabited island in Orkney, Scotland. The Italian Chapel, constructed during the Second World War, is the island&#x27;s main attraction.

Lamb Holm is classified by the National Records of Scotland as an uninhabited island that &quot;had no usual residents at the time of either the 2001 or 2011 censuses.&quot;

==Geography==
Lamb Holm lies in Holm Sound, one of the eastern entrances to Scapa Flow, between Mainland, Orkney and the island of Burray, It is in area.

The Churchill Barriers carry the road from South Ronaldsay to Mainland, Orkney. Lamb Holm is connected to Glimps Holm, to the southwest, by Barrier number 2, and to Mainland by Barrier number 1.

The quarry used to build the Churchill Barriers has now been flooded and converted into a fish farm.

On the northwest of the island, on the shore of St Mary&#x27;s Bay, are the remains of a prehistoric settlement which have been designated as a scheduled monument.

There is a Bronze Age Barrow mound on the island named as &quot;Laughton&#x27;s Knowe&quot;. The name may have evolved from an earlier form &quot;Lachtane&quot; or &quot;Lauchtain&quot; associated with Orkney but prior to the family of this name settling on the island following the impignoration in 1472 resulting in an influx of Scottish Tacksmen loyal to the Stewart King of Scots, it is likely to have had either no name at all or an entirely different reference.

==Italian Chapel==

Built by Italian prisoners of war during World War II, the highly ornamented Italian Chapel is now the island&#x27;s main attraction. The chapel is a Category A listed building.

In 1942, more than 1300 Italian prisoners of war were captured in North Africa and taken to Orkney, where they remained until early 1945. Of these, 550 were taken to Camp 60, where they were put to work building the Churchill Barriers, four causeways created to block unwanted extra sea accesses to Scapa Flow.

In 1943, Major T. P. Buckland, Camp 60&#x27;s new commandant, and Father Giacombazzi, the Camp&#x27;s priest agreed that a place of worship was required. Two Nissen huts were joined to form a makeshift chapel. The prisoners, under the leadership of prisoner Domenico Chiocchetti, did all of the work to transform a simple corrugated iron structure into a work of beauty. The chapel was lined with plasterwork and an altar was made out of concrete. Chiocchetti painted the sanctuary end of the chapel. The beauty that he created led to the prisoners decorating the entire interior and creating a front façade out of concrete that concealed the shape of the hut and made the building look like a church.

Since the prisoners&#x27; departure, several residents of Camp 60, including Chiocchetti, have made return visits to the chapel they created. In 1996 a declaration was jointly signed by officials in Orkney and Chiocchetti&#x27;s hometown of Moena, reinforcing the ties between the two places. The building has been preserved and is still used as a chapel.

<doc id="497225" wikidata="Q587334" url="?curid=497225" title="Lifebuoy">
<text>A lifebuoy or life ring, among many other names (see § Other names), is a life-saving buoy designed to be thrown to a person in water to provide buoyancy and prevent drowning. Some modern lifebuoys are fitted with one or more seawater-activated lights to aid rescue at night.

== Other names ==
Other names for &quot;lifebuoy&quot; include:
* life preserver
* life ring
* lifering
* lifebelt
* lifesaver
* ring buoy
* donut
* safety wheel
* Perry buoy
* Kisbee ring

== Description ==

The lifebuoy is usually a ring- or horseshoe-shaped personal flotation device with a connecting line allowing the casualty to be pulled to the rescuer in a boat. They are carried by ships and boats and located beside bodies of water and swimming pools. 

In the United States, Coast Guard approved lifebuoys are considered Type IV personal flotation devices. At least one Type IV PFD is required on all vessels 26 feet or more in length.

In the UK the Royal Life Saving Society considers lifebuoys unsuitable for use in swimming pools because throwing one into a busy pool could injure the casualty or other pool users. In these locations, lifebuoys have been superseded by devices such as the torpedo buoy, a low-drag device developed to be towed by lifeguards to those in danger.

== History ==

Leonardo da Vinci sketched a concept for a safety wheel, as well as for buoyant shoes and balancing sticks for walking on water.

According to various sources the Knights of Malta were the first to use cork lifebuoys on their ships.

In the book &quot;Architectura naval antigua y moderna&quot; (1752) by Juan José Navarro, 1st Marquess of Victoria, two plates show &quot;circular lifebuoys&quot; and another plate includes a drawing of &quot;a lifebuoy made of cork&quot;, called &quot;salvenos&quot;. This is the type used systematically by the Knights of Malta on their ships. The lifebuoy was attached to a rope on one side and to the poop of the ship on the other, so that it may be deployed in case anyone should fall into the sea. Navarro was Captain General of the Navy and is credited with the systematic introduction of the lifebuoy on all ships of the Spanish navy.

In 1803, a device called the &quot;Marine Spencer&quot; from the name of its inventor, Knight Spencer of Bread Street, was described in the Philosophical Magazine. It was made of &quot;800 old tavern corks&quot; affixed to a band, &quot;covered in canvass, and painted in oil, so as to render it waterproof.&quot; The invention gained Spencer the honorary silver medal from the Royal Humane Society.

A total of 2,509 Carnegie libraries were built between 1883 and 1929, including some belonging to public and university library systems. 1,689 were built in the United States, 660 in the United Kingdom and Ireland, 125 in Canada, and 25 others in Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Serbia, Belgium, France, the Caribbean, Mauritius, Malaysia, and Fiji.

At first, Carnegie libraries were almost exclusively in places with which he had a personal connection—namely his birthplace in Scotland and the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area, his adopted hometown. Yet, beginning in the middle of 1899, Carnegie substantially increased funding to libraries outside these areas. As Carnegie&#x27;s library funding progressed, very few of the towns that requested a grant, committing to his terms for operation and maintenance, were refused. By the time the last grant was made, there were 3,500 libraries in the United States, nearly half of them Carnegie libraries.

==History==
Carnegie started erecting libraries in places with which he had personal associations. The first of Carnegie&#x27;s public libraries, Dunfermline Carnegie Library, was in his birthplace, Dunfermline, Scotland. It was first commissioned or granted by Carnegie in 1880 to James Campbell Walker and would open in 1883.

The first library in the United States to be commissioned by Carnegie was in 1886 in his adopted hometown of Allegheny, Pennsylvania (now the North Side of Pittsburgh). In 1890, it became the second of his libraries to open in the US. The building also contained the first Carnegie Music Hall in the world.

The first Carnegie library to open in the United States was in Braddock, Pennsylvania, about 9 miles up the Monongahela River from Pittsburgh. In 1889, it was also the site of one of the Carnegie Steel Company&#x27;s mills. It was the second Carnegie Library in the United States to be commissioned, in 1887, and was the first of the four libraries which he fully endowed. An 1893 addition doubled the size of the building and included the third Carnegie Music Hall in the United States.

In the United States, nine of the first 13 libraries which Carnegie commissioned are all located in Southwestern Pennsylvania. The Braddock, Homestead, and Duquesne libraries were owned not by municipalities, but by Carnegie Steel, which constructed them, maintained them, and delivered coal for their heating systems. 

In 1897, Carnegie hired James Bertram as his personal assistant. Bertram was responsible for fielding requests from municipalities for funds and overseeing the dispensing of grants for libraries. When Bertram received a letter requesting a library, he sent the applicant a questionnaire inquiring about the town&#x27;s population, whether it had any other libraries, how large its book collection was, and what its circulation figures were. If initial requirements were met, Bertram asked the amount the town was willing to pledge for the library&#x27;s annual maintenance, whether a site was being provided, and the amount of money already available.

Until 1898, only one library was commissioned in the United States outside Southwestern Pennsylvania: a library in Fairfield, Iowa, commissioned in 1892. It was the first project in which Carnegie had funded a library to which he had no personal ties. The Fairfield project was part of a new funding model to be used by Carnegie (through Bertram) for thousands of additional libraries.

Beginning in 1899, Carnegie&#x27;s foundation funded a dramatic increase in the number of libraries. This coincided with the rise of women&#x27;s clubs in the post-Civil War period. They primarily took the lead in organizing local efforts to establish libraries, including long-term fundraising and lobbying within their communities to support operations and collections. They led the establishment of 75–80 percent of the libraries in communities across the country.

Carnegie believed in giving to the &quot;industrious and ambitious; not those who need everything done for them, but those who, being most anxious and able to help themselves, deserve and will be benefited by help from others.&quot; Under segregation, Black people were generally denied access to public libraries in the Southern United States. Rather than insisting on his libraries being racially integrated, Carnegie funded separate libraries for African Americans in the South. For example, in Houston he funded a separate Colored Carnegie Library. The Carnegie Library in Savannah, Georgia, opened in 1914 to serve Black residents, who had been excluded from the segregated White public library. The privately organized Colored Library Association of Savannah had raised money and collected books to establish a small Library for Colored Citizens. Having demonstrated their willingness to support a library, the group petitioned for and received funds from Carnegie. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in his 2008 memoirs that he frequently used that library as a boy, before the public library system was desegregated.

The library buildings were constructed in a number of styles, including Beaux-Arts, Italian Renaissance, Baroque, Classical Revival, and Spanish Colonial, to enhance their appearance as public buildings. Scottish Baronial was one of the styles used for libraries in Carnegie&#x27;s native Scotland. Each style was chosen by the community. As the years went by James Bertram, Carnegie&#x27;s secretary, became less tolerant of approving designs that were not to his taste. Edward Lippincott Tilton, a friend often recommended by Bertram, designed many of the buildings.

The architecture was typically simple and formal, welcoming patrons through a prominent doorway, nearly always accessed via a staircase from the ground level. The entry staircase symbolized a person&#x27;s elevation by learning. Similarly, most libraries had a lamp post or lantern installed near the entrance, meant as a symbol of enlightenment.

Carnegie&#x27;s grants were very large for the era, and his library philanthropy was one of the most costly philanthropic activities, by value, in history. Carnegie continued funding new libraries until shortly before his death in 1919. Libraries were given to towns and cities in Great Britain and much of the English-speaking world: Almost $56.2 million went for construction of 2,509 libraries worldwide. Of that, $40 million was given for construction of 1,670 public library buildings in 1,412 American communities. Small towns received grants of $10,000 that enabled them to build large libraries that immediately were among the most significant town amenities in hundreds of communities.

== Background ==

Books and libraries were important to Carnegie, from his early childhood in Scotland and his teen years in Allegheny and Pittsburgh. There he listened to readings and discussions of books from the Tradesman&#x27;s Subscription Library, which his father had helped create. Later in Pennsylvania, while working for the local telegraph company in Pittsburgh, Carnegie borrowed books from the personal library of Colonel James Anderson (1785-1861). He opened his collection to his workers every Saturday. Anderson, like Carnegie, resided in Allegheny.

In his autobiography, Carnegie credited Anderson with providing an opportunity for &quot;working boys&quot; (that some people said should not be &quot;entitled to books&quot;) to acquire the knowledge to improve themselves.
Carnegie&#x27;s personal experience as an immigrant, who with help from others worked his way and became wealthy, reinforced his belief in a society based on merit, where anyone who worked hard could become successful. This conviction was a major element of his philosophy of giving in general. His libraries were the best-known expression of this philanthropic goal. In 1900, Carnegie granted funds to build the Anderson Memorial Library, in memory of Colonel John Byers Anderson, at the College of Emporia.

==Carnegie formula==

Nearly all of Carnegie&#x27;s libraries were built according to &quot;the Carnegie formula&quot;, which required financial commitments for maintenance and operation from the town that received the donation. Carnegie required public support rather than making endowments because, as he wrote:
Carnegie required the elected officials—the local government—to:
* demonstrate the need for a public library;
* provide the building site;
* pay staff and maintain the library;
* draw from public funds to run the library—not use only private donations;
* annually provide ten percent of the cost of the library&#x27;s construction to support its operation; and,
* provide free service to all.

Carnegie assigned the decisions to his assistant James Bertram. He created a &quot;Schedule of Questions&quot;. The schedule included: Name, status and population of town, Does it have a library? Where is it located and is it public or private? How many books? Is a town-owned site available? Estimation of the community&#x27;s population at this stage was done by local officials, and Bertram later commented that if the population counts he received were accurate, &quot;the nation&#x27;s population had mysteriously doubled&quot;.

The effects of Carnegie&#x27;s library philanthropy coincided with a peak in new town development and library expansion in the US. By 1890, many states had begun to take an active role in organizing public libraries, and the new buildings filled a tremendous need. It was also a time of rapid development of institutions of higher learning. Interest in libraries was also heightened at a crucial time in their early development by Carnegie&#x27;s high profile and his genuine belief in their importance.

In Canada in 1901, Carnegie offered more than $2.5 million to build 125 libraries. Most cities at first turned him down, then eventually took the money.

In 1902, Carnegie offered funds to build a library in Dunedin in New Zealand. Between 1908 and 1916, 18 Carnegie libraries were opened across New Zealand.

==Design==
The Lawrenceville Branch of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh signaled a break from the Richardsonian style of libraries which was popularized in the mid 1800s. The ALA discouraged Richardsonian characteristics such as alcoved book halls with high shelves requiring a ladder, as well as sheltered galleries and niches, reminiscent of sixteenth-century Europe, largely because modern librarians could not supervise such spaces efficiently.

Bertram&#x27;s architectural criteria included a lecture room, reading rooms for adults and children, a staff room, a centrally located librarian&#x27;s desk, twelve-to-fifteen-foot ceilings, and large windows six to seven feet above the floor. No architectural style was recommended for the exterior, nor was it necessary to put Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s name on the building. In the interests of efficiency, fireplaces were discouraged, since that wall space could be used to house more books.

There were no strict requirements about furniture, but most of it came from the Library Bureau, established by Melvil Dewey in 1888. It sold standardized chairs, tables, catalogs, and bookshelves.

==Self-service stacks==


The first five Carnegie libraries followed a closed stacks policy, the method of operation common to libraries at that time. Patrons requested a book from a library staffer, who would fetch the book from closed stacks off limits to the public, and bring it to a delivery desk.

To reduce operating costs, Carnegie created a revolutionary open-shelf or self-service policy, beginning with the Pittsburgh neighborhood branches that opened after the main branch. This streamlined process allowed patrons to have open access to shelves. Carnegie&#x27;s architects designed the Pittsburgh neighborhood branches so that one librarian could oversee each entire operation.

Theft of books and other items was a major concern. This concern resulted in the placement of the library&#x27;s circulation desk—which replaced the delivery desk used in traditional closed stacks libraries—just inside the front door. Bigger and more daunting than those used in modern libraries, these desks spanned almost the width of the lobby and acted as a physical and psychological barrier between the front entrance and the book room.

The first of these &quot;open stack&quot; branches was in Lawrenceville, the sixth Carnegie library to open in America. The next was in the West End branch, the eighth Carnegie library in the US. Patricia Lowry describes

located just beyond the lobby, the circulation desk—no longer a delivery desk—took center stage in Lawrenceville, flanked by turnstiles that admitted readers to the open stacks one at a time, under the librarian&#x27;s watchful eye. To thwart thievery, the stacks were arranged in a radial pattern. On each side of the lobby were a general reading room and, for the first time in a library anywhere, a room for children... The reading rooms were separated by walls that became glass partitions above waist level—the better to see you with, my dear.

Walter E. Langsam, an architectural historian and teacher at the University of Cincinnati, wrote &quot;The Carnegie libraries were important because they had open stacks which encouraged people to browse ... People could choose for themselves what books they wanted to read.&quot; This open stacks policy was later adopted by the libraries that previously had operated with closed stacks.

==Criticisms==
The first secretary of the Iowa Library Commission, Alice S. Taylor, criticized the use of Carnegie funding for extravagant buildings rather than providing quality library services. Carnegie&#x27;s funds covered only the library buildings themselves, and Carnegie gave library buildings to cities on the condition that the cities stocked and maintained them. As a result, small communities often struggled with maintenance costs associated with Carnegie libraries; towns were often happy to accept funding for new library buildings, but often unwilling to allocate taxes for upkeep. In fact, this was the most frequent complaint about Carnegie libraries in hindsight: gifting libraries to towns too small to support them actually slowed the development of cooperative regional libraries that those communities now rely on.

Some critics also saw his massive donations as insulting to communities that would be content to fund their own public works. Others saw his push for public libraries as merely an attempt at social control. Mark Twain, a supporter of Carnegie, claimed that Carnegie used philanthropy as a tool to buy fame. William Jewett Tucker criticized Carnegie&#x27;s philanthropy from a religious viewpoint, arguing that it did not offset his &quot;immoral&quot; accumulation of wealth, and that his contributions did not justify the &quot;evils&quot; Tucker claimed existed in capitalism itself. Carnegie&#x27;s own steel workers echoed this sentiment, arguing that his wealth would be better spent on improving working conditions for his own employees, rather than on library buildings across the country. Carnegie&#x27;s response to those criticisms and the ensuing Homestead Steel Strike was telling of what he thought of his workers&#x27; concerns: &quot;If I had raised your wages, you would have spent that money by buying a better cut of meat or more drink for your dinner. But what you needed, though you didn&#x27;t know it, was my libraries and concert halls.&quot;

Carnegie&#x27;s critics can be most efficiently summed up in the words of Finley Peter Dunne&#x27;s parody of Carnegie himself: &quot;Th&#x27; way to abolish poverty an&#x27; bust crime is to put up a brown-stone buildin&#x27; in ivry town in th&#x27; counthry.&quot; The idea that a building would be the panacea to cure all of society&#x27;s ills, they argued, was simply not sustainable.

A further issue was the impact on pre-existing religious libraries that had promoted learning through free libraries for many years. A typical example is the United Presbyterian Library of Edinburgh, under Robert James Drummond which was affected following the opening of the Carnegie Library in the city centre.

In addition to the criticisms of his philanthropic interests and motivations, the construction of libraries in the American South was a highly contentious topic. State and local racial segregations laws across the South sought to bar African Americans access to public facilities, including libraries and when funding the construction of the Carnegie library in Atlanta in 1902, the proposed library, a segregated one, was fought by numerous activists of the period, including W. E. B. Du Bois. In the years following, as the American Library Association continued to ignore the systematic implementation of Jim Crow in the South, the Carnegie Corporation also continued to acquiesce to the social norms of the day and even required communities seeking grants to base their appropriations &quot;only upon the White population of the towns.&quot;

==Continuing legacy==

Carnegie established charitable trusts which have continued his philanthropic work. But they had reduced their investment in libraries even before his death. There has continued to be support for library projects, for example in South Africa.

In 1992, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that, according to a survey conducted by George Bobinski, dean of the School of Information and Library Studies at the State University at Buffalo, 1,554 of the 1,681 original Carnegie library buildings in the United States still existed, and 911 were still used as libraries. He found that 276 were unchanged, 286 had been expanded, 175 had been remodeled, 243 had been demolished, and others had been converted to other uses.

While hundreds of the library buildings have been adapted for use as museums, community centers, office buildings, residences, or other uses, more than half of those in the United States still serve their communities as libraries over a century after their construction. Many are located in what are now middle- to low-income neighborhoods. For example, Carnegie libraries still form the nucleus of the New York Public Library system in New York City, with 31 of the original 39 buildings still in operation; Carnegie Libraries operate in all 5 Boroughs of New York City across its three library systems. Also, the main library and eighteen branches of the Pittsburgh public library system are Carnegie libraries. The public library system there is named the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.

In the late 1940s, the Carnegie Corporation of New York arranged for microfilming of the correspondence files relating to Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s gifts and grants to communities for the public libraries and church organs. They discarded the original materials. The microfilms are open for research as part of the Carnegie Corporation of New York Records collection, residing at Columbia University Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Archivists did not microfilm photographs and blueprints of the Carnegie Libraries. The number and nature of documents within the correspondence files varies widely. Such documents may include correspondence, completed applications and questionnaires, newspaper clippings, illustrations, and building dedication programs.

UK correspondence files relating to individual libraries have been preserved in Edinburgh (see the article List of Carnegie libraries in Europe).

Beginning in the 1930s during the Great Depression, some libraries were meticulously measured, documented and photographed under the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) program of the National Park Service. This was part of an effort to record and preserve significant buildings.. Other documentation has been collected by local historical societies. In 1935, the centennial of Carnegie&#x27;s birth, a copy of the portrait of him originally painted by F. Luis Mora was given to libraries which he had helped fund. Many of the Carnegie libraries in the United States, whatever their current uses, have been recognized by listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The first, the Carnegie Library in Braddock, Pennsylvania, was designated as a National Historic Landmark in March 2012. Some Carnegie Libraries, have been replaced in name with that of city libraries such as the Epiphany library in New York City.

<text>In Hinduism, Itihasa-Purana, also called the fifth Veda, refers to the traditional accounts of cosmogeny, myths, royal genealogies of the lunar dynasty and solar dynasty, and legendary past events, as narrated in the &quot;Itihasa&quot; (Mahabharata and the Ramayana) and the Puranas. They are highly influential in Indian culture, and many classical Indian poets derive the plots of their poetry and drama from the Itihasa. The Epic-Puranic chronology derived from the &quot;Itihasa-Purana&quot;is an influential frame of reference in traditional Indian thought.

==Etymology==
&quot;Itihāsa&quot;, , derived from the phrase &quot;iti ha āsa&quot; , which means &quot;so indeed it was&quot;.

&quot;Puranas&quot;, ; , &quot;&quot; literally means &quot;ancient, old.&quot;

==Characterisation==
Itihasa refers to the Sanskrit Epics of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. The Puranas are a vast genre of Hindu literature about a wide range of topics, particularly about cosmogony, myths, legends and purported history. Together they are also called the fifth Veda, &quot;the Holy Book of the masses who were not entitled to study the four Vedas.&quot;

The tradition of Itihāsa is generally understood to be developed by the bardic tradition of Sūtas and Cāraṇas whose duties consisted of composing royal eulogies.

In the mythical narratives of the &quot;Itihasa-Purana&quot; there is no clear distinction between mythology, hagiography and historiography. The Indian tradition regards the &quot;Itihasa-Purana&quot; as authoritative historical writings, documenting past events and prescribing &quot;dharma&quot;, the right way tho live. The Itihasa-Purana forms the basis for the Epic-Puranic chronology, the traditional timeline of legendary history. The Mahabharata includes the story of the Kurukshetra War and preserves the traditions of the Lunar dynasty in the form of embedded tales. The Ramayana contains the story of Rama and is incidentally related to the legends of the Solar dynasty. The Puranas provide the idea of yugas and the Dashavatara, the ten incarnations of Vishnu in the four respective yugas.

==Cosmogeny and cyclic time (Yuga&#x27;s)==
===Yuga===

According to the Hindu texts, time is cyclic. The history of mankind is divided into four ages—Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga and Kali Yuga—collectively forming one Maha Yuga. Seventy-one Maha Yugas form a Manvantara (&quot;age of Manu&quot;), a period of time over which a &quot;Manu&quot; presides. For the duration of his period, each Manu is the archetypal first man, the progenitor of humanity, and also the first king and lawgiver. Along with a Manu, every Manvantara also has its own set of Indra, gods and the seven sages. Fourteen Manus reign in Kalpa, (a single day in the life of) Brahma), an equivalent of 1,000 Maha Yugas, at the end of which, the creation is destroyed and is followed by a Pralaya (dissolution) of equal length. The creation starts again, in the next Kalpa in an endless cycle of creations and dissolutions.

===Dashavatara===
The &quot;Dashavatara&quot; refers to the ten primary (i.e. full or complete) incarnations (avatars) of Vishnu, the Hindu god of preservation which has Rigvedic origins. Vishnu is said to descend in the form of an avatar to restore cosmic order. The word &quot;Dashavatara&quot; derives from , meaning &quot;ten&quot;, and avatar (), roughly equivalent to &quot;incarnation&quot;.

Various versions of the list of Vishnu&#x27;s avatars exist, varying per region and tradition. Some lists mention Krishna as the eighth avatar and the Buddha as the ninth avatar, while others – such as the &quot;Yatindramatadipika&quot;, a 17th-century summary of Srivaisnava doctrine – give Balarama as the eighth avatar and Krishna as the ninth. The latter version is followed by some Vaishnavas who do not accept the Buddha as an incarnation of Vishnu. Though no list can be uncontroversially presented as standard, the &quot;most accepted list found in Puranas and other texts is [...] Krishna, Buddha.&quot;

The following table summarises the position of avatars within the Dashavatara in many but not all traditions:

==Royal genealogies==
The Solar Dynasty and Lunar dynasty were two legendary principal dynasties of the Kshatriyas varna, or warrior–ruler class mentioned in the ancient Indian texts. They trace their origin to Vaivasvata Manu, who presides over the present, seventh manvatara.

According to &quot;Harivamsa&quot;, Ikshvaku was the son of Vaivasvata Manu, and the primogenitor of the Suryavamsha, or the Solar Dynasty, and was granted the kingdom of Aryavarta by his father Vaivasvata Manu. Vaivasvata Manu settled down in the Aryavarta region after he survived the Great Flood that ended the sixth mamanvatara. A. K. Mozumdar states that Manu is the one who built a city on the Sarayu (the river that his mother Sanjana was the goddess of) and called it Ayodhya, meaning the &#x27;invincible city&#x27;. This city served as the capital of many kings from the solar dynasty and is also believed to be the birthplace of Rama.

The Lunar dynasty (IAST: &quot;Candravaṃśa&quot;) is said to be descended from moon-related deities (&quot;Soma&quot; or &quot;Chandra&quot;). According to the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot;, Pururavas was the son of Budha (himself often described as the son of Soma) and the gender-switching deity Ila (born as the daughter of Manu). Pururavas&#x27;s great-grandson was Yayati, who had five sons named Yadu, Turvasu, Druhyu, Anu, and Puru. These seem to be the names of five Vedic tribes as described in the Vedas.

==Influence on classical Indian poetry==
Many classical Indian poets derive the plots of their poetry and drama from the Itihasa. The rules of classical Indian poetics prescribe that the themes of the mahakavyas (ornate epics) and natakas (drama) should primarily be selected from the &quot;itihasa&quot;. In accordance, great mahakavyas such as Kalidasa’s &quot;Raghuvamsa&quot;, Kumaradasa’s &quot;Janaki-harana&quot;, Bhatti&#x27;s &quot;Ravanavadha&quot; (or &quot;Bhattikavya&quot;) have drawn their themes from the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, and Bharavi’s &quot;Kiratarjuniya&quot;, Magha’s &quot;Sisupalavadha&quot; and Sriharsa&#x27;s &quot;Naisadhiyacarita&quot; from the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

== Historical Consciousness ==
The belief that South Asian society lacked historical consciousness until colonial times persists, as colonial writers like Robert Orme and James Mill argued that rational, factual history emerged in India only with British rule. They claimed pre-colonial Indian history, seen as mythic, did not meet modern standards because it was too formulaic and lacked historical context. But this notion has also been challenged. Kumkum Chatterjee, focused on a vernacular tradition of Itihasa/Purana in early modern Bengal, argued that these narratives are based on historical experiences derived from Mughal rule in Bengal and much of India during the 17th and 18th centuries. Puranas have evolved over time, constantly updated to reflect changing social conditions. They traditionally cover creation myths, cosmic cycles, genealogies, divine exploits, and royal histories, but they also include additional content like sectarian deities and social norms.

<text>The flag of Oklahoma, also known as the Oklahoma flag, is a rectangular field of sky blue on which is placed an Osage war shield with six crosses and seven pendant eagle feathers above the name of the state in a white Eurostile text in all capitals. Superimposed onto the crosses of the war shield is a calumet (peace pipe) and an olive branch.

==History==
Oklahoma&#x27;s first flag was adopted in 1911, four years after statehood. The flag featured a large centered white star fimbriated in blue on a red field. The number 46 was written in blue inside the star, as Oklahoma was the forty-sixth state to join the Union. It was designed by Ruth D. Clement, a founder of the state branch of the Daughters of the Confederacy.

A contest, sponsored by the Daughters of the American Revolution, was held in 1924 to replace the flag, as red flags were closely associated with the red flag of communism. The winning entry by Louise Fluke, of Shawnee, Oklahoma, which was adopted as the state flag on April 2, 1925, resembled the current flag without the word &quot;Oklahoma&quot; on it. That word was added in 1941 as part of an effort to combat widespread illiteracy, although there is no evidence the change to the flag played any significant role in such.


==Design==

The official design of the flag of Oklahoma has remained the same since 1941, however, unauthorized flag designs became prevalent throughout the state, so much so that the correct and official design of the flag was becoming lost. These unauthorized flags displayed stylized eagle feathers, incorrectly shaped crosses, an incorrectly shaped pipe, wrong colors, or combinations of these and other errors. In 2005, an Oklahoma Boy Scout leader designing patches for a National Jamboree contingent was looking for an image of the Oklahoma state flag and noticed that there were multiple unauthorized designs of the Oklahoma state flag displayed on state government, historical, and educational websites. With some research he was able to identify the official design to use, but because of the prevalence of unauthorized designs, he contacted his state representative, and was the impetus to standardize the colors and shapes by Oklahoma Senate Bill 1359 and signed into law by Governor Brad Henry on May 23, 2006, taking effect on November 1, 2006.

In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, territorial, and Canadian provincial flags and ranked the Oklahoma flag 39th.

==Symbolism==

The flag of Oklahoma is one of two U.S. state flags (along with New Mexico) to depict distinct Native American iconography. The blue field represents devotion and loyalty. The shield surmounted by the pipe and olive branch represents defensive or protective warfare, showing a love of peace by a united people. The flag of Oklahoma closely resembles the flag of the Choctaw Nation carried into battle by men of the Second Indian Brigade or &quot;Choctaw Brigade&quot; during the American Civil War. The Choctaw flag, a replica of which hung in the Oklahoma Historical Museum, having been described as a rectangular field of blue, on which was placed a large red circular war shield bordered by a band of white; superimposed upon the face of the shield was a white bow, two arrows, and tomahawk crossed at right angles.

==Display and use==
In 2015, a new specialty license plate honoring the first flag was authorized by the legislature and signed into law. A minimum of 100 pre-orders were required and fulfilled.

==Salute==
The state legislature adopted the following salute to the flag in 1982:

&quot;I salute the Flag of the State of Oklahoma: Its symbols of peace unite all people.&quot;

<doc id="497237" wikidata="Q332246" url="?curid=497237" title="Ananke">
<text>In ancient Greek religion, Ananke (; ), from the common noun (&quot;force, constraint, necessity&quot;), is the Orphic personification of inevitability, compulsion, and necessity. She is customarily depicted as holding a spindle. One of the Greek primordial deities, the births of Ananke and her brother and consort, Chronos (the personification of time, not to be confused with the Titan Cronus), were thought to mark the division between the eon of Chaos and the beginning of the cosmos. Ananke is considered the most powerful dictator of fate and circumstance. Mortals and gods alike respected her power and paid her homage. She is also considered the mother of the Fates, hence she is thought to be the only being to overrule their decisions (according to some sources, excepting Zeus also). According to Daniel Schowalter and Steven Friesen, she and the Fates &quot;are all sufficiently tied to early Greek mythology to make their Greek origins likely.&quot;

The ancient Greek traveller Pausanias wrote of a temple in ancient Corinth where the goddesses Ananke and Bia (meaning force, violence or violent haste) were worshiped together in the same shrine. Ananke is also frequently identified or associated with Aphrodite, especially Aphrodite Urania, the representation of abstract celestial love; the two were considered to be related, as relatively unanthropomorphised powers that dictated the course of life. Her Roman counterpart is Necessitas (&quot;necessity&quot;).

== Etymology ==
&quot;Ananke&quot; is derived from the common Ancient Greek noun (Ionic: ), meaning &quot;force, constraint or necessity.&quot; The common noun itself is of uncertain etymology. Homer refers to her being as necessity, often abstracted in modern translation (, &quot;it is necessary to fight&quot;) or force (, &quot;by force&quot;). In Ancient Greek literature the word is also used meaning &quot;fate&quot; or &quot;destiny&quot; (, &quot;fate by the daemons or by the gods&quot;), and by extension &quot;compulsion or torture by a superior.&quot; She appears often in poetry, as Simonides does: &quot;Even the gods don&#x27;t fight against &quot;ananke&quot;&quot;.

The pre-modern is carried over and translated (by reduction) into a more modern philosophical sense as &quot;necessity&quot;, &quot;logical necessity&quot;, or &quot;laws of nature&quot;.

== Mythology ==
In Orphic mythology, Ananke is a self-formed being who emerged at the dawn of creation with an incorporeal, serpentine form, her outstretched arms encompassing the cosmos. Ananke and Chronos are mates, mingling together in serpent form as a tie around the universe. Together, they have crushed the primal egg of creation of which constituent parts became earth, heaven and sea to form the ordered universe. Ananke is the mother (or another identity) of Adrasteia, the distributor of rewards and punishments.

In the &quot;Orphic Hymns&quot;, Aphrodite Urania is described as the mother of Ananke and ruler of the three Moirai:
=== Mother of the Moirai ===
The Greek philosopher Plato in his &quot;Republic&quot; discussed the parentage of the Moirai or the Fates in the following lines:And there were another three who sat round about at equal intervals, each one on her throne, the Moirai (Moirae, Fates), daughters of Ananke, clad in white vestments with filleted heads, Lakhesis (Lachesis), and Klotho (Clotho), and Atropos (Atropus), who sang in unison with the music of the Seirenes, Lakhesis singing the things that were, Klotho the things that are, and Atropos the things that are to be . . . Lakhesis, the maiden daughter of Ananke (Necessity).
Aeschylus, the famous tragedian, gave an account in his &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; where the Moirai were called the helmsman of the goddess Ananke along with the three Erinyes:Prometheus: Not in this way is Moira (Fate), who brings all to fulfillment, destined to complete this course. Only when I have been bent by pangs and tortures infinite am I to escape my bondage. Skill is weaker by far than Ananke (Necessity).Chorus: Who then is the helmsman of Ananke (Necessity)?Prometheus: The three-shaped (trimorphoi) Moirai (Moirae, Fates) and mindful (mnêmones) Erinyes (Furies).Chorus: Can it be that Zeus has less power than they do?Prometheus: Yes, in that even he cannot escape what is foretold.Chorus: Why, what is fated for Zeus except to hold eternal sway?Prometheus: This you must not learn yet; do not be over-eager.Chorus: It is some solemn secret, surely, that you enshroud in mystery.Here Prometheus speaks of a secret prophecy, rendered ineluctable by Ananke, that any son born of Zeus and Thetis would depose the god. (In fact, any son of Thetis was destined to be greater than his father.)

== In philosophical thought ==
In the &quot;Timaeus&quot;, Plato has the character Timaeus (not Socrates) argue that in the creation of the universe, there is a uniting of opposing elements, intellect (&#x27;nous&#x27;) and necessity (&#x27;ananke&#x27;). Elsewhere, Plato blends abstraction with his own myth making: &quot;For this ordered world (cosmos) is of a mixed birth: it is the offspring of a union of Necessity and Intellect. Intellect prevailing over Necessity by persuading (from Peitho, goddess of persuasion) it to direct most of the things that come to be toward what is best, and the result of this subjugation of Necessity to wise persuasion is the initial formation of the universe&quot;. In Victor Hugo&#x27;s novel &quot;Notre-Dame of Paris&quot;, the word &quot;Ananke&quot; is written upon a wall of Notre-Dame by the hand of Dom Claude Frollo. In his &quot;Toute la Lyre&quot;, Hugo also mentions Ananke as a symbol of love. In 1866, he wrote:

Sigmund Freud in &quot;Civilization and Its Discontents&quot; (p. 140) said: &quot;We can only be satisfied, therefore, if we assert that the process of civilization is a modification which the vital process experiences under the influence of a task that is set it by Eros and instigated by Ananke — by the exigencies of reality; and that this task is one of uniting separate individuals into a community bound together by libidinal ties.&quot;

Wallace Stevens, in a poem of the 1930s, writes: &quot;The sense of the serpent in you, Ananke, / And your averted stride / Add nothing to the horror of the frost / That glistens on your face and hair.&quot; This connects with Stevens&#x27;s sense of necessity or fate in his later work, especially in the collection &quot;The Auroras of Autumn&quot;.

Robert Bird&#x27;s essay &quot;Ancient Terror&quot;, inspired by Léon Bakst&#x27;s painting &quot;Terror Antiquus&quot;, speculates on the evolution of Greek religion, tracing it to an original belief in a single, supreme goddess. Vyacheslav Ivanov suggests that the ancients viewed all that is human and all that is revered as divine as relative and transient: &quot;Only Fate (Eimarmene), or universal necessity (Ananke), the inevitable &#x27;Adrasteia,&#x27; the faceless countenance and hollow sound of unknown Destiny, was absolute.&quot; Before the goddess, who is both indestructible Force of Love and absolute Fate the Destroyer, Life-Giver and Fate-Death, as well as incorporating Mnemosyne (Memory) and Gaia (Mother Earth), masculine daring and warring are impotent and transient, and the masculine order imposed by Zeus and the other Olympian Gods is artificial.

<doc id="497244" wikidata="Q18983" url="?curid=497244" title="Flag of Pennsylvania">
<text>The flag of Pennsylvania consists of a blue field on which the state coat of arms is displayed.

== History ==

On April 9, 1799, the Pennsylvania General Assembly authorized the use of the state coat of arms on flags for the state militia. These flags took various forms, most commonly featuring the coat of arms either replacing the field of stars in the union of the US flag, or being placed alone on a field of blue. The depiction of the coat of arms would also vary from flag to flag, as the colors in the escutcheon of the arms were changed in 1809, and the color of the horses was not standardized until 1875.

The legislature eventually chose to create a standardized flag for general use, featuring a now-standardized coat of arms alone on a plain field of blue mandated to be the &quot;same color as the blue field in the flag of the United States&quot;. This new flag was enacted by law on June 13, 1907.

== Criticism and attempts to change the flag ==
The Pennsylvania flag has been criticized for the complexity of its design, and its inability to stand out from other similar state flags across the US. Several attempts have been made by the Pennsylvania legislature and the public to address these criticisms by changing or altering the flag.

=== 2001 NAVA Survey ===
In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed 100 of its members and 337 members of the general public on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial and Canadian provincial flags. The survey ranked Pennsylvania&#x27;s flag 57th out of the 72, with a score of 3.69 on a scale of 0 to 10. Its low ranking was attributed to both the complexity of the coat of arms on its design, and its inability to stand out among a sea of similar “” designs common to more than half of U.S. state flags.

=== Attempts to add &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; to the flag (2004–2014) ===
Between 2004 and 2014, several attempts were made to add the word &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; to the state flag. According to former State Representative Tim Solobay (who introduced the first set of bills), this was intended to make Pennsylvania&#x27;s flag more unique and identifiable.

While the bill failed to leave committee in the first two sessions it was introduced, a 2006 survey offered by Solobay&#x27;s office to help refine the defined design may have swayed legislators to act on the bill, which was amended on May 7, 2007. On June 11, 2007, The Pennsylvania House of Representatives voted in favor of the bill, 164–31. The Senate State Government Committee never considered the bill, which died at the end of the Pennsylvania General Assembly&#x27;s two-year session.

The bill was reintroduced by Solobay in 2009, and on the next session day, a second similar bill was introduced by former State Representative Gary Haluska with a competing definition of the design. Neither bill was raised in committee that session. Haluska&#x27;s proposal was reintroduced alone in both the 2011–12 and 2013–14 sessions, and died in committee both times.

=== The Keystone Flag ===

In 2017 the &quot;Keystone Flag&quot; was designed by Tara Stark, a Pennsylvania resident. The flag incorporates a keystone symbol, the de-facto state emblem of Pennsylvania, into a tricolor design using the colors on the coat of arms of Pennsylvania as an intentional callback to the symbolism of the existing flag.

The flag gained popularity in online vexillological circles, winning multiple online contests, and began receiving wider attention following high-profile changes to the flag of Mississippi and the flag of Utah. The design was formally released into the public domain in August 2022. Stark launched a Kickstarter campaign in November 2022 to print flags and create other merchandise featuring the design, raising more than $4,500, and the design later began being sold by multiple unrelated manufacturers. It has since seen more popular use, notably including on a lapel pin worn by one state legislator, and has been referenced by multiple media outlets.

=== Broad redesign efforts (2023-present) ===
On June 16, 2023, Pennsylvania State Representative Joe Webster released a memorandum proposing a commission to &quot;study the history of the state flag, solicit design submissions for a new state flag, and recommend changes to the state flag.&quot; A House Resolution was formally introduced later that month, but did not receive a hearing before the legislative session ended. Webster has issued a new memorandum for the 2025-26 session.

<text>The flag of the U.S. state of Rhode Island is white and consists of a gold anchor in the center (a symbol for hope) surrounded by thirteen gold stars (for the original Thirteen Colonies and Rhode Island&#x27;s status as the 13th state to ratify the Constitution). A blue ribbon below the anchor bears the state&#x27;s motto in gold: &quot;HOPE&quot;. The flag is frequently depicted with golden fringe around the edges of the flag, although the fringe is never actually on the flag unless it is used in federal-level displays, much like the national flag.

==History==

The present flag of the state of Rhode Island was formally adopted in 1897. As early as the 1640s, the anchor and &quot;hope&quot; were found on the Rhode Island seal, and the seal&#x27;s words and emblems were likely inspired by the biblical phrase &quot;hope we have as an anchor of the soul,&quot; found in Hebrews, Verse 6:18-19. Rhode Island&#x27;s earliest colonists were fleeing persecution in Massachusetts due to their religious beliefs.

==Statute==
The state of Rhode Island enacted legislation making this the official flag:

§ 42-4-3 State flag. – The flag of the state shall be white, five feet and six inches (5&#x27;6&quot;) fly and four feet and ten inches (4&#x27;10&quot;) deep on the pike, bearing on each side in the center a gold anchor, twenty-two inches (22&quot;) high, and underneath it a blue ribbon twenty-four inches (24&quot;) long and five inches (5&quot;) wide, or in these proportions, with the motto &quot;Hope&quot; in golden letters thereon, the whole surrounded by thirteen (13) golden stars in a circle. The flag shall be edged with yellow fringe. The pike shall be surmounted by a spearhead and the length of the pike shall be nine feet (9&#x27;), not including the spearhead.
==Gallery==
==Other flags==

Another commonly flown flag is the flag of the Rhode Island Regiment. Many houses throughout the state display the flag alongside the current flag, or in lieu of the state flag. The flag can also be seen flying at home football games of the University of Rhode Island Rams.

== Flag of the governor ==
The flag of the governor of Rhode Island is based on an earlier state flag. Like most U.S. governors&#x27; flags, there are four five-point stars at the corners of the field.

<text>Biskupia Górka (, sometimes &quot;Bischofshügel&quot;) is a neighbourhood and hill in Gdańsk, Poland, located in the Śródmieście district. Historically, Biskupia Górka had important strategic meaning, since it is a hill close to the main city.

==History==
As part of the Kingdom of Poland it was a possession of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Włocławek, administratively located in the Gdańsk County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship. Fortifications were built on the hill in the 17th century. After the Partitions of Poland, Polish insurgents of the November Uprising were imprisoned by the Prussians in the fortifications.

Following the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II in 1939, the Germans established a subcamp of the Stalag XX-A prisoner-of-war camp, in which Polish POWs were held. It was later converted into a subcamp of the Stalag XX-B camp, and its prisoners were mostly the French. Some 1,200 POWs were held there as of December 31, 1940.

On July 4, 1946, eleven guards and kapos of the Stutthof concentration camp were publicly hanged for what was described as &quot;sadistic abuse of prisoners.&quot; Among those hanged were five women: Gerda Steinhoff, Wanda Klaff, Jenny-Wanda Barkmann, Ewa Paradies and Elisabeth Becker, all of whom had been convicted during the first Stutthof Trial, at Gdańsk between April 25 and May 31, 1946.

The former Mennonite church is located in Biskupia Górka.

<doc id="497254" wikidata="Q2487521" url="?curid=497254" title="Matter of France">
<text>The Matter of France (), also known as the Carolingian cycle, is a body of medieval literature and legendary material associated with the history of France, in particular involving Charlemagne and the Paladins. The cycle springs from the Old French &quot;chansons de geste&quot;, and was later adapted into a variety of art forms, including Renaissance epics and operas. It was one of the great European literary cycles that figured repeatedly in medieval literature.

==Three Matters==
The Matter of France was one of the &quot;Three Matters&quot; repeatedly recalled in medieval literature, the others being the Matter of Britain, relating to the legends of Great Britain and Brittany, and the Matter of Rome which represented the medieval poets&#x27; interpretations of Ancient Greek and Roman mythology and history. The three names were first used by the twelfth-century French poet Jean Bodel, author of the &quot;Chanson de Saisnes&quot;, a &quot;chanson de geste&quot; in which he wrote:
==Description==
About 1215 Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube, in the introductory lines to his &quot;Girart de Vienne&quot;, set out a subdivision of the Matter of France into three cycles, which have been adopted by many modern critics as a useful means of grouping the &quot;chansons de geste&quot;. These are his words:

The cycles can be outlined as follows:

* The &quot;Geste du roi&quot;, whose chief character is Charlemagne, seen as champion of Christianity. This cycle contains the best known of the &quot;chansons&quot;, the .
* &quot;La Geste de Garin de Monglane&quot;, whose central character was Guillaume d&#x27;Orange, identifiable with William, Count of Toulouse. These dealt with knights who were typically younger sons, not heirs, and who seek land and glory through combat with the Infidels. The twenty-four poems of this &quot;geste&quot; belong to the generation after Charlemagne, during the reign of an ineffectual Louis. The &quot;Chanson de Guillaume&quot; is one of the oldest poems of this &quot;geste&quot;.
* The &quot;Geste de Doon de Mayence&quot;, in which the hero, as in the &quot;Geste de Guillaume&quot;, often suffers from royal injustice, but is goaded into rebellion.

Central figures of the Matter of France include Charlemagne and his paladins, especially Roland, hero of &quot;The Song of Roland&quot;, and his companion Oliver, who was frequently cast in conflict with the Muslim champion Fierabras. Originally, the Matter of France contained tales of war and martial valour, being focused on the conflict between the Franks and Saracens or Moors during the period of Charles Martel and Charlemagne. The &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot;, for example, is about the Battle of Roncevaux Pass during the Moorish invasion of southern France. As the genre matured, elements of fantasy and magic tended to accrue to the tales. The magic horse Bayard, for example, is a recurring figure in many of the tales.

The fundamental character of the &quot;Matter of France&quot; is feudal and Christian (in a crusading form). Although viewed as idolators, the Saracens were not necessarily depicted as un-chivalrous. The earliest &quot;gestes&quot; were likely sung by a &quot;jongleur&quot;, accompanied by a fiddle. It is apparent that the authors were ignorant of the fact that Islam is monotheistic. D. J. A. Ross says that people of the Middle Ages appear to have regarded the &quot;gestes&quot; as generally historical.

Einhard&#x27;s &quot;Vita Caroli&quot; describes the Basque ambush at Roncevaux as driving the Frankish rearguard down the valley. The poet who wrote the &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot; did not hesitate to update the military tactics to a set-piece cavalry charge on the part of the Saracens, although retaining a landscape unsuitable for couched lances.

==List of works==

For a list of &quot;chansons&quot; that can be attached to each of these cycles, see .

==In later literature==
After the period of the &quot;chanson de geste&quot;, the Matter of France lived on. Its most well known survival is in the Italian epics by Matteo Maria Boiardo, Ludovico Ariosto, and a number of lesser authors who worked the material; their tales of &quot;Orlando innamorato&quot; (&quot;Roland in Love&quot;)&quot; and Orlando furioso&quot; (&quot;Roland Gone Mad&quot;) were inspired by the &quot;chansons de geste&quot;. These works, in turn, inspired Torquato Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Gerusalemme liberata&quot; and Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, although these latter works have been separated from the Matter of France and put in the respective settings of the First Crusade and an imaginary faerie land.

Tales of the Matter of France were also found in Old Norse, where the &quot;Karlamagnus Saga&quot; was written in the thirteenth century in Norway; it contains a synopsis of the main stories of the cycle. Indeed, until a major revival in the 19th century breathed new life into the Arthurian cycle, the Matter of France had enjoyed similar renown to the Matter of Britain.

Modern fantasy literature has used the Matter of France far less than the Matter of Britain, although L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt set one of their Harold Shea stories (&quot;The Castle of Iron&quot;) in the world of the Matter of France, and Poul Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Three Hearts and Three Lions&quot; references the Matter of France. Through Anderson&#x27;s book, the Matter of France also had some influence on the popular &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game. Italo Calvino&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Nonexistent Knight&quot; also takes place in this world.

<text>Manon Rhéaume (born February 24, 1972) is a Canadian former ice hockey goaltender. An Olympic silver medalist, she achieved a number of historic firsts during her career, including becoming the first woman to play in an exhibition game in any of the major North American pro-sports leagues.

In 1992, Rhéaume signed a contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning of the NHL, appearing in preseason exhibition games in 1992 and 1993. She spent five years in professional minor leagues, playing for a total of seven teams and appearing in 24 games. She also played on the Canada women&#x27;s national ice hockey team, winning gold medals at the IIHF Women&#x27;s World Championship in 1992 and 1994, and the silver medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics.

==Playing career==
Rhéaume, the first woman to play in the NHL, played for the Sherbrooke Jofa-Titan squad in the League Régionale du Hockey au Féminin in the province of Québec. She was the first female goaltender to play for a boys&#x27; team in the 1984 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament. Rhéaume was signed to the Trois-Rivières Draveurs in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, one of Canada&#x27;s top junior ice hockey leagues, for the 1991–92 season, becoming the first woman to play in a men&#x27;s Major Junior hockey game.

In 1992, Rhéaume tried out for the Tampa Bay Lightning; this was the first time a woman tried out for an NHL team. She played one period in a preseason game against the St. Louis Blues, allowing two goals on nine shots, and played in another preseason game against the Boston Bruins in 1993.

Also in 1992, Rhéaume was selected for the Canada national women&#x27;s ice hockey team. She won gold medals at the 1992 and 1994 IIHF Women&#x27;s World Championships, and was named to the All-Star team both years. She won the silver medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano.

In 1992, Rhéaume was signed by the Atlanta Knights of the International Hockey League (IHL). Her first appearance against the Salt Lake Golden Eagles marked the first time a woman appeared in a regular season professional game. She played for seven different teams between 1992 and 1997, including Atlanta, the Knoxville Cherokees, Nashville Knights, the Las Vegas Aces, the Tallahassee Tiger Sharks, Las Vegas Thunder, and the Reno Renegades, appearing in a total of 24 games. While in Atlanta, Rhéaume wrote her autobiography, &quot;Manon: Alone in Front of the Net&quot;. She initially retired from professional hockey in 1997.

==Later life==
For the 1999–2000 season, Rhéaume was the goaltending coach of the Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs women&#x27;s ice hockey program. She entered into the business world in 2000, serving as marketing director for Mission Hockey in Irvine, California, developing and promoting girls&#x27; hockey equipment for three years. She later worked in marketing at the Powerade Iceport in Milwaukee and with the Central Collegiate Hockey Association.

In 2008, Rhéaume suited up for the Minnesota Whitecaps of the Western Women&#x27;s Hockey League, and in 2009 helped lead them to the Clarkson Cup finals of the Canadian women&#x27;s ice hockey championships. On March 19, 2009, the Whitecaps, with Rhéaume in net, beat the Montreal Stars in a playoff game by a score of 4–3 in overtime, with Kim St. Pierre in net for the Stars. During the 2008–09 WWHL season, Rhéaume&#x27;s Whitecaps took two of three games from the Calgary Oval X-Treme, snapping a string that saw the X-Treme go two years without tasting defeat in the regular season.

In October 2008, the IHL&#x27;s Port Huron Icehawks announced plans to have Rhéaume take part in their training camp activities and play for at least one period of the team&#x27;s exhibition season opener. On April 3, 2009, Rhéaume suited up for one game with the Flint Generals IHL team. She had been with the practice team since January, filling in for their regular goalie. Rhéaume is the third woman to play for the Generals.

In 2015, Rhéaume dropped the puck in the ceremonial opening faceoff before the first National Women&#x27;s Hockey League game.

In October 2021, Rhéaume was hired by Bally Sports Detroit as an analyst and reporter for the Detroit Red Wings.

She was a goaltender for the 2022 NHL All-Star game&#x27;s Breakaway Challenge.

Rhéaume was hired in July 2022 as hockey operations and prospect advisor for the Los Angeles Kings.

==Media and popular culture==
Rhéaume guest-starred as herself in the made-for-TV movie &quot;A Beachcombers Christmas&quot; with Tiger Williams and Jyrki Lumme. At the height of her popularity, she was approached to pose for &quot;Playboy Magazine&quot;, which she refused.

In 2011, Rhéaume took part in the Quebec TV show &quot;Le défi des champions&quot; (Champions&#x27; Challenge), a show that trained eight Quebec athletes (such as Isabelle Charest, Bruny Surin, Marc Gagnon, Marie-Andrée Lessard, Étienne Boulay, Nathalie Lambert and Mathieu Dandenault) to the art of the circus.

In June 2016, Rhéaume was mentioned in an episode of the show &quot;Bones&quot;, (season 11, episode 18), as the only woman to play in an NHL game.

==Personal life==
Rhéaume was married to Gerry St. Cyr, a minor league hockey player and roller hockey player, in June 1998, whom she later divorced. They have one son, Dylan. A goaltender like his mother, Dylan St. Cyr played for the Michigan State Spartans and previously served as goaltender for Notre Dame and Quinnipiac University.

After her divorce from Gerry St. Cyr, Rhéaume married her second husband, with whom she had a second son, Dakoda Rhéaume-Mullen, a defenseman who was drafted in the 2022 OHL Priority selection by the Sarnia Sting, 124th overall in the 7th round, and now plays for the Michigan Wolverines collegiately.

Rhéaume formed the Manon Rhéaume Foundation in 2008, which provides scholarships for young women.

She is the older sister of former NHL player Pascal Rhéaume.

<doc id="497260" wikidata="Q19373" url="?curid=497260" title="Flag of South Carolina">
<text>The flag of South Carolina is a symbol of the U.S. state of South Carolina consisting of a blue field with a white palmetto tree and white crescent. Roots of this design have existed in some form since 1775, being based on one of the first American Revolutionary War flags. While keeping most of its design intact since its adoption, it has varied over the years.

==History==
===Moultrie Flag===
In 1775, Colonel William Moultrie was asked by the Revolutionary Council of Safety to design a flag for the South Carolina troops to use during the American Revolutionary War. Moultrie&#x27;s design had the blue of the militia&#x27;s uniforms and a crescent taken from their cap insignia. It was first flown at Fort Johnson. 

This flag was famously flown in the defense of a new fortress on Sullivan&#x27;s Island, when Moultrie faced off against a British fleet. In the 16-hour battle on June 28, 1776, the flag was shot down, but Sergeant William Jasper ran out into the open, raising it and rallying the troops until it could be mounted again. This gesture was considered to be so heroic, saving Charleston from conquest for four years, that the flag came to be the symbol of the Revolution, and liberty, in the state and the new nation.

Soon popularly known as either the Liberty Flag or Moultrie Flag, it became the standard of the South Carolinian militia and was presented in Charleston by Major General Nathanael Greene when the city was liberated at the end of the war. Greene described it as having been the first American flag to fly over the South.

===American Civil War===

The palmetto was added in 1861, also a reference to Moultrie&#x27;s defense of Sullivan&#x27;s Island; the fortress he had constructed had survived largely because the palmettos, laid over sand walls, were able to withstand British cannon.

Following its declaration of secession from the Union, the newly independent state of South Carolina considered many designs for its &quot;National Flag&quot;, with the first official draft for a flag being finalized on January 21, which was a white ensign with a green palmetto, and a blue canton with a white increscent. After a week of debate, they decided on an existing unofficial state flag with an upward facing crescent on a blue field, modifying it by adding a palmetto at the center of the field. On January 26, 1861, the South Carolina General Assembly adopted a new flag by adding a golden palmetto encircled with a white background. This flag has become known as the &quot;2-day flag&quot; because the golden palmetto was changed to its current design after two days on January 28 to a simple white palmetto on the blue background. 

The Palmetto Flag quickly became a symbol of the secessionist movement. During the secession winter, it was unfurled at various places around the country, even as far away as Nebraska City, Nebraska, by pockets of Southern partisans. Less than three months after its adoption, a variation of the palmetto flag unfurled over Fort Sumter on April 14, 1861, the day it was occupied by the Confederate Army, making it the first of the Confederate flags to replace the Stars and Stripes of the United States of America, from which the Confederacy had seceded. The flag consisted of a palmetto on an entirely white background with a red star in the upper left quadrant and is commonly known as &quot;The Palmetto Guard Flag.

The Sovereignty flag was never recognized as an official flag in South Carolina, but there are also claims that it was flown for a short period of time in South Carolina after its secession on December 20, 1860. Another significant flag is the &quot;South Carolina Secession Flag&quot;; the day after South Carolina seceded, a red flag with two tails, a large white star and a down-right facing crescent at the top by the flag staff was raised over the Charleston Custom House. It then spread to other cities as a symbol of secession.
At the beginning of the American Civil War a similar flag was flown at Morris Island by cadets from The Citadel as they fired upon United States supply ships.

== Origin of the crescent ==
William Moultrie states in his memoirs: &quot;A little time after we were in possession of Fort Johnson, it was thought necessary to have a flag for the purpose of signals: (as there was no national or state flag at that time) I was desired by the council of safety to have one made, upon which, as the state troops were clothed in blue, and the fort was garrisoned by the first and second regiments, who wore a silver crescent on the front of their caps; I had a large blue flag made with a crescent in the dexter corner, to be in uniform with the troops ...&quot;

Moultrie&#x27;s original design placed the crescent vertically, with the opening directing upward. The 1860s flag also shows the crescent with upward pointing cusps. However, in 1910—for reasons that he did not document—Alexander Samuel Salley Jr., secretary of the state&#x27;s Historical Commission, angled the crescent to its current orientation.

== Design standardization ==

While the flag invariably includes a white palmetto and crescent design on a blue background, state law since 1940 has not provided &quot;specifications for the shape, size, design or placement&quot; of the symbols, or the exact color of the background. As a result, flags from different manufacturers may have different appearances. A committee of the South Carolina Senate held a hearing on the issue in January 2018 but did not immediately advance a bill to standardize the design.

A standardized design was revealed in 2020 but was immediately met with major backlash from the public for its perceived poor design and aesthetics. Two other designs were then proposed, one of which will become the official standardized version. However, , legislation has been procedurally roadblocked, with State Senator Brad Hutto being a core oppositional force to design standardization.

== Reception ==

The South Carolina state flag is considered by flag experts as one of the top state flags in the United States. In a 2001 survey of U.S. and Canadian subdivisional flags by the North American Vexillological Association the South Carolina flag ranked 10th out of 72—6th out of 50 U.S. states.

==Commercial use==

Shirts, belts, shoes, wallets, koozies, holiday decorations and other accessories featuring the flag&#x27;s palmetto and crescent are popular throughout South Carolina and other southeastern states as a symbol of the state&#x27;s long-standing heritage. It is also common for alumni and supporters of the state&#x27;s main universities (the University of South Carolina, Clemson University, Coastal Carolina University, Furman University, the College of Charleston, Winthrop University, Wofford College, and The Citadel) to display the state flag in their school colors.

<text>The current flag of South Dakota was adopted in 1992 to represent the U.S. state of South Dakota. It consists of a field of sky blue charged with a version (in navy blue on white) of the state seal in the center, surrounded by gold triangles representing the sun&#x27;s rays, surrounded in turn by inscriptions in gold sans-serif capitals of &quot; on top and &quot; (the state nickname) on the bottom. The sun represents the common weather in South Dakota.

The first state flag was designed and adopted in 1909. This original flag was bi-faced, with a sun motif on one side and the state seal on the other. A redesign in 1963 embedded the state seal inside the original flag&#x27;s sun motif. The inscription on the bottom was &quot;&quot; before it was changed in 1992.

==History==
===Original flag (1909)===

The first flag of South Dakota was designed by Ida McNeil in 1909. Ernest May, a state legislator from Deadwood, approached South Dakota Department of History superintendent Doane Robinson about the lack of a state flag. McNeil was then a legislative reference librarian at the state department. McNeil later recalled that during their meeting, Robinson turned to her and told May, &quot;Miss Anding will make you a flag&quot;.

Seth Bullock, a Deadwood lawman, is sometimes credited as having brought forth the original request for a state flag to May, who in turn brought it to the state department. This claim might have originated from a 1948 edition of &quot;The Wi-Iyohi&quot;, a monthly bulletin published by the South Dakota State Historical Society. However, South Dakota historians and biographers of Bullock have not uncovered any evidence supporting this claim, and Robinson&#x27;s 1925 &quot;Encyclopedia of South Dakota&quot; did not include any mention of Bullock&#x27;s involvement.

Robinson only requested that the flag include a sun motif, as the state receives a considerable amount of sunshine, and also suggested placing the state seal on the reverse side. This first flag was made from silk upon which McNeil first placed the sun&#x27;s appliqué and then embroidered its rays. The phrases &quot; and &quot; were embroidered in arcs surrounding the sun. The state seal was then painted on a second piece of silk, which was attached to the back of the first piece to make a two-sided flag.

Senate Bill 208 was introduced and passed on November 9, 1909. It stated: 
The first two flags went to the Secretary of State and Seth Bullock. Bullock&#x27;s flag is now preserved at the state archives.

In 2015, the original state flag was reported as missing from the South Dakota State Capitol in Pierre. Secretary of State Shantel Krebs, within whose office the flag had been on display, and department employee Theresa Bray initially noted the disappearance on January 2. The capitol conducted internal searches for several weeks but was unable to find the flag. It was then reported to the Legislative Audit office, who then referred it to the South Dakota Attorney General&#x27;s Office. In October 2015, the flag was recovered in Washington, D.C. from a former state employee, who had removed it from storage in 2013 while repairs were being done to the display.

===First redesign (1963)===

By 1963, the need for a revised flag was evident. The two-sided design was difficult and costly to reproduce—about $75 for materials in 1963 ()—and McNeil recreated the flags upon request for various state organizations. The designs on both sides often showed through to the other.

William Sahr, a state representative from Hughes County, introduced House Bill 503 to redesign the state flag, reducing it down to one side and moving the state seal to inside the sun motif. His design kept the wording from the original. McNeil supported the redesign but was against transposing the state seal onto the front, stating, &quot;Many states use state seals on their flags and if we copy their efforts... we will lose the individuality of our flag&quot;. The measure passed and was signed into law on March 11, 1963.

On February 3, 1966, the South Dakota Legislature approved a further measure to create the Special State Flag Account, which set aside funds for the production and purchasing of new flags, and directed the finance department to keep on hand a stock of flags to be distributed as needed.

===Second redesign (1992)===
Following the adoption of the new state nickname as &quot;the Mount Rushmore state&quot;, State Representative Gordon Pederson introduced a new bill to change the wording on the state flag. Although the new design was adopted and remains in use today, the 1963 and 1992 bills both included language that the previous versions of the state flag were still valid to use.

==Design==
1992 statute outlines the exact specifications for production of the flag:
==Flag pledge==
The official pledge of the South Dakota flag is, &quot;I pledge loyalty and support to the flag and state of South Dakota, land of sunshine, land of infinite variety.&quot; The only protocol to the state flag pledge is that it does not either replace or preempt the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the United States.

==Reception==
In 2001, vexillologists rated 72 flags representing US states and Canadian provinces and territories. South Dakota’s flag was rated as the fifth worst. 

The flag of South Dakota does not meet modern flag design principles, especially with the city seal in the center. Vexillologists deride flags with a seal as &quot;SOBs&quot;, or &quot;seals on a bedsheets&quot;, because seals were designed for pieces of paper. Like South Dakota’s, over half of US state flags have a seal on a blue background, which makes them indistinguishable from each other at a distance. Moreover, South Dakota’s flag has both a seal and lettering, in which the name of the state appears twice in what should be a graphic symbol.

==Redesign proposals==
=== 2012 ===

In January 2012, Representative Bernie Hunhoff sponsored a bill to adopt a new design for the state flag based on artwork by Dick Termes of Spearfish, South Dakota. Hunhoff introduced the bill on January 25, 2012; it was referred to the State Affairs committee. On February 6, the bill was amended to create the South Dakota State Flag Commission, which would have solicited submissions from the public for new flag designs and selected one to be considered by the 2013 legislature as the new state flag. Immediately after being amended, the bill was &quot;deferred to the 41st legislative day&quot;. Since the South Dakota legislative session is only 40 days long, this type of deferral effectively kills legislation.

=== 2024 ===
In January 2024, another bill that would have created a South Dakota state flag design commission was killed in the same manner to the 2012 proposal.

<text>The flag of Tennessee is the official flag of the U.S. state of Tennessee. The flag displays an emblem on a field of red, with a strip of blue bordered by white on the fly. The emblem in the middle consists of three white stars on a blue circle also with a white border. The central emblem portion of the flag has been adopted as the state&#x27;s unofficial logo, and appears in the logos of some Tennessee-based companies and sports teams. Examples include the First Horizon Bank and the Tennessee Titans.

In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, territorial, and Canadian provincial flags and ranked the Tennessee flag 14th.

==History==
In 1897, Tennessee adopted a red, white, and blue tricolor. The three bars were deliberately slanted in an effort to represent the geographically distinct regions of Tennessee. The flag included the number &quot;16&quot;, Tennessee having been admitted as the 16th state of the Union, and the words &quot;The Volunteer State&quot;, the state&#x27;s official nickname.

The current flag was designed by Colonel Le Roy Reeves, a Johnson City attorney who was then serving in the Tennessee National Guard. The Tennessee General Assembly officially adopted the flag on April 17, 1905.

==Description==

===Symbolism===
The stars represent the three geographically and legally distinct Grand Divisions of Tennessee (i.e. East, Middle, and West Tennessee). The blue circle around the stars represents the unity of those grand divisions. The blue bar at the edge of the flag was just a design consideration. When asked about the blue bar, Reeves stated &quot;The final blue bar relieves the sameness of the crimson field and prevents the flag from showing too much crimson when hanging limp.&quot; In October 1917, &quot;National Geographic&quot; erroneously reported the stars represented the state as the third to enter the Union after the original thirteen.

===Star arrangement===
State law dictates exactly how the central emblem is to be displayed on the flag.

In 1976, the U.S. Postal Service issued a sheet of 13 cent stamps illustrating U.S. state flags. Tennessee&#x27;s was illustrated upside down.

==Government flags==

Alongside the state flag, there are other flags used by the government of Tennessee. The flag for the governor of Tennessee has been in use since 1939. It is a scarlet flag, with four stars, one in each corner, and the state military crest, a tree with three white stars, in the center. The Tennessee General Assembly has its own flag as well.

<doc id="497273" wikidata="Q1564309" url="?curid=497273" title="HMS Antrim (D18)">
<text>HMS &quot;Antrim&quot; was a destroyer of the British Royal Navy launched on 19 October 1967. In the Falklands War, she was the flagship for the recovery of South Georgia, participating in the first ever anti-submarine operation successfully conducted exclusively by helicopters.
In 1984, she was commissioned into the Chilean Navy, and renamed Almirante Cochrane.

==Background==
&quot;Antrim&quot; first commissioned in 1970 and served her first commission in home and Mediterranean waters. In the mid-1970s, the Royal Navy removed &#x27;B&#x27; turret and replaced it with four Exocet missile launchers to give her a greater anti-ship capability.
After installation of the Exocet missiles it was found that the missile could be activated by small arms fire, so armoured plates were fitted to the outer sides of the missiles containers.

==Operational history==
In 1976 her commission included a visit to Stockholm, where she represented the Royal Navy at the wedding of the King of Sweden.

===Falklands War===
In 1982 she formed part of the Royal Navy task force for service in the Falklands War.

&quot;Antrim&quot; was the flagship of Operation Paraquet, the recovery of South Georgia in April 1982, where she took part in a 400-shell bombardment.
Her helicopter, a Westland Wessex HAS.Mk3, was responsible for the rescue of 16 SAS men from Fortuna Glacier, and the crew of two previous rescue helicopters that had crashed. The aircraft played a key role in the detection and disabling of the Argentinian submarine . This was the first ever anti-submarine operation successfully conducted exclusively by helicopters.
Captain Lagos, commander of the Argentine forces on South Georgia, signed the surrender document for the Argentine forces there in her wardroom. Lieutenant-Commander Alfredo Astiz signed a separate document shortly afterwards aboard .

While supporting the main landing at San Carlos Water, 12 bombs narrowly missed, but a bomb penetrated &quot;Antrim&quot;. It did not explode or kill anyone, and it took 10 hours to remove. &quot;Antrim&quot; fired her Sea Slug missile system at an Argentine Air Force Douglas A-4 Skyhawk without hitting it.

A name board formerly belonging to her now resides in the Falkland Islands Museum, Stanley.
==Chilean Navy==

&quot;Antrim&quot; was decommissioned in 1984 and sold to Chile on 22 June 1984. The Chileans renamed her &quot;Almirante Cochrane&quot; after Thomas Cochrane, who had commanded the Chilean Navy from 1817 to 1822. In 1994, &quot;Almirante Cochrane&quot; underwent the same refit as her sister ship &quot;Blanco Encalada&quot; (HMS &quot;Fife&quot;). This entailed removing her Sea Slug launcher and extending her deck aft to allow the installation of a new, larger hangar. In 1996 she received the Barak SAM in place of her Seacat launchers.

The Chilean Navy decommissioned &quot;Almirante Cochrane&quot; on 7 December 2006. On 11 December 2010, she was towed to China for scrap.

==Affiliates as HMS &quot;Antrim&quot;==
*Royal Irish Rangers
As part of her relationship with County Antrim, she carried a piece of the Giant&#x27;s Causeway mounted in the ship&#x27;s main passageway, appropriately also named the Giant&#x27;s Causeway.

==Commanding officers==
Notable commanding officers include D A Loram 1971-1973 and B G Young 1981-1983.

<text>The Beehive Flag is the official flag of the U.S. state of Utah. It is a horizontal tricolor with irregular bands of blue, white, and red. The middle white band contains a blue hexagon outlined in gold. Within the hexagon lies a gold-colored beehive with a five-pointed white star below it.

The previous flag was re-designated as the &quot;Historic State Flag&quot; and retains co-official status in the state. It continues to fly year-round at the Utah Capitol, as well as on special occasions statewide. It can be flown at any time by private citizens.

==Symbolism==
The red, white, and blue tricolor references the colors of the flag of the United States. At the top, a blue stripe symbolizes Utah&#x27;s skies and lakes and fundamental principles such as faith, knowledge, and freedom. It also imitates the blue background of the state&#x27;s historic flag. The white middle stripe evokes peace and is divided into five peaks, representing the snowy peaks of Utah&#x27;s mountains. Below, a red canyon stripe signifies Southern Utah&#x27;s desert landscapes and the spirit of perseverance. In the center of the flag, a beehive design represents Utah&#x27;s industrial character and official nickname, the Beehive State. The gold hexagon resembles honeycomb, representing the strength of Utah&#x27;s people. The beehive within the hexagon symbolizes industry, prosperity, and unity. Below the beehive is a five-pointed star, which honors the five original tribal nations in Utah, and also alludes to Utah&#x27;s 45th star on the American flag, representing the state&#x27;s allegiance to the nation.

===Color scheme===
The colors designated for the flag are as follows:

==History==
===Pre-statehood===
====Mormon pioneers flags====

As allegedly designed by council in 1848, this flag was the first flag designed to unify the Saints as they celebrated their first pioneer day. This flag was lost in the 1850s but later recreated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 2002 and has flown on Ensign Peak since. Contemporary reports describe similar flags being flown in 1877 at the funeral of Brigham Young and in 1880 at the Golden Jubilee of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. There is currently no historic documentation available to support this flag. The pioneers also carried a banner that was described as bearing a portrait of Joseph Smith and angel holding a scroll with the names of all the pioneers.

====Flag of the State of Deseret====
According to most descriptions, the flag of the State of Deseret was similar to the flag of the State of Utah, but as it was not standardized, multiple other secular and religious alternatives were also used.

====Utah Territory====

Blue fabric with the old coat of arms of Utah Territory. There is currently no evidence that the Utah Territory flag was made into an actual flag to fly during the Territory&#x27;s existence (1850–1896), though copies have since been made. In the early years of the Territory, many of the pioneers flew unique homemade American flags.

===State of Utah===

==== Statehood flags ====
When Utah became the 45th state in 1896, American flags across the country flew 45 stars. It was one of the biggest American flags was made at that time. The flag was around 74 feet high and 132 feet long and hung from the ceiling of the Salt Lake Tabernacle. One year later it was moved to south wall of the Salt Lake Temple were it flew until 1903. The first state flag was flown in 1894, Its design is not known. The second state flag was flown 3 years later, but it was not described.

====1903 design====

The flag&#x27;s basic design uses the Seal of Utah which was adopted by the state legislature on April 3, 1896. The seal was designed by Charles M. Jackson, a crime reporter for the Salt Lake Herald, and Harry Emmett Edwards, an artist and bartender, and has similarities with the seal of the Utah Territory. The state&#x27;s first flag was created in March 1903 to be used at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri. Heber M. Wells, the governor of Utah, asked the Utah State Society Daughters of the Revolution (not to be confused with Daughters of the American Revolution) to oversee the creation of a flag. On May 1, 1903, the governor and his delegation marched, under the new flag, in the parade of states. The flag was blue, with the state seal and the year &quot;1896&quot; hand-embroidered in white thread in the flag&#x27;s center. Initially, this flag was known as the &quot;Governor&#x27;s Flag&quot; until Senate Joint Resolution 17 was passed by the legislature on March 9, 1911, making it the official state flag.

====1913 design====

In 1912, the Sons and Daughters of Utah Pioneers ordered a custom made copy of the newly adopted flag to be presented to the recently commissioned battleship . When the flag arrived, the group discovered that the shield on the flag was in full color instead of white, and the manufacturer had added a gold ring around the shield. Rather than have the flag remade, Annie Wells Cannon introduced HJR 1 and the Utah legislature changed the law to allow the manufacturer&#x27;s changes to become part of the official flag. Prior to being received by the ship on June 25, 1913, the new flag was displayed at the state capitol in January 1913, then in the ZCMI windows on Main Street and at a ball held in honor of the flag.

During the 59th state legislative session in 2011, a Concurrent Resolution (HCR002) was adopted requiring flag makers to fix a mistake found on all then-current Utah state flags. The mistake originated in 1922 when a flag maker misplaced the year 1847, by stitching it just above the year 1896, instead of in its correct position on the shield. It is believed every flag made since 1922 used this flag as a model, and the mistake persisted for 89 years. Later that same 2011 session, House Bill #490 passed the legislature, making March 9 an annual Utah State Flag day.

=====1927 redesign attempt=====

In 1927, Governor George Dern, during his address to the Utah State Legislature, requested the state adopt a much simpler flag that could be made quickly and cheaply and could fly alongside the American flag. Nothing was done, however, until in 1930 when flag enthusiast Lilliebell Falck, from Ogden, approached him with a few simplified designs. Her favorite was a white beehive with 28 lines to represent Utah&#x27;s counties. However, with growing opposition to the design by the Sons and Daughters of Utah Pioneers, the design was eventually scrapped later that year.

=====Salt Lake Tribune design contest (2002)=====
In 2002, &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot;, along with the North American Vexillological Association, solicited designs for a new state flag. Over 1,000 designs were collected, with the top 35 selected for judging. However, no flags from this contest were adopted by the state.

====2024 design====
In 2018, State Representatives Steve Handy and Keven Stratton proposed 2 different approaches to updating the Utah flag. Representative Handy proposed creating a flag commission to receive input and designs from the public, with the ultimate goal of proposing a new flag to the legislature. Representative Stratton sponsored separate legislation to adopt a specific flag design. The Utah House of Representatives was more amenable to a proposal to involve the public with a commission, but ultimately both efforts failed in 2019.

Representative Handy proposed another bill in 2020, this time keeping the 2011 design as a &quot;historical flag&quot;. However, the effort stalled in the House Political Subdivisions Committee on a tie vote.

After a failed 2020 redesign effort, State Senator Daniel McCay started a bill in the Utah Senate. To prepare for the debate, the House and Senate watched a TED Talk by Roman Mars, &quot;Why city flags may be the worst designed thing you&#x27;ve never noticed.&quot; In addition to the Ted Talk, the lead designer for the Utah Jazz, Ben Barnes, shared a set of prototype designs for lawmakers.

In 2021, Senator McCay sponsored a bill to create a task force to redesign the Utah state flag. The bill also designated an official flag to commemorate the 125th anniversary of Utah&#x27;s statehood. The bill passed in the House and the Senate and was signed into law by Governor Spencer Cox.

In 2022, the Utah State Flag Task Force accepted design submissions from the public. 5,703 designs were submitted, 2,500 of which were submitted by students. In September, 20 semifinalist designs were announced and Utahns were asked to submit their feedback. During the month-long comment period, 44,000 survey responses were given.

On November 10, 2022, the Task Force submitted a final proposal to the Utah State Legislature for adoption as the official state flag. On January 18, 2023, the Utah Senate Business and Labor Committee voted 6–1 to advance the flag to the State Senate, with McCay saying he hoped the new flag design will reach Spencer Cox&#x27;s desk by March 3.

On January 30, 2023, the State Senate approved the bill 17–10, which advanced to the State House of Representatives for approval. However, the flag was slightly modified; the eight-pointed star was replaced by a five-pointed star after an Indigenous constituent expressed reservations over the former, saying it looked more like an asterisk from a distance. In consultation with tribal leaders, tribal representation shifted to the 5 mountain peaks to represent the five original tribal nations of Utah (Navajo, Shoshone, Goshute, Paiute and Ute).

On March 2, 2023, the Utah House of Representatives approved the bill 40–35, and the State Senate passed the concurrence vote 19–9–1, sending the bill to the governor&#x27;s desk for signing.

The bill was signed by Governor Cox on March 21, 2023, along with an executive order formalizing the change. The bill—and the new flag—went into effect on March 9, 2024, thus providing a one-year phase-in period to gradually transition to the new flag. The bill also designates the prior design as the official historic flag which may continue to be used by all. The executive order mandates that the historic state flag be flown above the state capitol every day of the year and once the bill goes into effect, the two flags should be flown from different flagpoles on capitol grounds. The order also petitions the legislature to amend the bill to allow the new flag to be flown below the historic state flag when they are flown together.

A public opinion poll conducted by the Hinckley Institute of Politics in March 2023 found that 48% of respondents supported the new flag, 35% opposed it, and 17% didn&#x27;t know.

On May 17, 2023, the Utah State Capitol raised the new flag for the first time.

==== Attempts to remove the 2024 flag ====

Opponents of the new flag announced a campaign to initiate a 2023 ballot referendum on the adoption on the flag, hoping to retain the old flag, in spite of language in the bill that retains the historic state flag. The signature campaign failed, ultimately receiving only 21,030 verified signatures; official verification was halted after fewer than 50,000 signatures of the 134,298 required were submitted to county clerks.

Flag opponents launched a second signature campaign to put the issue on the 2024 ballot as an initiative. That campaign also failed, gathering 99,125 signatures. (The lieutenant governor&#x27;s office had only validated 81,992 before the deadline, the remaining 17,133 signatures left unvalidated would not have been enough to cross the threshold of 134,298 signatures to qualify for the ballot.) On February 8, 2024, a group linked to the campaign filed a federal lawsuit against the lieutenant governor, alleging that ten separate provisions of the citizen initiative process that the legislature created were unconstitutional. The group sought injunctive relief for the alleged violations, but were denied on all counts. Subsequently, the group withdrew the lawsuit two days later.

During Utah&#x27;s 2024 legislative session, Representative Phil Lyman put forward House Bill 436 in the Utah House of Representatives. The bill would have repealed the new flag, but it failed to advance out of committee.

== Flag of the governor ==

Utah does not currently have a flag that represents the governor. The first governor flag was used in 1854 by Brigham Young at his residence. It was described as an American flag but with a lion in its canton. The lion was in reference to Brigham&#x27;s nickname, &quot;The Lion of the Lord.&quot;

<doc id="497276" wikidata="Q5632128" url="?curid=497276" title="HMS Devonshire (D02)">
<text>HMS &quot;Devonshire&quot; was the first of the destroyers and the first Batch 1 ship of the Royal Navy. The ship was built by Cammell Laird in Birkenhead near Liverpool. With a displacement of 6,200 tons full load, &quot;Devonshire&quot; was named after the English county of Devon. She was launched on 10 June 1960 and delivered to the navy two years later.

==Operational service==

In 1962 &quot;Devonshire&quot; was commissioned and became the first operational Royal Navy ship to fire the Seaslug missile. Following work up, she sailed for the Mediterranean, followed by a return to her home port of Portsmouth. From here she then sailed for Bermuda and the United States. She returned to Portsmouth just before the end of 1962.
Captain George Cunningham Leslie OBE, served as Commanding officer from 1965 to 1966.

On 31 August 1966, &quot;Devonshire&quot; collided with the tanker &quot;British Sovereign&quot; off the mouth of the River Elbe. No-one was injured on either ship.

Captain Peter Buchanan served as Commanding Officer from 1973 to 1974. &quot;Devonshire&quot; was involved in patrol duties in the Persian Gulf and the Caribbean Sea, but was not involved in any armed conflict of the United Kingdom. Like the other first batch of County-class ships, &quot;Devonshire&quot; was fitted with the Seaslug anti aircraft missile defence system. She attended the 1977 Silver Jubilee Fleet Review off Spithead when she was part of the First Flotilla.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Devonshire&quot; was decommissioned under defence cuts in 1978, though was immediately offered for sale to Egypt, but the sale did not go through. Laid up in Portsmouth harbour for six years, the ship was used as a target, first for testing the new Sea Eagle anti-ship missile, then sunk by as a target on 17 July 1984 (two days after the Sea Eagle test) in the North Atlantic, whilst testing the Mark 24-Mod-2 Tigerfish torpedo.

<doc id="497277" wikidata="Q5632421" url="?curid=497277" title="HMS Fife (D20)">
<text>HMS &quot;Fife&quot; was the first unit of the Batch 2 destroyers of the Royal Navy. She was subsequently sold to Chile and scrapped in 2005.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Fife&quot; was the first and only British warship to bear the name, for the county of Fife. She was a Mk.2 Guided Missile Destroyer (GMD, also referred to pre-1975 by its then US Navy/NATO designator DLG (Destroyer, Light, Guided (USN &#x27;Frigate&#x27;) carrying long range surface to air missiles for area defence; post-1975 DDG, &#x27;destroyer&#x27; with similar characteristics). The Mk.2 designator refers to her primary armament, the Seaslug Mk.2 missile. The weapon had begun development in the early fifties and entered service in the Mk.1 GMDs like . By modern standards the Seaslug was a huge missile with one sustainer rocket motor and 4 disposable boosters. The missile used &#x27;beam riding&#x27; guidance. It was launched from a huge twin-rail launcher in the stern and boosted into the guidance beam from the fire direction radar which pointed at the target, a high altitude supersonic attack aircraft. Once in the beam the missile would fly at supersonic speed to the target where a proximity fuze would detect the target and detonate the continuous rod warhead.

The ship was ordered by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) on 26 September 1961. The keel was laid on 1 June 1962 by Fairfield Shipbuilding and the vessel was launched 9 July 1964. &quot;Fife&quot; was commissioned 21 June 1966 with the pennant number D20.

==Royal Navy service==
In 1969, &quot;Fife&quot; took part in a group deployment around the world. She left Portsmouth on 1 April 1970 and sailed to Safi in Morocco; the first visit by a British warship for over 100 years. Then to Lagos in Nigeria just at the end of the Biafran War. From Lagos to Simon&#x27;s Town in South Africa. The gates of the former British naval base still bore the royal cypher, VR. From Simonstown, she briefly took part in the Beira Patrol off the shores of Mozambique after Prime Minister Ian Smith declared Rhodesia&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence. The Beira Patrol was a naval blockade to enforce economic sanctions on the errant regime. From there she crossed the Indian Ocean and stopped off at the NATO base on the island of Gan en route to Singapore. There she spent six weeks in an Assisted Maintenance Period (AMP) before heading for the South China Sea to conduct the first live firings of the Sea Slug Mk.2 area-protection anti-aircraft missile. The ship had been refitted in Portsmouth to accommodate a larger payload of missiles and this work was completed in Singapore where she took on live missiles. The trials were partially successful against US targets from bases in the Philippines. One failure was a result of the telemetry beam nutating waveguide breaking off and one booster motor failing to disengage. The missile crashed into the sea about 1 mile into the flight. After this she went to Hong Kong and Kobe in Japan for Expo 70, before heading to Pearl Harbor on Hawaii and then on to Long Beach in California and Acapulco in Mexico and via the Panama Canal to Puerto Rico and on to the Mediterranean. She visited Toulon and spent time in Malta and Gibraltar before returning to the UK. Whilst in Hawaii, the Royal Navy abolished the rum issue. As a result, &quot;Fife&quot; became the last ship in the Navy to issue rum by virtue of being the furthest west in the Pacific. The Hawaiian media came on board and were quite bemused when the ship&#x27;s senior ratings staged a mock burial at sea, complete with a Piper&#x27;s Lament provide by the ship&#x27;s pipe and drum band and pall bearers dressed in black.

Her commanding officer for this voyage was Captain David Scott, who had been the 1st Lieutenant of in the Second World War when the submarine executed Operation Mincemeat, a successful deception operation to disguise the 1943 Allied invasion of Sicily.

&quot;Fife&quot; had &#x27;B&#x27; turret removed and replaced with four Exocet launchers in the mid-1970s. In 1977 she attended the Silver Jubilee Fleet Review and formed part of the 2nd Flotilla. In 1979 she provided assistance to the Caribbean island of Dominica after the island was severely hit by Hurricane David, for which she was awarded the Wilkinson Sword of Peace. She was under refit from October 1980 to December 1982, and therefore missed the Falklands War. Changes included replacing the old Wessex helicopter with a Westland Lynx, fitting a satellite communications system and anti-submarine torpedo tubes. She formally recommissioned after the refit on 31 March 1983.

==Refit 1986==
In 1986, &quot;Fife&quot; underwent a refit to convert her into a mobile training ship. The removal of her Seaslug missile system and its large magazine was completed in June 1986, which created space for extra messdecks and classrooms for officers under training. One messdeck still used hammocks and these officers are possibly the last men in the Royal Navy to sleep in hammocks; they were told so at the time. In early September 1986 she undertook a Dartmouth Training Ship (DTS) deployment to the Caribbean Sea and Florida, returning to Portsmouth in late November. She was accompanied on this deployment by the frigates and .

A &quot;hut&quot; was built where the Seaslug launcher had once stood, aft of the helicopter pad. This grey box was a navigation training classroom and attracted much attention from a Russian , which regularly &quot;buzzed&quot; &quot;Fife&quot; for some close quarter photographs.

Her second Dartmouth Training Ship deployment in January 1987 took her via Brest into the Mediterranean Sea, in company with . Her final voyage in the Royal Navy was to lead a Dartmouth Training Ship deployment to North America, in which she and sailed into the Great Lakes. On her return to Great Britain in June 1987 she landed the officers under training at Dartmouth and then proceeded to Portsmouth where she was decommissioned after 21 years of service.

==Chilean Navy service==
The ship was sold to Chile on 12 August 1987 and renamed &quot;Blanco Encalada&quot;. She was taken into refit at Talcahuano on her arrival and, taking advantage of the removed Sea Slug, her deck was extended aft and a new, larger hangar constructed. The rebuild was completed in May 1988. In 1996 &quot;Blanco Encalada&quot;″s Sea Cat launchers were removed and she was fitted with the Barak SAM.

&quot;Blanco Encalada&quot; was decommissioned from the Chilean Navy on 12 December 2003 and was sold for scrap in November 2005. She was broken up by Turkish shipbreakers Leyal Gemi Sokum in 2013.

==Commanding officers==
Notable commanding officers include David Hallifax (1973-1975), David M Eckersley-Maslin in 1975, J Jeremy Black (1977-1978) and Jonathan J R Tod (1985-1985).

<doc id="497278" wikidata="Q369640" url="?curid=497278" title="HMS Glamorgan (D19)">
<text>HMS &quot;Glamorgan&quot; was a destroyer of the Royal Navy with a displacement of 5,440 tonnes. The ship was built by Vickers-Armstrongs in Newcastle Upon Tyne and named after the Welsh county of Glamorgan.

She was launched on 9 July 1964, and was delivered to the Royal Navy two years later. in 1974, she was the subject of a refit, when &#x27;B&#x27; turret was replaced by four Exocet launchers in attempt to provide the Royal Navy, reduced by then to one strike carrier, HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, with some surface fighting capability beyond the range of 4.5/6 inch guns. A much more expensive update, costing £63 million, fitted &quot;Glamorgan&quot; in 1977–1980 with a computerised C3 ADWAS system well in advance of its original fitting, but limited by the essential manual nature of the 4.5&quot; turret and the ageing Seacat and Seaslug missiles.

In the spring and early summer of 1982 &quot;Glamorgan&quot; was involved in the Falklands War during which she engaged Argentine land forces and protected shipping. In the last days of the war, Argentine navy technicians fired a land-based MM-38 Exocet missile which struck the ship causing damage and killing 14 of her crew. She was refitted in late 1982 and her last active deployment for the Royal Navy was to the coast of Lebanon in 1984.

In 1986 &quot;Glamorgan&quot; was sold to the Chilean Navy, and renamed &quot;Almirante Latorre&quot;. The destroyer served for 12 years until late 1998. On 11 April 2005, she sank while under tow to be broken up.

==Construction and design==
Two County-class guided-missile destroyers, &quot;Glamorgan&quot; and were ordered as part of the Royal Navy&#x27;s 1961–62 shipbuilding programme, as a follow-on to the existing four County-class destroyers ordered under the 1955–56 and 1956–57 programmes. They differed from the previous ships in being fitted with the revised Seaslug GWS2 missile system, which was expected to be much more effective than the earlier GWS1 system, and the use of the ADAWS combat data system to aid control of the ship&#x27;s weapons.

&quot;Glamorgan&quot; was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal and deep load. The ship was propelled by a combination of steam turbines and gas turbines in a Combined steam and gas (COSAG) arrangement, driving two propeller shafts. Each shaft could by driven by a single steam turbine (fed with steam at and ) from Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers) and two Metrovick G6 gas turbines (each rated at ), with the gas turbines being used for high speeds and to allow a quick departure from ports without waiting for steam to be raised. Maximum speed was and the ship had a range of at .

A twin launcher for the Seaslug anti-aircraft missile was fitted aft. The Seaslug GWS2 was a beam riding missile which had an effective range of about with a maximum altitude of . Up to 39 Seaslugs could be carried horizontally in a magazine that ran much of the length of the ship. Close-in anti-aircraft protection was provided by a pair of Seacat (missile) launchers and two single Oerlikon 20mm cannons, with two twin QF 4.5 inch Mark V gun mounts were fitted forward. A helicopter deck and hangar allowed a single Westland Wessex helicopter to be operated.

A Type 965 long-range air-search radar and a Type 278 height-finding radar was fitted on the ship&#x27;s mainmast, also fitted on the mainmast was an array of ECM aerials. A Type 992Q Medium range gunnery radar and navigation radar type 978 were fitted to the foremast, also fitted on the foremast was an array of ESM aerials. Type 901 fire control radar for the Seaslug missile was mounted aft. Type 184 sonar was fitted.

&quot;Glamorgan&quot; was laid down at Vickers-Armstrong&#x27;s Newcastle upon Tyne shipyard on 13 September 1962. She was launched on 9 July 1964 and was completed on 13 October 1966.

==Service==
In October 1968, &quot;Glamorgan&quot; took part in Exercise &quot;Coral Sands&quot;, a joint amphibious operations off Queensland, Australia, involving forces from Australia, New Zealand, the United States and the United Kingdom, visiting Australian ports after completion of the exercise.

In March 1976, &quot;Glamorgan&quot; took part in the multi-national exercise Valiant Heritage, a simulated amphibious assault against San Diego. The exercise opened with a live-fire Seaslug exercise in which &quot;Glamorgan&quot; destroyed a target drone aircraft.

===Falklands campaign===
At the start of the Falklands campaign, on 2 April 1982, &quot;Glamorgan&quot; was already at sea off Gibraltar about to take part in exercises; she was immediately diverted to join the main Royal Navy task force, and served as flagship for Rear Admiral Sandy Woodward, Flag Officer First Flotilla and Commander Carrier Battle Group, during the voyage south until 15 April, when he transferred his flag to the aircraft carrier . Her most useful armament proved to be her twin guns, which were intensively used to shell enemy positions onshore.

&quot;Glamorgan&quot; was first in action on the evening and night of 1 May when she joined forces with the frigates and to bombard Argentine positions around Stanley. The three British ships soon came under attack by three IAI Dagger jets; two bombs fell close alongside &quot;Glamorgan&quot;, causing minor underwater damage.

Two weeks later on 14 May, she supported British special forces during the Raid on Pebble Island in the west of the Falklands. For the next two weeks until the end of May she was almost continuously engaged bombarding various shore positions on the east of the islands mainly as part of a plan to distract attention from the landings at San Carlos Water, but also against the airfield at Stanley and in support of British forces ashore. On 29 May she fired a Seaslug missile at the airstrip, which landed close to an Argentine Air Force radar site, killing one Argentine Air Force lieutenant and wounding several airmen.

At the beginning of June, the task force having been reinforced with other ships, &quot;Glamorgan&quot; was detached to protect shipping in the Towing, Repair and Logistics Area (TRALA), some away from the islands, but as the campaign reached a climax she was recalled in the evening of 11 June to support the Royal Marines fighting the Battle of Two Sisters. At 06:37 the following morning, Saturday 12 June 1982, &quot;Glamorgan&quot; was attacked with an MM38 Exocet missile, fired from an improvised shore-based launcher.

The missiles had been removed from the destroyer ARA &quot;Seguí&quot; and secured on the launcher, dubbed &#x27;ITB&#x27; (&quot;Instalación de Tiro Berreta&quot;) by the Argentine Navy personnel which in Argentine slang would translate roughly as &quot;trashy firing platform&quot;. Two MM38 Exocet missiles, their launcher, transporter, and the associated electronics trailer were assembled by the Argentine navy at Puerto Belgrano and flown by a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft to the Falkland Islands. A RASIT radar supplied by the Argentinian Army tracked &quot;Glamorgan&quot;″s movements.

&quot;Glamorgan&quot; was steaming at about some offshore. The first attempt to fire a missile did not result in a launch. At the second attempt, a missile was launched, but it did not find the target. The third attempt resulted in the last remaining missile tracking the target. The incoming Exocet missile was also being tracked on &quot;Glamorgans&quot; bridge and operations room by the Principal Warfare and Navigation Officers.

Before the missile impact, the ship executed a highspeed turn away from the missile, before the Exocet struck the port side adjacent to the hangar near the stern. The turn had prevented the missile from striking the ship&#x27;s side perpendicularly and penetrating; instead, it hit the deck coaming at an angle, skidded on the deck and detonated, making a hole in the hangar deck and a hole in the galley area below, where a fire started.

The blast travelled forwards and down, and the missile body, still travelling forwards, penetrated the hangar door, causing the ship&#x27;s fully fuelled and armed Wessex helicopter (HAS.3 XM837) to explode and start a severe fire in the hangar. Fourteen crew members were killed and dozens more wounded.
Six of those killed were from the ship’s flight of 737 Naval Air Squadron. Thirteen crew members who lost their lives that day were buried at sea that evening, a fourteenth, Able Seaman David McCann died of his wounds on August 19, 1982 The ship was underway again with all fires extinguished by 11:00.

Both the ship and its aircraft pursued no combat operations for the remainder of the conflict. On the following day, repairs were made at sea and, after the Argentinean surrender on 14 June, more extensive repairs were undertaken in the sheltered bay of San Carlos Water. She sailed for home on 21 June, and re-entered Portsmouth on 10 July 1982 after 104 days at sea.

A Memorial was erected in 2011 in memory of the ship and the lost crew at Hookers Point outside Stanley.

===After the Falklands campaign===
HMS &quot;Glamorgan&quot; spent many months in late 1982 being refitted and repaired. Two sets of STWS-1 triple anti-submarine torpedo tubes, capable of launching US Mark 46 torpedoes were fitted, while the ship&#x27;s Seacat launchers were removed, replaced by two Bofors 40 mm guns. The Wessex helicopter was replaced by a Westland Lynx. The ship returned to service in 1983.

Her last active deployment for the Royal Navy was in 1983/4 and she was sent on the Armilla Patrol with HMS &quot;Brazen&quot;. She was originally to sail to the Far East. &quot;En route&quot; she docked at Gibraltar where the ship&#x27;s crew were granted shore leave but, within a few hours and with members of her crew still enjoying a &#x27;run ashore&#x27; she was back at sea. The bases of the US Marines and French forces in Beirut had been bombed by suicide bombers on 23 October and there were fears that British interests were at risk. Absent crew members were finally rounded up and flown aboard by the ship&#x27;s Lynx. As the ship had a greater range than the &quot;Brazen&quot; she set off ahead and raced across the Mediterranean to the coast of Lebanon to evacuate the British peace-keeping troops with her Lynx. With this completed she rejoined the rest of her group and proceeded to the Straits of Hormuz.

===Chilean Navy===

She was decommissioned by the Royal Navy in September 1986, sold to the Chilean Navy on 3 October that year, and renamed &quot;Almirante Latorre&quot;. &quot;Latorre&quot; arrived in Chile in December 1986. The Sea Slug system was retained, although only for use against surface targets. A single MBB Bo 105 helicopter was carried. She was refitted from September 1995 to August 1996, with the ship&#x27;s 40mm Bofors guns replaced by two 16-cell launchers for the Israeli Barak surface-to-air missile and the ADAWS combat data system replaced by the Chilean SISDEF-100 system. The destroyer was decommissioned again in late 1998. On 11 April 2005, she sank in the South Pacific while under tow to be broken up.
