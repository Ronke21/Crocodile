<text>Thiruvalluvar, (Tamil: திருவள்ளுவர்) commonly known as Valluvar, was an Indian poet and philosopher. He is best known as the author of the &quot;Tirukkuṟaḷ&quot;, a collection of couplets on ethics, political and economic matters, and love. The text is considered an exceptional and widely cherished work of Tamil literature.

Almost no authentic information is available about Valluvar, states Kamil Zvelebil – a scholar of Tamil literature. His life and likely background are variously inferred from his literary works by different biographers. There are unauthentic hagiographic and legendary accounts of Valluvar&#x27;s life, and all major Indian religions, as well as Christian missionaries of the 19th century, have tried to claim him as secretly inspired (&quot;crypto-&quot;) or originally belonging to their tradition. Little is known with certainty about his family background, religious affiliation, or birthplace. He is believed to have lived at least in the town of Mylapore (a neighbourhood of the present-day Chennai), and his floruit is dated variously from fourth century BCE to early fifth century CE, based on the traditional accounts and the linguistic analyses of his writings. Kamil Zvelebil infers the &quot; and Valluvar are best dated to around 500 CE.

Valluvar has influenced a wide range of scholars down the ages since his time across the ethical, social, political, economical, religious, philosophical, and spiritual spheres. He has long been venerated as a great sage, and his literary works a classic of Tamil culture.

== Life ==
There is negligible authentic information available about Valluvar&#x27;s life. In fact, neither his actual name nor the original title of his work can be determined with certainty. &quot; itself does not name its author. Monsieur Ariel, a French translator of his work in the 19th century, famously said it is &quot;the book without a name by an author without a name&quot;. The name &quot;Thiruvalluvar&quot; (&quot;lit.&quot; Saint Valluvar) was first mentioned in the later text &quot;Tiruvalluva Maalai&quot;.

The speculations about Valluvar&#x27;s life are largely inferred from his work &quot;&quot; and other Tamil literature that quote him. According to Zvelebil, Valluvar was &quot;probably a learned Jain with eclectic leanings and intimate acquaintance with the early works of Tamil classical period and some knowledge of the Sanskrit legal and didactic texts (&quot;subhashita&quot;)&quot;.

===Traditional biographies===

The Shaivite Tamil text &quot;Tiruvalluva Maalai&quot; contains the earliest known textual reference to the legend of Valluvar, but it remains undated. This text attracted attention in the colonial era because an early 19th-century commentary referred to him as &quot;Valluvan&quot; (Valluvar) whose text presented the &quot;esoteric wisdom of the Vedas to the world&quot;. The original text relates the Kural in the context of Sanskrit literature. The commentary includes the gloss that Valluvan was &quot;born in a low caste&quot;, but the original text does not. According to Stuart Blackburn, this comment appears to be extra-textual and possibly based on the oral tradition. No other pre-colonial textual sources have been found to support any legends about the life of Valluvar. Starting around the early 19th century, numerous legends on Valluvar in Indian languages and English were published.

Various claims have been made regarding Valluvar&#x27;s family background and occupation in the colonial era literature, all inferred from selective sections of his text or hagiographies published since the colonial era started in Tamil Nadu. One traditional version claims that he was a Paraiyar weaver. Another theory is that he must have been from the agricultural caste of Vellalars because he extols agriculture in his work. Another version states he was an outcast, born to a Pariayar woman and Brahmin father. Mu Raghava Iyengar speculated that &quot;valluva&quot; in his name is a variation of &quot;vallabha&quot;, the designation of a royal officer. S. Vaiyapuri Pillai suggested Valluvar derived his name from &quot;Valluvan&quot; (a Paraiyar caste of royal drummers) and theorized that he was &quot;the chief of the proclaiming boys analogous to a trumpet-major of an army&quot;. H. A. Stuart, in his &quot;Census Report of 1891&quot;, claimed that Valluvans were a priestly class among the Paraiyars and served as priests during Pallava reign, and similarly Robert Caldwell, J. H. A. Tremenheere and Edward Jewitt Robinson, too, claimed that Valluvar was a Paraiyar. Valluvar was likely married to a woman named Vasuki and lived in Mylapore. According to traditional accounts, Valluvar died on the day of Anusham in the Tamil month of Vaikasi.

The poem &quot;Kapilar Agaval&quot;, purportedly written by Kapilar, describes its author as a brother of Valluvar. It states that they were children of a Pulaya mother named Adi and a Brahmin father named Bhagwan. The poem claims that the couple had seven children, including three sons (Valluvar, Kapilar, and Atikaman) and four sisters (Avvai, Uppai, Uruvai, and Velli). However, this legendary account is spurious. Kamil Zvelebil dates &quot;Kapilar Agaval&quot; to 15th century CE, based on its language. Various biographies mention the name of Valluvar&#x27;s wife as Vasuki, but such details are of doubtful authenticity.

The traditional biographies are not only inconsistent, but they also contain claims about Valluvar that are not credible. Along with various versions of his birth circumstances, many state he went to a mountain and met the legendary Agastya and other sages. During his return journey, he sits under a tree whose shadow sits still over Valluvar and does not move the entire day, he kills a demon, performs miracles such as causing floods and making them retreat, he touches a grounded ship which miraculously then floats and sails off, his bride Vasuki cooks sand which comes out as boiled rice, and many more. Scholars consider these and all associated aspects of these hagiographic stories to be fiction and ahistorical, a feature common to &quot;international and Indian folklore&quot;. The alleged low birth, high birth, and being a pariah in the traditional accounts are also doubtful.

By 1904, Purnalingam Pillai, an ardent Dravidianist, had analyzed and called these traditional accounts and stories as myths. Pillai&#x27;s analysis and arguments are robust, according to Blackburn. These fictional accounts of Valluvar&#x27;s life have become popular because aspects of the traditional accounts were selectively accepted by Christian missionaries such as George Pope and other European writers, were widely published and then became a required reading about Tamil history.

== Date ==
The exact date of Valluvar is unclear. His work &#x27; has been dated variously from 300 BCE to about the sixth century CE. According to traditional accounts, it was the last work of the third Sangam and was subjected to a divine test (which it passed). The scholars who believe this tradition, such as Somasundara Bharathiar and M. Rajamanickam, date the text to as early as 300 BCE. Historian K. K. Pillay assigned it to the early first-century CE. These early dates such as 300 BCE to 1 BCE are unacceptable and not supported by evidence within the text, states Zvelebil. The diction and grammar of the &#x27;, his indebtedness to some earlier Sanskrit sources, suggest that he lived after the &quot;early Tamil bardic poets&quot;, but before Tamil bhakti poets era.

In 1959, S. Vaiyapuri Pillai assigned the work to around or after the sixth-century CE. His proposal is based on the evidence that the &#x27; contains a large proportion of Sanskrit loan words, shows awareness and indebtedness to some Sanskrit texts best dated to the first half of the first-millennium CE, and the grammatical innovations in the language of &#x27;. Pillai published a list of 137 Sanskrit loan words in &#x27;. Later scholars Thomas Burrow and Murray Barnson Emeneau show that 35 of these are of Dravidian origin, and not Sanskrit loan words. Zvelebil states that an additional few have uncertain etymology and future studies may prove those to be Dravidian. The 102 remaining loan words from Sanskrit are &quot;not negligible&quot;, and some of the teachings in the &#x27; states Zvelebil are &quot;undoubtedly&quot; based on the then extant Sanskrit works such as the &quot;Arthashastra&quot; and &quot;Manusmriti&quot; (also called the &quot;Manavadharmasastra&quot;).

According to Kamil Zvelebil, the &#x27; does not belong to the (Sangam) period. In the 1970s, Zvelebil dated the text to somewhere between 450 and 500 CE. His estimate is based on the dates of Tamil texts with similar Tamil language features, and by placing it after some of the Tamil and Sanskrit treatises that are evidenced in the &#x27;. Zvelebil notes that the text features several grammatical innovations, that are absent in the older Sangam literature. The text also features a higher number of Sanskrit loan words compared with these older texts. According to Zvelebil, besides being part of the ancient Tamil literary tradition, the author was also a part of the &quot;one great Indian ethical, didactic tradition&quot;, as a few of his verses are &quot;undoubtedly&quot; translations of the verses in Sanskrit classics.

In the 19th century and early 20th century, European writers and missionaries variously dated the text and Valluvar to between 400 and 1000 CE. According to Blackburn, the &quot;current scholarly consensus&quot; dates the text and the author to approximately 500 CE.

In January 1935, the Tamil Nadu government officially recognized 31 BCE as the year of Valluvar. As suggested by Maraimalai Adigal, the Valluvar Year was added to the calendar. Thus, the Valluvar year is calculated by adding 31 to any year of the common era.

== Birthplace ==

As with most other details about Valluvar, the exact place of his birth remains uncertain. Valluvar is believed to have lived in Madurai and later in the town of Mayilapuram or Thirumayilai (present-day Mylapore in Chennai). There are also accounts that say he was born in Mayilapuram and later moved to Madurai in order to publish his work at the royal court. The poem &quot;Kapilar Akaval&quot; states that Valluvar was born on the top of an oil-nut or &quot;iluppai&quot; tree (&quot;Madhuca indica&quot;) in Mayilapuram,
while verse 21 of the &quot;Tiruvalluva Maalai&quot; claims that he was born in Madurai.

In 2005, a three-member research team from the Kanyakumari Historical and Cultural Research Centre (KHCRC) claimed that Valluvar was born in Thirunayanarkurichi, a village in present-day Kanyakumari district. Their claim was based on an old Kani tribal leader who told them that Valluvar was a king who ruled the &quot;Valluvanadu&quot; territory in the hilly tracts of the Kanyakumari district.

== Religion ==
Valluvar is generally thought to have belonged to either Jainism or Hinduism. Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism were the three religions that flourished in the Indian subcontinent during the time of Valluvar. Early 19th-century writers proposed that Valluvar may have been a Jain. The 1819 translation by Francis Whyte Ellis mentions that the Tamil community debates whether Valluvar was a Jain or Hindu. If Valluvar was indeed a Jain, it raises questions about the source of the traditional Valluvar legends and the mainstream colonial debate about his birth.

Kamil Zvelebil believes that the ethics of the &quot;&quot; reflects the Jain moral code, particularly moral vegetarianism (couplets 251–260), and ahimsa, that is, &quot;abstention from killing&quot; (couplets 321–333); scholars also note the articulation of Thiruvalluvar in one of the couplets of Tirukkuṟaḷ on the liberation (&quot;Moksha&quot;) from the cycle of rebirth (&quot;Saṃsāra&quot;) through living a life with a compassionate heart. Zvelebil states that the text contains epithets for God that reflect Jain ideology:
* &quot;Malarmicaiyekinan&quot; (Couplet 3), &quot;he who walked upon the [lotus] flower&quot;
* &quot;Aravaliyantanan&quot; (Couplet 8), &quot;the Brahmin [who had] the wheel of dharma&quot;
* &quot;Enkunattan&quot; (Couplet 9), &quot;one of the eight-fold qualities&quot;

These, according to Zvelebil, are &quot;very much Jaina-like&quot; because the arhat is seen as &quot;standing on the lotus&quot;, or where the &quot;arhat&quot; in the Jain conception is the god with the lotus as his vehicle. There are exceptions, adds Zvelebil, when Valluvar treats this God with epithets found in the Hindu text &quot;Manusmriti&quot; (1.6), that is, &quot;the Primeval Lord&quot; and &quot;the King, the Monarch&quot;. Zvelebil states that his proposal is supported by the 13th-century Hindu scholar Parimelalhagar, who wrote a commentary on the Kural text, who admitted that these epithets are &quot;very well applicable&quot; to a Jain Arhat. However, according to P. S. Sundaram – a scholar who has translated the text in the late 20th century, Parimelalhagar&#x27;s commentary explicitly states that there are no [Jaina] heretical beliefs in the texts either.

Some other epithets mentioned in the text also reflect a &quot;strong ascetic flavour&quot; of Jainism in Zvelebil&#x27;s view:

* &quot;Ventutal ventamai ilan&quot; (Couplet 4), &quot;he who has neither desire nor aversion&quot;
* &quot;Porivayil aintavittan&quot; (Couplet 6), &quot;he who has destroyed the gates of the five senses&quot;

Zvelebil further states that Valluvar seems to have been &quot;cognizant of the latest developments&quot; in Jainism. Zvelebil theorizes that he was probably &quot;a learned Jain with eclectic leanings&quot;, who was well-acquainted with the earlier Tamil literature and also had knowledge of the Sanskrit texts. Nevertheless, early Digambara or Svetambara Jaina texts do not mention Valluvar. The first claim of Valluvar as an authority appears in a 16th-century Jain text, about 1,100 years after his life.

According to other scholars, Valluvar&#x27;s writings suggest that he belonged to Hinduism. Hindu teachers have mapped his teachings in &quot;&quot; to the teachings found in Hindu texts. Valluvar&#x27;s treatment of the concept of ahimsa or non-violence, which is the principal concept in both Jainism and Hinduism, bolsters this argument. While the text extols the virtue of non-violence, it also dedicates many of 700 &quot;porul&quot; couplets to various aspects of statecraft and warfare in a manner similar to &quot;Arthasastra&quot;: &quot;An army has a duty to kill in battle, and a king must execute criminals for justice.&quot; This non-mystic realism and the readiness for just war teachings are similar to those found in Hinduism. According to M. S. Purnalingam Pillai, Valluvar has not condemned Saiva Siddhanta or its principles anywhere in the text, which he says is the crucial test to be applied in determining his religion. Matthieu Ricard believes Valluvar belonged to the Shaivite tradition of South India.

The three parts that the Kural literature is divided into, namely, &quot;aram&quot; (virtue), &quot;porul&quot; (wealth) and &quot;inbam&quot; (love), aiming at attaining &quot;vitu&quot; (ultimate salvation), follow, respectively, the first three of the four foundations of Hinduism, namely, dharma, artha, kama and moksha. According to Norman Cutler, the prodigious 13th-century Tamil scholar Parimelalakar – who wrote the most influential commentary on &quot;&quot; – interprets the layout and focus on the Valluvar to be synonymous with the Sanskritic concept of Puruṣārtha (the objectives of human life). According to Parimelalakar, the Valluvar text covers primarily and directly the first three aspects, but not &quot;vitu&quot; (&quot;moksha&quot;, release). The text, however, does cover &quot;turavaram&quot; (renunciation) – the means to attain spiritual release. Thus, &quot;vitu&quot; is indirectly discussed in the Kural text.

In the introductory chapters of the Kural, Valluvar cites Indra, the king of heaven, to exemplify the virtue of conquest over one&#x27;s senses. According to Tamil Hindu scholars such as Parimelalakar, other concepts and teachings found in Valluvar&#x27;s text and also found in Hindu texts include Vedas, gods (&quot;Trimurti&quot;), sattva, guṇa, munis and sadhus (renouncers), rebirth, affirmation of a primordial God, among others. According to Purnalingam Pillai, who is known for his critique of Brahminism, a rational analysis of the Valluvar&#x27;s work suggests that he was a Hindu, and not a Jain. Similarly, J. J. Glazov, a Tamil literature scholar and the translator of the Kural text into the Russian language, sees &quot;Thiruvalluvar as a Hindu by faith&quot;, according to a review by Kamil Zvelebil.

Valluvar&#x27;s mentioning of God Vishnu in couplets 610 and 1103 and Goddess Lakshmi in couplets 167, 408, 519, 565, 568, 616, and 617 hints at the Vaishnavite beliefs of Valluvar. Shaivites have characterised Valluvar as a devotee of Shiva and have installed his images in their temples. According to Zvelebil, Valluvar sometimes uses epithets for God that are found in Hindu &quot;Dharmasastras&quot; and not in Jaina texts. Further, in some teachings about politics, economics, and love, Valluvar undoubtedly has translated into Tamil the verses found in Sanskrit texts such as &quot;Arthasastra&quot;.

According to Stuart Blackburn, the &#x27; is not a bhakti text, and it neither satirizes nor eulogizes Brahmins or ritualism. It is a practical, pragmatic text and &quot;certainly not a Shaivite or Vaishnavite&quot; text. According to Norman Cutler, &#x27; is an aphoristic text and the influential Parimelalakar&#x27;s commentary interprets it within his own context, grounded in Hindu concepts and theological agenda. His elegantly written interpretations have made his commentary a Tamil classic and maneuvered Valluvar as consistent within the framework of Parimelalakar&#x27;s Hinduism. His commentary on Valluvar&#x27;s teachings reflects both the cultural values and textual values in the 13th-to-14th-century Tamil Nadu. Valluvar&#x27;s text can be interpreted and maneuvered in other ways.

===Other religious claims===
Despite scholars suggesting that Valluvar is either a Jain or a Hindu, owing to the Kural text&#x27;s non-denominational nature, almost every religious group in India, including Christianity, has claimed the work and its author as one of their own. However, these claims are not supported academically and are constantly refuted by scholars. For example, the Christian claims have cropped up only after the colonial missionaries came to India. The Tamil Scholar Mu. Varadarajan suggests Valluvar must have &quot;practised religious eclecticism, maintained unshakeable faith in dharma but should have rejected religious symbols and superstitious beliefs.&quot;

;Buddhism
The Dalit activist Iyothee Thass, who converted to Buddhism, claimed that Valluvar was originally called &quot;Tiruvalla Nayanar&quot;, and was a Buddhist. Thass further contended that the name &quot;Tirukkuṟaḷ&quot; is a reference to the Buddhist &quot;Tripiṭaka&quot;. He claims that Valluvar&#x27;s book was originally called &quot;Tirikural&quot; (&quot;Three Kurals&quot;), because it adhered to the three Buddhist scriptures &quot;Dhamma Pitaka&quot;, &quot;Sutta Pitaka&quot;, and &quot;Vinaya Pitaka&quot;. According to Thass, the legend that presents Valluvar as the son of a Brahmin father and a Paraiyar mother was invented by Brahmins in 1825, who wanted to Hinduise a Buddhist text. According to Geetha, the deconstruction and reinterpretation of the history of Valluvar into a Buddhist framework by Thass shows the significance and appropriation of Valluvar&#x27;s text by all sections of Tamil society.

;Christianity
The 19th-century Christian missionary George Uglow Pope claimed that Valluvar must have come in contact with Christian teachers such as Pantaenus of Alexandria, imbibed Christian ideas and peculiarities of Alexandrian teachers and then wrote the &quot;wonderful Kurral&quot; with an echo of the &quot;Sermon on the Mount&quot;. According to Pope, Valluvar must have lived in the ninth century CE because that would fit the historical chronology to his theory. Nevertheless, scholars, including Zvelebil, J. M. Nallaswamy Pillai, Sundaram Pillai, Kanakasabai Pillai, and Krishnaswamy Aiyengar, and even missionaries such as John Lazarus refute such claims. Pillai declares Pope&#x27;s claim as &quot;an absurd literary anachronism&quot; and says that the first two books of the Kural, in particular, are &quot;a stumbling block which can browbeat the most sublime ideas of Christian morality.&quot; According to John Lazarus, the Kural&#x27;s chapter on &quot;no killing&quot; applies to both humans and animals, in stark contrast to the Bible&#x27;s concept of killing, which refers only to the taking away of human life. He observes, &quot;None of the ten epithets by which the Deity is described in the opening chapter of the Kural have the remotest connection with Christ or God, that is to say, as they are designated in the Bible&quot;. He also says that the chapter on love &quot;is quite different from the Apostle&#x27;s eulogium in 1 Cor. xiii&quot;.

In the 1960s, some South Indian Christians led by M. Deivanayagam at the Madras Christian College, presented Valluvar as a disciple of Thomas the Apostle. According to this theory, Thomas visited present-day Chennai, where Valluvar listened to his lectures on the Sermon on the Mount. However, later scholars refute this claim. According to Zvelebil, the ethics and ideas in Valluvar&#x27;s work are not Christian ethics, but those found in Jainism doctrine, which can be seen from the Kural&#x27;s unwavering emphasis on the ethics of moral vegetarianism (Chapter 26) and non-killing (Chapter 33), as against any of the Abrahamic religious texts.

== Literary works ==
&quot;&quot; is the primary work credited to Valluvar. It contains 1330 couplets, which are divided into 133 sections of 10 couplets each. The first 38 sections are on moral and cosmic order (&quot;Tamil: aram&quot;, Skt: dharma), the next 70 are about political and economic matters (&quot;Tamil: porul&quot;, Skt: artha), and the remaining 25 are about pleasure (&quot;Tamil: inbam&quot;, Skt: kama).

Of the three sections, Valluvar&#x27;s second section (&quot;porul&quot;) is about twice the size of first section, and three times that of the third. In the 700 couplets on &quot;porul&quot; (53% of the text), Valluvar mostly discusses statecraft and warfare. Valluvar&#x27;s work is a classic on realism and pragmatism, and it is not a mystic, purely philosophical document. Valluvar teachings are similar to those found in &quot;Arthasastra&quot;, but differ in some important aspects. In Valluvar&#x27;s theory of state, unlike Kautilya, the army (&quot;patai&quot;) is most important element. Valluvar recommends that a well kept and well trained army (&quot;patai&quot;) led by an able commander and ready to go to war is necessary for a state. Valluvar presents his theory of state using six elements: army (&quot;patai&quot;), subjects (&quot;kuti&quot;), treasure (&quot;kul&quot;), ministers (&quot;amaiccu&quot;), allies (&quot;natpu&quot;), and forts (&quot;aran&quot;). Valluvar also recommends forts and other infrastructure, supplies and food storage in preparation for siege.

The &#x27; text has been translated into several Indian and international languages. It was translated into Latin by Constanzo Beschi in 1730, which helped make the work known to European intellectuals. &#x27; is one of the most revered works in the Tamil language.

&quot;&quot; is generally recognized as the only work by Valluvar. However, in the Tamil literary tradition, Valluvar is attributed to be the author of many other later-dated texts including two Tamil texts on medicine, &quot;Gnana Vettiyan&quot; (1500 verses) and &quot;Pancharathnam&quot; (500 verses). Many scholars state that these are much later era texts (16th and 17th centuries), possibly by an author with the same name as Valluvar. These books, &#x27;Pancharathnam&#x27; and &#x27;Gnana Vettiyan&#x27;, contribute to Tamil science, literature and other Siddha medicines. In addition to these, 15 other Tamil texts have been attributed to Valluvar, namely, &quot;Rathna Sigamani&quot; (800 verses), &quot;Karpam&quot; (300 verses), &quot;Nadhaantha Thiravukol&quot; (100 verses), &quot;Naadhaantha Saaram&quot; (100 verses), &quot;Vaithiya Suthram&quot; (100 verses), &quot;Karpaguru Nool&quot; (50 verses), &quot;Muppu Saathiram&quot; (30 verses), &quot;Vaadha Saathiram&quot; (16 verses), &quot;Muppu Guru&quot; (11 verses), &quot;Kavuna Mani&quot; (100 verses), &quot;Aeni Yettram&quot; (100 verses), &quot;Guru Nool&quot; (51 verses), &quot;Sirppa Chinthamani&quot; (a text on astrology), &quot;Tiruvalluvar Gyanam&quot;, and &quot;Tiruvalluvar Kanda Tirunadanam&quot;. Several scholars, such as Devaneya Pavanar, deny that Thiruvalluvar was the author of these texts.

==Reception==

George Uglow Pope called Valluvar &quot;the greatest poet of South India&quot;, but according to Zvelebil, he does not seem to have been a poet. According to Zvelebil, while the author handles the metre very skillfully, the &quot;&quot; does not feature &quot;true and great poetry&quot; throughout the work, except, notably, in the third book, which deals with love and pleasure. This suggests that Valluvar&#x27;s main aim was not to produce a work of art, but rather an instructive text focused on wisdom, justice, and ethics.

Valluvar is revered and highly esteemed in the Tamil culture, and this is reflected in the fact that his work has been called by nine different names: &quot;&quot; (the sacred kural), &quot;Uttaravedam&quot; (the ultimate Veda), &quot;Thiruvalluvar&quot; (eponymous with the author), &quot;Poyyamoli&quot; (the falseless word), &quot;Vayurai valttu&quot; (truthful praise), &quot;Teyvanul&quot; (the divine book), &quot;Potumarai&quot; (the common Veda), &quot;Muppal&quot; (the three-fold path), and &quot;Tamilmarai&quot; (the Tamil Veda).

Its influence and historic use is legendary. In 1708, the German missionary, Bartholomaus Ziegenbalg, remarked that the Malabaris &quot;think very highly of it&quot;, they make it &quot;their handbook&quot; often quoting from it to prove the validity of their traditions and arguments, and such books are &quot;not just read but learned by heart&quot; by the learned among them. According to Blackburn, it is hard to outdo the &quot;hyperbolic honors&quot; heaped on Valluvar and his work by the early Europeans in colonial India. Gover, for example, praised it as &quot;Tamil Homer, The Ten Commandments, and Dante rolled into one&quot;. During the colonial era, it was the text the Hindus used to respond to the &quot;Christian allegations of Hindu superstition and barbarity&quot;.

===Temples===

Valluvar is traditionally worshiped as a god and saint by various communities across the Southern region of India. Many communities, including those in Mylapore and Tiruchuli, worship Valluvar as the 64th Nayanmar of the Saivite tradition. There are various temples exclusively dedicated to Valluvar across South India. The most famous of these is the temple at Mylapore, Chennai. Built in the early 16th century, the shrine is located within the Ekambareeswara-Kamakshi (Shiva-Parvati) temple complex in Mylapore. The locals believe that this is where Valluvar was born, underneath a tree within the shrines complex. A Valluvar statue in a seated posture holding a palm leaf manuscript of &quot;&quot; sits under the tree. In the shrine dedicated to him, Valluvar&#x27;s wife Vasuki is patterned after the Hindu deity Kamakshi inside the sanctum. The temple shikhara (spire) above the sanctum shows scenes of Hindu life and deities, along with Valluvar reading his couplets to his wife. The &quot;sthala vriksham&quot; (holy tree of the temple) is the &quot;iluppai&quot; tree under which Valluvar is believed to have been born. The temple was extensively renovated in the 1970s.

At the Valluvar temple at Tiruchuli near Aruppukkottai in Virudhunagar district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, Valluvar is taken in a procession as the 64th Nayanmar on his death anniversary in the Tamil month of &quot;Maasi&quot; (February–March) by the Valluvar community, who are into fortune-telling, chiefly in the Periya Pudupatti village. The same practice can be found in other communities as well, including Mylapore.

Other temples for Valluvar are located at Periya Kalayamputhur, Thondi, Kanjoor Thattanpady, Senapathy, and Vilvarani.

=== Memorials ===
A temple-like memorial to Valluvar, Valluvar Kottam, was built in Chennai in 1976. This monument complex consists of structures usually found in Dravidian temples, including a temple car carved from three blocks of granite, and a shallow, rectangular pond. The auditorium adjoining the memorial is one of the largest in Asia and can seat up to 4,000 people.

A 133-foot-tall statue of Valluvar was unveiled on 1 January 2000, at Kanyakumari at the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent, where the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the Indian Ocean converge. The 133 feet denote &quot;&quot;&#x27;s 133 chapters or &quot;athikarams&quot; and the show of three fingers denote the three themes &quot;Aram&quot;, &quot;Porul&quot;, and &quot;Inbam&quot;, that is, the sections on morals, wealth and love. The statue was designed by V. Ganapati Sthapati, a temple architect from Tamil Nadu. On 9 August 2009, a statue was unveiled in Ulsoor, near Bengaluru, also making it the first of its kind in India for a poet of a local language to be installed in its near states other than his own homeland. A 12-foot statue of Valluvar was also installed in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. There is also a statue of Valluvar outside the School of Oriental and African Studies in Russell Square, London. A life-size statue of Valluvar is one among an array of statues installed by the Tamil Nadu government on the stretch of the Marina.

The Government of Tamil Nadu celebrates the 15th (16th on leap years) of January (the second of the month of &#x27;Thai&#x27; as per Tamil Calendar) as &quot;Thiruvalluvar Day&quot; in the poet&#x27;s honour, as part of the Pongal celebrations. Thiruvalluvar Day was first celebrated on 17 and 18 May 1935.

===Music===
Valluvar&#x27;s works have also influenced the South Indian classical music and popular culture. Carnatic musicians and composers such as Mayuram Vishwanatha Shastri and M. M. Dandapani Desigar have tuned select couplets in the 19th and 20th centuries. In January 2016, Chitravina N. Ravikiran set music to the entire 1330 verses using over 169 Indian ragas. The Kural couplets have also been recorded by various Tamil film music composers.

==Notes==

a. The period of Valluvar is dated variously by scholars from c. fourth century BCE to c. fifth century CE, based on various methods of analysis, including traditional accounts and linguistics analyses. The officially accepted date, however, is 31 BCE, as ratified by the government in 1921, and the Valluvar Year is being followed ever since. For more in-depth analysis, see Dating the Tirukkural.

b. &quot;Valluvanadu&quot; was a Taluk in erstwhile Madras Presidency as part of Malabar District. Currently, that area is part of Palakkad and Malappuram districts of Kerala adjoining the Nilgiri District of Tamil Nadu. The Valluvanadu kings claim that they descended from Pallava Kings and were ruling earlier from the Nilgiri area.

<text>In algebraic geometry, a hyperelliptic curve is an algebraic curve of genus &quot;g&quot; &gt; 1, given by an equation of the form
formula_1
where &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a polynomial of degree &quot;n&quot; = 2&quot;g&quot; + 1 &gt; 4 or &quot;n&quot; = 2&quot;g&quot; + 2 &gt; 4 with &quot;n&quot; distinct roots, and &quot;h&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a polynomial of degree &lt; &quot;g&quot; + 2 (if the characteristic of the ground field is not 2, one can take &quot;h&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0).

A hyperelliptic function is an element of the function field of such a curve, or of the Jacobian variety on the curve; these two concepts are identical for elliptic functions, but different for hyperelliptic functions.

==Genus==

The degree of the polynomial determines the genus of the curve: a polynomial of degree 2&quot;g&quot; + 1 or 2&quot;g&quot; + 2 gives a curve of genus &quot;g&quot;. When the degree is equal to 2&quot;g&quot; + 1, the curve is called an imaginary hyperelliptic curve. Meanwhile, a curve of degree 2&quot;g&quot; + 2 is termed a real hyperelliptic curve. This statement about genus remains true for &quot;g&quot; = 0 or 1, but those special cases are not called &quot;hyperelliptic&quot;. In the case &quot;g&quot; = 1 (if one chooses a distinguished point), such a curve is called an elliptic curve.

==Formulation and choice of model==

While this model is the simplest way to describe hyperelliptic curves, such an equation will have a singular point &quot;at infinity&quot; in the projective plane. This feature is specific to the case &quot;n&quot; &gt; 3. Therefore, in giving such an equation to specify a non-singular curve, it is almost always assumed that a non-singular model (also called a smooth completion), equivalent in the sense of birational geometry, is meant.

To be more precise, the equation defines a quadratic extension of C(&quot;x&quot;), and it is that function field that is meant. The singular point at infinity can be removed (since this is a curve) by the normalization (integral closure) process. It turns out that after doing this, there is an open cover of the curve by two affine charts: the one already given by
formula_2
and another one given by
formula_3

The glueing maps between the two charts are given by
formula_4
and
formula_5
wherever they are defined.

In fact geometric shorthand is assumed, with the curve &quot;C&quot; being defined as a ramified double cover of the projective line, the ramification occurring at the roots of &quot;f&quot;, and also for odd &quot;n&quot; at the point at infinity. In this way the cases &quot;n&quot; = 2&quot;g&quot; + 1 and 2&quot;g&quot; + 2 can be unified, since we might as well use an automorphism of the projective plane to move any ramification point away from infinity.

== Using Riemann–Hurwitz formula ==

Using the Riemann–Hurwitz formula, the hyperelliptic curve with genus &quot;g&quot; is defined by an equation with degree &quot;n&quot; = 2&quot;g&quot; + 2. Suppose &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → P1 is a branched covering with ramification degree &quot;2&quot;, where &quot;X&quot; is a curve with genus &quot;g&quot; and P1 is the Riemann sphere. Let &quot;g&quot;1 = &quot;g&quot; and &quot;g&quot;0 be the genus of P1 ( = 0 ), then the Riemann-Hurwitz formula turns out to be
:formula_6
where &quot;s&quot; is over all ramified points on &quot;X&quot;. The number of ramified points is &quot;n&quot;, and at each ramified point &quot;s&quot; we have &quot;es&quot; = 2, so the formula becomes
:formula_7
so &quot;n&quot; = 2&quot;g&quot; + 2.

==Occurrence and applications==

All curves of genus 2 are hyperelliptic, but for genus ≥ 3 the generic curve is not hyperelliptic. This is seen heuristically by a moduli space dimension check. Counting constants, with &quot;n&quot; = 2&quot;g&quot; + 2, the collection of &quot;n&quot; points subject to the action of the automorphisms of the projective line has (2&quot;g&quot; + 2) − 3 degrees of freedom, which is less than 3&quot;g&quot; − 3, the number of moduli of a curve of genus &quot;g&quot;, unless &quot;g&quot; is 2. Much more is known about the &quot;hyperelliptic locus&quot; in the moduli space of curves or abelian varieties, though it is harder to exhibit &quot;general&quot; non-hyperelliptic curves with simple models. One geometric characterization of hyperelliptic curves is via Weierstrass points. More detailed geometry of non-hyperelliptic curves is read from the theory of canonical curves, the canonical mapping being 2-to-1 on hyperelliptic curves but 1-to-1 otherwise for &quot;g&quot; &gt; 2. Trigonal curves are those that correspond to taking a cube root, rather than a square root, of a polynomial.

The definition by quadratic extensions of the rational function field works for fields in general except in characteristic 2; in all cases the geometric definition as a ramified double cover of the projective line is available, if the extension is assumed to be separable.

Hyperelliptic curves can be used in hyperelliptic curve cryptography for cryptosystems based on the discrete logarithm problem.

Hyperelliptic curves also appear composing entire connected components of certain strata of the moduli space of Abelian differentials.

Hyperellipticity of genus-2 curves was used to prove Gromov&#x27;s filling area conjecture in the case of fillings of genus =1.

===Classification===

Hyperelliptic curves of given genus &quot;g&quot; have a moduli space, closely related to the ring of invariants of a binary form of degree 2&quot;g&quot;+2.

==History==

Hyperelliptic functions were first published by Adolph Göpel (1812-1847) in his last paper &quot;Abelsche Transcendenten erster Ordnung&quot; (Abelian transcendents of first order) (in Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik, vol. 35, 1847). Independently Johann G. Rosenhain worked on that matter and published &quot;Umkehrungen ultraelliptischer Integrale erster Gattung&quot; (in Mémoires des savants etc., vol. 11, 1851).

<doc id="499364" wikidata="Q1666962" url="?curid=499364" title="International Swaps and Derivatives Association">
<text>The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA ) is a trade organization of participants in the market for over-the-counter derivatives.

It is headquartered in New York City, and has created a standardized contract (the ISDA Master Agreement) to enter into derivatives transactions. In addition to legal and policy activities, ISDA manages FpML (Financial products Markup Language), an XML message standard for the OTC Derivatives industry. ISDA has more than 925 members in 75 countries; its membership consists of derivatives dealers, service providers and end users.

== History ==

ISDA was initially created in 1985 as the International Swap Dealers Associations, Inc. and subsequently changed its name switching &quot;Swap Dealers&quot; to &quot;Swaps and Derivatives&quot;. This change was made to focus more attention on their efforts to improve the more broad derivatives markets and away from strictly interest rate swap contracts.

In 2009 a New York Times article mentioned that in 2005 the ISDA allowed rule changes to CDO payouts (Pay as You Go) that would benefit those who bet against (shorted) mortgage-backed securities, like Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, and others.

ISDA has offices in New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Washington D.C., Brussels and Singapore. It has more than 800 member firms from six continents. The current Chief Executive Officer is Scott O&#x27;Malia, who joined ISDA in 2009.

== ISDA Master Agreement ==
The ISDA Master Agreement is typically used between a derivatives dealer and its counterparty when discussions begin surrounding a derivatives trade. There are two basic forms of Master Agreement: single jurisdiction/currency and multiple jurisdiction/currency. One of these documents is generally combined with a Schedule to set out the basic trading terms between the parties; each subsequent trade is then recorded in a Confirmation which references the Master Agreement and Schedule. The terms of the Schedule are often negotiated, and many firms have preferred versions of the Schedule.

According to &quot;Financial Times&quot; reporter Stacy-Marie Ishmael, the Master Agreement is &quot;fundamental to, and provides a template for, the derivatives market.&quot;

ISDA has also drafted a Tahawwut Master Agreement in cooperation with the International Islamic Financial Market, with the aim of standardizing derivatives transactions under Islamic law.

=== Versions ===

The ISDA Master Agreement was first published in 1992, and a second edition was published in 2002. The second edition was drafted in response to market difficulties in the late 1990s, and could be adopted either in a unified form or as standard form amendments to the first edition. Key changes in the second edition include:
* Shortening the grace period for payment defaults from three business days to one business day [Refer Section 5 (a)(i) of 2002 version]
* Introduction of a force majeure provision as a termination event
* Introduction of a set-off provision [Included in the 2002 version in Section 6(f)]
* Conformation of jurisdiction clause to the Brussels Regime
* Introduction of Close-out Amount

On April 8, 2009, ISDA introduced further compulsory modifications known as the &quot;Big Bang Protocol.&quot; The key changes introduced by this protocol include:
* Introduction of &quot;auction settlement&quot; to eliminate the need for credit event protocols to settle CDS transactions
* Automatic incorporation of Determinations Committee resolutions into the terms of standard CDS contracts
* &quot;Look back&quot; provisions, also known as &quot;backstop dates,&quot; which institute a common standard effective date for CDS transactions

The Protocol also introduced more standardized terms in order to limit the scope of negotiation in individual CDS transactions, thus making individual contracts more fungible in trading.

ISDA&#x27;s report commissioned by the &quot;UK Financial Services Authority on behalf of the international group of OTC derivative supervisors asked ISDA in October 2009 to conduct a broad market review of bilateral collateralization practices for OTC derivatives to facilitate better understanding of current market practice, especially as it relates to the different types of counterparties active in the market.&quot;

=== Netting ===

Possibly the most important aspect of the ISDA Master Agreement is that the Master Agreement and all the Confirmations entered into under it form a single agreement. This is very important (especially for regulated financial companies) as it allows the parties to an ISDA Master Agreement to aggregate the amounts owing by each of them under all of the Transactions outstanding under that ISDA Master Agreement and replace them with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. Netting, dealt with under section 2(c) of the ISDA Master Agreement, allows the parties to net out amounts payable on the same day and in the same currency.

The more important use of netting is close-out netting under Section 6(e) of the ISDA Master Agreement. Pursuant to this section, when an ISDA Master Agreement (or, more accurately the outstanding Transactions under it) is terminated (normally following a credit event of some kind), the value of each of the Terminated Transactions is assessed (there are several ways this can be done, but the most usual measure is to determine how much it would cost for a party to enter into a Transaction having commercial terms identical to the Terminated Transaction with an independent third party - this is called the Settlement Amount) and converted into the Termination Currency (which should have been specified in the schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement) and any outstanding Unpaid Amounts are taken into account. The Settlement Amounts (which may be positive or negative depending which party is &#x27;in-the-money&#x27; with respect to a particular Terminated Transaction) and unpaid amounts (again positive or negative, depending on who owes them) are added up and a single figure in the Termination Currency is determined payable by one party or the other. The enforceability of the close-out netting provisions is absolutely vital to financial institutions active in the derivatives market since the ability to net allows them to allocate capital only against the net figure they would have to pay on close-out of an ISDA Master Agreement rather than the gross amount. ISDA has obtained legal opinions from all important jurisdictions confirming the effectiveness of the close-out netting provisions in those jurisdictions. Members of ISDA are entitled to rely on these opinions.

ISDA also produces a model &quot;Netting Act&quot; which can be adopted by jurisdictions where close-out netting does not work effectively at present.

=== Credit support annex (CSA) ===

ISDA also produces a credit support annex which further permits parties to an ISDA Master Agreement to mitigate their credit risk by requiring the party which is &#x27;out-of-the-money&#x27; to post collateral (usually cash, government securities or highly rated bonds) corresponding to the amount which would be payable by that party were all the outstanding Transactions under the relevant ISDA Master Agreement terminated. Collateral other than cash is usually discounted for risk, that is, the pledgor would have to post collateral in excess of the potential settlement amount.

== ISDAFIX ==
From 1998 until August 2014, ISDA was responsible for releasing a series of interest rate swap reference rates for four currencies (Euros, British pounds, Swiss francs, U.S. dollars) under the name ISDAfix. Following rate manipulation scandals, these rates are now administered by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Further, the Swiss francs rate is no longer reported.

== Credit events and determinations committees ==

ISDA has five Determinations Committees, each having jurisdiction over a specific region of the world (the Americas, Asia excluding Japan, Australia/New Zealand, EMEA and Japan). Each committee consists of ten voting dealers and five voting non-dealer asset managers. The committees make official, binding determinations regarding the existence of &quot;credit events&quot; and &quot;succession events&quot; (such as mergers), which may trigger obligations under a credit default swap contract.

Since July 2009, the primary means of resolving a credit event is auction settlement, where holders of applicable instruments (as decided by the relevant determinations committee) auction their instruments to potential buyers at a set price.

In March 2012, ISDA issued a statement declaring that Greece, through passing legislation that forces losses on all its private creditors, has triggered the payment on default insurance contracts, thus instigating a credit event. The ISDA said the use of &quot;collective action clauses (CACs) to amend the terms of Greek law-governed bonds issued by The Hellenic Republic such [as] the right of all holders of the Affected Bonds to receive payments has been reduced.&quot;

== Definitions ==

ISDA also creates industry standards for derivatives and provides legal definitions of terms used in contracts. An example is the 1999 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions, which provide basic definitions for credit default swaps, total return swaps, credit linked notes and other credit derivative transactions.

A controversy resulted over the definition of a &quot;restructuring event&quot; in connection with the August 2000 restructuring of USD 2.8 billion of debt by an insurance company. This prompted complaints from protection sellers in credit default swaps, who had to compensate for an event that was seen as normal in the credit business. There was also a fear of a &quot;conflict of interest&quot;, since protection buyers had nothing to lose by agreeing to restructuring. (Protection buyers included some of the insurance company&#x27;s lenders.)

<text>Boat building is the design and construction of boats (instead of the larger ships) — and their on-board systems. This includes at minimum the construction of a hull, with any necessary propulsion, mechanical, navigation, safety and other service systems as the craft requires.

The boat building industry provides for the design, manufacturing, repair and modification of human-powered watercrafts, sailboats, motorboats, airboats and submersibles, and caters for various demands from recreational (e.g. launches, dinghies and yachts), commercial (e.g. tour boats, ferry boats and lighters), residential (houseboats), to professional (e.g. fishing boats, tugboats, lifeboats and patrol boats) .

==Construction materials and methods==



===Wood===
Wood is the traditional boat building material used for hull and spar construction. It is buoyant, widely available and easily worked. It is a popular material for small boats (of e.g. length; such as dinghies and sailboats). Its abrasion resistance varies according to the hardness and density of the wood and it can deteriorate if fresh water or marine organisms are allowed to penetrate the wood. Woods such as teak, totara and some cedars have natural chemicals which prevent rot whereas other woods, such as &quot;Pinus radiata&quot;, will rot very quickly. The hull of a wooden boat usually consists of planking fastened to frames and a keel. Keel and frames are traditionally made of hardwoods such as oak while planking can be oak but is more often softwood such as pine, larch or cedar. 

Traditional wood construction techniques can be classified into the &quot;shell-first&quot; method (also called &quot;planking first&quot;) and the &quot;frame first&quot; method. With &quot;shell first&quot;, the form of the hull is determined by joining shaped planks that are fastened together, followed by reinforcing the structure with the frames (or ribs) that are fitted to the inside. With &quot;frame first&quot;, the hull shape is established by setting up the frames on the keel and then fastening the planking on the outside.

Some types of wood construction include:

*Carvel, in which a smooth hull is formed by fastening flush-fitting planks to underlying s. The planks may be curved in cross section like barrel staves. Carvel planks are generally caulked with oakum or cotton that is driven into the seams between the planks and covered with some waterproof substance. It takes its name from the caravel and is believed to have originated in the Mediterranean. A number of boat building texts are available which describe the carvel planking method in detail.
*Clinker is a planking-first technique originally identified with the Scandinavians and Ingveonic people in which wooden planks are fixed to each other with a slight overlap that is beveled for a tight fit. The planks are mechanically connected to each other with copper rivets, bent over iron nails, screws or in modern boats with adhesives. Often, steam bent wooden ribs are fitted inside the hull.
*Strip planking is yet another type of wooden boat construction similar to carvel. It is a glued construction method which is very popular with amateur boatbuilders as it is quick, avoids complex temporary jig work and does not require shaping of the planks.
*Sheet plywood boat building uses sheets of plywood panels usually fixed to longitudinal long wood such the chines, inwhales (sheer clamps) or intermediate stringers which are all bent around a series of frames. By attaching the ply sheets to the longwood rather than directly to the frames this avoids hard spots or an unfair hull. Plywood may be laminated into a round hull or used in single sheets. These hulls generally have one or more chines and the method is called Ply on Frame construction. A subdivision of the sheet plywood boat building method is known as the stitch-and-glue method, where pre-shaped panels of plywood are drawn together then edge glued and reinforced with fibreglass without the use of a frame. Metal or plastic ties, nylon fishing line or copper wires pull curved flat panels into three-dimensional curved shapes. These hulls generally have one or more chines. Marine grade plywood of good quality is designated &quot;WBP&quot; (which stands for water- and boiled-proof) or more usually BS 1088. Australian plywood manufacturers and suppliers have issued warnings that some Asian nations are selling ply stamped BS 1088 which does not meet international standards. Specifically, they say outer plies are too thin (should be minimum) or are very thin (less than ) or high-grade surface ply such as Okoume is combined with a much heavier and wider inner cores. Most high-grade marine Okoume (Gaboon) ply uses lightweight poplar inner cores. Often the 1088 stamp is blurred in the poor Asian ply so it is not clear. In Australia and New Zealand a higher-grade marine ply than BS1088 is AS2272. It requires both faces to be &quot;A&quot; quality, with even-thickness plies. The most common plywood used for this grade is plantation-grown Hoop Pine which is fine grained, very smooth, moderately light (at it is the same weight as Meranti ply and about 13% heavier than genuine poplar cored BS1088 Okoume). Hoop pine has a very high stress rating of F17, indicating high strength. Meranti (Lauan) ply has a stress rating of F14 and Okoume ply F8. Okoume ply is commonly coated with epoxy to increase strength and impact resistance as well as to exclude water. Both types of plywood construction are very popular with amateur builders, and many dinghies such as the Vaurien, Cherub, Tolman, Moth and P class (ply on frame construction) and FJs, FDs and Kolibris (stitch-and-glue method) have been built from it. Another variation is tortured ply where very thin() and flexible (often Okoume)preshaped panels ply are bent into compound curves and sewn together. Little or no framework or longitudinal wood is used. This method is mainly confined to kayaks.
* Cold moulding is a composite method of wooden boat building that uses two or more layers of thin wood, called veneers, oriented in different directions, resulting in a strong monocoque structure, similar to a fibreglass hull but substantially lighter. Sometimes composed of a base layer of strip planking followed by multiple veneers. Sometimes just veneers are used. Cold-moulding is popular in small, medium and very large, wooden super-yachts. Using different types of wood, the builder can lighten some areas such as bow and stern and strengthen other high-stress areas. Sometimes cold-moulded hulls are protected either inside or out or both with fibreglass or similar products for impact resistance, especially when lightweight, soft timber such as cedar is used. This method lends itself to great flexibility in hull shape.&lt;br&gt;Cold-moulded refers to a type of building one-off hulls using thin strips of wood applied to a series of forms at 45-degree angles to the centerline. This method is often called double-diagonal because a minimum of two layers is recommended, each occurring at opposing 45-degree angles. The &quot;hot-moulded&quot; method of building boats, which used ovens to heat and cure the resin, has not been widely used since World War II; and now almost all curing is done at room temperature.

===Metal===
====Iron and steel====
Either used in sheet or alternatively, plate for all-metal hulls or for isolated structural members. It is strong, but heavy (despite the fact that the thickness of the hull can be less). It is generally about 30% heavier than aluminium and somewhat more heavy than polyester. The material rusts unless protected from water (this is usually done by means of a covering of paint). Modern steel components are welded or bolted together. As the welding can be done very easily (with common welding equipment), and as the material is very cheap, it is a popular material with amateur builders. Also, amateur builders which are not yet well established in building steel ships may opt for DIY construction kits. If steel is used, a zinc layer is often applied to coat the entire hull. It is applied after sandblasting (which is required to have a cleaned surface) and before painting. The painting is usually done with lead paint (Pb3O4). Optionally, the covering with the zinc layer may be left out, but it is generally not recommended. Zinc anodes also need to be placed on the ship&#x27;s hull. Until the mid-1900s, steel sheets were riveted together.


====Aluminum====
Aluminum and aluminum alloys are used both in sheet form for all-metal hulls or for isolated structural members. Many sailing spars are frequently made of aluminium after 1960. It is the lightest material for building large boats (being 15–20% lighter than polyester and 30% lighter than steel). Aluminium is relatively cheap in comparison with wood or steel in most countries. In addition it is relatively easy to cut, bend and weld. Galvanic corrosion below the waterline in salt water is a serious concern, particularly in marinas where there are other conflicting metals. Aluminium is most commonly found in yachts, pontoon and power boats that are not kept permanently in the water. Aluminium yachts are particularly popular in France.

====Cupronickel====
A relatively expensive metal used only very occasionally in boatbuilding is cupronickel. Arguably the ideal metal for boat hulls, cupronickel is reasonably tough, highly resistant to corrosion in seawater, and is (because of its copper content) a very effective antifouling metal. Cupronickel may be found on the hulls of premium tugboats, fishing boats and other working boats; and may even be used for propellers and propeller shafts.

===Fiberglass===
Fiberglass (glass-reinforced plastic or GRP) is typically used for production boats because of its ability to reuse a female mould as the foundation for the shape of the boat. The resulting structure is strong in tension but often needs to be either laid up with many heavy layers of resin-saturated fiberglass or reinforced with wood or foam in order to provide stiffness. GRP hulls are largely free of corrosion though not normally fireproof. These can be solid fiberglass or of the sandwich (cored) type, in which a core of balsa, foam or similar material is applied after the outer layer of fiberglass is laid to the mould, but before the inner skin is laid. This is similar to the next type, composite, but is not usually classified as composite, since the core material in this case does not provide much additional strength. It does, however, increase stiffness, which means that less resin and fiberglass cloth can be used in order to save weight. Most fibreglass boats are currently made in an open mould, with fibreglass and resin applied by hand (hand-lay-up method). Some are now constructed by vacuum infusion where the fibres are laid out and resin is pulled into the mould by atmospheric pressure. This can produce stronger parts with more glass and less resin, but takes special materials and more technical knowledge. Older fibreglass boats before 1990 were often not constructed in controlled temperature buildings leading to the widespread problem of fibreglass pox, where seawater seeped through small holes and caused delamination. The name comes from the multitude of surface pits in the outer gelcoat layer which resembles smallpox. Sometimes the problem was caused by atmospheric moisture being trapped in the layup during construction in humid weather.

===Composite material===
&quot;Composite construction&quot; involves a variety of composite materials and methods: an early example was a timber carvel skin attached to a frame and deck beams made of iron. Sheet copper anti-fouling (&quot;copper=bottomed&quot;) could be attached to a wooden hull provided the risk of galvanic corrosion was minimised. Fast cargo vessels once were copper-bottomed to prevent being slowed by marine fouling. GRP and ferrocement hulls are classic composite hulls, the term &quot;composite&quot; applies also to plastics reinforced with fibers other than glass. When a hull is being created in a female mould, the composite materials are applied to the mould in the form of a thermosetting plastic (usually epoxy, polyester, or vinylester) and some kind of fiber cloth (fiberglass, kevlar, dynel, carbon fiber, etc.). These methods can give strength-to-weight ratios approaching that of aluminum, while requiring less specialized tools and construction skills.

===Ferrocement===

First developed in the mid-19th century in both France and Holland, ferrocement was also used for the D-Day Mulberry harbours. After a buzz of excitement among homebuilders in the 1960s, ferro building has since declined.

Ferrocement is a relatively cheap method to produce a hull, although unsuitable for commercial mass production. A steel and iron &quot;armature&quot; is built to the exact shape of the hull, ultimately being covered in galvanised chicken netting. Then, on a single day, the cement is applied by a team of plasterers. The cement:sand ratio is a very rich 4:1. As the hull thickness is typically 2.5 to 3 cms, ferrocement is unsuitable for boats less than about 15 metres LOA as there is a weight penalty; above that length there is no penalty. Properly plastered ferrocement boats have smooth hulls with fine lines, and amateur builders are advised to use professional plasterers to produce a smooth finish. In the 1960s and 1970s, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, the cheapness of ferro construction encouraged amateur builders to build hulls larger than they could afford, not anticipating that the fitting-out costs of a larger boat can be crippling.

The advantages of a ferro hull are:
* cannot burn, rot, or rust; &amp; no osmosis
* good insulation: cool in summer, warm in winter
* tougher than GRP, and almost as tough as a steel vessel; (and if damaged, easily repaired almost anywhere in the world)
* properly built, a ferro hull is as fair as a GRP hull.
* they may be cheap to buy (see disadvantages, below)

The disadvantages are:
* many home-built ferro boats are lumpy, overweight and ugly.
* some early builders, realising that their creation proved to be disappointing, scuttled their vessels and fraudulently claimed insurance.
* accordingly, ferro yachts may be difficult to sell and nigh impossible to insure.

==Hull types==
There are many hull types, and a builder should choose the most appropriate one for the boat&#x27;s intended purpose. For example, a sea-going vessel needs a hull which is more stable and robust than a hull used in rivers and canals. Hull types include:

* Smooth curve hull: these are rounded and free of chines or corners.
* Chined hulls: these hulls have flat panels (typically plywood) which meet at a sharp angle known as the &quot;chine&quot;. Chined hulls range from simple flat-bottomed boats where the topsides and bottom meet at about 110 degrees (such as banks dories and sharpies) to skiffs where the bottom is arced rather than flat. Multi-chine hulls allow an approximation of a round hull shape.
* Flat-bottomed hull: flat-bottomed hulls are suitable for canals and non-tidal rivers. They are often shallow-draft, and may operate in shallower water. They are cheap to build but, being less stable and having no keel to give directional stability, they are unsuitable for sea-going vessels. (However, large ships are almost always flat bottomed, having a suitably large draft to overcome the problems of small flat-bottomed boats).
* Displacement hulls: a displacement hull always remains partly submerged. Such a hull has a maximum &quot;hull speed&quot; which is a function of its waterline length. An exception is the catamaran, whose twin hulls are usually so fine that they do not engender a bow wave.
* Planing hulls: planing hulls have a shape that allows the boat to rise out of the water as the speed increases. Sail boats that plane are typical V-shaped at the bows and flat-bottomed aft. Hydroplanes are very light, flat bottomed, high powered speed boats that plane easily on flat water, but they become unstable in rough water. Powerboats designed for rough water are usually deep V-bottomed with a deadrise angle of about 20–23 degrees. The most common form is to have at least one chine to allow for stability when cornering and for a supportive surface on which to ride while planing. Planing hulls allow much higher speeds to be achieved, as they are not limited by the waterline length the way displacement hulls are. Planing hulls need sufficient power to &quot;reach the plane&quot;, after which the lack of drag allows high speeds yet with reduced power consumption.

==Glossary==

*Anchor: a device for holding a boat to the seabed, typically with chain and rope. Traditional anchors include the fisherman, Danforth, and plough types (such as the &quot;CQR&quot; and &quot;Delta&quot;). Recently, far more effective anchors with more reliable holding include the &quot;Rocna&quot; and the &quot;Ultra&quot;, both of which are spade anchors.
*Bitts: a pair of short strong posts of wood or steel on the deck of a boat intended to take mooring lines. Also called &quot;bollards&quot;.
*Bilge: the lowest part of the interior of a hull. Water, fuel tanks, ballast, and heavy stores are variously placed in the bilge to lower the craft&#x27;s centre of gravity.
*Bilge keels: a pair of short keels fitted on either side of the hull. Less hydro-dynamically efficient than a fin keel, they have a shallower draft. Full-length bilge keels add rigidity to a hull. Bilge keel craft are found in areas with large tidal ranges to keep the vessel upright when dried out.
*Bilge pump: a manual or electric pump for draining the bilge. Set at the lowest point, its inlet is protected by a screen to minimize blockages.
*Block: a pulley used to give a line a fair lead and multiply its hauling power. Single and double sheave blocks are common, triple rare.
*Bobstay: a stay attached between the stem and outer end of a bowsprit to prevent it from rising under the tension of sail.
*Bow: The forward end of a watercraft.
*Bowsprit: a spar that extends forward of the stem to provide an anchor for a jib.
*Breasthook: A roughly triangular component located immediately aft of the stem and between the inwales, sheer clamps, or rails of a small boat.

*Bulwarks: topsides which extend above the deck, often capped with a rail and fitted with scuppers.
*Cam cleat: a mechanical device for holding a line fast between two spring-loaded jaws.
*Catheads: timbers protruding approximately at right angles from the foredeck to support an anchor outboard of the hull.
*Capstan a vertical winch secured to the foredeck, used primarily to hoist an anchor. 
*Carlin: a longitudinal strip parallel to, but inboard of, the inwale (sheer clamp) for supporting the inboard edge of the side deck and the side of the cabin cladding.
*Chainplate: a metal bracket through-bolted through the hull for anchoring a shroud.
*Centreboard: (also dagger board) a movable keel which may be raised and lowered to accommodate shallow water and point of sail. It is held in place within a centerboard trunk.
* Chine: the part of a hull at the turn of the bilge. It may be &quot;hard&quot; (i.e. sharply angled) or &quot;soft&quot; (gradually contoured). A chine made of a single timber is known as a chine log.
*Cleat: a fitting designed to tie off lines. The most common form has a central anchor point and opposing protrusions for taking turns of a line. Also cam and jam cleats.
*Coaming: any vertical surface on a ship designed to deflect or prevent entry of water
*Cockpit: the seating area aft in a small decked vessel where the helm is.
*Counter stern: a stern rising well above the waterline ending in a point or rounded contour rather than a vertical transom. A variation is the &quot;truncated counter&quot;.
*Companionway: a passage, fitted with either steps or a ladder, for transiting between decks.
*Crosstree: a form of spreader mounted athwarts a mast for attaching or tensioning shrouds or stays.
*Deck: a structure covering part or all of a hull, supported by beams.
*Deck beam: A beam for supporting the deck.
*Dolphin striker: a short downward-facing spar fitted mid-way along a bowsprit to tension the bobstay.

*Epoxy resin: a two-part thermosetting polymer increasingly used in modern wooden boat building variously as an adhesive, filler (admixed with other materials), and a moisture-resistant barrier in hull and deck construction, sometimes applied in conjunction with reinforcing cloths such as fibreglass, kevlar or carbon fibre. 
*Fairlead: a deck fitting for redirecting a line and minimizing chafe.
*Fiddle (or fiddle rail). a low rail on a counter, stove, or table for preventing items from sliding off when the boat is heeled at sea. Catamarans have less need than monohulls for fiddles.
*Freeboard: the part of the hull between the waterline and deck of a vessel.
*Furling headsail: a jib or other headsail attached to a rotating mechanism that furls and unfurls it, manually or automatically.
*Garboard: the strake immediately on either side of the keel.
*Gimbal: a device that allows a stove or compass to self-level by pivoting in two horizontal planes simultaneously.
*Gooseneck: a pivoting metal fitting that joins a boom to a mast. Many goosenecks can be adjusted to trim the luff of a sail.
*Grab rail: an extended horizontal handhold, usually atop a cabin.
*Gudgeon: the female part of a pintle-and-gudgeon pivot or hinge, characteristically used to attach a rudder to a vessel.

*Hatch: an opening in the deck or cabin of a vessel, with a hinged, sliding, or removable cover.
*Heads: a marine toilet, deriving from toileting at the catsheads in square rigger days.
*Hull: the bottom and sides of a vessel.
*Inwale (or &quot;sheer clamp&quot;): the upper, inner longitudinal structural member of the hull, to which topside panels are fixed. 
*Keel: the main structural member of a traditional vessel, running fore and aft from bow to stern on its centerline. It provides ballast for stability, and resistance to leeway moving through the water.
*Keelson: an internal beam fixed to the top of the keel to strengthen the joint of the upper members of the boat to the keel.
*King plank: the central board of a foredeck. Its sides are notched to receive the tapered forward ends of deck planking so that no end grain is exposed.
*Knee: a short L-shaped piece of wood that joins or strengthens the joint in boat parts that meet between roughly 60 and 120 degrees. It may be a natural crook from a suitable wood species, sawn from a larger piece of timber, or laminated to size. Commonly used on thwarts to join topsides or keelsons to join transoms. A hanging knee sits upright beneath a thwart to support it. Hanging knees often support carlins where a full frame would be inconvenient.
*Locker: an enclosed storage space
*Mast: a large vertical spar which supports the sails. It may be supported by standing rigging, but some rigs (such a junks) have unstayed masted.
*Mast step: a socket to take the downward thrust of the mast and hold it in position. May be on the keel or on the deck in smaller craft. A deck-stepped mast may be supported by a column below the deck.
*Mizzen: the aftmost mast and sail in a yawl or ketch, or in a vessel with three or more masts.
*Oar a wooden pole enlarged on one end to resist the water when pulled. 
*Painter: a short line at the bow of a small boat for tying it off.
*Parrot beak: a spring-loaded stainless steel fitting on the end of a spinnaker pole attaching it to the sail.
*Pintle: the male half of a pintle-and-gudgeon pivot or hinge.
*Ratlines (traditionally &quot;ratlins&quot;): lines woven horizontally between the shrouds of a square-rigged ship to provide footholds for ascending to the yards.
*Rib: a thin strip of pliable timber laid athwarts inside a hull from inwale to inwale at regular close intervals to reinforce its planking. Ribs differ from frames or futtocks in being far smaller dimensions and bent in place compared to frames or futtocks, which are normally sawn to shape, or natural crooks that are shaped to fit with an adze, axe or chisel.
*Rigging: standing rigging (either &quot;stays&quot; or shrouds&quot;) are the wire cables or rods that support the mast(s). Running rigging are the ropes (&quot;sheets&quot;) to control the sails. 
*Rowlock (pronounced &quot;rollock&quot;;(also &quot;oarlock&quot;): a U-shaped metal device that secures an oar and acts as a fulcrum during the motion of rowing. 
*Rudder: a hinged vertical plate at the stern for steering a craft. There may be more than one rudder.
*Sampson post: a strong vertical post which supports a ship&#x27;s windlass and the heel of its bowsprit, also used to making off mooring lines.
*Scuppers: gaps in the bulwarks permitting water to drain off the deck.
*Shackle: a U-shaped fitting secured by a removable pin for securely connecting chains, lines, and other fittings. Known as a &quot;snap shackle&quot; when fitted with a spring-loaded pin.
*Sheave box: a plastic or stainless steel box that holds a pulley that is fixed in position as on a mast head.
*Sheer: the generally curved shape of the upper hull. It is traditionally lowest amidships to maximize freeboard at the ends of the hull. Sheer can be reverse, higher in the middle to maximize space inside, or straight or a combination of shapes.
*Sheet: a line which controls the clew of a sail.
*Skeg: a vertical blade beneath the hull, typically to support and protect the rudder and to promote the rudder&#x27;s efficiency by preventing &quot;stalling&quot;.
*Spar: s length of timber, aluminium, steel or carbon fibre of approximately round or pear shaped cross-section which supports a sail or sails. Spars include the mast, boom, gaff, yard, bowsprit, prod, boomkin, pole and dolphin striker.
*Sole: the floor of a cabin or cockpit.
*Spinnaker (or &quot;kite&quot;): a large, lightweight, down-wind sail used on fore and aft rigged yachts such as sloops to dramatically increase sail area typically used running with the wind.
*Spring: the amount of fore and aft curvature in the keel.
*Stanchions: a post for holding life lines on a deck.
*Stainless steel: a corrosion-resistant alloy of mild steel and small percentages of such metals as copper, chromium, molybdenum, and nickel. Common alloys are &quot;18/8&quot; (known as &quot;surgical stainless steel&quot;) and &quot;316&quot; (&quot;marine grade&quot;), which contains more salt-water resistant nickel.
*Stays/shrouds: standing or running rigging which holds a spar in position (e.g. forestay, backstay, bobstay). Formerly made of rope, typically of braided stainless steel wire, occasionally solid metal rod.
*Stem: a continuation of the keel upwards at the bow where the two sides of the hull meet.
*Stern: the aftmost part of a boat, often ending in a transom.
*Stern sheets a flat area or deck, inboard of the transom in a small boat. It may contain hatches to access below decks or provide storage on deck for life saving equipment.
*Strake: planking, running from the &quot;garboard&quot; strake affixed to the keel to the &quot;sheer&quot; strake below the caprail.
*Stringer (also &quot;batten&quot;): a long relatively thin, knot free length of wood, running fore and aft, often used to reinforce planking on the inside of the hull.
*Synthetic rope: lines manufactured from chained chemicals. The four most common are: polyester (including brand names Dacron and Terylene), a strong, low stretch line, usually plaited (braided) used for running rigging; nylon, a strong but elastic line resistant to shock loads, best suited for mooring lines and anchor warps. It is usually laid (twisted) so to make it easier to grip when hauling; polypropylene, a light, cheap, slippery, buoyant line, typically laid, which is by far the weakest of the four, and deteriorates when exposed to sunlight. Commonly used on commercial fishing boats using nets; and Kevlar, an extremely strong and expensive fibre with almost no stretch, usually braided and best suited for halyards.
*Taff rail: a railing at the extreme stern of a vessel.
*Thwart: a transverse member used to maintain the shape of the topsides of a small boat, often doubling as a seat.
*Tiller: a forward-facing attached to the rudder allowing a helmsman to steer a boat. On a dinghy, the tiller may have a hinged extension called a &quot;jigger&quot;.
*Toe rail: an upright longitudinal strip of wood surrounding a deck near the sheer, especially forward, for safety and to provide purchase when a boat is heeled.
*Topping lift: a line running from a cleat on the mast through a block at the masthead and down to the aft end of a boom for supporting the boom when not in use or when reefing. 
*Topsides: the side planking of a boat from the waterline to the sheerstrake.
*Transom: a vertical part of the hull at the stern. Transoms provide width and additional buoyancy at the stern. Dinghies may attach an outboard motor to the transom.
*Warp: anchor line, traditionally made of stiff natural fibre such as hemp, today of stronger, lighter, synthetic fibres such as laid nylon, prized for its elasticity in absorbing shock loads on an anchor. 
*Winch: a geared device providing both friction and mechanical advantage in sail trimming, hoisting large sails, and retrieving an anchor. Some winches are self-tailing, allowing efficient one-man usage, others electrically powered.
*Wind pennant: a small pivoting masthead wind indicator.
*Yard: a horizontal spar on a square rigged ship fitted to the forward side of a mast, holding a square sail forward of the shrouds. An extension to the yard is the &quot;yard-arm&quot;.

<text>Jeanette Anna MacDonald (June 18, 1903 – January 14, 1965) was an American soprano and actress best remembered for her musical films of the 1930s with Maurice Chevalier (&quot;The Love Parade&quot;, &quot;Love Me Tonight&quot;, &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; and &quot;One Hour With You&quot;) and Nelson Eddy (&quot;Naughty Marietta&quot;, &quot;Rose-Marie&quot;, and &quot;Maytime&quot;). During the 1930s and 1940s she starred in 29 feature films, four nominated for Best Picture Oscars (&quot;The Love Parade&quot;, &quot;One Hour with You&quot;, &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot; and &quot;San Francisco&quot;), and recorded extensively, earning three gold records. She later appeared in opera, concerts, radio, and television. MacDonald was one of the most influential sopranos of the 20th century, introducing opera to film-going audiences and inspiring a generation of singers.

==Early years==
MacDonald was born Jeannette Anna McDonald on June 18, 1903, at her family&#x27;s Philadelphia home at 5123 Arch Street. She was the youngest of the three daughters of Anna May (née Wright) and Daniel McDonald, a factory foreman and a salesman for a contracting household building company, respectively, and the younger sister of character actress Blossom Rock (born Edith McDonald, also known as Marie Blake), who was most famous as &quot;Grandmama&quot; on the 1960s TV series &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. She was of Scottish, English, and Dutch descent. The extra N in her given name was later dropped for simplicity&#x27;s sake, and A added to her surname to emphasize her Scottish heritage. She began dancing lessons with local dance instructor Caroline Littlefield, mother of American ballerina/choreographer Catherine Littlefield, when very young, performing in juvenile operas, recitals, and shows staged by Littlefield around the city, including at the Academy of Music. She later took lessons with Al White and began touring in his kiddie shows, heading his &quot;Six Little Song Birds&quot; in Philadelphia at the age of nine.

==Acting career==
===Broadway===

In November 1919, MacDonald joined her older sister Blossom in New York. She took singing lessons with Wassili Leps and landed a job in the chorus of Ned Wayburn&#x27;s &quot;The Demi-Tasse Revue&quot;, a musical entertainment presented between films at the Capitol Theatre on Broadway. In 1920, she appeared in two musicals: Jerome Kern&#x27;s &quot;The Night Boat&quot; as a chorus replacement, and &quot;Irene&quot; on the road as the second female lead; future film star Irene Dunne played the title role during part of the tour, and Helen Shipman played the title role during the other part of the tour. In 1921, MacDonald played in &quot;Tangerine&quot; as one of the &quot;Six Wives.&quot; In 1922, she was a featured singer in the Greenwich Village revue &quot;Fantastic Fricassee&quot;, for which good press notices brought her a role in &quot;The Magic Ring&quot; the next year. MacDonald played the second female lead in this long-running musical which starred Mitzi Hajos. In 1925, MacDonald again had the second female lead opposite Queenie Smith in &quot;Tip Toes&quot;, a George Gershwin hit show.

The following year, 1926, found MacDonald still in a second female lead in &quot;Bubblin&#x27; Over&quot;, a musical version of &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot;. She finally landed a starring role in &quot;Yes, Yes, Yvette&quot; in 1927. Planned as a sequel to producer H.H. Frazee&#x27;s &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;, the show toured extensively, but failed to please the critics when it arrived on Broadway. MacDonald also played the lead in her next two plays: &quot;Sunny Days&quot; in 1928 in her first show for the producers Lee and J.J. Shubert, for which she received rave reviews; and &quot;Angela&quot; (1928), which the critics panned. Her last play was &quot;Boom Boom&quot; in 1929, with her name above the title; the cast included young Archie Leach, who would later become Cary Grant.

While MacDonald was appearing in &quot;Angela&quot;, film star Richard Dix spotted her and had her screen-tested for his film &quot;Nothing but the Truth&quot;. The Shuberts, however, would not let her out of her contract to appear in the film, which starred Dix and Helen Kane (the &quot;Boop-boop-a-doop girl&quot;). In 1929, famed film director Ernst Lubitsch was looking through old screen tests of Broadway performers and spotted MacDonald. He cast her as the leading lady in &quot;The Love Parade&quot;, his first sound film, which starred Maurice Chevalier.

===Film career===
====Paramount, controversial move to Fox Film Corporation====
In the first rush of sound films during 1929 and 1930, MacDonald starred in six films—the first four for Paramount Studios. Her first, &quot;The Love Parade&quot; (1929), directed by Ernst Lubitsch and co-starring Maurice Chevalier, was a landmark of early sound films, and received a Best Picture nomination. MacDonald&#x27;s first recordings for RCA Victor were two hits from the score: &quot;Dream Lover&quot; and &quot;March of the Grenadiers.&quot; &quot;The Vagabond King&quot; (1930) was a lavish two-strip Technicolor film version of Rudolf Friml&#x27;s hit 1925 operetta. Broadway star Dennis King reprised his role as 15th-century French poet François Villon, and MacDonald was Princess Katherine. She sang &quot;Some Day&quot; and &quot;Only a Rose.&quot; The UCLA Film and Television Archive owns the only known color print of this production.

Both Paramount and MacDonald were extremely busy in 1930. &quot;Paramount on Parade&quot; was an all-star revue, similar to other mammoth sound revues produced by major studios to introduce their formerly silent stars to the public. MacDonald&#x27;s footage singing a duet of &quot;Come Back to Sorrento&quot; with Nino Martini was cut from the release print due to copyright reasons with Universal Studios, which had recently acquired the copyright to the song for an upcoming movie, &quot;King of Jazz&quot;. &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Native&quot; was a desert-island comedy directed by Leo McCarey, co-starring the likes of Jack Oakie and Kay Francis. &quot;Monte Carlo&quot; became another highly regarded Lubitsch classic, with British musical star Jack Buchanan as a count who disguises himself as a hairdresser in order to woo a scatterbrained countess (MacDonald). MacDonald introduced &quot;Beyond the Blue Horizon,&quot; which she recorded three times during her career, including performing it for the Hollywood Victory Committee film &quot;Follow the Boys&quot;.

In hopes of producing her own films, MacDonald went to United Artists to make &quot;The Lottery Bride&quot; in 1930. Despite music by Rudolf Friml, the film was not successful. MacDonald next signed a three-picture deal with the Fox Film Corporation, a controversial move in Hollywood; every other studio was far superior in the eyes of many, from their budgets to the fantastical entertainment of their films. &quot;Oh, for a Man!&quot; (1930) was more successful; MacDonald portrayed a temperamental opera singer who sings Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Liebestod&quot; and falls for an Irish burglar played by Reginald Denny. In 1931, &quot;Don&#x27;t Bet on Women&quot; was a non-musical drawing-room comedy in which a playboy (Edmund Lowe) bets his happily married friend (Roland Young) that he can seduce his friend&#x27;s wife (MacDonald). &quot;Annabelle&#x27;s Affairs&quot; (1931) was a farce, with MacDonald as a sophisticated New York playgirl who does not recognize her own miner husband, played by Victor McLaglen, when he turns up five years later. Although highly praised by reviewers at the time, only one reel of this film survives.

MacDonald took a break from Hollywood in 1931 to embark on a European concert tour, performing at the Empire Theater in Paris (Mistinguett and Morris Gest were said to have been in the crowd) and at London&#x27;s Dominion Theatre, and was invited to dinner parties with British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald and French newspaper critics. She returned to Paramount the following year for two films with Chevalier. &quot;One Hour with You&quot; in 1932 was directed by both George Cukor and Ernst Lubitsch, and simultaneously filmed in French with the same stars, but a French supporting cast. Currently, no surviving print of &quot;Une Heure près de toi&quot; (&quot;One Hour With You&quot;) is known. Rouben Mamoulian directed &quot;Love Me Tonight&quot; (1932), considered by many film critics and writers to be the perfect film musical. Starring Chevalier as a humble tailor in love with a princess played by MacDonald, much of the story is told in sung dialogue. Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart wrote the original score, which included the standards &quot;Mimi,&quot; &quot;Lover,&quot; and &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Romantic?&quot;

====MGM, Nelson Eddy partnership====

In 1933, MacDonald left again for Europe, and while there signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Her first MGM film was &quot;The Cat and the Fiddle&quot; (1934), based on the Jerome Kern Broadway hit. Her co-star was Ramón Novarro. The plot about unmarried lovers shacking up just barely slipped through the new Production Code guidelines that took effect July 1, 1934. Despite a Technicolor finale—the first use of the new three-color Technicolor process other than Disney cartoons—the film was not a huge success. It lost $142,000. In &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; (1934), director Ernst Lubitsch reunited Maurice Chevalier and MacDonald in a lavish version of the classic 1905 Franz Lehár operetta. The film was highly regarded by critics and operetta lovers in major U.S. cities and Europe, but failed to generate much income outside urban areas, losing $113,000. It had a huge budget of $1.6 million, partially because it was filmed simultaneously in French as &quot;La Veuve Joyeuse&quot;, with a French supporting cast and some minor plot changes.

&quot;Naughty Marietta&quot; (1935), directed by W. S. Van Dyke, was MacDonald&#x27;s first film in which she teamed with newcomer baritone Nelson Eddy. Victor Herbert&#x27;s 1910 score, with songs like &quot;Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m Falling in Love with Someone,&quot; &quot;&#x27;Neath the Southern Moon,&quot; &quot;Tramp, Tramp, Tramp,&quot; and &quot;Italian Street Song,&quot; enjoyed renewed popularity. The film won an Oscar for sound recording, and received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. It was voted one of the Ten Best Pictures of 1935 by the New York film critics, was awarded the &quot;Photoplay&quot; Gold Medal Award as Best Picture of 1935 (beating out &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, which won the Oscar), and in 2004 was selected to the National Film Registry. MacDonald earned gold records for &quot;Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life&quot; and &quot;Italian Street Song.&quot; The following year, MacDonald starred in two of the highest-grossing films of that year. In &quot;Rose-Marie&quot;, MacDonald played a haughty opera diva who learns her young brother (pre-fame James Stewart) has killed a Mountie and is hiding in the northern woods; Eddy is the Mountie sent to capture him. Nelson Eddy and she sang Rudolf Friml&#x27;s &quot;Indian Love Call&quot; to each other in the Canadian wilderness (actually filmed at Lake Tahoe). Eddy&#x27;s definitive portrayal of the steadfast Mountie became a popular icon. When the Canadian Mounties temporarily retired their distinctive hat in 1970, photos of Eddy in his &quot;Rose Marie&quot; uniform appeared in thousands of U.S. newspapers. &quot;San Francisco&quot; (1936) was also directed by W.S. Van Dyke. In this tale of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, MacDonald played a hopeful opera singer opposite Clark Gable as the extra-virile proprietor of a Barbary Coast gambling joint, and Spencer Tracy as his boyhood chum who has become a priest and gives the moral messages.

In the summer of 1936, filming began on &quot;Maytime&quot;, co-starring Nelson Eddy, Frank Morgan, and Paul Lukas, produced by Irving Thalberg. After Thalberg&#x27;s untimely death in September, production was shut down and the half-finished film scrapped. A new script was filmed with a different storyline and supporting actors (including John Barrymore, whose relationship with MacDonald was strained due to his alcoholism). The &#x27;second&#x27; &quot;Maytime&quot; (1937), was the top-grossing film worldwide of the year, and is regarded as one of the best film musicals of the 1930s. &quot;Will You Remember&quot; by Sigmund Romberg brought MacDonald another gold record.

&quot;The Firefly&quot; (1937) was MacDonald&#x27;s first solo-starring film at MGM with her name alone above the title. Rudolf Friml&#x27;s 1912 stage score was borrowed, and a new song, &quot;The Donkey Serenade,&quot; added, adapted from Friml&#x27;s &quot;Chanson&quot; piano piece. With real-life Americans rushing to fight in the ongoing revolution in Spain, this historical vehicle was constructed around a previous revolution in Napoleonic times. MacDonald&#x27;s co-star was tenor Allan Jones, who she demanded get the same treatment as she would, such as an equal number of close-ups. The MacDonald/Eddy team had split after MacDonald&#x27;s engagement and marriage to Gene Raymond, but neither of their solo films grossed as much as the team films, and an unimpressed Mayer used this to point out why Jones could not replace Eddy in the next project. &quot;The Girl of the Golden West&quot; (1938) was the result, but the two stars had little screen time together, and the main song, &quot;Obey Your Heart,&quot; was never sung as a duet. The film featured an original score by Sigmund Romberg, and reused the popular David Belasco stage plot (also employed by opera composer Giacomo Puccini for &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot;).
Mayer had promised MacDonald the studio&#x27;s first Technicolor feature, and he delivered with &quot;Sweethearts&quot; (1938), co-starring Eddy. In contrast to the previous film, the co-stars were relaxed onscreen and singing frequently together. The film integrated Victor Herbert&#x27;s 1913 stage score into a modern backstage story scripted by Dorothy Parker and Alan Campbell. MacDonald and Eddy played a husband-and-wife Broadway musical-comedy team who are offered a Hollywood contract. &quot;Sweethearts&quot; won the &quot;Photoplay&quot; Gold Medal Award as Best Picture of the Year. Mayer dropped plans for the team to co-star in &quot;Let Freedom Ring&quot;, a vehicle first announced for them in 1935. Only Eddy starred, whereas MacDonald and Lew Ayres co-starred in &quot;Broadway Serenade&quot; (1939) as a contemporary musical couple who clash when her career flourishes while his founders. MacDonald&#x27;s performance was subdued, and choreographer Busby Berkeley, just hired away from Warner Bros., was called upon to add an over-the-top finale in an effort to improve the film. &quot;Broadway Serenade&quot; did not entice audiences in a lot of major cities, with &quot;Variety&quot; claiming that New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles&#x27; cinema attendances were &quot;sad,&quot; &quot;slow,&quot;and &quot;sour.&quot;

Following &quot;Broadway Serenade&quot;, and not coincidentally right after Nelson Eddy&#x27;s surprise elopement with Ann Franklin, MacDonald left Hollywood on a concert tour and refused to renew her MGM contract. Months later she summoned her manager Bob Ritchie from London to help her renegotiate. After initially insisting that she wanted to film &quot;Smilin&#x27; Through&quot; with James Stewart and Robert Taylor, MacDonald finally relented and agreed to film &quot;New Moon&quot; (1940) with Eddy, which proved to be one of MacDonald&#x27;s more popular films. Composer Sigmund Romberg&#x27;s 1927 Broadway hit provided the plot and the songs: &quot;Lover, Come Back to Me,&quot; &quot;One Kiss,&quot; and &quot;Wanting You,&quot; plus Eddy&#x27;s version of &quot;Stout Hearted Men.&quot; This was followed by &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; (1940), a Technicolor film version of Noël Coward&#x27;s 1929 stage operetta, which Coward loathed, writing in his diary about how &quot;vulgar&quot; he found it. &quot;Smilin&#x27; Through&quot; (1941) was MacDonald&#x27;s next Technicolor project, the third adaptation filmed in Hollywood, with Brian Aherne and Gene Raymond. Its theme of reunion with deceased loved ones was enormously popular after the devastation of World War I, and MGM reasoned that it should resonate with audiences during World War II, but it failed to make a profit. MacDonald played a dual role—Moonyean, a Victorian girl accidentally murdered by a jealous lover, and Kathleen, her niece, who falls in love with the son of the murderer.

&quot;I Married an Angel&quot; (1942), was adapted from the Rodgers &amp; Hart stage musical about an angel who loses her wings on her wedding night. The script by Anita Loos suffered serious censorship cuts during filming that made the result less successful. MacDonald sang &quot;Spring Is Here&quot; and the title song. It was the final film made by the team of MacDonald and Eddy. After a falling-out with Mayer, Eddy bought out his MGM contract (with one film left to make) and went to Universal, where he signed a million-dollar, two-picture deal. MacDonald remained for one last film, &quot;Cairo&quot; (1942), a cheaply budgeted spy comedy co-starring Robert Young as a reporter and Ethel Waters as a maid, whom MacDonald personally requested. Within one year, beginning in 1942, L.B. Mayer released his four highest-paid actresses from their MGM contracts; Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Greta Garbo, and Jeanette MacDonald. Of those four stars, MacDonald was the only one whom Mayer would rehire.

====Final roles====

After opening the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s membership campaign, MacDonald appeared as herself in &quot;Follow the Boys&quot; (1944), an all-star extravaganza about Hollywood stars entertaining the troops. The more than 40 guest stars included Marlene Dietrich, W.C. Fields, Sophie Tucker, and Orson Welles. MacDonald is shown during a concert singing &quot;Beyond the Blue Horizon,&quot; and in a studio-filmed sequence singing &quot;I&#x27;ll See You in My Dreams&quot; to a blinded soldier. She returned to MGM after five years off the screen for two films. &quot;Three Daring Daughters&quot; (1948) co-starred José Iturbi as her love interest. MacDonald plays a divorcée whose lively daughters (Jane Powell, Ann E. Todd, and Elinor Donahue) keep trying to get her back with her ex, but she has secretly remarried. The song &quot;The Dickey Bird&quot; made the hit parade. &quot;The Sun Comes Up&quot; (1949) teamed MacDonald with Lassie in an adaptation of a short story by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings. MacDonald played a widow who has lost her son, but warms to orphan Claude Jarman Jr. It would prove to be her final film.

She frequently attempted a comeback movie, even financing and paying a screenwriter. One of the possible film reunions with Nelson Eddy was to be made in England, but Eddy pulled out when he learned MacDonald was investing her own funds. Eddy preferred to publicly blame the proposed project as mediocre, when in fact MacDonald was uninsurable due to her heart condition. A reunion with Maurice Chevalier was also considered. Other thwarted projects with Eddy were &quot;The Rosary&quot;, &quot;The Desert Song&quot;, and a remake of &quot;The Vagabond King&quot;, plus two movie treatments written by Eddy for them, &quot;Timothy Waits for Love&quot; and &quot;All Stars Don&#x27;t Spangle&quot;. Offers continued to come in, and in 1962, producer Ross Hunter proposed MacDonald in his 1963 comedy &quot;The Thrill of It All&quot;, but she declined. 20th Century Fox also toyed with the idea of MacDonald (Irene Dunne was briefly considered) for the part of Mother Abbess in the film version of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. It never moved beyond the discussion stages partly because of MacDonald&#x27;s failing health.

An annual poll of film exhibitors listed MacDonald as one of the top-10 box-office draws of 1936, and many of her films were among the top-20 moneymakers of the years they were released. In addition, MacDonald was one of the top-10 box-office attractions in Great Britain from 1937 to 1942. During her 39-year career, MacDonald earned two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (for films and recordings) and planted her feet in the wet concrete in front of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theater.

===Musical theatre===
In the mid-1950s, MacDonald toured in summer-stock productions of &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; and &quot;The King and I&quot;. She opened in &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; at the Iroquois Amphitheater, Louisville, Kentucky, on July 19, 1954. Her production of &quot;The King and I&quot; opened August 20, 1956, at the Starlight Theatre. While performing there, she collapsed. Officially, it was announced as heat prostration, but in fact it was a heart seizure. She began limiting her appearances, and a reprisal of &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; in 1959 was her last professional stage appearance.

MacDonald and her husband Gene Raymond toured in Ferenc Molnár&#x27;s &quot;The Guardsman&quot;. The production opened at the Erlanger Theater in Buffalo, New York, on January 25, 1951, and played in 23 Northeastern and Midwestern cities until June 2, 1951. Despite less-than-enthusiastic comments from critics, the show played to full houses for virtually every performance. The leading role of &quot;The Actress&quot; was changed to &quot;The Singer&quot; to allow MacDonald to add some songs. While this pleased her fans, the show closed before reaching Broadway.

In the 1950s, talks with respect to a Broadway return occurred. In the 1960s, MacDonald was approached about starring on Broadway in a musical version of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. Harold Prince recounts in his autobiography visiting MacDonald at her home in Bel Air to discuss the proposed project. Composer Hugh Martin also wrote a song for the musical, entitled &quot;Wasn&#x27;t It Romantic?&quot;

MacDonald also made a few nightclub appearances. She sang and danced at The Sands and The Sahara in Las Vegas in 1953, The Coconut Grove in Los Angeles in 1954, and again at The Sahara in 1957, but she never felt entirely comfortable in their smoky atmospheres.

==Music career==
===Concert tours, World War II charity work===
Starting in 1931 and continuing through the 1950s, MacDonald engaged in regular concert tours between films. Her first European tour was in 1931, where she sang in both France and England. Her first American concert tour was in 1939, immediately after the completion of &quot;Broadway Serenade&quot;. MacDonald performed at the Mayo Civic Auditorium in Rochester, Minnesota on April 19, 1939, to open that venue before an audience. She sang several times at the Hollywood Bowl and Carnegie Hall. When America joined World War II in 1941, MacDonald co-founded the Army Emergency Relief and raised funds on concert tours. When she was home in Hollywood, she held an open house at her home on Sunday afternoons for GIs. On one occasion, at the request of Lt. Ronald Reagan, she was singing for a large group of men in San Francisco who were due to ship out to the fierce fighting in the South Pacific. She closed with &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic,&quot; and 20,000 voices spontaneously joined in. She auctioned off encores for donations and raised almost $100,000 for the troops (over $1.5 million, adjusted for inflation). President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who considered MacDonald and Eddy two of his favorite film stars, awarded her a medal. She also did command performances at the White House for President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

===Opera===

Unlike Nelson Eddy, who came from opera to film, MacDonald in the 1940s yearned to reinvent herself in opera. She began training for this goal with Lotte Lehmann, one of the leading opera stars of the early 20th century. &quot;When Jeanette MacDonald approached me for coaching lessons,&quot; wrote Lehmann, &quot;I was really curious how a glamorous movie star, certainly spoiled by the adoration of a limitless world, would be able to devote herself to another, a higher level of art. I had the surprise of my life. There couldn&#x27;t have been a more diligent, a more serious, a more pliable person than Jeanette. The lessons which I had started with a kind of suspicious curiosity turned out to be sheer delight for me. She studied Marguerite with me—and lieder. These were the ones which astounded me most. I am quite sure that Jeanette would have developed into a serious and successful lieder singer if time would have allowed it.&quot;

MacDonald made her opera debut singing Juliette in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; in Montreal at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre (May 8, 1943). She quickly repeated the role in Quebec City (May 12), Ottawa (May 15 and 17), Toronto (May 20 and 22), and Windsor (May 24). Her U.S. debut with the Chicago Opera Company (November 4, 11 and 15, 1944) was in the same role. She also sang Marguerite in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; with the Chicago Opera. In the summer of 1945, she appeared with the Cincinnati Opera as Juliette in two performances of &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; (July 10 and 25) and one as Marguerite in &quot;Faust&quot; (July 15). That November, she did two more performances of &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; and one of &quot;Faust&quot; in Chicago. On December 12, 1951, she did one performance of &quot;Faust&quot; with the Philadelphia Civic Grand Opera Company at the Academy of Music.

Claudia Cassidy, the music critic of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote, &quot;Her Juliet is breathtakingly beautiful to the eye and dulcet to the ear.&quot; The same critic reviewed &quot;Faust&quot;: &quot;From where I sit at the opera, Jeanette MacDonald has turned out to be one of the welcome surprises of the season ... her Marguerite was better than her Juliet ... beautifully sung with purity of line and tone, a good trill, and a Gallic inflection that understood Gounod&#x27;s phrasing ... You felt if Faust must sell his soul to the devil, at least this time he got his money&#x27;s worth.&quot;

==Radio and television==

MacDonald&#x27;s extensive radio career may have begun on a 1929 radio broadcast of the &quot;Publix Hour&quot;. She was on the Academy Awards ceremony broadcast in 1931. She hosted her own radio show, &quot;Vicks Open House&quot;, from September 1937 to March 1938, for which she received $5,000 a week. However, the time demands of doing a weekly live radio show while filming, touring in concerts, and making records proved enormously difficult, and after fainting on-air during one show, she decided not to renew her radio contract with Vicks at the end of the 26-week season. Thereafter, she stuck to guest appearances.

MacDonald appeared in condensed radio versions of many of her films on programs such as Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot;, often with Nelson Eddy, and the &quot;Railroad Hour&quot;, which starred Gordon MacRae. These included &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot;, &quot;Rose Marie&quot;, &quot;Maytime&quot;, &quot;Sweethearts&quot;, &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot;, &quot;Smilin&#x27; Through&quot;, and &quot;The Sun Comes Up&quot;, plus other operettas and musicals such as Victor Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Mlle Modiste&quot;, &quot;Irene&quot;, &quot;The Student Prince&quot;, &quot;Tonight or Never&quot; with Melvyn Douglas, &quot;A Song for Clotilda&quot;, &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot;, and &quot;Apple Blossoms&quot;. Other radio shows included &quot;The Prudential Family Hour&quot;, &quot;Screen Guild Playhouse&quot;, and &quot;The Voice of Firestone&quot;, which featured the top opera and concert singers of the time. In 1953, MacDonald sang &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at the inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, broadcast on both radio and TV.

MacDonald sang frequently with Nelson Eddy during the mid-1940s on several &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; and &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot; productions of their films together. She also appeared as his guest several times on his various radio shows such as &quot;The Electric Hour&quot; and &quot;The Kraft Music Hall&quot;. He was also a surprise guest when she hosted a war-bonds program called &quot;Guest Star&quot;, and they sang on other World War II victory shows together. The majority of her radio work in the mid to late 1940s was with Eddy. Her 1948 Hollywood Bowl concert was also broadcast over the air, in which she used Eddy&#x27;s longtime accompanist, Theodore Paxson.

MacDonald appeared on early TV, most frequently as a singing guest star. She sang on &quot;The Voice of Firestone&quot; on November 13, 1950. On November 12, 1952, she was the subject of Ralph Edwards&#x27; &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. Her surprise guests included her sisters, a sailor she danced with at the Hollywood Canteen, her former English teacher, her husband and the clergyman who married them, and Nelson Eddy appeared as a voice from her past, singing the song he sang at her wedding; his surprise appearance brought her to tears. Shortly thereafter, she appeared as the mystery guest on the December 21, 1952, episode of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; After the panelists guessed her identity, she told John Daly she was in New York for the holidays and would have a recital at Carnegie Hall on January 16. On February 2, 1956, MacDonald starred in &quot;Prima Donna&quot;, a television pilot for her own series, written for her by her husband Gene Raymond. The initial show featured guest stars Leo Durocher and Larraine Day, but it failed to find a slot. In December 1956, MacDonald and Eddy made their first TV appearance as a team on the &quot;Lux Video Theatre Holiday Special&quot;. In 1957, Eddy and she appeared on Patti Page&#x27;s program &quot;The Big Record&quot;, singing several songs. On &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; (March 28, 1957), MacDonald played Charley&#x27;s real aunt to Art Carney&#x27;s impersonation in &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt.&quot;

==Personal life==

When MacDonald was born, her father quickly doted on her. Although he had hoped for a son who would pursue &quot;an American dream&quot; life that he believed he had failed to live himself, he advised his three daughters to do this instead. MacDonald was the only daughter in the family that had inherited both her father&#x27;s red hair and blue-green eyes, although she often admired her sisters&#x27; beauty, such as Blossom&#x27;s dimples and her elder sister Elsie&#x27;s (1893—1970) blonde hair and blue eyes. Elsie could play the piano, and taught toddler MacDonald a variety of popular waltzes and Stephen Foster&#x27;s compositions. At this time, MacDonald discovered that she was an extrovert who enjoyed socializing with friends and performing for others, admitting that &quot;[I] needed people to watch and applaud me as much as I needed food and drink.&quot; At the end of her first performance in the local church as a child, &quot;I paused ever so slightly and then, when I realized they needed prodding, I promptly began clapping my hands and said to the congregation, &#x27;Now everybody&#x27;s got to clap!&#x27;&quot;

MacDonald cited the number thirteen as her lucky number. Her characters always had a name beginning with M, the first letter of her surname and the 13th letter of the English alphabet, a ritual upon which she had insisted. Interestingly, thirteen became a recurring number throughout her life, such as the thirteen-year gap between her overseas tours in Europe; principal photography for &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; had taken thirteen weeks to film; her first movie, &quot;The Love Parade&quot;, was the number-one box-office draw for 13 weeks; MacDonald performed opera for the first time for a screen test thirteen years after meeting Newell (who was also on set); the thirteen-year gap between her and sister Blossom&#x27;s death; and husband Gene Raymond&#x27;s birthday was August 13.

On sets, MacDonald would never lip-sync, instead singing along to song playbacks during filming, which Lew Ayres discovered when he starred alongside her in &quot;Broadway Serenade&quot;, whereupon he was supplied with earplugs after the volume nauseated him. 
A recurrent issue throughout MacDonald&#x27;s career was her health. Her handwritten letter from August, 1929 indicates that MacDonald, age 26, had recently suffered a heart attack. She also suffered from stage fright throughout her life to the point that her therapist told her to imagine that all of the members of the audience were lettuce. Due to her heart condition, she could not carry a pregnancy to term; she had blackouts and fainting spells, became stressed to the point of not being able to eat, and was frequently in and out of hospitals and trying different treatments (one being massage therapy), which only worked for a limited time. A few years before her death, MacDonald became a Religious Scientist. Her illnesses would not allow her to perform early morning filming shoots, much to her colleagues&#x27; annoyance.

MacDonald was a Republican, but she mostly avoided commenting on politics. When approached by the House Un-American Activities Committee about whether she had heard any gossip about Communist activity in Hollywood, she replied, &quot;As at any focal point, there are some belligerents, but they are no more numerous than in any other community.&quot; Neither she nor Gene Raymond were ever considered or subpoenaed for a HUAC hearing; in a radio interview, MacDonald was quoted as saying, &quot;Let he who is without sin cast the first stone&quot; in response to what her opinion was on the investigations. She fired her manager Charles Wagner for anti-Semitic abuse of her Jewish friend Constance Hope, and declared during the 1940 presidential election, &quot;I sing for Democrats and Republicans, black and white, everyone, and I just can&#x27;t talk politics.&quot;

===Relationships===
MacDonald met Jack Ohmeis (1901-1967) at a party during her appearance in &quot;Tangerine&quot;. He was an architecture student at New York University and the son of a successful bottle manufacturer. His family was hesitant about the relationship, assuming that MacDonald was a gold-digger, but accepted her after they met. She and Ohmeis became engaged a year later, but their future plans and aspirations forced them to go their separate ways; the sudden death of MacDonald&#x27;s father was another factor in the break-up. Unfortunately, the Ohmeis family would lose a lot of their fortune after the Wall Street Crash, so MacDonald loaned money to Jack, and he repaid her as soon as he could, which was as late as the 1950s. MacDonald next dated Irving Stone (1901-1968) from around 1926–28; they met when she was touring in Chicago in &quot;The Magic Ring&quot;. Stone, who lived in Milwaukee, was the nephew of the founder of the Wisconsin Boston Store, and worked in the family business. Few details were known of Stone&#x27;s romance with MacDonald until the discovery of hundreds of pages of handwritten love letters she wrote to him that were found in his apartment after his death, which happened three years after her death.

MacDonald eventually dated a Wall Street rep named Robert Ritchie (died 1972), 12 years her senior, who claimed that he was the son of a fallen millionaire. They traveled with MacDonald&#x27;s family to Hollywood, and he became a press agent for MGM. Rumors circulated that they were engaged and/or secretly married, since Ritchie was by MacDonald&#x27;s side during her European tour and they lived together—MacDonald even signing her return address as &quot;JAR&quot; (Jeanette Anna Ritchie) and referring to him as her &quot;darling husband.&quot; Despite Ritchie&#x27;s family claiming that he was married to MacDonald but the marriage had been annulled in 1935, he never confirmed the claims. He later relocated to Europe as an MGM representative, becoming responsible for recruiting Greer Garson, Hedy Lamarr, and Luise Rainer.

MacDonald married Gene Raymond in 1937. She met him at a Hollywood party two years earlier at Roszika Dolly&#x27;s home; MacDonald agreed to a date, as long as it was at her family&#x27;s dinner table. Despite the strong relationship, Raymond&#x27;s mother did not like MacDonald, attempting to snub her a few times (such as arranging her son with Janet Gaynor as a plus-one at a charity ball), and did not attend the wedding. The Raymonds lived in a 21-room Mock Tudor mansion named Twin Gables with their pet dogs and their horse White Lady, which Raymond gave to MacDonald as a birthday present; after MacDonald&#x27;s death, it was briefly owned by John Phillips and Michelle Phillips of The Mamas and Papas. MacDonald often worried about her husband&#x27;s self-esteem; his acting career was constantly shaky, and RKO Pictures eventually sold out his contract when he had two movies left to make with them in the 1950s. Although she appreciated his support, MacDonald wished that their success was equal.

Raymond was sometimes mistaken for Nelson Eddy by MacDonald&#x27;s fans and passersby, which MacDonald later admitted that she never liked: &quot;Of course we always laughed it off—sometimes Gene even obliged by signing Nelson&#x27;s name—but no one will ever know the agonies I suffered on such occasions. More than anything else in the world those days, I wanted to see him receive as much acclaim as I, to spare him these humiliations.&quot; When she reunited with Chevalier in 1957, he asked her why she had retired from films, to which she replied, &quot;Because for exactly twenty years I&#x27;ve played my best role, by his [Raymond&#x27;s] side. And I&#x27;m perfectly happy.&quot;

==Death==

MacDonald died at the Houston Methodist Hospital from heart failure on January 14, 1965, with Raymond by her hospital bed. Two years before, she had been assigned Dr. Michael DeBakey, who had recently operated successfully on the Duke of Windsor, in the hope that he could save her. Despite the surgery, MacDonald became ill with pleurisy the week after, and was in Houston Methodist Hospital for over a month. In December 1964, her condition worsened and she was rushed to UCLA Medical Center. DeBakey suggested open-heart surgery, and Raymond brought MacDonald into the hospital January 12. On the afternoon of the 14th, Raymond was at her bedside massaging her feet when she died. He said that their last conversation was when MacDonald said, &quot;I love you,&quot; and he replied, &quot;I love you too;&quot; she then sighed deeply, and her head hit the pillow.

The funeral took place on January 18. Along with close family and widower Raymond, it was notably attended by a handful of MacDonald&#x27;s costars (such as Eddy, Allan Jones, Chevalier, Joe E. Brown, Spencer Tracy, Lloyd Nolan, etc.), representatives of her fan club, former presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, Senator George Murphy, former vice-president Richard Nixon, future governor &amp; president Ronald Reagan, and Mary Pickford; Dr. Gene Emmet Clark of the Church of Religious Science officiated. Newsreel footage shows Nelson Eddy as the last person to exit the church, with Lauritz Melchior and other celebrities offering him condolences. MacDonald was interred in a pink-marbled crypt at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, which reads &quot;Jeanette MacDonald Raymond.&quot; Hers is next to Nat King Cole, and George Burns and Gracie Allen.

==Honors and commemorations==
For her contribution to the motion picture industry, MacDonald has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6157 Hollywood Blvd. For her contribution to recording, MacDonald has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1628 Vine Street. 

MacDonald was crowned as the Queen of the Movies in 1939 with Tyrone Power as her king. The ceremony was filmed and presented by Ed Sullivan.

MacDonald was awarded an honorary doctor of music degree from Ithaca College in 1956.

MacDonald was named Philadelphia&#x27;s Woman of the Year in 1961. Of the award, she said, &quot;It is strange how awards, decorations, doctorates, etc., can be conferred from various parts of the country, and even the world. And yet, the funny satisfaction of being recognized in one&#x27;s home town seems to be a more gratifying recognition than all.&quot;

===Posthumous===
Shortly after MacDonald&#x27;s death, surviving classmates from her high school contributed a $150 donation in her name to the Children&#x27;s Heart Hospital of Philadelphia.

The USC Thornton School of Music built a Jeanette MacDonald Recital Hall in her honor.

A bronze plaque for MacDonald was unveiled in March 1988 on the Philadelphia Music Alliance&#x27;s Walk of Fame in Raymond&#x27;s presence.

==Controversy==
===Autobiography===
MacDonald began developing an autobiography in the 1950s. She wanted her readers to both be inspired by her career and understand how she had coped with balancing a public and personal life. In one early version she intended to candidly discuss Nelson Eddy but dropped that idea when Eddy feared public fallout. She hired and fired other ghostwriters and wrote a manuscript solo but it was rejected by the publisher for being &quot;too genteel&quot;; MacDonald refused to include many personal details about Eddy and she deleted already typed pages admitting to one single pregnancy that ended in miscarriage. Her last ghost writer, Fredda Dudley Balling, noted that MacDonald was too ill to work more than a couple hours a day, so a final draft was never completed. The unfinished manuscript was published and annotated in 2004. MacDonald said that publishers wanted her to spice up her story. She refused to gossip about her colleagues and said she did not live that kind of life. In the last year of her life, despite declining health, she still was trying to find a publisher. An early version of the book, written with James Brough, is in the Cinematic Arts Library, Doheny Memorial Library, University of Southern California.

===Relationship with Nelson Eddy===

Despite public denials from the stars themselves of any personal relationship between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, documentation shows otherwise. In a handwritten 1935 letter by Nelson to &quot;Dearest Jeanette,&quot; written on his letterhead, Nelson Eddy writes: &quot;I love you and will always be devoted to you.&quot;

In the biography &quot;Sweethearts&quot; by Sharon Rich, the author presents MacDonald and Eddy as continuing an adulterous affair after their marriages. Rich, who was a close friend of MacDonald&#x27;s older sister Blossom Rock, also knew Gene Raymond, and documents that the relationship lasted—with a few breaks—until MacDonald&#x27;s death. Newsreel footage from MacDonald&#x27;s funeral shows Eddy as the last person exiting the chapel, circled by other celebrities, such as Lauritz Melchior, who offer him condolences.

MacDonald had a reported eight pregnancies by Eddy, the first while they were filming &quot;Rose Marie&quot;. This was before she had an intimate relationship with Gene Raymond. Raymond was physically unable to father children, and MacDonald alluded to this fact in her unfinished autobiography, writing that she returned from her Hawaii honeymoon with Raymond with the knowledge and accurate admittance that &quot;The MacRaymonds had no children.&quot; Nevertheless, MacDonald had additional, later, documented and visible pregnancies while married to Raymond, all of which ended in miscarriage.
Rich&#x27;s findings also included documentation that Raymond physically and emotionally abused MacDonald, and had affairs as early as their honeymoon when MacDonald allegedly discovered Raymond in bed with Buddy Rogers. Raymond was arrested three times, the first in January 1938, as verified by a court document, and also in England during his army service, for his behavior. Raymond&#x27;s wedding to MacDonald, orchestrated by Louis B. Mayer, forced MacDonald to become Raymond&#x27;s &quot;beard,&quot; and the 1938 arrest resulted in Mayer blacklisting him in Hollywood for almost two years.

Biographer E. J. Fleming also alleged that Eddy had confronted Raymond for abusing MacDonald, who was visibly pregnant with Eddy&#x27;s child while filming &quot;Sweethearts&quot;, which ended with Eddy attacking him and leaving him for dead, though newspapers reported Raymond was recovering from a fall down the stairs.

At that time Mayer adamantly refused to allow MacDonald to annul her marriage and elope. The situation ended with MacDonald losing her baby at nearly 6 months. The boy was named Daniel Kendrick Eddy, and Nelson buried him (or his ashes) on private property in Ojai, California.

Other co-stars and friends verified the MacDonald/Eddy relationship.

Over the decades, MacDonald and Eddy privately occupied several homes together. In 1938, they had a small Burbank house located at 812 S. Mariposa Street in Burbank. In the 1940s, Nelson leased and remodeled for himself and MacDonald the old cowboy bunkhouse at 1330 Angelo Drive, Beverly Hills. Starting in 1947, they used 710 N. Camden Drive, which had been the home of MacDonald&#x27;s mother until her death. They also alternately stayed at favorite hotels and homes across the country owned by celebrity friends including Lily Pons and Irene Dunne. In 1963, MacDonald and Raymond moved into two adjoining apartments at the Wilshire Comstock in Westwood, on the 8th floor in the East building. Nelson Eddy had his own apartment on the 7th floor of the West building, and allowed MacDonald to decorate it; they used it as a rendezvous spot until she was too weak to walk the few yards over to his building. (After Eddy&#x27;s death, his widow Ann learned of the apartment and moved into it.)

Forbidden to marry early on by MGM studio boss Louis B. Mayer, MacDonald and Eddy performed a mock wedding ceremony at Lake Tahoe while filming Rose Marie. They considered that &quot;by God&#x27;s laws&quot; they were married, although they were never able to do so legally. Every autumn, they returned to Lake Tahoe to renew their vows. As late as 1948, MacDonald&#x27;s desk diary has a &quot;Lake Tahoe&quot; entry. After their 1943 visit, Eddy wrote a lengthy diary entry about their trip and his love for her, calling her &quot;my wife,&quot; which he did in private to the end of her life.

<text>Berenice Alice Abbott (July 17, 1898 – December 9, 1991) was an American photographer best known for her portraits of cultural figures of the interwar period, New York City photographs of architecture and urban design of the 1930s, and science interpretation of the 1940s to the 1960s.

==Early years==
Abbott was born in Springfield, Ohio and brought up in Ohio by her divorced mother, née Lillian Alice Bunn (m. Charles E. Abbott in Chillicothe OH, 1886).

She attended The Ohio State University for two semesters, but left in early 1918 when her professor was dismissed because he was a German teaching an English class. She moved to New York City, where she studied sculpture and painting. In 1921 she traveled to Paris and studied sculpture with Emile Bourdelle. While in Paris, she became an assistant to Man Ray, who wanted someone with no previous knowledge of photography. Abbott took revealing portraits of Ray&#x27;s fellow artists.

==Trip to Europe, photography, and poetry==

Her university studies included theater and sculpture. She spent two years studying sculpture in Paris and Berlin. She studied at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris and the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. During this time, she adopted the French spelling of her first name, &quot;Berenice,&quot; at the suggestion of Djuna Barnes. In addition to her work in the visual arts, Abbott published poetry in the experimental literary journal &quot;transition&quot;.
Abbott first became involved with photography in 1923, when Man Ray hired her as a darkroom assistant at his portrait studio in Montparnasse. Later, she wrote: &quot;I took to photography like a duck to water. I never wanted to do anything else.&quot; Ray was impressed by her darkroom work and allowed her to use his studio to take her own photographs. In 1921 her first major works was in an exhibition in the Parisian gallery Le Sacre du Printemps. After a short time studying photography in Berlin, she returned to Paris in 1927 and started a second studio, on the rue Servandoni.
Abbott&#x27;s subjects were people in the artistic and literary worlds, including French nationals (Jean Cocteau), expatriates (James Joyce), and others just passing through the city. According to Sylvia Beach, &quot;To be &#x27;done&#x27; by Man Ray or Berenice Abbott meant you rated as somebody&quot;. Abbott&#x27;s work was exhibited with that of Man Ray, André Kertész, and others in Paris, in the &quot;Salon de l&#x27;Escalier&quot; (more formally, the Premier Salon Indépendant de la Photographie), and on the staircase of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. Her portraiture was unusual within exhibitions of modernist photography held in 1928–1929 in Brussels and Germany.

In 1925, Man Ray introduced her to Eugène Atget&#x27;s photographs. She became interested in Atget&#x27;s work, and managed to persuade him to sit for a portrait in 1927. He died shortly thereafter. She acquired the prints and negatives remaining in Eugène Atget&#x27;s studio at his death in 1927. While the government acquired much of Atget&#x27;s archive – Atget had sold 2,621 negatives in 1920, and his friend and executor André Calmettes sold 2,000 more immediately after his death — Abbott was able to buy the remainder in June 1928, and quickly started work on its promotion. An early tangible result was the 1930 book &quot;Atget, photographe de Paris&quot;&quot;,&quot; in which she is described as photo editor. Due to a lack of funding, Abbott sold a one-half interest in the collection to Julien Levy for $1,000. Abbott&#x27;s work on Atget&#x27;s behalf would continue until her sale of the archive to the Museum of Modern Art in 1968. In addition to her book &quot;The World of Atget&quot; (1964), she provided the photographs for &quot;A Vision of Paris&quot; (1963), published a portfolio, &quot;Twenty Photographs,&quot; and wrote essays. Her sustained efforts helped Atget gain international recognition.

==&quot;Changing New York&quot;==
In early 1929, Abbott visited New York City, ostensibly with the goal of finding an American publisher for Atget&#x27;s photographs. Upon seeing the city again, Abbott recognized its photographic potential. She went back to Paris, closed up her studio, and returned to New York in September. There, over the next decade, she focused on documentary photography and on portraying the city as it underwent a transformation into a modern metropolis.
During this period, Abbott became a central figure and important bridge between the photographic hubs and circles of Paris and New York City.

Her first photographs of New York were taken with a hand-held Kurt-Bentzin camera, but soon she acquired a Century Universal camera, which produced 8 × 10-inch negatives. Using this large format camera, Abbott photographed the city with the diligence and attention to detail she had so admired in Eugène Atget. After Atget&#x27;s death in 1927, she and Julien Levy had acquired a large portion of his negatives and glass slides, which she then brought over to New York in 1929. Her subsequent work provides a historical chronicle of many now-destroyed buildings and neighborhoods in Manhattan. Abbott had her first exhibition in New York in 1937 entitled &quot;Changing New York&quot; at the Museum of the City of New York. A book under the same title was also published, depicting the city&#x27;s physical transformation, including changes to its neighborhoods and the replacing of low rise buildings with skyscrapers.

Abbott worked on her New York project independently for six years, unable to get financial support from organizations (such as the Museum of the City of New York), foundations (such as the Guggenheim Foundation), or individuals. She supported herself with commercial work and with teaching gigs at the New School of Social Research beginning in 1933.

In 1935, Abbott was hired by the Federal Art Project (FAP) as a project supervisor for her &quot;Changing New York&quot; project. While she continued to take photographs of the city, she hired assistants to help her in the field and in the office. This arrangement allowed Abbott to devote all her time to producing, printing, and exhibiting her photographs. By the time she resigned from the FAP in 1939, she had produced 305 photographs that were then deposited at the Museum of the City of New York.

Abbott&#x27;s project was primarily a sociological study embedded within modernist aesthetic practices. She sought to create a broadly inclusive collection of photographs that together suggest a vital interaction between three aspects of urban life: the diverse people of the city; the places they live, work and play; and their daily activities. It was intended to empower people by making them realize that their environment was a consequence of their collective behavior (and vice versa). Moreover, she avoided the merely pretty in favor of what she described as &quot;fantastic&quot; contrasts between the old and the new, and chose her camera angles and lenses to create compositions that either stabilized a subject (if she approved of it), or destabilized it (if she scorned it).

Abbott&#x27;s ideas about New York were highly influenced by Lewis Mumford&#x27;s historical writings from the early 1930s, which divided American history into a series of technological eras. Abbott, like Mumford, was particularly critical of America&#x27;s &quot;paleotechnic era&quot;, which, as he described it, emerged at the end of the American Civil War, a development other historians have dubbed the Second Industrial Revolution. Like Mumford, Abbott was hopeful that, through urban planning efforts (aided by her photographs), Americans would be able to wrest control of their cities away from paleotechnic forces and bring about what Mumford described as a more humane and human-scaled, &quot;neotechnic era&quot;. Abbott&#x27;s agreement with Mumford can be seen especially in the ways that she photographed buildings that had been constructed in the paleotechnic era – before the advent of urban planning. Most often, buildings from this era appeared in Abbott&#x27;s photographs in compositions that made them look downright menacing.

In 1935, Abbott moved into a Greenwich Village loft with art critic Elizabeth McCausland, with whom she lived until McCausland&#x27;s death in 1965. McCausland was an ardent supporter of Abbott, writing several articles for the &quot;Springfield Daily Republican&quot;, as well as for &quot;Trend&quot; and &quot;New Masses&quot; (the latter under the pseudonym Elizabeth Noble). In addition, McCausland contributed the captions for &quot;Changing New York&quot; which was published in 1939. Although well-received, the final book showed important differences from the one initially envisioned by Abbott and McCausland, especially with respect to captions and sequencing. In 1949, her photography book &quot;Greenwich Village Today and Yesterday&quot; was published by Harper &amp; Brothers.

Ralph Steiner wrote in &quot;PM&quot; that Abbott&#x27;s work was &quot;the greatest collection of photographs of New York City ever made.&quot;

As the city and architecture are two main themes in Abbott&#x27;s photographs, her work has been commented on and reviewed together with the work of Eugène Atget and Amanda Bouchenoire, in the book &quot;Architecture and Cities. Three Photographic Gazes&quot;, where author Jerome Saltz analyzes historicist perspectives and considers their aesthetic implications: &quot;(...) the three authors coincide in the search for and exaltation of intrinsic beauty in their objectives, regardless of quality and clarity of their references.&quot;

==Beyond New York City==

In 1934, Henry-Russell Hitchcock asked Abbott to photograph two subjects: antebellum architecture and the architecture of H. H. Richardson. Two decades later, Abbott and McCausland traveled US 1 from Florida to Maine, where Abbott photographed small towns and growing automobile-related architecture. The project resulted in more than 2,500 negatives.

Shortly after the trip, Abbott underwent a lung operation. She was told she should move from New York City due to air pollution. She purchased a rundown home in Blanchard, Maine along the banks of the Piscataquis River for US$1,000. Later, she moved to nearby Monson and remained in Maine until her death in 1991. Most of her work is shown in the United States, but a number of photographs are shown in Europe.

Abbott&#x27;s last book was &quot;A Portrait of Maine&quot; (1968).

In 1943, Abbott was commissioned by Hudson D. Walker to photograph operations at the Red River Lumber Company in Westwood, California. Selections from her work in Westwood became part of a touring exhibition, &quot;Lumbering and Logging in the Pine Forest of California.&quot;

==Approach to photography==
Abbott was part of the straight photography movement, which stressed the importance of photographs being unmanipulated in both subject matter and developing processes. She also disliked the work of pictorialists who had become popular during a substantial span of her career, leaving her work without support from this school of photographers. Most of Abbott&#x27;s work was influenced by what she described as her unhappy and lonely childhood. This gave her the strength and determination to follow her dreams.

Throughout her career, Abbott&#x27;s photography was very much a reflection of the rise in development of technology and society. Her works documented and extolled the New York landscape. This was guided by her belief that a modern-day invention such as the camera deserved to document the 20th century.

==Scientific work==
In addition to her photography, Abbott co-founded a company, the &quot;House of Photography,&quot; which developed, promoted and sold photographic equipment and devices from 1947 to 1959. Abbott&#x27;s inventions included a distortion enlarging easel, which created unusual effects on images, and the telescopic lighting pole, known today by many studio photographers as an &quot;autopole&quot;, to which lights can be attached at any level. Owing to poor marketing, the House of Photography quickly lost money, and with the deaths of two designers, the company closed.

Abbott&#x27;s style of straight photography helped her make important contributions to scientific photography. She once stated, &quot;We live in a world made by science. There needs to be a friendly interpreter between science and the layman. I believe photography can be this spokesman, as no other form of expression can be.&quot;

From 1958 to 1960, she produced a series of photographs for a high-school physics textbook, developed by the Physical Science Study Committee project based at MIT to improve secondary school physics teaching. Her work included images of wave patterns in water and stroboscopic images of moving objects, such as &quot;Bouncing ball in diminishing arcs&quot;, which was featured on the cover of the textbook. She contributed to the understanding of physical laws and properties of solids and liquids though her studies of light and motion.

Between 1958 and 1961, she made a series of photographs for Educational Services Inc., which were later published. They were subsequently presented by the Smithsonian Institution in an exhibition titled &quot;Image of Physics&quot;. In 2012, some of her work from this era was displayed at the MIT Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Personal life==
The film &quot;Berenice Abbott: A View of the 20th Century,&quot; which showed 200 of her black and white photographs, suggests that she was a &quot;proud proto-feminist&quot;; someone who was ahead of her time in feminist theory. Before the film was completed she questioned, &quot;The world doesn&#x27;t like independent women, why, I don&#x27;t know, but I don&#x27;t care.&quot; 

She identified publicly as a lesbian.
She lived with her partner, art critic Elizabeth McCausland, for 30 years.

Abbott&#x27;s life and work are the subject of the 2017 novel &quot;The Realist: A Novel of Berenice Abbott&quot;, by Sarah Coleman.

The first comprehensive biography was published in 2018, &quot;Berenice Abbott: A Life in Photography&quot; by Julia Van Haaften (W. W. Norton); it was nominated for a PEN America award and a Lammy in biography, and excerpted in &quot;The Paris Review&quot; April 10, 2018.

<doc id="499410" wikidata="Q887756" url="?curid=499410" title="Admiralty Inlet">
<text>Admiralty Inlet is a strait in the U.S. state of Washington connecting the eastern end of the Strait of Juan de Fuca to Puget Sound. It lies between Whidbey Island and the northeastern part of the Olympic Peninsula.

==Boundaries==
It is generally considered to be the northern part of Puget Sound&#x27;s Main Basin. Its northern boundary is defined as a line running between Point Wilson and Point Partridge, and it extends south to the southern end of Whidbey Island and Point No Point on the Kitsap Peninsula, where it joins the Central Basin of Puget Sound&#x27;s Main Basin. Admiralty Inlet&#x27;s area is , with a volume of . Its shoreline is in length. Its mean depth is . Though only wide at the narrowest point (between the Point Wilson and Admiralty Head lighthouses), it is through this passage that nearly all the seawater flows into and from Puget Sound during daily tidal variations. Tidal currents can reach six knots in the area northeast of Point Wilson.

All sea vessels must pass through Admiralty Inlet to enter or leave Puget Sound, except those small enough to use Deception Pass or Swinomish Channel. This fact led to the selection of Port Townsend on the Quimper Peninsula as the official port of entry for the Puget Sound region during the early days of commerce in the area. It also led to the federal decision in the late 1890s to construct Fort Worden, Fort Casey, and Fort Flagler around Admiralty Inlet as a &quot;Triangle of Fire&quot; for the protection of Puget Sound from a hostile fleet.

The first Europeans to find and map Admiralty Inlet were the Spanish of the 1790 expedition of Manuel Quimper. It was Quimper&#x27;s pilot, Juan Carrasco, who sighted the inlet. Thinking it was a bay he named it &quot;Ensenada de Caamaño&quot;, after the Spanish naval officer Jacinto Caamaño. Two years later Admiralty Inlet was given its present name by George Vancouver, after his ultimate commanders, the Board of Admiralty. The Spanish name was later given to Camano Island.

==Present day==

Today a great deal of maritime freight traffic passes through Admiralty Inlet to the major shipping ports at Seattle and Tacoma, and of United States Navy vessels to the Naval facilities in Puget Sound. The Keystone-Port Townsend run of the Washington State Ferries crosses the inlet and serves as a link for State Route 20.

A tidal power project was canceled due to costs of monitoring wildlife.

<text>STS-43, the ninth mission for Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;, was a nine-day mission whose primary goal was launching the TDRS-E satellite (TDRS-5). The flight also tested an advanced heatpipe radiator for potential use on the then-future space station and conducted a variety of medical and materials science investigations.

== Crew ==
=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Preparations and launch ==

The launch took place on August 2, 1991 at 15:02:00UTC (11:02amEDT, local time at the launch site). Launch was originally set for July 23, 1991, but was moved to July 24 to allow time to replace a faulty integrated electronics assembly that controls orbiter/external tank separation. The mission was postponed again about five hours before liftoff on July 24, 1991, due to a faulty main engine controller on the number three main engine. The controller was replaced and retested; launch was reset for August 1, 1991. Liftoff set for 11:01 a.m. delayed due to cabin pressure vent valve reading and postponed at 12:28 p.m. due to unacceptable return-to-launch site weather conditions. Launch finally occurred on August 2, 1991, without further delays.

== Mission highlights ==

The primary payload, TDRS-E, attached to an Inertial Upper Stage (IUS), was deployed about six hours into flight, and the IUS propelled the satellite into geosynchronous orbit. TDRS-5 became the fourth member of the orbiting TDRS cluster. Secondary payloads were Space Station Heat Pipe Advanced Radiator Element (SHARE II); Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultra-Violet (SSBUV) instrument; Tank Pressure Control Equipment (TPCE) and Optical Communications Through Windows (OCTW). Other experiments included Auroral Photography Experiment (APE-B) Protein Crystal Growth Ill (PCG Ill); Bioserve / Instrumentation Technology Associates Materials Dispersion Apparatus (BIMDA); Investigations into Polymer Membrane Processing (IPMP); Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS); Solid Surface Combustion Experiment (SSCE); Ultraviolet Plume imager (UVPI); and the Air Force Maui Optical Site (AMOS) experiment.

TDRS-E, which became TDRS-5 on orbit, was successfully boosted to geosynchronous orbit at more than 22,000 miles () above Earth by two firings of the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) booster, the last of which occurred approximately 12½ hours into the mission. TDRS then deployed its antennas and solar panels, and separation from the IUS took place less than 45 minutes later.

The TDRS network of satellites provides the vital communication link between Earth and low-orbiting spacecraft such as the Space Shuttle. Until the STS-43 deployment, there were three TDRS spacecraft on orbit above the equator: two were in the west position over the Pacific Ocean, southwest of Hawaii. TDRS-4 was in the east position over the northeast corner of Brazil. TDRS-B was lost in the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident in 1986. After STS-43, the two satellites in the west became on-orbit spares; TDRS-5, after activation, checkout and calibration, officially became the primary provider of services in the west location on October 7, 1991. It was stationed at 175° west longitude.

Previously, orbiting spacecraft could communicate with Earth only when in sight of a ground tracking station – about 15 percent of each orbit. The TDRS network allows communication from 85% to 100% of an orbit, depending on the spacecraft&#x27;s altitude.

The crew was kept busy with the operation of varied experiments during the nine-day flight. The Space Station Heat Pipe Advanced Radiator Element (SHARE-II) experiment tested a natural cooling process for transferring thermal energy that could serve as a cooling system for Space Station Freedom. The Solid Surface Combustion Experiment (SSCE) provided some answers about how fire behaves in microgravity. The crew also activated other previously flown materials science experiments and participated in medical experiments in support of long-duration flights. One test showed that optical fibers could provide video and audio links between the flight deck and the payload bay.

Crew members in space and flight controllers on the ground demonstrated their ingenuity when they adapted a camera part to replace one that had not been packed for the mission.

The mission was also notable for being the first one to send an email from space. On August 9, 1991, astronauts Lucid and Adamson used AppleLink to write an email from a Macintosh Portable addressed to Marsha S. Ivins at Johnson Space Center. The message read:

The crew experienced some minor problems, none of them critical to the safety or success of the mission. A cooling system for Auxiliary Power Unit (APU 2) failed to activate during an on-orbit test. APU 2 is one of three redundant systems which provide hydraulic pressurization to orbiter steering systems during entry and landing. APU 2 was still available for use in landing.

&quot;Atlantis&quot; landed on August 11, 1991, at 8:23:25 a.m. EDT, on Runway 15, at Kennedy Space Center.

== Mission insignia ==
According to the mission&#x27;s official Press Kit, the STS-43 insignia portrays the evolution and continuity of the U.S. space program by highlighting thirty years of American crewed spaceflight experience, from Project Mercury to the Space Shuttle. The emergence of the shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; from the outlined configuration of the Mercury space capsule commemorates this special relationship. The energy and momentum of launch are conveyed by the gradations of blue which mark the shuttle&#x27;s ascent from Earth to space. Once in Earth orbit, &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; cargo bay opens to reveal the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) which appears in gold emphasis against the white wings of &quot;Atlantis&quot; and the stark blackness of space. As primary mission objective, the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) will enable almost continuous communication from Earth to space for future space shuttle missions. The stars on the insignia are arranged to suggest this mission&#x27;s numerical designation, with four stars left of &quot;Atlantis&quot; and three to the right.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<text>STS-48 was a Space Shuttle mission that launched on September 12, 1991, from Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The orbiter was on her 13th flight. The primary payload was the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS). The mission landed on September 18 at 12:38 a.m. EDT at Edwards Air Force Base on runway 22. The mission was completed in 81 revolutions of the Earth and traveled . The 5 astronauts carried out a number of experiments and deployed several satellites. The total launch mass was and the landing mass was .

Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; was launched into a 57.00° inclination orbit from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Launch Complex 39A at 7:11 p.m. EDT on September 12, 1991. Launch was delayed for 14 minutes at the T−5 minute mark due to a noise problem in the air-to-ground link. The noise cleared itself, and the countdown proceeded normally to launch.

On the third day of the mission, the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) was deployed from Discovery&#x27;s payload bay above Earth to study human effects on the planet&#x27;s atmosphere and its shielding ozone layer. The UARS mission objectives were to provide an increased understanding of the energy input into the upper atmosphere, global photochemistry of the upper atmosphere, dynamics of the upper atmosphere, the coupling among these processes, and the coupling between the upper and lower atmosphere. This provided data for a coordinated study of the structure, chemistry, energy balance, and physical action of the Earth&#x27;s middle atmosphere – that slice of air between and above the Earth. The UARS was the first major flight element of NASA&#x27;s Mission to Planet Earth, a multi-year global research program that would use ground-based, airborne, and space-based instruments to study the Earth as a complete environmental system. UARS had ten sensing and measuring devices: Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer (CLAES); Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder (ISAMS); Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS); Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE); High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI); Wind Imaging Interferometer (WlNDII); Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM); Solar/Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE); Particle Environment Monitor (PEM) and Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM II). UARS&#x27;s initial 18-month mission was extended several times – it was finally retired after 14 years of service.

Secondary payloads were: Ascent Particle Monitor (APM); Middeck 0-Gravity Dynamics Experiment (MODE); Shuttle Activation Monitor (SAM); Cosmic Ray Effects and Activation Monitor (CREAM); Physiological and Anatomical Rodent Experiment (PARE); Protein Crystal Growth (PCG II-2); Investigations into Polymer Membrane Processing (IPMP); and the Air Force Maui Optical Site (AMOS) experiment.

The flight was the first to test an electronic still camera in space, a modified Nikon NASA F4. Images obtained during the flight were monochrome with 8 bits of digital information per pixel (256 gray levels) and stored on a removable hard disk. The images could be viewed and enhanced on board using a modified lap-top computer before being transmitted to the ground via the orbiter digital downlinks.

STS-48 was the second post-&quot;Challenger&quot; mission to have Kennedy Space Center as the planned End-Of-Mission landing site, and the first mission to have a planned night landing at KSC. However, due to weather conditions at KSC in Florida, Discovery flew one extra orbit and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, at 3:38 a.m. EDT on September 18, 1991. The orbiter returned to KSC on September 26, 1991.

== Ice particles ==
Video while in orbit on September 15, 1991, shows a flash of light and several objects that appear to be flying in an artificial or controlled fashion. NASA explained the objects as ice particles reacting to engine jets. Philip C. Plait discussed the issue in his book &quot;Bad Astronomy&quot;, agreeing with NASA. This topic was also discussed in an episode of &quot;UFO Hunters&quot;.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<text>Legal aid is the provision of assistance to people who are unable to afford legal representation and access to the court system. Legal aid is regarded as central in providing access to justice by ensuring equality before the law, the right to counsel and the right to a fair trial. This article describes the development of legal aid and its principles, primarily as known in Europe, the Commonwealth of Nations and in the United States.

Legal aid is essential to guaranteeing equal access to justice for all, as provided for by Article 6.3 of the European Convention on Human Rights regarding criminal law cases and Article 6.1 of the same Convention both for civil and criminal cases. Especially for citizens who do not have sufficient financial means, the provision of legal aid to clients by governments increases the likelihood, within court proceedings, of being assisted by legal professionals for free or at a lower cost, or of receiving financial aid.

A number of delivery models for legal aid have emerged, including duty lawyers, community legal clinics, and the payment of lawyers to deal with cases for individuals who are entitled to legal aid. More informal or general legal advice and assistance may also be provided for free or at low cost through such means as law centres (UK), community legal centres (Australia) or a variety of other organisations which provide various forms of legal aid in and outside of court.

==History==
Legal aid has a close relationship with the welfare state, and the provision of legal aid by a state is influenced by attitudes towards welfare. Legal aid is a welfare provision by the state to people who could otherwise not afford counsel from the legal system. Legal aid also helps to ensure that welfare provisions are enforced by providing people entitled to welfare provisions, such as social housing, with access to legal advice and the courts.

Historically, legal aid has played a strong role in ensuring respect for economic, social and cultural rights which are engaged in relation to social security, housing, social care, health, and education service provision, which may be provided publicly or privately, as well as employment law and anti-discrimination legislation. Jurists such as Mauro Cappelletti argue that legal aid is essential in providing individuals with access to justice, by allowing the individual legal enforcement of economic, social and cultural rights. His views developed in the second half of the 20th century, when democracies with capitalist economies established liberal welfare states that focused on the individual. States acted as contractors and service providers within a market-based philosophy that emphasised the citizen as consumer. This led to an emphasis on individual enforcement to achieve the realisation of rights for all.

Prior to the mid-20th century, literature on legal aid emphasised collective enforcement of economic, social and cultural rights. As classic welfare states were built in the 1940s and following World War II, an underlying principle was that citizens had collective responsibility for economic, social and cultural rights; and the state assumed responsibility for those unable to provide for themselves through illness and unemployment. The enforcement of economic, social and cultural rights was to be collective, through policies rather than individual legal action. Laws were enacted to support welfare provisions, though these were regarded as laws for planners, not lawyers. Legal aid schemes were established, as it was assumed that the state had a responsibility to assist those engaged in legal disputes, but they initially focused primarily on family law and divorce.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the role of the welfare state changed, and social goals were no longer assumed to be common goals. Individuals were free to pursue their own goals. The welfare state in this time expanded, along with legal aid provisions, as concerns emerged over the power of welfare providers and professionals. In the 1960s and 1970s, demand rose for the right of individuals to legally enforce economic, social and cultural rights and the welfare provisions they as individuals were entitled to. Mechanisms emerged through which citizens could legally enforce their economic, social, and cultural rights, and welfare lawyers used legal aid to advise those on low income when dealing with state officials. Legal aid was extended from family law to a wide range of economic, social, and cultural rights.

In the 1980s, the role of the classic welfare state was no longer regarded as necessarily positive, and welfare was increasingly provided by private entities. Legal aid was increasingly provided through private providers, but they remained focused on providing assistance in court cases. Citizens were increasingly regarded as consumers, who should be able to choose among services. Where it was not possible to provide such a choice, citizens were given the right to voice their dissatisfaction through administrative complaints processes. This resulted in tension, as legal aid was not designed to offer advice to those seeking redress through administrative complaints processes. Tensions also began to emerge as states which emphasised individual enforcement of economic, social, and cultural rights, rather than collective enforcement through policies, reduced funding for legal aid as a welfare state provision. Individual enforcement of welfare entitlement requires the kind of legal aid funding states emphasising collective enforcement were more likely to provide.

==Legal aid movements==
Historically legal aid has its roots in the right to counsel and right to a fair trial movement of the 19th-century continental European countries. &quot;Poor man&#x27;s laws&quot; waived court fees for the poor and provided for the appointment of duty solicitors for those who could not afford to pay for a solicitor. Initially the expectation was that duty solicitors would act on a &quot;pro bono&quot; basis. In the early 20th century, many European countries had no formal approach to legal aid, and the poor relied on the charity of lawyers. Most countries went on to establish laws that provided for the payment of a moderate fee to duty solicitors. To curb demand, legal aid was restricted to lawyer costs in judicial proceedings requiring a lawyer. Countries with a civil law legal system and common law legal systems take different approaches to the right to counsel in civil and criminal proceedings. Civil law countries are more likely to emphasise the right to counsel in civil proceedings, and therefore provide legal aid where a lawyer is required. Common law countries emphasise the right to counsel and provide legal aid primarily in relation to criminal proceedings.

In response to rapid industrialisation in the late 19th-century Europe, trade union and workers&#x27; parties emerged that challenged the social policies of governments. They gained passage of laws to provide workers with legal rights in the event of illness or accidents, in an attempt to prevent industrial action by industrial workers. Workers unions in turn started to provide workers with legal advice on their new economic, social and cultural rights. Demand for these services was high and in an attempt to provide workers with non-partisan advice, many governments started to provide legal aid by the early 20th century.

==Recent times==
In the 20th century, legal aid developed together with progressive principles; it has often been supported by those members of the legal profession who felt that it was their responsibility to care for those on low income. Legal aid became driven by what lawyers could offer to meet the &quot;legal needs&quot; of those they have identified as poor, marginalised or discriminated against. According to Francis Regan in 1999, legal aid provision is supply driven, not demand driven, leading to wide gaps between provisions that meet perceived needs and actual demand. Legal service initiatives, such as neighbourhood mediation and legal services, frequently have to close due to lack of demand, while others are overwhelmed with clients.

Though legal aid aims to create more equity in the sphere of legal practices, according to a 1985 article, aid offered is often limited in its quality or its social impact by economic constraints that dictate who can access these services and where the aforementioned services are geographically located.

Pro bono legal aid has been criticized for being politicized, and for being mandatory volunteering in some cases.

==By country==
===Asia===
Most developmental legal aid services are provided by grassroots organizations, human rights-based non-governmental organizations (NGOs), or are stipulated by constitutional laws by some Asian governments.

====Hong Kong====
A unitary jurisdiction, Hong Kong provides legal aid solely provided through the Legal Aid Department, which is in turn overseen by the Legal Aid Services Council.

Administratively the Legal Aid Department was under the Administration Wing of the Chief Secretary&#x27;s Office. In 2007, it was moved to the Home Affairs Bureau, which chiefly oversees cultural matters and local administration. This was heavily criticized by the opposition pro-democracy camp for jeopardising neutrality of the provision of legal aid. They voted en bloc against the whole package of reorganisation of policy bureaus, of which the transfer of the Legal Aid Department was part.

====India====
Article 39A of the Constitution of India, provides for equal justice and free legal aid:
The State shall secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice, on a basis of equal opportunity, and shall, in particular, provide free legal aid, by suitable legislation or schemes or in any other way, to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities.
This Article emphasises that free legal service is an inalienable element of &#x27;reasonable, fair and just&#x27; procedure, for without it a person suffering from economic or other disabilities would be deprived of the opportunity for securing justice.

In the civil side, Order XXXIII. R.18 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 provided that the state and central governments may make supplementary provisions as it thinks fit for providing free legal services to those who have been permitted to sue as an indigent person. The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 made drastic changes in the field of legal services. It is an Act to constitute legal services authorities to provide free and competent legal services to the weaker sections of the society to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities, and to organize Lok Adalats to secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice on a basis of equal opportunity.

====Pakistan====
The legal system of Pakistan supported legal aid programme it provides Government funded legal assistance in the circumstances to those litigants or person in jail who are unable to afford or manage a lawyer. In some cases, Legal Aid involves NGO role whereas government is bound to provide lawyer to the accousd. The Legal aid is available for almost in all courts across the court. It&#x27;s open to litigants who are able to meet the rigorous eligibility requirements including criminal charges, civil issues, family disputes, appeals and Tribunal claims etc.

====Philippines====
Developmental legal assistance or developmental legal aid, as it is often called in the Philippines, has come a long way since the Marcos dictatorship. During martial law, the father of human rights Sen. Jose W. Diokno was sent to prison when Ferdinand Marcos arrested all political dissidents. Once Diokno was released 718 days later, the attorney and former senator founded the Free Legal Assistance Group, the oldest and largest human rights firm since 1974. It was through FLAG&#x27;s innovative use of developmental legal aid, which included pro-bono legal service as well as free allowances to clients who were financially incapacitated, that free legal service became standard practice in the country. Later on, laws were introduced that would require newly licensed barristers to give free legal service to the poor for a stipulated and fixed duration of time. The most famous law on developmental legal aid is called the Community Legal Aid Service (CLAS) Rule. The CLAS Rule applies to lawyers who are in their first year of practice. Many developmental legal services are provided by most law firms and NGOs in the Philippines.

In 2019 FLAG freely represented Time Person of the Year Maria Ressa during her libel case against the 16th president, Rodrigo Duterte, as it was her exposés on Duterte&#x27;s &quot;War on Drugs&quot; that have sparked worldwide debates on the potential legal repercussions of Duterte&#x27;s actions.

In 2020, Duterte created a new law called the Anti-Terror Law, which would arrest any dissident due to loose definitions in the law on who might be marked as &quot;terrorists&quot;. This has incited protests from the masses as well as from FLAG chairman Atty. Jose Manuel &quot;Chel&quot; Diokno. FLAG, alongside fellow columnists, statesmen, and political detainees responded with issuing the legal challenge G.R. No. 252741 against Duterte&#x27;s Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea on the grounds and rationality of the law. Among the provisions that is being questioned is Section 29 on detention without judicial warrant of arrest in which a suspect can be arrested even without a warrant of arrest and detained for up to 24 days, which echoed back to the days of martial law under Marcos that allowed the proliferation of developmental legal aid in the first place.

===Europe===
Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides that legal aid will be made available to those who lack sufficient resources, in so far as such aid is necessary to ensure effective access to justice.

====Central and Eastern Europe, and Russia====
According to PILnet: the Global Network for Public Interest Law, 
for over a decade, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and Russia have been in the process of reforming and restructuring their legal systems. While many critical justice sector reforms have been undertaken throughout the region, the mechanisms to ensure individuals&#x27; access to legal information and assistance often remain inadequate and ineffective. Consequently, many people—especially those who are poor or otherwise disadvantaged—are left without any real access to legal counsel in both criminal and non-criminal matters.

In the Czech Republic, qualifying persons (usually those who evidence inadequacy of funds) can apply to the courts or the Czech Bar Association to have an attorney appointed to them.

====Denmark====
In Denmark, applicants must satisfy the following criteria to receive legal aid for civil cases: The applicant must not earn more than kr. 289,000 ($50,000) a year and the claims of the party must seem reasonable. In respect to criminal cases, the convicted will only have to cover the costs if he or she has a considerable fixed income – this is to prevent recidivism.

====Germany====

In civil cases including employment, administrative, constitutional, and social cases, assistance under the Legal Advice Scheme Act (in the form of advice and, where necessary, representation) is given. In criminal cases, the defendant has a right to counsel, and in certain cases when the penalty is at least one year of confinement, the defendant can be given counsel even against his or her wishes.

====Italy====
Known as &quot;Patrocinio a spese dello Stato,&quot; legal aid is provided by the Italian Law DPR n. 115/2002 – Articles. 74–141. It is intended to implement Article 24 of the Italian Constitution and ensure access to the right of defense (in civil, administrative and criminal cases) to persons not able to independently obtain the services of a lawyer due to the inability to pay for them from their income (less than €10,776.33 per capita).

The Constitution of the Italian Republic, Clause 24 states: 
Everyone is allowed to take legal action for the protection of her/his rights and legitimate interests. Defence is an inviolable right at any grade of the proceedings. The means of action and defence before all Courts are guaranteed to the indigent by public institutions. The law determines the conditions and legal means to remedy miscarriages of justice.

Legal aid in Italy is a service to allow everyone to be assisted by a lawyer or by an expert witness free of any legal fees or costs in all criminal, civil, administrative, accounting or fiscal proceeding and &quot;voluntary jurisdiction&quot; and whenever the presence of a lawyer or expert witness is required by law. Legal aid is granted for all grades or stages of the trial, including all further connected incidental and contingent proceedings. It is granted before Tribunals, Courts of Appeal, the Supreme Court, surveillance courts and judges, Regional Administrative Tribunals, Judicial Review Committees, Provincial and Regional Fiscal Commissions and the State Auditors&#x27; Court.

====United Kingdom====
=====England and Wales=====
======Introduction======
Legal aid was originally established by the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1949. In 2009, legal aid in England and Wales cost the taxpayer £2bn a year – a higher per capita spend than anywhere else in the world – and was available to around 29% of adults. However, availability and level of provision of legal aid have greatly decreased since 2012 as a result of austerity measures in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012.

Legal aid in England and Wales is administered by the Legal Aid Agency (until 31 March 2013 by the Legal Services Commission), and is available for most criminal cases, and many types of civil cases. Exceptions include libel, most personal injury cases (which are now dealt with under Conditional Fee Agreements, a species of contingent fee), and corporate cases. Family cases are also sometimes covered. Depending on the type of case, legal aid may or may not be means tested and in some cases legal aid can be free to those on benefits, out of work and have no savings or assets.

Criminal legal aid is generally provided through private firms of solicitors and barristers in private practice. A limited number of public defenders are directly employed by the Legal Aid Agency in &quot;Public Defender Service&quot; offices; they provide advice in police stations and advocacy in magistrates and crown courts. Civil legal aid is provided through solicitors and barristers in private practice but also by lawyers working in Law Centres and not-for-profit advice agencies.

======LASPO======
The provision of legal aid is governed by the Access to Justice Act 1999 and supplementary legislation, most recently the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO), which came into force in 2013. LASPO triggered an immediate 46% plunge in the number of cases in which legal aid was granted, from 925,000 in 2012 to just 497,000 cases in the following year. The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO) stopped aid for areas of law that include family, welfare, housing, and debt. There are complaints that cuts to legal aid from LASPO have prevented the poorest people getting justice.

Disabled people disputing benefit claims are usually denied legal aid forcing them to deal with complex and distressing cases without help. The numbers disputing when benefits are denied have fallen drastically and it is feared the most vulnerable are losing out.

The government&#x27;s rationale for introducing LASPO was because people who could clearly afford their own legal fees were abusing the system, and cases which could clearly be settled with alternative dispute resolution were unnecessarily being taken to court. This can be seen in the government&#x27;s response to legal aid reforms in 2011, where Kenneth Clarke, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, said funding was being provided for &quot;unnecessary litigation&quot;, something which he viewed as &quot;unaffordable&quot; and &quot;spiralling legal costs&quot;. He also noted that before the introduction of LASPO, England and Wales were spending £39 per head of the population on legal aid compared with only £8 per head in New Zealand. Experts maintain the burden of cost has just been transferred to the courts, NHS and social care, which in the end costs the state more.

======The effects of LASPO on legal aid in England and Wales======
Supreme Court justice Lord Wilson of Culworth fears the effectiveness of legal aid is being reduced. Wilson said cuts to legal aid prevent the disadvantaged from exercising their human rights. He also says that even in areas were legal aid is allowed, the payment to lawyers is so low that many of them stop providing legal aid. The Law Society maintains restrictions to legal aid are preventing defendants getting a fair trial.

BBC analysis found up to a million people are in areas without legal aid for housing, and 15 million are in areas with one provider. Liberty maintained ability to get justice had been &quot;significantly undermined&quot;. There were roughly 1,000 fewer civil legal aid providers in 2018 since 2011–12, with most of the providers being based in London. Richard Miller of the Law society said it can be very difficult to find legal aid providers willing to take on a case. Lord Dyson said this has led to vulnerable people representing themselves in court, with many defendants paying towards their defence (sometimes nearly as expensive as paying for a private lawyer).

Furthermore, Ben Tovey says he has to turn away people from legal aid every day.

Law centres have also closed due to funding cuts adding to the problems of people needing legal aid. Nimrod Ben-Cnaan of the Law Centres Network, maintained the legal aid market was, &quot;failing&quot; since cuts, &quot;shattered local ecologies of advice,&quot; and that it is vital law centres are rebuilt. Malcolm Richardson, retired magistrate said legal advisers must increasingly guide litigant in person through court proceedings. He said, &quot;It puts all the judiciary in a difficult position but also burdens the whole court system.&quot;

Tom McNally said, &quot;If we really wanted to make substantial reforms to the criminal justice system, it was almost impossible with the continuation of austerity.&quot; Litigants in person do not know what evidence to bring or what questions to ask. During divorce and separation cases far fewer couples take up mediation. Without lawyers no one is around to point out less confrontational ways of settling matters. Philip Alston said that legal aid had become considerably less available in England and Wales from 2012, which had, &quot;overwhelmingly affected the poor and people with disabilities, many of whom cannot otherwise afford to challenge benefit denials or reductions and are thus effectively deprived of their human rights to a remedy&quot;.

LASPO has also had an impact on legal aid providers, who say they are &quot;dismay[ed] at...such deep and arbitrary cuts&quot; to legal aid. There have been 37 legal aid providers which have collapsed since April 2020, which is more than 70 offices. This has caused barristers who offer legal aid to feel their role has been &quot;driven to extinction&quot; due to job losses. For example, in Exeter there are now no legal aid providers for immigration or asylum, with the closest provider being away (Plymouth) from the city centre. It has been revealed that these providers receive a median net annual income of £27,000, which is less than the starting salary for a graduate manager at Aldi. The Law Society believe that this level of pay should be made fairer. Whilst legal aid lawyers are funded by the legal aid agency, it can sometimes take years for payments to come through to them. This is due to cashflow problems with the legal aid agency, something the Law Society is pushing for guidance and clarification from.

=====Scotland=====
Legal aid is in principle available for all civil actions in the Court of Session and Sheriff Court in Scotland, with the significant exception of actions of defamation. It is also available for some statutory tribunals, such as the Immigration Appeal Adjudicator and the Social Security Commissioners. There is a separate system of criminal legal aid, and legal aid is also available for legal advice.

Legal aid is means-tested. In practice it is available only to less than one-quarter of the population. It is administered by the Scottish Legal Aid Board. Legal Aid in Scotland is also available in Criminal Cases, where more than 90% of Summary applications are granted. An Interests of Justice test is applied, as well as a means test. In Solemn case (Jury Trials) the Court assesses Legal Aid.

===Africa===
==== South Africa ====
South Africa is a country that has reconstructed its legal systems in an attempt to mimic Western democratic countries, creating an arguably more just and fair justice system.

South Africa has a national judiciary as well as, in some areas, a tribal form of administration of justice. This is described as &quot;legal pluralism&quot;. The informal &quot;indigenous laws&quot; are substantially different from the rest of the nation&#x27;s laws and customs, hindering the provision of legal advice. However, the indigenous justice system in South Africa does not require representation, thus essentially eliminating the need for accessible legal aid.

Mimicking the British legal system, South Africa has barristers, which work in the senior courts, and solicitors, which provide out-of-court advice and work in the lower courts.

In 1969 the government of South Africa recognized a need for legal aid, and responded by creating the South African Legal Aid Board which began its work in 1971 and now provides the majority of legal aid throughout the country. The Board has autonomy and is independent from government in its decision-making, and has sole jurisdiction over determining the provision of legal aid. The Board provides legal aid to all &quot;qualifying indigent individuals&quot; with an income of R600.00 or less. If individuals do not meet this qualification they are provided other methods of obtaining a lawyer, such as hiring one or, if this is not within their means, finding one who will work &quot;pro bono&quot;.

In a reflection of the history of apartheid in South Africa, nearly 85% of all lawyers in South Africa are white. The government has determined greater racial diversity in the field of law is a priority and there are travelling &quot;clinics&quot; to help provide education on South African law throughout the country, with the aim of spreading knowledge as wide as possible, though especially in poorer areas.

More than 80% of the Legal Aid Board&#x27;s funding is directed towards provision of defence advocates in criminal cases. This is generally explained in South Africa as being the result of two causes: the majority of crimes being committed by those who are poor, and the provision of defence in criminal cases being a priority compared to civil suits. Prior to the enactment of the 1994 Constitution, 80% of all people tried as criminals went unrepresented, as there was no right to a defence and no obligation on the government to provide that defence. Upon adoption of the 1994 Constitution the South African government was obliged to create organizations such as the Legal Aid Board to help facilitate access to legal aid.

For those who seek assistance and are aware of their own role in the justice system, legal aid in South Africa is available through:

*Uncompensated private counsel (pro bono work)
*Candidate attorneys in rural law firms funded by the state
*Private counsel funded by the state (judiciary)
*Independent university law clinics
*State funded law clinics
*State funded justice centers (one stop legal aid centers)
*Private specialist law firms
*Paralegal advice offices
*Legal insurance schemes

All of these services exist and are protected by subsidies and incentives. However, these services have been open to criticism, with some saying that these extensive services that are unique to South Africa do not matter if there is no adequate education that these options are available to people. In response, the South African government has encouraged South African law schools to expand their reach and establish travelling &quot;legal clinics&quot; and encouraging schools to add a &quot;legal literacy curriculum&quot; to spread knowledge of this area.

==== Nigeria ====
Legal Aid Council, Nigeria was established to provide legal services and access to justice to poor and marginalized Nigerians whose rights have been breached and who cannot afford the services of legal practitioners or who do not have the financial means to seek redress through the judicial system. The council is a government agency under the supervision of the Nigerian Ministry of Justice. The council was set up through Decree 56 of 1976, and was adopted into the 1979 constitution as Section 42 (40)(b). It was amended to Legal Aid (Amendment) Decree No.10 of 1986, to add civil matters to the council&#x27;s jurisdiction. This was further amended to Decree 22 of 1994 to include damages for breach of fundamental human rights as guaranteed under the 1979 Constitution; The Decree was later codified into the Legal Aid Council Act Cap L9 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004 and the Legal Aid Act Cap L9, 2004 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria (LFN), and all these amendments were consolidated in the 2011 Legal Aid Act.

The main objective of the constitutional amendments was to enhance access to justice for as many as seek redress by expanding the scope of free legal advice, assistance, representation and to provide Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as a means of speedy pathway to getting justice. The mandate of the Council covers legal representation for indigent Nigerians in case of murder of any degree, manslaughter, malicious or grievous hurt, common assault or assault with bodily harm, affray, stealing, rape and armed robbery. The Council mostly assists persons whose earning is below the national minimum wage although exceptions can be made in rare instances. It also provides free legal services to those in custodial centres.

The council had initiated the Police Duty Solicitors Scheme (PDSS) in 2004 in partnership with the Open Society for Justice Initiative (OSJI) and the Nigeria Police Force to curtail long excessive pretrial detention and associated human rights abuses by providing free legal advice to suspects. The council has also led the charge in the certification of curriculum for Paralegal Studies in Tertiary Institutions in Nigeria.

The council has a governing board which is made up of 15 members who are appointed by the President and drawn from the office of the Attorney General of the Federation, the Federal Ministry of Finance, the Inspector General of Police, the National Youth Service Corp, Nigeria Correctional Service, Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA) and the Nigerian Bar Association.

The Council formulates policies while the management committee headed by the Director-General is in charge of the day-to-day operation of the organization. It works mainly through 7 departments headed by Directors namely; Criminal Justice, Civil Justice, Prison Decongestion, Human Resource Management, Finance and Accounts, International Operations and Corporate Affairs and Planning, Research and Statistics departments. The council has offices in all the 36 States of Nigeria and the Federal capital territory headed by State coordinators who report to the zonal officers in the 6 geopolitical of the country.

===North America===
====Canada====
In Canada, the modern system of legal aid developed after the federal government instituted a system of cost-sharing between the federal and provincial governments in the early 1970s. The federal financial contribution was originally set at 50% of the cost of the legal aid system, but that level of funding has fluctuated over the years.

The actual delivery of legal aid is by the provincial level of government, as part of provincial jurisdiction over the administration of justice. For example, Legal Aid Ontario provides legal services for residents of Ontario, the Legal Services Society provides it to residents of British Columbia, and Commission des Services Juridiques does the same in the province of Quebec.

====United States====

Legal aid in criminal cases is a universal right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. A number of delivery models for legal aid have emerged in the United States. The Legal Services Corporation was authorized at the federal level to oversee these programs. In a &quot;staff attorney&quot; model, lawyers are employed by levels of government on salary solely to provide legal assistance to qualifying low-income clients, similar to staff doctors in a public hospital. In a &quot;judicare&quot; model, private lawyers and law firms are paid to handle cases from eligible clients alongside cases from fee-paying clients, much like doctors are paid to handle Medicare patients in the U.S. The &quot;community legal clinic&quot; model comprises non-profit clinics serving a particular community through a broad range of legal services (e.g. representation, education, law reform) and provided by both lawyers and non-lawyers, similar to community health clinics.

Defendants under criminal prosecution who cannot afford to hire an attorney are not only guaranteed legal aid related to the charges, but they are guaranteed legal representation, either in the form of public defenders, or in absence of provisions for such or due to case overloads, a court-appointed attorney.

The discussion surrounding legal aid and who is privileged to such a service has been criticized by law academics who assert that those who dominate and write the narratives of people who seek legal aid are individuals who benefit from the client narrative being one of inescapable poverty and desperation of an individual. Critiques assert that these asymmetrical, schematically constructed client profiles are required of civic legal aid programs in the capitalist framework of the United States as a tool to appeal to donors and other sources of funding. These representations and assessments of who seeks and deserves legal aid are argued to contribute to a culture of blaming the victims of poverty, as the narratives exclude the role the state and other civic stakeholders play in the creation of these client circumstances.
However, legal aid is not provided in civil suits, nor deportation procedures, as these are not criminal proceedings. Some cities and a few states have passed tenant right to counsel, which provides legal representation and aid for tenants facing eviction.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
Australia has a federal system of government comprising federal, state and territory jurisdictions. The Australian (Commonwealth) and state and territory governments are each responsible for the provision of legal aid for matters arising under their laws. In addition there is a network of approximately 200 independent, not for profit, community legal centres.

Legal aid for both Commonwealth and state matters is primarily delivered through state and territory legal aid commissions (LACs), which are independent statutory agencies established under state and territory legislation. The Australian Government funds the provision of legal aid for Commonwealth family, civil and criminal law matters under agreements with state and territory governments and LACs. The majority of Commonwealth matters fall within the family law jurisdiction.

Legal aid commissions use a mixed model to deliver legal representation services. A grant of assistance legal representation may be assigned to either a salaried in-house lawyer or referred to a private legal practitioner. The mixed model is particularly advantageous for providing services to clients in regional areas and in cases where a conflict of interest means the same lawyer cannot represent both parties.

The Australian Government and most state and territory governments also fund community legal centres, which are independent, non-profit organisations which provide referral, advice and assistance to people with legal problems. Additionally, the Australian Government funds financial assistance for legal services under certain statutory schemes and legal services for Indigenous Australians.

By way of history, the Australian Government established the Legal Services Bureaux in 1942 to develop a national system. In 1973 the Attorney-General in the Whitlam Labor government, Lionel Murphy, established the Australian Legal Aid Office. Murphy recognised the urgent need for legal aid in order for justice to be equally available for all. Murphy recognised that: &quot;one of the basic causes of the inequality of citizens before the laws is the absence of adequate and comprehensive legal aid arrangements throughout Australia ... The ultimate object of the Government is that legal aid be readily and equally available to citizens everywhere in Australia and that aid be extended for advice and assistance of litigation as well as for litigation in all legal categories and in all courts.&quot; (Senator the Hon Lionel Murphy AO QC, Attorney General) The establishment of the Australian Legal Aid Office in 1973 was followed by the establishment of state-based Legal Aid Commissions. These offices now provide the majority of free or lowcost legal assistance to those in need. In 1977, the Australian Government enacted the &quot;Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Act 1977&quot; (LAC Act), which established cooperative arrangements between the Australian Government and state and territory governments, under which legal aid would be provided by independent legal aid commissions to be established under state and territory legislation. The process of establishing the LACs took more than a decade. It commenced in 1976 with the establishment of the Legal Aid Commission of Western Australia, followed in 1978 the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria (LACV), and ended in 1990 with the establishment of the Legal Aid Commission of Tasmania. The cooperative arrangements that were established by the LAC Act provided for Commonwealth and state and territory legal aid funding agreements, which began in 1987.

In July 1997, the Australian Government changed its arrangements to directly fund legal aid services for Commonwealth law matters. Under this arrangement, the states and territories fund assistance in respect of their own laws. In 2013, a murder trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria was delayed because legal aid was unavailable. This has been cited as the effect of a reduction in government-funding for legal aid agencies in Australia and led to an increase in popularity for online legal aid resources such as the Law Handbook and LawAnswers.

Legal aid in Australia was discussed in the case of &quot;Dietrich v The Queen&quot; (1992). It was found that although there is no absolute right to have publicly funded counsel, in most circumstances a judge should grant any request for an adjournment or stay when an accused is unrepresented.

==== New Zealand ====

The legal aid system in New Zealand provides Government-funded legal assistance in limited circumstances to those who are unable to afford a lawyer. In most cases, Legal Aid takes the form of a loan which defendants must repay. Legal aid is available for almost all court actions across all levels of the court system for those who are able to meet the rigorous eligibility requirements. This includes criminal charges, civil issues, family disputes, appeals and Waitangi Tribunal claims.

<text>Giacomo Antonio Perti (6 June 1661 – 10 April 1756) was an Italian composer of the Baroque era. He was mainly active at Bologna, where he was &quot;Maestro di Cappella&quot; for sixty years. He was the teacher of Giuseppe Torelli and Giovanni Battista Martini.

==Life==
He was born in Bologna, then part of the Papal States, and began studying music early, learning harpsichord and violin there; later he studied counterpoint. By the age of 17, he had already written a mass, a motet, and a setting of the Magnificat; and in 1678 he wrote his first opera and oratorio. During a stay in Parma, where he studied with Giuseppe Corsi da Celano, he formed his sacred music style; most of his psalm settings of the 1680s and 1690s show the influence of Corsi. Later he went to Venice, most likely for a production of one of his operas.

In 1690 he was appointed to the post of &quot;Maestro di Cappella&quot; at S Pietro, replacing his uncle Lorenzo Perti. In 1696 he became &quot;Maestro di Cappella&quot; in another Bolognese church, S. Petronio, after the death of Giovanni Paolo Colonna the year before. He remained in charge for exactly sixty years, until his death at age 95.

Perti was a prolific composer of operas and sacred music, and was recognized as a distinguished musician not only by other composers but also by aristocrats and emperors, including Ferdinando de&#x27; Medici (one of the last of the Medici) and Emperors Leopold I and Charles VI.

==Works==
Perti was highly regarded for his sacred music and his operas. Of the 26 operas he composed, few remain today. Perti maintained in his Op. 1 that he was influenced by the melodic style of Francesco Cavalli, Antonio Cesti, and Luigi Rossi; however, he shows considerable originality in instrumentation, use of dialogue and countermelody. His output of sacred music was even more remarkable: he wrote 120 psalm settings, for one voice, chorus, basso continuo, and various other instruments; 54 motets, for similar forces; 28 masses; 83 &quot;versetti&quot; and other liturgical works.

He also wrote secular music, including 142 solo cantatas (one of the commonest secular vocal forms in late 17th century Italy), and some instrumental music including sonatas and sinfonias for a variety of instruments.

<doc id="499426" wikidata="Q114880294" url="?curid=499426" title="List of municipalities in Vermont">
<text>The U.S. state of Vermont is divided into 247 municipalities, including 237 towns and 10 cities. Vermont also has nine unincorporated areas, split between five unincorporated towns and four gores. As of 2024, Vermont has 30 incorporated villages, which are municipal governments operating within a town and providing additional services.

== Definitions and further information ==
Cities in Vermont are municipalities with the city form of government. Vermont has ten cities with a combined area of , or 0.8% of the state&#x27;s total area.

According to the 2020 census, 119,299 people, or 18.54% of the state&#x27;s population, resided in Vermont&#x27;s cities (excluding Essex Junction, which incorporated in 2022). Six of Vermont&#x27;s 14 counties have at least one city within their borders. Five cities serve as the county seats for their respective counties and are indicated below with an asterisk (*).

Towns in Vermont are municipalities that typically incorporate the town meeting format into their government

In some cases, a town and city have the same name, such as Barre City which is almost entirely surrounded by the separate municipality of Barre Town.

== List of municipalities ==

== Unincorporated areas ==
Unincorporated towns in Vermont are towns that had their charters revoked by the Vermont legislature or never formally organized due to lack of residents. Towns in name only, their affairs are managed by a state-appointed supervisor and not by a local government.

Gores in Vermont are seen as an unincorporated area of a county that is not part of any town, has limited self-government, and may be unpopulated. Vermont has four current gores.
== Villages ==

In the U.S. state of Vermont, villages are named communities located within the boundaries of a town. Villages may be incorporated or unincorporated.

An incorporated village is a defined area within a town that was either granted a village charter by a special act of the legislature, or organized under the general legislation. A village which has been incorporated is a clearly defined municipality and provides a variety of municipal services, such as potable water, sewage, police and fire services, garbage collection, street lighting and maintenance, management of cemeteries, and building code enforcement. Other municipal services not provided by the village are provided by the parent town. Incorporated villages in Vermont are administratively similar to villages in New York. Vermont is the only state in New England that has incorporated villages.

As of 2024, there are 30 incorporated villages with active governments in Vermont. Historically, there were more but most have since disincorporated, while others were chartered as cities. Below is a list of incorporated villages that have existed, ordered by date of incorporation. Extant villages are bolded.

<doc id="499429" wikidata="Q753007" url="?curid=499429" title="D'Alembert's principle">
<text>D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle, also known as the Lagrange–d&#x27;Alembert principle, is a statement of the fundamental classical laws of motion. It is named after its discoverer, the French physicist and mathematician Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert, and Italian-French mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange. D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle generalizes the principle of virtual work from static to dynamical systems by introducing &quot;forces of inertia&quot; which, when added to the applied forces in a system, result in &quot;dynamic equilibrium&quot;.

D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle can be applied in cases of kinematic constraints that depend on velocities. The principle does not apply for irreversible displacements, such as sliding friction, and more general specification of the irreversibility is required.

==Statement of the principle==
The principle states that the sum of the differences between the forces acting on a system of massive particles and the time derivatives of the momenta of the system itself projected onto any virtual displacement consistent with the constraints of the system is zero. Thus, in mathematical notation, d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle is written as follows,
formula_1

where:
* formula_2 is an integer used to indicate (via subscript) a variable corresponding to a particular particle in the system,
* formula_3 is the total applied force (excluding constraint forces) on the formula_2-th particle,
* formula_5 is the mass of the formula_2-th particle,
* formula_7 is the velocity of the formula_2-th particle,
* formula_9 is the virtual displacement of the formula_2-th particle, consistent with the constraints.

Newton&#x27;s dot notation is used to represent the derivative with respect to time. The above equation is often called d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle, but it was first written in this variational form by Joseph Louis Lagrange. D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s contribution was to demonstrate that in the totality of a dynamic system the forces of constraint vanish. That is to say that the generalized forces formula_11 need not include constraint forces. It is equivalent to the somewhat more cumbersome Gauss&#x27;s principle of least constraint.

==Derivations==

=== General case with variable mass ===
The general statement of d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle mentions &quot;the time derivatives of the momenta of the system.&quot; By Newton&#x27;s second law, the first time derivative of momentum is the force. The momentum of the formula_2-th mass is the product of its mass and velocity:
formula_13
and its time derivative is
formula_14

In many applications, the masses are constant and this equation reduces to
formula_15

However, some applications involve changing masses (for example, chains being rolled up or being unrolled) and in those cases both terms formula_16 and formula_17 have to remain present, giving
formula_18

===Special case with constant mass===
Consider Newton&#x27;s law for a system of particles of constant mass, formula_2. The total force on each particle is
formula_20
where
* formula_21 are the total forces acting on the system&#x27;s particles,
* formula_22 are the inertial forces that result from the total forces.

Moving the inertial forces to the left gives an expression that can be considered to represent quasi-static equilibrium, but which is really just a small algebraic manipulation of Newton&#x27;s law:
formula_23

Considering the virtual work, formula_24, done by the total and inertial forces together through an arbitrary virtual displacement, formula_9, of the system leads to a zero identity, since the forces involved sum to zero for each particle.

formula_26

The original vector equation could be recovered by recognizing that the work expression must hold for arbitrary displacements. Separating the total forces into applied forces, formula_27, and constraint forces, formula_28, yields
formula_29

If arbitrary virtual displacements are assumed to be in directions that are orthogonal to the constraint forces (which is not usually the case, so this derivation works only for special cases), the constraint forces don&#x27;t do any work, formula_30. Such displacements are said to be &quot;consistent&quot; with the constraints. This leads to the formulation of &quot;d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle&quot;, which states that the difference of applied forces and inertial forces for a dynamic system does no virtual work:
formula_31

There is also a corresponding principle for static systems called the principle of virtual work for applied forces.

==D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle of inertial forces==
D&#x27;Alembert showed that one can transform an accelerating rigid body into an equivalent static system by adding the so-called &quot;inertial force&quot; and &quot;inertial torque&quot; or moment. The inertial force must act through the center of mass and the inertial torque can act anywhere. The system can then be analyzed exactly as a static system subjected to this &quot;inertial force and moment&quot; and the external forces. The advantage is that in the equivalent static system one can take moments about any point (not just the center of mass). This often leads to simpler calculations because any force (in turn) can be eliminated from the moment equations by choosing the appropriate point about which to apply the moment equation (sum of moments = zero). Even in the course of Fundamentals of Dynamics and Kinematics of machines, this principle helps in analyzing the forces that act on a link of a mechanism when it is in motion. In textbooks of engineering dynamics, this is sometimes referred to as &quot;d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle&quot;. 

Some educators caution that attempts to use d&#x27;Alembert inertial mechanics lead students to make frequent sign errors. A potential cause for these errors is the sign of the inertial forces. Inertial forces can be used to describe an apparent force in a non-inertial reference frame that has an acceleration formula_32 with respect to an inertial reference frame. In such a non-inertial reference frame, a mass that is at rest and has zero acceleration in an inertial reference system, because no forces are acting on it, will still have an acceleration formula_33 and an apparent inertial, or pseudo or fictitious force formula_34 will seem to act on it: in this situation the inertial force has a minus sign.

==Dynamic equilibrium==
D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s form of the principle of virtual work states that a system of rigid bodies is in dynamic equilibrium when the virtual work of the sum of the applied forces and the inertial forces is zero for any virtual displacement of the system. Thus, dynamic equilibrium of a system of formula_35 rigid bodies with formula_36 generalized coordinates requires
formula_37
for any set of virtual displacements formula_38 with formula_39 being a generalized applied force and formula_40 being a generalized inertia force. This condition yields formula_36 equations,
formula_42 
which can also be written as
formula_43
The result is a set of m equations of motion that define the dynamics of the rigid body system.

==Formulation using the Lagrangian==

D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle can be rewritten in terms of the Lagrangian formula_44 of the system as a generalized version of Hamilton&#x27;s principle for the case of point particles, as follows,
formula_45
where:
* formula_46 

* formula_47 are the applied forces

* formula_48 is the virtual displacement of the formula_2-th particle, consistent with the constraints formula_50
* the critical curve satisfies the constraints formula_51
With the Lagrangian
formula_52
the previous statement of d&#x27;Alembert principle is recovered.

==Generalization for thermodynamics==
An extension of d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle can be used in thermodynamics. For instance, for an adiabatically closed thermodynamic system described by a Lagrangian depending on a single entropy &quot;S&quot; and with constant masses formula_53, such as
formula_54
it is written as follows
formula_55
where the previous constraints formula_56 and formula_57 are generalized to involve the entropy as:
* formula_58
* formula_59
Here formula_60 is the temperature of the system, formula_61 are the external forces, formula_62 are the internal dissipative forces. It results in the mechanical and thermal balance equations:
formula_63
Typical applications of the principle include thermo-mechanical systems, membrane transport, and chemical reactions.

For formula_64 the classical d&#x27;Alembert principle and equations are recovered.

<text>Vale Group LLC, doing business as Vulcan Real Estate, is an American private holding company based in Seattle, Washington. The company was founded as Vulcan Inc. in 1986 by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and his sister Jody Allen to establish and oversee the family&#x27;s diverse business activities and philanthropic endeavors. It includes the Paul G. Allen Estate and Trust and advises the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation.

==History==

Vulcan Northwest was formed in Bellevue, Washington in 1986 to manage the business affairs, investments, and philanthropic affairs of Paul Allen. The company initially had a Pacific Northwest focus.
The company&#x27;s headquarters moved from Bellevue to Seattle in 1998. In 2001, they dropped &quot;Northwest&quot; from the company name to reflect growing global ventures.

In 2010, the Green Sports Alliance was conceived and founded by Vulcan Inc. and the Natural Resources Defense Council. Inaugural members and partners included Vulcan ventures such as the Seattle Seahawks, Portland Trail Blazers, and Seattle Sounders FC. Green Sports Alliance Members made a variety of commitments to improve their environmental performance such as reducing waste, conserving energy and water, and eliminating toxic chemicals.

Following Paul Allen&#x27;s death in 2018, Vulcan co-executive Jody Allen—who also serves as the estate&#x27;s executor and trustee—has taken the lead strategic role at Vulcan. This has included instigating a process to assess the various Vulcan projects and enterprises based on either profit or philanthropic impact. Vulcan had approximately 700 employees as of mid-2019, and in October 2019 was reducing some of those positions.

As of 2024, Vulcan LLC is now called Vale Group. 

==Areas of focus==

===Vulcan Real Estate===
Vulcan&#x27;s Real Estate division offers development and portfolio management services from site selection and urban planning to build-to-suit construction. Vulcan has developed 6.6 million square feet of new residential, office, retail and biotechnology research space and has a total development capacity of 10,000,000 square feet (930,000 m2).

Vulcan Real Estate redeveloped the South Lake Union neighborhood north of downtown Seattle and along the south shore of Lake Union. More than $5.7 billion has been invested in the neighborhood since 2002 for development projects and public infrastructure improvements.

Vulcan advocated for the Seattle Streetcar line known as South Lake Union Streetcar, which runs from Seattle&#x27;s Westlake Center to the south end of Lake Union. The streetcar officially started operation on December 12, 2007. This development has been criticized as a city-supported real estate investment for Vulcan Inc., and concerns over the loss of low-income housing have been expressed..

In 2012, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; called Allen&#x27;s South Lake Union investment &quot;unexpectedly lucrative&quot; and one that led to his firm selling a 1,800,000 square feet (170,000 m2) office complex to Amazon.com for US$1.16 billion, one of the most expensive office deals ever in Seattle. &quot;It&#x27;s exceeded my expectations,&quot; Mr. Allen said of the South Lake Union development. The company also developed a five-building complex for Google near Lake Union Park that is planned to open in stages between 2019 and 2022. In late February 2022, Vulcan Real Estate sold the two-block, four building Google campus overlooking Seattle&#x27;s Lake Union for $802 million, a price of $1,260 per square foot that&#x27;s believed to set a new record for the city&#x27;s office market.

In September 2014, Vulcan made a commitment to invest $200 million at Yesler Terrace where it would purchase three land parcels from the Seattle Housing Authority as part of an ambitious redevelopment plan for the 30-acre low-income housing site located southeast of downtown Seattle.

==== The Hospital Club ====
In 2002, Paul Allen reopened the doors of the old St. Paul&#x27;s Hospital in London&#x27;s Covent Garden neighborhood, revealing a new 60,000-square-foot creative hub, providing a professional and social hub to those working in the film, television, music, advertising, contemporary art and design, publishing and journalism, interactive media, theatre and fashion industries.

==== Museums ====

*The Flying Heritage &amp; Combat Armor Museum displays Paul G. Allen&#x27;s collection of rare military aircraft, tanks and other military hardware from the United States, Germany, Japan, Russia, and the United Kingdom. The Collection opened to the public in 2004 at the Arlington, Washington airfield, moving in 2008 to a hangar at Paine Field in Everett, Washington. Several weeks after Allen&#x27;s death in 2018, the museum opened a larger hangar to preserve related stories.
*The Living Computers: Museum + Labs (LCM+L) Is a computer and technology museum located in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. LCM+L (originally known as Living Computer Museum, and before that, PDPplanet.com) was founded by Paul Allen, on January 9, 2006.
*The Museum of Pop Culture, or MoPOP (previously called EMP Museum), Is a nonprofit museum dedicated to contemporary popular culture. It was founded by Paul Allen in 2000 as the Experience Music Project. Since that time MoPOP has organized dozens of exhibits, 17 of which have toured across the US and internationally.
*The Seattle Art Fair displays modern and contemporary art and is a showcase for the arts community of the Pacific Northwest.
*The SIFF Cinema Downtown, previously named the Seattle Cinerama, is a downtown Seattle theater with a large screen. It was remodeled in 2014 to allow for more projection methods, and remodeled again, reopening in December 2023.
*The Upstream Music Fest + Summit is a three-day music festival.

===Vulcan Sports and Entertainment===
Established in 2007, Vulcan Sports and Entertainment (VSE) provides strategic oversight for Allen&#x27;s professional sports franchises including the Portland Trail Blazers, the Seattle Seahawks and manages Lumen Field, WaMu Theater, the Moda Center and Veterans Memorial Coliseum (Portland, Oregon). In the fall of 2018, Chris McGowan was named CEO of Vulcan Sports and Entertainment after Peter McLoughlin left the Seahawks.

===Research===

Both the Allen Institute for Brain Science and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence were incubated at Vulcan Inc. 
Started at Vulcan Inc. in 2001, the Allen Brain Atlas project sought to understand the connections between genes and brain functioning. From the project&#x27;s research, Paul Allen created the Allen Institute for Brain Science in 2003 with a $100 million donation.

Project Halo came next. The project ran from 2002 to 2013, with the goal of creating a &quot;digital Aristotle&quot; that can correctly answer queries about scientific information, using artificial intelligence. The project led to a number of spinoff technologies, including the wiki software bundle SMW+, the Semantic Inferencing on Large Knowledge (SILK) project and the Automated User-Centered Reasoning and Acquisition System (AURA). From Project Halo&#x27;s results, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence was created.

=== Vulcan Productions ===
Vulcan Productions produces films, digital programs and outreach initiatives. Its programs have won awards including the George Foster Peabody Award, the Emmy Award, and the Grammy Award. Vulcan Productions closed in 2021.

===Technology===
Vulcan Inc. has also directly led some technology projects.

In 2003, Vulcan began developing the Vulcan FlipStart, a subnotebook with a 5.6-inch screen. The company began to manufacture and sell the FlipStart in March 2007, and ceased production in May 2008.

Vulcan Spectrum, a branch of Vulcan Inc., participated in the United States 2008 wireless spectrum auction, and paid for &quot;A Block&quot; spectrum in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton area, and for &quot;A Block&quot; spectrum in Portland-Salem.

Vulcan Aerospace is a subsidiary of Vulcan Inc. set up in 2015 to help achieve Paul Allen&#x27;s desire to make commercial space travel more convenient and less expensive. Vulcan Aerospace oversaw the development of Stratolaunch Systems project, an air launch system being developed 2010–2019 to transport payloads to low Earth orbit using a large carrier aircraft. In 2016, initial test flights were projected to take place as early as 2016.
In September 2016, Vulcan Aerospace President Chuck Beames left his role leading the effort and was replaced by an interim executive director: &quot;Jean Floyd, the CEO of Vulcan’s Stratolaunch Systems.&quot;
Although the super-sized Stratolaunch carrier aircraft first flew on April 13, 2019, at the Mojave Air and Space Port in a 2 h 29 min flight,
Vulcan announced in May 2019 that the company would cease operations. 
The assets of Stratolaunch, including all intellectual property and the -wingspan carrier aircraft—&quot;the world’s largest aircraft to fly&quot;—were put up for sale for in June 2019. Stratolaunch was sold and the new owner was identified in December 2019 to be Cerberus Capital Management. Stratolaunch continued to operate under new ownership.

===Philanthropy ===

In 2014, Vulcan Inc. partnered with Elephants Without Borders to secure a $7.3 million grant to conduct the Great Elephant Census. The census was designed to provide accurate and up-to-date data about the number and distribution of African elephants by using standardized aerial surveys of thousands of square miles. Prior to the survey, many countries had not conducted surveying flights in as many as 10 years. Dozens of researchers flying in small planes captured comprehensive observational data of elephants and elephant carcasses. The census was completed in 2016, finding that elephant populations had declined by as much as 30 percent over the previous seven years as a result of poaching.

In February 2016, Allen announced that Vulcan would donate $2 million in grants to stop the spread of the Zika virus. Most of the funds went to mosquito control efforts in countries where the virus was quickly spreading, while the remainder was used to fund a diagnostic test.

<doc id="499431" wikidata="Q1731265" url="?curid=499431" title="The Music Lovers">
<text>The Music Lovers is a 1971 British drama film directed by Ken Russell and starring Richard Chamberlain and Glenda Jackson. The screenplay by Melvyn Bragg, based on &quot;Beloved Friend&quot;, a collection of personal correspondence edited by Catherine Drinker Bowen and Barbara von Meck, focuses on the life and career of 19th-century Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It was one of the director&#x27;s biographical films about classical composers, which include &quot;Elgar&quot; (1962), &quot;Delius: Song of Summer&quot; (1968), &quot;Mahler&quot; (1974) and &quot;Lisztomania&quot; (1975), made from an often idiosyncratic standpoint.

==Plot==
Much of the film is without dialogue and the story is presented in flashbacks, nightmares, and fantasy sequences set to Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music. As a child, the composer sees his mother die horribly, forcibly immersed in scalding water as a supposed cure for cholera, and is haunted by the scene throughout his musical career. Despite his difficulty in establishing his reputation, he attracts Madame Nadezhda von Meck as his patron. His marriage to the allegedly nymphomaniacal Antonina Miliukova is plagued by his homosexual urges and lustful desire for Count Anton Chiluvsky. The dynamics of his life lead to deteriorating mental health and the loss of von Meck&#x27;s patronage, and he dies of cholera after deliberately drinking contaminated water while his wife ends up in an insane asylum.

==Production==
===Development===
Producer Harry Saltzman had seen some of Russell&#x27;s television work and wanted to collaborate with him. Russell had made many films for television about composers and artists, including Debussy (&quot;The Debussy Film&quot;) and Strauss (&quot;Dance of the Seven Veils&quot;), and suggested a biopic of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, who he had long admired. Saltzman wanted to do something more commercial, leading to &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot; (1967). Following that film, Russell tried to get Saltzman to finance the Tchaikovsky film again but the producer declined as Dimitri Tiomkin was making his own Tchaikovsky film.

Eventually, United Artists agreed to finance following the success of &quot;Women in Love&quot;. Russell later claimed: &quot;if I hadn&#x27;t told United Artists that it was a story about a homosexual who fell in love with a nymphomaniac it might have never been financed.&quot;

The script was based on a collection of letters from Tchaikovsky, &quot;Beloved Friend&quot;, published in 1937.

Originally titled &quot;Tchaikovsky&quot;, Russell&#x27;s film focused on the years 1874–76, which Russell felt were the most crucial in the composer&#x27;s life. The title was changed to &quot;The Lonely Heart&quot; to differentiate from the Russian film released the previous year. The title card ultimately reads &quot;Ken Russell&#x27;s Film on Tchaikovsky and The Music Lovers&quot; .

Russell said: &quot;The film is about the fact that Tchaikovsky couldn&#x27;t love anyone even though he wrote some of the world&#x27;s most beautiful music. He loved himself really and his sister. The film is about how artists transcend personal problems, how he used these problems and their results to create this particular kind of music.&quot; The director later added &quot;there&#x27;s as much tranquillity in my film on Tchaikovsky as there is in his music.&quot;

&quot;Great heroes are the stuff of myth and legend, not facts,&quot; he added. &quot;Music and facts don&#x27;t mix. Tchaikovsky said: &#x27;My life is in my music.&#x27; And who can deny that the man&#x27;s music is not utterly fantastic? So likewise the movie! I sought to honour his genius by offering up my own small portion of his courage to create.&quot;

===Casting===
Russell offered the two lead roles to actors he worked with on &quot;Women in Love&quot;, Glenda Jackson and Alan Bates. Both accepted, but Bates then changed his mind. Russell felt this was because Bates &quot;thought it might not be good for his image to play two sexually deviant parts in rapid succession.&quot;

UA wanted a star to play Tchaikovsky but Russell struggled to find someone willing. Richard Chamberlain was suggested, who had recently relocated to the UK. Russell said &quot;When his name was originally put forward I nearly had a heart attack. I&#x27;d only seen him as a bland TV doctor.&quot; However, the director changed his mind after he saw the actor in a TV version of &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; (&quot;I knew we had a contender&quot;). When he learned that Chamberlain was a skilled piano player, the actor was cast.

Chamberlain called the role &quot;easily the biggest challenge of my career.&quot; Russell said Chamberlain &quot;had a certain quiet dignity... which I felt the character needed. He was good to work with, very gentle and sweet; he did everything we asked him.&quot;

===Production notes===
* Jackson said the filmmakers tried to research insane asylums in Russia at the time by asking the Russian embassy &quot;but they told us they were all wonderful so we ended up literally making the film out of the imagination of Ken Russell.&quot;
* Jackson said &quot;I think people will love it or hate it but I doubt that anyone will go away feeling nothing. I think it&#x27;s really quite extraordinary.&quot; She also said she preferred &quot;Women in Love&quot; to &quot;The Music Lovers&quot; &quot;because it had the better script and that makes all the difference.&quot;

* Rafael Orozco recorded the piano pieces played by Tchaikovsky in the film.
* Russell brought on his wife Shirley as costume designer and cast four of their children – Alexander, Victoria, James, and Xavier – in small roles.
* In one sequence, Tchaikovsky and his patron glimpse each other from a distance as she passes through a wood in her carriage. In real life, their paths accidentally crossed in an Italian park. Later, his wife Nina loses her mind and is placed in an insane asylum; in reality, she was not institutionalised until after his death.
* Jackson and Andrew Faulds later served together as Labour Party MPs in the British House of Commons from 1992 to 1997, while screenwriter Melvyn Bragg has been a Labour member of the House of Lords since 1998.

==Release==
===Reception===
In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby stated:
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called it &quot;an involved and garish private fantasy&quot; and &quot;totally irresponsible as a film about, or inspired by, or parallel to, or bearing a vague resemblance to, Tchaikovsky, his life and times.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; commented: &quot;Seventy-seven years have passed since Tchaikovsky&#x27;s death. In this epoch of emancipated morality, it would be reasonable to expect that his life would be reviewed with fresh empathy. But no; the same malignant attitudinizing that might have been applied decades ago is still at work . . . [the film&#x27;s] arch tableaux, its unstable amalgam of life and art, make it a director&#x27;s picture . . . attempting to reveal psychology through music, Russell makes every character grotesque, every bar of music programmatic.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; opined, &quot;By unduly emphasizing the mad and the perverse in their biopic . . . producer-director Ken Russell and scripter Melvyn Bragg lose their audience. The result is a motion picture that is frequently dramatically and visually stunning but more often tedious and grotesque . . . Instead of a Russian tragedy, Russell seems more concerned with haunting the viewers&#x27; memory with shocking scenes and images. The opportunity to create a memorable and fluid portrait of the composer has been sacrificed for a musical Grand Guignol.&quot;

In the &quot;Cleveland Press&quot;, Toni Mastroianni said, &quot;The movies have treated composers notoriously badly but few films have been quite so awful as this pseudo-biography of Tchaikovsky.&quot;

Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; described the film as a &quot;Ken Russell fantasia – musical biography as wet dream&quot; and added, &quot;[it] hangs together more successfully than his other similar efforts, thanks largely to a powerhouse performance by Glenda Jackson, one actress who can hold her own against Russell&#x27;s excess.&quot;

&quot;TV Guide&quot; calls it &quot;a spurious biography of a great composer that is so filled with wretched excesses that one hardly knows where to begin . . . all the attendant surrealistic touches director Ken Russell has added take this out of the realm of plausibility and into the depths of cheap gossip.&quot;

&quot;Time Out New York&quot; calls it &quot;vulgar, excessive, melodramatic and self-indulgent . . . the drama is at fever pitch throughout . . . Chamberlain doesn&#x27;t quite have the range required in the central role, though his keyboard skills are impressive.&quot;

In the London &quot;Times&quot;, John Russell Taylor wrote of Russell when reviewing this film: &quot;His talent, his sheer zest for film-making are not in doubt. But there is no doubt that his unique gifts are matched at times by a unique talent for misapplying them.&quot;

Pauline Kael would later say in an interview: &quot;You really feel you should drive a stake through the heart of the man who made it. I mean it is so vile. It is so horrible.&quot;

&quot;The Music Lovers&quot; was released to DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on 12 October 2011 via its DVD-on-demand service available through Amazon.

<text>Ignacy Domeyko or Domejko, pseudonym: &quot;Żegota&quot; (, ; 31 July 1802 – 23 January 1889) was a Polish geologist, mineralogist, educator, and founder of the University of Santiago, in Chile. Domeyko spent most of his life, and died, in his adopted country, Chile.

After a youth passed in partitioned Poland, Domeyko participated in the Polish–Russian War 1830–31. Upon Russian victory, he was exiled, spending part of his life in France (where he had gone with a fellow Philomath, Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz) before eventually settling in Chile, whose citizen he became.

He lived some 50 years in Chile and made major contributions to the study of that country&#x27;s geography, geology and mineralogy. His observations on the circumstances of poverty-stricken miners and of their wealthy exploiters had a profound influence on those who would go on to shape Chile&#x27;s labor movement.

Domeyko is seen as having had close ties to several countries and thus in 2002, when UNESCO organized a series of commemorations of the 200th anniversary of his birth, he was referred to as &quot;a citizen of the world&quot;.

==Life==
=== Early life ===

Ignacy Domeyko was born in the then Russian partition of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, at Niedźwiadka Wielka () Manor (Bear Cub Manor) near Nieśwież, Minsk Governorate, Imperial Russia (now Karelichy district, Belarus). The Domeyko family held the Polish &quot;Dangiel&quot; coat of arms. Ignacy&#x27;s father, Hipolit Domeyko, who was president of the local land court (), died when Ignacy was seven years old; the boy&#x27;s uncles then served as his guardians.

In his youth Ignacy was a subject of the Russian Empire. He had, however, been brought up in the culture of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, a multicultural state whose educated and dominant classes had spoken Polish as a &quot;lingua franca&quot;. Shortly before Domeyko&#x27;s birth, the Commonwealth had been dismembered in the partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. For this reason, and because Domeyko subsequently spent most of his life in Chile, he is considered a person of national importance to Poles, Belarusians, Lithuanians, and Chileans.

Domeyko enrolled at Vilnius University, then known as the Imperial University of Vilna, in 1816 as a student of mathematics and physics. He studied under Jędrzej Śniadecki. Involved with the Philomaths, a secret student organisation dedicated to Polish culture and the restoration of Poland&#x27;s independence, he was a close friend of Adam Mickiewicz. In 1823–24, during the investigation and trials of the Philomaths, Domeyko and Mickiewicz spent months incarcerated at Vilnius&#x27; Uniate Basilian monastery.

After participating in the November 1830 Uprising, in which Domeyko served as an officer under General Dezydery Chłapowski, in 1831 Domeyko was forced into exile in order not to face Russian reprisals.

=== Exile ===
Journeying through Germany, he arrived in France, where he would earn an engineering degree at Paris&#x27; &quot;École des Mines&quot; (School of Mining). He also studied at the Sorbonne and maintained his political engagements with Belarusians, Poles, and Lithuanians.

==== Chile ====

In 1838 Domeyko left for Chile. There he made substantial contributions to mineralogy and the technology of mining, studied several previously unknown minerals, advocated for the civil rights of the native tribal peoples, and was a meteorologist and ethnographer. He is also credited with introducing the metric system to Latin America.

He served as a professor at a mining college in Coquimbo (La Serena) and after 1847 at the University of Chile (&quot;Universidad de Chile&quot;, in Santiago), of which he was rector for 16 years (1867–83).
Domeyko gained Chilean citizenship in 1849, but declared at the time that &quot;I may now never change my citizenship, but God grants me hope that wherever I may be—whether in the Cordilleras or in [the Vilnius suburb of] Paneriai—I shall die a Lithuanian.&quot; The term &quot;Lithuanian&quot; at that time designated any inhabitant, whatever his ethnicity, of the territories of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

In 1884 Domeyko returned for an extended visit to Europe and remained there until 1889, visiting his birthplace and other places in the former Commonwealth, as well as Paris and Jerusalem.

In 1887 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Jagiellonian University, in Kraków.

In 1889, soon after returning to Santiago, Chile, Domeyko died.

==Memorials==

Named in honour of Domeyko are: 

* the plant genus &quot;Domeykoa,&quot; whose species range from Peru to Chile, 
* the mineral &quot;domeykite&quot;, 
* the shellfish &quot;Nautilus domeykus&quot;,
* the dinosaur genus &quot;Domeykosaurus&quot;, 
* the ammonite &quot;Amonites domeykanus&quot;, 
* the asteroid &quot;2784 Domeyko&quot;, 
* the &quot;Cordillera Domeyko&quot; mountain range in the Andes, and 
* the Chilean town of &quot;Domeyko&quot;.

A bronze bust of Domeyko stands in the Casa Central de la Universidad de Chile, of which Domeyko was long-time rector.

In 1992, a plaque in Spanish and Polish was placed on a building at &quot;Krakowskie Przedmieście 64&quot;, in Warsaw, Poland, commemorating the &quot;distinguished son of the Polish nation and eminent citizen of Chile.&quot;

On the 200th anniversary of his birth, UNESCO declared 2002 to be &quot;Ignacy Domeyko Year.&quot; Several commemorative events were held in Chile under the auspices of Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski and Chilean President Ricardo Lagos.

In 2002, Poland and Chile jointly issued a postage stamp commemorating the 200th anniversary of Domeyko&#x27;s birth.

Also in 2002, a 200th-birthday plaque honoring him was placed in the entry gate to Uniate Basilian monastery in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he and Adam Mickiewicz were held in 1823–24 during the investigation and trials of the Philomaths.

In 2015 a Belarusian climber Pavel Gorbunov placed a memorial plate on the top of Cerro Kimal in Cordillera Domeyko.

<text>STS-44 was a NASA Space Shuttle mission using &quot;Atlantis&quot; that launched on November 24, 1991. It was a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) space mission.

== Crew ==

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission highlights ==

The launch was on November 24, 1991, at 23:44:00 UTC. A launch set for November 19, 1991, was delayed due to replacement and testing of a malfunctioning redundant inertial measurement unit on the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) booster attached to the Defense Support Program (DSP) satellite. The launch was reset for November 24 and was delayed by 13 minutes to allow an orbiting spacecraft to pass and to allow external tank liquid oxygen replenishment after minor repairs to a valve in the liquid oxygen replenishment system in the mobile launcher platform. Launch weight was .

The mission was dedicated to the Department of Defense. The unclassified payload included a Defense Support Program (DSP) satellite, DSP-16 attached to Inertial Upper Stage (IUS-14), deployed on flight day one. Cargo bay and middeck payloads included the Interim Operational Contamination Monitor (IOCM), Terra-Scout, Military Man in Space (M88-1), Air Force Maui Optical Site (AMOS), Cosmic Radiation Effects and Activation Monitor (CREAM), Shuttle Activation Monitor (SAM), Radiation Monitoring Equipment (RME III), Visual Function Tester (VFT-1), Bioreactor Flow, and Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project, a series of investigations in support of Extended Duration Orbiter. The Ultraviolet Plume Instrument (UVPI) experiment was located onboard the previously-launched LACE satellite, and could&#x27;ve been pointed at &quot;Atlantis&quot; on-orbit to observe the shuttle&#x27;s thruster firings. However, no opportunities or intersections occurred during this mission.

The landing was on December 1, 1991, at 22:34:44 UTC, Runway 5, Edwards Air Force Base, California. The rollout distance was , and the rollout time was 107 seconds. The landing weight was . The landing was originally scheduled for Kennedy Space Center on December 4, 1991, but the ten-day mission was shortened and the landing rescheduled following the November 30, 1991, on-orbit failure of one of three orbiter inertial measurement units. The lengthy rollout was due to minimal braking for test. &quot;Atlantis&quot; returned to Kennedy on December 8, 1991. This was also the final shuttle landing on a dry lake bed runway.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<text>STS-42 was a NASA Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; mission with the Spacelab module. Liftoff was originally scheduled for 8:45 EST (13:45 UTC) on January 22, 1992, but the launch was delayed due to weather constraints. &quot;Discovery&quot; successfully lifted off an hour later at 9:52:33 EST (14:52:33 UTC) on her 14th flight. The main goal of the mission was to study the effects of microgravity on a variety of organisms. The shuttle landed at 8:07:17 PST (16:07:17 UTC) on January 30, 1992, on Runway 22, Edwards Air Force Base, California. STS-42 was the first of two flights in 1992 of &quot;Discovery&quot;, the second of which occurred during STS-53, which launched on December 2, 1992. The mission was also the last mission of the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; to have a seven-member crew until STS-82, which was launched on February 11, 1997.

== Crew ==
The astronauts were divided into a red team and a blue team to allow around-the-clock monitoring of experiments.

The crew of STS-42 included the first non-American astronauts on a shuttle mission since the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, Ulf D. Merbold and Roberta Bondar. Merbold was West Germany first astronaut and was making his second flight on the shuttle. Bondar was Canada&#x27;s first female astronaut. 

Mary L. Cleave was originally selected to fly as Mission Specialist 3 for this mission but withdrew herself for personal reasons. She was replaced by Manley Lanier &quot;Sonny&quot; Carter Jr., who died seven months prior to the launch in a plane crash. David Hilmers was then chosen to replace him.

=== Backup crew ===
=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission highlights ==
STS-42 was launched on January 22, 1992, 9:52:33 a.m. EST. The launch was delayed by one hour due to weather constraints. The launch weight was .

&quot;Discovery&quot; carried into orbit the International Microgravity Laboratory-1 (IML-1), a pressurized crewed Spacelab module, to explore in depth the complex effects of weightlessness on living organisms and materials processing. The international crew, divided into Red and Blue teams, conducted experiments on the human nervous system&#x27;s adaptation to low gravity and the effects of microgravity on other life forms such as shrimp eggs, lentil seedlings, fruit fly eggs and bacteria. Low gravity materials processing experiments included crystal growth from a variety of substances such as enzymes, mercury, iodine and a virus. Other payloads included 10 Get Away Special (GAS) canisters, a number of middeck payloads, two Shuttle Student Involvement Program (SSIP) experiments, and an Australian developed ultraviolet telescope &quot;Endeavour&quot;. Middeck payloads included Gelation of SOLS: Applied Microgravity Research (GOSAMR), Investigations into Polymer Membrane Processing (IPMP) and the Radiation Monitoring Experiment (RME-III).

The mission landed on January 30, 1992, 8:07:17 a.m. PST, Runway 22, Edwards Air Force Base, California, after being extended by a day for continued scientific experimentation. The rollout distance was . The orbiter returned to Kennedy Space Center on February 16, 1992. The landing weight was .

== Mission insignia ==
The four stars in the lower blue field and two stars in the upper blue field of the insignia symbolize the flight&#x27;s numerical designation in the Space Transportation System&#x27;s mission sequence. The single gold star above the horizon on the right is in honor of astronaut Manley Lanier &quot;Sonny&quot; Carter Jr., who was killed in the crash of Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 2311 in Brunswick, Georgia while on a commercial airplane traveling for NASA. Carter was originally assigned as a mission specialist on STS-42 at the time of his death.

<doc id="499461" wikidata="Q813810" url="?curid=499461" title="Bedale">
<text>Bedale ( ), is a market town and civil parish in North Yorkshire, England. Bedale Beck is a tributary of the River Swale, which forms one of the Yorkshire Dales. The dale has a predominant agriculture sector and its related small traditional trades, although tourism is increasingly important. Northallerton is north-east, Middlesbrough north-east and York is south-east.

Historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, the town was listed in &quot;Domesday Book&quot; under what became the honour of Richmond. The honour had several wapentakes and Bedale was part of Hang (named after Hang Bank in Finghall or alternatively named after Catterick) and later Hang East.

== History ==

Before the Harrying of the North Bedale was held by Torpin (Thorfinn), a patronym retained by the infamous Dick Turpin. The parish church also dates from this time (as evidenced by its crypt), before significant remodelling. The original 9th-century church escaped destruction in the Harrying of the North and was recorded in Domesday Book. The recent discovery of the Bedale Hoard provides further evidence of high-status Anglo-Saxon and Viking Age activity in the area. The town was recorded as Bedell or Bedhal and derives from &#x27;Beda&#x27;s Halh&#x27;, which means the corner or piece of land of Beda.

=== Under the Bretons of Richmond ===

After being doled out by Count Alan Le Roux to his relative Bodin of Middleham for a short time, the new market town was founded by Scollandus (in a charter later confirmed by Henry III), a Breton officer in a hereditary position at Richmond Castle. Bedale Hall marks the site of a castle built in the reign of King Edward I of England by Sir Bryan FitzAlan, Lord of the Manor of Bedale and later Baron FitzAlan. After contributing to the defeat of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, FitzAlan succeeded the Earl of Surrey as Guardian and Keeper of Scotland for Edward I and fought at the Battle of Falkirk (1298) and the siege of Caerlaverock in July 1300. Fitz Alan was involved in a fight with William Wallace that led to the death of a comrade-in-arms and held the castles of Dundee and Forfar, as well as those in the Scottish Lowlands: Roxburgh Castle and Jedburgh. This baron also built Killerby Castle and Askham Bryan in Yorkshire.

=== Stapleton, Lovell and others ===

His co-heir &quot;jure uxoris&quot;, Sir Gilbert de Stapleton of Carleton, Knt, was a conspirator in the assassination of Piers Gaveston. Sir Miles Stapleton was a founding Knight of the Order of the Garter, who fought at the Siege of Calais and at the Battle of Crécy. The Stapletons were &quot;Lollard knights&quot; and were Lords of the Manor of Bedale for generations. Bedale had traditionally been a Lancastrian area, until the Kingmaker, Clarence and Gloucester obtained Richmond and Middleham Castles. Following the Battle of Bosworth Field, Francis Lovell, 1st Viscount Lovell led the charge of insurgency in the Yorkist Stafford and Lovell Rebellion against Henry VII of England, attainted Earl of Richmond. The inhabitants of the region went on several recusancy strikes, such as the Pilgrimage of Grace and made trouble for John Nevill, 3rd Baron Latymer (Catherine Parr&#x27;s husband before Henry VIII) in Snape Castle. This continued in the Rising of the North, with Henry VII&#x27;s follower Simon Digby of Aiskew executed and replaced by Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, whose wife sold it to the native Sir William Theakston &amp; John Jackson, after which it was resold to Cavalier Henry Peirse, whose descendants remain in town. During the English Civil War, Philip Stapleton continued in much of the same anti-Tudor &amp; Stuart sentiment as Guy Fawkes, whose statement, when asked by one of the Scottish lords what he had intended to do with so much gunpowder, Fawkes answered him, &quot;To blow you Scotch beggars back to your own native mountains!&quot; Middleham Castle was subsequently ordered to be demolished by the Parliamentarians so that the Royalists could not take it again. However there is no documentary proof that this order was ever carried out.

=== Lords of the Manor ===

*Sir Alan FitzBrian, Knt, Lord of the Manor of Bedale &amp;c., (died shortly before 17 May 1267, killed in self-defence by Payn le Keu of Brandesburton) was a descendant of Conan I of Rennes, Duke of Brittany. He had two known sons, the younger being Theobald FitzAlan of Stow and Quy (d. 21 February 1308), and was succeeded at Bedale by the elder:
*Sir Brian FitzAlan Knt., (d. 1 June 1306), J.P., High Sheriff of Yorkshire, &amp;c. He was summoned to parliament from 24 June 1295 to 22 January 1305 by Writs directed to &quot;Briano filio Alani&quot; whereby he is held to have become Lord FitzAlan. Upon his death any hereditary peerage created by the Writ of 1295 is held to be in &quot;abeyance&quot;.

His daughters, Agnes (born 1298) and Katherine (born 1300), were his co-heirs in his landed estates and manors. They were also co-heirs to his brother, Theobald. Katherine (d. before 7 August 1328) married Sir John de Grey, 1st Baron Grey de Rotherfield, KG (9 October 1300 – 1 September 1359).

The estate of Bedale and the Lordship of the Manor passed via the elder daughter, Agnes FitzAlan, whose marriage was granted on 10 May 1306 (when she was aged just 8) to Sir Miles de Stapleton of Carlton, Yorkshire, for his son:

*Sir Gilbert de Stapleton, Knt., (d. before 23 June 1324) a younger son, whom she married before 15 December 1317, in whose family Bedale remained for more than a century and was still in the possession of their great-great-grandson,
*Sir Miles Stapleton, who died 30 September 1466. His younger brother Brian Stapleton of Crispings (in Happisburgh) and Hasilden, Norfolk, died at about the same time and they both left only co-heiresses.

The Lordship of Bedale Manor is currently held jointly by Lord Beaumont, heir of both FitzAlan moiety lines, but the Beresford-Peirse baronets retain distinction as having de facto possession of the manor, which was originally forfeited by Lovell&#x27;s attainder and passed on to numerous instalments of government figures and subsequent real-estate purchasers, whether Digby of Warwickshire, Dudley of Nottinghamshire, native Theakston and Jackson, then Peirse, after which it passed by inheritance to Beresford of Derbyshire.

==Later history==
In the 18th century Bedale was a centre of horseracing. It was the place where races for three-year-olds were introduced in England (previously limited to older horses).

==Governance==
The electoral ward of the same name includes Aiskew parish, with a total population of 4,601 at the 2011 Census. In October 2018 the town was twinned with Azay-sur-Cher, a small town on the River Cher in the Loire Valley in France.

From 1974 to 2023 Bedale was part of the Hambleton District of North Yorkshire.

Bedale was part of the Richmond (Yorks) parliamentary constituency until 2023. It was removed and added to the expanded Thirsk and Malton Constituency, in part due to areas from that constituency being created into a new seat of Wetherby and Easingwold.

== Churches ==
===St Gregory&#x27;s===
The church retains some Catholic relics, although during the English Civil War Puritans vandalised features such as statues. St Gregory&#x27;s has a painting of St George slaying the dragon, unusual in that St George is depicted as being left-handed, and also contains a stone Viking Age grave marker, notable for a rare depiction of the legend of Wayland Smith. When Scots raided the countryside, inhabitants expected to find security in St Gregory&#x27;s pele tower. There is a portcullis at the foot of the tower for extra security. Bedale St Gregory is the parish church in the Church of England in the rural deanery of Wensley within the Diocese of Leeds and its patron is the present Beresford-Peirse baronet. There is a plaque in the church listing all priests of the parish. There is another plaque of the previous landlords of Bedale, featuring coats of arms of these people or their families: Fitzalan, Stapleton, Grey of Rotherfield (related to Lady Jane Grey), Sheffield, de Warrene (Earl of Surrey), Brian de Thornhill, Lawrence de Thornhill, Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, Fitz Hugh of Tanfield, John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond, Marmion, Arthur III, Duke of Brittany and Ascough/Aiskew.

St Gregory&#x27;s had a daughter church known as St Augustine&#x27;s Church and Village Hall at Leeming Bar, no longer used for worship, and a Mission Chapel at Burrill. There are other local Anglican chapels, such as St Gregory&#x27;s at Crakehall and St Patrick&#x27;s at Patrick Brompton. Two other parishes with churches joined in the benefice with St Gregory&#x27;s are St John the Baptist (Leeming village) and St Mary the Virgin (Thornton Watlass).

===Others===
The Catholic St Mary and St Joseph&#x27;s Church, Bedale lies in Aiskew. There are Methodist chapels in Bedale, Leeming, Crakehall and Aiskew. Some buildings in the area also have their own private chapels, such as at Christ&#x27;s Hospital in Firby.

==Transport==

Bedale lies on the B6285 road, which runs south and south east from Bedale and connects with the A6055 road at Burneston. The A684 road used to go through the town but a bypass was opened in August 2016, which means through traffic now avoids Leeming Bar, Aiskew and Bedale. The town is only west of the A1(M) at Leeming Bar via the A684 or via the adjoining village of Aiskew.

Bedale has a railway station on the preserved Wensleydale Railway. The station opened in 1855 and lasted almost a century before British Rail closed it in April 1954. The line remained open for local goods until the 1980s and for the limestone quarry at Redmire until 1992. The Ministry of Defence paid £750,000 to have the line upgraded and improved so that it could transfer heavy vehicles (mostly tanks) between Catterick Garrison and other MoD sites across the United Kingdom. These trains continue to run sporadically.

The line was eventually reopened in 2003 as a heritage railway between Leeming Bar and Redmire. The station is actually in Aiskew, since it lies east of Bedale Beck, which forms the boundary between the two. The line was later extended to Scruton as well as to the west of Northallerton.

Work on making Bedale Beck navigable to barges down to the River Swale at Gatenby began in 1768 and resulted in an area at the south end of the town known as The Harbour. The plan was abandoned in 1855 when the railway was opened but the weir and some iron moorings still exist on the beck just south of the Bedale to Aiskew road bridge. A public footpath runs along the Bedale side of the beck from the bridge for more than , passing the leech house, the harbour and the sewage works, first behind houses and then emerging into open country with fields to the west.

==Education==
Bedale has three schools: Bedale Primary School, Bedale High School and Mowbray School.

== Economy and attractions ==

Historic buildings include a unique 18th-century Leech House formerly used as an apothecary&#x27;s store for leeches, an underground ice house in the grounds of the Hall used for preserving food and the 14th-century Grade I listed Bedale Market Cross. Bedale has a small museum, numerous Georgian buildings (though many of them are much older and only look Georgian) and a railway station on the Wensleydale Railway, which runs to Redmire via Leyburn. The Thorp Perrow Arboretum lies nearby, as do the villages of Burneston, Burrill, Cowling, Exelby and Firby.

The town has many local shops, a Co-op Food supermarket, pubs and eating places along its market place. It holds a market every Tuesday on the cobbles that line the market place, and there is a car-boot sale in the park every Saturday morning from April to October approximately. It also has a leisure centre with full gym, 25-metre swimming pool and astroturf sports pitches. Bedale Athletic Sports Association provides football, cricket, hockey, squash and tennis. Big Sheep Little Cow Farm is a petting zoo next to the railway line and Bedale Beck.

Bedale Golf Club is on the northern edge of the town where the B6285 meets the A684 to Leyburn. The golf club was founded in 1894. The course is 18 holes in wooded parkland.

Bedale also has a brass band with a 25-year history of providing musical education and entertainment for the local community.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees. Television signals are received from the Bilsdale transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio York on 104.3 FM, Greatest Hits Radio York &amp; North Yorkshire on 103.5 FM and Dales Radio on 104.9 FM.

The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;The Northern Echo&quot; and &quot;Darlington &amp; Stockton Times&quot;.

==Filmography==
The 1945 film &quot;The Way to the Stars&quot; was filmed with Bedale as the local town for the fictional &quot;RAF Halfpenny Field&quot; and some of the locations remain little changed. The film stars Sir John Mills and Sir Michael Redgrave as RAF pilots and Bedale was one of a number of locations used during filming.

<text>STS-45 was a 1992 NASA Space Shuttle mission using the . Its almost nine-day scientific mission was with a non-deployable payload of instruments. It was the 46th Space Shuttle mission and the 11th for &quot;Atlantis&quot;.

== Crew ==

The astronauts were divided into a red team and a blue team to allow around-the-clock monitoring of experiments.

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission highlights ==
&quot;Atlantis&quot; was launched on March 24, 1992, at 8:13 a.m. EST. The launch was originally scheduled for March 23, 1992, but was delayed by one day because of higher-than-allowable concentrations of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen in the orbiter&#x27;s aft compartment during tanking operations. During troubleshooting, the leaks could not be reproduced, leading engineers to believe that they were the result of plumbing in the main propulsion system not thermally conditioned to the cryogenic propellants; the launch was rescheduled for March 24, 1992. &quot;Atlantis&quot; weighed at launch.

STS-45 carried the first Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science (ATLAS-1) experiments, placed on Spacelab pallets mounted in the orbiter&#x27;s payload bay. The non-deployable payload, equipped with 12 instruments from the United States, France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Japan, conducted studies in atmospheric chemistry, solar radiation, space plasma physics and ultraviolet astronomy. ATLAS-1 instruments included the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS); Grille Spectrometer; Millimeter Wave Atmospheric Sounder (MAS); Imaging Spectrometric Observatory (ISO); Atmospheric Lyman-Alpha Emissions (ALAE); Atmospheric Emissions Photometric Imager (AEPI); Space Experiments with Particle Accelerators (SEPAC); Active Cavity Radiometer (ACR); Measurement of Solar Constant (SOLCON); Solar Spectrum; Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM); and Far Ultraviolet Space Telescope (FAUST). Other payloads included the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) experiment, a Get Away Special (GAS) experiment and six mid-deck experiments.

The mission was extended by a day in order to continue science experiments. The landing occurred on April 2, 1992, 6:23 a.m. EST, on Runway 33 of the Shuttle Landing Facility, located at the Kennedy Space Center. The rollout distance was and &quot;Atlantis&quot; weighed on landing.

== Mission insignia ==
The mission insignia covers all aspects of the flight, by featuring Earth and the Sun, and the orbiter on high inclination, as to illustrate the high importance of the mission. The names of all flying members are included in the band, separated by stars. In the &#x27;ring&#x27; at the bottom right, a single star is included, separating the unmentioned names of the alternate mission specialists, who are therefore indirectly included; a first and unique tribute to a support crew. Dirk Frimout is the first Belgian citizen to fly into space, and the only one to fly on a Space Shuttle (the other is Frank De Winne (who flies to the International Space Station via Soyuz as mission commander), as the Space Shuttle program was terminated at the time of the latter&#x27;s flight), but to keep the focus on the mission, no national flag is added nor the customary logo of the European Space Agency (ESA), but the mission main objective, ATLAS, is included below instead.

<text>STS-49 was NASA&#x27;s maiden flight of the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;, which launched on May 7, 1992. The primary goal of its nine-day mission was to retrieve an Intelsat VI satellite, Intelsat 603, which failed to leave Low Earth orbit two years before, attach it to a new upper stage, and relaunch it to its intended geosynchronous orbit. After several attempts, the capture was completed with the only three-person extravehicular activity (EVA) in space flight history. It would also stand until STS-102 in 2001 as the longest EVA ever undertaken.

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission highlights ==
The Intelsat 603 satellite, stranded in an unusable orbit since launch aboard a Commercial Titan III launch vehicle in March 1990, was captured by crewmembers during an extravehicular activity (EVA) and equipped with a new perigee kick motor. The satellite was subsequently released into orbit and the new motor fired to put the spacecraft into a geosynchronous orbit for operational use.

The capture required three EVAs: a planned one by astronauts Thuot and Hieb, who were unable to attach a capture bar to the satellite from a position on the RMS (Canadarm); a second unscheduled but identical attempt the following day; and finally, an unscheduled but successful hand capture by Thuot, Hieb and Akers as commander Brandenstein delicately maneuvered the orbiter to within a few feet of the communications satellite. An Assembly of Station by EVA Methods (ASEM) structure was erected in the cargo bay by the crew to serve as a platform to aid in the hand capture and subsequent attachment of the capture bar. A planned EVA also was performed by astronauts Thornton and Akers as part of the ASEM experiment to demonstrate and verify maintenance and assembly capabilities for Space Station Freedom. The ASEM space walk, originally scheduled for two successive days, was cut to one day because of the lengthy Intelsat retrieval operation.

Other &quot;payloads of opportunity&quot; experiments conducted included Commercial Protein Crystal Growth (CPCG), Ultraviolet Plume Imager (UVPI) and the Air Force Maui Optical Station (AMOS) investigation. The mission was extended by two days to complete all the mission objectives.

On flight day 7, the Ku-band antenna lost its pointing capability. It had to be stowed manually during the final EVA.

The following records were set during the STS-49 mission: 
* First flight of the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;
* First (and only) EVA involving three astronauts.
* Second and fourth longest EVAs to date: 8 hours, 29 minutes, and 7 hours, 45 minutes. (Longest EVA to date was during STS-102 in 2001: 8 hours 56 minutes; third longest EVA was during STS-61 in 1993: 7 hour 54 minutes)
* First Shuttle mission to feature four EVAs.
* The second longest EVA time for a single Shuttle mission: 25 hours and 27 minutes, or 59:23 person hours. (The longest is STS-61 with 35 hours and 28 minutes)
* First Shuttle mission requiring three rendezvous with an orbiting spacecraft.
* First use of a drag chute during a Shuttle landing.

== Wake-up Calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. A special musical track is chosen for each day in space, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, to have a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or in reference to the day&#x27;s planned activities.

<text>The University of North Alabama (UNA) is a public university in Florence, Alabama, United States. It is the state&#x27;s oldest public university. Occupying a campus in a residential section of Florence, UNA is located within a four-city area that also includes Tuscumbia, Sheffield and Muscle Shoals. The four cities compose a metropolitan area with a combined population of 140,000 people.

The University of North Alabama was one of about 180 &quot;normal schools&quot; founded by state governments in the 19th century to train teachers for the rapidly growing public common schools. Some closed but most steadily expanded their role and became state colleges in the early 20th century and state universities in the late 20th century. It was founded as LaGrange College in 1830. It was reestablished in 1872 as the first state-supported teachers college south of the Ohio River. A year later, it became one of the nation&#x27;s first coeducational colleges.

== History ==
LaGrange College opened on January 11, 1830, in a mountain hamlet a few miles south of Leighton in northeast Colbert County, Alabama. LaGrange means &quot;The Barn&quot; in French. Twenty-one local college trustees were listed in Acts of Alabama, Eleventh Annual Session.

The town of LaGrange and its college were sacked and burned by Union troops in 1863. But by then the college had moved north across the Tennessee River to Florence. The section of Franklin County containing LaGrange Mountain is now Colbert County. LaGrange College, which became Florence Wesleyan University in 1855, is now the University of North Alabama.

LaGrange College arose from the idea offered at a November 28, 1826 meeting of the Tennessee Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church to establish a college which would not be &quot;religious or theological&quot;. By January 1829, the selection of Lawrence Hill on LaGrange Mountain was made for the site of the school.

A year later, LaGrange College opened to students of all denominations in two three-story brick buildings.

The Rev. Robert Paine was the first president; he was also the professor of moral science and belles lettres and taught geography and mineralogy. He was assisted by two other professors. The first board of trustees had a total of 50 members, including two Native Americans, a Choctaw politician and a Cherokee leader. In 1830, Turner Saunders, a native of Virginia, was the first president of the board of trustees. Saunders&#x27; mansion, built around 1826, still stands in Lawrence County. Among the many distant trustees was John Coffee of Florence, friend of Andrew Jackson. Among the local trustees was Henry Stuart Foote of Tuscumbia, who would move to Mississippi and defeat Jefferson Davis in the 1850 Governor&#x27;s election.

In 1850, a grammar school was added to LaGrange College. (Today, UNA&#x27;s Kilby Laboratory School is the only university-owned and operated elementary laboratory school in Alabama). In 1858, following the death of the school&#x27;s president and the loss of most of its students to nearby Florence, the college was suspended and re-established as the LaGrange College and Military Academy, with James W. Robertson as superintendent. Under its new name, additional buildings were constructed and the school reached its highest prosperity. The state of Alabama made provision for two cadets from each county to be enrolled, and by 1861 47 of its 171 students were state cadets. The school suffered a loss of enrollment again when Alabama seceded, and in March 1862 Robertson received approval from the Alabama governor to enroll the 35th Alabama Infantry from faculty, cadets, and enlistees from surrounding counties.

On April 28, 1863, the buildings were destroyed by Union soldiers of the 10th Missouri Cavalry, including a library of 4,000 volumes.

Among LaGrange&#x27;s alumni were several generals, Alabama governors Edward A. O&#x27;Neal and David P. Lewis, Alabama Supreme Court justice William M. Byrd and U.S. Senator Jeremiah Clemens, who wrote the first American Civil War novel and the first western novel.

===Florence Wesleyan University===
LaGrange graduate Richard H. Rivers, after becoming president of the college, led most of the students and all but one faculty member from the mountain in late 1854 to relocate to Florence. The school was re-incorporated as Florence Wesleyan University.

Admission to Florence Wesleyan required an acquaintance with English grammar, arithmetic, geography and the Latin and Greek Grammar. Prospective students also were required to demonstrate an ability to translate four books of Caesar&#x27;s Gallic Wars, six books of Virgil&#x27;s Aeneid, Jacob&#x27;s or Felton&#x27;s Greek Reader, and at least one of Xenophon&#x27;s Anabasis.

One hundred and sixty students enrolled in the first year of operation (1855) of Florence Wesleyan University. The school quickly attracted students from five states and two foreign countries. Among Florence Wesleyan&#x27;s graduates were Alabama governor Emmet O&#x27;Neal and Texas governor Lawrence Sullivan &quot;Sul&quot; Ross (the latter of whose tenure as president of Texas A&amp;M University was known as the &#x27;golden age&#x27; of that institution). Ross also is the namesake of Sul Ross State University in Alpine, Texas.

===Civil War===

The American Civil War created hardship for the institution. Robert A. Young, president of Florence Wesleyan at the time, is credited with saving the institution from destruction.

Florence Wesleyan alumnus Lawrence &quot;Sul&quot; Ross, the future Texas governor and university educator, served as a general in the Confederate States Army. LaGrange College and Florence Wesleyan University also produced three other Civil War generals: Confederate Generals Edward A. O&#x27;Neal (later an Alabama governor) and John Gregg and Union General Daniel McCook Jr.

===State Normal School at Florence===

When the Methodist Church deeded Florence Wesleyan to the State of Alabama in 1872, the institution became the State Normal School at Florence, the first state-supported teachers college south of the Ohio River. Shortly thereafter, it became one of the first co-educational institutions in the nation. A year after its becoming a state school, the institution opened its doors to women; however, none attended until 1874, when 31 young women enrolled. The first woman joined the faculty in 1879.

Florence Normal School&#x27;s Newton W. Bates, professor of language and literature, published his &quot;History of Civil Government of Alabama&quot; in 1892, the first textbook on the history of Alabama.

T.S. Stribling, one of the university&#x27;s most noteworthy alumni, graduated from Florence State Normal School in 1903.

===Florence State Teachers College===
The institution functioned as a normal school for more than 50 years until 1929, when it became a state teachers college offering a four-year curriculum in elementary education.

The first bachelor&#x27;s degrees were awarded in 1931. Less than a decade later, the curriculum was expanded to include a four-year course of study in secondary education. In 1947, the curriculum was expanded again to include A.B. and B.S. degree programs in fields other than teacher training.

===Florence State College===
In 1956, the institution crossed another academic milestone with the formation of a graduate course of study in education leading to the Master of Arts degree. With the establishment of a new Graduate Division, the graduate program was launched in the summer of 1957. The same year, the Alabama Legislature voted to change the institution&#x27;s name to Florence State College to reflect its expanding academic mission.
===Integration at Florence State College===

Compared with other southern institutions of higher learning, particularly the universities of Alabama and Mississippi, integration occurred almost painlessly at Florence State College.

In 1963, Wendell Wilkie Gunn became the first African-American student to enroll at the college. Gunn had initially been denied admission. Then-President E.B. Norton sent Gunn a letter informing him that the Alabama Legislature and Board of Education would not allow the college to accept his application. Speaking at UNA in 2005, famed civil rights attorney Fred Gray, who represented Gunn, recalled that the hearing that integrated UNA lasted only ten minutes, after which Gunn returned to campus and enrolled. Gray described the episode as &quot;the easiest case of my civil rights career.&quot;

Gunn, who subsequently earned degrees from Florence State College and the University of Chicago, went on to a distinguished career in banking and finance, including an appointment as international trade adviser to President Ronald Reagan in 1982. Wendell Gunn was appointed to the board of trustees of the University of North Alabama by Governor Kay Ivey in 2019.

===Florence State University===

In 1967 the Alabama Legislature removed jurisdiction for the college from the State Board of Education and vested it in a board of trustees. A year later, the new board voted for another name change to Florence State University, once again symbolizing the steady expansion of the institution&#x27;s academic offerings and mission.

Ethelbert Brinkley &quot;E.B.&quot; Norton, who was serving as president at the time this name was adopted, is distinguished as the only president in the university&#x27;s history to preside over three institutional name changes: Florence State Teachers College, followed by Florence State College in 1957, and, roughly a decade later, by Florence State University.

The change of name also was accompanied by an extensive reorganization of the university&#x27;s academic and administrative structure, including the establishment of separate schools within the university.

===University of North Alabama===

Less than a decade later, on August 15, 1974, the university underwent another change of name to the University of North Alabama, symbolizing its coming of age as a comprehensive, regional university. The following year, the graduate curriculum again was expanded with the introduction of the master&#x27;s degree program in business administration.

Following a reorganization in 1991, the university&#x27;s administrative structure consists of four divisions: Academic Affairs, Business Affairs, Student Affairs and Advancement, each headed by a vice president. In 1993, the Board of Trustees, anticipating continued and steady enrollment growth, adopted a new master facilities plan to ensure that UNA will be equipped to accommodate 10,000 students.

Kenneth D. Kitts became the 20th president of the University of North Alabama in March 2015.

== Campus ==

UNA&#x27;s campus facilities master plan was developed by the Olmsted Brothers, the sons of the architect who designed New York City&#x27;s Central Park. The campus has three antebellum structures: Wesleyan Hall; Rogers Hall; and Coby Hall. All three are listed in the National Historic Register. The University of North Alabama encompasses two campuses, following a decision in June 2006, by the university&#x27;s board of trustees to purchase J.W. Powell School from the Florence City Schools. The East Campus houses several academic units, including the Office of Continuing Studies and Outreach and the Human Environmental Sciences&#x27; state-of-the-art Culinary Facility
==Buildings==

The UNA Science and Engineering Technology Building was completed in 2015. The five-story, 160,000-square-foot facility was designed by Lambert Ezell Durham Architects and constructed by BL Harbert, The building houses engineering technology, biology, chemistry, occupational health science, physics and earth science. It also includes conference areas, faculty offices, research facilities, specialized classrooms, a dining area, computer laboratories, super laboratories and lecture halls. In June 2018, the building was renamed the Mitchell Burford Science and Technology Building in honor of Mitchell Burford, the largest individual private donor in the university&#x27;s history.
The Wendell W. Gunn University Commons was completed in 2014. The $8 million complex houses the University Success Center, Student Financial Services, the UNA branch of Listerhill Credit Union, Starbucks and Chick-fil-A. The Wendell W. Gunn University Commons was designed by Hugo Dante and Create Architects, and was built by Consolidated Construction. In March 2018, the building was renamed the Wendell W. Gunn University Commons in honor of Wendell Gunn, the first African-American student to enter Florence State College in 1963.
Harrison Plaza was made possible by 1955 alumna Laura McAnally Harrison and her husband, Donald C. Harrison, of Cincinnati. The plaza, constructed around a large Italian limestone fountain, occupies the former intersections of Morrison and Wesleyan Avenues and Seminary Street between 601 Cramer Way, Keller Hall and the George H. Carroll Lion Habitat, which houses UNA&#x27;s live mascots. Harrison Plaza now constitutes the hub of UNA&#x27;s three pedestrian walkways and serves as the principal entrance to campus.
With its distinctive towers, Wesleyan Hall, one of UNA&#x27;s most familiar structures, is considered one of the most eminent landmarks in North Alabama. The Gothic Revival structure was designed to serve LaGrange College when this Methodist institution relocated from Franklin to Lauderdale county and was renamed Florence Wesleyan University. During the Civil War, Wesleyan Hall was occupied by both Union and Confederate armies. General William Tecumseh Sherman is considered the most famous Civil War-era occupant of Wesleyan Hall. After the war, the building was deeded to the state of Alabama and thereafter served as a state normal school. It currently serves as the center for Foreign Languages (French, German, and Spanish), Psychology, and Geography. The building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
Adjacent to Wesleyan Hall in a specially constructed tower is the Wesleyan Bell, which tolled regularly throughout the last quarter of the 19th century to summon Florence Normal School students to class. Sometime around 1910, the bell was removed from Wesleyan Hall and stored. Rediscovered in 2002, the 130-year-old Wesleyan Bell was restored to a prominent place on campus following construction of the Smith Bell Tower in 2004.

Rogers Hall, another one of UNA&#x27;s most distinctive structures, was constructed by planter George Washington Foster in 1855 at the summit of Court Street (hence its original name, Courtview). Because construction would result in the permanent obstruction of a major thoroughfare, the city had to secure the approval of the Alabama Legislature before work could begin. In the fall of 1864, the residence served as the headquarters of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest. Courtview was occupied by members of the Foster family until 1900, when it became the home of Alabama Gov. Emmet O&#x27;Neal. In the 1920s, the residence was acquired by Thomas M. Rogers Sr., and in 1948 by the university. It houses the Offices of Advancement, Alumni Relations, and Communications and Marketing.

Constructed in 1930, 601 Cramer Way houses UNA&#x27;s senior administrative offices. The building is named for David Bibb Graves, who served as Alabama&#x27;s governor from 1927 to 1931 and 1935–39. Graves&#x27;s passage of the largest education budget in Alabama history led to the moniker as the &quot;Education Governor&quot;, Graves&#x27;s support for education led to recognition on virtually every Alabama college campus. The Office of the President, Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost, Vice President for Business and Financial Affairs, Human Resources, and the College of Arts, Sciences, and Engineering are housed in the building.

Coby Hall was donated to the university in 1990 by David Brubaker in memory of his wife, Coby Stockard Brubaker. Built by John Simpson on the site of his earlier home in 1843, the Simpson House/Irvine Place, as it had been known, later was purchased by George W. Foster, builder of Courtview, for his daughter, Virginia, and her husband, James B. Irvine. The University Admissions office is located in the building. Coby Hall is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
The Robert M. Guillot University Center is named after UNA&#x27;s former president, who served from 1972 to 1989. Popularly known as the &quot;GUC,&quot; it houses the Post Office, 256 Grill, Moe&#x27;s Southwest Grill, Panda Express and the Lion&#x27;s Den Game Room. The GUC also houses the Student Engagement Office, the Vice President for Student Affairs Office, Student Conduct, Title IX, University Case Manager, Career Planning, the University Center Operations and Event Management Office, Disability Student Services, UNA Dining, Military and Veterans Services, University Ombudsman, Division of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, PMA Program and the Student Government Association. The Performance Center, located on the second floor, hosts a variety of events including concerts and comedy acts.


The Memorial Amphitheater, erected in 1934 as a memorial to World War I veterans, is used for outdoor plays, concerts and speeches. Much like the nearby Guillot Center, it is a popular site for socializing, lounging and studying between classes.

Originally a men&#x27;s dormitory, Keller Hall, constructed in 1947, is named after James Albert Keller, who served as president of Florence State Teachers College from 1938 to 1948. Keller Hall serves as the headquarters of UNA&#x27;s College of Business &amp; Technology, housing the dean, faculty offices, computer labs and classrooms, as well as the Steele Center for Professional Selling. Keller Hall underwent a significant expansion following dedication of the Raburn Wing in 2002. This new addition provides state-of-the-art classrooms and related space for the College of Business &amp; Technology.

Originally a women&#x27;s dormitory, Willingham Hall, named after long-serving President Henry J. Willingham, was constructed by the Works Projects Administration in 1939. Willingham Hall houses the Department of English, the Department of History, and the Department of Politics, Justice, Law, and Philosophy.
The President&#x27;s Home, completed in 1941, was constructed by the Works Projects Administration. Occupied by President and Mrs. Kenneth Kitts, the residence is located next to the George H. Carroll Lion Habitat, home of Leo III and Una, the university&#x27;s live lion mascots. Overnight guests often were awakened by the lions&#x27; roaring.
===Residences===
Mattielou and Olive residence halls were completed in fall 2015 and spring 2016, respectively. The new residence halls are located on the extreme north end of campus, behind Covington and Hawthorne halls. Mattielou has 335 spaces and Olive has 429 spaces. These buildings were built primarily for incoming freshmen students. There are double and limited single rooms and each unit has its own bathroom.

Collier Library is the location of the George Lindsey Television and Film Collection, part of which is displayed in Norton Auditorium. In 2018 the library launched the UNA Scholarly Repository, a digital repository of the research and scholarly output of UNA faculty and students.
===International emphasis===
According to the tenth edition of American Universities and Colleges, published in 1968 by the American Council on Education, the University of North Alabama, then known as Florence State College, had only three international students enrolled during the 1966–1967 academic year — two undergraduate students and one graduate student, all from the Middle East. However, during the Robert Potts administration, UNA undertook a concerted effort to diversify its student body by recruiting individuals from throughout the world. By 2004, international enrollment had grown to nearly 300 students representing 35 countries.

Today, UNA has the third highest international student enrollment of any institution in its category according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s America&#x27;s Best Colleges. Roughly 4 percent of the UNA student body is international. The Global Lions Organization has become one of the largest and most influential student organizations on campus. A major focus of the GLO is organizing campus and community activities to integrate international students more closely with other UNA students and also with the surrounding Shoals community.

== Student body ==
The table below displays the Fall 2021 Gender/Ethnic Breakdown of Students for the University of North Alabama.
Full-time, four-year undergraduates comprise a large amount of the total university enrollment. In Fall 2021, 72% of all students were considered full-time and 28% were considered part-time. Total enrollment for the Fall 2021 semester was 8,832. Total enrollment for the Fall 2020 semester was 8,361. In regards to source of student, 70.5% of students came from within the state of Alabama, 21.0% were from out-of-state areas, and 8.5% were considered international students in Fall 2021.

==Media==

*The &quot;Diorama&quot;, UNA&#x27;s student-run yearbook.
*&quot;The Flor-Ala&quot;, named after Florence, Alabama, has functioned as the school newspaper since 1931. Published in 29 issues each year, the paper is run by UNA students who serve in all facets of news gathering, writing and production. The Flor-Ala is a member of the Associated Collegiate Press.
*&quot;Lights &amp; Shadows&quot;, published once a year, is the university&#x27;s literary and art magazine, and was started as a publication of the Florence State Teachers College English Club in 1956.
*&quot;UNA Magazine&quot;, UNA&#x27;s alumni magazine, is published bi-annually.

==Athletics==
UNA operated a collegiate athletic program in NCAA Division II&#x27;s Gulf South Conference for almost fifty years as a founding member of the conference. The North Alabama Lions football, men&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s volleyball, and softball teams have each won national championships.

UNA operates 14 varsity teams, which have collected more than 40 conference championships, dozens of No. 1 national rankings and seven national titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Championships/Post-Season&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It also possesses the oldest costume mascot program in the state of Alabama. 

As of July 1, 2018, UNA began its transition to Division I as a member of the ASUN Conference in 2018. Because the ASUN did not sponsor football at the time, the football team became an independent in the second level of D-I football, the Football Championship Subdivision, at the same time. The following year, UNA became a football-only member of the FCS Big South Conference. The Lions remained in Big South football through the 2020–21 season, after which the ASUN entered into a football-only alliance with the Western Athletic Conference, which reinstated football at the FCS level in fall 2021. The Lions now play football in the successor to the ASUN–WAC alliance, the football-only United Athletic Conference.

==Greek life==
The university&#x27;s embryonic Greek community initially was housed in O&#x27;Neal Hall, which was demolished in the 1980s to clear space for the construction of the Guillot University Center.

===Fraternities and Sororities===

After more than two generations, UNA Greek life is alive and well, even though fraternities and sororities combined represent slightly less than 10 percent of the undergraduate student population. Despite these comparatively small numbers, Greeks historically have exerted a major influence on virtually every facet of student life at UNA.

==Student life==
===School colors===
Purple and gold are the school colors of the University of North Alabama. While they are a ubiquitous sight on campus and especially at UNA athletic events, no one has ever ascertained who or what inspired their adoption. Little in the school archives accounts for the origin of these colors, according to Cecil Nabors, a UNA archivist and associate professor. All that is certain is that the 1912 yearbook, published the same year as inauguration of the football team, was named the &quot;Purple and Gold.&quot;

===UNA Fight Song===

The &quot;UNA Fight Song&quot; is the fight song of the University of North Alabama, and is played by the Marching Pride of North Alabama. The song is based on one of three songs called &quot;Three School Songs,&quot; which was published in the 1960s. The lyrics were chosen by band members in the late 1970s.

===&quot;Lion Pride&quot; and &quot;Pride Rock&quot;===

&quot;Lion Pride&quot; is a term frequently used by members of the UNA community to describe commitment to school traditions and activities reflected among students, alumni and friends of the university.

The university&#x27;s Pride Rock tradition began in 1994. Pride Rock is a 69-pound, engraved granite stone bearing the actual paw print of Leo II, UNA&#x27;s second live lion mascot. Placed just behind the north end zone of all UNA home games, Pride Rock is touched by players as they file past on their way to the field. Pride Rock serves not only as a motivational tool for the players but also as a tangible expression of the deep well of pride, community and tradition associated with the University of North Alabama and particularly with its athletic program.

===Mascots===

On July 22, 1974, former UNA president Robert M. Guillot brought a lion cub to the campus and Leo I spent the next 14 years &quot;roaring&quot; the school to victory. The original Leo died on January 20, 1988, and a great outpouring of support from the Shoals community resulted in Leo II being brought to UNA in July 1988. Leo II lived in the compound that once housed the original Leo. In 1997, Leo II was selected as the nation&#x27;s &quot;Second Best Mascot&quot; by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. He died in February 2000. Leo III was born on November 18, 2002, and resided on the campus in the George H. Carroll Lion Habitat. Leo III had lived on campus with his sister, Una, who died on June 30, 2020. He died in 2024.

====Traditional mascots====
Leo and Una, the mascots of the University of North Alabama, are two anthropomorphic lion siblings. Leo&#x27;s name is taken from the Latin word for lion, and Una is named after the common abbreviation of the university&#x27;s name. Leo is described as more of a comedic character, while Una&#x27;s personality leans more towards being cute. The earliest usage of UNA&#x27;s character mascot (also called Leo) is in an article from the January 1949 edition of the Flor-Ala, describing him as a &quot;cartoon&quot; to be used in that years issue of the Diorama.

The exact date of the debut of Leo as a costume mascot is unknown, however, the earliest recorded mention was from another article of the Flor-Ala from November 6, 1961, portrayed at the time by Claude Hunt, who initiated efforts to begin a mascot program at the university. The original suit was made if a head created by the Art Department of the University, and a body made by Hunt&#x27;s mother. Prior to the advent of Una in 2008, Leo&#x27;s original female counterpart was a lioness with a much simpler design, called Leona. Around 1975, the year following the acquisition of the university&#x27;s first live lion, the mascot program was done away with. Just as efforts by a student began the program, though, a push by a student named Ramona Sutton would revive Leo, but not Leona, in 1979. As the original costume was no longer in usable condition, a new one would be created. A more realistic design would be used from 1985 to 1995. Two new costumes were produced in 2009 based on a design by a staff member named Walt Vandiver, including the first costume for Una. After one more change in design, the university would mark 75 years since the creation of the mascot on January 19, 2024.
===Miss UNA Scholarship Pageant===

The Miss UNA Scholarship Pageant is an official preliminary for the Miss Alabama/Miss America Pageant. The Miss UNA Scholarship pageant has been a UNA tradition for over 31 years. The pageant provides an opportunity for the university&#x27;s young women to compete in the following categories for scholarship money and prizes. In 2007 over $12,000 in scholarships and prizes was awarded to the contestants. Each young woman is encouraged and mentored to develop skills that will enrich her personal and professional life beyond her university experience. Miss University of North Alabama spends her year in service to the university and Shoals Area community. She promotes the platform of her choice, makes official appearances as a university representative, and represents the university at the Miss Alabama Scholarship Pageant.

===Spirit Hill Tailgating and Lion Walk===
Within the past few years, pregame tailgating at Spirit Hill, an area adjoining Braly Municipal Stadium, has developed into a major UNA tradition, thanks largely to the efforts of former Athletic Director Joel Erdmann. Erdmann enlisted the UNA Greek community, general student organizations and alumni to expand this tradition, which had been lacking.

Along with former head UNA football Coach Mark Hudspeth, Erdmann also was instrumental in developing the highly popular Lion Walk, a pregame parade down Royal Avenue (next to Spirit Hill) that includes Lion athletes, cheerleaders and the Marching Pride of North Alabama. The parade is held before every UNA home game.

===UNA&#x27;s Marching Pride of North Alabama===
The Marching Pride of North Alabama was founded in 1949. The Marching Band has represented the university at many different events since, including a performance for President Jimmy Carter during his historic 1980 visit to neighboring Tuscumbia.

The band also appeared in the award-winning movie, Blue Sky, starring Jessica Lange, Tommy Lee Jones and Powers Boothe. The Marching Band also has recorded a CD with famed musician and producer Jimmy Johnson.

With more than 210 members, the group is the largest organization on campus and serves as a major contributor to school spirit, especially at athletic events. The UNA Marching Band performs at all home football games, local parades and travels the state performing in exhibition at high school competitions. They are known for precision marching and drill design, while entertaining with strongly played jazz standards.

===Step Sing===

In the spring, Step Sing is a well-attended event in Norton Auditorium sponsored by the University Program Council featuring take-offs of musical comedy production numbers by campus organizations. Money raised from ticket sales supports the local United Way.

==Notable people==
Alumni and other former students of the University of North Alabama include business leaders; a number of governors, congressmen and other government and military leaders; professional athletes; artists and entertainers.

<doc id="499479" wikidata="Q700842" url="?curid=499479" title="Former eastern territories of Germany">
<text>In present-day Germany, the former eastern territories of Germany () refer to those territories east of the current eastern border of Germany, i.e. the Oder–Neisse line, which historically had been considered German and which were annexed by Poland and the Soviet Union after World War II. In contrast to the lands awarded to the restored Polish state by the Treaty of Versailles after World War I, the German territories lost with the post-World War II Potsdam Agreement were either almost exclusively inhabited by Germans before 1945 (the bulk of East Prussia, Lower Silesia, Farther Pomerania, and parts of Western Pomerania, Lusatia, and Neumark), mixed German–Polish with a German majority (the Posen–West Prussia Border March, Lauenburg and Bütow Land, the southern and western rim of East Prussia, Ermland, Western Upper Silesia, and the part of Lower Silesia east of the Oder), or mixed German–Czech with a German majority (Glatz). Virtually the entire German population of the territories that did not flee voluntarily in the face of the Red Army advance of 1945, was violently expelled to Germany, with their possessions being forcibly expropriated.

The ceding of the east German lands to Poland was done in large part to compensate Poland for losing the Kresy lands east of the Curzon line, a region that was annexed by the Soviet Union after the German invasion of Poland in 1939. This territory had large populations of Ukrainians, Belarusians and Lithuanians – the main ethnic groups of three of the western republics of the Soviet Union – and many towns that were primarily inhabited by Poles and Jews. The Jewish communities in this region were mostly exterminated in the Holocaust and the Polish communities were mostly expelled to the restored Polish state after World War II, the communist-ruled Polish People&#x27;s Republic. Poles from the northern part of Kresy were primarily resettled in Pomerania and Poles from Galicia were primarily resettled in Silesia, e.g. the Ossolineum and the Jan Kazimierz University in Lwów were both relocated to Wrocław, the former Breslau.

The territories acquired by Poland after World War II are known there as the Recovered Territories. The territories Poland annexed had been ruled as part of Poland by the Piast dynasty in the High Middle Ages, with the exception of southern East Prussia, which originally was inhabited by Old Prussians and came under Polish suzerainty in the Late Middle Ages. The northern part of East Prussia was annexed by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic as the Kaliningrad Oblast, now forming a Russian exclave.

The post-war border between Germany and Poland along the Oder–Neisse line was defined in August 1945 by the Potsdam Agreement of the leaders of the three main Allies of World War II, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States; and was formally recognized by East Germany in 1950, by the Treaty of Zgorzelec, under pressure from Stalin. In 1952, recognition of the Oder–Neisse line as a permanent boundary was one of Stalin&#x27;s conditions for the Soviet Union to agree to a reunification of Germany (see Stalin Note). The offer was rejected by Konrad Adenauer, Chancellor of West Germany, at least in part because one of Stalin&#x27;s other conditions was for Germany to never join NATO (similarly to Austria). The then official West German government position on the status of the former territories of Germany east of the Oder and Neisse rivers was that the areas were &quot;temporarily under Polish [or Soviet] administration&quot;, because the border regulation at the Potsdam Conference had been taken as preliminary provisions to be revisited at a final peace conference which, due to the Cold War, had been indefinitely postponed; however, West Germany in 1972 recognised the Oder–Neisse line as the western boundary of Poland when the 1970 Treaty of Warsaw between West Germany and Poland took effect; and in 1973, the Federal Constitutional Court acknowledged the capability of East Germany to negotiate the Treaty of Zgorzelec as an international agreement binding as a legal definition of its boundaries. In signing the Helsinki Final Act in 1975, both West Germany and East Germany recognised the existing boundaries of post-war Europe, including the Oder–Neisse line, as valid in international law.

In 1990, as part of the reunification of Germany, both German countries accepted clauses in the peace treaty with the four countries representing the Allies (Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany) to replace the Potsdam Agreement, whereby Germany renounced all claims to territory outside East and West Germany. As the result of this treaty, Germany&#x27;s recognition of the Oder–Neisse line as the border was formalised by the re-united Germany in the German–Polish Border Treaty on 14 November 1990 and by the repeal of Article 23 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany under which German states outside the Federal Republic could formerly have declared their accession. Germany went from a territory of 468,787 km before the 1938 annexation of Austria to 357,022 km after the 1990 reunification of Germany, a loss of 24%. Despite its acquisition of the formerly German territory, the war also saw Poland&#x27;s territory reduced by about 20% overall because of its losses in the east to the Soviets.

== The territories ==

=== Farther Pomerania and parts of Western Pomerania===
Farther Pomerania comprised the eastern part of the Prussian Province of Pomerania. It stretched roughly from the Oder River in the west to Pomerelia in the east, and roughly corresponds to today&#x27;s Polish West Pomeranian Voivodeship. Along with Farther Pomerania, a small area of Western Pomerania including Stettin (now Szczecin) and Swinemünde (now Świnoujście) was transferred to Poland in 1945.

The Pomeranian parts of the former eastern territories of Germany had been under Polish rule several times from the late 10th century on, when Mieszko I acquired at least significant parts of them. Mieszko&#x27;s son Bolesław I established a bishopric in the Kołobrzeg area in 1000–1005–07, before the area was lost by Poland again to pagan Slavic tribes.

The Duchy of Pomerania was established as a vassal state of Poland in 1121, which it remained until the fragmentation of Poland after the death of Polish ruler Bolesław III Wrymouth in 1138. The Dukes of Pomerania then became independent, and later were vassals of the Duchy of Saxony from 1164 to 1181, of the Holy Roman Empire from 1181 to 1185, of Denmark from 1185 to 1227 and finally, from 1227 on, were under the Holy Roman Empire (including periods of vassalage to the Margraves of Brandenburg). By the end of the Middle Ages, because of an influx of Germanic settlers, the assimilation of the Slavic population, the introduction of German town law, the influence of Germanic customs, and the trade of the Hanse, the area had been largely Germanized.

Following the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, Farther Pomerania became part of Brandenburg–Prussia. In 1772 the Lauenburg and Bütow Land and the former Starostwo of Draheim were annexed by the King in Prussia and integrated into the Province of Pomerania of the Kingdom of Prussia, though not into the Holy Roman Empire, and did not become part of Germany until being included in the German Confederation in 1815. After the Napoleonic Wars, Swedish Pomerania was merged into the Prussian province in 1815, both now constituting the Province of Pomerania. In 1938, the northern part of the dissolved Grenzmark Posen-West Prussia became part of the province.

At the turn of the 20th century, the total population of the province of almost 1.7 million inhabitants had a Polish-speaking minority of less than 1%.

=== East Brandenburg (Neumark) ===

The medieval Lubusz Land, on both sides of the Oder River up to the Spree in the west, including Lubusz (Lebus) itself, also formed part of Mieszko&#x27;s realm. Poland lost Lubusz when the Silesian duke Bolesław II Rogatka sold it to the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg in 1249. Brandenburg also acquired the castellany of Santok from Duke Przemysł I of Greater Poland and made it the nucleus of its Neumark (&quot;New March&quot;) region. The Bishopric of Lebus remained a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Gniezno until 1424, when it passed under the jurisdiction of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg. The Lubusz Land was part of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown from 1373 to 1415.

=== Silesia, Kłodzko Land and Eastern Lusatia ===
After Germanic tribes left the area in the Migration Period, Lechitic tribes began to settle Silesia, while Lusatia was settled by the Milceni and the Polabian Slavs and the Kłodzko Land was settled by Bohemians. In the 10th century Mieszko I of Poland made Silesia part of his realm. From the 10th century to the 12th century, Silesia, Lusatia and the Kłodzko Land were contested between Bohemia and Poland. Several independent duchies formed, and eventually some attached themselves to the Kingdom of Bohemia, an electorate of the Holy Roman Empire, while the Kłodzko Land became a constituent part of the kingdom itself. In the 14th century, the Treaty of Namysłów had King Casimir III the Great give up all Polish claims to Silesia and ceded the Duchies of Silesia to the Lands of the Bohemian Crown. Ecclesiastically, the Diocese of Wrocław covering Silesia remained a suffragan of the Polish Archdiocese of Gniezno until becoming exempt in 1821.

The first German colonists arrived in the late 12th century, and large-scale German settlement started in the early 13th century during the reign of Henry I. New forms of agriculture, technology and law brought in by the German settlers, took root in the region, also benefiting the Slavic population. By the late 14th century, 130 towns and 1300 villages had adopted German law. Silesian cities such as Jelenia Góra (Hirschberg), Lwówek Śląski (Löwenberg) and Złotoryja (Goldberg) had typical architecture, being centered around a central square, the ring, which became known in Polish as &quot;rynek&quot;. German craftsmen and miners also started settling the region&#x27;s mountainous areas.

The Bohemian Lands were under the rule of the House of Jagiellon in personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary until the Battle of Mohács in 1526. Afterwards, they were ruled in personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary and the Archduchy of Austria by the Holy Roman Emperors of the House of Habsburg, finally ceasing &quot;de facto&quot; (but not &quot;de jure&quot;) to exist as a separate realm and becoming a part of the Habsburg monarchy in the aftermath of the Bohemian Revolt&#x27;s defeat in the Battle of White Mountain. After losing the 18th-century Silesian Wars, the Habsburg monarchy was forced to cede most of the region to the Kingdom of Prussia in the treaties of Breslau and of Berlin, retaining only Austrian Silesia. The ceded lands also included the (sometimes considered Moravian) territories of the Duchies of Troppau and of Krnov north of the Opava river, as well as the strategically important Kłodzko Land, a part of the core territory of the Kingdom of Bohemia.

As the result of the peaceful influx of German-speakers, Lusatia, Silesia and the Kłodzko Land became predominantly German-speaking. Czech continued to be spoken in parts of Austrian Silesia, in the Hlučín Region of Upper Silesia and in the western part of the Kłodzko Land (Czech Corner). Sorbian was spoken in parts of Lusatia, while Polish prevailed in Middle Silesia north of the Oder river, in parts of Austrian Silesia and in Upper Silesia. In the latter case, the Germans who arrived during the Middle Ages became mostly Polonised, especially with the advent of the industrial revolution which created employment and business opportunities, attracting numerous Poles to the area. In contrast the Polish-speaking parts of Lower and Middle Silesia, commonly described until the late 19th century as the &quot;Polish side&quot;, were mostly Germanised in the 18th and 19th centuries, except for a few patches and a larger area along the northeastern frontier.

=== East Prussia, including Warmia, and the Klaipėda Region ===
Originally inhabited mainly by the pagan Old Prussians, the regions were conquered and incorporated into the state of the Teutonic Knights in the 13th and 14th centuries. Under the Teutonic Order, the region&#x27;s towns were founded, woodlands were cleared and marshlands made arable to be settled by colonists, predominantly from German-speaking areas but also from neighboring Polish and Lithuanian lands. The area became predominantly German during the Ostsiedlung, either almost exclusively (Sambia, Natangia, and Bartia together forming the central part of the region), mixed German-Lithuanian (the North-Eastern part called Lithuania Minor including Sudovia, Nadrovia and Scalovia), or mixed German–Polish (Masurians, Warmiacy) comprising the southern (Sasna and Galindia, together forming Masuria) and western (Warmia, Pomesania, and Pogesania, the latter two together forming Powiśle) rim of the region. By the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), Warmia and the Malbork Land (comprising northern parts of Pomesania and Pogesania) became subject to the Polish Crown as a part of Royal Prussia, a region initially holding considerable autonomy and continuing to use the German language as official, but ultimately becoming fully integrated with the Crown of Poland upon conclusion of the Union of Lublin. Masuria and the southern part of Pomesania and Pogesania stayed part of the rump Teutonic state (called thereafter &quot;Monastic Prussia&quot; or &quot;Teutonic Prussia&quot;) which became a German fief of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, finally secularised in 1525 to become the Ducal Prussia. The latter later emancipated, taking advantage of the Russo-Swedish Deluge, and merged with the Electorate of Brandenburg to form Brandenburg–Prussia, shortly thereafter becoming a kingdom. Subsequently, it entered into an alliance with Austria and Russia, invading Polish territories of Royal Prussia in the First Partition of Poland (1772), with Warmia being made part of the newly formed province of East Prussia in 1773. As a result of the Treaty of Versailles, a minor part around Soldau was transferred to Poland, the Klaipėda Region formed a free city supervised by the League of Nations, annexed following the Klaipėda Revolt by Lithuania but reclaimed by Germany in 1938, while the bulk (including entire Warmia and Masuria) remained a part of Germany, following the East Prussian plebiscite, and became enlarged by the addition of the formerly West Prussian Malbork Land.

== Other uses and definitions of the term ==
In the Potsdam Agreement the description of the territories transferred is &quot;The former German territories east of the Oder–Neisse line&quot;, and permutations on this description are the most commonly used to describe any former territories of interwar Germany east of the Oder–Neisse line.

The term has sometimes been confused with the name East Germany, a political term, used to be the common colloquial English name for the German Democratic Republic (GDR), and mirrored the common colloquial English term for the other German state of West Germany. When focusing on the period before World War II, &quot;eastern Germany&quot; is used to describe all the territories east of the Elbe (East Elbia), as reflected in the works of sociologist Max Weber and political theorist Carl Schmitt, but because of the border changes in the 20th century, after World War II the term &quot;East Germany&quot; and eastern Germany in English has meant the territory of the German Democratic Republic.

In German, only one corresponding term &quot;Ostdeutschland&quot; exists, meaning both East Germany and Eastern Germany. The rather ambiguous German term never gained as widespread use for the GDR during its existence, as did the English designation, or the derived demonym &quot;Ossi&quot; (Eastie), and only following the German reunification has it started to be commonly used to denote both the historic post-war German Democratic Republic, and its counterpart five successor states in the current reunited Germany. However, because people and institutions in the states traditionally considered as Middle Germany, like the three southern new states Saxony-Anhalt, the Free State of Saxony and the Free State of Thuringia, still use the term Middle Germany when referring to their area and its institutions, the term &quot;Ostdeutschland&quot; is still ambiguous.

== Historical outline ==

=== Early history, Kingdom of Poland, Teutonic Order State, Lands of the Bohemian Crown and the Holy Roman Empire ===
As various Germanic tribes had left present-day Poland and East Germany, West Slavic tribes moved to these places from the 6th century onward. Duke Mieszko I of the Polans, from his stronghold in the Gniezno area, united various neighboring tribes in the second half of the 10th century, formed the first Polish state and became the first historically recorded Piast duke. His realm bordered the German state, and control over the borderlands would shift back and forth between the two polities over the centuries to come.

Mieszko&#x27;s son and successor, king Bolesław I Chrobry, upon the 1018 Peace of Bautzen expanded the southern part of the realm but lost control over the lands of Western Pomerania on the Baltic coast. After pagan revolts and a Bohemian invasion in the 1030s, Duke Casimir I the Restorer (reigned 1040–1058) again united most of the former Piast realm, including Silesia and Lubusz Land, on both sides of the middle Oder River but without Western Pomerania, which returned to of the Polish state only under Bolesław III Wrymouth from 1116 to 1121, when the noble House of Griffins established the Duchy of Pomerania. On Bolesław&#x27;s death in 1138, Poland was for almost 200 years was subjected to fragmentation and ruled by Bolesław&#x27;s sons and by their successors, who were often in conflict with one another. Władysław I the Elbow-high, who was crowned king of Poland in 1320, achieved a partial reunification, but the Silesian and Masovian duchies remained independent Piast holdings.

In the 12th to the 14th centuries, German settlers, most of whom spoke Low German, moved into Central and Eastern Europe in a migration process known as the &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot;, and the Hanseatic League dominated the shores of the Baltic Sea. In Pomerania, Brandenburg, East Prussia, Lusatia, Kłodzko Land and Lower Silesia, the former West Slav (Bohemians, Polabian Slavs and Poles) or Baltic population became minorities in the course of the following centuries, but substantial numbers of them remained in areas such as Upper Silesia. In Greater Poland and in Eastern Pomerania (Pomerelia), German settlers always remained a minority. Some of the territories, such as Pomerelia and Masovia, reunited with Poland during the 15th and 16th centuries. Silesia, Lubusz Land and Lusatia (as parts of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown) and the Duchy of Pomerania became more firmly incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire.

===Partitions of Poland, Kingdom of Prussia, Duchy of Warsaw, Austrian Empire, Grand Duchy of Posen and German Confederation===

In the course of the Partitions of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Kingdom of Prussia and the Austrian Empire acquired vast territorial shares of the demised Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. During the Napoleonic era the Greater Polish territories and the Chełmno Land formed part of the Duchy of Warsaw following the Treaties of Tilsit, and Danzig was granted a status of a Free City. However, after the Congress of Vienna, the Polish duchy was again partitioned between Russia and Prussia. The Congress of Vienna established as a replacement for the dissolved Holy Roman Empire the German Confederation (German: Deutscher Bund), an association of 39 German-speaking states in Central Europe under the nominal leadership of the Austrian Empire. Its boundaries largely followed the ones of its predecessor, the Holy Roman Empire, defining the territory of Germany for much of the 19th century and confirming Pomerania, East Brandenburg and Silesia as its parts. On the other hand, the remaining parts of the lands ruled by the House of Hohenzollern which were not included in the Holy Roman Empire, namely the German-speaking Prussian nucleus (East Prussia), and the newly acquired predominantly Polish- or Kashubian-speaking territorial share of the collapsed and dismembered Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (Grand Duchy of Posen and West Prussia), continued as external to the Confederation (a failed attempt to include these lands in the German Empire (1848–49) was undertaken by the Frankfurt Parliament), as did the Austrian-held partition of Poland (the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria), Transleithania, as well as the German-speaking cantons of Switzerland and the French region of Alsace.

===North German Confederation, German Empire, and Austria-Hungary===

In the following years, Prussia superseded Austria in the role of the primary driving force of the restoration of German unity and secured this position by abolishing the German Confederation in the Peace of Prague. Austria was in turn transformed into poly-ethnic Austria-Hungary, abstained from further German unification efforts and abandoned forced Germanization.

Thus, the planned German unification was to be accomplished in the Lesser German solution version. With rise of nationalism, the eastern Hohenzollern-ruled territories with a predominantly Polish population (especially the formerly Polish territories of Posen and West Prussia) increasingly became a target of aggressive Germanisation efforts, German settlement, anti-Catholic campaigns (Kulturkampf), as well as disfranchisement and expropriations of Poles, and finally annexed following the North German Confederation Treaty (1866). At the time of German Unification in 1871, the Kingdom of Prussia was the largest and dominant part of the North German Confederation, the predecessor of the newly formed German Empire.

===Weimar Republic, Second Polish Republic, First Czechoslovak Republic, Free City of Danzig, and Klaipėda Region===

The Treaty of Versailles of 1919, which ended the war, restored the independence of Poland, known as the Second Polish Republic, and Germany was compelled to cede territories to it, most of which were taken by Prussia in the three Partitions of Poland and had been part of the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire for the 100 years of the non-existence of Polish state. The territories retroceded to Poland in 1919 were those with a Polish majority, such as Greater Poland, as well as Pomerelia, historically the part of Poland providing its access to the sea. Restoration of Pomerelia to Poland meant the loss of Germany&#x27;s territorial contiguousness to East Prussia making it an exclave.

Most of the eastern territories with a predominantly or almost exclusively German population (East Brandenburg, East Prussia, Hither and Farther Pomerania, and the bulk of Silesia) remained with Germany. The historically Polish and strategically vital for Poland but predominantly German-speaking city of Danzig formed henceforth with its surrounding areas the Free City of Danzig, a self-governing territory supervised by the League of Nations, albeit bound in some aspects by an imposed union with Poland.

However, in areas such as Upper Silesia, no clear division between the mostly bilingual population was possible. After a first plebiscite, Upper Silesia was to stay part of Germany&#x27;s territory. However, after the Silesian Uprisings, the area was divided in accord with the German–Polish Convention regarding Upper Silesia.

The parts of the former province of Posen and of West Prussia that were not restored as part of the Second Polish Republic were administered as Grenzmark Posen-Westpreußen (the German Province of Posen–West Prussia) until 1939.

===Nazi Germany===
The defeat of Germany and the imposed terms of peace left a sense of injustice among the population. The subsequent interwar economic crisis acted as a fertile ground for irredentist claims that the territory ceded to Poland, Czechoslovakia and Lithuania in 1919–1922 should be returned to Germany, which paved the way for the Nazi takeover of the government.

In October 1938 Hlučín Area (&quot;Hlučínsko&quot; in Czech, &quot;Hultschiner Ländchen&quot; in German) of Moravian-Silesian Region, which had been ceded to Czechoslovakia under the Treaty of Versailles, was annexed by the Third Reich as a part of areas lost by Czechoslovakia under the Munich agreement. However, as distinct from other lost Czechoslovakian domains, it was not attached to Sudetengau (the administrative region covering the Sudetenland) but to Prussia (Upper Silesia).

By late 1938, Lithuania had lost control over the situation in the Memel Territory, which had been annexed by Lithuania in the Klaipėda putsch. In the early hours of 23 March 1939, after a political ultimatum caused a Lithuanian delegation to travel to Berlin, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Juozas Urbšys and German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop signed the &quot;Treaty of the Cession of the Memel Territory to Germany&quot; in exchange for a Lithuanian Free Zone in the port of Memel that used the facilities erected in the previous years.

In the interwar period, the German administration, both Weimar and Nazi, conducted a massive campaign of renaming of thousands of placenames, to remove traces of Polish, Lithuanian and Old Prussian origin.

=== Second World War and the German occupation of Poland, 1939–1945 ===
Germany invaded Poland without a declaration of war on 1 September 1939, heralding the start of the Second World War. The Third Reich at first annexed the lands of the Second Polish Republic up to the Congress of Vienna borders (1815-1918). After Hitler&#x27;s call for an international peace conference on Poland&#x27;s borders in his 6 October 1939 Reichstag speech was rejected by both Édouard Daladier and Neville Chamberlain, another stripe of Polish lands was annexed.

All annexed territories comprised Pomerelia (the &quot;Polish Corridor&quot;), Chełmno Land, Greater Poland proper, Kuyavia, Łęczyca Land, Sieradz Land, Northern Masovia, as well as the parts of Upper Silesia located in Poland, including the former Czechoslovak part of Cieszyn Silesia annexed by Poland in 1938. The Senate of the Free City of Danzig, elected by the Volkstag already also dominated by the Nazi Party at that time, voted to become a part of Germany again, but Poles and Jews were deprived of their voting rights and all non-Nazi political parties were banned.

Two decrees by Adolf Hitler (8 and 12 October 1939) divided the annexed areas of Poland into administrative units:
* Reichsgau Wartheland (initially Reichsgau Posen), which included the entire Poznań Voivodeship, most of the Łódź Voivodeship, five counties of the Pomeranian Voivodeship, and one county of the Warszawa Voivodeship;
* Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia (initially Reichsgau West Prussia), which consisted of the remaining area of the Pomeranian Voivodeship and the Free City of Danzig;
* Ciechanów District (Regierungsbezirk Zichenau), consisting of the five northern counties of Warszawa Voivodeship (Płock, Płońsk, Sierpc, Ciechanów, and Mława), which became a part of East Prussia;
* Katowice District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz), or East Upper Silesia (&quot;Ost-Oberschlesien&quot;), which included Sosnowiec, Będzin, Chrzanów, and Zawiercie Counties, and parts of Olkusz and Żywiec Counties.

The territories had an area of 94,000 km and a population of 10,000,000. Throughout the war, the annexed Polish territories were subject to German colonisation. Because of the lack of settlers from Germany itself, the colonists were primarily ethnic Germans relocated from other parts of Eastern Europe. The ethnic Germans were then resettled in homes from which the Poles had been expelled.

The remainder of Polish territory was annexed by the Soviet Union (see Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact) or made into the German-controlled General Government occupation zone.

After the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, the district of Białystok, which included the Białystok, Bielsk Podlaski, Grajewo, Łomża, Sokółka, Volkovysk and Grodno counties, was &quot;attached to&quot; but not incorporated into East Prussia, and Eastern Galicia (District of Galicia), which included the cities of Lwów, Stanislawów and Tarnopol, was made part of the General Government.

===Yalta Conference===
The final decision to move Poland&#x27;s boundary westward was made by the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference in February 1945, shortly before the end of the war. The precise location of the border was left open, and the western Allies also accepted in general the principles of the Oder River being the future western border of Poland and of population transfer being the way to prevent future border disputes. The open questions were whether the border should follow the Eastern or Lusatian Neisse rivers and whether Stettin, the traditional seaport of Berlin, should remain in Germany or be included in Poland.

Originally, Germany was to retain Stettin, and the Poles were to annex &quot;all&quot; of East Prussia with Königsberg. Eventually, however, Stalin decided to keep Königsberg for strategic grounds (it would also be a year-round warm-water port for the Soviet Navy) and argued that the Poles should receive Stettin instead. The wartime Polish government-in-exile had little say in the decisions.

The Yalta Conference agreed to split Germany into four occupation zones after the war. The status of Poland was discussed but this was complicated by the fact that Poland was then controlled by the Red Army. The conference agreed to reorganise the Provisionary Polish Government, which had been set up by the Red Army, by the inclusion of some politicians of the Polish government-in-exile, and to transform it into the Provisional Government of National Unity, with an unfulfilled promise to hold democratic and fair elections. That effectively ended the international recognition of the Polish government-in-exile, which had been evacuated in 1939. The conference agreed that the Polish eastern border would follow the Curzon Line and that Poland would receive substantial territorial compensation in the west from Germany, but the exact border was to be determined later. A &quot;Committee on Dismemberment of Germany&quot; was to be set up to decide whether Germany was to be divided into six nations and, if so, what borders and interrelations the new German states would have.

To pressure the Western Allies regarding the verbal commitments of Tehran and Yalta, the Soviets began transferring regions east of the Oder–Neisse line to Polish control, although these areas were still officially part of the Soviet occupation zone of Germany. The US government strongly protested to the unilateral implementation of a Polish government in these areas.

===Potsdam Agreement, 1945===

After World War II, several memoranda of the US State Department warned against awarding Poland such extensive lands, apprehensive of creation of new long-standing tension in the area. In particular, the State Department acknowledged that Polish claims to Lower Silesia had no ethnic or historic justification.

Under Stalin&#x27;s pressure, the Potsdam Conference, held from 17 July until 2 August 1945, placed all of the areas east of the Oder–Neisse line, whether recognised by the international community as part of Germany until 1939 or occupied by Germany during World War II, under the jurisdiction of other countries, pending a final Peace Conference.

The Allies also agreed that:
because in the words of Winston Churchill

The problem with the status of these territories was that the Potsdam Agreement was not a legally binding treaty, but a memorandum between the USSR, the US and the UK (to which neither France, nor Germany or Poland were party). It regulated the issue of the eastern German border, which was confirmed as being along the Oder–Neisse line, but the final article of the memorandum said that the final decisions concerning Germany, and hence the detailed alignment of Germany&#x27;s eastern boundaries, would be subject to a separate peace treaty; at which the three Allied signatories committed themselves to respect the terms of the Potsdam memorandum. Hence, so long as these Allied Powers remained committed to the Potsdam protocols, without German agreement to an Oder–Neisse line boundary there could be no Peace Treaty and no German Reunification. The debate affected Cold War politics and diplomacy and played an important role in the negotiations leading up to the reunification of Germany in 1990.

===Expulsion of Germans and resettlement===

With the rapid advance of the Red Army in the winter of 1944–1945, German authorities desperately evacuated many Germans westwards. The majority of the remaining German-speaking population in the territory of former Czechoslovakia and east of the Oder–Neisse line (roughly 10 million in the Ostgebiete alone), that had not already been evacuated, was expelled by the new Czech and Polish administrations. Although in the post-war period earlier German sources often cited the number of evacuated and expelled Germans as 16 million and the death toll as between 1.7 and 2.5 million, those numbers are today considered by some historians to be exaggerated and the death toll more likely in a range between 400,000 and 600,000. Some present-day estimates place the numbers of German refugees at 14 million, of whom about half a million died during the evacuations and expulsions.

At the same time, Poles from central Poland, expelled Poles from former eastern Poland, Polish returnees from internment and forced labour, Ukrainians forcibly resettled in Operation Vistula, and Jewish Holocaust survivors were settled in German territories gained by Poland, whereas the north of former East Prussia (Kaliningrad Oblast gained by the USSR) was turned into a military zone and subsequently settled with Russians. The first Polish settlers in contrast experienced complete alienation from their new surroundings, perceived as fully foreign and German.

However, contrary to the official declaration that the former German inhabitants of the Recovered Territories had to be removed quickly to house Poles displaced by the Soviet annexation, the new Polish lands initially faced a severe population shortage.

Polish population transfers from the Soviet Union only amounted for 1.5 million people, while more than 8 million Germans lost their homes in the German Eastern Territories.

=== Polonization and the Treaty of Zgorzelec ===

Drawing from interwar demands by Polish nationalists (albeit far more limited), Poland&#x27;s sweeping territorial gains of German land were presented as inspired by the Piast vision of an ethnically homogeneous state within the borders of medieval Piast Poland. Fully German-speaking areas such as Lower Silesia and Farther Pomerania suffered expulsion of its entire indigenous population in 1945–46. Polonization proceeded rapidly, despite the still uncertain border.

Rather than taking over German place names, new Polish place names were determined by decree, reverting to a Slavic name or inventing a new name for places founded by German speakers. In order to establish the Piast vision in the consciousness of the population and to convince them of the historical justice of the annexation of the former German territories, the &#x27;Recovered Territories&#x27; were covered with a network of designations connected with the Piast dynasty, even if the buildings themselves had no reference to the Piast rulers.

The Polish Communists mobilized for cleansing and acculturation to de-Germanize their new home. German words were removed from buildings and even from art works, dishes, and gravesites. Meanwhile, a blatantly fraudulent referendum was held on three different questions; the third of these was whether the Polish people were in favor of the new western border. According to the official results, over 90% voted &quot;yes&quot; despite Poland having lost substantial territories in the east (the Kresy lands) as well.

The process was finalized in 1950 by the Treaty of Zgorzelec, an agreement signed under Soviet pressure by Otto Grotewohl, prime minister of the provisional government of the GDR (East Germany) and Polish premier Józef Cyrankiewicz. It recognized the Oder–Neisse line specified by the 1945 Potsdam Agreement as the border between the two states. The terms referred to the &quot;defined and existing border&quot; from the Baltic Sea west of Świnoujście – however without mentioning Szczecin – along the Oder and Lusatian Neisse rivers to the Czechoslovak border.

===West German politics in the early post-World-War-II years ===

After the war, the so-called &quot;German question&quot;, named after the 19th-century debate on German reunification, was an important factors of post-war German and European history and politics.

Between 1949 and 1970 the government of West Germany referred to these territories as &quot;former German territories temporarily under Polish and Soviet administration&quot;. This terminology was used in relation to territories of eastern Germany within the 1937 Germany border, and was based on the terminology used in the Potsdam Agreement. It was used only by the Federal Republic of Germany; but the Polish and Soviet governments objected to the obvious implication that these territories should someday revert to Germany. The Polish government preferred to use the phrase Recovered Territories, asserting a sort of continuity because parts of these territories had centuries previously been ruled by ethnic Poles.

Until 1973, the Federal Republic took a strict line in claiming an exclusive mandate for all of Germany. Under the Hallstein Doctrine, the Federal Republic broke diplomatic relations with states that maintained diplomatic relations with the GDR, except for the Soviet Union. Therefore, the government of West Germany and the Bundestag declared in 1950 the Treaty of Zgorzelec ″null and void″.

In the early history of West Germany, refugee organizations were an important political factor, demanding that Germany never renounce the land that was deemed still part of Germany. However, contrary to the official claims, the bulk of the expelleés would likely have no real intention of returning to their homeland.

===Ostpolitik and the Treaty of Warsaw===

In the 1970s, West Germany adopted &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; in foreign relations, which strove to normalise relations with its neighbours by recognising the realities of the European order of the time, and abandoning elements of the Hallstein Doctrine. West Germany also abandoned for the time being its claims with respect to German reunification, recognising the existence of the German Democratic Republic (GDR); and the validity of the Oder–Neisse line in international law.&quot; As part of this new approach, West Germany concluded friendship treaties with the Soviet Union (Treaty of Moscow (1970)), Poland (Treaty of Warsaw (1970)), East Germany (Basic Treaty (1972)) and Czechoslovakia (Treaty of Prague (1973)); and participated in the Helsinki Final Act (1975). The validity of the Treaty of Zgorzelec was explicitly confirmed in a judgement of the Federal Constitutional Court of 1973 on the Basic Treaty between East and West Germany. Nevertheless, West Germany continued its long-term objective of achieving a reunification of East Germany, West Germany and Berlin; and maintained that its formal recognition of the post-war boundaries of Germany would need to be confirmed by a united Germany in the context of a Final Settlement of the Second World War. Some West German commentators continued to maintain that neither the Treaty of Zgorzelec nor the Treaty of Warsaw should be considered as binding on a future united Germany; albeit that these reservations were intended for domestic political consumption, and the arguments advanced in support of them had no substance in international law.

The Holy See immediately acknowledged the new reality following the Treaty of Warsaw, and created new Polish dioceses in the territories with the papal bulls &quot;Episcoporum Poloniae coetus&quot; and &quot;Vratislaviensis – Berolinensis et aliarium&quot;.

=== German reunification, German–Polish Border Treaty and present status===
In 1990 Germany officially recognized its present eastern border at the time of its reunification in the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany and the German–Polish Border Treaty, ending any residual claims to sovereignty that Germany may have had over any territory east of the Oder–Neisse line. Over time, the &quot;German question&quot; has been muted by a number of related phenomena:
* The passage of time resulted in fewer people being left who have firsthand experience of living in these regions under German jurisdiction.
* In the Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany, Germany renounced all claims to territory east of the Oder–Neisse line. Germany&#x27;s recognition of the border was repeated in the German–Polish Border Treaty on 14 November 1990. The first of those treaties was made by both German states and ratified in 1991 by a united Germany. The second was already signed by the united Germany.
* The expansion of the European Union eastwards in 2004 enabled any German wishing to live and work in Poland, and thus east of the Oder–Neisse line, to do so without requiring a permit. German expellees and refugees became free to visit their former homes and set up residence, though some restrictions remained on the purchase of land and buildings.
* Poland entered the Schengen Area on 21 December 2007, removing all border controls on its border with Germany.

Under Article 1 of the Treaty on Final Settlement, the new united Germany committed itself to renouncing any further territorial claims beyond the boundaries of East Germany, West Germany and Berlin; &quot;The united Germany has no territorial claims whatsoever against other states and shall not assert any in the future.&quot; Furthermore, the Basic Law of the Federal Republic was required to be amended to state explicitly that full German unification had now been achieved, such that the new German state comprised the entirety of Germany, and that all constitutional mechanisms should be removed by which any territories outside those boundaries could otherwise subsequently be admitted; these new constitutional articles being bound by treaty not to be revoked. Article 23 of the Basic Law was repealed, closing off the possibility for any further states to apply for membership of the Federal Republic; while Article 146 was amended to state explicitly that the territory of the newly unified republic comprised the entirety of the German people; &quot;This Basic Law, which since the achievement of the unity and freedom of Germany applies to the entire German people, shall cease to apply on the day on which a constitution freely adopted by the German people takes effect&quot;. This was confirmed in the 1990 rewording of the preamble; &quot;Germans ... have achieved the unity and freedom of Germany in free self-determination. This Basic Law thus applies to the entire German people.&quot;

In the course of the German reunification, Chancellor Helmut Kohl initially caused international outcry by making no reference in his 10 Points to the acceptance of the border as definitive, but later reaffirmed reluctantly the acceptance of the territorial changes made after World War II, creating some outrage among the Federation of Expellees, while some Poles were concerned about a possible revival of their 1939 trauma through a &quot;second German invasion&quot;, this time with the Germans buying back their land, which was cheaply available at the time. This happened on a smaller scale than many Poles expected, and the Baltic Sea coast of Poland has become a popular German tourist destination. The so-called &quot;homesickness-tourism&quot; which was often perceived as quite aggressive well into the 1990s now tends to be viewed as a good-natured nostalgia tour rather than an expression of anger and desire for the return of the lost territories.

Some organisations in Germany continue to claim the territories for Germany or property there for German citizens. The Prussian Trust (or the &quot;Prussian Claims Society&quot;), that probably has less than a hundred members, re-opened the old dispute when in December 2006 it submitted 23 individual claims against the Polish government to the European Court of Human Rights asking for compensation or return of property appropriated from its members at the end of World War II. An expert report jointly commissioned by the German and Polish governments from specialists in international law have confirmed that the proposed complaints by the Prussian Trust had little hope of success. But the German government cannot prevent such requests being made and the Polish government has felt that the submissions warranted a comment by Anna Fotyga, the Polish Minister of the Foreign Affairs to &quot;express [her] deepest concern upon receiving the information about a claim against Poland submitted by the Prussian Trust to the European Court of Human Rights&quot;. On 9 October 2008 the European Court of Human Rights declared the case of &quot;Preussische Treuhand v. Poland&quot; inadmissible, because the European Convention on Human Rights does not impose any obligations on the Contracting States to return property which was transferred to them before they ratified the convention.

After the National Democratic Party of Germany, described as a neo-Nazi organisation, won six seats in the parliament of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in September 2006, the leader of the party, Udo Voigt, declared that his party demands Germany in &quot;historical borders&quot; and questioned the current border treaties.

<text>STS-47 was NASA&#x27;s 50th Space Shuttle mission of the program, as well as the second mission of the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;. The mission mainly involved conducting experiments in life and material sciences inside Spacelab-J, a collaborative laboratory inside the shuttle&#x27;s payload bay sponsored by NASA and the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA). This mission carried Mamoru Mohri, the first Japanese astronaut aboard the shuttle, Mae Jemison, the first African-American woman to go to space, and the only married couple to fly together on the shuttle, Mark C. Lee and Jan Davis, which had been against NASA policy prior to this mission.

== Crew ==
As female and male astronauts became more prominently integrated with the shuttle program, NASA enacted an unwritten rule that husband/wife couples would not be assigned to the same mission. However, when Lee and Davis&#x27;s marriage became known to NASA officials in January 1991, the officials decided to keep the assignment as is, given that both crewmembers already had important roles within the upcoming mission. When asked at a NASA press conference if intimate activities would be taking place on the mission, Davis denied that possibility.

=== Backup crew ===
=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission highlights ==
At the beginning of September, a problem with an oxygen line in the shuttle&#x27;s main propulsion system was identified, however, it was resolved without forcing a postponement of the mission.

STS-47 launched from Pad 39B at 10:23:00 a.m. EDT on September 12, 1992, and was the first on-time mission without launch delays since STS-61-B in 1985.

The mission&#x27;s primary payload was Spacelab-J — a joint mission between NASA and the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) — which used a crewed Spacelab module to conduct microgravity research in materials and life sciences. Like many previous missions, the international crew was divided into red and blue teams which would work in two 12-hour shifts for around-the-clock operations. Brown, Lee, and Mohri were assigned to the red team, and would conduct experiments while Apt, Davis, and Jemison, assigned to the blue team, would rest, and vice versa. As the mission commander, Gibson was free to work with both teams. Because of the 24-hour schedule, the crew wasn&#x27;t sent any traditional wake-up calls by mission control.

Spacelab-J included 24 experiments in materials science and 20 life sciences experiments, the majority of which were sponsored by NASDA and NASA, while 2 were sponsored by collaborative civilian efforts. The Payload Crew Training Manager was Homer Hickam, who also worked during the mission as a Crew Interface Coordinator to talk to the crew during their science experiments and relay any concerns from the scientists on the ground.

Materials science investigations covered such fields as biotechnology, electronic materials, fluid dynamics and transport phenomena, glass and ceramics, metals and alloys, and acceleration measurements. Life sciences included experiments on human health, cell separation and biology, developmental biology, animal and human physiology and behavior, space radiation, and biological rhythms. Test subjects included the crew, Japanese koi fish (carp), cultured animal and plant cells, chicken embryos, fruit flies, fungi, plant seeds, frogs and frog eggs, and oriental hornets.

Jemison and Japanese astronaut Mamoru Mohri were trained to use the Autogenic Feedback Training Exercise (AFTE), a technique developed by Patricia S. Cowings that uses biofeedback and autogenic training to help patients monitor and control their physiology as a possible treatment for motion sickness, anxiety and stress-related disorders.

Aboard the Spacelab Japan module, Jemison tested NASA&#x27;s Fluid Therapy System, a set of procedures and equipment to produce water for injection, developed by Sterimatics Corporation. She then used IV bags and a mixing method, developed by Baxter Healthcare, to use the water from the previous step to produce saline solution in space. Jemison was also a co-investigator of two bone cell research experiments. Another experiment she participated in was to induce female frogs to ovulate, fertilize the eggs, and then see how tadpoles developed in zero gravity.

=== Secondary Experiments ===

On the middeck, a variety of experiments were conducted, including the Israel Space Agency Investigation About Hornets (ISAIAH), the Solid Surface Combustion Experiment (SSCE), and the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX II). External experiments using the Ultraviolet Plume Imager (UVPI) on the LACE satellite and observations at the
Air Force Maui Optical Station (AMOS) were also conducted while &quot;Endeavour&quot; was in orbit.

ISAIAH was the first microgravity experiment flown for the Israel Space Agency (ISA). Originating from Tel-Aviv University, it was intended to observe the effects of microgravity on oriental hornets and their ability to build combs in zero-g. However, a failure in the water system resulted in an unexpected rise of the humidity level in the experiment, which resulted in the deaths of 202 out of the 230 hornets and 103 pupae out of the 120 in the experiment. While some of the hornets in the bottom container of the experiment remained active through flight day 7, no new nests were created until after the mission&#x27;s completion, and the average lifespan of the hornets that flew into space was considerably less than that of the control group. None of the hornet pupae that flew into space metamorphized.

Twelve Get Away Special (GAS) canisters (10 with experiments, 2 with ballast) were carried in the payload bay. Among the GAS canisters was G-102, sponsored by the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s Exploring Division in cooperation with the TRW Systems Integration Group, Fairfax, Virginia. The project was named Project POSTAR and was the first space experiment created entirely by members of the Boy Scouts of America.

Also on board were two experiments prepared by Ashford School of Art &amp; Design in Kent, United Kingdom, which, at the time, was a girls-only school. The school had won a competition run by Independent Television News. The experiments were contained in G-520. The first one injected a few grams of cobalt nitrate crystals to a sodium silicate to create a chemical garden in weightless condition. The growths, which were photographed 66 times as they developed, spread out in random directions, twisted, and, in some cases, formed spirals. A second experiment to investigate how Liesegang rings formed in space failed to operate correctly due to friction in parts of the mechanism. On its return, the experiment was exhibited in the London Science Museum.

While in orbit, Jemison planned to speak from orbit on a live TV conference to Chicago grade-school students at an event hosted by NASA and the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry. The event was planned for September 16, 1992, at 7:00 p.m. central time.

The mission, scheduled to end on September 19, 1992, was extended for one more day to complete certain experiments.

===Police shooting===
On October 12, 2012, 18-year-old freshman Gil Collar was shot and killed by a campus police officer, after appearing naked outside the police station. The university released a statement saying a campus police officer &quot;was confronted by a muscular, nude man who was acting erratically.&quot; Collar was 5 foot 7 and weighed 135 pounds. Authorities state that Collar appeared to be on drugs when the incident occurred. The student&#x27;s family filed suit against the university, the officer involved, and the police chief, Herbert Earl &quot;Zeke&quot; Aull. In February 2013, a Mobile County judge ruled that the university was not liable for the student&#x27;s death. in 2014 the case moved to federal court. In 2015, the officer was cleared in a civil suit. The shooting inspired Brian Burghart, then editor of the &quot;News &amp; Review&quot; in Reno, to found Fatal Encounters, a database that tracks killings by law enforcement officers.

===2014 federal discrimination lawsuit===
In 2014, a group of students belonging to Students for Life USA, a pro-life student organization, filed a complaint about alleged discrimination in federal court against University of South Alabama officials. The university later settled the lawsuit, paying the students an undisclosed amount of money. According to a copy of the settlement document provided by the Alliance Defending Freedom, the university &quot;denied all material allegations and Plaintiff&#x27;s claims of constitutional infirmities&quot;. USA agreed to change a portion of its policy on use of its space and facilities, and to pay an unspecified sum settling &quot;all of plaintiff&#x27;s remaining claims, including liability, damages, and attorney&#x27;s fees&quot;.

===Abuse lawsuits===
In September 2021, a lawsuit was filed against a former University of South Alabama volleyball coach due to alleged sexual and mental abuse in 2019 and 2020. The lawsuit included eight former players as plaintiffs. The amendment also alleged that university administrators had knowledge of the abuse and added the university&#x27;s athletic directors and coaches as defendants. A second lawsuit was filed in 2022 by a former player uninvolved in the first lawsuit. WKRG-TV reported that the claims of abuse made by the second lawsuit was similar to the first and that both allegations included inappropriate touching and overtraining. The volleyball coach was hired by the University of South Alabama in December 2018 and resigned in February 2021.

<text>Polegate is a town and civil parish in the Wealden District of East Sussex, England, United Kingdom. It is located five miles (8 km) north of the seaside resort of Eastbourne and is part of the greater area of that town. The 2011 census put the civil parish of Polegate at a population of 8,586, with 41.2% aged 65 and over.

==History==

Until the coming of the railways in the 1840s, Polegate was a small settlement within the parish of Hailsham. The Roman road from Pevensey to Lewes passed through here, and the turnpike between London and Eastbourne was developed in the 18th century; but it was the opening of the railway between Lewes and Hastings, with later branches to Eastbourne and Hailsham, that meant growth for Polegate. It became a significant junction, with a freight terminal serving both the nearby market town of Hailsham and the local brick making industry. The town grew partly to accommodate the railway employees.

In the 12th century, the Premonstratensian order of monks occupied Otham Abbey in the parish, before relocating around 1208 to Bayham Abbey, near Lamberhurst. Two buildings remain of that time, Otteham Court and its Chapel.

In 1851 a church school was established in Polegate.

St John&#x27;s Church was opened on 10 November 1876. The site of the church and the parsonage was donated by Mr Fuller-Meyrick, owner of the Brightling Park Estate. The separate parish of St John&#x27;s was formed on 26 October 1937, with the first vicar being Rev. John Catterall Salisbury (he had been curate since 1933). In 2013 the Parsonage building in Church Road was sold by the Diocese.

In the 21st century, with the closure of the line to Hailsham and the once direct route to Hastings, its importance as a railway hub has gone. It remains a road junction, with the erstwhile turnpike now being the A22 road; the junction with the A27 lies within the town boundary.

There are four streets in today&#x27;s Polegate named for the Levett family (Levett Close, Levett Road, Levett Avenue and Levett Way). The Anglo-Norman family were early Sussex landowners, and held manors and lands across the county, including Firle, Bodiam, Hollington and elsewhere. The family&#x27;s lands were carried into the families of Gildredge (and then to the Davies-Gilbert family of Eastbourne), the Eversfields of St. Leonards-on-Sea, the Ashburnhams, the Chaloners and others.

==Geography==

Polegate is located on a ridge in the gap between the Weald to the north and the South Downs. To the east lie the Pevensey Levels, the onetime bay now converted into farmland with the buildup of the coastal shingle bank during the early Middle Ages. Both the roads and the railway use the gap.

The town is gradually becoming part of the greater Eastbourne conurbation, connecting with Willingdon to the south. Many of the town&#x27;s working population work away: either in Eastbourne or Willingdon. Due to its location situated on the corner of the A27 and A22, it allows easy access to larger cities like Brighton and Hastings in less than an hour.

===Climate===
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).
==Governance==

Polegate is split into two wards for local elections, North and South Polegate. North Polegate with 4000 electors is twice the size of South Polegate&#x27;s 2000 electors, returning twice as many councillors. The Parish is represented at the lowest tier by Polegate Town Council. Fifteen councillors are elected from the two wards every four years. Public meetings are held monthly at the council chambers in Polegate. The 2007 election returned twelve councillors representing the Polegate residents association, two Liberal Democrats and an Independent.

The district council for Polegate is Wealden District Council. District council elections are held every four years. Fifty-five councillors in total are elected, three of these from the Polegate wards. The May 2007 election returned 34 Conservative, 12 Liberal Democrat, 3 Independent Democrat, 3 Wealden Independent, 2 Green Party and 1 no party allegiance. The Polegate councillors parties were 2 Liberal Democrats and 1 Independent Democrat.

The next tier of government is the East Sussex County Council with responsibility for education, libraries, social services, civil registration, trading standards and transport. Elections for the County Council are held every four years. For these elections Polegate is combined with Willingdon and East Dean to return two seats. The 2009 East Sussex County Council election resulted in 29 Conservatives, 13 Liberal Democrats, 4 Labour and 3 Independent, of which the Polegate, Willingdon and East Dean ward provided two Independent councillors.

Polegate is represented in the UK Parliament by the Lewes constituency. The current serving MP is the Liberal Democrat James MacCleary who won the seat in the 2024 general election.

Prior to Brexit in 2020, the village was part of the South East England constituency in the European Parliament.

==Economy==

Chaucer Industrial Business Park Estate is located on Dittons Road where the major part of Polegate&#x27;s industrial businesses are located. A number of small-town shops and businesses occupy the High Street, including a supermarket, hair dressers and convenience store, as well a Premier Inn hotel to the north of the town.

==Attractions==

The tower windmill was built in 1817. It is now a working museum.

==Sport and leisure==

===Recreation===
There are two recreation grounds in Polegate, The Brightling Road Recreation Ground to the east of the town and The War Memorial Recreation Ground so the south of the town in Wannock Road.
* The Brightling Road Recreation Ground, also known as the William Daily Recreation Ground, has a BMX track, a skate park and a woodland area with open ground for sports.
* The War Memorial Recreation Ground is an open field with a basketball hoop and a playground for children.

There are also two Sustrans cycle paths on the National Cycle Network: route 2 between Dover and St Austell, and route 21 between Greenwich and Eastbourne.

===Sports clubs===
The local football team, Polegate Town FC, plays each Saturday at the War Memorial Recreational Ground. The club has two teams, with the first team playing in the Mid Sussex League Championship Division, and the second team in Division 5. The club reformed in 2006 after an absence of five years without a Polegate team. In 2008, the club moved back to the recreation ground, having played its first two seasons on Eastbourne Council pitches. The club have enjoyed various successes since reforming, most recently winning the Blacklands Finance Challenge Cup. In 2015 the club celebrated its centenary, as the earliest known Polegate team was first established in 1915: a photo of this team can be seen in the pavilion at the War Memorial Recreational Ground.

Polegate also have a successful cricket team, Polegate and Stone Cross Cricket Club, which uses the same pitch during the summer months.

==Transport==

===Rail===
The railway arrived in Polegate in 1846, built by the London Brighton and South Coast Railway on the extension from Brighton to Hastings. In 1849 branches extended to Eastbourne and Hailsham (later to Eridge). The line to Hailsham was nicknamed the Cuckoo Line by railway workers. Both that and the direct link to Hastings are now closed. The present Polegate railway station is served by Southern, with regular train services to London, Brighton, Eastbourne and Hastings.

===Buses===
Bus services are provided by
* Brighton &amp; Hove: Routes 28 and 11X
* Stagecoach South East: Routes 6, 51, 52, 54, 54A and 98
* Compass Travel: Route 125

===Other===

The long-distance footpath, the Cuckoo Trail passes through the parish which forms part of the Sustrans National Cycle Route 21 between Pevensey and Greenwich, as does the National Cycle Route 2 between Dover and St Austell. Both routes form part of the Avenue Verte cycle route between London and Paris.

==Education==
State primary education is served by Polegate Primary School.

==Religion==

There are four churches in Polegate: the Church of England parish church, dedicated to St John; the Roman Catholic church of St George; a Seventh-day Adventist Church; and a United Reformed Church. Quakers also meet at the Bernard Baron Homes.

==Media==
Polegate is covered by BBC Sussex, Seahaven FM, More Radio Eastbourne and Heart South. Local newspapers include the &quot;Eastbourne Herald&quot;, &quot;Eastbourne Gazette&quot;, &quot;Hailsham Gazette&quot; and the &quot;Sussex Express&quot;; all published by Beckett Newspapers. Local television news programmes are BBC South East Today and ITV News Meridian.

==Twinnings==
Polegate formed a twinning association in 1981 and is twinned with two towns: 
* Saintry-sur-Seine, France (1991)
* Appen, Germany (1981)

==Notable residents==
* David Dimbleby, television commentator, who included the town as a destination in his 2007 television series &quot;How We Built Britain&quot;
* Denis Healey, politician and writer
* Tim Rice-Oxley from the band Keane
* Trevor Geer, speedway rider and manager for the Eastbourne Eagles Speedway team

<text>Joseph Hooton Taylor Jr. (born March 29, 1941) is an American astrophysicist and Nobel Prize laureate in Physics for his discovery with Russell Alan Hulse of a &quot;new type of pulsar, a discovery that has opened up new possibilities for the study of gravitation.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Taylor was born in Philadelphia to Joseph Hooton Taylor Sr. and Sylvia Evans Taylor, both of whom had Quaker roots for many generations, and grew up in Cinnaminson Township, New Jersey. He attended the Moorestown Friends School in Moorestown Township, New Jersey, where he excelled in math.

He received a B.A. in physics at Haverford College in 1963, and a Ph.D. in astronomy at Harvard University in 1968. After a brief research position at Harvard, Taylor went to the University of Massachusetts Amherst, eventually becoming Professor of Astronomy and Associate Director of the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory.

Taylor&#x27;s thesis work was on lunar occultation measurements. About the time he completed his Ph.D., Jocelyn Bell (who is also a Quaker) discovered the first radio pulsars with a telescope near Cambridge, England.

==Career==
Taylor immediately went to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory&#x27;s telescopes in Green Bank, West Virginia, and participated in the discovery of the first pulsars discovered outside Cambridge. Since then, he has worked on all aspects of pulsar astrophysics.

In 1974, Hulse and Taylor discovered the first pulsar in a binary system, named PSR B1913+16 after its position in the sky, during a survey for pulsars at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Although it was not understood at the time, this was also the first of what are now called &quot;recycled&quot; pulsars: Neutron stars that have been spun-up to fast spin rates by the transfer of mass onto their surfaces from a companion star.

The orbit of this binary system is slowly shrinking as it loses energy because of emission of gravitational radiation, causing its orbital period to speed up slightly. The rate of shrinkage can be precisely predicted from Einstein&#x27;s General Theory of Relativity, and over a thirty-year period Taylor and his colleagues have made measurements that match this prediction to much better than one percent accuracy. This was the first confirmation of the existence of gravitational radiation. There are now scores of binary pulsars known, and independent measurements have confirmed Taylor&#x27;s results.

Taylor has used this first binary pulsar to make high-precision tests of general relativity. Working with his colleague Joel Weisberg, Taylor has used observations of this pulsar to demonstrate the existence of gravitational radiation in the amount and with the properties first predicted by Albert Einstein. He and Hulse shared the Nobel Prize for the discovery of this object. In 1980, he moved to Princeton University, where he was the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor in Physics, having also served for six years as Dean of Faculty. He retired in 2006.

==Amateur radio==
Joe Taylor first obtained his amateur radio license as a teenager, which led him to the field of radio astronomy. Taylor is well known in the field of amateur radio weak signal communication and has been assigned the call sign K1JT by the FCC. He had previously held the callsigns K2ITP, WA1LXQ, W1HFV, and VK2BJX (the latter in Australia).

His amateur radio accomplishments have included mounting an &#x27;expedition&#x27; in April 2010 to use the Arecibo Radio Telescope to conduct moonbounce with Amateurs around the world using voice, Morse code, and digital communications.

He has been active in developing several computer programs and communications protocols, including WSPR and WSJT (&quot;Weak Signal/Joe Taylor&quot;), a software package and protocol suite that utilizes computer-generated messages in conjunction with radio transceivers to communicate over long distances with other amateur radio operators.

WSJT is useful for passing short messages via non-traditional radio communications methods, such as moonbounce and meteor scatter and other low signal-to-noise ratio paths. It is also useful for extremely long-distance contacts using very low power transmissions.

Taylor is also the co-creator of the FT8 mode.

==Honors and awards==
* Heineman Prize of the American Astronomical Society (1980)(inaugural)
* Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1982)
* Henry Draper Medal of the National Academy of Sciences (1985)
* Tomalla Foundation Prize (1987)
* Magellanic Premium (1990)
* Albert Einstein Medal (1991)
* John J. Carty Award for the Advancement of Science of the National Academy of Sciences (1991) (physics)
* Wolf Prize in Physics (1992)
* Member of the American Philosophical Society (1992)
* Nobel Prize in Physics (1993)
* Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1995)
* Karl Schwarzschild Medal (1997)

Keach first distinguished himself in Off-Broadway productions and remains a prominent figure in American theatre across his career, particularly as a noted Shakespearean. He is the recipient of several theatrical accolades: four Drama Desk Awards, two Helen Hayes Awards and two Obie Awards for Distinguished Performance by an Actor. He was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his performance in Arthur Kopit&#x27;s 1969 production of &quot;Indians&quot;.

In film, he garnered critical acclaim for his portrayal of a washed-up boxer in the John Huston film &quot;Fat City&quot; (1972) and appeared as Sergeant Stedenko in Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s films &quot;Up in Smoke&quot; (1978) and &quot;Nice Dreams&quot; (1981). His other notable film credits include &quot;Brewster McCloud&quot; (1970), &quot;Doc&quot; (1971), &quot;The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean&quot; (1972), &quot;Luther&quot; (1973), &quot;Slave of the Cannibal God&quot; (1979), &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot; (1980), &quot;The Long Riders&quot; (1980), &quot;Roadgames&quot; (1981), &quot;&quot; (1992), &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; (1996), &quot;American History X&quot; (1998), &quot;The Bourne Legacy&quot; (2012) and &quot;Nebraska&quot; (2013).

He is an inductee of the Theatre Hall of Fame and was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2019. He is the son of theatre director Stacy Keach Sr., and the older brother of actor James Keach.

==Early life and education==
Keach was born in Savannah, Georgia, to Mary Cain (), an actress, and Stacy Keach Sr., a theatre director, drama teacher, and actor with dozens of television and theatrical film credits billed as &quot;Stacy Keach.&quot; The younger Keach was born with a cleft lip and a partial cleft of the hard palate, and he underwent numerous operations as a child. Throughout his adult life he has usually worn a mustache to hide the scars. He is now the honorary chairman of the Cleft Palate Foundation and advocates for insurance coverage for surgeries.

He graduated from Van Nuys High School in June 1959, where he was class president, attended the American Legion&#x27;s Boys State summer program of California, then earned two BA degrees at the University of California, Berkeley (1963): one in English, the other in Dramatic Art. He earned a Master of Fine Arts at the Yale School of Drama in 1966 and was a Fulbright Scholar at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.

While studying in London, Keach met Laurence Olivier, his acting hero.

==Career==

===Theatre===

Keach played the title role in &quot;MacBird!&quot;, an Off-Broadway anti-war satire by Barbara Garson staged at the Village Gate in 1966. In 1967, he was cast, again Off-Broadway, in George Tabori&#x27;s &quot;The Niggerlovers&quot; with Morgan Freeman in his acting debut. To this day, Freeman credits Keach with teaching him the most about acting. In 1967, Keach also starred in &quot;We Bombed in New Haven,&quot; a play by Joseph Heller that premiered in New Haven at the Yale Repertory Theatre and later was produced on Broadway. Keach first appeared on Broadway in 1969 as Buffalo Bill in &quot;Indians&quot; by Arthur Kopit. Early in his career, he was credited as Stacy Keach Jr. to distinguish himself from his father. He played the lead actor in &quot;The Nude Paper Sermon&quot;, an avant-garde musical theatre piece for media presentation, commissioned by Nonesuch Records by composer Eric Salzman.

Keach has won numerous awards, including Obie Awards, Drama Desk Awards and Vernon Rice Awards. In the early 1980s, he starred in the title role of the national touring company of the musical &quot;Barnum&quot;, composed by Cy Coleman. In 1991 and 1996 he won Helen Hayes Awards for Outstanding Actor for his work in &quot;Richard III&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot; with the Shakespeare Theatre Company. In 1998, he was one of the three characters in a London West End production of &quot;&#x27;Art&#x27;&quot; with David Dukes and George Wendt.

In 2006, Keach performed the lead role in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. In 2008, he played Merlin in Lerner and Loewe&#x27;s &quot;Camelot&quot;, done with the New York Philharmonic. In the summer of 2009, Shakespeare Theatre Company remounted the production of &quot;King Lear&quot; at Sidney Harman Hall in Washington, D.C., for which Keach won another Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Actor.

He has played the title role in two separate productions of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

On December 16, 2010, Keach began performances as patriarch Lyman Wyeth in the off-Broadway premiere of Jon Robin Baitz&#x27; acclaimed new play &quot;Other Desert Cities&quot;. The production transferred to Broadway&#x27;s Booth Theatre, where it opened November 3, 2011.

Keach is a founding member of L.A. Theatre Works. He has performed leads in many productions with the company, including &#x27;Willy Loman&#x27; in &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; and &#x27;John Proctor&#x27; in &quot;The Crucible&quot;.

He was scheduled to return to Broadway in December 2014 in the revival of &quot;Love Letters&quot; at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre alongside Diana Rigg, but the production closed before Keach and Rigg began their runs.

Keach was scheduled to play Ernest Hemingway in Jim McGrath&#x27;s one-man play &quot;Pamplona&quot; at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago from May 30 to June 25, 2017. Keach appeared in previews of &quot;Pamplona&quot;, May 19 through May 28, and was well received by audiences. On opening night, he suffered a mild heart attack on stage and the next day, Keach had bypass surgery. On June 2, the Goodman Theatre announced that the entire run would be canceled after Keach&#x27;s doctors advised a period of rest and recuperation.

Keach returned to the role at The Goodman one year later, July 10 through August 18, 2018. Keach said it would fulfill an obligation &quot;to the play, to the city and to myself&quot;.

He went on to play Kane in the 1980 movie &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot;, written and directed by &quot;Exorcist&quot; author William Peter Blatty; this role was itself intended for Nicol Williamson.

Keach was narrator of the 1973 Formula One racing documentary &quot;Champions Forever, The Quick and the Dead&quot; by Claude du Boc. He played Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s police department nemesis Sgt. Stedenko in &quot;Up in Smoke&quot; and &quot;Nice Dreams&quot;. He also appeared as Barabbas in &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;.

In Oliver Stone&#x27;s 2008 biographical film &quot;W.&quot;, Keach portrays a Texas preacher whose spiritual guidance begins with George W. Bush&#x27;s AA experience, but extends long thereafter.

Keach also starred in the TV film &quot;Ring of Death&quot; playing a sadistic prison warden who runs an underground fight club where prisoners compete for their lives. He had also starred in the movie &quot;Planes&quot; as Skipper Riley, main character Dusty Crophopper&#x27;s flight instructor. He reprised the role in &quot;&quot;.

In 1984, Customs &amp; Excise officers arrested Keach at Heathrow Airport for importation of cocaine. Keach pleaded guilty, and served six months at Reading Prison. Keach stated that his time in prison, which he described as the lowest point of his life, and the friendship he formed with a priest during that time led to his conversion to Catholicism. Subsequently, he and his wife met Pope John Paul II. His wife, Małgorzata Tomassi, had attended the same school in Warsaw as the pope.

<text>Henry Warren Hartsfield Jr. (November 21, 1933 – July 17, 2014) was a United States Air Force Colonel and NASA astronaut who logged over 480 hours in space. He was inducted into the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame in 2006.

== Personal data ==
Henry Hartsfield was born in Birmingham, Alabama on November 21, 1933. He was married to the former Judy Frances Massey of Princeton, North Carolina, and had two daughters.

== Education ==
Hartsfield graduated from West End High School, Birmingham, Alabama. He later earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from Auburn University in 1954, where he was a member of the Delta Chi fraternity. Hartsfield performed graduate work in physics at Duke University and in Astronautics at the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. He was also awarded a Master of Science degree in Engineering Science from the University of Tennessee in 1971.

== USAF experience ==
Hartsfield received his commission through the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) at Auburn University. He entered the U.S. Air Force in 1955, and his assignments included a tour with the 53rd Tactical Fighter Squadron in Bitburg, West Germany. He is also a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and was an instructor there prior to his assignment in 1966 to the USAF Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program as an astronaut. After the cancellation of the MOL program in June 1969, he was reassigned to NASA.

He logged over 7,400 hours of flying time—of which over 6,150 hours are in the North American F-86 Sabre, North American F-100 Super Sabre, Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, Republic F-105 Thunderchief, Convair F-106 Delta Dart, Lockheed T-33, and Northrop T-38 Talon jet aircraft.

== NASA experience ==
Hartsfield became part of NASA Astronaut Group 7 in September 1969. He was a member of the astronaut support crew for Apollo 16 and served as a member of the astronaut support crew for the Skylab-2, -3, and -4 missions. He also was a CAPCOM on STS-1.

Hartsfield retired in August 1977 from the United States Air Force with more than 22 years of active service but continued his assignment as a NASA astronaut in a civilian capacity. He was a member of the orbital flight test missions group of the Astronaut Office and was responsible for supporting the development of the Space Shuttle&#x27;s entry flight control system and its associated interfaces.

Hartsfield served as backup pilot for STS-2 and STS-3, &quot;Columbia&quot;″s second and third orbital flight tests.

Hartsfield was the pilot on STS-4, the fourth and final orbital test flight of the shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 27, 1982. He was accompanied by Thomas K. Mattingly II (spacecraft commander) on this seven-day mission designed to: further verify ascent and entry phases of shuttle missions; perform continued studies of the effects of long-term thermal extremes on the Orbiter subsystems; and conduct a survey of Orbiter-induced contamination on the orbiter payload bay. Additionally, the crew operated several scientific experiments located in the Orbiter&#x27;s cabin as well as in the payload bay. These experiments included the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES), designed to investigate the separation of biological materials in a fluid according to their surface electrical charge. The crew is also credited with effecting an in-flight repair which enabled them to activate the first operational &quot;Getaway Special&quot; — comprising nine experiments that range from algae and duckweed growth in space to fruit fly and brine shrimp genetic studies. STS-4 completed 112 orbits of the Earth before landing on a concrete runway at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on July 4, 1982.

Hartsfield was next spacecraft commander of STS-41-D which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 30, 1984. The crew included Michael L. Coats (pilot), Judith A. Resnik, Steven A. Hawley and Richard M. Mullane (mission specialists), and Charles D. Walker (payload specialist). This was the maiden flight of the orbiter &quot;Space Shuttle Discovery&quot;. During the six-day mission the crew successfully activated the OAST-1 solar cell wing experiment, deployed three satellites, SBS-D, SYNCOM IV-2 (LEASAT-2), and TELSTAR 3-C, operated the CFES-III experiment, the student crystal growth experiment, and photography experiments using the IMAX motion picture camera. The crew earned the name &quot;Icebusters&quot; when Hartsfield successfully removed a hazardous ice buildup from the orbiter using the Remote Manipulator System (Canadarm). STS-41-D completed 96 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on September 5, 1984.

On his third flight, Hartsfield was spacecraft commander of &quot;Challenger&quot; on STS-61-A, the West German Spacelab D-1 mission which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on October 30, 1985. His crew included Steven R. Nagel (pilot), James F. Buchli, Guion S. Bluford Jr. and Bonnie J. Dunbar (mission specialists), and Reinhard Furrer, Ernst Messerschmid, and Wubbo Ockels (payload specialists). The seven-day mission was the first with eight crew members, and the first Spacelab science mission planned and controlled by a foreign customer. More than 75 scientific experiments were completed in the areas of physiological sciences, materials processing, biology, and navigation. After completing 111 orbits of the Earth, STS-61-A landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on November 6, 1985. STS-61-A was the final successful flight of &quot;Challenger&quot;, as it was destroyed during the launch of its next mission, STS-51-L.

With the completion of this flight, Hartsfield had logged 483 hours in space.

Between 1986 and 1987, Hartsfield served as the Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office. In 1987, he became the Deputy Director for Flight Crew Operations, supervising the activities of the Astronaut Office and the Aircraft Operations Division at the Johnson Space Center (JSC).

In 1989, he accepted a temporary assignment in the Office of Space Flight at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. There he served as Director of the Technical Integration and Analysis Division, reporting directly to the Associate Administrator for Space Flight. In this assignment, he was responsible for facilitating the integration of the Space Station Freedom and its unique requirements into the Space Shuttle systems. His office also served as a technical forum for resolving technical programmatic issues.

In 1990, Hartsfield accepted another temporary assignment as the Deputy Manager for Operations, Space Station Projects Office, at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. In that capacity, he was responsible for the planning and management of Space Station Operations and Utilization Capability Development and operations activities including budget preparation. Later in that assignment, he also acted as the Deputy Manager for the Space Station Projects Office.

In 1991, Hartsfield accepted the position of the Man-Tended Capability (MTC) Phase Manager, Space Station Freedom Program and Operations (SSFPO), with a duty station at the Johnson Space Center. Reporting directly to the Deputy Director, SSFPO, he represented the Deputy Director in providing appropriate program guidance and direction to the Space Shuttle Program, and across the Space Station Freedom Program for all MTC phase mission unique activities to assure appropriate resolution of issues.

In December 1993, Hartsfield accepted the position of Manager, International Space Station (ISS) Independent Assessment. In this capacity, he reported directly to the Associate Administrator for Safety and Mission Assurance and managed and focused the oversight activities and assessment of the International Space Station Program.

In September 1996, the scope of Hartsfield&#x27;s work was expanded to include independent assessment of the programs and projects of the Human Exploration and Development of Space (HEDS) Enterprise and he was named Director, HEDS Independent Assurance.

Hartsfield retired from NASA in 1998 and then joined the executive ranks of Raytheon Company as vice president of aerospace engineering services. He retired from Raytheon in 2005. He died on July 17, 2014, from complications from back surgery.

<doc id="499532" wikidata="Q204954" url="?curid=499532" title="Zinc sulfate">
<text>Zinc sulfate is an inorganic compound with the formula ZnSO4. It forms hydrates ZnSO4·&quot;n&quot;H2O, where &quot;n&quot; can range from 0 to 7. All are colorless solids. The most common form includes water of crystallization as the heptahydrate, with the formula . As early as the 16th century it was prepared on a large scale, and was historically known as &quot;white vitriol&quot; (the name was used, for example, in 1620s by the collective writing under the pseudonym of Basil Valentine). Zinc sulfate and its hydrates are colourless solids.

==Uses==
===Manufacturing===
The main application of the heptahydrate is as a coagulant in the production of rayon. It is also a precursor to the pigment lithopone. It is also used as an electrolyte for zinc electroplating, as a mordant in dyeing, and as a preservative for skins and leather.

===Nutrition===
Zinc sulfate is used to supply zinc in animal feeds, fertilizers, toothpaste, and agricultural sprays. Zinc sulfate, like many zinc compounds, can be used to control moss growth on roofs.

Zinc sulfate can be used to supplement zinc in the brewing process. Zinc is a necessary nutrient for optimal yeast health and performance, although it is not a necessary supplement for low-gravity beers, as the grains commonly used in brewing already provide adequate zinc. It is a more common practice when pushing yeast to their limit by increasing alcohol content beyond their comfort zone. Before modern stainless steel, brew Kettles, fermenting vessels and after wood, zinc was slowly leached by the use of copper kettles. A modern copper immersion chiller is speculated to provide trace amounts of zinc; thus care must be taken when adding supplemental zinc so as not to cause excess. Side effects include &quot;...increased acetaldehyde and fusel alcohol production due to high yeast growth when zinc concentrations exceed 5 ppm. Excess zinc can also cause soapy or goaty flavors.&quot;

Zinc sulfate is a potent inhibitor of sweetness perception for most sweet-tasting substances.

===Medicine===

It is used as a dietary supplement to treat zinc deficiency and to prevent the condition in those at high risk. Side effects of excess supplementation may include abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, and tiredness. it is also used together with oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and an astringent.

==Production, reactions, structure==

Zinc sulfate is produced by treating virtually any zinc-containing material (metal, minerals, oxides) with sulfuric acid.

Specific reactions include the reaction of the metal with aqueous sulfuric acid:
Pharmaceutical-grade zinc sulfate is produced by treating high-purity zinc oxide with sulfuric acid:

In aqueous solution, all forms of zinc sulfate behave identically. These aqueous solutions consist of the metal aquo complex and ions. Barium sulfate forms when these solutions are treated with solutions of barium ions:
With a reduction potential of −0.76 V, zinc(II) reduces only with difficulty.

When heated above 680 °C, zinc sulfate decomposes into sulfur dioxide gas and zinc oxide fume, both of which are hazardous.

The heptahydrate is isostructural with ferrous sulfate heptahydrate. The solid consists of [Zn(H2O)6]2+ ions interacting with sulfate and one water of crystallization by hydrogen bonds. Anhydrous zinc sulfate is isomorphous with anhydrous copper(II) sulfate. It exists as the mineral zincosite. A monohydrate is known. The hexahydrate is also recognized.

==Minerals==
As a mineral, ZnSO4·7H2O is known as goslarite. Zinc sulfate occurs as several other minor minerals, such as zincmelanterite, (structurally different from goslarite). Lower hydrates of zinc sulfate are rarely found in nature: (bianchite), (boyleite), and (gunningite).

==Safety==
Zinc sulfate powder is an eye irritant. Ingestion of trace amounts is considered safe, and zinc sulfate is added to animal feed as a source of essential zinc, at rates of up to several hundred milligrams per kilogram of feed. Excess ingestion results in acute stomach distress, with nausea and vomiting appearing at 2–8 mg/kg of body weight. Nasal irrigation with a solution of zinc sulfate has been found to be able to damage the olfactory sense nerves and induce anosmia in a number of different species, including humans.

The village&#x27;s name was spelled &quot;Pottun&quot; in 960 AD and &quot;Potone&quot; in the 1086 Domesday book. It is derived from the Old English for &quot;farmstead where pots are made&quot;.

Evidence of early-middle Iron Age settlement in the form of ditches, a pit and sherds of pottery was found in 2009 by archaeologists at Vicarage Farm off the B1042 Gamlingay Road. The parish of Potton underwent parliamentary inclosure twice - once in 1775, and again in 1832.

===Market and fairs===
Potton was granted a market charter by William II in 1094. Potton&#x27;s market was one of the largest in Bedfordshire in the Tudor and Stuart periods, but declined after the Great Fire in 1783. Corn and straw plait were the principal goods in 1831.

A fair was granted by Henry II in 1227. In 1831, fairs were held in January, April, July and October. The town&#x27;s horse fairs were some of the largest in the country, until they ended in 1932.

The Shambles provided folding market stalls in the town square before brick buildings were put in place by Samuel Whitbread, the Lord of the Manor, in 1797. They became dilapidated in the 1930s and were demolished after the Second World War. A new library was built in their place, incorporating the old clock from the Shambles with illuminated dials and bell. The library building is called Clock House and was opened on 23 July 1956. It serves as a focal point in the centre of the market square. In spring 2006, the clock mechanism was replaced with an automatic winding system costing £3,000.

===Great Fire===
The Great Fire of Potton started in a stack of clover in a field in the area of what is now Spencer Close, in 1783. King Street, half the Market Square and some of the Brook End area were destroyed. It was reported to have burned for a day. Local people raised £6,000 to help those most in need. The 13th-century parish church, St Mary&#x27;s, survived. Rebuilding after the fire has left the town with a number of Georgian buildings.

===Railway===
The Sandy and Potton Railway, also known as Captain Peel&#x27;s Railway, opened on 9 November 1857. It was established by Captain Sir William Peel VC, who resided at The Lodge. When the Great Northern Railway came to Sandy in 1850, Captain Peel had a branch line built to his estate and on to Potton. The railway&#x27;s locomotive was named Shannon, after the frigate Captain Peel was commanding. He never saw his railway; he died of smallpox on 22 April 1858 in India. The engine itself is in the collection of the National Railway Museum and is currently housed at Didcot Railway Centre. The Potton Barbershop Harmony Club named its male chorus &#x27;Shannon Express&#x27; after the locomotive.
Potton railway station, which opened in 1862 and served the Varsity Line between Oxford to Cambridge, was closed in 1968. The railway was partly to blame for the decline of Potton market but made London accessible for the district&#x27;s market gardeners.

===Potton Manor===
Potton Manor was built in the 1860s. It was requisitioned by the armed forces and used as a laboratory during the war and as a car factory by Eva Pokorova and Otto van Smekal. The Champion car built in Potton was purchased from the National Motor Museum by Potton History Society, whose aim it is to restore the vehicle to full working order. The house was finally demolished in the early 1980s.

===Land Settlement Association===
In March 1935 the first Land Settlement Association (LSA) estate of 30 smallholdings was established to the east of the town along the Wrestlingworth, Sutton and Hatley Roads with land donated by Sir Malcolm Stewart, Potton&#x27;s last Lord of the Manor. Its purpose was to resettle unemployed men from coal mining areas in the north of England. Pig and poultry farming plus horticulture were the main activities, augmented by a central farm. Potton provided the model for a further 20 such estates across the country.

===Air crash===
On 18 September 1945, a B-24 Liberator bomber crashed on the southern edge of Potton Wood. Four men were killed; the place where it fell can still be seen.

==Geography==
Potton is east of the county town of Bedford, south-west of Cambridge and north of London. The B1042 road links the town to Sandy and Wrestlingworth and the B1040 to Biggleswade and Gamlingay.

==Economy==
Potton had its own brewery from around 1784 until 1922 when it was bought by the Bedford brewery of Newland &amp; Nash. This company subsequently closed the brewery in Potton and sold the site to the Co-operative Society (the original buildings remain intact). In 1998 brewing returned to Potton when the Potton Brewery Company was re-established, This subsequently closed but a new brewery is currently being planned. The town is also home to Potton Homes, who specialise in mock Tudor style property developments.

A sand quarry operated by Breedon Aggregates lies off The Heath to the north-west of the town.
Deepdale Trees operate an extensive tree nursery off Hatley Road and there is an adjacent poultry farm.

Despite noteworthy local businesses, the town remains very much a commuter town; the majority of people in Potton commute daily to either London, via rail, or to Cambridge.

<text>Michael Lloyd Coats (born January 16, 1946) is a former NASA astronaut (three spaceflights), raised in Riverside, California. From December 2005 to December 2012, he served as Director of the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.

==Early life and education==
Coats was born January 16, 1946, in Sacramento, California. He was raised in Riverside, California, and graduated from Ramona High School in 1964. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Naval Academy in 1968, a Master of Science degree in Administration of Science and Technology from George Washington University in 1977, and a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1979. 

==Organizations==
*Member, Society of Experimental Test Pilots;
*Associate Fellow, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

==Honors==
Coats was awarded the Defense Superior Service Medal, 3 Navy Distinguished Flying Crosses, 32 Strike Flight Air Medals, 3 Individual Action Air Medals, 9 Navy Commendation Medals with Combat &quot;V&quot;, and the NASA Space Flight Medal.

==Career==
Coats graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1968 and was designated a Naval Aviator in September 1969. After training as an A-7E pilot, he was assigned to Attack Squadron 192 (VA-192) from August 1970 to September 1972 aboard the aircraft carrier and, during this time, flew 315 combat missions in Southeast Asia. He served as a flight instructor with the A-7E Readiness Training Squadron (VA-122) at Naval Air Station Lemoore, California, from September 1972 to December 1973, and was then selected to attend the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland.

Following test pilot training in 1974, he was project officer and test pilot for the A-7 and A-4 aircraft at the Strike Aircraft Test Directorate. He served as a flight instructor at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School from April 1976 until May 1977. He then attended the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School at Monterey, California, from June 1977 until his selection for the astronaut candidate program.

He has logged over 5,000 hours flying time in 28 different types of aircraft, and 400 carrier landings.

===Space Shuttle astronaut===
Selected as an astronaut candidate in 1978, Coats became a NASA astronaut in August 1979. He was a member of the STS-4 astronaut support crew, and was a capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for STS-4 and STS-5. A veteran of three space flights, Coats flew on STS-41-D in 1984, STS-29 in 1989, and STS-39 in 1991. From May 1989 to March 1990, he served as Acting Chief of the Astronaut Office.

====STS-41-D====
On his first mission, Coats was pilot on the crew of STS-41-D, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 30, 1984. This was the maiden flight of the Orbiter &quot;Discovery&quot;. The mission was delayed three times over a two-month period prior to liftoff. Delays included the first pad abort of the Shuttle program (and the first for NASA since Gemini 6A) as well as a fire on the launch pad. During this 6-day mission the crew successfully activated the OAST-1 solar cell wing experiment, deployed three satellites (SBS-D, SYNCOM IV-2, and TELSTAR 3-C), operated the CFES-III experiment, the student crystal growth experiment, and photography experiments using the IMAX motion picture camera. The crew earned the name &quot;Icebusters&quot; in successfully removing hazardous ice particles from the orbiter using the Remote Manipulator System. STS-41-D completed 96 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on September 5, 1984.

====STS-61-H====
In February 1985, Coats was selected as the commander of STS-61-H, which was subsequently canceled after the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident.

====STS-29====
As commander of STS-29, Coats and his crew launched from Kennedy Space Center aboard &quot;Discovery&quot; on March 13, 1989. During this highly successful five-day mission, the crew deployed a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS), and performed numerous secondary experiments, including a Space Station &quot;heat pipe&quot; radiator experiment, two student experiments, a protein crystal growth experiment, and a chromosome and plant cell division experiment. In addition, the crew took over 3,000 photographs of the earth
using several types of cameras, including the IMAX 70 mm movie camera. Mission duration was 80 orbits and concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on March 18, 1989. With the completion of his second mission, Coats has logged a total of 264 hours in space.

====STS-39====
Coats commanded a seven-man crew on STS-39, an unclassified eight-day Department of Defense mission launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida on April 28, 1991. Crew members worked around the clock in two-shift operations during which they deployed, operated and retrieved the SPAS-II spacecraft, in addition to conducting various science experiments including research of both natural and induced phenomena in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. After completing 134 orbits of the Earth, &quot;Discovery&quot; and her crew landed at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida on May 6, 1991. With the completion of his third mission, Coats has logged over 463 hours in space.

<text>&quot;Rapunzel&quot; ( ; ; or &quot;Persinette&quot;) is a German fairy tale most notably recorded by the Brothers Grimm and it was published in 1812 as part of &quot;Children&#x27;s and Household Tales&quot; (KHM 12). The Brothers Grimm&#x27;s story was developed from the French literary fairy tale of &quot;Persinette&quot; by Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de La Force (1698), which itself is an alternative version of the Italian fairy tale &quot;Petrosinella&quot; by Giambattista Basile (1634).

The tale is classified as Aarne–Thompson type 310 (&quot;The Maiden in The Tower&quot;). Its plot has been used and parodied in various media. Its best known line is, &quot;Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair&quot;.

== Plot ==

After years of wishing for a child, a couple is expecting a baby. The husband and wife live next to a large, extensive, high-walled flower and herb garden belonging to a sorceress. The wife craves for the rapunzel (which is either cornsalad or rampion) that she sees growing in the garden. She refuses to eat anything else and begins to waste away. Her husband fears for her life and one night, he scales down the garden wall to steal some rapunzel for her. When the man returns home, his wife makes a salad out of the rapunzel and eats it. But the next day, the wife craves for more rapunzel, so her husband returns to the garden that night to steal some more. As he scales down the garden wall, the sorceress catches him and accuses him of theft. The man begs for mercy and explains his wife&#x27;s condition. The sorceress agrees to be lenient, allowing the man to take all the rapunzel he wants on the condition that the baby be given to her when it is born. Desperate, he agrees.

When the wife gives birth to a baby girl, the sorceress takes her to raise as her own and names her &quot;Rapunzel&quot; after the plant her mother had craved for. Rapunzel grows up to be a beautiful child with long golden hair. When she turns twelve, the sorceress locks her up in a tower in the middle of the woods, with neither stairs nor a door, and only one room and one window at the top. In order to visit Rapunzel, the sorceress stands at the bottom of the tower and calls out:
Whenever Rapunzel hears that rhyme, she fastens her long braided hair to a hook in the window before letting it fall twenty yards to the ground, and the sorceress climbs up it.

A few years later, a prince rides through the forest and hears Rapunzel singing from the tower. Entranced by her ethereal voice, he searches for her and discovers the tower, but is unable to enter it. The prince returns to the tower often, listening to Rapunzel&#x27;s beautiful singing, and one day sees the sorceress visit her as usual and learns how to gain access. When the sorceress leaves, the prince bids Rapunzel to let her hair down. Thinking it is the sorceress calling her again, Rapunzel lets down her hair and the prince climbs up. The two then fall in love and secretly marry. As the sorceress visits Rapunzel by day, the couple plans a means of escape: the prince will bring his wife a strand of silk every night until she has enough to make a ladder for her to climb down the tower and ride away with him on horseback.

Before the couple&#x27;s escape plan can come to fruition, however, the sorceress visits one day and Rapunzel innocently asks her why all her clothes are tight around the waist (this part comes from the 1812 original edition of &quot;Kinder- und Hausmärchen&quot; or &quot;Children&#x27;s and Household Tales&quot;, most commonly known in English as &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot;; in later editions, Rapunzel instead asks &quot;Dame Gothel&quot;, in a moment of forgetfulness, why it is easier for her to draw up the prince than her). In anger, the sorceress cuts off Rapunzel&#x27;s hair and banishes her into the wilderness to fend for herself.

When the prince calls that night, the sorceress hooks Rapunzel&#x27;s severed hair and lets it down to haul him up. To the prince&#x27;s horror and shock, he finds himself meeting the sorceress instead of Rapunzel. After the sorceress tells the prince in a rage that he will never see Rapunzel again, he throws himself from the tower, landing in a patch of thorns. Although the prince survives, the thorns blind him. A month later in the wilderness, Rapunzel gives birth to her twin children with the prince – a boy and a girl.

For some years, the blind prince wanders through the wastelands of the country and eventually comes to the wilderness where Rapunzel has been living with their children. One day, as Rapunzel sings, the prince hears her voice again, and they are reunited. When they fall into each other&#x27;s arms, Rapunzel sheds tears, two of which fall into the prince&#x27;s eyes, immediately restoring his sight. The prince leads Rapunzel and their children to his kingdom where they live happily ever after.

Another version of the story ends with the revelation that the sorceress had untied Rapunzel&#x27;s hair after the prince leapt from the tower, and it slipped from her hands and landed far below, leaving her trapped in the tower.

== Origin and development ==

=== Mythological and religious inspiration ===
Some researchers have proposed that the earliest possible inspiration for the &quot;Maiden in the Tower&quot; archetype is to the pre-Christian European (or proto-Indo-European) sun or dawn goddess myths, in which the light deity is trapped and is rescued. Similar myths include that of the Baltic solar goddess, Saulė, who is held captive in a tower by a king. Inspiration may also be taken from the classical myth of the hero, Perseus; Perseus&#x27; mother, the Princess Danaë, was confined to a bronze tower by her own father, Acrisius, the King of Argos, in an attempt to prevent her from becoming pregnant, as it was foretold by the Oracle of Delphi that she would bear a son who would kill his grandfather.

Inspiration may come from Ethniu, daughter of Balor, in Irish myth.

Inspiration may come from the story of Saint Barbara of Nicomedia, who is said to have been a beautiful woman who was confined to a tower by her father to protect her from bad influences. While in the tower, she is said to have converted to Christianity and be ultimately martyred for her faith after a series of miracles delaying her execution. Her story was included in &quot;The Book of the City of Ladies&quot;, completed by 1405 by Christine de Pizan in vernacular French, which may have been highly influential on later writers, as it was popular throughout Europe.

=== Literary development ===
The earliest surviving reference to a female character with long hair that she offers to a male lover to climb like a ladder appears in the Persian epic poem &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, written by Ferdowsi between 977 and 1010 CE. The heroine of the story, Rudāba, offers her hair so that her love interest Zāl may enter the harem where she lives. Zāl instead uses a rope he had his servant brought with him so that she will not hurt herself.

The first written record of a story that may be recognized as &quot;Rapunzel&quot; is Giambattista Basile&#x27;s &quot;Petrosinella&quot;, translating to parsley, which was published in Naples in the local dialect in 1634 in a collection entitled &quot;Lo cunto de li cunti&quot; (The Tale of Tales). This version of the story differs from later versions as it is the wife not the husband who steals the plant, the maiden is taken by the villain as a child rather than a baby, and the maiden and the prince are not separated for years to be reunited in the end. Most importantly, this version of the story contains a &quot;flight&quot; scene in which Petrosinella uses magic acorns that turn into animals to distract the ogress while she pursues the couple fleeing the tower. This &quot;flight&quot; scene, with three magic objects used as distraction, is found in oral variants in the Mediterranean region, notably Sicily (&quot;Angiola&quot;), Malta (&quot;Little Parsley&quot; and &quot;Little Fennel&quot;), and Greece (&quot;Anthousa the Fair with Golden Hair&quot;).

In 1697, Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de La Force published a variation of the story, &quot;Persinette&quot;, while confined to an abbey due to perceived misconduct during service in the court of Louis XIV. Before her imprisonment, de la Force was a prominent figure in the Parisian salons and considered one of the early &quot;conteuses&quot; as a contemporary to Charles Perrault. This version of the story includes almost all elements that were found in later versions by the Grimm Brothers. It is the first version to include the maiden&#x27;s out of wedlock pregnancy, the villain&#x27;s trickery leading to the prince&#x27;s blinding, the birth of twins, and the tears of the maiden restoring the prince&#x27;s sight. The tale ends with the antagonist taking pity on the couple and transporting them to the prince&#x27;s kingdom. While de la Force&#x27;s claim that &quot;Persinette&quot; was an original story cannot be substantiated, her version was the most complex at the time and did introduce original elements.

=== German adaptation ===
The first known German translation of Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de La Force&#x27;s tale &quot;Persinette&quot; came about in 1766 by Friedrich Immanuel Bierling under the name &quot;Das Cabinet der Feen. Oder gesammelte Feen-Märchen in neun Theilen, Aus dem Französischen übersetzt&quot;, published in Nürenberg. More famously, &quot;Persinette&quot; was translated into German by Friedrich Schulz and appeared in 1790 in &quot;Kleine Romane&quot; (&quot;Little Novels&quot;), as it was Schulz who changed the plant and the maiden&#x27;s name to Rapunzel. Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm included the story in their first (1812) and seventh (1857) edition publications of &quot;Children&#x27;s and Household Tales&quot; and removed elements that they believed were added to the &quot;original&quot; German fairy tale. Although the Grimms&#x27; recounting of the fairy tale is the most prevalent version of the &quot;Maiden in the Tower&quot; in the western literary canon, the story does not appear to have connections to a Germanic oral folktale tradition. Notably, the 1812 publication retains the out of wedlock pregnancy that reveals the prince&#x27;s visits to the witch, whereas in the 1857 version edited by Wilhelm Grimm, it is Rapunzel&#x27;s slip of the tongue to address criticism that the tale was not appropriate for children. It can be argued that the 1857 version of the story was the first written for a primarily child-aged audience.

=== Distribution ===
According to Greek folklorist Georgios A. Megas, fellow folklorist Michael Meracles concluded that the tale type originated in Southeastern Europe, by analysing 22 Greek variants, 2 Serbo-Croatian and 1 from Corsica.

Scholar Jack Zipes stated that the tale type is &quot;extremely popular throughout Europe&quot;. However, scholar Ton Deker remarked that the tale type is &quot;mainly known&quot; in Central and South Europe, and in the Middle East. In the same vein, Stith Thompson argued for a Mediterranean origin for the story, due to &quot;its great popularity&quot; in Italy and nearby countries.

Scholar Ulrich Marzolph remarked that the tale type AT 310 was one of &quot;the most frequently encountered tales in Arab oral tradition&quot;, albeit missing from &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot; compilation.

== Themes and characterization ==

Many scholars have interpreted &quot;Maiden in the Tower&quot; stories, which Rapunzel is a part of, as a metaphor for the protection of young women from pre-marital relationships by overzealous guardians. Scholars have drawn comparisons of the confinement of Rapunzel in her tower to that of a convent, where women&#x27;s lives were highly controlled and they lived in exclusion from outsiders.

Scholars have also noted the strong theme of love conquering all in the story, as the lovers are united after years of searching in all versions after &quot;Persinette&quot; and are ultimately happily reunited as a family.

The seemingly unfair bargain that the husband makes with the sorceress in the opening of &quot;Rapunzel&quot; is a common convention in fairy tales, which is replicated in &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;, when Jack trades a cow for beans, and in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, when Beauty comes to the Beast in return for a rose. Furthermore, folkloric beliefs often regarded it as dangerous to deny a pregnant woman any food she craved, making the bargain with the sorceress more understandable, since the husband would have perceived his actions as saving his wife at the cost of his child. Family members would often go to great lengths to secure such cravings, and such desires for lettuce and other vegetables may indicate a need for vitamins.

The &quot;Maiden in the Tower&quot; archetype has drawn comparisons to a possible lost matriarchal myth connected to the sacred marriage between the prince and the maiden and the rivalry between the maiden, representing life and spring, and the crone, representing death and winter.

== Cultural legacy ==

=== Literary media ===

Andrew Lang included the story in his 1890 publication &quot;The Red Fairy Book&quot;. Other versions of the tale also appear in &quot;A Book of Witches&quot; (1965) by Ruth Manning-Sanders and in Paul O. Zelinsky&#x27;s Caldecott Medal-winning picture book, &quot;Rapunzel&quot; (1997).

Anne Sexton wrote a poem called &quot;Rapunzel&quot; in her collection &quot;Transformations&quot; (1971), a book in which she re-envisions sixteen of the &quot;Grimm&#x27;s Fairy tales&quot;.

Donna Jo Napoli&#x27;s novel &quot;Zel&quot; (1996) retells the Rapunzel story from three perspectives: the maiden, her mother, and the prince.

&quot;Cress&quot; is the third book in the &quot;Lunar Chronicles&quot;, a young adult science fiction series written by Marissa Meyer that is an adaptation of &quot;Rapunzel&quot;. Crescent, nicknamed &quot;Cress&quot;, is a prisoner on a satellite who is rescued and falls in love with her hero &quot;Captain Thorne&quot; amidst the story about &quot;Cinder&quot; a cyborg version of Cinderella.

Kate Forsyth has written two books about Rapunzel, one is a fictional retelling of the tale and of the life of Mademoiselle de la Force entitled, &quot;Bitter Greens&quot;, and her second book was non-fiction describing the development of the tale entitled, &quot;The Rebirth of Rapunzel: A Mythic Biography of the Maiden in the Tower.&quot;

In Nikita Gill&#x27;s 2018 poetry collection &quot;Fierce Fairytales: &amp; Other Stories to Stir Your Soul&quot; she has several poems that reference Rapunzel or Rapunzel&#x27;s story including &quot;Rapunzel&#x27;s Note Left for Mother Gothel&quot; and &quot;Rapunzel, Rapunzel&quot;.

In 2022, Mary McMyne published a standalone adult historical fantasy novel &quot;The Book of Gothel,&quot; which speculates that the witch&#x27;s character was inspired by the life of a medieval midwife named Haelewise, daughter-of-Hedda, who lived in 12th century Germania. The novel is a revisionist backstory for Rapunzel that also connects to elements of Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood, and other tales.

* In &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; (2007), Rapunzel (voiced by Maya Rudolph) was friends with Princess Fiona. She is shown to be the true love of the evil Prince Charming and helps to fool Princess Fiona and her group when they try to escape from Prince Charming&#x27;s wrath.
* Walt Disney Animation Studios&#x27; &quot;Tangled&quot; (2010), which is a loose retelling and a computer-animated musical feature film. Princess Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) is more assertive in character, and was born a princess. Rapunzel also features in the short sequel, &quot;Tangled Ever After&quot; and its prequel film, &quot;&quot;.
* Walt Disney Pictures hired Ashleigh Powell to write the script for a live-action Rapunzel movie. It is unknown if the film will be a remake of &quot;Tangled&quot;, a new adaptation, or a combination of both.

=== Television media ===
==== Live action television media ====
&quot;Shirley Temple&#x27;s Storybook&quot; (1958–1961) featured a media of Rapunzel in an episode which aired on 27 October 1958. Carol Lynley played Rapunzel and Agnes Moorehead played the evil witch.

The fictional TV show, &quot;The Flora Follicle Show&quot; on &quot;Slim Goodbody in Nutri-City&quot; had a direct reference to the Rapunzel story, as Flora Follicle played Rapunzel to Lustre Lanolin&#x27;s Prince Charming.

In the American fairy tale miniseries, &quot;The Tenth Kingdom&quot; (2000), the main character, Virginia Lewis is cursed by a Gypsy witch. As a result, she grows hair reminiscent of Rapunzel&#x27;s and is locked away by the Huntsman in a tower.

Rapunzel appears in the &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; episode &quot;The Tower&quot; (2014), portrayed by Alexandra Metz. A second iteration of Rapunzel appears as one of the main antagonists in the seventh season of &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; (Season 7, 2018), portrayed by Gabrielle Anwar and Meegan Warner in flashbacks. In this season, Rapunzel is Lady Tremaine, the wicked stepmother to Cinderella.

The video of the song &quot;Circles&quot; by Post Malone is inspired by the story of Rapunzel.

==== Animated television media ====
The American television animated anthology series, &quot;Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child&quot; (1995-2000), the classic story is retold with a full African-American cast and set in New Orleans. The episode starred Tisha Campbell-Martin as Rapunzel, Whoopi Goldberg as Zenobia the Hoodoo Diva, Meshach Taylor as the Woodcutter, Hazelle Goodman as the Woodcutter&#x27;s Wife, Donald Fullilove as Friend #1, and Tico Wells as Friend #2.

The Mattel cartoon &quot;Ever After High&quot; (2013–2017), features Rapunzel&#x27;s identical twin daughters: Holly and Poppy O&#x27;Hair.

&quot;&quot; (2017–2020) is a 2D animated TV show based on Disney Animation&#x27;s computer animated musical feature film &quot;Tangled&quot;. Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi reprise their roles of Rapunzel and Eugene Fitzherbert. A new main character named Cassandra appears, who is Rapunzel&#x27;s feisty lady-in-waiting, and later revealed to be Mother Gothel&#x27;s biological daughter.

The Japanese anime series &quot;Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tale Classics&quot; (1987–1989) features the tale in its second season.

<text>Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski () (20 September 1503 – 1572) was a Polish Renaissance scholar, humanist and theologian, called &quot;the father of Polish democracy&quot;. His book &quot;De Republica emendanda&quot; (&quot;O poprawie Rzeczypospolitej&quot;) was widely read and praised across most of Renaissance Europe, influencing thinkers such as Jean Bodin, Hugo Grotius and Johannes Althusius.

==Life==
Modrzewski was born in Wolbórz (also known as Woybor, Voibor, Woibor, Wojbor, Woyborz and Wolborz), near Piotrków Trybunalski, the son of Jakub Modrzewski (1477–1529). Modrzewski family belonged to the gentry (though some authors speak of impoverished nobility), bore Jastrzębiec coat of arms, and held the hereditary title of mayor (&quot;wójt/vogt/advocatus&quot;) of Wolbórz. After graduating from the Kraków Academy, he was ordained a vicar and served under Archbishop Jan Łaski (the Elder), and later under the Bishop of Poznań, Jan Latalski. From 1530 he was connected to the court of Jan Łaski the Younger, the Primate of Poland and nephew of the elder Łaski. Having lived for a time in Germany, where he studied at the Lutheran University he met Martin Luther and other early Protestant reformers in Wittenberg. He also took care of the library of Erasmus bought by Łaski.

From 1540 onwards, he served as the titular parish priest in Brzeziny and Skoszewy. In 1541, during his stay in the capital, he met with Mikołaj Rej. Modrzewski advocated sending a mixed ecclesiastical and secular delegation to the 1545 Ecumenical Council of Trent (where he would be sent as a Polish delegate). He supported Irenicism (the importance of unity) and the democratic and ecumenical element in the Church. He became an official at the court of Sigismund II Augustus in 1547. Since he was leaning strongly towards the reformist circles (especially Calvinian and Arian/Polish brethren), he became in danger of being accused of heresy and was ultimately stripped of his ecclesiastical titles and offices. The king, however, issued a letter of protection for him. In 1553 he retired to his native Wolbórz.

Modrzewski debuted as a writer in 1543 with the work called &quot;Lascius, sive de poena homicidii&quot; (&quot;On The Penalty for Manslaughter&quot;; or &quot;Łaski, czyli O karze za mężobójstwo&quot; in Polish). In it, Modrzewski criticized the inequality prescribed by the law for different social classes: for example, while the penalty for killing a nobleman ranged from 120 &quot;grzywna&quot; – through life imprisonment – to death, the penalty for killing a peasant was only 10 &quot;grzywna&quot;. Yet it was &quot;On the Improvement of the Commonwealth&quot; (&quot;De Republica emendanda&quot;) that brought him eternal and international fame. In it, he advocated a strong monarchy that would protect the rights of all citizens. He postulated equality of all before the law, and criticized the 1565 ban on land-owning by non-nobles. He wrote that peasants should own the soil which they work, and that townsfolk should be able to buy land and be elected to offices (those rights were being reserved only for the nobility back then), demanded the reform (secularization) of education, and division between state and church. This treatise was translated into many European languages and earned him many enemies in the Church. Pope Paul V placed the book on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; (list of prohibited books).

==De Republica emendanda==
Modrzewski&#x27;s crowning achievement printed in 1551 was: &quot;Commentariorum De Republica emendanda libri quinque&quot; (&quot;Five Books of Commentaries on the Improvement of Commonwealth&quot;, or &quot;Rozważań o poprawie Rzeczypospolitej ksiąg pięć&quot; in Polish) published in the printing house of Łazarz Andrysowic. Originally it was to include all five manuscripts: 1. &quot;De Moribus&quot; (&quot;On Customs&quot;); 2. &quot;De Legibus&quot; (&quot;On Laws&quot;); 3. &quot;De Bello&quot; (&quot;On War&quot;); 4. &quot;De Ecclesia&quot; (&quot;On Church&quot;), and 5. &quot;De Schola&quot; (&quot;On School&quot;). However, as some of Modrevius&#x27; theses were considered unorthodox by the Church and opposed, only the three first books were included in the original publication.

The first complete edition – consisting of all five beforementioned books, and dialogues entitled: &quot;De utraque specie Coenae Domini&quot; (&#x27;On the twofold nature of the Lord&#x27;s Table&#x27;) – was published in 1554 in Basel by Johannes Oporinus, after which Modrzewski was forced to leave the capital. The first Polish translation by Cyprian Bazylik was published in Łosk in 1577. The book was widely read and praised across Renaissance Europe. It was translated into German, French, Spanish, and Russian in the 17th century.

<text>The history of [[opera]] in the English language commences in the 17th century.

==Earliest examples==
In England, one of opera&#x27;s antecedents in the 16th century was an afterpiece which came at the end of a play; often scandalous and consisting in the main of dialogue set to music arranged from popular tunes. In this respect such afterpieces anticipate the ballad operas of the 18th century. At the same time, the French masque was gaining a firm hold at the English Court, with lavish splendour and highly realistic scenery. Inigo Jones became the leading designer of these productions, and this style was to dominate the English stage for three centuries. These masques contained songs and dances. In Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Lovers Made Men&quot; (1617), &quot;the whole masque was sung after the Italian manner, stilo recitativo&quot;.

==Purcell and his contemporaries==
The approach of the English Commonwealth closed theatres and halted any developments that may have led to the establishment of English opera. However, in 1656, the dramatist Sir William Davenant produced &quot;The Siege of Rhodes&quot;. Since his theatre was not licensed to produce drama, he asked several of the leading composers (Henry Lawes, Cooke, Locke, Coleman and Hudson) to set sections of it to music. This success was followed by &quot;The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru&quot; (1658) and &quot;The History of Sir Francis Drake&quot; (1659). These pieces were encouraged by Oliver Cromwell because they were critical of Spain. With the English Restoration, foreign (especially French) musicians were welcomed back. In 1673, Thomas Shadwell&#x27;s &quot;Psyche&quot;, patterned on the 1671 &#x27;comédie-ballet&#x27; of the same name produced by Molière and Jean-Baptiste Lully. William Davenant produced &quot;The Tempest&quot; in the same year, which was the first Shakespeare play to be set to music (composed by Locke and Johnson).
About 1683, John Blow composed &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;, often thought of as the first true English-language opera. Blow&#x27;s immediate successor was the better known Henry Purcell. Despite the success of his masterwork &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; (1689), in which the action is furthered by the use of Italian-style recitative, much of Purcell&#x27;s best work was not involved in the composing of typical opera, but instead he usually worked within the constraints of the semi-opera format, where isolated scenes and masques are contained within the structure of a spoken play, such as Shakespeare in Purcell&#x27;s &quot;The Fairy-Queen&quot; (1692) and Beaumont and Fletcher in &quot;The Prophetess&quot; (1690) and &quot;Bonduca&quot; (1696). The main characters of the play tend not to be involved in the musical scenes, which means that Purcell was rarely able to develop his characters through song. Despite these hindrances, his aim (and that of his collaborator John Dryden) was to establish serious opera in England, but these hopes ended with Purcell&#x27;s early death at the age of 36.

==18th and 19th centuries==

Following Purcell, the popularity of opera in England dwindled. A revived interest in opera occurred in the 1730s, which is largely attributed to Thomas Arne both for his own compositions and for alerting Handel to the commercial possibilities of large-scale works in English. Arne was the first English composer to experiment with Italian-style all-sung comic opera, unsuccessfully in &quot;The Temple of Dullness&quot; (1745), &quot;Henry and Emma&quot; (1749) and &quot;Don Saverio&quot; (1750), but triumphantly in &quot;Thomas and Sally&quot; (1760). His opera &quot;Artaxerxes&quot; (1762) was the first attempt to set a full-blown opera seria in English and was a huge success, holding the stage until the 1830s. His modernized ballad opera, &quot;Love in a Village&quot; (1762), was equally novel and began a vogue for pastiche opera that lasted well into the 19th century. Arne was one of the few English composers of the era who, although imitating many elements of Italian opera, was able to move beyond it to create his own voice. Charles Burney wrote that Arne introduced &quot;a light, airy, original, and pleasing melody, wholly different from that of Purcell or Handel, whom all English composers had either pillaged or imitated&quot;.

Besides Arne, the other dominating forces in English opera at this time was George Frideric Handel, whose &quot;opera serias&quot; filled the London operatic stages for decades, and influenced most home-grown composers, such as John Frederick Lampe, to write using Italian models in imitation of him.

Throughout the second half of the 18th the most popular English genre proved to be ballad opera. Some notable composers include Arne&#x27;s son Michael Arne, Dibdin, Linley Jr., Arnold, Hook, Shield, the tenor Michael Kelly, Stephen Storace and Mozart&#x27;s favourite pupil Attwood. The most successful composer of the late Georgian era was Henry Bishop, whose song Home! Sweet Home! from the opera &quot;Clari, or the Maid of Milan&quot; is still popular today.
While throughout the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th composers had been influenced mainly by Italian opera, later in the century Meyerbeer&#x27;s grand operas and, further later, Wagner&#x27;s operas came to be regarded as the major models for imitation.

The beginning of the Victorian era saw a short but particularly intense period of creativity, roughly up to the 1850s, partially thanks to the keen interest in music of the Queen and of Prince Albert.
The Romantic operas of Michael Balfe (the only one whose fame spread throughout Europe), Julius Benedict, John Barnett, Edward Loder, G. A. Macfarren and William Wallace achieved great popularity both in Great Britain and Ireland.

John Barnett made a serious attempt to follow in the footsteps of Carl Maria von Weber with his opera &quot;The Mountain Sylph&quot; (1834), often mistakenly claimed as the first sung-through (i.e. completely sung) English opera, which was his only major success (and was later parodied by Gilbert and Sullivan in &quot;Iolanthe&quot;).
Among the main lanes in London for the production of English language opera in those times were Drury Lane, the Princess&#x27;s Theatre and the Lyceum. The King&#x27;s Theatre and the Covent Garden, which were the two major opera houses of the city, featured mostly Italian and French opera (the latter usually translated into Italian). This was a source of continuous vexation for English composers who, until late in the century, had to see their works translated into Italian to be performed on those stages.

Moreover, the constant presence of a foreign language opera season in the city meant that the operas of indigenous composers had constantly to compete with those of the great Italian composers, as well as those of Weber, Meyerbeer, Fromental Halévy and Gounod (the last three usually performed in Italian at the Covent Garden), which continued to dominate the musical stage in England. Beside Balfe, whose operas were translated into German, French and Italian (&quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot; as &quot;La Zingara&quot;, for Trieste), the only other composers to gain so renown on the Continent and to have their operas translated into a foreign language were Benedict (into his native German) and Wallace (also in German).
After the 1870s, the reputation of English Romantic Opera slowly started to decline until, by the end of the century, most critics&#x27; opinion was against them. The only works to be still performed well into the 1930s were &quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot;, &quot;Maritana&quot; and &quot;The Lily of Killarney&quot;.

Beside foreign opera and European operetta, the most popular forms of indigenous entertainment in the second half of the 19th century were burlesques and late Victorian era light operas, notably the Savoy Operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, both of which frequently spoofed operatic conventions.

Sullivan wrote only one grand opera, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (following the efforts of a number of young English composers beginning about 1876), but he claimed that even his light operas were to be part of an &quot;English&quot; opera school, intended to supplant the French operettas (usually in bad translations) that had dominated the London stage throughout the 19th century into the 1870s. London&#x27;s &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; agreed. Sullivan produced a few light operas in the late 1880s and 1890s that were of a more serious nature than most of the G&amp;S series, including &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;, &quot;Haddon Hall&quot; and &quot;The Beauty Stone&quot;, but &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (which ran for 155 consecutive performances, using alternating casts—a record then and now) survives as his only real grand opera.

Late in the century composers such as Isidore de Lara, Delius and Dame Ethel Smyth, owing to the difficulties of getting serious English operas staged at home, caused in part by the popularity of light opera, turned to the Continent to seek their fortune, with De Lara becoming very popular in France and in Italy (his opera Messaline being the first work by an Englishman to be produced at La Scala).

==20th century – today==
In the 20th century, English opera began to assert more independence, with works of Ralph Vaughan Williams and Rutland Boughton and later Benjamin Britten, who, in a series of fine works that remain in standard repertory today, revealed an excellent flair for the dramatic and superb musicality. 
Nevertheless, foreign influence (now coming mainly from Wagner, Tchaikovsky and Strauss), was still strong. One example is Josef Holbrooke&#x27;s &quot;The Cauldron of Annwn&quot; trilogy. The influence of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; can be seen in the choice of a mythological subject and also in the extensive use of &quot;leitmotivs&quot;, while harmony and orchestration are more reminiscent of Strauss. 
Other British composers writing well-received operas in the late 20th century include Thomas Wilson (e.g. &quot;The Confessions of a Justified Sinner&quot;), Richard Rodney Bennett (e.g. &quot;The Mines of Sulphur&quot;), Harrison Birtwistle (&quot;Punch and Judy&quot;), Peter Maxwell Davies (&quot;Taverner&quot;) and Oliver Knussen (&quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;). Today composers such as Thomas Adès continue to export English opera abroad.

Also in the 20th century, American composers like George Gershwin (&quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;), Scott Joplin (&quot;Treemonisha&quot;), Gian Carlo Menotti, Leonard Bernstein (&quot;Candide&quot;), and Carlisle Floyd began to contribute English-language operas, frequently infused with touches of popular musical styles. They were followed by Philip Glass (&quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;), Mark Adamo, John Adams (&quot;Nixon in China&quot;), and Jake Heggie. Moreover, non-native-English speaking composers have occasionally set English libretti (e.g. Kurt Weill, &quot;Street Scene&quot;; Igor Stravinsky, &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;; Hans Werner Henze, &quot;We Come to the River&quot;; Tan Dun, &quot;The First Emperor&quot;).

<text>Xerography is a dry photocopying technique. Originally called electrophotography, it was renamed xerography—from the Greek roots , meaning &quot;dry&quot; and , meaning &quot;writing&quot;—to emphasize that unlike reproduction techniques then in use such as cyanotype, the process of xerography used no liquid chemicals.

==History==
Xerography was invented by American physicist Chester Carlson, based significantly on contributions by Hungarian physicist Pál Selényi. Carlson applied for and was awarded on October 6, 1942.

Carlson&#x27;s innovation combined electrostatic printing with photography, unlike the dry electrostatic printing process invented by Georg Christoph Lichtenberg in 1778. Carlson&#x27;s original process was cumbersome, requiring several manual processing steps with flat plates. 

In 1946, Carlson signed an agreement with Haloid Photographic Company to develop it as a commercial product. Before that year, Carlson had proposed his idea to more than a dozen companies, but none was interested. Haloid&#x27;s president, Joseph C. Wilson, saw the promise of Carlson&#x27;s invention, and saw to it that Haloid diligently worked to produce a working commercial product. 

It was almost 18 years before a fully automated process was developed, the key breakthrough being the use of a cylindrical drum coated with selenium instead of a flat plate. This resulted in the first commercial automatic copier, the Xerox 914, being released by Haloid/Xerox in 1960. 

Xerography is now used in most photocopying machines and in laser and LED printers.

==Process==
The first commercial use was hand processing of a flat photosensor (an electrostatic component that detects the presence of visible light) with a copy camera and a separate processing unit to produce offset lithographic plates. 

By using a cylinder to carry the photosensor, automatic processing was enabled. In 1960, the automatic photocopier was created and many millions have been built since. Today this technology is used in photocopy machines, computer laser printers ( or LED printers ), microform printers and even digital presses which are slowly replacing many traditional offset presses in the printing industry for shorter runs. 

A metal cylinder called the drum is mounted to rotate about a horizontal axis. The drum rotates at the speed of paper output. One revolution passes the drum surface through the steps described below.

The end-to-end dimension is the width of print to be produced plus a generous tolerance. The drums in the copiers originally developed by Xerox Corporation were manufactured with a surface coating of amorphous selenium (more recently ceramic or organic photoconductor (OPC)), applied by vacuum deposition. Amorphous selenium will hold an electrostatic charge in darkness and will conduct away such a charge under light. In the original system, photocopiers that rely on silicon or selenium (and its alloys) are charged positively in use (hence work with negatively charged &quot;toner&quot; powder). In the 1970s, IBM Corporation sought to avoid Xerox&#x27;s patents for selenium drums by developing organic photoconductors as an alternative to the selenium drum. Photoconductors using organic compounds are electrochemically charged vice versa to the preceding system in order to exploit their native properties in printing. Organic photoconductors are now preferred because they can be deposited on a flexible, oval or triangular, belt instead of a round drum, facilitating significantly smaller device size.

Laser printer photo drums are made with a doped silicon diode sandwich structure with a hydrogen-doped silicon light-chargeable layer, a boron nitride rectifying (diode-causing) layer that minimizes current leakage, and a surface layer of silicon doped with oxygen or nitrogen; silicon nitride is a scuff-resistant material.

The steps of the process are described below as applied on a cylinder, as in a photocopier. Some variants are described within the text. Every step of the process has design variants. The physics of the xerographic process are discussed at length in a book.

; Step 1. Charging
An electrostatic charge of −600 volts is uniformly distributed over the surface of the drum by a corona discharge from a corona unit (Corotron), with output limited by a control grid or screen. This effect can also be achieved by using a contact roller with a charge applied to it. Essentially, a corona discharge is generated by a very thin
wire to  inch (6.35 to 12.7 mm) away from the photoconductor. A negative charge is placed on the wire, which will ionize the space between the wire and conductor, so electrons will be repelled and pushed away onto the conductor. The conductor is set on top of a conducting surface, kept at ground potential.

The polarity is chosen to suit the positive or negative process. Positive process is used for producing black on white copies. Negative process is used for producing black on white from negative originals (mainly microfilm) and all digital printing and copying. This is to economize on the use of laser light by the &quot;blackwriting&quot; or &quot;write to black&quot; exposure method.

; Step 2. Exposure
The document or microform to be copied is illuminated by flash lamps on the platen and either passed over a lens or scanned by a moving light and lens, such that its image is projected onto and synchronized with the moving drum surface. Alternatively, the image may be exposed using a xenon strobe illuminating the surface of the moving drum or belt, fast enough to render a perfect latent image. Where there is text or image on the document, the corresponding area of the drum will remain unlit. Where there is no image the drum will be illuminated and the charge will be dissipated. The charge that remains on the drum after this exposure is a &#x27;latent&#x27; image and is a negative of the original document.

Whether in a scanning or a stationary optical system, combinations of lenses and mirrors are used to project the original image on the platen (scanning surface) onto the photoconductor. Additional lenses, with different focal lengths or zooming lenses are utilized to enlarge or reduce the image; the scanning speed must adapt to elements or reductions.

A drum is inferior to a belt in the sense that although it is simpler than a belt, it must be buffered gradually in parts rolling on the curved drum, while the flat belt efficiently uses one exposure to make a direct passage.

In a laser or LED printer, modulated light is projected onto the drum surface to create the latent image. The modulated light is used only to create the positive image, hence the term &quot;blackwriting&quot;.

; Step 3. Development
In high-volume copiers, the drum is presented with a slowly turbulent mixture of toner particles and larger, iron, reusable carrier particles. Toner is a powder; its early form was carbon powder, then melt-mixed with a polymer. The carrier particles have a coating which, during agitation, generates a triboelectric charge (a form of static electricity), which attracts a coating of toner particles. In addition, the mix is manipulated with a magnetic roller to present to the surface of the drum or belt a brush of toner. By contact with the carrier each neutral toner particle has an electric charge of polarity opposite to the charge of the latent image on the drum. The charge attracts toner to form a visible image on the drum. To control the amount of toner transferred, a bias voltage is applied to the developer roller to counteract the attraction between toner and latent image.

Where a negative image is required, as when printing from a microform negative, then the toner has the same polarity as the corona in step 1. Electrostatic lines of force drive the toner particles away from the latent image towards the uncharged area, which is the area exposed from the negative.

Early color copiers and printers used multiple copy cycles for each page output, using colored filters and toners. Modern units use only a single scan to four separate, miniature process units, operating simultaneously, each with its own coronas, drum and developer unit.

; Step 4. Transfer
Paper is passed between the drum and the transfer corona, which has a polarity that is the opposite of the charge on the toner. The toner image is transferred from the drum to the paper by a combination of pressure and electrostatic attraction. On many color and high-speed machines, it is common to replace the transfer corona with one or more charged bias transfer rollers, which apply greater pressure and produce a higher quality image.

; Step 5. Separation or detack
Electric charges on the paper are partially neutralized by AC from a second corona, usually constructed in tandem with the transfer corona and immediately after it. As a result, the paper, complete with most (but not all) of the toner image, is separated from the drum or belt surface.

; Step 6. Fixing or fusing
The toner image is permanently fixed to the paper using either a heat and pressure mechanism (hot roll fuser) or a radiant fusing technology (oven fuser) to melt and bond the toner particles into the medium (usually paper) being printed. There also used to be available &quot;offline&quot; vapor fusers. These were trays covered in cotton gauze sprinkled with a volatile liquid, such as ether. When the transferred image was brought into proximity with the vapor from the evaporating liquid, the result was a perfectly fixed copy without any of the distortion or toner migration which can occur with the other methods. This method is no longer used due to emissions of fumes.

; Step 7. Cleaning
The drum, having already been partially discharged during detack, is further discharged by light. Any remaining toner, that did not transfer in step 6, is removed from the drum surface by a rotating brush under suction, or a squeegee known as the cleaning blade. This &#x27;waste&#x27; toner usually is routed into a waste toner compartment for later disposal; however, in some systems, it is routed back into the developer unit for reuse. This process, known as toner reclaim, is much more economical, but can possibly lead to a reduced overall toner efficiency through a process known as &#x27;toner polluting&#x27; whereby concentration levels of toner/developer having poor electrostatic properties are permitted to build up in the developer unit, reducing the overall efficiency of the toner in the system.

Some systems have abandoned the separate developer (carrier). These systems, known as monocomponent, operate as above, but use either a magnetic toner or fusible developer. There is no need to replace worn-out developer, as the user effectively replaces it along with the toner. An alternative developing system, developed by KIP from an abandoned line of research by Xerox, completely replaces magnetic toner manipulation and the cleaning system, with a series of computer-controlled, varying biases. The toner is printed directly onto the drum, by direct contact with a rubber developing roller which, by reversing the bias, removes all the unwanted toner and returns it to the developer unit for reuse.

The development of xerography has led to new technologies that have the potential to eventually eradicate traditional offset printing machines. These new machines that print in full CMYK color, such as Xeikon, use xerography but provide nearly the quality of traditional ink prints.

== Durability ==
Xerographic documents (and the closely related laser printer printouts) can have excellent archival durability, depending on the quality of the paper used. If low-quality paper is used, it can yellow and degrade due to residual acid in the untreated pulp; in the worst case, old copies can literally crumble into small particles when handled. High-quality xerographic copies on acid-free paper can last as long as typewritten or handwritten documents on the same paper. However, xerographic copies are vulnerable to undesirable toner transfer if they are stored in direct contact or close proximity to plasticizers, which are present in looseleaf binders made with PVC. In extreme cases, the ink toner will stick directly to the binder cover, pulling away from the paper copy and rendering it illegible.

==Uses in animation==
Ub Iwerks adapted xerography to eliminate the hand-inking stage in the animation process by printing the animator&#x27;s drawings directly to the animation cels. The first animated feature film to use this process was &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; (1961), although the technique was already tested in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, released two years earlier. At first, only black lines were possible, but in 1977, gray lines were introduced and used in &quot;The Rescuers&quot; and in the 1980s, colored lines were introduced and used in animated features like &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;.

==Uses in art==
Xerography has been used by photographers internationally as a direct imaging photographic process, by book artists for publishing one-of-a-kind books or multiples, and by collaborating artists in portfolios such as those produced by the International Society of Copier Artists founded by American printmaker and book artist, Louise Odes Neaderland. Art critic Roy Proctor said of artist/curator Louise Neaderland during her residency for the exhibition &quot;Art ex Machina&quot; at 1708 Gallery in Richmond, Virginia, &quot;She&#x27;s living proof that, when a new technology begins to be mass-produced, artists will be curious enough—and imaginative enough—to explore its creative uses.

<text>Steven Alan Hawley (born December 12, 1951) is a former NASA astronaut who flew on five U.S. Space Shuttle flights. He is professor of physics and astronomy and director of engineering physics at the University of Kansas.

== Early life ==
Hawley was born December 12, 1951, in Ottawa, Kansas, to Dr. and Mrs. Bernard Hawley. One of Hawley&#x27;s brothers, John F. Hawley, was a theoretical astrophysicist at the University of Virginia and shared the Shaw Prize in Astronomy in 2013.

Hawley graduated from Salina High School Central, Salina, Kansas, in 1969; he regards Salina as his home town. Hawley attended the University of Kansas, graduating with highest distinction in 1973 with Bachelor of Science degrees in Physics and in Astronomy. He spent three summers employed as a research assistant: 1972 at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., and 1973 and 1974 at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia. He attended graduate school at Lick Observatory, University of California, Santa Cruz, principal advisor was William L. Burke graduating in 1977 with a Doctorate in Astronomy and Astrophysics.

== Career ==
Hawley&#x27;s research involved spectrophotometry of gaseous nebulae and emission-line galaxies, with particular emphasis on chemical abundance determinations for these objects. The results of his research have been published in major astronomical journals. Prior to his selection by NASA in 1978, Hawley was a post-doctoral research associate at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in La Serena, Chile. He is a Professor (Emeritus) of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Kansas.

== Space flight experience ==
Hawley logged a total of 770 hours and 27 minutes in five space flights. He served as a mission specialist on STS-41D in 1984, STS-61C in 1986, STS-31 in 1990, STS-82 in 1997 and STS-93 in 1999. Hawley was the last member of NASA Astronaut Group 8 to make a space flight. He is also the only astronaut to deploy the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and later fly on one of its servicing missions (STS-31 and STS-82, respectively).

=== &quot;Discovery&quot; 41D ===
STS-41-D &quot;Discovery&quot; (August 30 to September 5, 1984) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on its maiden flight and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the seven-day mission, the crew successfully activated the OAST-1 solar cell wing experiment, deployed the SBS-D, SYNCOM IV-2, and TELSTAR 3-C satellites, operated the CFES-III experiment, the student crystal growth experiment, as well as photography experiments using the IMAX motion picture camera. The mission was completed in 96 orbits of the Earth in 144 hours and 57 minutes.

Following an aborted attempt to launch STS-41-D where two main engines were stopped shortly after they started because the third failed to start, Hawley is reported to have broken the tense atmosphere in the shuttle cabin, saying, &quot;Gee, I thought we&#x27;d be a lot higher at MECO!&quot;
=== &quot;Columbia&quot; 61C ===
STS-61-C &quot;Columbia&quot; (January 12–18, 1986) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to a night landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the six-day flight, the crew deployed the SATCOM K1 satellite and conducted experiments in astrophysics and materials processing. Mission duration was 146 hours and 03 minutes.

=== &quot;Discovery&quot; 31 ===
STS-31 &quot;Discovery&quot; ( April 24–29, 1990) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and also returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the five-day mission, the crew deployed the Hubble Space Telescope, and conducted a variety of middeck experiments involving the study of protein crystal growth, polymer membrane processing, and the effects of weightlessness and magnetic fields on an ion arc. They also operated a variety of cameras, including both the IMAX in-cabin and cargo bay cameras, for Earth observations from their record-setting altitude of 380 miles. The mission was completed in 76 orbits of the earth in 121 hours.

=== &quot;Discovery&quot; 82 ===
STS-82 &quot;Discovery&quot; (February 11–21, 1997), the second Hubble Space Telescope (HST) maintenance mission, was launched at night and returned to a night landing at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. During the flight, Hawley&#x27;s primary role was to operate the Shuttle&#x27;s 50-foot robot arm to retrieve and redeploy the HST following completion of upgrades and repairs. Hawley also operated the robot arm during five spacewalks in which two teams installed two new spectrometers and eight replacement instruments. They also replaced insulation patches over three compartments containing key data-processing, electronics and scientific-instrument telemetry packages. HST was then redeployed and boosted to a higher orbit. The flight was completed in 149 orbits covering 3.8 million miles in 9 days, 23 hours, 37 minutes.

=== &quot;Columbia&quot; 93 ===
STS-93 &quot;Columbia&quot; (July 22–27, 1999) was launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center on a five-day mission returning to KSC for the 12th night landing in the Shuttle Program&#x27;s history. Hawley served as &quot;Columbia&quot;″s flight engineer. The primary mission objective was the successful deployment of the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the third of NASA&#x27;s Great Observatories after Hubble Space Telescope and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. Hawley also served as the primary operator of a second telescope carried in the crew module and used for several days to make broadband ultraviolet observations of a variety of Solar System objects. The mission completed 79 orbits in 4 days, 22 hours, and 50 minutes.

== Organizations ==
Hawley is a member of the American Astronomical Society, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Sigma Pi Sigma, and Phi Beta Kappa. Now retired, he resides in Lawrence, Kansas, where his parents also live.

== Personal life ==
Hawley married fellow astronaut Sally Ride in 1982. The couple divorced in 1987. Subsequently, he married Eileen M. Keegan of Redondo Beach, California, a former public-affairs officer at NASA who was appointed as spokeswoman for then-Kansas Governor Sam Brownback in 2013.

He enjoys basketball, softball, golf, running, playing bridge, and umpiring. Hawley appeared on an episode of &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, alongside Space Shuttle Commander, Kenneth Bowersox.

<text>The French , sometimes literally translated as ruse of war, is a non-uniform term; generally what is understood by &quot;ruse of war&quot; can be separated into two groups. The first classifies the phrase purely as an act of military deception against one&#x27;s opponent; the second emphasizes acts against one&#x27;s opponent by creative, clever, unorthodox means, sometimes involving force multipliers or superior knowledge. The term stratagem, from Ancient Greek (, &#x27;act of generalship&#x27;), is also used in this sense.

 are described from ancient to modern times, both in semi-mythical accounts such as the story of the Trojan Horse in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, and in well-documented events such as the flying of the American flag by the British ocean liner RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; in 1915 (whilst the United States was a neutral country) to deter attack by German submarines; they also feature in fiction.

The term is given legal meaning within the rules of war. Good faith is required, but at least 17 different types of , including ambushes, false radio messages, the use of spies and the use of dummy guns, are considered legitimate as long as they do not involve treachery or perfidy. Landmines and similar traps can be considered perfidious under the rules in certain circumstances. Explicitly prohibited under article 23 of the Hague Convention of 1907 include improper use of a flag of truce or the military insignia of the enemy.

==Examples==
===Ancient times===
According to Homer&#x27;s somewhat mythical account in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the Greeks during the Trojan War pretended to give up their fruitless ten-year siege of the city of Troy and sailed away, leaving behind the Trojan Horse. After the Trojans pulled what they believed was a parting gift within the walls of the city, soldiers that had hidden inside the hollow horse during the previous night emerged and opened the city&#x27;s gates, allowing the awaiting army to enter the city.

Prior to a naval battle with King Eumenes II of Pergamon, Hannibal sent a herald with a message for the opposing commander. That was a trick aiming to locate Eumenes&#x27;s ship so that Hannibal could concentrate his forces against it.

Alexander the Great walked his men up and down a river continuously to condition his opponent, Porus, into a false sense of security in the belief that his whole army was searching for a ford. Then, under the cover of night Alexander marched a contingent of his men upriver and crossed the Indus, while his remaining forces marched south to their camp as they usually did. This feint allowed Alexander to hide his troops&#x27; location and win the Battle of Hydaspes in 326 BC.

As stated in the probably fictional account in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Zhuge Liang tricked Sima Yi using the Empty Fort Strategy from Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;The Art of War&quot;. Zhuge Liang sat upon the walls of the cities, his men far outnumbered by the Wei army which was advancing toward him. Zhuge Liang sat upon the walls and played his instrument, seemingly calm and composed, tricking Sima Yi into thinking that the Shu troops had hidden in the surrounding area for an ambush. Zhuge Liang was able to quickly flee the area as the Wei retreated.

===Modern history===

====19th century====
The Siege of Detroit was an early engagement in the War of 1812, where a smaller British-First Nations force, led by Major-General Isaac Brock and Shawnee leader Tecumseh, used bluff and deception to intimidate Brigadier General William Hull into surrendering the fort, the town of Detroit, and a dispirited American force that nevertheless outnumbered the British and First Nations. Intercepting American dispatches from Fort Detroit, Brock judged the morale of the American garrison to be low, and that the American general had a fear of First Nations in particular. Brock arranged for misleading letters to fall into American hands, stating an inflated figure of 5,000 First Nations warriors were already in Amherstburg, to simulate a larger First Nations force had attached themselves to his army. Prior to the siege, Brock also sent a letter demanding for surrender to Hull, stating:
To further the illusion that a large First Nations force was attached with Brock&#x27;s force, Tecumseh extended his men, and marched them three times through an opening in the woods at the rear of the fort in full view of the fort. Brock similarly dressed members of the Canadian militia as British regulars, and instructed soldiers to light individual fires instead of one fire per unit, thereby creating the illusion of a much larger army.

Use of deception to mask an inferior force was also used in another battle during the War of 1812, the Battle of Chateauguay. Outnumbered during battle, the Canadian Fencibles were initially outflanked and falling back, before Lieutenant-Colonel Charles de Salaberry of the Canadian Voltigeurs ordered bugle calls, cheers and Indian war whoops, in a ruse to make the Americans believe that they were about to be enveloped. Fearing themselves outnumbered and about to be outflanked, Brigadier-General Wade Hampton called off the American advance, withdrawing his forces to Plattsburgh, New York.

During the American Civil War, Union General George Meade&#x27;s General Order No. 13 of 1865 was retracted after it was determined that his criticism of Brigadier-General McLaughlin was based on &quot;nothing more than the obvious result of those &quot;ruses de guerre&quot;, by which the very best officers may, at times, be victimized&quot;, after the Confederate Army falsely claimed that it had gained a foothold in the Union Army lines.

====20th century====
An effort by the Imperial Japanese Navy to lure the Russian fleet out of its harbor during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a clever ruse of war to entice the Russian ships out of Port Arthur&quot;.

The use of the American flag flown on the liner &quot;Lusitania&quot; while crossing through the Irish Sea to avoid attack by German submarines during the First World War was criticized in debate in the United States House of Representatives by Republican Eben Martin of South Dakota, who stated that &quot;the United States cannot be made a party to a ruse of war where the national colors are involved&quot;.

During the Second World War, the crew of the merchant-raiding German light cruiser Emden rigged a dummy fourth funnel on top of her radio room to disguise her as a British cruiser, most of which were equipped with four funnels. During First and Second World Wars, Q-ships were heavily armed merchant ships with concealed weaponry, designed to lure submarines into making surface attacks. This gave Q-ships the chance to open fire and sink them.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the former Imperial Japanese Navy battleship , which had been taken out of reserve shortly after the outbreak of war for use as a troop transport but then converted to a repair ship, was fitted with dummy wooden main batteries fore and aft to resemble an old battleship after her arrival in Shanghai on 29 December 1938.

In the lead up to the First Battle of Sirte during the Second World War, the fast minelayer successfully impersonated a force of two battleships using false signals traffic, as part of a decoy mission against Italian forces.

The Allied Combined Operations raid on the Normandie Dock in Saint Nazaire employed several legitimate ruses during their voyage up the Loire estuary, including flying German colours and replying to signal challenges by giving misleading replies in German. These measures were all designed to buy time for the attacking force. When these tactics ceased to be effective and German shore batteries opened fire in earnest, all the British ships lowered their German colours and hoisted White Ensigns before returning fire.

German commando Otto Skorzeny led his troops wearing American uniforms to infiltrate American lines in Operation Greif during the Battle of the Bulge. Skorzeny later reported that he was told by experts in military law that wearing American uniforms was a defensible &quot;ruse de guerre&quot;, provided his troops took off their American uniforms, and put on German uniforms, prior to firing their weapons. Skorzeny was acquitted by a United States military court in Dachau in 1947, after his defense counsel argued that the &quot;wearing of American uniforms was a legitimate ruse of war for espionage and sabotage&quot; as described by &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==In relation to the rules of war==
===Good faith===
According to the rules of war, good faith in dealing with the enemy must be observed as a rule of conduct, but this does not prevent measures such as using spies and secret agents, encouraging defection or insurrection among the enemy civilian population, corrupting enemy civilians or soldiers by bribes, or inducing the enemy&#x27;s soldiers to desert, surrender, or rebel. In general, a belligerent may resort to those measures for mystifying or misleading the enemy against which the enemy ought to take measures to protect itself.

===Legitimate ruses===
Legitimate ruses include:
* surprises; ambushes; feigned attacks, retreats, or flights;
* simulating quiet and inactivity (to lull the enemy into complacency);
* use of small forces to simulate large units (for example, inducing an enemy unit to surrender by pretending that it is surrounded by a large force);
* transmitting false or misleading radio or telephone messages;
* deception of the enemy by bogus orders purporting to have been issued by the enemy commander;
* making use of the enemy&#x27;s signals and passwords or secret handshakes;
* pretending to communicate with nonexistent troops or reinforcements;
* deceptive supply movements (which might make the enemy think you are preparing for action when you&#x27;re not);
* deliberate planting of false information;
* use of spies and secret agents;
* moving landmarks (to confuse the enemy operating in unfamiliar territory);
* putting up dummy guns and vehicles or laying dummy mines;
* erection of dummy installations and airfields (to intimidate or encourage useless attack);
* removing unit identifications (but not those that identify the belligerent while in combat) from uniforms;
* psychological warfare activities;
* disguising a warship to appear to be a neutral merchant vessel, or a merchant vessel on the side of one&#x27;s opponent, has traditionally been considered a legitimate &quot;ruse de guerre&quot;, provided the belligerent raises their own flag to break the deception before firing their guns. This was called &quot;sailing under false colors&quot;. Both sides during the world wars used this tactic, most famously the Royal Navy&#x27;s Q ships. The German raider used this tactic against the superior , disguising herself as the Dutch merchant vessel &quot;Straat Malakka&quot; prior to their mutually destructive engagement.
* disguising a warship to appear to be one of the warships of one&#x27;s opponent has traditionally been considered to be a legitimate &quot;ruse de guerre&quot;, provided the belligerent raises their own flag to drop the disguise, prior to firing their guns. The Germans took steps to disguise their pocket battleships as Allied cruisers during the Second World War. This tactic was also used by the Royal Navy to great effect during the Napoleonic Wars, since the boarding and capture of enemy vessels was quite common during that time, and information about the current ownership of vessels was not easy to disseminate rapidly.

===No perfidy===
Further, according to the rules of war, ruses of war are legitimate so long as they do not involve perfidy on the part of the belligerent resorting to them. They are, however, forbidden if they contravene any generally accepted rule.

* traps that are attached or associated in any way with:
** sick, wounded, or dead;
** burial, cremation, or graves;

===Prohibited ruses===
Article 23 of the 1907 Hague Convention &quot;IV – The Laws and Customs of War on Land&quot; provides that: &quot;It is especially forbidden...(b) To kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army...(f) To make improper use of a flag of truce, of the national flag, or of the military insignia and military uniform of the enemy, as well as the distinctive badges of the Geneva Convention&quot;. Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions expanded the rules of prohibiting certain type of ruses as defined in Articles 37, 38, and 39.

The line of demarcation between legitimate ruses and forbidden acts of perfidy is sometimes indistinct. In general, it would be an improper practice to secure an advantage over the enemy by deliberate lying or misleading conduct which involves a breach of faith, or when there is a moral obligation to speak the truth. For example, it is improper to pretend to surrender to secure an advantage over the opposing belligerent.

To broadcast to the enemy that an armistice had been agreed upon when such is not the case would be treacherous. Abuse of the protections afforded to medical personnel (by disguising combat soldiers as medics, or by putting a red cross on a combat vehicle) is also considered unacceptable. In August 1946, a German soldier, Heinz Hagendorf, was found guilty by a U.S. military tribunal at the Dachau Trials and sentenced to six months imprisonment for having &quot;wrongfully used the Red Cross emblem in a combat zone by firing a weapon at American soldiers from an enemy ambulance displaying such emblem.&quot; The verdict and sentence were upheld on appeal.

<text>Richard Michael Mullane (born September 10, 1945; Col, USAF, Ret.) is an engineer and weapon systems officer, a retired USAF officer, and a former NASA astronaut. During his career, he flew as a mission specialist on STS-41-D, STS-27, and STS-36.

==Early life and education==
Richard Michael Mullane was born September 10, 1945, in Wichita Falls, Texas. At the time of his birth, his father, Hugh, was serving as a flight engineer on a B-17 in the Pacific War. His family moved regularly until his father was diagnosed with polio and lost the use of his legs, causing the family to move to Albuquerque, New Mexico. He was a Second Class Scout in the Boy Scouts of America. He graduated from St. Pius X High School, Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1963, then received a Bachelor of Science degree in military engineering from the United States Military Academy in 1967 and was awarded a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology in 1975.

==Air force career==
Mullane, an air force colonel, graduated from West Point in 1967. He completed 134 combat missions as an RF-4C weapon systems officer while stationed at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, Vietnam, from January to November 1969. He subsequently served a 4-year tour of duty, in England. In July 1976, upon completing the USAF Flight Test Engineer Course at Edwards Air Force Base, California, he was assigned as a flight test weapon systems officer to the 3246th Test Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in January 1978, Mullane became an astronaut in August 1979. He flew on three Space Shuttle missions, serving as a mission specialist on the crew of STS-41-D in August 1984, on STS-27 in December 1988, and on STS-36 in March 1990.

On his first mission Mullane served as a mission specialist on the crew of STS-41-D, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 30, 1984. This was the maiden flight of the Orbiter &quot;Discovery&quot;. During this seven-day mission the crew successfully activated the OAST-1 solar cell wing experiment, deployed three satellites, operated the CFES-III experiment, the student crystal growth experiment, and photography experiments using the IMAX motion picture camera. STS 41-D completed 96 orbits of the Earth in 145 hours before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on September 5, 1984.

Mullane then was assigned to STS-62-A, the first Shuttle mission scheduled to launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base, but the mission was canceled after the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. After the Shuttle returned to service, he flew aboard the Orbiter &quot;Atlantis&quot;, on STS-27, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on December 2, 1988. The mission carried a Department of Defense (DOD) payload, as well as a number of secondary payloads. After 68 orbits of the earth, the mission concluded with a dry lakebed landing on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on December 6, 1988. Mission duration was 105 hours. The mission is noteworthy due to the severe damage Atlantis sustained to its critical heat-resistant tiles during ascent.

On his third flight, Mullane served on the crew of STS-36, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on February 28, 1990, aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;. This mission carried DOD payloads and a number of secondary payloads. After 72 orbits of the earth, the STS-36 mission concluded with a lakebed landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on March 4, 1990.

With the completion of his third flight, Mullane logged a total of 356 hours in space. He retired from NASA and the Air Force July 1, 1990.

==Post-NASA career==
In 2006, Mullane published an autobiography, &quot;Riding Rockets: The Outrageous Tales of a Space Shuttle Astronaut&quot;, that details his life before and during the space program, and expresses critical views towards the culture of the NASA Astronaut Corps. Mullane appeared on the United States television show &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; on Monday, February 13, 2006, to promote his book.

==Career==
Following graduation from Purdue University he worked as a civil engineering technician, land acquisition specialist and forest firefighter for the U.S. Forest Service. Subsequently, he was a design engineer with the Bendix Aerospace Company where he worked on aerodynamic analysis, missile subsystem design, and flight testing. He also was employed as project engineer with the Naval Sea Systems Command with responsibility for computer-controlled manufacturing systems.

Walker applied for the 1978 astronaut class but was unsuccessful, as he was neither affiliated with a major university nor had a PhD. He saw the new Payload Specialist program as another way to fly in space, and sought a job that might give him the opportunity to serve as one. He joined the McDonnell Douglas Corporation in 1977 as a test engineer on the Aft Propulsion Subsystem for the Space Shuttle orbiters, then the company&#x27;s Space Manufacturing (later named Electrophoresis Operations in Space, EOS) team as one of its original members. Walker shares in a patent for the McDonnell Douglas-developed continuous flow electrophoresis (CFES) device. McDonnell Douglas&#x27; main partner was Ortho Pharmaceutical, which hoped to manufacture large amounts of purified erythropoietin in space.

 From 1979 to 1986, Walker was chief test engineer and payload specialist for the McDonnell Douglas EOS commercialization project, having told company management that he was interested in flying in space if possible. Walker led the EOS laboratory test and operations team developing biomedical products. His contributions to the program included engineering planning, design and development, product research, and space flight and evaluation of the CFES device. Walker was involved with the program support activities at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and at the Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas. He was responsible for training the NASA astronaut crews in the operation of the CFES payload on STS-4, STS-6, STS-7, and STS-8 shuttle flights during 1982 and 1983. In May 1986, Walker was appointed Special Assistant to the President of McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Company, working in Washington, D.C.

Walker has been an industry member of the NASA Microgravity Material Science Assessment Task Force, the NASA Space Station Office Quick-is Beautiful/Rapid Response Research Study Group, and the NASA Space Station Operations Task Force. He has been a member of the National Research Council&#x27;s Space Applications Board. Walker was Faculty Course Advisor and lecturer for the International Space university 1988 summer session. He was a participant in the 1988 Center for Strategic and International Studies&#x27; civil Space policy study. He served on the AIAA steering committee formulating the strategic plan for NASA&#x27;s office of Commercial Programs. Walker has served as a founding board member of the Astronauts Memorial Foundation. He was the organizing committee chairman for the 1992 World Space Congress. He has been a national panel member of the NASA/Industry Manned Flight Awareness Program and the NASA/Industry Education Initiative. Walker advised the NASA/Purdue University space life support research center, a NASA/Penn State space commercial development center and a U.S. Department of Education/Ohio State University science education center. He has been a board director of the Challenger Center for Space Science Education. Walker has served as the volunteer chairman of the board of directors of Spacecause, and is past president and board director of the National Space Society. He has also been a board director of the Association of Space Explorers. As an advisor, Walker works with commercial space firms Space Adventures, Ltd and Deep Space Industries, Inc., and the Commercial Spaceflight Federation. Walker is a professional engineer registered in California. He has been an expert witness testifying before committees of the U.S. Congress. He has authored several papers and book contributions on the EOS electrophoresis program, space development, commercialization, and space history. Walker has also written columns and articles appearing in national newspapers and numerous other publications.

Walker retired in 2005 as the Director for NASA Systems Government Relations with the Washington D.C. Operations office of The Boeing Company. In 2018, Walker, joined Solstar as an advisor. Walker is currently a consultant, author and lecturer.

==NASA activities==
 STS-4 demonstrated the difficulty of Walker assisting astronauts with the complex CFES device. He and others could not speak directly to the space shuttle; the capsule communicator and two other people approved and relayed all messages to space. McDonnell Douglas proposed that Walker fly as a payload specialist to operate the CFES himself. NASA calculated that flying Walker would cost McDonnell Douglas $40,000 per flight, and in May 1983 he was assigned to STS-41-D.

Walker&#x27;s flight was part of a NASA effort in the 1980s to fly civilians on the shuttle. Although Europeans were training for Spacelab Payload Specialist duties, Walker remained a McDonnell Douglas employee, and commuted between company headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri and the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Training included a flight on a Northrop T-38 Talon jet trainer aircraft, and about 40 flights on the &quot;Vomit Comet&quot;. He later stated that his experience showed that a &quot;working passenger&quot; could fly after an abbreviated training program of a few months.

Although Walker believed at the time that 41-D would be his only flight, he also accompanied the CFES equipment on STS-51-D, and STS-61-B, accumulating 20 days of experience in space and traveling 8.2 million miles. Aboard these Space Shuttle missions Walker also performed early protein crystal growth experiments and participated as a test subject in numerous medical studies. He began training fellow McDonnell Douglas employee Robert Wood to fly on STS-61-M in 1986, and expected to fly at least once more himself, perhaps on Space Station Freedom, before the destruction of &quot;Challenger&quot; in January 1986 ended commercial shuttle payloads.

Since 1986 Walker has served in various NASA study and review team capacities including as a member of the NASA Microgravity Material Science Assessment Task Force, the NASA Space Station Office Quick-is-Beautiful/Rapid Response Research Study Group, the NASA Space Station Operations Task Force, and the International Space Station Strategic Roadmap Committee. He has served on the national panels of the NASA/Industry Manned Flight Awareness Program and the NASA/Industry Education Initiative. He also makes a public appearance occasionally to sign memorabilia at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex and also appears for the complex&#x27;s &quot;Lunch with an Astronaut&quot; program.

<doc id="499572" wikidata="Q2719799" url="?curid=499572" title="Culture of the Dominican Republic">
<text>The culture of the [[Dominican Republic]] is a diverse mixture of different influences from around the world. The Dominican people and their customs have origins consisting predominantly in a European cultural basis, with native Taíno and African influences.

The Dominican Republic was the site of the first European settlement in the Western Hemisphere, namely Santo Domingo founded in 1493. As a result of over five centuries of Spanish presence in the island, the core of Dominican culture is derived from the culture of Spain. The European inheritances include ancestry, language, traditions, law, the predominant religion and the colonial architectural styles. Soon after the arrival of Europeans, African people were imported to the island to serve as slave labor. The fusion of European, native Taino, and African traditions and customs contributed to the development of present-day Dominican culture.

== Language ==
Spanish is the official language in the Dominican Republic. The country has a variety of accents most of which derive from the Spanish spoken in the Canary Islands and western Andalusia of southern Spain. The accent spoken in the Cibao region is a mixture of two dialects: that of the 16th- and 17th-century Portuguese colonists in the Cibao valley, and that of the 18th-century Canarian settlers. Dominican Spanish also has borrowed vocabularies from the Arawak language. Some common words derived from the Taino natives include: &quot;barbecue&quot;, &quot;canoe&quot;, &quot;caribbean&quot;, &quot;hammock&quot;, &quot;hurricane&quot;, &quot;iguana&quot;, &quot;manatee&quot;, &quot;mangrove&quot;, &quot;savannah&quot;, and &quot;tobacco&quot; among others.

Schools in the Dominican Republic are based on a Spanish educational model. Both English and French are taught as secondary languages on private and public schools. Haitian Creole is spoken by the population of Haitian origin. There is a community of about 8,000 speakers of Samaná English in the Samaná Peninsula. They are the descendants of formerly enslaved Africans who arrived in the nineteenth century. Tourism, American pop culture, the influence of Dominican Americans, and the country&#x27;s economic ties with the United States motivates other Dominicans to learn English.

== Religion ==
The Dominican Republic is 68.9% Roman Catholic, 18.2% Evangelical, 10.6% with no religion, and 2.3% other. Recent immigration, as well as proselytizing, has brought other religions, with the following shares of the population: Spiritist: 2.2%, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: 1.1%, Buddhist: 0.1%, Baháʼí: 0.1%, Chinese Folk Religion: 0.1%, Islam: 0.02%, Judaism: 0.01%.
The nation has two patroness saints: &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Altagracia&quot; (Our Lady Of High Grace) and &quot;Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes&quot; (Our Lady Of Mercy).

The Catholic Church began to lose popularity in the late 19th century. This was due to a lack of funding, of priests, and of support programs. During the same time, the Protestant evangelical movement began to gain support. Religious tension between Catholics and Protestants in the country has been rare.

There has always been religious freedom throughout the entire country. Not until the 1950s were restrictions placed upon churches by Trujillo. Letters of protest were sent against the mass arrests of government adversaries. Trujillo began a campaign against the church and planned to arrest priests and bishops who preached against the government. This campaign ended before it was even put into place, with his assassination.

During World War II, a group of Jews escaping Nazi Germany fled to the Dominican Republic and founded the city of Sosúa. It has remained the center of the Jewish population since.

== Music ==
Musically, the Dominican Republic is known for the creation of multiple musical styles and genres. The country&#x27;s music culture is mostly recognized for &quot;merengue&quot;, a lively, fast-paced rhythm and dance music consisting of a tempo of about 120 to 160 beats per minute (though it varies) based on musical elements like African drums, brass, piano, chorded instruments, and traditionally the accordion, as well as some elements unique to the Dominican Republic, such as the &quot;tambora&quot; and &quot;güira&quot;. Its syncopated beats use Latin percussion, brass instruments, bass, and piano or keyboard. Between 1937 and 1950 merengue music was promoted internationally by Dominican groups like Chapuseaux and Damirón &quot;Los Reyes del Merengue&quot;, Joseito Mateo, and others. Radio, television, and international media popularized it further. Some well-known merengue performers include Johnny Ventura, singer/songwriter Juan Luis Guerra, Fernando Villalona, Eddy Herrera, Sergio Vargas, Toño Rosario, Milly Quezada, and Chichí Peralta. Merengue became popular in the United States, mostly on the East Coast, during the 1980s and 1990s, when many Dominican artists, among them Víctor Roque y La Gran Manzana, Henry Hierro, Milly Jocelyn y Los Vecinos, residing in the U.S. (particularly New York) started performing in the Latin club scene and gained radio airplay. The emergence of &quot;bachata&quot;, along with an increase in the number of Dominicans living among other Latino groups in New York, New Jersey, Florida and Massachusetts contributed to Dominican music&#x27;s overall growth in popularity.
Bachata is a guitar-based genre that originated in the Dominican countryside and developed into a music style in urban Santo Domingo&#x27;s shantytowns in the 1960s. The term &quot;bachata&quot; originally referred to informal gatherings in backyards. Early bachata drew influence from a wide range of Latin American genres, including Cuban bolero and son, Puerto Rican &quot;jíbaro&quot; music, Mexican corrido and ranchera, Colombian &quot;vals campesino&quot; and pasillo, and Dominican merengue. A typical bachata group features five instruments: the requinto (lead guitar), segunda (rhythm guitar), bass, bongos, and güira. Over time, the instrumentation has evolved, reflecting musicians&#x27; personal styles and the genre&#x27;s development. Some have incorporated electric guitars, piano, saxophones, and additional percussion instruments like timbales. In the 1970s and 1980s, bachata was dismissed by the Dominican elites due to its association with rural, working-class communities, its use of sexual innuendo, and the informal musical training of many performers. However, the release of Juan Luis Guerra&#x27;s &quot;Bachata Rosa&quot; album in the early 1990s propelled bachata into the mainstream, eventually surpassing merengue in both popularity and album sales. Despite this, bachata flourished and has now gained worldwide acceptance. One of the most popular bands making bachata music was the former band Aventura.

Palo is an Afro-Dominican sacred music that can be found throughout the island. The drum and human voice are the principal instruments. Palo is played at religious ceremonies - usually coinciding with feast days for saints - as well as for secular parties and special occasions. Its roots are in the Congo region of central-west Africa, but it is mixed with European influences in the melodies. Palos are related to Dominican folk Catholicism, which includes a pantheon of deities/saints (primarily known as &quot;misterios&quot;) much like those found in the African derived syncretic religious traditions of Cuba, Brazil, Haiti, and elsewhere. Palos are usually associated with the lower class, black and mixed populations.

Salsa music has had a great deal of popularity in the country. During the late 1960s Dominican native Johnny Pacheco, creator of the famed Fania All Stars, played a significant role in the music&#x27;s development and popularization, and is also credited for coining the term &quot;Salsa&quot; to denote the genre.

Dominican rock is also popular among younger and not so younger crowds of the Dominican Republic. Dominican rock is influenced by British and American rock, but also has its own sense of unique style. The rock scene in the Dominican Republic has been very vibrant in recent years, spanning genres of rock such as pop rock, reggae/rock, and punk. There are also several underground metal concerts occurring occasionally mainly in the cities of Santo Domingo and Santiago, where teenagers and young adults usually not satisfied with the other genres express themselves. Luis Días, known as &quot;El Terror,&quot; is widely regarded as the father of this genre. A prolific musician and composer, Días&#x27; influence extends far beyond rock, leaving a lasting impact across multiple musical styles.

== Cuisine ==
Dominican Republic cuisine is predominantly made up of a combination of Spanish, indigenous Taíno, and African influences. Many Middle-Eastern dishes have been adopted into Dominican cuisine, such as the &quot;Quipe&quot; that comes from the Lebanese kibbeh. Dominican cuisine resembles that of other countries in Latin America, those of the nearby islands of Puerto Rico and Cuba, most of all, though the dish names differ sometimes.

A traditional breakfast would consist of mangú, sauteed onions, fried eggs, fried salami, fried cheese and sometimes avocado. This is called &quot;Los Tres Golpes&quot; or &quot;The Three Hits&quot;. As in Spain, the largest, most important meal of the day is lunch. Its most typical form, nicknamed La Bandera (&quot;The Flag&quot;), consists of rice, red beans and meat (beef, chicken, pork, or fish), sometimes accompanied by a side of salad.

Meals tend to favor meats and starches over dairy products and vegetables. Many dishes are made with &quot;sofrito&quot;, which is a mix of local herbs used as a wet rub for meats and sautéed to bring out all of a dish&#x27;s flavors. Throughout the south-central coast, bulgur, or whole wheat, is a main ingredient in &quot;quipes&quot; or &quot;tipili&quot; (bulgur salad).

Other favorite Dominican foods are &quot;chicharrón&quot;, &quot;yuca&quot;, &quot;casabe&quot;, &quot;pastelitos&quot; (empanadas), &quot;batata&quot;, yam, &quot;chaca&quot; (also called &quot;maiz caqueao/casqueado&quot;, &quot;maiz con dulce&quot; and &quot;maiz con leche&quot;), &quot;chimichurris&quot;, &quot;tostones&quot;. Some treats Dominicans enjoy are &quot;arroz con leche&quot; (or &quot;arroz con dulce&quot;), &quot;bizcocho dominicano&quot; (lit. Dominican cake), &quot;habichuelas con dulce&quot;, flan, &quot;frío frío&quot; (snow cones), dulce de leche, and &quot;caña&quot; (sugarcane). The beverages Dominicans enjoy include &quot;Morir Soñando&quot;, rum, beer, &quot;Mama Juana&quot;, &quot;batida&quot; (smoothie), jugos naturales (freshly squeezed fruit juices), &quot;mabí&quot;, and coffee.

== Sports ==

Baseball is by far the most popular sport in the Dominican Republic. The country has a baseball league of six teams. The Milwaukee Brewers have a summer league here called the baseball academy. The baseball season usually begins during October and ends in January. After the United States, the Dominican Republic has the second-highest number of Major League Baseball (MLB) players. Ozzie Virgil, Sr. became the first Dominican-born player in the MLB on September 23, 1956. Juan Marichal is the first Dominican-born player in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

The three highest paid baseball players of all time Alex Rodriguez, Albert Pujols, and Robinson Canó are of Dominican descent. Other notable baseball players from the Dominican Republic are: Julián Javier, Pedro Martínez, Francisco Liriano, Manny Ramírez, José Bautista, Hanley Ramírez, David Ortiz, Ubaldo Jiménez, José Reyes, Alcides Escobar, Plácido Polanco and Sammy Sosa. Felipe Alou has also enjoyed success as a manager, and Omar Minaya as a general manager. In 2013, the Dominican team went undefeated en route to winning the World Baseball Classic.

In boxing, the Dominican Republic has produced scores of world-class fighters and several world champions. Basketball also enjoys a relatively high level of popularity. Al Horford, Felipe Lopez, and Francisco Garcia are among the Dominican-born players currently or formerly in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Olympic gold medalist and world champion hurdler Félix Sánchez hails from the Dominican Republic, as does NFL defensive end Luis Castillo.

Other important sports include, Volleyball, which was introduced in 1916 by US Marines, is controlled by the Dominican Volleyball Federation. Other sports include taekwondo, in which Gabriel Mercedes is an Olympic silver medalist, and judo.

== Architecture ==
The architecture in the Dominican Republic represents a complex blend of diverse cultures. The deep influence of the European colonists is the most evident throughout the country. Characterized by ornate designs and baroque structures, the style can best be seen in the capital city of Santo Domingo, which is home to the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in all of the Americas, located in the city&#x27;s Colonial Zone, an area declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The designs carry over into the villas and buildings throughout the country. It can also be observed on buildings that contain stucco exteriors, arched doors and windows, and red tiled roofs.
The indigenous peoples of the Dominican Republic have also had a significant influence on the architecture of the country. The Taino people relied heavily on the mahogany and guano (dried palm tree leaf) to put together crafts, artwork, furniture, and houses. Utilizing mud, thatched roofs, and mahogany trees give buildings and the furniture inside a natural look, seamlessly blending in with the island&#x27;s surroundings.

Lately, with the rise in tourism and increasing popularity as a Caribbean vacation destination, architects in the Dominican Republic have now began to incorporate cutting-edge designs that emphasized luxury. In many ways an architectural playground, villas and hotels implemented new styles, while still offering new takes on the old.
This new style, though diverse, is characterized by simplified, angular corners, and large windows that blend outdoor and indoor spaces. As with the culture as a whole, contemporary architects embrace the Dominican Republic&#x27;s rich history and various cultures to create something new. Surveying modern villas, one can find any combination of the three major styles: a villa may contain angular, modernist building construction, Spanish Colonial-style arched windows, and a traditional Taino hammock in the bedroom balcony.
== Visual arts ==
Dominican art is perhaps most commonly associated with the bright, vibrant colors and images that are sold in every tourist gift shop across the country. However, the country has a long history of fine art that goes back to the middle of the 1800s when the country became independent and the beginnings of a national art scene emerged.

Historically, the painting of this time were centered around images connected to national independence, historical scenes, portraits but also landscapes and images of still life. Styles of painting ranged between neoclassicism and romanticism. Between 1920 and 1940 the art scene was influenced by styles of realism and impressionism. Dominican artists were focused on breaking from previous, academic styles in order to develop more independent and individual styles. The artists of the times were Celeste Woss y Gil (1890–1985), Jaime Colson (1901–1975), Yoryi O. Morel (1906–1979) and Darío Suro (1917–1997).

The 1940s represent an important period in Dominican art. President Rafael Leónidas Trujillo provided asylum for Spanish Civil War refugees and a group of Europeans (including famous artists) subsequently arrived to the DR. They became an inspiration to young Dominican artists who were given a more international perspective on art. The art school Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes was founded as the first official center for teaching art. The country went through a renaissance heavily inspired by the trends happening in Europe.

Between 1950 and 1970 Dominican art expressed the social and political conditions of the time. A need for a renewal of the image language emerged and, as a result, paintings were created in non-figurative, abstract, geometric and cubistic styles. The most notable artists included Paul Giudicelli (1921–1965), Clara Ledesma (1924–1999), Gilberto Hernandez Ortega (1924–1979), Gaspar Mario Cruz (1925–2006), Luichy M. Richiez (1928–2000), Eligio Pichardo (1929–1984), Domingo Liz (b. 1931), Silvano Lora (1934–2003), Cándido Bidó (1936–2011) and José Ramírez Conde (1940–1987).

During the 1970s and 1980s artists were experimenting again with new styles, forms, concepts and themes. Artists such as Ada Balcácer (b. 1930), Fernando Peña Defilló (b. 1928) and Ramón Oviedo (b. 1927) count as the most influential of the decade.

== Cinema ==
Dominican cinema is an emerging film industry, being one of the first countries in Latin America where the Lumière brothers first brought the Curiel theater in San Felipe de Puerto Plata at the beginning of the century in the year 1900, with the industry&#x27;s beginnings dating back to 1915 in which the first film is produced in Dominican territory.

The Dominican Film Market is officially the first film market in the history of the Caribbean Region, DFM was created and produced by filmmakers Roddy Pérez and Nurgul Shayakhmetova, executives of Audiovisual Dominicana. In its first edition, DFM had the support of important international brands such as Panasonic, Nikon and Blackmagic Design, as well as the co-sponsorship of the Directorate General of Cinema DGCINE, the Center for Export and Investment of the Dominican Republic CEI-RD and the Ministry of Tourism of the Dominican Republic.

== Fashion ==

In only seven years, the Dominican Republic&#x27;s fashion week has become the most important event of its kind in all of the Caribbean and one of the fastest growing fashion events in the entire Latin American fashion world. The country boasts one of the ten most important design schools in the region, La Escuela de Diseño de Altos de Chavón, which is making the country a key player in the world of fashion and design.

World-famous fashion designer Oscar de la Renta was born in the Dominican Republic in 1932 and became a US citizen in 1971. He studied under the leading Spaniard designer Cristóbal Balenciaga and then worked with the house of Lanvin in Paris. Then by 1963, de la Renta had designs carrying his own label. After establishing himself in the US, de la Renta opened boutiques across the country. His work blends French and Spaniard fashion with American styles.

Although he settled in New York, de la Renta also marketed his work in Latin America where it became very popular. He remained active in his native Dominican Republic, where his charitable activities and personal achievements earned him the Juan Pablo Duarte Order of Merit and the Order of Cristóbal Colón.

Fashion designer Jenny Polanco was known for women&#x27;s clothing and handbags that incorporated Dominican and Caribbean influences into her designs.

== Festivals ==

Carnival celebrations are held in the Dominican Republic each February with parades, street dancing, food festivals, and music. Festivities also take place in the week leading up to Easter Sunday. Parades, beauty pageants, and different festivals in each town throughout the country fill the week. In June the country celebrates Espíritu Santo to honor the island&#x27;s multi-ethnic heritage with nationwide festivals featuring traditional music.

Concerts, dance troupes, arts and crafts booths, and chefs also celebrate Dominican heritage with an annual cultural festival in Puerto Plata each June. Fiesta Patria de la Restauración, or Restoration Day, celebrates the Dominican Republic&#x27;s day of independence from Spain, which occurred in 1863. Nationwide events include parades, music festivals, street festivals, and food festivals.

Three days each June are set aside for the Latin Music Festival in Santo Domingo. Both local and international Latin musicians and bands take the stage. During the last week of July and first week of August Santo Domingo hosts some of the world&#x27;s top merengue bands at the Festival del Merengue. Other events during the two-week-long party include and food festival and an arts and crafts festival.

The merengue festival takes place in July in both Santo Domingo and Puerto Plata. This week-long bacchanal raises the &quot;merengue&quot; and the costumes worn by the dancers to an art form. The dancers dance in the street and on open stages and compete for an array of honors that recognize originality, fluidity, and beauty of the choreography. Posters that are designed to advertise the festival compete for originality and beauty. The crowds who come to watch the dancing and the parades that take place in the evening also dance.

October&#x27;s Puerto Plata Festival brings musicians from around the country together to perform live music in a variety of genres. Blues, jazz, folk, salsa, and merengue are the most common. Another musical event takes place in October during Columbus Day Weekend: the Dominican Republic Jazz Festival. Concerts are held in Puerto Plata, Sosua, and Cabarete, and feature some of the country&#x27;s top jazz musicians and bands.

Other festivals include the Festivales del Santo Cristo de Bayaguana on New Year&#x27;s Day. Events leading up to Mass include a parade, music, and dance. Each January the Dominican Republic honors Juan Pablo Duarte with gun salutes in Santo Domingo and numerous carnivals throughout the country. Duarte is celebrated as the man who gained independence from Haiti for the Dominican Republic. The premier culinary event in all of the Caribbean is Taste SD, which takes place in October of each year.

During the event, hundreds of restaurants, food vendors, chefs, and others on the culinary scene host a series of presentations, tastings, and more. The event stretches out over several days and venues and is known to attract several thousand guests. The main event, unveiled in 2012, is the Culinary Cup of the Americas in which chefs participate in several cooking and baking events hoping to win the top prize. Another event is the Dominican Republic International Film Festival. During four days each December, independent films, shorts, and documentaries are screened.
