<text>The Muroidea are a large superfamily of rodents, including mice, rats, voles, hamsters, lemmings, gerbils, and many other relatives. Although the Muroidea originated in Eurasia, they occupy a vast variety of habitats on every continent except Antarctica. Some authorities have placed all members of this group into a single family, Muridae, due to difficulties in determining how the subfamilies are related to one another. Many of the families within the Muroidea superfamily have more variations between the families than between the different clades. A possible explanation for the variations in rodents is because of the location of these rodents; these changes could have been due to radiation or the overall environment they migrated to or originated in. The following taxonomy is based on recent well-supported molecular phylogenies.

The muroids are classified in six families, 19 subfamilies, around 280 genera, and at least 1,750 species.

==Taxonomy==
*Family Platacanthomyidae (spiny dormouse and pygmy dormice)
*Family Spalacidae (fossorial muroids)
**Subfamily Myospalacinae (zokors)
**Subfamily Rhizomyinae (bamboo rats and root rats)
**Subfamily Spalacinae (blind mole rats)
*Clade Eumuroida – typical muroids
**Family Calomyscidae
***Subfamily Calomyscinae (mouse-like hamsters)
**Family Nesomyidae
***Subfamily Cricetomyinae (pouched rats and mice)
***Subfamily Dendromurinae (African climbing mice, gerbil mice, fat mice and forest mice)
***Subfamily Mystromyinae (white-tailed rat)
***Subfamily Nesomyinae (Malagasy rats and mice)
***Subfamily Petromyscinae (rock mice and the climbing swamp mouse)
**Family Cricetidae
***Subfamily Arvicolinae (voles, lemmings and muskrat)
***Subfamily Cricetinae (true hamsters)
***Subfamily Neotominae (North American rats and mice)
***Subfamily Sigmodontinae (New World rats and mice)
***Subfamily Tylomyinae (vesper rats and climbing rats)
**Family Muridae
***Subfamily Deomyinae (spiny mice, brush furred mice, link rat)
***Subfamily Gerbillinae (gerbils, jirds and sand rats)
***Subfamily Leimacomyinae (Togo Mouse)
***Subfamily Lophiomyinae (crested rat)
***Subfamily Murinae (Old World rats and mice including vlei rats)

==Phylogeny==
Five main clades are recognized by Jansa &amp; Weksler (2004).

*Family Spalacidae: Spalacinae, Myospalacinae, and Rhizomyinae (fossorial species of the Old World)
*Family Calomyscidae: Calomyscinae (Asia)
*Family Nesomyidae: Petromyscinae, Mystromyinae, Cricetomyinae, Nesomyinae, and core dendromurines (Africa and Madagascar)
*Family Muridae: Murinae, Otomyinae, Gerbillinae, Acomyinae, and Lophiomyinae (Old World)
*Family Cricetidae: Sigmodontinae, Arvicolinae, and Cricetinae (New World)

Together, Muroidea and its sister group Dipodoidea form the suborder Myomorpha.

The following phylogeny of more than 70 Muroidea genera, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of the Interphotoreceptor Retinoid Binding Protein (IRBP) gene, is from Jansa &amp; Weksler (2004: 264). Although Platacanthomyidae was not analyzed by Jansa &amp; Weksler (2004), a study by Fabre et al. 2012 suggests that it is the most basal lineage of Muroidea.

<doc id="495264" wikidata="Q1633198" url="?curid=495264" title="1996 Spanish general election">
<text>The 1996 Spanish general election was held on Sunday, 3 March 1996, to elect the 6th of the Kingdom of Spain. All 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies were up for election, as well as 208 of 257 seats in the Senate.

Ever since forming a minority government after its victory in the 1993 election, the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) had been rocked by the unveiling of a string of corruption scandals, including the party&#x27;s illegal financing, misuse of public funds to pay for undeclared bonuses to party officials and allegations of state terrorism (GAL. The 1996 election was triggered following the withdrawal of parliamentary support from Convergence and Union (CiU) to the Socialist minority government of Felipe González in mid 1995.

The election resulted in the first PSOE defeat in a general election since 1979, but predictions of a landslide of the opposition José María Aznar&#x27;s People&#x27;s Party (PP) failed to materialize. The PP had been widely expected to make gains after resounding wins in the 1994 European Parliament election and 1995 local and regional elections, with polls suggesting Aznar winning an outright overall majority or coming short of it by few seats would be the most likely scenario. Instead, the election turned into the closest result between the two major parties in the Spanish democratic period to date; a PSOE comeback, fueled by a strong 77.4% voter turnout, the highest scored ever since, left the PP leading by just 1.2 percentage points and 290,000 votes, falling 20 seats short of an absolute majority. Julio Anguita&#x27;s United Left (IU) also failed to meet expectations, despite scoring their best overall result in a general election since the Communist Party of Spain (PCE)&#x27;s results in 1979.

At 156 seats, this would be the worst performance for a winning party in the democratic period until the PP&#x27;s result in the 2015 election. As a consequence of the election result, Aznar was forced to tone down his attacks to Catalan and Basque nationalists in order to garner their support for his investiture. After two months of negotiations, agreements were reached with CiU, the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) and Canarian Coalition (CC), enabling for José María Aznar to become prime minister of a centre-right minority cabinet, marking the end of years of Socialist government.

==Overview==
===Electoral system===
The Spanish were envisaged as an imperfect bicameral system. The Congress of Deputies had greater legislative power than the Senate, having the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a prime minister and to override Senate vetoes by an absolute majority of votes. Nonetheless, the Senate possessed a few exclusive (yet limited in number) functions—such as its role in constitutional amendment—which were not subject to the Congress&#x27; override. Voting for the was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over 18 years of age and in full enjoyment of their political rights.

For the Congress of Deputies, 348 seats were elected using the D&#x27;Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with an electoral threshold of three percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each constituency. Seats were allocated to constituencies, corresponding to the provinces of Spain, with each being allocated an initial minimum of two seats and the remaining 248 being distributed in proportion to their populations. Ceuta and Melilla were allocated the two remaining seats, which were elected using plurality voting. The use of the electoral method resulted in an effective threshold based on the district magnitude and the distribution of votes among candidacies.

As a result of the aforementioned allocation, each Congress multi-member constituency was entitled the following seats:

For the Senate, 208 seats were elected using an open list partial block voting system, with electors voting for individual candidates instead of parties. In constituencies electing four seats, electors could vote for up to three candidates; in those with two or three seats, for up to two candidates; and for one candidate in single-member districts. Each of the 47 peninsular provinces was allocated four seats, whereas for insular provinces, such as the Balearic and Canary Islands, districts were the islands themselves, with the larger—Majorca, Gran Canaria and Tenerife—being allocated three seats each, and the smaller—Menorca, Ibiza–Formentera, Fuerteventura, La Gomera, El Hierro, Lanzarote and La Palma—one each. Ceuta and Melilla elected two seats each. Additionally, autonomous communities could appoint at least one senator each and were entitled to one additional senator per each million inhabitants.

The law did not provide for by-elections to fill vacated seats; instead, any vacancies that occurred after the proclamation of candidates and into the legislature&#x27;s term were to be covered by the successive candidates in the list and, when needed, by the designated substitutes, of which the list was required to include three.

===Election date===
The term of each chamber of the —the Congress and the Senate—expired four years from the date of their previous election, unless they were dissolved earlier. The election decree was required to be issued no later than the twenty-fifth day prior to the date of expiry of parliament and published on the following day in the Official State Gazette (BOE), with election day taking place on the fifty-fourth day from publication. The previous election was held on 6 June 1993, which meant that the legislature&#x27;s term would expire on 6 June 1997. The election decree was required to be published in the BOE no later than 13 May 1997, with the election taking place on the fifty-fourth day from publication, setting the latest possible election date for the on Sunday, 6 July 1997.

The prime minister had the prerogative to propose the monarch to dissolve both chambers at any given time—either jointly or separately—and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence was in process, no state of emergency was in force and that dissolution did not occur before one year had elapsed since the previous one. Additionally, both chambers were to be dissolved and a new election called if an investiture process failed to elect a prime minister within a two-month period from the first ballot. Barred this exception, there was no constitutional requirement for simultaneous elections to the Congress and the Senate. Still, as of 2025 there has been no precedent of separate elections taking place under the 1978 Constitution.

After Convergence and Union (CiU) withdrew their confidence and supply support to the PSOE-led government in June 1995, materializing in the 1996 General State Budget being voted down in October, Prime Minister Felipe González was forced to trigger an early dissolution of the and a snap election to be arranged for early 1996, fifteen months ahead of schedule.

The were officially dissolved on 9 January 1996 after the publication of the dissolution decree in the BOE, setting the election date for 3 March and scheduling for both chambers to reconvene on 27 March.

==Background==

===Economy===
The legislature was marked by the international economic crisis of 1992-1993. While the economic situation in Spain since 1985 (coinciding with the accession of Spain into the European Communities) was very favorable and the evolutionary profile of per capita GDP was resembling that of the EU countries, from 1989 the GDP started to decrease markedly and the economy entered a cycle of recession. The five-year period 1985-1989 was characterized by a phase of expansive growth and massive inflow of foreign capital, attracted by high interest rates. Post-1989, however, saw unfavorable economic indicators, and recession and global economic crisis deeply affected unemployment rates.

From 1994, a remarkable recovery phase began, from a recession of 1.1% of GDP in 1993 to a growth rate of 2%. Although the economic situation was difficult, the unemployment rate began a gradual decline, reaching the end of the legislature in 22% after reaching 24% in 1994. On the other hand, the inflation rate fell to 5.5% between 1994 and 1996, public debt stood at 68% and the deficit at 7.1%.

===Corruption scandals===
The 1993–96 legislature was marked by the uncovering of numerous corruption scandals involving the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party. The eruption of corruption scandals had not been uncommon since the early 1990s, but was in this period when those seemed to affect directly to the incumbent PSOE leadership. These scandals would plague González&#x27;s government throughout Felipe González&#x27;s fourth tenure as Prime Minister of Spain.

;Roldán scandal
On 23 November 1993, Spanish daily &quot;Diario 16&quot; unveiled that Civil Guard Chief Director Luis Roldán had amassed a large patrimony, worth 400 million Pta and a large real estate assets, since assuming office in 1986, which contrasted with his net annual income of 400,000 Pta. Roldán then denounces a media campaign against him and defends the money is of legal origin, but proves unable to show evidence supporting his claims. The accusations lead to his dismissal by the government on 3 December. On 9 March 1994, &quot;El Mundo&quot; reveals that officers from the Ministry of the Interior had used money from the &quot;fondos reservados&quot; (Spanish for &quot;reserved funds&quot;), public funds destined to finance the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking and not subject to publicity, justification or external oversight, to make bonus payments to high-ranking officers from the Ministry; Roldán name appeared among those accused of having received such payments. In April, &quot;Diario 16&quot; and &quot;El Mundo&quot; revealed that former President of Navarre Gabriel Urralburu had collected millionary commissions from construction companies in the awarding of public works during his government, with Roldán having also benefitted from it. Evidence now pointed to Roldán having used his office to amass a fortune through fraudulent means, which led to Roldán fleeing the country and in incumbent Interior Minister Antoni Asunción, responsible for monitoring Roldán, resigning as a consequence.

During his time missing, Roldán sent letters admitting the illegalities he had done and accusing other Interior Ministry high-ranking members of also having benefited from the reserved funds and warning that he was willing to &quot;pull the rug out&quot;. In a handwritten letter sent to González himself and revealed by &quot;El Mundo&quot; daily on 17 June 1994, Roldán acknowledged having received a monthly payment of 10 million Pta from Rafael Vera, State Security Director until early 1994. Among those he accused was former Interior Minister José Luis Corcuera (1988–93), but also Prime Minister González, whom he pointed was &quot;aware of everything&quot;. In the end, after ten months on the run, Luis Roldán was arrested on 27 February 1995 in Laos amidst claims that he and the Socialist government had reached an agreement in which Roldán would surrender himself in exchange of him being charged with just two crimes out of the seven attributable to him: bribery and embezzlement. This scandal came to be known as the &quot;Laos papers&quot;, because the initial governmental version of his capture—that it had been done cooperatively with the Laotian government—was disproved by Laotian authorities. The PSOE government refused to recognize the veracity of these claims, but acknowledged that their initial version was &quot;wrong&quot;. Roldán would later be convicted for the crimes of bribery, embezzlement, fraud, forgery and tax evasion.

Concurrently with the Roldán scandal, it is revealed on 5 April 1994 that former Governor of the Bank of Spain, Mariano Rubio, had a secret bank account in Ibercorp worth 130 million Ptas of undeclared money. Ibercorp had been an investment bank which had been intervened by the Bank of Spain in 1992 due to its involvement in obscure financial operations. Already in February 1992, it had been revealed that Rubio—then Governor of the Bank of Spain—and former Economy Minister Miguel Boyer had concealed from the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) that both of them possessed stock shares in Ibercorp and used them to amass a fortune. Rubio had denied the accusations in 1992, which nonetheless cost him his post. However, the new revelations in 1994, which resulted in his criminal prosecution, put Felipe González and former Economy Minister Carlos Solchaga—who had backed Rubio in 1992, believing his claims of innocence, and were also ultimately responsible for his naming to the post—in a delicate political situation. Agriculture Minister Vicente Albero was also forced to resign his office in May 1994 after it was unveiled he had also possessed a secret account with undeclared money related to the scandal.

;GAL case
In 1991, two policemen, José Amedo and Michel Domínguez, had been convicted for participating in the Liberation Antiterrorist Groups (GAL), death squads involved in a &#x27;dirty war&#x27; against ETA in the 1983–87 period and thought to be secretly financed by the Socialist government. Initially thought to be acting independently, they confessed on 16 December 1994 to judge Baltasar Garzón that a number of former police and Interior Ministry officers were also involved in the GAL, showing evidence supporting their claims. Among those were former Interior Minister José Barrionuevo (1982–88), State Security Directors Julián Sancristóbal (1984–86) and Rafael Vera (1986–94), as well as former Secretary-General of the PSOE in Biscay Ricardo García Damborenea and a number of police officers accused of murder and embezzlement of public funds. Throughout early 1995, those accused except for Barrionuevo were arrested and court-questioned, leading to the &#x27;GAL case&#x27; being re-opened by the Spanish National Court on 20 February in order to clarify whether the GAL were financed with money from the reserved funds. Barrionuevo accused Garzón, then instructing the case and who had contested the 1993 general election within the PSOE electoral lists, to be acting motivated by personal revenge against the party after political differences leading to his resignation as deputy in May 1994.

In May to July 1995 some of the defendants accused PM Felipe González of &quot;knowing and allowing such activities&quot;, even pointing out that he could have been the person creating and financing the GAL. By 1996, however, the Spanish Supreme Court concluded that there was not proof of González&#x27;s involvement and that the accusations were based on mere suspicions. Still, former Interior Minister José Barrionuevo and State Security Directors Rafael Vera and Julián Sancristóbal were convicted for the scandal.

==Parties and candidates==
===Eligibility requirements===
Spanish citizens of age and with the legal capacity to vote could run for election, provided that they were not sentenced to imprisonment by a final court&#x27;s decision nor convicted by a judgement, even if not yet final, which imposed a penalty of forfeiture of eligibility or of specific disqualification or suspension from public office under specific offences: rebellion and terrorism when involving crimes against life, physical integrity or freedom of persons. Other general causes of ineligibility were imposed on members of the Spanish royal family; the president and members of the Constitutional Court, the General Council of the Judiciary, the Supreme Court, the Council of State, the Court of Auditors and the Economic and Social Council; the Ombudsman; the State&#x27;s Attorney General; high-ranking members—undersecretaries, secretaries-general, directors-general and chiefs of staff—of Spanish government departments, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, government delegations, the Social Security and other government agencies; heads of diplomatic missions in foreign states or international organizations; judges and public prosecutors in active service; Armed Forces and police corps personnel in active service; members of electoral commissions; the chair of RTVE; the director of the Electoral Register Office; the governor and deputy governor of the Bank of Spain; the chairs of the Official Credit Institute and other official credit institutions; and members of the Nuclear Safety Council; as well as a number of territorial-level officers in the aforementioned government bodies and institutions being barred from running, during their tenure of office, in constituencies within the whole or part of their respective area of jurisdiction. Disqualification provisions for the Cortes Generales extended to any employee of a foreign state and to members of regional governments, as well as the impossibility of running simultaneously as candidate for both the Congress and Senate.

The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of at least one percent of the electorate in the constituencies for which they sought election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates.

===Main competing lists===
Below is a list of the main parties and electoral alliances which contested the election:
The Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE), United Left (IU), The Greens (LV), Nationalist and Ecologist Agreement (ENE) and Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) formed the Ibiza and Formentera in the Senate alliance for the Senate election.

<text>In Christianity, minor orders are ranks of church ministry. In the Catholic Church, the predominating Latin Church formerly distinguished between the major orders—priest (including bishop), deacon and subdeacon—and four minor orders—acolyte, exorcist, lector, and porter (in descending order of seniority). In 1972, the Vatican re-titled the minor orders as &quot;ministries&quot;, with those of lector and acolyte being kept throughout the Latin Church.
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the three minor orders in use are those of subdeacon, reader and chanter.

The rites by which all four minor orders were conferred, but not the actual conferral of the order, are still employed for members of some Catholic religious institutes and societies of apostolic life authorized to observe the 1962 form of the Roman Rite.

Some traditionalist Catholics continue to use minor orders, as do Old Catholics, the Polish National Catholic Church and the Liberal Catholic Church.

==Western Catholicism==

From the beginning of the 3rd century, there is evidence in Western Christianity of the existence of what became the four minor orders (acolytes, exorcists, doorkeepers, and readers), as well as of cantors and &quot;fossores&quot; (tomb diggers). The evidence for readers is probably the earliest. In the West, unlike the East, where imposition of hands was used, the rite of ordination was by the handing over to them of objects seen as instruments of the office.

The Council of Sardica (343) mentions the lectorate alone as obligatory before ordination to the diaconate. The obligation to receive all four minor orders appears to date only from a time when they ceased to indicate exercise of an actual function. Even in the early years of the 20th century, no minimum age, other than that of the &quot;age of reason&quot;, was laid down for receiving minor orders. However, the 1917 Code of Canon Law laid down that nobody was to be given clerical tonsure, which had to be received before minor orders, before beginning the regular course of theological studies. Before the entry into force of that Code, it was an almost universal custom to confer all four minor orders at one time, since the bishop was authorized to dispense from the rule that each order had to be exercised for some time before reception of the next highest order. Today, as indicated in the 1983 Code of Canon Law, anyone who is to be ordained to the diaconate must already have received the ministries of lector and acolyte and exercised them for a suitable period, with an interval of at least six months between becoming an acolyte and becoming a deacon.

The 1917 Code of Canon Law also restricted conferral of tonsure and any order below that of the presbyterate to those who intended to become priests and who were judged likely to be worthy priests. Previously, there were lay cardinals and others, including the famous Franz Liszt, who received minor orders alone. They could even marry and remain clerics, the status of belonging to the clergy being at that time conferred through clerical tonsure, provided that they married only once and that to a virgin; but by the early 20th century a cleric who married was considered to have forfeited his clerical status. Today, a man who receives what were previously called minor orders is not yet a cleric, since today one becomes a cleric only upon ordination to the diaconate, a rule that applies even to members of institutes authorized to observe the 1962 form of the Roman Rite, such as the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter and others under the care of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei, regarding, however, only the incardination of members within the institute or society.

In the early 20th century, Auguste Boudinhon said that, on the grounds that minor orders did not originate with Jesus or the apostles, the view that minor orders and the subdiaconate were sacramental, a view held by several medieval theologians, was no longer held. The slightly earlier G. van Noort said that the view of their sacramentality, which was held by most scholastic theologians, including Thomas Aquinas, was then held only by a few, among whom he mentioned Louis Billot (1846–1931) and Adolphe Tanquerey (1854–1932). In the 1950s, Antonio Piolanti recognized as orders only episcopacy, priesthood (presbyterate) and diaconate, the three whose transmission is reserved to bishops. In speaking of the hierarchical structure of the Church, the Second Vatican Council mentioned only these three orders, not minor orders or subdiaconate.

By Pope Paul VI&#x27;s &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Ministeria quaedam&quot; of 15 August 1972, the term &quot;minor orders&quot; has been replaced by that of &quot;ministries&quot;. Two of what were called minor orders, those of reader and acolyte, are kept throughout the Latin Church, and national episcopal conferences are free to use the term &quot;subdeacon&quot; in place of that of &quot;acolyte&quot;. The motu proprio specified the functions of each of these two ministries. A prescribed interval, as decided by the Holy See and the national episcopal conference, is to be observed between receiving them. Candidates for diaconate and for the priesthood must receive both ministries and exercise them for some time before receiving holy orders.

Conferral of the minor orders or ministries is by the ordinary: either a diocesan bishop or someone who is equivalent in law to a diocesan bishop or, in the case of clerical religious institutes and societies of apostolic life, a major superior. The two ministries that are in use throughout the Latin Church could be conferred even on persons who are not candidates for holy orders.

In the Latin Church, the lay ministries of acolyte and lector, may be entrusted to all suitable faithful, whether male or female, per CIC Canon 230 §2. Additionally there is established the instituted ministry of the Catechist, whether male or female.

==Eastern Christianity==

Eastern Christianity traditionally views the subdeacon as a minor order, unlike the practice of the West which considered it a major order. The other common minor order is reader (lector). The minor order of porter is mentioned historically in some service-books, but no longer is given; all of the rights and responsibilities of each minor order are viewed as contained in the subdiaconate.

The 23 &quot;sui iuris&quot; Eastern Catholic Churches in union with Rome have their traditional minor orders, governed by their own particular law. In all Eastern Catholic Churches, subdeacons are minor clerics, since admission to major orders is by ordination as deacon. The Byzantine tradition allows for several orders of minor clerics. The &quot;sui iuris&quot; Byzantine Catholic Metropolitan Church of Pittsburgh, also called the Byzantine-Ruthenian Church, has the minor orders of candle bearer, cantor, lector and subdeacon, and in English uses the term &quot;ordination&quot; for their cheirothesis. The minor orders of candle bearer and cantor are given before tonsure during ordination to the lectorate.

Eastern Orthodox Churches routinely confer the minor orders of reader and subdeacon, and some jurisdictions also ordain cantors. Ordination to minor orders is performed outside the sanctuary and at any communal worship service, but always outside the context of actual Divine Liturgy. The order of taper-bearer is now used as part of ordination as a lector. The orders of doorkeepers, exorcists, and acolytes are no longer in common use.

<doc id="495269" wikidata="Q1434281" url="?curid=495269" title="2004 Spanish general election">
<text>The 2004 Spanish general election was held on Sunday, 14 March 2004, to elect the 8th of the Kingdom of Spain. All 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies were up for election, as well as 208 of 259 seats in the Senate. Incumbent Prime Minister José María Aznar of the People&#x27;s Party (PP) was retiring from politics and did not stand.

The electoral outcome was heavily influenced by the aftermath of the Madrid train bombings on 11 March, as a result of which all parties suspended their electoral campaigns. For two days following the attacks, the government kept blaming the terrorist organization ETA for the bombings, even in spite of mounting evidence suggesting the involvement of Islamist groups. The government was accused of misinformation, as an Islamist attack would have been perceived as the direct result of Spain&#x27;s involvement in the Iraq War, which had been highly unpopular among the public.

The election result was described by some media as an &quot;unprecedented electoral upset&quot;. The perceived abuse of the PP&#x27;s absolute majority throughout the legislature, with a focus on Spain&#x27;s involvement in Iraq, was said to have helped fuel a wave of discontent against the incumbent ruling party, with the government&#x27;s mismanagement on the bombings serving as the final catalyst for change to happen. At 11 million votes and 42.6%, the opposition Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) increased by 3.1 million its 2000 result, securing 164 seats—a net gain of 39. In contrast, the PP, which opinion polls earlier in the year had predicted would secure a diminished but still commanding victory, lost 35 seats and 7 percentage points, resulting in the worst defeat for a sitting government in Spain up to that point since 1982. The 75.7% turnout was among the highest since the Spanish transition to democracy, with no subsequent general election having exceeded such a figure. The number of votes cast, at 26.1 million votes, remained the highest figure in gross terms for any Spanish general election until the April 2019 election.

The day after the election, Zapatero announced his will to form a minority PSOE government, supported by other parties in a confidence and supply basis. Two minor left-wing parties, Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and United Left (IU), immediately announced their intention to support Zapatero&#x27;s government. On 16 April 2004, Zapatero was elected as new prime minister by an outright majority of the new Congress, with 183 out of 350 members voting for him, being sworn in the next day.

==Overview==
===Electoral system===
The Spanish were envisaged as an imperfect bicameral system. The Congress of Deputies had greater legislative power than the Senate, having the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a prime minister and to override Senate vetoes by an absolute majority of votes. Nonetheless, the Senate possessed a few exclusive (yet limited in number) functions—such as its role in constitutional amendment—which were not subject to the Congress&#x27; override. Voting for the was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over 18 years of age and in full enjoyment of their political rights.

For the Congress of Deputies, 348 seats were elected using the D&#x27;Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with an electoral threshold of three percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each constituency. Seats were allocated to constituencies, corresponding to the provinces of Spain, with each being allocated an initial minimum of two seats and the remaining 248 being distributed in proportion to their populations. Ceuta and Melilla were allocated the two remaining seats, which were elected using plurality voting. The use of the electoral method resulted in an effective threshold based on the district magnitude and the distribution of votes among candidacies.

As a result of the aforementioned allocation, each Congress multi-member constituency was entitled the following seats:

For the Senate, 208 seats were elected using an open list partial block voting system, with electors voting for individual candidates instead of parties. In constituencies electing four seats, electors could vote for up to three candidates; in those with two or three seats, for up to two candidates; and for one candidate in single-member districts. Each of the 47 peninsular provinces was allocated four seats, whereas for insular provinces, such as the Balearic and Canary Islands, districts were the islands themselves, with the larger—Majorca, Gran Canaria and Tenerife—being allocated three seats each, and the smaller—Menorca, Ibiza–Formentera, Fuerteventura, La Gomera, El Hierro, Lanzarote and La Palma—one each. Ceuta and Melilla elected two seats each. Additionally, autonomous communities could appoint at least one senator each and were entitled to one additional senator per each million inhabitants.

The law did not provide for by-elections to fill vacated seats; instead, any vacancies that occurred after the proclamation of candidates and into the legislature&#x27;s term were to be covered by the successive candidates in the list and, when needed, by the designated substitutes, of which the list could include up to ten.

===Election date===
The term of each chamber of the —the Congress and the Senate—expired four years from the date of their previous election, unless they were dissolved earlier. The election decree was required to be issued no later than the twenty-fifth day prior to the date of expiry of parliament and published on the following day in the Official State Gazette (BOE), with election day taking place on the fifty-fourth day from publication. The previous election was held on 12 March 2000, which meant that the legislature&#x27;s term would expire on 12 March 2004. The election decree was required to be published in the BOE no later than 17 February 2004, with the election taking place on the fifty-fourth day from publication, setting the latest possible election date for the on Sunday, 11 April 2004.

The prime minister had the prerogative to propose the monarch to dissolve both chambers at any given time—either jointly or separately—and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence was in process, no state of emergency was in force and that dissolution did not occur before one year had elapsed since the previous one. Additionally, both chambers were to be dissolved and a new election called if an investiture process failed to elect a prime minister within a two-month period from the first ballot. Barred this exception, there was no constitutional requirement for simultaneous elections to the Congress and the Senate. Still, as of 2025 there has been no precedent of separate elections taking place under the 1978 Constitution.

On 9 January 2004, it was announced that the general election would be held in March, with the election date being agreed with Andalusian president Manuel Chaves to make it being held concurrently with the 2004 Andalusian regional election.

The were officially dissolved on 20 January 2004 after the publication of the dissolution decree in the BOE, setting the election date for 14 March and scheduling for both chambers to reconvene on 2 April.

==Parliamentary composition==
The tables below show the composition of the parliamentary groups in both chambers at the time of dissolution.


==Parties and candidates==
===Eligibility requirements===
Spanish citizens of age and with the legal capacity to vote could run for election, provided that they were not sentenced to imprisonment by a final court&#x27;s decision nor convicted by a judgement, even if not yet final, which imposed a penalty of forfeiture of eligibility or of specific disqualification or suspension from public office under specific offences: rebellion, terrorism or other crimes against the state. Other general causes of ineligibility were imposed on members of the Spanish royal family; the president and members of the Constitutional Court, the General Council of the Judiciary, the Supreme Court, the Council of State, the Court of Auditors and the Economic and Social Council; the Ombudsman; the State&#x27;s Attorney General; high-ranking members—undersecretaries, secretaries-general, directors-general and chiefs of staff—of Spanish government departments, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, government delegations, the Social Security and other government agencies; heads of diplomatic missions in foreign states or international organizations; judges and public prosecutors in active service; Armed Forces and police corps personnel in active service; members of electoral commissions; the chair of RTVE; the director of the Electoral Register Office; the governor and deputy governor of the Bank of Spain; the chairs of the Official Credit Institute and other official credit institutions; and members of the Nuclear Safety Council; as well as a number of territorial-level officers in the aforementioned government bodies and institutions being barred from running, during their tenure of office, in constituencies within the whole or part of their respective area of jurisdiction. Disqualification provisions for the Cortes Generales extended to any employee of a foreign state and to members of regional governments, as well as the impossibility of running simultaneously as candidate for both the Congress and Senate.

The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of at least one percent of the electorate in the constituencies for which they sought election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates.

===Main competing lists===
Below is a list of the main parties and electoral alliances which contested the election:

The Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia (PSC), Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and Initiative for Catalonia Greens (ICV) agreed to continue with the Catalan Agreement of Progress alliance for the Senate with the inclusion of United and Alternative Left (EUiA). In the Balearic Islands, PSM–Nationalist Agreement (PSM–EN), United Left of the Balearic Islands (EUIB), The Greens of the Balearic Islands (EVIB) and ERC formed the Progressives for the Balearic Islands alliance. A proposal for an all-left electoral alliance for the Senate in the Valencian Community, comprising the PSOE, United Left of the Valencian Country (EUPV) and the Valencian Nationalist Bloc (BNV) was ultimately discarded.

<text>Nikolay Nikolayevich Semyonov, sometimes Semenov, Semionov or Semenoff (; – 25 September 1986) was a Soviet physicist and chemist. Semyonov was awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on the mechanism of chemical transformation.

==Life and career==
Semyonov was born in Saratov, the son of Yelena Dmitrieva and Nikolai Aleksandrovich Semyonov. He graduated from the department of physics of Petrograd University (1913–1917), where he was a student of Abram Fyodorovich Ioffe. In 1918, he moved to Samara, where he was enlisted into Kolchak&#x27;s White Army during Russian Civil War.

Semyonov published his first research paper in 1916 and became a lecturer at the University of Tomsk in western Siberia.

After graduating from Saint Petersburg State University, he worked as an assistant and lecturer at the Tomsk and Tomsk University Institute of Technology, where he published his first research paper in 1916. He returned to western Siberia, Petrograd and took charge of the electron phenomena laboratory of the Petrograd Physico-Technical Institute in 1920. He also became the vice-director of the institute. In 1921, he married philologist Maria Boreishe-Liverovsky (student of Zhirmunsky). She died two years later. On September 15, 1924, Nikolay married Maria&#x27;s niece, Natalia Nikolayevna Burtseva. They had two children, son Yuri and daughter Lyudmila.

During that difficult time, Semyonov, together with Pyotr Kapitsa, discovered a way to measure the magnetic field of an atomic nucleus (1922). Later the experimental setup was improved by Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach and became known as Stern–Gerlach experiment.

In 1925, Semyonov, together with Yakov Frenkel, studied kinetics of condensation and adsorption of vapors. In 1927, he studied ionisation in gases and published an important book, &quot;Chemistry of the Electron&quot;. In 1928, he, together with Vladimir Fock, created a theory of thermal disruptive discharge of dielectrics.

In 1927, Semyonov studied the ionization of gases, the chemistry of the electron. In 1928, he created the theory of the broken discharge of dielectrics with Vladimir Fock.

He lectured at the Petrograd Polytechnical Institute and was appointed Professor in 1928. In 1931, he organized the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the USSR Academy of Sciences (which moved to Chernogolovka in 1943) and became its first director. In 1932, he became a full member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.

The ideas of Semyonov have been applied in the science of reaction and production of polymerization reactions. His ideas are also applied in catalysis studies in biological systems.

Semyonov married Natalya Nikolayevna Semyonov and together they both have a son and a daughter. Semyonov died on September 25, 1986, in Moscow, and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery.

==Significant works==
Semyonov&#x27;s outstanding work on the mechanism of chemical transformation includes an exhaustive analysis of the application of the chain theory to varied reactions (1934–1954) and, more significantly, to combustion processes. He proposed a theory of degenerate branching, which led to a better understanding of the phenomena associated with the induction periods of oxidation processes. He spent most of his career focusing and developing the field of chemical chain reactions.

Semyonov wrote two important books outlining his work. &quot;Chemical Kinetics and Chain Reactions&quot; was published in 1934, with an English edition in 1935. It was the first book in the U.S.S.R. to develop a detailed theory of unbranched and branched chain reactions in chemistry. &quot;Some Problems of Chemical Kinetics and Reactivity&quot;, first published in 1954, was revised in 1958; there are also English, American, German, and Chinese editions. He is the only Soviet/Russian Chemistry Nobel Laureate, who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (together with Sir Cyril N. Hinshelwood) for his work in 1956.

Semyonov had long been a supporter of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union. After the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists accused the Soviet Union of heavy scientific censorship in 1953, he coauthored the Soviet response which denied all accusations. He is also noted as being the most famous signatory to a 1971 public letter from Soviet scientists to United States president Richard Nixon, on displeasure in the murder trial of Angela Davis.

Semyonov trained Russian organometallic chemist Alexander Shilov, who discovered platinum catalyzed C-H activation.

<text>The Pirates of Dark Water is an American fantasy animated television series created by David Kirschner and produced by Hanna-Barbera. The series premiered as a five-part miniseries on Fox Kids early 1991, simply entitled Dark Water. The first season, consisting of 13 episodes including the original five-part miniseries, aired on ABC from September to December 1991. A second season, consisting of just eight episodes, aired in syndication in the United States from 1992 to 1993.

==Premise==
Ren, the son of the dying King Primus of Octopon, sails around the alien world of Mer on a ship called the Wraith, searching for the &quot;Thirteen Treasures of Rule&quot;. The treasures are prophesied to save Octopon and Mer from the threat of Dark Water, an all-consuming black sentient liquid that has taken over the seas. His loyal crew of misfits that help Ren on his journey are the ecomancer Tula, a monkey-bird Niddler, and the treasure-hungry pirate Ioz. Ren&#x27;s opponent in his quest is the pirate Bloth of the warship the &quot;Maelstrom&quot;, who will stop at nothing to get the treasures and control the Dark Water himself.

==Characters==

===Heroes===
*Ren (voiced by George Newbern) – The prince of the once-grand kingdom of Octopon and the main protagonist of the series. Ren was raised by a lighthouse keeper on the outskirts of his homeland, unaware of his destiny and heritage. He wields the broken sword that belonged to his father in its whole form. By the second half of the first season, he freed one-half of the planet from the Dark Water.

*Niddler (voiced by Roddy McDowall in the miniseries, Frank Welker in the TV series) – A monkey-bird who once belonged to Bloth until he escaped by aiding Ren&#x27;s escape from the pirate captain. He hails from the island of Pandawa. Niddler is usually depicted as a little greedy and constantly ravenous for food, his favorite food being minga melons, but he likes Ren and his ability to fly often comes in handy.

*Tula (voiced by Jodi Benson) – She is an ecomancer with the ability to control the elements and biological life, both sentient and non-sentient, as well as a natural affinity towards nature and animals. She is headstrong and often flusters Ioz. Tula is introduced as being a simple barmaid, but she stows aboard Ren and Ioz&#x27;s ship, claiming she &quot;wanted to get away from the drudgery of life on land.&quot; It&#x27;s soon revealed that she&#x27;s a character with many secrets.

*Ioz (voiced first by Héctor Elizondo) – A rogue and pirate, he joins up with Ren initially for the promise of treasure. Throughout the seasons, his character matures and he becomes fond of Ren and his idealism, evolving into a protective brotherly figure to him and often risking his life for Ren and the quest for the Treasures. He continues his attempts at getting rich quickly but is mostly unsuccessful. Ioz also has a younger sister named Solia, who appears in the series. Like Niddler, he originally worked for Bloth, but &quot;it ended ugly&quot; according to him.

*Zoolie (voiced by Dick Gautier) – A jolly, redheaded rogue who runs a gamehouse in Janda-Town. He and Ioz crewed together on Bloth&#x27;s ship the Maelstrom. Though not a main character, he does make recurring appearances by offering advice and assisting Ren and his friends whenever they make port in Janda-Town.

*Teron (voiced by Dan O&#x27;Herlihy) – He is a supreme ecomancer who sprouts roots from his body to replenish himself from a portable supply of native soil when he is away from his homeland, Andorus. He is first seen in the series as a prisoner on Bloth&#x27;s ship, and Bloth uses his power for evil, in turn exhausting the local environment and its positive life energy. Tula has great respect for him as an ecomancer, and she was sent on a mission to bring him back to Andorus to heal the Dark Water-ravaged island. Teron also helps Tula adjust to her new powers as an ecomancer when they first manifest themselves.

===Villains===
* Bloth (voiced by Brock Peters) – The ox-sized, humanoid pirate captain of the feared pirate ship &quot;Maelstrom&quot; and one of the primary antagonists of the series. Bloth is after the Thirteen Treasures of Rule to control all the Dark Water in the world and in effect Mer itself. He destroyed Primus&#x27;s fleet seventeen years prior to the timeline of the show and captured Primus and his aide Avagon, though the seven captains accompanying Primus were able to escape with the Treasures. Bloth has since been hunting them obsessively and destroying every remnant of the House of Primus just as obsessively, including killing every heir to the throne of Octopon that he could find and ravaging and pillaging the ailing city. He held Primus captive for seventeen years before the old man escaped back to Octopon and to Ren. Upon learning that Primus has a son, he transferred his fanatical hatred of Primus to Ren. Bloth began to hunt the boy across the twenty seas of Mer in order to capture the Treasures and to kill Ren and the house of Primus. In the second half of the first season, he makes an uncertain and untrusting alliance with Morpho, a major agent of the Dark Dweller.
** Mantus (voiced by Peter Cullen) – Bloth&#x27;s second-in-command. He offers his cool and calculating personality as a battle strategist for Bloth&#x27;s fleet.
** Konk (voiced by Tim Curry) – A short, fat pirate who works for Bloth. He lost his leg thanks to a close encounter with his master&#x27;s ferocious pet the Constrictus. For a long time, Konk was the only one to ever survive being thrown to the monster. Although not particularly smart, Konk possesses more bluster than most of Bloth&#x27;s crew and is always trying to win Bloth&#x27;s praise.
** The Lugg Brothers (voiced by Earl Boen and Frank Welker) – Two huge, dimwitted siblings who are members of Bloth&#x27;s crew. They try to assist Konk, but their stupidity makes them more of a hindrance than anything. They only make appearances as main characters in the first five episodes of the show.
* The Dark Dweller (voiced by Frank Welker) – One of the primary antagonists of the series. The Dark Dweller is a powerful, evil creature that created the Dark Water. He had the Treasures originally scattered because their power is the only thing capable of opposing him and his evil master plan to swallow Mer in Dark Water.
** Morpho (voiced by Neil Ross) – A servant of the Dark Dweller and the leader of his worshippers, the Dark Disciples. He joins forces with Bloth and serves as the above-water liaison for the Dark Dweller, so that they can aid each other in their mutual goal of killing Ren and his friends, though they have two very different goals for the Compass and Treasures. He was an alchemist who was doing research on the Dark Water when the Dark Dweller captured him and transformed him so that he was no longer fully human, making him into an eternal servant. He possesses a tentacle in place of one arm, and half his body has been reshaped to resemble an amalgam of deep-sea creatures. He refers to himself as a creature of two worlds, Ren&#x27;s and the Dark Dweller&#x27;s.
* Joat (voiced by Andre Stojka) – A pirate and the previous owner of the Wraith. His ship was stolen by Ioz. He uses his metal claw in place of his left hand mercilessly in battle. Originally slated to have a larger role in the series, his only major appearance was in &quot;The Soul Stealer.&quot;

==Ships==
* &quot;The Wraith&quot; – A swift, beautiful ship, originally owned by the pirate Joat, that Ioz steals for Ren from the Janda-Town docks. It has a unique, dynamic mainsail that rotates to slow the ship or act as a parachute. This mainsail can also be detached to become a large glider. The Series Bible written during the initial production of the show says that the &quot;Wraith&quot; was built with lumber from mystical trees on a remote island and that the lumber still retains the life-force of those trees, making the ship seem as if it is haunted or has a mind of its own.
* &quot;The Maelstrom&quot; – Bloth&#x27;s massive and deadly warship. It is built from the bleached carcasses of leviathans, and resembles a gargantuan floating fossil. Below the main deck sits a labyrinth of passageways, sewer lines, holding cells, and slaves&#x27; quarters. The dreaded Constrictus lives in the bowels of this death vessel.

==About Mer==
Mer is a planet very different from Earth with a variety of its own creatures with varying degrees of intelligence, such as the monkey-bird and the leviathans. The world has twenty seas, and most of the crew&#x27;s stops are made at islands. Parts of Mer are continually in flux, like a river of spiked rocks that rises out of the ocean in the first episode and appears to defy physics (none of the characters are bewildered by the spectacle aside from its danger), but whether this is the Dark Water&#x27;s doing or just the nature of the geologically hyperactive planet is unknown.

Octopon was once the greatest city on Mer, referred to as &quot;the jewel in the crown of Mer&quot; by Ioz in episode 14, though lying in ruins until Ren collects the first seven treasures and it is partially restored. Octopon seems to have been centuries ahead of the current technological state of Mer, although it is probable that civilization is continually in decline due to the Dark Water oozing from the planet&#x27;s core.

==Episodes==

=== Series overview ===
=== Miniseries (1991) ===
===Season 1 (1991)===
ABC reaired the miniseries from September 14, to October 12, 1991, before premiering new episodes.

===Season 2 (1992–93)===
==Production==
David Kirschner, the president and chief executive officer of Hanna-Barbera, created the series based on an idea he had when he was a child, inspired by &quot;the works of Robert Louis Stevenson and the pictures of Howard Pyle and N.C. Wyeth&quot;. The original five-episode miniseries was &quot;the most expensive animated project&quot; Hanna-Barbera had taken on up to that time, with each half-hour episode costing US$500,000. Each half-hour episode consisted of 12,000 cels, double the number &quot;of a typical Saturday morning cartoon series&quot;.

===Overseas animation studios===
* Fil-Cartoons, Inc., Manila, Philippines
* Tama Production Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan (episodes 1–2, 5)
* Wang Film Productions Co., Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan (episode 3–4)
* Mr. Big Cartoons, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia (episode 3–4)

===Other studios===
* Madhouse, Inc., Tokyo, Japan
* Big Star Enterprise, Inc., Seoul, South Korea
* Kennedy Cartoons
** Toronto, Ontario, Canada
** Manila, Philippines

==Broadcast and release==
The show first premiered on Fox Kids in early 1991 as a five-part mini-series titled &quot;Dark Water&quot;. Following a number of animation tweaks and other changes by Hanna-Barbera, those episodes were rebroadcast later in 1991 as the first five episodes of the regular series. Notably, the original mini-series featured the voice of Roddy McDowall as Niddler, whereas in the revised version, the character was voiced by Frank Welker.

The first season, consisting of 13 episodes, aired on ABC. The second season, consisting of the last 8 episodes, aired in first-run syndication as part of &quot;The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera&quot;. The series was never completed, ending abruptly after 21 episodes with only eight of the thirteen treasures collected.

===Home media===
The complete series was released on DVD on August 31, 2010.

==Reception==
&quot;The Pirates of Dark Water&quot; was reviewed favorably in &quot;The Scarecrow Video Movie Guide&quot;, which contrasted it with other cartoons from the same period, noting that it was &quot;...serious, well-written, and had a certain amount of craft in its character animation and watercolor backgrounds.&quot; Collider called it one of the 14 greatest kids cartoons of the 1990s as well as a property worthy of resurrection. Screen Rant said the show &quot;has a robust cult following to this day and was one of the best adventure shows of its era, with surprisingly strong writing and a beautifully designed world.&quot;

==In other media==

===Comics===
In November 1991, Marvel Comics produced a comic book series based on the show. Originally intended as a six-part limited series, it was extended to nine issues to include a three-part original story. A series of action figures based on the characters from the show was also produced. The toyline consisted of Ren, Niddler, Ioz, Zoolie, Bloth, Konk, Mantus, Joat, and the Wraith.

===Video games===
&quot;Pirates of Dark Water&quot; video games were released for the Super NES and Sega Genesis platforms, both published by Sunsoft. The Super NES version is a side-scrolling beat &#x27;em up, co-developed by Japanese and American staff members, where players can choose to play as Ren, Tula or Ioz and proceed to fight Bloth&#x27;s gang. Up to two players can play simultaneously. Each character has a life-draining Desperation Attack (spinning kick for Ren, ecomancer energy for Tula, and spinning punch for Ioz) and the ability to block – something not common in games of this genre. The Genesis version, developed by Team Iguana (later known as Acclaim Studios Austin), is a side scrolling platform game with role-playing elements. A &quot;Pirates of Dark Water&quot; role-playing game was released in 1994 but had a limited production run.

Niddler was parodied in 1993&#x27;s &quot;Might and Magic V: Darkside of Xeen&quot;, as Nibbler the Monkeydog, who loved Monga Melons.

===Cartoon Network interstitials===
The show was parodied in one of a series of early interstitials on Cartoon Network. These commercials featured a &quot;viewer&#x27;s&quot; question and Cartoon Network&#x27;s comical take on the &quot;answer&quot;. In &quot;Pirates&quot;&#x27; case, it was on the &quot;unaired episodes&quot;. Cartoon Network claimed to have the episodes on tape and promised to air them, instead showing footage of a cat lapping milk, suggesting that someone taped over the only copy of what would have been the nonexistent episodes.

<text>The Malians (, &quot;Malieis&quot;) were a Greek tribe that resided at the mouth of the river Spercheios in Greece. The Malian Gulf is named after them. In the western valley of the Spercheios, their land was adjacent to the Aenianes. Their main town was Trachis. In the town of Anthele, the Malians had an important temple of Demeter; an early centre of the Delphinian Amphictiony. According to Herodotus, the Malian Ephialtes of Trachis betrayed the Spartans and their allies in the Battle of Thermopylae, helping the Persians surround the Greek army. In 426BCE, the Malians asked Sparta for help in their war against the Oetaeans. The Spartans then founded the town Heraclea Trachis in place of Trachis.

In the following decades, the Malians were under the hegemony of Sparta, until they revolted against it in the Corinthian War. In this war, they lost their land south of the Spercheios, Herakleia Trachis was given to the Oitaians, and Lamia became the new capital of the Malians.

Together with the Oitaians and the Ainians, the Malians became members of the Corinthian League, and in 235BCE, the Aetolian League. In 189BCE, they became part of Achaea Phthiotis, and since that time the Malians were regarded as Thessalians.

It was also reported that her meniscus was badly worn out.

===2017===

==Playing style==
Date played with short backswings on both forehand and backhand sides. Date&#x27;s playstyle is representative of those that dominated during her first career in the 1990s using less topspin in favour of a flatter shot. She is considered to possess the most notable &quot;pancake&quot; forehand in the women&#x27;s game, with one of the lowest average spin RPM ever. She relies on her opponent&#x27;s power to hit sharp angles and catch her opponents off-guard.

Since her comeback, Date played the best on grass, and her style was once described as &quot;all stealthy, neat athleticism&quot;.

==Personal life==
Date was born in Kyoto, Japan. Her father is Juichi (died in 2007) and her mother is Masako. She has two siblings: Ryusuke and Junko. Date first played tennis at the age of six.

<text>Alexander Naumovich Frumkin (; 24 October 1895 – 27 May 1976) was a Soviet Russian electrochemist, member of the Russian Academy of Sciences since 1932, founder of the Russian Journal of Electrochemistry &quot;Elektrokhimiya&quot; and receiver of the Hero of Socialist Labor award. The Russian Academy of Sciences&#x27; A.N. Frumkin Institute of Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry is named after him.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Frumkin was born in Kishinev, in the Bessarabia Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Moldova) to a Jewish family; his father was an insurance salesman. His family moved to Odessa, where he received his primary schooling; he continued his education in Strasbourg, and then at the University of Bern. Frumkin&#x27;s first published articles appeared in 1914, when he was only 19; in 1915, he received his first degree, back in Odessa. Two years later, the seminal article &quot;Electrocapillary Phenomena and Electrode Potentials&quot; was published.

Frumkin moved to Moscow in 1922 to work at the Karpov Institute, under A.N. Bakh. In 1930, Frumkin joined the faculty of Moscow University, where in 1933 he founded—and would head until his death—the department of electrochemistry.

Frumkin was married three times, including a brief first marriage to Vera Inber.

===Scientific career===
During the Second World War, Frumkin led a large team of scientists and engineers involved in defense issues. This contribution did not save him from being dismissed in 1949 as the director of the Institute of Physical Chemistry, when he was accused of cosmopolitanism.

Frumkin&#x27;s most fundamental achievement was the fundamental theory of electrode reactions, which describes the influence of the structure of the interface between electrode and solution on the rate of electron transfer, especially emphasizing the involvement of the solvated electron and its free energy of solvation. This theory has been confirmed and extended within the framework of contemporary physical electron transfer models. Frumkin introduced the concept of the zero charge potential, the most important characteristic of a metal surface. The effect of adsorption on observed electrode kinetics is known as the Frumkin effect.

Alessandro Volta&#x27;s question—a topic of discussion for over 120 years—about the nature of the EMF of electrochemical circuits was resolved using Frumkin&#x27;s approach. Frumkin has developed the Frumkin isotherm, an extension of the Langmuir isotherm in describing certain adsorption phenomena. Frumkin&#x27;s students developed novel experimental methods that would, in time, become standard. Several applied electrochemical processes, including ones related to chemical sources of electrical power, industrial electrolysis, and anti-corrosion protection, were successfully developed under Frumkin&#x27;s supervision.

==Honours and awards==
* Hero of Socialist Labour - 1965
* Order of Lenin, three times
* Order of the Red Banner of Labour, three times
* Lenin Prize (1931)
* Stalin Prize, three times (1941, 1949, 1952)
Frumkin was nominated for Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1946, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965 and 1966, but he did not receive the Prize.

Additionally, characters from &quot;The Prince of Tennis&quot; appeared in the &quot;Shōnen Jump&quot; based video games &quot;Jump Super Stars&quot; and &quot;Jump Ultimate Stars&quot;.

===Dramas===

There also are two Chinese dramas based on &quot;The Prince of Tennis&quot; story, with the titles of &quot;The Prince of Tennis&quot; (Mandarin: &quot;网球王子&quot;; Pinyin: &quot;Wang Qiu Wang Zi&quot;) and &quot;Go for It! The Prince of Tennis&quot; (Mandarin: &quot;加油! 网球王子&quot;; Pinyin: &quot;Jia You! Wang Qiu Wang Zi&quot;). The first is the first season, while the second is the second season. There are some differences due to localization for names and cultural themes, including all the characters being renamed, but is still recognizable from its story and the characters&#x27; portrayal. The first season covers from when Ryoma first appears in the series up to the end of their equivalent of the Tokyo Prefecturals, while the second season picks up from the end of the first season and goes to the end of their equivalent of the Kanto Tournament. Due to being based on the anime, Josei Shonan is included. In addition, hints of the live-action film is present.

A third Chinese drama, produced by Netflix in 2019, is called &quot;The Prince of Tennis&quot; (奋斗吧，少年！or &quot;Forge On, Young Men&quot;). It is set in China. A reticent talented teenage tennis player returns to China after spending his childhood overseas—the show does not specify where he spends his childhood—but he is trapped under the shadows of his father who used to be a top tennis player. When he joins a high school in China, he learns the importance of friendship and teamwork, and perhaps even gains his self-identity.

===Other media===
The series has produced a half-hour weekly radio show, over 300 music CDs and a large selection of merchandise. Including a trading card game and figures. Three live events, &quot;TeniPuri Perfect Live&quot; in 2003, &quot;The 100 song marathon&quot; in 2008 and &quot;Tenipuri Festa&quot; in 2009, were held by the &quot;TeniPuri&quot; voice actors and Konomi Takeshi himself.

The 1986 J-pop song &quot;Valentine Kiss&quot; by Sayuri Kokushō was covered multiple times by multiple characters in the series. From February 2004 through February 2010, a total of nine different versions of the song were released (seven individually, and the final two together). The first one, featuring the character Keigo Atobe (voiced by Junichi Suwabe) reached No. 14 on the Oricon charts.

==Reception==
&quot;The Prince of Tennis&quot; has become a successful franchise. By March 2008, the first 40 volumes of the manga had sold over 40 million copies. By January 2012, the manga had over 51 million copies in circulation. By November 2019, the manga had over 60 million copies in circulation.

Carl Kimlinger from &quot;Anime News Network&quot; reviewed the first DVD box set released by Viz Media, and commented that &quot;&quot;Prince of Tennis&quot; is among the dregs of the genre.&quot; They go on to say that it is &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;lacks the human drama necessary to get audiences to care who wins or loses.&quot; Chris Beveridge of &quot;Mania.com&quot;, however, commented that the show &quot;takes the usual themes in sports shows and applies them masterfully.&quot; DVD Talk takes more of a nonchalant view, commenting that the &quot;series is okay but not great&quot; and that it has some charm, which will make you not regret watching it. Active Anime also gave praise to the series, saying that it &quot;holds some surprising twists to the regular sports drama formula&quot;, and praised the suspenseful matches and innovative techniques.

In a 2005 poll conducted by TV Asahi for the 100 most popular anime television series, &quot;The Prince of Tennis&quot; came in 27th place. They also conducted an online web poll, in which &quot;The Prince of Tennis&quot; placed eighteenth. Nearly a year later, TV Asahi once again conducted an online poll for the top 100 anime series, and &quot;The Prince of Tennis&quot; advanced in rank and came in eighth place. They also surveyed Japanese celebrities for their favorite anime, where the series only came in 68th out of the top 100.

<text>The Kazanka (; ) is a river in the Russian Federation, a left tributary of the Volga. The Kazanka begins near the village of Bimeri in Arsk District and flows into the Kuybyshev Reservoir in Kazan, near the Kazan Kremlin. Other towns on the Kazanka are Arsk and historical Iske Kazan. The river is long, and has a drainage basin of . The main tributaries are the Iya, Kismes, Shimyakovka and Sula. Historically, the Bulak river flowed into Kazanka until it was separated by a dam in 1957. The maximum river discharge is , and the minimal mineralization is 400–1000 mg/L. In Tatarstan, Kazanka has a status of a &quot;natural monument&quot;.

During the construction of the Samara Reservoir, a lower part of the Kazanka valley was flooded. A part of the riverbed was separated from the reservoir by dams, creating a new riverbed. In 2008, a project was proposed to fill in a cove in the wide section of the estuary for a business district.

The Kazanka divides the city of Kazan into two almost equal parts. Six bridges within the city cross the Kazanka; the most notable among them is the Millennium Bridge.

<text>Sir Edward Mellanby (8 April 1884 – 30 January 1955) was a British biochemist and nutritionist who discovered vitamin D and its role in preventing rickets in 1919.

==Education==
Mellanby was born in West Hartlepool, the son of a shipyard owner, and educated at Barnard Castle School and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he studied physiology.

==Career==
After working as a research student from 1905 to 1907, Mellanby studied medicine at St. Thomas&#x27;s Hospital in London, and in 1913 became a medical doctor. He served as a lecturer at King&#x27;s College for Women in London from 1913 to 1920, during which time he was asked to investigate the cause of rickets. He discovered that feeding caged dogs on a diet of porridge induced rickets, which could then be cured with cod liver oil and concluded that rickets was caused by a dietary factor. It was later discovered that the actual cause of rickets is lack of vitamin D due to lack of sunlight which can be prevented or remedied by ingesting food rich in vitamin D, such as cod liver oil.

He worked on the detrimental effect of foods containing significant phytic acid, particularly cereals.

In 1914 he married May Tweedy, a lecturer at Bedford College (London) who would also carry out research into nutrition and dental disease.

In 1920 he was appointed professor of pharmacology at the University of Sheffield, and consultant physician at the Royal Infirmary in that city. He then served as the secretary of the Medical Research Council from 1933 to 1949.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1925. He was awarded their Royal Medal in 1932 and their Buchanan Medal in 1947.

In 1932, Mellanby was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. He delivered the Croonian Lecture to the Royal College of Physicians in 1933 and the Croonian lecture to the Royal Society in 1943, both on the subject of diet.

He was knighted (KCB) in the 1937 Coronation Honours and made GBE in the 1948 New Year Honours. He was appointed an Honorary Physician to the King in 1937.

==Selected publications==

Publications include &quot;Nutrition and Disease – the Interaction of Clinical and Experimental Work&quot; (Edinburgh and London: Oliver and Boyd, 1934). In the work, he writes extensively on vitamin deficiency. He delivered the Harveian Oration to the Royal College of Physicians in 1938.

<doc id="495325" wikidata="Q4772857" url="?curid=495325" title="Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Sr.">
<text>Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Sr. (October 1, 1874 – May 27, 1948) was a millionaire whose fortune allowed him to pursue theatricals, self-published writing, athletics, and Christianity on a full-time basis.

He trained men in hand-to-hand combat in both World Wars, was a fellow of the American Geographical Society and founded a movement called &quot;Athletic Christianity&quot; that eventually attracted 300,000 members around the world. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; called him &quot;boxing&#x27;s greatest amateur&quot; in 1955, as well as a &quot;major factor in the re-establishment of boxing as a legal and, at that time, estimable sport.&quot;

A fictionalized Biddle appears in the 1967 Disney musical film &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot;.

== Early life ==
He was born on October 1, 1874, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Edward Biddle II and Emily Drexel. He was a grandson of banker Anthony Joseph Drexel, and a great-grandson of banker Nicholas Biddle. Biddle was a graduate of Germany&#x27;s Heidelberg University.

==Career==
An officer in the United States Marine Corps, Biddle was an expert in close-quarters fighting and the author of &quot;Do or Die: A Supplementary Manual on Individual Combat&quot;, a book on combat methods, including knives and empty-hand skills, training both the United States Marine Corps in two world wars and special agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He can be seen training Marines in the RKO short documentary &quot;Soldiers of the Sea&quot;. He was considered not just an expert in fighting, but also a pioneer of United States Marine Corps training in the bayonet and hand-to-hand combat. He based his style on fencing, though this approach was sometimes criticized as being unrealistic for military combat.

Having joined the Marines in 1917 at the age of 41, he also convinced his superiors to include boxing in Marine Corps recruit training. In 1919, he was promoted to the rank of major, and became a lieutenant colonel in 1934. In Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, right outside of Philadelphia, Biddle opened a military training facility, where he trained 4,000 men. His training included long hours of calisthenics and gymnastics, and taught skills such as machete, saber, dagger, and bayonet combat, as well as hand grenade use, boxing, wrestling, savate and jiujitsu. He also served two years in the National Guard.

A keen boxer, Biddle sparred with Jack Johnson and taught boxing to Gene Tunney. He even hosted &quot;boxing teas&quot; in his home, where other boxers would spar a couple of rounds with him and then join the family for dinner. A February 1909 match with Philadelphia Jack O&#x27;Brien was attended by society leaders including women in elegant evening gowns.

He served as a judge in the fight between Jack Dempsey and Jess Willard on 4 July 1919.
On February 5, 1920, Biddle, as chairman of the Army Navy and Civilian Board of Boxing Control of New York, became a member the International Boxing Union.

During World War II, Biddle returned to active duty with the Marine Corps with the rank of colonel and taught hand-to-hand combat to recruits.

===Writings===
Biddle also worked in and on periodicals. He spent time as a sports reporter for the &quot;Public Ledger&quot;, and jokingly referred to himself as &quot;the poorest and richest reporter in Philadelphia&quot;. He also revived the &quot;Philadelphia Sunday Graphic&quot; for a short interval, before it was forced to fold, and founded a short-lived &quot;society weekly&quot;–type publication, &quot;The People&quot;. After organizing the also short-lived Drexel Biddle Publishing House, he acted as its head for two years.

Books written by Biddle include:

* &quot;A dual rôle: and other stories&quot;. The Warwick Book Publishing Company. 1894.
* &quot;The Madeira Islands&quot;. Philadelphia: Drexel, Biddle &amp; Bradley Publishing Company. 1896.
* &quot;Shantytown Sketches&quot;. Philadelphia: Drexel, Biddle &amp; Bradley Publishing Company. 1897.
* &quot;The Froggy Fairy Book&quot; (1896) and &quot;The Second Froggy Fairy Book&quot; (1900) Drexel, Biddle &amp; Bradley publishing company
* &quot;The Flowers of Life&quot;. Philadelphia: Drexel, Biddle &amp; Bradley Publishing Company. 1897.
* &quot;Word for Word and Letter for Letter; a biographical romance&quot;. Gay &amp; Bird. 1898.
* &quot;The Land of the Wine&quot;. London: The Author&#x27;s Syndicate. 1901.
* &quot;Do or Die: A Supplementary Manual on Individual Combat&quot;. U.S. Marine Corps. 1937. (reprinted 1944 with new material, reprinted 1975)

==Personal life==
In 1895, he married Cordelia Rundell Bradley. Together, they had:

* Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Jr. (1897–1961), who married Mary Duke (1887–1960). They were the parents of Mary Duke Biddle (1920–2012) and Nicholas Benjamin Duke Biddle
* Cordelia Drexel Biddle (1898–1984), who married firstly Angier Buchanan Duke (1884–1923), the son of Benjamin Newton Duke. They were the parents of Angier Biddle Duke (1915–1995) and Anthony Drexel Duke (1918–2014). Her second marriage was to then architect Thomas Markoe Robertson in 1924.
* Livingston Ludlow Biddle (1899–1981), who married Kate Raboteau Page (b. 1903), daughter of Robert N. Page. They were the parents of Livingston Ludlow Biddle III. Kate obtained a divorce in Reno in 1937, citing cruelty. Biddle married Suzanne Hutchinson Burke (1909-2000) whose mother was Mary Forbes Fay, the daughter of Alford Forbes Fay (1843-1881). Suzanne donated two paintings by Jane Stuart of her mother and great uncle Sigourney Webster Fay (1836-1908) to the Boston Athenaeum in 1983. Monsignor Cyril Sigourney Webster Fay (1875-1919) was her uncle; he was an early mentor to author F. Scott Fitzgerald..

He died May 27, 1948, from a cerebral hemorrhage and uremic poisoning and is interred at the Woodlands Cemetery in Philadelphia.

==Legacy==
His daughter Cordelia Drexel Biddle collaborated with Kyle Crichton (father of Robert Crichton) to write the 1955 novel &quot;My Philadelphia Father&quot;, based on her family. The book was adapted as a stage play starring Walter Pidgeon in 1956. The story of the eccentric millionaire patriarch was adapted as a musical film in 1967, with Fred MacMurray portraying Biddle in &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot;, the last film to have personal involvement from Walt Disney. The book &quot;Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Sr.: Pioneer of Combatives in the U.S.A.&quot; was published in 2023.

<doc id="495333" wikidata="Q1077875" url="?curid=495333" title="Da Pump">
<text>is a Japanese boy band made up of lead vocalist, Issa Hentona and MCs Ken Okumoto, Yukinari Tamaki and Shinobu Miyara. The band formed as students at Okinawa Actors School in 1996. They made their debut on the Avex Trax subsidiary avex tune under the guidance of producer Akio Togashi on June 11, 1997, with &quot;Feelin&#x27; Good - It&#x27;s Paradise&quot;. As one of the few male bands unassociated with Johnny&#x27;s Entertainment, they were the first to gain major popularity reaching their peak in 2001 with the release of &quot;Da Best of Da Pump&quot;. 

On April 7, 2006, Shinobu formally left the band following a hiatus due to a drunk driving incident in 2005. The band went on an unofficial hiatus at the end of 2006. On December 18, 2008, it was announced that Yukinari was leaving the band and that Ken and Issa were actively looking for his replacement. Within hours, their management company announced a brand new Da Pump with seven new members and a new concept as a multimedia entertainment group. The band will start their official comeback on July 15, 2009, with the new single, &quot;Summer Rider&quot; and a tour in the fall. It was announced on December 5, 2009, that Ken Okumoto had left Da Pump to pursue a solo career, leaving Issa the only original member left. Da Pump now consists of Issa, Kenzo, Tomo, Kimi, Yori, and U-Yeah.

Da Pump made their comeback in May 2018 with the hit single, &quot;U.S.A.&quot;, a song originally written by Italian singer Joe Yellow.

==Biography==
Famed for their ability in both dancing and singing, Da Pump&#x27;s debut came in 1997, with the song &quot;Feelin Good - It&#x27;s Paradise&quot; and breaking through with &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; (and using the song as their entry on the &quot;white&quot; team during the 1998 Kōhaku Uta Gassen). The band originally came from Okinawa Actors School but are now part of the Avex Network and are produced by Akio Togashi. Their songs tend to have a quick tempo and often include elements of rap. Da Pump often appears in TV shows, movies, and magazines throughout Japan.

Issa has stated that he is a fan of the long-running Kamen Rider Series tokusatsu programs, and has contributed to the soundtracks of &quot;Kamen Rider 555&quot; with its opening theme &quot;Justiφ&#x27;s&quot; and its film&#x27;s theme &quot;Justiφ&#x27;s -Accel Mix-&quot; as well as the theme for the film &quot;Kamen Rider: The Next&quot;, &quot;Chosen Soldier&quot;. As a band, Da Pump had performed the theme to the film &quot;Kamen Rider: The First&quot;, &quot;Bright! our Future&quot;, and Issa played the role of a Shocker commander in the film. In 2018, he and Japanese singer Shuta Sueyoshi of AAA fame collaborated on the single &quot;Over &quot;Quartzer&quot;&quot;, the opening theme for the 20th anniversary series of the Kamen Rider franchise, Kamen Rider Zi-O.

Following a DUI arrest in 2005, Shinobu temporarily suspended all activities from the band. However, on 7 April 2006, he officially announced that he left the group. The remaining members of Da Pump continued with three members. On December 18, 2008, it was announced that Yukinari was leaving the band and that Ken and Issa were actively looking for his replacement. Within hours, their management company announced a brand new Da Pump with seven new members. Ken left the group in 2009. 

In 2014, the band returned with their first single in three years, &quot;New Position&quot;. Then after an absence of four years, Da Pump returned the hit single, &quot;U.S.A.&quot;, in 2018.

To celebrate Trans Media 19th Anniversary, Da Pump was a special performance (alongside Super Junior, Johnny&#x27;s West, and Eriko Imai), with their single hits &quot;Dragon Screamer&quot;, &quot;Joyfull&quot; and &quot;Corazon&quot;.

On April 1, 2021, Daichi announced he would be leaving the group by the end of the month due to worsening of his chronic hernia. Later the same day, the Kansai University of Social Welfare posted a music video, in collaboration with DA PUMP, for a song titled &quot;Believe in your dream&quot;, co-written by Issa and m.c.A·T.

<doc id="495340" wikidata="Q611483" url="?curid=495340" title="Russian grammar">
<text>Russian grammar employs an Indo-European inflectional structure, with considerable adaptation.

Russian has a highly inflectional morphology, particularly in nominals (nouns, pronouns, adjectives and numerals). Russian literary syntax is a combination of a Church Slavonic heritage, a variety of loaned and adopted constructs, and a standardized vernacular foundation.

The spoken language has been influenced by the literary one, with some additional characteristic forms. Russian dialects show various non-standard grammatical features, some of which are archaisms or descendants of old forms discarded by the literary language.

Various terms are used to describe Russian grammar with the meaning they have in standard Russian discussions of historical grammar, as opposed to the meaning they have in descriptions of the English language; in particular, aorist, imperfect, etc., are considered verbal tenses, rather than aspects, because ancient examples of them are attested for both perfective and imperfective verbs. Russian also places the accusative case between the dative and the instrumental, and in the tables below, the accusative case appears between the nominative and genitive cases.

== Nouns ==

Nominal declension involves six main casesnominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, and prepositionalin two numbers (singular and plural), and grammatical gender (masculine, feminine, and neuter). Up to ten additional cases are identified in linguistics textbooks, although all of them are either incomplete (do not apply to all nouns) or degenerate (appear identical to one of the six main cases) – the most recognized additional cases are locative, partitive and vocative. Old Russian also had a third number, the dual, but it has been lost except for its use in the nominative and accusative cases with the numbers 1½, 2, 3 and 4 (e.g. &quot;an hour and a half&quot;, &quot;two chairs&quot;), where it is now reanalyzed as genitive singular.

Russian has some nouns that only appear in the singular form (singulare tantum), for example: , ; also, approximatеly 600 words appear only in the plural form (plurale tantum): , .

More often than in many other Indo-European languages, Russian noun cases may supplant the use of prepositions entirely. Furthermore, every preposition is exclusively used with a particular case (or cases). Their usage can be summarised as:
* nominative ():
** main subject;
** default case to use outside sentences (dictionary entries, signs, etc.);
** prepositions: &#x27;(what) kind of?&#x27;; : &#x27;join the ranks of&#x27; (with plural nouns only);
* accusative ():
** direct object;
** some time expressions;
** prepositions indicating motion: &#x27;into, in(ward)&#x27;, &#x27;onto (the top of)&#x27;, &#x27;behind, after&#x27;, &#x27;under&#x27;;
** other prepositions: &#x27;about&#x27;, &#x27;over, through&#x27;, &#x27;through&#x27;;
* genitive ():
** possession – &#x27;of&#x27; (genitive noun);
** numerals and quantifiers;
** negated verbs (which take direct objects in accusative) to indicate total absence;
** some time expressions;
** prepositions: &#x27;without&#x27;, &#x27;instead of&#x27;, &#x27;near&#x27;, &#x27;around&#x27;, &#x27;ahead of&#x27;, &#x27;for&#x27;, &#x27;before&#x27;, &#x27;from&#x27;, &#x27;because of, from behind&#x27;, &#x27;from&#x27;, &#x27;except for&#x27;, &#x27;past by&#x27;, &#x27;near&#x27;, &#x27;after&#x27;, &#x27;against, opposite&#x27;, &#x27;among&#x27;, &#x27;by&#x27;, &#x27;near&#x27;, &#x27;along&#x27;, &#x27;out of, outside&#x27;, &#x27;inside&#x27;;
** verbs: &#x27;afraid of&#x27;, &#x27;reach&#x27;, &#x27;avoid&#x27;;
** adjectives: &#x27;full of&#x27; (genitive noun);
* dative ():
** indirect object – &#x27;to&#x27; (dative noun);
** some time expressions;
** impersonal clauses: – &#x27;I am cold&#x27;, lit. &quot;to_me (is) cold&quot;;
** age statements: – &#x27;I am 20 (years old)&#x27;, lit. &#x27;to_me (is) 20 years&#x27;;
** prepositions: &#x27;on&#x27;, &#x27;to(wards)&#x27;, &#x27;thanks to&#x27;;
** auxiliaries: &quot;or&quot; &#x27;need/must (to)&#x27;, &#x27;allowed&#x27;, &#x27;forbidden&#x27;;
** verbs: &#x27;believe&#x27;, &#x27;help&#x27;, &#x27;advise&#x27;, &#x27;call&#x27;, &#x27;amaze (self)&#x27;;
* instrumental ():
** instrument used in the action or means by which action is carried out – &#x27;by&#x27; (I. noun);
** logical subject of passive clause: – &#x27;the letter was written by Ivan&#x27;;
** secondary direct object: – &#x27;he is considered (to be) a student&#x27;;
** durational time expressions;
** verbs: &#x27;interest (to be interested in)&#x27;, &#x27;use&#x27;, &#x27;occupy (to be preoccupied with)&#x27;;
** associates of connective verbs: &#x27;be&#x27;, &#x27;became&#x27;, &#x27;remain&#x27;, &#x27;appear to be&#x27;, &#x27;turn out to be&#x27;;
** prepositions of position: &#x27;behind&#x27;, &#x27;in front of&#x27;, &#x27;above&#x27;, &#x27;below&#x27;, &#x27;between&#x27;, &#x27;(together) with&#x27;;
** adjective: &#x27;pleased by&#x27;;
* prepositional ():
** prepositions of place: &#x27;inside&#x27;, &#x27;on (top of)&#x27;;
** other prepositions: &#x27;about&#x27;, &#x27;by/of/with&#x27;;
Definite and indefinite articles (corresponding to &#x27;the&#x27;, &#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;an&#x27; in English) do not exist in the Russian language. The sense conveyed by such articles can be determined in Russian by context. However, Russian also utilizes other means of expressing whether a noun is definite or indefinite:
* The use of a direct object in the genitive instead of the accusative in negation signifies that the noun is indefinite, compare: (&quot;I don&#x27;t see a book&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t see any books&quot;) and (&quot;I don&#x27;t see the book&quot;).
* The same goes for certain verbs expressing a desire to achieve something: wait, wish, ask, want, etc. When the inanimate object is definite (certain, or at least expected), the accusative is used; when it is indefinite (uncertain), the genitive is used. Compare: (&quot;I&#x27;m waiting for the bus&quot;, а specific, scheduled bus) and (&quot;I&#x27;m waiting for a bus&quot;, any bus, if one will come).
* The use of the numeral one sometimes signifies that the noun is indefinite, e.g.: – (&quot;Why did you take so long?&quot; – &quot;Well, I met one [=a] friend and had to talk&quot;).
* Word order may also be used for this purpose; compare (&quot;Into the room rushed a boy&quot;) and (&quot;The boy rushed into the room&quot;).
* The plural form may signify indefiniteness: (&quot;You can buy this in shops&quot;) vs. (&quot;You can buy this in the shop&quot;).

The category of animacy is relevant in Russian nominal and adjectival declension. Specifically, the accusative has two possible forms in many paradigms, depending on the animacy of the referent. For animate referents (persons and animals), the accusative form is generally identical to the genitive form. For inanimate referents, the accusative form is identical to the nominative form. This principle is relevant for masculine singular nouns of the second declension (see below) and adjectives, and for all plural paradigms (with no gender distinction). In the tables below, this behavior is indicated by the abbreviation &#x27;N or G&#x27; in the row corresponding to the accusative case.

Russian uses three declensions:
* The first declension is used for feminine nouns ending with / and some masculine nouns having the same form as those of feminine gender, such as (papa) or (uncle); also, common-gender nouns like (bully) are masculine or feminine depending on the person to which they refer.
* The second declension is used for most masculine and neuter nouns.
* The third declension is used for feminine nouns ending in .

A group of irregular &quot;different-declension nouns&quot; (), consists of a few neuter nouns ending in (e.g. &quot;time&quot;) and one masculine noun &quot;way&quot;. However, these nouns and their forms have sufficient similarity with feminine third declension nouns that scholars such as Litnevskaya consider them to be non-feminine forms of this declension.

Nouns ending with , , (not to be confused with nominalized adjectives) are written with instead of in prepositional (as this ending is never stressed, there is no difference in pronunciation): – &quot;streaming – in lower streaming of a river&quot;. However, if words and represent a compound preposition meaning&quot;while, during the time of&quot;they are written with : &quot;in a time of an hour&quot;. For nouns ending in , , or , using in the prepositional (where endings of some of them are stressed) is usually erroneous, but in poetic speech it may be acceptable (as we replace with for metric or rhyming purposes): (Fyodor Tyutchev).

=== First declension ===

==== Feminine and masculine nouns ending with а or vowel ====

=== Second declension ===

==== Masculine nouns ending with a consonant sound ====
Some singular nouns denoting groups of people may include the suffix before ending.

==== Neuter nouns ====

=== Third declension ===

==== Feminine nouns ending with letter ь ====
==== Neuter nouns ending with мя ====

=== Indeclinable nouns ===
Some nouns (such as borrowings from other languages, abbreviations, etc.) are not modified when they change number and case. This occurs especially when the ending appears not to match any declension pattern in the appropriate gender. An example of an indeclinable noun is кофе (&quot;coffee&quot;).

=== Additional cases ===

Some nouns use several additional cases. The most important of these are:
* Locative (): the most common minor case, used with some nouns after the prepositions of location and . With most nouns, the prepositional form is used in such instances. When there is a distinct locative, it takes the form of the dative ending but with the ending necessarily stressed. A few feminine nouns ending in have a locative form of independent origin, consisting of the singular genitive/dative/prepositional ending but with the ending necessarily stressed. This may mean it matches the dative, or it may take a unique form. For example, in (&quot;in the mouth&quot;) and (&quot;in the chest&quot;), the locatives of (&quot;mouth&quot;) and match the dative forms and (modern) . In the case of , this differs from the prepositional , but in the case of the prepositional (and all other singular oblique cases besides instrumental) have merged with the locative. In (&quot;in the forest&quot;) and (&quot;in view (of)&quot;), the locatives of (&quot;forest&quot;) and (&quot;link, connection&quot;) differ from both the prepositional and and the dative and (the dative and locative of are spelt identically but pronounced differently).
* Partitive (), or second genitive: sometimes used instead of the accusative (as it should be for the direct object) to imply, that only part of the object is affected by the verb: &quot;to pour some tea&quot; (not all the tea) — from &quot;to pour the tea&quot;. This form may be also used after nouns meaning quantity: &quot;a cup of tea&quot; (also with the standard genitive).
* Vocative (): used to call or speak to a person. There are two types of vocative in modern Russian. The common Slavic vocative is archaic and survives only in fixed expressions: (My God!). The modern vocative (sometimes called neo-vocative) is produced from a first-declension noun by removing the vowel ending: &quot;mom, can you hear me?&quot; from . It can only be applied to familiar (affectionate) terms for family members or close friends and diminutives of commonly used Slavic names: (full name) — (short, affectionate) — (neo-vocative); . It is frequently used in the informal spoken language with a certain number of nouns in the plural: (&quot;guys, let&#x27;s go!&quot;) from , (&quot;girls, look!&quot;) from .

== Adjectives ==
A Russian adjective () is usually placed before the noun it qualifies, and it agrees with the noun in case, gender, and number. With the exception of a few invariant forms borrowed from other languages, such as (&#x27;beige&#x27;, non-adapted form of ) or (&#x27;khaki-colored&#x27;), most adjectives follow one of a small number of regular declension patterns (except for some that complicate the ). In modern Russian, the short form appears only in the nominative and is used when the adjective is in a predicative role: are short forms of (&#x27;new&#x27;). Formerly (as in the bylinas) short adjectives appeared in all other forms and roles, which are not used in the modern language, but are nonetheless understandable to Russian speakers as they are declined exactly like nouns of the corresponding gender.

Adjectives may be divided into three general groups:
* qualitative () – denote a quality of the object; this is the only group that usually has degrees of comparison.
* relational () – denote some sort of relationship; unlikely to act as a predicate or have a short form.
* possessive () – denote belonging to a specific subject; have some declensional peculiarities.

=== Adjectival declension ===
The pattern described below holds true for full forms of most adjectives, except possessive ones. It is also used for substantivized adjectives as (&quot;scientist, scholar&quot; as a noun substitute or &quot;scientific, learned&quot; as a general adjective) and for adjectival participles. Russian differentiates between hard-stem and soft-stem adjectives, shown before and after a slash sign.

* The masculine and neuter genitive singular adjectival endings -ого and -его are pronounced as -ово and -ево.
* After a sibilant (ш, ж, ч, щ) or velar (к, г, х) consonant, и is written instead of ы.
* When the stress falls on the first syllable of the ending throughout the declension, the masculine adjective ends in -ой in the nominative singular: (, &quot;straight&quot;), compare (, &quot;stubborn&quot;).
* The &quot;хоро́шее rule&quot; states that after a sibilant consonant, neuter adjectives end in -ее.
* The masculine accusative singular and the accusative plural endings depend on animacy, as with nouns.
* The instrumental feminine ending -ой/-ей has the archaic alternative form -ою/-ею for all adjectives, which has only a stylistic difference.
* There are often stress changes in the short form. For example, the short forms of хоро́ший (&quot;good&quot;) are хоро́ш (m.), хороша́ (f.), хорошо́ (n.), хороши́ (pl.), and the forms of но́вый (&quot;new&quot;) are но́в (m.), нова́ (f.), но́во (n.), но́вы/новы́ (pl.).
* In the masculine singular short form, when a word-final consonant cluster is being formed after ending removal, an additional е or о &quot;fleeting vowel&quot; is inserted after the root, as in голо́дный – го́лоден (&quot;hungry&quot;), or у́зкий – у́зок (&quot;narrow&quot;).
* Some adjectives (e.g. большо́й &quot;big&quot;, ру́сский &quot;Russian&quot;) have no short forms.

=== Comparison of adjectives ===
Comparison forms are usual only for qualitative adjectives and adverbs. Comparative and superlative synthetic forms are not part of the paradigm of original adjective but are different lexical items, since not all qualitative adjectives have them. A few adjectives have irregular forms that are declined as usual adjectives: большо́й &#x27;big&#x27; – бо́льший &#x27;bigger&#x27;, хоро́ший &#x27;good&#x27; – лу́чший &#x27;better&#x27;. Most synthetically-derived comparative forms are derived by adding the suffix -е́е or -е́й to the adjective stem: кра́сный &#x27;red&#x27; – красне́е &#x27;redder&#x27;; these forms are difficult to distinguish from adverbs, whose comparative forms often coincide with those of their adjectival counterparts. Superlative synthetic forms are derived by adding the suffix -е́йш- or -а́йш- and additionally sometimes the prefix наи-, or using a special comparative form with the prefix наи-: до́брый &#x27;kind&#x27; – добре́йший &#x27;the kindest&#x27;, большо́й &#x27;big&#x27; – наибо́льший &#x27;the biggest&#x27;.

An alternative is to add an adverb to the positive form of the adjective. The adverbs used for this are бо́лее &#x27;more&#x27; / ме́нее &#x27;less&#x27; and са́мый &#x27;most&#x27; / наибо́лее &#x27;most&#x27; / наиме́нее &#x27;least&#x27;: for example, до́брый &#x27;kind&#x27; – бо́лее до́брый &#x27;kinder&#x27; – са́мый до́брый &#x27;the kindest&#x27;. This way is rarely used if special comparative forms exist.

=== Possessive adjectives ===
Possessive adjectives are less frequently used in Russian than in most other Slavic languages, but are in use. They respond to the questions чей? чья? чьё? чьи? (whose?) and denote only animate possessors. See section below.

== Pronouns ==
=== Personal pronouns ===
* Russian is subject to the T–V distinction. The respectful form of the singular &quot;you&quot; is the same as the plural form. It begins with a capital letter: &quot;Вы&quot;, &quot;Вас&quot;, &quot;Вам&quot;, etc., in the following situations: personal letters and official papers (addressee is definite), and questionnaires (addressee is indefinite); otherwise it begins with minuscule. Compare the distinction between &quot;du&quot; and &quot;Sie&quot; in German or &quot;tu&quot; and &quot;vous&quot; in French.
* When a preposition is used directly before a third-person pronoun, it is prefixed with н-: у него (read: у нево), с неё, etc. Because the prepositional case always occurs after a preposition, the third person prepositional always starts with an н-.
* There are special cases for prepositions before first person singular pronouns: со мной – &quot;with me&quot; (usually &quot;с&quot;), ко мне – &quot;to me&quot; (usually &quot;к&quot;), во мне – &quot;in me&quot; (usually &quot;в&quot;), обо мне – &quot;about me&quot; (usually &quot;о&quot;). All of these preposition forms are unstressed.
* Like adjectives and numerals, letter &quot;г&quot; (g) in masculine and neuter 3rd person genitive and accusative forms is pronounced as &quot;в&quot; (v): (н)его – (н)ево.
* English &quot;it&quot; can be translated as both оно́ (neuter personal pronoun) and э́то (neuter proximal demonstrative, &quot;this&quot;). The latter is used as a stub pronoun for a subject: э́то хорошо́ – &quot;it/this is good&quot;, кто́ это? – &quot;who is it/this?&quot;.

=== Demonstrative pronouns ===
If the preposition &quot;about&quot; is used (usually &quot;о&quot;), for singular demonstrative pronouns (as with any other words starting with a vowel) it is &quot;об&quot;: об э́том – about this.

=== Possessive adjectives and pronouns ===
Unlike English, Russian uses the same form for a possessive adjective and the corresponding possessive pronoun. In Russian grammar they are called possessive pronouns притяжательные местоимения (compare with possessive adjectives like Peter&#x27;s = Петин above). The following rules apply:
* Possessive pronouns agree with the noun of the possessed in case, gender, and number.
* The reflexive pronoun свой is used when the possessor is the subject of the clause, whatever the person, gender, and number of that subject.
* No non-reflexive exists for the third person: the genitive of the personal pronoun is instead, i.e. его for a masculine/neuter singular possessor, её for a feminine singular possessor and их for a plural possessor. But unlike other genitives used with a possessive meaning, in modern Russian these words are usually placed before the object of possession.
* Example of the difference between reflexive and non-reflexive pronouns:
** &quot;Он лю́бит свою́ жену́ = He loves his (own) wife&quot;   while   &quot;Он лю́бит его́ жену́ = He loves his (someone else&#x27;s) wife&quot;.
* Unlike Latin where a similar rule applies for the third person only, Russian accepts using reflexives for all persons:
** &quot;Я люблю́ (свою́) жену́ = I love my wife&quot;
** &quot;Я люблю́ себя́ = I love myself&quot;

The ending -его is pronounced as -ево́.

=== Interrogative pronouns ===

These interrogatives are used by scholars to denote &quot;usual&quot; questions for correspondent grammatical cases (prepositional is used with &quot;о&quot;): (кто?) Ма́ша лю́бит (кого?) Ва́сю – (who?) Masha [N.] loves (whom?) Vasya [G.].

The ending &quot;-его&quot; is pronounced as &quot;-ево&quot;.

== Numerals ==


Russian has several classes of numerals ([имена] числительные): cardinal, ordinal, collective, and also fractional constructions; also it has other types of words, relative to numbers: collective adverbial forms (вдвоём), multiplicative (двойной) and counting-system (двоичный) adjectives, some numeric-pronominal and indefinite quantity words (сколько, много, несколько). Here are the numerals from 0 to 10:

== Verbs ==
Grammatical conjugation is subject to three persons in two numbers and two simple tenses (present/future and past), with periphrastic forms for the future and subjunctive, as well as imperative forms and present/past participles, distinguished by adjectival and adverbial usage (see adjectival participle and adverbial participle). Verbs and participles can be reflexive, i.e. have reflexive suffix -ся/-сь appended after ending.

The past tense is made to agree in gender with the subject, for it is the participle in an originally periphrastic perfect formed (like the perfect passive tense in Latin) with the present tense of the verb &quot;to be&quot; быть , which is now omitted except for rare archaic effect, usually in set phrases (откуда есть пошла земля русская , &quot;whence is come the Russian land&quot;, the opening of the Primary Chronicle in modern spelling). The participle nature of past-tense forms is exposed also in that they often have an extra suffix vowel, which is absent in present/future; the same vowel appears in infinitive form, which is considered by few scholars not to be verbal (and in the past it surely used to be a noun), but in which verbs appear in most dictionaries: ходить &quot;to walk&quot; – ходил &quot;(he) walked&quot; – хожу &quot;I walk&quot;.

Verbal inflection is considerably simpler than in Old Russian. The ancient aorist, imperfect, and (periphrastic) pluperfect have been lost, though the aorist sporadically occurs in secular literature as late as the second half of the eighteenth century, and survives as an odd form in direct narration (а он пойди да скажи , etc., &quot;exactly&quot; equivalent to the English colloquial &quot;so he goes and says&quot;), recategorized as a usage of the imperative. The loss of three of the former six tenses has been offset by the development, as in other Slavic languages, of verbal aspect (). Most verbs come in pairs, one with imperfective () or continuous, the other with perfective () or completed aspect, usually formed with a (prepositional) prefix, but occasionally using a different root. E.g., спать (&#x27;to sleep&#x27;) is imperfective; поспать (&#x27;to take a nap&#x27;) is perfective.

The present tense of the verb быть is today normally used only in the third-person singular form, есть, which is often used for all the persons and numbers. As late as the nineteenth century, the full conjugation, which today is extremely archaic, was somewhat more natural: forms occur in the Synodal Bible, in Dostoevsky and in the bylinas (былины ) or oral folk-epics, which were transcribed at that time. The paradigm shows as well as anything else the Indo-European affinity of Russian:


=== Infinitive ===
The infinitive is the basic form of a verb for most purposes of study. In Russian it has the suffix -ть/-ти (the latter is used after consonants), or ends with -чь (which comes from fusion of the final consonant of the stem and the suffix: -к- + -ть or -г- + -ть). For reflexive verbs -ся/-сь suffix is added in the end. Note that due to phonological effects, both -ться and -тся endings (latter is used for present-future tense of a 3rd person reflexive verb; see below) are pronounced as or and often cause misspellings even among native speakers.

=== Present-future tense ===
Future tense has two forms: simple and compound. 
*Future simple forms are formed by &quot;perfective verbs&quot; with the help of personal endings: &quot;She will read&quot; (&quot;She will have read&quot;) — &quot;Она́ прочита́ет/прочтёт&quot;; &quot;She will do some reading&quot; (&quot;She will be reading [for a certain amount of time]&quot;) — &quot;Она́ почита́ет&quot;.
*Future compound forms are formed by &quot;imperfective verbs&quot;: a future simple tense form of the verb &quot;быть&quot; (to be) and the infinitive of an imperfective verb. The Russian compound future tense is similar in structure to the English future progressive tense and is used to indicate that something will be in progress at a particular moment in the future: &quot;She will be reading&quot; — &quot;Она́ бу́дет чита́ть&quot;, without any assurance that an action will be completed, as opposed to using a perfective verb to refer to an action that is expected to be completed in the future: &quot;Она́ прочтёт&quot; — &quot;She will read / She will have read&quot;.
* -у/-ут,-ат is used after a hard consonant or ж, ш, щ or ч; otherwise -ю/-ют,-ят is used.
* A mutating final consonant may entail a change in the ending.
* е becomes ё when stressed.
Two forms are used to conjugate the present tense of imperfective verbs and the future tense of perfective verbs.

The first conjugation is used in verb stems ending in:

* a consonant,
* -у,-ы or -о,-я
* -е (In addition to below)
* Бить, пить, жить, шить, лить, вить, гнить, брить, стелить, зиждить.
* -а not preceded by a hush (ж, ш, щ or ч):

The second conjugation involves verb stems ending in:

* -и or -е (Глядеть, смотреть, видеть, ненавидеть, обидеть, зависеть, терпеть, вертеть, пыхтеть, сидеть, лететь, гудеть, гореть, сопеть, дудеть, блестеть, храпеть, смердеть, хрипеть, шелестеть, хрустеть, сипеть, кишеть, бдеть, звенеть, кряхтеть, кипеть, корпеть, зудеть, скорбеть, тарахтеть, шуметь, зреть, висеть, греметь, шипеть)
* -а preceded by a hush (ж, ш, щ or ч)(Слышать, дышать, держать, лежать, дребезжать, жужжать, брюзжать, дрожать, бренчать, стучать, мычать, кричать, молчать, рычать, мчать, урчать, звучать, бурчать, ворчать, торчать, журчать, гнать):
* Стоять, бояться
Example&quot;:&quot; попро-с-ить – попро-ш-у, попро-с-ят (to have solicited – [I, they] will have solicited).

==== Examples ====







There are five irregular verbs:
* бежа́ть (run), бре́зжить (glimmer) – first conjugation in the plural third person, second in other forms;
* хоте́ть (want) – first conjugation in the singular, second in plural;
* дать (give) – дам, дашь, даст, дади́м, дади́те, даду́т;
* есть (eat) – ем, ешь, ест, еди́м, еди́те, едя́т.

=== Past tense ===
The Russian past tense is gender specific: –л for masculine singular subjects, –ла for feminine singular subjects, –ло for neuter singular subjects, and –ли for plural subjects. This gender specificity applies to all persons; thus, to say &quot;I slept&quot;, a male speaker would say я спал, while a female speaker would say я спалá.

==== Examples ====
==== Exceptions ====




=== Moods ===
Russian verbs can form three moods (наклонения): indicative (изъявительное), conditional (сослагательное) and imperative (повелительное).

==== Imperative mood ====
The imperative mood second-person singular is formed from the future-present base of most verbs by adding -и (stressed ending in present-future, or if base ends on more than one consonant), -ь (unstressed ending, base on one consonant) or -й (unstressed ending, base on vowel). Plural (including polite &quot;на вы&quot;) second-person form is made by adding -те to singular one: говорю &#x27;I speak&#x27; – говори – говорите, забуду &#x27;I shall forget&#x27; – забудь – забудьте, клею &#x27;I glue&#x27; – клей – клейте. Some perfective verbs have first-person plural imperative form with -те added to similar simple future or present tense form: пойдёмте &#x27;let us go&#x27;. Other forms can express command in Russian; for third person, for example, пусть particle with future can be used: Пусть они замолчат! &#x27;Let them shut up!&#x27;.
==== Conditional mood ====

The conditional mood in Russian is formed by adding the particle бы after the word which marks the supposed subject into a sentence formed like in the past tense. Thus, to say &quot;I would (hypothetically) sleep&quot; or &quot;I would like to sleep&quot;, a male speaker would say я спал бы (or я бы поспа́л), while a female speaker would say я спалá бы (or я бы поспала́).

=== Verbs of motion ===
Verbs of motion are a distinct class of verbs found in several Slavic languages. Due to the extensive semantic information they contain, Russian verbs of motion pose difficulties for non-native learners at all levels of study. Unprefixed verbs of motion, which are all imperfective, divide into pairs based on the direction of the movement (uni- or multidirectional — sometimes referred to as determinate/indeterminate or definite/indefinite). As opposed to a verb-framed language, in which path is encoded in the verb, but manner of motion typically is expressed with complements, Russian is a &quot;satellite&quot; language, meaning that these concepts are encoded in both the root of the verb and the particles associated with it, satellites. Thus, the roots of motion verbs convey the lexical information of manner of movement, e.g. walking, crawling, running, whereas prefixes denote path, e.g. motion in and out of space. The roots also distinguish between means of conveyance, e.g. by transport or by one&#x27;s own power, and in transitive verbs, the object or person being transported. The information below provides an outline of the formation and basic usage of unprefixed and prefixed verbs of motion.

==== Unprefixed ====

==== Directionality ====
Unidirectional verbs describe motion in progress in one direction, e.g.:
* We are headed to the library.Мы идём в библиотеку.
* I was on my way to work.Я шла на работу.
* The birds are flying south.Птицы летят на юг.
Multidirectional verbs describe:
# General motion, referring to ability or habitual motion, without reference to direction or destination, e.g.:
#* The child has been walking for six months.Ребёнок ходит шесть месяцев.
#* Birds fly, fish swim, and dogs walk.Птицы летают, рыбы плавают, а собаки ходят.
# Movement in various directions, e.g.:
#* We walked around the city all day.Мы ходили по городу весь день.
# Repetition of completed trips, e.g.:
#* She goes to the supermarket every week.Она ходит в супермаркет каждую неделю.
# In the past tense, a single completed round trip, e.g.:
#* I went to Russia (and returned) last year.В прошлом году я ездил в Россию.

==== Unidirectional perfectives with по- ====
The addition of the prefix по- to a unidirectional verb of motion makes the verb perfective, denoting the beginning of a movement, i.e. &#x27;setting out&#x27;. These perfectives imply that the agent has not yet returned at the moment of speech, e.g.,

==== Going versus taking ====
Three pairs of motion verbs generally refer to &#x27;taking&#x27;, &#x27;leading&#x27; with additional lexical information on manner of motion and object of transport encoded in the verb stem. These are нести/носить, вести/водить, and везти/возить. See below for the specific information on manner and object of transport:

==== Prefixed motion verbs ====
Motion verbs combine with prefixes to form new aspectual pairs, which lose the distinction of directionality, but gain spatial or temporal meanings. The unidirectional verb serves as the base for the perfective, and the multidirectional as the base for the imperfective. In addition to the meanings conveyed by the prefix and the simplex motion verb, prepositional phrases also contribute to the expression of path in Russian. Thus, it is important to consider the whole verb phrase when examining verbs of motion.

In some verbs of motion, adding a prefix requires a different stem shape:

See below for a table the prefixes, their primary meanings, and the prepositions that accompany them, adapted from Muravyova. Several examples are taken directly or modified from Muravyova.

===== Idiomatic uses =====
The uni- and multidirectional distinction rarely figures into the metaphorical and idiomatic use of motion verbs, because such phrases typically call for one or the other verb. See below for examples:

=== Adjectival participle ===
Russian adjectival participles can be active or passive; have perfective or imperfective aspect; imperfective participles can have present or past tense, while perfective ones in classical language can be only past. As adjectives, they are declined by case, number and gender. If adjectival participles are derived from reciprocal verbs, they have suffix -ся appended after the adjectival ending; this suffix in participles &quot;never&quot; takes the short form. Participles are often difficult to distinguish from deverbal adjectives (this is important for some cases of orthography).

==== Active present participle ====
Лю́ди, живу́щие в э́том го́роде, о́чень до́брые и отве́тственные – The people living in this city are very kind and responsible.

In order to form the active present participle, the &quot;т&quot; of the 3rd person plural of the present tense is replaced by &quot;щ&quot;, and a necessary adjective ending is added:


Note: Only imperfective verbs can have an active present participle.

(*) Note: These forms are obsolete in modern Russian and they are not used in the spoken language as forms of the verb &#x27;to be&#x27;.

===== Reflexive verbs paradigm =====

The participle agrees in gender, case and number with the word it refers to:
:Я посвяща́ю э́ту пе́сню лю́дям, живу́щим в на́шем го́роде – I dedicate this song to the people living in our city.
:Я горжу́сь людьми́, живу́щими в на́шем го́роде – I&#x27;m proud of the people living in our city.

==== Active past participle ====

The active past participle is used in order to indicate actions that happened in the past:
:Де́вушка, чита́вшая тут кни́гу, забы́ла свой телефо́н – The girl that read this book here forgot her phone (the girl read the book in the past).

Compare:
:Де́вушка, чита́ющая тут кни́гу, – моя́ сестра́ – The girl reading this book here is my sister (she is reading the book now, in the present).

In order to form the active past participle, the infinitive ending &#x27;-ть&#x27; is replaced by the suffix &#x27;-вш-&#x27; and add an adjective ending:



===== Reflexive verbs paradigm =====

==== Passive present participle ====

:обсужда́ть – to discuss;
:обсужда́емый (full form), обсужда́ем (short form) – being discussed &quot;or&quot; able to be discussed;

In order to form the passive present participle it is necessary to add an adjective ending to the 1st person plural of the present tense:



Passive participles are occasional in modern Russian. Often, same meaning is conveyed by reflexive active present participles:

:рису́ющийся (self-drawing) instead of рису́емый (being drawn, drawable);
:мо́ющийся (self-washing) instead of мо́емый (being washed);

The forms ending in -омый are mostly obsolete. Only the forms ведо́мый (from вести́ – to lead) and иско́мый (from иска́ть – to search, to look for) are used in the spoken language as adjectives:

:ведо́мый челове́к – a slave (driven, following) man;
:иско́мая величина́ – the sought quantity.

==== Passive past participle ====
:сде́лать – to do/to make (perfective verb)
:сде́ланный – done/made

Passive past participles are formed by means of the suffixes &#x27;-нн-&#x27; or &#x27;-т-&#x27; from the infinitive stem of perfective verbs. Besides that, this kind of participle can have short forms formed by means of the suffixes &#x27;-н-&#x27; or &#x27;-т-&#x27;:



=== Adverbial participle ===
Adverbial participles (деепричастия) express an earlier or simultaneous action providing context for the sentence in which they occur, similar to the English constructions &quot;having done X&quot; or &quot;while doing Y&quot;.

Like normal adverbs, adverbial participles are not declined. They inherit the aspect of their verb; imperfective ones are usually present, while perfective ones can only be past (since they denote action performed by the subject, the tense corresponds to the time of action denoted by the verb). Adverbial participles are usually active, but passive constructions may be formed using adverbial participle forms of the verb (present &quot;будучи&quot; &quot;being&quot;, very rarely past &quot;бывши&quot; &quot;having been&quot;); these may be combined with either an adjectival participle in the instrumental case (Будучи , боец оставался в строю – Being wounded, the combatant remained in the row), or a short adjective in the nominative (Бывши один раз наказан, он больше так не делал – Having been punished once, he didn&#x27;t do it any more).

Present adverbial participles are formed by adding the suffix -а/-я (or sometimes -учи/-ючи, which is usually deprecated) to the stem of the present tense. A few past adverbial participles (mainly of intransitive verbs of motion) are formed in the same way, but most are formed with the suffix -в (alternative form -вши, always used before -сь), some whose stem ends with a consonant, with -ши. For reflexive verbs, the suffix -сь remains at the very end of the word; in poetry it can take the form -ся.

In standard Russian, adverbial participles are considered a feature of bookish speech; in colloquial language they are usually replaced with single adjectival participles or constructions with verbs: Пообедав, я пошёл гулять (&quot;Having eaten, I went for a walk&quot;) → Я пообедал и пошёл гулять (&quot;I ate and went for a walk&quot;). But in some conservative dialects, adverbial and adjectival participles may be used to produce perfect forms, which do not occur in standard Russian; e.g. &quot;I haven&#x27;t eaten today&quot; will be &quot;Я сегодня не евши&quot; instead of &quot;Я сегодня не ел&quot;.

=== Irregular verbs ===

1These verbs all have a stem change.
2These verbs are palatalised in certain cases, namely с → ш for all the present forms of &quot;писа́ть&quot;, and д → ж in the first person singular of the other verbs.
3These verbs do not conform to either the first or second conjugations.

== Word formation ==

Russian has on hand a set of prefixes, prepositional and adverbial in nature, as well as diminutive, augmentative, and frequentative suffixes. All of these can be stacked one upon the other to produce multiple derivatives of a given word. Participles and other inflectional forms may also have a special connotation. For example:

Russian has also proven friendly to long compounds. As an extreme case:

Purists (as Dmitry Ushakov in the preface to his dictionary) frown on such words. Some linguists have suggested that Russian compounding stems from Church Slavonic. In the twentieth century, &quot;abbreviated&quot; components frequently appeared in compounds:

== Syntax ==
Basic word order, both in conversation and written language, is subject–verb–object. However, because grammatical relationships are marked by inflection, considerable latitude in word order is allowed, and all possible permutations can be used. For example, the words in the phrase &quot;я пошёл в магазин&quot; (&#x27;I went to the shop&#x27;) can be arranged:
* Я пошёл в магазин. (I went to the shop; &quot;I went to the shop.&quot;)
* Я в магазин пошёл. (I to the shop went; approx. &quot;I am going out, my destination is the shop.&quot;)
* Пошёл я в магазин. (Went I to the shop; two meanings: can be treated as a beginning of a narrated story: &quot;Went I to the shop, and something happened.&quot; or a decision made by someone after a long contemplation: &quot;OK, I think I will go the shop.&quot;)
* Пошёл в магазин я. (Went to the shop I; rarely used, can be treated as a beginning of a line of a poem written in amphibrach due to uncommon word order, or when the speaker wants to highlight that exactly this subject &quot;went to the shop&quot;. In that case, the subject is stressed)
* В магазин я пошёл. (To the shop I went; two meanings: can be used as a response: &quot;I went to the shop.&quot; – &quot;Sorry, where did you go?&quot; – &quot;To the shop—that&#x27;s where I went.&quot; or an emphasis on the way of transportation: &quot;I went to the shop on foot.&quot;)
* В магазин пошёл я. (To the shop went I; &quot;It was me who went to the shop.&quot;)
while maintaining grammatical correctness. Note, however, that the order of the phrase &quot;в магазин&quot; (&quot;to the shop&quot;) is kept constant.

Word order can express logical stress, and degree of definiteness. The primary emphasis tends to be initial, with a weaker emphasis at the end. Some of these arrangements can describe present actions, not only past (despite the fact that the verb &quot;пошёл&quot; is in the past).

In some cases, alternative word order can change the meaning entirely:
* Не надо меня уговаривать. (&quot;No need me [to] persuade&quot; → One should not persuade me [&quot;as I would never agree to do something&quot;].)
* Меня не надо уговаривать. (&quot;Me no need [to] persuade&quot; → There is no need to persuade me [&quot;as I will do it anyway&quot;].)

=== Impersonal sentences ===
Russian is a null-subject language – it allows constructing sentences without subject (). Some of them are claimed to not be impersonal, but to have oblique subject. One possible classification of such sentences distinguishes:
; Subjectless impersonals contain an impersonal verb (in form of single third-person or single neutral), and no other word is used as a subject:Смеркалось. &#x27;(It got) dusky.&#x27;
: В Москве полночь. &#x27;(It&#x27;s) midnight in Moscow.&#x27;
; Dative impersonals usually express personal feelings, where experiencer in dative case can possibly be considered as subject:Мне скучно. &#x27;I&#x27;m bored.&#x27;
; Other impersonals have an element which is neither nominative nor dative, but still is a nominal verb argument:Меня тошнит. &#x27;I feel sick.&#x27;
: Васю ударило током. &#x27;Vasya had an electric shock.&#x27;

=== Negation ===
==== Multiple Negatives ====
Unlike in standard English, multiple negatives are compulsory in Russian, as in &quot;никто никогда никому ничего не прощает&quot; (&#x27;No-one ever forgives anyone for anything&#x27; literally, &quot;no one never to no-one nothing does not forgive&quot;). Usually, only one word in a sentence has negative particle or prefix &quot;не&quot; or belongs to negative word &quot;нет&quot;, while another word has negation-affirmative particle or prefix &quot;ни&quot;; but this word can often be omitted, and thus ни becomes the signal of negation: &quot;вокруг никого нет&quot; and &quot;вокруг никого&quot; both mean &quot;there is nobody around&quot;.

==== Adverbial answers ====
As a one-word answer to an &quot;affirmative&quot; sentence, &quot;yes&quot; translates да and &quot;no&quot; translates нет, as shown by the table below. 

No simple rule supplies an adverbial answer to a negative sentence. B. Comrie says that in Russian answer да or нет is determined not so much by the negative form of the question as by the questioner&#x27;s intent for using negation, or whether the response is in agreement with his &quot;presupposition.&quot; In many cases that means that the adverbial answer should be extended for avoiding ambiguity; in spoken language, intonation in saying нет can also be significant to if it is affirmation of negation or negation of negation.
Note that while expressing an affirmation of negation by extending &quot;да&quot; with a negated verb is grammatically acceptable. In practice it is more common to answer &quot;нет&quot; and subsequently extend with a negated verb paralleling the usage in English. Answering a negative sentence with a non-extended &quot;нет&quot; is usually interpreted as an affirmation of negation again in a way similar to English.

Alternatively, both positive and negative simple questions can be answered by repeating the predicate with or without не, especially if да/нет is ambiguous: in the latest example, &quot;сержусь&quot; or &quot;не сержусь&quot;.
=== Coordination ===
The most common types of coordination expressed by compound sentences in Russian are conjoining, oppositional, and separative. Additionally, the Russian grammar considers comparative, complemental, and clarifying. Other flavors of meaning may also be distinguished.

Conjoining coordinations are formed with the help of the conjunctions и &quot;and&quot;, ни … ни (&quot;not … not&quot; — simultaneous negation), та́кже &quot;also&quot;, то́же (&quot;too&quot;; the latter two have complementary flavors), etc. Most commonly the conjoining coordination expresses enumeration, or immediate sequence. They may also have a cause-effect flavor.

Oppositional coordinations are formed with the help of the oppositional conjunctions: а &quot;and&quot;~&quot;but&quot;, но &quot;but&quot;, одна́ко &quot;however&quot;, зато́ &quot;on the other hand&quot;, же &quot;and&quot;~&quot;but&quot;, etc. They express the semantic relations of opposition, comparison, incompatibility, restriction, or compensation.

Separative coordinations are formed with the help of the separative conjunctions: и́ли &quot;or&quot;, ли́бо &quot;either&quot;, ли … ли &quot;whether … or&quot;, то … то &quot;then … then&quot;, etc. They express alternation or incompatibility of things expressed in the coordinated sentences.

Complemental and clarifying coordination expresses additional, but not subordinated, information related to the first sentence.

Comparative coordination is a semantic flavor of the oppositional one.

Common coordinating conjunctions include:
* и &quot;and&quot;, enumerative, complemental;
* а &quot;and&quot;, comparative, tending to &quot;but&quot; or &quot;while&quot;;
* но &quot;but&quot;, oppositional.

The distinction between &quot;и&quot; and &quot;а&quot; is important:
*&quot;и&quot; implies a following complemental state that does not oppose the antecedent;
*&quot;а&quot; implies a following state that acts in opposition to the antecedent, but more weakly than &quot;но&quot; (&quot;but&quot;).


The distinction between &quot;и&quot; and &quot;а&quot; developed after medieval times. Originally, &quot;и&quot; and &quot;а&quot; were closer in meaning. The unpunctuated ending of the Song of Igor illustrates the potential confusion. The final five words in modern spelling, &quot;князьям слава а дружине аминь&quot; can be understood either as &quot;Glory to the princes and to their retinue! Amen.&quot; or &quot;Glory to the princes, and amen (R.I.P.) to their retinue&quot;. Although the majority opinion is definitely with the first interpretation, no consensus has formed. The psychological difference between the two is quite obvious.

=== Subordination ===
Complementizers (subordinating conjunctions, adverbs, or adverbial phrases) include:
* если &#x27;if&#x27; (meaning &#x27;in case where&#x27; not meaning &#x27;whether&#x27;);
* потому что &#x27;because&#x27;
* так как &#x27;since&#x27; (meaning &#x27;for the reason that&#x27;)
* чтобы , дабы (bookish, archaic) &#x27;so that&#x27;
* после того, как &#x27;after&#x27;
* хотя &#x27;although&#x27;

In general, Russian has fewer subordinate clauses than English, because the participles and adverbial participles often take the place of a relative pronoun/verb combination. For example:

=== Absolute construction ===
Despite the inflectional nature of Russian, there is no equivalent in modern Russian to the English nominative absolute or the Latin ablative absolute construction. The old language had an absolute construction, with the noun in the dative. Like so many other archaisms, it is retained in Church Slavonic. Among the last known examples in literary Russian occurs in Radishchev&#x27;s &quot;Journey from Petersburg to Moscow&quot; (&quot;Путешествие из Петербурга в Москву&quot; ), 1790:
: Едущу мне из Едрова, Анюта из мысли моей не выходила. &quot;As I was leaving Yedrovo village, I could not stop thinking about Aniuta.&quot;

<text>Mealybugs are insects in the family Pseudococcidae, unarmored scale insects found in moist, warm habitats. Of the more than 2,000 described species, many are considered pests as they feed on plant juices of greenhouse plants, house plants and subtropical trees and also act as a vector for several plant diseases. Some ants live in symbiotic relationships with them, protecting them from predators and feeding off the honeydew which they excrete.

==Description==

Mealybugs are sexually dimorphic: females appear as nymphs, exhibiting reduced morphology, and lack wings, although unlike many female scale insects, they often retain legs and can move. Males are smaller, gnat-like and have wings. Since mealybugs, as well as all other Hemiptera, are hemimetabolous insects, they do not undergo complete metamorphosis in the true sense of the word. However, male mealybugs exhibit a radical change during their life cycle, changing from wingless, ovoid nymphs to wasp-like flying adults.

Mealybug females feed on plant sap, normally in roots or other crevices, and in a few cases the bottoms of stored fruit. They attach themselves to the plant and secrete a powdery wax layer (hence the name &quot;mealy&quot; bug) used for protection while they suck the plant juices. The males are short-lived, as they do not feed at all as adults and only live to fertilize the females. Male citrus mealy bugs fly to the females and resemble fluffy gnats.

Some species of mealybug lay their eggs in the same waxy layer used for protection in quantities of 50–100; other species are born directly from the female.

The most serious pests are mealybugs that feed on citrus. Other species damage sugarcane, grapes, pineapple (Jahn et al. 2003), coffee trees, cassava, ferns, cacti, gardenias, papaya, mulberry, sunflower and orchids. Mealybugs only tend to be serious pests in the presence of ants because the ants protect them from predators and parasites. Mealybugs are also a vector of viruses in grapevines, spreading grapevine leafroll and grapevine red blotch viruses. 

Mealybugs also infest some species of carnivorous plant such as &quot;Sarracenia&quot; (pitcher plants). In such cases it is difficult to eradicate them without repeated applications of insecticide such as diazinon. Small infestations may not inflict significant damage. In larger amounts though, they can induce leaf drop. In recent years, some of the mealybug species have become invasive pests in localities posing a great problem to the new agro-ecosystems. In India, &quot;Withania somnifera&quot; plant have been reported as a new reservoir host for an invasive mealybug species &quot;Phenacoccus solenopsis&quot;.

Some mealybugs of the &quot;Hypogeococcus&quot; are used as biological pest controls of invasive cacti in South Africa, including &quot;Harrisia balansae&quot;, &quot;H. martinii&quot;, and &quot;Opuntia cespitosa&quot;.

Fossil specimens of genus &quot;Acropyga&quot; ants have been recovered from the Burdigalian stage Dominican amber deposits and several individuals are preserved carrying the extinct mealybug genus &quot;Electromyrmococcus&quot;. These fossils represent the oldest record of the symbiosis between mealybugs and &quot;Acropyga&quot; species ants.

==Control methods==
Insecticides such as pyrethroids (&quot;e.g.&quot; permethrin, bifenthrin, cyfluthrin) have been used for control, but this approach is often considered counter-productive due to mortality of mealybug natural enemies.

Some gardeners use species of predatory beetles (&quot;e.g. Cryptolaemus&quot;) and green lacewings (Chrysopidae) larvae to control mealybug infestations, as the larval lacewings are voracious predators of aphids and other small insects.

==Metabolism==
Mealybugs have a highly sophisticated metabolism that involves not one but two bacterial endosymbionts, one inside the other. The endosymbionts make essential amino acids that the mealybug is not able to acquire directly from its diet. Genetically, mealybugs rely on a &quot;mosaic&quot; of metabolic pathways in which proteins are transported across membranes between what were once independent organisms.

==Use in the textile industry== 

In Oaxaca, Mexico, where mealybugs are known as cochinilla algodonosa, the insects are intentionally cultivated and farmed. Dried mealybugs are ground into a dust, producing a red dye is used to colour fabrics, in artist&#x27;s paints, and in cosmetics.

Note that while cochineal beetles are commonly called mealybugs, and they share a very similar physical appearance and size, mealybugs (Pseudococcidae) are in a different family to cochineal beetles (Dactylopiidae), of which there are several species.

<text>The State of India ( ), also known as the Portuguese State of India (, EPI) or Portuguese India (), was a state of the Portuguese Empire founded six years after the discovery of the sea route to the Indian subcontinent by Vasco da Gama, a subject of the Kingdom of Portugal. The capital of Portuguese India served as the governing centre of a string of military forts and maritime ports scattered along the coasts of the Indian Ocean.

The first viceroy Francisco de Almeida established his base of operations at Fort Manuel in the Malabar region, after the Kingdom of Cochin negotiated to become a protectorate of Portugal in 1505. With the Portuguese conquest of Goa from the Bijapur Sultanate in 1510, Goa became the major anchorage for the Armadas arriving in India. The capital of the viceroyalty was transferred from Cochin to Goa in 1530. From 1535, Mumbai (Bombay) was a harbour of Portuguese India, known as &quot;Bom Bahia&quot;, until it was handed over, through the dowry of Catherine de Braganza to Charles II of England in 1661. The expression &quot;State of India&quot; began regularly appearing in documents in the mid-16th century. 

Until the 18th century, the viceroy in Goa had authority over all Portuguese possessions in and around the Indian Ocean, from Southern Africa to Southeast Asia. In 1752, Mozambique got its own separate government; from 1844 on, Portuguese Goa stopped administering Macao, Solor and Timor. Despite this, the viceroy at Goa only controlled limited portions of the Portuguese settlements in the east; some settlements remained informal private affairs, without a captain or &quot;câmara&quot; (municipal council). By the end of the 18th century, most of these unofficial colonies were abandoned by Portugal, due to heavy competition from European and Indian rivals.

In later years, Portugal&#x27;s authority was confined to holdings in the Canara, Cambay and Konkan regions along the west coast of India. At the time of the dissolution of the British Raj in 1947, Portuguese India comprised three administrative divisions, sometimes referred to collectively as &quot;Goa&quot;: Goa which included Anjediva and Damaon, which included the exclaves of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Dio districts. The Salazar regime of Portugal lost de facto control of Dadra and Nagar Haveli in 1954. Finally, the rest of the overseas territory was lost in December 1961 with the Indian Annexation of Goa under PM Nehru. Portugal only recognised Indian control after the Carnation Revolution and the fall of the Estado Novo regime in a treaty signed on 31 December 1974.

== Context ==

=== Vasco da Gama lands in India ===
The first Portuguese encounter with the subcontinent was on 20 May 1498, when Vasco da Gama reached Calicut on the Malabar Coast. Anchored off the coast of Calicut, the Portuguese invited native fishermen on board and bought some Indian items. One Portuguese accompanied the fishermen to the port and met with a Tunisian Muslim. On the advice of this man, Gama sent a couple of his men to Ponnani to meet with the ruler of Calicut, the Zamorin. Over the objections of Arab merchants, Gama managed to secure a letter of concession for trading rights from the Zamorin, but the Portuguese were unable to pay the prescribed customs duties and price of his goods in gold.

Later Calicut officials temporarily detained Gama&#x27;s Portuguese agents as security for payment. This annoyed Gama, who carried off a few natives and sixteen fishermen with him by force.

Nevertheless, Gama&#x27;s expedition was successful beyond all reasonable expectations, bringing in cargo worth sixty times the cost of the expedition.

=== Pedro Álvares Cabral ===
Pedro Álvares Cabral sailed to India, marking the arrival of Europeans to Brazil on the way, to trade for black pepper and other spices, negotiating and establishing a factory at Kozhikode, where he arrived on 13 September 1500. Matters worsened when the Portuguese factory at Kozhikode was ambushed by the locals, resulting in the deaths of more than fifty Portuguese. Cabral was outraged by the attack on the factory and seized ten Arab merchant ships anchored in the harbor, killing about six hundred of their crew, confiscating their cargo and promptly burning the ships. Cabral also ordered his ships to bombard Calicut for an entire day in retaliation for the violation of the agreement. Additionally, Cabral succeeded in making advantageous treaties with local rulers in Cochin and Cannanore. Cabral started the return voyage on 16 January 1501 and arrived in Portugal with only 4 of the 13 ships on 23 June 1501.

In 1502, the Portuguese built a trading post in Pulicat because its location at the mouth of a lagoon made it a great natural harbor.

===João da Nova===

The third Portuguese expedition to reach India sailed under the command of João da Nova and was composed of four ships, tasked mainly with acquiring spices and returning to Europe. While en route, the fleet discovered the islands of Ascension and Saint Helena in the South Atlantic, and despite it having been planned as a purely commercial expedition, the fleet clashed with vessels of the Zamorin of Calicut off the Malabar Coast at the First Battle of Cannanore, the first significant naval battle of Portuguese India.

The fleet may also have called at Ceylon.

===Vasco da Gama===

Vasco da Gama sailed to India for the second time with 15 ships and 800 men, arriving at Calicut on 30 October 1502. Gama this time made a call to expel all Muslims from Calicut which was turned down. The ruler showed willingness to sign a treaty, but Gama bombarded the city and captured several rice vessels after he was informed that the Zamorin was messaging neighbouring rulers to join him in resisting the Portuguese at the same time. 
While in India, Gama also attacked Onor, reduced Baticala to tributary status, established a trade treaty and trading post at Cananore, and clashed with a fleet belonging to the Zamorin at the Battle of Calicut of 1503. He returned to Portugal in September 1503.

===Afonso de Albuquerque===

The expedition of 1503 was the first time Afonso de Albuquerque sailed to India, as its commander. Its activities were limited to erecting a fort on the territory of the allied kingdom of Cochin, signing a peace with Zamorin that would prove brief, and opening a new trading post at Kollam.

===Lopo Soares de Albergaria===

The sixth Portuguese expedition to India was commanded by Lopo Soares de Albergaria, who bombarded Calicut, relieved Duarte Pacheco Pereira and the Portuguese garrison at Cochin defending the territory from a large attack by the Zamorin at the Battle of Cochin, sacked Cranganore, struck an allegiance with the king of Tanur which removed him from the suzerainty of the Zamorin, and finally captured a large Egyptian trade fleet at the Battle of Pandarane.

== Foundation (1505–1515) ==
=== Francisco de Almeida ===
On 25 March 1505, Francisco de Almeida was appointed &quot;Viceroy of India&quot;, on the condition that he would set up four forts on the southwestern Indian coast: Anjediva, Cannanore, Cochin and Quilon. Francisco de Almeida left Portugal with a fleet of 22 vessels with 1,500 men.

On 13 September, Francisco de Almeida reached Anjadip Island, where he started the construction of Fort Anjediva. On 23 October, with the permission of the friendly ruler of Kōlattir, he started building Fort St Angelo of Cannanore, leaving Lourenço de Brito in charge with 150 men and two ships.

On 31 October 1505, Francisco de Almeida reached Cochin with only 8 vessels left. There, he learned that the Portuguese traders at Quilon had been killed. He decided to send his son Lourenço de Almeida with 6 ships, who destroyed 27 Calicut vessels in the harbour of Quilon. Almeida took up residence in Cochin and strengthened Fort Manuel.

The Zamorin prepared a fleet of 200 ships to oppose the Portuguese, but in March 1506, Lourenço de Almeida (son of Francisco) was victorious in a sea battle at the entrance to the harbour, in the Battle of Cannanore (1506), an important setback for the fleet of the Zamorin. Lourenço de Almeida explored the coastal waters southwards to Colombo, in what is now Sri Lanka. In Cannanore, a new ruler, hostile to the Portuguese and friendly with the Zamorin, attacked the Portuguese garrison, leading to the Siege of Cannanore.

In 1507 Almeida&#x27;s mission was strengthened by the arrival of Tristão da Cunha&#x27;s squadron. Afonso de Albuquerque&#x27;s squadron had split from that of Cunha off East Africa and was independently conquering territories in the Persian Gulf to the west.

In March 1508, a Portuguese squadron under the command of Lourenço de Almeida was attacked by a combined Mameluk Egyptian and Gujarat Sultanate fleet at Chaul and Dabul respectively, led by admirals Mirocem and Meliqueaz in the Battle of Chaul. Lourenço de Almeida died after a fierce fight in this battle. Mamluk-Indian resistance was decisively defeated at the Battle of Diu in 1509.

=== Afonso de Albuquerque ===

In 1509, Afonso de Albuquerque was appointed the second governor of Portuguese possessions in the East. After acquiring their first protectorate in Portuguese Cochin, a new fleet under Marshal Fernão Coutinho arrived with specific instructions to destroy the power of Zamorin of Calicut. Zamorin&#x27;s palace was captured and destroyed, and the city was set on fire. Zamorin&#x27;s forces rallied, killing Coutinho and wounding Albuquerque. Albuquerque withdrew with his forces, and after Zamorin was assassinated in 1513, he entered into agreement with his successor to protect Portuguese interests in Malabar, and a fort was built on Calicut.

In 1510, Afonso de Albuquerque captured Goa from the Bijapur Sultanate sultan with the aid of the Hindu privateer Timoja, leading to the establishment of a permanent settlement in the city of &quot;Velha Goa&quot; (Old Goa in English). Goa (island) bore the seat of the viceroy, who governed all the possessions in Asia.

Albuquerque added to the State of India the cities of Malacca in 1511 and Ormus in 1515. He encouraged the settlement of his soldiers and their marriage to native women. In the mid-16th century, there were about 2000 &quot;casados&quot; (&quot;married men&quot;) in Goa. Goa included a large body of native non-Portuguese inhabitants for the Portuguese crown to rule. To better achieve this, Albuquerque resorted to medieval Iberian procedures: people of different religious communities were allowed to live by their laws under representatives of their respective communities. Exception was made to the practice of sati, which was abolished. Certain taxes due to the Adil Shah of Bijapur were also abolished. Native women were legally allowed property rights for the first time. At Goa, Albuquerque instituted an orphan&#x27;s fund and opened a hospital, the &quot;Hospital Real de Goa&quot;, modelled after the grand Hospital Real de Todos os Santos in Lisbon. Also at Goa were built smaller hospitals run by the city&#x27;s charity, the &quot;Misericórdia&quot;, dedicated to serving the poor and the natives.

Albuquerque&#x27;s policies proved immensely popular amongst his soldiers as well as the local population, especially his characteristically strict observance of justice. When Albuquerque died in sight of Goa in 1515, even the Hindu natives of Goa mourned his passing alongside the Portuguese. His tomb at the &quot;Nossa Senhora da Serra&quot; hermitage was converted to a shrine by the local Hindus, who would leave flowers there in his dedication and direct prayers to him, seeking aid in matters of justice, until his remains were returned to Portugal in 1566.

The Portuguese had also shipped &quot;Órfãs do Rei&quot; to their colonies in the Indian peninsula, the most important of which were the eastern metropole of Goa and the largest province in Bombay-Bassein. &quot;Órfãs do Rei&quot; (literally &quot;Orphans of the King&quot;) were orphaned Portuguese girls patronised by the King, and sent to overseas colonies to form marital alliances with either Portuguese settlers or natives of high status.

== 16th to 17th century==

In 1520, the Portuguese extended their dominion over the town of Rachol, when Krishnadevaraya captured the Rachol Fort and delivered it to the Portuguese, in exchange for a mutual defence pact against the Deccan Sultanates.

In 1526, John III of Portugal granted the city of Goa and its town hall the same legal status as Lisbon, in a foral in which the general laws and privileges of the city, its town hall, and the local Hindu community were detailed – especially important since at the time the native laws of Goa were still not written, instead being handled by councils of elders or religious judges and passed down orally.

There were Portuguese settlements in and around the Coromandel region. The Luz Church in the Mylapore neighbourhood of Madras (Chennai) was the first church that the Portuguese built in the area in 1516; the &quot;São Tomé&quot; or &quot;San Thome&quot; shrine was rebuilt by them in 1522. They also built the first structures at the Basilica of Our Lady of the Mount, Bandra, the Our Lady of Velankanni shrine and the Cathedral of Our Lady of Miracles, which are among the important Christian pilgrimage sites of South Asia.
Several colonies were also acquired from the Sultan of Guzerat in the north Konkan region: Daman was sacked in 1531 and ceded in 1539; Salsette, the seven islands of Bombay, Chaul and Bassein (Vasai) in 1534; and Diu, in 1535. These would jointly come to be known as the Northern Province of Portuguese India. It extended almost along the west coast from Daman to Chaul and in some places inland. The territory (province) of Portuguese Bombay had its city centre in and around the Bassein Fort; subject to the viceroy in the capital (metropole) of &quot;Velha Goa&quot; in south Konkan country, along with other colonies in the Indian subcontinent, such as Portuguese Ceylon and Portuguese Chittagong.

The Ottoman Empire carried out the Siege of Diu in 1538, with a strong fleet under the command of the Ottoman governor of Egypt Sulaiman Pasha for four months, with the aid of a large army provided by the Sultan of Guzerat; however they were ultimately forced to retreat with considerable losses. The successful defence of Dio by captain António da Silveira against overwhelming odds was a battle of annihilation, is one of the most celebrated exploits in Portuguese history, and frequently compared to the Great Siege of Malta. On the occasion, the Portuguese captured the Tiro de Diu, a massive Guzerati bombard.

According to Portuguese records, there was a cholera epidemic in 1543, &quot;It is said that deaths from the disposal of the disease were so numerous that the disposal of bodies was a formidable task&quot;

On 16 May 1546, the Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier requested the institution of the Goa Inquisition for the &quot;Old Christians&quot; and &quot;New Christians&quot; in a letter to John III of Portugal. Non-Christians were officially oppressed, even before the Inquisition was set up. Francis Xavier was instrumental in a mass conversion of 30,000 Paravar fishermen at Cape Comorin. In this year, the Portuguese fortress of Diu was sieged a second time by a Gujarati army led by the lord of Surat Khoja Zufar.

In 1556, the printing press in Goa was the first installed in India at Saint Paul&#x27;s College, Goa. Through publications made on the press, he opened a window on the knowledge and customs of Europe. The Jesuits brought this European-style, metal movable type technology to Macao in China in 1588 and to Japan in 1590. 

By the start of the 17th century, the population of Goa and the surrounding areas was about 250,000. Holding this strategic land against repeated attacks by the Indian states required constant infusions of men and material. Portugal&#x27;s important victories, such as the battle of Cochin in 1504, the defence of Diu in 1509, the conquest of Goa in 1510, the defences of Diu in 1538 and 1546, and the defence of Goa in 1571 were accomplished with limited manpower. In their largest deployments, the Portuguese could field perhaps 2,000 to 3,000 European and mestiço troops supported by a similar amount of local auxiliaries, while the larger Indian states could field tens of thousands each. Portuguese superiority in military technology (especially in ships and artillery), training (especially in the skill of their gunners), and tactics, combined with the disunity of the Indian states opposing them, allowed them to keep their position and consistently win their wars.

== 17th to 20th century==


===17th century===
The seven islands of Bombay were presented to the English Crown in 1661, as part of the dowry of Catherine Braganza to Charles II of England, who in turn leased the area to the English East India Company.

In 1683, the Marathas attempted a siege against Portuguese settlements in the Konkan region, but with no success.


Kollam (Quilon) was a prominent seaport and became a Portuguese settlement in 1519. They built a cemetery at Tangasseri in Quilon city. After the Dutch East India Company invasion, the Dutch also buried their dead there. The pirates of Tangasseri inhabited the cemetery before Europeans arrived. Remnants of this cemetery still exist today, very close to Tangasseri Lighthouse and St Thomas Fort, which are listed among the protected monuments in the Archaeological Survey of India.

===18th century===

Most of the Northern Province, composed of Taana, Bassein (Vasai) and Chaul near British Bombay was lost following another Mahratta Invasion of Bassein in 1739. Goa, Daman and Diu as well as Anjediva, were retained because a fleet of Portuguese Armadas arrived from Lisbon, bearing a newly appointed viceroy.

In 1752, Mozambique was detached from the State of India and henceforth ruled by its own governor.

In the aftermath of the battles and the losses, the Portuguese expanded the territory of Goa between 1763 and 1788, at the expense of the Dessais of Kudal, the Sondas, and the Bhonslas/ Mahrattas of Silvassa, which became known as the &quot;Novas Conquistas&quot;. By order of the Marquis de Pombal, the Jesuits were expelled from Portugal&#x27;s territories in 1759. They were replaced by the Oratorians, a native Goan Catholic religious order founded by Christian Brahmin and Christian Kshatriya converts; a college dedicated to the secular education of the native elites was opened; and the Goan Inquisition was abolished. Under the influence of Pombal, King José declared that native Christians were equal in standing with Europeans, while the Viceroy Count of Ega declared religious freedom and prohibited racial slander. For these reasons, &quot;Pombal and his collaborators remain, to this day, much respected figures in Goa&quot; 

In 1783, following an attack on the Portuguese ship Santana, the Marathas handed over control of the territories of Dadrá and Nagar Áveli. The Portuguese then purchased Dadrá in 1785. By 1818, the Portuguese were the undisputed rulers of Nagar Áveli after the dissolution of the Maratha Confederacy.

The Conspiracy of the Pintos, also known as the Pinto Revolt, was a rebellion against Portuguese rule in Goa in 1787. The leaders of the plot were three prominent priests from the village of Candolim in the &quot;concelho&quot; of Bardez. They belonged to the noble Roman Catholic Brahmin Pinto clan, hence the name of the rebellion. This was the first anti-colonial revolt in India and one of the first by Catholic subjects in all European colonies.

===19th century===

Military intelligence about France&#x27;s plan to occupy Goa caused the British Governor-general at Calcutta, the Marquis of Wellesley to send troops. Goa was briefly a British Protectorate from 1799 to 1813. The Portuguese governor Francisco António da Veiga Cabral managed to retain control of civil institutions by formally appointing the British officer in charge of the occupation, Sir William Clarke, as commander of Portuguese troops in Goa under his authority.

In 1843, the capital was moved to Panjim (&quot;Nova Goa&quot; or New Goa), when it officially became the administrative seat of the &quot;Estado&quot;, replacing the city of Velha Goa (Old Goa), although the viceroys had taken residence there already since 1 December 1759. In 1844, the Portuguese governor of India stopped administering the territories of Macão, Solór, and Timór. Only then was the territory of the State of India confined to the Indian subcontinent itself.

===Second World War===
Portugal was neutral during the Second World War. As a result, at the outbreak of hostilities, Axis ships sought refuge in Goa rather than be sunk or captured by the British Royal Navy. Three German merchant ships, the &quot;Ehrenfels&quot;, the &quot;Drachenfels&quot; and the &quot;Braunfels&quot;, as well as an Italian ship, took refuge in the port of Mormugao. The &quot;Ehrenfels&quot; began transmitting Allied ship movements to the U-boats operating in the Indian Ocean, an action that was extremely damaging to Allied shipping.

The British Royal Navy was unable to take any official action against these ships because of Goa&#x27;s stated neutrality. Instead the Indian mission of Special Operations Executive backed a covert raid using members from the Calcutta Light Horse, a part-time unit made up of civilians who were not eligible for normal war service. The Light Horse embarked on an ancient Calcutta riverboat, the &quot;Phoebe&quot;, and sailed around India to Goa, where they sank the &quot;Ehrenfels&quot;. The British then sent an unencrypted radio message announcing it was going to seize the territory. This bluff made the other Axis crews scuttle their ships fearing they could be seized by British forces.

The raid was described in the book &quot;Boarding Party&quot; by James Leasor. Due to the potential political ramifications of the fact that Britain had violated Portuguese neutrality, the raid remained secret until the book was published in 1978. In 1980 the story was made into the film, &quot;The Sea Wolves&quot;, starring Gregory Peck, David Niven and Roger Moore.

===1945 to 1961===
On 24 July 1954 an organisation called &quot;The United Front of Goans&quot; took control of the enclave of Dadra. Nagar Haveli was seized by Azad Gomantak Dal on 2 August 1954. The International Court of Justice at The Hague delivered an &quot;impasse&quot; verdict, regarding access to Dadra and Nagar Haveli by Portugal.

From 1954, the &quot;satyagrahis&quot; (peaceful protesters) against Portuguese rule, outside Goa were violently suppressed through brute force. Many internal revolts were quelled and leaders extrajudicially murdered or jailed. As a result, India broke off diplomatic relations with Portugal, closed its consulate-general in Panjim and demanded that Portugal must close its delegation in New Delhi. India also imposed an economic embargo against the territories of Portuguese Goa. The Indian Government adopted a diplomatic &quot;wait and watch&quot; approach from 1955 to 1961 with numerous representations to the Portuguese Salazar dictatorship, and made attempts to highlight the issue of decolonisation before the international community.

To facilitate the transport of people and goods to and from the Indian enclaves, the Salazar dictatorship established an airline, Transportes Aéreos da Índia Portuguesa, and airports at Goa, Daman and Diu.

In December 1961, India invaded the remaining Portuguese possessions. Portuguese forces had been given orders to either defeat the invaders or die. The Governor of Portuguese India signed the Instrument of Surrender on 19 December 1961, thus ending 450 years of Portuguese rule in India.

== Post-annexation ==
=== Status of the new territories ===
Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli existed as a &quot;de facto&quot; independent entity from its independence in 1954 until its merger with the Republic of India in 1961.

Following the annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Goa, Daman and Diu became new territories of the Indian Union. Maj Gen K P Candeth was declared as military governor of Goa, Daman and Diu. Goa&#x27;s first legislative elections were held in 1963.

In 1967 a referendum was conducted after activists led by Jack Sequeira proposed it, where voters would decide whether to merge Goa into the Marathi-majority state of Maharashtra, the pro-Konkani faction eventually won after protests against the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, led by Dayanand Bandodkar. However full statehood was not conferred immediately, and it was only on 30 May 1987 that Goa became the 25th state of the Indian Union, with Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu districts were partitioned, and continue to be administered as the Daman, Diu and Silvassa territory.

The most drastic changes in Portuguese India after 1961 were the introduction of democratic elections, as well as the replacement of Portuguese with English as the general language of government and education. Following many years of Konkani language agitation, Konkani in the Devanagari script finally became the official language of the union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu in 1987. The Indians allowed certain Portuguese institutions to continue unchanged. Amongst these were the land ownership system of the &quot;comunidades&quot;, where land was held by the community of neighbourhoods was then leased out to individuals. Goans under the Indian Government left the Portuguese Civil Code of Goa and Daman unchanged, hence they remain as the only territories in India with a common civil code that does not depend on religion.

=== Citizenship ===
The Citizenship Act of 1955 granted the Government of India the authority to define citizenship in the Indian Union. In exercise of its powers, the government passed the &quot;Goa, Daman and Diu (Citizenship) Order, 1962&quot; on 28 March 1962 conferring Indian citizenship on all persons born on or before 20 December 1961 in Goa, Daman, and Diu.

=== Indo-Portuguese relations ===

Portugal&#x27;s Salazar dictatorship did not recognise India&#x27;s sovereignty over the annexed territories, and established a government-in-exile for the territories, which continued to be represented in the Portuguese National Assembly. After 1974&#x27;s Carnation Revolution, the new Portuguese government recognised Indian sovereignty over Goa, Daman and Diu, and the two states restored diplomatic relations. Portugal automatically gives citizens of the former Portuguese-India its citizenship and opened a consulate in Goa in 1994.

==Administration==
From the establishment of Portuguese India in 1505 until its disestablishment in 1961, an official with the title of governor or viceroy served as its highest authority, usually for a three-year term, initially with authority over all Crown territories east of the Cape of Good Hope. The latter title was attributed as a high honour while the monarchy lasted, however their duties were the same as governors. They were the highest military commanders as well as administrators, hence their authority fell on matters pertaining to the armed forces, diplomacy, trade, finance and personnel management. Before they left Portugal, they were handed a written set of orders and objectives, called &quot;regimento&quot;. The viceroys often attempted to influence the nomination of political allies to key positions. However, the final say fell on the metropolis. Many were accompanied by their personal retinues, and these often included their sons to serve in important military positions, such was the case of the captain-major of the seas of India Dom Lourenço de Almeida, son the viceroy Dom Francisco de Almeida. After Goa was conquered, governors and viceroys lived in the &quot;Palácio do Hidalcão&quot;, the native Indian palace built by the city&#x27;s former sovereign, the Adil Khan.

The most important administrative structure of the State was put in place in the 16th century; it included the high court (&quot;relação&quot;), the superintendency of finances (&quot;vedoria da fazenda&quot;) run by a Crown appointed &quot;vedor&quot;, financial accounts office (&quot;casa dos contos&quot;) and the military registry and supply office (&quot;casa da matrícula&quot;).

The extremely scattered nature of Portuguese holdings however, meant that the State was highly decentralized, with great power being held by individual fortress captains, their captain-generals or town halls, far away from Goa. Like the governors and viceroys, fortress captains served for three years, however their terms could be renovated. Sancho de Vasconcelos, captain-major of Ambon served for 19 years. In the most important captaincies, financial authority rested with the &quot;vedor&quot; (superintendent), while judicial authority was vested in an &quot;ouvidor&quot; (&quot;ombundsman&quot;). 
The Church played an important role in the State. The Pope had granted the Kings of Portugal exclusive ecclesiastical rights to religious patronage (&quot;Padroado&quot;) in their overseas possessions. After 1513 Portuguese eastern holdings were part of the bishopric of Funchal seated in Madeira island. After 1557 Goa became the seat of an archbishop with subordinate bishops in Cochin and Malacca. Further sees were later opened in Macau in 1576 and in Funai in 1588. Religious Orders of the Augustinians, Franciscans, Dominicans and Jesuits established mission headquarters in Goa, giving the Catholic Church a very visible presence and influence in the capital of the State of India, for which it earned the nickname of &quot;Rome of the East&quot;, a fact commented by many foreign travellers.

In the most important settlements featured a &quot;câmara&quot; (&quot;town hall&quot;), with charters similar to equivalent cities in Portugal, and they played an important role in administration, as they were the only institution through which settlers could voice their opinions and make themselves heard. They were responsible for local governance, could collect some municipal taxes and acted as a court of first instance. They sometimes provided loans to Viceroys, though cooperation was often difficult. Portuguese merchants often established by their own initiative a &quot;câmara&quot; in their non-Crown settlements, the most important case of which was the Leal Senado in Macau.

Aside from the Portuguese themselves, the State often also ruled over non-Portuguese, non-Christian peoples, and in these cases often the traditional native structures were left in place. When Afonso de Albuquerque captured Goa, the Hindu inhabitants were left in possession of their lands; the pre-Portuguese system of land-ownership and administration of village communes codified and the rights of Brahmin or Khsatria ganvkars (shareholders) recognized, and tax collection was left to the Hindu Timoja and after him the long-standing Krishna Rao. In Hormuz, Albuquerque left its native Muslim king as chief administrator under a protectorate. As the Counter-Reformation gained momentum in Europe, Brahmins were excluded from the Portuguese administration during the tenure of Dom Constantino de Bragança, which resulted in a wave of conversions.

==Trade and economy==
Trade had been one of the primary motivations behind the Portuguese expansion overseas, and one of the main objectives behind the foundation of the State of India was to take over the Europe-Asia trade, up to that point conducted mainly through the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, redirecting it around Africa via the Cape Route. Trade was processed either by the Crown through royal agents (&quot;feitores&quot;) working from royal trade posts (&quot;feitorias&quot;) and maintained by the royal finances, or by independent merchants, either Portuguese or otherwise. 

One of the main tasks of royal factors was to acquire spices to be shipped back to Europe. In 1503, the Portuguese unloaded at Lisbon 30,000 quintals of spices, more than what the Venetians introduced in the European market through Alexandria in Egypt. The overwhelming bulk of commodities imported to Europe by the Portuguese consisted of black pepper, which after 1520 was declared an official Crown monopoly. The Portuguese acquired most of their pepper in Kerala or Kanara in India. For most of the century, the Portuguese secured an overwhelming share of the pepper imports into Europe, supplying 75 per cent or more of Europes pepper. The Crown declared a monopoly on their commodities, such as cloves, nutmeg, mace, cinnamon, ginger, silk, pearls and the export of gold and silver bullion from Portugal to Asia.

The Portuguese Crown instituted a number of official &quot;carreiras&quot;, literally meaning &quot;runs&quot;, connecting Goa to major Portuguese and non-Portuguese harbours around the Indian and Pacific oceans once a year. Initially conducted through Crown vessels, after 1560, the Crown began leasing them to private contractors, and by the late 16th century they were the norm. By 1580, the value of inter-Asian trade rights leases reached as high as two million cruzados - twice the value the Portuguese Crown earned from the Goa-Lisbon trade. 

Portugal regulated and rerouted the Indian Ocean trade by imposing a system of safe-passes called &quot;cartaz&quot;. It was imposed most effectively on the west coast of India. The Portuguese Crown also collected high customs dues, most importantly at Goa, Hormuz, Malacca, Bassein and Diu, and in the 1580s it accounted for over 85% of the viceroys revenue. 

Independent Portuguese merchants got involved in the inter-Asian trade, and the backbone of informal Portuguese presence and trade in Asia was formed of Eurasian merchants, descending from Portuguese soldiers or merchants married to local wives. Their main hub of activities was the capital of Goa, where the largest community of &quot;casados&quot; (&quot;married men&quot;) was located at, about 2,000 families. The core element of their trade was Gujarati cotton textiles, but they also dealt in Kerala pepper, cinnammon from Sri Lanka, Kanara rice, diamonds from southern India and larins from Persia. By 1520 they had penetrated almost every commercially relevant region in Asia aside from Japan (which was reached in the 1540s). Macau was founded by independent Portuguese traders. The Crown regulated their trade into a number of convoys for safety against pirates, the most important of which were those which transported textiles from Gujarat to Goa and rice from Kanara to Goa. The second most important settlement of Portuguese merchants in India was Cochin, where 500 &quot;casados&quot; with their families resided. Diu had a &quot;casado&quot; population of about 200.

Portuguese India Company was established in 1628, however with the Crown being its only major shareholder, it was liquidated five years later. By that point, Portugal&#x27;s share of pepper trade had fallen behind those of the Dutch VOC and the English EIC.

Portuguese trade was greatly reduced by the war with the Dutch VOC, with whom a peace treaty was signed in 1663. Inter-Indian Portuguese convoys continued, mainly with Gujarat, Porto Novo and Madras. Indian cottons became the bedrock of exports from Portuguese India, while tobacco grown in Portuguese Brazil became the most important commodity exported across Asia via Portuguese India till the 19th century. New Portuguese East India Companies established in 1669 and 1685 failed, largely due to disagreements between the Crown and the merchants over the nature of the enterprise and lack of confidence from investors. By the 18th century, tobacco, bullion, firearms, consumer goods such as Madeira wine and books represented the most important items traded in Portuguese India, while exports back to Europe included silks, spices, porcelain, precious stones, Indian cottons and high quality lacquered furniture, a good proportion being unloaded at Bahia in Brazil. Indian cottons were especially valuable in Mozambique, where an important community of Indians from Diu or Daman came to reside. Nevertheless, Goa effectively became a commercial satellite of British Bombay. Many Indo-Portuguese merchants became deeply involved and prominent in French Pondicherry, Danish Tranquebar and especially British Madras, Calcutta and Bombay, Portuguese Jews being linked to the diamond trade in Madras.

==Society and culture==
The State was largely urban, since its reason of being was to provide well-protected havens from which trade and communication could be conducted, controlled and dominated, hence only Goa, Daman, Bassein, Chaul and Colombo had any meaningful hinterland and rural populations. After the massacre of the Portuguese in their &quot;feitoria&quot; in Calicut in 1500, practically every possession of the State was fortified, sometimes massively, and for this reason it resembled as much a network of maritime communications as an enormous perimeter of fortresses.

Portuguese India harboured a society that was officially Christian and European but influenced by the non-European setting into which it was inserted. At the top of the social pyramid were the European-born viceroys, officers, and clergymen, followed by the Portuguese &quot;casados&quot; and their Eurasian descendants, who could be wealthy merchants or hold important positions in the local &quot;câmara&quot;, and finally the native society. At their peak in 1600, the total number of Portuguese &quot;casados&quot; across the State probably numbered about 5,500. Many &quot;casados&quot; followed a lifestyle that seemed to foreign visitors as remarkably relaxed and luxurious by European standards, some living in fine houses furnished in the Indian fashion with many servants, abundant and varied food that included a wide variety of fruits and poultry, consumed off Ming porcelain. Goan &quot;casados&quot; often dressed in shirts and white trousers while their wives usually wore saris.

Alongside fortresses, ecclesiastical buildings dominated the skyline of most Portuguese settlements, particularly in Goa, giving the city a distinctly European and Catholic flavour and a high profile to the Church. About 600 clergymen were concentrated in Goa out of perhaps 1800 east of the Cape of Good Hope in 1630. Nevertheless, the European and Christian Eurasian community in any Portuguese settlement of the State always constituted a minority, perhaps no more than 7% in the case of Goa, the rest being Hindus, Indian Christians, other Asians and Africans, free or slaves. 

For these reasons, the State was culturally hybrid, distant as it was from Europe, with the façades and interiors of churches blending Portuguese and Asian iconographic traditions, while the domestic culture was likewise a compromise between East and West, with furniture, dress and food often more Asian than Portuguese.

== Postal history ==

Early postal history of the colony is obscure, but regular mail is known to have been exchanged with Lisbon from 1825 onwards. Portugal had a postal convention with Great Britain, so much mail was probably routed through Bombay and carried on British packets. Portuguese postmarks are known from 1854 when a post office was opened in Goa.

The last regular issue for Portuguese India was on 25 June 1960, for the 500th anniversary of the death of Prince Henry the Navigator. Stamps of India were first used on 29 December 1961, although the old stamps were accepted until 5 January 1962. Portugal continued to issue stamps for the lost colony but none were offered for sale in the colony&#x27;s post offices, so they are not considered valid stamps.

Dual franking was tolerated from 22 December 1961 until 4 January 1962. Colonial (Portuguese) postmarks were tolerated until May 1962.

<text>Toni Michele Braxton (born October 7, 1966) is an American singer, songwriter, actress and television personality. She has sold over 70 million records worldwide and is one of the best-selling female artists in history. Braxton has won seven Grammy Awards, nine &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, seven American Music Awards, and numerous other accolades. In 2011, Braxton was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. In 2017 she was honored with the Legend Award at the Soul Train Music Awards.

In the late 1980s, Braxton began performing with her sisters in a music group known as The Braxtons; the group was signed to Arista Records. After attracting the attention of producers Antonio &quot;L.A.&quot; Reid and Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds and being signed to LaFace Records, Braxton released her self-titled debut studio album in 1993. The album reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and sold 10 million copies worldwide. In addition, the singles &quot;Another Sad Love Song&quot; and &quot;Breathe Again&quot; became international successes. The album brought Braxton three Grammy Awards, including the Grammy for Best New Artist.

Braxton experienced continued success with the albums &quot;Secrets&quot; (1996), which included the U.S. #1 hit singles &quot;You&#x27;re Makin&#x27; Me High/Let It Flow&quot; and &quot;Un-Break My Heart&quot;; and &quot;The Heat&quot; (2000), which opened at #2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and included the U.S. #2 hit single &quot;He Wasn&#x27;t Man Enough&quot;. Braxton&#x27;s subsequent studio albums, &quot;Snowflakes&quot; (2001), &quot;More Than a Woman&quot; (2002), &quot;Libra&quot; (2005) and &quot;Pulse&quot; (2010), were released amid contractual disputes and health issues. In 2014, Braxton and longtime collaborator Babyface released a duet album entitled &quot;Love, Marriage &amp; Divorce&quot; that earned the duo a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Album in 2015. Further label changes saw the release of &quot;Sex &amp; Cigarettes&quot; (2018) under Def Jam/Universal and &quot;Spell My Name&quot; (2020) under Island.

Braxton is also a television executive producer and personality. She competed in the seventh season of the reality competition series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. She has executive produced and starred in &quot;Braxton Family Values&quot;, a reality television series that aired on We TV from 2011 to 2020. Braxton was also an executive producer of &quot;Tamar &amp; Vince&quot;, a spinoff reality TV series starring her younger sister, Tamar.

==Early life==
Toni Michele Braxton was born in Severn, Maryland, on October 7, 1966. Her father, Michael Conrad Braxton Sr., was a Methodist clergyman and power company worker, and her mother, Evelyn Jackson, a native of South Carolina, was a former opera singer and cosmetologist, as well as a pastor. Braxton&#x27;s maternal grandfather was also a pastor. Braxton later said that her religious upbringing had given her an advantage musically, saying it gave her &quot;a finer-tuned ear. [...] The church pulpit is the stage. You got the congregation, that&#x27;s your audience. And so we were comfortable performing&quot;.

Braxton is the eldest of six siblings. She has a younger brother Michael Jr. (born 1968) and four younger sisters Traci Renee (1971 - 2022), Towanda Chloe (born 1973), Trina Evette (born 1974), and Tamar Estine (born 1977). They were raised in a strict religious household, and Braxton&#x27;s first performing experience was singing in her church choir.

Braxton attended Bowie State University to obtain a teaching degree, but decided to sing professionally after she was discovered by William E. Pettaway Jr., who reportedly heard her singing to herself while pumping gas.

On her appearance May 24, 2014, broadcast of NPR&#x27;s &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;, she stated that she was not singing to herself at the gas station. Pettaway, working as an attendant at the Annapolis service station where she was refueling, recognized her from local performances and introduced himself, saying he wanted to produce her. Although skeptical, Braxton decided to, in her words, &quot;take a chance&quot; and accepted.

==Career==
===1989–1995: The Braxtons, &quot;Toni Braxton&quot; and breakthrough===

Braxton and her four sisters Traci, Towanda, Trina, and Tamar began performing as The Braxtons in the late 1980s and were signed to Arista Records in 1989. Their first single, &quot;Good Life&quot;, was released in 1990. Though the song was not successful, it attracted the attention of record executive Antonio &quot;L.A.&quot; Reid and record producer Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds. Reid and Babyface recruited her to record a demo of &quot;Love Shoulda Brought You Home&quot;, a song that they had written for Anita Baker for the soundtrack of Eddie Murphy&#x27;s film, &quot;Boomerang&quot;. Baker, who was pregnant at the time, did not record the song but suggested that Braxton record it. Her recording was later included on the soundtrack along with &quot;Give U My Heart&quot;, a duet by Braxton and Babyface. Braxton, meanwhile, was signed to Reid and Edmonds&#x27; Arista-distributed imprint, LaFace Records, and immediately began recording her solo debut album.

In July 1993, LaFace released Braxton&#x27;s self-titled debut album. Primarily produced by Reid, Babyface, and Daryl Simmons, it peaked at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and entered the top ten of the albums chart in Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The first single, &quot;Another Sad Love Song&quot;, peaked at number seven and number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and R&amp;B Singles charts respectively. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Breathe Again&quot;, peaked in the top five of both the Hot 100 and R&amp;B singles charts and no 2 in the UK. More singles from &quot;Toni Braxton&quot; were released in 1994, including &quot;You Mean the World to Me&quot;, &quot;Seven Whole Days&quot;, and &quot;I Belong to You/How Many Ways&quot;.

Braxton&#x27;s debut album won her several awards, including three Grammy Awards (for Best New Artist and two consecutive awards for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance in 1994 and 1995). She won two American Music Awards (for Favorite Soul/R&amp;B New Artist and Favorite New Adult Contemporary Artist) in 1994 and another one in 1995 (for Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Album). &quot;Toni Braxton&quot; was certified 8× platinum in USA and has sales of over 10 million worldwide.

===1996–1999: &quot;Secrets&quot; and financial issues===
In June 1996, Braxton released her second album &quot;Secrets&quot;. Motivated &quot;to include a little bit of everything&quot;, Braxton reteamed with Babyface, but also worked with R. Kelly, Tony Rich, and David Foster on the album, which she co-produced. A major success, it peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and reached the top ten on most international charts. After 92 weeks in the charts, &quot;Secrets&quot; was certified 8× platinum, becoming Braxton&#x27;s second straight 8 million-seller. Internationally, &quot;Secrets&quot; sold more than 15 million copies, further cementing Braxton&#x27;s superstar status. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;You&#x27;re Makin&#x27; Me High&quot;, marked Braxton&#x27;s first number-one hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while follow-up &quot;Un-Break My Heart&quot;, a ballad written and composed by Diane Warren, became the biggest hit of Braxton&#x27;s career yet. It spent eleven consecutive weeks at number one on the Hot 100 and enjoyed worldwide top five success.

As a result, Braxton topped several of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s year-end charts, and won two Grammy Awards; one for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;Un-Break My Heart&quot; and Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance for &quot;You&#x27;re Makin&#x27; Me High&quot; as well as two American Music Awards for Favorite Female Soul/R&amp;B Artist and Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Album. Still waiting on her financial rewards, Braxton eventually launched an unsuccessful lawsuit against Arista and LaFace Records. Soon after, she filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy. Public reaction to these events was very harsh, having been expressed most clearly in an interview on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show.&quot;

Braxton has appeared in two Disney Broadway shows: She made her Broadway debut as Belle in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; beginning September 9, 1998, when she replaced Kim Huber. During her run in the show Alan Menken wrote and composed a new song for the musical, titled &quot;A Change in Me&quot;, which he specially wrote and composed for Braxton, and was still being used in the musical as of late July 2014. She left the production on February 28, 1999, and was succeeded by Andrea McArdle. Her role in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; marked the first (and only) time a black woman commanded the leading role of Belle on Broadway. (In the UK, Michelle Gayle played the role in the West End.) It also marked the first time a black woman would star in a Disney musical on Broadway. In 1999, the lawsuit against LaFace Records was settled and Braxton was given back all her possessions, giving her time to record &quot;The Heat&quot;, her first album in four years.

===2000–2002: &quot;The Heat&quot;, &quot;More Than a Woman&quot;, and acting debut===
After her three-year-long dispute with LaFace and Arista had been settled, Braxton signed a new $20 million contract. In April 2000, her third studio album, &quot;The Heat&quot; was released. Braxton took a more hands-on approach, co-writing and co-producing a handful of the tracks which saw her adapting a more urban sound. It opened at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 199,000 copies sold in its first week, eventually going double platinum in the United States, while selling over 4 million copies worldwide. Additionally, the album was nominated for Best R&amp;B Album at the 2001 Grammy Awards, while uptempo lead single &quot;He Wasn&#x27;t Man Enough&quot;, a worldwide top ten hit, won for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance and was nominated for Best R&amp;B Song.

In 2001, Braxton made her movie acting debut in director Doug McHenry&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; opposite an ensemble also starring LL Cool J, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Whoopi Goldberg A modest box-office success, it grossed $23.4 million worldwide. The same year, Braxton recorded and released the Christmas album &quot;Snowflakes&quot; which consisted R&amp;B–led original songs co-penned with Keri Lewis and Babyface as well as several remixes and cover versions of Christmas standards and carols. It received a mixed reception by critics, many of whom compared its nature to Braxton&#x27;s other work but found the stylized production and original material too contemporary to conjure images of Christmas, and failed to reach the upper half of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, eventually going gold in the United States.

In 2002, while gearing up for the release of her fourth studio album, Braxton discovered she was pregnant with her second child. Knowing that she would be unable to promote the album properly, she unsuccessfully lobbied Arista Records to get the label to postpone its release until after she was to give birth. In November 2002, &quot;More Than a Woman&quot; was released. Opening to an instant commercial disappointment, the album peaked at number 13 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but was less successful internationally. The first single &quot;Hit the Freeway&quot; failed to impact, resulting in lackluster sales in general and the release of no further singles. &quot;More Than a Woman&quot; was eventually certified gold in the United States and sold more than 800,000 copies worldwide.

=== 2003–2007: &quot;Libra&quot; and Las Vegas residency===
In April 2003, Braxton abruptly left Arista Records, having been there for 14 years, and immediately signed with Blackground Records, headed by Barry Hankerson, her manager at the time. She then starred in &quot;Aida&quot; as Aida beginning June 30, 2003, when she replaced actress Simone, until she left the cast on November 16, 2003. In April 2005, Braxton&#x27;s new label, Blackground/Universal, released &quot;Please&quot;, the first single from her fifth album, &quot;Libra&quot;. The album was originally planned for a June release, but it was pushed back several times and was finally issued on September 27. &quot;Libra&quot; peaked at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 114,593 copies in the first week, and peaked at number two on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. The album was certified gold in late 2005 and has since sold 679,000 copies worldwide.

In May 2005, Braxton made an appearance on the season finale of &quot;American Idol 5&quot;, where she performed Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;In the Ghetto&quot; with soon-to-be winner Taylor Hicks. A month later, &quot;The Time of Our Lives&quot;, a duet with classical crossover vocal group Il Divo, was released as a single, serving as the official 2006 FIFA World Cup anthem. Braxton performed the song, which entered the top ten in Switzerland, at the opening ceremony in Berlin on June 9, 2005. In August 2006, Braxton replaced singer Wayne Newton as the Flamingo Las Vegas&#x27;s new headlining act. The show, entitled &quot;Toni Braxton: Revealed&quot;, was to be performed six nights a week and was scheduled to run through to March 2007. Braxton later confirmed that she was extending her show through to August 2007. Due to its success, it was reported that Braxton would extend her show through to August 2008, though the show was later cancelled in order for Braxton to focus on her health after being diagnosed with microvascular angina.

On January 12, 2007, Braxton filed a $10 million lawsuit against her former manager Barry Hankerson, alleging &quot;fraud, deception and double dealing&quot;, in addition to mismanaging her relationship with Arista Records. According to Braxton&#x27;s lawsuit, Hankerson placed his personal financial interests ahead of hers by using &#x27;double-talk&#x27; to compromise the relationship between Braxton and her former label, with Hankerson allegedly telling Arista that &quot;Braxton no longer wanted to record for Arista&quot;, and telling Braxton that &quot;Arista was not interested in working with her anymore&quot;. The suit was settled with Braxton being forced to return a $375,000 advance to Hankerson, who would also receive a percentage of the sales of her next album, and Hankerson releasing Braxton from her contract with him. The settlement also temporarily limited the companies with which Braxton could sign. Hankerson claimed that the problems initially arose due to a number of disputes with Braxton and her wish to include her husband in her music.

=== 2008–2012: &quot;Pulse&quot; and television ===
Following the abrupt cancellation of her &quot;Toni Braxton: Revealed&quot; show, Braxton experienced financial difficulties when insurance agency Lloyd&#x27;s of London refused to honor her policy that she purchased for upwards of $70,000 that included financial compensations for financial losses. Lloyd&#x27;s responded with a counter-suit seeking damages against her because of an unrelated heart condition that the company was not made aware of at the time the application was filed. When Braxton acknowledged that she did not disclose her full medical history at the time, she got on the hook for all damages because of the cancelled shows, being sued by multiple companies, and had to once again file for bankruptcy. In September 2008, Braxton appeared on the seventh season of American dance competition series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;; her partner was Alec Mazo. They were voted off in the fifth week of the competition.
In 2009, Braxton signed to Atlantic Records and began work on her next studio album. In February 2010, she was part of the supergroup Artists for Haiti who recorded &quot;We Are the World 25 for Haiti&quot;, a remake of the 1985 hit &quot;We Are the World&quot;, to help benefit the people of Haiti following the magnitude 7.0 Mw earthquake. Three months later, &quot;Pulse&quot;, her seventh studio album, was released. A collection of up-tempo songs and R&amp;B ballads with production varying from smooth to dance-based styles, it debuted at number nine on the US &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, selling 54,000 copies in its first week, and topped the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, becoming Braxton&#x27;s fifth US top-ten album. A moderate chart success elsewhere, it reached the top ten in Switzerland, and the top 20 in Germany and Greece. While critical reception of &quot;Pulse&quot; was generally positive, its singles &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Hands Tied&quot; and &quot;Make My Heart&quot; achieved moderate chart success.

In 2011, Braxton signed with WE tv for a reality series, &quot;Braxton Family Values&quot;. Chronicling the lives of Braxton and her sisters Tamar, Traci, Towanda, and Trina, plus their mother Evelyn, the series debuted on April 12, 2011. It received favorable reviews from critics who recognized it as a &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; and spawned several seasons and spin-offs. In September 2011, Braxton parted ways with her long-time manager Vincent Herbert, husband of sister Tamar, and signed a new management deal with Los Angeles-based entertainment/production company The Collective. In March 2012, she released the standalone single &quot;I Heart You&quot;, a dance-pop, EDM and house song that peaked at number one on the US Dance Club Songs. Also that year, Braxton played Rosalie Rosebud, a singer with an over-the-top personality, in the children&#x27;s musical adventure comedy film &quot;The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure&quot; alongside Jaime Pressly and Cloris Leachman, and began filming a lead role in the Lifetime Movie Network film &quot;Twist of Faith&quot; which premiered the following year.

===2013–2014: &quot;Love, Marriage and Divorce,&quot; Broadway return, and biographical film===
In 2013, Braxton and longtime creative music partner Babyface began work on their collaborative studio album &quot;Love, Marriage &amp; Divorce&quot; which was released in February 2014 under Motown Records. It received favorable reviews from music critics, who labeled it as &quot;high-quality R&amp;B&quot;, and debuted at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the top of the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums with first-week sales of 67,000 copies. &quot;Love, Marriage &amp; Divorce&quot; was nominated for World&#x27;s Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards and won for Best R&amp;B Album at the 57th Grammy Awards. Lead single &quot;Hurt You&quot; reached number one on the US Adult R&amp;B Songs, becoming Braxton&#x27;s first song to do so since her 2000 release &quot;Just Be a Man About It&quot;. The song also hit number 16 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/ Hip Hop Airplay chart.

Braxton, alongside Babyface, made her return to Broadway in the musical &quot;After Midnight&quot; in March 2014. The third in rotation in the role of &quot;Special Guest Star&quot; following Fantasia Barrino and KD Lang, they performed from March 18 to 31, 2014 at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre. In May 2014, Braxton published a memoir, &quot;Unbreak My Heart: A Memoir&quot;, through Harper Collins Publishers. In it, Braxton discusses her career success and struggles and the self-healing she took charge of after her own diagnosis with the auto-immune disease lupus and her son&#x27;s diagnosis with autism. In October 2015, Toni along with The Braxtons released the holiday album &quot;Braxton Family Christmas&quot; on Def Jam Recordings. Comprising cover versions of Christmas standards and carols as well as several original songs, it debuted and peaked at number 27 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.

Lifetime premiered the biographical film &quot;Toni Braxton: Unbreak My Heart&quot;, based on Braxton&#x27;s memoir, in January 2016; actress Lex Scott Davis portrayed Braxton in the film. The biopic&#x27;s premiere generated 3.6 million viewers. In July, Braxton announced that she would embark on a concert tour, titled The Hits Tour, that October. She was hospitalized on October 3, five days before the tour was scheduled to begin, due to complications with lupus, resulting in the cancellation of the tour&#x27;s first two dates. Braxton was admitted to hospital again on October 15, leading to another tour date cancellation, which was later rescheduled. In December, she announced that the January 2017 concert dates had been canceled.

===2017–2019: &quot;Sex &amp; Cigarettes&quot;, touring, and other ventures===
In January 2018, Braxton starred in the Lifetime film &quot;Faith Under Fire&quot;. In March, her eighth studio album &quot;Sex &amp; Cigarettes&quot;, her first solo album in eight years, was released on Def Jam Recordings. An adult contemporary R&amp;B album with production from Fred Ball, Babyface, Dapo Torimiro, and Tricky Stewart, it debuted at number 22 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number one on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. &quot;Sex &amp; Cigarettes&quot; received mainly positive reviews from music critics, and was nominated for Best R&amp;B Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. Second single &quot;Long as I Live&quot; topped the US Adult R&amp;B Songs, becoming Braxton&#x27;s eighth chart topper, while breaking a tie with singers Maxwell and R. Kelly to give her sole possession of the second-most number-one&#x27;s in the chart&#x27;s 24-year history. It also received Grammy Award nomination for Best R&amp;B Performance and Best R&amp;B Song.

Also in 2018, Braxton and Uncle Bud&#x27;s Hemp products created a joint marketing campaign for the latter&#x27;s products, which Braxton noted as helpful in her battle against lupus. In April 2018, Braxton and her sisters Trina and Towanda appeared on their sister Traci&#x27;s single &quot;Broken Things&quot;. In November, Braxton and Towanda appeared in the holiday film &quot;Every Day is Christmas&quot;, which premiered on Lifetime. The same month, she announced her As Long as I Live Tour, a joint concert tour with SWV, which took her to South Africa and the United Kingdom. In June 2019, Braxton headlined the 2019 Pittsburgh Pride festival.

===2020–present: New record label and &quot;Spell My Name&quot;===
In April 2020, it was announced that Braxton had signed with Island Records. She released the single, &quot;Do It&quot;, her first song under the new deal on April 6, 2020. In May, Braxton released a remix EP for her second single &quot;Dance&quot;. On June 26, 2020, Missy Elliott appeared on the official remix to the single &quot;Do It&quot;.
Elliott co-produced the track alongside Hannon Lane. On August 4, 2020, Braxton released the music video for &quot;Dance&quot;, directed by Mike Ho. On August 27, 2020, Braxton released the song &quot;Nothin&#x27;&quot;. Braxton&#x27;s tenth studio &quot;Spell My Name&quot; was released on August 28, 2020. On October 23, 2020, Braxton released a video for her song &quot;Gotta Move On&quot;.

In 2021, Braxton competed on season six of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Pufferfish&quot;. She was the third to be eliminated during the two-night premiere alongside Dwight Howard as &quot;Octopus&quot; and Vivica A. Fox as &quot;Mother Nature&quot;. Despite being unmasked, Braxton kept on a glittered KN95 cloth face mask over her mouth due to her lupus condition. Braxton is an executive producer and star in the 2022 Lifetime movie &quot;The Fallen Angels Murder Club&quot;.

== Artistry ==
Braxton has been recognized for her distinctive contralto voice. Her voice has been called &quot;husky, sultry, elegant and sexy.&quot; Due to the huskiness of her voice, Braxton often used male singers such as Michael McDonald, Luther Vandross and Stevie Wonder as vocal style models. Chaka Khan and Anita Baker were two of the few female singers that she could stylize. Steve Huey of AllMusic cites a key to Braxton&#x27;s success is the versatility of her voice, which he states as being &quot;soulful enough for R&amp;B audiences, but smooth enough for adult contemporary; sophisticated enough for adults, but sultry enough for younger listeners; strong enough in the face of heartbreak to appeal to women, but ravishing enough to nab the fellas.&quot; In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Braxton at No. 48 on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

Braxton began her career singing traditional R&amp;B and soft rock ballads and love songs on her debut and second albums. However, hip-hop soul and dance music elements begun to get spun into her sound on &quot;The Heat&quot;, &quot;More Than a Woman&quot;, and &quot;Pulse&quot;. She also showcased her classical training while performing in Broadway plays &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;Aida&quot; as well as her duet with Il Divo, &quot;The Time of Our Lives&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Toni Braxton became an R&amp;B superstar after the release of her first album. LA Reid stated during an interview with VH1: &quot;We called her the first lady of LaFace. She was our Diva. Clive had Whitney, Tommy had Mariah and we had Toni.&quot; BBC called the album &quot;spiritedly, mature soul at its best – and just urban enough to make it the bedroom album for the hip hop generation.&quot; Over the span of her career Braxton has sold over 70 million records, including 40 million albums, worldwide. Her hit &quot;Un-Break My Heart&quot;, the Diane Warren-penned ballad, spent 11-weeks at number 1. Bob McCann, author of &quot;Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television&quot; (2010), considered it &quot;simply one of the most haunting R&amp;B records ever made.&quot; Reviewer Mark Edward Nero named it one of the best R&amp;B break-up songs and considered it Braxton&#x27;s &quot;finest moment&quot;. He further commented, &quot;damn, this song is so sad it can make people cry for hours at a time.&quot; Braxton is a recipient of seven Grammy Awards, seven American Music Awards, and nine Billboard Music Awards. She has been cited as an influence by various artists, such as Beyoncé, sister Tamar Braxton, Billie Godfrey, Kelly Clarkson, Leela James, Keyshia Cole, Teyana Taylor, Kehlani, Sevyn Streeter, Ari Lennox and Anja Nissen.

Braxton&#x27;s career, she made several impacts on fashion, mostly for her high splits in her dresses. In 2011, Braxton topped the list for the Grammy Award&#x27;s best dressed of the decade. &quot;I&#x27;ve always gone a little risque with all my other award show outfits.&quot; In 2012, Braxton made the list for VH1&#x27;s 50 Greatest Women in Music. Braxton&#x27;s 2000 performance at Super Bowl XXXIV is ranked as one of the most memorable Super Bowl performances. Braxton is featured alongside other R&amp;B and pop divas as a primary character on the popular web parody &quot;Got 2B Real: The Diva Variety Show&quot;. With her Las Vegas residency &quot;Toni Braxton: Revealed&quot;, she became the first African American performer in Las Vegas to have her act enter the top ten Vegas shows charting. Braxton also made headlines for her Giantto Million Dollar Microphone that she performed every show with. Braxton said: &quot;I think it&#x27;s a great element to the show. You have to have a little sprinkle of Liberace and this is my little sprinkle of that.&quot; Braxton&#x27;s prop was made up of white gold and encrusted with 650 karats of diamonds. The microphone reportedly cost $1 million.

Braxton has also been seen as a gay icon, with some of her songs becoming gay anthems, such as &quot;Un-Break My Heart&quot;, &quot;He Wasn&#x27;t Man Enough&quot; and &quot;Make My Heart&quot;. The singer stated that after the release of &quot;Un-Break My Heart&quot;, she &quot;recognized all the support. And it was really wonderful.&quot; When asked about her gay fans, Braxton said &quot;I love my boys because my boys help me be a better girl. My choreographer and my video director are gay, and they&#x27;ve been my best friends since I started in the industry. They&#x27;re my favorite part of the whole industry&quot;.

== Personal life ==
===Relationships===
Braxton met musician Keri Lewis when his group, Mint Condition, opened for her on tour; they married on April 21, 2001. In December 2001, she gave birth to their first child, a son. In 2002, while gearing up for the release of her fourth studio album, Braxton discovered she was pregnant with her second child; the complicated pregnancy confined her to bed rest. The couple&#x27;s second son was born in 2003. As he has been diagnosed with autism, Braxton has become involved with Autism Speaks, serving as their International Spokesperson. In November 2009, Braxton announced that she and her husband had separated. The couple later divorced in July 2013.

In her early 30s, Braxton had an abortion after discovering she was pregnant by then-boyfriend Keri Lewis. In her memoir &quot;Unbreak My Heart&quot;, Braxton discusses her abortion and guilt, saying that her second son&#x27;s autism was &quot;God&#x27;s payback&quot;. 
In an October 2006 concert at the Flamingo Las Vegas, Braxton broke down in tears while announcing to the audience that just before the concert began she had been told that her son had been diagnosed with autism. Braxton has been outspoken regarding her doctor&#x27;s failure to diagnose his condition earlier, contending that if he had been diagnosed earlier he could have received treatment earlier. As well as becoming a spokeswoman for Autism Speaks, she is also a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association.

On July 8, 2015, Braxton&#x27;s attorney, Antavius Weems, announced that Braxton had settled her contentious child support case with her former husband, Keri Lewis. On June 2, 2016, the city and county officials of Atlanta, Georgia, named June 2 as Toni Braxton Day.

Braxton began dating rapper Birdman in May 2016, and the couple announced their engagement in February 2018. In January 2019, the couple called off the engagement. However, in April 2019, both Braxton and Birdman confirmed that they were still together. But since at least 2022, Braxton has made several television appearances, where she has declared herself single and on the dating scene, which indicates that her relationship with Birdman has ceased.

=== Health problems ===
In August 2007, rumors surfaced that Braxton had been diagnosed with breast cancer. She stated to &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; that the breast cancer rumors were false and that her health was very good. However, in 2008, she had a benign lump removed from her breast. On April 8, 2008, near the end of her two-year run at the Flamingo Hotel, Braxton was briefly hospitalized and the remaining dates on the show, which was scheduled to end on August 23, 2008, were cancelled. Later, while appearing on Season 7 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, she stated, that she has been diagnosed with microvascular angina (small vessel disease).

On November 18, 2010, Braxton revealed to CBS News that she had been diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a potentially life-threatening autoimmune disease.

Braxton&#x27;s uncle died of complications from lupus. While taping her reality series &quot;Braxton Family Values&quot;, she went into hospital for surgery. Braxton was hospitalized in Los Angeles in December 2012 because of &quot;minor health issues&quot; related to lupus.

<doc id="495353" wikidata="Q1351682" url="?curid=495353" title="Issun-bōshi">
<text>is the subject of a fairy tale from Japan. This story can be found in the old Japanese illustrated book &quot;Otogizōshi&quot;. Similar central figures and themes are known elsewhere in the world, as in the tradition of Tom Thumb in English folklore.

==Synopsis==

The general story is:
*A childless old couple prayed to the Sumiyoshi sanjin to be blessed with a child, and so they were able to have one. However, the child born was only one &quot;sun&quot; (around 3 cm or 1.2 in) in height and never grew taller. Thus, the child was named the &quot;one-sun boy&quot; or &quot;Issun-bōshi&quot;.
*One day, Issun-bōshi said he wanted to go the capital to become a warrior, so he embarked on his voyage with a bowl as a boat, a chopstick as a paddle, a needle as a sword, and a piece of straw as a scabbard. In the capital, he found a splendid big house and found employment there. When a girl of that family went on a journey to visit a palace, an &quot;oni&quot; kidnapped the girl. As Issun-bōshi attempted to save the girl, the &quot;oni&quot; swallowed him up. Issun-bōshi used the needle to stab at the &quot;oni&quot; in the stomach, making the &quot;oni&quot; surrender, saying &quot;it hurts, stop.&quot; The &quot;oni&quot; spat Issun-bōshi back out before fleeing to the mountains.
*Issun-bōshi picked up the magic hammer (Uchide no kozuchi) dropped by the &quot;oni&quot; and swung it to enlarge his body to a height of six &quot;shaku&quot; (about 182 cm or 6 ft) and married the girl. It is said that he was able to use that mallet to conjure food, treasures, and other things, and the family was able to prosper for generations.
However, the version of the story written in the &quot;Otogi-zōshi&quot; has a few differences:
*The old couple was disturbed by how Issun-bōshi never grew larger and thought he was some kind of monster. As a result, Issun-bōshi left their house.
*The place where Issun-bōshi lived in the capital was a chancellor&#x27;s home.
*Issun-bōshi fell in love with the chancellor&#x27;s daughter at first sight and wanted to make her his wife. However, he felt that with such a small body, she would not marry him, so he thought out a plan. He brought some of the rice grains offered to the family altar and put them in the girl&#x27;s mouth, and then took an empty teabag and pretended to cry. When the chancellor saw this, Issun-bōshi lied and said that the girl stole some rice that he had been storing, and the chancellor believed this and attempted to kill his daughter. Issun-bōshi mediated between them and left the house together with the daughter.
*The boat that they rode on went with the wind and landed on an eerie island. There, they encountered an &quot;oni&quot;, and the &quot;oni&quot; swallowed Issun-bōshi whole. However, Issun-bōshi took advantage of his small body and went out of the &quot;oni&quot;″s body through its eye. This repeated several times until the &quot;oni&quot; was frustrated and withdrew, leaving the magic hammer behind.
*The rumors of Issun-bōshi spread throughout society and he was summoned to the palace. The emperor took a liking to Issun-bōshi, and raised him to the rank of Chūnagon.
A version where Issun-bōshi strategized to marry a rich person&#x27;s daughter is recorded in the &quot;Shinkoku Gudo Zuihitsu&quot; of the Edo period. Other documents record similar tales:
*As a result of framing the daughter, Issun-bōshi was left in charge of her. Another theory is that by putting a suitor&#x27;s food into&#x27;s one&#x27;s mouth, a person accepts that man&#x27;s proposal.
*The boy who became betrothed used the magic hammer to grow himself into a taller man and married the girl. Some versions may be missing a theme of making a strategy or plan with regards to the girl.
*Some versions might only have the part about beating the &quot;oni&quot; and not about making such strategies or growing larger.
There are also many differences in the tale depending on the region where it is told.

==Interpretation==
It is unknown when the modern tale came about, but it is generally considered to have existed before the end of the Muromachi period. The theme of a &quot;tiny child&quot; is thought to have originated from Sukuna-hikona (written variously, including Sukunabikona) (meaning &quot;small earth god&quot;: suku is &quot;small&quot;, na is &quot;the earth&quot;, hiko is &quot;male god&quot;, and na is a suffix) of Japanese mythology.

Sukuna-hikona acts as a medium for the Dōjō Hōshi of the Nihon Ryōiki and Sugawara no Michizane of the &quot;Tenjin Engi&quot; (天神縁起) and is connected to the &quot;Kootoko no Sōshi&quot; (小男の草子, &quot;Book about the Small Man&quot;) from the Middle Ages and the &quot;otogi-zōshi&quot; of the modern ages.

It has been pointed out that just like how the nation-creator god Sukuna-hikona appeared near water, the main character of the old tale &quot;Chiisa-ko&quot; (small child) is in some way related to the world of water and is related to the existence of a faith in a water god. For an old couple not to have any children is an abnormality within the community and for such abnormal persons give birth in an abnormal way such as by praying to a god and giving birth from the shin to a person in the form of a pond snail, as one would find in the tale Tanishi Chōja, is the normal course for tales about heroes and children of god.

As the Issun Bōshi of the &quot;otogi-zōshi&quot; became famous, people of various different lands started calling their folktales and legends about little people &quot;Issun Bōshi&quot; as well.

In the Edo period, &quot;Issun Bōshi&quot; was used as a pejorative term against short people, and in kyōka books about yōkai such as the &quot;Kyōka Hyakki Yakyō&quot; (狂歌百鬼夜狂) and the &quot;Kyōka Hyaku Monogatari&quot;, Issun Bōshi were written about to be a type of yōkai.

Also, Issun Bōshi&#x27;s location of residence, the village of Naniwa (國難波) of Tsu Province, is said to be near the area between present-day Nanba (難波) and Mittera (三津寺). Also, in the &quot;Otogizōshi&quot;, there is the statement &quot;Perhaps my heart longs to leave this shore of Nanba I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to living in and hurry to the capital&quot; (すみなれし難波の浦をたちいでて都へいそぐわが心かな, &quot;suminareshi Nanba no ura wo tachiidete miyako he isogu wa ga kokoro ka na&quot;), so this &quot;shore of Nanba&quot; that was the point of departure for heading to the capital on a bowl is nowadays said to be the Dōtonbori river canal.

===Folkloristics===
Just like how Ōkuninushi no Mikoto (or &quot;Ōnamuchi&quot;, meaning &quot;big earth&quot;: Ō means &quot;big&quot;, na means &quot;the earth&quot;, and muchi is an honorific) helped Sukuna-hikona create the nation, it often happens that a little person and giant would appear as a pair and would each separately have the different aspects for being a hero: power and knowledge.

The giant would be lacking in knowledge and would thus fall and be reduced to being an &quot;oni&quot; or laughingstock, whereas the little person, on the other hand, would make use of cunning and as a result eventually become a fully formed adult and return home to live happily ever after. A tiny child would, of course, be let off the hook for malicious deeds.

In the &quot;Tawara Yakushi&quot;, old tale about a cunning lad, a wicked and cunning child who displays not a single bit of a hero&#x27;s sense of justice appears as the main character of this story, and in it he thoroughly trounces and kills his rich employer using a method similar to Issun Bōshi&#x27;s but of course in a wicked manner. The child lies and tricks his master one time after another until finally he pushes his master over a levee and kills him as a result and after that forces the master&#x27;s wife to marry him. Thus the story closes with &quot;and so he became married to the unwilling former master&#x27;s wife. The end&quot; (iyagaru okami-sama to muriyari fuufu ni natta do sa. dotto harai), a comedic tone full of parody and black humor.

This boy who obtains wealth and a woman by means of lies and slaughter is basically the flip side appearance of the Issun Bōshi who obtained an &quot;oni&quot;″s treasure and a woman by means of wisdom and is none other than the descendant of the aforementioned &quot;Chiisa-ko&quot; god.

The cruelty of the boy in the &quot;Tawara Yakushi&quot; is directed at innocent others. In fact, he would even go so far as to deceive and take advantage of the weak, such as the blind or beggars with eye illnesses, so that they would take the blame and die in his place.

This slaughter of others reveals a dark side to the village where the killing of others can be considered a form of compensation. As the tale humorously makes fun of a wicked usage of wisdom, it makes a show of how wisdom has a destructiveness that can surpass society&#x27;s sense of order as well as the complexities of the village&#x27;s society. It is said that wisdom is filled with dangerous power that can turn righteousness and purity meaningless and laugh away at the stability and orderliness of society important for maintaining political power. Inomata Tokiwa, a lecturer at Kyoritsu Women&#x27;s Junior College, analyzes this saying that it tells of how even though Sukuna-hikona is a god who created the nation as well and the creator god of chemical technology such as drugs (medicine) and alcohol, &quot;wisdom&quot; by itself is not a representation of societal orderliness.

===Similar tales===
Stories in which &quot;Chiisa-ko&quot; plays a role include the all-national Issun Bōshi, the Suneko Tanpoko, the Akuto Tarō (akuto means &quot;heel&quot;), Mamesuke (meaning &quot;thumb&quot;), Yubi Tarō　(&quot;yubi&quot;, meaning &quot;finger&quot;, refers to the place of birth), Mameichi (referring to the thumb), Gobu Tarō (or Jirō) (&quot;Gobu&quot; is literally &quot;five bu&quot; but also a general term for small things), Sanmontake (&quot;mon&quot; is a counter for coins, so it means &quot;three coins height&quot; or the height of a stack of three coins), Issun Kotarō, Tanishi (meaning &quot;pond snail&quot;), Katamutsuri (meaning &quot;snail&quot;), Kaeru (meaning &quot;frog&quot;), the Koropokkurukamui of the Ainu people, the Kijimuna, the Kenmun, among others, and tales of those born abnormally small such as Momotarō, Uriko-hime to Amanojaku (&quot;Princess Uriko and the Amanojaku&quot;), and Kaguya-hime are also related. There is a lot of variation with it comes to whether or not it includes beating an &quot;oni&quot;, scheming to marry someone, and the usage of a magical tool. Stories that start with birth from the shin or finger or small animal among other possibilities and develop into making a scheme to get someone to agree to marriage are old, but newer than the Issun Bōshi tale in the otogi-zōshi. It has left is mark popularizing old tales in the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions.

==Nursery tales==
*The Meiji Period children&#x27;s book &quot;Nihon Mukashibanashi&quot; (日本昔噺, &quot;Old Tales of Japan&quot;) by Iwaya Sazanami first published in 1896 or Meiji 29 has within one of its 24 volumes popularly established the Sazanami-type Issun Bōshi. Over 20 editions of this book were printed in the approximately ten years between then and 1907 or Meiji 40, and they were widely read until the end of the Taishō period. The story currently published in children&#x27;s book mostly follows this Sazanami-type Issun Bōshi tale. It removes any wickedness that was in the original and turns Issun Bōshi into a more loveable figure.
*Among picture books, the book &quot;Issun Bōshi&quot; written by Ishii Momoko and illustrated by Akino Fuku published in 1965 by Fukuinkan Shoten Fukuinkan Shoten is of particular note.
*Hop-o&#x27;-My-Thumb as told by Charles Perrault was introduced to Japan under the title &quot;Shōsetsu Issun Bōshi&quot; (Novelized Issun Bōshi) as it was published in the magazine &quot;Shōkokumin&quot; in 1896 (Meiji 29).

==Songs==
*In 1905 (Meiji 38), &quot;Jinjō Shōgaku Shōka&quot; (&quot;The Common Songs for Elementary Schoolers&quot;) included one titled &quot;Issun Bōshi&quot; by Iwaya Sazanami, and it continues to be sung by children today.

==Other versions==
There are many other versions of the story Issun-bōshi, but there are some that seem to take on a completely different story of their own, and have stayed that way since their new retellings. These versions include the story of Mamasuke, the adult version of Issun-boshi, and the modernized version that are seen worldwide today.

===Mamesuke===
The Mamesuke version of Issun-bōshi is essentially the same, except for a few key defining factors. Rather than being born from his mother&#x27;s womb, Issun-boshi was born from the swelling of his mother&#x27;s thumb. He was also called Mamesuke, which means bean boy instead of Issun-bōshi, even though the story is still called Issun-bōshi. He does still set out on his own at some point, but instead of being armed with a sewing needle, bowl, and chopsticks, all he has is a bag of flour. He eventually finds his way to a very wealthy wine merchant who has three daughters. Mamesuke wishes to marry the middle daughter, so he begins to work for the merchant and live there. One night, Mamesuke takes the flour he has and wipes it on the daughter&#x27;s mouth, then throws the rest into the river. In the morning, he pretends to cry because his flour is gone, so the family investigates as to where it went when they discovered the flour on the middle daughter. She gets upset because she had nothing to do with the flour, but her family turns her over to Mamesuke as payment. He then begins to lead the girl home to his parents, while along the way the girl is so angry that she tries to find ways to kill him, but she could not find one. When Mamesuke returned home, his parents were so delighted with the girl that they set up a hot bath for him. Mamesuke got in and called for his bride to help him wash, but she came in with a broom instead and stirred up the water in an attempt to drown him. Mamesuke&#x27;s body suddenly burst open, and out stepped a full sized man. The bride and parents were surprised yet extremely happy, so Mamesuke and his bride lived happily with his parents.

===The love affair of Issun-boshi===
In other media, Issun-boshi makes an appearance as the character Issun, and is depicted as a pervert of sorts. This depiction relates back to the adult version of Issun-boshi, also known as The Love Affair of Issun-bōshi. The beginning of the story is essentially the same until Issun-boshi reaches the capital. When he comes upon the home of a wealthy lord, Issun-bōshi convinces him that he can do anything, so he should let him work for him. The lord tells him to do a dance for him, and he was so amused by Issun-bōshi&#x27;s dance that he decides to make him a playmate for his daughter. For a while, Issun-bōshi just listens to the daughter talk during the day, then he would tell her stories that she would fall asleep to at night. Issun-bōshi fell in love with her, and eventually she fell in love with him. One day the princess decides to head to a temple to go pray, and brings Issun-bōshi along with her. They are attacked by ogres along the way, and Issun-bōshi saves the princess, who then discovers the lucky mallet and makes Issun-bōshi normal sized. It was thought they would live happily ever after, but the couple would get into horrible fights, especially about how Issun-bōshi could not pleasure the princess like he used to. In his anger, Issun-bōshi used the lucky mallet to shrink the princess down, who in turn snatched the hammer from him and shrank him down. They went back and forth shrinking one another to the point where all that was left was the lucky mallet.

===Modernized Issun-boshi===
The modernized version of Issun-bōshi is very similar to the original, except there are different happenings that make it more universally acceptable. Rather than setting out on his own, Issun-bōshi&#x27;s parents send him off to learn about the world on his own. He still travels to the capital and ends up in the home of a wealthy lord, but rather than his daughter disliking him, she immediately fell in love with him, as well as the other residents of the lord&#x27;s home. Issun-bōshi and the girl still get attacked by ogres and obtain the lucky mallet, which is then used to make him normal sized. He grows into a fine young samurai, but it was never made clear where Issun-bōshi went from there. This abrupt ending is set up so that the audience can make their own guesses about what happened to Issun-bōshi.

In the 8th Season of Yami Shibai, Episode 07, Issub-bōshi is described as a creature which, when offended or provoked, can go inside a human body and as punishment turn it into a grotesque one, with large lumps sprouting randomly. He can also order the affected human to do evil things such as killing a person or in its words &quot;punishing&quot; them. The affected human will not be able to disobey said order and will forever succumb to Issub-bōshi&#x27;s curse.

==Themes==
The story of Issun-bōshi follows three common themes that appear in almost every Japanese folk tale. The first theme is that those who are devout and pray often are blessed with a child. Issun-bōshi&#x27;s parents prayed day after day until a child was born unto them. This theme also appears in the Japanese folk tale &quot;Momotarō&quot;. The second theme is that the accomplishments of these children are so extraordinary that they achieve almost every task that the audience wishes them to accomplish. Issun-bōshi gets the love of his life, attains a normal size, and becomes a well known samurai. The third theme is that said child grows up to have a good marriage and carries a special family name. In most versions, Issun-bōshi marries some sort of official&#x27;s daughter and becomes a very famous samurai.

==Religious differences==
In each of the different retellings of Issun-bōshi, there are different gods, goddesses, and deities that are mentioned in each, which are due to the differing regional religions at the time. In the modernized version as well as the adult versions of Issun-boshi, the princess he meets goes to pray to the Goddess Kannon. In Japan, Kannon is known as the goddess of child rearing and mercy, but the goddess has Buddhist origins. Buddhism originated in India but it grew across Asia and eventually settled in Japan as a base for Buddhism around the time Issun-bōshi became popular, which could potentially explain its influence in these versions of Issun-bōshi. In the modernized version of Issun-bōshi, his parents go pray to what they call &quot;Sumiyoshi sanjin&quot;, which is actually the name of a temple in Osaka, Japan. This temple is used for Shinto religious purposes, so the story of Issun-bōshi actually embodies multiple religions.

<doc id="495364" wikidata="Q1620150" url="?curid=495364" title="Province of Maine">
<text>The Province of Maine refers to any of the various English colonies established in the 17th century along the northeast coast of North America, within portions of the present-day U.S. states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, and the Canadian provinces of Quebec and New Brunswick. It existed through a series of land patents made by the kings of England during this era, and included New Somersetshire, Lygonia, and Falmouth (now Portland, Maine). The province was incorporated into the Massachusetts Bay Colony during the 1650s, beginning with the formation of York County, Massachusetts, which extended from the Piscataqua River to just east of the mouth of the Presumpscot River in Casco Bay. Eventually, its territory grew to encompass nearly all of present-day Maine.

==History==
===1622 patent===
The first patent establishing the Province of Maine was granted on 10 August 1622 to Sir Ferdinando Gorges and John Mason by the Plymouth Council for New England, which itself had been granted a royal patent by James I to the coast of North America between the 40th to the 48th parallel &quot;from sea to sea&quot;. This first patent encompassed the coast between the Merrimack and Kennebec rivers, and an irregular parcel of land between the headwaters of the two rivers. In 1629, Gorges and Mason agreed to split the patent at the Piscataqua River, with Mason retaining the land south of the river as the Province of New Hampshire.

Gorges named his more northerly piece of territory New Somersetshire after his home county of Somerset in England. Lack of funding and the absence of a royal charter held back development, and only a few small settlements were established. Gorges sought to create a neo-feudal community similar to western England. The colony was Anglican and Royalist, and so sided with the king in the English Civil War (1642–1651).

===1639 patent===
In 1639, Gorges obtained a renewed patent, the Gorges Patent, for the area between the Piscataqua and Kennebec Rivers, in the form of a royal charter from Charles I of England. The area was roughly the same as that covered in the 1622 patent after the 1629 split with Mason. This renewed colonization effort was also hampered by lack of money and settlers, but continued to survive even after the death of Gorges in 1647.

===Absorption by Massachusetts===
Beginning in the 1640s, the nearby Massachusetts Bay Colony began claiming territories north of the Merrimack River, because the Merrimack&#x27;s northernmost point was farther north than its mouth. This resulted in its administration of the early settlements of what later became New Hampshire. After a survey made in the early 1650s, Massachusetts extended its land claims as far north as Casco Bay. By 1658, Massachusetts had completed the assimilation of all of Gorges&#x27; original territory into its jurisdiction.

In 1664, Charles II of England made a grant to James, Duke of York for territories north and east of the Kennebec River. Under the terms of this patent the territory was incorporated into Cornwall County, part of the duke&#x27;s proprietary Province of New York. The territory stipulated in this charter encompassed the areas between the Kennebec and St. Croix Rivers. This region, which had previously been called the Territory of Sagadahock, forms the eastern portion of the present-day state of Maine. Charles had intended to include the former Gorges territory in this grant, but the Gorges&#x27; heirs instead chose to sell their remaining claims to Massachusetts.

In 1674-75, the region between the Kennebec River and Penobscot Bay was administered as Devonshire County, District of Maine, Massachusetts Bay Colony, overlapping the New York claim. Starting in 1675, King Philip&#x27;s War resulted in the abandonment of this area by English settlers until the 18th century.

In 1691, William III and Mary II issued a charter for the new Province of Massachusetts Bay that encompassed (in addition to other territories) the former claims of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and those of the Duke of York. The region became York County, Massachusetts and then the District of Maine, part of Massachusetts until it achieved statehood of its own in 1820.

<doc id="495373" wikidata="Q94080" url="?curid=495373" title="Time of Troubles">
<text>The Time of Troubles (), also known as Smuta (), was a period of political crisis in Russia which began in 1598 with the death of Feodor I, the last of the House of Rurik, and ended in 1613 with the accession of Michael I of the House of Romanov.

It was a period of deep social crisis and lawlessness following the death of Feodor I, a weak and possibly intellectually disabled ruler who died without an heir. His death ended the Rurik dynasty, leading to a violent succession crisis with numerous usurpers and false Dmitrys (imposters) claiming the title of tsar. Russia experienced the famine of 1601–1603, which killed almost a third of the population, within three years of Feodor&#x27;s death. Russia was also occupied by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth during the Polish–Russian War and lost Smolensk.

The Time of Troubles ended with the election of Michael Romanov as tsar by the Zemsky Sobor in 1613, establishing the Romanov dynasty, which ruled Russia until the February Revolution in 1917.

==Background==
Tsar Feodor I was the second adult son of Ivan the Terrible, the first tsar of Russia. Feodor&#x27;s elder brother, Tsarevich Ivan Ivanovich, was the heir apparent; Feodor was never considered a serious candidate for the Russian throne. However, Tsarevich Ivan was allegedly killed in anger by his father on 19 November 1581, making Feodor the new heir apparent.

According to Chester Dunning, &quot;Tsar Ivan knew perfectly well that Fedor could not rule on his own; before his own death in 1584, he set up a council of regents to govern in his son&#x27;s name. Ivan named as regents two leading boyars; Fedor&#x27;s uncle, Nikita Romanovich Zakharyin-Yuriev (head of the Romanov clan), and Prince Ivan F. Mstislavsky; he also named two leading members of his own court: a premier prince of the blood, the popular and heroic Prince Ivan Petrovich Shuisky, and Fedor&#x27;s brother-in-law, Boris Godunov. On the day of the coronation, Boris was named &quot;koniushii boiarin&quot; (master of the house or equerry) – a title that immediately identified him as the most powerful member of the boyar council. Prince Ivan Mstislavsky made a bid for power in 1585. He was stopped by the other regents and was forced to become a monk – which in Russia was an irreversible step. Out of this episode grew a tacit alliance between the Godunovs and the Romanovs to protect their families&#x27; interests.&quot; In 1586, after an anti-Godunov riot, &quot;Aged Prince Ivan Shuisky was forced to become a monk and kept under heavy guard. Boris Godunov was now Tsar Fedor&#x27;s sole regent and the most powerful man in Russia.&quot;
In the middle of the 16th century, Russia suffered famines, pestilence and internal discord which were accompanied by Ottoman-backed raids by the Crimean Khanate. In 1571, Devlet I Giray, and his army ransacked its lands in the events known as Fire of Moscow. In 1591, Ğazı II Giray and his brother Fetih I Giray launched another in Russia, but they were completely defeated. This was the last trip of the Crimeans to Moscow.

After Tsar Ivan&#x27;s death on 28 March 1584, Feodor was crowned as the tsar three days later. The pious Feodor took little interest in politics, ruling through Boris Godunov (his closest advisor, a boyar, the son-in-law of Malyuta Skuratov and the brother of Feodor&#x27;s wife, Irina Godunova). Feodor produced one child: a daughter, Feodosia, who died at the age of two.

According to Dunning, &quot;At the outset of Tsar Fedor&#x27;s reign, Boris Godunov and other regents moved against a threat emanating from the court faction supporting Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s youngest son, Dmitrii – the child of Ivan&#x27;s sixth and last wife, Maria Nagaia. In May, 1591, Tsarevich Dmitrii was reported to be dead. On the basis of testimony from several eyewitnesses,&quot; an investigative commission, &quot;concluded that Dmitrii had accidentally slit his own throat during an epileptic seizure that came on while he was playing with a knife.&quot;
In January 1598, Fedor died. According to Dunning, &quot;The tsar&#x27;s death without an heir brought to an end the only ruling dynasty Moscow had ever known.&quot; Irina abdicated the throne to the boyar council and entered a convent. The boyars convened a Zemsky Sobor to choose a new tsar. Godunov soon prevailed over his chief rival for the throne Feodor Romanov. Godunov was crowned in September 1598, and according to Dunning, &quot;To help calm any discontent and to cement his claim to the throne, the new tsar had himself &#x27;elected&#x27; after the fact by a sham zemskii sobor.&quot; After the Romanov conspiracy of 1600, Feodor Romanov was forced to become a monk.

&quot;Boris Godunov has been called one of Russia&#x27;s greatest rulers,&quot; according to Dunning, &quot;The man responsible for the expansion of Russia at the end of the sixteenth century was Boris Godunov.&quot; Yet in 1592, he had effectively enserfed millions, burdened the populace with heavy taxes, harassed the free cossacks, and in 1597, introduced a slave law converting contract slaves into slaves for life.

Russia experienced a famine in 1601–1603 after extremely poor harvests, with nighttime temperatures in the summer months often below freezing. Famine enveloped the country in 1602, followed by disease, claiming a third to two thirds of the population. Hunger riots, and the Khlopko rebellion of September 1603 also caused social instability.

==False Dmitry I==

According to Dunning, &quot;Russia&#x27;s first civil war came about as a direct result of the bold invasion of the country by a man claiming to be Tsarevich Dmitrii, somehow &#x27;miraculously&#x27; rescued from the &#x27;usurper&#x27; Boris Godunov&#x27;s alleged assassination attempt in 1591 and now returning to claim the throne from the illegitimate &#x27;false tsar&#x27; Boris.&quot;

Conspiracies were rampant after Feodor&#x27;s death. Rumors circulated that his younger brother, Dmitry, was still alive and in hiding (despite official accounts that he had been stabbed to death at an early age, by accident or by Godunov&#x27;s order). Russia&#x27;s political instability was exploited by several usurpers, known as False Dmitrys, who claimed to be the tsarevich (and heir to the tsardom). False Dmitry I appeared in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1603, claiming to be the heir to the Russian throne.

According to Dunning, &quot;The source of the pretender scheme was a conspiracy among Russian lords. When Dmitrii finally revealed himself in Poland-Lithuania in 1603, Tsar Boris openly accused the boyars of organizing the pretender scheme. There is, in fact, quite a bit of evidence linking the pretender to the Romanov clan.&quot; Dimitrii had revealed his identity to the Ukrainian magnate Prince Adam Vishnevetsky, who helped him gain the support of the Zaporozhian and Don cossacks. Jerzy Mniszech housed Dmitrii, and helped secure several witnesses testifying him to be the Tsarevich Dmitrii.

Dunning notes, &quot;King Sigismund, Polish Catholic leaders, and the Jesuits soon took great interest in reports that Dmitrii was considering conversion to Catholicism. They dreamed, among other things, of converting all of Russia and then using the Russians against Sweden.&quot;

By September 1604, Mniszech, as Dmitrii&#x27;s commander-in-chief, had gathered about 2500 men. On October 1604, they crossed the Poland-Lithuania border into Russia. According to Dunning, &quot;Dmitrii&#x27;s invasion in October 1604 triggered the first phase of Russia&#x27;s first civil war – a massive rebellion of southwestern and southern frontier provinces, towns, garrisons, and cossacks that grew into a much wider conflict that toppled the Godunov dynasty.&quot;

After Godunov&#x27;s death in 1605, False Dmitry I made a triumphal entrance into Moscow and was crowned tsar on 21 July. He consolidated power by visiting the tomb of Ivan the Terrible and the convent of Ivan&#x27;s widow, Maria Nagaya, who accepted Dimitry as her son and confirmed his story. False Dimitry I was married &quot;per procura&quot; to Marina Mniszech on 8 May 1606, in exchange for promises of land grants and wealth. He converted to Catholicism, relying on Polish Jesuits and Polish nobles (who were prominent at his court) and on Mniszech&#x27;s private armies.

==Vasili IV Shuisky==

According to Dunning, &quot;Tsar Dmitrii&#x27;s nemesis, Prince Vasilii Shuiskii, was one of the most senior and prestigious boyars whose family of Suzdal princes traced their ancestry back to Rurik…Tsar Dmitrii was a popular ruler while the conspirators represented only a relatively small group of disgruntled and ambitious individuals.&quot; Soon after Dmitrii&#x27;s entry into Moscow, Vasilii, and his brothers Dmitrii and Ivan, spread the word that the tsar was Grishka Otrepyev, a runaway defrocked monk. Vasilii was condemned to exile, but then allowed to return to Moscow, and reinstated in the boyar council. Yet, &quot;As soon as Vasilii Shuiskii returned to Moscow in late 1605, he began secretly conspiring to assassinate Tsar Dmitrii…By spring 1606, Shuskii could count on the support of some individuals at court, in the church, and among the merchant elite.&quot;

False Dmitry I quickly became unpopular, since many in Russia saw him as a tool of the Poles. On 17 May 1606, ten days after his marriage, Dmitry was killed by armed mobs during an uprising in Moscow after he was ousted from the Kremlin. Many of his Polish advisors were also killed or imprisoned during the rebellion.

Vasilii Shuiskii&#x27;s conspirators included his brothers Dmitrii and Ivan, his nephew Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky, Vasily and Ivan Golitsyn, okolnichy Ivan Kriuk-Kolychev, okolnichy Mikhail Tatishchev, monks, priests, clerics, merchants, plus trusted dvoriane and deti boiarskie from Novgorod, Pskov, Smolensk, and Moscow. Several thousand Polish wedding guests were in Moscow for the tsar&#x27;s wedding to the Polish princess Marina Mniszech. On the morning of 17 May 1606, Vasily Golitsyn and Mikhail Tatishchev led the assault on the Kremlin Frolov gate while Vasilli Shuiskii sent heralds warning Muscovites that the Poles were attempting to assassinate the tsar. A terrible massacre followed with six or seven hours of rioting in which 420 Poles were killed, and several hundred Russians. This allowed assassins to kill the tsar&#x27;s guards. The tsar, fell and broke his leg while jumping out of a window, and was shot by Mylnikov. Shuiskii then attempted to justify the assassination by demonizing the tsar, claiming he was a sorcerer and skomorokh. His corpse lay on Red Square for three days, was denied a Christian burial, and was eventually burned. Legend states that his ashes were fired from a cannon in the direction from which he had arrived to Moscow. Yet a rumor was soon started that a foreigner resembling the tsar had been killed, which soon led to another civil war in the name of the &quot;true tsar&quot; Dmitrii.
On 19 May 1606, Shuiskii&#x27;s co-conspirators met at his townhouse, planning his assumption of power, and then proceeded to Red Square where he was proclaimed tsar. According to Dunning, &quot;The narrowness of the group supporting him, his reputation as a liar, his act of regicide, his hasty seizure of power without the approval of a zemsky sobor, and his lack of any serious effort to gain the support of the common people all combined to undermine Tsar Vasilii&#x27;s credibility and to destabilize his reign from the outset.&quot; Referred to as the &quot;boyar-tsar&quot;, Shuiskii had himself crowned on 1 June, he then stripped Filaret Romanov of his office. Yet, Mikhail Molchanov escaped the assassination plot, fleeing to Putivl, where he conspired with Grigory Shakhovskoy to initiate the uprising of Bolotnikov.

According to Dunning, &quot;Both before and during the siege of Moscow, Bolotnikov had written to Prince Shakhovskoi in Putvil urging him to find Tsar Dmitri and bring him to Moscow. Unable to comply, Shakhovskoi instead at some point made contact with the large group of cossacks on the southern frontier who were headed by the self-styled &#x27;Tsarevich Petr,&#x27; the mythical son of Tsar Fedor Ivanovich who had supposedly been hidden from the evil Boris Godunov as a child and had grown up in obscurity. Shakhovskoi knew perfectly well that no such person existed, but he nevertheless invited Petr and his cossacks to hurry to Putivl to help restore Tsar Dmitrii to the throne.&quot; Shakhovskoi told Petr, that in the absence of Tsar Dmitri&#x27;s arrival, &quot;Petr could be tsar, since he was the true born son of Feodor Ivanovich and therefore the lawful heir to the realm.&quot; Tsarevich Petr was in reality Ilia Korovin, the illegitimate son of a Murom woman and the cobbler Ivan Korovin. In January 1607, Petr left Putivl for Tula with an army of 30,000. In May, Bolotnikov retreated to Tula following the siege of Kaluga. In June, Tsar Vasilii started the four-month siege of Tula.

In July 1607, a new impostor, False Dmitry II, came forward as the heir. According to Dunning, &quot;At some point, the emissary from Tsarevich Petr and Bolotnikov, Ivan Zarutsky, stepped forward, also &#x27;recognized&#x27; the tsar, and presented him with letters from the Tula leadership.&quot; On 11 October, False Dmitrii&#x27;s army occupied Kozelsk. Tula had surrendered the day before, after the Tsar&#x27;s army dammed the Upa, flooding Tula. Amongst those captured were Bolotnikov and Tsarevich Petr. Shakhovskoi and Yury Bezzubtsev also were captured, but escaped, joining the &quot;second false Dmitrii&quot;. However, Tsarevich Petr was tortured and publicly hanged outside Moscow, while Bolotnikov was executed in Kargopol.

On 29 October 1607, the &quot;second false Dmitrii&quot; was joined by a group of Polish lords, with 1800 mercenaries, followed by another group of Polish lords and mercenaries in November. According to Dunning, &quot;Also joining him at about this time was another copy-cat pretender, &#x27;Tsarevich Fedor Fedorovich,&#x27; who claimed to be Tsarevich Petr&#x27;s younger brother. Foreign mercenaries, cossacks, and some of Bolotnikov&#x27;s men from Tula, including his lieutenant Ivan Zarutsky, continued to join the army. Then in April 1608, the Ukrainian Prince Roman Rozynski joined with 4000 foreign mercenaries. In the spring, Dmitrii&#x27;s army attacked Dmitrii Vasilii&#x27;s men at Bolkhov, defeating him after a four day battle. Advancing onward to Moscow, the second false Dmitrii set up court in Tushino, and laid siege to Moscow over the next eighteen months. According to Dunning, &quot;Members of the Romanov clan, in particular, flocked to Tushino.&quot; In September 1608, Rozynski&#x27;s men covered the areas west and south of Moscow, while Jan Piotr Sapieha&#x27;s men covered the area north, defeating Prince Ivan Shuisky&#x27;s men, and besieging the Trinity-St. Sergius monastery.

According to Dunning, &quot;Russia was virtually inundated by a wave of opportunistic copy-cat tsarist pretenders during the later stages of the civil war.&quot; This included up to ten more pretenders, but the Tushino imposter brooked no rivals, hanging &quot;Tsarevich Fedor Fedorovich&quot; and &quot;Tsarevich Ivan-Avgust&quot;, who claimed to be the son of Ivan the Terrible and his fourth wife Anna Koltsovskaia.

In November 1608, a popular movement against the false Dmitrii started in Galich, and soon spread to Vologda and Kostroma, one in which Aleksander Józef Lisowski was unable to stop in the early part of 1609. In February, Tsar Vasilii was the target of an unsuccessful coup attempt by Mikhail Tatishchev, followed by another by Ivan Kriuk-Kolychev in the spring, both of whom were put to death. Then Prokofy Lyapunov declared himself the &quot;white tsar&quot;, and led a revolt from the Riazan area. In the summer of 1609, the Crimean Tatars invaded Russia capturing slaves for their markets.

In February 1609, Prince Skopin-Shuisky signed a treaty with Charles IX of Sweden&#x27;s representatives in Vyborg. In return for the use of 3000 mercenaries composed of Germans, English, Scots and French, Sweden would receive the Korela Fortress and surrounding towns and villages. On 10 May 1609, Prince Skopin-Shuisky led these mercenaries, along with 3000 Russian soldiers, from Novgorod for Aleksandrov, where he joined Fedor Sheremetev&#x27;s army advancing from Nizhnii Novgorod after retreating from Astrakhan. In September 1609, King Sigismund III Vasa of Poland invaded Russia and began the siege of Smolensk. In late December 1609, the false Dmitrii fled for Kaluga. According to Dunning, &quot;The &#x27;tsar&#x27;s&#x27; departure caused the entire Tushino camp to break up in disarray.&quot;

On 4 February 1610, the Russian lords formally in the Tushino court signed a treaty with Sigismund III, hoping to end the civil war and restore order. According to Dunning, &quot;Most Russian lords in the collapsing Tushino court came to believe that rebellion in the name of &#x27;Tsar Dmitrii&#x27; was now a lost cause. Not surprisingly, they chose to negotiate with Sigismund III. Patriarch Filaret, other members of the Romanov clan, boyar Mikhail G. Saltykov, and Mikhail Molchanov were ready to support Sigismund&#x27;s son, Wladyslaw, as tsar.&quot; Included in the Polish service were Rozynski, and Ivan Zarutsky&#x27;s cossacks. However, Prince Shakhovskoi and Jan-Piotr Sapieha brought cossacks and foreign troops to the false Dmitrii&#x27;s camp in Kaluga.

Tsar Vasilii made his brother Dmitry Shuisky his main commander following the death of Skopin-Shuisky. In June, aided by 10,000 mercenary troops supplied by King Karl, plus a spring levy, Dmitry Shuisky soon had an army of 30,000. Grigory Valuyev led an advance force of 6000 to Klushino, hoping to block Hetman Zolkiewski&#x27;s advance. However, during the De la Gardie campaign, Dmitry Shuisky and Jacob De la Gardie failed to stop Zolkiewski&#x27;s successful attack on Valuev&#x27;s camp. During the Battle of Klushino, both De la Gardie and Valuev switched sides, while the Russian army&#x27;s retreat became a rout, and the Poles advanced to Viazma. Simultaneously, the false Dmitrii&#x27;s army advanced to Kolomenskoe.

==Polish and Swedish intervention==
Tsar Vasilii was now without an army, and Prokofy Lyapunov, Vasilii Golitsyn, and Filaret Romanov, along with others, plotted the overthrow of the unpopular tsar. On 17 July, they arrested Shuiskii, forced him to become a monk, and imprisoned him in a Kremlin monastery. A council of Seven Boyars ruled, until a zemsky sobor could be convened. Yet, with the arrival of Zolkiewski&#x27;s army, and the false Dmitrii&#x27;s army threatening Moscow, according to Dunning, &quot;Up to five hundred courtiers, gentry, bureaucrats, and others traveled to Zolkiewski&#x27;s camp to negotiate...The council of seven now quickly agreed to invite Wladyslaw to rule, and on August 17, about ten thousand Russians swore an oath of loyalty to Tsar Wladyslaw.&quot;

Yet, Sigismund&#x27;s true intentions of conquering and personally ruling Russia became known after he arrested potential candidates to the throne, continued the siege of Smolensk, allowed Polish raids on Russian towns, and then established a Polish garrison composed of 800 mostly German mercenaries under the command of Alexander Gosiewski. On 11 December 1610, the false Dmitrii was killed in an act of revenge by Prince Petr Urusov, the captain of his bodyguard, while his widow Marina gave birth to his son &quot;Tsarevich Ivan Dmitrievich&quot;. Muscovites then, according to Dunning, &quot;...came to loathe Moscow&#x27;s brutal foreign rulers and the Russian traitors who assisted them.&quot;

Anti-Catholic and anti-Polish sentiment was aroused in Russia, which infuriated the pro-Polish boyars. Sweden continued the Polish–Swedish wars on the Baltic coast, ending their military alliance with Russia, and began the Ingrian War. By this time, Russia was a failed state; the throne was vacant, the nobility quarreled among themselves, the Orthodox Patriarch Hermogenes was imprisoned, Catholic Poles occupied the Kremlin, Smolensk was still besieged, and Protestant Swedes occupied Novgorod. Tens of thousands died in battles and riots as bands of brigands swarmed, and Crimean Tatar raids depopulated and devastated Russia&#x27;s southern borderlands.

According to Dunning, &quot;Almost overnight Pozharskii, Liapunov, and even Zarutskii gained enormous prestige and popularity for fighting the hated foreigners. In January 1611, Nizhni Novgorod informed Prokofy Liapunov that the town, on the advice of Pariarch Hermogen and the &#x27;entire realm,&#x27; had resolved to raise forces to liberate Moscow.&quot; Though imprisoned, &quot;...Hermogen still managed to continue stirring up the patriot cause by writing incendiary letters to Russian towns right up to his death by starvation in February 1612.&quot; The cousins King Karl and King Sigismund were acting like competing conquerors, with Sweden occupying Korela in March, and the Poles occupying Smolensk in June. On 17 July 1611, Sweden&#x27;s de la Gardie occupied Novgorod, and by early 1612, had annexed many border towns and fortresses, cutting Russia off from the Baltic Sea.
Popular discontent had increased by early 1611, and many sought to end the Polish occupation. Polish and German mercenaries suppressed riots in Moscow from 19 to 21 March 1611, massacring 7,000 people and setting the city on fire. The Polish commander Gosiewski had ordered the outer city burned, giving time for the Poles to stop the Muscovite uprising, and attacks of the &quot;national militia&quot;, when Prince Pozharskii was seriously wounded. According to Dunning, &quot;In that bloody work they were actively assisted by Mikhail G. Saltykov, members of the council of seven (especially Fedor Mstislavsky, Fedor Sheremetev, and Ivan Romanov), other nobles, and rich merchants who greatly feared their own countrymen and knew what fate awaited them if the insurgents were successful.&quot; The Polish occupation was now reduced to the Kremlin and Kitaigorod, which the Poles looted.

In the spring of 1611, the national militia was led by Prokofi Liapunov, and the Cossack leaders Dmitrii Trubetskoi and Ivan Zarutskii. On 22 July 1611 however, Liapunov was killed in a dispute with the Cossacks. Zarutskii became the militia leader, and he effectively stopped the summer offensive of Jan Karol Chodkiewicz.

False Dmitry III first appeared in Novgorod, then in Ivangorod on 23 March 1611. On 4 December 1611, this third false Dmitry arrived in Pskov. On 2 March 1612, a large number of Cossacks declared for the new false Dmitry. Yet Zarutskii viewed this new Dmitry as a threat, and organized his capture on 20 May 1612, and eventually had him hanged.

In the fall of 1611, Kuzma Minin, a butcher from Nizhny Novgorod, collected taxes from the populace, monasteries and crown peasant villages to fund a second militia (). Minin recruited Prince Dmitry Pozharsky to lead them. Yaroslavl became the headquarters of the growing militia, and seat of the new provisional government. In June 1612, Pozharskii secured a truce with Sweden, allowing his army to advance upon Moscow, arriving there on 28 July 1612. Zarutski fled to Kolomna, with Marina, Ivan, and a few Cossacks.

==Battle of Moscow==
In January 1612, part of the Polish army mutinied because of unpaid wages and retreated from Russia towards the Commonwealth. The Second Volunteer Army joined the other anti-Polish Russian forces in Moscow, besieging the Polish garrison remaining in the Kremlin. Well-armed and organised, the Second Volunteer Army took Yaroslavl in March 1612 and set up a Russian provisional government supported by a number of cities. Minin and Pozharsky entered Moscow in August 1612 when they learned that a 9,000-strong Polish army under hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz was on the way to lift the siege. On 1 September, the Battle of Moscow began; Chodkiewicz&#x27;s forces reached the city, using cavalry attacks in the open and new tactics such as a mobile tabor fort. After early successes, Chodkiewicz&#x27;s forces were driven from Moscow by Russian-aligned Don Cossack reinforcements. On 3 September, he launched another attack which reached the walls of the Kremlin; Moscow&#x27;s narrow streets halted the movement of his troops, however, and he ordered a retreat after a Russian counter-attack. On 22 September 1612, the Poles and Lithuanians took and burned Vologda killing and capturing many of its inhabitants; many other cities were also devastated or weakened.

According to Dunning, &quot;On October 26, Mstislavskii...led Ivan Romanov, Mikhail Romanov, and other sheepish aristocrats out of the Kremlin. The next day, October 27, the Polish garrison surrendered unconditionally, and national militia forces entered the capital.&quot;

==Michael Romanov and aftermath==

The Zemsky Sobor elected Michael Romanov, the 16-year-old son of Patriarch Filaret of Moscow, tsar of Russia on 21 February 1613, and was crowned on 21 July. According to Dunning, &quot;It is one of the great and tragic ironies of Russian history that the founder of the Romanov dynasty quickly put an end to the Troubles in part by crushing the very same patriotic cossacks who saved the country and brought him to power.&quot;

Romanov was connected by marriage with the Rurikids, and reportedly had been saved from his enemies by the heroic peasant Ivan Susanin. After he took power, Romanov ordered False Dmitry II&#x27;s three-year-old son hanged and reportedly had Marina Mniszech strangled to death in prison.
The Ingrian War lasted until the Treaty of Stolbovo in 1617, and the Russo-Polish War continued until the 1619 Truce of Deulino. Although Russia gained peace through treaties and preserved its independence, it was forced by Sweden and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth to make substantial territorial concessions; most, however, were recovered during the next сentury. Ingria was ceded to the Swedes (who established Swedish Ingria), and Severia and the city of Smolensk were retained by the Poles. The Time of Troubles united the Russian social classes around the Romanov tsars, laying the foundation for the later reforms of Peter the Great.

Estimates of total deaths caused by the conflict range from 1 to 1.2 million, while some areas of Russia experienced population declines of over 50%. The cultivated area in Central Russia shrank by several times. Due to the shrinking population the peasants&#x27; wages improved and the process of enserfment which had intensified in the second half of the 16th century was rolled back to a degree.

==Cultural allusions==

Unity Day was held annually on 4 November to commemorate the capitulation of the Polish garrison in the Kremlin until the rise of the Soviet Union, when it was replaced by celebrations of the October Revolution. It was reinstated by President Vladimir Putin in 2005.

The Time of Troubles has inspired artists and playwrights in Russia and abroad. The three most popular subjects are the Pozharsky-Minin liberation of Moscow, the struggle between Boris Godunov and False Dmitry I, and Ivan Susanin, a peasant who supposedly sacrificed himself to lead the Poles away from Mikhail Romanov:
* &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; (&quot;Ivan Susanin&quot; during the Soviet era), an opera by Mikhail Glinka
* &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, a play by Alexander Pushkin
** &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, an opera by Modest Mussorgsky based on Pushkin&#x27;s play
* Two operas about False Dmitriy I: &quot;Dimitrij&quot; by Antonín Dvořák and &quot;Dimitri&quot; by Victorin de Joncières, with libretti based on Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s unfinished play &quot;Demetrius&quot;
* The Monument to Minin and Pozharsky, in Red Square
* &quot;Minin and Pozharsky&quot;, a film by Vsevolod Pudovkin
* &quot;1612&quot;, a 2007 epic film by Vladimir Khotinenko

Russian and Polish artists have painted a number of works based on the period. Chester Dunning, in his 2001 book &quot;Russia&#x27;s First Civil War: The Time of Troubles and the Founding of the Romanov Dynasty&quot;, wrote that modern Russia began in 1613 with the founding of the Romanov dynasty.

<text>A randomized algorithm is an algorithm that employs a degree of randomness as part of its logic or procedure. The algorithm typically uses uniformly random bits as an auxiliary input to guide its behavior, in the hope of achieving good performance in the &quot;average case&quot; over all possible choices of random determined by the random bits; thus either the running time, or the output (or both) are random variables.

There is a distinction between algorithms that use the random input so that they always terminate with the correct answer, but where the expected running time is finite (Las Vegas algorithms, for example Quicksort), and algorithms which have a chance of producing an incorrect result (Monte Carlo algorithms, for example the Monte Carlo algorithm for the MFAS problem) or fail to produce a result either by signaling a failure or failing to terminate. In some cases, probabilistic algorithms are the only practical means of solving a problem.

In common practice, randomized algorithms are approximated using a pseudorandom number generator in place of a true source of random bits; such an implementation may deviate from the expected theoretical behavior and mathematical guarantees which may depend on the existence of an ideal true random number generator.

==Motivation==

As a motivating example, consider the problem of finding an ‘&quot;a&quot;’ in an array of &quot;n&quot; elements.

Input: An array of &quot;n&quot;≥2 elements, in which half are ‘&quot;a&quot;’s and the other half are ‘&quot;b&quot;’s.

Output: Find an ‘&quot;a&quot;’ in the array.

We give two versions of the algorithm, one Las Vegas algorithm and one Monte Carlo algorithm.

Las Vegas algorithm:
findingA_LV(array A, n)
begin
 repeat
 Randomly select one element out of n elements.
 until &#x27;a&#x27; is found
end
This algorithm succeeds with probability 1. The number of iterations varies and can be arbitrarily large, but the expected number of iterations is

:formula_1

Since it is constant, the expected run time over many calls is formula_2. (See Big Theta notation)

Monte Carlo algorithm:

findingA_MC(array A, n, k)
begin
 i := 0
 repeat
 Randomly select one element out of n elements.
 i := i + 1
 until i = k or &#x27;a&#x27; is found
end

If an ‘&quot;a&quot;’ is found, the algorithm succeeds, else the algorithm fails. After &quot;k&quot; iterations, the probability of finding an ‘&quot;a&quot;’ is:

formula_3
This algorithm does not guarantee success, but the run time is bounded. The number of iterations is always less than or equal to k. Taking k to be constant the run time (expected and absolute) is formula_2.

Randomized algorithms are particularly useful when faced with a malicious &quot;adversary&quot; or attacker who deliberately tries to feed a bad input to the algorithm (see worst-case complexity and competitive analysis (online algorithm)) such as in the Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. It is for this reason that randomness is ubiquitous in cryptography. In cryptographic applications, pseudo-random numbers cannot be used, since the adversary can predict them, making the algorithm effectively deterministic. Therefore, either a source of truly random numbers or a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator is required. Another area in which randomness is inherent is quantum computing.

In the example above, the Las Vegas algorithm always outputs the correct answer, but its running time is a random variable. The Monte Carlo algorithm (related to the Monte Carlo method for simulation) is guaranteed to complete in an amount of time that can be bounded by a function the input size and its parameter &quot;k&quot;, but allows a &quot;small probability of error&quot;. Observe that any Las Vegas algorithm can be converted into a Monte Carlo algorithm (via Markov&#x27;s inequality), by having it output an arbitrary, possibly incorrect answer if it fails to complete within a specified time. Conversely, if an efficient verification procedure exists to check whether an answer is correct, then a Monte Carlo algorithm can be converted into a Las Vegas algorithm by running the Monte Carlo algorithm repeatedly till a correct answer is obtained.

==Computational complexity==
Computational complexity theory models randomized algorithms as &quot;probabilistic Turing machines&quot;. Both Las Vegas and Monte Carlo algorithms are considered, and several complexity classes are studied. The most basic randomized complexity class is RP, which is the class of decision problems for which there is an efficient (polynomial time) randomized algorithm (or probabilistic Turing machine) which recognizes NO-instances with absolute certainty and recognizes YES-instances with a probability of at least 1/2. The complement class for RP is co-RP. Problem classes having (possibly nonterminating) algorithms with polynomial time average case running time whose output is always correct are said to be in ZPP.

The class of problems for which both YES and NO-instances are allowed to be identified with some error is called BPP. This class acts as the randomized equivalent of P, i.e. BPP represents the class of efficient randomized algorithms.

==Early history==

=== Sorting ===
Quicksort was discovered by Tony Hoare in 1959, and subsequently published in 1961. In the same year, Hoare published the quickselect algorithm, which finds the median element of a list in linear expected time. It remained open until 1973 whether a deterministic linear-time algorithm existed. 

=== Number theory ===
In 1917, Henry Cabourn Pocklington introduced a randomized algorithm known as Pocklington&#x27;s algorithm for efficiently finding square roots modulo prime numbers.
In 1970, Elwyn Berlekamp introduced a randomized algorithm for efficiently computing the roots of a polynomial over a finite field. In 1977, Robert M. Solovay and Volker Strassen discovered a polynomial-time randomized primality test (i.e., determining the primality of a number). Soon afterwards Michael O. Rabin demonstrated that the 1976 Miller&#x27;s primality test could also be turned into a polynomial-time randomized algorithm. At that time, no provably polynomial-time deterministic algorithms for primality testing were known. 

=== Data structures ===
One of the earliest randomized data structures is the hash table, which was introduced in 1953 by Hans Peter Luhn at IBM. Luhn&#x27;s hash table used chaining to resolve collisions and was also one of the first applications of linked lists. Subsequently, in 1954, Gene Amdahl, Elaine M. McGraw, Nathaniel Rochester, and Arthur Samuel of IBM Research introduced linear probing, although Andrey Ershov independently had the same idea in 1957. In 1962, Donald Knuth performed the first correct analysis of linear probing, although the memorandum containing his analysis was not published until much later. The first published analysis was due to Konheim and Weiss in 1966.

Early works on hash tables either assumed access to a fully random hash function or assumed that the keys themselves were random. In 1979, Carter and Wegman introduced universal hash functions, which they showed could be used to implement chained hash tables with constant expected time per operation. 

Early work on randomized data structures also extended beyond hash tables. In 1970, Burton Howard Bloom introduced an approximate-membership data structure known as the Bloom filter. In 1989, Raimund Seidel and Cecilia R. Aragon introduced a randomized balanced search tree known as the treap. In the same year, William Pugh introduced another randomized search tree known as the skip list.

=== Implicit uses in combinatorics ===
Prior to the popularization of randomized algorithms in computer science, Paul Erdős popularized the use of randomized constructions as a mathematical technique for establishing the existence of mathematical objects. This technique has become known as the probabilistic method. Erdős gave his first application of the probabilistic method in 1947, when he used a simple randomized construction to establish the existence of Ramsey graphs. He famously used a more sophisticated randomized algorithm in 1959 to establish the existence of graphs with high girth and chromatic number.

==Examples==

===Quicksort===
Quicksort is a familiar, commonly used algorithm in which randomness can be useful. Many deterministic versions of this algorithm require &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;2) time to sort &quot;n&quot; numbers for some well-defined class of degenerate inputs (such as an already sorted array), with the specific class of inputs that generate this behavior defined by the protocol for pivot selection. However, if the algorithm selects pivot elements uniformly at random, it has a provably high probability of finishing in &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) time regardless of the characteristics of the input.

===Randomized incremental constructions in geometry===
In computational geometry, a standard technique to build a structure like a convex hull or Delaunay triangulation is to randomly permute the input points and then insert them one by one into the existing structure. The randomization ensures that the expected number of changes to the structure caused by an insertion is small, and so the expected running time of the algorithm can be bounded from above. This technique is known as randomized incremental construction.

===Min cut===
Input: A graph &quot;G&quot;(&quot;V&quot;,&quot;E&quot;)

Output: A cut partitioning the vertices into &quot;L&quot; and &quot;R&quot;, with the minimum number of edges between &quot;L&quot; and &quot;R&quot;.

Recall that the contraction of two nodes, &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot;, in a (multi-)graph yields a new node &quot;u&quot; &#x27; with edges that are the union of the edges incident on either &quot;u&quot; or &quot;v&quot;, except from any edge(s) connecting &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot;. Figure 1 gives an example of contraction of vertex &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.
After contraction, the resulting graph may have parallel edges, but contains no self loops.
Karger&#x27;s basic algorithm:
 begin
 i = 1
 repeat
 repeat
 Take a random edge (u,v) ∈ E in G
 replace u and v with the contraction u&#x27;
 until only 2 nodes remain
 obtain the corresponding cut result Ci
 i = i + 1
 until i = m
 output the minimum cut among C1, C2, ..., Cm.
 end
In each execution of the outer loop, the algorithm repeats the inner loop until only 2 nodes remain, the corresponding cut is obtained. The run time of one execution is formula_5, and &quot;n&quot; denotes the number of vertices.
After &quot;m&quot; times executions of the outer loop, we output the minimum cut among all the results. The figure 2 gives an
example of one execution of the algorithm. After execution, we get a cut of size 3.


==== Analysis of algorithm ====

The probability that the algorithm succeeds is 1 − the probability that all attempts fail. By independence, the probability that all attempts fail is
formula_6

By lemma 1, the probability that is the probability that no edge of &quot;C&quot; is selected during iteration &quot;i&quot;. Consider the inner loop and let denote the graph after &quot;j&quot; edge contractions, where . has vertices. We use the chain rule of conditional possibilities.
The probability that the edge chosen at iteration &quot;j&quot; is not in &quot;C&quot;, given that no edge of &quot;C&quot; has been chosen before, is formula_7. Note that still has min cut of size &quot;k&quot;, so by Lemma 2, it still has at least formula_8 edges.

Thus, formula_9.

So by the chain rule, the probability of finding the min cut &quot;C&quot; is
formula_10

Cancellation gives formula_11. Thus the probability that the algorithm succeeds is at least formula_12. For formula_13, this is equivalent to formula_14. The algorithm finds the min cut with probability formula_15, in time formula_16.

==Derandomization==
Randomness can be viewed as a resource, like space and time. Derandomization is then the process of &quot;removing&quot; randomness (or using as little of it as possible). It is not currently known if all algorithms can be derandomized without significantly increasing their running time. For instance, in computational complexity, it is unknown whether P = BPP, i.e., we do not know whether we can take an arbitrary randomized algorithm that runs in polynomial time with a small error probability and derandomize it to run in polynomial time without using randomness.

There are specific methods that can be employed to derandomize particular randomized algorithms:
* the method of conditional probabilities, and its generalization, pessimistic estimators
* discrepancy theory (which is used to derandomize geometric algorithms)
* the exploitation of limited independence in the random variables used by the algorithm, such as the pairwise independence used in universal hashing
* the use of expander graphs (or dispersers in general) to &quot;amplify&quot; a limited amount of initial randomness (this last approach is also referred to as generating pseudorandom bits from a random source, and leads to the related topic of pseudorandomness)
* changing the randomized algorithm to use a hash function as a source of randomness for the algorithm&#x27;s tasks, and then derandomizing the algorithm by brute-forcing all possible parameters (seeds) of the hash function. This technique is usually used to exhaustively search a sample space and making the algorithm deterministic (e.g. randomized graph algorithms)

==Where randomness helps==
When the model of computation is restricted to Turing machines, it is currently an open question whether the ability to make random choices allows some problems to be solved in polynomial time that cannot be solved in polynomial time without this ability; this is the question of whether P = BPP. However, in other contexts, there are specific examples of problems where randomization yields strict improvements.
* Based on the initial motivating example: given an exponentially long string of 2&quot;k&quot; characters, half a&#x27;s and half b&#x27;s, a random-access machine requires 2&quot;k&quot;−1 lookups in the worst-case to find the index of an &quot;a&quot;; if it is permitted to make random choices, it can solve this problem in an expected polynomial number of lookups. 
* The natural way of carrying out a numerical computation in embedded systems or cyber-physical systems is to provide a result that approximates the correct one with high probability (or Probably Approximately Correct Computation (PACC)). The hard problem associated with the evaluation of the discrepancy loss between the approximated and the correct computation can be effectively addressed by resorting to randomization
* In communication complexity, the equality of two strings can be verified to some reliability using formula_17 bits of communication with a randomized protocol. Any deterministic protocol requires formula_18 bits if defending against a strong opponent.
* The volume of a convex body can be estimated by a randomized algorithm to arbitrary precision in polynomial time. Bárány and Füredi showed that no deterministic algorithm can do the same. This is true unconditionally, i.e. without relying on any complexity-theoretic assumptions, assuming the convex body can be queried only as a black box.
* A more complexity-theoretic example of a place where randomness appears to help is the class IP. IP consists of all languages that can be accepted (with high probability) by a polynomially long interaction between an all-powerful prover and a verifier that implements a BPP algorithm. IP = PSPACE. However, if it is required that the verifier be deterministic, then IP = NP.
* In a chemical reaction network (a finite set of reactions like A+B → 2C + D operating on a finite number of molecules), the ability to ever reach a given target state from an initial state is decidable, while even approximating the probability of ever reaching a given target state (using the standard concentration-based probability for which reaction will occur next) is undecidable. More specifically, a limited Turing machine can be simulated with arbitrarily high probability of running correctly for all time, only if a random chemical reaction network is used. With a simple nondeterministic chemical reaction network (any possible reaction can happen next), the computational power is limited to primitive recursive functions.

<text>The Nekromantix is a Danish-American psychobilly band founded in Copenhagen in 1989. Their lyrics are generally structured around monster and horror themes. A central icon of the band&#x27;s image is founder and frontman Kim Nekroman&#x27;s &quot;coffinbass&quot;, a custom-built double bass with a body in the shape of a coffin and a headstock the shape of a cross. Nekroman has been the sole constant member of the band. The current lineup consists of guitarist Francisco Mesa and drummer Mike Mata.

The Nekromantix released five albums on various European record labels during their first decade, then crossed over to American audiences in the early 2000s by signing to Los Angeles–based Hellcat Records, through which they have released three albums since 2002. Their eighth studio album, &quot;What Happens in Hell, Stays in Hell&quot;, was released in August 2011.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
The Nekromantix were formed in 1989 in Copenhagen by Kim Nekroman after he left the Danish Navy, in which he had been a submarine radio operator for eight years. Deciding to launch a new career in music, he initially played drums in a rockabilly band prior to the foundation of Nekromantix.

Learning to play the double bass and to sing, Nekroman set about forming a horror-themed psychobilly band with himself as the frontman. Initially consisting of Nekroman, guitarist Paolo Molinari and drummer Jens Brygman, the band took the name Nekromantix.

A centerpiece of the band&#x27;s image was Nekroman&#x27;s self-constructed &quot;coffinbass&quot;, an upright bass in the shape of a coffin. The first of these was constructed using an actual child-sized coffin, but over the years he has constructed new models in order to achieve better acoustics and collapsibility for easier transportation. By the time of the band&#x27;s first official recordings, Molinari had been replaced by Peter Sandorff.

After six months of practice and two local performances in Copenhagen at the Stengade 30 club, the Nekromantix appeared at large psychobilly festival in Hamburg, Germany. Their performance earned them a recording contract with Tombstone Records for their first album &quot;Hellbound&quot;. The band began touring Europe and built a name for themselves in the European psychobilly movement, which at the time was largely dominated by British acts. In 1991 the band released their second album &quot;Curse of the Coffin&quot; through Nervous Records and supported it with a music video for the title track which received some play on the MTV program &quot;Alternative Nation&quot;.

=== Lineup changes ===
In 1992 both Jensen and Sandorff left the band. They were replaced by guitarist Jan Daggry and drummer Tim Kristensen, who used the stage names Ian Dawn (&quot;Dawn&quot; being an English translation of the Danish name Daggry) and Grim Tim Handsome. This lineup recorded the album &quot;Brought Back to Life&quot;, released in 1994, which earned a Grammy Award nomination for &quot;Best Heavy Metal Album&quot;.

Daggry then left the band and was replaced on tour first by Emil Oelund and then by Tormod Holm, until the band found new permanent guitarist Søren Munk Petersen. The Nekroman/Petersen/Kristensen lineup recorded 1996&#x27;s &quot;Demons Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;. During this time the band toured most of Europe including Finland, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden and France, and also toured Japan. They began to achieve cult status in the United States, where their albums were as yet only available as imports.

At a 1996 festival in Cologne, Germany, Nekroman met fellow Copenhagen native Patricia Day, with whom he launched a new band called HorrorPops with himself on guitar and Day on double bass and lead vocals. The two would later marry, and their activity with HorrorPops put the Nekromantix on hold for several years, during which time Kristensen and Petersen both left the band.

=== International success ===
In 1997 Peter Sandorff returned to Nekromantix, bringing along his brother, Kristian, to play drums. In 1999 the band played a tenth-anniversary performance at Stengade 30 in Copenhagen, where they had performed their first shows after forming the band. This performance was recorded by Danish National Radio for a series of live shows and released the following year as the live album &quot;Undead &#x27;n&#x27; Live&quot;. In 2000 the Nekromantix played their first performances in the United States, beginning with the first annual New York City &quot;Psychobilly Rumble&quot; and continuing with a nine-date tour of the west coast.

In February 2001 Nekroman gave a demo of new songs to Rancid singer/guitarist and Hellcat Records label owner Tim Armstrong, a longtime fan of the band. The Nekromantix soon signed to the Los Angeles–based Hellcat and released the 2002 album &quot;Return of the Loving Dead&quot;. Recorded in Denmark, it was the band&#x27;s first album to be widely distributed in the U.S. and helped make them part of an emerging psychobilly movement on the west coast centered around the Hellcat label and spearheaded by bands such as Tiger Army. The album was supported with a music video for the song &quot;Gargoyles Over Copenhagen&quot; and the band toured the United States several times.

=== Move to the United States ===

Following the release of &quot;Return of the Loving Dead&quot; Nekroman relocated to Los Angeles, touring and recording two albums with the HorrorPops. The Sandorff brothers remained in Denmark, and recording of the Nekromantix&#x27; 2004 album &quot;Dead Girls Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; was done almost entirely in Los Angeles, with only Peter Sandorff&#x27;s backing vocals recorded in Copenhagen. In April 2005 the Sandorffs left the band leaving only Nekroman in band. To replace them Nekroman recruited guitarist Troy Russel (Tröy Deströy) and drummer James Mesa (Wasted James) of the California-based psychobilly band the Rezurex. That year the band&#x27;s third album &quot;Brought Back to Life&quot; was remastered and re-released by Hellcat under the title &quot;Brought Back to Life Again&quot;.

=== Recent activity ===
In May 2006 Meza left the Nekromantix, later joining Tiger Army. He was replaced by Andrew Martinez (Andy DeMize) of The Rocketz. &quot;Life Is a Grave &amp; I Dig It!&quot; was released in April 2007. In November 2007 the band announced Tröy Deströy&#x27;s departure to focus on a solo career. Pete Belair of the Australian band Firebird was announced as the band&#x27;s new guitarist and performed with them during their 2008 tours, living in Australia complicated things and Francisco Mesa, formerly of Barcelona-based Nightbreed and Ultimo Asalto, joined as a permanent guitarist.
On 11 January 2009, Martinez was killed in an automobile collision. The following month it was announced that Lux, formerly of Mystery Hangup and Sacred Storm, would be Martinez&#x27;s replacement. The band&#x27;s first female member, Lux stated that the Nekromantix would tour North America with Reverend Horton Heat during the summer and record a new album later in the year. The band&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;What Happens in Hell, Stays in Hell&quot;, was released 2 August 2011. The band will support the album with a tour of the United States from July to September 2011. In April 2014, it was announced that Lux would depart from the band. It was later announced in June 2014 that Adam Guerrero, formerly of Rezurex, would replace Lux as the new Nekromantix drummer. In October 2017, Guerrero departed from the band and Lux returned to fill in for a few shows. In April 2018 it was announced that Rene &quot;Delamuerte&quot; Garcia, from The Brains and BAT! would be the new Nekromantix drummer.

<doc id="495385" wikidata="Q2862901" url="?curid=495385" title="Army of the Shenandoah (Union)">
<text>The Army of the Shenandoah was a field army of the Union Army active during the American Civil War. First organized as the &quot;Department of the Shenandoah&quot; in 1861 and then disbanded in early 1862, the army became most effective after its recreation on August 1, 1864 under the command of Philip Sheridan. The army&#x27;s actions during the Valley campaigns of 1864 rendered the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia unable to produce foodstuffs for the Confederate States Army, a condition which would hasten the conclusion of the American Civil War.

==History==

=== 1861–2 ===
Under the command of Major General Robert Patterson before the three-month enlistments of a majority of its troops expired, the Department of Pennsylvania operated as the lone element of Union Army in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. After achieving a tactical victory at the Battle of Hoke&#x27;s Run on July 2 and contributing indirectly to the Union disaster at the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, its unexpired regiments and commanders were absorbed into a new &quot;Department of the Shenandoah&quot; under the command of Major General Nathaniel P. Banks on July 25, 1861. Neither Patterson nor Banks referred to his commands as the &quot;Army of the Shenandoah&quot; in official correspondence, and when the Army of the Potomac adopted a Corps structure on March 18, 1862, Banks&#x27; command was redesignated as the &quot;Fifth Corps.&quot;

===1864===
On May 21, 1864, Major General David Hunter was appointed to command the Department of West Virginia. Hunter designated the field forces of his department the &quot;Army of the Shenandoah&quot;. Hunter was in command of the Army of the Shenandoah from May 21 to July 3 which consisted of two infantry divisions and two cavalry divisions. The First and Second Infantry Divisions were commanded by Brigadier Generals Jeremiah C. Sullivan and George Crook respectively. The First and Second Cavalry Divisions were commanded by Brigadier Generals Julius Stahel (succeeded by Alfred N. Duffie) and William W. Averell respectively. In May Crook&#x27;s and Averell&#x27;s divisions fought independently at the battle of Cloyd&#x27;s Mountain. Hunter personally led Sullivan&#x27;s and Stahel&#x27;s divisions at the battle of Piedmont. All four divisions were joined for the battle of Lynchburg. On July 3, George Crook assumed command of both infantry divisions and designated this as a new field army named the Army of the Kanawha.

The force was next created by order of Ulysses S. Grant on August 1, 1864, in response to a raid by Jubal Early and his Confederate army of 15,000 on Washington, D.C., and especially his defeat of Lew Wallace at the Battle of Monocacy Junction. The new Army of the Shenandoah was composed of the Union VI Corps (commanded by Horatio G. Wright), XIX Corps (William H. Emory), and George Crook&#x27;s Army of West Virginia (VIII Corps). It was placed under Sheridan&#x27;s command with orders to repel Early, deal with Confederate guerillas, and press on into the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia.

Early, ever the cunning strategist, kept his force moving so as not to be trapped by Sheridan&#x27;s vastly superior force. His raid had, if anything, a good deal of success for southern morale. Confederate General Robert E. Lee, coming to the conclusion that Early had done all that was practical, ordered Early to return two of his divisions to Richmond and remain to tie up Sheridan. Learning of this, Sheridan waited until Early weakened himself and then attacked at the Third Battle of Winchester on September 19 and then again at the Battle of Fisher&#x27;s Hill on September 20–21. By the end of these battles, Early&#x27;s force was effectively out of the war, and Sheridan proceeded with his secondary orders to destroy the ability of the Shenandoah Valley to produce foodstuffs for the Confederacy, torching farms and more than 2,000 mills.

Reinforced again in reaction to the threat of Sheridan&#x27;s 31,000-man army, Early moved against Sheridan once more. After a decisive cavalry victory by Union forces under Brig. Gen. George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of Tom&#x27;s Brook, Early&#x27;s army launched a surprise attack against Sheridan at the Battle of Cedar Creek on October 19. Initially successful, the Confederates were repelled by a Union counterattack and the Valley was firmly under Union control.

Following those battles in the fall of 1864, the majority of the Army of the Shenandoah was detached to Grant at Petersburg and to William Tecumseh Sherman in Georgia. Sheridan joined Grant for the Appomattox campaign where Sheridan commanded the Army of the Shenandoah, which included two divisions of cavalry commanded by Wesley Merritt. In late April 1865, command of the army then passed to Brig. Gen. A. T. A. Torbert until July 12, 1865, when the force was disbanded for the final time.

<text>In electronics, a limiter is a circuit that allows signals below a specified input power or level to pass unaffected while attenuating (lowering) the peaks of stronger signals that exceed this threshold. Limiting is a type of dynamic range compression. Clipping is an extreme version of limiting.

Limiting is any process by which the amplitude of a signal is prevented from exceeding a predetermined value.

Limiters are common as a safety device in live sound and broadcast applications to prevent sudden volume peaks from occurring. Limiters are also used as protective features in some components of sound reinforcement systems (e.g., powered mixing boards and power amplifiers) and in some bass amplifiers, to prevent unwanted distortion or loudspeaker damage.

Limiting can refer to a range of treatments designed to limit the maximum level of a signal. Treatments in order of decreasing severity range from clipping, in which a signal is passed through normally but sheared off when it would normally exceed a certain threshold; soft clipping which squashes peaks instead of shearing them; a hard limiter, a type of variable-gain audio level compression, in which the gain of an amplifier is changed very quickly to prevent the signal from going over a certain amplitude or a soft limiter which reduces maximum output through gain compression.

== Usage ==

=== In aerospace and military ===

For military two-way radio sets and aircraft VHF voice telecommunications, the voice limiter is known as a vogad. It is designed to work with high levels of background noise near the microphone. One form operates by up-converting the audio signal to an ultrasonic frequency, hard limiting that signal, and
then down converting the result. The frequency conversion uses image-cancelling heterodyning. The advantage of clipping the supersonic signal is that the odd harmonics
produced will still be out-of-band when down converted. This is in contrast to standard hard limiting, as in an electric guitar fuzz box, where the harmonics are highly audible. This device ultimately gives a distinctive character to the voice communication, which despite being highly distorted, ensures spoken words remain clear.

=== In audio production ===
Bass instrument amplifiers and power amplifiers are more commonly equipped with limiter circuitry to prevent overloading the power amplifier and to protect speakers. Electric guitar amps do not usually have limiters.

PIN diodes can be used in limiter circuits to reflect the energy back to the source or clip the signal.

Mastering engineers often use limiting combined with make-up gain to increase the perceived loudness of an audio recording during the audio mastering process.

==== FM radio ====
An FM radio receiver usually has at least one stage of amplification that performs a limiting function. This stage provides a constant level of signal to the FM demodulator stage, reducing the effect of input signal level changes to the output. If two or more signals are received at the same time, a high-performance limiter stage can greatly reduce the effect of the weaker signals on the output. This is commonly referred to as the FM capture effect.

Generally, FM demodulators are not affected by amplitude variations, since the baseband is contained in the frequency deviations. Some detectors, including the ratio detector, inherently limit gain by the nature of the circuit design. In AM radio, the information is located in the amplitude variations, and distortion can occur due to spurious signals that could cause the baseband to be misrepresented.

=== In utilities ===
In Canada, while the cold weather rule is in effect, limiters are used to lower the capacity of houses of non-paying customers. The limiters allow enough power to run a furnace and a few lights. Tampering with the limiter is illegal.

<text>Adventure Soft is a British video game developer and publisher established by Mike Woodroffe, initially as an importer and reseller of Adventure International games as Adventure International (UK), and later using the names Horror Soft, Adventuresoft UK and Headfirst Productions.
The firm operates out of Sutton Coldfield, and is best known for the &quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot; series of games.

== Adventure International UK ==
Woodroffe, who owned a music shop in Birmingham, entered the software industry by opening a computer department within the store, Calisto Computers, importing American software which was otherwise unavailable in the UK. The success of many of the titles from Adventure International led to Woodroffe licensing the name from Scott Adams to form Adventure International (UK). The company employed Brian Howarth, the author of the &quot;Mysterious Adventures&quot; series of text adventures, to convert Adams&#x27; titles to run on microcomputers found in the United Kingdom market which were not currently supported.

By 1985, the release of games by Adventure International had slowed and the company began to write other games using the same system. The first and most successful of these was &quot;Gremlins – The Adventure&quot; (1985), written by Howarth and based on the film &quot;Gremlins&quot;. Adventure International UK also secured the rights to Howarth&#x27;s &quot;Mysterious Adventures&quot; series from Channel 8 Software who had been taken over by Argus Press Software. Several of these games were licensed for release by Tynesoft, who also published Howarth and Woodroofe&#x27;s &quot;Supergran: The Adventure&quot;, their first title to be published by a third party.

Further deals were signed, including a game based on the television series &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot;, and the licence to produce games based on the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; gamebooks by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone. The first &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; title released was &quot;Seas of Blood&quot; by Woodroffe and Howarth with &quot;Appointment with F.E.A.R.&quot; reported as the next conversion.

==Adventuresoft UK==

By 1986 Adventure International in the U.S. was bankrupt, leaving the UK company unable to continue trading under that name. A new company was formed, Adventuresoft UK, whose first title was their second &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; conversion, &quot;Rebel Planet&quot;, written by Stefan Ufnowski and published by U.S. Gold. U.S. Gold published further Adventuresoft titles over the next few years, including Ufnowski&#x27;s &quot;Kayleth&quot; (based on story in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot; magazine, &quot;Temple of Terror&quot; by Woodroffe and &quot;Masters of the Universe: The Super Adventure&quot;. In 1988, Adventuresoft also worked with U.S. Gold to produce &quot;Heroes of the Lance&quot; based on the first &quot;Dragonlance&quot; campaign module for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game. Adventuresoft also created &quot;Blizzard Pass&quot;, the first game by Alan Cox which was bundled with the ZX Spectrum +2 by some retailers. Cox later developed parts of the game into &quot;AberMUD&quot;.

==Horror Soft==
With the rise of more powerful systems like the Amiga and a growing disinterest in text-focused games, Woodroffe created Horror Soft to actively exploit the graphical and multimedia angle of the games.

Their first 16-bit game, &quot;Personal Nightmare&quot;, features music, animation and some mouse control coupled with a traditional text-based game system. It was followed by two games based around Elvira, Mistress of the Dark: &quot;&quot; and &quot;Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus&quot;, and &quot;Waxworks&quot;, all of which moved away from keyboard command input to mouse-driven gaming with animation and music from Jezz Woodroffe (a session musician with Robert Plant, Black Sabbath and other bands).

==Adventure Soft Publishing==
Adventuresoft was remodelled as Adventure Soft Publishing in 1992, although the company wasn&#x27;t incorporated until 1998
and the company continued to be referred to as Adventuresoft in the gaming press. The company continuing the trend towards more graphical gaming with the release of &quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot;, their most successful game. The game uses a new engine, the &quot;Adventure Graphic Operating System&quot;, written by Alan Cox and based on &quot;AberMUD&quot;. It also includes voice acting from Roger Blake and Chris Barrie as Simon who played Arnold Rimmer in &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. Barrie was replaced by Brian Bowles for the sequel when Barrie’s fees became unaffordable. In 1997 Adventure Soft released &quot;The Feeble Files&quot;, with the lead character being voiced by Robert Llewellyn who played Kryten also in &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;.

== Headfirst Productions ==
In 1998 Mike and Simon Woodroffe set up Headfirst Productions to allow them to develop non-adventure style games. The company released &quot;Simon the Sorcerer 3D&quot; in 2002 and &quot;Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth&quot; in 2005. The intellectual property rights to &quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot; remained with Adventure Soft, so were unaffected when Headfirst first went into administration the following year.

<doc id="495399" wikidata="Q6258392" url="?curid=495399" title="John Smith House, Southwark">
<text>John Smith House is the former Labour Party headquarters at 144–152 Walworth Road in south London. The party first occupied the building in 1980, vacating its former headquarters at Transport House.

It was renamed in memory of John Smith, the former leader of the Labour Party who died in office in May 1994, less than two years after becoming leader.

==History==
Between 1995 and 1997, the Labour Party moved most of its functions from John Smith House to Millbank Tower, which became its official headquarters at the end of 1997, shortly after it formed a new government after winning the general election. The Labour Party Archive and Library moved in 1990 from Walworth Road to join the People&#x27;s History Museum. John Smith House was formerly used by Southwark Local Education Authority before becoming the party headquarters. 

Planning permission was granted in 2010 to turn it into the Safestay budget hotel, which opened in 2012.

<text>Guntis Ulmanis (born 13 September 1939) is a Latvian politician and the fifth President of Latvia from 1993 to 1999.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Guntis Ulmanis was born in Riga on 13 September 1939. His great uncle Kārlis Ulmanis was one of the most prominent Latvian politicians during the interwar period, in 1934 he established authoritarian regime and subsequently adopted title of the president of Latvia. In 1941 following the Soviet occupation, Guntis Ulmanis and his family were deported to Krasnoyarsk Krai, Siberia, Russian SFSR.

In 1946, they returned to Latvia, but were not allowed to settle in Riga, so they stayed at Ēdole in the Kuldīga area of the Latvian SSR.

In 1949, the remainder of the Ulmanis family was supposed to be deported in the upcoming March deportation, but Guntis Ulmanis was able to avoid that fate, as his mother remarried and his surname was changed to Rumpītis. In 1955 upon receiving his first passport Ulmanis chose to use his birth surname.

They then moved to Jūrmala, where he attended school. After graduating, he entered the economic faculty of the Latvian State University.

===Career in Latvia===
After completing his studies in the university in 1963, he was drafted into the Soviet army, where he served for two years. In 1965 he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He began working as an economist at a construction site and was later promoted to tram and trolleybus administrator in Riga.

He was then advanced to the position of deputy chairman of the planning committee of the Riga Executive Committee (city government). However, his family ties with President Ulmanis were discovered and he was sacked in 1971.

He then worked at lower positions in the Riga municipal service system. For some time he worked as a teacher of construction economics at the Riga Polytechnical Institute and of economic planning at the Latvian State University.

In 1989, during the Singing Revolution, Guntis Rumpītis quit the Communist Party and returned to using his original surname – Ulmanis. In 1992, he was appointed Council Member of the National Bank of Latvia.

He also joined the Latvian Farmers&#x27; Union, his great-uncle&#x27;s party, the same year. In 1993, following the first elections to the Saeima in 62 years, he was elected as the 5th President of Latvia (the first since the full restoration of independence in 1991). In the first round of the indirect election, he finished third (after Gunārs Meierovics and Aivars Jerumanis), but won in the runoff as Meierovics quit the race.

===Presidency===

As President, Guntis Ulmanis focused on foreign policy, building relations with international and regional organizations, as well as other countries. A major achievement was the conclusion of the Latvian-Russian treaty on the withdrawal of Russian Armed Forces from Latvia.

During his presidency, Latvia joined the Council of Europe and sent its application to the European Union. He announced a moratorium on the death penalty, in accordance with the norms of the European Council.

In 1996, he was re-elected in the first round of elections, defeating Saeima speaker Ilga Kreituse, Imants Liepa and former Communist Party chairman Alfrēds Rubiks, who was in jail at the time.

In 1998 President Ulmanis actively supported amendments to the Citizenship law, that would allow all people born after 21 August 1991 to obtain citizenship and would eliminate so-called &quot;naturalization limits&quot; (in which only a limited number of non-citizenship could receive citizenship within a given year). However, he was forced to send the law project on a referendum, after 36 nationalistic deputies, opposed to the amendment petitioned him to do so. He then actively and successfully campaigned for the adoption of the amendments by the population.

===Retirement and subsequent return to politics===
Guntis Ulmanis&#x27; term finished in 1999 and he was succeeded by Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga. He retired from politics but became a social activist, founding the Guntis Ulmanis Fund, organizing the 2006 IIHF World Championship in Riga and heading the Riga Castle reconstruction council.

2010 marked a return to big politics for Guntis Ulmanis. He became the chairman of the newly created party alliance For a Good Latvia, which was composed of the People&#x27;s Party and Latvia&#x27;s First Party/Latvian Way. The alliance won only 8 seats in the October 2010 parliamentary election.

However, Ulmanis became a Saeima deputy. In 2011 he announced he did not want to run for another term as a deputy in the 2011 election. He, therefore, ceased being a deputy in November 2011, after the 11th Saeima was inaugurated.

==Personal life==

Guntis Ulmanis has been married to Aina Ulmane (maiden name Štelce) since 1962. They have two children: Guntra (b. 1963) and Alvils (b. 1966) and three grandchildren.

<doc id="495418" wikidata="Q3023437" url="?curid=495418" title="James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle">
<text>James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle KB (c. 1580March 1636) was a Scottish courtier and English nobleman.

==Life==
He was the son of Sir James Hay of Fingask, second son of Peter Hay 3rd of Megginch (a branch member of Hay of Leys, a younger branch of the Erroll family) and his wife Margaret, daughter of Crichton of Ruthven. His mother was Margaret Murray, cousin of George Hay, afterwards 1st Earl of Kinnoull.

His aunts married well and had two well regarded uncles. His uncle Peter Hay of Megginch married Margaret Ogilvie, daughter of Sir Patrick Ogilvie of Inch, and are the ancestors of the later Earls of Kinnoull via their son, his first cousin Peter of Kirklands of Megginch. His uncle Edmund Hay was Professor of Scots Law at Douay.

He was knighted and taken into favour by James VI of Scotland, brought into England in 1603, treated as a &quot;prime favourite&quot; and made a gentleman of the bedchamber. In 1604, he was sent on a mission to France and pleaded for the Huguenots, which annoyed Henry IV of France and caused a substantial reduction of the present made to the English envoy. On 21 June 1606, he was created by patent a baron for life with precedence next to the barons, but without a place or voice in Parliament, no doubt to render his advancement less unpalatable to the English lords.

The king bestowed on him numerous grants, paid his debts, and secured for him a rich bride in the person of Honora Denny, only daughter and heir of Edward, Lord Denny. Their marriage was celebrated by &quot;Lord Hay&#x27;s Masque,&quot; staged on 6 January 1607. On 9 February 1608 he performed in the masque &quot;The Hue and Cry After Cupid&quot; at Whitehall Palace as a sign of the zodiac, to celebrate the wedding of John Ramsay, Viscount Haddington to Elizabeth Radclyffe. In 1610 he was made a Knight of the Bath, and in 1613 master of the wardrobe. He danced in &quot;The Somerset Masque&quot; on 26 December 1613. In 1615 he was created Lord Hay of Sawley, and took his seat in the House of Lords.

Honora, Lady Hay was favourite of Anne of Denmark and they enjoyed the company of a Venetian diplomat and musician Giulio Muscorno. Muscorno quarrelled with the ambassador Antonio Foscarini and it was said that the queen and Lady Hay promoted Muscorno&#x27;s cause. Honora, Lady Hay died in 1614 and was buried on 16 August at Waltham Abbey.

Hay was sent to France in 1616 to negotiate the marriage of Princess Christina with Prince Charles. Before he left London news arrived that the French fashion in clothing had changed and his outfits would have to be remade. Lady Haddington made a joke about his companions, that there were three mignards; himself, Sir Henry Rich and Sir George Goring, three dancers; Sir Gilbert Hawten, John Auchmoutie, and Abercromby, and three fools or buffoons; Sir Thomas German, Sir Ralph Shelton, and Sir Thomas Badger. On his return, being now a widower, he was made a Privy Councillor.

In February 1617 he presented a masque by Ben Jonson, &quot;Lovers Made Men&quot;, to the French ambassador Baron de Tour at his house in London. The performance was staged by the Countess of Bedford and said to have cost £2200. Later that year, he married Lady Lucy Percy (1599–1660), daughter of Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland (the famous &quot;Wizard Earl&quot;), by his wife Dorothy Devereux.
In 1618 he resigned the mastership of the wardrobe for a large sum in compensation. He was created Viscount Doncaster, and in February 1619 was despatched on a mission to Germany, where during the beginning Thirty Years&#x27; War he identified himself with the cause of the &quot;Winter King&quot;, Elector Frederick V of the Palatinate, and urged James to make war in his support. In 1621 and 1622 he was sent to France to obtain peace for the Huguenots from Louis XIII, in which he was unsuccessful, and in September 1622 was created Earl of Carlisle.

Next year he went to Paris on the occasion of Prince Charles&#x27;s journey to Madrid, and again in 1624 to join Henry Rich, afterwards Lord Holland, in negotiating the prince&#x27;s marriage with Henrietta Maria, when he advised James without success to resist Richelieu&#x27;s demands on the subject of religious toleration. In 1624 he was made a knight of the Order of the Garter. Charles&#x27;s marriage in 1625 was by proxy, so the wedding contract was signed by Carlisle and Holland. The king&#x27;s representative at the actual wedding was the duke of Chevreuse, yet Carlisle and Holland acted as witnesses.

Carlisle became gentleman of the bedchamber to King Charles I after his accession. In 1628, after the failure of the expedition to Rhe, he was sent to make a diversion against Cardinal Richelieu in Lorraine and Piedmont; he counselled peace with Spain and the vigorous prosecution of the war with France, but on his return home found his advice neglected. He took no further part in public life, and died in March 1636.

Carlisle was a man of good sense and of accommodating temper, with some diplomatic ability. His extravagance and lavish expenditure, his double suppers and costly entertainments, were the theme of satirists and wonder of society, and his debts were said at his death to amount to more than £80,000. A lavish banquet for the French ambassador in 1621 at Essex House involved sweetmeats costing £500 and ambergris used in cooking costing £300, and the total bill was £3,300.

Clarendon said he left a reputation of a very fine gentleman and a most accomplished courtier, and after having spent, in a very jovial life, above £400,000, which upon a strict computation he received from the crown, he left not a house or acre of land to be remembered by.

==Colonial proprietor==
Hay by 1612 was a director of the Virginia Company. He was a patentee and councillor of the plantation of New England, and showed great interest in the colonies.

Carlise also had an interest in the Caribbean. There James Ley, 1st Earl of Marlborough was a rival, who had to be bought off. Another rival was the Earl of Montgomery. On 2 July 1627 Carlisle obtained from the king a grant of all the Caribbean Islands, including Barbados, this being a confirmation of a former concession given by James I. A colonial plantation venture on Barbados was led in 1628 by Marmaduke Roydon, a prominent City of London merchant and one of Carlisle&#x27;s major creditors.

==Family==
Hay&#x27;s first wife was Honoria Denny. His second wife, Lucy Hay, Countess of Carlisle, was involved in many conspiracies, or allegations thereof, during the English Civil War.

The first earl was succeeded by James, his only surviving son by his first wife. James married Margaret Russell, third daughter of Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford, but James died without issue on 30 October 1660. At his death, the peerage became extinct in the Hay family.

<text>Daniel Bell (May 10, 1919 – January 25, 2011) was an American sociologist, writer, editor, and professor at Harvard University, best known for his contributions to the study of post-industrialism. He has been described as &quot;one of the leading American intellectuals of the postwar era&quot;. His three best known works are &quot;The End of Ideology&quot; (1960), &quot;The Coming of Post-Industrial Society&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism&quot; (1976).

==Biography==

===Early life===
Daniel Bell was born in 1919 in the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City. His parents, Benjamin and Anna Bolotsky, were Jewish immigrants, originally from Eastern Europe. They worked in the garment industry.  His father died when he was eight months old, and he grew up poor, living with relatives along with his mother and his older brother Leo.  When he was 13 years old, the family&#x27;s name was changed from Bolotsky to Bell.

===Education===
Bell was graduated from Stuyvesant High School. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the City College of New York in 1938, and completed graduate work at Columbia University during the 1938–1939 academic year. He received a PhD in sociology from Columbia in 1961 after he was permitted to submit &quot;The End of Ideology: On the Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the Fifties&quot; (a 1960 essay collection), instead of a conventional doctoral dissertation.

===Career===
Bell began his professional life as a journalist, being managing editor of &quot;The New Leader&quot; magazine (1941–1945), labor editor of &quot;Fortune&quot; (1948–1958), and later, co-editor (with his college friend Irving Kristol) of &quot;The Public Interest&quot; magazine (1965–1973). In the late 1940s, Bell was an instructor in the Social Sciences in the college of the University of Chicago. During the 1950s, it was close to the Congress for Cultural Freedom. Subsequently, he taught sociology, first at Columbia (1959–1969) and then at Harvard until his retirement in 1990. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1964 and a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1978.

Bell also was the visiting Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions at Cambridge University in 1987. He served as a member of the President&#x27;s Commission on Technology in 1964–1965 and as a member of the President&#x27;s Commission on a National Agenda for the 1980s in 1979.

Bell served on the board of advisors for the &quot;Antioch Review&quot;, and published some of his most acclaimed essays in the magazine: &quot;Crime as an American Way of Life&quot; (1953), &quot;Socialism: The Dream and the Reality&quot; (1952), &quot;Japanese Notebook&quot; (1958), &quot;Ethics and Evil: Frameworks for Twenty-First Century Culture&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Reconstruction of Liberal Education: A Foundational Syllabus&quot; (2011).

Bell received honorary degrees from Harvard, the University of Chicago, and fourteen other universities in the United States, as well as from Edinburgh Napier University and Keio University in Japan. He also received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Sociological Association in 1992, and the Talcott Parsons Prize for the Social Sciences from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1993. He was given the Tocqueville Award by the French government in 1995.

Bell was a director of Suntory Foundation and a scholar in residence of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Bell once described himself as a &quot;socialist in economics, a liberal in politics, and a conservative in culture.&quot;

==Scholarship==
Bell is best known for his contributions to post-industrialism. His most influential books are, &quot;The End of Ideology&quot; (1960), &quot;The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism&quot; (1976), and &quot;The Coming of Post-Industrial Society&quot; (1973). Two of his books, the &quot;End of Ideology&quot; and the &quot;Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism&quot;, were listed by the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; as among the 100 most important books in the second half of the twentieth century. Besides Bell, only Isaiah Berlin, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Albert Camus, George Orwell, and Hannah Arendt had two books so listed.

===&quot;The End of Ideology&quot;===
In &quot;The End of Ideology&quot; (1960), Bell suggests that the older grand humanistic ideologies, derived from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, are exhausted and that new more parochial ideologies will soon arise. With the rise of affluent welfare states and institutionalized bargaining between different groups, Bell maintains, revolutionary movements that aim to overthrow liberal democracy will no longer be able to attract the working classes.

===&quot;The Coming of Post-Industrial Society&quot;===
In &quot;The Coming of Post-Industrial Society: A Venture in Social Forecasting&quot; (1973), Bell outlined a new kind of society, the post-industrial society. He argued that post-industrialism would be information-led and service-oriented. Bell also argued that the post-industrial society would replace the industrial society as the dominant system.

There are three components to a post-industrial society, according to Bell:
* a shift from manufacturing to services,
* the centrality of the new science-based industries,
* the rise of new technical elites and the advent of a new principle of stratification.

Bell also conceptually differentiates between three aspects of the post-industrial society: data, or information describing the empirical world; information, or the organization of that data into meaningful systems and patterns such as statistical analysis; and knowledge, which Bell conceptualizes as the use of information to make judgments. Bell discussed the manuscript of &quot;The Coming of Post-Industrial Society&quot; with Talcott Parsons before its publication.

===&quot;The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism&quot;===
In &quot;The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism&quot; (1976), Bell contends that the developments of twentieth-century capitalism have led to a contradiction between the cultural sphere of consumerist instant self-gratification and the demand, in the economic sphere, for hard-working, productive individuals. Bell articulates this through his &quot;three realms&quot; methodology, which divides modern society into the cultural, economic, and political spheres.

Bell&#x27;s concern is that, with the growth of the welfare state throughout the post-war years, more and more of the population demand that the state fulfil the hedonistic desires which the cultural sphere encourages. That dovetails with the ongoing requirement for the state to maintain the kind of strong economic environment conducive to continual growth. For Bell, the competing, contradictory demands place excessive strain on the state that was manifest in the economic turbulence, fiscal pressure, and political upheaval characteristic of the 1970s. Written at a time of significant shifts in U.S. politics, &quot;The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism&quot; offers reasons for the crisis of post-war liberalism.

==Personal life==
His first two marriages to Nora Potashnick and Elaine Graham ended in divorce. In 1960, Bell married Pearl Kazin, a scholar of literary criticism, and sister of Alfred Kazin. She was also Jewish. Bell&#x27;s son, David Bell, is a professor of French history at Princeton University, and his daughter, Jordy Bell, was an academic administrator and teacher of, among other things, U.S. Women&#x27;s history at Marymount College, Tarrytown, New York, before her retirement in 2005.

He died at home in Cambridge, Massachusetts on January 25, 2011.

<doc id="495441" wikidata="Q663673" url="?curid=495441" title="Château de Vincennes">
<text>The Château de Vincennes () is a former fortress and royal residence next to the town of Vincennes, on the eastern edge of Paris, alongside the Bois de Vincennes. It was largely built between 1361 and 1369, and was a preferred residence, after the Palais de la Cité, of French kings in the 14th to 16th century. It is particularly known for its &quot;donjon&quot; or keep, a fortified central tower, the tallest in Europe, built in the 14th century, and for the chapel, Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes, begun in 1379 but not completed until 1552, which is an exceptional example of Flamboyant Gothic architecture. Because of its fortifications, the château was often used as a royal sanctuary in times of trouble, and later as a prison and military headquarters. The chapel was listed as an historic monument in 1853, and the keep was listed in 1913. Most of the building is now open to the public.

==History==
===12th–14th century – Louis VII to Saint Louis ===
The first royal residence was created by an act of Louis VII in 1178. The site had the advantages of good hunting in the surrounding forest, proximity to two former Roman roads to Sens and to Lagny, as well as access by water on the Marne and Seine rivers. It was used only occasionally by Louis VII and his successors, but Louis IX, or Saint Louis (1226–1270), used it much more often, second only to his time at the Palais de la Cité in Paris. He held meetings of the royal council there, and Queen Margaret of Provence and his children often resided there when he was absent from Paris. When Louis IX purchased the reputed Crown of Thorns from the Emperor Baldwin of Constantinople, Louis received the celebrated relic at Sens Cathedral, escorted it to Vincennes, and then accompanied it to its eventual home in the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. A few thorns from the crown of thorns and a small fragment of the reputed True Cross were deposited at Vincennes for placement in a future chapel. Louis IX said farewell to his family at Vincennes before his departure to the Crusades, from which he did not return.
The château was frequented by the Kings and their families. Philip III (in 1274) and Philip IV (in 1284) were each married there and three 14th-century kings died at Vincennes: Louis X (1316), Philip V (1322) and Charles IV (1328). The residence at the time was a sprawling manor with four wings located in the northeast corner of the present château walls, begun in the late 13th century. It was transferred to the clergy of the Saint-Chapelle after the Keep was completed; vestiges were found during excavations in 1992–1996.

=== 14th century – Fortress of Jean II and Charles V ===
The defeats of the French and the capture of the King by the English in the Hundred Years War, as well as uprisings of the Parisian merchants under Etienne Marcel (1357–58) and a rural upraising against the crown, the Jacquerie (1360), persuaded the new French king, John II and his son, the future Charles V, that they needed a more secure residence close to, but not in the center of Paris. The King ordered the construction of a fortress at Vincennes with high walls and towers surrounding a massive keep or central tower, 52 meters (172 feet) high. The work was started in about 1337, and by 1364 the three lower levels of the keep were finished. Charles V moved into the keep in 1367 or 1368, while construction was still underway. When it was completed in 1369–70, it was the tallest fortified structure in Europe. The digging of the deep moat came next (1367), then the fortified gateway (1369). The walls and towers surrounding the keep were finished in 1371–72.

Charles V had even greater ambitions for the château. At the end of 1372, he began construction of another wall, a large square more than a kilometre () in length, with towers, to contain the additional buildings he intended to build. This was constructed between 1372 and 1385. The outer wall was given further reinforcement with the construction of a deep moat. The last project begun by Charles the V was laying the foundations of the Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes to hold a set of sacred relics obtained by Louis IX, but he died in 1380 in the Manoir de Beauté, a separate residence he had constructed in 1376–1377 southeast of Vincennes, when the work on the new Sainte-Chapelle had just begun.

===Late 14th – Late 15th century – Wars of Religion – Royal fortress and refuge – La Sainte Chapelle ===

In the turbulent 15th century, the château became a refuge for the kings of France. It was the regular residence of Charles VI of France up until his madness, then was disputed by the two rivals of his succession, Philip the Good of Burgundy and Louis I, Duke of Orléans. In 1415 the knights of Henry V of England defeated the French at the Battle of Agincourt. The Treaty of Troyes in 1420 granted the château and the Île-de-France to the English. Henry V of England installed his troops there, repaired the château, and died there of dysentery in 1422, aged 35.

An alliance between the Burgundians with Charles VII of France finally allowed the King to force the English out of the Île-de-France and to reoccupy the château. He and his successors rarely lived there, preferring the Loire Valley. His successor, Louis XI, also spent most of his time in the Loire Valley, but he made one major modification to Vincennes: He constructed a new royal residence within the walls, the first outside of the keep. It extended the entire length of the southeast wall.

The Sainte-Chapelle of Vincennes, begun in 1379, was still unfinished in the 16th century. In 1520 King Francis I, a frequent resident, resolved to complete it to celebrate the birth of his son and heir. After his death in 1547, Henry II of France took up the work, finishing the vaults, and adding the woodwork and especially the stained glass. It was completed in 1552.

=== 17th and early 18th century – new royal residences ===

In the early 17th century, Marie De&#x27; Medici, the widow of the assassinated Henry IV of France, began a major project to replace the old pavilion of Louis XI and Francis I. Her son Louis XIII, then age ten, laid the first stone of the new residence in 1610. Louis XIV continued the program on an even larger scale; planned by the royal architect Louis Le Vau. His new residence in the French classical style, now the Batiment du Roi, was finished in 1658, and was twice the size of the Louis XIII residence. In 1688, work began on a new pavilion of the Queen, on the north side of the enclosure. A new formal garden with an orangerie, was built on the west side. A large group of painters and sculptors was assembled to decorate the new buildings. The ensemble was completed with a triumphal arch at the entrance, and was dedicated in August 1660, in time for the return of the King and his new bride to Paris. But the age of royal glory at Vincennes was brief; in 1682 Louis XIV moved the royal court to his residence at Versailles, and in 1715 Louis XV began his reign in Versailles. While the boy king was taken by the Regent Philippe II, Duke of Orléans to the château for several months in 1715 to keep him safe from conspiracies, and the King subsequently went hunting occasionally at Vincennes, the full Court did not return.

=== 18th – early 19th century – Manufactory, prison, fortress ===

Following the royal departure in the early 18th century, an effort was made to turn the château into a sort of pre-industrial park; the royal porcelain manufactory was opened in the Devil&#x27;s Tower in 1740, but moved to a larger space in Sèvres in 1756. It was home for a time of an armaments factory, then an industrial bakery. It was used occasionally for horse races from 1777 until 1784. In 1787 the King put most of the buildings up for sale, but the sale was interrupted by the French Revolution. The château took on a new role as a military base and prison. 

Long before the French Revolution, notable prisoners had been held at the château. Early prisoners included the future King Henry IV in 1574, Henri II, Prince of Condé; Nicolas Fouquet, the Superintendent of Finances of Louis XIV (September 1661); and the writer Denis Diderot. In 1680 Catherine Deshayes Monvoisin or La Voisin was one of more famous poisoners tortured and imprisoned at the château during the Affair of the Poisons. 

The Marquis de Sade was held there from 1777 to 1784, the writer Honoré Mirabeau from 1777 to 1784, and the famous swindler Jean Henri Latude, who escaped twice from the Vincennes and once from the Bastille. In 1784, after Mirabeau wrote a series of articles which exposed the abuses of the royal judicial system and the practice of keeping prisoners without trial, the use of the keep as a prison was discontinued. 

At the end of February 1791, a mob of more than a thousand workers from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, encouraged by members of the Cordeliers Club and led by Antoine Joseph Santerre, marched out to the château, which, rumour had it, was being readied on the part of the Crown for political prisoners, and with crowbars and pickaxes set about demolishing it, as the Bastille had recently been demolished. The work was interrupted by the Marquis de Lafayette who took several ringleaders prisoners, to the jeers of the Parisian workers.

Following the French Revolution, the château was denounced as a symbol of oppression, but then was used again by Napoleon I to hold prisoners transferred from the Temple Prison in Paris, Napoleon demolished the Temple prison to prevent it from becoming a royalist shrine to Marie Antoinette, who had been held there. Two historical items from the Temple Prison are displayed at Vincennes; an armoured prison cell door, and a stove of ceramic tiles which had originally been in the cell of Marie Antoinette.

During the reign of Napoleon, the château and its buildings underwent considerable reconstruction to serve as a military arsenal. A new wooden floor divided the Sainte-Chapelle into upper and lower levels, and it was turned into a storehouse for munitions. The Pavilion of the King and the Pavilion of the Queen became barracks for the garrison. Most of the towers of the surrounding wall, which were in a poor state of repair, were demolished, with the exception of the Tower of the Village, which still has its original height, and the Tower of the Woods, which had collapsed earlier. The moat of the château was also the site of a famous execution, that of Duc d&#x27;Enghien, which took place on 21 March 1804. He was accused of trying the reinstate the royal government. A willow tree in the moat was planted to mark the place he was executed, and is still there today. 
In 1814, after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in Russia, as the allied armies of the Sixth Coalition approached Paris, the château was commanded by General Pierre Daumesnil. Daumesnil had a wooden leg, replacing a limb he lost at the Battle of Wagram (5–6 July 1809). When the allies demanded his surrender, Daumenil responded, &quot;I shall surrender Vincennes when I get my leg back&quot;. He finally agreed to give up the fortress only when ordered to do by the newly restored king, Louis XVIII.

=== Late 19th – military base and public park ===
During the Restoration and the July Monarchy, in the first half of the 19th century, the château and park were used by military, particularly the artillery; an artillery school was opened there in 1826. The surrounding park was used for military exercises and as a firing range. In the first part of the 19th century three separate forts were constructed within the park to serve as part of the defences of the city. In the mid-century, the separate forts were connected together into one very large military complex. The buildings of the château itself and its surroundings were the park as part of the new fortifications of the city. Some parts of the medieval complexes were modified to fit into the new defensive plan.

Under Napoleon III, the Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes was declared an historical landmark, and in 1854 restoration of the chapel was begun by Eugene Viollet-le-Duc. The keep of the château was given landmark status in 1913, though restoration did not begin until after the First World War.

Beginning just before 1860, Napoleon III also began to develop an extensive new public park to the southeast of Paris, the Bois de Vincennes, modelled after the Bois de Boulogne he had begun on the other side of the city. The territory of the Bois de Vincennes, with the exception of the military bases, was ceded to the City of Paris on 24 July 1860, and became part of the 12th arrondissement of Paris.

On March 20, 1871, two days after the Paris Commune seized power in the city, Commune soldiers came to the château and fraternised with the regular army soldiers. The château surrendered to the Commune without a fight. A few weeks later, on 27 May, after the regular French Army had recaptured Paris from the Commune, the château was the last holdout where the red flag still flew. A colonel of the regular army arrived and negotiated the surrender of the remaining Communards. The soldiers left peacefully, while some of the officers who had joined the Commune were arrested, tried and shot in the moat of the château. A plaque on the wall of the moat marks the place. 

=== 20th century – Command post ===
During the First World War, the Dutch-born German spy Mata Hari was executed by a firing squad on October 15, 1917, in the moat of the château.

The restoration of the château was halted in 1936 by concerns about the rising threat from Nazi Germany. Beginning in that year, a large underground bunker was dug beneath the Pavilion of the Queen in the southeast corner, to serve as the headquarters of the chief of staff. The generals Maurice Gamelin and then Maxime Weygand directed the defense of France from there, until they were overwhelmed by the German Blitzkrieg. France surrendered on June 14, 1940. The Germans then used it as a base for their own soldiers, as well as a prison where French Resistance members were held. One of the first members of the French Resistance, Jacques Bonsergent, was tried and executed there on November 10, 1940. On 20 August 1944, during the battle for the Liberation of Paris, 26 policemen and members of the Resistance arrested by soldiers of the Waffen-SS were executed in the eastern moat of the fortress, and their bodies thrown in a common grave.

On the evening of August 24, 1944, the same day that the 2nd Armoured Division of General Leclerc reached the centre of Paris, the German forces occupying the château set off explosives in the three storage areas of munitions, badly damaging the Pavilions of the King and Queen and opening a gap in the wall between the entry pavilion and tower of Paris, before they withdrew. The next day the 4th U.S Infantry Division reached the château and the eastern neighbourhoods of Paris.

In 1948 the château became the headquarters of France&#x27;s Defence Historical Service, which maintains a museum in the keep. A major campaign began in 1986 to preserve and restore the architectural heritage of the château.

==Plan and description==
Only traces remain of the earlier castle and the substantial remains date from the 14th century. The castle forms a rectangle whose perimeter is more than a kilometer in length (). It has six towers and three gates, each originally high, and is surrounded by a deep stone lined moat. The towers of the &quot;grande enceinte&quot; now stand only to the height of the walls, having been demolished in the 1800s, save the &quot;Tour du Village&quot; on the north side of the enclosure. The south end consists of two wings facing each other, the &quot;Pavillon du Roi&quot; and the &quot;Pavillon de la Reine&quot;, built by Louis Le Vau.

=== The Keep ===

The Donjon or Keep of Vincennes was finished in 1369–70. It is high, the highest of its kind in Europe. Its walls are wide on each side, and at each corner is tower in diameter, the same height as the building. An additional tower, the height of the rest, is attached to the north of the northwest tower, providing support the whole structure and also containing latrines for all five levels of the keep. The wall at the base of the keep are 3.26 meters, or ten feet, thick. It served as both a royal residence and a very visible symbol of royal power.

The keep is one of the first known examples of rebar usage. Each of the eight floors has a central room about ten meters on each side. with a height varying from . Each of the lower four floors have a central column which reinforces the vaulted ceiling. The columns were decorated with sculpture and painted in bright colors.

One striking feature of the construction was the use of iron bars to strengthen the structure. More than two and half kilometres () of iron bars, in various shapes, were built into the structure. Iron bars reinforced the doorways, windows and the ceilings of the corridors, and, unusually, belts of iron bars surrounded the entire tower at the ground level, fifth level and sixth level.

In the Middle Ages the only access to the Keep was on the first floor, by a bridge from the terrace of the chatelet, where the King&#x27;s offices were located. A narrow stairway, within the south wall. The two entrances on the ground floor were not added until the 18th century. When the keep was given an additional floor, and grand stairway was built connecting the two noble floors, the first and second.

=== Keep interior ===

* The ground floor of the Keep has wells and the remains of a large fireplace. It was probably originally used by royal servants. It was largely rebuilt when the building was used as a prison.
* The first floor contained the meeting hall of the Council of the King, and was also used when needed for bedchambers of the Queen and others close to the King. The walls were originally covered with oak panels, some of which are still in place. Studies of the wood indicate that it was cut between 1367 and 1371 in the Baltic region or present-day Poland.
* The second floor was occupied by the bedchamber of the King, and has vestiges of the decoration added by Charles V of France when he rebuilt it 1367–38. The walls were originally covered with oak panels, and the vaulted ceiling was decorated with sculpted keystones and consoles and painted fleurs-de-lys and the coat-of-arms of the King, against a blue background, still visible. A small oratory is set into the north wall, though its wood panelling has disappeared.
* The third floor has the same plan as the second, but lacks the ornate decoration of the royal floor. It was probably used by important guests of the King.
* The fourth, fifth and sixth floors, which lack ornament, were probably used by domestic servants or soldiers. They were also used to store munitions for the weapons placed at the windows of the fourth floor and on the terraces of tower of latrines and the main body of the keep. The sixth floor has no windows and a ceiling only two meters high, and a single entrance. Beginning in 1752, the upper floors were used primarily as prison cells. The bars in the windows and doors date from that period. The extensive and elaborate graffiti still found on the walls on the upper floors also dates from the 17th and 18th century.

=== Wall of the Keep and Entry Pavilion ===
The Keep is surrounded by a rectangular stone wall, or &quot;enceinte&quot; about long one each side, high, and thick. It is crenelated at the top level with a walkway that was originally open but was given a tile roof in the 15th century and then the present slate roof. At each of the four corners is an Echauguette, a small watch tower that protrudes outward, to give better oversight of the walls. In the northeast corner of the walkway, next to the chatelet, is a group of rooms which originally were part of the working office of the King, on the second floor of the chatelet. They include a small chapel, a hall, and a chamber.

=== The Sainte-Chapelle ===

The Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes, the royal chapel of the residence, was built on the model of the Sainte Chapelle of the Palais de la Cité in Paris, though the plan was modified to have a single level, rather than two. Work began under Charles V of France in 1379, at the end of his reign. The exterior and interior sculpture was largely finished between 1390 and 1410. The west front was finished last; work was resumed in 1520, and it was inaugurated by Henry II of France in 1552. The west front is a good example of the late Gothic Flamboyant style, with three gabled arches one atop the other, framing and echoing the elaborate curling designs of the rose window. The stained glass windows of the interior reflected the changing style; the windows of the choir were Rayonnant Gothic, while those of the nave were Flamboyant.

The Chapel suffered particularly from the vandalism of the French Revolution. Most all of the stained glass and the sculpture on tympanum and portals was smashed, but a few notable examples of 15th century sculpture survived, notably a sculpture of the Holy Trinity in the upper arches over the west portal. The outside walls are supported by enormous buttresses between the windows, each crowned by an ornate spire, giving them additional weight. 
The nave and choir of the interior form a single vessel with five traverses. The oratories of the King and Queen are placed just before the choir. The summit of the vaults, where the ribs meet, are decorated with ornamental keystones, some with the coats-of-arms of Isabeau of Bavaria and Charles V of France. The painted decoration on some of the later vaults displays the H of Henry II of France and a K for Catherine de&#x27; Medici.

The stained glass windows of the nave were installed between 1556 and 1559. Those in the nave were almost entirely destroyed in the French Revolution; only drawings remain. Some of the windows of the apse survived. They illustrate the Apocalypse as recounted in the Gospel of Saint John. They were substantially restored in the 19th century under Louis Napoleon and again the 20th century.

== The Pavilions of the King and Queen ==

Louis XIII built the King&#x27;s pavilion in the southwest corner between 1610 and 1617 near the beginning of his reign. Only the west façade of this building is still visible. In 1654–58, the royal architect Louis Le Vau enlarged the building surrounding the old structure with a new structure, in the French classical style. The new building has the same length as the old pavilion, but is twice as wide. The Pavilion of the Queen was built between 1658 and 1660, following the same basic design.

The Pavilion of the King, three stories high, was built at the edge of a garden. The apartment of the King had five rooms, located on the first floor, looking west over the garden. The Queen&#x27;s apartment in her pavilion followed the same plan, overlooking the courtyard. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the interiors fell into disrepair, then were almost totally destroyed, with the exception of some portions of the painted ceilings; the Germans had stored explosives in the two pavilions, and these exploded in fires set by the departing occupiers in August 1944.

Fortunately, some portions of the painted and sculpted ceilings of the royal pavilions were saved in the 19th century; King Louis Philippe had a ceiling dismantled and transported from Vincennes to the Louvre, where it was installed in room 639, a display of Egyptian Antiquities, where it can be seen today.

<text>Labrisomids are small blennioids (blennies), percomorph marine fish belonging to the family Labrisomidae. Found mostly in the tropical Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, the family contains about 110 species in 15 genera.

Stockier than the average blenny, labrisomids are elongated nonetheless; their dorsal fin spines outnumber soft rays (which may be absent altogether), and their pelvic fins are long and slender. Like many other blennies, labrisomids have whisker-like structures called cirri on their heads and napes. Scales may be cycloid or absent in labrisomids; many species are brightly coloured. &quot;Labrisomus philippii&quot; is the largest species at 35 cm in length; most are far smaller.

Generally staying within shallow coastal regions to depths around 10 m, labrisomids are benthic fish spending most of their time on or near the bottom. Both sandy and rocky substrates are frequented, sometimes at reefs or amongst beds of seagrass. Labrisomids are shy fish and will retreat into crevices if threatened. Crustaceans, gastropods, brittle stars, and sea urchins make up much of the labrisomid diet.

Two genera of labrisomid are noted for their ovoviviparity; &quot;Xenomedea&quot; and &quot;Starksia&quot; both retain eggs within their oviducts, where they develop in safety. However, only &quot;Starksia&quot; species possess gonopodia (modified anal fins used as a copulatory organ). 

Some workers have found that the Labrisomidae is paraphyletic.

==Genera==
The following genera are currently included in this family:
* &quot;Alloclinus&quot; 
* &quot;Auchenionchus&quot; 
* &quot;Brockius&quot; 
* &quot;Calliclinus&quot; 
* &quot;Cottoclinus&quot; 
* &quot;Cryptotrema&quot; 
* &quot;Dialommus&quot; 
* &quot;Exerpes&quot; 
* &quot;Gobioclinus&quot; 
* &quot;Haptoclinus&quot; 
* &quot;Labrisomus&quot; 
* &quot;Malacoctenus&quot; 
* &quot;Nemaclinus&quot; 
* &quot;Paraclinus&quot; 
* &quot;Starksia&quot; 
* &quot;Xenomedea&quot;

<doc id="495444" wikidata="Q3839050" url="?curid=495444" title="Lucy Hay, Countess of Carlisle">
<text>Lucy Hay, Countess of Carlisle (née Percy; 15995 November 1660) was an English courtier known for her beauty and wit. She was involved in many political intrigues during the English Civil War.

==Life==
She was born Lady Lucy Percy, the second daughter of Henry, Earl of Northumberland (the famous &quot;Wizard Earl&quot;) and his wife Lady Dorothy Devereux. In 1617, she became the second wife of James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle. Her charms were celebrated in verse by contemporary poets, including Thomas Carew, William Cartwright, Robert Herrick and Sir John Suckling, and by Sir Toby Matthew in prose.

In 1626, she was appointed Lady of the Bedchamber to Henrietta Maria, Queen of England. She soon became a favourite of the queen, and participated in two of her famous masque plays.
She was a conspicuous figure at the court of King Charles I. A contemporary scandal made her the mistress successively of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, and of John Pym, his parliamentary opponent. Strafford valued her highly, but after his death in 1641, possibly in consequence of a revulsion of feeling at his abandonment by the court, she devoted herself to Pym and the interests of the parliamentary leaders, to whom she communicated the king&#x27;s most secret plans and counsels.

Her greatest achievement was the timely disclosure to her cousin Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, of the king&#x27;s intended arrest of the five members of the Long Parliament in 1642, which enabled Essex and the others to escape. However, she appears to have served both parties simultaneously, betraying communications on both sides, and doing considerable mischief by inflaming political animosities.

In 1647, she attached herself to the interests of the moderate Presbyterian party, which assembled at her house, and in the Second Civil War showed great zeal and activity in the royal cause, pawning her pearl necklace for £1500 to raise money for Lord Holland&#x27;s troops, establishing communications with Prince Charles during his blockade of the Thames, and making herself the intermediary between the scattered bands of royalists and the queen. As a result, her arrest was ordered on 21 March 1649, and she was imprisoned in the Tower of London, where she maintained a correspondence in code with the king through her brother, Lord Percy, until Charles went to Scotland. According to a royalist newsletter, while in the Tower, she was threatened with torture on the rack to gain information. She was released on bail on 25 September 1650, but appears never to have regained her former influence in the royalist counsels, and died soon after the Restoration.

She died suddenly on 5 November 1660; after &#x27;dining well&#x27; at lunchtime she fell suddenly sick around 2pm whilst &#x27;cutting a piece of ribbon&#x27;. She was dead by 5 or 6pm that same day.

== In literature ==
François de La Rochefoucauld mentioned in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; an anecdote he was told by Marie de Rohan, in which Lucy Hay stole some diamond studs (a present of the king of France to Anne of Austria) the queen had given to George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham from the duke as revenge because he had loved her before he loved the queen of France. The king of France then wanted to see the studs and somehow the queen was able to recover them. Alexandre Dumas later used this entire story, and therefore he probably based Milady de Winter on Lucy Carlisle in his 1844 novel &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;.

She was the subject of Sir John Suckling&#x27;s risqué poem &quot;Upon My Lady Carlisle&#x27;s Walking in Hampton Court Garden.&quot;

<text>Jānis Kristaps Čakste (; 14 September 1859 – 14 March 1927) was a Latvian politician and lawyer who served as the first head of an independent Latvian state as the Chairman of the People&#x27;s Council (1918–1920), the Speaker of the Constitutional Assembly (1920–1922), and as the first President of Latvia (1922–1927).

== Youth ==
Čakste was born in the Lielsesava parish of Dobele county in Courland Governorate, the son of a farmer. He received his primary education at St Anne&#x27;s Primary School, and entered the Academia Petrina in Jelgava, where he participated in student &quot;evenings&quot; advocating Neo-Latvian ideals. After graduating in 1882, he entered the law faculty of Moscow University. While studying in Moscow, Čakste founded a local Latvian Student Society in 1883, which later became the academic fraternity &quot;Austrums&quot; and actively participated in the activities of the local Latvian community along with Krišjānis Valdemārs and Fricis Brīvzemnieks. Čakste graduated in 1886 and returned to Jelgava.

== Career and entry into politics ==

After graduating from St. Petersburg State University, he worked at the legal department of the Courland Governorate and, from 1888, as a doctor in Jelgava. In 1889 he became the editor of the newspaper &quot;Tēvija&quot;, which became one of the most widely read Latvian-language newspapers in Courland. In 1895 he became one of the chief organisers of the 4th All-Latvian Song Festival in Jelgava, and partly financed the event out of his own pocket. In the course of the Russian Revolution of 1905 he collaborated on a project for creating Latvian national autonomy within the Russian Empire.
In 1906 he was elected to the First State Duma of the Russian Empire where he joined the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party. When the latter was dissolved by the czar, Čakste was one of its 166 members who signed the so-called Vyborg Manifesto, calling for non-violent resistance to the czarist regime. As a result, he was arrested together with other former Duma members and, after the trial, served three months in prison.

In 1915 Čakste moved to Tartu where he co-founded the Central Committee for Latvian Refugee Affairs and in 1917 became its chairman. In 1915 Čakste organised a demonstration to honour Major General Aleksey Potapov, the commanding officer of the defence of Jelgava, who later became one of the advocates of the formation of the Latvian Rifles. In 1917 Čakste departed for the United States on a tour to propagate the idea of Latvian independence, but the trip was cut short in Stockholm with the news of the Russian Revolution. In Stockholm he published a pamphlet &quot;Die Letten und ihre Latvia: Eine lettische Stimme&quot;, where he declared that “the Latvian nation wants to…achieve…its freedom with certainty to lead in Latvia its own national, cultural, and economic development.”

In the autumn of 1917 Čakste worked in the foreign department of the Provisional Latvian National Council, where he prepared addresses to foreign governments protesting against the German occupation of Baltic territories. On 17 November 1918 at the first session of the Latvian Tautas Padome, conceived as a representative body of the new Latvian state, Čakste was elected its chairman &quot;in absentia&quot;, as he was at his country home at the time. While informed of his election, he did not manage to arrive in time for the declaration of Latvian independence the next day, and the act was proclaimed by the vice-chairman, Gustavs Zemgals.

In 1919 Čakste travelled to the Paris Peace Conference, establishing relations with foreign diplomats and even attempting to draft a request for reparations from Germany – which did not receive support from the Entente states. On 13 July 1919 he returned to Latvia and assumed his duties as the Chairman of the Tautas Padome (the National Assembly). While undertaking his responsibilities as a statesman, Čakste continued teaching at the law school of the newly founded University of Latvia. In November 1919 he was given the rank of full professor, but in 1924 – the degree Dr. jur. honoris causa.

== First head of state of an independent Latvia ==
After the first free elections to the Constitutional Assembly of Latvia, Čakste was elected its Speaker on 1 May 1920, thus again assuming the role of the provisional head of the Latvian state. His runner-up in the elections was the renowned poet and Social Democrat deputy Rainis. Two years later, at the first session of the first Saeima of Latvia on 7 November 1922 Čakste was elected unopposed as the first President of the Republic of Latvia, with 92 Saeima members voting for his candidacy and 6 against – the highest number of votes ever given to a candidate in a Latvian presidential election. As President, Čakste&#x27;s responsibilities were largely ceremonial, even though he continued to pay close attention to foreign affairs, especially to the international position of Latvia as a young European state in the world. During his tenure, he promulgated 402 laws, sent three laws back to the Saeima for review, and pardoned 549 people. He caused some controversy in 1926 when he pardoned a prominent writer and a former head of the rival pro-German Latvian puppet government Andrievs Niedra, who was serving a sentence for treason. However, Čakste also insisted on Niedra&#x27;s leaving the country after the pardon.

For the presidential elections of 1925, Čakste&#x27;s name was proposed by his Democratic Centre party, while Rainis was put forward by the Social Democrats and Kārlis Ulmanis – by the Latvian Farmers&#x27; Union. In the first round, the incumbent president finished third, with 29 votes, against 33 for Rainis and 32 for Ulmanis. When the Social Democrats decided to withdraw Rainis&#x27;s candidacy, much against the latter&#x27;s will, Čakste won the election with 60 votes.

=== Death ===
Jānis Čakste died in Riga on 14 March 1927 before the expiration of his second three-year term, and was buried at the Forest Cemetery in Riga. He is the only President of Latvia to die in office.

== Family ==

He was married to Justīne Čakste, born Vesere, and they had nine children. His son, Junior Lieutenant Visvaldis Čakste, died from wounds received in the defence of Jelgava in 1915. Another son, Konstantīns Čakste (1901–1945), a lawyer like his father, became one of the leaders of the Latvian national resistance during World War II and the Chairman of the Latvian Central Council, set up in February 1943 as the underground Latvian national government. Konstantīns Čakste was arrested by the Gestapo and died in a forced march from Stutthof concentration camp in February 1945.

<text>MMCache, also known as Turck MMCache, is a PHP accelerator, or an extension to PHP meant to improve performance. It is structured as a simple proxy server between the web server and the web browser. Its most important feature is using memcached for caching the data in memory. MMCache is free software released under the GNU GPL 2.0. The key identifying the given site is designated from the URL, so if, for example, there is a session defined within the URL, then the proxy will not work effectively.

A newer version of MMCache, MMCache-LB, has an option to connect more web servers behind the proxy, with load balancing between them.

Development work on MMCache was discontinued in 2009, and the code was forked into the eAccelerator application.

<doc id="495454" wikidata="Q241824" url="?curid=495454" title="International Union of Radio Science">
<text>The International Union of Radio Science (abbreviated URSI, after its French name, ) is one of 26 international scientific unions affiliated to the International Council for Science (ICSU).

== History and objectives ==

URSI was officially created in 1919, during the Constitutive Assembly of the International Research Council (now ICSU), based on the earlier (1913–1914) when the only radio communication system was radiotelegraphy. It has held a general assembly every three years from 1922. Fifty years ago URSI was one of the most important promoters of the International Geophysical Year. 

In addition to publishing the open access journal &quot;URSI Radio Science Letters&quot;, it sponsors the journals &quot;Advances in Radio Science&quot;, &quot;Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics&quot;, and &quot;Radio Science&quot;, last of which is co-sponsored by the American Geophysical Union.

URSI&#x27;s original objective (to encourage &quot;scientific studies of radiotelegraphy, especially those which require international cooperation&quot;) has been broadened to include all radio science, from telecommunications to radio astronomy, acquisition of radar information about distant passive objects, studies of the radiation stimulated or spontaneously emitted by these objects, biological effects of electromagnetic radiation and active modification of objects by radio waves, within the spectrum from extremely low frequency to the optical domain.

== Commissions ==

* Commission A: Electromagnetic Metrology
* Commission B: Fields and Waves
* Commission C: Radiocommunication Systems and Signal Processing
* Commission D: Electronics and Photonics
* Commission E: Electromagnetic Environment and Interference
* Commission F: Wave Propagation and Remote Sensing
* Commission G: Ionospheric Radio and Propagation
* Commission H: Waves in Plasmas
* Commission J: Radio Astronomy
* Commission K: Electromagnetics in Biology and Medicine

A few Commissions are engaged with international projects in cooperation with other international bodies, for example with the Committee on Space Research in the project International Reference Ionosphere.

== Individual membership ==

The URSI includes different individual membership grades: 
*Corresponding member (CURSI)
*Senior member, awarded to members who have a PhD, 10+ publications, and a history of involvement with the URSI
*Fellow, by invitation or by winning a URSI senior prize

<doc id="495457" wikidata="Q1464130" url="?curid=495457" title="Varangian Guard">
<text>The Varangian Guard () was an elite unit of the Byzantine army from the tenth to the fourteenth century who served as personal bodyguards to the Byzantine emperors. The Varangian Guard was known for being primarily composed of recruits from Northern Europe, including mainly Norsemen from Scandinavia but also Anglo-Saxons from England. The recruitment of distant foreigners from outside Byzantium to serve as the emperor&#x27;s personal guard was pursued as a deliberate policy, as they lacked local political loyalties and could be counted upon to suppress revolts by disloyal Byzantine factions.

The Rus&#x27; provided the earliest members of the Varangian Guard. They were in Byzantine service from as early as 874. The Guard was first formally constituted under Emperor Basil II in 988, following the Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27; by Vladimir I of Kiev. Vladimir, who had recently usurped power in Kiev with an army of Varangian warriors, sent 6,000 men to Basil as part of a military assistance agreement. Basil&#x27;s distrust of the native Byzantine guardsmen, whose loyalties often shifted with fatal consequences, as well as the proven loyalty of the Varangians, many of whom had previously served in Byzantium, led the Emperor to employ them as his personal guardsmen.

Immigrants from Scandinavia (predominantly immigrants from Sweden, but also elements from Denmark and Norway) kept an almost entirely Norse cast to the organization until the late 11th century. According to the late Swedish historian Alf Henrikson in his book &quot;Svensk Historia&quot; (&quot;History of Sweden&quot;), the Norse Varangian guardsmen were recognized by long hair, a red ruby set in the left ear and ornamented dragons sewn on their chainmail shirts. During these years, Swedish men left to enlist in the Byzantine Varangian Guard in such numbers that a medieval Swedish law, Västgötalagen, from Västergötland declared no one could inherit while staying in &quot;Greece&quot;—the then Scandinavian term for the Byzantine Empire—to stop the emigration, especially as two other European courts simultaneously also recruited Scandinavians: Kievan Rus&#x27; c. 980–1060 and London 1013–1051 (the Þingalið).

Composed primarily of Norsemen and Rus&#x27; for the first 100 years, the Guard began to see increased numbers of Anglo-Saxons after the Norman conquest of England. By the time of the Emperor Alexios Komnenos in the late 11th century, the Varangian Guard was largely recruited from Anglo-Saxons and &quot;others who had suffered at the hands of the Vikings and their cousins the Normans&quot;. The Anglo-Saxons and other Germanic peoples shared with the Vikings a tradition of faithful (to death if necessary) oath-bound service, and the Norman invasion of England resulted in many fighting men who had lost their lands and former masters and were looking for positions elsewhere.

The Varangian Guard not only provided security for the Byzantine emperors, but also participated in many wars, often playing a decisive role, since they were usually deployed at critical moments of a battle. By the late 13th century, Varangians were mostly ethnically assimilated by the Byzantine Greeks, though the Guard remained in existence until at least mid-14th century. In 1400, there were still some people identifying themselves as &quot;Varangians&quot; in Constantinople.

==History==

The earliest members of the Varangian guard came from Kievan Rus&#x27;. A treaty between Rus&#x27; and the Byzantine empire under Basil I was agreed in 874 after a period of hostilities. A clause in the treaty obliged Rus&#x27; to provide men for Byzantine service. Renewed hostilities between 907 and 911 ended with a new treaty under which any Rus&#x27; who chose could serve Byzantium as a right.

The scholarly consensus is that the Rus&#x27; people originated in what is currently coastal eastern Sweden around the eighth century and that their name has the same origin as Roslagen in Sweden (with the older name being &quot;Roden&quot;). According to the prevalent theory, the name &quot;Rus&quot;″, like the Proto-Finnic name for Sweden (&quot;*Roocci&quot;), is derived from an Old Norse term for &quot;the men who row&quot; (&quot;rods-&quot;) as rowing was the main method of navigating the rivers of Eastern Europe, and that it could be linked to the Swedish coastal area of Roslagen (&quot;Rus-law&quot;) or &quot;Roden&quot;, as it was known in earlier times.

As early as 911, Varangians are mentioned as fighting as mercenaries for the Byzantines. About 700 Varangians served along with Dalmatians as marines in Byzantine naval expeditions against the Emirate of Crete in 902 and a force of 629 returned to Crete under Constantine Porphyrogenitus in 949. A unit of 415 Varangians was involved in the Italian expedition of 936. It is also recorded that there were Varangian contingents among the forces that fought the Arabs in Syria in 955. During this period, the Varangian mercenaries were included in the &quot;Great Companions&quot; (Gk. ).

In 988, Basil II requested military assistance from Vladimir I of Kiev to help defend his throne. In compliance with the treaty made by his father after the Siege of Dorostolon (971), Vladimir sent 6,000 men to Basil. Vladimir took the opportunity to rid himself of his most unruly warriors who in any case he was unable to pay. This is the presumptive date for the formal, permanent institution of an elite guard. In exchange for the warriors, Vladimir was given Basil&#x27;s sister, Anna, in marriage. Vladimir also agreed to convert to Christianity and to bring his people into the Christian faith.

In 989, these Varangians, led by Basil II himself, landed at Chrysopolis to defeat the rebel general Bardas Phokas. On the field of battle, Phokas died of a stroke in full view of his opponent; upon the death of their leader, Phokas&#x27; troops turned and fled. The brutality of the Varangians was noted when they pursued the fleeing army and &quot;cheerfully hacked them to pieces&quot;.

These men formed the nucleus of the Varangian Guard, which saw extensive service in southern Italy in the eleventh century, as the Normans and Lombards worked to extinguish Byzantine authority there. In 1018, Basil II received a request from his catepan of Italy, Basil Boioannes, for reinforcements to put down the Lombard revolt of Melus of Bari. A detachment of the Varangian Guard was sent and in the Battle of Cannae, the Byzantines achieved a decisive victory.

The Varangians also participated in the partial reconquest of Sicily from the Arabs under George Maniakes in 1038. Here, they fought alongside Normans recently arrived in Italy seeking adventure and Lombards from Byzantine-held Apulia. A prominent member of the Guard at this time was Harald Hardrada, later King of Norway as Harald III (1046–1066). However, when Maniakes ostracised the Lombards by publicly humiliating their leader, Arduin, the Lombards deserted and the Normans and Varangians followed them.

Not long after, the catepan Michael Doukeianos had a force of Varangians stationed at Bari. On 16 March 1041, they were called up to fight the Normans near Venosa; many drowned in the subsequent retreat across the Ofanto. In September, Exaugustus Boioannes was sent to Italy with only a small contingent of Varangians to replace the disgraced Doukeianos. On 3 September 1041, they were defeated in battle by the Normans.

Many of the last catepans were sent from Constantinople with Varangian units. In 1047, John Raphael was sent to Bari with a contingent of Varangians, but the Bariots refused to receive his troops and he spent his term at Otranto. Twenty years later, in 1067, the last Byzantine catepan in southern Italy, Mabrica, arrived with Varangian auxiliaries and took Brindisi and Taranto. At the disastrous Battle of Manzikert in 1071, virtually all the Emperor&#x27;s Guards fell around him.
Composed primarily of Scandinavians for the first 100 years, the guard began to see increasing numbers of Anglo-Saxons after the successful invasion of England by the Normans. In 1088, a large number of Anglo-Saxons and Danes emigrated to the Byzantine Empire by way of the Mediterranean. One source has more than 5,000 of them arriving in 235 ships. Those who did not enter imperial service settled on the Black Sea coast, building and garrisoning the town of Helenopolis for Alexios I. Those who did became so vital to the Varangians that the Guard was commonly called the (Anglo-Varangians) from that point. In this capacity, they fought in Sicily against the Normans under Robert Guiscard, who unsuccessfully sought to invade the lower Balkans as well.

Writing about the unit as it was in 1080, the chronicler and princess Anna Komnene refers to these &quot;axe-bearing barbarians&quot; as being &quot;from Thule&quot;, likely a reference to the British Isles or Scandinavia. Likewise, the Byzantine civil-servant, soldier and historian John Kinnamos calls these &quot;axe-bearers&quot; that guarded the Emperor &quot;the British nation, which has been in service to the Romans&#x27; Emperors from a long time back&quot;. Kinnamos was writing in the later 12th century, indicating perhaps that the more Dane and Saxon composition of the guard continued to the point of the Fourth Crusade.

After the end of the Norwegian Crusade led by the Norwegian King Sigurd I Magnusson, the guard had an influx of Norwegian Warriors. The Norwegian King sold his ships in Constantinople and returned to Norway with only 100 men, out of an original army of around 6,000.

The Varangians relied on the broad-bladed Dane axe as their main weapon, although they were often also skilled swordsmen or archers. In some sources, such as Anna Komnene&#x27;s &quot;The Alexiad&quot;, they are described as mounted; both Vikings and elite Anglo-Saxon warriors routinely used horses for strategic mobility even though they normally fought on foot. The guard was stationed primarily around Constantinople, and may have been barracked in the Bucoleon palace complex. The guard also accompanied armies into the field, and Byzantine chroniclers (as well as several notable Western European and Arab chroniclers) often note their battlefield prowess, especially in comparison to the local barbarian peoples. They were vital to the Byzantine victory under the emperor John II Komnenos at the Battle of Beroia in 1122. The Varangians hacked their way through the enemy&#x27;s circle of Pecheneg wagons, collapsing the Pecheneg position and causing a general rout in their camp.

The Varangians were described by 11th-century Byzantine historian Michael Psellus as thus: &quot;The whole group carry shields and brandish on their shoulders a certain single-edged, heavy-iron weapon&quot;, which is understood to have been the Dane axe (many Byzantine writers referred to them as &quot;axe-bearing barbarians&quot;, , rather than as Varangians). However, a mistranslation of the Greek text has led some to refer to the weapon as a , which most likely occurred as a product of Atticism in Byzantine literature.

They were prominent in the defence of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade. Of the role of the guard, it is said that &quot;the fighting was very violent and there was hand to hand fight with axes and swords, the assailants mounted the walls and prisoners were taken on both sides&quot;. The latest mention of the Varangian guard is in the Greek version of the &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot;, which states that this unit escorted the Prince of Achaia away to prison after the Battle of Pelagonia in 1259; historian D. J. Geanakoplos suggests they were reconstituted by Theodore I Laskaris to strengthen his claim as the rightful Emperor. People identified as Varangians were to be found in Constantinople around 1400.

==Function==

The duties and purpose of the Varangian Guard were similar—if not identical—to the services provided by the Kievan &quot;druzhina&quot;, the Swedish/Norwegian &quot;hird&quot;, and the Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon &quot;housecarls&quot;. The Varangians served as the personal bodyguard of the emperor, swearing an oath of loyalty to him; they had ceremonial duties as retainers and acclaimers and performed some police duties, especially in cases of treason and conspiracy. They were headed by a separate officer, the &quot;akolouthos&quot;, who was usually a native Byzantine.

The Varangian Guard was only used in battle during critical moments, or where the battle was most fierce. Contemporary Byzantine chroniclers note with a mix of terror and fascination that the &quot;Scandinavians were frightening both in appearance and in equipment, they attacked with reckless rage and neither cared about losing blood nor their wounds&quot;. The description probably refers to berserkers, since this state of trance is said to have given them superhuman strength and no sense of pain from their wounds. When the Byzantine Emperor died, the Varangians had the unique right of running to the imperial treasury and taking as much gold and as many gems as they could carry, a procedure known in Old Norse as &quot;polutasvarf&quot; (&quot;palace pillaging&quot;). This privilege enabled many Varangians to return home as wealthy men, which encouraged even more Scandinavians to enlist in the Guard in &quot;Miklagarðr&quot; (Swedish = Miklagård = &#x27;The Great City&#x27;, i.e. Constantinople).

The loyalty of the Varangians became a trope of Byzantine writers. Writing about her father Alexius&#x27;s seizing of the Imperial throne in 1081, Anna Komnene notes that he was advised not to attack the Varangians who still guarded the Emperor Nikephoros for the Varangians &quot;regard loyalty to the emperors and the protection of their persons as a family tradition, a kind of sacred trust&quot;. This allegiance, she noted, &quot;they preserve inviolate, and will never brook the slighted hint of betrayal&quot;. Unlike the native Byzantine guards so mistrusted by Basil II, the Varangian guards&#x27; loyalties lay with the position of Emperor, not the man who sat on the throne. This was made clear in 969 when the guards failed to avenge the death by assassination of Emperor Nikephoros II. A servant had managed to call for the guards while the Emperor was being attacked, but when they arrived he was dead. They immediately knelt before John Tzimiskes, Nikephoros&#x27; murderer and hailed him as Emperor. &quot;Alive they would have defended him to the last breath: dead there was no point in avenging him. They had a new master now.&quot;

This reputation exceeds the truth in at least two recorded instances. In 1071, after Emperor Romanos IV Diogenes was defeated by Sultan Alp Arslan, a palace coup was staged before he could return to Constantinople. Caesar John Doukas used the Varangian guard to depose the absent emperor, arrest Empress Eudoxia, and proclaim his nephew, stepson of Diogenes Michael VII, as emperor. Thus, instead of defending their absent emperor, the Varangians were used by the usurpers—proving their loyalty to the throne, if not always the current occupier of that throne. In a more sinister episode, the historian Joannes Zonaras reports the guard revolting against Nikephoros III Botaneiates after the blinding of the general Nikephoros Bryennios in 1078, &quot;planning to kill him&quot; but being suppressed by loyal troops. They subsequently asked for and received a pardon.

==Runestones==

There are a number of raised stone memorials called runestones throughout Scandinavia. The runestones are unevenly distributed in Scandinavia: Denmark has 250 runestones, Norway has 50 while Iceland has none. Sweden has as many as between 1,700 and 2,500 depending on definition. The Swedish district of Uppland has the highest concentration with as many as 1,196 inscriptions in stone, whereas Södermanland is second with 391. Many date to the Viking Age, and there are many associated with the Varangian Guards.

These Varangian runestones commemorate various fallen warriors through carved runes, and mention voyages to the East (&quot;Austr&quot;) or the Eastern route (&quot;Austrvegr&quot;), or to more specific eastern locations such as Garðaríki (what is today Russia and Ukraine). The losses that the Varangian Guard suffered are reflected by the largest group of runestones that talk of foreign voyages, such as those termed the Greece Runestones. These were raised by former members of the Varangian Guard, or in their memory. A smaller group consists of the four Italy Runestones which were raised in memory of members of the Varangian Guard who died in southern Italy.

The oldest of the Greece runestones are six stones in the style RAK, a style which is dated to the period before 1015 AD. The group consists of Skepptuna runestone U 358, Västra Ledinge runestone U 518, Nälberga runestone Sö 170 and Eriksstad runestone Sm 46.

One of the more notable of the later runestones in the style Pr4 is Ed runestone U 112, a large boulder at the western shore of the lake of Ed. It tells that Ragnvaldr, the captain of the Varangian Guard, had returned home where he had the inscriptions made in memory of his dead mother.

The youngest runestones, in the style Pr5, such as Ed runestone U 104 (presently in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford), are dated to the period 1080–1130, after which runestones became unfashionable.

The Varangians did not return home without being imprinted by Byzantine culture in one way or another, as exemplified by the Byzantine cross carved on the early eleventh century Risbyle runestone U 161, and which today is the coat-of-arms of Täby, a trimunicipal locality and the seat of Täby Municipality in Stockholm County, Sweden. The runes were made by the Viking Ulf of Borresta, see Orkesta runestone U 344, in memory of another Ulf, in Skålhamra, and at the request of the latter&#x27;s father.

==Norse sagas==
According to the sagas, the West Norse entered the service of the Guard considerably later than the East Norse. According to the Laxdœla saga, the Icelander Bolli Bollason (born c. 1006) was the first known Icelander in the Varangian Guard. Travelling to Constantinople via Denmark, he spent many years in the Varangian Guard, &quot;and was thought to be the most valiant in all deeds that try a man, and always went next to those in the forefront.&quot; The saga also records the finery his followers received from the Emperor, and the influence he held after his return to Iceland:

The Varangian Guard is mentioned also in &quot;Njal&#x27;s Saga&quot; in reference to Kolskegg—an Icelander said to have come first to Holmgard (Novgorod) and then on to Miklagard (Constantinople), where he entered the Emperor&#x27;s service. &quot;The last that was heard of him was, that he had wedded a wife there, and was captain over the Varangians, and stayed there till his death day.&quot;

One of the members of the Varangian Guard was the future king Harald Sigurdsson III of Norway, known as Harald Hardråde (&quot;Hard-ruler&quot;). Having fled his homeland, Harald went first to Gardariki and then on to Constantinople, where he arrived in 1035. He participated in eighteen battles and during his service fought against Arabs in Anatolia and Sicily under General George Maniakes, as well as in southern Italy and Bulgaria. An extensive account of Harald Sigurdsson&#x27;s journeys is found in Harald Sigurdsson&#x27;s Saga.

During his time in the Varangian Guard Harald earned the titles of &quot;manglavites&quot; and &quot;spatharokandidatos&quot;. But his service ended with his imprisonment for misappropriation of imperial plunder taken during his command. He was released upon the dethronement of the Emperor Michael V, and saga sources suggest he was the one sent to blind the Emperor when he and his uncle fled to the church of the Stoudios Monastery and clung to the altar.

Harald then sought to leave his post, but was denied this. He eventually escaped and returned home in 1043, becoming King of Norway before eventually dying at the Battle of Stamford Bridge while invading England in 1066.

The Varangian Guard regained some of its old Scandinavian flavour when Harald Hardråde&#x27;s grandson, Sigurd I of Norway, went on the Norwegian Crusade to the Holy Land. After fighting battles against the Muslims, King Sigurd in 1110 let the rest of his force, who originally numbered 6,000 men, join the Varangian Guard. King Sigurd returned home with fewer than a hundred of his personal Guard.

Most of the Old Norse narratives which deals with Norwegians or Icelanders in the Varangian Guard are from the 13th century, and bear witness to a continued interest and generally positive views towards Byzantium within the West Norse cultural area.

<text>William Cartwright (1 September 1611 – 29 November 1643) was an English poet, dramatist and churchman.

==Early life==
Cartwright was born at Northway, Gloucestershire, the son of William Cartwright of Heckhampton, Gloucestershire. 
He was educated at the free school of Cirencester and at Westminster School. 
He matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford on 24 February 1632 aged 20, and was awarded BA on 5 June 1632. 
He was awarded MA on 15 April 1635. Anthony Wood gives an account of his origin as son of a country gentleman turned innkeeper which is contradicted by statements made in David Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot;.

==Career==
Cartwright became reader in metaphysics at Oxford University and was, according to Wood, the most florid and seraphical preacher in the university. 
In 1642 he was made succentor of Salisbury Cathedral, and in 1643 he was chosen junior proctor of the university.

Cartwright was a successor to Ben Jonson and is often counted among the Sons of Ben, the group of dramatists who practised Jonson&#x27;s style of comedy. The collected edition of his poems (1651) contains commendatory verses by Henry Lawes, who set some of his songs to music, by Izaak Walton, Alexander Brome, Henry Vaughan and others. Cartwright and Lawes maintained an important working relationship, for perhaps a decade prior to Cartwright&#x27;s death in 1643; in one view, Lawes made a significant contribution to Cartwright&#x27;s conception of drama.

Though Cartwright has been listed among the 17th century dramatists known as the Sons of Ben, as they were to have been influenced by Ben Jonson, Cartwright&#x27;s play &quot;The Ordinary&quot; has been described as a second-rate Jonsonian comedy, nothing more than a pale copy of an original. Some would perhaps argue that bad replication does not qualify Cartwright as a true Son of Ben.

==Civil War==
Cartwright was nominated one of the council of war at Oxford in 1642. He died of camp fever (epidemic typhus) at Oxford aged 32 and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral. 
It is said that King Charles I of England wore mourning on the day of his funeral.

==Works==
His plays are, with the exception of &quot;The Ordinary&quot;, far-fetched in plot, and stilted and artificial in treatment. They are:
*&quot;The Royal Slave&quot; (1636), produced by the students of Christ Church before the king and queen, with music by Henry Lawes
*&quot;The Lady Errant&quot; (acted, 1635–1636; printed, 1651)
*&quot;The Siege, or Love&#x27;s Convert&quot; (printed 1651)
In &quot;The Ordinary&quot; (1635?) he produced a comedy of real life, in imitation of Jonson, representing pot-house society. It is reprinted in Robert Dodsley&#x27;s &quot;Old Plays&quot; (ed. William Hazlitt, vol. xii.).

<doc id="495463" wikidata="Q7068916" url="?curid=495463" title="Nul (band)">
<text>NuL is a South African band formed in 1998 by Adriaan Pelzer and Simon Kruger, operating as NuL since 2004. NuL creates Afrikaans EBM/Industrial music, and propagates the free distribution of their music. Apart from conventional CD sales, they distribute all of their music freely on the internet, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-NoDerivs license. The music is seeded directly from their website. They also encourage fans on their website to pirate their CD by making the CD artwork of their first CD available as free downloads.

==History==
When their highly avant-garde rock band, Nothing, broke up in 1998, Adriaan Pelzer and Simon Kruger started experimenting with computer music on a Pentium II 350 MHz, using mainly software like Fruity Loops and Cool Edit Pro, but also experimenting with the possibilities of music production on Linux-based systems. They were both based in Pretoria, South Africa at the time. Initially inspired by the works of Aphex Twin, Autechre and Squarepusher, they produced a number of Glitch-inspired pieces that were later to be released on the Een album.

When Simon moved to London in 2002, Adriaan continued the legacy, and developed the musical style into a more hard-edged, Industrial-influenced direction. Shortly after Simon&#x27;s return to South Africa in 2004, Adriaan moved to Singapore, where he topped the development of the new, harder style with EBM influences. Here he founded the NuL website, where all of NuL&#x27;s music is seeded from onto the Internet. In 2006 he returned to South Africa, and together with Simon, Dawid Kahts (Thys Nywerheid), and Adriaan&#x27;s wife, actress Mareli Minnaar, formed the band, NuL, who are rapidly becoming known for their energetic live performances.

Later in 2006 the band was joined by Visual Artist Niel de Lange, who added a whole new dimension to NuL&#x27;s live performance with live Video Mixing. In 2007 Gerrie Roos joined NuL as their permanent Sound Engineer, and Chris Erasmus became the seventh member of NuL, as their permanent lighting technician and videographer. After experimental videos made for Swart and Kaper, NuL filmed their first full-fledged Music Video of Online Superstar in the winter of 2008, with Erasmus operating the camera, de Lange as set designer, and Pelzer as Director. The Video featured none of the bandmembers themselves, but instead Dai Zaobab, internationally acclaimed firedancer and self-proclaimed Boabab Hunter. The video was launched on TV for the first time on the Afrikaans music channel, MK.

In 2007 NuL signed a distribution deal with OneF Records, run by Paul Riekert of the first ever, hugely successful Afrikaans Industrial band, Battery9.

2009 saw an increase in activity for NuL following the launch of their third album, Drie, In June. 2009 also brought about some changes in the lineup with the departure of VJ Niel de Lange. The band, opting not to try and replace his artistry, compensated by focusing on introducing a more organic and dynamic feel to their live shows utilising videographer Chris Erasmus&#x27; phenomenal ability as a lighting technician.

<doc id="495467" wikidata="Q1592966" url="?curid=495467" title="Chaenopsidae">
<text>The blennioid family Chaenopsidae includes the pike-blennies, tube-blennies, and flagblennies, all percomorph marine fish in the order Blenniiformes. The family is strictly tropical, ranging from North to South America. Members are also present in waters off Japan, Taiwan and Korea. Fourteen genera and 91 species are represented, the largest being the sarcastic fringehead, &quot;Neoclinus blanchardi&quot;, at in length; most are much smaller, and the group includes perhaps the smallest of all vertebrates, &quot;Acanthemblemaria paula&quot;, measuring just long as an adult.

With highly compressed bodies, some may be so elongated as to appear eel-like; chaenopsids are scaleless and lack lateral lines. Their heads are rough and may be armed with spines. There may be 17 to 28 spines in the dorsal fin, with two in the anal fin.

The habit of taking up home in abandoned worm tubes has earned some species in this family the name &quot;tube-blenny&quot;. Many will also inhabit empty clam shells, which also serve as nesting sites; males are known to guard the brood. Some species have dorsal fins which are significantly higher towards the head, explaining the moniker &quot;flagblenny&quot;. Crustaceans make up the bulk of the chaenopsid diet.

At least one species found in the Caribbean, &quot;Emblemariopsis diaphana&quot;, is known to form a symbiotic relationship with stony coral, &quot;Meandrina meandrites&quot;.

According to some authorities the Chaenopsidae is not monophyletic if the genera &quot;Neoclinus&quot; and &quot;Stathmonotus&quot; are included. They propose that &quot;Stathmonotus&quot; be included in the family Labrisomidae and that &quot;Neoclinus&quot;, and the closely related &quot;Mccoskerichthys&quot;, be placed in the tribe Neoclinini, stating that further study is required to clarify this clade&#x27;s true relationships.

<text>Alexander Brome (1620 – 30 June 1666) was an English poet.

==Life==
Brome was by profession an attorney, and was the author of many drinking songs and of satirical verses in favour of the Royalists and in opposition to the Rump Parliament. In 1661, following the Restoration, he published &quot;Songs and other Poems&quot;, containing songs on various subjects, followed by a series of political songs; ballads, epistles, elegies and epitaphs; epigrams and translations. Izaak Walton wrote an introductory eclogue for this volume in praise of the writer, and his gaiety and wit won him the title of the English Anacreon in Edward Phillips&#x27;s &quot;Theatrum Poetarum&quot;.

Brome published a translation of Horace by himself and others in 1666, and was the author of a comedy entitled &quot;The Cunning Lovers&quot; (1654). He also edited two volumes of Richard Brome&#x27;s plays.

He died in his house in Barge Yard in the parish of St Stephen Walbrook in the City of London in June 1666, and was buried in the parish church.

<doc id="495471" wikidata="Q32904692" url="?curid=495471" title="Uridine triphosphate">
<text>Uridine-5′-triphosphate (UTP) is a pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphate, consisting of the organic base uracil linked to the 1′ carbon of the ribose sugar, and esterified with tri-phosphoric acid at the 5′ position. Its main role is as substrate for the synthesis of RNA during transcription. UTP is the precursor for the production of CTP via CTP synthetase. UTP can be biosynthesized from UDP by Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase after using the phosphate group from ATP. UDP + ATP ⇌ UTP + ADP; both UTP and ATP are energetically equal.

The homologue in DNA is thymidine triphosphate (TTP or dTTP). UTP also has a deoxyribose form (dUTP).

==Role in metabolism==
UTP also has the role of a source of energy or an activator of substrates in metabolic reactions, like that of ATP, but more specific. When UTP activates a substrate (such as glucose-1-phosphate), UDP-glucose is formed and inorganic phosphate is released. 
UDP-glucose enters the synthesis of glycogen. UTP is used in the metabolism of galactose, where the activated form UDP-galactose is converted to UDP-glucose. UDP-glucuronate is used to conjugate bilirubin to a more water-soluble bilirubin diglucuronide. UTP is also used to activate amino sugars like glucosamine-1-phosphate to UDP-glucosamine, and &quot;N&quot;-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate to UDP-&quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine.

==Role in receptor mediation==
UTP also has roles in mediating responses by extracellular binding to the P2Y receptors of cells. UTP and its derivatives are still being investigated for their applications in human medicine. However, there is evidence from various model systems to suggest it has applications in pathogen defense and injury repair. In mice UTP has been found to interact with P2Y4 receptors to mediate an enhancement in antibody production. In Schwannoma cells, UTP binds to the P2YP receptors in the event of damage.  This leads to the downstream signal cascade that leads to the eventual injury repair.

<doc id="495472" wikidata="Q2748219" url="?curid=495472" title="Boobrie">
<text>The boobrie is a mythological shapeshifting entity inhabiting the lochs of the west coast of Scotland. It commonly adopts the appearance of a gigantic water bird resembling a cormorant or great northern diver, but it can also materialise in the form of various other mythological creatures such as a water bull.

A generally malevolent entity, the boobrie typically preys on livestock being transported on ships, but it is also fond of otters, of which it consumes a considerable number. In its manifestation as a water horse the creature is able to gallop across the top of lochs as if on solid ground. During the summer months it is seen infrequently as a large insect, sucking the blood of horses.

Folklorist Campbell of Islay has speculated that descriptions of the boobrie may be based on sightings of the great auk. The bellowing sound made by the boobrie, more like a bull than a bird, may have its origin in the strange call of the common bittern, which was a rare visitor to Scotland.

==Etymology==
&quot;Boobrie&quot; may derive from , meaning cow giver or cow bestowing. Edward Dwelly, a Scottish lexicographer, lists &quot;tarbh-boidhre&quot; as &quot;Monster, demon&quot; and &quot;God capable of changing himself into many forms&quot;; &quot;tarbh-aoidhre&quot; is given as a northern counties variation. The simpler component of &quot;tarbh&quot; as a single word is defined by Dwelly as &quot;bull.&quot; Transcribers of the tale have used several differing spellings of the second component, some even adopting inconsistent variations throughout their own renditions. George Henderson for instance, a folklorist and Celtic scholar, used five alternatives: &quot;bo&#x27;eithre&quot;; &quot;boidhre&quot;; &quot;bo-oibhre&quot;; &quot;eithre&quot;; and &quot;fhaire&quot;. Spelling variations employed by other writers include &quot;aoidhre&quot;; &quot;baoighre&quot;; &quot;baoidhre&quot;; &quot;boidhre&quot;; &quot;eighre&quot;; and &quot;oire&quot;.

==Folk beliefs==

===Description and common attributes===
Investigation into folklore, especially Celtic oral traditions, began in the 19th century, and several &quot;bizarre&quot; and less familiar beasts were identified, including the boobrie. It is a generally malevolent entity, with the ability to materialise in the form of various mythical creatures. It commonly preys on animals being transported on ships, preferably calves, but will also happily eat lambs and sheep, carrying its prey away to the deepest water before consuming it. It is also extremely fond of otters, which it consumes in large quantities.

In its favoured bird manifestation the boobrie resembles a gigantic great northern diver or cormorant, but with white markings. According to folklorist Campbell of Islay, a detailed account of its dimensions provided by an authoritative source claims that it is &quot;larger than seventeen of the biggest eagles put together&quot;. It has a strong black beak about wide and in length, the final of which taper like that of an eagle. The creature&#x27;s neck is almost long with a girth of a little under . Short black powerful legs lead to webbed feet with gigantic claws. An imprint of a boobrie&#x27;s foot left in some lakeside mud equalled &quot;the span of a large wide-spreading pair of red deer&#x27;s horns&quot;. It bellows noisily with displeasure, sounding more like a bull than a bird. The design of its wings is more conducive to swimming rather than for flight. Its evil powers when in the form of a bird were said by Campbell of Islay to have &quot;terrified a minister out of his propriety&quot;. The boobrie&#x27;s insatiable appetite for livestock posed a threat to local farmers, as they relied on their animals as a means of providing income and food.

Although sea lochs are the boobries&#x27; natural home they will shelter on land in overgrown heather. Accounts are inconsistent as to the extent of the boobrie&#x27;s habitat. Campbell of Islay claims that it is specific to the lochs of Argyllshire, as does Emeritus Professor of English James MacKillop. The writers Katharine Briggs and Patricia Monaghan on the other hand consider the creature&#x27;s range to be the broader Scottish Highlands, although Briggs does sometimes specify Argyllshire. Campbell of Islay&#x27;s undated manuscript notes the boobrie had not been seen for several years probably due to the widespread burning of heather in the area of its habitat.

===Alternative manifestations===
When manifested as a water horse the creature is able to gallop across the surface of lochs; the beating noise of the creature&#x27;s hooves on the water is the same as if it were galloping on solid ground.

Henderson reproduced parts of Campbell of Islay&#x27;s manuscripts when writing &quot;Survivals in belief among the Celts&quot; (1911). Among them is a story listed as &quot;boobrie as tarbh uisge&quot;. The tale starts by detailing how a man named Eachann fed a colossal black bull when he discovered it writhing in pain and possibly close to death at the side of Loch nan Dobhran, on the west coast of Argyll. Some months later, Phemie, Eachann&#x27;s girlfriend, is occasionally disturbed by elusive shadows she senses on the loch, which make her think of Murdoch, her former paramour. While she sat dreaming of Eachann one evening when staying at a sheiling near the loch, she sensed the flicker of a shadow behind her, except this time it was Murdoch. He promptly overpowered her by enveloping her in a blanket and tying her hands. At that point, a water bull came to Phemie&#x27;s rescue by knocking Murdoch to the ground. The bull then knelt down allowing Phemie to get on its back, before transporting her at the speed of light back to the home of her mother. The bull disappeared, never to be seen again, but a &quot;voice was heard in the air calling out loudly&quot;. The verse heard was in Gaelic, and translates as:

It is then asserted that the tale &quot;reveals the persistence in folk-belief of the idea of transformation, the boobrie being the abode of a spirit&quot;.

The boobrie can also manifest itself in the form of a large insect that sucks the blood of horses. Henderson refers to it as a &quot;big striped brown &quot;gobhlachan&quot; or ear-wig&quot; with &quot;lots of tentacles or feelers&quot;. It was infrequently seen in this form, usually only at the height of the summer, during August and September.

===Capture and hunting===
A farmer and his son were ploughing a field on the Isle of Mull using a team of four horses beside Loch Freisa, but work stalled after one of the horses lost a shoe and was unable to continue. Noticing a horse grazing nearby they decided to try using it as a replacement. Once harnessed to the wooden plough the horse appeared to be familiar with the task, and initially worked steadily. As it began to work towards an area closest to the loch, it became restless and the farmer gently used a whip to encourage the animal to continue. It reacted by immediately transforming into a gigantic boobrie, giving out a loud bellow and diving into the loch, pulling the plough and the other three horses with it. The frightened farmer and his son watched as the creature swam to the centre of the loch then dived underwater, taking the other horses and plough with it. Seven hours later there was still no sign of the three horses.

In a story transcribed by John Campbell of Kilberry, a hunter attempted to shoot a boobrie after he spotted it in its bird-like manifestation on a sea loch one chilly February day. The man paddled into the loch until the water was up to his shoulders, but when he was about from the creature it dived under the water. The hunter maintained his position for forty-five minutes before returning to the shore, where he remained for a further six hours waiting unsuccessfully for the boobrie to resurface. No clear indication is given of the loch&#x27;s whereabouts.

==Origins==
Campbell of Islay speculates that the boobrie may have originated from sightings of the great auk. He noted he had been told stories of the creature by various people, and regarded it as having &quot;a real existence in the popular mind&quot;. He considered the tale of the boobrie in its water horse manifestation resembled the Norse myth of &quot;the ploughing of the Asa&quot;. Referring to Forbes&#x27; 1905 dictionary of &quot;Gaelic names of beasts&quot; in which &quot;bubaire&quot; is defined as a common bittern, and a detailed description given by scholar James Logie Robertson of the bull o&#x27; the bog (an alternative name for a bittern) in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; in 1908, Henderson hypothesises that the boobrie may stem from the bittern. Referring to the bittern&#x27;s &quot;strangely weird sound&quot; and highlighting its &quot;weird hollow cry&quot; during the night and throughout the evening, he describes it as resembling quietly bellowing cattle, particularly during the bird&#x27;s breeding season. Records indicate that the bird was rare in Scotland but had been sighted in the first decade of the 20th century, although catching sight of a bittern was believed to be a harbinger of death or disaster.

<text>The Metropolitan Cathedral Church of St George, usually known as St George&#x27;s Cathedral, Southwark, is the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Southwark, south London, and is the seat of the Archbishop of Southwark.

The cathedral is the mother church of the Roman Catholic Province of Southwark which covers the Archdiocese of Southwark (all of London south of the River Thames including Kent and north Surrey) and the dioceses of Arundel and Brighton, Portsmouth, and Plymouth. It is the metropolitan cathedral of the Archbishop of Southwark. The building was erected in 1848 and reopened after extensive war damage in 1958. It is architecturally listed in the initial category of Grade II.

The cathedral is opposite the Imperial War Museum on Lambeth Road in London (on the corner with St George&#x27;s Road). On Westminster Bridge Road, close by to the north, is its eponymous Primary School and the headquarters of CAFOD.

==History==

St George&#x27;s was built in 1848, when it was opened by Bishop (later Cardinal) Wiseman. Previously, the local Catholic community had used a small chapel on London Road, also dedicated to St George, but the arrival of Irish immigrants in the area necessitated the construction of a larger house of worship. In 1852, following the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy, it became one of the first four Catholic churches in England and Wales (and the first in London) raised to cathedral status since the English Reformation. It was designed by Augustus Pugin, famous for his work with Charles Barry on the design of the rebuilt Houses of Parliament, in decorated Gothic, from yellow stock brick with Portland stone dressings. Pugin was the first person to be married in the church on 10 August 1848, to his third wife Jane.

St George&#x27;s was restored and redecorated by the Scottish ecclesiastical architect Frederick Walters between 1888 and 1905.

In October 1920 St George&#x27;s was the site of the funeral Mass of Irish nationalist Terence MacSwiney, Lord Mayor of Cork, who died on hunger strike in Brixton Prison. John Lavery painted a well-known painting of the funeral, which is in the collection of the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork.

The cathedral was badly bombed during the Second World War, following which the adjacent Amigo Hall served as the pro-cathedral. Within the external structure of Pugin&#x27;s building, Romilly Craze designed a rebuilt 20th century Gothic revival cathedral, which was opened in 1958. The surviving elements of the bombed cathedral were the two chantries and the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, which had been designed by Pugin&#x27;s son Edward in 1856.

Pugin&#x27;s original design include taller towers and a spire. Neither when built nor when rebuilt was there sufficient funding, and these elements remain unrealised.

Since the reconstruction it has resumed its role as a focal point in the local community and has played host to many notable visitors, including the Dalai Lama (1998) and Pope John Paul II (1982), the latter being depicted in one of the cathedral&#x27;s stained-glass windows by Goddard &amp; Gibbs.

==Features==
Before the wartime damage, there were two organs, one by Willis and one by Bishop &amp; Son. Both were destroyed. They were replaced by a 72 stop John Compton organ in 1958. The Compton organ has since been modified by both Ellis Scothon and by Whitwell Green.

Easter 2011 saw the partial restoration of the Compton organ and the installation in the chancel of the George Pace Choir Stalls, a gift from the Anglican St Alban&#x27;s Cathedral. The cathedral has strong links with both the Paderborn Cathedral, North Rhine-Westphalia, which suffered bombing by the British in the Second World War, and Southwark Cathedral, the local Anglican cathedral.

The stained glass in the bombed cathedral was by the prolific stained glass artist William Wailes. In the rebuilt cathedral, the window above the West Door shows the Coronation of Mary as Queen of Heaven. The East Window depicts the Crucifixion and Saints of England and Wales. Both East and West windows are by Harry Clarke of Dublin; the stone tracery in the East Window is Pugin&#x27;s.

A more recent feature is the installation of a cross by the Salvadoran artist Fernando Llort in 2013, as a national shrine to the murdered Archbishop of San Salvador Óscar Romero.

==Choirs and music==
The cathedral choirs have constantly performed at various events since 1848, and their performances have been broadcast on BBC Radio and TV, such as Christmas Midnight Mass in 2015 on BBC1.

==Today==
The cathedral is a working church for the community. For example, the Latin American community is served with a Spanish Mass every Sunday at 1pm, celebrated entirely in the Spanish language. Every Mass is attended by people of different ethnicities and ages, ranging from African to Asian to European. The Latin Mass Society of England and Wales have made several visits to the cathedral to celebrate both Low Mass and Solemn High Mass in the &quot;usus antiquior&quot; (older use) that Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s motu proprio &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot; (2007) authorised as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite (the 1962 version of the Tridentine Mass).

The cathedral is located on a historic site next to Wellington Mills housing estate and close to the Imperial War Museum, and a few minutes&#x27; walk from London&#x27;s South Bank and the Thames, Westminster Bridge, the London Eye, and landmarks such as St Thomas&#x27; Hospital and Waterloo station. Each summer it is used by London South Bank University for its graduation ceremonies. It is also frequently used for the convocations of the Academy of Saint Cecilia. The acoustics attract many orchestras and choirs to perform concerts in the nave, and the Whitehall Orchestra and Trinity College of Music are frequent visitors.

<doc id="495481" wikidata="Q3430577" url="?curid=495481" title="Richard Brome">
<text>Richard Brome ; (c. 1590? – 24 September 1652) was an English dramatist of the Caroline era.

==Life==
Virtually nothing is known about Brome&#x27;s private life. Repeated allusions in contemporary works, like Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot;, indicate that Brome started out as a servant of Jonson, in some capacity. Scholars have interpreted the allusions to mean that Brome may have begun as a menial servant but later became a sort of secretary and general assistant to the older playwright. A single brief mention of his family&#x27;s need seems to show that he had a wife and children and struggled to support them.

He may have had some experience as a professional actor: a 1628 warrant lists him as a member of the Queen of Bohemia&#x27;s Men. Yet he had already started writing for the stage by this date. An early collaboration, &quot;A Fault in Friendship&quot; (now lost) was licensed in 1623 for Prince Charles&#x27;s Men; a 1629 solo Brome effort, &quot;The Lovesick Maid&quot; (also lost), was a success for the King&#x27;s Men. &quot;The Northern Lass&quot; (1632) was another success, and made Brome&#x27;s reputation.

Due to the survival of various legal documents, much more is known about Brome&#x27;s professional activities than his personal life. Once established as a dramatist, Brome wrote for all the major acting companies and theaters of his era – for the Blackfriars Theatre; for the Red Bull Theatre; and from 1635 onward, for the King&#x27;s Revels Company and Queen Henrietta&#x27;s Men at the Salisbury Court Theatre. Brome&#x27;s &quot;Sparagus Garden&quot; was a huge success at the Salisbury Court in 1635, earning over £1000. As a result, Brome signed a three-year contract with Richard Heton, manager of the Salisbury Court, to write three plays annually at a salary of 15 shillings per week plus one day&#x27;s profit per play. Brome, however, was unable to produce dramas at the promised pace; and the stipulated payments to Brome were not kept up. In need of money, Brome resorted to Christopher Beeston, actor, impresario, and owner of the Cockpit Theatre (also known as the Phoenix) as well as the Red Bull. In August 1635 Beeston loaned Brome £6, and in return Brome committed to write Beeston a play. Heton tried to lure Brome back with a £10 payment for a new play; but they fell behind in his payments again, and Brome turned again to Beeston. Heton appealed to Sir Henry Herbert, Master of the Revels, to settle the dispute; Herbert decreed that Brome be paid six shillings a week and £5 for each new play, the payments to continue even when the theaters were closed.

The dispute was complicated by the fact that the theatres endured one of their longest enforced closings due to plague in this period; they were closed almost continuously from 10 May 1636 to 2 October 1637. Beeston ejected Queen Henrietta&#x27;s Men from the Cockpit Theatre in 1636, forcing that company to split up for a time. The King&#x27;s Revels Men, formerly at the Salisbury Court, dissolved permanently in the crisis of the closure; but the Queen&#x27;s company made a resurgence, with the help of Sir Henry Herbert, who had a financial stake in the Salisbury Court Theatre. When the plague diminished enough for performances to resume in October 1637, the re-organized Queen Henrietta&#x27;s Men commenced the new season at the Salisbury Court with, it is thought, Brome&#x27;s &quot;The English Moor.&quot;

When Brome&#x27;s 1635 contract with Heton ended in 1638, new disputes arose among Brome, Beeston, and Heton; a bill of complaint was filed against Brome, though the outcome of the case is unknown.

It seems that once the Puritans closed the theaters in 1642, Brome struggled seriously. He may have authored an entertainment, &quot;Juno in Arcadia&quot;, which John P. Cutts has argued was performed for Queen Henrietta Maria&#x27;s arrival at Oxford in 1643. He wrote commendatory verses for the &quot;Beaumont and Fletcher&quot; First Folio (1647). In 1649–50 he edited a volume of elegies, titled &quot;Lachrymae Musarum,&quot; on the death of Henry, Lord Hastings. In 1652, in a dedication to Thomas Stanley for a quarto edition of his &quot;A Jovial Crew&quot;, Brome described himself as &quot;poor and proud.&quot;

Brome died at Charterhouse Hospital, London, on 24 September 1652. Prior to this, he signed for quarterly pension payments for washing, &#x27;beverage&#x27; and gown money from 1651 to 1652, at which point his entry in the pension book is superscribed &#x27;mort&#x27;; a record of payment for his burial follows.

The plays Brome wrote were certainly, and strongly, influenced by Jonsonian comedy (Brome was not a tragedian). He was, admittedly and unambiguously, one of the &quot;Sons of Ben.&quot; The canon of his extant plays includes:

*&quot;The City Wit,&quot; c. 1629?, revived 1637, printed 1653
*&quot;The Northern Lass,&quot; performed 1629, printed 1632
*&quot;The Queen&#x27;s Exchange,&quot; c. 1629–30?, printed 1657
*&quot;The Novella,&quot; performed 1632, printed 1653
*&quot;The Weeding of Covent Garden,&quot; performed 1633?, printed 1659
*&quot;The Sparagus Garden,&quot; performed 1635, printed 1640
*&quot;The Damoiselle or the New Ordinary,&quot; c. 1638?; printed 1653
*&quot;The English Moor, or The Mock Marriage,&quot; performed 1637, printed 1659
*&quot;The Antipodes,&quot; performed 1638, printed 1640
*&quot;A Mad Couple Well-Match&#x27;d,&quot; performed 1639?, printed 1653
*&quot;The Lovesick Court, or The Ambitious Politic,&quot; registered 1640, printed 1659
*&quot;The Court Beggar,&quot; ?1640, printed 1653
*&quot;The New Academy, or The New Exchange,&quot; registered 1640, printed 1659
*&quot;The Queen and Concubine,&quot; c. 1635–39?, printed 1659
*&quot;A Jovial Crew, or the Merry Beggars,&quot; performed ?1641, printed 1652.

&quot;The English Moor&quot; also survives in a manuscript version.

Brome collaborated with Thomas Heywood in &quot;The Late Lancashire Witches,&quot; which was acted by the King&#x27;s Men and printed in 1634. The play was based on contemporary events of 1633–34.

Brome plays that have not survived include: &quot;The Lovesick Maid&quot; (1629); &quot;Wit in a Madness&quot; (?1637); &quot;The Jewish Gentleman&quot; (registered 1640); &quot;A Fault in Friendship&quot; (1623), perhaps with Jonson and another collaborator; two more collaborations with Heywood, &quot;The Life and Death of Sir Martin Skink&quot; (c. 1634) and &quot;The Apprentice&#x27;s Prize&quot; (c. 1633–41); and &quot;Christianetta, or Marriage and Hanging Go by Destiny&quot; (registered 1640), possibly a collaboration with George Chapman.

Alfred Harbage has argued that two of John Dryden&#x27;s plays, &quot;The Wild Gallant&quot; (1663) and &quot;The Mistaken Husband&quot; (1674), are adaptations of otherwise-lost plays by Brome, based on the plays&#x27; internal evidence of plot and style.

In an active playwriting career of not quite fifteen years, 1629 to 1642, Brome produced about two plays a year. Judging by the overall productivity of dramatists in English Renaissance drama, this appears to have been the pragmatic long-term maximum for a playwright who worked primarily as a solo artist (which in turn illustrates the impracticality of Brome&#x27;s attempt to produce three plays a year).

==Editions==
Two important collections of Brome&#x27;s works appeared in 1653 and 1659 – both, confusingly, titled &quot;Five New Plays&quot;. The 1653 edition, published by Humphrey Moseley, Richard Marriot, and Thomas Dring, contains &quot;A Mad Couple Well-Match&#x27;d, The Novella, The Court Beggar, The City Wit,&quot; and &quot;The Demoiselle&quot;. It features an Epistle to the Readers by Alexander Brome, thought to be no relation to the playwright. The 1659 volume, published by Andrew Crooke and Henry Brome (again, no relation), contains &quot;The English Moor, The Lovesick Court, The Weeding of Covent Garden, The New Academy,&quot; and &quot;The Queen and Concubine&quot;.

The 1653 edition also featured a portrait with a poem by Alexander Brome written in imitation of Jonson&#x27;s poem on Shakespeare&#x27;s First Folio portrait:

::&quot;Reader lo heere thou will two faces finde,&quot;
::&quot;One of the body, t’other of the Minde;&quot;
::&quot;This by the Graver go, that with much strife&quot;
::&quot;Wee thinke Brome dead, hee’s drawne so to the life&quot;
::&quot;That by’s owne pen’s so ingeinoisly&quot;
::&quot;That who read’s it must thinke hee ne’er shall dy&quot;
:::::::::::A∙ B∙

==Influence==
When the theaters reopened during the Restoration, a handful of Brome&#x27;s plays were performed and republished; the most successful was &quot;A Jovial Crew,&quot; which was acted widely and printed in 1661, 1684, and 1708. It was adapted into an opera in 1731. Other Brome plays reappeared in adapted forms. One example: &quot;The Debauchee&quot; by Aphra Behn (printed 1677) is a rewrite of Brome&#x27;s &quot;A Mad Couple Well-Match&#x27;d,&quot; down to the characters&#x27; names.

<text>SS Mendi was a British passenger steamship that was built in 1905 and, as a troopship, sank after collision with great loss of life in 1917.

Alexander Stephen and Sons of Linthouse in Glasgow, Scotland launched her on 18 June 1905 for the British and African Steam Navigation Company, which appointed group company Elder Dempster &amp; Co to manage her on their Liverpool-West Africa trades. In 1916 during the First World War the UK Admiralty chartered her as a troopship. On 21 February 1917 a large cargo steamship, , collided with her in the English Channel south of the Isle of Wight. &quot;Mendi&quot; sank, killing 646 people, mostly black South African troops, as well as white Southern African officers and NCOs, and crew. The new port admin building at the Port of Ngqura, South Africa, has been named eMendi in commemoration of the SS &quot;Mendi&quot;.

==Final voyage==

&quot;Mendi&quot; had sailed from Cape Town carrying 823 men of the 5th Battalion the South African Native Labour Corps to serve in France. She called at Lagos in Nigeria, where a naval gun was mounted on her stern. She next called at Plymouth and then headed up the English Channel toward Le Havre in northern France, escorted by the .

&quot;Mendi&quot;″s complement was a mixture characteristic of many UK merchant ships at the time. Officers, stewards, cooks, signallers and gunners were British; firemen and other crew were West Africans, most of them from Sierra Leone.

The South African Native Labour Corps men aboard her came from a range of social backgrounds, and from a number of different peoples spread over the South African provinces and neighbouring territories. 287 were from Transvaal, 139 from the Eastern Cape, 87 from Natal, 27 from Northern Cape, 26 from the Orange Free State, 26 from Basutoland, eight from Bechuanaland (Botswana), five from Western Cape, one from Rhodesia and one from South West Africa. Most had never seen the sea before this voyage, and very few could swim. The officers and NCOs were white Southern Africans.

==Loss==
At 5 am on 21 February 1917, in thick fog about south of St. Catherine&#x27;s Point on the Isle of Wight, the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company cargo ship &quot;Darro&quot; accidentally rammed &quot;Mendi&quot;″s starboard quarter, breaching her forward hold. &quot;Darro&quot; was an ship, almost three times the size of the &quot;Mendi&quot;, sailing in ballast to Argentina to load meat. &quot;Darro&quot; survived the collision but &quot;Mendi&quot; sank, killing 616 Southern Africans - 607 black troops, nine white officers &amp; NCOs, and 30 crew.

Some men were killed outright in the collision; others were trapped below decks. Many others gathered on &quot;Mendi&quot;″s deck as she listed and sank. A number of the men were afraid to enter the water and many white NCOs delayed abandoning ship in order to encourage the men to jump overboard. Oral history records that the men met their fate with great dignity. An interpreter, Isaac Williams Wauchope (also known as Isaac Wauchope Dyobha), who had previously served as a Minister in the Congregational Native Church of Fort Beaufort and Blinkwater, is reported to have calmed the panicked men by raising his arms aloft and crying out in a loud voice:
&quot;Be quiet and calm, my countrymen. What is happening now is what you came to do...you are going to die, but that is what you came to do. Brothers, we are drilling the death drill. I, a Xhosa, say you are my brothers...Swazis, Pondos, Basotho...so let us die like brothers. We are the sons of Africa. Raise your war-cries, brothers, for though they made us leave our &quot;assegais&quot; in the kraal, our voices are left with our bodies.&quot;

The damaged &quot;Darro&quot; did not stay to assist, but &quot;Brisk&quot; lowered her boats, whose crews then rescued survivors.

The investigation into the accident led to a formal hearing in summer 1917, held in Caxton Hall, Westminster. It opened on 24 July, sat for five days spread over the next fortnight, and concluded on 8 August. The court found &quot;Darro&quot;″s Master, Henry W Stump, guilty of &quot;having travelled at a dangerously high speed in thick fog, and of having failed to ensure that his ship emitted the necessary fog sound signals.&quot; It suspended Stump&#x27;s licence for a year.

The reason for Stump&#x27;s decision not to help &quot;Mendi&quot;″s survivors has been a source of speculation. There is however no evidence of his state of mind or intention. Certainly &quot;Darro&quot; was vulnerable to attack by enemy submarines, both as a large merchant ship and having sustained damage that put her out of action for up to three months.

==Wreck site==

In 1945 &quot;Mendi&quot;″s wreck was known to be off Saint Catherine&#x27;s Light, but it was not positively identified until 1974. The ship rests upright on the sea floor. She has started to break up, exposing her boilers.

In 2006 the Commonwealth War Graves Commission launched an education resource called &quot;Let us die like brothers&quot; to highlight the role played by black Southern Africans during the First World War. In death they are afforded the same level of commemoration as all other Commonwealth war dead.

In December 2006 English Heritage commissioned Wessex Archaeology to make an initial desk-based appraisal of the wreck. The project will identify a range of areas for potential future research and serve as the basis for a possible unintrusive survey of the wreck itself in the near future. In 2017 the ship&#x27;s bell was handed in anonymously to a BBC journalist. The Prime Minister, Theresa May returned the bell to South Africa while on an official visit there in August 2018.

==Monuments==
This event is commemorated by monuments in South Africa, Britain, France and the Netherlands, as well as in the name of the port admin building at the Port of Ngqura, the eMendi Admin Building and the names of two South African Navy ships:

<text>Charles Harting Percy (September 27, 1919 – September 17, 2011), also known as Chuck Percy, was an American businessman and politician. He was president of the Bell &amp; Howell Corporation from 1949 to 1964, and served as a Republican U.S. senator from Illinois from 1967 until 1985, following a defeat to Paul Simon. He was mentioned as a Republican presidential hopeful from 1968 through 1988. During his Senate career, Percy concentrated on business and foreign relations.

==Early life and education==
Charles Harting Percy was born in Pensacola, the seat of Escambia County in far northwestern Florida, the son of Edward H. Percy and the former Elizabeth Harting. His father, an Alabama native descended from illustrious colonial-era Mississippians and Virginians, was at various times an automobile salesman and bank cashier. His Illinois-born mother was a concert violinist. Edward was a son of Charles Brown Percy and Helen Leila Herndon of the powerful Herndon family of Virginia. Elizabeth Harting was a daughter of Phineas Fredrick Harting and Belle Aschenbach.

The family moved to Chicago when Percy was an infant. As a child, he had entrepreneurial energy and held jobs while attending school. In the mid-1930s, his pluck brought him to the attention of his Sunday school teacher, Joseph McNabb, the president of Bell &amp; Howell, then a small camera company.

Percy completed high school at New Trier High School. He entered the University of Chicago on a half tuition scholarship, and worked his way through college with several part-time jobs. He completed his degree in economics in 1941, and was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity.

==Business career==
Percy started at Bell &amp; Howell in 1938 as an apprentice and sales trainee while he was still in college. In 1939 he worked at Crowell Collier.

He returned to Bell &amp; Howell in 1941 to work full-time after graduating from the University of Chicago. Astute at business, within a year he was appointed a director of the company. Percy served three years in the United States Navy during World War II and returned to the company in 1945.

In 1949, the Jaycees named Percy one of the &quot;Outstanding Young Men in America&quot;, along with Gerald R. Ford Jr., of Michigan, future U.S. president, and John Ben Shepperd, future Texas attorney general.

After Joseph McNabb died in 1949, Percy was made the president of Bell &amp; Howell. He was instrumental in leading the company during a period of financial success and growth. During his leadership, Percy expanded Bell &amp; Howell, raising revenues 32-fold and the number of employees 12-fold, and listing the company on the New York Stock Exchange. While continuing to manufacture movie cameras and movie and sound projectors for military, commercial, and home use, in the late 1940s the company diversified into the production of microfilm. It later entered the rapidly expanding markets of information services as well.

==Political career==
In the late 1950s, Percy decided to enter politics. With the encouragement of then U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Percy helped to write &quot;Decisions for a Better America&quot;, which proposed a set of long-range goals for the Republican Party. He belonged to the moderate and liberal wing of the Republican party, led by Eisenhower during his presidency and later closely identified with New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller. In 1958, Percy served on the Rockefeller Foundation&#x27;s Special Study Fund, essentially working as an informal advisor to Rockefeller&#x27;s campaign for Governor of New York.

Percy first entered electoral politics with a run for governor of Illinois in 1964, which he narrowly lost to Democratic incumbent Otto Kerner. During his gubernatorial campaign, Percy reluctantly endorsed conservative Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater, his future Senate colleague. Goldwater fared poorly throughout the country, although he did marginally better in Illinois than in the nation at large.

=== Murder of Valerie Percy ===
In 1966, Percy ran for U.S. senator from Illinois. However, his 21-year-old daughter Valerie was murdered at the family home on the morning of September 18, late in the campaign. Her death was thought to have been caused by an intruder. After Illinois state police have interviewed more than 14,000 people, spent over $300,000, and pursued 1,317 leads, lead No. 273 was the most viable. Leading them to Francis Leroy Hohimer and Frederick Malchow which they believed committed the murder while robbing the house. The men were part of gang of thieves backed by the Mafia that would rob wealthy homes. Chicago detectives are certain of at least 30 jobs the gang pulled, with an excess of $3,000,000 in jewels and cash. Both violent criminals, testimony from several key people after the murder stated Hohimer confessed to them that he killed her cause she woke up. However, no physical evidence was ever found to connect either of them to scene. Many doubt this as well as nothing was stolen from the home that night. The crime was never solved despite a lengthy investigation.

===U.S. Senate===
After his daughter&#x27;s death, Percy and his opponent both suspended campaigning for a couple of weeks following Valerie&#x27;s death. He upset Democratic Senator Paul Douglas (a former professor of Percy&#x27;s at the University of Chicago) with 56 percent of the vote.

After Percy appeared on the television show &quot;Face The Nation&quot; on January 15, 1967, with the other newly elected Republican Senators, the then President Lyndon Johnson noted privately that he thought Percy would make a fine president if the opportunity should ever arise.

On December 12, 1967, Senator Percy met with South Vietnamese President Thieu and assured him that &quot;no responsible people in either the Democratic or the Republican Party favored US withdrawal from South Vietnam.&quot;

In 1967, Senator Percy introduced a bill to establish a program to stimulate production of low-cost housing. Percy&#x27;s proposal was the first of its kind to provide home ownership to low-income families, and it received strong support from Republicans in both the House and the Senate, although it ultimately did not pass. When asked why he selected housing for his first major legislative proposal, Percy said: &quot;Of all the problems I ran across during three years of campaigning, first for the governorship and then for the Senate, the most appalling in their consequences for the future seemed to be the problems of the declining areas of the city and countryside, the inadequacy of housing.&quot; Percy voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court, joined other Rockefeller Republicans in voting against the Supreme Court nominations of Clement Haynsworth and George Harrold Carswell, but did vote for William Rehnquist in 1971.

When in the Senate less than two years, Percy was mentioned as a Republican hopeful for the 1968 presidential nomination. &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist James B. Reston referred to him as &quot;the hottest political article in the Republican Party&quot;. In 1970, Percy spoke about his enjoyment of &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;, saying &quot;Every white person should read it.&quot;

In 1972, Percy sought a second term to the Senate. In the general election, he defeated Congressman Roman Pucinski by a landslide. He gave up his seat on the important Senate Appropriations Committee for one on the Foreign Relations Committee.

Senator Percy in 1974 introduced legislation making the national maximum speed limit permanent, which became law in January 1975, remaining in effect until it was amended in 1987 to allow on rural Interstate highways and finally repealed in 1995.

In 1978, as Percy was completing his second term, he appeared invincible. Percy was considered so strong that the Democratic Party was unable to persuade any serious candidates to challenge him in that year&#x27;s election. Alex Seith, a dark horse candidate, was his Democratic challenger. Seith had never before sought elected office but had served as an appointee on the Cook County Zoning Board of Appeals for twelve years, nine as chairman.

At that time, Percy&#x27;s reputation as a moderate Rockefeller Republican, contrasted with Seith&#x27;s ostensible hard-line foreign policy positions, combined to make Percy suddenly vulnerable in the weeks before the election. Percy had earlier worked to broaden the base of the Republican Party and was an outlier to more conservative elements. Sensing his probable loss, Percy went on television days before the polling and, with tear-filled eyes, pleaded with Illinois voters to give him another chance. He said, &quot;I got your message and you&#x27;re right ... I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;ve made my share of mistakes, but your priorities are mine.&quot; He won re-election 53% to Seith&#x27;s 46%.

After the Republicans won control of the Senate in 1980, Percy became chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. That year he gave a luncheon in honor of the 16th Karmapa of Tibet at the United States Capitol with other Tibetan Buddhists and congressmen. He served in the Senate until the end of his third term in January 1985, after narrowly losing to Congressman Paul Simon in 1984. Critics had accused Percy of paying more attention to foreign affairs than to the domestic issues of his constituents. After Percy&#x27;s defeat, no Republican would win a senatorial race in Illinois until Peter Fitzgerald in 1998, and no Republican would ever win Percy&#x27;s old seat again.

In 2006, writing about the influence of political lobbies on the U.S. relationship with Israel, political theorists John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt wrote that they believed Percy&#x27;s loss was the result of a campaign waged against him by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). They note that despite a generally pro-Israel voting record, Percy incurred AIPAC&#x27;s wrath by declining to sign the AIPAC-sponsored &quot;Letter of 76&quot; protesting President Ford&#x27;s threatened &quot;reassessment&quot; of U.S. Middle East policy in 1975. Percy also called PLO leader Yasser Arafat more &quot;moderate&quot; than some other Palestinians. Earlier that year, Percy and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Dante Fascell argued that Karl Linnas, a former concentration camp commander who was to be deported from Pennsylvania to Estonia who lied in the papers he used to enter the United States, should not be sent to the Soviet Union. Linnas was found to have ordered, and participated in, the murders of Jews and other prisoners. Percy&#x27;s view, shared by Fascell, Representative Donald L. Ritter of Pennsylvania, and the Helsinki Commission, was that Linnas should be deported, just not to the Soviet Union as it “would be an acknowledgement that the USSR has formally taken over Estonia.”

While in the Senate, Percy was active in business and international affairs. Although he explored the possibility of running for president in both 1968 and 1976, he did not run either time. During the early 1970s, he clashed with President Nixon and criticized the U.S. conduct of the Vietnam War.

In 1977, Percy and Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey—responding to the 1973 OPEC oil embargo and high energy prices in general—created the Alliance to Save Energy to encourage a national commitment to energy efficiency. Percy was the founding chairman of the organization.

Percy was mentioned again for the presidency in 1980 and 1988, but his candidacies did not progress beyond the exploratory stage. In 1981, three congressional staffers (Bill Strauss, Elaina Newport, and Jim Aidala) of Percy&#x27;s Subcommittee on Energy, Nuclear Proliferation, and Government Processes formed the political-satire group the Capitol Steps, which performed for 40 years.

Perhaps Percy&#x27;s most important act, and his longest-lasting legacy, was ending the practice of nominating federal judges from a pool of candidates generated by the Chicago political machine. He implemented a system of consultation with, and advice from, groups of legal experts, including the professional bar association, a practice considered novel at the time. One of his nominees, John Paul Stevens, was selected by President Gerald Ford as a justice of the United States Supreme Court.

==Marriage and family==
Percy was a Christian Scientist. During World War II, he married Jeanne Valerie Dickerson. They had twin daughters, Valerie and Sharon (born 1944) and a son Roger (born 1946). After Jeanne Percy&#x27;s death in 1947, Percy married Loraine Diane Guyer in 1950. They had two children: Gail (born 1953) and Mark (born 1955).

One of his twin daughters, Valerie Percy, was murdered at age 21 in her bedroom in the family home in Kenilworth, Illinois, near Chicago, during his senatorial campaign in September 1966. She had been beaten and stabbed to death in her bed while the family was in residence. Although Valerie&#x27;s stepmother allegedly briefly glimpsed the killer, and considerable resources were devoted to solving the crime, the identity of the murderer remains unknown. The wife of a first responder physician to the scene stated in 2016 that her late husband, Dr. Robert Hohf, felt that &quot;the crime scene had been cleaned up&quot; by the time he arrived to the Percy home early on the morning of September 18, 1966.

In 1967 her twin sister Sharon Percy married John D. Rockefeller IV. He became a politician and was later elected Democratic governor of West Virginia (1977–1985). He served as a United States senator for West Virginia from 1985 until 2015.

Percy remained active after leaving political office but suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in later years. He died on September 17, 2011, at the Washington Home and Community Hospice in Washington, D.C. He was interred at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

<text>Sergei Viktorovich Gonchar (; born 13 April 1974) is a Russian former professional ice hockey player who is currently a Defensive Development Coach with the Vancouver Canucks. He formerly served as an assistant coach for the Pittsburgh Penguins, and has previously played for the Washington Capitals, Boston Bruins, Pittsburgh Penguins (with whom he won the Stanley Cup in 2009), Ottawa Senators, Dallas Stars and the Montreal Canadiens between 1995 and 2015.

==Playing career==
Gonchar began his professional career in 1991 with Traktor Chelyabinsk in the Soviet Championship League. He also played two seasons for Dynamo Moscow.

Gonchar was the first round pick, 14th overall, of the Washington Capitals in the 1992 NHL Entry Draft. He began his North American career in 1994, suiting up in two playoff games for the Capitals&#x27; American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Portland Pirates. He continued with Portland in 1994–95 before making his NHL debut with the Capitals on 7 February 1995, against the Buffalo Sabres. He appeared in 31 games total during the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season. The following year, in his first full-length campaign in the NHL, Gonchar tallied 41 points, showing his potential as an effective offensive defenceman.

In the 1998–99 season, Gonchar became the first Russian defenceman to score over 20 goals in the regular season. The following season, Gonchar broke the 50-point mark for the first time in his career. He also finished in fifth place in Norris Trophy voting as the NHL&#x27;s best defenceman.

After 57- and 67-point (tied for a career high) seasons in 2000–01 and 2002–03 respectively, Gonchar was named to the second All-Star team both seasons.
On 3 March 2004, in his tenth season with the Capitals, Gonchar was traded to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Shaone Morrisonn and two draft picks. Finishing the season with Boston, he amassed 58 points, leading all NHL defencemen. Between 2000 and 2004, Gonchar recorded more points than any other defenceman, with 74 goals and 241 points.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Gonchar returned to Russia to play for Metallurg Magnitogorsk, where he played with future Pittsburgh Penguins teammates Petr Sýkora and Evgeni Malkin. After the lockout, Gonchar signed a five-year, $25 million deal with the Penguins on 4 August 2005. In 2006–07, his second season with Pittsburgh, Gonchar tied a career-high with 67 points. In addition to his on-ice duties for the Penguins, Gonchar housed rookie Evgeni Malkin when he first arrived from Russia in October 2006.

The following season, Gonchar helped lead the Penguins, with offensive superstars Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, to the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals, the franchise&#x27;s first finals appearance since 1992. After a 65-point regular season (the eighth 50-plus point season of his career), Gonchar added 14 points in 20 playoff games as the Penguins eventually lost in the finals to the Detroit Red Wings. Gonchar placed fourth in Norris Trophy voting, tying his best-ever placing for the league&#x27;s best defenceman.
During the first game of the 2008–09 pre-season, Gonchar was hit into the boards by David Kočí in a game against the Tampa Bay Lightning, dislocating his shoulder. It was reported that he would miss four to six months after opting for arthroscopic surgery. While both Gonchar and defense partner Brooks Orpik claimed the hit was late, well after Gonchar had completed a pass, it was judged by Penguins&#x27; head coach Michel Therrien to be a clean hit and that Kočí had simply &quot;finished his check&quot;. With the Penguins struggling to make the playoffs, Gonchar returned to play his first game of the season on 14 February 2009, against the Toronto Maple Leafs after being sidelined for 21 weeks. He played in the final 25 games of the regular season and tallied 19 points, helping the Penguins into the 2009 playoffs as the Eastern Conference&#x27;s fourth seed. However, playing in game four of the conference semi-finals against the Washington Capitals, Gonchar suffered a serious knee injury with a knee on knee hit by Alexander Ovechkin . Despite being initially expected to be out for several weeks and possibly the remainder of the playoffs, Gonchar returned for game seven of the series. Gonchar and the Penguins went on to win the Stanley Cup in seven games, facing the Detroit Red Wings for the second consecutive year. After winning, he revealed he had been playing with a partially torn medial collateral ligament (MCL).

Gonchar was sidelined with injuries again for a total of 20 games in the 2009–10 season. Despite missing time, he went on to record his ninth 50-point season in the past 10 seasons, besting Nicklas Lidström&#x27;s eight. He also had his 11th season with ten goals or more, tying Sergei Zubov for the most 10+ goal seasons among Russian defencemen. Gonchar finished the season third in points-per-game average among defencemen (behind Norris Trophy nominees Mike Green and Duncan Keith). He set an NHL record on 2 March 2010, by scoring his 200th NHL goal, making him the first Russian defenceman to ever do so.
From the 2000–01 season to the 2009–10 season, Gonchar tallied exactly 500 points, which was second among NHL defencemen only to Nicklas Lidström&#x27;s 550. Gonchar was also second among NHL defencemen in assists during that span with 372 assists, behind Lidström&#x27;s 434. He led the League in goals by a defenceman during that span, with 128. Rob Blake was second with 119 goals, while Lidström had 116. Gonchar led the NHL in points-per-game average among NHL defencemen during that span, scoring at 0.80 points per game to Lidström&#x27;s 0.76 points per game. He also led the league in goals created per game among NHL defencemen with 0.27 to Al MacInnis&#x27;s 0.26 and Lidström&#x27;s 0.25. In fact, since his first NHL season in 1995, only Lidström scored more points among defencemen — Lidström tallied 889 points in that time, while Gonchar had 684.

On 1 July 2010, Gonchar signed a three-year, $16 million contract with the Ottawa Senators. The deal included a no-trade clause. During the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Gonchar returned to his native Russia to play with the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL)&#x27;s Metallurg Magnitogorsk. He was traded on 7 June 2013, to the Dallas Stars in exchange for a conditional sixth-round pick in 2013. On 8 June 2013, Gonchar signed a two-year, $10 million contract with the Stars. The following year, on 11 November 2014, Gonchar was again traded, this time to the Montreal Canadiens for left winger Travis Moen.

On 15 May 2015, it was announced by Canadiens&#x27; GM Marc Bergevin, that Gonchar would not return to the Montreal Canadiens the next season. Gonchar remained un-signed over the summer, and accepted an invitation to return to the Pittsburgh Penguins&#x27; training camp on a try-out basis on 14 August 2015. At the conclusion of training camp and during the pre-season, Gonchar was released by the Penguins on 3 October 2015.

==Coaching career==
Gonchar signalled the end of his professional playing career in accepting a development coaching position within the Pittsburgh Penguins organization on 27 October 2015. Gonchar aided the Penguins defensive unit in back to back Stanley Cup championships in 2016 and 2017, resulting in promotion to a full time assistant on July 12, 2017.

On August 12, 2020, it was announced that Gonchar&#x27;s contract, along with those of fellow assistant coaches Mark Recchi and Jacques Martin, would not be renewed for the next season. The decision came following the team&#x27;s loss to the Montreal Canadiens in a best-of-five qualifying round for the 2019-2020 Stanley Cup Playoffs.

On January 22, 2023, the Vancouver Canucks announced the hiring of Sergei Gonchar as a Defensive Development Coach. The decision came alongside the hiring of Rick Tocchet as Head Coach and Adam Foote as Assistant Coach. The Canucks released the following statement about Foote and Gonchar&#x27;s hiring, &quot;We are also excited about the additions of Adam Foote and Sergei Gonchar to our coaching staff. Both individuals enjoyed long, successful playing careers as NHL defenceman
and together provide a wide range of expertise on both sides of the puck. Tocchet, Foote, and Gonchar all bring a championship pedigree to the organization and we look forward to welcoming them to Vancouver.&quot;

<doc id="495499" wikidata="Q1970645" url="?curid=495499" title="Windowlicker">
<text>&quot;Windowlicker&quot; is a track by the British electronic music artist and producer Aphex Twin. It was released on 22 March 1999 through Warp Records. The artwork for the single was created by Chris Cunningham, with additional work by The Designers Republic. Cunningham also directed the song&#x27;s music video, which was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Video.

The song peaked at number 16 on the UK Singles Chart, and was later voted by fans as Warp Records&#x27; most popular song for its 2009 &quot;Warp20&quot; compilation. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; included the song at number 12 on their list of the &quot;Top 200 Tracks of the 90s&quot;.

== Music ==
===Characteristics===
&quot;Windowlicker&quot; has been described variously as &quot;uncompromising cyborg R&amp;B&quot;, &quot;hip-hop written in the language of glitches&quot;, and &quot;eerie lounge-porn music&quot;; the track&#x27;s &quot;sleazy, erotic ambiance connote[s] images and emotions alien to James&#x27;s previous compositions.&quot; Heavily digitally processed and rhythmically rearranged breakbeats prominently appear in the song&#x27;s backing track. Gasps, vocal harmonies and moans reminiscent of sexual vocal tones &quot;glide in and out of the production&quot;; it has been speculated that, like in many of James&#x27;s productions from the late 1990s, the vocals are his own. The track consists of various sections, including a drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass intro, a &quot;gooey middle section&quot;, and an abrasive noise ending, as well as featuring consistent melodic elements throughout.

In 2012 &quot;Pitchfork&quot; stated that the track&#x27;s futuristic elements presaged various musical developments, including &quot;Flying Lotus&#x27; digital deconstruction, James Blake&#x27;s bent vocals, [and] the wobble and knock of dubstep&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Stereogum&quot; stated that &quot;the song&#x27;s mix of unpredictable syncopation, digital-dub alien transformations, errant noises, and bursts of melody would serve as a starting block for much of today&#x27;s electronic music&quot;. Additionally, Daft Punk credited &quot;Windowlicker&quot; as an influence on the direction of their stylistic approach on their 2001 album &quot;Discovery&quot;.

=== Spectrogram ===
A spectrogram of &quot;Windowlicker&quot; reveals a spiral at the end of the song. This spiral is more impressive when viewed with an X-Y scatter graph, X and Y being the amplitudes of the L and R channels, which shows expanding and contracting concentric circles and spirals.

The effect was achieved through use of the Mac-based program MetaSynth. This program allows the user to insert a digital image as the spectrogram. MetaSynth will then convert the spectrogram to digital sound and &quot;play&quot; the picture. According to an article on the website &quot;Wired News&quot;, photographs run through the program tend to produce &quot;a kind of discordant, metallic scratching&quot;.

A logarithmic spectrogram of the track entitled &quot;formula_1&quot; (commonly known as &#x27;Equation&#x27; or &#x27;Formula&#x27;) reveals a portrait of James&#x27; face near the end of the track, grinning.

== Single release ==
The &quot;Windowlicker&quot; single contains its title track and two B-sides. Track two, commonly known as &quot;[Formula]&quot;, &quot;[Equation]&quot;, or, as translated on the Japanese edition, &quot;[Symbol]&quot;, due to its actual title being a complex mathematical formula (&quot;formula_1&quot;), has a very experimental sound. Track three, &quot;Nannou&quot;, dedicated to his then-girlfriend, is made up of wind-up music box samples.

As of 2001 &quot;Windowlicker&quot; had sold over 300,000 copies.

== Music video ==
The music video for &quot;Windowlicker&quot; was directed by Chris Cunningham, who had also directed Aphex Twin&#x27;s previous music video, &quot;Come to Daddy&quot;. It is a ten-minute long parody of contemporary American gangsta hip-hop music videos. In the video, two foul-mouthed young men in Los Angeles are window shopping for women; the French term for window shopping is &quot;faire du lèche-vitrine&quot;, which literally translates to &quot;licking the windows&quot;; &quot;window licker&quot; and &quot;window licking&quot; are pejorative British English terms. They come across two women (referred to in the end credits as &quot;hoochies&quot;) who repeatedly turn down their advances. Suddenly, a ridiculously long white limousine (38 windows in length, including the driver&#x27;s window, which takes 20 seconds to fully display) crashes into the two men&#x27;s black Mazda Miata NA (MX5) convertible, and a &quot;pimped-out&quot; Richard D. James, displaying a hyperbolic amount of wealth and power, emerges with his signature fixed grin, at which point the song begins. After emerging from the limousine, James begins provocatively dancing with an umbrella bearing the Aphex Twin logo in an attempt to seduce the two women. The women then accompany James and other women in his limousine while their faces morph into James&#x27; own likeness. When two women emerge from the limousine&#x27;s sunroof, the young men try to woo them but fail. The men arrive at an area where James and a group of women bearing his face are dancing together, and they receive leis from two of the women. Their attention is eventually drawn to a dancing woman turned away from them, but she turns around to reveal a horrifically ugly, buck-toothed, deformed face (which was later illustrated in a sketch by Swiss artist H. R. Giger titled &quot;The Windowlickers&quot;), much to the men&#x27;s horror. The video ends with James&#x27; women dancing on Santa Monica Beach while James pops and sprays a bottle of champagne.

James&#x27;s faces aren&#x27;t digitally morphed on the women. Masks and make-up were specifically designed by the production, to achieve the desired morphing effect. The cast for the dialogue intro of the clip are Marcus Morris, Gary Cruz, Marcy Turner and Chiquita Martin. Filming was done in the Los Angeles area.

There are 127 uses of profanity in the dialogue segment of the video (which is under 4 minutes), including 44 uses of the word &quot;fuck&quot;. This averages to more than one use of profanity every two seconds. The video was released as a VHS single, containing both uncut and censored versions (the latter being referred to as the &quot;Bleep Version&quot;). It was also nominated for the Best Video award at the BRIT Awards 2000, alongside videos by Supergrass, The Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, and eventual winner Robbie Williams.

The full &quot;Windowlicker&quot; video is restricted to being broadcast only during the nighttime on most music television channels. A bleeped-out version of the video exists, and MTV Two even made a daytime version, with all the opening dialogue removed (the censored version starts with the arrival of the limousine), along with some of its more graphic images. In 2008 MTV Networks Europe was fined by the United Kingdom&#x27;s media regulator Ofcom for several breaches of its broadcasting code, including airing the uncensored version of the &quot;Windowlicker&quot; video on TMF in 2006 before the 9 PM watershed.

== Reception ==

&quot;Windowlicker&quot; received positive reviews from critics. AllMusic gave the EP 4/5 stars. The single was named by &quot;NME&quot; as Single of the Year in its 1999 year-end charts. In September 2010 &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; included the song at number 12 on their list of the &quot;Top 200 Tracks of the 90s&quot;.

== Remixes and use in other media ==
A remix of &quot;Windowlicker&quot; in the acid techno style, entitled &quot;Windowlicker, Acid Edit&quot;, is available on the remix compilation &quot;26 Mixes for Cash&quot;. Another remix of &quot;Windowlicker&quot;, entitled &quot;WINDuckyQuaCKer&quot;, appears on V/VM&#x27;s &quot;HelpAphexTwin/1.0&quot; (2001) and &quot;HelpAphexTwin 4.0&quot; (2003).&lt;ref name=&quot;V/VM – helpaphextwin v4.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A remix entitled &quot;it&#x27;s a richJAMs World&quot; appears on V/VM&#x27;s &quot;HelpAphexTwin 4.0&quot; (2003). Run Jeremy (an alias of Danish producer Anders Trentemøller) also made his own remix of &quot;Windowlicker&quot;.
Beardyman performed a live version of &quot;Windowlicker&quot; as part of his Edinburgh show in 2009.

A. G. Cook made a &quot;note-for-note&quot; cover of Windowlicker in 2017 as part of the PC Music compilation &quot;Month of Mayhem&quot;.

&quot;Windowlicker&quot; is played almost in full in the 2018 Gaspar Noé film &quot;Climax&quot; although this creates an anachronism since the film is set in Winter of 1996 while the EP wasn’t released until 4 years later. 

&quot;Windowlicker&quot; was used in the 2006 movie Grandma&#x27;s Boy (2006 film).

== Track listing ==
All tracks written, produced and engineered by Richard D. James. The original single was released on 12-inch, two separate CDs, a special edition Japanese CD and VHS.

<text>Edward Phillips (August 1630 – c. 1696) was an English author.

==Life==

He was the son of Edward Phillips, of the Crown Office in Chancery, and his wife Anne, only sister of John Milton, the poet. Edward Phillips the younger was born in Strand, London. His father died in 1631, and Anne eventually married her husband&#x27;s successor in the crown office, Thomas Agar. Edward Phillips and his younger brother, John, were educated by Milton. Edward entered Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in November 1650, but left the university in 1651 to work as a bookseller&#x27;s clerk in London.

Although he did not share Milton&#x27;s religious and political views, and seems, to judge from the free character of his &quot;Mysteries of Love and Eloquence&quot; (1658), to have undergone a certain revulsion from his Puritan upbringing, he remained on affectionate terms with his uncle to the end. He was tutor to the son of John Evelyn, the diarist, from 1663 to 1672 at Sayes Court, Deptford, and in 1677–1679 in the family of Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington, a prominent Roman Catholic. The date of Phillips&#x27;s death is unknown but his last book is dated 1696.

==Works==

His most important work is &quot;Theatrum poetarum&quot; (1675), a list of the chief poets of all ages and countries, but principally of the English poets, with short critical notes and a prefatory &quot;Discourse of the Poets and Poetry&quot;, which has usually been traced to Milton&#x27;s hand. He also wrote &quot;The New World of English Words&quot; (1658), which went through many editions; a new edition of &quot;Baker&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;, of which the section on the period from 1650 to 1658 was written by himself from the royalist standpoint; a supplement (1676) to John Speed&#x27;s &quot;Theatre of Great Britain&quot;; and in 1684 &quot;Enchiridion linguae latinae&quot;, said to have been taken chiefly from notes prepared by Milton. John Aubrey states that all Milton&#x27;s papers came into Phillips&#x27;s hands, and in 1694 he published a translation of his &quot;Letters of State&quot; with a valuable memoir.

<text>Columbia Data Products, Inc. (CDP) is a company which produced the first legally reverse-engineered IBM PC clones, starting with the MPC 1600 series in 1982. It faltered in that market after only a few years, and later reinvented itself as a software development company.

==History==
=== 1976–1986: As a hardware company ===
Columbia Data Products was founded by William Diaz in 1976 in Columbia, Maryland. In 1980, Columbia Data Products made some Z80-based computers, most notably their Commander 900 series, which had several models, some of which were multiprocessors and had graphics capabilities.

CDP introduced the MPC 1600 &quot;Multi Personal Computer&quot;, designed by David Howse, in June 1982. It was an exact functional copy of the IBM Personal Computer model 5150 except for the BIOS which was Clean room designed. IBM had published the bus and BIOS specifications, wrongly assuming that this would not be enough to facilitate unlicensed copying of the design, but be enough to encourage the add-on market.

CDP advertisements stated that the MPC &quot;can use software and hardware originally intended for the IBM Personal Computer&quot;. The &quot;Multi&quot; in its name hinted to the fact that it could also run the multi-user operating system MP/M-86. The MPC was the first IBM PC clone and was actually superior to the IBM original. 

It came with 128 KB RAM standard, compared to the IBM&#x27;s 64 KB maximum. The MPC had eight PC expansion slots, with one filled by its video card. Its floppy disk drive interface was built into the motherboard. 

The IBM PC, in contrast, had only five expansion slots, with the video card and floppy disk controller taking two of them. The MPC also included two floppy disk drives, one parallel and two serial ports, which were all optional on the original IBM PC. The MPC was followed up with a portable PC, the 32 pound (15 kg) &quot;luggable&quot; Columbia VP in 1983.

In May 1983, Future Computing ranked Columbia and Compaq computers as &quot;Best&quot; in the category of &quot;Operationally Compatible&quot;, its highest tier of PC compatibility. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; in June 1983 criticized the MPC&#x27;s documentation, but reported that it had very good hardware and software compatibility with the IBM PC. &quot;BYTE&quot; in November 1984 approved of the portable MPC-VP&#x27;s PC compatibility, reporting that it ran &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot;, WordStar, Lotus 1-2-3, dBASE II, and other popular applications without problems. It concluded that the computer was &quot;one of the best overall bargains on the market today&quot;.

The success of the MPC and its successors built CDP revenue from US$9.4 million in 1982 to US$56 million in 1983, with an IPO at US$11 in January 1983.

In February 1984, IBM announced the introduction of their first portable PC, thus putting pressure on its competitors in this niche as well, which besides CDP already included Compaq as the market leader in this segment, as well as Kaypro, TeleVideo Corporation, and Eagle Computer.

Columbia also released upgraded desktop models in order to compete with the IBM PC XT. Their MPC 1600-4, briefly reviewed in &quot;PC Magazine&quot; of April 1984, was found a worthy competitor of the XT and without major compatibility problems, even though its hard drive controller was quite different from IBM XT&#x27;s, being based on a Z80 microprocessor with 64 KB of RAM emulating the ASIC used by IBM.

In May 1984, Richard T. Gralton, formerly a vice-chairman of Savin Corporation, became the president and chief operating officer of CDP.

The competition in the PC market became more intense in June–July 1984 with several companies, including IBM, announcing price cuts, and with AT&amp;T entering the PC market as well. Besides CDP, other PC clone companies like Eagle were also having a hard time as a result. Discussing the perspectives of the smaller PC firms like CDP, Eagle, or Corona Data Systems, one Morgan Stanley analyst was quoted in the June 9, 1984, issue of the &quot;New York Times&quot; saying &quot;Some of them are operating at 5 percent pretax margins, and there is just no room for more price cuts.&quot; By August 1984 the CDP sales were faltering and CDP announced layoffs of 114 employees at its Maryland headquarters and 409 employees at a second factory in Gurabo, Puerto Rico. By April 1985 their stock had dropped to US$0.50 and was delisted. The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in May 1985.

=== 1986–present: As a software company ===

The company was taken private in 1986 and continues to operate under that name.

In 1987 CDP shifted emphasis from hardware to software. They developed and licensed Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) software to Western Digital (WD), a supplier of hard drive controllers. In 1991, WD sold their SCSI business to Future Domain, where it languished.

CDP is now headquartered in Altamonte Springs, Florida. The company currently specializes in data backup.

<text>John Phillips (1631–1706) was an English author, the brother of Edward Phillips, and a nephew of John Milton.

==Life==
Anne Phillips, mother of John and Edward, was the sister of John Milton, the poet. In 1652, John Phillips published a Latin reply to the anonymous attack on Milton entitled &quot;Pro Rege et populo anglicano&quot;. He appears to have acted as unofficial secretary to Milton, but, unable to obtain regular political employment, and (like his brother) chafing against the discipline he was under, he published in 1655, a bitter attack on Puritanism titled a &quot;Satyr against Hypocrites&quot; (1655). In 1656, he was summoned before the privy council for his share in a book of licentious poems, &quot;Sportive Wit&quot;, which was suppressed by the authorities, but almost immediately replaced by a similar collection, &quot;Wit and Drollery&quot;.

In &quot;Montelion&quot; (1660) he ridiculed the astrological almanacs of William Lilly. Two other skits of this name, in 1661 and 1662, also full of coarse royalist wit, were probably by another hand. In 1678, he supported the agitation of Titus Oates, writing on his behalf, says Anthony Wood, many lies and villanies. Dr Oates&#x27;s &quot;Narrative of the Popish Plot&quot; indicated it was the first of these tracts. In the same year he published the first English translation of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier&#x27;s &#x27;Six Voyages&#x27; recounting a lifetime of travel in the Middle East and South Asia.

He began a monthly historical review in 1688, entitled &quot;Modern History or a Monthly Account of all considerable Occurrences, Civil, Ecclesiastical and Military&quot;, followed in 1690, by &quot;The Present State of Europe, or a Historical and Political Mercury&quot;, which was supplemented by a preliminary volume giving a history of events from 1688. He executed many translations from the French language, and a version (1687) of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, which has been called by &quot;Quixote&quot; translator Samuel Putnam the worst English translation ever made of the novel. Putnam goes so far as to say in his Translator&#x27;s Preface that Phillips&#x27;s version &quot;cannot be called a translation&quot;. This is largely because Phillips actually changes the novel by substituting references to famous English locales in place of the original Spanish ones, and including references to things British not found in the original novel.

An extended account of the brothers is given by Wood in &quot;Athenæ Oxononienses&quot; (ed. Bliss, iv. 764 seq.), where a long list of their works is dealt with. This formed the basis of William Godwin&#x27;s &quot;Lives of Edward and John Phillips&quot; (1815), with which was reprinted Edward Phillips&#x27;s &quot;Life of John Milton&quot;.

<text>Sand stargazers are blennioids; perciform marine fish of the family Dactyloscopidae. Found in temperate to tropical waters of North and South America; some may also inhabit brackish environments. The giant sand stargazer (&quot;Dactylagnus mundus&quot;) is the largest at 15 cm in length; all other species are under 10 cm.

These blennies are named well: sand stargazers have protruding eyes on the top of their heads, fixed in an upward gaze, and may be on stalks. Their large mouths are also upturned. The dorsal fin is long and may or may not be continuous, with seven to 23 spines; the pelvic fins are situated below the throat and possess one spine. The anal fin is equally long and flowing. The mouth is fringed, and like the upper edge of the operculum (the gill cover), this fringe is divided into finger-like structures. The body is greatly elongated, and coloration is generally drab.

As their name would suggest, sand stargazers spend most of their time buried in sandy substrates waiting for unsuspecting prey; only the eyes, nose and mouth are usually visible. Their mode of respiration is also unique among the blennioids, using a branchiostegal rather than opercular pump; this is thought to be an adaptation to their largely sedentary, obscured lives. Sand stargazers generally stay within shallow (&lt; 10 m) intertidal zones in areas protected from surges. Small invertebrates and fish make up the bulk of the sand stargazer&#x27;s diet.

The family name Dactyloscopidae derives from the Greek words &quot;daktylos&quot; meaning &quot;finger&quot; (a reference to the divided mouth and operculum fringes) and &quot;skopein&quot; meaning &quot;to watch&quot;.

<text>The Northrop YF-17 (nicknamed &quot;Cobra&quot;) was a prototype lightweight fighter aircraft designed by Northrop aviation for the United States Air Force&#x27;s Lightweight Fighter (LWF) technology evaluation program. The LWF was initiated because many in the fighter community believed that aircraft like the F-15 Eagle were too large and expensive for many combat roles. The YF-17 was the culmination of a long line of Northrop designs, beginning with the N-102 Fang in 1956, continuing through the F-5 family.

Although it lost the LWF competition to the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the YF-17 was selected for the new Naval Fighter Attack Experimental (VFAX) program. In enlarged form, the F/A-18 Hornet was adopted by the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps to replace the A-7 Corsair II and F-4 Phantom II, complementing the more expensive F-14 Tomcat. This design, conceived as a small and lightweight fighter, was scaled up to the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, which is similar in size and weight to the F-15 and ultimately replaced the F-14. A non-naval, export variant developed and marketed by Northrop, the F-18L failed to attract buyers; nevertheless, many air forces have operated the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 as a purely land-based fighter.

==Design and development==
===Background===
The aircraft&#x27;s main design elements date to early 1965, from the internal Northrop project N-300. The N-300 was derived from the F-5E, and features a longer fuselage, small leading-edge root extensions (LERX), and more powerful GE15-J1A1 turbojets, rated at 9,000 lbf (40 kN). The wing position was raised slightly to increase ground clearance for ordnance. The N-300 further evolved into the P-530 Cobra, which uses GE15-J1A5 engines, with a very small 0.25:1 bypass ratio leading to the nickname &quot;leaky turbojet&quot;. The bypass air was required for cooling the afterburner and nozzle and the cool bypass duct surface allowed the engine bay to be constructed of lighter, cheaper materials.

The P-530 wing planform and nose section were similar to the F-5, with a trapezoidal shape formed by a sweep of 20° at the quarter-chord line, and an unswept trailing edge, but was over double the area, with as opposed to of the F-5E. Initially shoulder mounted, the wings were lowered to the mid position. Its most distinctive new feature were the LERXs that tapered into the fuselage under the cockpit. They added about 50% additional lift at angles of attack exceeding 50°, improving maneuvering. The extensions also aligned airflow into the engines at high angles of attack. The resemblance to the head of a cobra led to the adoption of the nickname &quot;Cobra&quot; for the P-530.

===Lightweight Fighter program===
When the Lightweight Fighter program was announced in 1971, Northrop modified the P-530 into the P-600 design that would be designated YF-17A. Whereas the P-530 was intended as a multi-role aircraft, the P-600 was to be strictly an air-to-air demonstrator, and consequently the cannon moved from the underside of the fuselage, to the upper part. Design of the YF-17 and the prototype YJ101 engine, a development of the GE15 engine, consumed over a million man-hours, and 5,000 hours of wind tunnel testing.

The YF-17 was primarily constructed of aluminum, in conventional semi-monocoque stressed-skin construction, though over 900 lb (408 kg) of its structure comprised graphite/epoxy composite. The small nose contained a simple ranging-radar. The cockpit had an ejection seat inclined at 18°, a bubble canopy, and a head-up display (HUD). The thin wings carried no fuel, and in areas such as the leading and trailing edge and the LERX, were composed of a Nomex honeycomb core with composite facesheets. The rear of the aircraft had twin all-moving stabilators of aluminum over a honeycomb core, and twin vertical stabilizers of a conventional construction. Like the wings, the leading and trailing edges were constructed of composite facesheets over honeycomb core. A composite speedbrake was located on top of the fuselage between the engines.

The aircraft was powered by two General Electric YJ101-GE-100 afterburning turbojets, installed next to each other to minimize thrust asymmetry in the event of an engine failure. To minimise engine removal time they were removed from below the aircraft without disturbing the empennage controls. Each engine drove an hydraulic pump for independent aircraft systems. Unlike the P-530, the YF-17 had partial fly-by-wire, called an electronic control augmentation system (ECAS), which used ailerons, rudders, and stabilators for primary flight control.
Studies showed a single vertical stabilizer was insufficient at high angles of attack, and it was changed to twin vertical stabilizers, canted at 45°, resulting in a &quot;relaxed longitudinal stability&quot; design, which enhances maneuverability. Northrop was not yet confident in fly-by-wire controls and retained mechanically actuated flight controls. The resulting aircraft, unveiled on 28 January 1971, had a maximum weight of 40,000 lb (18,144 kg) and maximum speed of Mach 2, but stirred little interest among foreign buyers.

The first prototype (serial number &quot;72-1569&quot;) was rolled out at Hawthorne on 4 April 1974; its first flight at Edwards AFB came on 9 June with Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Chouteau at the controls flying for 61 minutes reaching an altitude of 18,000 feet and a maximum speed of 610 miles per hour. Chouteau afterwards remarked that, &quot;When our designers said that in the YF-17 they were going to give the airplane back to the pilot, they meant it. It&#x27;s a fighter pilot&#x27;s fighter.&quot; The second YF-17 (s/n &quot;72-1570&quot;) first flew on 21 August. Through 1974, the YF-17 competed against the General Dynamics YF-16. The two YF-17 prototypes flew 288 test flights, totaling 345.5 hours. The YF-17 attained a top speed of Mach 1.95, a peak load factor of 9.4 &quot;g&quot;, and a maximum altitude of over . It demonstrated a maximum angle of attack of 68 degrees at 28 kn IAS.

===Naval Fighter Attack Experimental===
Initially, the U.S. Navy was not heavily involved as a participant in the LWF program. In August 1974, Congress directed the Navy to make maximum use of the technology and hardware of the LWF for its new lightweight strike fighter, the VFAX. As neither contractor had experience with naval fighters, they sought partners to provide that expertise. General Dynamics teamed with Vought for the Vought Model 1600; Northrop with McDonnell Douglas for the F-18. Each submitted revised designs in line with the Navy needs for a long-range radar and multirole capabilities.

==Flight testing==
Prototype YF-17 72-1569 was sent to NASA&#x27;s Dryden Research Center for base drag studies from 27 May to 14 July 1976 prior to the first F/A-18 prototype under development.

<doc id="495523" wikidata="Q863764" url="?curid=495523" title="Keeping up with the Joneses">
<text>&quot;Keeping up with the Joneses&quot; is an idiom in many parts of the English-speaking world referring to the comparison of oneself to one&#x27;s neighbor, where the neighbor serves as a benchmark for social class or the accumulation of material goods. Failure to &quot;keep up with the Joneses&quot; is perceived as a demonstration of socio-economic or cultural inferiority. The phrase was coined by a 1910s comic strip of the same name.

==Origins==

The phrase originates with the comic strip &quot;Keeping Up with the Joneses&quot;, created by Arthur R. &quot;Pop&quot; Momand in 1913. The strip ran until 1940 in &quot;The New York World&quot; and various other newspapers. The strip depicts the social climbing McGinis family, who struggle to &quot;keep up&quot; with their neighbors, the Joneses of the title. The Joneses were unseen characters throughout the strip&#x27;s run, often spoken of but never shown. The idiom &quot;keeping up with the Joneses&quot; has remained popular long after the strip&#x27;s end.

The use of the name &quot;Jones&quot; to refer to metaphorical neighbors or friends in discussions of social comparison predates Momand&#x27;s comic strip. In 1879, English writer E. J. Simmons wrote in &quot;Memoirs of a Station Master&quot; of the railroad station as a place for social exchange: &quot;The Joneses, who don&#x27;t associate with the Robinsons, meet there.&quot; American humorist Mark Twain made an allusion to Smith and Jones families with regard to social custom in the essay &quot;Corn Pone Opinions&quot;, written in 1901 but first published in 1923: &quot;The outside influences are always pouring in upon us, and we are always obeying their orders and accepting their verdicts. The Smiths like the new play; the Joneses go to see it, and they copy the Smith verdict.&quot; Starting in 1908, D.W. Griffith directed a series of comedy shorts starring The Biograph Girl, Florence Lawrence, featuring the people next door, The Joneses.

An alternative theory is that the Joneses of the saying refer to the wealthy family of Edith Wharton&#x27;s father, the Joneses. The Joneses were a prominent New York family with substantial interests in Chemical Bank as a result of marrying the daughters of the bank&#x27;s founder, John Mason. The Joneses and other rich New Yorkers began to build country villas in the Hudson Valley around Rhinecliff and Rhinebeck, which had belonged to the Livingstons, another prominent New York family to whom the Joneses were related. The houses became grander and grander. In 1853, Elizabeth Schermerhorn Jones built a 24-room gothic villa called Wyndcliffe described by Henry Winthrop Sargent in 1859 as being very fine in the style of a Scottish castle, but by Edith Wharton, Elizabeth&#x27;s niece, as a gloomy monstrosity. The villa reportedly spurred more building, including a house by William B. Astor (married to a Jones cousin), a phenomenon later described as &quot;keeping up with the Joneses&quot;. The phrase is also associated with another of Edith Wharton&#x27;s aunts, Mary Mason Jones, who built a large mansion at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, then undeveloped. Wharton portrays her affectionately in &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; as Mrs. Manson Mingott, &quot;calmly waiting for fashion to flow north&quot;.

A slightly different version is that the phrase refers to the grand lifestyle of the Joneses who by the mid-century were numerous and wealthy, thanks to the Chemical Bank and Mason connection. It was their relation Mrs William Backhouse Astor, Jr who began the &quot;patriarchs balls&quot; around the end of the 19th century, the origin of &quot;The Four Hundred&quot;, the list of the society elite who were invited. By then the Joneses were being eclipsed by the massive wealth of the Astors, Vanderbilts and others but the four hundred list published in 1892 contained many of the Joneses and their relations—old money still mattered.

==Social effects==
The philosophy of &quot;keeping up with the Joneses&quot; has widespread effects on some societies. According to this philosophy, conspicuous consumption occurs when people care about their standard of living and its appearance in relation to their peers.

According to Roger Mason, &quot;the demand for status goods, fueled by &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot;, has diverted many resources away from investment in the manufacture of more material goods and services in order to satisfy consumer preoccupations with their &quot;relative social standing&quot; and prestige&quot;.

Social status once depended on one&#x27;s family name; however, social mobility in the United States and the rise of consumerism there both gave rise to change. With the increasing availability of goods, people became more inclined to define themselves by what they possessed and the quest for higher status accelerated. Conspicuous consumption and materialism have been an insatiable juggernaut ever since.

Inability to &quot;keep up with the Joneses&quot; might result in dissatisfaction, even for people whose status is high. This could possibly tie in to a concept/theory called the &quot;hedonic treadmill.&quot;

==In popular culture==
In the 1936 book &quot;The Next 100 Years&quot;, Clifford C. Furnas writes that the phenomenon of Keeping up with the Joneses&#x27; ... is descended from the spreading of the peacock&#x27;s tail.&quot;

In the United Kingdom, when Princess Margaret married photographer Anthony Armstrong-Jones in 1960, Wallis Simpson allegedly said: &quot;At least we&#x27;re keeping up with the Armstrong-Joneses&quot;.

The Temptations recorded the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Let The Joneses Get You Down&quot; on their 1969 album Puzzle People.

Nine Days released their song &quot;The Joneses&quot; on their 2002 album So Happily Unsatisfied in which &quot;Keeping up with the Joneses&quot; is the first line of the chorus.

<text>Salient is the weekly students&#x27; magazine of the Victoria University of Wellington Students&#x27; Association (VUWSA) at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. &quot;Salient&quot; was established in 1938 and originally published in newspaper format, but is now published as a magazine. &quot;Salient&#x27;s&quot; style and editorial position can change from year to year due to changes in editors. However, the magazine has generally taken a left-wing stance.

==Organisation==

=== Origins ===
The student magazine of Victoria University of Wellington has been published under a number of different titles since the early twentieth century: &quot;Spike&quot; (1902–1964), &quot;Smad&quot; (1930–1937), and finally &quot;Salient&quot; (1938–present).

&quot;Salient&quot; was originally published in newspaper format, but is now published as a print magazine and online

===Editor===
The &quot;Salient&quot; editor-in-chief is an employee of VUWSA operating under a charter that grants editorial independence. The editor is appointed and employed under a fixed term contract that covers roughly the beginning to end of the academic year. Previous involvement with the magazine is not a prerequisite for applicants, although most have had some role at &quot;Salient&quot; prior to their editorship. At various times in &quot;Salient&#x27;s&quot; history, and consistently since 2011, the editorship has been shared between two people.

Notable past editors include former Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer, editor of Metro magazine Simon Wilson, independent publisher Roger Steele (NZOM), Queen&#x27;s Counsel Hugh Rennie, independent investigative writers such as David Harcourt and &quot;New Zealand Listener&quot; writer Toby Manhire.

====Former editors====
===News===

&quot;Salient&quot; news is predominately focused on student issues, the students&#x27; association, and the university itself. However, &quot;Salient&quot; has also reported on national and international items outside of &quot;student&quot; issues. For instance there was significant coverage of the Iraq invasion in 2003.

&quot;Salient&quot; is a member of the Aotearoa Student Press Association (ASPA), which has intermittently had a press gallery journalist in the New Zealand House of Representatives. The current press gallery representative is Annabel McCarthy.

===Design===

&quot;Salient&quot; employs a full-time designer who is responsible for the look of the magazine. Because the designer is typically employed for only a one-year term, the visual aesthetic of the magazine can change significantly from year to year.

====Former designers====

===Comics===
Salient has been a home to a number of comics and cartoons, and they traditionally have their place on the last page of the magazine. 
Past comics such as ASCII and Grant Buist&#x27;s Brunswick have won critical awards, with ASCII winning an Aotearoa Student Press Association (ASPA) award in 2005. Previous comics have included Being Blind, Man, ASCII (originally published in Waikato University&#x27;s &quot;Nexus&#x27; magazine&#x27;), Newtown Ghetto Anger, The Chronicle, Drunk Duck, Uni Life, Super Academic Friends, The Academic Idol Comic, and G33K by Sparx.

===Website===
As well as publishing in print, &quot;Salient&quot; operates a frequently updated website. In 2013, the &quot;Salient&quot; website was redeveloped, and won the award for best website at the ASPAs. &quot;Salient&quot; publishes an email newsletter called &#x27;Sincerely Salient&#x27;, including news round-ups, local events, and feature highlights.

In late 2019, &quot;Salient&#x27;s&quot; archives were controversially removed from public view after a website upgrade, resulting in the creation of an independent &quot;&#x27;Salient&quot; Archive&#x27; website, which restored public access to 9,879 of the hidden articles.

=== Video ===
&quot;Salient&quot; had a video production arm called &#x27;Salient TV&#x27;, the only department dedicated to video content from any student media publication in New Zealand. Salient TV videos include interviews, comedy sketches, and other miscellaneous content that focuses on student interests. Salient TV videos were primarily found on the magazine&#x27;s Facebook page. Salient TV disbanded in 2019, to widespread disappointment.

===Radio station===
Salient FM, known as VBC until 2015, was a non-profit station which operated at Victoria University of Wellington from 2007 to 2019. It took the place of Radio Active as the university&#x27;s campus-based and student-oriented radio station. It was funded by the university and VUWSA through the budget allocated for Salient, and also had advertisers and sponsors.

In October 2013, VUWSA held a referendum asking whether it should cease funding the station from 2014 after a student moved a motion requesting a referendum at VUWSA&#x27;s AGM. Out of the 2,105 votes cast on the question, 61 percent favoured continuing to fund the VBC.

As of May 2014, VUWSA President Sonya Clark had been made a trustee of the defunct VBC Trust in order to wind it down, so that VUWSA could take control of the station. The Trust owed IRD about $3,000 in unpaid tax, which Clark said VUWSA intended to pay. The 2014 &quot;Salient&quot; editors expressed an interest in transforming the VBC into &quot;Salient Radio&quot;. In 2015, the station was rebranded Salient FM.

Salient FM had a diverse programme targeted at Victoria University of Wellington students. Genres of alternative, electronic, and hip-hop music were most commonly broadcast. The station also heavily encouraged Wellingtonian and New Zealand musical acts. The station also hosted a number of politics and current affairs focused shows, notably the Young Matt Show and Bandwagon Radio. These programmes discussed important political issues and policies, particularly those most relevant to VUW students.

In December 2019, Salient FM was shut down following a decision from the VUWSA CEO Matthew Tucker. Full reasoning behind the Salient FMs discontinuation was not made public. In response to this, an Official Investigation Act request was filed to investigate if cutting the station was unconstitutional. Salient FM&#x27;s two editors Jazz Kane and Nav Nair commented &quot;We&#x27;re pretty confident that it is entirely unconstitutional&quot;.

=== Podcasts ===
After the cessation of Salient FM, &quot;Salient&quot; created Salient Podcasts.

===ASPA Awards===
&quot;Salient&quot; has participated in the ASPA Student Media Awards since their inception in 2003. The magazine dominated the first two years of the awards winning amongst other categories Best Publication in 2003 and 2004. Otago&#x27;s &quot;Critic&quot; is generally seen as &quot;Salient&#x27;s&quot; strongest competition and in 2005 turned the tables, sweeping a number of categories including Best Publication with &quot;Salient&quot; coming second. &quot;Critic&quot; won Best Publication again in 2006 and &quot;Salient&quot; came second.

In 2009, &quot;Salient&quot; won the award for Best Publication. &quot;Salient&quot; dominated these awards with five first places and eight other placings. In 2011, &quot;Salient&quot; also won best publication. However, in 2010, 2012 and 2013 &quot;Salient&quot; was runner-up in best publication to &quot;Critic&quot;.

In 2022, &quot;Salient&quot; won awards for Best Cover, Best Sports Writing, Best Personal Essay, Best Online Presence, Best Centrefold, Best Student Politics Coverage (tied) and Best Editorial (tied).

==Views==
Due to &quot;Salient&quot;&#x27;s changing editorial position (each editor typically holding the position for a one-year period), views expressed in the magazine have been varying throughout history. In general, &quot;Salient&quot; has taken a left-wing approach to politics.

=== Maoism (1964-1981) ===
In this period, many of the editors and contributors to &quot;Salient&quot; were members of the Wellington Marxist-Leninist Organisation (MILO), a Maoist-aligned group with substantial student membership at the time. Consequently, much of the content published in this period was politically charged and Maoist-leaning.

=== Te Ao Mārama (1973-1974, and 1997-present) ===
Te Ao Mārama is an issue of &quot;Salient&quot; focused on Māori issues. Young political groups Ngā Tamatoa and the Te Reo Māori Society influenced the first publication of Te Ao Mārama in 1973 during Māori Language Week, under editor Roger Steele in 1973, in an attempt to support te reo Māori on campus. According to Max Nichol, &quot;Steele credits the Te Reo Māori Society with the idea, and Ngā Tamatoa with putting the issue of revitalising te reo on the agenda in the first place.&quot; Unfortunately, Steele’s editing successors did not continue this mahi to the same degree; &quot;it was not until 1997 that Te Ao Mārama was enshrined in VUWSA’s constitution, obliging &quot;Salient&quot; to produce a Māori language issue annually.&quot;

Presently, Te Ao Mārama is a cherished tradition that allows a voice to Māori voices and issues within the university community. In 2022, Te Ao Mārama was published for the first time entirely in both English and te reo. This was under editor Janhavi Gosavi, and the issue was guest edited by Areta Pakinga.

=== Women&#x27;s rights ===
In the 1980s, &quot;Salient&quot; began to gave more space to issues of women&#x27;s rights. Notably in this time, Sally Zwartz became the second women editor in 1984, the only women to edit previously being Shirley Grinlington in 1941, of who it is speculated to &quot;perhaps [have] gained her position due to the dip in the number of male students during World War Two.&quot;

=== Gay and lesbian liberation ===

== Notable History ==

=== 1985 Defamement allegations and sexual harassment policy ===
1985 editor Jane Hurley faced a legal threat from the university&#x27;s History Department after she had co-edited the VUWSA Student Handbook, which &quot;provided course critiques so that students could assess for themselves which courses and programmes of study might appeal to them.&quot; The handbook noted that a professor in the department was known for “sexual harassment,&quot; causing the department to threaten a defamation suit against the editors and demand retraction. In the first issue of &quot;Salient&quot; in 1985, Hurley attempted to appease the department by writing that the claims of &quot;sexual harassment&quot; may have suggested a higher level of severity, and clarified the misconduct to be &quot;milder&quot; forms of harassment such as &quot;unwanted comments, the innuendo, the disparagement of women simply because they are women.&quot;

Hurley&#x27;s reporting was partly responsible for pushing Victoria University to enforce a sexual harassment policy in 1986, and work to give students support around the issue.

===1995 Waghorn affair===
In 1995, there was controversy surrounding the editor Vic Waghorn, such that a Special General Meeting of VUWSA was called in June to dismiss her from the role. The motion to dismiss Waghorn at the meeting was soundly defeated 250 to 3, but it was not the end of the matter. Personal grievances and accusations she had misappropriated funds led to her being suspended in September by the VUWSA Executive. In response, Waghorn managed to change the cover of the final issue of &quot;Salient&quot; &quot;to a cartoon depiction of cunnilingus captioned &#x27;suck it hard&#x27;&quot;. Most of the covers were removed before release however.

The affair led to a change to the VUWSA constitution so that it would be harder to dismiss a &quot;Salient&quot; editor in the future.

===2005 Fee rise leak and court injunction===
In September 2005, the Vice-Chancellor of Victoria University obtained a court injunction to prevent an issue of &quot;Salient&quot; from being distributed – thought to be the first time in the magazine&#x27;s history this has happened. The issue of &quot;Salient&quot; contained information obtained from leaked University Council documents with details about possible university fee increases of 5 to 10 percent. The controversy made national media, with several items on the television news. The university failed to realise that information was put on to the ASPA newswire, hence the information was published in several other student magazines and on the internet. Distribution of &quot;Salient&quot; was eventually allowed, four days late after &quot;Salient&quot; and the university reached an out-of-court settlement. The documents were returned to the university, reportedly with pictures of male genitalia drawn over them.

===2006 Listing of Chinese people as a species to be wary of===
In April 2006, &quot;Salient&quot; published a short piece which put Han Chinese people, along with animals like poisonous snakes and penguins, in a list of &quot;top five species we should be wary of&quot;. The supposed &quot;joke&quot; upset the Chinese community and caused huge protests from both Chinese students and the Chinese Embassy. Accused of being blatantly racist, editor James Robinson apologised, saying &quot;It was a ridiculous jab that was honestly so stupid I didn&#x27;t even think twice about it.&quot; However, he argued people who were offended had misinterpreted it: &quot;We put &#x27;the Chinese&#x27; between &#x27;penguins&#x27; and &#x27;very poisonous snakes&#x27; on the list, and people somehow took it seriously.&quot; He also defended his right to publish it, saying &quot;It&#x27;s not hate speech or inciting violence against the Chinese race. It would be a dangerous precedent to come out and say, &#x27;Sorry, we were totally out of our minds to print such a thing&#x27;.&quot; Many questioned Robinson&#x27;s credentials in defining what is and is not an appropriate reaction to racism. Nick Kelly, 2006 Students&#x27; Association President, posted an apology calling the article &quot;xenophobic and inappropriate ... in poor taste&quot;.

===2008 Naked Hu Jintao cover===
In May 2008, &quot;Salient&quot; published a feature article concerning the rise of China as a new world superpower. To promote this article the cover that week depicted a naked, yet to be identified, &quot;Salient&quot; staffer draped in a Chinese flag, with Hu Jintao&#x27;s face photoshopped onto their own. The cover invoked a strong reaction from the Wellington Chinese community, with students removing the magazine from distribution at the university&#x27;s Karori Campus. Following this disruption, the Chinese Students&#x27; Association of Victoria University presented a petition of 133 signatures calling for an apology. To date, &quot;Salient&quot; has not apologised.

===2009 Lundy 500===

In July 2009, &quot;Salient&quot; editor Jackson Wood courted controversy by announcing the &quot;Lundy 500&quot;, an event whereby &quot;teams of vehicles ... [would] travel from Petone to Palmerston North as convicted double murderer Mark Lundy did in 2000, before murdering wife Christine and daughter Amber, according to the prosecution at his 2002 trial.&quot; Participants were tasked with doing the trip in 68 minutes or less, the same time Lundy is argued to have driven the distance. Wood argued that the &quot;event was designed to draw attention to some of the inconsistencies in the New Zealand legal system&quot;, and emphasised that he wasn&#x27;t encouraging anyone to break the law. However, the proposed event was harshly criticised in the media, and on 2 August, it was announced that the event was to be cancelled. Wood apologised to the Lundy family and wrote that: &quot;He acknowledged that their viewpoints were not adequately taken into account before the event was announced on Friday, and that there were other ways for this point to be communicated&quot;.

A similar re-enactment of the travel involved in the Lundy case, dubbed the &quot;Lundy Three Hundy&quot; was proposed in 2013 by Nic Miller. It was likewise criticised in the media, with Mathew Grocott writing that &quot;this event should not go ahead and if those involved have any human decency then it won&#x27;t go ahead.&quot;
