<text>Michael Ballack (; born 26 September 1976) is a German former professional footballer. He was selected by Pelé as one of FIFA&#x27;s 100 Greatest Living Players, and as the UEFA Club Midfielder of the Year in 2002. He won the German Footballer of the Year award three times – in 2002, 2003 and 2005. Ballack was known for his passing range, powerful shot, physical strength and commanding presence in midfield.

Ballack began his career as a youth at enterprise sports community BSG Motor &quot;Fritz Heckert&quot; Karl-Marx-Stadt in 1983. He then joined the youth department of football club FC Karl-Marx-Stadt. Ballack made his debut for Germany&#x27;s under-21 side on 26 March 1996. Although the team were relegated in his first season, his performances in the Regionalliga the following season led to a transfer to 1. FC Kaiserslautern in 1997. He won the Bundesliga in his first season at the club, his first major honour. He became a first team regular in 1998–99 season and also earned his first senior national cap for Germany. He moved to Bayer Leverkusen for €4.1 million in 1999. The 2001–02 season saw him win a slew of runners-up medals: Bayer Leverkusen finished second in the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal, UEFA Champions League and Germany lost to Brazil in the 2002 World Cup Final.

A €12.9 million move to Bayern Munich led to further honours: the team won the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal double in 2003, 2005 and 2006. Ballack had become a prolific goalscorer from midfield, scoring 58 goals for Bayern between 2002 and 2006. He joined Premier League club Chelsea in mid-2006 and won English honours in his first season at the club. Injury ruled him out of much of 2007, but he returned the following season to help Chelsea reach their first ever Champions League final. He also went on to win the FA Cup again in 2009 and then once more as part of a league and cup double in 2010.

Internationally, Ballack has played in the UEFA European Football Championship in 2000, 2004 and 2008, and the FIFA World Cup in 2002 and 2006. Jürgen Klinsmann appointed him captain of the national team in 2004. Ballack scored consecutive game-winning goals in the quarter-final and semi-final to help his country to the 2002 World Cup final and led his team to the semi-finals of the 2006 World Cup and the Euro 2008 final. He is among the top goal scorers in the history of the Germany national team. 

==Early life==
Ballack was born on 26 September 1976 in Görlitz, a town in Bezirk Dresden, East Germany (now Saxony, Germany). He is the only child of Stephan Ballack, an engineer, and his wife Karin, a secretary. The family moved to Chemnitz (then called Karl-Marx-Stadt) when Ballack was very young and it was there that he started to play football. He first began playing football for sports community.

== Club career ==

=== Chemnitzer FC ===
Ballack&#x27;s parents sent him to train with sports community BSG Motor &quot;Fritz Heckert&quot; Karl-Marx-Stadt at the age of seven. Ballack was praised by coach Steffen Hänisch. Hänisch was particularly impressed by the well-developed technique for Ballack&#x27;s age and his ability to shoot with both feet. Ballack was then allowed to attend the elite Children and Youth Sports School (KSJ) &quot;Emil Wallner&quot; in Karl-Marx-Stadt. He then joined the larger and more promoted football club FC Karl-Marx-Stadt (renamed Chemnitzer FC in 1990) in 1988. The father of Ballack had played second-division football himself in Germany.

In 1995, Ballack earned his first professional contract, thanks to his performances in the role of central midfielder. He was dubbed the &quot;Little Kaiser&quot;, in reference to Franz Beckenbauer, who was nicknamed &quot;Der Kaiser&quot;. His professional debut came on 4 August 1995, on the first day of the new 2. Bundesliga season. Chemnitz lost the game 2–1, against VfB Leipzig. At the end of the season, during which Ballack made 15 appearances, Chemnitz were relegated to the multi-tiered, regional third division. The following season, Ballack became a regular first-team player as Chemnitz missed out on an immediate return to the Bundesliga. He did not miss a game and scored ten goals for the &quot;Sky Blues&quot;. It was not enough for Chemnitz to be promoted, but in the summer of 1997, coach Otto Rehhagel of just-promoted 1. FC Kaiserslautern signed Ballack at their return to top flight football.

=== 1. FC Kaiserslautern ===
It was during the seventh match of the 1997–98 Bundesliga season, away to Karlsruhe, that Rehhagel decided to give Ballack his first Bundesliga appearance, substituting him onto the field for the final five minutes of the encounter. On 28 March 1998, Ballack made his first-team debut-start against Bayer Leverkusen.

Ballack made 16 appearances for his new team during the season as the club became the first-ever newly promoted team to lift the Bundesliga title. In the following season, Ballack became both a regular member of the team (he made 30 appearances, scoring 4 goals in the league) and one of the side&#x27;s leading players. Kaiserslautern reached the quarter finals of the Champions League, but were eliminated by Bayern Munich.

On 1 July 1999, Ballack moved to Bayer Leverkusen at age 22 for a transfer fee of €4.1 million.

=== Bayer Leverkusen ===
It was at Bayer Leverkusen that Ballack made his breakthrough. Coaches Christoph Daum and Klaus Toppmöller granted him an attacking role in the midfield. Ballack was instrumental to the success of Leverkusen, scoring 27 goals in the league and nine in Europe over the course of his three seasons at the BayArena.

In 2000, Bayer Leverkusen needed only a draw against minnows SpVgg Unterhaching to win the Bundesliga title, but an own goal by Ballack helped send the team to a crushing 0–2 defeat, while Bayern Munich clinched the title with a 3–1 victory over Werder Bremen. The 2001–02 season was a disappointing one for Bayer Leverkusen. In the Bundesliga, the team surrendered a five-point lead at the top of the table over the last three games of the season to finish second behind Borussia Dortmund; lost the UEFA Champions League final 2–1 to Real Madrid; and lost the DFB-Pokal final 4–2 to Schalke 04. These three runner-up finishes were dubbed a &quot;Treble Horror&quot;: Bayer Leverkusen was dubbed &quot;Bayer Neverkusen&quot; in English, while the German nickname became &quot;Vizekusen&quot;. Ballack and Leverkusen teammates Bernd Schneider, Carsten Ramelow and Oliver Neuville were also beaten finalists with Germany in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, although Ballack was suspended for the final itself. Ballack finished with 17 league goals and his performance over the season led to him being voted into the UEFA.com users&#x27; Team of 2002 as well as being named German Footballer of the Year.

=== Bayern Munich ===

In spite of Real Madrid&#x27;s interest, Ballack decided to sign with Bayern Munich in a €6 million deal in 2002 after his impressive performances in the World Cup. In his first season with the club, Bayern won the Bundesliga with 75 points as well as the DFB-Pokal, with Ballack scoring twice and defeating former club 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the latter&#x27;s final. In his second season, however, Bayern lost both their Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal crowns to Werder Bremen.

In his third season with the Bavarians, Ballack enjoyed success in the 2004–05 season as Bayern Munich completed another double. New coach Felix Magath stated he was the only automatic starter in their midfield. In four seasons at Bayern, Ballack won three Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal doubles, scoring 44 goals in 107 Bundesliga matches. Between 1998 and 2005, Ballack scored 61 goals in total in the domestic league.

Ballack&#x27;s critics, however, noted his frequent &quot;choking&quot; in important Champions League matches. This resulted in open public criticism from club general manager Uli Hoeneß, communications director Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and club president Franz Beckenbauer, all former Bayern players. Beckenbauer later went as far as to accuse Ballack of &quot;saving his strength&quot; for prospective employers after Ballack turned in an average performance in the 2006 DFB-Pokal final against Eintracht Frankfurt.

=== Chelsea ===
Ballack agreed to join English Premier League club Chelsea on a free transfer on 15 May 2006. During his last season with Bayern, there were rumours of interest from Manchester United, Real Madrid, Internazionale and Milan, but Ballack instead chose to go to Stamford Bridge. Shortly after arriving at Chelsea, Ballack stated that he hoped to end his career at Chelsea.

====2006–07 season====

Ballack&#x27;s debut for Chelsea came on 31 July 2006, during a practice match at UCLA&#x27;s intramural football pitch. Chelsea presented him to the media the following day where the club also gave him his favoured number 13 shirt, worn throughout his career. Upon doing so, William Gallas, who previously wore the number 13 shirt for Chelsea, was given the number 3 shirt. This move created animosity between Gallas and the club as Gallas felt that he was underappreciated. Ballack made his competitive debut in the 2006 FA Community Shield, but went off injured in the first half. On 27 August 2006, Ballack made his Premier League debut for Chelsea against Blackburn Rovers. On 12 September, he scored his first goal for the club on his Champions League debut against Werder Bremen.

He received the first straight red card of his career in Chelsea&#x27;s 1–0 win over Liverpool on 17 September 2006, after being judged to have stamped on Mohamed Sissoko&#x27;s leg. Ballack scored his first Premier League goal on 21 October 2006 against Portsmouth at Stamford Bridge with a header. His first FA Cup goal came in the 109th minute in the semi-final against Blackburn on 15 April 2007. This goal resulted in Chelsea progressing into the FA Cup final. He scored eight goals in all competitions for the club in the 2006–07 season, including a free-kick against Everton at Goodison Park, as well as a half-volley against Porto which sent Chelsea through to the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Throughout his first season at Chelsea, Ballack was criticised for his lethargic performances – for playing as though he had &quot;a huge cigar in his mouth&quot;.

On 29 April 2007, Chelsea released a statement on their official website, informing fans that Ballack had undergone ankle surgery in Munich. As a result, Ballack did not play in the FA Cup final against Manchester United, which Chelsea won 1–0 through Didier Drogba&#x27;s extra time goal. This was Ballack&#x27;s second trophy this season, his first being the League Cup, the final of which he started.

====2007–08 season====
Despite persistent rumours in the summer 2007 transfer window, Ballack denied that he wanted to leave and no such move materialised. Chelsea left Ballack out of their Champions League squad for the 2007–08 group stage as they realised that his injury would prevent him from playing any useful part and preferred to select the fully fit Steve Sidwell. The German international had an ankle operation in the summer and Chelsea could not take the risk of him not regaining full fitness before the end of the group stage. Thus, Ballack could not play in the Champions League before the knockout stages began in February. The club was only able to select 23 out of a possible 25 players for their Champions League squad due to the new UEFA regulations on &quot;association-trained players&quot; and &quot;club-trained players&quot;. Due to this regulation, Chelsea were also unable to select young player Scott Sinclair and could only pick 23 players as their only &quot;club-trained player&quot; was John Terry. For this reason, it was deemed unwise to gamble on Ballack being fit at some point.

Ballack made his return to the side in Chelsea&#x27;s 2–0 League Cup win over Liverpool on 19 December 2007. Ballack tallied an assist late in the game to striker Andriy Shevchenko. On 26 December 2007, Ballack made his Premier League return in a thrilling game against Aston Villa which ended 4–4. He came on for Frank Lampard in the 26th minute after the latter had picked up a thigh injury. In first-half stoppage time, he won a penalty after being brought down in the box by Zat Knight, which Andriy Shevchenko converted. In the 88th minute, with the score tied at 3–3, Ballack stepped up to take a free-kick, which he buried into the bottom left corner of the goal, but the match ended in a 4–4 draw.
Ballack captained the Chelsea team in the absence of captain John Terry and vice-captain Frank Lampard in a 2–1 win over Newcastle United on 29 December 2007. Ballack then played his 50th game in a Chelsea shirt in a 2–1 win against Fulham in which he scored the winning goal for Chelsea. He also scored the only goal that won the match for Chelsea against Reading to extend the blues&#x27; winning streak to a record of nine. And, on 5 March 2007, he scored again, this time against Olympiacos in the Champions League round of 16 in a 3–0 win. He scored the winning goal in the 2–0 win in the second leg of the quarter-finals against Fenerbahçe, a victory that secured Chelsea a place in the semi-finals.

Ballack continued to score vital goals and, on 26 April 2008, he scored a header and a penalty to give Chelsea a 2–1 win over Manchester United. He was named Man of The Match for his performance. It brought the two teams level in the race for the Premier League title only two matchdays before the end of the season.

The season ended on a low note for Ballack as Chelsea finished runners-up in the League Cup, Premier League and Champions League. This completed another treble horror for Ballack and his club. On 29 June 2008, Germany, captained by Ballack, lost to Spain 1–0 in the final of UEFA Euro 2008. This became the second season in Ballack&#x27;s career after 2002 that he was runner-up for four major trophies.

====2008–09 season====
The 2008–09 season started well for Ballack, as he set up Joe Cole to score the first goal in a 4–0 win over Portsmouth in the first game of the season. Ballack was injured shortly after missing the games against Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal. Ballack&#x27;s return from injury has been a lift for Chelsea as he set up Deco to score a scissor kick in a 2–0 win against Bolton Wanderers. Ballack&#x27;s first goal of the &#x27;09 season came against Southend United in their FA Cup replay, a match which Chelsea went on to win 4–1. Ballack&#x27;s first Premier League goal of the 2008–09 season came on 11 April 2009 in a match against Bolton, ending 4–3 for Chelsea. He came on as a second-half substitute as Chelsea won the 2009 FA Cup final. On 2 June 2009, Ballack signed a one-year contract extension with Chelsea.

====2009–10 season====
In Chelsea&#x27;s second game of the season, away at Sunderland, Ballack scored his first goal of the 2009–10 campaign in their 3–1 win. Ballack also scored against Burnley in a 3–0 win. Ballack made his first Champions League appearance for the season against Porto. On 20 September 2009, he scored his third league goal, against Tottenham. On 17 January 2010, he scored his fourth league goal and third assist in a 7–2 win against Sunderland. In Chelsea&#x27;s fifth round FA Cup tie against Cardiff City, Ballack scored the goal which put &quot;the Blues&quot; back in front; Chelsea ultimately won 4–1.

Ballack was sent off in Chelsea&#x27;s 4–2 defeat against Manchester City on 27 February 2010. Chelsea went on to win the 2009–10 Premier League, Ballack&#x27;s first league title in England. He also started as Chelsea were victorious against Portsmouth in the 2010 FA Cup final, however he would come off injured shortly before half-time after a tackle by Kevin-Prince Boateng. As a result of the injury, Ballack was not able to participate in the 2010 World Cup.
On 9 June 2010, it was announced that Ballack, along with teammates Joe Cole and Juliano Belletti, would leave Chelsea on a free transfer after his contract was not renewed. It was reported that while manager Carlo Ancelotti wanted to retain Ballack, club owner Roman Abramovich was only willing to offer a one-year deal due to Ballack&#x27;s age. As of December 2012, Ballack had the lowest loss record of any player with more than 100 appearances in the Premier League, losing just 10 of his 105 appearances.

=== Return to Bayer Leverkusen ===
On 25 June 2010, Ballack signed a two-year contract with former club Bayer Leverkusen. On 19 August 2010, he scored the first goal for Leverkusen in a 3–0 win against Tavriya Simferopol in the UEFA Europa League qualifiers. On 6 October 2010, it was announced that Ballack would not play again in 2010 at the club or international level due to a shin injury sustained 11 September 2010 in a Bundesliga match against Hannover 96.

On 20 February 2011, Ballack made his return from injury, coming on as a substitute for Simon Rolfes against VfB Stuttgart; Leverkusen won the match 4–2. Ballack scored his second Europa League goal against Metalist Kharkiv, a match Leverkusen won 2–0 and the two-legged tie 6–0 on aggregate to progress to the round of 16. Ballack played the full 90 minutes against Schalke 04, assisting Eren Derdiyok&#x27;s goal in an eventual 2–0 victory.

=== Retirement ===
Ballack announced his retirement on 2 October 2012. He had been in talks with Major League Soccer&#x27;s Montreal Impact and A-League club Western Sydney Wanderers.

On 5 June 2013, Ballack played a farewell match at Leipzig&#x27;s Red Bull Arena. The match was won by a World XI 4–3 against the &quot;Friends of Ballack&quot;, with Ballack scoring his second hat-trick in his career. First he scored two goals with &quot;Friends of Ballack&quot; in the first half and scored his third goal and the winner in the second half for the World XI. Participants in the match included former teammates and friends Lothar Matthäus, Didier Drogba, Miroslav Klose, Andriy Shevchenko, Phillip Lahm, Hasan Salihamidžić, Dimitar Berbatov, Michael Essien, André Schürrle, Ricardo Carvalho, Dietmar Hamann, Florent Malouda, Carsten Jancker, Torsten Frings, Jens Lehmann, Christian Wörns, Mehdi Mahdavikia and Per Mertesacker, as well as Formula 1 racing driver Michael Schumacher. The teams were coached by Ballack&#x27;s former Chelsea coach José Mourinho and his former national team coach Rudi Völler.

== International career ==

On 26 March 1996, Ballack debuted for the Germany national under-21 team against Denmark, shortly after signing for Chemnitzer FC. In all, he played 19 matches for this side, scoring four goals. Then, following his move to 1. FC Kaiserslautern, senior team head coach Berti Vogts called him up to the squad.

Ballack&#x27;s first senior Germany appearance, however, did not come until 28 April 1999, when he came on as a substitute for Dietmar Hamann in a match against Scotland.

Ballack only played 63 minutes at UEFA Euro 2000. In the 2002 FIFA World Cup, he scored in matches against the United States and South Korea during the knockout rounds as Germany reached the final. However, he was booked for a tactical foul during the semi-final match against South Korea and was suspended for the final, which Germany went on to lose 2–0 to Brazil. He was included in the World Cup All Star Team. Ballack missing the final ultimately led to a lasting revision of the yellow card amnesty rule in order &quot;to give the best players a chance to play in the final&quot;. Following Euro 2004, Jürgen Klinsmann replaced Rudi Völler at the helm of the national team and Ballack took over from Oliver Kahn as captain. He scored three goals — all penalties — in the 2005 Confederations Cup, in which Germany were eliminated by Brazil in the semifinals.
In the 2006 World Cup, he was unable to start in Germany&#x27;s first game against Costa Rica due to a calf strain, but appeared in the following five matches. Germany were eliminated in the semi-finals, but they managed to clinch third place in a match against Portugal. He was named Man of the Match in the games against Ecuador and Argentina, and was included in FIFA&#x27;s World Cup All Star Team for a second consecutive time. After the tournament, Klinsmann stood down as national team head coach and was succeeded by assistant Joachim Löw.

Ballack started and captained Germany in their first game of Euro 2008 against Poland. He proved to be an influential figure in the midfield as Germany came back from a shock defeat to Croatia to make it to the final, scoring a free kick against Austria to secure Germany a 1–0 win and a place in the quarter-finals. In the quarter-finals, he scored a header against Portugal to make the score 3–1 in their 3–2 win after an assist by Bastian Schweinsteiger&#x27;s 60th minute free-kick, helping Germany to advance to the semi-finals. Germany went on to beat Turkey 3–2 in the semifinals. Prior to the final, Ballack sustained a calf injury but eventually overcame it in time. Germany, however, ended up losing 1–0 to Spain. Nevertheless, he was named in the Squad of the Tournament.

Ballack scored four goals in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, but missed the 2010 World Cup after suffering an ankle injury from a foul by Portsmouth&#x27;s Kevin-Prince Boateng in the 2009–10 FA Cup final. Ballack did travel to South Africa to provide moral support for the national team but he departed after Philipp Lahm, who was appointed team captain due to Ballack&#x27;s injury, commented after the quarter-finals that he would not relinquish the captaincy back to Ballack. Team manager Oliver Bierhoff criticized Lahm&#x27;s comments and clarified the situation, saying, &quot;Philipp Lahm is the World Cup captain and Michael Ballack is still the captain.&quot;
Germany played strongly in the tournament despite Ballack&#x27;s absence, including a 4–1 win over England and a 4–0 win over Argentina en route to finishing third, thanks to emerging midfield talents such as Sami Khedira, Thomas Müller, and Mesut Özil. Former German captain Lothar Matthäus suggested that Ballack&#x27;s absence had allowed these young players to blossom.

Since the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, Ballack had not been called up for any international matches. It was reported that Germany coach Joachim Löw was waiting for Ballack to retire from international football after the 2010 World Cup, however Ballack refused to give up despite a rash of injuries suffered in 2010–11 with Bayer Leverkusen. On 16 June 2011, it was announced that Ballack would no longer be a part of the national team. The German Football Association (DFB) offered him two friendlies to reach 100 matches for Germany, which he refused, accusing Löw of disrespecting him ever since his injury dating back to March 2010 and calling the invitation to compete in another two games for Germany a &quot;farce&quot;.

Ballack organized a farewell game by himself and invited Löw and Lahm. The teams on the pit were named Worldplayers vs. Ballack and Friends. Lahm played for 90 minutes. In attendance were Boris Becker, Michael Schumacher, Lothar Matthäus and Rudi Völler.

== Style of play ==
Ballack is considered to be one of the best and most versatile midfielders of his generation; normally deployed in the centre in a box-to-box role, he played in several midfield positions during his career, including in the roles of offensive and holding midfielder, and was noted for his powerful shot with both feet. Due to his tall frame, he was also known for his ability in the air, which made him a goal threat on set pieces. He also excelled at making late runs into the penalty area.

On a technical level, he was a commanding, physically strong and aggressive player, with excellent passing range, who moved the ball efficiently, and who was capable of creating chances for his team. An elegant player on the ball, the technicality and intelligence of his game was extremely high. He started his football career as a sweeper, but when he moved to Leverkusen in 1999, then-coach Christoph Daum moved him to midfield. He adapted to playing in a deeper role on occasion during his spell at Chelsea. Ballack was also a strong tackler, which combined with his stamina, as well as his aerial, playmaking, and goalscoring abilities, made him a &quot;complete midfielder,&quot; as he was once described by Ben Welch of &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; magazine in 2013.

Beyond his playing ability, Ballack also stood out for his leadership qualities throughout his career. In 2011, Ballack&#x27;s international coach at the time, Joachim Löw, praised him, describing him as a player who &quot;exudes authority and calm on the pitch&quot;. Despite his ability as a player, his later career was often limited by recurring injury struggles.

== Personal life ==
Ballack&#x27;s surname is of Sorbian origin. He was the only child of father Stephan, an engineer who played third-division football, and mother Karin, a secretary and swimmer.

On 14 July 2008, Ballack married his long-time girlfriend Simone Lambe. The couple had three children together: Louis (born 2001), Emilio (2002–2021), and Jordi (born 2005). The couple divorced in 2012. He dated Natacha Tannous from 2015 to 2019.

During Euro 2012, the 2014 World Cup, and Euro 2016, Ballack worked as a studio analyst for ESPN, often alongside Alexi Lalas.

His son, Emilio, died in a quad bike crash on 5 August 2021 at the age of 18.

<doc id="501455" wikidata="Q1393663" url="?curid=501455" title="Peter Rice (structural engineer)">
<text>Peter Rice (Peter Ronan Rice, 16 June 1935 – 25 October 1992) was an Irish structural engineer.

Born in Dublin, he grew up in 52 Castle Road, Dundalk in County Louth, and spent his childhood between the town of Dundalk, and the villages of Gyles&#x27; Quay and Inniskeen. He was educated at Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast where he received his primary degree and spent a year at Imperial College London. Rice acted as Structural Engineer on three of the most important architectural works of the 20th century: the Sydney Opera House (with Ove Arup), Pompidou Centre and the Lloyd&#x27;s Building and was renowned for his innate ability to act as both engineer and designer.

He originally studied Aeronautical Engineering but switched to Civil Engineering. Taken on by Ove Arup &amp; Partners, his first job was the roof of the Sydney Opera House. He married Sylvia Watson in 1960 and they had one son (who became an engineer) and three daughters.

Jonathan Glancey in his obituary said &quot;Rice was, perhaps, the James Joyce of structural engineering. His poetic invention, his ability to turn accepted ideas on their head and his rigorous mathematical and philosophical logic made him one of the most sought-after engineers of our times&quot;.

==Philosophy==

He believed the best buildings result from the symbiotic relationship between the architect and the engineer where the engineer is the objective inventor and the architect the creative input. He found the Anglo-Saxon understanding of the work of an engineer restrictive and preferred the French and Italian interpretation of the role.

==Work==

Among the notable buildings on whose design he worked are the Centre Pompidou, the Sydney Opera House, Lloyd&#x27;s of London, the Louvre Pyramid, the Mound Stand at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground, Kansai International Airport and Stansted Airport. Towards the end of his life he was largely responsible for the new façade of Lille Cathedral.

==Career==

===Sydney Opera House===
In 1956, he joined Ove Arup &amp; Partners. In 1957, he took leave to pursue post-graduate studies at Imperial College, rejoining Arup in 1958. After three years working on Jørn Utzon shells for the roof of the Sydney Opera House in London, where he is credited with having done the geometry for the challenging design, he moved to Sydney to be an assistant engineer to Ian MacKenzie. After one month MacKenzie fell ill and was hospitalised, leaving Rice in total charge at the age of 28. On-site his geometrical knowledge enabled him to write a computer program to locate the segments of the shells correctly. In total he spent seven years working on the project. Afterwards, he spent 18 months in the United States, in New York City and as a visiting scholar at Cornell University.

===Pompidou Centre (Beaubourg)===

In 1971, he was part of the winning team competing in the French government&#x27;s competition for the centre of Paris at Beaubourg, partnering with Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano. Edmund Happold was the senior Arup engineer for the competition. Rice became the engineer for the built project which was greatly modified from the initial design. Art and technology were intertwined in the design enabling him to experiment with materials. He brought the concepts of humanity, tactility and scale to the project. His team developed the which enabled the counterbalancing of the weight of the building with light tubing, lightening the external appearance. He specified that these were to be made in cast steel.

After the Pompidou Centre, Rice set up his own company in 1977—&quot;RFR&quot;—along with Martin Francis and Ian Ritchie although he continued with Arup as a partner. In 1978 he was involved with Rogers again, this time on Lloyd&#x27;s of London, completed in 1984. During this time his other projects encompassed the Fleetguard Factory at Quimper in France, and Stansted Airport in London.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
Although Rice was based in London, where he worked with Michael Hopkins on the tented Mound Stand at Lord&#x27;s, much of his work was in Paris, including the great glass walls of the Cité des Sciences at La Villette and the tent-like canopy that softens the monumentality of the Grand Arche at La Défense. In 1985 I. M. Pei asked his help with projects at the Louvre in Paris, namely the shell structures for the glass roofs that Pei planned to cover inner courtyards.

By then he was in great demand continuing to work with architects such as Richard Rogers, I. M. Pei, Norman Foster, Ian Ritchie, Kenzo Tange, Paul Andreu, and Renzo Piano. The projects he worked on ranged from Toronto&#x27;s unbuilt Opera House by Moshe Safdie to Kansai&#x27;s International Airport, one of many projects with the Renzo Piano Building Workshop. 

In addition to his huge output, he was known for his sympathetic attitude to design, his strategic approach, a cool head and managing to realise ambitious artistic designs in concrete reality. One of his marks as an engineer was the length of time he allowed to complete a project.

During his relatively short career, Rice&#x27;s contribution to the built environment can be seen in the work of the Pritzker Prize winners, including I. M. Pei, Kenzō Tange, Jørn Utzon, Frei Otto, Richard Rogers, Norman Foster, Renzo Piano, and Zaha Hadid.

===Innovative techniques===
* During the Sydney Opera House project, was among the first to use advanced computer modelling.
* One of the key advances in building the Sydney Opera House was the use of post-tensioned concrete to reinforce the components of the shells. 
* In his design for the Seville Expo &#x27;92, Rice used post-tensioned stone to construct the arcade.

==Awards==

Peter Rice was made an honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (HonFRIBA) in 1988. In 1992, he was the second engineer to be awarded the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture by the Royal Institute of British Architects (the first was Ove Arup), and the second Irishman after Michael Scott. The award is conferred by the Sovereign annually for work that has &quot;promoted, either directly or indirectly, the advancement of architecture.&quot;

==Death==

He was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 1991 and died the following year aged 57. A sign has been put up outside his childhood home, 52 Castle Road, Dundalk, County Louth, saying &quot;Birthplace of Peter Rice, Engineer, 1935–1992&quot;. The plaque was erected privately by the (then) Dundalk Town Architect, Paul Clancy.

==Legacy==

Peter Rice has been influential in the development of building technology; he thus contributed to extend architectural engineering as a professional field. Rice has intricately tied the disciplines of structural engineering and architectural technology. Among Rice&#x27;s major achievements are his contribution to the development of structural glazing and the optimisation of tensile structures using steel, glass and wood. Through his mathematical insight, Rice refined the engineering methods applied to slender, lightweight structures.

Rice&#x27;s book, &quot;An Engineer Imagines&quot;, was posthumously published and came to be considered an important work in the history of building design.
The Peter Rice Prize was established at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design in 1994 in recognition of the ideals and principles represented by the late eminent engineer.
The Peter Rice Silver Medal competition was established at Dundalk Institute of Technology (his home town) in 1996 under the patronage of Ove Arup and Engineers Ireland (Institution of Engineers of Ireland). This medal is awarded annually, to the best presentation by an engineering student of the institute on their practical project activity.
In 2019, a documentary by Marcus Robinson, &quot;An Engineer Imagines&quot;, was screened by Channel 4 and in cinemas.

In 2012-2013, to celebrate Rice&#x27;s 20-year anniversary, Arup organised the exhibition &quot;Traces of Peter Rice&quot; with a documentary.

In 2023 on the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Sydney Opera House, the Irish postal service, A Post, issued a stamp to mark the contribution of Rice to its opening. David McRedmond, the Chief Executive of the Irish Post said, “Ireland has been slow to recognise its contribution to Modernism. The 50th anniversary of Sydney Opera House is the perfect time to celebrate the role of Irish people, and of engineer Peter Rice in particular, to the great canon of world-class architecture and engineering.”

<text>A computer poker player is a computer program designed to play the game of poker (generally the Texas hold &#x27;em version), against human opponents or other computer opponents. It is commonly referred to as pokerbot or just simply bot. As of 2019, computers can beat any human player in poker.

== On the Internet ==
These bots or computer programs are used often in online poker situations as either legitimate opponents for humans players or a form of cheating. As of 2020, all use of Real-Time Assistance (RTA) or automated bots is considered cheating by all online poker sites, although the level of enforcement from site operators varies considerably. 

=== Player bots ===
Use of player bots or computer assistance while playing online poker is prohibited by most, if not all, online sites. Actions taken for breaches are a permanent ban and confiscation of winnings. One kind of bot can interface with the poker client (in other words, play by itself as an auto player) without the help of its human operator. Real-Time Assistance (RTA) is another method of using computer programs. RTA is when a human player uses program called a “solver” such as PioSOLVER or PokerSnowie, running on a different computer, to make their decisions.

The issue of unfair advantage is twofold. For one, bots can play for many hours at a time without human weaknesses such as fatigue and can endure the natural variances of the game without being influenced by human emotion (or &quot;tilt&quot;). Secondly, since 2019, the computer program Pluribus (poker bot) is successful enough at reading bluffs, calculating odds, and adjusting to strategy that it consistently beats professional poker players at 6-player no-limit Hold’em.

==== House enforcement ====
While the terms and conditions of poker sites generally forbid the use of bots, the level of enforcement depends on the site operator. Some will seek out and ban bot users through the utilization of a variety of software tools. The poker client can be programmed to try to detect bots although this is controversial in its own right as it might be seen as tantamount to embedding spyware in the client software. Another method is to use CAPTCHAs at random intervals during play to catch automated bots, although isn’t effective against Real-Time Assistance.

=== House bots ===
“House bots” can pose a conflict of interest. By the strictest definition, a house bot is an automated player operated by the online poker room itself. These type of bots would be the equivalent of brick and mortar shills.

Both brick and mortar casino shills and online house bots are not supposed to have access to any information that is not also available to any other player in the hand. The problem is that in an online setting the house has no way to prove their bots are not receiving sensitive information from the card server. This is further exacerbated by the ease with which clandestine information sharing can be accomplished in a digital environment. It is essentially impossible even for the house to prove that they do not control some players.

== Artificial Intelligence ==
Like in the games of chess, Go (game), and many other games, artificial intelligence systems beat even the best humans at poker. Poker is a game of imperfect information (because some cards in play are concealed) thus making it harder for anyone (including a computer) to deduce the final outcome of the hand. Because of this lack of information, the computer&#x27;s programmers used to have to implement systems based on the Bayes theorem, Nash equilibrium, Monte Carlo simulation or neural networks, all of which are imperfect techniques. Pluribus, however, perfected poker by only looking ahead a few moves to determine what action to take, rather than attempting to evaluate all moves until the end of the game.

Older AIs like PokerSnowie and Claudico were created by allowing the computer to determine the best possible strategy by letting it play itself an enormous number of times. For years, this was the approach to poker AI, as opposed to attempting to make a computer that plays like a human. This resulted in odd bet sizing and a much different strategy than humans are used to seeing.

Methods were first developed to approximate perfect poker strategy from the game theory perspective in the heads-up (two player) game, and then for the multi-player game. Perfect strategy has multiple meanings in this context. From a game-theoretic optimal point of view, a perfect strategy is one that cannot expect to lose to any other player&#x27;s strategy; however, optimal strategy can vary in the presence of sub-optimal players who have weaknesses that can be exploited. In this case, a perfect strategy is one that correctly or closely models those weaknesses and takes advantage of them to make a profit, such as those explained above.

AI broke through to superhuman performance in poker during the 2010s, with the following timeline. In 2015, computers solved heads-up limit hold&#x27;em via Cepheus. Around 2018, Libratus demonstrated superhuman ability in heads-up no-limit hold&#x27;em. In 2019, Pluribus (a newer version of Libratus) demonstrated superhuman ability at six-player no-limit hold&#x27;em, the most commonly played single variety of poker in the world. In 2021, Microsoft released the older poker-playing program, Libratus, commercially, which then beat four professional poker players in a 20-day long poker competition at Rivers Casino.

== Research groups ==

=== Neo Poker Laboratory ===
Neo Poker Lab was an established science team focused on the research of poker artificial intelligence. For several years it developed and applied state-of-the-art algorithms and procedures like regret minimization and gradient search equilibrium approximation, decision trees, recursive search methods as well as expert algorithms to solve a variety of problems related to the game of poker. Neo Poker Lab’s website, https://www.neopokerlab.com is no longer running.

=== The University of Auckland Game AI Group ===
Until 2017, a team from the University of Auckland consisted of a small number of scientists who employ case-based reasoning to create and enhance Texas Hold’em poker agents. The group applied different AI techniques to a number of games including participation in the commercial projects Small Worlds and Civilization (video game).

=== Computer Poker Research Group (University of Alberta, Canada) ===
Until 2019, a large amount of the research into computer poker players was being performed at the University of Alberta by the Computer Poker Research Group, led by Dr. Michael Bowling. The group developed the agents &quot;Poki&quot;, &quot;PsOpti&quot;, &quot;Hyperborean&quot; and Polaris. &quot;Poki&quot; has been licensed for the entertainment game &quot;STACKED&quot; featuring Canadian poker player Daniel Negreanu. &quot;PsOpti&quot; was available under the name &quot;SparBot&quot; in the poker training program &quot;Poker Academy&quot;. The series of &quot;Hyperborean&quot; programs have competed in the Annual Computer Poker Competition, most recently taking three gold medals out of six events in the 2012 competition. The same line of research also produced Polaris, which played against human professionals in 2007 and 2008, and became the first computer poker program to win a meaningful poker competition.

In January 2015, an article in &quot;Science&quot; by Michael Bowling, Neil Burch, Michael Johanson, and Oskari Tammelin claimed that their poker bot Cepheus had &quot;essentially weakly solved&quot; the game of heads-up limit Texas hold &#x27;em.

=== School of Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University ===
T. Sandholm and A. Gilpin from Carnegie Mellon University started poker AI research in 2004 beginning with unbeatable agent for 3-card game called Rhode-Island Hold &#x27;em. Next step was GS1 which outperformed the best commercially available poker bots. In 2006, poker agents from this group started participating in annual computer competitions. &quot;At some point we will have a program better than the best human players&quot; – claimed Sandholm, whose bot, Claudico, faced off against four human opponents in 2015. 

In 2017 the program&#x27;s software, Libratus, faced off against four professional poker players. By the end of the experiment the four human players had lost a combined $1.8 million of simulated money to Libratus.

In 2019, Libratus was replaced by the final version called Pluribus (poker bot).

== Historic contests ==

=== ICCM 2004 PokerBot competition ===
One of the earliest no-limit poker bot competitions was organized in 2004 by International Conference on Cognitive Modelling. The tournament hosted five bots from various universities from around the world. The winner was Ace Gruber, from University of Toronto.

=== ACM competitions ===
The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) used to host competitions where the competitors submit a piece of software capable of playing poker on their specific platform. The event hosts conducted the contests by operating the software and reporting the results.

=== The 2005 World Series of Poker Robots ===
In the summer 2005, the online poker room Golden Palace hosted a promotional tournament in Las Vegas, at the old Binions, with a $100k giveaway prize. It was billed as the 2005 World Series of Poker Robots. The tournament was bots only with no entry fee. The bot developers were computer scientists from six nationalities who traveled at their own expense. The host platform was Poker Academy. The event also featured a demonstration heads-up event with Phil Laak.

=== University of Alberta&#x27;s Man V Machine experiments ===
In the summer 2007, the University of Alberta hosted a highly specialized heads-up tournament between humans and their Polaris bot, at the AAAI conference in Vancouver, BC, Canada. The host platform was written by the University of Alberta. There was a $50k maximum giveaway purse with special rules to motivate the humans to play well. The humans paid no entry fee. The unique tournament featured four duplicate style sessions of 500 hands each. The humans won by a narrow margin.

In the summer of 2008, the University of Alberta and the poker coaching website Stoxpoker ran a second tournament during the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas. The tournament had six duplicate sessions of 500 hands each, and the human players were Heads-Up Limit specialists. Polaris won the tournament with 3 wins, 2 losses and a draw. The results of the tournament, including the hand histories from the matches, are available on the competition website.

=== The 2015 Brains vs AI competition by Rivers Casino, CMU and Microsoft ===
From April–May 2015, Carnegie Mellon University Sandholm&#x27;s bot, Claudico, faced off against four human opponents, in a series of no-limit Texas Hold&#x27;em matches. Finally, after playing 80,000 hands, humans were up by a combined total of $732,713. But even though humans technically won, scientists considered the win as statistically insignificant (rather, a statistical tie) when that $732,713 is compared to the total betting amount of $170,000,000 ($170 million). However, some have determined this claim to be disingenuous. Statistically insignificant here means that the programmers of Claudico can not say with 95% confidence (a 95% confidence interval) that humans are better than the computer program. However, it is a statistically significant win on a 90% confidence interval. This means that the human players are somewhere between a 10 to 1 and 20 to 1 favorite.

The way the tournament was structured was in two sets of two players each. In each of the two sets, the players got the opposite cards. Meaning if the computer has As9c (Ace of Spades &amp; Nine of Clubs) and the human has Jh8d on one computer, the other of the two players in the set will have As9c up against the computer&#x27;s Jh8d. However, even with the human players winning more than the computer—not all of the players were positive in their head-to-head match ups.

The totals for each of the players winnings were as follows:
* Douglas Polk: +$213,671
* Dong Kim: +$70,491
* Bjorn Li: +$529,033
* Jason Les: -$80,482

=== The Annual Computer Poker Competition ===
From 2006 to 2018, the Annual Computer Poker Competition ran a series of competitions for poker programs. Since 2010, three types of poker were played: Heads-Up Limit Texas Hold&#x27;em, Heads-Up No-Limit Texas Hold&#x27;em, and 3-player Limit Texas Hold&#x27;em. Within each event, two winners are named: the agent that wins the most matches (Bankroll Instant Run-off), and the agent that wins the most money (Total Bankroll). These winners are often not the same agent, as Bankroll Instant Run-off rewards robust players, and Total Bankroll rewards players that are good at exploiting the other agents&#x27; mistakes. The competition was motivated by scientific research, and there was an emphasis on ensuring that all of the results are statistically significant by running millions of hands of poker. The 2012 competition had the same formats with more than 70 million hands played to eliminate luck factor.

Some researchers developed web application where people could play and assess quality of the AI. So as of December 2012 the following top groups and individual researchers’ agents could be found:
* Hyperborean (9 gold, 5 silver and 3 bronze)
* Bluffbot (1 gold, 3 silver and 2 bronze medals)
* Sartre (1 gold, 5 silver and 3 bronze medals)
* Neo Poker Bot (1 gold, 5 bronze medals)

==== Results ====

=== Pluribus ===
The final poker contest was not public. When the Pluribus (poker bot) program consistently beat professionals at 6-hand no-limit Hold’em, the result was quietly announced on a Facebook post.

<text>Population dynamics is the type of mathematics used to model and study the size and age composition of populations as dynamical systems. Population dynamics is a branch of mathematical biology, and uses mathematical techniques such as differential equations to model behaviour. Population dynamics is also closely related to other mathematical biology fields such as epidemiology, and also uses techniques from evolutionary game theory in its modelling. 

== History ==
Population dynamics has traditionally been the dominant branch of mathematical biology, which has a history of more than 220 years, although over the last century the scope of mathematical biology has greatly expanded.

The beginning of population dynamics is widely regarded as the work of Malthus, formulated as the Malthusian growth model. According to Malthus, assuming that the conditions (the environment) remain constant (&quot;ceteris paribus&quot;), a population will grow (or decline) exponentially. This principle provided the basis for the subsequent predictive theories, such as the demographic studies such as the work of Benjamin Gompertz and Pierre François Verhulst in the early 19th century, who refined and adjusted the Malthusian demographic model.

A more general model formulation was proposed by F. J. Richards in 1959, further expanded by Simon Hopkins, in which the models of Gompertz, Verhulst and also Ludwig von Bertalanffy are covered as special cases of the general formulation. The Lotka–Volterra predator-prey equations are another famous example, as well as the alternative Arditi–Ginzburg equations.

== Logistic function ==
Simplified population models usually start with four key variables (four demographic processes) including death, birth, immigration, and emigration. Mathematical models used to calculate changes in population demographics and evolution hold the assumption of no external influence. Models can be more mathematically complex where &quot;...several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with the data.&quot; For example, in a closed system where immigration and emigration does not take place, the rate of change in the number of individuals in a population can be described as:
formula_1
where is the total number of individuals in the specific experimental population being studied, is the number of births and &quot;D&quot; is the number of deaths per individual in a particular experiment or model. The algebraic symbols , and stand for the rates of birth, death, and the rate of change per individual in the general population, the intrinsic rate of increase. This formula can be read as the rate of change in the population () is equal to births minus deaths ().

Using these techniques, Malthus&#x27; population principle of growth was later transformed into a mathematical model known as the logistic equation:
formula_2
where is the population size, is the intrinsic rate of natural increase, and is the carrying capacity of the population. The formula can be read as follows: the rate of change in the population () is equal to growth () that is limited by carrying capacity . From these basic mathematical principles the discipline of population ecology expands into a field of investigation that queries the demographics of real populations and tests these results against the statistical models. The field of population ecology often uses data on life history and matrix algebra to develop projection matrices on fecundity and survivorship. This information is used for managing wildlife stocks and setting harvest quotas.

== Intrinsic rate of increase ==

The rate at which a population increases in size if there are no density-dependent forces regulating the population is known as the &quot;intrinsic rate of increase&quot;. It is
formula_3
where the derivative formula_4 is the rate of increase of the population, is the population size, and is the intrinsic rate of increase. Thus &quot;r&quot; is the maximum theoretical rate of increase of a population per individual – that is, the maximum population growth rate. The concept is commonly used in insect population ecology or management to determine how environmental factors affect the rate at which pest populations increase. See also exponential population growth and logistic population growth.

==Epidemiology==
Population dynamics overlap with another active area of research in mathematical biology: mathematical epidemiology, the study of infectious disease affecting populations. Various models of viral spread have been proposed and analysed, and provide important results that may be applied to health policy decisions.

== Geometric populations ==

The mathematical formula below is used to model geometric populations. Such populations grow in discrete reproductive periods between intervals of abstinence, as opposed to populations which grow without designated periods for reproduction. Say that the natural number is the index the generation ( for the first generation, for the second generation, etc.). The letter is used because the index of a generation is time. Say denotes, at generation , the number of individuals of the population that will reproduce, i.e. the population size at generation . The population at the next generation, which is the population at time is:
formula_5
where 
* is the number of births in the population between generations and ,
* is the number of deaths between generations and ,
* is the number of immigrants added to the population between generations and , and 
* is the number of emigrants moving out of the population between generations and .

For the sake of simplicity, we suppose there is no migration to or from the population, but the following method can be applied without this assumption. Mathematically, it means that for all , . The previous equation becomes:
formula_6

In general, the number of births and the number of deaths are approximately proportional to the population size. This remark motivates the following definitions.
* The birth rate at time is defined by .
* The death rate at time is defined by .
The previous equation can then be rewritten as:
formula_7

Then, we assume the birth and death rates do not depend on the time (which is equivalent to assume that the number of births and deaths are effectively proportional to the population size). This is the core assumption for geometric populations, because with it we are going to obtain a geometric sequence. Then we define the geometric rate of increase to be the birth rate minus the death rate. The geometric rate of increase do not depend on time , because both the birth rate minus the death rate do not, with our assumption. We obtain:
formula_8
This equation means that the sequence is geometric with first term and common ratio , which we define to be . is also called the finite rate of increase.

Therefore, by induction, we obtain the expression of the population size at time :
formula_9
where is the finite rate of increase raised to the power of the number of generations.
This last expression is more convenient than the previous one, because it is explicit. For example, say one wants to calculate with a calculator , the population at the tenth generation, knowing the initial population and the finite rate of increase. With the last formula, the result is immediate by plugging , whether with the previous one it is necessary to know , , ..., until .

We can identify three cases:
* If , i.e. if , i.e. (with the assumption that both birth and death rate do not depend on time ) if , i.e. if the birth rate is strictly greater than the death rate, then the population size is increasing and tends to infinity. Of course, in real life, a population cannot grow indefinitely: at some point the population lacks resources and so the death rate increases, which invalidates our core assumption because the death rate now depends on time.
* If , i.e. if , i.e. (with the assumption that both birth and death rate do not depend on time ) if , i.e. if the birth rate is strictly smaller than the death rate, then the population size is decreasing and tends to .
* If , i.e. if , i.e. (with the assumption that both birth and death rate do not depend on time ) if , i.e. if the birth rate is equal to the death rate, then the population size is constant, equal to the initial population .

=== Doubling time ===

The doubling time () of a population is the time required for the population to grow to twice its size. We can calculate the doubling time of a geometric population using the equation: by exploiting our knowledge of the fact that the population () is twice its size () after the doubling time.

formula_10

The doubling time can be found by taking logarithms. For instance:
formula_11
Or:
formula_12

Therefore: formula_13

=== Half-life of geometric populations ===

The half-life of a population is the time taken for the population to decline to half its size. We can calculate the half-life of a geometric population using the equation: by exploiting our knowledge of the fact that the population () is half its size () after a half-life.

formula_14
where is the half-life.

The half-life can be calculated by taking logarithms (see above).
formula_15

Note that as the population is assumed to decline, , so .

===Mathematical relationship between geometric and logistic populations===

In geometric populations, and represent growth constants (see 2 and 2.3). In logistic populations however, the intrinsic growth rate, also known as intrinsic rate of increase () is the relevant growth constant. Since generations of reproduction in a geometric population do not overlap (e.g. reproduce once a year) but do in an exponential population, geometric and exponential populations are usually considered to be mutually exclusive. However, both sets of constants share the mathematical relationship below.

The growth equation for exponential populations is formula_16 where is Euler&#x27;s number, a universal constant often applicable in logistic equations, and is the intrinsic growth rate.

To find the relationship between a geometric population and a logistic population, we assume the is the same for both models, and we expand to the following equality:
formula_17
Giving us formula_18 and formula_19

== Evolutionary game theory ==

Evolutionary game theory was first developed by Ronald Fisher in his 1930 article &quot;The Genetic Theory of Natural Selection&quot;. In 1973 John Maynard Smith formalised a central concept, the evolutionarily stable strategy.

Population dynamics have been used in several control theory applications. Evolutionary game theory can be used in different industrial or other contexts. Industrially, it is mostly used in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, although it can be adapted for use in single-input-single-output (SISO) systems. Some other examples of applications are military campaigns, water distribution, dispatch of distributed generators, lab experiments, transport problems, communication problems, among others.

== Oscillatory ==
Population size in plants experiences significant oscillation due to the annual environmental oscillation. Plant dynamics experience a higher degree of this seasonality than do mammals, birds, or bivoltine insects. When combined with perturbations due to disease, this often results in chaotic oscillations.

==In popular culture==
The computer game &quot;SimCity&quot;, &quot;Sim Earth&quot; and the MMORPG Ultima Online, among others, tried to simulate some of these population dynamics.

<doc id="501468" wikidata="Q1126046" url="?curid=501468" title="Congressional Space Medal of Honor">
<text>The Congressional Space Medal of Honor was authorized by the United States Congress in 1969 to recognize &quot;any astronaut who in the performance of his or her duties has distinguished himself or herself by exceptionally meritorious efforts and contributions to the welfare of the Nation and mankind&quot;. It&#x27;s awarded by the President of the United States in Congress&#x27;s name on recommendations from the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The award is a separate decoration from the Medal of Honor, which is a military award for extreme bravery and gallantry in combat.

While the Congressional Space Medal of Honor is a civilian award of the United States government, it is authorized as a non-military decoration for display on U.S. military uniforms because it is awarded by a federal agency. In such cases, the Congressional Space Medal of Honor is worn as a ribbon &quot;immediately preceding the Prisoner of War Medal&quot;. DoD policy specifically prohibits wear of any non-military awards for valor or service, but the Congressional Space Medal of Honor only recognizes meritorious achievement, so it does not fall under this prohibition.

To be awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, an astronaut must perform feats of extraordinary accomplishment while participating in space flight under the authority of NASA. Typically, the Congressional Space Medal of Honor is awarded for scientific discoveries or actions of tremendous benefit to mankind. The decoration may also be awarded for extreme bravery during a space emergency or in preventing a major space disaster, or posthumously to those astronauts who die while performing a U.S. space mission. , all 17 astronauts killed on US missions had been awarded the medal.

President George W. Bush awarded the most CSMOH with 16; 14 of them posthumous for crews of the two destroyed space shuttle flights, &quot;Challenger&quot; and &quot;Columbia&quot;. President Joe Biden awarded the CSMOH to Crew Dragon Demo-2 members Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken on January 31, 2023. The 16-year hiatus from April 2006 to January 2023 is the longest gap between awards.

==Recipients==
The medal has been awarded to 28 astronauts, of which 17 were made posthumously for those who died preparing for or during an American spaceflight. Of those 17, three died in the Apollo 1 fire, seven died in the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, and seven in the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster. Four of the twelve moonwalkers received the medal (Armstrong, Conrad, Shepard, and Young), but only Neil Armstrong for his lunar mission. The New Nine class of U.S. astronauts (the second group of astronauts selected by NASA) has the most recipients of the medal, with seven. Second is NASA Astronaut Group 8 which received five awards, four for astronauts killed in the &quot;Challenger&quot; Disaster ( is the only Group 8 astronaut to receive the award who was not killed in the &quot;Challenger&quot; Disaster).

Six recipients are living, three over 80 years old. Frank Borman was the last remaining of the first six recipients of the CSMOH in 1978.

In the table below, an asterisk indicates a posthumous award.

<doc id="501478" wikidata="Q214252" url="?curid=501478" title="Stable">
<text>A stable is a building in which working animals are kept, especially horses or oxen. The building is usually divided into stalls, and may include storage for equipment and feed.

== Styles ==

There are many different types of stables in use today; the American-style stable called a barn, for instance, is a large barn with a door at each end and individual stalls inside or free-standing stables with top and bottom-opening doors. The term &quot;stable&quot; is additionally utilised to denote a business or a collection of animals under the care of a single owner, irrespective of their housing or whereabouts.

A building with tie stalls is also known as stanchion or stall barn, where animals are tethered by the head or neck to their stall. It is mostly used in the dairy cow industry, but traditionally horses were also tied up.

The exterior design of a stable can vary widely based on climate, building materials, historical period and cultural styles of architecture. A wide range of building materials can be used, including masonry (bricks or stone), wood and steel. Stables range in size from a small building housing one or two animals to large facilities that house hundreds of animals.

== History ==

During the times when horses were the primary mode of transportation, European high society and royalty kept large stables of horses to pull carriages, ride, and breed. Many of these stables were elaborately constructed and still exist today.

In England, the stable was historically the second building constructed on a farm. The world&#x27;s oldest horse stables were discovered in the ancient city of Pi-Ramesses in Qantir, in Ancient Egypt, and were established by Ramesses II (c. 1304–1213 BC). These stables covered approximately 182,986 square feet, had floors sloped for drainage, and could contain about 480 horses.
Free-standing stables began to be built from the 16th century. They were well built and placed near the house because these animals were highly valued and carefully maintained. They were once vital to the economy and an indicator of their owners&#x27; position in the community. Relatively few examples survive of complete interiors (i.e. with stalls, mangers and feed racks) from the mid-19th century or earlier.

Traditionally, stables in Great Britain had a hayloft on the upper floor and a pitching door at the front. Doors and windows were symmetrically arranged. Their interiors were divided into stalls and usually included a large stall for a foaling mare or sick horse. The floors were cobbled (or, later, bricked) and featured drainage channels. An outside stone stairway constructed against the side of the building was common for reaching the upper level.

== Other uses ==

The word &quot;stable&quot; is also used metonymically to refer to the collection of horses that the building contains (for example, &quot;the college&#x27;s stable includes a wide variety of breeds&quot;) and even, by extension, metaphorically to refer to a group of people—often (but not exclusively) athletes—trained, coached, supervised or managed by the same person or organisation. For example, art galleries typically refer to the artists they represent as their stable of artists. Analogously, car enthusiast magazines sometimes speak of collectible cars in this way, referring to the cars in a collector&#x27;s stable.

Historically, the headquarters of a unit of cavalry, not simply their horses&#x27; accommodation, was known as a &quot;stable&quot;.

<doc id="501483" wikidata="Q230412" url="?curid=501483" title="Lili Boulanger">
<text>Marie-Juliette Olga &quot;Lili&quot; Boulanger (; 21 August 189315 March 1918) was a French composer and the first female winner of the Prix de Rome composition prize. Her older sister was the noted composer and composition teacher Nadia Boulanger.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===

As a child prodigy born in Paris, Boulanger&#x27;s talent was apparent at a very young age; at the age of two, she was already singing melodies by ear. Her parents, both of whom were musicians, encouraged their daughter&#x27;s musical education. Her mother, Raissa Myshetskaya (Mischetzky) (1858–1935), was a Russian princess who married her Paris Conservatoire teacher, Ernest Boulanger (1815–1900), who won the Prix de Rome in 1835. Her father was 77 years old when she was born and she became very attached to him. Her grandfather Frédéric Boulanger had been a noted cellist and her grandmother Juliette a singer.

Boulanger accompanied her ten-year-old sister Nadia to classes at the Paris Conservatoire before she was five, shortly thereafter sitting in on classes on music theory and studying organ with Louis Vierne. She also sang and played piano, violin, cello and harp. Her teachers included Marcel Tournier and Alphonse Hasselmans for harp, Mme Hélène Chaumont for piano and Fernand Luquin for violin. However, Lili was not allowed to work on her musical studies due to her pneumonia from 6 years old until she was 16 years old.  After waiting patiently, she studied harmony with Georges Caussade and composition with Paul Vidal at the Paris Conservatoire. Although she was studying under such talented composers and musicians at the conservatoire, she had one main supporter and devoted friend—her sister and best friend, Nadia.

===Career: Prix de Rome and after===
In 1912, Boulanger competed in the Prix de Rome but during her performance she collapsed from illness. She returned in 1913 at the age of 19 to win the composition prize for her cantata &quot;Faust et Hélène&quot;, becoming the first woman to win the prize. The text was written by Eugene Adenis based on Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;. The cantata had many performances during her lifetime. Because of the prize, she gained a contract with the music publisher Ricordi.

Nadia Boulanger had given up entering the Prix de Rome after four unsuccessful attempts and focused her attention on her role as assistant in Henri Dallier&#x27;s organ class at the Conservatoire, where Lili studied harmony, counterpoint and composition with Paul Vidal and Georges Caussade, under the Conservatoire&#x27;s director Gabriel Fauré—the last of whom was impressed by her talents and frequently brought songs for her to read. Boulanger was greatly affected by the 1900 death of her father; many of her works touch on themes of grief and loss. Her work was noted for its colorful harmony and instrumentation and skillful text setting. Aspects of Fauré and Claude Debussy can be heard in her compositions, and Arthur Honegger was influenced by her innovative work.

According to Caroline Potter, “The two sisters were both influenced by Debussy, and it appears they had similar literary tastes to the elder composer. Both sisters set poems by Maurice Maeterlinck, who was the author of the play &quot;Pelléas and Mélisande&quot; and also of &quot;Princesse Maleine&quot;; in February 1916, Maeterlinck authorized Lili to set the latter play as an opera. Allegedly, Lili had almost completed the opera before her death, though only the short score of act 1, scene 2, two versions of the libretto, and a sketchbook have survived.&quot;

=== Illness and death ===
She suffered from chronic illness, beginning with a case of bronchial pneumonia at age two that weakened her immune system, leading to the intestinal tuberculosis that ended her life at the age of 24. Although she loved to travel and completed several works in Italy after winning the Prix de Rome, her failing health forced her to return home, where she and her sister organised efforts to support French soldiers during World War I. Her last years were a productive time musically as she labored to complete works. Her death left unfinished the opera &quot;La princesse Maleine&quot; on which she had spent most of her last years.

Boulanger died in Mézy-sur-Seine. In 1979, her sister Nadia Boulanger was buried in the same tomb. It also contains the remains of their parents.

== Music ==
Boulanger grew up in a time of musical transition and her music fits easily into what was becoming defined as a post-Romantic style. Like Debussy, Boulanger associated herself more with Symbolism than Impressionism, with her music featuring the sense of obscurity and indirection more common in Symbolism. However, she also “explored the ‘Impressionists’ palette of nonfunctional seventh and ninth chords, parallel chords, and modal progressions”. While much of Boulanger’s music reflects the feelings of isolation and alienation that were starting to emerge during the twentieth century, it also reveals her own struggles with depression and loneliness caused by her long-term illness. She often chose texts that conveyed a strong sense of hopelessness and sadness, as seen in &quot;Demain fera un an&quot;: “Nothing more. I have nothing more, nothing to sustain me” and “I seem to feel a weeping within me, a heavy, silent sobbing, someone who is not there”.

== Works ==

=== &quot;Les sirènes&quot; ===

&quot;Les sirènes&quot; (1911) is written for solo soprano and three part choir. The topic, sirens, uses a text by Charles Grandmougin. This work was first premiered at one of her mother&#x27;s exclusive musical gatherings. Auguste Mangeot, a critic from the Paris music journal &quot;Le Monde Musicale&quot;, reported that everyone liked the piece so well it had to be repeated. Boulanger used this piece as a preparation for the Prix de Rome competition, and from it one can see her firm grounding in the classical technique taught at the Conservatoire. She uses this technique as a starting point and employs many devices popular at that time to create a personal and clear statement.

The poetry of this selection deals with the mythological siren, a creature that sings to seduce sailors to steer closer; when they do, the sirens devour the men. Boulanger depicts this scene as vividly as she possibly can. She uses a pedal tone on F combined with ascending C octaves at the beginning to portray the mesmerizing effect of the sirens. She uses this effect for twenty-eight measures, in effect, lulling listeners into a trance-like sleep.

The work is dedicated to Madame Jane Engel Bathori. Bathori, a soprano, was known for her concert organisation, and supported many new artists and composers.

=== Psalms ===

Boulanger composed three psalm settings: Psalms 24, 129 and 130.

==== Psalm 24 ====
She composed Psalm 24, entitled &quot;La terre appartient à l&#x27;Eternel&quot; (&quot;The earth is the Lord&#x27;s&quot;), in 1916 while she was resident in Rome. The work is dedicated to Monsieur Jules Griset, who was the director of Choral Guillot de Saint-Brice. Durand published the work in 1924. The work is scored for choir (consisting of soprano, alto, tenor and bass), accompanied by organ and brass ensemble (consisting of 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 4 trombones, 1 tuba), timpani and 2 harps. Boulanger&#x27;s score uses brass fanfares and homophonic choral passages: the contrast of sections contrast to the style of her 1912 Prix de Rome-winning cantata, &quot;Faust et Hélène&quot;, as heard in Yan Pascal Tortelier&#x27;s recording.

==== Psalm 129 ====
Psalm 129 was also composed in 1916 in Rome. This psalm is much longer than Psalm 24 and is composed for full orchestra. The premiere performance was held at the Salle Pleyel in 1921, conducted by Henri Busser.

==== Psalm 130 ====
&quot;Du fond de l&#x27;abîme&quot; (Psalm 130: &quot;De Profundis&quot; / &quot;Out of the depths&quot;), composed for voice and orchestra, is dedicated to the memory of her father, as noted at the top of the score. The work, completed when Boulanger was aged only twenty-two, sounds mature and conveys a developed compositional style. Boulanger&#x27;s psalms convey her Catholic faith. It has been suggested that the work was composed in reaction to World War I. The work is for a large orchestra including a sarrusophone.

=== &quot;Pie Jesu&quot; ===
Lili Boulanger finished this &quot;Pie Jesu&quot; (1918), scored for high voice, string quartet, harp and organ, towards the end of her life, but &quot;the first of Lili Boulanger&#x27;s sketches for the &quot;Pie Jesu&quot; are to be found in a composition book she used between 1909 and 1913.&quot; As noted by her sister, Nadia, she dictated the work to her. Scholars such as biographer Léonie Rosenstiel and Olivia Mattis speculate that Boulanger intended to write a complete Requiem Mass but did not live to complete it.

=== &quot;Vieille prière bouddhique&quot; ===
This work, &quot;Old Buddhist Prayer&quot;, is written for tenor and chorus (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), accompanied by a large orchestra consisting of: 2 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets (B♭), bass clarinet (B♭), 2 bassoons, sarrusophone + 4 horns (F), 3 trumpets, 4 trombones, tuba + tympani, cymbals, bass drum + celesta + 2 harps, strings. Composed during 1914–1917, it was, as many of her works, not performed until after World War I, in 1921. This work is not based within Catholicism, as her psalms were. Rather, it sets the text of a Buddhist daily prayer. James Briscoe notes that this work shows similarities to Stravinsky but also anticipates the next generation of composers.

=== &quot;D&#x27;un soir triste&quot; ===
This symphonic poem was the last work Boulanger was able to compose by her own hand, without help in writing.

=== &quot;D&#x27;un matin de printemps&quot; ===

This instrumental work is one of the last pieces Lili Boulanger completed. Different arrangements were produced including a version for violin, for flute, and for piano, another for piano trio, and another for orchestra. Although she finished both these instrumental works, her sister Nadia reportedly edited the works to add dynamics and performance directions.

===List by year===

==Legacy==

In March 1939, Nadia Boulanger with the help of American friends created the Lili Boulanger Memorial Fund. It has two objectives: to perpetuate Lili Boulanger&#x27;s music and memory and to financially support talented musicians. The Lili Boulanger Memorial Fund does not accept applications for its annual competition but a list of candidates is produced by a group of nominators selected each year by the Board of Trustees. Each nominator can then propose a candidate for the prize. The Fund then awards the Prix Lili Boulanger to one of these candidates. The University of Massachusetts Boston curates the fund. Previous winners have included Alexei Haieff (1942), Noël Lee (1953), Wojciech Kilar (1960), Robert D. Levin (1966, 1971) and Andy Akiho (2015).

In April 1965, the Friends of Lili Boulanger Association was created in Paris. This organization became the Nadia and Lili Boulanger International Centre (CNLB) in 2009.

Joy-Leilani Garbutt and Laura Colgate, two Washington, DC, musicians, started the Boulanger Initiative in 2018 to support music composed by women, in honor of Lili and Nadia Boulanger.

The asteroid 1181 Lilith was named in honour of Boulanger.

<text>Li Qingzhao (; 1084 – ca. 1155), art name Yi&#x27;an Jushi (), was a Chinese poet and essayist of the Song dynasty. She is considered one of the greatest poets in Chinese history.

== Biography ==

===Early life===

Li Qingzhao was born in 1084 in Jinan, Shandong province. She was born to a family of scholar-officials. Her father, Li Gefei, was an academic professor, a famous essayist, and a member of a poetry and literary circle led by Su Shi. Her mother was a renowned poet descended from prime minister Wang Kung-ch&#x27;en. The family had a large collection of books, and Li was able to receive comprehensive education in her childhood. Her poems showed her girlish innocence, sharp mind, and love of nature, such as &quot;Happy Memories: Dreamland&quot;. Since she was a teen, she studied hard and had an in-depth understanding of literature. As a teenager, she started to develop a career as a poet by writing two poems in &quot;shih&quot; form to rhyme with a poem by a friend.

===Marriage===

Li&#x27;s poetry was already well known within elite circles by 1101, when, aged eighteen, she married Zhao Mingcheng. They had numerous similarities and both loved poetry, literature, sculpture in bronze and stone, painting, and calligraphy. After her husband started his official career, he was often absent from home. They were not particularly wealthy but enjoyed collecting inscriptions and calligraphy. Since Li spent a quite happy time with her husband, her poetic style became calmer and more elegant. Li and her husband collected many books. They often wrote poems for each other as well as about bronze artifacts of the Shang and Zhou dynasties. Her early poetry portrays her carefree days as a woman of high society, and is marked by its elegance.

Unfortunately, their marital bliss was only temporary because of the Jin-Song wars between the Song dynasty and the Jurchens. The Northern Song capital of Kaifeng fell in 1127. Fighting took place in Shandong and their house was burned. Citizens of Zhao country, including Li and Zhao, endured countless sufferings and fled south of the Yangtze River. The couple took many of their possessions when they fled to Nanjing, where they lived for a year. Zhao died of typhoid fever in 1129 on the route to an official post, and Li never recovered. She wandered aimlessly after her husband&#x27;s death. It was then up to her to keep safe what was left of their collection. Li described her married life and the turmoil of her flight in an afterword to her husband&#x27;s posthumously published work, &quot;&quot;. 

===Later life===

Li subsequently settled in Hangzhou, where the Song government made its new capital after the war against the Jurchens. During this period, she continued writing poetry but her later work was full of nostalgic memories of her husband and her hometown. She also kept working on completing the &quot;Catalogue of Inscriptions on Metal and Stone&quot;. The book was mainly about the calligraphy on bronze and stones; it also mentions the documents Li and Zhao collected and viewed. According to some contemporary accounts, she was briefly married to a man named who treated her badly, and she divorced him within months. She survived the criticism of this marriage. It is widely believed that she died around the age of 71, but no records of this remain.

Unfortunately, many of her poems disappeared in the following turbulent years, which became an irreparable loss to Chinese literature. Only around a hundred of her poems are known to survive, mostly in the &quot;ci&quot; form and tracing her varying fortunes in life. A few poems in the &quot;shi&quot; form also survived, as did the afterword to &quot;Catalogue of Inscriptions on Metal and Stone&quot; and a study of &quot;ci&quot; poetry. 

== Poems ==
Li&#x27;s life was full of twists and turns and her poems can be split into two main parts - the dividing line being when she moved to the south. During the early period, most of her poems were related to her feelings as a maiden. They were more like love poems. After her move to the south, they were closely linked with her hatred of the war against the Jurchens and her patriotism. She is credited with the first detailed critique of the metrics of Chinese poetry. She was regarded as a master of the &quot;subtle and concise style&quot; :zh:婉約派.

One of Li&#x27;s famous &quot;ci&quot; poems is &quot;A Dream Song&quot; (), written when she was living in Jinan and recalling the events of her hometown before her marriage. Therefore, she wrote it between the ages of 16 and 17 (the second year of Yuan Fu of Song Zhezong, 1099). This is also known as her first poem. Translator Jiaosheng Wang translates as:

== Memorial Hall in China ==
===Shandong Zhangqiu Memorial Hall===

&quot;Qingzhao Garden&quot; is located at the bank of Baimai Spring in Mingshui, covering 18,000 square meters, including 1,270 square meters of buildings, 1,500 square meters of water, and 10,000 square meters of green space. It was officially opened on May 1, 1997, and is the most significant memorial to Li.

===Shandong Qingzhou Memorial Hall===

Qingzhou Li Qingzhao Memorial Hall is located at the Yangxi Lake outside the west gate of Qingzhou Ancient City. It covers an area of about 630 square meters. The building faces south; there are tunnels in the entrance to the north, road east built, shun river building, west of the four pine pavilion, are of Qing dynasty architecture. At the end of the corridor is a quadrillion built in 1993; on the door, there is a well-known poet Xiao Lao writing tablet &quot;Li Qingzhao Memorial Hall&quot;.

===Shandong Jinan Memorial Hall===

Jinan Li Qingzhao Memorial Hall is located in Baotu Spring Park, in a courtyard on the north side of Liuxu Spring, with 360 square meters. In the Northern Song dynasty, this courtyard was the courtyard of the Zhang family in Jinan. In the Jin dynasty, it was changed to Linquan Running. In the late Qing dynasty, it was changed to the ancestral temple of Ding Baozhen. In the early Qing dynasty, the poet Tian Wen wrote a poem titled &quot;Visiting Li Yian Old House at Liuxu Spring.&quot; People mistakenly thought that Li&#x27;s former residence was near Liuxu Spring. Later, literati and poets all joined the club. Thus it was said that Li&#x27;s old house was in Jinan. Moreover, Li was once respected as the lotus root god and was enshrined in the Lotus Shrine beside Daming Lake in Jinan. Since the Qing dynasty, Jinan people have been awarded Li &quot;Lotus Godness&quot; for sacrificing.

===Zhejiang Jinhua Memorial Hall===
Jinhua Li Qingzhao Memorial Hall is located in the southern corner of Jinhua City, Bayong Road. Ba Yong Lou was built by Shen Yue, governor of Dongyang, in the first year of Qilongchang in the Southern dynasty. In 1994, Ba Yong Lou Cultural Relics Conservation and Management Office changed the main hall of Ba Yong Lou into Li Qingzhao Memorial Hall.

===Zhejiang Hangzhou Memorial Hall===

Since Li Qingzhao once lived near Qingbo Gate of West Lake in Hangzhou, the relevant authorities built the Qingzhao Pavilion in the Stream of the Metasequoia forest in the Willow Waves And Orioles Park, which was opened in 2002.

==Modern references==
Two impact craters, Li Ch&#x27;ing-Chao on Mercury and Li Qingzhao on Venus, are named after her.

&quot;A Dream Song&quot; and &quot;Sheng Sheng Man&quot; have been set to music as part of the song cycle &#x27;Chinese Memories&#x27; by composer Johan Famaey in 2011.

In 2017, the composer Karol Beffa wrote &quot;Fragments of China&quot; (Klarthe), setting four of her poems to music. &quot;River of Stars&quot;, a novel by Guy Gavriel Kay set in a fictionalized Song China, features a protagonist inspired by Li Qingzhao, as acknowledged by the author in the book.

In the 2022 video game Terra Invicta, the leader of the Academy faction is named in honor of Li Qingzhao.

<doc id="501485" wikidata="Q164775" url="?curid=501485" title="Georg Baselitz">
<text>Georg Baselitz (born 23 January 1938) is a German painter, sculptor and graphic artist. In the 1960s he became well known for his figurative, expressive paintings. In 1969 he began painting his subjects upside down in an effort to overcome the representational, content-driven character of his earlier work and stress the artifice of painting. Drawing from myriad influences, including art of Soviet era illustration art, the Mannerist period and African sculptures, he developed his own, distinct artistic language.

He was born as Hans-Georg Kern in , Upper Lusatia, Germany. He grew up amongst the suffering and demolition of World War II, and the concept of destruction plays a significant role in his life and work. These biographical circumstances are recurring aspects of his entire oeuvre. In this context, the artist stated in an interview: &quot;I was born into a destroyed order, a destroyed landscape, a destroyed people, a destroyed society. And I didn&#x27;t want to reestablish an order: I had seen enough of so-called order. I was forced to question everything, to be &#x27;naive&#x27;, to start again.&quot; By disrupting any given orders and breaking the common conventions of perception, Baselitz has formed his personal circumstances into his guiding artistic principles. To this day, he still inverts all his paintings, which has become the unique and most defining feature of his work.

==Life==
Baselitz was born on 23 January 1938, in Deutschbaselitz (now a part of Kamenz, Saxony), in what was later East Germany. His father was an elementary school teacher, and the family lived in the local school building.

Baselitz attended the local school in Kamenz. In its assembly hall hung a reproduction of the painting &quot;Wermsdorfer Wald&quot; (1859) by Louis-Ferdinand von Rayski, an artist whose grasp of Realism was a formative influence on Baselitz. Baselitz also became interested in the writings of Jakob Böhme. By the age of 15, he had already painted portraits, religious subjects, still lifes, and landscapes, some in a futuristic style.

In 1955, he applied to study at the Kunstakademie in Dresden but was rejected. In 1956, he successfully enrolled at the Hochschule für Bildende und Angewandte Kunst in East Berlin. There he studied under professors Walter Womacka and Herbert Behrens-Hangler and befriended Peter Graf and Ralf Winkler (later known as A. R. Penck). After two semesters, however, he was expelled for &quot;sociopolitical immaturity&quot; because he did not comply with the socialist ideas of the DDR.

In 1957, he resumed his studies at the Hochschule der Künste in West Berlin, where he settled down and met his future wife, Johanna Elke Kretzschmar. In 1961, he attended Hann Trier&#x27;s master class and completed his studies the following year. Trier&#x27;s classes were described as a creative environment largely dominated by the gestural abstraction of Tachism and Art Informel. At the Hochschule der Künste, Baselitz immersed himself in the theories of Ernst Wilhelm Nay, Wassily Kandinsky, and Kasimir Malevich. During this time he became friends with Eugen Schönebeck and Benjamin Katz. Art historian Andreas Franzke describes Baselitz&#x27;s primary artistic influences at this time as Jackson Pollock and Philip Guston.

In 1961, he adopted the name Georg Baselitz as a tribute to his home town.

Since 2013, he and his wife have lived in Salzburg in Austria and both obtained also Austrian citizenship in 2015. He married Kretzschmar in 1962 and is the father of two sons, Daniel Blau and Anton Kern, both gallerists.

==Work==
===1957–1969===

At the turn of 1959 to 1960, Baselitz began to produce his first original works in a distinct style of his own, among them the &quot;Rayski-Head&quot; (&quot;Rayski-Kopf&quot;) series and the painting &quot;G. Head&quot; (&quot;G. Kopf&quot;).

In 1963, Baselitz&#x27;s first solo exhibition in West Berlin, at &quot;Galerie Werner &amp; Katz,&quot; caused a public scandal. Two of the pictures, &quot;The Big Night Down The Drain&quot; (&quot;Die große Nacht im Eimer&quot;) (1962/63) and &quot;The Naked Man&quot; (&quot;Der Nackte Mann&quot;) (1962), were seized two days after the opening of the show by the public prosecutor on the ground of their lewd and obscene content, after likely a friend of the Galerist Michael Werner had already reported their being seized via German News Agency in the local newspaper B.Z. – a self-fulfilling prophecy and intentional scandal. The ensuing court case did not end until October 1965.

Baselitz spent the spring of 1964 at Schloß Wolfsburg and produced his first etchings in the printing shop there, which were exhibited later that year. Printmaking, a medium which he describes as having &quot;symbolic power which has nothing to do with a painting&quot;, has since become an intrinsic part of his artistic repertoire. The next year, he won a six-month scholarship to study at the Villa Romana in Florence. While there, he studied Mannerist graphics and produced the &quot;Animal Piece&quot; (&quot;Tierstück&quot;) pictures. In general, Baselitz&#x27; greatest inspiration stems from writers and artists such as Antonin Artaud, Samuel Beckett, Edvard Munch, Jean Dubuffet, Willem de Kooning, Joseph Beuys, as well as from the expressionist artist association &quot;Die Brücke&quot;.

==== Series of &quot;Heroes&quot; and &quot;Fractures&quot; ====
After returning from Florence to West Berlin, Baselitz created the series of &quot;Heroes&quot; (&quot;Helden&quot;, also known as &quot;Neue Typen&quot;), between 1965 and 1966, which, among others, includes the large-format composition &quot;The Great Friends&quot; (&quot;Die großen Freunde,&quot; Museum Ludwig, Cologne). These figures represent a metaphorical image of a man who, having neither nationality nor an affiliation to a place, throws the illusory and megalomaniacal ideals of the Third Reich and East Germany overboard with his desolate, broken, ragged appearance (for example, &quot;Rebel&quot;, held by the Tate Modern). Baselitz&#x27; &quot;Helden&quot; typically appear alone in a barren landscape with naked arms and legs, and hands opened in a summoning gestures. At times they bear attributes associated with the biography of the artist, who refers to his own childhood in the countryside and identifies himself with all of them. Through early 1969, he produced further large-format pictures, such as &quot;Woodsmen&quot; (&quot;Waldarbeiter&quot;) as part of a group of pictures known as &quot;Fracture Pictures&quot; (&quot;Frakturbilder&quot;).

====Inverted paintings====
On the basis of his &quot;Fractures&quot;, Baselitz used a painting by Louis-Ferdinand von Rayski, &quot;Wermsdorf Woods (Wermsdorfer Wald&quot;), ca 1959, from his childhood at his elementary-school as a model, in order to paint his first picture with an inverted motif: &quot;The Wood on Its Head (Der Wald auf dem Kopf&quot;) (1969). By inverting his paintings, the artist is able to emphasize the organisation of colours and form and confront the viewer with the picture&#x27;s surface rather than the personal content of the image. In this sense, the paintings are empty and not subject to interpretation. Instead, one can only look at them.

===1970–1975===

In the 1970s, Baselitz regularly exhibited at Munich&#x27;s Galerie Heiner Friedrich. Most of the works he produced during this time were landscapes themed as pictures-within-a-picture. In 1970, at the Kunstmuseum Basel, Dieter Koepplin staged the first retrospective of drawings and graphic works by Baselitz. At the Galeriehaus in Cologne&#x27;s Lindenstraße, Franz Dahlem put on the first exhibition of pictures with upside-down motifs. In 1971, the Baselitz family once again moved, relocating to Forst an der Weinstraße. He used the old village school as studio and started painting pictures featuring bird motifs. He exhibited several times in the next few years around Germany and also participated in the 1972 documenta 5 in Kassel, where again his work would generate harsh criticism. This same year he began using a fingerpainting technique. He painted landscapes until 1975, often based on motifs he would find in publications such as the ″Mitteilungen des Landesvereins Sächsischer Heimatschutz e. V.″. In 1975, the family moved to Derneburg, near Hildesheim. Baselitz visited New York for the first time and worked there for two weeks. He also visited Brazil, participating in the 13th Biennale in São Paulo.

===1976–1980===
In 1976, Baselitz rented a studio in Florence, which he used until 1981. In 1977, he began working on large-format linocuts. He began teaching at the Staatliche Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Karlsruhe, where he was appointed professor in 1978. From 1978 until 1980, he worked on diptychs using the tempera painting technique (combinations of motifs), multipart pictures (series of motifs), and large-format individual works such as &quot;The Gleaner&quot; (&quot;Die Ährenleserin&quot;), &quot;Rubble Woman&quot; (&quot;Trümmerfrau&quot;), &quot;Eagle&quot; (&quot;Adler&quot;) and Boy Reading (&quot;Der lesende Knabe&quot;). The works became more abstract, with scriptural elements predominating. In 1980, he showed his first sculpture at the Venice Biennale.

===1981–1989===
In 1981, Georg Baselitz set up an additional study in Castiglion Florentino, near Arezzo, which he used until 1987. His work was exhibited in New York for the first time in 1981. By 1982, he began devoting more time to sculpture, in addition to several exhibitions. In 1983, he began using Christian motifs in much of his artwork, and completed the major composition &quot;Dinner in Dresden&quot; (&quot;Nachtessen in Dresden&quot;). In the same year, he took up a new professorship at the Hochschule der Künste Berlin. In 1986, in recognition of Baselitz&#x27;s achievements, he was awarded the Goslarer Kaiserring by the city of Goslar. Through the 1980s, Baselitz&#x27;s work was exhibited frEquently in Germany. In 1989, the title Chevalier dans l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres was conferred upon Baselitz by French Minister of Arts Jack Lang.

===1990–2009===
In 1990, at the Nationalgalerie im Alten Museum in Berlin, the first major exhibition of Baselitz&#x27;s works in East Germany was staged. In 1992, he resigned from the Akademie der Künste in Berlin. In 1993, he designed the set for Harrison Birtwistle&#x27;s opera &quot;Punch and Judy&quot;, staged under the direction of Pierre Audi at the Dutch Opera in Amsterdam. He also took part in the International Pavilion at the Venice Biennale with the &quot;Male Torso&quot; (&quot;Männlicher Torso&quot;) sculpture, accompanied by oversized drawings. In 1994, Baselitz designed a stamp for the French postal service. He also produced his first ground gold picture that year. In 1995, the first major retrospective of Baselitz&#x27;s work in the US was staged at the Guggenheim in New York City. This retrospective was also exhibited in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. Throughout the 1990s, his work was exhibited frequently throughout Europe. In 2002, a retrospective of Baselitz&#x27;s work was shown in Art Gallery of Yapı Kredi Bank in Istanbul.

During this time, Baselitz lived and worked near Hildesheim (Schloß Derneburg), from 2006 on near Munich, and in Imperia in Italy.

His work was exhibited in London, at the Royal Academy of Arts in late 2007, and in the White Cube gallery in 2009.

===2010–2013===
From 21 November 2009, to 14 March 2010, the Museum Frieder Burda and Baden-Baden&#x27;s Staatliche Kunsthalle exhibited a comprehensive survey of the artist, featuring approximately 140 works. &quot;Baselitz. A Retrospective&quot; was presented at the two neighbouring museums, with the Museum Frieder Burda displaying &quot;50 years of painting&quot;, the Staatliche Kunsthalle &quot;30 years of sculpture&quot;.

In a 2013 interview, Baselitz was quoted as saying, &quot;women don&#x27;t paint very well. It&#x27;s a fact. There are, of course, exceptions.&quot; Citing the comparative lack of commercial success of work by women painters in the most expensive markets as proof, he stated, &quot;Women simply don&#x27;t pass the test. (...) The market test, the value test&quot;.

Baselitz&#x27;s statements elicited rebuttals from art critics like Sarah Thornton, author of &quot;Seven Days in the Art World&quot;, who countered, &quot;[t]he market gets it wrong all the time. To see the market as a mark of quality is going down a delusional path. I&#x27;m shocked Baselitz does. His work doesn&#x27;t go for so much.&quot; The record then for a painting by Baselitz was £3.2 million, while the record for a painting by Yayoi Kusama, a female artist, was £3.8 million.

===Since 2014===
To this day, Baselitz is still an active, yet controversial artist and highly critical of German politics. Over the past years, Baselitz has been working on a series of quiet portraits of both him and his wife, Elke, painted with dark washes of blue and black, somber tones that point to a mediation on mortality and aging.

Due to his 80th birthday on 23 January 2018, several retrospectives were held in his honor; for instance at Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich, Fondation Beyeler and Kunstmuseum in Basel, as well as in the U.S. at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C. With over 100 works highlighting six decades, the Hirshhorn&#x27;s exhibition was the first major U.S. retrospective of Baselitz in more than twenty years.

&quot;Devotion&quot;, an exhibition of paintings and works on paper by Baselitz inspired by self-portraits of artists he admires or is influenced by, was exhibited at Gagosian Gallery in New York in early 2019. The same year, Alan Cristea Gallery also published a series of 32 etchings by the artist of the same title.

In 2019 a retrospective curated by Kosme de Barañano was held at the Gallerie dell&#x27;Accademia in Venice, Italy, to coincide with the 58th Venice Biennale, the first exhibition by a living artist in the museum gallery. He also curated a special exhibition celebrating the life and work of his friend and fellow artist, Emilio Vedova, at the Fondazione Emilio e Annabianca Vedova, entitled &quot;Vedova di/by Baselitz&quot;.
In October 2021 a major retrospective opened at the Centre Pompidou including paintings, sculptures, drawings and prints, as well display cases with archival and documentary material. The exhibition was the last one curated by Bernard Blistène as director of the museum.

==Style==
In the 1970s, Baselitz became famous for his upside-down images. He is seen as a revolutionary painter as he draws the viewer&#x27;s attention to his works by making them think and sparking their interest. The subjects of the paintings do not seem to be as significant as the work&#x27;s visual insight. Throughout his career, Baselitz has varied his style, ranging from layering substances to his style, since the 1990s, which focuses more on lucidity and smooth changes. His drawings and paintings of the past ten years show the artist revisiting, correcting, and varying his earlier work. Self-reflection goes hand in hand with an insouciant and surprisingly unfettered graphic style.

==Controversy==
Baselitz&#x27;s disparaging remarks about women artists have earned him a reputation as a sexist, and he has been accused of reinforcing gender bias in the art world.

==Art market==
Baselitz highest selling painting was &quot;Mit Roter Fahne&quot; (&quot;With Red Flag&quot;) (1965), who sold by £7,471,250 ($9,099,982), at Sotheby&#x27;s London, on 8 March 2017.

The highest selling sculpture by the artist was &quot;Dresdner Frauen – Besuch aus Prag&quot; (&quot;Women of Dresden – Visit from Prague&quot;) (1990), a work of tempera on ash wood, who sold by $11,240,000, at Sotheby&#x27;s New York, on 19 May 2022.

<text>Rideau Street () is a major street in downtown Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and one of Ottawa&#x27;s oldest and most famous streets running from Wellington Street in the west to Montreal Road in the east where it connects to the Vanier district. Rideau Street is home to the Château Laurier, the CF Rideau Centre and the Government Conference Centre (Ottawa&#x27;s former central train station). Along with Wellington Street and Sussex Drive it was among the first streets in Ottawa to be host to businesses; it was created with the founding of the earlier settlement Bytown. The Plaza Bridge by the Rideau Canal is at its westernmost point and the Cummings Bridge is at its easternmost point.

For many years, Rideau Street was one of Ottawa&#x27;s primary retail thoroughfares, containing department stores such as Freimans, Ogilvy&#x27;s, Woolworth, Caplan&#x27;s and Metropolitan.

In November 1979, then mayor Marion Dewar examined a plan to create what became the &#x27;Rideau Street Bus Mall.&#x27; Sidewalks from Sussex to Dalhousie were enclosed in a continuous glass-and-steel structure. The heated mall was expected to allow pedestrians to shop in comfort year-round. However, the structure had an unanticipated downside, in that it attracted large numbers of homeless and late-night drinkers. Many establishments along the affected stretch of Rideau Street failed as a result. The decision was made to tear the shelters down, and in the end the cost for dismantling them was almost as much as the $6.5 million incurred in their construction. Although the local department stores are gone, Rideau Street still features the Bay department store, the Rideau Centre shopping mall, and the street is adjacent to shops of the Byward Market. The street had been designated Highway 17B before the Ontario government discontinued it in 1998.

To the north of Rideau, east of King Edward Avenue is the traditional Lower Town district of Ottawa, a residential area which in the past was predominantly Francophone, but now has one of Ottawa&#x27;s largest immigrant populations, notably including many Francophone Africans and Somalis. North of Rideau and west of King Edward is the commercial ByWard Market area.

To the south of Rideau Street is the Sandy Hill neighbourhood, with its mix of embassies, older houses, low- and high-rise apartment buildings, and student housing.

The portion of the street between Nicholas Street and King Edward Avenue is designated as part of Canada&#x27;s National Highway System, as part of an interconnecting route between Highway 417 and Quebec Autoroute 5 in Gatineau.

== 2016 sinkholes ==
A section of Rideau Street was closed to all traffic from June 8 to July 2, 2016, after it collapsed in the vicinity of excavations being made for the Rideau station of the Confederation Line. Later that year, on October 2, a much smaller sinkhole opened in the same area as the June 8 sinkhole. Due to the sinkholes, Rideau Street was closed to regular traffic from Sussex to Dalhousie until further notice. Only buses, taxis, construction vehicles, and delivery vehicles were permitted.

The street did not fully reopen to regular traffic until the middle of December 2020.

<text>This is a list of notable events in the history of LGBT rights that took place in the year 1995.

==Events==
* A new penal code is introduced in Portugal, which lowers the age of consent for heterosexual acts to 14; however it retains an age of consent of 16 for homosexual acts.
* Sweden legalizes registered partnerships, with all of the rights of marriage—except for marriage in a church and adoption.
* US state of Rhode Island bans sexual orientation discrimination in the private sector.

===January===
* 1 – Sweden begins registering same-sex domestic partners. Same-sex couples receive most of the rights of mixed-sex marriages but do not receive the right to a church wedding, the right to adopt children or the right to artificial insemination.
* 19 – The District of Columbia Court of Appeals rules in &quot;Dean v. District of Columbia&quot; that the district&#x27;s human rights ordinance barring discrimination based on sexual orientation does not guarantee a right to same-sex marriage.

===February===
* 2 – A judge in Tennessee rules that the state&#x27;s sodomy law violates the state constitution.
* 17 – The Canadian province of British Columbia announces new regulations allowing gay and lesbian people to adopt children.

===March===
* 9 – Scott Amedure, a gay man, is shot to death by Jonathan Schmitz, a heterosexual man, after Amedure revealed a secret crush on Schmitz during an episode of &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot; titled &quot;Revealing Same Sex Secret Crush&quot;. Schmitz is later convicted of second-degree murder with a sentence of 30 to 50 years.
* 30 – In &quot;Abel v. United States of America&quot;, the first challenge to &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot;, district judge Eugene Nickerson rules that the provision of the 1993 law barring LGBT military personnel from saying they are LGBT infringes on their First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights.

===May===
* 17 – Hillsborough County, Florida commissioners repeal the county&#x27;s gay rights law.
* 25 – In &quot;Egan v. Canada&quot; the Supreme Court of Canada rules that sexual orientation is a prohibited ground of discrimination under section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a part of the constitution. Section 15 does not explicitly list sexual orientation, but is designed to permit the addition of new grounds by the courts. The ruling will have a wide impact since section 15 applies to all laws, including human rights laws that prohibit discrimination by all employers, landlords, service providers and governments.

===June===
* 13 – The Broward County Commission passes a gay rights bill covering employment, housing and public accommodation.
* 19 – In &quot;Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston&quot; the United States Supreme Court rules that private citizens organizing a public demonstration may legally exclude groups who impart a message that the private citizen does not wish to promote. The ruling allows the organizers of the city&#x27;s annual St. Patrick&#x27;s Day parade to exclude LGBT contingents.
* 24 – Inauguration of the Memorial to gay and lesbian victims of National Socialism in Cologne, Germany

===August===
* 2 – U.S. President Bill Clinton signs Executive Order 12968, which bans discrimination based on &quot;sexual orientation&quot; as it establishes uniform policies for allowing government employees access to classified information.

===October===
* 10 – The United States Supreme Court hears oral arguments in &quot;Romer v. Evans&quot;, the case that would eventually overturn Colorado&#x27;s Amendment 2, which banned gay rights laws in the state.

===December===
* 30 – San Francisco outlaws discrimination based on gender identity.

==Deaths==
*March 9 – Scott Amedure, 32, talk show murder victim
*November 17 – James Woods III, 32, author of &quot;The Corporate Closet: The Professional Lives of Gay Men in America&quot;
*November 20 – Steven Powsner, 40, former president of the New York City Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center

<doc id="501493" wikidata="Q747737" url="?curid=501493" title="Nephilim">
<text>The Nephilim (; &quot;Nəfīlīm&quot;) are mysterious beings or humans in the Bible traditionally imagined as being of great size and strength, or alternatively beings of great power and authority. The origins of the Nephilim are disputed. Some, including the author of the Book of Enoch, view them as the offspring of rebellious angels and humans. Others view them as descendants of Seth and Cain.

This reference to them is in Genesis 6:1–4, but the passage is ambiguous and the identity of the Nephilim is disputed. According to Numbers 13:33, ten of the Twelve Spies report the existence of Nephilim in Canaan prior to its conquest by the Israelites.

A similar or identical Biblical Hebrew term, read as &quot;Nephilim&quot; by some scholars, or as the word &quot;fallen&quot; by others, appears in Ezekiel 32:27 and is also mentioned in the deuterocanonical books Judith 16:6, Sirach 16:7, Baruch 3:26–28, and Wisdom 14:6.

==Etymology==
The Brown-Driver-Briggs Lexicon (1908) gives the meaning of Nephilim as &quot;giants&quot;, and warns that proposed etymologies of the word are &quot;all very precarious&quot;. Many suggested interpretations are based on the assumption that the word is a derivative of Hebrew verbal root () &quot;fall&quot;. argued the word comes from the hif&#x27;il causative stem, possibly indicating that the name &#x27;Nephilim&#x27; is to be understood as &#x27;those that cause others to fall down&#x27;. Ronald Hendel states that it is a passive form: &#x27;Ones who have fallen&#x27;, grammatically analogous to &#x27;one who is appointed&#x27; (i.e., a deputy or overseer), &#x27;one who is bound&#x27; (i.e., a prisoner), &quot;etc&quot;. It is also argued that the &quot;fallen&quot; refer to those who &quot;fell in battle&quot;, similar to the &quot;gibborim&quot;. 

The majority of ancient biblical translations – including the Septuagint, Theodotion, Latin Vulgate, Samaritan Targum, Targum Onkelos, and Targum Neofiti – interpret the word to mean &quot;giants&quot;. Symmachus translates it as &quot;the violent ones&quot; and Aquila&#x27;s translation has been interpreted to mean either &quot;the fallen ones&quot; or &quot;the ones falling [upon their enemies].&quot;

== Origins of belief ==
Archaeologist G.E. Wright states that belief in the Nephilim, especially as giants, originated from the Hebrews’ contemplation of Transjordian megalithic structures and cyclopean masonry walls of Canaanite cities, with some being 18 feet thick. Nonetheless, he notes that ancient Canaanites were relatively short, before and after 3000 BC, with no significant findings of abnormally sized aborigines. Biblical professor Brian R. Doak believes that Nephilim lore is a polemic against the tropes of epic and heroism, commonly found in the worldviews of cultures similar to the Hebrews&#x27;. J.C. Greenfield similarly believes that Nephilim lore is based on &quot;the negative aspects of the Apkallu tradition&quot; in Sumerian mythology. The Apkallu were seven antediluvian culture heroes who were praised for their exceptional wisdom. In fact, some were called &quot;the son of Ea&quot;.

Brand &quot;et al&quot;. (2023) argue that the Nephilim refer to elite or royal warriors from legendary antiquity, who do not necessarily have abnormal stature or divine parentage. They view the Nephilim in Numbers 13-14 as autochthonous elite warriors who dwelt in pre-Israelite Canaan. Ellen White believes that their purpose, narratively speaking, is to die so that God&#x27;s chosen, who are the &quot;underdogs&quot;, could prevail. 

The Anakites, who are associated with the Nephilim, are mentioned in the Egyptian Execration texts of the Middle Kingdom (2055–1650 BC) as one of Egypt&#x27;s political enemies in Canaan.

==In the Hebrew Bible==
In the Hebrew Bible, there are three interconnected passages referencing the &quot;nephilim.&quot; Two of them come from the Pentateuch. The first occurrence is in Genesis 6:1–4, immediately before the account of Noah&#x27;s Ark. Genesis 6:4 reads as follows:

Where the Jewish Publication Society&#x27;s translation simply transliterates the Hebrew &quot;nephilim&quot; as &quot;Nephilim&quot;, the King James Version translates the term as &quot;giants&quot;.

The nature of the Nephilim is complicated by the ambiguity of Genesis 6:4, which leaves it unclear whether they are the &quot;sons of God&quot; or their offspring who are the &quot;mighty men of old, men of renown&quot;. Richard Hess takes it to mean that the Nephilim are the offspring, as does P.W. Coxon.

The second is Numbers 13:32–33, where ten of the Twelve Spies describe the Anakites (a Rephaite tribe) as descendants of the Nephilim:

Outside the Pentateuch there is one more passage indirectly referencing &quot;nephilim&quot; and this is Ezekiel 32:17–32. Of special significance is Ezekiel 32:27, which contains a phrase of disputed meaning. With the traditional vowels added to the text in the medieval period, the phrase is read &quot;gibborim nophlim&quot; (&quot;&#x27;fallen warriors&quot; or &quot;fallen Gibborim&quot;), although some scholars read the phrase as &quot;gibborim nephilim&quot; (&quot;Nephilim warriors&quot; or &quot;warriors, Nephilim&quot;). According to R.S. Hendel, the phrase should be interpreted as &quot;warriors, the Nephilim&quot; in a reference to Genesis 6:4. The verse as understood by Hendel reads:
B.R. Doak, on the other hand, proposes to read the term as the Hebrew verb &quot;fallen&quot; (נופלים &quot;nophlim&quot;), not a use of the specific term &quot;Nephilim&quot;, but still according to Doak a clear reference to the Nephilim tradition as found in Genesis.

==Interpretations==

=== Giants ===

The earliest translations of the Hebrew Bible, the Septuagint, composed in the 3rd or 2nd century BC, renders the said word as &quot;gigantes&quot;. In Greek Mythology the gigantes were beings of great strength and aggression but not necessarily of great size. The choice made by the Greek translators has been preserved in Latin translation. The Vulgate, compiled in the 4th or 5th century AD, transcribes the Greek term rather than translating the Hebrew &quot;nefilim&quot;. From there, the tradition of the giant progeny of the sons of God and the daughters of men spread to later medieval translations of the Bible.

The decision of the Greek translators to render the Hebrew &quot;nefilim&quot; as Greek &quot;gigantes&quot; is a separate matter. The Hebrew &quot;nefilim&quot; means literally &quot;the fallen ones&quot; and the strict translation into Greek would be &quot;peptokotes&quot;, which in fact appears in the Septuagint of Ezekiel 32:22–27. It seems then that the authors of Septuagint wished not only to simply translate the foreign term into Greek, but also to employ a term which would be intelligible and meaningful for their Hellenistic audiences. Given the complex meaning of the &quot;nefilim&quot; which emerged from the three interconnected biblical passages (human–divine hybrids in Genesis 6, autochthonous people in Numbers 13 and ancient warriors damned in the underworld in Ezekiel 32), the Greek translators recognized some similarities. First and foremost, both &quot;nefilim&quot; and &quot;gigantes&quot; possessed an ambiguous identity, being a mixture of the human and divine. They were also viewed with fascination and moral contempt. Secondly, both were presented as impersonating chaotic qualities and posing some serious danger to gods and humans. Lastly, both &quot;gigantes&quot; and &quot;nefilim&quot; were clearly connected with the underworld and were said to have originated from earth, and they both end up closed therein.

In 1 Enoch, they were &quot;great giants, whose height was three hundred cubits&quot;. Because 1 cubit is , this would make them tall. However, this &quot;three hundred cubits&quot; is considered to be a translation error in Ethiopian version, by scholars, and the earlier Greek version is considered to be closer to the original than Ethiopian one: &quot;The giants gave birth to Nephilim, and from Nephilim, &#x27;Elioud&#x27; came out, and they were growing up according to their grandeur.&quot; This, indeed, matches other text like Book of Jubilees 7:21-22 which states the three races of giants: Naphidim, Naphil, and Eljo. The correct translation of the verse about the giants&#x27; height in 1 Enoch is rather about three races of giants including Elioud. Knowing this, John Baty, who published the Ethiopian version of Enoch in 1839, translated it exactly as the Greek text. 

The Quran refers to the people of Ād in Quran 26:130 whom the prophet Hud declares to be like &quot;jabbarin&quot; (Hebrew: &quot;gibborim&quot;), probably a reference to the Biblical Nephilim. The people of Ād are said to be giants, the tallest among them high. However, according to Islamic legend, the ʿĀd were not wiped out by the Flood, since some of them had been too tall to be drowned. Instead, God destroyed them after they rejected further warnings. After death, they were banished into the lower layers of hell.

===Fallen angels===
From the third century BC onwards, references are found in the Enochic literature, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Jubilees, the Testament of Reuben, , Josephus, and the Book of Jude (compare with ). For example:
: [2]&quot;And when the angels, [3]the sons of heaven, beheld them, they became enamoured of them, saying to each other, Come, let us select for ourselves wives from the progeny of men, and let us beget children.&quot;
Some Christian apologists, such as Tertullian and especially Lactantius, shared this opinion.

The earliest statement in a secondary commentary explicitly interpreting this to mean that angelic beings mated with humans can be traced to the rabbinical &quot;Targum Pseudo-Jonathan&quot; and it has since become especially commonplace in modern Christian commentaries. This line of interpretation finds additional support in the text of Genesis 6:4, which juxtaposes the sons of God (male gender, divine nature) with the daughters of men (female gender, human nature). From this parallelism it could be inferred that the sons of God are understood as some superhuman beings.

The &quot;New American Bible&quot; commentary draws a parallel to the Epistle of Jude and the statements set forth in Genesis, suggesting that the Epistle refers implicitly to the paternity of Nephilim as heavenly beings who came to earth and had sexual intercourse with women. The footnotes of the Jerusalem Bible suggest that the biblical author intended the Nephilim to be an &quot;anecdote of a superhuman race&quot;. Superhuman, in this context, refers to the extremity of their wickedness.

Some Christian commentators have argued against this view, citing Jesus&#x27;s statement that angels do not marry. Others disagree since Jesus also compared angels to men, thus implying the former&#x27;s ability to have sex. Angels are also never explicitly described as being incapable of marriage. The absence of marriage among angels can be thus compared to wilful celibacy.

Evidence cited in favor of the fallen angels interpretation includes the fact that the phrase &quot;the sons of God&quot; (Hebrew: ; or &quot;sons of the gods&quot;) is used twice outside of Genesis 6, in the Book of Job (1:6 and 2:1) where the phrase explicitly references angels. The Septuagint manuscript Codex Alexandrinus reading of Genesis 6:2 renders this phrase as &quot;the angels of God&quot; while Codex Vaticanus reads &quot;sons&quot;.

Another modern view that aligns with the fallen angel interpretation includes Nephilim being the offspring of demon-possessed men and women. 

====Second Temple Judaism====
The story of the Nephilim is further elaborated in the Book of Enoch. The Greek, Aramaic, and main Ge&#x27;ez manuscripts of 1 Enoch and Jubilees obtained in the 19th century and held in the British Museum and Vatican Library, connect the origin of the Nephilim with the fallen angels, and in particular with the (&quot;watchers&quot;). Samyaza, an angel of high rank, is described as leading a rebel sect of angels in a descent to earth to have sexual intercourse with human females:
In this tradition, the children of the Nephilim are called the Elioud, who are considered a separate race from the Nephilim, but they share the fate of the Nephilim.

Some believe the fallen angels who begat the Nephilim were cast into Tartarus ( Jude 1:6) (Greek Enoch 20:2), a place of &quot;total darkness&quot;. An interpretation is that God granted ten percent of the disembodied spirits of the Nephilim to remain after the Flood, as demons, to try to lead the human race astray until the final Judgment. Another similar view was proposed by Dr. Michael Heiser, an Old Testament scholar from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In his book &quot;The Unseen Realm&quot; he states that the disembodied spirits of the Nephilim became what has been known as demons or unclean spirits.

In addition to &quot;Enoch&quot;, the &quot;Book of Jubilees&quot; (7:21–25) also states that ridding the Earth of these Nephilim was one of God&#x27;s purposes for flooding the Earth in Noah&#x27;s time. These works describe the Nephilim as being evil giants.

The New Testament Epistle of Jude (14–15) cites from which many scholars believe is based on Deuteronomy 33:2. To most commentators this confirms that the author of Jude regarded the Enochic interpretations of Genesis 6 as correct; however, others have questioned this.

===Descendants of Seth and Cain===
References to the offspring of Seth rebelling from God and mingling with the daughters of Cain are found from the second century AD onwards in both Christian and Jewish sources (e.g., Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, Augustine of Hippo, Sextus Julius Africanus, and the Letters attributed to St. Clement). It is also the view expressed in the modern canonical Amharic Ethiopian Orthodox Bible: Henok 2:1–3
: &quot;and the Offspring of Seth, who were upon the Holy Mount, saw them and loved them. And they told one another, &#x27;Come, let us choose for us daughters from Cain&#x27;s children; let us bear children for us.

Orthodox Judaism has taken a stance against the idea that Genesis 6 refers to angels or that angels could intermarry with men. Shimon bar Yochai pronounced a curse on anyone teaching this idea. Rashi and Nachmanides followed this. Pseudo-Philo (&quot;Biblical Antiquities&quot; 3:1–3) may also imply that the &quot;sons of God&quot; were human. Consequently, most Jewish commentaries and translations describe the Nephilim as being from the offspring of &quot;sons of nobles&quot;, rather than from &quot;sons of God&quot; or &quot;sons of angels&quot;. This is also the rendering suggested in the Targum Onqelos, Symmachus and the Samaritan Targum, which read &quot;sons of the rulers&quot;, where Targum Neophyti reads &quot;sons of the judges&quot;.

Likewise, a long-held view among some Christians is that the &quot;sons of God&quot; were the formerly righteous descendants of Seth who rebelled, while the &quot;daughters of men&quot; were the unrighteous descendants of Cain, and the Nephilim the offspring of their union. This view, dating to at least the 1st century AD in Jewish literature as described above, is also found in Christian sources from the 3rd century if not earlier, with references throughout the Clementine literature, as well as in Sextus Julius Africanus, Ephrem the Syrian, and others. Holders of this view have looked for support in Jesus&#x27; statement that &quot;in those days before the flood &quot;they&quot; [humans] were ... &quot;marrying and giving in marriage&quot;&quot; (, emphasis added).

Some individuals and groups, including St. Augustine, John Chrysostom, and John Calvin, take the view of Genesis 6:2 that the &quot;Angels&quot; who fathered the Nephilim referred to certain human males from the lineage of Seth, who were called &quot;sons of God&quot; probably in reference to their prior covenant with Yahweh (cf. ; ); according to these sources, these men had begun to pursue bodily interests, and so took wives of &quot;the daughters of men&quot;, e.g., those who were descended from Cain or from any people who did not worship God.

This also is the view of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, supported by their own Ge&#x27;ez manuscripts and Amharic translation of the Haile Selassie Bible—where the books of 1 Enoch and Jubilees, counted as canonical by this church, differ from western academic editions. The &quot;Sons of Seth view&quot; is also the view presented in a few extra-biblical, yet ancient works, including Clementine literature, the 3rd century &quot;Cave of Treasures&quot;, and the Ge&#x27;ez work &quot;The Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan&quot;. In these sources, these offspring of Seth were said to have disobeyed God, by breeding with the Cainites and producing wicked children &quot;who were all unlike&quot;, thus angering God into bringing about the Deluge, as in the &quot;Conflict&quot;:
===Offspring of Orion===
In Aramaic culture, the term &quot;nephilim&quot; refers to the offspring of Orion in mythology. However, the Brown–Driver–Briggs lexicon notes this as a &quot;dubious etymology&quot; and &quot;all very precarious&quot;.

==Arabian paganism==
Fallen angels were believed by Arab pagans to be sent to earth in form of men. Some of them mated with humans and gave rise to hybrid children. As recorded by Al-Jahiz, a common belief held that Abu Jurhum, the ancestor of the Jurhum tribe, was actually the son of a disobedient angel and a human woman.

==Fossil remains of giants ==

Alleged discoveries of Nephilim remains have been a common source of hoaxing and misidentification. 

In 1577, a series of large bones discovered near Lucerne were interpreted as the bones of an antediluvian giant about tall. In 1786, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach found out that these remains belonged to a mammoth. Cotton Mather believed that fossilized leg bones and teeth discovered near Albany, New York in 1705 were the remains of Nephilim who perished in a great flood. Paleontologists have identified these as mastodon remains.
In 1869, the Cardiff Giant, a hoax intended to fool believers in Nephilim, was supposedly discovered in Cardiff, New York.

==In popular culture==

The name and idea of Nephilim, like many other religious concepts, is sometimes used in popular culture. Examples include the gothic rock band Fields of the Nephilim; &quot;The Renquist Quartet&quot; novels by Mick Farren; &quot;The Mortal Instruments&quot;, &quot;The Infernal Devices&quot;, &quot;The Last Hours&quot;, &quot;The Dark Artifices&quot; and other books in &quot;The Shadowhunter Chronicles&quot; series by Cassandra Clare; the &quot;Hush, Hush&quot; series by Becca Fitzpatrick; the book &quot;Many Waters&quot; by Madeleine L&#x27;Engle; and TV series &quot;The X-Files&quot; and &quot;Supernatural.&quot;

In the video game series &quot;Darksiders&quot;, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are said to be Nephilim, wherein the Nephilim were created by the unholy union of angels and demons. Dante and Vergil, the main characters of the game &quot;&quot; (2013), a reboot of the popular original series &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, are also referred to as Nephilim; being the offspring of the demon Sparda and the angel Eva. In the trading card game &quot;&quot;, the Nephilim are interpreted as &#x27;Old Gods&#x27; from before modern society. In the Nephalem were the first humans upon Sanctuary, created as a result of the union between angels and demons. They figure prominently in the plot of &quot;Antarktos Rising&quot; by author Jeremy Robinson. In the heist-themed first person shooter several paintings, artifacts, and far off visuals reference the Nephilim, and a secret ending to the game brings in alien technology supposedly left by the Nephilim. A creature referred to as &quot;Nephilim&quot; appears in season 2 of the Japanese animated series &quot;Symphogear&quot;. &quot;Nephilim&quot; is a role-playing game about powerful elemental entities reincarnating into human beings. Nephilim feature into the plot of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle with Indy encountering a secret order in the Vatican whose members are giants alleged to be the descendants of Nephilim.
There are several movies, videos, documentaries, and podcasts on Nephilim.

<text>Sussex Drive (), also known as Ottawa Regional Road93, is an arterial road in Ottawa, Ontario, the capital of Canada. It is one of the city&#x27;s main ceremonial and institutional routes. Travelling roughly parallel to the Ottawa River, Sussex Drive begins as a continuation of Sir George-Étienne Cartier Parkway at Rideau Gate, at the entrance to Rideau Hall. It travels south to Rideau Street, with the portion south of St. Patrick Street forming the northbound half of a one-way pair with Mackenzie Avenue. Both Mackenzie Avenue and Sussex Drive connect with Colonel By Drive at their southern end, which continues south alongside the Rideau Canal.

Sussex Drive was laid out as three separately named streets during the establishment of Ottawa in the first half of the 19th century: Sussex Street, between Bolton Street and Rideau Street; Metcalfe Street, between Bolton Street and the Rideau River; and Ottawa Street between the river and Rockcliffe Park. The latter two were renamed as an extension of Sussex Street following Ottawa&#x27;s annexation of New Edinburgh in 1886. Numerous government institutions were established along Sussex in the early 20th century, and embassies were established following World War II. As a result of the Greber Plan, the road was widened and rebuilt and the buildings along it refurbished throughout the 1950s and 1960s. It was renamed Sussex Drive in November 1953 during a visit by the Queen Mother.

== Route description ==
Known as Canada&#x27;s ceremonial road,
Sussex Drive is a boulevard through the ByWard Market, Lower Town and New Edinburgh neighbourhoods of Ottawa. A number of landmarks, embassies and institutions line the road, many of which are designated National Historical Sites. In addition, a number of parks and monuments are located throughout the length of the route, several of which overlook the Ottawa River.
The entire route forms a portion of Confederation Boulevard, a ceremonial route around Ottawa and Gatineau used by foreign dignitaries and during royal visits to Canada.
The City of Ottawa, which has jurisdiction over the entire route, classifies Sussex Drive as an urban arterial road throughout its length.

Sussex Drive begins at a traffic circle adjacent to Rockcliffe Park, through which the roadway continues as Sir George-Étienne Cartier Parkway.
Adjacent to the traffic circle are Rideau Hall at 1Sussex Drive, home to the Governor General, the Prime Minister&#x27;s residence at 24 Sussex Drive directly opposite Rideau Hall, and the High Commission of South Africa. Sussex Drive proceeds south-southwest, parallel to the southern shoreline of the Ottawa River, as a two-lane road with a central raised median or turn lane. The Embassy of France and the Centre for Geography and Exploration bookend the portion of the route through New Edinburgh.
Widening to four lanes as it crosses the first of the ByTown Bridges over the Rideau River, Sussex Drive passes above Rideau Falls onto Green Island.
There the John G. Diefenbaker Building, former Ottawa City Hall, is complemented by the Ottawa Memorial, Mackenzie–Papineau Monument, the National Artillery Monument, and a statue of John McCrae.
Crossing the second bridge, the road returns to the mainland in the Lower Town neighbourhood and intersects the northern end of King Edward Avenue, which provides access to Quebec Autoroute 5 in Gatineau via the Macdonald-Cartier Bridge. Surrounding this intersection are the National Research of Canada (NRC) Laboratories as well as the Lester B. Pearson Building, which is home to Global Affairs Canada. The former residence of John A. Macdonald, Earnscliffe, is preserved at 140Sussex Drive, adjacent to the NRC Labs.

Crossing over the southern end of the Macdonald-Cartier Bridge, Sussex Drive passes the Delegation of the Ismaili Imamat and the Embassy of Saudi Arabia. It gradually curves south-southeast around the Embassy of Japan before straightening out and travelling between the Royal Canadian Mint and Élisabeth Bruyère Hospital, the first hospital in Ottawa, situated at 43Bruyère Street. The Global Centre for Pluralism, which opened in the former Canadian War Museum in 2017, and the Embassy of Kuwait immediately follow the previous two buildings on either side of the road. Approaching the ByWard Market, the route passes the Canada School of Public Service at La Salle Academy and the Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica to the east and the National Gallery of Canada to the west, which features a Maman sculpture in front of the entrance.
At the Alexandra Bridge approach, Sussex Drive becomes a northbound one-way arterial road paired with Mackenzie Avenue, which serves southbound traffic. St. Patrick Street and Murray Street, also a one-way pair, provide access to and from the bridge. The four roads combined encircle the Peacekeeping Monument, while Major&#x27;s Hill Park lies to the southwest of this junction. Entering the ByTown Market along its western edge, Sussex Drive features wall-to-wall storefronts with apartments above them on the east side and the Embassy of the United States on the west side. The Former Geological Survey of Canada Building and Connaught Building sandwich the road at George Street. Sussex Street ends at Rideau Street, where it and Mackenzie Avenue connect with Colonel By Drive south along the eastern bank of the Rideau Canal. The Rideau Centre stands on the southeast corner of the intersection, while the former Union Station which was repurposed into the Senate of Canada Building is on the southwest corner. The Daly Building once stood between Sussex and Mackenzie on the north side of Rideau Street, but was demolished in the early 1990s and replaced by a residential condominium in 2005.

=== Points of interest ===

== History ==

Sussex Drive is named after Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex (1773–1843), son of King George III, and an early abolitionist. 
It was known as Sussex Street until 1953, when it was renamed during a visit by the Queen Mother. Originally it was the primary road in Ottawa, serving to connect the former Union Station (now the Senate of Canada Building) with the Queen&#x27;s Wharf at the foot of the Rideau Canal.
The street continued as Metcalfe Street to New Edinburgh, becoming Ottawa Street at the Nepean–Gloucester boundary along the Rideau River and ending at Rockcliffe Park.
Sussex Street was built on land acquired by Colonel John By (1779–1836), whom laid out Upper and Lower Bytown,
and by Thomas McKay (1792–1855), whom built the locks where the Rideau Canal meets the Ottawa River. McKay gradually purchased over of land and established New Edinburgh in 1832.
New Edinburgh was incorporated as a village on August15, 1866, and annexed by the City of Ottawa in 1886.
As a result of this, Metcalfe Street and Ottawa Street were renamed as part of Sussex Street.

On the eve of Confederation, Rideau Hall, which was built by McKay, was leased to the government of Canada West in 1865 before being bought outright in 1867.
This, along with John A. Macdonald&#x27;s home Earnscliffe, would establish Sussex Street as the heart of the new capital of Canada.
By this time, several of the non-governmental institutions were established along the street, including Ottawa General Hospital (now Élisabeth Bruyère Hospital), Bytown College (now La Salle Academy), Notre-Dame Cathedral, the Former Geological Survey of Canada Building, the Revere Hotel, and what is now 24Sussex Drive. These buildings, as well as houses, shops and hotels, were built following the passage of the Vesting Act in 1843, which subdivided the land in Lower Town, as well as the arrival of the railway in 1854.
The ByWard Market was subsequently established over the next half century.
During the early 1900s, several notable government institutions were built along Sussex Street, including the Dominion Archives in 1906 (later the Canadian War Museum, now the Global Centre for Pluralism), the Royal Canadian Mint in 1908,
and the Connaught Building in 1915. The Daly Building, which opened as a department store in 1905, was purchased by the government in 1921; it was demolished in 1991 after standing vacant for several years.
Throughout the mid-20th century, a large portion of Ottawa saw massive gentrification under the Greber Plan,
which was produced by Jacques Gréber in 1949 under the direction of Prime Minister Mackenzie King. Although Gréber had been corresponding with King as early as 1936, World War II halted any plans from reaching fruition at that time. Following the war, Gréber was again contacted and his expertise requested. He arrived on October2, 1945, and began working almost immediately.
The Greber Plan, as it came to be known, was released in 1950 and presented to the House of Commons on May 22, 1951.
The plan called for the complete reorganization of Ottawa&#x27;s road and rail network, including numerous parkways and an east to west expressway (The Queensway) along what was then a Canadian National Railway line.

The Federal District Commission began implementation of the Greber Plan at the behest of Ottawa mayor Charlotte Whitton in 1953, including several projects along Sussex Street that would remove the street car tracks along it and widen it to four lanes with a central boulevard. The iron bridges over the Rideau River were rebuilt as concrete spans and overhead wires were mostly rerouted underground.
These projects were completed in anticipation of a visit by the Queen Mother in late 1954, at which point Sussex Street was renamed Sussex Drive.
She toured Ottawa in November of that year, officially dedicating the Bytown Bridges, Sussex Drive, and Colonel By Drive on November16.

=== National Capital Commission ===
In 1959, following the passage of the National Capital Act the previous year, the National Capital Commission (NCC) was formed. The act replaced the FDC with the NCC and gave it broad ranging powers, including the ability to expropriate land.
One of the first issues that came before the NCC was the increasing commercialisation of Sussex Drive. In particular, the demolition of the 100-year-old Goulden Hotel at the corner of Bruyere Street drew the ire of locals and set forth a movement to preserve the historic character of the road. Consequently, the NCC set forth in 1961 to purchase the remaining properties along Sussex Drive that were over 100years old and establish a grand &quot;Mile of History&quot;.
Architect Peter Stoakes was tasked with uncovering historical records for each property and conducting studies into their current condition. While a number of a buildings were determined to be unfit and demolished, the remainder saw fire exits moved from the street, and facades sand-blasted, painted, and embellished to recreate an 1867 appearance.
However, the plan was never fully realised due to a number of a factors, including a shift in government with the election of Lester B. Pearson in 1963, as well as other more urgent priorities such as the Macdonald-Cartier Bridge approaches, Union Station, and Highway 417.
Despite this, the NCC purchased every historic property on the road by 1963.

Following the removal of the railways into Union Station in 1966, planning for the Rideau Centre commenced, which would result in several changes to the street network in the ByWard Market.
Colonel By Drive was extended from Hawthorne Avenue to Rideau Street in 1967, connecting with the southern end of Sussex Drive and Mackenzie Avenue.
In 1973, plans were announced to rebuild the Sussex Drive, Mackenzie Avenue, St. Patrick Street and Murray Street intersections and make the roads into one-way pairs. Murray Street would be extended west of Sussex Drive and Mackenzie Avenue would be realigned to gradually merge into Sussex Drive at St. Andrew Street.
However, these plans, as well as the Rideau Centre, would be stalled for nearly a decade due to public opposition to various proposals. Work eventually began on both in late 1981.
Sussex Street and Mackenzie Avenue were reopened as paired one-way streets in July 1982. The intersections with Murray Street and St. Patrick Street were rebuilt again in 1983 in order to remove the wasted triangle of land between Mackenzie Avenue and Sussex Drive north of St. Patrick Street.

A number of nations purchased properties along Sussex Drive throughout the years in order to establish embassies. The Embassy of France and the High Commission of South Africa were both established prior to World War II,
while Japan and Saudi Arabia both purchased land for their embassies in 1978, although the latter did not open until 2005.
The American Embassy was opened by US president Bill Clinton on October 8, 1999.
The Kuwait Embassy was opened in 2003.

<text>Jack Melton &quot;John&quot; Boardman (born September 8, 1932) is an American physicist. He is a former professor of physics at Brooklyn College; a noted science fiction fan, author and fanzine publisher; and a gaming authority.

== Academic career ==
Boardman earned his BA at the University of Chicago in 1952 and his MS from Iowa State University in 1956. He then attended Florida State University to begin his doctoral studies. However, he was expelled in 1957 due to his involvement with the Inter-Civic Council and more specifically for inviting three black Florida A&amp;M exchange students to a Christmas party.

He ultimately received his PhD in physics at Syracuse University in 1962; his doctoral thesis was titled &quot;Quantization of the General Theory of Relativity&quot;. His publications include &quot;Spherical Gravitational Waves&quot; (a collaboration with Peter Bergmann, former research assistant to Albert Einstein), &quot;Contributions to the Quantization Problem in General Relativity&quot;, and &quot;The Normal Modes Of A Hanging Oscillator Of Order &quot;N&quot;.

== Boardman and gaming ==
Boardman was involved in early play-by-mail (PBM) for the &quot;Diplomacy&quot; game, and for a small fee he would send copies of each player&#x27;s turns to every other player involved in a game. He is one of the most noted figures in the game of Diplomacy, having established the original play-by-mail setup in 1961, and also the system of numbering each game for statistical purposes. These numbers, known as Boardman Numbers, include the year and a letter indicating sequence. For instance, 2004A was the first game started in 2004.

Boardman started the first successful postal Diplomacy zine, &quot;Graustark&quot;, in 1963 as an offshoot from his science fiction fanzine &quot;Knowable&quot;. Soon &quot;Graustark&quot; grew from just a gameturn-report newsletter to a hobby activity similar to science fiction fanzines. Boardman continued to produce &quot;Graustark&quot; for almost 50 years, publishing issue 793 in June 2013.

== Science fiction ==
Boardman has long been an active member of science fiction fandom, famed for his strong political opinions; and has been the subject of at least two filksongs: &quot;To John Boardman in Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;All Hail to the Fan John B.&quot; In addition to &quot;Knowable&quot;, his science fiction fanzines have included &quot;Dagon&quot; and &quot;Anakreon&quot;. He has also written at least two published fantasy stories, &quot;Colon the Conqueror&quot; (a Conan the Barbarian parody), published in the May 1958 issue of &quot;Fantastic Universe&quot;; and &quot;The Testament of Snefru&quot;, published in the 1980 anthology &quot;The Spell of Conan&quot; (L. Sprague de Camp, ed.).

=== &quot;The Asteroid Light&quot; ===
Boardman&#x27;s 1961 filksong, &quot;The Asteroid Light&quot; (to the tune of the sea chanty &quot;Eddystone Light&quot;) has been reprinted repeatedly, in venues ranging from science fiction anthologies (the 1972 anthology &quot;Futures Conditional&quot;) to &quot;Sing Out&quot; magazine (V. 9, #1, p. 24) to collections of protest music (Glazer, Tom. &quot;Songs of Peace, Freedom and Protest&quot;. New York: David McKay, 1970). It has also frequently been discussed in papers on filk music.

He also wrote a regular column, &quot;Science for Science Fiction&quot;, for the first twelve issues of &quot;Ares&quot; magazine.

== Personal life ==
After having been a resident of the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, for almost half a century (his house was used as a set in Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Malcolm X&quot;), Boardman now lives in Frederick, Maryland. Boardman&#x27;s wife, Perdita Lilly Nelson Girsdansky, who was previously married to Ray Nelson, died on November 26, 2017, after a long battle with dementia.

<text>Nick Kent (born 24 December 1951) is a British rock critic and musician, best known for his writing for the &quot;NME&quot; in the 1970s, and his books &quot;The Dark Stuff&quot; (1994) and &quot;Apathy for the Devil&quot; (2010).

==Early life==
Kent, the son of a former Abbey Road Studios sound engineer, began his career as a writer at age 21 in 1972, inspired by Jack Kerouac and Hunter S. Thompson. 

Kent&#x27;s writing talent was evident at college when, after analysing James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, he was recommended to apply for further English study. But after dropping out of two universities he started to make a name for himself as a music critic in London&#x27;s underground music scene.

==Career==
Along with his contemporaries, such as Paul Morley, Charles Shaar Murray, Paul Rambali and Danny Baker, Kent is widely considered one of the most important and influential UK music journalists of the 1970s. He wrote for the British music publication &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, moving to &quot;The Face&quot; later on in his career. Kent&#x27;s writing predominantly covers the lives and music of rock-and-roll musicians. His prose is laced with images of self-destruction and compassion, exploring the reality of being an artist in the late twentieth century. Kent is the author of two books: &quot;The Dark Stuff&quot;, a collection of his journalism, and &quot;Apathy for the Devil: A 1970s Memoir,&quot; which is an autobiographical account of his life and experiences in the 1970s, published in March 2010.

In the mid-70s, Kent played guitar with an early incarnation of the Sex Pistols, and performed briefly with members of the early punk band London SS, under the name Subterraneans. Brian James, later of The Damned, said of him: &quot;Nick is a great guitarist, he plays just like Keith Richards. He&#x27;s always trying to get a band together but he just can&#x27;t do it. Nerves, I guess. It&#x27;s a shame, though, because he loves rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and he&#x27;s a great bloke.&quot;

Kent&#x27;s relationship with the punk rock scene was strained. Already a well-known music critic and a symbol of the music industry, he was assaulted by Sid Vicious with a motorcycle chain in the 100 Club. Kent relates the incident in Johnny Rogan&#x27;s book on rock management, &quot;Starmakers &amp; Svengalis&quot;; in &quot;The Filth and the Fury&quot;, director Julien Temple&#x27;s 2000 documentary of the Sex Pistols; in Jon Savage&#x27;s book &quot;England&#x27;s Dreaming&quot;; as well as in his own books, &quot;The Dark Stuff&quot; and &quot;Apathy for the Devil&quot;. Despite this infamous incident, Vicious claimed in a 1977 interview that Kent was &quot;good fun&quot; and that &quot;he bought me a meal a little while ago, it was really nice of him&quot;. In the film &quot;Sid &amp; Nancy&quot;, there is a scene where &quot;Dick Bent&quot;, described by Pistols follower Brenda Windzor (Kathy Burke) as &quot;a wanky journalist who doesn&#x27;t appreciate the Pistols&quot;, is assaulted by Sid Vicious (Gary Oldman) at one of their gigs.

Kent also had bad relations with the early punk incarnation of Adam and the Ants, starting with his &quot;NME&quot; review of the soundtrack album to Derek Jarman&#x27;s film &quot;Jubilee&quot; in which Kent labelled Adam Ant a Nazi sympathiser on account of the featured song &quot;Deutscher Girls&quot;. In retaliation, Ant sarcastically name-checked Kent in the song &quot;Press Darlings&quot; (later a B-Side of the Ants&#x27; No. 2 UK hit single &quot;Kings of the Wild Frontier&quot; and on the US edition of the hit album of the same name), claiming that &quot;If passion ends in fashion, then Nick Kent is the best dressed man in town...&quot; In addition, then-Ants guitarist Matthew Ashman assaulted Kent with a potful of strawberry jam in the queue outside Camden&#x27;s Music Machine venue.

==Personal life==
In 1974, Kent began dating and moved in with Chrissie Hynde, later lead singer of the band The Pretenders, after she began working at &quot;NME&quot;. Throughout the 1970s, Kent was a heroin addict.

Kent currently lives in Paris with his wife, and contributes articles occasionally to the British and French press, most notably &quot;The Guardian&quot;. He is the father of synthwave musician James Kent, best known as Perturbator.

<doc id="501510" wikidata="Q33255" url="?curid=501510" title="Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages">
<text>The Chukotko-Kamchatkan or Chukchi–Kamchatkan languages are a language family of extreme northeastern Siberia. Its speakers traditionally were indigenous hunter-gatherers and reindeer-herders. Chukotko-Kamchatkan is endangered. The Kamchatkan branch is moribund, represented only by Western Itelmen, with less than a hundred speakers left. The Chukotkan branch had close to 7,000 speakers left (as of 2010, the majority being speakers of Chukchi), with a reported total ethnic population of 25,000.

While the family is sometimes grouped typologically and geographically as Paleosiberian, no external genetic relationship has been widely accepted as proven. The most popular such proposals have been for links with Eskimo–Aleut, either alone or in the context of a wider grouping.

==Alternative names==
Less commonly encountered names for the family are Chukchian, Chukotian, Chukotan, Kamchukchee and Kamchukotic. Of these, &quot;Chukchian&quot;, &quot;Chukotian&quot; and &quot;Chukotan&quot; are ambiguous, since the three terms are sometimes used to refer specifically to the family&#x27;s northern branch; the last two names are portmanteau words referring to both branches.

In addition, Luorawetlan (also spelled Luoravetlan) has been in wide use since 1775 as a name for the family, although it is properly the self-designation of one of its constituent languages, Chukchi. 
==Languages==
The Chukotko-Kamchatkan family consists of two distantly related dialect clusters, Chukotkan and Kamchatkan. Chukotkan is considered anywhere from three to five languages, whereas there is only one surviving Kamchatkan language, Itelmen.

The relationship of the Chukotkan languages to Itelmen is at best distant, and has been met with only partial acceptance by scholars.

All the Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages are under pressure from Russian. Almost all speakers are bilingual in Russian, and few members of the ethnic groups associated with the languages born after 1970 speak any language but Russian.

The accepted classification is this:
* Chukotko-Kamchatkan
** Kamchatkan
*** Southern Kamchadal 
*** Eastern Kamchadal 
*** Itelmen (Western Kamchadal)
** Chukotkan
*** Chukchi
*** Koryak
*** Alyutor
*** Kerek 
==Relation to other language families==
The Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages have no generally accepted relation to any other language family. There are several theories about possible relationships to existing or hypothetical language families.

===Paleosiberian===
The Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages are sometimes classified among the Paleosiberian languages, a catch-all term for language groups with no identified relationship to one another that are believed to represent remnants of the language map of Siberia prior to the advances of Turkic and Tungusic.

===Eurasiatic===
Joseph Greenberg identifies Chukotko-Kamchatkan (which he names Chukotian) as a member of Eurasiatic, a proposed macrofamily that includes Indo-European, Altaic, and Eskimo–Aleut, among others. Greenberg also assigns Nivkh and Yukaghir, sometimes classed as &quot;Paleosiberian&quot; languages, to the Eurasiatic family.

While the Eurasiatic hypothesis has been well received by Nostraticists and some Indo-Europeanists, it remains very controversial. Part of the reason is that the Eurasiatic hypothesis rests on mass comparison of lexemes, grammatical formatives, and vowel systems (see Greenberg 2000–2002), rather than on the prevailing view that regular sound correspondences that are linked to a wide array of lexemes and grammatical formatives are the only valid means to establish genetic relationship (see for instance Baldi 2002:2–19).

Murray Gell-Mann, Ilia Peiros, and Georgiy Starostin group Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages and Nivkh with Almosan instead of Eurasiatic.

===Uralo-Siberian===
In 1998, Michael Fortescue, a specialist in Eskimo–Aleut as well as in Chukotko-Kamchatkan, argued for a link between Uralic, Yukaghir, Chukotko-Kamchatkan, and Eskimo–Aleut calling this proposed grouping Uralo-Siberian.

===Chukotko-Kamchatkan–Amuric===
In 2011, Fortescue instead suggested that Nivkh (Gilyak, Amuric), another Paleo-Siberian language, is related to Chukotko-Kamchatkan on the basis of morphological, typological, and lexical evidence as the closest relative of Chukotko-Kamchatkan and came to prefer an interpretation of the similarities to Uralo-Siberian through language contact. Together, Chukotko-Kamchatkan and Nivkh could form a larger Chukotko-Kamchatkan-Amuric language family, and their common ancestor might have been spoken 4000 years ago.

After serving in the Korean War, Conyers became active in the civil rights movement. He also served as an aide to Congressman John Dingell before winning election to the House in 1964. He co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus in 1969 and established a reputation as one of the most left-wing members of Congress. Conyers joined the Congressional Progressive Caucus after it was founded in 1991. Conyers supported creation of a single-payer healthcare system and sponsored the United States National Health Care Act. He also sponsored a bill to establish Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday, and was the first congressperson to introduce legislation in support of reparations for the descendants of African American slavery.

Conyers ran for Mayor of Detroit in 1989 and 1993, but he was defeated in the primary both times.

Conyers served as the ranking Democratic member on the House Committee on the Judiciary from 1995 to 2007 and again from 2011 to 2017. He served as chairman of that committee from 2007 to 2011 and as chairman of the House Oversight Committee from 1989 to 1995. As the longest-serving current member of Congress, Conyers was the dean of the House of Representatives from 2015 to 2017. By November 2017, he was the last remaining member of Congress who had served since the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson. In the wake of allegations that he had sexually harassed female staff members and secretly used taxpayer money to settle a harassment claim, Conyers resigned from Congress on December 5, 2017.

== Early life, education, and early career ==

Conyers was born and raised in Detroit, the son of Lucille Janice (Simpson) and John James Conyers, a labor leader. Among his siblings was younger brother William Conyers. After graduating from Northwestern High School, Conyers served in the Michigan National Guard from 1948 to 1950; the U.S. Army from 1950 to 1954; and the U.S. Army Reserves from 1954 to 1957. Conyers served for a year in Korea during the Korean War as an officer in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and was awarded combat and merit citations.

After his active military service, Conyers pursued a college education. He earned both his BA (1957) and LL.B. (1958) degrees from Wayne State University. After he was admitted to the bar, he worked on the staff of Congressman John Dingell. He also served as counsel to several Detroit-area labor union locals. From 1961 to 1963, he was a referee for Michigan&#x27;s workmen&#x27;s compensation department.

Conyers became one of the leaders of the civil rights movement. He was present in Selma, Alabama, on October 7, 1963, for the voter registration drive known as Freedom Day.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
=== Elections ===

In 1964, Conyers ran for an open seat in what was then the 1st District, and defeated Republican Robert Blackwell with 84% of the vote. He was reelected 13 times with even larger margins. After the 1990 United States census, Michigan lost a congressional district, and there was redistricting. Conyers&#x27;s district was renumbered as the 14th district.
In 1992, Conyers won re-election to his 15th term in his new district, which included western suburbs of Detroit, with 82% of the vote against Republican nominee John Gordon. He won re-election another nine times after that. His worst re-election performance was in 2010, when he got 77% of the vote against Republican nominee Don Ukrainec. In 2013, his district was renamed as the 13th district.

In total, Conyers won re-election twenty-five times and was serving in his twenty-sixth term. He was the dean of the House as longest-serving current member, the third longest-serving member of the House in history, and the sixth longest-serving member of Congress in history. He was the second-longest serving member of either house of Congress in Michigan&#x27;s history, trailing only his former boss, Dingell. He was also the last member of the large Democratic freshman class of 1964 who was still serving in the House.

In May 2014, Wayne County Clerk Cathy Garrett determined that Conyers had not submitted enough valid nominating petition signatures to appear on the August 2014 Primary Election ballot. Two of his workers circulating petitions were not themselves registered voters at the time, which was required under Michigan law. But on May 23, Federal District Judge Matthew Leitman issued an injunction placing Conyers back on the ballot, ruling that the requirement that circulators be registered voters was similar to an Ohio law which had been found unconstitutional in 2008 by a Federal appeals court. The Michigan Secretary of State&#x27;s office subsequently announced they would not appeal the ruling.

=== Tenure ===

Conyers was one of the 13 founding members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) and was considered the Dean of that group. Formed in 1969, the CBC was founded to strengthen African American lawmakers&#x27; ability to address the legislative concerns of Black and minority citizens. He served longer in Congress than any other African American. In 1971, he was one of the original members of Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List.

In 1965, Conyers won a seat as a freshman on the influential Judiciary Committee, which was then chaired by Democratic Congressman Emanuel Celler of New York. The assignment was considered an elite one, as Judiciary ranked behind only Ways and Means and Appropriations in terms of the number of Members who sought assignment there.
According to the &quot;National Journal&quot;, Conyers has been considered, with Pete Stark, John Lewis, Jim McDermott, and Barbara Lee, to be one of the most liberal members of Congress for many years. Rosa Parks, known for her prominent role in the Montgomery, Alabama bus boycott, moved to Detroit and served on Conyers&#x27;s staff between 1965 and 1988.

Conyers was known to have opposed regulation of online gambling. He opposed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006. After the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, Conyers introduced the first bill in Congress to make King&#x27;s birthday a federal holiday. He continued to propose legislation to establish the federal holiday in every session of Congress from 1968 to 1983, when Martin Luther King Jr. Day was finally signed into law by President Ronald Reagan.

In 1983 he joined with 7 other congressional representatives to sponsor a resolution to impeach Ronald Reagan over his sudden and unexpected invasion of Grenada.

According to &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Conyers was a member of the Democratic Socialists of America in 1983.

Conyers introduced the &quot;Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act&quot; () in January 1989. He re-introduced this bill each congressional term. It calls for establishing a commission to research the history of slavery in the United States and its effects on current society, which is to recommend ways to remedy this injustice against African Americans. The current version was introduced and referred to committee on January 3, 2013. Conyers first introduced the proposed resolution in 1989, and has stated his intention to annually propose this act until it is approved and passed. Since 1997, the bill has been designated &quot;H.R. 40&quot;, most recently, , alluding to the promise of &quot;forty acres and a mule&quot;. If passed, the commission would explore the longstanding effects of slavery on today&#x27;s society, politics, and economy.
Conyers served as the ranking Democratic member on the House Committee on the Judiciary from 1995 to 2007 and again from 2011 to 2017. He served as chairman of that committee from 2007 to 2011 and as chairman of the House Oversight Committee from 1989 to 1995. As the longest-serving current member of Congress, Conyers was the dean of the House of Representatives from 2015 to 2017.

In March 2016, Rep. Conyers and Representative Hank Johnson introduced legislation to protect consumers&#x27; access to civil courts. The bill was entitled the &quot;Restoring Statutory Rights Act&quot;.

Conyers served more than 50 years in Congress, becoming the sixth-longest serving member of Congress in U.S. history; he was the longest-serving African American member of Congress. By November 2017, Conyers was the last remaining member of Congress who had served since the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson.

=== Nixon and Watergate ===

Conyers was critical of President Richard Nixon during his tenure. He was listed as number 13 on President Nixon&#x27;s enemies list during the president&#x27;s 1969–74 presidential tenure. The president&#x27;s Chief Counsel described him as &quot;coming on fast&quot;, and said he was &quot;emerging&quot; as a &quot;black anti-Nixon spokesman&quot;. Conyers, who voted to impeach Nixon in July 1974, wrote at the time,

=== National Health Care Act ===

Conyers submitted the United States National Health Care Act (Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act) (H.R. 676); as of 2015, it had 49 cosponsors. He introduced it with 25 cosponsors, in 2003, and reintroduced it each session since then. The act calls for the creation of a universal single-payer health care system in the United States, in which the government would provide every resident health care free of charge. To eliminate disparate treatment between richer and poorer Americans, the Act would prohibit private insurers from covering any treatment or procedure already covered by the Act.

===House impeachment manager in Hastings trial===
Conyers was one of the House impeachment managers who prosecuted the in case the impeachment trial of Judge Alcee Hastings. Hastings was found guilty by the United States Senate and removed from his federal judgeship.

=== Downing Street memo ===

On May 5, 2005, Conyers and 88 other members of Congress wrote an open letter to the White House inquiring about the Downing Street memo. This was a leaked memorandum that revealed an apparent secret agreement between the Bush administration and the Second Blair ministry to invade Iraq in 2002. &quot;The Times&quot;, among the first to publish news of the leak, wrote that the discovered documented revealed the intentions of Bush and Blair to invade Iraq, along with revealing that the two had &quot;discussed creating pretextual justifications for doing so.&quot;

The memo story broke in the United Kingdom, but did not receive much coverage in the United States. Conyers said: &quot;This should not be allowed to fall down the memory hole during wall-to-wall coverage of the Michael Jackson trial and a runaway bride.&quot; Conyers and others reportedly considered sending a congressional investigation delegation to London.

=== &quot;What Went Wrong in Ohio&quot; ===
In May 2005, Conyers released a report about voting irregularities in the state of Ohio during the 2004 U.S. presidential election called &quot;What Went Wrong in Ohio: The Conyers Report On The 2004 Presidential Election&quot;. Some of the claims in the report pertaining to voter suppression tend to have been supported, including through court cases. Some of the claims pertaining to manipulation of the count and similar election fraud have been refuted. Consequently this report should be considered a representation of a minority view.

The report included the following claims: 
* Too few voting machines in Kerry-voting wards, leading to long queues. A &quot;Washington Post&quot; piece exemplified Franklin County, where wards with many machines per voter mostly had Bush majorities, and wards with relatively few machines per voter were typically in favor of Kerry. The numbers disenfranchised statewide were in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of voters.
* Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell made a decision to limit provisional ballots, leading to the estimated disenfranchisement of tens or hundreds of thousands of voters.
* Voter turnout for minorities was suppressed by caging targeting 35,000 of these voters, and &quot;challenging&quot; tactics were used to intimidate voters and cause longer lines.
* Where absentee ballots were not issued in time, provisional ballots were not permitted, affecting thousands or tens of thousands, especially seniors. The order from Ken Blackwell to do this was found illegal by a federal court, violating the Help America Vote Act.
* Improper voter purges and registration errors disenfranchised at least 10,000 voters, likely tens of thousands statewide.
* 93,000 spoiled ballots where no vote was cast for president, including undervote rates as high as 25% in some counties, from people who likely stood in line.
* Statistical abnormalities in the differences between exit poll results and actual votes registered at those locations.
* Issues of faulty electronic voting machines, such as over 24 electronic machines in Mahoning County transferring an indeterminate quantity of votes into the Bush column and out of the Kerry column.
* In Warren County, public observers were prevented from viewing the vote counting, due to specious claims that a terrorist threat had been called by the FBI. The FBI stated it gave no such warnings.
* Little-known third party candidates got twenty times more votes than would be expected in Cuyahoga County.
* Voter turnout of a suspiciously-high 98.55% in Miami County.
* Provisional ballots being rejected due to lack of guidance on how to process. In once case, about 8,000 of the 24,000 provisional ballots were rejected.
* Cheat sheets were handed out by a voting machine manufacturer to the election officials, giving guidance on how to avoid doing a hand-recount in the face of anomalies.

While some courts before the election found that certain restrictive voting policies of Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell were illegal, claims of voter and machine fraud swaying the election have not achieved mainstream acceptance, and several have been refuted.

Conyers was one of 31 members of the House who voted not to count the 20 electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election. The state was won by Republican President George Bush by 118,457 votes.

=== Constitution in Crisis ===


On August 4, 2006, Conyers released his report, &quot;The Constitution in Crisis: The Downing Street Minutes and Deception, Manipulation, Torture, Retributions and Cover-ups in the Iraq War&quot;, an edited collection of information intended to serve as evidence that the Bush administration altered intelligence to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

&quot;The Constitution in Crisis&quot; examines much of the evidence presented by the Bush administration prior to the invasion and questions the credibility of their sources of intelligence. In addition, the document investigates conditions that led to the torture scandal at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, as well as further evidence of torture having been committed but not made known to the public. Finally, the document reports on a series of &quot;smear tactics&quot; purportedly used by the administration in dealing with its political adversaries. The document calls for the censure of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. Conyers refused to back impeachment proceedings, however.

=== On anti-Muslim intolerance ===

Conyers proposed House Resolution 288, which condemns &quot;religious intolerance&quot; and emphasizes Islam as needing special protection from acts of violence and intolerance. It states that &quot;it should never be official policy of the United States Government to disparage the Quran, Islam, or any religion in any way, shape, or form,&quot; and &quot;calls upon local, State, and Federal authorities to work to prevent bias-motivated crimes and acts against all individuals, including those of the Islamic faith.&quot; The bill was referred to the House subcommittee on the Constitution in June 2005.

In 2005, Conyers introduced House Resolution 160, a house resolution that would have condemned the conduct of Narendra Modi, then the chief minister of the State of Gujarat in India. The resolution was cosponsored by Republican Representative Joseph R. Pitts (Republican of Pennsylvania). The resolution&#x27;s title was: &quot;Condemning the conduct of Chief Minister Narendra Modi for his actions to incite religious persecution and urging the United States to condemn all violations of religious freedom in India.&quot; The resolution cited a 2004 United States Commission on International Religious Freedom report on Modi stating that he was &quot;widely accused of being reluctant to bring the perpetrators of the killings of Muslims and non-Hindus to justice&quot;. (See 2002 Gujarat riots.) The resolution was not adopted.

=== Conyers v. Bush ===

In April 2006 Conyers, together with ten other senior congressmen, filed an action in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, challenging the constitutionality of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The complaint alleged the bill was not afforded due consideration by the United States Congress before being signed by the President. The action was subsequently dismissed on grounds of lack of standing.

=== Ethics controversy ===

In April 2006, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office sent independent letters to the House Ethics Committee, saying two former aides of Conyers had alleged that Conyers used his staff to work on several local and state campaigns of other politiciansincluding his wifefor the Detroit City Council. (She won a seat in 2005.) He also forced them to baby-sit and chauffeur his children.

In late December 2006, Conyers &quot;accepted responsibility&quot; for violating House rules. A statement issued December 29, 2006, by the House Ethics Committee chairman Doc Hastings and Ranking Minority Member Howard Berman, said Conyers acknowledged what he characterized as a &quot;lack of clarity&quot; in his communications with staff members regarding their official duties and responsibilities, and accepted responsibility for his actions.

In deciding to drop the matter, Hastings and Berman said:
=== Copyright bill ===

Conyers repeatedly introduced the Fair Copyright in Research Works Act, a bill that would overturn the NIH Public Access Policy, an open-access mandate of the National Institutes of Health. Conyers&#x27;s bill would forbid the government from mandating that federally funded research be made freely available to the public. The legislation was supported by the publishing industry, and opposed by groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Writers Lawrence Lessig and Michael Eisen accused Conyers of being influenced by publishing houses, who have contributed significant money to his campaigns.

=== House Report on George W. Bush presidency and proposed inquiry ===

On January 13, 2009, the House Committee on the Judiciary, led by Conyers, released &quot;Reining in the Imperial Presidency: Lessons and Recommendations Relating to the Presidency of George W. Bush&quot;, a 486-page report detailing alleged abuses of power that occurred during the Bush administration, and a comprehensive set of recommendations to prevent recurrence. Conyers introduced a bill to set up a &quot;truth commission&quot; panel to investigate alleged policy abuses of the Bush administration.

=== Bill reading controversy ===

In late July 2009, Conyers, commenting on the healthcare debate in the House, stated: &quot;I love these members, they get up and say, &#x27;Read the bill&#x27;... What good is reading the bill if it&#x27;s a thousand pages and you don&#x27;t have two days and two lawyers to find out what it means after you read the bill?&quot; His remark brought criticism from government transparency advocates such as the Sunlight Foundation, which referred to readthebill.org in response.

=== Response to accusations regarding American Muslim spies ===

In October, Conyers responded to allegations from four Republican Congress Members, in the wake of the launch of the book &quot;Muslim Mafia&quot;, that the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) sought to plant Muslim &quot;spies&quot; in Capitol Hill. He strongly opposed the accusations, saying:

=== WikiLeaks ===

At a December 16, 2010, hearing of the House Judiciary Committee on the subject of &quot;the Espionage Act and the Legal and Constitutional Issues Raised by WikiLeaks&quot;, Conyers &quot;argue[d] strongly against prosecuting WikiLeaks in hasteor at all.&quot; He strongly defended the whistleblowing organization, saying:
Conyers&#x27;s statement was &quot;in marked contrast to the repeated calls from other members of Congress and Obama administration officials to prosecute WikiLeaks head Julian Assange immediately.&quot;

=== Foreign policy ===

In 2014, Conyers, along with Ted Yoho, introduced a bipartisan amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act which would prohibit the United States Armed Forces from providing any form of assistance to the Azov Battalion, a National Guard of Ukraine unit accused by Conyers of being a &quot;far-right white supremacist militia&quot;. The amendment was subsequently passed by the House of Representatives in 2015. Conyers&#x27; decision to introduce the amendment was the subject of both praise and criticism, with detractors noting that claiming that large numbers of Neo-Nazis are members of the Azov Battalion is a common theme of propaganda in Russia.

Conyers stated, &quot;If there&#x27;s one simple lesson we can take away from U.S. involvement in conflicts overseas, it&#x27;s this: Beware of unintended consequences. As was made vividly clear with U.S. involvement in Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion decades ago, overzealous military assistance or the hyper-weaponization of conflicts can have destabilizing consequences and ultimately undercut our own national interests.&quot; He also voiced concerns about sending anti-aircraft missiles to Syrian rebels.

=== Sexual harassment allegations and resignation ===

In 2015, a former employee of Conyers alleged that he had sexually harassed her and dismissed her. She filed an affidavit with the Congressional Office of Compliance. Conyers had entered into a confidentiality agreement with the former employee and had paid her a $27,000 (~$ in ) settlement from his publicly funded office budget in 2015. &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; reported on the allegations and settlement on November 20, 2017; &quot;Buzzfeed&quot; also reported allegations that Conyers &quot;repeatedly made sexual advances to female staff,&quot; caressed female staffers&#x27; hands in a sexual manner, and rubbed their backs and legs in public.

On November 21, 2017, Conyers issued a statement in which he said, &quot;In our country, we strive to honor this fundamental principle that all are entitled to due process. In this case, I expressly and vehemently denied the allegations made against me, and continue to do so. My office resolved the allegationswith an express denial of liabilityin order to save all involved from the rigors of protracted litigation.&quot;

Also on November 21, 2017, the House Ethics Committee launched an investigation into multiple sexual harassment allegations against Conyers.

On November 22, 2017, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Melanie Sloan, founder of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), publicly accused Conyers of having harassed and verbally abused her during her tenure working for the House Judiciary Committee. On one occasion, Sloan alleged that Conyers had summoned to his office, where she found him sitting in his underwear; she quickly departed.

Later in November 2017, there were reports that another woman accused Conyers of sexual harassment. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who had initially stated that Conyers was an &quot;icon&quot; and had done a great deal to protect women, called upon Conyers to resign. She said the allegations against him were &quot;very credible&quot;.

On December 5, 2017, aged 88, Conyers resigned his House seat because of his mounting sexual scandals. The announcement came the day after another former staffer released an affidavit accusing Conyers of sexual harassment. The same day, an article by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published allegations by Courtney Morse that Conyers had threatened her with a similar fate to that of Chandra Levy, a staffer found murdered in a park in Washington, DC. She said that after she rejected his advances, he &quot;said he had insider information on the case. I don&#x27;t know if he meant it to be threatening, but I took it that way.&quot;

At a time when the MeToo movement was pushing for action against men who harassed women, some media and supporters in Detroit believed Conyers had been unfairly treated. He was reported as the &quot;first sitting politician to be ousted from office in the wake of the #MeToo movement.&quot;

== Detroit mayoral campaigns ==

While serving in the U.S. House, Conyers made two unsuccessful runs for mayor of Detroit: one in 1989 against incumbent Coleman Young and again in 1993.

=== 1989 ===

Incumbent Democratic Mayor Coleman Young decided to run for a fifth term, despite growing unpopularity and the declining economy of Detroit. In the September primary, Young won with 51% of the vote. Accountant Tom Barrow qualified for the November run-off by having 24%, and Conyers received 18% of the vote. Despite the difficulties of the city, Young defeated Barrow in the run-off with 56% of the vote.

=== 1993 ===

In June 1993, incumbent Democratic Mayor Coleman Young decided to retire instead of seeking a sixth term, citing his age and health. Many observers believed he had decided not to test his growing unpopularity. In a &quot;Detroit News&quot; poll in February, 81% said Young should retire. Conyers was one of the 23 candidates who qualified for ballot access.

Dennis Archer was the front runner in the mayoral campaign from the beginning. The 51-year-old former State Supreme Court Justice raised over $1.6million to finance his campaign. He won the September primary with 54% of the vote. Conyers came in fourth place. Archer won the November election.

== Electoral history ==

== Personal life ==

Conyers married Monica Esters, a teacher in Detroit, in 1990. She was 25 and he was 61; they had two sons together, John James III and Carl Edward Conyers. Monica Conyers served as vice administrator of Detroit&#x27;s public schools, and in 2005 was elected to the Detroit City Council. Monica Conyers pleaded guilty to bribery charges on June 26, 2009 and served slightly more than 27 months in prison; her sentence was completed on May 16, 2013. In September 2015, Monica Conyers filed for divorce, citing a &quot;breakdown of the marriage&quot;. However, the Conyerses reconciled in late 2016.

Conyers&#x27;s grandnephew, Ian Conyers, was elected to the Michigan Senate in 2016. He generated controversy by telling of Conyers&#x27;s planned retirement in interviews before the Congressman announced it himself, and claiming his great-uncle&#x27;s endorsement. Following the Congressman&#x27;s resignation, Ian Conyers announced that he would run in the special election for the Congressman&#x27;s seat. The Congressman instead endorsed his son, John Conyers III, as his successor. John Conyers III chose not to run. Ian Conyers was defeated in the Democratic primary by Rashida Tlaib.

===Death===
Conyers died at his home in Detroit on October 27, 2019, at the age of 90. His funeral was held on November4 at Detroit&#x27;s Greater Grace Temple.

== Honors and awards ==

In 2007, Conyers was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP.

<text>The Antelope Valley is located in northern Los Angeles County, California, United States, and the southeast portion of California&#x27;s Kern County, and constitutes the western tip of the Mojave Desert. It is situated between the Tehachapi, Sierra Pelona, and the San Gabriel Mountains. The valley was named for the pronghorns that roamed there until they were all eliminated in the 1880s, mostly by hunting, or resettled in other areas. The principal cities in the Antelope Valley are Palmdale and Lancaster.

==Geography==
The Antelope Valley comprises the western tip of the Mojave Desert, opening up to the Victor Valley and the Great Basin to the east. Lying north of the San Gabriel Mountains, southeast of the Tehachapis, and east of the Sierra Pelona Mountains, this desert ecosystem spans around . The valley is bounded by the Garlock and San Andreas fault systems. Precipitation in the surrounding mountain ranges contributes to groundwater recharge.

===Street grid===
Much of the Los Angeles County portion of the Antelope Valley is laid out in streets at one-mile intervals. Avenues run east-west and streets run north-south. The grid begins at Avenue A (the Los Angeles-Kern County Line), with each letter avenue (B, C...) one mile apart. From Division Street, north-south streets increase by ten each mile (10th Street West, 20th Street East...). Diagonal streets that do not follow the grid include Sierra Highway, Pearblossom Highway and Fort Tejon Road.

==Flora and fauna==

The Antelope Valley is home to a wide range of plants and animals. This includes hundreds of plants such as the California juniper, Joshua tree, California scrub oak, creosote, and wildflowers, notably the California poppy. Winter brings much-needed rain, which slowly penetrates the area&#x27;s dry ground, bringing up native grasses and wildflowers. Poppy season depends completely on the precipitation, but a good bloom can be killed off by the unusual weather in the late winter and early spring.

The Antelope Valley gets its name from its history of pronghorn grazing in large numbers. In 1882–85, the valley lost 30,000 head of antelope, almost half of the species for which it was named. Unusually heavy snows in both the mountains and the valley floor drove the antelope toward their normal feeding grounds in the eastern part of the valley. Since they would not cross the railroad tracks, many of them starved to death. The remainder of these pronghorns were hunted for their hides by settlers. Once abundant, they either died off or migrated into the Central Valley. A drought in the early 1900s caused a scarcity in bunch grass, their main food source. Now, the sighting of a pronghorn is rare, although a small number remain in the western portion of the valley.

Common game species in the Antelope Valley include mule deer and mountain quail. Other common species in the Antelope Valley include the golden-mantled ground squirrel, Beechey ground squirrel, red-tailed hawk, Cooper&#x27;s hawk, Stellar&#x27;s jay, leopard frog, and rattlesnake.

===Water issues===
Human water use in the Antelope Valley depends mainly on pumping of groundwater from the valley&#x27;s aquifers and on importing additional water from the California Aqueduct. Long-term groundwater pumping has lowered the water table, thereby increasing pumping lifts, reducing well efficiency, and causing land subsidence.

While aqueducts supply additional water that meets increasing human demand for agricultural, industrial, and domestic uses, diversion of water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in northern California has caused and causes adverse environmental and social effects in the delta: &quot;Over decades, [the] competing uses for water supply and habitat have jeopardized the Delta&#x27;s ability to meet either need. All stakeholders agree the estuary is in trouble and requires long-term solutions to ensure reliable, quality water supplies and a healthy ecosystem.&quot;

The Antelope Valley&#x27;s population growth and development place considerable stress on the local and regional water systems. According to David Leighton of the United States Geological Survey: &quot;A deliberate management effort will be required to meet future water demand in the Antelope Valley without incurring significant economic and environmental costs associated with overuse of the ground-water resource.&quot;

==Human history==

The first peoples of the Antelope Valley include the Kawaiisu, Kitanemuk, Serrano, and Tataviam. Europeans first entered in the 1770s, during the colonization of North America. Father Francisco Garcés, a Spanish Franciscan friar, is believed to have traveled the west end of the valley in 1776. The Spanish established El Camino Viejo through the western part of the valley between Los Angeles and the missions of the San Francisco Bay in the 1780s. By 1808, the Spanish had moved the native people out of the valley and into missions.

Jedediah Smith came through in 1827, and John C. Fremont made a scientific observation of the valley in 1844. After Fremont&#x27;s visit the 49ers crossed the valley via the Old Tejon Pass into the San Joaquin Valley on their way to the gold fields. Later, a better wagon road, the Stockton – Los Angeles Road route to Tejon Pass, followed in 1854. Stagecoach lines across the southern foothills came through the valley along this wagon road, and were the preferred method for travelers before the coming of the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1876. The rail service linking the valley to the Central Valley and Los Angeles started its first large influx of white settlers, and farms and towns soon sprouted on the valley floor. The aircraft (now called aerospace) industry took hold in the valley at Plant 42 in 1952. Edwards AFB, then called Muroc Army Air Field, was established in 1933.

The area was once under Mexican rule and was named after the large herds of antelope.

==Demographics==
In recent decades, the valley has become a bedroom community to the Greater Los Angeles area. Major housing-tract development and population growth took off beginning in 1983, which has increased the population of Palmdale around 12 times its former size as of 2006. Neighboring Lancaster has increased its population since the early 1980s to around three times its former level. Major retail has followed the population influx, centered on Palmdale&#x27;s Antelope Valley Mall. The Lancaster—Palmdale urbanized area is home to 372,287 people.

Some long-term residents living far out in the desert have been cited by Los Angeles County&#x27;s nuisance abatement teams for code violations, forcing residents to either make improvements or move. One of the properties is a church building that was used as a filming location for &quot;Kill Bill&quot;. The code enforcers have arrived on some of their visits in SWAT-team formats.

Hispanics and Whites make up the majority of the population.

Spanish and Tagalog are the most common foreign languages spoken in the Antelope Valley.

According to Mapping L.A., German and English were the most common ancestries and Mexico and the Philippines were the most common foreign places of birth in 2000 in Northwest Antelope Valley. Mexico and El Salvador were the most common foreign places of birth in the northwest. German and English were the most common ancestries in the northeast. German and Irish were the most common ancestries in Southeast Antelope Valley. Mexico and Colombia were the common foreign places of birth in the southeast.

==Military base==

Edwards Air Force Base lies east of Rosamond, 37 miles (60 km) northeast of Palmdale. Edwards AFB&#x27;s dry lakebeds are the lowest geographic elevation in the valley.
Significant numbers of U.S. military test flights are performed there, and it has been the site of many important aeronautical accomplishments, including the first flight to break the sound barrier, accomplished by Chuck Yeager.

NASA Space Shuttles originally landed at Edwards because the lake beds offer a vast landing area. Although NASA later built a landing strip at Kennedy Space Center, Edwards was retained as the backup in case of bad weather at Cape Canaveral.

NASA Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center is a tenant organization at Edwards AFB. The center is best known for the X-15 experimental rocket ship program. It has been the home of NASA&#x27;s high-performance aircraft research since it was founded for the X-1 program. The Space Shuttle orbiter was serviced there when it landed at Edwards.

==Industry==
===Aerospace===

U. S. Air Force Plant 42 in northeast Palmdale is home to Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and BAE Systems, among other aerospace-related companies. Notable projects assembled and/or designed there include the Space Shuttle orbiters, B-1 Lancer bombers, B-2 Spirit bombers, F-117 Nighthawk fighters, F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, and Lockheed L-1011 Tristar passenger jets.

This region also houses the newly dedicated Mojave Air and Space Port. The spaceport is famous as the base of operations for Scaled Composites, the company that designed SpaceShipOne and won the X-Prize.

Much of the work done at these facilities is performed in coordination with Edwards Air Force Base and the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (see above), from the creation and testing of proof-of-concept X-planes, to Space Shuttle operations, to the manufacturing and integration and testing of new military aviation equipment.

With the size of the industry there, Antelope Valley has been nicknamed the Aerospace Valley.

===Agriculture===
The valley&#x27;s first main industry as a part of the United States was agriculture. Historically known in the region for its extensive alfalfa fields and fruit crops, farmers now are growing a wider variety of crops, such as carrots, onions, lettuce, and potatoes. As housing tracts continue to build in the middle of the valley, the farm operations are found farther to the west and east sides than in earlier decades.

===Electricity generation===

The northern reaches of Antelope Valley are part of the Tehachapi Wind Resource Area, the largest wind resource area in California. The valley also has numerous solar farms, some of which are among the largest in the United States.

===Manufacturing===

* U.S. Pole Company Inc.

<text>The Dils were an American punk rock band formed 1976 and active until 1980, originally from Carlsbad, California, and fronted by the brothers Chip Kinman and Tony Kinman. They appeared as the second act in the &quot;battle of the bands&quot; sequence in Cheech and Chong&#x27;s film, &quot;Up In Smoke&quot;, where they can be heard before being seen performing &quot;You&#x27;re Not Blank&quot;.

== History ==
Soon after forming in late 1976, The Dils relocated to San Francisco, where they would have a significant influence on that city&#x27;s embryonic punk scene (bassist Tony Kinman played briefly with The Avengers during 1977), and then Los Angeles, becoming one of the major bands in the early Los Angeles punk scene too. They were known for their conspicuous radical left politics, and for a strong melodic sense that earned them the nickname &quot;punk rock Everly Brothers&quot;.

Their debut single was &quot;I Hate The Rich&quot; / &quot;You&#x27;re Not Blank&quot; (the latter covered by the Minneapolis punk band Dillinger Four), on Los Angeles–based label What? Records, released in 1977.

Their next record was their critical high-point, 1977&#x27;s &quot;Class War&quot; / &quot;Mr. Big&quot; (the former covered by Canadian punks D.O.A.), issued on the Dangerhouse label, in a pressing of 1500 copies entitled &quot;198 Seconds Of The Dils&quot;. The last contemporary release was a three-sided double-7&quot; in 1980, &quot;Made In Canada&quot;, produced by Bob Rock, which showed a gathering roots rock orientation. The Dils opened for The Clash in Santa Monica in 1980 and later that year the band dissolved after playing a final show with Black Flag.

Music from The Dils (including material unreleased during the band&#x27;s lifetime) remains available.

=== Possible Visual Influence ===
A 2021 article in &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine discussed the possible linkage between Dils guitarist Chip Kinman&#x27;s decoration of his instrument and the famous Frankenstrat of Eddie Van Halen.

== Post-breakup ==
The Kinmans continued to follow the roots rock direction, giving birth to the new &quot;cowpunk&quot; genre with their band Rank and File in the 1980s, along with Alejandro Escovedo. After a move in a different direction with a rock guitar and drum-machine noise project, Blackbird, they then cast a spotlight on &quot;cowboy music&quot; with Cowboy Nation in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2016, the Kinman brothers reunited for Chip&#x27;s new band, Ford Madox Ford. Released by Porterhouse records, Ford Madox Ford&#x27;s debut album, &quot;This American Blues&quot;, featured Chip on vocals and guitar, Dewey Peek (Giuliano Scarfo) on lead guitar, Matt Littell on bass and S. Scott Aguero on drums, and Tony Kinman as producer.

Tony Kinman died on May 4, 2018.

== Revival ==
Chip Kinman revived The Dils in 2019, with the first show at The Grand Star Jazz Club in Los Angeles&#x27; Chinatown on January 27. The following night, The Dils played at San Diego&#x27;s Casbah Club. Joining Kinman was his stepson Giuliano Scarfo on drums, plus Brian Melendez on bass and backing vocals.

<text>&quot;Frankenstein&quot; is an instrumental track by the American rock band Edgar Winter Group that was featured in the 1972 album &quot;They Only Come Out at Night&quot; and additionally released as a single.

The song topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for one week in May 1973, being replaced by Paul McCartney &amp; Wings&#x27;s &quot;My Love&quot;. Frankenstein sold over one million copies. It fared equally well in Canada reaching number 1 on the &quot;RPM 100&quot; Top Singles Chart the following month. That same month, the song peaked at number 18 in the UK Singles Chart. The following month, the song peaked at number 10 in Mexico. The song also peaked at number 39 in West Germany, remaining on the chart for one week. The single was certified gold on June 19, 1973, by the RIAA.

==Background==
Coined by the band&#x27;s drummer Chuck Ruff, the song&#x27;s title came about from the massive editing of the original studio recording. As the band deviated from the musical arrangement into less structured jams, the song required numerous edits to shorten it. The final track was spliced together from many sections of the original recording. Winter also frequently referred to the appropriateness of the name in relation to its &quot;monster-like, lumbering beat&quot;. (One riff was first used by Winter in the song &quot;Hung Up&quot;, on his jazz-oriented first album &quot;Entrance&quot;. He later tried a variation on it, &quot;Martians&quot; on the 1981 &quot;Standing on Rock&quot; album.)

Winter played many of the instruments on the track, including keyboards, alto saxophone and timbales. As the release&#x27;s only instrumental cut, the song was not initially intended to be on the album, and was only included on a whim as a last-minute addition. It was originally released as the B-side to &quot;Hangin&#x27; Around&quot;, but the two were soon reversed by the label when disc jockeys nationwide in the United States, as well as in Canada, were inundated with phone calls and realized this was the hit. The song features a &quot;double&quot; drum solo, with Ruff on drums and Winter on percussion. In fact, the working title of the song was &quot;The Double Drum Song&quot;. The group performed the song, with Rick Derringer on guitar, on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; in 1973.

&quot;Record World&quot; called the song &quot;a thumping instrumental featuring fine performances by each member [of the group].&quot;

The song was actually performed three years previously when Edgar was playing with his older brother Johnny Winter at the Royal Albert Hall in 1970. This rare recording was released in 2004 as one of several live bonus tracks included in the two-disc Legacy Edition CD of Johnny Winter&#x27;s &quot;Second Winter&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed it number 7 on their top 25 best rock instrumentals. Sections of the track were edited and sequenced into idents and jingles for Alan Freeman&#x27;s &quot;Top 40&quot; and &quot;Saturday Rock Show&quot; on UK&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2 for many years, often followed with Freeman&#x27;s trademark opening line &quot;Greetings Pop Pickers...&quot;

In live performances of the song, Edgar Winter further pioneered the advancement of the synthesizer as a lead instrument by becoming the first person to strap a keyboard instrument around his neck, giving him the on-stage mobility and audience interaction of guitar players.

The song is described as a hard rock, progressive rock, and blues rock instrumental, and an example of art rock by non-art rock bands.

In 1983, Winter released a beat-heavy, more-synthesizer-heavy reworking of the song; its contemporaneous video, an homage with Winter appearing as Dr. Frankenstein, was added to MTV&#x27;s playlist in November of that year.

==Personnel==
*Edgar Winter – ARP 2600 synthesizer, electric piano, alto saxophone, timbales
*Ronnie Montrose – guitar
*Dan Hartman – bass
*Chuck Ruff – drums
*Rick Derringer – producer

==Cover versions==
A cover version performed by WaveGroup Sound was featured in the video game &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; as one of five tracks in its sixth and highest difficulty tier, referred to in-game as &quot;Face Melters&quot;.

The band Phish has played the song live 92 times over their career.

<text>The Mercedes-Benz 300 SEL 6.3 is a full-sized luxury performance car built by Mercedes-Benz from 1968 to 1972. It featured the company&#x27;s powerful 6.3-litre M100 V8 from the flagship 600 (W100) limousine installed in the normally six-cylinder powered (but still premium) Mercedes-Benz 300 SEL (W109). The result was a nearly 2-ton sports sedan with muscle car performance. At the time of its release it was one of the world&#x27;s fastest four-door cars.

A total of 6,526 300 SEL 6.3s were produced, and though quite costly to maintain are very collectible today.

== Concept ==

The car started out as a private venture in 1966 by company engineer Erich Waxenberger. His principle was simple: take the powerful 6.3 litre Mercedes-Benz M100 V8 from the massive 600 saloon and limousine, and fit it into the engine bay of the top-end 6-cylinder 300 SEL W109 model. The result was an impressive level of performance for the era and for the style of automobile. 

The company turned the prototype into a production model, introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1968. This not only enhanced Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s reputation for performance vehicles, languishing since the demise of the iconic Gullwing and Mercedes-Benz 300 SL roadsters of the 1950s, but made better use of the M100 engine production facilities. By the end of line&#x27;s production the 6,500 built for the 300 SEL 6.3 far outnumbered the 2,700 turned out for the 600.

The 6.3 was known for its ability to cruise at over with five occupants in complete comfort. Later, the company also fitted new, smaller V8 engines into the W109 series. The 300 SEL 4.5 was only available in the United States, while the 280 SE 3.5 Coupé could also be ordered in Europe.

In 1975, the Mercedes-Benz 450 SEL 6.9 was introduced as a 300 SEL 6.3 successor with a larger displacement engine for more power and various modifications to the equipment.

== Features ==
The 300 SEL 6.3 was an extremely luxurious vehicle for its era. Standard features included air suspension, ventilated 4-wheel power disc brakes, power windows, central locking and power steering. Air conditioning, power sunroof, audio tape deck, and rear window curtains, writing tables, and reading lamps were available as options.

===Engine===
* 6.332-litre V8 with Bosch fuel injection, 
* at 4000 rpm, 300 HP SAE gross at 4100 rpm
* at 2800 rpm, SAE at 3000 rpm
* Max. engine speed: 5250 rpm

=== Performance ===
* 0-: 6.6 seconds
* 0- : 14.6 seconds
* Standing quarter-mile (~400 m) : 14.2 seconds
* Top speed : (factory figure)

====Test results====
Auto, Motor und Sport published the following test results for the 300 SEL 6.3 in March 1968:

* 0–: 4.3 s 
* 0–: 6.5 s 
* 0–: 9.3 s 
* 0–: 13.0 s 
* 0–: 17.3 s 
* 0–: 22.8 s 
* 0–: 31.0 s 
* 0–: 27.1 s
* Top Speed: 

== Motor racing ==

Originally not intended for motor sports, a few cars were built for racing, usually with the engine enlarged to 6.8 litres or more. The car had an impressive, but short-lived racing career, due to the lack of suitable tyres, or rule changes preventing the use of them. 

AMG, now the high-performance division of Mercedes-Benz but back then a small local tuning workshop founded by two former Mercedes engineers, modified a makeshift car to compete in racing events, nicknamed &quot;Red Sow&quot; (German: &quot;Rote Sau&quot;), which finished second in the 24 Hours of Spa in 1971. At the end of its racing career the 6,834 cc engine yielded . The car was sold to French company Matra, which used it for tests of jet fighter landing gear. Five examples were built: three racers and two test cars.

<text>Benjamin Gompertz (5 March 1779 – 14 July 1865) was an English self-educated mathematician and actuary, who became a Fellow of the Royal Society. Gompertz is now best known for his Gompertz law of mortality, a demographic model published in 1825. He was the brother of the early animal rights activist and inventor Lewis Gompertz and the poet Isaac Gompertz.

==Life==
Of the German Jewish family of Gompertz of Emmerich, Gompertz was born in London, where his father and grandfather had been successful diamond merchants. Debarred, as a Jew, from a university education, he studied on his own from an early age, in the writings of Isaac Newton, Colin Maclaurin, and William Emerson. From 1798 he was a prominent contributor to the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Mathematical Companion&quot;, and for a period won the annual prizes in the magazine for the solutions of problems. Gompertz married Abigail Montefiore (1790–1871) in 1810; they had three children.

In line with his father&#x27;s wishes, he entered the London Stock Exchange. He became a member of the Spitalfields Mathematical Society, and served as its president when it was merged with the Astronomical Society of London. In 1819 he was elected a F.R.S., and in 1832 became a member of the council. The Astronomical Society was founded in 1820, and he was elected a member of the council in 1821.

On the death of his only son he retired from the Stock Exchange, and absorbed himself in mathematics. When the Guardian Insurance Office was established in 1821, he was a candidate for the actuaryship, but the directors objected to him on the grounds that he was a Jew. His brother-in-law Sir Moses Montefiore with his relative Nathan Mayer Rothschild then founded the Alliance Assurance Company (1824), and Gompertz was appointed actuary under the deed of settlement. His management of the Alliance Company was successful, he was consulted by government, and made computations for the Army medical board.

In 1848 he retired from active work and returned to his scientific labours. He was a member of many learned societies, and was also one of the promoters of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. Of the leading Jewish charities he was a prominent member, and he worked out a plan of poor relief, which was afterwards adopted by the Jewish board of guardians.

Gompertz died from a paralytic seizure on 14 July 1865.

==Works==

;Mathematics
From 1806 he was a frequent contributor to the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; of the Royal Society; but his early tracts on complex numbers and porisms (1817–18) were self-published. Gompertz was an old-fashioned Newtonian who retained and defended the notation of fluxions.

;Astronomy
For ten years he actively participated in the work of the Astronomical Society, contributing papers on the theory of astronomical instruments, the aberration of light, the differential sextant, and the convertible pendulum. With Francis Baily he began in 1822 the construction of tables for the mean places of the fixed stars; the work was left uncompleted, because of the publication of the &quot;Fundamenta Astronomiæ&quot; of Friedrich Bessel. Their efforts, however, led to the complete catalogue of stars of the Royal Astronomical Society.

;The Gompertz model
He worked out a new series of tables of mortality for the Royal Society, and these suggested to him in 1825 his law of human mortality, which he first expounded in a letter to Francis Baily. The law rests on an &quot;a priori&quot; assumption that a person&#x27;s resistance to death decreases as his years increase. The model can be written in this way:

formula_1
where &quot;N&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) represents the number of individuals at time &quot;t&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; and &quot;a&quot; are constants.

This model is a refinement of a demographic model of Robert Malthus. It was used by insurance companies to calculate the cost of life insurance. The equation, known as a Gompertz curve, is now used in many areas to model a time series where growth is slowest at the start and end of a period. The model has been extended to the Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality.

<text>The Dassault Étendard IV is a transonic carrier-borne strike fighter aircraft developed and manufactured by French aerospace company Dassault Aviation.

Development of the Étendard originally commenced during the 1950s. Despite not having attracted the interests of either the French Army or any of the NATO air forces, a more powerful proposal had attracted the interest of the French Navy. Accordingly, Dassault developed a navalised demonstrator, which made its first flight on 24 July 1956. Its performance having met with the service&#x27;s satisfaction, the French Navy ordered the type into production, receiving a total of 69 &quot;Étendard IVM&quot; fighters, in addition to 21 &quot;Étendard IVP&quot;, the latter being a specialised aerial reconnaissance variant.

The Étendard would serve as the basis for the more advanced Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard. During the 1970s, it had been intended to replace the Étendard IV with a navalised version of the SEPECAT Jaguar, designated as the &quot;Jaguar M&quot;. However, development of the Jaguar M was terminated and, shortly after, it was announced that the Super Étendard had been ordered in its place. For a time, the Étendard IV was operated alongside its improved model before being progressively withdrawn during the 1980s. In 1991, the fighter models of the type was finally retired from service by its sole operator, while the reconnaissance variant was withdrawn during 2000. 

==Development==
The Étendard has its origins in the early 1950s, with the experiences of combatants in the Korean War and the lessons derived from it subsequently. Two separate specifications were offered to French manufacturers: one for the French Air Force and the other for the numerous air forces of the multinational NATO alliance. In response, Dassault Aviation drew up a single basic design, with the intention that variants of it would satisfy both specifications. These variants were designated Étendard II and Étendard VI respectively; according to Dassault, these aircraft would have incorporated major advances in terms of high lift devices, which enabled lower take-off and landing speeds to be used. The Étendard II was evidently optimised for speed and payload, while the Étendard VI was a more lightweight variant, aimed at export markets. However, despite the building of a prototype for both variants, there was initially little interest on the part of both the French military and other potential buyers.
However, this lack of demand did not curtail Dassault&#x27;s ambitions. Early on, the company had decided to embark on the development of a larger and more powerful variant, which was originally designated as the &quot;Mystère XXIV&quot;, as a private venture in parallel to the issued specifications. The French Navy showed open interest in this prospective Mystère XXIV variant. Bolstered by this, Dassault proceeded with the construction of a single navalised prototype, features of which included new navigation and radar systems, folding wings, deck landing hooks, along with the reinforcement of the fuselage. Following a series of ground tests, its maiden flight occurred on 24 July 1956.

Meanwhile, the French Navy sought to acquire the Étendard, once tests had deemed it suitable as a carrier-based ground attack aircraft, along with a secondary, low-altitude interception role. As part of the trials process, a total of five pre-production aircraft were manufactured. Flight testing of the type revealed it to have favourable performance qualities, including a relatively high external load capacity. Having been sufficiently satisfied with this demonstration of the aircraft&#x27;s capabilities and performance attributes, the French Navy opted to procure a total of 69 &quot;Étendard IVM&quot; fighters and 21 &quot;Étendard IVP&quot; aerial reconnaissance aircraft.

The &quot;Jaguar M&quot;, a navalized variant of the Anglo-French SEPECAT Jaguar, was intended to be the Étendard&#x27;s replacement, but this effort was derailed by political lobbying on the part of Dassault, who instead favoured their own proposal, which was an advanced version of the Étendard. This model would go on to be ordered by the French Navy, with whom it would enter service as the Super Étendard. Eventually, the more capable Super Étendard would succeed the Étendard in service.

==Design==

The Étendard was a relatively lightweight navalised attack fighter. In service, it was often noted for its popularity with its pilots due to its high level of manoeuvrability. It featured a highly swept wing, which was furnished with double-slotted flaps and spoilers, as well as powered ailerons and leading-edge droop flaps. To take up less room onboard aircraft carriers when being stored, the wings of the Étendard were designed to be foldable. The type was powered by a single SNECMA Atar turbojet engine, which had also powered the French Air Force&#x27;s Dassault Mirage III. The engine&#x27;s configuration was broadly similar to that of the Mirage III&#x27;s powerplant, albeit with the exception of the removed afterburner. In flight, the Étendard was capable of attaining transonic speeds, being only able to exceed the speed of sound when in a dive.

The Étendard could be furnished with various equipment to carry out its mission roles, which included attack, photo-reconnaissance, and aerial refueling tanking. In addition to the standard dual 30mm DEFA cannon, various armaments and munitions could be carried on the four wing-mounted hardpoints, such as short range air-to-air missiles, air-to-surface missiles, rocket pods, bombs, and drop tanks. A retractable nose-mounted refueling probe was also fitted. Other optional equipment included a tactical air navigation system (TACAN) receiver and a drogue parachute, the latter of which could be used to assist braking during land operations. A compact Dassault-built Aida radar unit was installed within the aircraft&#x27;s nose, along with a compact infrared sensor, which could be used for guiding various munitions. Alongside the Aida radar unit, a Swedish-made SAAB bombing computer was added to increase accuracy. 

The aerial reconnaissance-orientated &quot;Étendard IVP&quot; was largely similar to the fighter model of the aircraft, but did have some key differences. An arrangement of five OMERA cameras was housed within the aircraft&#x27;s lengthy nose; furthermore, the ventral bay could also accommodate a number of long-focus cameras in lieu of the cannon armament. While a refuelling probe was also present on reconnaissance aircraft, this was non-retractable due to a lack of available space in the interior of the nose.

==Operational history==
During December 1961, the French Navy took delivery of their first Étendards. The following year, the type was deployed for the first time aboard both of the service&#x27;s newly built &quot;Clemenceau&quot;-class aircraft carriers, the &quot;Clemenceau&quot; and &quot;Foch&quot;. The Étendard IVM was in French Navy service for several decades, even following the development of the more capable Super Étendard. The type was gradually relegated to secondary missions in favour of the Super Étendard; as such, it was phased out from active combat roles during 1987.

The last examples of the fighter-orientated model were withdrawn during July 1991, the type&#x27;s final use having been with Squadron 59S, a ship-borne fighter school. Throughout its service life, the Étendard fleet had reportedly flown for a combined 180,000 flight hours, during which 25,300 landings had been conducted. The reconnaissance-focused Étendard IVP outlived its fighter cousin, having remained in active service until 27 July 2000. According to Dassault, by this point, the Étendard had reportedly carried out in excess of 200,000 flight hours.

<text>The Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard (&quot;Étendard&quot; is French for &quot;battle flag&quot;, cognate to English &quot;standard&quot;) is a French carrier-borne strike fighter aircraft designed by Dassault-Breguet for service with the French Navy.

The aircraft is an advanced development of the Étendard IVM, which it replaced. The Super Étendard first flew in October 1974 and entered French service in June 1978. French Super Étendards have served in several conflicts such as the Kosovo war, the war in Afghanistan and the military intervention in Libya.

The Super Étendard was also operated by Iraq (on a temporary lease) and Argentina, which both deployed the aircraft during wartime. Argentina&#x27;s Navy use of the Super Étendard and the Exocet missile during the 1982 Falklands War led to the aircraft gaining considerable popular recognition. The Super Étendard was used by Iraq to attack oil tankers and merchant shipping in the Persian Gulf during the Iraq-Iran War. In French service, the Super Étendard was replaced by the Dassault Rafale in 2016.

==Development==
The Super Étendard is a development of the earlier Étendard IVM which had been developed in the 1950s. The Étendard IVM was originally to have been replaced by a navalised version of the SEPECAT Jaguar, designated as the Jaguar M; however the Jaguar M project was stalled by a combination of political problems and issues experienced during trial deployments on board carriers. Specifically, the Jaguar M had suffered handling problems when being flown on a single engine and a poor throttle response time that made landing back on a carrier after an engine failure difficult. In 1973, all development work on the Jaguar M was formally cancelled by the French government.

There were several proposed aircraft to replace the Jaguar M, including the LTV A-7 Corsair II and the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk. Dassault pulled some strings with the French government and produced its own proposal to meet the requirement. According to Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, Dassault had played a significant role in the cancellation of the Jaguar M with the aim of creating a vacancy for their own proposal – the Super Étendard. The Super Étendard was essentially an improved version of the existing Étendard IVM, outfitted with a more powerful engine, a new wing and improved avionics. Dassault sold its plane as the only fully French-made candidate, and as cheaper than the other contestants, using modern technology already proven in existing Dassault planes. Dassault&#x27;s Super Étendard proposal was accepted by the French Navy in 1973, leading to a series of prototypes being quickly assembled.

The first of three prototypes to be built, an Étendard IVM which had been modified with the new engine and some of the new avionics, made its maiden flight on 28 October 1974. The original intention of the French Navy was to order a total of 100 Super Étendards, however the order placed was for 60 of the new model with options for a further 20; further budget cuts and an escalation in the aircraft&#x27;s per unit price eventually led to only 71 Super Étendards being purchased. Dassault began making deliveries of the type to the French Navy in June 1978.

In the first year of production, 15 Super Étendards were produced for the French Navy, allowing the formation of the first squadron in 1979. Dassault produced the aircraft at a rough rate of two per month.

The Argentine Navy was the only export customer. Argentina placed an order for 14 aircraft to meet their requirements for a capable new fighter that could operate from their sole aircraft carrier. In 1983, all manufacturing activity was completed, the last delivery to the French Navy taking place that year.

==Design==

The Super Étendard is a small, single-engined, mid-winged aircraft with an all-metal structure. Both the wings and tailplane are swept, with the folding wings having a sweepback of about 45 degrees, while the aircraft is powered by a non-afterburning SNECMA Atar 8K-50 turbojet with a rating of 49 kN (11,025 lbf). Its performance was not much better than the Étendard IV, but its avionics were significantly improved.

The main new weapon of the Super Étendard was the French anti-shipping missile, the Aérospatiale AM 39 Exocet. The aircraft had a Thomson-CSF Agave radar, an updated version of the Cyrano IV used on the Dassault Mirage F1, which, amongst other functions, was essential to launch the Exocet missile. One of the major technical advances of the Super Étendard was its onboard UAT-40 central computer; this managed most mission-critical systems, integrating navigational data and functions, radar information and display, and weapons targeting and controls.

In the 1990s, significant modifications and upgrades were made to the type, including an updated UAT-90 computer and a new Thomson-CSF Anemone radar which provided nearly double the range of the previous Agave radar. Other upgrades at this time included an extensively redesigned cockpit with HOTAS controls, and airframe life-extension work was undertaken; a total of 48 aircraft received these upgrades, at a rate of 15 per year. During the 2000s, further improvements included significantly improved self-defence ECM capability to better evade enemy detection and attacks, cockpit compatibility with night vision goggles, a new inertial data system partly integrating GPS, and compatibility with the Damocles Laser designator pod.

The Super Étendard could also deploy tactical nuclear weapons; initially these were unguided gravity bombs only, however, during the 1990s the Super Étendard was extensively upgraded, enabling the deployment of the Air-Sol Moyenne Portée, a ramjet-powered air-launched nuclear missile. The aircraft was also refitted with the ability to operate a range of laser-guided bombs and, to enable the type to replace the retiring Étendard IV in the reconnaissance mission, the Super Étendard was fitted to carry a specialist reconnaissance pod as well. However, the aircraft is unable to perform naval landings without jettisoning unexpended ordnance.

==Operational history==

===Argentina===
The Argentine Naval Aviation decided to buy 14 Super Étendards in 1979 after the United States put an arms embargo in place, due to the Dirty War and refused to supply spare parts for Argentina&#x27;s fleet of A-4Q Skyhawks. Between August and November 1981, five Super Étendards and five anti-ship sea-skimming Exocet missiles were shipped to Argentina. The Super Étendards, armed with Exocet anti-ship missiles played a key role in the Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom in 1982. The 2nd Naval Squadron was stationed at the Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego naval air base; during the conflict. The threat posed to British naval forces led to the planning of Operation Mikado and other proposed infiltration missions to raid the airbase, aiming to destroy the Super Étendards to prevent their use. A total of four Super Étendards were operational during the conflict.

A first attempt to attack the British fleet was made on 2 May 1982, but this was abandoned due to in-flight-refuelling problems. On 4 May, two Super Étendards, guided by a Lockheed P-2H Neptune, each launched one Exocet at the British destroyer , with one missile crippling &quot;Sheffield&quot;. On 25 May, another attack by two Super Étendards resulted in two missiles hitting the merchant ship , which was carrying several helicopters and other supplies to the front line. The Exocets that struck &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; had been inadvertently redirected by decoy chaff deployed as a defensive measure by other ships; Both &quot;Sheffield&quot; and &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; sank whilst under tow some days later following these Exocet strikes.

On May 30 two Super Étendards, one carrying Argentina&#x27;s last remaining Exocet, escorted by four A-4C Skyhawks each with 3 500lb bombs, took off to attack the carrier HMS Invincible. 

Following the end of the conflict, by 1984 Argentina had received all the 14 Super Étendards ordered, and Exocets with which to arm them. Super Étendards performed qualifications on the aircraft carrier ARA &quot;25 de Mayo&quot; until the ship&#x27;s final retirement. Since 1993, Argentine pilots have practised on board the neighbouring Brazilian Navy&#x27;s aircraft carrier . Touch-and-go landing exercises were also common on US Navy carriers during Gringo-Gaucho manoeuvres and joint exercises.

In 2009, an agreement was signed between Argentina and France to upgrade Argentina&#x27;s remaining fleet of Super Étendards. An earlier proposal to acquire former French Naval Super Étendards was rejected due to high levels of accumulated flight hours; instead equipment and hardware would be removed from retiring French airframes and installed into Argentine aircraft, effectively upgrading them to the Super Étendard Modernisé (SEM) standard. By March 2014, while the Argentine Navy continued to seek the upgrade kits for 10 of its 11 remaining Super Étendards; this ambition appears to have been complicated by several factors, France has been non-committal regarding the sought sale; critically, political developments between France and the UK may potentially allow the UK to obstruct the supply of military equipment to Argentina such as the upgrade kits and the Exocet missile.

In 2017 five Super Étendard Modernisé were purchased from France to bolster the fleet at a cost of €12.5 million, along with a simulator, eight spare engines, and a large batch of spares and tooling. However, while these aircraft were delivered in 2019, in 2020 they were still awaiting the delivery of key spare parts and it was announced that they may not be in operational service for a further two years. In 2021, it was reported that the aircraft also remained non-operational due to problems obtaining components for the Martin Baker ejection seats manufactured in the U.K.. As a result, alternative parts were being sought in the United States. In early 2022, it was reported that the spare parts problem remained unresolved and the aircraft remained in storage. On 17 May 2023, on the occasion of the 209th anniversary of the Argentine Navy, Argentinean Minister of Defense Jorge Taiana, announced the withdrawal from service of all the Super Étendards of the Aviación Naval Argentina.

===France===
Deliveries of the Super Étendard to the French Navy started in 1978, with the first squadron, &quot;Flottille 11F&quot; becoming operational in February 1979. As they offered no air combat capabilities France had to extend useful life of its Crusaders fighters, as no replacement option was found.

In total, three operational squadrons and a training unit were equipped with the Super Étendard. The Super Étendards would operate from both of France&#x27;s aircraft carriers at that time, and ; either carrier&#x27;s air wing typically comprised 16 Super Étendards, 10 F-8 Crusaders, 3 Étendard IVPs, 7 Breguet Alizé anti-submarine aircraft, as well as numerous helicopters.

The first fighting operational missions took place in Lebanon during Operation Olifant. On 22 September 1983, French Navy Super Étendards operating from &quot;Foch&quot; bombed and destroyed Syrian forces positions after a few artillery rounds were fired at the French peace keepers. On November 10, a Super Étendard dodged a Syrian SA-7 shoulder-launched missile near Bourj el-Barajneh while flying over Druze positions. On 17 November 1983, the same airplanes attacked and destroyed an Islamic Amal training camp in Baalbeck after a terrorist attack on French paratroopers in Beirut.

From 1991, the original pure attack Étendard IVMs were withdrawn from French service; though the reconnaissance version of the Étendard IV, the IVP, remained in service until July 2000. In response, the Super Étendards underwent a series of upgrades throughout the 1990s to add new capabilities and update existing systems for use in the modern battlefield. Designated &quot;Super Étendard Modernisé&quot; (SEM), the first combat missions for the type came during NATO&#x27;s &quot;Allied Force&quot; operations over Serbia in 1999 flying 400 combat missions. An Étendard IVPM from the Flottile 16.F was hit by a Serb SAM on 15 April 1994, while flying a reconnaissance mission over Gorazde, Bosnia, as part of Operation Deny Flight. The pilot managed to safely land on &quot;Clemenceau&quot; despite heavy damage on its tailpipe, elevators and fin.

The SEM also flew strike missions in Operation Enduring Freedom. &quot;Mission Héraclès&quot; starting 21 November 2001 saw the deployment of the aircraft carrier and its Super Étendards in Afghanistan. Operation Anaconda, starting on 2 March 2002 saw extensive use of the Super Étendard in support of French and allied ground troops. Super Étendards returned to operations over Afghanistan in 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010–2011. One of their main roles was to carry laser designation pods to illuminate targets for Dassault Rafales.

In March 2011, Étendards were deployed as a part of Task Force 473, during France&#x27;s Opération Harmattan in support of UN resolution 1973 during the Libyan conflict. They were paired again with Dassault Rafales on interdiction missions. The final Super Étendards in French naval aviation were in one &quot;flottille&quot; (squadron) called flottille 17F. All Super Étendards were retired from French service on 12 July 2016 to be replaced by the Dassault Rafale M, 42 years after the subsonic attack jet performed its first flight. The Super Étendard&#x27;s last operational deployment from &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; was in support of Opération Chammal against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, which began in late 2015. On 16 March 2016, the aircraft undertook its final launch from &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; ahead of its final withdrawal from service in July.

===Iraq===
A total of five Super Étendards were loaned to Iraq in 1983 while the country was waiting for deliveries of Agave-equipped Dassault Mirage F1s capable of launching Exocet missiles that had been ordered; the first of these aircraft arrived in Iraq on 8 October 1983. The provision of Super Étendards to Iraq was politically controversial, the United States and Iraq&#x27;s neighbour Iran were vocal in their opposition while Saudi Arabia supported the loan; the aircraft were seen as an influential factor in the 1980–88 Iraq-Iran War as they could launch Exocet strikes on Iranian merchant shipping traversing the Persian Gulf. The Super Étendards began maritime operations over Persian Gulf in March 1984; a total of 34 attacks were carried out on Iranian shipping through the rest of 1984. Tankers of any nationality that were carrying Iranian crude oil were also subject to Iraqi attacks.

Iraq typically deployed the Super Étendards in pairs, escorted by Mirage F1 fighters from bases in Southern Iraq; once inside the mission zone, the Super Étendards would search for targets using their onboard radar and engage suspected tankers at long range without visual identification. While tankers would typically be struck by a launched Exocet, they were often only lightly damaged. On 2 April 1984, an Iraqi Super Étendard was reportedly shot down by a AIM-7E-2 missile fired by an Iranian F-4 Phantom II piloted by Khosrow Adibi over Kharg Island. Separately, on 26 July and 7 August 1984, claims of Super Étendard losses to Iranian Grumman F-14 Tomcats were reported. Iran claimed a total of three Super Étendards to have been shot down by Iranian interceptors; France stated that four of the five leased aircraft were returned to France in 1985.

==Operators==

===Potential operators===
* Ukrainian Air Force. Speculation suggests Argentina had offered to transfer the 5 jets it had previously bought back to France for overhaul and eventual donation to Ukraine in exchange for drones or helicopters.

===Former operators===
;:
* Argentine Navy originally received 14 aircraft, of which few are currently operational. A further 5 ex-French navy aircraft (Modernisé spec) were acquired for operational service and training/spare parts in 2017; these aircraft remain non-operational as of 2021. On 17 May 2023, the final withdrawal from service of all the Super Étendards of the Aviación Naval Argentina was announced. In June 2024, The Argentine government is discussing with France to send five of these aircraft to Ukraine.
* French Navy received 71 aircraft; retired from active service on 12 July 2016.
* Iraqi Air Force was loaned five French aircraft between 1983 and 1985; one was lost during the Iran–Iraq War, the remainder returned to France in 1985.

The fractional part of logarithms, specifically, is also known as the [[Fractional part|mantissa]]; by contrast with the mantissa, the integral part of a logarithm is called its &quot;characteristic&quot;. The word &quot;mantissa&quot; was introduced by Henry Briggs.

For a positive number written in a conventional positional numeral system (such as binary or decimal), its fractional part hence corresponds to the digits appearing after the radix point, such as the decimal point in English. The result is a real number in the half-open interval [0, 1).

==For negative numbers==
However, in case of negative numbers, there are various conflicting ways to extend the fractional part function to them: It is either defined in the same way as for positive numbers, i.e., by formula_4 , or as the part of the number to the right of the radix point formula_5 , or by the odd function:

:formula_6

with formula_7 as the smallest integer not less than , also called the ceiling of . By consequence, we may get, for example, three different values for the fractional part of just one : let it be −1.3, its fractional part will be 0.7 according to the first definition, 0.3 according to the second definition, and −0.3 according to the third definition, whose result can also be obtained in a straightforward way by
:formula_8.

The formula_9 and the &quot;odd function&quot; definitions permit for unique decomposition of any real number to the sum of its integer and fractional parts, where &quot;integer part&quot; refers to formula_10 or formula_11 respectively. These two definitions of fractional-part function also provide idempotence.

The fractional part defined via difference from ⌊ ⌋ is usually denoted by curly braces:
:formula_12
==Relation to continued fractions==
Every real number can be essentially uniquely represented as a simple continued fraction, namely as the sum of its integer part and the reciprocal of its fractional part which is written as the sum of &quot;its&quot; integer part and the reciprocal of &quot;its&quot; fractional part, and so on.

<text>In the Catholic Church, the Council of Siena (1423–1424) marked a somewhat inconclusive stage in the Conciliar movement that was attempting reforms in the Church. If it had continued, it would have qualified as an ecumenical council. In the official List of ecumenical councils, the Council of Siena is no longer listed, as the conciliarism expressed there was later branded as a heresy. 

==History==
According to the terms of the Council of Constance calling for periodic ecumenical councils to discuss church policies, Pope Martin V convened a council at Pavia, which was hardly inaugurated on 23 April 1423, when plague broke out at Pavia and the council was hastily adjourned to Siena.

At Siena, the procedure of the Council followed that established at Constance. Right at the start, certain formalities of the safe conducts issued by the city for the members of the Council were the cause of jurisdictional friction with papal prerogatives. Attendance to the Council was sparse, specially for high ranking prelates from transalpine regions; at the opening session of November 6, the Council only counted with two cardinals and twenty-five mitred prelates (bishops), as representatives of the higher clergy. Nevertheless, on the eighth of November four decrees were published, all of them directed against easy targets: against the followers of the heretical reformers, Jan Hus, recently burnt at the stake at the Council of Constance despite a promise of safe conduct, and against the English followers of John Wycliffe, who claimed that the highest authority was the Bible; against the followers of the schismatic Antipope Benedict XIII; a decree postponing the negotiations with the Greeks and other Eastern Orthodox churches (which were later worked into acceptable compromises in the long working sessions of the Council of Florence, 1438 to 1445); and a decree advising greater vigilance against heresy, the easiest target of all. 

The formal proceedings of the council were held in the Cathedral of Siena, while the sessions that did not require a liturgical celebration were held in its sacristy. 

Proposals for genuine institutional reform within the Catholic Church hung fire ominously. French proposals for more local control (&quot;Gallican&quot; proposals, generally speaking) produced resistance from the loyalists of the Papal Curia. Nothing was accomplished at Siena in that area.

On 19 February 1424, Basel was selected as the place of the next Council and the Council dissolved itself the following day (the decree published 7 March). The French members would have preferred to continue the Council until a thorough reform of the church had been accomplished, both &quot;in capite et in membris&quot; (&quot;in its head and its members&quot;), but whether in order to avoid a new schism, or whether on account of fear of the Pope (since Siena in southern Tuscany was near the Papal States), they departed. The selection of the venue for the next council, far from the armed temporal authority of the Papacy, is significant. 

The magistrates of Siena took care not to let anyone depart until he had paid his debts.

<text>The Ministry of Intelligence of the Islamic Republic of Iran (), also known as the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), is the primary intelligence agency of the Islamic Republic of Iran and a member of the Iran Intelligence Community. It is also known as VAJA and previously as VEVAK (&quot;Vezarat-e Ettela&#x27;at va Amniyat-e Keshvar&quot;). It was initially known as SAVAMA, after it took over the Shah&#x27;s intelligence apparatus SAVAK. The ministry is one of the three &quot;sovereign&quot; ministerial bodies of Iran due to nature of its work at home and abroad.

==History==
Reliable and valid information on the ministry is often difficult to obtain. Initially, the organization was known as SAVAMA, and intended to replace SAVAK, Iran&#x27;s intelligence agency during the rule of the Shah, but it is unclear how much continuity there is between the two organizations—while their role is similar, their underlying ideology is radically different. It is suspected that the new government was initially eager to purge SAVAK elements from the new organization, but that pragmatism eventually prevailed, with many experienced SAVAK personnel being retained in their roles. Former SAVAK staff are believed to have been important in the ministry&#x27;s infiltration of left-wing dissident groups and of the Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath Party.

The formation of the ministry was proposed by Saeed Hajjarian to the government of Mir-Hossein Mousavi and then the parliament. There were debates about which branch of the state should oversee the new institution, and the other options apart from the presidency were the Judiciary system, the Supreme Leader, and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Finally, the government got the approval of Ayatollah Khomeini to make it a ministry, but a restriction was added to the requirements of the minister: that he must be a doctor of Islam.

The ministry was finally founded on 18 August 1983, either abandoning, silently subsuming, or relegating to hidden existence many small intelligence agencies that had been formed in different governmental organizations. The five ministers since the founding of the ministry, have been Mohammad Reyshahri (under Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi), Ali Fallahian (under President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani), Ghorbanali Dorri-Najafabadi (under President Mohammad Khatami, resigned after a year), Ali Younessi (under President Khatami, until 24 August 2005), Gholam Hossein Mohseni-Ejehei (under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, from 24 August 2005 to 24 August 2009) and Heyder Moslehi (under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, from 29 August 2009 to 15 August 2013).

===&quot;Chain&quot; assassinations===
In late 1998, three dissident writers, a political leader and his wife were killed in Iran in the span of two months.

After great public outcry and journalistic investigation in Iran and publicity internationally, prosecutors announced in mid-1999 that one Saeed Emami had led &quot;rogue elements&quot; in Iran&#x27;s intelligence ministry in the killings, but that Emami was now dead, having committed suicide in prison. In a trial that was &quot;dismissed as a sham by the victims&#x27; families and international human rights organisations&quot;, three intelligence ministry agents were sentenced in 2001 to death and twelve others to prison terms for murdering two of the victims. Two years later, the Iranian Supreme Court reduced two of the death sentences to life.

=== Foreign executions===
Massoud Molavi Verdanjani, an online opposition activist, was shot and killed on a street in Istanbul&#x27;s Şişli neighborhood on Thursday, 14 November 2019. A Turkish security official later claimed Verdanjani&#x27;s suspected killer had confessed to acting under the orders of two Iranian intelligence officers at the Iranian consulate in Turkey.

On 20 April 2022, According to a statement issued by the semi-official Fars news agency, Iran&#x27;s intelligence ministry stated it had captured three Mossad spies.

==Financials==
The ministry received a ten fold increase in fundings in 2024.

<text>Robert Evans (born Robert J. Shapera; June 29, 1930 – October 26, 2019) was an American film producer who worked on &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1968), &quot;Love Story&quot; (1970), &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972), and &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974).

Evans began his career in a successful business venture with his brother
Charles Evans, selling women&#x27;s apparel. In 1956, while on a business trip, he was by chance spotted by actress Norma Shearer, who thought he would be right to play the role of her late husband Irving Thalberg in &quot;Man of a Thousand Faces&quot; (1957). Thus he began a brief film acting career. In 1962, Evans went into film producing instead, using his accumulated wealth from the clothing business, and began a meteoric rise in the industry. He was made head of Paramount Pictures in 1967. While there, he improved the ailing Paramount&#x27;s fortunes through a string of commercially and critically acclaimed films. In 1974, he stepped down to produce films on his own.
In 1980, Evans&#x27;s career, and life, took a downturn after he pled guilty to cocaine trafficking. Over the next 12 years, he produced only two films, both financial flops: &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984) and the &quot;Chinatown&quot; sequel &quot;The Two Jakes&quot; (1990). In 1993, he produced films on a more regular basis, with a mixed track record that included both flops (such as &quot;Jade&quot; in 1995) and hits (such as &quot;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&quot; in 2003, his final film credit).

==Early life and acting career==
Evans was born in New York City, New York, the son of Florence (née Krasne), a housewife who came from a wealthy family, and Archie Shapera, a dentist in Harlem. He described both of his parents as &quot;second-generation Jews&quot;. He grew up on New York City&#x27;s Upper West Side during the 1930s, where he was better off than most people living during the Great Depression. In his early years, he did promotional work for Evan-Picone, a fashion company founded by his brother Charles. After high school, he did a variety of voice work on radio. With a clear, deep voice as a teenager and a knack for foreign accents, by his estimation he performed in more than 300 radio shows before he turned 18. This included a leading role on &quot;The Aldrich Family&quot; situation comedy.

He was spotted by actress Norma Shearer next to the pool at The Beverly Hills Hotel on November 6, 1956. She successfully touted him for the role of her late husband Irving Thalberg in &quot;Man of a Thousand Faces&quot;. The same year, Evans also caught the eye of Darryl F. Zanuck, who cast him as Pedro Romero in the 1957 film adaptation of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;, against the wishes of co-star Ava Gardner and Hemingway himself. In 1959, he appeared in Twentieth Century-Fox&#x27;s production of &quot;The Best of Everything&quot; with Hope Lange, Diane Baker and Joan Crawford.

==Career as producer==

Dissatisfied with his own acting talent, he was determined to become a producer. He got his start by purchasing the rights to a 1966 novel titled &quot;The Detective&quot; which Evans made into a movie starring Frank Sinatra, Lee Remick, Jack Klugman, Robert Duvall and Jacqueline Bisset, in 1968. Peter Bart, a writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote an article about Evans&#x27;s aggressive production style. This got Evans noticed by Charles Bluhdorn, who was head of the Gulf+Western conglomerate which owned Paramount, and hired Evans as production vice-president in 1966 as part of a shakeup at Paramount Pictures (which included Bart, whom Evans would recruit as a Paramount executive).

When Evans took over as head of production for Paramount, the floundering studio was the ninth largest. Despite his inexperience, Evans was able to turn the studio around. He made Paramount the most successful studio in Hollywood and transformed it into a profitable enterprise for Gulf+Western. During his tenure at Paramount, the studio turned out films such as &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot;, &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, &quot;The Italian Job&quot;, &quot;True Grit&quot;, &quot;Love Story&quot;, &quot;Harold and Maude&quot;, &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;, &quot;Serpico&quot;, &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot;, &quot;Save the Tiger&quot;, &quot;The Conversation&quot;, &quot;Chinatown&quot;, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, and many others.

Dissatisfied with his financial compensation and desiring to produce films under his own banner, Evans struck a deal with Paramount in 1972 that enabled him to stay on as executive vice president of worldwide production while also working as an independent producer on five films. Other producers at Paramount felt this gave Evans an unfair advantage. After the huge critical and commercial success of the Evans-produced &quot;Chinatown&quot;, he stepped down as production chief, which enabled him to produce films on his own. From 1976 to 1980, working as an independent producer, he continued his streak of successful films with &quot;Marathon Man&quot;, &quot;Black Sunday&quot;, &quot;Popeye&quot; and &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;. After 1980, his film output became both more infrequent and less critically acclaimed. He produced only two films over the next twelve years: &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; and &quot;The Two Jakes&quot;. From 1993 to 2003 he produced the films &quot;Sliver&quot;, &quot;Jade&quot;, &quot;The Phantom&quot;, &quot;The Saint&quot;, and &quot;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&quot;.

Evans produced and provided the voice for his eponymous character in the 2003 animated series &quot;Kid Notorious&quot;. In 2004 Evans hosted a Sirius Satellite Radio show, &quot;In Bed with Robert Evans&quot;. In 2009, Evans was in talks to produce a film about auto executive John DeLorean, as well as an HBO miniseries titled &quot;The Devil and Sidney Korshak&quot;. Neither project came to fruition.

In July 2019 Paramount did not renew its contract with Robert Evans Productions, which had been in place since 1974 after Evans stepped down from running the studio. Evans had a staff of three and had been working from his Woodland estate in Beverly Hills because of poor health.

===Cotton Club murder===
In the early 1980s, Evans was introduced to theatrical impresario Roy Radin, a producer of traveling musical and comedy revues, by cocaine dealer Karen Greenberger (aka Lanie Jacobs). Radin was trying to break into the film industry with a movie about the legendary New York nightclub, the Cotton Club. The deal arranged on the film &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; mandated that Evans and Radin establish a production company in which each would own 45% of the film with the remaining 10% split between two other parties. Radin offered Greenberger (aka Jacobs) a $50,000 finder&#x27;s fee for her efforts, which she found unsatisfactory.

As &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; film financing was being arranged, the 33-year-old Radin was murdered in 1983. Contract killer William Mentzer was among four people sentenced for shooting Radin multiple times in the head and using dynamite to make identification by authorities more challenging. At the trial, Greenberger was convicted of second-degree murder and kidnapping. Her involvement was said to be over a fear of being cut out of a producer&#x27;s role and potential profits from the film. As a result, the trial was dubbed the &quot;Cotton Club&quot; murder trial.

Heeding the advice of his attorney Robert Shapiro, Evans refused to testify during a May 1989 preliminary hearing, invoking the Fifth Amendment to avoid incriminating himself. Police reports that had been submitted to obtain search warrants indicated at least two witnesses said Evans was involved in the Radin murder.

Greenberger testified during her 1991 trial that Evans was not involved in the murder. She also claimed during her trial that she had been Evans&#x27;s lover.

==Cocaine trafficking==

Evans was convicted of cocaine trafficking in 1980. He entered a guilty plea to a misdemeanor in federal court after being arrested for engineering a large cocaine buy with his brother Charles. As part of his plea bargain, he filmed an anti-drug TV commercial. The alleged drug dealing, which Evans continued to deny (the misdemeanor was later wiped from his record), came out of his own involvement with the drug. He told the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; in a 1994 interview, &quot;Bob &#x27;Cocaine&#x27; Evans is how I&#x27;ll be known to my grave&quot;. He argues that he never should have been convicted of federal selling and distribution charges, as he was only a user.

==Personal life==

Evans married seven times. He first married Sharon Hugueny in 1961, staying with her until 1962. Subsequently, he married Camilla Sparv (1964–1967), Ali MacGraw (1969–1973), Phyllis George (1977–1978), Catherine Oxenberg (1998), Leslie Ann Woodward (2002–2004), and Victoria White (2005–2006). Evans&#x27;s marriage to Oxenberg was annulled after nine days. He married his seventh wife, Victoria White O&#x27;Gara (widow of Lord White), while in Mexico, in August 2005 shortly after his 75th birthday. She filed for divorce on June 16, 2006, citing irreconcilable differences.

Evans had one child, Josh Evans, from his marriage to MacGraw. Josh is a film producer.

Evans&#x27;s brother Charles Evans (1926–2007) was a businessman involved in clothing, real estate, promoting fire detectors and was also an occasional film producer (&quot;Tootsie&quot;, 1982, &quot;Monkey Shines&quot;, 1988 and &quot;Showgirls&quot;, 1995). His nephew is broadcast journalist Michael Shure. Another nephew is Charles Evans, Jr. a documentary producer. His sister, Alice Shure, who was associate producer on &quot;Without a Trace&quot; (1983), has produced other films, and founded documentary film production companies.

=== Health and death ===
On May 6, 1998, during a dinner party in honor of director Wes Craven, Evans suffered a stroke while giving a toast, and was rushed to nearby Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Evans flatlined in the ambulance, but was resuscitated. Suffering a series of three strokes in quick succession, he was left paralyzed on his right side and completely unable to speak. During his hospital stay, he was encouraged by media mogul and friend Sumner Redstone, who stayed at his bedside, to work on his speech and recovery. A few days after Evans&#x27;s stroke, Frank Sinatra died from a heart attack in one of the adjoining rooms at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Witnessing his body being taken away, Evans said it was an event that furthered his desire to recover.

Evans eventually regained his ability to talk and returned to producing. From 2013, he relied on a cane for shorter walks and had limited mobility.

Evans died in Beverly Hills, California on October 26, 2019, at the age of 89.

==In popular culture==
*Orson Welles&#x27; final film, &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot; (filmed 1970–1976 and released in 2018), a satire of 1970s Hollywood, has a young studio boss, &quot;Max David&quot;, played by Geoffrey Land, who Welles admitted was a spoof of Evans.
*The character David Blackman in Blake Edwards&#x27; 1981 film &quot;S.O.B.&quot;, played by Robert Vaughn, is based on Evans.
*Evans felt that Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s portrayal of Mumbles, a mobster, in the 1990 film &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, was based on Evans&#x27;s speaking style.
*In the 1997 film &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;, a Washington, D.C., spin doctor distracts the US electorate from a presidential sex scandal by hiring a Hollywood producer, again played by Hoffman, whose character was an open parody of Evans. Hoffman emulated Evans&#x27;s work habits, mannerisms, quirks, clothing style, hairstyle, and his large square-framed eyeglasses. The real Evans is said to have declared, &quot;I&#x27;m magnificent in this film!&quot;
*The character Bob Ryan, portrayed by Martin Landau in the HBO series &quot;Entourage&quot;, who was a successful movie producer in the 1970s and now chafes at no longer being considered a major Hollywood player, was thought by some (including Evans himself) to be based on Evans. However, series creator Doug Ellin denied this, saying that he wrote the part based on someone he met while making &quot;Kissing a Fool&quot;, not on Evans. Nevertheless, Evans reportedly received an offer to play the part himself (which he declined), and his house was used in the show as Bob Ryan&#x27;s home.
*Evans served as the inspiration for a &quot;Mr. Show&quot; sketch in which Bob Odenkirk portrays God recording his memoirs, dressed as and speaking like Evans. Odenkirk also attributes Evans as his primary influence on his portrayal of lawyer Saul Goodman in &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;.
*Joe Eszterhas in his book, &quot;Hollywood Animal&quot;, writes that &quot;all lies ever told anywhere about Robert Evans are true.&quot; His autobiography also goes into detail about a cocaine addiction that plagued Evans in the 1980s.
*Evans played himself in the film &quot;An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn&quot; (1998).
*Evans voiced a fictionalized caricature of himself in the animated series, &quot;Kid Notorious&quot;, alongside his real-life butler, Alan &quot;English&quot; Selka, and next-door neighbor, former Guns N&#x27; Roses lead guitarist Saul &quot;Slash&quot; Hudson.
*Evans appears in the 2005 Bruce Campbell novel &quot;Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way&quot;, with Campbell impersonating him to infiltrate the Paramount Studios lot.
*In 2010, Smuggler Films acquired the stage rights to Evans&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;The Kid Stays in the Picture&quot;, and its sequel, &quot;The Fat Lady Sang&quot; (which was published in 2013). The play was to be written by Jon Robin Baitz. No further information has been released on the production.
*Bill Hader played a character inspired by Evans in the two-part season two finale of &quot;Documentary Now!&quot; that parodies &quot;The Kid Stays in the Picture&quot;.
*Michael Douglas played a character that parodies Evans in the 2009 romantic comedy &quot;Ghosts of Girlfriends Past&quot;.
*Matthew Goode portrays Evans in the 2022 Paramount+ miniseries &quot;The Offer&quot; which dramatizes the making of &quot;The Godfather&quot;.
*In &quot;The Boys&quot;, Paul Reiser plays a retired producer based on Robert Evans.

<text>Digital Anvil, Inc. (formerly Digital Anvil Holdings, Inc.) was an American video game developer based in Austin, Texas owned by Microsoft Game Studios (MGS). It was founded in 1996 by brothers Chris and Erin Roberts along with Tony Zurovec, Marten Davies, Craig Cox, John Miles, Eric Peterson and Robert Rodriguez, creators of the &quot;Wing Commander&quot; franchise from Origin Systems.

Davies held the position of president of the studio from its founding until February 2000, when his departure was announced. In June 2000, Microsoft started talks to buy Digital Anvil. Roberts admitted that his team required large sums of money, which only a huge company could provide. The acquisition of Digital Anvil by MGS was completed in December of that same year.

== History ==
Digital Anvil was founded in 1996 by Chris Roberts, Erin Roberts, Tony Zurovec, Marten Davies, Craig Cox, John Miles, Eric Peterson, and Robert Rodriguez. The name derived from the team&#x27;s idea to provide &quot;hard work and high tech&quot;. Digital Anvil offered profit-related pay to encourage creative drive and give employees a sense of ownership in the company.

Digital Anvil was purchased by Microsoft on December 5, 2000. One of the consequences of Digital Anvil&#x27;s purchase was a reshuffling of titles being developed. &quot;&quot; and &quot;Loose Cannon&quot; were dropped by the company, eventually being picked up by Ubisoft. &quot;Conquest&quot; was released in 2001. Many of the Digital Anvil staff working on &quot;Loose Cannon&quot; were reassigned to the company&#x27;s flagship &quot;Freelancer&quot;. &quot;Brute Force&quot; (still unannounced at the time) was switched from a computer game to an Xbox exclusive. Of all the projects being produced, only &quot;Freelancer&quot; escaped major change. Co-founder Chris Roberts left the company after the Microsoft takeover, but he still worked as a consultant on &quot;Freelancer&quot;. Digital Anvil also worked on the visual effects of the 1999 film &quot;Wing Commander&quot;.

For the next year, Digital Anvil was mostly silent, and many wondered whether any games from the company would see the light of day. Then, in 2001, Digital Anvil revealed a lighter &quot;Freelancer&quot; to the press. Although some of the more ambitious elements were dropped, this act proved &quot;Freelancer&quot; was not vaporware. In March 2003, &quot;Freelancer&quot; was released and immediately became one of the month&#x27;s top-selling games. In May of the same year, Digital Anvil released &quot;Brute Force&quot; for the Xbox. The game also did quite well, setting first-month sales records for Xbox games. In November 2005, Microsoft redeployed the developer&#x27;s employees to its Microsoft Studios headquarters. Digital Anvil was officially dissolved on January 31, 2006.

Hartman, the studio head of Digital Anvil at the time of its closure, was moved from Austin to Redmond as head of Turn 10 Studios, authors of the &quot;Forza Motorsport&quot; franchise.

<doc id="501544" wikidata="Q361932" url="?curid=501544" title="William Shepherd">
<text>William McMichael &quot;Bill&quot; Shepherd (born July 26, 1949), (Capt, USN, Ret.), is an American former Navy SEAL, aerospace, ocean, and mechanical engineer, and NASA astronaut, who served as commander of Expedition 1, the first crew on the International Space Station. He is a recipient of the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.

==Education and training==
Shepherd was born on July 26, 1949, to George R. Shepherd and Barbara Shepherd in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, but he considers Babylon, New York, his hometown. He is married to Beth Stringham of Batavia, New York. He graduated from Arcadia High School in Phoenix, Arizona in 1967, and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland in 1971. He completed Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training in 1972, then joined the United States Naval Special Warfare Command and qualified as a Navy SEAL. He served with the Navy&#x27;s Underwater Demolition Team ELEVEN, SEAL Teams ONE and TWO, and Special Boat Unit TWENTY. He obtained an Engineer&#x27;s degree in Ocean Engineering and a Master of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering, both in 1978, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

==NASA career==


After Shepherd was selected for NASA Astronaut Group 10 in 1984, rumors spread that he had answered a standard interview question about what he did best by saying, &quot;kill people with knives&quot; but he later refused to confirm or deny the account, commenting &quot;it&#x27;s too good a story&quot;. He was the first military non-aviator in astronaut training, following his unsuccessful application for NASA Astronaut Group 9 in 1980. In 1986, Shepherd&#x27;s Navy SEAL training proved unexpectedly useful to NASA as he helped to direct the underwater salvage operations of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; after its destruction. Shepherd then served as a mission specialist on three Space Shuttle flights: mission STS-27 in 1988, mission STS-41 in 1990, which deployed the &quot;Ulysses&quot; probe, and mission STS-52 in 1992. He was the first member of NASA Astronaut Group 10 to fly a space mission.

From March 1993 to January 1996, he was assigned to the International Space Station Program, serving as Program Manager and Deputy Program Manager. In November 1995 he was selected to command the first crew of the International Space Station (ISS). The mission was supposed to launch in 1997, but a long series of political, financial, and technical problems caused significant delays. Although sixteen nations would participate in the ISS program, Russia, along with the United States would bear the majority of the station&#x27;s costs.

===Spaceflight experience===
STS-27: &quot;Atlantis&quot; (December 2–6, 1988) Shepherd served with his crewmates on a mission that lasted 105 hours and carried Department of Defense payloads. The mission is noteworthy due to the severe damage &quot;Atlantis&quot; sustained to its critical heat-resistant tiles during ascent.

STS-41: &quot;Discovery&quot; (October 6–10, 1990) during 66 orbits of the Earth, the crew aboard the Orbiter successfully deployed the &quot;Ulysses&quot;, starting it on a four-year journey (via Jupiter) to investigate the polar regions of the Sun.

STS-52: &quot;Columbia&quot; (October 22 to November 1, 1992) was the 10-day mission deployed the Laser Geodynamic Satellite (LAGEOS), and conducted U.S. microgravity payload experiments.

Expedition 1: From October 31, 2000, to March 21, 2001, he and Russian cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergey Krikalev launched from Baikonur on Soyuz TM 31 and served as Expedition 1, the first crew on board ISS. The crew returned to Earth on the Space Shuttle Discovery, STS 102.

Shepherd has logged over 159 days in space.

==Post-NASA career==
Shepherd was next assigned to the staff of Commander, Naval Special Warfare Command, to assist with the development of new capabilities and programs for the Navy&#x27;s SEAL and Special Boat units. He retired from the U.S. Navy in January 2002. CAPT Shepherd also served as U.S. Special Operations Command&#x27;s first Science Advisor from 2008–2011.

<text>The flame robin (Petroica phoenicea) is a small passerine bird native to Australia. It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including Tasmania. Like the other two red-breasted &quot;Petroica&quot; robins—the scarlet robin and the red-capped robin—it is often simply called the &quot;robin redbreast&quot;. Like many brightly coloured robins of the Petroicidae, it is sexually dimorphic. Measuring long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. Female coloration is a muted grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.

The position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the European or American robins, but appear to be an early offshoot of the Passerida group of songbirds. The flame robin is predominantly insectivorous, pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A territorial bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. It is classified by BirdLife International as least concern.

==Taxonomy==
The flame robin was first described by the French naturalists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1830 as &quot;Muscicapa chrysoptera&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;chrysoptera&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek words &#x27;golden&#x27;, and &#x27;feather&#x27;.

John Gould placed the flame robin in its current genus as &quot;Petroica phoenicea&quot; in his 1837 description, and it was this latter binomial name that has been used since that time. Given this, Quoy and Gaimard&#x27;s name was declared a &quot;nomen oblitum&quot;. The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek words , &#x27;rock&#x27;, and , &#x27;home&#x27;, from the birds&#x27; habit of sitting on rocks. The specific epithet is also derived from Ancient Greek, from the adjective &#x27;crimson, dark red&#x27;. It is one of five red- or pink-breasted species colloquially known as &quot;red robins&quot;, as distinct from the &quot;yellow robins&quot; of the genus &quot;Eopsaltria&quot;. Although named after the European robin, the flame robin is not closely related to either it or the American robin. The Australian robins were placed in the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae, and the whistler family Pachycephalidae, before being classified in their own family Petroicidae. Sibley and Ahlquist&#x27;s DNA-DNA hybridisation studies placed the robins in a Corvida parvorder comprising many tropical and Australian passerines, including pardalotes, fairy-wrens and honeyeaters, as well as crows. However, subsequent molecular research (and current consensus) places the robins as a very early offshoot of the Passerida, or &quot;advanced&quot; songbirds, within the songbird lineage.

No subspecies are recognised, and the degree of geographic variation is unclear. Adult male birds which breed on the mainland have been reported as having lighter upperparts and underparts than their Tasmanian relatives, and females are said to be browner, but these differences may also result from worn plumage. Furthermore, migration across the Bass Strait by some birds obfuscates the issue. Mainland and Tasmanian birds are the same size. Ornithologists Richard Schodde and Ian Mason argued that the poor quality of museum collections and partially migratory habits meant that discrete subspecies could not be distinguished on the basis of the observed variation within the species.

Flame-breasted robin was the common name formerly used for the species, and it was gradually abbreviated to flame robin. Other names recorded include bank robin, redhead, and (inaccurately) robin redbreast. Flame robin is the preferred vernacular name of the International Ornithological Congress.

==Description==

The largest of the red robins, the flame robin is long. It has a more slender build than other members of the genus &quot;Petroica&quot;, with relatively long wings and neck and small head. The male is easily distinguished by the bright orange-red plumage of the throat, breast, and abdomen. The crown, nape, ear coverts, hindneck, and sides of neck are dark grey, and lores and chin are a grey-black. The grey feathers of the sides of the crown may be suffused with dull orange. The rest of the upperparts, comprising the wings, back and tail, are dark grey. There is a small, white frontal spot above the bill, and the wing bar and outer tail shafts are white. The feathers of the posterior belly, flanks, and vent are white with grey-black bases. The female is plainly coloured—pale brown overall, and a lighter buff underneath. The lower belly, sides, and underside are a soft off-white colour. Similar to the male, feathers on the sides of the crown might have a subtle hint of dull orange, and this coloration could also extend to the feathers on the breast area. There are small, off-white marks on the wings and above the bill. The bill, legs, feet, and claws are black, and the eyes dark brown. A flame robin with an all lemon-yellow breast and otherwise female plumage was observed in a small flock of flame robins near Swansea, in eastern Tasmania, in September 1950.

Nestlings have dark grey or brown down, cream to grey bills, cream gapes and orange throats. The plumage of juvenile birds in their first moult resembles that of the adult female, but the head and upperparts are streaked and slightly darker. Soon after fledging, juveniles moult into their first immature plumage, and more closely resemble the adult female. The breasts of male juveniles may have some orange feathers. Birds in their second year moult into a second immature phase, some males of which may resemble adult males, while others retain a more immature brown plumage. Determining the age and sex of birds in brown plumage can be very difficult. Information on exact timing of moulting is lacking, but the replacement of primary feathers takes place over the summer months between December and February.

The colour alone is not a reliable guide to determine the species, as some scarlet robins (&quot;P. boodang&quot;) take on an orange hue, but while male scarlet and red-capped robins (&quot;P. goodenovii&quot;) have red breasts and black throats, the flame robin&#x27;s breast plumage extends right up to the base of the bill. It is also a little slimmer and has a smaller head than the scarlet robin, and is clearly larger than the red-capped robin. Females of the respective species are harder to tell apart. Those of red-capped, rose, and pink robins are all smaller, with wing lengths less than , smaller than the smallest flame robin. The female scarlet robin has a more pronounced red flush to the breast and the spot on the forehead above the bill is more prominent and white rather than off-white.

The flame robin&#x27;s calls are grouped into louder and quieter calls; the former can be heard from away, while the latter, which are often briefer, from . Loud songs make up almost 90% of calls in spring, summer, and autumn, but less than 50% of calls from May to July. Males sing rarely during this time, although they do so to defend their territories. Their song is more varied and complex than that of the scarlet robin, and has been described as the most musical of the red robins. A series of descending notes in groups of three, the musical song has been likened to the phrases, &quot;&quot;you-may-come, if-you-will, to-the-sea&quot; or &quot;you-are-not a-pretty-little-bird like-me&quot;. Both males and females sing this song, often perched from a vantage point, such as a stump or fence. This loud song is used to attract the attention of a potential mate, and to announce the bringing of food to its mate or young. The softer call has been described as a &#x27;, &#x27; or &quot;, and is used as a contact call in the vicinity of the nest. The female makes a hissing sound, if approached while on the nest, and the male has been recorded making a wheezing call when displaying around the nest.

==Distribution and habitat==
The flame robin is found in temperate regions of southeastern Australia and all over Tasmania, although it is less common in the southwest and west. In Victoria, it is more common in uplands than lower altitudes. It ranges from the Adelaide and Murray Plains around the mouth of the Murray River in southeastern South Australia, across Victoria, and into the South West Slopes and southern regions of New South Wales. Further north, it is found along the Great Dividing Range and its western slopes, with a few records from southeast Queensland. Within its range, it is generally migratory, moving from alpine and subalpine regions to lowlands in winter, although the breeding and non-breeding ranges overlap. There is some evidence that male birds migrate several days before the females. It is unclear what proportion of Tasmanian birds cross Bass Strait to winter in Victoria. Birds which remain in Tasmania move away from breeding areas, and are found in paddocks in loose flocks of up to fourteen birds. They have left these areas by August, and immature birds appear to disperse earlier. A field study in the outer Melbourne suburb of Langwarrin showed that climate did not influence peak abundance of flame robins there. The international organisation BirdLife International has regraded it from &quot;Least Concern&quot; to &quot;Near Threatened&quot; in 2004, due to its population decline over the previous 25 years. The Australian Government had classified it as &quot;Least Concern&quot;, but noted evidence of decline at the edges of its non-breeding range; it has become rare in South Australia, and uncommon in the lowlands of Victoria. Flame robins are not rare in the Victorian high country. They are frequently encountered at high elevations on the Great Dividing Range, especially in sparser snow gum woodland and similar habitat, and during the summer breeding season are one of the most reliably observed species around the summit of Mount Macedon, NW of Melbourne.

In spring and summer, the flame robin is more often found in wet eucalypt forest in hilly or mountainous areas, particularly the tops and slopes, to an elevation of . It generally prefers areas with more clearings and less understory. In particular, it prefers tall forests dominated by such trees as snow gum (&quot;Eucalyptus pauciflora&quot;), mountain ash ( &quot;E. regnans&quot;), alpine ash (&quot;E. delegatensis&quot;), manna gum (&quot;E. viminalis&quot;), messmate stringybark (&quot;E. obliqua&quot;), black gum (&quot;E. aggregata&quot;), white mountain gum (&quot;E. dalrympleana&quot;), brown barrel (&quot;E. fastigata&quot;), narrow-leaved peppermint (&quot;E. radiata&quot;), and black peppermint (&quot;E. amygdalina&quot;). It is occasionally encountered in temperate rainforest. In the autumn and winter, birds move to more open areas, such as grasslands and open woodlands, particularly those containing river red gum (&quot;E. camaldulensis&quot;), Blakely&#x27;s red gum (&quot;E. blakelyi&quot;), yellow box (&quot;E. melliodora&quot;), grey box (&quot;E. microcarpa&quot;), and mugga ironbark (&quot;E. sideroxylon&quot;), at lower altitude.

Flame robins often become more abundant in areas recently burnt by bushfires, but move away once the undergrowth regrows. They may also move into logged or cleared areas in forests. However, a field study in the Boola Boola State Forest in central Gippsland revealed they are not found in areas where the regrowth after logging is dense.

==Behaviour==

The flame robin mostly breeds in and around the Great Dividing Range, the Tasmanian highlands, and islands in Bass Strait. With the coming of cooler autumn weather, most birds disperse to lower and warmer areas, some travelling as far as eastern South Australia, southern Queensland, or (in the case of some Tasmanian birds) across Bass Strait to Victoria. Birds breeding in the warmer climates north of the Blue Mountains in New South Wales tend to retain their highland territories all year round. Outside the breeding season, birds may congregate in loose flocks, but they are most usually encountered throughout the year singly or in pairs, the latter more commonly in breeding season.

When perched or between bouts of foraging on the ground, the flame robin holds itself in a relatively upright pose, with its body angled at 45° or less from the vertical, and its wings held low below its tail. It impresses as nervous and twitchy, flicking its wings alternately when still. The flame robin&#x27;s flight is fast, with a markedly undulating character.

The flame robin is territorial, defending its territory against other members of its species, and also against scarlet robins where they co-occur. In Nimmitabel in southern New South Wales, migratory flame robins invaded and eked out their territories from amid existing scarlet robin territories. Once settled, however, no species dominated over the other and stable boundaries emerged. The flame robin deploys a number of agonistic displays, including a breast-puffing display where it puffs its breast feathers, and a white spot display where it puffs its feathers to accentuate its frontal white spot, white wing markings or white outer tail feathers. They may also fly at intruders or sing to defend their territory.

===Courtship and breeding===
Several courtship behaviours have been recorded. Males have been recorded feeding females. A male flame robin either lands next to and moves a female off her perch, or flies in front of her. Courting males also run to and fro in front of a female, in a crouch with wings and head lowered, and hiding their breast feathers. In both displays, the male proceeds to chase the female. Pairs are generally monogamous, and remain together unless one bird perishes, although &quot;divorces&quot; have been recorded.

The breeding season is August to January with one or two broods raised. The male proposes suitable nest sites to the female by hopping around the area. Unlike other robins, the female sometimes initiates the site selection. A pair spends anywhere from one to five days looking before finding a suitable site. The female constructs the nest alone. Eucalypts are generally chosen, but birds have been recorded nesting in &quot;Pinus radiata&quot; on Mount Wellington in Tasmania. The flame robin is more versatile in its selection of nesting sites than other robins, and has even been recorded nesting in sheds.

The nest is a neat, deep cup made of soft dry grass, moss, and bark. Spider webs, feathers, and fur are used for binding/filling, generally in a tree fork or crevice, or cliff or riverbank ledge, typically within a few metres of the ground. The clutch generally numbers three or four dull white eggs, which are laid on consecutive days. They are tinted bluish, greyish or brownish, and splotched with dark grey-brown, and measure 18 mm x 14 mm. A field study in open eucalypt forest at Nimmitabel found that flame robins and scarlet robins chose different sites to breed, the former in tree hollows and bark crevices, most commonly of &quot;Eucalyptus viminalis&quot; around off the ground, and the latter more commonly in forks or on branches of &quot;E. pauciflora&quot; around above the ground. Flame robins, which were migratory at the site, were more successful in raising young, but the success rate of scarlet robins in the area appeared to be poor compared with other sites.

Incubation has been recorded as averaging around 17 days. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial; they are born blind and naked, and start to develop down on their heads on day two. Their eyes open around day six, and they begin developing their primary flight feathers around day nine or ten. For the first three days after hatching, the mother feeds the nestlings alone, with food brought to her by the father. The father feeds them directly from the fourth day onwards, with the mother brooding them afterward until day seven. Flies, butterflies, moths, caterpillars, and beetles predominate in the food fed to the young birds. Flame robins fed a higher proportion of flying insects to their young at Nimmitabel than did scarlet robins, which may have been due to their later start to breeding. Both parents participate in removing faecal sacs from the nest. Parents have been observed feeding young up to five weeks after leaving the nest.

The fan-tailed cuckoo (&quot;Cacomantis flabelliformis&quot;) and pallid cuckoo (&quot;C. pallidus&quot;) have been recorded as brood parasites of the flame robin; female cuckoos lay their eggs in robin nests, which are then raised by the robins as their own. One fan-tailed cuckoo was recorded ejecting baby robins before being raised by its foster parents. Other nest predators recorded include the grey shrikethrush (&quot;Colluricincla harmonica&quot;), pied currawong (&quot;Strepera graculina&quot;), and eastern brown snake (&quot;Pseudonaja textilis&quot;).

===Feeding===
Like all Australasian robins, the flame robin is a perch and pounce hunter, mainly eating insects, and often returning to a favourite low perch several times to stand erect and motionless, scanning the leaf-litter for more prey. They are typically seen in pairs (during the spring and summer breeding season) or in loose companies in more open country during winter, when they more commonly feed on the ground. A field study in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales found no significant difference in foraging behaviour between male and female flame robins. Birds have been recorded foraging for insects in furrows in freshly ploughed fields. In Deniliquin, a flame robin was observed holding one foot forward and pattering the ground repeatedly to disturb ground-dwelling insects, and then watching and snapping up any which emerged; this behaviour is otherwise seen in waders.

Compared with the scarlet robin, the flame robin eats a higher proportion of flying insects. Biologist, Doug Robinson, has proposed that scarcity of flying insects in winter is a reason why the flame robin migrates. They have been seen in mixed-species flocks with other small insectivorous passerines, such as scarlet robins, hooded robins (&quot;Melanodryas cucullata&quot;), white-fronted chats (&quot;Epthianura albifrons&quot;), and Australian pipits (&quot;Anthus australis&quot;).

Among the types of insects consumed are many families of beetles, wasps, and ants, flies (families Tabanidae and Asilidae), bugs, and caterpillars. Other invertebrates eaten include spiders, millipedes and earthworms. The flame robin consumes small prey items whole, and bashes larger victims against a hard surface repeatedly to break up before eating. The latter group constitute only 0.5% of prey over time—seasonally varying from a peak of 1.8% in autumn to a low of 0.2% of prey caught in winter.

<doc id="501549" wikidata="Q7396370" url="?curid=501549" title="Sabreman">
<text>Sabreman is a series of action-adventure games developed and published by Ultimate Play the Game for the ZX Spectrum in the 1980s. Some of the instalments were also released on other popular home microcomputers, namely the Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, and MSX. The series stars Sabreman, who is depicted wearing khakis and a pith helmet. While the series went dormant after the sale of Ultimate Play The Game, the developer&#x27;s successor Rare would release a remake of the original game on the Game Boy Advance. Microsoft owns the series through its acquisition of Rare under Xbox Game Studios.

==Games==
The story of Sabreman&#x27;s adventures is not developed within the games themselves, but each game would come with an explanation of the story so far on the cassette inlay cards.

* &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; (1984), in which Sabreman must escape a large jungle maze by collecting four pieces of an amulet, while avoiding the titular wulf. Finding all four would grant access to:
* &quot;Underwurlde&quot; (1984), in which Sabreman must find three weapons to defeat three guardians in an extensive system of caverns. This done, three exits are available, each leading to one of the following three games.
* &quot;Knight Lore&quot; (1984), in which Sabreman arrives at Knight Lore Castle to seek a cure for his newfound lycanthropy. Collecting a number of items for the resident wizard Melkhior achieves both the cure and progress to:
* &quot;Pentagram&quot; (1986), in which Sabreman, as a newly qualified wizard himself, embarks on a quest to find the Pentagram, a powerful magic artifact. Once this is achieved Sabreman is directed to the final game in the series:
* &quot;Mire Mare&quot; (cancelled), which was never released and about which little is known.

Sabreman&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Knight Lore&quot; inspired the character Sabrewulf in the &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; series, while Sabreman himself made a cameo in &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;, both by Ultimate&#x27;s successor company Rare. No other games in the series were released until &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; on the Game Boy Advance in 2004, which builds on the story from the original &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot;, the object being to collect amulet pieces to defeat the Wulf once again. Following the cancellation of &quot;Donkey Kong Racing&quot;, Rare attempted to rework the game for Xbox and later Xbox 360 as &quot;Sabreman Stampede&quot;, but was also cancelled during development due to a lack of focus and Rare&#x27;s unfamiliarity with the hardware. In 2015, the original version of &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot;, &quot;Underwurlde&quot;, and &quot;Knight Lore&quot; were re-released as part of the &quot;Rare Replay&quot; compilation for Xbox One.

<text>An audio game is an electronic game played on a device such as a personal computer. It is similar to a video game save that there is audible and tactile feedback but not visual.

Audio games originally started out as &#x27;blind accessible&#x27;-games and were developed mostly by amateurs and blind programmers.
But more and more people are showing interest in audio games, ranging from sound artists, game accessibility researchers, mobile game developers and mainstream video gamers. Most audio games run on a personal computer platform, although there are a few audio games for handhelds and video game consoles. Audio games feature the same variety of genres as video games, such as adventure games, racing games, etc.

== Audio game history ==
The term &quot;electronic game&quot; is commonly understood as a synonym for the narrower concept of the &quot;video game.&quot; This is understandable as both electronic games and video games have developed in parallel and the game market has always had a strong bias toward the visual. The first electronic game, in fact, is often cited to be &quot;Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device&quot; (1947) a decidedly visual game. Despite the difficulties in creating a visual component to early electronic games imposed by crude graphics, small view-screens, and power consumption, video games remained the primary focus of the early electronic game market.

=== Arcade and one-off handheld audio gamesthe early years ===

Atari released the first audio game, &quot;Touch Me&quot;, in 1974. Housed in an arcade cabinet, &quot;Touch Me&quot; featured a series of lights which would flash with an accompanying tone. The player would reproduce the sequence by pressing a corresponding sequence of buttons and then the game would add another light/sound to the end of the growing sequence to continually test the player&#x27;s eidetic memory in a Pelmanism-style format. Although the game featured both a visual and an auditory component, the disconnect between the two enabled both the seeing and the visually impaired to equally enjoy the game.

Based on the popularity of &quot;Touch Me&quot;, in 1978 Milton Bradley Company released a handheld audio game entitled &quot;Simon&quot; at Studio 54 in New York City. Whereas &quot;Touch Me&quot; had been in competition with other visual-centric video games and consequently remained only a minor success, the allure of a personal electronic game allowed &quot;Simon&quot; to capture a much greater share of the market. &quot;Simon&quot; became an immediate success eventually becoming a pop culture symbol of the 1980s.

In the decades following the release of &quot;Simon&quot;, numerous clones and variations were produced including &quot;Merlin&quot; among others. Beginning in 1996, Milton Bradley and a number of other producers released the handheld &quot;Bop It&quot; which featured a similar concept of a growing series of commands designed to test eidetic memory. Other related games soon followed including &quot;Bop It Extreme&quot; (1998), &quot;Bop It-Extreme 2&quot; (2002–2003), &quot;Zing-It&quot;, &quot;Top-It&quot;, and &quot;Loopz&quot; (2010)

=== TTS software and the PCthe second wave ===

Before graphical operating systems like Windows, most home computers used text-based operating systems such as DOS. Being text-based meant that they were relatively accessible to visually impaired users, requiring only the additional use of text-to-speech (TTS) software. For the same reason, following the development of TTS software, text-based games such as early text-only works of interactive fiction were also equally accessible to users with or without a visual impairment. Since the availability of such software was not commonly accessible until the inclusion of the MacInTalk program on Apple Computers in 1984, the library of games which became accessible to the vision impaired spanned everything from the earliest text adventure, &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; (1976), to the comparatively advanced works of interactive fiction which had developed in the subsequent 8 years. Although the popularity of this genre has waned in the general market as video-centric games became the dominant form of electronic game, this library is still growing with the freeware development by devoted enthusiasts of new interactive fiction titles each year.

Accessibility for the visually impaired began to change, some time prior to the advent of graphical operating systems as computers became powerful enough to support more video-centric games. This created a gap between electronic games for the seeing and games for the blind — a gap that has by now grown substantially. Due to a strong market bias in favor of the seeing, electronic games were primarily developed for this demographic. While seeing gamers could venture into 3D gaming worlds in such video game titles as &quot;Myst&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Doom&quot;, blind gamers were relegated to playing more mundane games such as &quot;Blackjack&quot;, or &quot;Battleship&quot;.

As video games flourished and became increasingly common, however, amateur game designers began to adapt video games for the blind via sound. In time audio game programmers began to develop audio-only games, based to a smaller and smaller degree on existing video game ideas and instead focusing on the possibilities of game immersion and feedback with sound. Specifically, three-dimensional positional audio (binaural recording) has been developed since 2000 and now figures prominently in, for example, such audio games as &quot;BBBeat&quot;. To effect this, a sound is played in the left, center, or right channel to indicate an object&#x27;s position in a virtual gaming environment. Generally, this involves stereo panning of various sound effects, many of which are looped to serve as indicators of hazards or objects with which the user can interact. Volume also plays a major role in 3D audio games primarily to indicate an object&#x27;s proximity with reference to the user. The pitch of a sound is often varied to convey other information about the object it symbolizes. Voice talent is used to indicate menu items rather than text. These parameters have allowed for the creation of, among other genres, side scrollers, 3D action adventures, shooters, and arcade style games.

The website Audiogames.net provides a list of audio games and a forum for the community of audio game developers and gamers. Many of the listed games contain some primitive graphics as to make audio games not only accessible to blind and visually impaired people but also to gamers with vision, who may be unexperienced with TTS, auditory menus and typical keyboard mappings. Examples include Shades of Doom and the CURAT Sonification game.

=== Console audio games and the modern era ===
Most audio games are now developed by several small companies (consisting of only a team of one to four people). The main audience remains primarily visually impaired users, however the game market at large is gradually taking more notice of audio games as well due to the issue of game accessibility. Commercial interest in audio games has steadily grown and as a result artists and students have created a number of experimental freeware PC audio games to explore the possibilities and limitations of this gaming form.

Despite the increase in interest in audio games, however, many modern games still lack sufficient audio cues to be considered fully accessible for the visually impaired. Furthermore, the industry still lacks a clear set of accessibility guidelines for their development. Tools such as the once popular Blastbay Game Toolkit engine that aided in the development of audio games are now obsolete, but current game engines like Unity and Unreal that can support audio game development are not specifically designed for doing so, creating an additional hurdle for audio game developers.

In the field of console-gaming, there has been very little in the way of audio-games. One notable exception has been the innovative incorporation of strong audio elements in several of the games produced by the Japanese video game company, Warp. Warp was founded by musician Kenji Eno and consisted of a five-man team including first-time designer Fumito Ueda. In 1997, Warp developed a game called &quot;Real Sound&quot; for the Sega Saturn which was later ported to Dreamcast in 1999 and renamed (&quot;Real Sound: Regrets in the Wind&quot;). This game featured no visuals at all and was entirely dependent upon sound.

Discussing &quot;Real Sound&quot;&#x27;s production, Eno has stated that 

Following the release of &quot;Real Sound&quot;, Warp again made use of a novel employment of audio elements in the Saturn game &quot;Enemy Zero&quot; (1997), in which the enemies are invisible and can only be detected through auditory clues. Audio-specific elements used in gameplay have been recognized in Warp&#x27;s &quot;D2&quot; (2000).

Nintendo, as part of its shift to alternative gameplay forms, has shown recent interest in audio games through its own development teams. In July 2006, Nintendo released a collection of audio games called &quot;Soundvoyager&quot; as the newest member of its spare &quot;Digiluxe&quot; series. The Digiluxe series for Game Boy Advance consists of 7 games (in 2 series) that are characterized by simple yet compelling gameplay, minimal graphics, and the emphasis, in such titles as &quot;Soundvoyager&quot; and &quot;Dotstream&quot;, on music. &quot;Soundvoyager&quot; contains 7 audio games (&quot;Sound Slalom&quot;, &quot;Sound Picker&quot;, &quot;Sound Drive&quot;, &quot;Sound Cock&quot;, &quot;Sound Chase&quot;, &quot;Sound Catcher&quot;, and &quot;Sound Cannon&quot;). The Digiluxe series has been available in Japan since July 2006.

In 2008, MIT students collaborated with the government of Singapore and a professor at the National University of Singapore to create &quot;AudiOdyssey&quot;, a game which allows both blind and sighted gamers to play together.

Apple&#x27;s iPhone platform has become home to a number of audio games, including &quot;Papa Sangre&quot;. Other examples include Audiogame.it&#x27;s &quot;Flarestar&quot; (a space-themed exploration game that features combat against training drones and other spacecraft) and &quot;Sonic Tennis&quot; (a game which simulates a tennis match and features a multiplayer mode).

Android devices also feature a myriad of audio games. For example, the studio Blind Faith Games has developed various games for Android with the goal of accessibility for the visually impaired community. Examples include &quot;Golf Accessible&quot; (a simulation of golfing) and &quot;Zarodnik&quot; (a strategy game where the user faces a monster in the depths of the ocean), which utilize screen vibrations and audio cues for the gameplay experience. Another unique example of an audio game for Android is a game currently in development by researchers at Tsinghua University titled &quot;Wander&quot;, which is intended to be used as the player falls asleep to improve the quality of their rest. A guide provides the instructions to users verbally, and they use their breath to explore a forest filled with relaxing environmental noises.

With the rise in popularity of voice assistants such as Amazon Alexa came a new set of audio games. As of June 2021, 10,000 audio games were available as Alexa Skills for use with Amazon Alexa. Among them are games like Rain Labs&#x27; &quot;Animal Sounds&quot;, which asks users to correctly identify the noises made by various animals.

== TTS-enabling video games ==
The rise of text-to-speech (TTS) software and steady improvements in the field have allowed full audio-conversion of traditionally video-based games. Such games were intended for use by and marketed to the seeing, however they do not actually rest primarily on the visual aspects of the game and so members of the audio game community have been able to convert them to audio games by using them in conjunction with TTS software. While this was originally only available for strictly text-based games like text adventures and MUDs, advances in TTS software have led to increased functionality with a diverse array of software types beyond text-only media allowing other works of interactive fiction as well as various simulator games to be enjoyed in a strictly audio environment.

Examples of such games include:

* &quot;A Dark Room&quot; – (Doublespeak Games, 2013)
* &quot;Hattrick&quot; – (ExtraLives AB, 1997)
* &quot;OGame&quot; – (Gameforge, 2002)
* &quot;Jennifer Government: NationStates&quot; – (Max Barry, 2002)
* &quot;Grendel&#x27;s Cave&quot; – (Grendel Enterprises, 1998)
Another example is &quot;The Last of Us Part II&quot;, which was released by Naughty Dog in the summer of 2020 for the PlayStation 4. The game contains over 60 accessibility features, including a text-to-speech feature. Other features that make the game completely playable without sight include the use of voice actors, haptic feedback, and audio cues that act as hints to the player. In addition, the game provides the common audio game feature of a sound glossary menu. On this menu, the user can scroll through a variety of audio cues and hear what they sound like and what they are used for during gameplay. For this game in particular, examples include signals to the user that they can crouch, jump, or interact with the nearby environment.

<doc id="501554" wikidata="Q8036444" url="?curid=501554" title="World War II evacuation and expulsion">
<text>Mass evacuation, forced displacement, expulsion, and deportation of millions of people took place across most countries involved in World War II. The Second World War caused the movement of the largest number of people in the shortest period of time in history. A number of these phenomena were categorised as violations of fundamental human values and norms by the Nuremberg Tribunal after the war ended. The mass movement of people – most of them refugees – had either been caused by the hostilities, or enforced by the former Axis and the Allied powers based on ideologies of race and ethnicity, culminating in the postwar border changes enacted by international settlements. The refugee crisis created across formerly occupied territories in World War II provided the context for much of the new international refugee and global human rights architecture existing today.

Belligerents on both sides engaged in forms of expulsion of people perceived as being associated with the enemy. The major location for the wartime displacements was East-Central and Eastern Europe, although Japanese people were expelled during and after the war by Allied powers from locations in Asia including India. The Holocaust also involved deportations and expulsions of Jews preliminary to the subsequent genocide perpetrated by Nazi Germany under the auspices of Aktion Reinhard.

== World War II deportations, expulsions and displacements ==
Following the invasion of Poland in September 1939 which marked the beginning of World War II, the campaign of ethnic &quot;cleansing&quot; became the goal of military operations for the first time since the end of World War I. After the end of the war, between 13.5 and 16.5 million German-speakers lost their homes in formerly German lands and all over Eastern Europe.

===Aftermath of the invasion of Poland===
* 1939 to 1945: The Nazis planned to ethnically cleanse the whole Polish population according to a germanisation Master Plan called &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;. Eventually in the course of Nazi occupation up to 1.6 to 2 million Poles were expelled, not counting millions of slave labourers deported from Poland to the Reich.
* 1939 to 1940: Expulsions of 680,000 Poles from German-occupied Wielkopolska (German -Reichsgau Wartheland). From the city of Poznań Germans expelled to General Government 70,000 Poles. By 1945, half a million &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; Germans from Soviet Union, Bessarabia, Romania, and the Baltic Germans had been resettled during action &quot;Heim ins Reich&quot; by German organisations like &quot;Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle&quot; and &quot;Resettlement department&quot; of RKFDV &quot;(Stabshauptamt Reichkomissar für die Festigung deutsches Volkstums)&quot; from Eastern Europe.
* 1939 to 1940: Expulsions of 121,765 Poles from German-occupied Pomerania. On Polish places 130,000 &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; was settled including 57,000 Germans from East Europe countries: Soviet Union, Bessarabia, Romania and the Baltic states. Deportation was a part of German &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy ordered by German organisations like &quot;Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle&quot; and &quot;Resettlement department&quot; of RKFDV.
* 1939 to 1940: The first evacuation of Finnish Karelia was the resettlement of the population of Finnish Karelia and other territories ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union after and during the Winter War into the remaining parts of Finland. Some of the territories were evacuated during the war or before it, as part of the course of the war. Most of the territory was evacuated after the Soviet Union gained it as a part of the Moscow peace treaty. In total, 410,000 people were transferred.
* 1940 to 1941: The Soviets deported hundreds of thousands of Polish citizens, most in four mass waves. The accepted figure was over 1.5 million. The most conservative figures use recently found NKVD documents showing 309,000 to 381,220. The Soviets didn&#x27;t recognise ethnic minorities as Polish citizens, some of the figures are based on those given an amnesty rather than deported and not everyone was eligible for the amnesty therefore the new figures are considered too low. The original figures were: February 1940 over 220,000; April around 315,000; June–July between 240,000 to 400,000; June, 1941, 200,000 to 300,000.
* 1940 to 1941: Expulsions of 17,000 Polish and Jewish residents from the western districts of city Oświęcim from places located directly adjacent to Auschwitz Concentration Camp, and also from the villages of Broszkowice, Babice, Brzezinka, Rajsko, Pławy, Harmęże, Bór, and Budy. The Expulsion of Polish civilians was a step towards establishing the Camp Interest Zone, which was set up in order to isolate the camp from the outside world and to carry out business activity to meet the needs of the SS. German and &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; settlers move in. This was one of the numerous forced migrations associated with the Holocaust.

===World War II===
* 1940: A population exchange between Bulgaria and Romania is carried out. 103,711 Romanians, Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians are transferred to Romania and 62,278 Bulgarians are evacuated to Bulgaria.
* 1940 to 1941: The deportation of Volga Germans by Soviet Union to Kazakhstan, Altai Krai, Siberia, and other remote areas.
* 1941: The deportation of Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians by Soviet Union.
* 1941: The deportation and massacres of prisoners in Western Soviet Union.
* 1941 to 1944: During the Finnish occupation of East Karelia during World War II the Russian-speaking population was held in East Karelian concentration camps.
* 1941 to 1944: Expulsion of Poles from the Zamość region was performed in November 1941, and it was continued in June/July 1943, it was code named &quot;Wehrwolf Action I&quot; and &quot;II&quot;, and it was carried out in an attempt to make room for German (and to a lesser extent, to make room for Ukrainian) settlers as part of Nazi plans for the establishment of German colonies in the conquered territories. Around 110,000 people from 297 villages were expelled. Around 30,000 of the victims of the expulsion were children who, if they were racially &quot;clean&quot; (i.e. if they had physical characteristics which were deemed &quot;Germanic&quot;) were prepared for germanisation by German families in the Third Reich. Most of the people who were expelled were sent to Germany and used as slave labourers or they were sent to concentration camps.
*1941 to 1944: in Kosovo and Metohija, some 10,000 Serbs lost their lives, and about 80,000 to 100,000 or more were ethnically cleansed.
* 1941 to 1945: More than 250,000 Serbs were expelled from Croatia and Bosnia by the extreme nationalist Ustaše regime during the Serbian Genocide.
* 1941 to 1949: During World War II, Japanese-Americans and Japanese-Canadians were interned in camps.
* 1942: Deportation of the Ingrian Finns from Soviet controlled territory of the Leningrad Blockade.
* 1943 to 1944: The Deportation of Crimean Tatars, Kalmyks, Chechens, Ingush, Balkars, Karachays, and Meskhetian Turks by Soviet Union to Central Asia and Siberia.
* 1943 to 1944: The ethnic cleansing and Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia by the nationalist UPA with the bulk of victims reported in summer and autumn 1944.
* 1943 to 1960: The Istrian–Dalmatian exodus involved the diaspora of 350,000, mostly ethnic Italians (Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians) together with anti-communist Slovene and Croat people, from Istria, Fiume and Dalmatian lands (mainly from the city of Zara), after the collapse of Italian fascist regime.
* 1944: The displacement of the majority ethnic Estonian population from the Estonian city of Narva by Soviet occupation authorities.
* 1944: The second Evacuation of Finnish Karelia. Some 280,000 Finns had returned to areas ceded in 1940 to the Soviet Union and subsequently re-conquered by Finland in 1941. During summer and autumn 1944, Finland re-ceded these areas back to the Soviet Union, and re-evacuated the Finnish population.
* 1944: The evacuation of almost total civilian population of Finnish Lapland, as a joint Finnish-German effort, before Finnish and German troops commenced hostilities. The evacuees, numbering 168,000 were able to return home within a year.
* 1944 to 1945: The ethnic cleansing of Hungarians, or the massacres in Bačka by Titoist partisans during the winter of 1944–45; about 40,000 were massacred. Afterwards, between 45 and 48, internment camps were set which led directly to the death of 70,000 more, of famine, frost, plagues, tortures and executions.
* 1944 to 1945: Between 16,000 and 20,000 Cham Albanians fled from Thesprotia Prefecture to Albania. Between 200 and 300 were killed.

===Defeat of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan===

* 1944 to 1947 &amp; 1951 The mass deportation of Ukrainian speaking ethnic minorities from the territory of Poland after World War II, culminating in 1947 with the start of Operation Vistula.
* 1944 to 1947 &amp; 1951: 1.5 million Poles were deported from the eastern territories annexed by the Soviet Union into the western territories, which Soviets transferred from Germany to Poland. By 1950, 1.6 million Poles from the eastern territories annexed by the Soviet Union had been settled in what the government called the Regained Territories.
* 1944 to 1948: Flight and expulsion of Germans after World War II. Between 13.5 and 16.5 million German-speakers fled, were evacuated or later expelled from Central and Eastern Europe, making this event the largest single instance of ethnic cleansing in recorded history. estimates of the number of those who died during the process are being debated by historians and they range from 500,000 to 3,000,000.
*November and December 1944: more than 200,000 Danube Swabians in Yugoslavia were expelled from their homes and interned in starvation and Nazi concentration camps for the old, young and disabled. Some 30,000 workers were expelled to Russia as slave laborers for war reparations.
* Tens of thousands of the refugees were repatriated to Yugoslavia and massacred in the Yugoslav death march of Nazi collaborators.
* Repatriation of Cossacks after World War II
* In 1945, American and Republican Chinese forces returned Japanese colonizers from northeast China in what was termed the Japanese repatriation from Huludao. In those areas liberated by the Soviets and not the Americans, these Japanese became Japanese prisoners of war in the Soviet Union.
* After Japan surrendered, the Soviet Union occupied northern Korea and southern Sakhalin. These had been Japanese territories before the war and had millions of Japanese residents, who were now to be expelled. Roughly two-thirds of the Korean residents of Sakhalin were also expelled to Japan, but the others remained stranded in Sakhalin.
* Taiwan was ceded to Japan in 1895 as a consequence of the First Sino-Japanese War and by the beginning of World War II many Japanese civilians had settled there. Between the Japanese surrender of Taiwan in 1945 and 25 April 1946, the occupying Republic of China forces expelled 90% of the Japanese living in Taiwan.
*More than 30,000 Serbs colonists were expelled from Bulgarian-occupied Macedonia and south-eastern Serbia
*Aliyah Bet was the code-name for illegal immigration of the Jews of Europe to Mandatory Palestine after the passing of the 1939 White Paper, while the Holocaust was occurring, and the existence of numerous displaced people of Jewish ethnicity, was a major factor in the effective eventual establishment of the State of Israel, starting from the passing of United Nations General Assembly resolution 181 (II) . Those migrants were helped by an underground group called Bricha. After Israel was born, European Jewish migration to Israel continued, contributing to Israel&#x27;s population growth. The 1946 Kielce pogrom and other anti-Semitic incidents were provided further push-factors factors for Aliyah.

==Establishment of refugee organisations==
The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration was set up in 1943, to provide humanitarian relief to the huge numbers of potential and existing refugees in areas facing Allied liberation. UNRRA provided billions of US dollars of rehabilitation aid, and helped about 8 million refugees. It ceased operations in Europe in 1947, and in Asia in 1949, upon which it ceased to exist. It was replaced in 1947 by the International Refugee Organization (IRO), which in turn evolved into United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1950.

<doc id="501555" wikidata="Q2845328" url="?curid=501555" title="Anaang people">
<text>Anaang (also spelled Annang and Ànnang) is an ethnic group in Southern Nigeria, whose land is primarily within 8 of the present 31 Local Government Areas in Akwa Ibom State: Abak, Essien Udim, Etim Ekpo, Ika, Ikot Ekpene, Obot Akara, Oruk Anam, Ukanafun in Akwa Ibom State. The Anaang are the second largest ethnic group after the Ibibios in Akwa Ibom state.

The Anaang were formerly located in the former Abak and Ikot Ekpene Divisions of the Anaang Province, as well as part of the former Opobo Division of Uyo Province, in the former Eastern Region of Nigeria. The proper name for the Ika of Akwa Ibom is Ika-Annang, a reflection of their intimate connection to their Annang identity.

==History==

===Ancient origin===

The predominant paternal haplogroup among the Anaang is E1b1a1-M2. The ancestors of the Anaang originally came from Northeast Africa and moved around the Green Sahara. The gradual movement of the Proto Anaang to the Cross River Region may have been associated with the expansion of Sahel agriculture in the African Neolithic period, following the desiccation of the Sahara in c. 3500 BCE.

===Oral history===
According to oral tradition, the Abiakpo came to the northern range of Anaang from Eka Abiakpo. They were quickly followed by the Ukana clan, the Utu, Ekpu, Ebom and Nyama (the British lumped these groups together and gave them the name Otoro), and other Anaang clans. The Anaang and the entire people of Akwa Ibom and Cross River states of Nigeria (AkwaCross people) have occupied their land in coastal Southeastern Nigeria for thousands of years.

The group is related to the Efik people. It is believed that the Anaang people originated from Egypt and began their migration from Egypt before settling in present-day Akwa-Ibom, Nigeria. Before their current settlement, they lived among the Twi of Ghana, where the name Anaang means &quot;fourth son&quot;. 

From Ghana, the group moved eastward into present-day Cameroon. It was in the Cameroon highlands that the group broke off but later reached the same territory in Coastal Southeastern Nigeria. Lineages were recognized and the groups organized into clans, based on old family origins known as Iman. Their northern neighbors, the Igbo, have a similar clan/community structure.

===Written history===
Very little was written about the Anaang people before the mid-19th century. Early European traders who arrived in the Cross River territories referred to groups who lived outside of the coastal areas as residents of Egbo-Sharry Country. The first written mention of the Anaangs is in Sigismund Koelle&#x27;s account of liberated slaves in Sierra Leone. He mentioned a liberated slave named &quot;Ebengo&quot; who hailed from Nkwot in Abak. Ebengo was captured and sold to the Portuguese but was subsequently freed by a British warship and later settled in Waterloo, Sierra Leone. The British soldiers listed the languages spoken by the slaves in that captured ship as &quot;Anaang&quot;. The second mention is a description of what is known as the Ikot Udo Obong Wars. The British described the killings of the Anaangs by King &quot;Jaja&quot; of Opobo as a punishment for defying his orders and trading in palm oil directly with the British merchants instead of going through him as a middleman. In the war that ensued, the British intervened and with the help of the Anaangs, they captured King Jaja and exiled him to the West Indies. The British established a military post at Ikot Ekpene in 1904.

Following British colonialism and with changes and ban in ancient hunting practices, the Anaang witnessed attacks by wild animals. As the men went to fight in World War II these attacks intensified. The British authorities called the attacks murder and blamed it on &quot;the barbarism of the Africans&quot;. The Anaang were accused of belonging to a secret society called &quot;Ekpeowo&quot; (The Human Leopards Society). It has been argued that killings born out of insurgency against the British elsewhere in Africa led to the branding of leopard attacks as murders by the British authorities among the Anaang. Between 1945 and 1948 about 196 people were killed in Ikot Okoro community in the present-day Oruk Anam LGA; the Ikot Okoro Police station was set up because of this reason. The British convicted 96 people and executed 77 innocent people. The Anaang religion called Idiong was banned and the priests arrested. Articles and worship materials were publicly burnt and those who did not convert to Christianity automatically became suspects.

The Anaangs have a history and reputation for fearlessness and the ability of villages and clans to bind together to fight a common enemy. This is perhaps why they were able to thrive living so close to the Aro Confederacy&#x27;s center, Arochukwu with its famed Ibini Ukpabi oracle. A particular interesting war group, or &quot;Warrior cult&quot;, was the famous Oko warriors. This war group was highly functional in the 1950s. These warriors were considered invulnerable to penetration of knives, spears, and arrows. In various instances sharp machetes were tested on the body parts of members.

The Anaangs suffered genocide during the Nigerian Civil War. The war lasted for three years (1967–1970) and the Anaang lost a significant number of its people. The effect of the war and the resulting neglect of the Anaang is now a serious political discuss.

==Location==
The Anaang people homeland is located in Akwa Ibom State
, Southern Nigeria. The Annangs have lived in the Southeastern, coastal parts of Nigeria for centuries before the arrival of the Europeans. The political capital of the Anaang people is Ikot Ekpene Local Government Area.

==Culture==

A brother/sister from the same &quot;Ilip,&quot; literally translated as &quot;womb&quot; means that they can trace their origin to the same mother or father. Those who can so trace their ancestry to the same parents form &quot;Ufok&quot; (literally a house or compound). Several &quot;ufoks&quot; make up &quot;Ekpuks&quot; or extended family and several &quot;Ekpuks&quot; (extended families) make up &quot;Ilung&quot; (meaning village) and several villages make up the &quot;abie&quot; or clan. This is in many ways similar to the system used by other south-eastern Nigerian 
peoples but more centralized.

Although leadership at the family, village, or clan level remains the prerogative of the men, lineage ties extends to women even after marriage. This is because the Anaang society was originally semi-matrilineal, just like a few other societies in Eastern Nigeria such as The Abiriba, Afikpo, and Ugep. There are many societies and associations (&quot;Ulim&quot; also called &quot;udim&quot;) for men and women which are very important in traditional village life. Individuals are measured by both the number and types of memberships in &quot;Ulim&quot; and by the achievements of one or more &quot;Ulims&quot;. Governance is done by elderly males who act as the legislative arm called Afe Ichong, directed by the &quot;Abong Ichong&quot; (Village Chief and Clan Chief) who is the head and the chief executive but without the authority beyond what the &quot;Afe Ichong&quot; gives. A chief can be appointed by the &quot;Afe&quot; or can be an inherited office.

The Anang speak the Annang language and perform a masquerade after the yam harvest to mark the visit of ancestral spirits, or &quot;ekpo&quot;. This is also the name of a men&#x27;s associations that once had great influence among Ibibio groups. The Anang carve masks with grotesque features, known as &quot;iliok&quot;, which are considered dangerous and may only be viewed by members of the &quot;ekpo&quot;. Other masks embody the beautiful spirit, or &quot;mfon&quot;.

The strength of any individual, family (or group for that matter) is typically based upon a consensus of the village or clan through this complex social system. In all this, Anang women are not completely subordinate to men. Instead Anaang women are partners and leaders in many aspects of Anaang tradition, including serving as female chief priests &quot;Abia Iyong&quot; in the Iyong cult or as healers in the healing cults. The first-born female known as &quot;Aliaha&quot; is important and commands respect in the family and lineage. Some traditions hold that a woman&#x27;s first birth should take place in her mother&#x27;s compound. Women&#x27;s organizations such as &quot;abi-de&quot; and &quot;Nyaama&quot;, and &quot;Isong Iban&quot; play important roles in giving the women voice and status in society. There are no traditional or cultural barriers that prevent women from attaining high offices or positions.

Anaangs value the ability to speak well and oratory ability using proverbs is highly desirable, especially among the leaders. The American anthropologist, Peter Farb, stated that the name &quot;Anaang&quot; among this group means &quot;they who speak well&quot;. An individual who has the gift of eloquent speech is often complimented as &quot;Akwo Anaang&quot;, meaning the &quot;Man of Anaang&quot;.

===Fattening room===
The fattening room is traditionally where virgin adolescent girls were fattened up in preparation for marriage. A fattening room girl is known as a &quot;mbobo&quot;. This was an occasion for a major village celebration. As part of her preparation for marriage the girl was also instructed on how to be a wife. She would spend her time in the room naked so that her fattening could be observed, and would sleep on a bamboo bed which was thought to fatten her up. It was also meant to make it more possible for her to conceive easily.

This use for fertility purposes was also used at time for infertile wives and as a prerequisite for entrance into secret societies.
==Written language==
The Annang language is also mutually intelligible to speakers of Ibibio, Efik, Oron, Eket (also known as Ekid) of the Akwa Akpa (Old Calabar Kingdom). Though the Anaang speech pattern was not written down, linguists have now produced an orthography of the language which makes it possible to produce written materials in the language (Idem &amp; Udondata, 2001).

<text>A gay bar is a drinking establishment that caters to an exclusively or predominantly lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer (LGBTQ+) clientele; the term &quot;gay&quot; is used as a broadly inclusive concept for LGBTQ+ communities.

Gay bars once served as the centre of gay culture and were one of the few places people with same-sex orientations and gender-variant identities could openly socialize. Other names used to describe these establishments include &quot;boy bar&quot;, &quot;girl bar&quot;, &quot;gay club&quot;, &quot;gay pub&quot;, &quot;queer bar&quot;, &quot;lesbian bar&quot;, &quot;drag bar&quot;, and &quot;dyke bar&quot;, depending on the niche communities that they serve.

With the advent of the Internet and an increasing acceptance of LGBTQ+ people across the Western world, the relevance of gay bars in the LGBTQ+ community has somewhat diminished. In areas without a gay bar, certain establishments may hold a gay night instead.

==History==

Gathering places favoured by homosexuals have operated for centuries. Reports from as early as the 17th century record the existence of bars and clubs that catered to, or at least tolerated, openly gay clientele in several major European cities. The White Swan (created by James Cook and Yardley, full name unknown) on Vere Street, in London, England, was raided in 1810 during the so-called Vere Street Coterie. The raid led to the executions of John Hepburn and Thomas White for sodomy. The site was the scene of alleged gay marriages carried out by the Reverend John Church.

It is not clear which place is the first gay bar in the modern sense. In Cannes, France, such a bar had already opened in 1885, and there were many more in Berlin around 1900. In the United Kingdom and the Netherlands gay bars were established throughout the first quarter of the 20th century.

===China===
The oldest gay bar in Beijing is the Half-and-Half, which in 2004 had been open over ten years. The first lesbian bar in China (also in Beijing) was Maple Bar, opened in 2000 by pop singer Qiao Qiao. The On/Off was a popular bar for both gay men and lesbians. The increase in China&#x27;s gay and lesbian bars in recent years is linked to China&#x27;s opening up to global capitalism and its consequent economic and social restructuring.

=== Denmark ===
The bar Centralhjørnet in Copenhagen opened in 1917 and became a gay bar in the 1950s. It now claims to be one of the oldest gay bars in Europe. The main Copenhagen gay district is the Latin Quarter.

=== France ===
The very first gay bar in Europe and probably in the world was the Zanzibar in Cannes on the French Riviera. The Zanzibar was opened in 1885 and existed for 125 years, before it was closed in December 2010. Among its visitors were many artists, like actor Jean Marais and comedians Thierry Le Luron and Coluche.

Paris became known as a centre for gay culture in the 19th century, making the city a queer capital during the early 20th century, when the Montmartre and Pigalle districts were meeting places of the LGBTQ+ community. Although Amsterdam, Berlin, and London had more meeting places and organizations than Paris, the latter was known for the &quot;flamboyance&quot; of LGBTQ+ quarters and &quot;visibility&quot; of LGBTQ+ celebrities.

Paris retained the LGBTQ+ capital image after the end of World War II, but the center of the meeting place shifted to Saint-Germain-des-Prés. In the 1950s and 1960s the police and authorities tolerated homosexuals as long as the conduct was private and out of view, but gay bar raids occurred and there were occasions when the owners of the bars were involved in facilitating the raids. Lesbians rarely visited gay bars and instead socialized in circles of friends. Lesbians who did go to bars often originated from the working class. Chez Moune, opened in 1936, and New Moon were 20th-century lesbian cabarets located in Place Pigalle, which converted to mixed music clubs in the 21st century.

Since the 1980s, the Le Marais district is the center of the gay scene in Paris.

=== Germany ===

In Berlin, there was gay and lesbian night life already around 1900, which throughout the 1920s became very open and vibrant, especially when compared to other capitals. Especially in the Schöneberg district around Nollendorfplatz there were many cafes, bars and clubs, which also attracted gay people who had to flee their own country in fear of prosecution, like for example Christopher Isherwood. The gay club Eldorado in the Motzstraße was internationally known for its transvestite shows. There was also a relatively high number of places for lesbians. Within a few weeks after the Nazis took over government in 1933, fourteen of the best known gay establishments were closed. After homosexuality was decriminalized in 1969, many gay bars opened in West Berlin, resulting in a lively gay scene.

In Munich, a number of gay and lesbian bars are documented as early as the Golden Twenties. Since the 1960s, the &quot;Rosa Viertel&quot; (pink quarter) developed in the &quot;Glockenbachviertel&quot; and around &quot;Gärtnerplatz&quot;, which in the 1980s made Munich &quot;one of the four gayest metropolises in the world&quot; along with San Francisco, New York City and Amsterdam. In particular, the area around Müllerstraße and &quot;Hans-Sachs-Straße&quot; was characterized by numerous gay bars and nightclubs. One of them was the travesty nightclub &quot;Old Mrs. Henderson&quot;, where Freddie Mercury, who lived in Munich from 1979 to 1985, filmed the music video for the song &quot;Living on My Own&quot; at his 39th birthday party. Other gay venues include &quot;Pompon Rouge&quot;, &quot;Mandy&#x27;s Club&quot;, &quot;Pimpernel&quot; nightclub, the bar &quot;Mylord&quot;, the &quot;Ochsengarten&quot;, which was &quot;Germany&#x27;s first bar for leather men&quot;, as well as the gay hotel-pub &quot;Deutsche Eiche&quot;. Regulars in many of these bars and nightclubs include, for example, Freddie Mercury, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Walter Sedlmayr (who met his later murderer in the Pimpernel), Inge Meysel and Hildegard Knef.

=== Japan ===
The oldest continuously operating Japanese gay bar, New Sazae, opened in Tokyo in 1966. Most gay bars in Tokyo are located in the Shinjuku Ni-chōme district, which is home to about 300 bars. Each bar may only have room to seat about a dozen people; as a result, many bars are specialized according to interest.

===Mexico===

Because of a raid on a Mexico City drag ball in 1901, when 41 men were arrested, the number 41 has come to symbolize male homosexuality in Mexican popular culture, figuring frequently in jokes and in casual teasing. The raid on the &quot;Dance of the 41&quot; was followed by a less-publicized raid of a lesbian bar on 4 December 1901 in Santa Maria. Despite the international depression of the 1930s and along with the social revolution overseen by Lázaro Cárdenas (1934–1940), the growth of Mexico City was accompanied by the opening of gay bars and gay bathhouses. During the Second World War, ten to fifteen gay bars operated in Mexico City, with dancing permitted in at least two, El África and El Triunfo. Relative freedom from official harassment continued until 1959 when Mayor Ernesto Uruchurtu closed every gay bar following a grisly triple-murder. But by the late 1960s several Mexican cities had gay bars and, later, U.S.-style dance clubs. These places, however, were sometimes clandestine but tolerated by local authorities, which often meant that they were allowed to exist so long as the owners paid bribes. A fairly visible presence was developed in large cities such as Guadalajara, Acapulco, Veracruz and Mexico City. Today, Mexico City is home to numerous gay bars, many of them located in the Zona Rosa, particularly on Amberes street, while a broad and varied gay nightlife also flourishes in Guadalajara, Acapulco, in Cancun attracting global tourists, Puerto Vallarta which attracts many Americans and Canadians, and Tijuana with its cross-border crowd. However, there are at least several gay bars in most major cities.

=== Netherlands ===

In Amsterdam, there were already a few gay bars in the first quarter of the 20th century. The best known was , in Nes, which was first mentioned in 1911 and existed until the late 1930s. The oldest that still exists is Café &#x27;t Mandje, which was opened in 1927 by lesbian Bet van Beeren. It closed in 1982, but was reopened in 2008.

After World War II, the Amsterdam city government acted rather pragmatic and tolerated the existence of gay bars. In the 1960s their number grew rapidly and they clustered in and around a number of streets, although this was limited to bars, clubs and shops and they never became residential areas for gays, like the gay villages in the US.

Since the late 1950s the main Amsterdam gay street was Kerkstraat, which was succeeded by Reguliersdwarsstraat in the early 1980s, when the first openly gay places opened here, like the famous cafe April in 1981, followed by dancing Havana in 1989. Other streets where there are still concentrations of gay bars are Zeedijk, Amstel and Warmoesstraat, the latter being the center of the Amsterdam leather scene, where the first leather bar already opened around 1955. The Queen&#x27;s Head is a gay bar located at Zeedijk 20 in the centre of Amsterdam.

===Russia===
Because of the high prevalence of homophobia in Russia, patrons of gay bars there often have had to be on the alert for bullying and attacks. In 2013, Moscow&#x27;s largest gay bar, Central Station, had its walls sprayed with gunfire, had harmful gas released into a crowd of 500 patrons, and had its ceiling nearly brought down by a gang who wanted to crush the people inside. Nonetheless, gay nightlife is increasing in Moscow and St. Petersburg, offering drag shows and Russian music, with some bars also offering discreet gay-only taxi services.

=== Singapore ===
The first recorded use of the term &quot;gay bar&quot; is in the diaries of homosexual British comedian Kenneth Williams: &quot;16 January 1947. Went round to the gay bar which wasn&#x27;t in the least gay.&quot; At the time Williams was serving in the British Army in Singapore. In the 1970s, straight nightclubs began to open their doors to gay clients on designated nights of the week. In the 1980s, a lesbian bar named Crocodile Rock opened in Far East Plaza, which remains to this day the oldest lesbian bar in Singapore. Today, many gay bars are located on the Neil Road stretch, from Taboo and Tantric, to Backstage Bar, May Wong&#x27;s Café, DYMK and Play. Mega-clubs like Zouk and Avalon are also a big draw for the gay crowd.

===South Africa===
The history of gay and lesbian bars in South Africa reflects the racial divisions that began in the Apartheid era and continue, to some extent, in the 21st century.

The first white gay bar opened in the Carlton Hotel in downtown Johannesburg in the late 1940s, catering exclusively to men of wealth. In the 1960s, other urban bars began to open that drew more middle and working class white men; lesbians were excluded. The language of Gayle had its roots in the Cape Coloured and Afrikaans-speaking underground gay bar culture. In 1968, when the government threatened to pass repressive anti-gay legislation, queer culture went even further underground, which meant clubs and bars were often the only places to meet. These bars were often the targets of police raids. The decade of the 1970s was when urban gay clubs took root. The most popular gay club of Johannesburg was The Dungeon, which attracted females as well as males, and lasted until the 1990s. The 1979 police assault on the New Mandy&#x27;s Club, in which patrons fought back, has been referred to as South Africa&#x27;s Stonewall.

In the 1980s, police raids on white gay clubs lessened as the apartheid government forces found itself dealing with more and more resistance from the black population. In the black townships, some of the shebeens, unlicensed bars established in people&#x27;s homes and garages, catered to LGBTQ clients. During the struggle against apartheid, some of these shebeens were important meeting places for black gay and lesbian resistance fighters. Lee&#x27;s, a shebeen in Soweto, for example, was used as a meeting place for black gay men who were part of the Gay Association of South Africa (GASA) but did not feel welcome in the GASA offices.

With the establishment of the post-apartheid 1996 constitution that outlawed discrimination based on sexual orientation as well as race, South Africa&#x27;s gay night life exploded, though many bars continued to be segregated by race, and fewer blacks than whites go to the urban bars. The 2005 inaugural gay shebeen tour was advertised as a gay pub crawl that would provide an opportunity for South Africans and foreigners to &quot;experience true African gay Shebeen culture&quot;.

===South Korea===

In Seoul, most gay bars were originally congregated near the Itaewon area of Seoul, near the U.S. military base. But in recent years, more clubs have located in the Sinchon area, indicating that &quot;safe spaces&quot; for Korean LGBTQ+ people have extended beyond the foreign zones, which were traditionally more tolerant. One male bar patron said Korean bar culture was not as direct as in the United States, with customers indicating their interest in another customer by ordering him a drink through a waiter. The oldest lesbian bar in Seoul is Lesbos, which started in 1996.

===Spain===
Under the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco from 1939 to 1975, homosexuality was illegal. However, in 1962, Spain&#x27;s first gay bar, Tony&#x27;s, opened in Torremolinos and a clandestine gay bar scene also emerged in the 1960s and early 1970s in Barcelona.

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan, Gay bar culture was first brought to Taiwan by the US military stationed in the 1960s. In the 1970s, the first gay bar &quot;Take&quot; appeared in Taipei. At the same time, lesbians often held activities in American military bars and gay bars. It was not until 1985 that the first lesbian bar &quot;Forgettable Valley&quot; appeared. After the mid-1980s, Gay bars and T-bars sprouted up like mushrooms after a rain. In addition to Taipei, they also began to appear in Taichung and Kaohsiung. The style has also become diversified from simply drinking and chatting. For example, Funky in the 1990s divided its business hours into singing hours and dancing hours.

In the early 2000s, the human rights of gays and lesbians in Taiwan improved significantly. The gay nightlife entertainment scene shifted from being a scene opened by gays and only having gay customers. Some non-gay-only nightclubs were considered gay nightclubs because they gathered a large number of gays. Representative stores are TeXound and 2F.

Starting in 2007, gay bars began to move into the Ximen Red House, which was not operating well at that time. Relying on the gay customer base, this place gradually gathered a lot of popularity and became the first openly gay business district in Taiwan. Nowadays, Ximen Red House Bar Street is a must-visit attraction for gays from all over the world when visiting Taiwan.

Currently, the representative gay bars include Abrazo Bistro, Bacio Taipei, Belle&#x27;s, Commander D, Fairy Taipei, G-Star, Ganymede, Hunt and Locker Room. There are also many small gay bars in Ximen Red House.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the 18th century, molly houses were clandestine clubs where gay men could meet, drink, dance and have sex with each other. One of the most famous was Mother Clap&#x27;s Molly House.

The first gay bar in Britain in the modern sense was The Cave of the Golden Calf, established as a night club in London. It opened in an underground location at 9 Heddon Street, just off Regent Street, in 1912 and became a haunt for the wealthy, aristocratic and bohemian. Its creator Frida Strindberg née Uhl set it up as an avant-garde and artistic venture. The club provided a solid model for future nightclubs.

After homosexuality was partially decriminalized in the UK in 1967, gay bar culture became more visible and gradually Soho became the centre of the London LGBTQ+ community, which was &quot;firmly established&quot; by the early 1990s. Gay bars, cafes, restaurants and clubs are centred on Old Compton Street.

Other cities in the UK also have districts or streets with a concentration of gay bars, like for example Stanley Street Quarter in Liverpool, the Merchant City in Glasgow, Canal Street in Manchester and the Birmingham Gay Village.

=== United States ===

There are many institutions in the United States that claim to be the oldest gay bar in the country. Since Prohibition ended in 1933, there are a number of notable gay bars that have opened. In alphabetical order:
* The Atlantic House in Provincetown, Massachusetts, was constructed in 1798 and was a tavern and stagecoach stop before becoming a &quot;de facto&quot; gay bar after artists and actors, including Tennessee Williams, began spending summers in Provincetown in the 1920s.
* The Black Cat Bar, founded in 1906 and operated again after Prohibition was ended in 1933, was located in San Francisco&#x27;s North Beach neighborhood and was the focus of one of the earliest victories of the homophile movement. In 1951, the California Supreme Court affirmed the right of homosexuals to assemble in a case brought by the heterosexual owner of the bar.
* The Black Cat Tavern opened in November 1966 and was one of many LGBTQ+ bars to be raided, which happened on New Year&#x27;s Day in 1967. It is now considered a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.

* Cafe Lafitte in Exile in New Orleans, dating back to 1933 and the end of Prohibition, claims to be the oldest continuously operating gay bar in the United States.
* The Double Header in Seattle&#x27;s Pioneer Square is claimed to be the oldest gay bar on the North American West Coast, operating since 1933.
* Esta Noche was the first gay Latino bar in San Francisco; it opened in 1979. It was located on Mission Street and 16th Street. It closed down in 1997 as one of the last gay Latino bars in the Mission District. 
* Eve&#x27;s Hangout was one of the first lesbian bars, also called Eve Adams Tearoom. It closed after a police raid in 1926. Eva Kotchever, the owner, was deported to Europe and murdered at Auschwitz.
* Julius Bar, founded by local socialite Matthew Nicol, is the first modern gay bar in New York City. It is where the Mattachine Society staged a &quot;Sip-In&quot; on 21 April 1966 challenging a New York State Liquor Authority rule that prohibited serving alcoholic beverages to gays on the basis that they were considered disorderly. The court ruling in the case that gays could peacefully assemble at bars would lead to the opening of the Stonewall Inn a block southwest in 1967, which in turn led to the 1969 Stonewall Riots. Julius is New York City&#x27;s oldest continuously operating gay bar.
* Korner Lounge (1933) of Shreveport, Louisiana is believed to be the second oldest continuously operating gay bar in the country.
* Maud&#x27;s Study (961 Cole Street, San Francisco), featured in the film &quot;Last Call at Maud&#x27;s&quot;, was a lesbian bar which was founded by Rikki Streicher in 1966 and closed in September 1989. At closing, it claimed to be the oldest continuously operating lesbian bar. It closed during the AIDS crisis when a &quot;clean and sober&quot; mentality drove down a lot of bars.
* Nob Hill (1101 Kenyon St NW) In Washington D.C was a gay bar dedicated to providing a safe space for queer African-American men. Due to segregation many gay bars in the U.S were centered around white queer people but from 1957-2004 Nob Hill was a space for Black queer people to celebrate. Nobb Hill was run for and by Black queer men and was one of the longest gay nightlife establishments in D.C and the entire country. 
* The White Horse Inn in Oakland, California, operating legally since the end of Prohibition, but also likely illegally during it, claims to be the oldest gay bar in operation in the U.S.

== HIV/AIDS impact==
Gay bars have been heavily impacted by the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS with both potential risk and crucial community support and education.

San Francisco had over 100 gay bars when the epidemic first hit in the early 1980s; by 2011 there were only about 30 remaining. During the worst years of the epidemic (before affordable and effective treatment), millions of gay men around the world died; consequently fewer persons owned or patronized gay bars.

=== Sexually transmitted infections ===
A 2009 study revealed a correlation between gay bar attendance and certain high-risk sexual behaviors. Specifically, the research indicated that individuals who frequented gay bars were more likely to engage in insertive unprotected anal intercourse, including with partners whose HIV status differed from their own.

=== HIV-affected community ===
Gay bars have always been a place of refuge and support for gay men and the HIV-affected community impacted by the virus. Cure fundraising, testing, support group, and free condom events have been present at gay bars.

== Today ==

Some commentators have suggested that gay bars are facing decline in the contemporary age due to the pervasiveness of technology. Andrew Sullivan argued in his 2005 essay &quot;The End of Gay Culture&quot; that gay bars are declining because &quot;the Internet dealt them a body blow. If you are merely looking for sex or a date, the Web is now the first stop for most gay men&quot;.

June Thomas explained the decline by noting that there is less need for gay-specific venues like bars because gay people are less likely to encounter discrimination or be made unwelcome in wider society. &quot;Entrepreneur&quot; magazine in 2007 included them on a list of ten types of business that would be extinct by 2017 along with record stores, used bookstores and newspapers.

Some commentators have argued there has been some recent decline in gay-specific venues mainly due to the modern effects of gentrification. As gay men aimed to build physical spaces to host their community, gay bars in urban neighborhoods were introduced to resist homophobia and ground a sense of belonging in the cities they lived and occupied. Gentrification of inner-cities via gay bars is partially a result of the efforts made by the LGBT community to instill hubs. But despite the decline, gay bars still exist in relatively strong numbers and thrive in most major cities where male homosexuality is not heavily condemned. They also asserted many gay men (especially men new to gay nightlife) still find some value in gay-specific venues and being in the company of other gay men. Unlike gay bars, lesbian bars have become a rarity around the world. Many articles have been published discussing possible reasons as to why lesbian bars struggle to exist despite a growing lesbian population.

==Background==

Like most bars and pubs, gay bars range in size from the small, five-seat bars of Tokyo to large, multi-story clubs with several distinct areas and more than one dance floor. A large venue may be referred to as a nightclub, club, or bar, while smaller venues are typically called bars and sometimes pubs. The only defining characteristic of a gay bar is the nature of its clientele. While many gay bars target the gay and/or lesbian communities, some (usually older and firmly established) gay bars have become gay, as it were, through custom, over a long period of time.

The serving of alcohol is the primary business of gay bars and pubs. Like non-gay establishments they serve as a meeting place and LGBTQ+ community focal point, in which conversation, relaxation, and meeting potential romantic and sexual partners is the primary focus of the clientele. Historically and continuing in many communities, gay bars have been valued by patrons as the only place closeted gay men and lesbians can be open and demonstrative about their sexuality without fear of discovery. Gerard Koskovich of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Historical Society explains that &quot;[Gay bars] were a public place where gay people could meet and start to have a conversation, where they didn&#x27;t feel like sexual freaks or somehow not part of the larger social fabric; from that came culture, politics, demands for equal rights.&quot;

Gay bars traditionally preferred to remain discreet and virtually unidentifiable outside the gay community, relying exclusively on word of mouth promotion. More recently, gay clubs and events are often advertised by handing out eye-catching flyers on the street, in gay or gay-friendly shops and venues, and at other clubs and events. Similar to flyers for predominantly heterosexual venues, these flyers frequently feature provocative images and theme party announcements.

While traditional gay pub-like bars are nearly identical to bars catering to the general public, gay dance venues often feature elaborate lighting design and video projection, fog machines and raised dancing platforms. Hired dancers (called go-go girls or go-go boys) may also feature in decorative cages or on podiums. Gay sports bars are relatively unusual, but it is not unusual for gay bars to sponsor teams in local sports/game leagues, and many otherwise traditional gay pubs are well known for hosting post-game parties—often filling with local gay athletes and their fans on specific nights or when major professional sporting events are broadcast on TV. Some of the longest established gay bars are unofficial hosts of elaborate local &#x27;Royal Court&#x27; drag pageants and drag-related social groups.


Gay bars and nightclubs are sometimes segregated by sex. In some establishments, people who are perceived to be of the &quot;wrong&quot; sex (for example, a man attempting to enter a women&#x27;s club) may be unwelcome or even barred from entry. This may be more common in specialty bars, such as gay male leather fetish or BDSM bars, or bars or clubs which have a strict dress code. It is also common in bars and clubs where sex on the premises is a primary focus of the establishment. On the other hand, gay bars are usually welcoming of transgender and cross-dressed people, and drag shows are a common feature in many gay bars, even men-only spaces. Some gay bars and clubs which have a predominantly male clientele, as well as some gay bathhouses and other sex clubs, may offer occasional women-only nights.

A few gay bars attempt to restrict entry to only gay or lesbian people, but in practice this is difficult to enforce. Most famously, Melbourne&#x27;s Peel Hotel was granted an exemption from Australia&#x27;s Equal Opportunities Act by a state tribunal, on the grounds that the exemption was needed to prevent &quot;sexually-based insults and violence&quot; aimed at the pub&#x27;s patrons. As a result of the decision, the pub is legally able to advertise as a &quot;gay only&quot; establishment, and door staff can ask people whether they are gay before allowing them inside, and can turn away non-gay people.

Already categorized as gay or lesbian, many gay bars in larger cities/urban areas take this sub-categorization a step further by appealing to distinct subcultures within the gay community. Some of these sub-cultures are defined by costume and performance. These bars often forge a like-minded community in dozens of cities with leather gay bars, line-dancing gay bars, and drag revues. Other subcultures cater to men who fit a certain type, one that is often defined by age, body type, personality, and musical preference. There are some bars and clubs that cater more to a working class/blue collar crowd and some that cater to a more upscale clientele. There are gay bars that cater to &quot;twinks&quot; (young, smooth-bodied ) and others that cater to bears (older, larger, hairier alternatives to the well-manicured and fey gay stereotype). There are also gay bars that cater to certain races, such as ones for Asian men &quot;and their admirers&quot;, Latin men, or black men.

=== Gay cruise bar ===
A variation of the gay bar is the gay cruise bar. Normally gay bars usually prohibit sexual activity other than kissing or flirting on the premises, however cruise bars allow sex to happen on their property. Cruise bars have a secured entrance door so that only adults can enter, a cloakroom area to allow patrons to change, and seating that allow sexual activity to happen. There is usually an entrance change, however on special occasions it is waived. Mobile phones are banned for privacy reasons. Notable cruise bars include Vault 139 and Bunker Bar in London.

==Music==

Music, either live or, more commonly, mixed by a disc jockey (DJ), is often a prominent feature of gay bars. Typically, the music in gay bars include pop, dance, contemporary R&amp;B, house, trance, and techno. In larger North American cities and in Australia, one or more gay bars with a country music theme and line dancing are also common, as are bars known for retro 1960s pop and &quot;Motown Sound.&quot;

<text>The Saint was an American gay nightclub, located in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. It operated from 1980 to 1988.

== History ==
It opened in the old premises of the Fillmore East, a 1926-built, former-theater-turned-classic-rock-and-roll venue of the late 1960s and early 1970s, at 105 Second Avenue at 6th Street. The Saint was opened by Bruce Mailman and his business partner and his architectural designer, Charles Terrell.

The original opening date was set for July 30, 1980, but construction delays forced a deferral to September 20, 1980, with Alan Dodd as disc jockey. The nightclub was a success even before it opened. Membership packs with floor plans were distributed and before the club opened 2,500 memberships had been sold at $150 each for the first 700 members and for $250 for the rest, with a waiting list established.

It was financed in large part by Mailman&#x27;s other gay venture, the nearby New St. Marks Baths – a gay mecca at the time. The nightclub&#x27;s renovation cost $4.5 million, being $2 million over budget ($17 million at 2017 prices). Money was spent repairing the roof, paying six years of back taxes to the city and fitting out the interior. It opened initially as a private membership gay nightclub (returning the idea of a club to &quot;nightclub&quot;), and set the standard for disco presentation, lighting, sound system, hydraulics and technical support.

However, by the end of its second season, AIDS had begun eating through the fabric of gay life in New York City and began to take a heavy and relentless toll on the Saint&#x27;s membership. Change came quickly. Membership costs were lowered and the season extended into the summer so that the club was open almost all year round. By its seventh season, membership costs had fallen to $50. It also opened weekly for a straight crowd. Furthermore, by 1985, the Black Party performers were for the first time required to perform safe sex. By 1987, the performance emphasised masturbation, phone sex and mud wrestling, all a far cry from the club&#x27;s early days which, on one celebrated occasion, a boa constrictor was used as a prop.

==Venue==
The circular dance floor () was topped by a perforated planetarium dome in diameter and high. In addition to hiding the speakers, the dome served as a spectacular palette for the lighting effects. A circular opening at the top of the dome could be automatically opened and closed to allow a large mirrored disco ball to be lowered into the space. The speaker cabinets were located on, and attached directly to, the outer surface of the dome, creating a very euphonic &quot;surround sound&quot; effect, the sound system in the club consisted of 500 speakers generating 26,000 watts. In the center of the dance floor was a circular light tree constructed on a hydraulic lift. It contained 1,500 lights and as its centerpiece was a rotating, dual Spitz Space System hemisphere star projector, ten times brighter than those used in planetariums. Mailman had initially approached Zeiss regarding the purchase of a star-projection system, but the company refused to sell one, believing its use in a gay club would be an inappropriate use for their system.

Directly underneath the dance-floor level was a large lounge with several juice bars. Beer on tap was sometimes served for free to avoid the licensing oversight of the New York State Liquor Authority. Above and outside the dome was what would become the controversial balcony, where patrons could see down to the dance floor, through the scrim of the dome. It was there that men relaxed and, according to the sexual mores of the times, could indulge in sexual activities. Several times during the year, themed parties such as the &quot;Black Party&quot; and the &quot;White Party&quot; attracted celebrities from around the world.

==DJs==
The Saturday night DJs at the nightclub included Jim Burgess, Roy Thode, Alan Dodd, Robbie Leslie, Mark Thomas, Terry Sherman, Shaun Buchanan, Michael Fierman, Warren Gluck, Wayne Scott, Chuck Parsons, Michael Cavalone, Nao Nakamura and Sharon White. The lighting was operated by Marsha Stern, Richard Tucker, Mark Ackerman, Jorge Villardell, Richard Erskine, Tony DeVizia and Richard Sabala.

<text>A Nissen hut is a prefabricated steel structure originally for military use, especially as barracks, made from a 210° portion of a cylindrical skin of corrugated iron. It was designed during the First World War by the Canadian-American-British engineer and inventor Major Peter Norman Nissen. It was used also extensively during the Second World War and was adapted as the similar Quonset hut in the United States.

==Description==
A Nissen hut is made from a sheet of metal bent into half a cylinder and planted in the ground with its axis horizontal. The cross-section is slightly more than a semi-circle so that the bottom of the hut curves inwards slightly. The exterior is formed from curved corrugated steel sheets by , laid with a two-corrugation lap at the side and a overlap at the ends. Three sheets cover the arc of the hut. They are attached to five wooden purlins and wooden spiking plates at the ends of the floor joists.

The purlins are attached to eight T-shaped ribs () set at centres. Each rib consists of three sections bolted together using splice plates, and each end is bolted to the floor at the bearers. With each rib are two straining wires, one on each side, and a straining ratchet (or in some cases a simple fencing-wire strainer). The wires are strained during construction. The straining wires do not appear in the original Nissen patent.

The purlins are attached to the ribs using a &quot;hook&quot; bolt, which hooks through a pre-drilled hole in the rib and is secured into the purlin. The hook bolt is a unique feature of the Nissen design.

Interior lining could be horizontal corrugated iron or material like hardboard attached to the ribs. Sometimes corrugated asbestos cement sheeting was used. If required, the space between the lining and the exterior may be used for insulation and services.

The walls and floors rest on foundations consisting of 4 × 4 inch (10 × 10 cm) stumps with 15 × 9 inch (38 × 23 cm) sole plates. On these are 4 × 3 inch (10 × 8 cm) bearers and 4 × 2 inch (10 × 5 cm) joists at 2 feet 10 inch (86 cm) centres. The floor is made from tongue and groove floorboards.

At each end the walls are made from a wooden frame with weatherboards nailed to the outside.

Windows and doors may be added to the sides by creating a dormer form by adding a frame to take the upper piece of corrugated iron and replacing the lower piece with a suitable frame for a door or window.

Nissen huts come in three internal spans (diameters)—, , and . The longitudinal bays come in multiples of , allowing the length of the cylinder to be any multiple of that.

The corrugated steel half-circles used to build Nissen huts can be stored efficiently because the curved sheets can be cupped one inside another. However, there is no standard model of Nissen hut, because the design was never static and changed according to demand.

==History==
Between 16 and 18 April 1916, Major Peter Norman Nissen of the 29th Company Royal Engineers of the British Army began to experiment with hut designs. Nissen, a mining engineer and inventor, constructed three prototype semi-cylindrical huts. The semi-cylindrical shape was derived from the drill-shed roof at Queen&#x27;s University, Kingston, Ontario (collapsed 1896). Nissen&#x27;s design was subject to intensive review by his fellow officers, Lieutenant Colonels Shelly, Sewell and McDonald, and General Clive Gerard Liddell, which helped Nissen develop the design. After the third prototype was completed, the design was formalized and the Nissen hut was put into production in August 1916. At least 100,000 were produced in the First World War.

Nissen patented his invention in the UK in 1916 and patents were taken out later in the United States, Canada, South Africa and Australia. Nissen received royalties from the British government, not for huts made during the war, but only for their sale after the conflict. Nissen received some £13,000 and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).

Two factors influenced the design of the hut. First, the building had to be economical in its use of materials, especially considering wartime shortages of building material. Second, the building had to be portable. This was particularly important in view of the wartime shortages of shipping space. This led to a simple form that was prefabricated for ease of erection and removal. The Nissen hut could be packed in a standard Army wagon and erected by six men in four hours. The world record for erection is 1 hour 27 minutes.

Production of Nissen huts waned between the wars, but was revived in 1939. Nissen Buildings Ltd. waived its patent rights for wartime production during the Second World War (1939–45). Similar-shaped hut types were developed as well, notably the larger Romney hut in the UK and the Quonset hut in the United States. All types were mass-produced in the thousands. The Nissen hut was used for a wide range of functions; apart from accommodation, they functioned as churches and bomb stores among other uses. Accounts of life in the hut generally were not positive. Huts in the United Kingdom were frequently seen as cold and draughty, while those in the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific were seen as stuffy and humid.

== Use as family housing ==

Although the prefabricated hut was conceived to meet wartime demand for accommodation, similar situations, such as construction camps, are places where prefabricated buildings are useful. The Nissen hut was adapted into a larger prefabricated two-storey house and marketed by Nissen-Petren Ltd. Four of the original prototypes survive in Queen Camel in Somerset. The standard Nissen hut was often recycled into housing. A similar approach was taken with the U.S. Quonset hut at the end of the war, with articles on how to adapt the buildings for domestic use appearing in &quot;Home Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;.

In Aultbea on Loch Ewe, in Scotland, a large Nissen hut cinema built by the Royal Navy was donated to the village after the Second World War, and remains in use as a community hall. Nissen hut houses survive in Hvalfjörður, Iceland. They were built to house naval personnel during the war. 
However, the adaptation of the semi-cylindrical hut to non-institutional uses was not popular. Neither the Nissen nor the Quonset developed into popular housing, despite their low cost. One reason was the association with huts: a hut was not a house, with all the status a house implies. The second point was that rectangular furniture does not fit into a curved-wall house very well, and, thus, the actual usable space in a hut might be much less than supposed.

In the UK, after the Second World War many were converted for agricultural or industrial purposes, and numerous examples have since been demolished.

In Pune, India, some Nissen huts were provided to persons who lost their homes due to floods caused by the Panshet Dam burst in 1961. Some of these huts are still occupied and in use as homes.

==Use in Australia==

In Australia, after the war, Nissen huts were erected at many migrant camps around the country.

Most post-Second World War Nissen huts were used by governments. However, there is one block that was built as private housing. Fifty Nissen huts were constructed in Belmont North, a suburb of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia. They were designed to provide cheap, ready-made housing for post-war British migrant families. Seventeen of the huts have been demolished over the years, but the remainder have been refurbished, improved and extended and remain popular with their owners. However attempts to have the remaining huts heritage listed in 2009 failed in the face of opposition from some owners.

The story of Western Australia&#x27;s post-War migrants has been marked with the state heritage-listing of the remaining parts of the former Main Roads Migrant Camp in Narrogin, Western Australia. The camp housed European migrants who had been displaced by the war and resettled in Western Australia, then employed in road construction. The Australian Government worked with the United Nations to accept, resettle and provide employment for many thousands of Europeans after the Second World War.

Immigrants were housed in Nissen huts at Holmesglen, in south east Melbourne until the early 1970s when they were demolished to make way for native parklands. A unique example still exists along nearby High Street Road in Ashwood where the hut is occupied by a bottle shop.

Main Roads was one of three migrant camps set up in Narrogin in the late 1940s and used until the mid-1950s. The camp&#x27;s conditions were basic, with migrants living in tents and Nissen huts. The three Nissen huts are the only ones to survive. Post-war migrants played a vital role in the development of the state through the construction of state and local government buildings, roads and railways. Today, the place is used by Main Roads Western Australia as its Wheatbelt South Region Headquarters.

<doc id="501565" wikidata="Q816353" url="?curid=501565" title="Bemani">
<text>, stylized as BEMANI, is Konami&#x27;s music video game division. Originally named the Games &amp; Music Division (G.M.D.), it changed its name in honor of its first and most successful game, &quot;Beatmania&quot;, and expanded into other music-based games, most notably rhythm games such as &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;, &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot;, and &quot;DrumMania&quot;.

==Current Bemani games==
Since 1997, Konami has released many different series of music games under the Bemani brand. Each series has a unique way of playing the game and detaches players from the typical hand held controller of modern game systems by using their whole body to control the game. &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; lets players dance with their feet, &quot;Beatmania&quot; gives players a DJ style mixing board complete with turntable, &quot;ParaParaParadise&quot; is controlled with the players hands and arm by setting off motion sensors during the dance routine, and &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; &amp; &quot;DrumMania&quot; let players use simplified instruments to create music. Below are the Bemani series of video games in alphabetical order.

===&quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot;===

Continuing the &quot;Beatmania&quot; series, &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; (typically pronounced &quot;Two Dee Ecks&quot;) was released in 1999. The rules of the game remain the same from &quot;Beatmania&quot; with the addition of two more keys giving players seven keys to play with along with the turntable. &quot;IIDX&quot; stands for 2 Deluxe, &quot;Beatmania 2 Deluxe&quot;, as Konami gave the series an entire internal and external makeover. The deluxe versions of the arcade machines were bulked up with larger displays, a platform for players to stand on and literally feel the bass of the music, and other amenities. As time went on Konami ceased production of the standard cabinet and went exclusively with the deluxe cabinet.

&quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; has been released on the PlayStation 2 and PC platforms for home players and continues to this day with arcade releases worldwide. In 2006, the game was released on the PlayStation 2 in North America for the first time, simply titled &quot;Beatmania&quot;.

===&quot;Dance Around&quot;===

&quot;Dance Around&quot;, stylized as &quot;DANCE aROUND&quot;, was released on March 3, 2022, in Japan. Internationally, it was released on June 6, 2022, in North America, and in December 2022 in China. The game is named after Round One arcades, and it is exclusive to these arcades. &quot;Dance Around&quot; uses a pair of cameras mounted on either side of the cabinet to detect the player&#x27;s body using parallax. &quot;Dance Around&quot; is considered by fans to be a spiritual sequel to Bemani&#x27;s own &quot;Dance Masters&quot; and &quot;Dance Evolution Arcade&quot;, and is also comparable to the &quot;Just Dance&quot; game series.

===&quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;===

&quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;, often initialized to &quot;DDR&quot; and also known in Europe as &quot;Dancing Stage&quot;, was first produced in 1998. The game is played by stepping to music on a dance platform with four pressure-sensitive arrow pads. The game has changed little since its introduction but has come a long way in terms of musical selection and visual appearance. While originally an arcade title, many versions of &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; have been released on many different platforms including the Sony PlayStation 2, Sega Dreamcast, Nintendo Wii, and Microsoft Xbox. Other versions have also appeared on portable handhelds, cell phones, and as standalone TV plug&#x27;n&#x27;play devices. &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; is commonly considered to be the most well-known BEMANI series outside of Japan.

===&quot;Dance Rush&quot;===
&quot;Dance Rush Stardom&quot;, stylized as &quot;DANCERUSH STARDOM&quot;, was first released on March 23, 2018. It is marketed as a shuffle dancing simulator, and encourages the players to learn several real-life moves, such as the running man, the crab step, the SpongeBob, and the Charleston. It uses a Microsoft Kinect-like body tracking camera and a dance platform powered by an IR frame. In addition, &quot;Dance Rush&quot; has five buttons for navigating the menu, but not used during gameplay.

In &quot;Dance Rush,&quot; the player is given a set of prompts that scroll down the timeline, and must match the horizontal foot positions by stepping in the right place on the platform, sliding their feet left and right, or keeping their feet off the platform by jumping. In addition, the game also detects the speed at which the player&#x27;s center of gravity moves, requiring the player to go &quot;DOWN&quot; in time with the prompts.

Similar to other Bemani series like &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; and &quot;Dance Evolution&quot;, &quot;Dance Rush&quot; has three game modes: Light (up to two songs, or only one in South Korea), Standard (up to two songs, plus Extra Stage if the total score for the two songs exceeds 180.000) and Premium (record any one song fulfilling the license terms and upload them to YouTube).

&quot;Dance Rush&quot; also has a cooperative 2-player mode, where one player uses the front half of the platform and the other uses the back half, as well as a head-to-head battle mode using two separate cabinets. The two modes can even be activated at the same time, resulting in a 2v2 cooperative multiplayer game.

===&quot;Gitadora&quot; (&quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; and &quot;DrumMania&quot;)===

Also known as &quot;Gitadora&quot; in Japan, the combined series of &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; and &quot;DrumMania&quot; are games that use simplified instruments after their namesake. &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; uses a small, plastic guitar with three buttons known as &quot;frets&quot;, a strum bar, and a motion sensor that players set off by pulling the neck of the guitar up and quickly down again. Despite the similarities, &quot;Guitar Freaks&quot; predates &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; by several years; in fact, the heads of RedOctane, Charles and Kai Huang, were reportedly inspired by the &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; gameplay to develop the Western game&#x27;s guitar peripheral and pitch its gameplay proposal for what would eventually become &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;.

&quot;Drum Mania&quot; lets players play a set of drums. Modeled after modern digital drum kits, the player strikes the appropriate piece with the drumsticks on cue with the music and failure to do so causes the song to sound incorrect. Many American players will recognize the &quot;Drum Mania&quot; setup from more recent games like &quot;Rock Band&quot;, which is unrelated to the Konami game.

Similar to the 5-key to 7-key upgrade from &quot;Beatmania&quot; to &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot;, &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; and &quot;DrumMania&quot; received a major gameplay overhaul with the 2010 release of &quot;GuitarFreaks XG&quot; and &quot;DrumMania XG&quot;, with a total of five frets and nine drums respectively. While standard &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; and &quot;DrumMania&quot; games were originally being released alongside the XG games, the latter has now become the primary focus of the series, with the last standard series game being V8, released in 2011. The XG series was rebranded in 2013 as simply &quot;GITADORA&quot;.

Despite being separately released games that can be played independent of each other, Konami markets the &quot;GITADORA&quot; series as a pair that can be linked for co-operative play in the arcades. The two series continue to be released to this day.

===&quot;Jubeat&quot;===
Announced on December 22, 2007, &quot;Jubeat&quot; (pronounced &quot;you beat&quot;, title changed to &quot;UBeat&quot; and &quot;Jukebeat&quot; in the American test releases) is similar to Whac-A-Mole, where players must tap the square-shaped panels on a touch screen when they light up. It was released in Japan in July 2008. A localized version of the game for North America was announced the month after with tests held at an arcade in Southern California alongside &quot;Dance Dance Revolution X&quot;. After two separate testing phases Konami canceled all plans to release the game in North American Arcades. &quot;Jubeat&quot; arcade presence is localized in Japan and several East Asian countries. Free-to-Play adaptations for mobile were eventually released in 2010. Japan received Jubeat Plus, available for iOS and Android. International regions received a localized version called &quot;Jukebeat&quot;, available solely on iOS. While the apps may appear similar, &quot;Jukebeat&quot; songlist is far more restricted and features different licences.

===&quot;NOSTALGIA&quot;===

 was first released on March 1, 2017, available as an upgrade kit for &quot;BeatStream&quot; cabinets or as a new machine. The game serves as a spiritual successor to &quot;Keyboardmania&quot;, with its gameplay involving a keyboard-esque controller used to hit notes coming from the top of the screen. Unlike &quot;Keyboardmania&quot; though, the player does not have to hit a specific key, just one in the note&#x27;s general area. Only one row of keys is used as well; while the cabinet does have black keys, they are solely for decoration. The touchscreen used by &quot;BeatStream&quot; is reused to navigate the game&#x27;s interface. Similar to &quot;Keyboardmania&quot;, &quot;Real&quot; charts requires players to know how to play the piano in order to easily pass the songs.

===&quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot;===
Released in 1998, &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot; is like a simplified &quot;Beatmania&quot;. With larger, colorful buttons, no turntable, and easier note patterns, &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot; presents players with a more childlike appearance. However &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot; is viewed as every bit as difficult as &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot;, with modes that use up to nine hand buttons at once, and having some songs that aren&#x27;t keysounded. &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot; is stylized with cute cartoony characters and a musical selection to match. The series continues to this day as one of the most popular Bemani games.

=== &quot;Sound Voltex&quot; ===
&quot;SOUND VOLTEX&quot; was first released on January 18, 2012. Its gameplay involves four white buttons, two orange &quot;FX&quot; buttons, and two knobs, one blue and one pink. While the white and orange buttons are simply pressed or held, the knobs must be adjusted on cue with blue and pink lasers which quickly move left and right across the track. Similar to &quot;beatmania&quot;, this gameplay is meant to mimic a DJ controller, but places more focus on layering effects over the music. Besides music featured in other BEMANI series, many songs are arrangements of music from &quot;Touhou Project&quot;, and some are produced by Vocaloid artists. SOUND VOLTEX also holds regular song contests, officially called &quot;SOUND VOLTEX FLOOR&quot;, in which fans submit original songs or artwork for a chance to be part of the game&#x27;s extensive songlist.

==Inactive Bemani games==
===&quot;Beatmania&quot;===

Modeled after nightclub DJs and mixing boards, &quot;Beatmania&quot;, known as &quot;Hip Hop Mania&quot; in North America and &quot;Beatstage&quot; in Korea, allows the player to &quot;spin&quot; the music with five activator keys and a turntable. The &quot;Beatmania&quot; series was the first Bemani game introduced and its successor is still the most popular Bemani game in Japan. With numerous releases in arcades and on video game platforms &quot;Beatmania&quot; set itself as a role model for future Bemani titles. The music featured in this series of games is still in use today in &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; and other Bemani games.

===&quot;Beatmania III&quot;===

Built off the &quot;Beatmania&quot; gameplay, &quot;Beatmania III&quot; added a foot pedal to the five keys and turntable used by players. The &quot;Beatmania III&quot; series was short lived with only a few releases and a series run of only two years, ending in 2002. Many songs from &quot;Beatmania III&quot; were ported to the IIDX series as well as other Bemani games.

===&quot;BeatStream&quot;===

Released on July 17, 2014, and discontinued on March 1, 2017, its gameplay involves hitting notes that come from eight directions to an octagonal judgment lines within a wide touch panel. The notes have several types: some need to be held down, and some need to be slid. Similar to &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot;, the player starts with 30% clear gauge (represented by a ring in the middle of the screen) and have to obtain at least 70% by the end of the game to pass the stage. The music library features a good number of songs from Vocaloid and &quot;Touhou Project&quot;, like &quot;Sound Voltex&quot;, but &quot;BeatStream&quot; does have its fair share of original songs. e-Amusement support for &quot;BeatStream&quot; ended on September 1, 2017, discontinuing most cabinets that require constant e-Amusement connection, rendering the game unable to run after boot and recycling cabinets for other games.

===&quot;Bemani Pocket&quot;===
Similar in style to &quot;Tamagotchi&quot; handhelds, the &quot;Bemani Pocket&quot; series released small, handheld versions of &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;, &quot;Beatmania&quot;, and &quot;ParaParaParadise&quot; intended to be played with one&#x27;s fingers. Rarer &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot; and &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; variants were produced later on.

===&quot;Dance Dance Revolution Solo&quot;===
An offshoot of the &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; series, &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Solo&quot; added two additional arrows to the dance stage, but supported only single-player gameplay. The &quot;Solo&quot; series saw two major releases and two complementary releases before being canceled in 2001. Most of the music exclusive to &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Solo&quot; was reused in the main &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; series.

===&quot;Dance Maniax&quot;===

&quot;Dance Maniax&quot; is an arcade video game controlled by two pairs of infrared motion sensors that detect movement of arms and legs. Several versions have been produced in 2000 and 2001. Instead of the usual concept of dropping notes in the genre (like Beatmania), they scroll up to the top of the screen instead. They can be judged as a &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;miss&quot;, depending on the timing accuracy. The game featured a song list from Konami&#x27;s in-house artists and Dancemania music label.

===&quot;Dance Masters&quot; and &quot;Dance Evolution&quot;===
A Kinect-based game called &quot;Dance Evolution Arcade&quot; is also considered a part of Bemani series, previously being exclusive to Xbox 360. It was released on March 27, 2012. Its gameplay is similar to the original game, in which players must follow the in-game character&#x27;s movements by touching and drawing line on the air correspondingly with the movement. The game ceased receiving e-Amusement service on August 31, 2016, discontinuing most cabinets that require constant e-Amusement connection, installing the offline patch and effectively terminating support for the game.

===&quot;Keyboardmania&quot;===
A MIDI synthesizer game. &quot;Keyboardmania&quot; features a mini-musical keyboard and players create the primarily piano based music by striking the keys to the note patterns on the screen. &quot;Keyboardmania&quot; saw only three major releases before being canceled but features exceptionally difficult and unique gameplay for the Bemani series of games. &quot;Real Mode&quot; actually requires players to know how to play the piano in order to easily pass the songs.

&quot;Keyboardmania&quot; can be multi-session linked with certain versions of the &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; and &quot;DrumMania&quot; series.

===&quot;Martial Beat&quot;===
&quot;Martial Beat&quot; was designed for the PlayStation in Japan in 2001. It is based on the players&#x27; actions by use of wristband sensors. The game was shipped in a modified &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; cabinet, with the sensors and the game&#x27;s art on it. Although there are two sets of selection buttons (as &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; supported two players), the game is one player only. To play the game, one needs to follow the on-screen instructor, and when a red light turns on located on top of the screen, the player must perform the move by repeating the instructor.

===&quot;Mirai Dagakki FutureTomTom&quot;===

&quot;Mirai Dagakki (ミライダガッキ) FutureTomTom&quot; was first released on June 20, 2013. Its gameplay involves hitting drums to match the notes on the screen, akin to &quot;Taiko no Tatsujin&quot;. The game ceased receiving e-Amusement service on July 31, 2015, discontinuing most cabinets that require constant e-Amusement connection, installing the offline patch and effectively terminating support for the game.

===&quot;MÚSECA&quot;===

First released on December 10, 2015, after five location tests, &quot;MÚSECA&quot; gameplay involves a pedal and five spinners which can be pressed, held or rotated, depending on the note type. One of &quot;MÚSECA&quot; most important aspects are the illustrations named Grafica. A Grafica gives the player GIFTs, which are in-game bonuses that are auto-triggered at some points of the charts, slightly modifying the chart lane&#x27;s judgment line. GIFTs include Life Support, Score Gain, Play Risk, and Item Collect. Most Grafica characters have their own voices that play when they&#x27;re triggered in-game. The game ceased receiving e-Amusement service on July 31, 2018, discontinuing most cabinets that require constant e-Amusement connection, installing the offline patch, recycling some cabinets for other games and effectively terminating support for the game.

===&quot;Para Para Paradise&quot;===
Built around the Para Para dance style made popular in Japan, &quot;Para Para Paradise&quot; recreates official dance moves within the game by setting off arrows on screen by using players&#x27; hands under a set of motion sensors. The music in the game centers around Eurobeat and features songs from Konami and Avex Trax. Only three versions of the game were released as Para Para dancing fell out of mainstream popularity in Japan, and the series never saw light outside of the country beyond music game importers and localized Korean versions of the arcade machines.

===&quot;Pop&#x27;n Stage&quot;===
Combining game elements from &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; and &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot;, &quot;Pop&#x27;n Stage&quot; takes the colorful buttons and lets players play the game on a stage with their feet. There was only one version of the game released.

===&quot;Reflec Beat&quot;===
&quot;Reflec Beat&quot; was first released on November 4, 2010. Its gameplay is similar to air hockey, but &quot;Reflec Beat&quot; uses fingers. Players must touch circular symbols that match the color of their line moving to the player at the right time. It features a one-on-one matching system. Mobile adaptations for iOS were made in 2011, with Japan receiving &quot;Reflec Beat Plus&quot; and international regions receiving a localized version called &quot;Reflec Beat +&quot; in 2012. Like &quot;Jukebeat&quot;, &quot;Reflec Beat +&quot; contains a more restricted song list, with no licensed tracks at all.

==Bemani artists==
In addition to licensed music tracks, Konami employs a list of in-house artists to produce the music for its Bemani series, which in 2017 started being referred to as the &quot;BEMANI Sound Team&quot;. These artists often go by pseudonyms when credited with their songs. Some of these artists, such as TAG, have broken off to become independent artists.

==Related Konami games==
Not all Konami-produced games involving music or rhythm bear the Bemani name.

===&quot;Polaris Chord&quot;===
&quot;Polaris Chord&quot; is an arcade rhythm game whose controller is made up of a slider consisting of a row of 12 shallow-pitch buttons, and a pair of levers that can be pushed to either side. It is themed after livestreaming, and focuses heavily on VTuber original songs, VTuber covers, Vocaloid, and other online hits. Some prominent VTubers whose songs are featured in the game are Houshou Marine, Tsunomaki Watame, Gawr Gura, and Calliope Mori.

<doc id="501566" wikidata="Q841712" url="?curid=501566" title="Conker's Bad Fur Day">
<text>Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day is a 2001 platform game produced by Rare for the Nintendo 64. The game follows Conker, a greedy, hard-drinking red squirrel who must return home to his girlfriend, Berri after binge drinking. Most of the game requires the player to complete a linear sequence of challenges that involve jumping over obstacles, solving puzzles, and fighting enemies. A multiplayer mode in which up to four players can compete against each other in seven different game types is also included. It is the second installment in the &quot;Conker&quot; series, after &quot;Conker&#x27;s Pocket Tales&quot; (1999).

Although visually similar to Rare&#x27;s previous games, such as &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; (1998), &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; (1999), and &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; (2000), &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; was designed for mature audiences and features graphic violence, alcohol and tobacco use, profanity, dark humor, toilet humor, fourth wall breaks and pop culture references. Development lasted four years, with concepts originating during the development of &quot;Killer Instinct Gold&quot; in 1996. The game, intended for a family audience, was initially titled &quot;Twelve Tales: Conker 64&quot; and was set for release in late 1998, but by the time it received criticism for its kid-friendly tone and resemblance to &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; during E3 1998, the game was transformed into an adult-oriented version of that product.

&quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; was released in March 2001, following an advertising campaign that targeted male college students. It received critical acclaim, with praise directed at its humor, sound, visuals, and gameplay. However, the game sold well below expectations due to limited advertising and a release towards the end of the Nintendo 64&#x27;s life cycle, but has since developed a cult following. A remake, &quot;&quot;, was released for the Xbox in 2005, while the original version was included as part of the &quot;Rare Replay&quot; compilation for Xbox One in 2015.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; is a platform game, its later sections featuring elements of shooters. The player controls Conker the Squirrel through a series of three-dimensional levels. The game features an overworld where players can transition from one level to another, although many are initially blocked off until Conker earns a certain amount of cash. Each level is an enclosed area in which the player can freely explore to find tasks to do. The gameplay mostly relies on figuring out a way to help other characters by completing a linear sequence of challenges. These challenges may include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, gathering objects, and racing opponents, among others. The result is always a cash reward, which aids access to other areas in the overworld.

As compared to the player characters in Rare&#x27;s previous platform games &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; and &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot;, Conker&#x27;s abilities are simpler. The player can run, jump, and smack enemies with a frying pan. Conker can also swim underwater for a limited period of time, climb ladders or ropes, and push objects. To regain lost health, Conker can eat pieces of &quot;anti-gravity&quot; chocolate that are scattered throughout the levels. The game employs &quot;context-sensitive&quot; pads that allow Conker to gain different, temporary abilities when pressing the &quot;B&quot; button atop them. For instance, in the beginning of the game, by pressing the B button on the first pad he encounters, Conker drinks some Alka-Seltzer to wipe out his hangover, at which point players can proceed forward. Some pads can turn Conker into an anvil to slam into the ground, while others pull out his shotgun, blow torch, throwing knives, and slingshot. They also serve to inform players of what needs to be done next.

The game includes a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete against each other in seven different game types: Beach, Raptor, Heist, War, Tank, Race and Deathmatch. In Beach, a team of players must go up through a beach and into a waiting escape vehicle, while another must stop them by firing at them from fixed positions. Raptor involves a team of players controlling raptors to feed a baby dinosaur while another controlling cavemen who have to steal dinosaur eggs. Heist engrosses players in the robbery of a bank, where the goal is to retrieve a cash bag from the centre of the level and run with it to the team&#x27;s vault without being damaged. War can either be a traditional capture the flag mode or Total War, where players have to get the other team&#x27;s gas canister and use it to release a chemical gas that annihilates the enemy. In Tank, players fight using tanks and chemical canisters that release a lethal gas. Race is a racing mode which provides two variations of the same course. Items can be acquired and used against opponents. Finally, Deathmatch is a standard deathmatch mode where players fight against each other in shooting style from a third-person perspective. Players can set multiple options for each game, such as score limit, number of lives, and inclusion of computer-controlled bots.

== Summary ==
=== Setting ===
&quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; is set in the Fairy Panther King&#x27;s Kingdom. Windy is the game&#x27;s main hub with entrances to most other sections: the farm Barn Boys, the poo-filled Sloprano, Heist, the horror-themed Spooky, Bats Tower, and It&#x27;s War. Only one other section requires entering from an area besides Windy: Uga Buga, which must be entered under the bottom of Sloprano by paying the location&#x27;s weasel guards $1,000. Obtaining access to the entrance requires going through a sewer pipe only accessible after defeating a big, opera-singing chunk of poo, named the &quot;Great Mighty Poo&quot;. Windy has a beetle-populated area entirely filled with fecal matter, consisting of a big Poo Mountain and a Poo Cabin and a river next to it. Poo balls are required to enter the Sloprano section within the mountain, and Bats Tower which is only opened once the water in the river is drained. Poo balls are available at Poo Cabin, accessible after completing Barn Boys. The dung beetle near the entrance offers Conker poo balls if he can make the farm cows excrement in the pasture. Doing so involves Conker on the Poo Cabin&#x27;s pasture turning on a big spigot to activate the prune juice (which gives the cows diarrhea), and using a bull to open gates for the cows to get out, as well as to kill the cows once each one finishes defecating. $2,110 is needed to pay Mr. Barrel to propel down a slope and break a barrier to the entrance of Spooky.

=== Plot ===
The morning after a night of binge drinking with his friends, Conker awakes to find himself lost in an unfamiliar land with a terrible hangover. Meanwhile, the Panther King, ruler of the land that Conker is lost in, finds that his throne&#x27;s side table is missing one of its legs and orders his servant, Professor Von Kriplespac, to solve the problem. When Von Kriplespac suggests the use of a red squirrel as the fourth leg of his table, the Panther King sends his minions to capture one. During his quest to return home to his girlfriend Berri, Conker finds wads of cash scattered throughout the land and becomes sidetracked from his goal. This leads him to embroil himself in a series of increasingly absurd and often dangerous situations, including having to recover a beehive from enormous wasps; confronting a giant opera-singing pile of feces called The Great Mighty Poo; being tasked by Don Weaso, the head of the Weasel Mafia, to bomb an entire village of cavemen; being transformed into a bat by his vampiric ancestor Count Batula; and getting drafted into a war between grey squirrels and a Nazi-like group of teddy bears known as the Tediz, which Conker ultimately destroys.

When Conker finds Berri, Don Weaso returns to enlist their help in robbing the Feral Reserve Bank. After entering the vault, Conker and Berri find that the bank scene was an elaborate trap set by the Panther King to capture Conker. In the confrontation, Berri is shot and killed by Weaso on the Panther King&#x27;s orders. The Panther King suddenly begins having chest pains and calls for Von Kriplespac. The Professor stands aside and watches gleefully as a Xenomorph-like creature bursts out of the Panther King&#x27;s chest, killing him instantly. Von Kriplespac explains that the creature, whom he names &quot;Heinrich&quot;, is one of his creations, and that he had planned to use this opportunity to kill the Panther King and escape his captivity. He then reveals that they are inside a spaceship, which he activates and takes into low orbit. From there, he instructs Heinrich to attack and kill Conker as revenge for destroying the Tediz, which were also his creations. Conker opens an airlock, expelling Kriplespac and the Panther King and Berri&#x27;s corpses into space, and then battles Heinrich with the aid of a robotic suit. 

Despite being cast into outer space after the fight, Heinrich manages to crawl back aboard the spaceship. Just as Conker is about to be assaulted by Heinrich, the scene suddenly freezes, and Conker expresses disbelief that Rare did not test the game properly. He summons the programmers, who communicate with him through the command-line interface. Conker promises the programmers not to tell anyone about the terrible lockup left in the game, provided they assist him in dealing with Heinrich. Among many weapons at disposal courtesy of the programmers, Conker picks up a katana and is teleported to the Panther King&#x27;s throne room, where he decapitates Heinrich. Conker is then crowned the new king of the land. Conker, who does not want to go through with this, realises that he should have brought Berri back to life when he was negotiating with the programmers. He then calls out to bring her back to life, only to realise that the programmers have already left. Conker gives a closing monologue, in which he discusses appreciating what one already has instead of always wanting more, stating that &quot;the grass is always greener, and you don&#x27;t know what it is you have until it&#x27;s gone&quot;. After the credits roll, Conker is seen back at the same pub he was seen in at the start of the game. As it begins to storm outside, he drunkenly exits the bar, leaving in the opposite direction he took previously.

== Development ==
=== Early concepts ===
Following the success of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; (1996), a &quot;barn&quot; at Rare began conceiving and designing a similar unnamed &quot;generic 3D platform adventure&quot; during development of &quot;Killer Instinct Gold&quot; (1996). Tim Stamper had planned the game to star a cute squirrel mascot named Conker from the get-go, in order to have the widest possible appeal. The staff of &quot;Project Dream&quot; saw the yet-to-be-named platform game during the creation of its engine, and was inspired to change &quot;Dream&quot; from an RPG to a platforming game in the visual and gameplay style of the &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; team&#x27;s project. Both then-upcoming Rare titles were first announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in June 1997, receiving the names &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; and &quot;Conker&#x27;s Quest&quot;, the first two games presented by Nintendo at the event.

&quot;N64.com&quot; reported &quot;Conker&#x27;s Quest&quot; being a &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;-like game that &quot;make[s] gamers feel as if they&#x27;re playing through Disney&#x27;s movie version of &quot;Bambi&quot;&quot;, where &quot;Conker collects nuts and battles against giants in huge landscapes and is joined by a female squirrel who assists him as he makes his way through the game&quot;. The source reported the cameras being in an unfinished state and journalists unable to differentiate between it and &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, although liking &quot;Banjo&quot; far more. A writer for &quot;Ultra Game Players&quot; also noted it looking similar to &quot;Banjo&quot; and summarised that &quot;Conker has to collect nuts, find new power-ups (in the form of different hats - kind of like &quot;Wario Land&quot;) and generally negotiate colorful 3D landscapes&quot;. He called its gameplay &quot;competent and even addictive&quot; and praised the visuals for &quot;upping the ante on [Rare&#x27;s] previous efforts, where the clipping is better, the textures more varied and the overall look of the game is expansive and colorful&quot;. However, he suggested its &quot;disturbing&quot; cuteness, while gaining Nintendo an audience of younger players, would turn off older players and criticised the gameplay of &quot;Conker&quot; and &quot;Banjo&quot; for being not original enough from &quot;Mario 64&quot;.

At the 1998 Expo, it was revealed that the game&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;Twelve Tales: Conker 64&quot; and the release was set for fall 1998. &quot;64&quot; magazine suspected the name change was to prevent consumers from confusing it with another Nintendo 64 title, &quot;Quest 64&quot; (1998). &quot;Twelve Tales&quot; would have had a single-player mode and two-multiplayer modes. In single-player, the player could play as either Conker or Berri, where Conker&#x27;s segments would be &quot;arcade-style platformer[s]&quot; involving &quot;action and speed&quot; and Berri&#x27;s would be puzzle stages depicting her controlling her dino companion (as well as feeding him) so that he can protect her from enemies. The two multi-player modes would have been a co-operative two-player mode where the players play as Conker and an owl, and a split-screen four-player battle mode where players attack each other with acorns. Conker, unlike &quot;Bad Fur Day&quot;, moved on four legs in &quot;Twelve Tales&quot;.

Coverage upon the game&#x27;s 1998 E3 appearance was generally positive, with focal points including the graphics, characters, content, and the characters changing emotions in reaction to the environment. &quot;Total 64&quot; found the visuals better than Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Zelda&quot; game presented at the Expo, &quot;utilising the N64&#x27;s hi-res mode and displaying some gorgeous textures&quot;; it additionally praised its &quot;highly imaginative&quot; four-player mode and Berri&#x27;s levels. Journalist Andy McDermott appreciated the huge amount of content, in particular the multi-player modes, the two different gameplay styles in the single-player mode and the fact that Conker learns new moves and attacks as the game progresses. Coverage was not without criticisms, however; McDermott disliked its &quot;Americanized&quot; writing that consisted of &quot;colonial-style comments&quot; and the &quot;infuriatingly happy music&quot;, while &quot;Next Generation&quot; called its premise of a squirrel collecting acorns in &quot;stunningly unimaginative forests&quot; a rip-off of Ocean Software&#x27;s 16-bit platform game &quot;Mr. Nutz&quot; (1993). The most frequent skepticism was its kid-friendliness, particularly its consumer interest after the release of other family-friendly platformers like &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; (1998). All of this concerned Rare, a developer which had a history of making games like &quot;Conker&quot;, resulting in a game design overhaul.

=== Transition to an adult game ===
&quot;Conker&quot; was planned to only take two years to make, but fights between workers at the barn delayed the process. Artist Don Murphy found the developing game not very good, and software engineer Chris Marlow said that &quot;there was an awful lot of content and there were lots of fun ideas, but it just really wasn&#x27;t gelling as a finished game&quot;. Additionally, the market for &quot;Mario 64&quot;-style platformers was saturated, and another game of that caliber developed by Rare, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, was already completed and released to critical and commercial success. For the team, either something changed or the team had to split into other barns working on new projects, after having cancelled &quot;Conker&quot;. Multiple delays and a lack of updates led the press to believe that &quot;Twelve Tales&quot; was quietly cancelled.

Chris Seavor, who began working on the project as an artist, then pitched to Rare leaders Tim and Chris Stamper an idea he had since during the &quot;Twelve Tales&quot; phase, a day in the life game named &quot;Bad Fur Day&quot; about Conker trying to help others but causing more problems in doing so. In addition to having a narrative to give the titular character a personality, Seavor wanted to make the game &quot;edgy, in terms of its violence&quot;; the Stampers loved the idea and moved Seavor up to project lead. Seavor&#x27;s first action following the meeting was changing the task &quot;Wasps and the Queen Bee&quot;. Tim Stamper conceived its premise of wasps stealing a beehive, but Seavor noticed no established reasons or punchline behind it. He decided to end it with the beehive having guns shooting at the wasps; the founders loved it and directed the team to &quot;make more of that&quot;. This set the formula for later missions: an introduction, interaction of the mission, and then an &quot;extreme punchline&quot; cutscene as reward for completing the task. It also changed the style of a game to a platformer starring a cute mascot character in an incredibly raunchy world. According to the developers: &quot;We already had the main character (although he was eventually remodeled) and a good deal of code already written, so the best option seemed to be to change the game&#x27;s direction. Mature humor was a key element&quot;.

Rare clarified publicly in January 2000 that the game was &quot;still being worked on by a full team and with the same level of dedication as when it was first announced&quot;.

In 2000, &quot;Twelve Tales: Conker 64&quot; was retooled into &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; with a large amount of scatological humour.

=== Workflow ===
All of &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot;″s staff, including the animators, programmers, and writers, worked in a liberated, non-planned, and intuition-based manner; the cutscene dialogue and gameplay design in particular was spontaneously conceived between the developers with a rough notion of the level&#x27;s story. Out of all the game&#x27;s dialogue, only the intro was scripted. The developers&#x27; ideas were tracked with notepads, as they would describe them verbally while taking notes of what they heard from others. Shawn Pile wrote a language that allowed for changes in the game&#x27;s structures to be done in a few seconds, whereas without it, it would have taken &quot;two-and-a-half to three minutes&quot; to make a change.

=== Writing ===
The beginning, middle and end of the story was done all at the same time, with events written to happen later in the story leading to the inclusion of elements earlier. In order to fit three save files in four kilobytes of SRAM space, the game was broken up into lengthy chapters. Seavor&#x27;s focus on the game, as project lead, was making sure the narrative complemented the gameplay and mechanics: &quot;Just doing a &#x27;thing&#x27; like hitting something with a brick is far more engaging if there&#x27;s a motivation behind it to disguise the binary nature of the act&quot;. For example, the developers originally planned Conker to attack with a baseball bat; this was changed to a frying pan because it justified the use of a comic sound effect of a metal object hitting something.

When designing levels, the developers were originally more focused on the gameplay than the comedy; as development went on, they noticed being less focused on gameplay and more on the comedic premises made the levels come together easier. This especially became evident with the use of film parodies, which Seavor decided on after adding a &quot;Terminator&quot; (1984) reference in the barnyard scene. The parodies helped the developers come up with ideas for music, sound, design, and gameplay. For example, the spoofing of &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999) in a lobby chase scene gave composer and audio engineer Robin Beanland ideas for interactive music, where shooting bullets would fade the channels of the upbeat music into channels playing something more downtempo.

The &quot;Star Wars&quot; series, &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1992), and &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979) are among the films spoofed. &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; begins with a shot-by-shot recreation of the intro of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971). A joke in one of Conker&#x27;s conversations with the catfish references &quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983). The sequences involving the shark-bulldog Brute parodies &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975), particularly featuring music cues similar to that of the film. The final boss fight references &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986), as an alien rips out of the Panther King&#x27;s chest and Conker fights it in a powersuit.

&quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; also satirises conventions of adventure and platform games, occasionally by breaking the fourth wall. Conker makes fun of how menial his missions are, and the villain&#x27;s motivation of getting a table leg pokes at the shallow premises of other games. Burt, a metal box in the &quot;Barn Boys&quot; chapter that stands in place for most of the level, is only there to open a gate, which pokes fun at characters in other games only there to be communicated with for the player to achieve other tasks. The explanation for why floating chocolate bars exist makes fun of floating collect-able items in other games where why they float is not established. The death sequences, where Conker encounters a skeleton named Gregg, was an attempt to make logical the concept of multiple lives. The bosses also take four hits to kill, a twist on the typical three in other video games.

Certain story elements, although not spoofing material, took influence from the works of Monty Python. &quot;The Milk Thing&quot;, a running gag where the Panther King has to be resisted from masturbating, was inspired by a joke just as &quot;trivial and banal&quot; in a skit on &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; (1969–1974) titled &quot;Blancmange Playing Tennis&quot;, while a cow was based on the feminine guard character in &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; (1975). The fart noise segment of &quot;Uncle Fucka&quot; from &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut&quot; (1999) was the inspiration for a level theme (named &quot;Poo&quot;)&#x27;s arrangement consisting of fart noises. Some characters were based on real-life people the developers encountered. Birdy the scarecrow was based on a bearded Rare developer, and Gregg the Grim Reaper was named after Gregg Mayles. The bee king was inspired by a &quot;really scruffy&quot; man Seavor encountered while walking on a street in Nottingham who screamed at him, &quot;don&#x27;t speak to me like that, in my country I am a king.&quot;

=== Programming ===
The developers heavily analysed &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; in making &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot;, especially when it came to the camera. The staff noticed it, along with &quot;Prince of Persia 3D&quot; (1999), used &quot;fixed views&quot; that could not be controlled by the player. To make the game look cinematic, Rare went with having a fixed camera that was very zoomed out. To increase the number of simultaneous light sources to four, one programmer spent four months deciphering and rewriting the Nintendo-supplied Japanese-commented microcode for the Nintendo 64&#x27;s Reality Coprocessor, while another microcoded the support for MP3, reverberation, and Dolby Pro Logic surround sound.

The length of all cutscenes combined total around two hours. Marlow programmed a &quot;cutscene editor&quot; that allowed for separately-made animations, audio files, visual effects, and camera setups to easily be compiled together for cutscenes. However, making cutscenes was still a lengthy process. The editor lacked a feature to preview only bits of cutscenes, meaning they had to be played in their entirety before they could be altered again; this made several small changes (such as text copyedits and adjustments to the timing of speech bubbles to match camera angle changes) very tedious.

The testing for Nintendo&#x27;s Seal of Quality was strict; although the game was tested in the United States for five days with no bugs noticed, it was 24 hours in the Japan unit&#x27;s three-day test that they noticed a problem of a cutscene in the first level not being triggered. Initially, Gregg&#x27;s introductory scene (which is triggered the first time the player dies) was not to be &quot;forced&quot; in the &quot;Spooky&quot; level where the reaper appears again, as the programmers assumed no player would get to it without dying; a tester successfully did, so in the final game, the death scene plays once Conker reaches the stage.

=== Animation ===
Maya was used to create 3D animations. Beanland and animator Louise Ridgeway estimated 8.7 seconds and two-to-three cycles of animation were completed per day. When it came to animation, small details were a priority, such as the Fire Imps reacting if a swear word was entered into the cheat code menu and the camera shaking and triggering a sound effect if hit by an object. This method sometimes led to tedious tasks, such as having to animate each of several bricks on a bridge separately. Some animations, such as drunk character movements, required research. Animating Conker&#x27;s juggling required Ridgeway being taught by David Rose how to juggle.

Conker has 2,000 animations, including 15 idle animations. Lots of work was spent on Conker&#x27;s tail, animating it for several instances when he rotates, stands, twitches, and moves around; in an attempt to simplify this process, the tail was thought of as a &quot;bag of air&quot;. For animating objects attached to parts of Conker&#x27;s model, Marlow coded as if the objects were constrained to joints different from the parts coming in contact with the objects; Conker&#x27;s juggling balls moved based on his right hip, the Game Boy was attached to his foot, and the frying pan was connected to his wrist.

For Conker&#x27;s peeing attack, only the back of him was animated without his front completed; this was because if the front of Conker peeing was animated and seen, it would have given &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; an AO (&quot;Adults Only&quot;) rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board. Conker&#x27;s cheeks were originally animated to puff during his whistling animation, but it broke during testing, and by the time it was fixed it was too late to program it into the final product.

=== Audio ===
The inclusion of voice acting, in addition to the adult content, was another method by Seavor of differentiating &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; in the Nintendo 64 marketplace; the idea initially garnered skepticism from a few staff members who argued it was &quot;too much work&quot;, but Seavor explained that for Beanland, it &quot;was like laying down a challenge, one we both accepted and relished&quot;. For making each mission scenario, voice recording came first; Beanland recalled one session lasting an hour. Seavor described the voice recording process and him and Beanland &quot;having some fun with stupid voices&quot;. The vocal track meant &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; required a 64 MB cartridge, one of the few Nintendo 64 games that size. Audio made up around 40–48 MB of all cartridge space.

Except for The Great Mighty Poo, all of the male characters, including Conker, and two female characters were voiced by Seavor, with all other female characters voiced by the animator Louise Ridgeway. Routines of The Jerky Boys influence the voice direction, such as the New York accent on the Nasty Wasps. For Berri, Ridgeway was directed to use an American accent. She recalled in 2015 that she&#x27;d &quot;never been anywhere in my life; I&#x27;d just flown over from Dublin&quot;, so &quot;all I could think was to add &#x27;like&#x27; so often&quot;. Seavor and Beanland had difficulty coming up with voices for the Ugas; they initially tried to make them sound like the cavemen in &quot;At the Earth&#x27;s Core&quot; (1976), but were unsuccessful and ultimately decided to do random grunts and fast word sayings.

For music tracks where the instruments playing change depending on location, volumes of different MIDI channels were programmed to go up or down; one MIDI file was limited to 16 channels, so in order to have 32 MIDI channels for as much variation as possible, audio software engineer Mike Currington conceived having two MIDI files sync up with each other. With the intro to It&#x27;s War replicating the chaotic audio of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, its bullet hit sounds were programmed as MIDI notes with much panning, taking advantage of the game&#x27;s Surround Sound.

The Great Mighty Poo was performed by Marlow, who had experience in opera; recorded in a single afternoon, &quot;Sloprano&quot;, the song the character sings, was written by Seavor and composer Robin Beanland specifically to incorporate Marlow&#x27;s operatic talents. &quot;Sloprano&quot; was also originally going to have the sweetcorn be backing singers, with Ridgeway and another animator Aisling Duddy voicing them; this was rejected. The only &quot;Twelve Tales&quot; piece included in &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; was the one where Conker is peeing on his enemies.

=== Rejected material ===
Although Seavor remarked that &quot;pretty much 99.9% of the game content remained&quot; writing-wise, &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; was around 20% longer than the final product when it came to planned gameplay designs and concepts, with material cut due to a lack of time to incorporate it. A few areas that made it into the game were initially modeled differently, such as the water tube in the shark-bulldog area Conker swims in chasing a wad of money. Some offensive content was cut by Nintendo, including cutscenes with &quot;Pokémon&quot; and a joke at the expense of the Ku Klux Klan. The introduction of Conker slashing the N64 logo in half was also initially disapproved by Nintendo; the developers in 2013 recalled that Rare founder Tim Stamper may have met with Nintendo to resolve the conflict. Scrapped characters included four in the cheese field of the barn (Camembert, Ninja Cheese, Cheese Crate, and King Dick Cheesy III) and six &quot;Drugrats&quot; (Roach, Cornsacks, Floury, Doughy, Pooey, and Mrs. Roach).

In the final game, a climbing area in the Poo Cabin includes a hole containing a piece of chocolate that&#x27;s unattainable due to being protected by bars; this was meant to be the entrance of a section that was never finished, and Seavor deliberately left the hole to annoy players. The &quot;Yeehaa!&quot; section, which involve three cows and a bull Conker rides named Bugger Lugs, was going to be a bigger level; Conker would have flown in the sky by blowing up a female cow into fetish outfits and turning her into a balloon, dropping bricks on other cows that exploded into fecal matter. Another scrapped mission was a return to the shark-bulldog area with the re-appearance of Brute and Marvin the farting mouse, who exploded in a previous section; Conker would have killed the dogfish by feeding the mouse to Brute, then going to a context-sensitive area to shoot the fish as Marvin was about to explode, in reference to the shark&#x27;s demise in &quot;Jaws&quot;.

A scrapped conclusion, named the &quot;Lock-Up Ending&quot;, would have occurred when Conker beat the final boss and died at the same time. Everything would become static except for Conker, who would fall to the ground after briefly being frozen during a dive, and the programmers would be heard arguing about the bug; Conker would then make a deal with the programmers to remove the boss in exchange for not telling &quot;Tony&quot; about it. Animation for a set of outtakes in the closing credits a la the end credits of &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999) was started, but could not be completed in time. One of the bloopers was the &quot;Mad Pitchfork&quot; scene where Conker became annoyed and had his voice turn &quot;primadonna&quot;. Another was for a scene not in the actual game, where the teddy bears had to play dead but were not in character when the sequence started, which, according to a developer, was to make fun of a tester. A rejected post-credits finale would have had Berri still alive, but as a slave to king Conker.

== Release ==
=== Target demographic ===
&quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; received an M (Mature) rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board for reasons of &quot;animated violence&quot;, &quot;mature sexual themes&quot;, and &quot;strong language&quot;, becoming the second Nintendo-distributed M-rated title after another Rare-developed game, &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; (2000). Nintendo&#x27;s move into adult titles was to keep the interest of consumers who played the company&#x27;s titles when they were younger; Nintendo of America spokeswoman Perrin Kaplan explained that the &quot;kids who were 6 when they played the first Mario game are now 26&quot;. Less than a year before &quot;Conker&quot;″s release, 18-year-olds and over made up 58% of console players, those in the 35+ age group 21%. This demographic change was due to the success of adult-oriented PlayStation franchises like &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, and it meant it would not be enough for Nintendo to compete with Sony entirely on children&#x27;s properties.

Because Nintendo was known for its family-friendly games (in 2000, around three quarters of revenue were from sales of child-friendly video games), &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; was the subject of controversy. According to Rare, &quot;Nintendo initially had concerns regarding this issue, because kids might confuse the product as being aimed at them&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; claimed &quot;some parents used to Nintendo&#x27;s family-friendly games are horrified&quot;, reporting a mother in Schererville, Indiana who bought the game for her 15-year-old son: &quot;This is disgusting, sophomoric humor, and I&#x27;m disappointed in Nintendo. It&#x27;s like Disney releasing pornography&quot;. Nintendo of America declined to acknowledge the game in its &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; magazine (although other official Nintendo publications outside the USA did cover the game), and copies of the magazine&#x27;s strategy guides were packaged in black polybags with warnings similar to the one on the cover art imposed onto them. KB Toys, which specialised in toys and video games for children, also refused to sell the game.

=== Marketing campaign ===

Starcom&#x27;s promotional campaign for &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; targeted college males and fratboys, advertising located in bars, colleges, late-night television, and adult magazines. For the &quot;Conker&quot; campaign, Starcom won two International Advertising Festival awards in the categories of use of mixed media and best campaign directed towards adult males; according to judges, it was also one of the top three contenders for Grand Prix, although Crispin Porter + Bogusky&#x27;s Florida Anti-Tobacco Pilot Programme won it. The game&#x27;s marketing budget was $5 million.

The campaign included a video ad named &quot;Girl Talk&quot; (on the website dubbed &quot;69 Uncensored Seconds&quot;) that depicts a half-naked girl and a squirrel in bed with each other after a night of partying. For several months, urinal mats were placed in bathrooms of places in major cities, which included the URL for the game&#x27;s website; Starcom associate media director Gina Broderick said: &quot;Like Conker, our target&#x27;s focus in on his social life. Being in bars is absolutely being in their element, and because urinating is part of game play, it made total sense&quot;.

From March to 5 April 2001, &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine ran its first ever video-game-related tour, a set of &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; &quot;Beach&quot;-mode multiplayer competition parties at 20 colleges across the United States, hosted by Miss March 2001 Miriam Gonzalez. Winners of the contests were rewarded with green Nintendo 64 consoles, copies of &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot;, and Nintendo and &quot;Playboy&quot; merchandise, while the player with the highest score of all competitions won trips to two &quot;Playmate of the Year&quot; parties at Playboy Mansion. Spring break parties were also held at Club La Vela and South Padre Island&#x27;s Louie&#x27;s Backyard, the main events being &quot;King of Tail&quot; tattoo contests with free giveaways of various products on the side, such as Conker condoms, copies of &quot;Conker&#x27;s Little Black Book&quot; (a collection of &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; print ads), and t-shirts with &quot;Got Tail?&quot; on the front and the game&#x27;s logo on the back.

Three &quot;colouring book&quot; advertisements were printed in magazines like &quot;Maxim&quot;. One consists of Conker and a woman next to a tree and around acorns on the ground, with the squirrel&#x27;s head into her breasts; the tagline is, &quot;Conker is a squirrel. Squirrels hunt for acorns. Can you help Conker find some acorns?&quot; One depicted Conker peeing on flames with the tagline &quot;Help Conker stop the bullies. Use your Yellow crayon&quot; and another depicted him laying his head in a toilet with the text &quot;Shhh! Conker is taking a nap&quot;.

=== Sales ===
&quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; was first released on 5 March 2001 in North America. It was the highest-selling mature-rated video game in its first month of release, and its website garnered 300,000 unique visitors in the first two weeks on the market. However, &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; was not a commercial success, selling only about 55,000 copies within its first month of release. Potential reasons included its prohibitively high cost, advertisements exclusive to the older audience, and release near the end of the Nintendo 64&#x27;s commercial life.

In Europe, Nintendo of Europe declined to publish or distribute the title following a full commercial appraisal, deeming &quot;Conker&quot; to not be &quot;commercially viable&quot; to localize due to its text-heavy nature. On 3 March 2001, Nintendo and Rare announced that THQ would publish and distribute the game in Europe, and the company released it on 6 April 2001.

As of February 2020, &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; is the fourth rarest Nintendo 64 title, with copies selling on bidding sites for around $500 to $700 for a new copy; its value was affected by its unusual genre, poor initial sales, costly 64MB cartridges, being released near the end of the Nintendo 64&#x27;s lifespan, and several leftover copies purchased upon &quot;Live &amp; Reloaded&quot;″s release.

== Reception ==
&quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; received critical acclaim, with an aggregate review score of 92 out of 100 at Metacritic based on reviews from 19 critics. Claimed &quot;IGN&quot; editor Matt Casamassina in his 9.9/10 review, &quot;not only is it quite possibly the most hilarious title ever created, but the selection of crude jokes, over-the-top violence and sexual content featured is only one-upped by the game&#x27;s remarkably deep, well-paced level design, tightly knitted control mechanics, beautiful graphics and amazing sound quality.&quot;

Many publications and websites declared the graphics were the best on the Nintendo 64. Chris Slate of &quot;Next Generation&quot; wrote the title has the usual Rare qualities of &quot;top-notch graphics&quot; and &quot;incredible worlds&quot;. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; described even the gross-out levels as &quot;drop dead gorgeous&quot;, and exclaimed the &quot;amazing detail on the brilliant film spoof stages take our beloved N64 to new heights of visual pleasure&quot;. Critics noted that the game featured a number of technical effects that were uncommon at the time, especially for a Nintendo 64 game, such as &quot;varied and crisp&quot; textures, dynamic shadowing, coloured lighting, large areas with a long draw distance, no distance fog, detailed facial animations, lip syncing, and individually rendered fingers on some characters. &quot;GameSpot&quot; went so far as to say that the game &quot;makes other Nintendo 64 games look like 16-bit software&quot;. Casamassina praised the detailed 3D worlds, &quot;fantastic&quot; texture work, and cute character designs. He remarked that &quot;Conker himself is equipped with an in-game facial animation system that realistically portrays his different moods as he travels the lands. When he&#x27;s scared, he looks it, and when he&#x27;s pissed off players will actually be able to see his teeth showing in a frown&quot;. Reviewers noted occasional frame rate drops, but most agreed they did not interfere with the gameplay.

The game&#x27;s audio and diverse vocal track were widely praised. Critics credited the voice acting for its different accents and styles, with &quot;cleverly lewd&quot; scripts and &quot;dead-on&quot; movie spoofs; &quot;Nintendojo&quot; noted certain voices sounding identical to film characters being spoofed. The soundtrack was praised for sounding clear for a cartridge title, its use of arrangement variation based on player location, and rich and creative instrumentation. Reviewers also highlighted the high number of sound effects, such as Conker&#x27;s footsteps changing sound effects step-by-step, and how they benefitted the settings.

Most reviewers agreed the jokes were clever, funny, and well-delivered, and &quot;GamePro&quot; felt the &quot;wildly diverse&quot; weird missions were &quot;sublime satirical genius&quot; making up for the linear gameplay. However, some criticised the humor for being juvenile, misogynistic, and over-filled with profanity and bodily humor, and Slate felt the shock effect would go away within an hour. Seth Stevenson of &quot;Slate&quot; magazine called it an example of the lack of actual &quot;mature&quot; console games for &quot;socially adjusted, non-outcasted adults who enjoy videogames&quot;. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; described &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; as &quot;a monster sized game. Either you&#x27;ll die laughing well before the end or it will take you months of dedicated gameplay to reach it&quot;. 

The gameplay was highlighted for its unconventional context-sensitive pads. Casamassina noted that they &quot;help keep the action shifting, refreshing, and always exciting&quot;, and credited Rare for reducing the number of items to collect. &quot;GameRevolution&quot;″s Johnny Liu positively described the gameplay as &quot;a staccato flow between gameplay and cutscenes&quot;; while there&#x27;s only one path to traverse the game&#x27;s big world, the enjoyment came in thinking what to do next. Slate wrote its diverse set of &quot;bizarrely creative scenarios&quot; motivated gamers; he was, however, bothered by the game&#x27;s lack of clear direction on where to go, which resulted in long-length wonders that only ended in stumbling upon the next required area, and felt that many puzzles lack logical coherence and depended too much on trial and error. &quot;Edge&quot; remarked that the pads make &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; &quot;little more than a procession of barely connected and puerile minigames&quot;.

Criticism was also targeted at the game&#x27;s erratic camera system, simplistic action, short length and linear nature. &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; felt that camera system does not allow players to properly judge their position within their surroundings and &quot;GameSpot&quot; remarked that it can get caught on objects or refuse to obey commands. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported the camera being occasionally immovable and getting into frame objects that block the player&#x27;s view, making worse an experience where the character is &quot;difficult to control, especially when required to jump onto small areas&quot;.

The multiplayer modes garnered mixed responses. Casamassina and &quot;Gameplanet&quot; considered them inventive and praised the numerous options, adding longevity to the product. On the other hand, &quot;GameSpot&quot; stated that most modes &quot;fail to stand the test of time&quot;, and Liu, although stating they were &quot;a welcome bonus&quot;, considered them to be &quot;filler&quot;, also criticizing that the responsiveness and control setup of the single-player mode were not suitable for the fast pace of the multi-player battles.

== Accolades ==
&quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; was awarded Nintendo 64 Game of the Month by &quot;IGN&quot;. It won best sound at the 2001 BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards, Best Platform Game at the &quot;GameSpot&quot; Best and Worst of 2001 awards (where it was also nominated in the Best Story and Best Nintendo 64 Game categories, losing to &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;Paper Mario&quot; respectively) and Best Anthropomorphic Game at the furry media award ceremony Ursa Major Awards. During the 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; for the &quot;Console Action/Adventure&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Character or Story Development&quot; awards, ultimately losing to &quot;&quot; and &quot;Ico&quot; respectively.

In later years, &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; has been called by professional gaming critics one of the best video games of all time, one of the greatest Nintendo games, and one of the best Nintendo 64 titles. In &quot;Uproxx&quot;″s 2021 list of top 100 Nintendo 64 games based on 250,849 user ratings from various websites, &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; came in at number 12. It ranked number six both on a list of Rare games by &quot;Shacknews&quot; (2018) and a ranking of best games featured on &quot;Rare Replay&quot; by &quot;Ginx&quot;. It was also called the first and seventh funniest game by &quot;GameTrailers&quot; (2009) and &quot;God is a Geek&quot; (2011) respectively. &quot;UGO&quot; included the game at #3 on their 2010 list of The 11 Weirdest Game Endings, and in 2013 &quot;Gaming Bolt&quot; named the water tube the 64th most challenging level of all video games. Despite its poor sales initially, the game has since enjoyed a cult following due to its unique styling.

== Legacy ==
After the release of &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot;, Rare began development of a direct sequel referred to as &quot;Conker&#x27;s Other Bad Day&quot;. Seavor revealed that the game would deal with &quot;Conker&#x27;s somewhat unsuccessful tenure as King. He spends all the treasured money on beer, parties and hookers. Thrown into prison, Conker is faced with the prospect of execution and the game starts with his escape, ball and chain attached, from the Castle&#x27;s highest tower&quot;. In 2002, however, Rare was purchased by Microsoft, who told them they were not interested in such a project.

A remake of &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot;, titled &quot;&quot;, was ultimately released for the Xbox in 2005 to generally favourable critical reception. Developers noted that it was difficult to port the game to the Xbox system because &quot;Bad Fur Day&quot;″s microcoded performance optimisations had been deeply customised for the Nintendo 64 hardware. &quot;Conker: Live &amp; Reloaded&quot; features updated graphics and a multiplayer mode that supports the Xbox Live service. Additionally, some aspects in the single-player mode were adjusted: several minor obscenities within the voice dialogue that are present in the Nintendo 64 game were censored at Microsoft&#x27;s request, the camera control was refined and improved with a zoom function, and an auto-targeting system was added to the game.

After the release of &quot;Live &amp; Reloaded&quot;, Rare began work on another game in the &quot;Conker&quot; universe titled &quot;Conker: Gettin&#x27; Medieval&quot;. The game was to be multiplayer-focused and did not feature Conker as a main character, with Rare instead hoping to focus on other characters in the series, but the game was ultimately cancelled. Conker returned in a new episodic campaign for the sandbox game &quot;Project Spark&quot;. The campaign, titled &quot;Conker&#x27;s Big Reunion&quot;, is set ten years after the events of &quot;Bad Fur Day&quot; and Seavor reprised his voice roles. The first episode of the campaign was released in April 2015, but the remaining ones were cancelled the following September. &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; is also included as part of the &quot;Rare Replay&quot; compilation for Xbox One, marking the original game&#x27;s first official re-release. The compilation was released on 4 August 2015.

<doc id="501568" wikidata="Q584105" url="?curid=501568" title="Music video game">
<text>A music video game, also commonly known as a music game, is a video game where the gameplay is meaningfully and often almost entirely oriented around the player&#x27;s interactions with a musical score or individual songs. Music video games may take a variety of forms and are often grouped with puzzle games due to their common use of &quot;rhythmically generated puzzles&quot;.

Music video games are distinct from purely audio games (e.g. the 1997 Sega Saturn release &quot;Real Sound: Kaze no Regret&quot;) in that they feature a visual feedback, to lead the player through the game&#x27;s soundtrack, although eidetic music games can fall under both categories.

==Overview==
Music video games are games where there is typically some type of interactivity of the gameplay with the game&#x27;s music. This may be where the music is generated in response to the player&#x27;s actions, or where the player reacts to the beats and notes of the music. As the genre has gained popularity and expanded, music video games have demonstrated the ability to support a range of different styles of gameplay, making the genre itself rather diffuse. A game such as &quot;Rayman Legends&quot; features levels that are based on endless runners but where the player scores better by matching their actions to the musical cues, which could make this a music video game.

Instead, it is easier to consider the sub-genres of music video games based on how the player interacts with the music in the game, of which there are four main types as described by the concepts of &quot;matching, making, mixing, and metonymy&quot; as described by Michael Austin, the director of the School of Music at Louisiana Tech University. These ideas correlate to the subgenres as described below. Music games may feature multiple modes; for example, &quot;Frequency&quot; is primarily a scored rhythm matching game but also includes a music mixing gameplay feature for players to make their own mixes of the available songs.

===Rhythm-matching games===
Rhythm-matching games or simply rhythm games require the player to respond in some fashion in time to music as it is played and shown via the game, all generally to emphasize the rhythm of the song being played. This may be by performing specific actions on a controller with precision timing as the note is played. Players are generally scored by not only hitting the right control but how precisely they hit it in time with the music. To improve in such games, players often begin to learn the required actions to memory as to be able to anticipate difficult sections or areas where high scoring is possible.

The wide variety of possible player input has created a range of rhythm games, from &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; where players input moves on a dance mat, &quot;Donkey Konga&quot; in which players beat on a conga drum-like controller, and the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; series where players simulate the fingering and strumming on a guitar-shaped controller. This concept also extends to singing games like &quot;Karaoke Revolution&quot;, with players scored for how well they match the pitch of the vocal track.

Rhythm games are the most dominant form of the music game genre. The electronic game &quot;Simon&quot; is considered the earliest example of a rhythm game, while early games that defined the rhythm-matching aspects include &quot;Dance Aerobics&quot; (1987) and &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot; (1996). More recent titles include the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; (2005) and &quot;Rock Band&quot; (2007) series, &quot;Beat Saber&quot; (2019), and &quot;Friday Night Funkin’&quot;.

====Hybrid rhythm games====
A further class of rhythm games is hybrid rhythm games or music reactive games. In comparison to the forementioned rhythm games where the rhythm matching is the primary focus and the player&#x27;s action helps to generate the music that they hear, reactive games let the background music guide the player action, leaving the rhythm gameplay elements secondary to the main gameplay form. Often in these hybrid rhythm games, the player plays the game as they normally would but can use the in-game music to time actions often to better their score, thus affecting the interaction between the player and the in-game dynamics as goal of the game. In &quot;Rez&quot;, for example, the game takes the form of a simple rail shooter; however, by integrating sound effects created by the actions of the player (as he completes the normal tasks of rail-shooting) with the soundtrack as a whole, the game is intended to permit the player&#x27;s direct interaction with the soundtrack and to encourage the creation of a synaesthetic experience. Other similar games include &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, &quot;Rhyme Rider Kerorican&quot;, or &quot;iS – internal section&quot;. A further class of these games allow for users to provide music that is then processed dynamically by the game to create challenges for that song, so that players are not dependent on the game&#x27;s developer to extend the game&#x27;s library of songs. Such games include &quot;Vib-Ribbon&quot;, &quot;Audiosurf&quot;, or &quot;Dance Factory&quot;.

===Music-making games===
Music-making freeform music games are those in which the creation of music takes predominance over gameplay and as such these games are often more similar to non-game music synthesizers such as the Tenori-on. Players are given the ability to create their own music from a variety of sounds, instruments or voices, typically with no goal or objective. Free form music games occupy a position somewhere between generative hybrid music games and non-game utilities dependent upon the degree to which their gameplay relies upon a driving underlying plotline. This form of music game is closely analogous to sandbox games in the realm of non-musical games and the term &quot;sandbox&quot; has been used to describe this form of gameplay. Examples of such games include &quot;SimTunes&quot; or the music composition tool in &quot;Mario Paint&quot;.

===Music-mixing games===
Music-mixing games are those in which players take premade sounds, music, or other audio tracks and interact with them in the game to create new works. These games are similarly sandbox in nature a music-making games, though by creation of certain combination of sounds, the player may be awarded points or unlock additional features. Such games include &quot;Incredibox&quot; and &quot;Fuser&quot;.

===Music-themed games===
The fourth subgenre of music games are those that are related to the metonymy of music, where the game may feature narration about the creation of music but not feature gameplay related to music. For example, &quot;Michael Jackson&#x27;s Moonwalker&quot; would be a considered a music-themed game as it is based on the musical works of Michael Jackson, but as a beat&#x27;em up, has none of the typical mechanics associated with the other subgenres of music games. One of the first examples of this type of subgenre, and of music games in general, is the 1983 arcade game &quot;Journey&quot;, named after band of the same name, which featured some of the group&#x27;s music and digitized versions of the band members.

== Music games for live performance ==

Some music video games, regardless of their fundamental gameplay, may offer modes to allow players to use the game for creating live performances, typically using freeform or non-scoring modes with multiple local players. Games like &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; and &quot;Singstar&quot; offer such modes that also give the player the opportunity for physical presence as part of their performance for others.

<text>Japonic or Japanese–Ryukyuan (), sometimes also Japanic, is a language family comprising Japanese, spoken in the main islands of Japan, and the Ryukyuan languages, spoken in the Ryukyu Islands. The family is universally accepted by linguists, and significant progress has been made in reconstructing the proto-language, Proto-Japonic. The reconstruction implies a split between all dialects of Japanese and all Ryukyuan varieties, probably before the 7th century. The Hachijō language, spoken on the Izu Islands, is also included, but its position within the family is unclear.

Most scholars believe that Japonic was brought to the Japanese archipelago from the Korean peninsula with the Yayoi culture during the 1st millennium BC. There is some fragmentary evidence suggesting that Japonic languages may still have been spoken in central and southern parts of the Korean peninsula (see Peninsular Japonic) in the early centuries AD.

Possible genetic relationships with many other language families have been proposed, most systematically with Koreanic, but no genetic relationship has been conclusively demonstrated.

== Classification ==
The extant Japonic languages belong to two well-defined branches: Japanese and Ryukyuan.
Most scholars believe that Japonic was brought to northern Kyushu from the Korean peninsula around 700 to 300 BC by wet-rice farmers of the Yayoi culture and spread throughout the Japanese archipelago, replacing indigenous languages.
The former wider distribution of Ainu languages is confirmed by placenames in northern Honshu ending in (from Ainu &#x27;river&#x27;) and (from Ainu &#x27;stream&#x27;).
Somewhat later, Japonic languages also spread southward to the Ryukyu Islands. There is fragmentary placename evidence that now-extinct Japonic languages were still spoken in central and southern parts of the Korean peninsula several centuries later.

=== Japanese ===

Japanese is the de facto national language of Japan, where it is spoken by about 126 million people. The oldest attestation is Old Japanese, which was recorded using Chinese characters in the 7th and 8th centuries.
It differed from Modern Japanese in having a simple (C)V syllable structure and avoiding vowel sequences. The script also distinguished eight vowels (or diphthongs), with two each corresponding to modern &quot;i&quot;, &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot;. Most of the texts reflect the speech of the area around Nara, the eighth-century Japanese capital, but over 300 poems were written in eastern dialects of Old Japanese.

The language experienced a massive influx of Sino-Japanese vocabulary after the introduction of Buddhism in the 6th century and peaking with the wholesale importation of Chinese culture in the 8th and the 9th centuries. The loanwords now account for about half the lexicon. They also affected the sound system of the language by adding compound vowels, syllable-final nasals, and geminate consonants, which became separate morae.
Most of the changes in morphology and syntax reflected in the modern language took place during the Late Middle Japanese period (13th to 16th centuries).

Modern mainland Japanese dialects, spoken on Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku, and Hokkaido, are generally grouped as follows:
* Eastern Japanese, including most dialects from Nagoya east, including the modern standard Tokyo dialect. 
* Western Japanese, including most dialects west of Nagoya, including the Kyoto dialect.
* Kyushu dialects, spoken on the island of Kyushu, including the Kagoshima dialect/Satsugū dialect, spoken in Kagoshima Prefecture in southern Kyushu.

The early capitals of Nara and Kyoto lay within the western area, and their Kansai dialect retained its prestige and influence long after the capital was moved to Edo (modern Tokyo) in 1603. Indeed, the Tokyo dialect has several western features not found in other eastern dialects.

The Hachijō language, spoken on Hachijō-jima and the Daitō Islands, including Aogashima, is highly divergent and varied. It has a mix of conservative features inherited from Eastern Old Japanese and influences from modern Japanese, making it difficult to classify. Hachijō is an endangered language, with a small population of elderly speakers.

=== Ryukyuan ===
The Ryukyuan languages were originally and traditionally spoken throughout the Ryukyu Islands, an island arc stretching between the southern Japanese island of Kyushu and the island of Taiwan. Most of them are considered &quot;definitely&quot; or &quot;critically endangered&quot; because of the spread of mainland Japanese.

Since Old Japanese displayed several innovations that are not shared with Ryukyuan, the two branches must have separated before the 7th century. The move from Kyushu to the Ryukyus may have occurred later and possibly coincided with the rapid expansion of the agricultural Gusuku culture in the 10th and 11th centuries. Such a date would explain the presence in Proto-Ryukyuan of Sino-Japanese vocabulary borrowed from Early Middle Japanese. After the migration to the Ryukyus, there was limited influence from mainland Japan until the conquest of the Ryukyu Kingdom by the Satsuma Domain in 1609.

Ryukyuan varieties are considered dialects of Japanese in Japan but have little intelligibility with Japanese or even among one another. They are divided into northern and southern groups, corresponding to the physical division of the chain by the 250 km-wide Miyako Strait.

Northern Ryukyuan languages are spoken in the northern part of the chain, including the major Amami and Okinawa Islands. They form a single dialect continuum, with mutual unintelligibility between widely separated varieties. The major varieties are, from northeast to southwest:
* Kikai, on the island of Kikaijima.
* Northern Amami Ōshima, spoken in most of Amami Ōshima
* Southern Amami Ōshima, spoken in Setouchi on the southern end of Amami Ōshima.
* Tokunoshima, on the island of Tokunoshima.
*Okinoerabu, on the island of Okinoerabujima
*Yoron, on the island of Yoronjima.
*Kunigami or Northern Okinawan, spoken in the northern part of Okinawa Island, including the cities of Nakijin and Nago.
* (Central) Okinawan, spoken in the central and southern parts of Okinawa Island, and neighboring islands. The prestige dialect is spoken in Naha, and the former city of Shuri. The Shuri dialect was the lingua franca of the Ryukyuan Kingdom, and was first recorded in the 16th century, particularly in the &quot;Omoro Sōshi&quot; anthology.

There is no agreement on the subgrouping of the varieties. One proposal, adopted by the UNESCO &quot;Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger&quot;, has three subgroups, with the central &quot;Kunigami&quot; branch comprising varieties from Southern Amami to Northern Okinawan, based on similar vowel systems and patterns of lenition of stops. Pellard suggests a binary division based on shared innovations, with an Amami group including the varieties from Kikai to Yoron, and an Okinawa group comprising the varieties of Okinawa and smaller islands to its west.

Southern Ryukyuan languages are spoken in the southern part of the chain, the Sakishima Islands. They comprise three distinct dialect continua:
* Miyako is spoken in the Miyako Islands, with dialects on Irabu and Tarama.
* Yaeyama is spoken in the Yaeyama Islands (except Yonaguni), with dialects on each island, but primarily Ishigaki Island, Iriomote Island, and Taketomi Island.
* Yonaguni, spoken on Yonaguni Island, is phonologically distinct but lexically closer to other Yaeyama varieties.
The southern Ryukyus were settled by Japonic-speakers from the northern Ryukyus in the 13th century, leaving no linguistic trace of the indigenous inhabitants of the islands.

=== Alternative classifications ===
An alternative classification, based mainly on the development of the pitch accent, groups the highly divergent Kagoshima dialects of southwestern Kyushu with Ryukyuan in a Southwestern branch.
Kyushu and Ryukyuan varieties also share some lexical items, some of which appear to be innovations.
The internal classification by Elisabeth de Boer includes Ryukyuan as a deep subbranch of a Kyūshū–Ryūkyū branch:

*Japonic
**Eastern
**Central
**Izumo–Tōhoku
**Kyūshū–Ryūkyū

She also proposes a branch consisting of the Izumo dialect (spoken on the northern coast of western Honshu) and the Tōhoku dialects (northern Honshu), which show similar developments in the pitch accent that she attributes to sea-borne contacts.

=== Peninsular Japonic ===

There is fragmentary evidence suggesting that now-extinct Japonic languages were spoken in the central and southern parts of the Korean peninsula. Vovin calls these languages Peninsular Japonic and groups Japanese and Ryukyuan as Insular Japonic.

The most-cited evidence comes from chapter 37 of the (compiled in 1145), which contains a list of pronunciations and meanings of placenames in the former kingdom of Goguryeo. As the pronunciations are given using Chinese characters, they are difficult to interpret, but several of those from central Korea, in the area south of the Han River captured from Baekje in the 5th century, seem to correspond to Japonic words. Scholars differ on whether they represent the language of Goguryeo or the people that it conquered.

Traces from the south of the peninsula are very sparse:
* The Silla placenames listed in Chapter 34 of the are not glossed, but many of them can be explained as Japonic words.
* Alexander Vovin proposes Japonic etymologies for two of four Baekje words given in the &quot;Book of Liang&quot; (635).
* A single word is explicitly attributed to the language of the southern Gaya confederacy, in Chapter 44 of the . It is a word for &#x27;gate&#x27; and appears in a similar form to the Old Japanese word , with the same meaning.
* Vovin suggests that the ancient name for the kingdom of Tamna on Jeju Island, , may have a Japonic etymology &#x27;valley settlement&#x27; or &#x27;people&#x27;s settlement&#x27;.

=== Proposed external relationships ===
According to Shirō Hattori, more attempts have been made to link Japanese with other language families than for any other language. None of the attempts has succeeded in demonstrating a common descent for Japonic and any other language family.

The most systematic comparisons have involved Korean, which has a very similar grammatical structure to Japonic languages. Samuel Elmo Martin, John Whitman, and others have proposed hundreds of possible cognates, with sound correspondences. However, Alexander Vovin points out that Old Japanese contains several pairs of words of similar meaning in which one word matches a Korean form, and the other is also found in Ryukyuan and Eastern Old Japanese, suggesting that the former is an early loan from Korean. He suggests that to eliminate such early loans, Old Japanese morphemes should not be assigned a Japonic origin unless they are also attested in Southern Ryukyuan or Eastern Old Japanese. That procedure leaves fewer than a dozen possible cognates, which may have been borrowed by Korean from Peninsular Japonic.

== Typology ==
Most Japonic languages have voicing opposition for obstruents, with exceptions such as the Miyako dialect of Ōgami. Glottalized consonants are common in North Ryukyuan languages but are rarer in South Ryukyuan.
Proto-Japonic had only voiceless obstruents, like Ainu and proto-Korean.
Japonic languages also resemble Ainu and modern Korean in having a single liquid consonant phoneme.
A five-vowel system like Standard Japanese , , , and is common, but some Ryukyuan languages also have central vowels and , and Yonaguni has only , , and .

In most Japonic languages, speech rhythm is based on a subsyllabic unit, the mora. Each syllable has a basic mora of the form (C)V but a nasal coda, geminate consonant, or lengthened vowel counts as an additional mora. However, some dialects in northern Honshu or southern Kyushu have syllable-based rhythm.

Like Ainu, Middle Korean, and some modern Korean dialects, most Japonic varieties have a lexical pitch accent, which governs whether the moras of a word are pronounced high or low, but it follows widely-different patterns. In Tokyo-type systems, the basic pitch of a word is high, with an accent (if present) marking the position of a drop to low pitch. In Kyushu dialects, the basic pitch is low, with accented syllables given high pitch. In Kyoto-type systems, both types are used.

Japonic languages, again like Ainu and Korean, are left-branching (or head-final), with a basic subject–object–verb word order, modifiers before nouns, and postpositions. There is a clear distinction between verbs, which have extensive inflectional morphology, and nominals, with agglutinative suffixing morphology.
Ryukyuan languages inflect all adjectives in the same way as verbs, while mainland varieties have classes of adjectives that inflect as nouns and verbs respectively.

Most Japonic languages mark singular and plural number, but some Northern Ryukyuan languages also have the dual.
Most Ryukyuan languages mark a clusivity distinction in plural (or dual) first-person pronouns, but no Mainland varieties do so.
The most common type of morphosyntactic alignment is nominative–accusative, but neutral (or direct), active–stative and (very rarely) tripartite alignment are found in some Japonic languages.

== Proto-Japonic ==

The proto-language of the family has been reconstructed by using a combination of internal reconstruction from Old Japanese and by applying the comparative method to Old Japanese (including eastern dialects) and Ryukyuan. The major reconstructions of the 20th century were produced by Samuel Elmo Martin and Shirō Hattori.

Proto-Japonic words are generally polysyllabic, with syllables having the form (C)V. The following proto-Japonic consonant inventory is generally agreed upon, except that some scholars argue for voiced stops and instead of glides and :

The Old Japanese voiced consonants &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;z&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, which never occurred word-initially, are derived from clusters of nasals and voiceless consonants after the loss of an intervening vowel.

Most authors accept six Proto-Japonic vowels:

Some authors also propose a high central vowel .
The mid vowels and were raised to Old Japanese &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot; respectively, except word-finally.
Other Old Japanese vowels arose from sequences of Proto-Japonic vowels.

It is generally accepted that a lexical pitch accent should be reconstructed for Proto-Japonic, but its precise form is controversial.

<doc id="501577" wikidata="Q557775" url="?curid=501577" title="Linton Kwesi Johnson">
<text>Linton Kwesi Johnson OD (born 24 August 1952), also known as LKJ, is a Jamaica-born, British-based dub poet and activist. In 2002, he became the second living poet, and the only black one, to be published in the Penguin Modern Classics series. His performance poetry involves the recitation of his own verse in Jamaican patois over dub-reggae, usually written in collaboration with reggae producer/artist Dennis Bovell.

==Early life==
Johnson was born in Chapelton, a small town in the rural parish of Clarendon, Jamaica. His middle name, &quot;Kwesi&quot;, is a Ghanaian name that is given to boys who, like Johnson, are born on a Sunday. In 1963 he and his father came to live in Brixton, London, joining his mother, who had immigrated to Britain as part of the Windrush generation shortly before Jamaican independence in 1962. Johnson attended Tulse Hill School in Lambeth. While still at school he joined the British Black Panther Movement, helped to organise a poetry workshop within the movement, and developed his work with Rasta Love, a group of poets and drummers.

Johnson studied sociology at Goldsmiths College in New Cross, London, graduating in 1973. Speaking in a 2018 interview about his start as a poet, he said: &quot;I began to write verse, not only because I liked it, but because it was a way of expressing the anger, the passion of the youth of my generation in terms of our struggle against racial oppression. Poetry was a cultural weapon in the black liberation struggle, so that&#x27;s how it began.&quot; During the early to mid-1970s he was employed as the first paid library resources and education officer at the Keskidee Centre, where his poem &quot;Voices of the living and the dead&quot; was staged, produced by Jamaican novelist Lindsay Barrett, with music by the reggae group Rasta Love. Johnson has recalled: &quot;it was fantastic, you know, having written something and having it staged with actors and musicians. That was back in 1973 before I had a poem published anywhere. That was before anyone had ever heard of Linton Kwesi Johnson.&quot;

Johnson wrote for &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, and &quot;Black Music&quot; in the 1970s. As a freelancer for Virgin Records he wrote biographies for their reggae artists, sleeve notes and copy for adverts.

==Career==
=== Poetry ===

Most of Johnson&#x27;s poetry is political, dealing mainly with the experiences of being an African-Caribbean in Britain: &quot;Writing was a political act and poetry was a cultural weapon...&quot;, he told an interviewer in 2008. However, he has also written about other issues, such as British foreign policy and the death of anti-racist marcher Blair Peach. Johnson wrote &quot;Reggae fi Dada&quot; on the death of his father in 1982, blaming social conditions. His most celebrated poems were written during the government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The poems contain graphic accounts of the racist police brutality occurring at the time (cf. &quot;Sonny&#x27;s Lettah&quot;). Johnson&#x27;s poetry makes clever use of the unstandardised transcription of Jamaican patois.

Johnson&#x27;s poems first appeared in the journal &quot;Race Today&quot;, which published his first collection of poetry, &quot;Voices of the Living and the Dead&quot;, in 1974. &quot;Dread Beat An&#x27; Blood&quot;, his second collection, was published in 1975 by Bogle-L&#x27;Ouverture.

A collection of his poems has been published as &quot;Mi Revalueshanary Fren&quot; by Penguin Modern Classics. Johnson is one of only three living poets to be published by Penguin Modern Classics.

=== Essays ===
Johnson&#x27;s essays, spanning 50 years (1976-2021), are collected in the volume &quot;Time Come&quot; (Picador, 2023). As described by Colin Grant, &quot;The writing is often flinty and flecked with passion; taut and reasoned, but on the edge of fury. ...the grace and power of LKJ&#x27;s writing are as necessary as ever.&quot; Reviewing it in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, Tomiwa Owolade concludes: &quot;this volume emphasises the fact that Johnson is a dedicated cultural critic rather than simply an activist who happens to write dub poetry.&quot;

=== Music ===

Johnson&#x27;s best-known albums include his debut &quot;Dread Beat an&#x27; Blood&quot; (1978), &quot;Forces of Victory&quot; (1979), &quot;Bass Culture&quot; (1980), &quot; LKJ in Dub&quot; (1980), and &quot;Making History&quot; (1983). Across them are spread classics of the dub poetry school of performance – and of reggae itself – such as &quot;Dread Beat An&#x27; Blood&quot;, &quot;Sonny&#x27;s Lettah&quot;, &quot;Inglan Is A Bitch&quot;, &quot;Independent Intavenshan&quot; and &quot;All Wi Doin Is Defendin&quot;. His poem &quot;Di Great Insohreckshan&quot; is his response to the 1981 Brixton riots. The work was the subject of a BBC Radio 4 programme in 2007.

Johnson&#x27;s work, allied to the Jamaican &quot;toasting&quot; tradition, is regarded as an essential precursor of rap.

Johnson&#x27;s record label LKJ Records, launched in 1981, is home to other reggae artists, some of whom made up the Dub Band, with whom Johnson mostly recorded, and other dub poets, such as Jean &quot;Binta&quot; Breeze. Past releases on the label include recordings by Mikey Smith.

==Awards and honours==

Johnson received a C. Day-Lewis Fellowship in 1977, and that year became writer-in-residence for the London Borough of Lambeth. He was made an Associate Fellow of Warwick University in 1985 and an Honorary Fellow of Wolverhampton Polytechnic in 1987, and in 1990 received an award at the XIII Premio Internazionale Ultimo Novecento from the city of Pisa for his contribution to poetry and popular music. In 1998 he was awarded the Premio Piero Ciampi Citta di Livorno Concorso Musicale Nazionale in Italy.

In 2003, Johnson was given an honorary fellowship at his alma mater, Goldsmiths College, University of London. In 2004 he became an Honorary Visiting Professor of Middlesex University in London. In 2005 he was awarded a silver Musgrave Medal from the Institute of Jamaica for distinguished eminence in the field of poetry. In 2012, he was awarded the Golden PEN Award by English PEN for &quot;a Lifetime&#x27;s Distinguished Service to Literature&quot;.

He is a Trustee of the George Padmore Institute (GPI), and is a contributor to the GPI&#x27;s collection of dialogues &quot;Changing Britannia: Life Experience With Britain&quot;, edited by Roxy Harris and Sarah White (New Beacon Books, 1999).

In August 2014, it was announced that he would receive the Jamaican national honour of the Order of Distinction in October that year.

On 20 April 2017 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Literature (D.Litt.) by Rhodes University in South Africa.

In July 2020, Johnson was awarded the PEN Pinter Prize – established in Harold Pinter&#x27;s name to defend freedom of expression and celebrate literature – for his commitment to political expression in his work. Announcing the award, the judges described Johnson as &quot;a living legend&quot;, &quot;a poet, reggae icon, academic and campaigner, whose impact on the cultural landscape over the last half century has been colossal and multi-generational... His political ferocity and his tireless scrutiny of history are truly Pinteresque, as is the humour with which he pursues them.&quot; Receiving the award at a live online event hosted by the British Library in October 2020, Johnson named Eritrean poet, poet, songwriter and journalist Amanuel Asrat as the &quot;International Writer of Courage&quot; with whom he would share the prize.

Johnson is chair of 198 Contemporary Arts and Learning, an art gallery and learning institution in Brixton.

<text>A safe house (also spelled safehouse) is a dwelling place or building whose unassuming appearance makes it an inconspicuous location where one can hide out, take shelter, or conduct clandestine activities.

==Historical usage==
It may also refer to:

* in the jargon of law enforcement and intelligence agencies, a secure location, suitable for hiding witnesses, agents or other persons perceived as being in danger
* a place where people may go to avoid prosecution of their activities by authorities. Osama bin Laden&#x27;s compound in Abbottabad has been described as a &quot;safe house&quot;.
* a location where a trusted adult, family or charity organization provides a for victims of domestic abuse (see also: men and/or women&#x27;s shelter or refuge)
* a home of a trusted person, family or organization where victims of war and/or persecution may take refuge, receive protection and/or live in secret
* a house whose sole purpose is to conduct illegal ventures. Criminals use these to conduct different aspects of their business, such as produce, sell, or store product.
* Right of asylum
* sanctuary in medieval law
* sanctuary in modern times
* Church asylum

Typically, the significance of safe houses is kept secret from all but a limited number of people, for the safety of those hidden within them.

Many religious institutions will allow one to obtain sanctuary within one&#x27;s place of worship, and some governments respect and do not violate such sanctuary.

Safe houses were an integral part of the Underground Railroad, the network of safe house locations that were used to assist slaves in escaping to the primarily northern free states in the 19th century United States. Some houses were marked with a statue of an African-American man holding a lantern, called &quot;the Lantern Holder&quot;.

Safe houses also provided a refuge for victims of Nazi persecution and for escaping prisoners of war. Victims, such as Anne Frank and her family, were harbored clandestinely for extended periods of time. Other Jewish victims that were hidden from the Germans include Philip Slier and his extended family and friends.

<doc id="501587" wikidata="Q2903135" url="?curid=501587" title="Interactive storytelling">
<text>Interactive storytelling (also known as interactive drama) is a form of digital entertainment in which the storyline is not predetermined. The author creates the setting, characters, and situation which the narrative must address, but the user (also reader or player) experiences a unique story based on their interactions with the story world. The architecture of an interactive storytelling program includes a drama manager, user model, and agent model to control, respectively, aspects of narrative production, player uniqueness, and character knowledge and behavior. Together, these systems generate characters that act &quot;human,&quot; alter the world in real-time reactions to the player, and ensure that new narrative events unfold comprehensibly.

The field of study surrounding interactive storytelling encompasses many disparate fields, including psychology, sociology, cognitive science, linguistics, natural language processing, user interface design, computer science, and emergent intelligence. They fall under the umbrella term of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), at the intersection of hard science and the humanities. The difficulty of producing an effective interactive storytelling system is attributed to the ideological division between professionals in each field: artists have trouble constraining themselves to logical and linear systems and programmers are disinclined to appreciate or incorporate the abstract and unproven concepts of the humanities.

==Definition==
What characteristics distinguish an interactive story from another form of interactive media is subject to much debate. Interactivity and storytelling are both polysemic terms, and the phrase &quot;interactive storytelling&quot; does not inherently distinguish it from other kinds of storytelling, many of which are already interactive to some extent. Some of the literature associated with the term &quot;interactive storytelling&quot; is actually about transmedia storytelling, which is not a form of entertainment, but a marketing strategy for building a compelling brand across digital platforms. Varying levels of interactivity are a function of the &quot;relatedness of transmitted messages with previous exchanges of information where sender and receiver roles become interchangeable.&quot; Storytelling, in this case, refers to the process of active creation and authoring rather than the final product and its passive reception. Interactive storytelling by this definition can entail any media that allows the user to generate several unique dramatic narratives. Though its final goal is a fully unauthored AI environment with a comprehensive human-level understanding of narrative construction (e.g., the Holodeck), projects that use branching stories and variable gates are considered experimental prototypes in the same genre.

Interactive storytelling is defined as distinct from interactive fiction (or IF), as well as video games with strong narrative focus (&quot;Mass Effect&quot;, &quot;BioShock&quot;, etc.), by user agency and open-ended narrative. David Gaider, an RPG developer at BioWare, stated that &quot;every possible branch needs to be written and fully realized, even if not every player sees it, and thus any game which allows for a lot of player choice becomes a much more expensive proposition for a developer.&quot; IF and video games, to balance user choice with authorial effort, must constrain the directions the narrative can take with puzzles, battles, or unchangeable plot points and bottlenecks, all of which detract from a sense of immersion. Only the most critical of the user&#x27;s narrative choices are used or remembered in narrative development, according to the need to fulfill specific player goals that define a &quot;gameplay&quot; experience. A true IS system would incorporate all of them, as do living human agents, simultaneously and continuously - a task only artificial intelligence can meet. Sandbox games like &quot;The Sims&quot; and &quot;Spore&quot;, which do involve extensive AI-based social interaction, do not manage dramatic tension or produce a cohesive narrative .

To Mateas and Stern, creators of &quot;Façade&quot; and &quot;The Party&quot;, interactive storytelling is best understood as interactive theater, in that its goal is dramatic meaning rather than fun. It was Chris Crawford who coined the term interactive storytelling in the 1990s, arguing that IS is not a video game with a narrative, and that a game and IS cannot be combined successfully. Because of limited technology and the amount of work required, it is still difficult to combine a robust interactive storytelling system and a game engine without detracting from the effectiveness of both.

Emerging voices in the field, however, argue for the possibilities of adding narrative complexity and realistic characters to existing video game genres. Using MADE (Massive Artificial Drama Engine), a team of AI researchers developed a genetic algorithm to guide emergent behavior for secondary non-player characters (NPCs) based on literary archetypes. In the AI engine of &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot;, this was tested to elaborate on the mechanistic behavior of townspeople:
== History ==
Early attempts to understand interactive storytelling date back to the 1970s with such efforts as Roger Schank&#x27;s research at Northwestern University and the experimental program TaleSpin. In the early 1980s Michael Liebowitz developed &quot;Universe&quot;, a conceptual system for a kind of interactive storytelling. In 1986, Brenda Laurel published her PhD dissertation, &quot;Toward the Design of a Computer-Based Interactive Fantasy System.&quot;

During the 1990s, a number of research projects began to appear, such as the Oz Project led by Dr. Joseph Bates and Carnegie Mellon University, the Software Agents group at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Improv Project led by Ken Perlin at New York University, and the Virtual Theater group at Stanford, led by Barbara Hayes-Roth.

There were also a number of conferences touching upon these subjects, such as the Workshop on Interactive Fiction &amp; Synthetic Realities in 1990; Interactive Story Systems: Plot &amp; Character at Stanford in 1995; the AAAI Workshop on AI and Entertainment, 1996; Lifelike Computer Characters, Snowbird, Utah, October 1996; the First International Conference on Autonomous Agents at Marina del Rey, CA. February 5–8, 1997.

The first conference to directly address the research area was the 1st International Conference on Technologies for Interactive Digital Storytelling and Entertainment, which took place in March 2003 and focused specifically on concepts and first prototypes for automated storytelling and autonomous characters, including modeling of emotions and the user experience. The concepts were developed by Chris Crawford, in his 2005 book.

In the 2000s, work on interactive storytelling and related topics expanded, and was presented at events including the alternating bi-yearly conferences, TIDSE (Conference on Technologies for Interactive Digital Storytelling and Entertainment) and ICVS (International Conference on Virtual Storytelling), hosted in Germany and France, respectively. TIDSE and ICVS were superseded by ICIDS (International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling), a yearly event established in 2008.

The first published interactive storytelling software that was widely recognized as the &quot;real thing&quot; was &quot;Façade&quot;, created by Michael Mateas and Andrew Stern. The system was publicly released in 2006, and was the winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 2006 Slamdance Independent Games Festival.

== Strategies ==
The architecture of an interactive storytelling system has three component parts: a drama manager, a user model, and an agent model. The drama manager is responsible for guiding the narrative by searching and executing story &quot;beats&quot; in a coherent sequence, refining story events by providing new information and reconciling contradictory plots, and collaborating with the agent model to choose the best narrative actions for the characters. It monitors a number of overview variables in the storyworld to make the best decision for the narrative, defined by the goals of the author: a measure of worldwide conflict would help to increase or decrease dramatic tension, while measures of relationships and likability could guide a story towards a romantic storyline. The agent model collects information about the story world and characters and generates possible actions in response for each non-player character in the story. Possible actions are drawn from the personality and emotional model of the character, allowing each one to exhibit autonomous behavior with intelligent dramatic goals. Finally, the user model keeps track of player choices and inputs, such that the drama manager and agent model can cooperate with the way the user attempts to play rather than challenging or misunderstanding their decisions.

Crawford discusses three potential strategies for developing interactive storytelling systems. Firstly, environmental approaches are those which take an interactive system, such as a computer game, and encourage the actions of a user in such a way as to form a coherent plot. With a sufficiently complex system, emergent behavior may form story-like behavior regardless of the user&#x27;s actions.

Secondly, data-driven strategies have a library of &quot;story components&quot; which are sufficiently general that they can be combined smoothly in response to a user&#x27;s actions (or lack thereof). This approach has the advantage of being more general that the directed environmental approach, at the cost of a much larger initial investment.

Finally, language-based approaches require that the user and system share some, very limited, domain-specific language so that they can react to each other and the system can &#x27;understand&#x27; a greater proportion of the users actions. Crawford suggests approaches that only use, for example, pictorial languages or restricted versions of English.

Planning-based systems can be integrated into any of the above approaches to ensure narrative cohesion. The system does this by anticipating potential holes in the plot and repairing them by introducing new information and events. Two such systems include Automated Story Director (ASD), which forms narrative repairs based on plot points predefined by the author, and Player-Specific Automated Storytelling (PAST), which chooses from several possible repairs according to the player&#x27;s previous behaviors. PAST characterizes a player along five vectors of style based on Robin Laws&#x27; work on player types—fighter, power gamer, storyteller, method actor, and tactician—and may choose to solve a broken plot point for a fighter by adding a battle with a new character, or for a storyteller by adding new background information that justifies the break.

== Evaluation ==
The success of an interactive storytelling experience depends on a balanced dramatic structure and user agency. A dramatically interesting narrative experience is one that moderates tension between characters and events over time, such that conflicts arise logically and are not left without resolution. It must also differ noticeably on every &quot;playthrough&quot; as a function of the user&#x27;s freedom to interact with characters and objects in the virtual world. This can be achieved to varying degrees of success by branching, emergent, character-driven, and plot-driven systems, but no existing system fully achieves a lifelike experience. AIs do not yet have a human grasp of the rules of drama and narrative, so existing interactive dramas produce a limited number of significantly different story outcomes, relative to the amount of labor required of the author.

There have been several attempts at formalizing an evaluation system for interactive dramas, despite the fact that all existing projects are still in experimental stages. Player agency and fun remain the primary concerns, though fun is often exchanged for more narrative-specific metrics, like &quot;interestingness&quot; and &quot;suspense.&quot; Likert scales filled out by players create a rough quantitative picture of user experience, but leave out much of the subjective interpretation that lies behind complex human interactions.

Mehta et al. focused on conversation-centric systems to develop qualitative metrics for the user&#x27;s successful engagements, instead of quantitative measures of &quot;inappropriate utterances&quot; (in which the AI misunderstands player input and responds nonsensically) and other technical failures. After a &quot;breakdown&quot; in conversation, how effectively the user incorporates it into the overall understanding of the characters and story depends on design features. In their study of &quot;Façade&quot;, some AI actor breakdowns include shallow semantic understanding, inverted meanings, and the timing of responses. Artificially intelligent agents have trouble translating ambiguous user input into the limited narrative meaning system, as when &quot;sad&quot; or &quot;hurt&quot; is interpreted only as a reference to clinical depression. Similarly, negative and positive user sentiments are often confused with one another, especially if a positive statement is preceded by disagreement with a negative one. This is exacerbated if a user cannot send a reply fast enough – their utterance is understood as referring to the most recent speaker, leading to unintended interactions. However, background information is referenced often enough for a player to invent narrative justifications for apparently strange behaviors, which most participants did. 

== Projects ==

=== The Oz Project ===
&quot;The Oz Project&quot; was an attempt in the early 1990s to use intelligent agent technology to attack the challenges in IS. Its architecture included a simulated physical world, several characters, an interactor, a theory of presentation, and a drama manager. Users communicated with the system using either a text based or graphical interface.

=== &quot;Façade&quot; ===

&quot;Façade&quot; is an artificial-intelligence-based approach created by Michael Mateas and Andrew Stern. It was the winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 2006 Slamdance Independent Games Festival and is recognized as the first true interactive storytelling software. It is text based and uses natural language processing and other artificial intelligence routines to direct the action.

=== HEFTI ===
The &quot;Hybrid Evolutionary-Fuzzy Time-based Interactive&quot; (HEFTI) storytelling system was produced at the University of Texas at Austin and uses genetic algorithms to recombine and evaluate story components generated from a set of story templates. Although Crawford described it as the &quot;wrong approach to development systems [...] incomprehensible to the kind of creative talent needed for storytelling,&quot; it continues to be discussed as a research and approach and genetic algorithm continue to be considered a potential tool for use in the area.

=== Library of story traces ===
Figa and Tarau have used WordNet to build technologies useful to interactive storytelling. This approach defines &#x27;story traces&#x27; as an abstract reduction (or skeleton) of a story, and &#x27;story projection&#x27; as a fragment of a story that can be treated as a single dramatic building block. This work seeks to build up large repositories of narrative forms in such a way that these forms can later be combined.

=== Interactive narrative design ===
As defined by Stephen Dinehart, Interactive narrative design combines ludology, narratology and game design to form interactive entertainment development methodologies. Interactive entertainment experiences allow the player to witness data as navigable, participatory, and dramatic in real-time: “a narratological craft which focuses on the structuralist, or literary semiotic creation of stories.&quot; Interactive Narrative design seeks to accomplish this via viewer/user/player (VUP) navigated dataspaces.

Interactive narrative design focuses on creating meaningful participatory story experiences with interactive systems. The aim is to transport the player through play into the videogame (dataspace) using their visual and auditory senses. When interactive narrative design is successful, the VUP (viewer/user/player) believes that they are experiencing a story.

=== Generative web series ===
&quot;Tour-Réservoir&quot; is the first generative web series, conceived by French artist Jean Michel Bruyère and his collective LFKs. Launched in 2016, it was developed and realised in co-operation with Le Volcan - Scène nationale du Havre, 296 inhabitants from a suburb of the city of Le Havre in France and more than 100 local music groups.

The website platform offers an active visit through five media – radio, TV, book, series, music video. The users can choose among a wide range of material which topics, actress(es) and music they want to appear/listen to and they can edit their own episodes or music videos.

It was nominated at the Côté Court short film festival in Pantin (Paris) in the New Media category in 2017.

=== Summary table ===
Story possibilities are not precisely calculable, and are represented as orders, such that O(10) would be in the order of tens of stories, and O(1) would be fewer than 10 unique story possibilities.

<doc id="501588" wikidata="Q1373320" url="?curid=501588" title="Rookie">
<text>A rookie is a person new to an occupation, profession, or hobby. In sports, a &quot;rookie&quot; is a professional athlete in their first season (or year).

In contrast with a veteran who has experience, a rookie is typically considered needing more training and learning, though they may bring a new outside expertise to a job.

== Etymology ==
The Oxford English Dictionary states that the origins are uncertain, but that perhaps it is a corruption of the word &quot;recruit&quot;. The earliest example in the OED is from Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Barrack-Room Ballads&quot; (published 1892): &quot;So &#x27;ark an&#x27; &#x27;eed, you rookies, which is always grumblin&#x27; sore&quot;, referring to rookies in the sense of raw recruits to the British Army. At least during the beginning of the 20th century, in the British Army the term &quot;rookie&quot; was typically used in place of &quot;recruit&quot; as exemplified in &quot;Trenching at Gallipoli&quot; by John Gallishaw (New York Century Co.: 1916) and in &quot;The Amateur Army&quot; by Patrick MacGill (London, Herbert Jenkins: 1915). Perhaps the expression is derived from &quot;rook&quot;, whereby a &quot;rookie&quot; would be someone who is cheated or defrauded.

== Sports culture ==
In some sports there are traditions in which rookies must do things, or tricks are played on them. Examples in baseball include players having to dress up in very strange costumes, or getting hit in the face with a cream pie; a traditional rookie&#x27;s &quot;hazing&quot; procedure in American football involves taping players to a goalpost and dousing them with ice water, Gatorade, and other substances.

* In Major League Baseball, the league has cracked down on hazing by enacting an Anti-Hazing and Anti-Bullying Policy which prohibits players from dressing up as the opposite sex, or wearing offensive costumes based on race, sex, nationality, age, sexual orientation, and gender identify.

===American football===
In the National Football League a rookie is any player who is in their first season playing professional football, having never signed a contract with a professional team before. The NFL awards the best rookie with the Associated Press NFL Rookie of the Year Award, as voted upon the Associated Press. In the NFL, rookies have special contract rules which limit how much a team can pay them as well as limiting the length of the contract, as per stipulations laid out in the NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement.

===Auto racing===

NASCAR and INDYCAR rookies (and non-rookie NASCAR drivers who are making their first start at a track that is not holding its first race) are denoted by a yellow stripe on sections of the car as prescribed in the respective rule books. In NASCAR, the rookie stripe is located on the tail panel of the race car.

====NASCAR====

The following rules are for rookie status in a national series:
* Must have run no more than five (prior to 2001 in Cup and Xfinity, and in the Truck Series for age-eligible drivers), seven (2001–10, Cup and Xfinity), and have been declared to race for driver points in that series (2011–present), races in any previous season.
**In the Camping World Truck Series, a driver that is 17 at the start of the season and does not make ten starts overall is eligible in his first full season after turning 18. Truck Series drivers who are 16 and 17 may only participate in nine races during the season based on circuits.
* Drivers who compete in more than five races in a higher NASCAR-sanctioned series are not eligible for the award in a lower series if they have not declared for the higher series.
* If a driver does not start eight races before the end of Race 20 on the schedule, they will immediately become ineligible to earn rookie points for the rest of that season and starting in 2011, remained declared for that series. Drivers may change series declaration in order to avoid this.
* A driver may not receive rookie points if they start a race for a team that they did not qualify with. However, they are still eligible for championship points in that race.

====INDYCAR====

The following rules are for rookie status in the NTT IndyCar Series:
* Must not have participated in more than three NTT IndyCar Series races in a season. 
* A veteran driver in the Indianapolis 500 may still be a Series Rookie if he has not competed in more than three series races overall.
* A driver who has never raced in the Indianapolis 500 but has made a legal season of NTT IndyCar Series races is still an Indianapolis 500 rookie in his first start.

===Baseball===
To qualify as a rookie in Major League Baseball (MLB), a player must not have exceeded 130 at bats or fifty innings pitched in the majors, and also fewer than 45 days on the active rosters of major league clubs (excluding time on the disabled list or any time after rosters are expanded on September 1) in their previous seasons. Major League Baseball awards the best rookie with the Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award, as voted upon by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America and first bestowed in 1947. Since 2001, MLB also issues the Major League Baseball Rookie of the Month Award.

===Basketball===
In the National Basketball Association, a rookie is any player who has never played a game in the NBA until that year and the past 1 years. The NBA awards the best rookie with the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, as voted upon by a selected panel of United States and Canadian sportswriters and broadcasters. In the NBA, rookies have special contract rules which limit how much a team can pay them as well as limiting the length of the contract.

===Ice hockey===
To qualify as a rookie in the National Hockey League, a player must not have played in more than 25 NHL games in any preceding seasons, nor in six or more NHL games in each of any two preceding seasons. Any player at least 26 years of age (by September 15 of that season) is not considered a rookie.

===Soccer===
In Major League Soccer, a rookie is a player who has had no prior professional experience. MLS awards the best rookie with the MLS Rookie of the Year Award.

<doc id="501589" wikidata="Q1535896" url="?curid=501589" title="The Abyssinians">
<text>The Abyssinians are a Jamaican roots reggae group, famous for their close harmonies and promotion of the Rastafari movement in their lyrics.

==History==
The vocal trio was originally formed in 1968 by Bernard Collins and Donald Manning. Their first song was &quot;Satta Massagana&quot;, which was strongly influenced by Carlton Manning&#x27;s &quot;Happy Land&quot;. &quot;Satta Massagana&quot; is a Rastafarian hymn sung partly in the Ethiopian Amharic language. They recruited a third vocalist, who was still at school and often unable to attend rehearsals; he was soon replaced by Donald&#x27;s brother Lynford Manning, who like Donald had previously been a member of their brother Carlton Manning&#x27;s group Carlton and The Shoes.

&quot;Satta Massagana&quot; was first recorded for producer Clement &quot;Coxsone&quot; Dodd in March 1969, but he decided against releasing it, seeing no commercial potential for what he saw as a song constituting cultural subversion. In 1971, the group purchased the master tapes from Dodd for £90 and released it on their own Clinch label, the single becoming a massive success, prompting Dodd to release his own instrumental and deejay versions. The group released further takes on the song on Clinch by Tommy McCook, Big Youth, and Dillinger, as well as their own &quot;Mabrak&quot;, featuring the group reciting passages from the Old Testament. It has since been recorded by dozens of artists. The group&#x27;s second release, &quot;Declaration of Rights&quot;, featured Leroy Sibbles on backing vocals, and like their first was a huge hit in Jamaica, (and subsequently in the international market) and has been covered several times since. Their 1973 single &quot;Y Mas Gan&quot; was similar to &quot;Satta&quot; in its use of Amharic.

The group continued to record throughout the 1970s for producers including Lloyd Daley, Tommy Cowan, and Geoffrey Chung, and their debut album, &quot;Forward on to Zion&quot; was produced by Clive Hunt and released in 1976. The follow-up, &quot;Arise&quot; (1978), was recorded under stressful conditions with internal rivalries threatening to break up the group, and after the album&#x27;s release, Collins left the band, to be eventually replaced by Carlton Manning. This line-up performed at the 1979 &quot;Reggae Sunsplash&quot; festival, but split up the following year.

Donald Manning had a brief solo career in the early 1980s, in which he recorded as Donald Abyssinian.

Bernard Collins launched his own version of the group in the late 1980s, with two versions of the group existing for a time. The original line-up reunited in 1998 and went on to record new material, including the singles &quot;African Princess&quot; and &quot;Swing Low&quot; and the album &quot;Reunion&quot;, although Collins was not involved in songwriting at this time. Collins left again in 1999 and released material as Bernard Collins &amp; the Abyssinians, releasing an album the same year.

The Abyssinians are credited on &quot;Slave Song&quot;, from Sade&#x27;s 2002 album, &quot;Lovers Live&quot;, which starts with a sample from the Abyssinians&#x27; song &quot;African Race&quot;.

Lynford Manning died on 25 June 2024.

<text>In mathematics, Hodge theory, named after W. V. D. Hodge, is a method for studying the cohomology groups of a smooth manifold &quot;M&quot; using partial differential equations. The key observation is that, given a Riemannian metric on &quot;M&quot;, every cohomology class has a canonical representative, a differential form that vanishes under the Laplacian operator of the metric. Such forms are called harmonic.

The theory was developed by Hodge in the 1930s to study algebraic geometry, and it built on the work of Georges de Rham on de Rham cohomology. It has major applications in two settings—Riemannian manifolds and Kähler manifolds. Hodge&#x27;s primary motivation, the study of complex projective varieties, is encompassed by the latter case. Hodge theory has become an important tool in algebraic geometry, particularly through its connection to the study of algebraic cycles.

While Hodge theory is intrinsically dependent upon the real and complex numbers, it can be applied to questions in number theory. In arithmetic situations, the tools of &quot;p&quot;-adic Hodge theory have given alternative proofs of, or analogous results to, classical Hodge theory.

==History==
The field of algebraic topology was still nascent in the 1920s. It had not yet developed the notion of cohomology, and the interaction between differential forms and topology was poorly understood. In 1928, Élie Cartan published an idea, &quot;Sur les nombres de Betti des espaces de groupes clos&quot;, in which he suggested—but did not prove—that differential forms and topology should be linked. Upon reading it, Georges de Rham, then a student, was inspired. In his 1931 thesis, he proved a result now called de Rham&#x27;s theorem. By Stokes&#x27; theorem, integration of differential forms along singular chains induces, for any compact smooth manifold &quot;M&quot;, a bilinear pairing as shown below:
:formula_1
As originally stated, de Rham&#x27;s theorem asserts that this is a perfect pairing, and that therefore each of the terms on the left-hand side are vector space duals of one another. In contemporary language, de Rham&#x27;s theorem is more often phrased as the statement that singular cohomology with real coefficients is isomorphic to de Rham cohomology:
:formula_2
De Rham&#x27;s original statement is then a consequence of the fact that over the reals, singular cohomology is the dual of singular homology.

Separately, a 1927 paper of Solomon Lefschetz used topological methods to reprove theorems of Riemann. In modern language, if &quot;ω&quot;1 and &quot;ω&quot;2 are holomorphic differentials on an algebraic curve &quot;C&quot;, then their wedge product is necessarily zero because &quot;C&quot; has only one complex dimension; consequently, the cup product of their cohomology classes is zero, and when made explicit, this gave Lefschetz a new proof of the Riemann relations. Additionally, if &quot;ω&quot; is a non-zero holomorphic differential, then formula_3 is a positive volume form, from which Lefschetz was able to rederive Riemann&#x27;s inequalities. In 1929, W. V. D. Hodge learned of Lefschetz&#x27;s paper. He immediately observed that similar principles applied to algebraic surfaces. More precisely, if &quot;ω&quot; is a non-zero holomorphic form on an algebraic surface, then formula_3 is positive, so the cup product of formula_5 and formula_6 must be non-zero. It follows that &quot;ω&quot; itself must represent a non-zero cohomology class, so its periods cannot all be zero. This resolved a question of Severi.

Hodge felt that these techniques should be applicable to higher dimensional varieties as well. His colleague Peter Fraser recommended de Rham&#x27;s thesis to him. In reading de Rham&#x27;s thesis, Hodge realized that the real and imaginary parts of a holomorphic 1-form on a Riemann surface were in some sense dual to each other. He suspected that there should be a similar duality in higher dimensions; this duality is now known as the Hodge star operator. He further conjectured that each cohomology class should have a distinguished representative with the property that both it and its dual vanish under the exterior derivative operator; these are now called harmonic forms. Hodge devoted most of the 1930s to this problem. His earliest published attempt at a proof appeared in 1933, but he considered it &quot;crude in the extreme&quot;. Hermann Weyl, one of the most brilliant mathematicians of the era, found himself unable to determine whether Hodge&#x27;s proof was correct or not. In 1936, Hodge published a new proof. While Hodge considered the new proof much superior, a serious flaw was discovered by Bohnenblust. Independently, Hermann Weyl and Kunihiko Kodaira modified Hodge&#x27;s proof to repair the error. This established Hodge&#x27;s sought-for isomorphism between harmonic forms and cohomology classes.
In retrospect it is clear that the technical difficulties in the existence theorem did not really require any significant new ideas, but merely a careful extension of classical methods. The real novelty, which was Hodge’s major contribution, was in the conception of harmonic integrals and their relevance to algebraic geometry. This triumph of concept over technique is reminiscent of a similar episode in the work of Hodge’s great predecessor Bernhard Riemann.

==Hodge theory for real manifolds==
===De Rham cohomology===
The Hodge theory references the de Rham complex. Let &quot;M&quot; be a smooth manifold. For a non-negative integer &quot;k&quot;, let Ω&quot;k&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) be the real vector space of smooth differential forms of degree &quot;k&quot; on &quot;M&quot;. The de Rham complex is the sequence of differential operators

:formula_7

where &quot;dk&quot; denotes the exterior derivative on Ω&quot;k&quot;(&quot;M&quot;). This is a cochain complex in the sense that (also written ). De Rham&#x27;s theorem says that the singular cohomology of &quot;M&quot; with real coefficients is computed by the de Rham complex:

:formula_8

===Operators in Hodge theory===
Choose a Riemannian metric &quot;g&quot; on &quot;M&quot; and recall that:

:formula_9

The metric yields an inner product on each fiber formula_10 by extending (see Gramian matrix) the inner product induced by &quot;g&quot; from each cotangent fiber formula_11 to its formula_12 exterior product: formula_10. The formula_14 inner product is then defined as the integral of the pointwise inner product of a given pair of &quot;k&quot;-forms over &quot;M&quot; with respect to the volume form formula_15 associated with &quot;g&quot;. Explicitly, given some formula_16 we have

:formula_17

Naturally the above inner product induces a norm, when that norm is finite on some fixed &quot;k&quot;-form:

:formula_18

then the integrand is a real valued, square integrable function on &quot;M&quot;, evaluated at a given point via its point-wise norms,

:formula_19

Consider the adjoint operator of &quot;d&quot; with respect to these inner products:

:formula_20

Then the Laplacian on forms is defined by

:formula_21

This is a second-order linear differential operator, generalizing the Laplacian for functions on R&quot;n&quot;. By definition, a form on &quot;M&quot; is harmonic if its Laplacian is zero:

:formula_22

The Laplacian appeared first in mathematical physics. In particular, Maxwell&#x27;s equations say that the electromagnetic field in a vacuum, i.e. absent any charges, is represented by a 2-form &quot;F&quot; such that on spacetime, viewed as Minkowski space of dimension 4.

Every harmonic form &quot;α&quot; on a closed Riemannian manifold is closed, meaning that . As a result, there is a canonical mapping formula_23. The Hodge theorem states that formula_24 is an isomorphism of vector spaces. In other words, each real cohomology class on &quot;M&quot; has a unique harmonic representative. Concretely, the harmonic representative is the unique closed form of minimum &quot;L&quot;2 norm that represents a given cohomology class. The Hodge theorem was proved using the theory of elliptic partial differential equations, with Hodge&#x27;s initial arguments completed by Kodaira and others in the 1940s.

For example, the Hodge theorem implies that the cohomology groups with real coefficients of a closed manifold are finite-dimensional. (Admittedly, there are other ways to prove this.) Indeed, the operators Δ are elliptic, and the kernel of an elliptic operator on a closed manifold is always a finite-dimensional vector space. Another consequence of the Hodge theorem is that a Riemannian metric on a closed manifold &quot;M&quot; determines a real-valued inner product on the integral cohomology of &quot;M&quot; modulo torsion. It follows, for example, that the image of the isometry group of &quot;M&quot; in the general linear group is finite (because the group of isometries of a lattice is finite).

A variant of the Hodge theorem is the Hodge decomposition. This says that there is a unique decomposition of any differential form &quot;ω&quot; on a closed Riemannian manifold as a sum of three parts in the form

:formula_25

in which &quot;γ&quot; is harmonic: . In terms of the &quot;L&quot;2 metric on differential forms, this gives an orthogonal direct sum decomposition:

:formula_26
The Hodge decomposition is a generalization of the Helmholtz decomposition for the de Rham complex.

===Hodge theory of elliptic complexes===
Atiyah and Bott defined elliptic complexes as a generalization of the de Rham complex. The Hodge theorem extends to this setting, as follows. Let formula_27 be vector bundles, equipped with metrics, on a closed smooth manifold &quot;M&quot; with a volume form &quot;dV&quot;. Suppose that

:formula_28

are linear differential operators acting on C∞ sections of these vector bundles, and that the induced sequence

:formula_29

is an elliptic complex. Introduce the direct sums:

: formula_30

and let &quot;L&quot; be the adjoint of &quot;L&quot;. Define the elliptic operator . As in the de Rham case, this yields the vector space of harmonic sections

:formula_31

Let formula_32 be the orthogonal projection, and let &quot;G&quot; be the Green&#x27;s operator for Δ. The Hodge theorem then asserts the following:

#&quot;H&quot; and &quot;G&quot; are well-defined.
#Id = &quot;H&quot; + Δ&quot;G&quot; = &quot;H&quot; + &quot;G&quot;Δ
#&quot;LG&quot; = &quot;GL&quot;, &quot;L&quot;&quot;G&quot; = &quot;GL&quot;
#The cohomology of the complex is canonically isomorphic to the space of harmonic sections, formula_33, in the sense that each cohomology class has a unique harmonic representative.

There is also a Hodge decomposition in this situation, generalizing the statement above for the de Rham complex.

==Hodge theory for complex projective varieties==

Let &quot;X&quot; be a smooth complex projective manifold, meaning that &quot;X&quot; is a closed complex submanifold of some complex projective space CP&quot;N&quot;. By Chow&#x27;s theorem, complex projective manifolds are automatically algebraic: they are defined by the vanishing of homogeneous polynomial equations on CP&quot;N&quot;. The standard Riemannian metric on CP&quot;N&quot; induces a Riemannian metric on &quot;X&quot; which has a strong compatibility with the complex structure, making &quot;X&quot; a Kähler manifold.

For a complex manifold &quot;X&quot; and a natural number &quot;r&quot;, every C∞ &quot;r&quot;-form on &quot;X&quot; (with complex coefficients) can be written uniquely as a sum of forms of with , meaning forms that can locally be written as a finite sum of terms, with each term taking the form
:formula_34
with &quot;f&quot; a C∞ function and the &quot;z&quot;s and &quot;w&quot;s holomorphic functions. On a Kähler manifold, the components of a harmonic form are again harmonic. Therefore, for any compact Kähler manifold &quot;X&quot;, the Hodge theorem gives a decomposition of the cohomology of &quot;X&quot; with complex coefficients as a direct sum of complex vector spaces:
:formula_35

This decomposition is in fact independent of the choice of Kähler metric (but there is no analogous decomposition for a general compact complex manifold). On the other hand, the Hodge decomposition genuinely depends on the structure of &quot;X&quot; as a complex manifold, whereas the group depends only on the underlying topological space of &quot;X&quot;.

Taking wedge products of these harmonic representatives corresponds to the cup product in cohomology, so the cup product with complex coefficients is compatible with the Hodge decomposition:

:formula_36

The piece &quot;H&quot;&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) of the Hodge decomposition can be identified with a coherent sheaf cohomology group, which depends only on &quot;X&quot; as a complex manifold (not on the choice of Kähler metric):
:formula_37
where Ω&quot;p&quot; denotes the sheaf of holomorphic &quot;p&quot;-forms on &quot;X&quot;. For example, &quot;H&quot;&quot;p&quot;,&quot;0&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is the space of holomorphic &quot;p&quot;-forms on &quot;X&quot;. (If &quot;X&quot; is projective, Serre&#x27;s GAGA theorem implies that a holomorphic &quot;p&quot;-form on all of &quot;X&quot; is in fact algebraic.)

On the other hand, the integral can be written as the cap product of the homology class of &quot;Z&quot; and the cohomology class represented by formula_38. By Poincaré duality, the homology class of &quot;Z&quot; is dual to a cohomology class which we will call [&quot;Z&quot;], and the cap product can be computed by taking the cup product of [&quot;Z&quot;] and α and capping with the fundamental class of &quot;X&quot;.

Because [&quot;Z&quot;] is a cohomology class, it has a Hodge decomposition. By the computation we did above, if we cup this class with any class of type formula_39, then we get zero. Because formula_40, we conclude that [&quot;Z&quot;] must lie in formula_41.

The Hodge number &quot;h&quot;&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) means the dimension of the complex vector space &quot;H&quot;&quot;p&quot;.&quot;q&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). These are important invariants of a smooth complex projective variety; they do not change when the complex structure of &quot;X&quot; is varied continuously, and yet they are in general not topological invariants. Among the properties of Hodge numbers are Hodge symmetry (because &quot;H&quot;&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is the complex conjugate of &quot;H&quot;&quot;q&quot;,&quot;p&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)) and (by Serre duality).

The Hodge numbers of a smooth complex projective variety (or compact Kähler manifold) can be listed in the Hodge diamond (shown in the case of complex dimension 2):

For example, every smooth projective curve of genus &quot;g&quot; has Hodge diamond
For another example, every K3 surface has Hodge diamond 
The Betti numbers of &quot;X&quot; are the sum of the Hodge numbers in a given row. A basic application of Hodge theory is then that the odd Betti numbers &quot;b&quot;2&quot;a&quot;+1 of a smooth complex projective variety (or compact Kähler manifold) are even, by Hodge symmetry. This is not true for compact complex manifolds in general, as shown by the example of the Hopf surface, which is diffeomorphic to and hence has .

The &quot;Kähler package&quot; is a powerful set of restrictions on the cohomology of smooth complex projective varieties (or compact Kähler manifolds), building on Hodge theory. The results include the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, the hard Lefschetz theorem, and the Hodge–Riemann bilinear relations. Many of these results follow from fundamental technical tools which may be proven for compact Kähler manifolds using Hodge theory, including the Kähler identities and the formula_42-lemma.

Hodge theory and extensions such as non-abelian Hodge theory also give strong restrictions on the possible fundamental groups of compact Kähler manifolds.

==Algebraic cycles and the Hodge conjecture==

Let formula_43 be a smooth complex projective variety. A complex subvariety formula_44 in formula_43 of codimension formula_46 defines an element of the cohomology group formula_47. Moreover, the resulting class has a special property: its image in the complex cohomology formula_48 lies in the middle piece of the Hodge decomposition, formula_49. The Hodge conjecture predicts a converse: every element of formula_47 whose image in complex cohomology lies in the subspace formula_49 should have a positive integral multiple that is a formula_52-linear combination of classes of complex subvarieties of formula_43. (Such a linear combination is called an algebraic cycle on formula_43.)

A crucial point is that the Hodge decomposition is a decomposition of cohomology with complex coefficients that usually does not come from a decomposition of cohomology with integral (or rational) coefficients. As a result, the intersection
:formula_55
may be much smaller than the whole group formula_56, even if the Hodge number formula_57 is big. In short, the Hodge conjecture predicts that the possible &quot;shapes&quot; of complex subvarieties of formula_43 (as described by cohomology) are determined by the Hodge structure of formula_43 (the combination of integral cohomology with the Hodge decomposition of complex cohomology).

The Lefschetz (1,1)-theorem says that the Hodge conjecture is true for formula_60 (even integrally, that is, without the need for a positive integral multiple in the statement).

The Hodge structure of a variety formula_43 describes the integrals of algebraic differential forms on formula_43 over homology classes in formula_43. In this sense, Hodge theory is related to a basic issue in calculus: there is in general no &quot;formula&quot; for the integral of an algebraic function. In particular, definite integrals of algebraic functions, known as periods, can be transcendental numbers. The difficulty of the Hodge conjecture reflects the lack of understanding of such integrals in general.

Example: For a smooth complex projective K3 surface formula_43, the group formula_65 is isomorphic to formula_66, and formula_67 is isomorphic to formula_68. Their intersection can have rank anywhere between 1 and 20; this rank is called the Picard number of formula_43. The moduli space of all projective K3 surfaces has a countably infinite set of components, each of complex dimension 19. The subspace of K3 surfaces with Picard number formula_70 has dimension formula_71. (Thus, for most projective K3 surfaces, the intersection of formula_65 with formula_67 is isomorphic to formula_74, but for &quot;special&quot; K3 surfaces the intersection can be bigger.)

This example suggests several different roles played by Hodge theory in complex algebraic geometry. First, Hodge theory gives restrictions on which topological spaces can have the structure of a smooth complex projective variety. Second, Hodge theory gives information about the moduli space of smooth complex projective varieties with a given topological type. The best case is when the Torelli theorem holds, meaning that the variety is determined up to isomorphism by its Hodge structure. Finally, Hodge theory gives information about the Chow group of algebraic cycles on a given variety. The Hodge conjecture is about the image of the cycle map from Chow groups to ordinary cohomology, but Hodge theory also gives information about the kernel of the cycle map, for example using the intermediate Jacobians which are built from the Hodge structure.

==Generalizations==
Mixed Hodge theory, developed by Pierre Deligne, extends Hodge theory to all complex algebraic varieties, not necessarily smooth or compact. Namely, the cohomology of any complex algebraic variety has a more general type of decomposition, a mixed Hodge structure.

A different generalization of Hodge theory to singular varieties is provided by intersection homology. Namely, Morihiko Saito showed that the intersection homology of any complex projective variety (not necessarily smooth) has a pure Hodge structure, just as in the smooth case. In fact, the whole Kähler package extends to intersection homology.

A fundamental aspect of complex geometry is that there are continuous families of non-isomorphic complex manifolds (which are all diffeomorphic as real manifolds). Phillip Griffiths&#x27;s notion of a variation of Hodge structure describes how the Hodge structure of a smooth complex projective variety formula_43 varies when formula_43 varies. In geometric terms, this amounts to studying the period mapping associated to a family of varieties. Saito&#x27;s theory of Hodge modules is a generalization. Roughly speaking, a mixed Hodge module on a variety formula_43 is a sheaf of mixed Hodge structures over formula_43, as would arise from a family of varieties which need not be smooth or compact.

<text>In computer science, resource starvation is a problem encountered in concurrent computing where a process is perpetually denied necessary resources to process its work. Starvation may be caused by errors in a scheduling or mutual exclusion algorithm, but can also be caused by resource leaks, and can be intentionally caused via a denial-of-service attack such as a fork bomb.

When starvation is impossible in a concurrent algorithm, the algorithm is called starvation-free, lockout-freed or said to have finite bypass. This property is an instance of liveness, and is one of the two requirements for any mutual exclusion algorithm; the other being correctness. The name &quot;finite bypass&quot; means that any process (concurrent part) of the algorithm is bypassed at most a finite number times before being allowed access to the shared resource.

==Scheduling==
Starvation is usually caused by an overly simplistic scheduling algorithm. For example, if a (poorly designed) multi-tasking system always switches between the first two tasks while a third never gets to run, then the third task is being starved of CPU time. The scheduling algorithm, which is part of the kernel, is supposed to allocate resources equitably; that is, the algorithm should allocate resources so that no process perpetually lacks necessary resources.

Many operating system schedulers employ the concept of process priority. A high priority process A will run before a low priority process B. If the high priority process (process A) blocks and never yields, the low priority process (B) will (in some systems) never be scheduled—it will experience starvation. If there is an even higher priority process X, which is dependent on a result from process B, then process X might never finish, even though it is the most important process in the system. This condition is called a priority inversion. Modern scheduling algorithms normally contain code to guarantee that all processes will receive a minimum amount of each important resource (most often CPU time) in order to prevent any process from being subjected to starvation.

In computer networks, especially wireless networks, scheduling algorithms may suffer from scheduling starvation. An example is maximum throughput scheduling.

Starvation is normally caused by deadlock in that it causes a process to freeze. Two or more processes become deadlocked when each of them is doing nothing while waiting for a resource occupied by another program in the same set. On the other hand, a process is in starvation when it is waiting for a resource that is continuously given to other processes. Starvation-freedom is a stronger guarantee than the absence of deadlock: a mutual exclusion algorithm that must choose to allow one of two processes into a critical section and picks one arbitrarily is deadlock-free, but not starvation-free.

A possible solution to starvation is to use a scheduling algorithm with priority queue that also uses the aging technique. Aging is a technique of gradually increasing the priority of processes that wait in the system for a long time.
