<text>Nicolae Văcăroiu (; born 5 December 1943) is a Romanian politician, member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), who served as Prime Minister between 1992 and 1996. Before the 1989 Revolution, he worked at the Committee for State Planning, together with Theodor Stolojan. He was the President of the Senate of Romania for almost eight years, during two legislatures (2000–2004 and 2004–2008).

== Political activity ==
On November 20, 1992, he was appointed to the role of Prime Minister of Romania. His prime ministerial mandate began with some limited economic reforms in the areas of fiscal, budgetary, monetary, and industrial prices, which made possible the resumption of Romania&#x27;s economic growth starting in 1993. Between 1993 and 1996, the GDP grew by 17.5%, after a contraction of 24.5% in 1990-1992 immediately after the fall of the communist regime. After a drop in industrial production of 49% between 1990 and 1992, there was an increase of 22% in the 1993-1996 period. However, this growth was not sustainable, with many enterprises remaining under the weak management of the state, and produced much in stock just to report rising production figures. At the same time, foreign investment was almost non-existent, as the government opposed any significant privatization in industry, although at that time many enterprises could still be sold at reasonable prices. These delays caused Romania to enter into recession at the end of Văcăroiu&#x27;s tenure as well as Bulgaria. Instead, Văcăroiu opted for an inefficient privatization method: the distribution of some enterprises to the general population, with the option of subscribing to some state-owned companies, but without providing any real and relevant information on the economic situation of those enterprises. At the end of his term, the situation of most state-owned enterprises was disastrous, even in Bancorex (a foreign trade bank with a prospect of success), which made Romania close to unable to pay its debts.

Internationally, as regards the prospect of accession to the European Union, on 1 February 1993 the European Association Agreement with the European Community, which entered into force on 1 February 1995, was signed, and in June 1995 it obtained the agreement of all the forces policy on the objective of the country&#x27;s accession to the European Union. Also, the first request for NATO membership was made. As far as relations with neighbors are concerned, the settlement of bilateral treaties has been delayed. As Yugoslavia was under international embargo because of its actions in Croatia and Bosnia, relations with it were frozen. Moldova and Ukraine accused Romania of irredentism, among other things because the coalition that supported Văcăroiu&#x27;s cabinet included nationalist and conservative-communist forces (the Romanian National Unity Party, the Greater Romania Party, and the Socialist Party of Labour) and because it insisted that the bilateral treaties referring to the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which had led to territorial losses for Romania to the Soviet Union, from which Ukraine and Moldova had inherited their borders (those tensions diminished after Văcăroiu&#x27;s and Oliviu Gherman&#x27;s visits to Chișinău and Kyiv in the first half of 1995). Hungary, for its part, negotiated a basic treaty, but Romania refused to accept the inclusion in this treaty of a commitment to comply with Council of Europe&#x27;s Recommendation 1201 on Minorities. The Treaty with Hungary was signed in September 1996, and in May 1996 the treaty with Yugoslavia could be signed after the Dayton Agreement and the lifting of the embargo on that country.

Following the suspension of President Traian Băsescu by the Parliament of Romania on 19 April 2007, Nicolae Văcăroiu became the interim president of Romania after the Constitutional Court of Romania acknowledged the vote of the Parliament, until the impeachment referendum results were announced on 23 May 2007. During his interim presidency, Văcăroiu, according to the Constitution of Romania had all the prerogatives of a president, minus three of them: he could not dissolve the Parliament, he could not address the Parliament, nor organize a public referendum.
On 14 October 2008, he was voted by the Parliament as President of the Court of Audit.

== Professional activity ==

Văcăroiu obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economic studies from the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies, Faculty of Credit and Finance (1964–1969).

* In 1969, after graduation, he was employed as a trainee economist at the State Planning Committee (C.P.S.), where he underwent all hierarchical stages from the position of economist to the director of the Finance Department. Coordinated financial, monetary and price activities, conducted tracking, control and reporting, analyzed and prepared annual proposals on performance indicators for state-owned productive enterprises, and participated on the drafting of the quarterly credit plans and cashflow charts, as well as drafting of normative acts in the respective fields.
* Deputy Minister within the National Ministry of Economy (established through C.S.P.’s reorganization). In 1990, he participated in the implementation of normative acts adopted by the Provisional Council of the National Union. He was part of the team, which, under the coordination of academician Tudorel Postolache, elaborated the &quot;Romanian Reform Strategy&quot; to ensure the transition to democracy and the market economy.
*State Secretary within the Ministry of Finance. Văcăroiu served as Head of the Prices Department position from which he coordinated the process of elaborating the strategy of gradual liberalization of prices in the Romanian economy. He participated in drafting laws on price liberalization. Subsequently, he was appointed Head of the Tax and Tax Department, coordinating the tax reform process in order to harmonize with European Union legislation, preparing the introduction of VAT instead of the tax on the movement of goods. Also in this position started preparations for the introduction of the global tax for individuals. In 1992 he was Chairman of the Interministerial Committee of Guarantees and Foreign Trade Credits.
* Prime Minister within the Romanian Government. In November 1992, Văcăroiu was appointed Prime Minister of Romania, without being a member of any political party, at the proposal of the Party of Social Democracy of Romania (P.D.S.R.), a public office he exercised until December 1996. The main objectives of the Governance Program were: economic recovery and rebuilding the macroeconomic stability, undertaking the necessary reforms in all areas of activity in order to ensure their competitiveness and efficiency, ensuring stability and social balance, preparing for accession into European and Euro-Atlantic structures.A. Internally, during the period 1993–1996, as a result of the economic reforms in the field of prices, fiscal-budget, monetary and industrial, it was possible to resume Romania&#x27;s economic growth as follows:
** Romania&#x27;s Gross domestic product (GDP) had increased by 17.4%, recovering by 71% of the economic decline from 1990 to 1992, when the GDP had decreased in real terms by 24.5%;
** The industrial production has increased (since 1993) by 21.7%, recovering 40.2% of the decline registered at the end of 1992 (54%). The entire production increase was due to the increase in labor productivity by 52.8%. Industrial production has been marketed through:
**# increase in exports from $3.4 billion in 1992 to $4.2 billion in 1993 and $6.5 billion in 1996;
**# increasing the investment rate from 19.2% of GDP in 1992 to 23.0% of GDP in 1996;
**# increase in the population&#x27;s consumption through measures undertaken to restore purchasing power.
** The average general government deficit in the period 1993-1996 was -2.2% of GDP compared to the one in 1992 of -4.6% of GDP;
** In order to significantly mitigate the inflation while accelerating the reforms, a mix of measures related to financial, monetary and price policies were required, as it follows:
*** the shock liberalization of prices whilst eliminating subsidies for products and services for the population since the 1st of May 1993;
***the scope of the products and services whose prices were under supervision decreased from 112 positions to just 24 positions;
***the number of imported products for the household consumption (bread, pork and poultry, dairy products, etc.);
***some public services (urban passenger transport, rail transport, postal and communications services, etc.);
***natural and organizational monopolies (electricity and heat, natural gas);
***some subsidized products (human medicines, minerals);
***the shock liberalization of prices led to an increase in inflation from 195.5% in 1992 to 295.5% in 1993. Effects:
***#reducing the general government deficit from - 4.6% of GDP in 1992 at -0.4% of GDP in 1993;
***#the current account deficit of the balance of payments decreased from 8% of GDP in 1992 to 4.5% of GDP in 1993;
***the inflation decreased from 295.5% in 1993 to 61.7% in 1994 and 27.8% in 1995;
***the introduction since the 1-st of July 1993 of the value added tax which replaced the old tax on the movement of goods. An 18% quota was set except for:
***#9% VAT on products of strict necessity in the consumption of the population (bread, milk, meat, etc.), press and publications;
***#VAT rate 0 (zero) with right to deduct on the heat supplied to the population;
***reduction of the profit tax rate from 45% to 38% and in agriculture to 25%;
***50% reduction of the tax on the profit from exports and the one used for technological modernization;
***the system of customs duties has been revised by aligning it with the one applied in the Member States of the European Union;
***gradual reduction of the production subsidies;
***the excises’ system has been modified either by increasing it or setting it up for some import products that were not strictly necessary, with favorable effects of mitigating the country&#x27;s commercial and currency deficit;
***the application of measures leading to mitigation of the quasi-fiscal deficit from an average of 16.5% of the GDP over the 1990-1992 period to an average of 6.5% of the GDP over the 1993-1996 period;
***budget&#x27;s decentralization and strengthening the competences of local authorities in the field of taxation;
***over the entire period, more than 8 billion lei were granted from the state budget for the establishment and development of small and medium-sized enterprises (lending credits with  bearing interest - 50% of the National Bank of Romania ‹NBR› reference interest rate);
***the establishment of the Romanian Loan Guarantee Fund for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (with the participation of the state budget). By the end of 1996 there were 526,563 commercial companies with private capital - especially small and medium-sized ones, out of which 47,294 were trading companies with foreign participation;
**Concurrently with the application of the prices’ shock liberalization and the abolition of subsidies in 1993; salaries, pensions and social allowances were increased by 3.1 times, covering the inflation rate of 295.5%. Basically, the purchasing power of the population has been restored. Subsequently, a periodical indexation (usually on quarterly basis) of pensions, wages and social allowances with the consumer price index was applied.
**In 1993, the guarantee of payment of the gross minimum wage was introduced, obligatory for all economic agents, regardless of the form of ownership. In 1995 it was exempt from income tax.
**&quot;In the field of sectoral and privatization policies, it is worth mentioning:&quot;
***86 Restructuring and Development Strategies were developed aiming at a 2025 horizon, out of which 55 were industry strategies;
***For the strategic areas (national security), the concerned issues related to: oil, natural gas, electricity and heat distribution, aluminum, cement, communications, actions were undertake in the sense of creating modern, performing, state-owned capital management privatization. The decision to privatize the capital will be taken after 2025.
***#The Petroleum Company (PETROM) was set up in the field of oil exploration, exploitation, production and distribution activities. It consisted of 10 entities (5 large combines with an oil processing capacity of about 4 billion tons of crude oil each and 5 (five) small refineries, which usually produced oils, aiming at keeping in the state portfolio three large plants (Petromin, Arpechim, Petrobrazi) and two (two) small special oil refineries. The rest of the entities will be sold through an international tender and the funds obtained will be used by Petrom to modernize the state-owned strategic entities (ENI - Italy). By the end of 2025, it was possible to act for the full privatization of the management. Following this strategy the state budget financed more than 300 million dollars for the three large plants, modernizing the primary refining part;
***#In the area of communications the state budget invested approx.600 million dollars, installing 7,000 km of optical fiber on the territory of the country. In 1996, Romtelecom&#x27;s market value was 10 billion dollars. It was sold in 1997 to the Greek state with 335 million dollars (35% shares and 16% usufruct right);
***The export of logs and scrap (despite all the pressure from IMF) was forbidden in view of processing (within the country) these raw materials in the metallurgical, furniture and other areas;
***Institutionally strengthening of the National Strategic Reserve of the State by reviewing stocks of raw materials and products: 2 (two) million tons of wheat (to avoid importing in unfavorable agricultural years at prices two or three times higher than the market price), 10 thousand tons of block aluminum, cement, building materials, food, medicines, tents, blankets, fuels, etc.;
***Legislation in the field of privatization, adopted in 1991–1992, provided for the distribution of 70% of the share capital of state-owned companies to the State Property Fund (FPS) for the purpose of privatization and 30% by free transfer to citizens who reached the age of 18 years. 15.5 million certificates were distributed to citizens which, until the transfer process ended, were under the administration of the five (5) Private Ownership Funds (PPF). The ownership certificate was not nominative and the transaction was not foreseen in the law. The process of converting ownership certificates into shares has not been achieved for years. Most of the citizens considered them worthless and began selling them on the unorganized market at symbolic prices, respectively 0.5-1% of the actual value of a certificate, which in 1995 was 1 million lei. As a result, a few „business people with initiative” bought (including through external credits) approximate 4 million property certificates. In order to eliminate this speculative phenomena, the Văcăroiu Government issued a special law whereby nominative coupons for privatization were issued instead of certificates. A coupon was worth 1 million lei, out of which 25,000 lei was the old certificate of ownership. A total of 17 million privatization coupons have been issued and distributed through the Romanian Post Office. At the same time, a list of 3,000 companies was issued and published to which citizens were obliged to opt for the company to which they submitted the coupon and received the shareholder certificate instead. Under the law, citizens could also deposit coupons with the State Property Fund. The whole process took place in 1995;
****Privatization of commercial companies from the State Property Fund  practically began in 1993. During 1993-1996 2,700 companies were privatized, out of which 750 medium and large companies. Privatization revenues amounted to a total of more than $900 million;
****At the end of 1996, the private sector participated in a percentage of 54.9% of GDP compared to 26.4% of GDP in 1992;
****In the field of privatization, the Văcăroiu Government encountered difficulties due to the measure undertaken in 1992 to pass the State Property Fund from under the Government&#x27;s subordination to that of the Parliament;
**&quot;In the field of monetary policy,&quot; the NBR carried out an intensive reform program in 1993–1996 in close correlation with the Government&#x27;s economic, financial and price policies. Main achievements:
***since 01.04.1994 the foreign exchange market was liberalized and the exchange rate was established based on the relationship between supply and demand;
***changing the volume and structure of the minimum reserves of commercial banks set up by the NBR in order to ensure an optimal level of liquidity in the banking system;
***improving the financing mechanism of the budget deficit and putting into operation of the State Treasury general account mechanism;
***introduction of new payment instruments (check, promissory note, bill of exchange);
***establishment of the Compensation House;
***establishment of Incident Payments Center;
***the establishment in August 1996 within the banking system of the Deposits Guarantee Fund, which ensures the payment of the savings  to the natural persons within a ceiling.
**&quot;In the agricultural field:&quot;
***intensification of the process to reestablish the ownership right in agriculture area, by the assignment of ownership titles;
***recommissioning approximate half of the areas to be used for irrigation (about 765 thousand ha in 1996);
***subsidizing part of the irrigation costs to the state budget;
***adjusting the price for milk, bread, pork and poultry, depending on the evolution of production costs. These four products were declared to be of national interest, benefiting from the application of minimum guaranteed purchase prices by the State;
***the introduction of incentives in the form of producer premiums, reference prices for imports, etc., to stimulate domestic agricultural producers;
***establishment of the Farm Guarantee Fund for farmers: low-interest credit lines (50% of the NBR&#x27;s reference interest rate);
***restart of works at Siret-Danube channel, financed by the state budget;
***completion of irrigation systems in the Covurlui area.
**A priority of the Văcăroiu&#x27;s Government, for the entire period 1993–1996, were the investments made in upgrading industry, communications, national and local road infrastructure, etc., in health and education. Sources of funding: state budget and external loans.
***For example, the National Road Rehabilitation and Modernization Program has been developed and works over 1,000 km have been completed. The works on the Bucharest-Constanta highway were reassumed, etc. The achievements in the field of investments by sectors of activity during 1993-1996 are contained in the &quot; White Book of the Văcăroiu’s Government&quot;, drafted and disseminated at the end of 1996.
**On June 1, 1995 the macro-economic stability in Romania was restored. The applied reform measures have been well seen by the international bodies (IMF, World Bank) and the European Community;
**#international rating agencies of the EU have rated in 1995 Romania with BB +, respectively at the level of Poland and Hungary;

<doc id="508403" wikidata="Q7755756" url="?curid=508403" title="The Owl Service">
<text>The Owl Service is a low fantasy novel for young adults by Alan Garner, published by Collins in 1967. Set in modern Wales, it is an adaptation of the story of the mythical Welsh woman Blodeuwedd, an &quot;expression of the myth&quot; in the author&#x27;s words.

Garner won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book by a British author. It was named one of the top ten Medal-winning works for the 70th anniversary celebration in 2007, selected by a panel to compose the ballot for a public election of the all-time favourite. Garner also won the second annual Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize, a similar award that authors may not win twice. Only six books have won both awards in the 45 years from 1966 to 2011.

The mythical Blodeuwedd is featured in the Fourth Branch of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot;. She is a woman created from flowers by the king of Gwynedd, Math, and the magician and trickster Gwydion, for a man who was cursed to take no human wife. She betrays her husband Lleu in favour of another man, Gronw, and is turned into an owl as punishment for inducing Gronw to kill Lleu. In Garner&#x27;s tale three teenagers find themselves re-enacting the story. They awaken the legend by finding plates from a dinner service with an owl pattern, which gives the novel its title.

Henry Z. Walck published the first US edition in 1968.

==Plot summary==

Roger and Alison are stepbrother and sister. Alison&#x27;s father died and her mother Margaret has married Clive, a businessman and former RAF officer. Clive&#x27;s former wife was notoriously unfaithful, bringing shame to the family and a particular kind of pain to his son, Roger. To bond the new family together they are spending a few weeks of the summer in an isolated valley in Wales, a few hours&#x27; drive from Aberystwyth. They occupy a fine house formerly owned by Alison&#x27;s father, subsequently transferred to her to avoid death duty. He in turn inherited it from a cousin, Bertram, who died there in mysterious circumstances around the time Alison was born.

With the house comes Huw Halfbacon, also known as Huw the Flitch, a handyman and gardener. He is the last of the original domestic staff to remain at the house. The former cook, Nancy, had left to live in Aberystwyth but is offered a substantial amount to come and resume her duties. With her comes her son Gwyn. He has never seen the valley before but knows everything about it, courtesy of his mother&#x27;s stories. Someone else who knows a lot about the place is Huw, but he is very mysterious about it. Oddly, Nancy has told Gwyn nothing about Huw.

Alison hears scratching noises in the attic above her bed and persuades Gwyn to investigate. He finds stacks of dinner plates with a floral pattern. When he picks one up, something odd happens. He almost falls through the ceiling while simultaneously Roger, lounging by a large flat stone near the river, hears a scream and seems to see something flying through the air toward him. The stone is known as the Stone of Gronw. It has a hole neatly bored through it, and legend says that Lleu killed Gronw by throwing his spear clear through the stone that Gronw was holding to shield himself.

Alison begins behaving peculiarly. She traces the pattern on the plate onto paper and folds the result to make an owl. Finding out that Gwyn has been in the attic, Nancy demands that Alison give up the plate. Alison asserts she has no right to it, and eventually produces a blank white plate. She maintains that the pattern disappeared from the plate. Alison becomes obsessed by the plates. One by one she traces them and makes the owls, and one by one the plates become blank. The owls themselves disappear, though no one cares at first about some folded paper models.

In the house&#x27;s billiard room part of the wall has been covered with pebble-dash. Bit by bit this begins to crack and fall away, exposing first a pair of painted eyes, and then an entire portrait of a woman made of flowers. Tensions between the occupants of the house begin to rise. Gwyn is intelligent and wants to further his education, but Clive expresses the stereotypical clannish closed-ranks attitudes of the upper middle class towards him. Roger begins to feel hostile despite his initial friendliness. Eventually he takes to ridiculing Gwyn&#x27;s efforts to improve himself with elocution lessons on gramophone records, calling them &quot;improve-a-prole.&quot; Alison seems friendly to Gwyn and the two go on long walks together. She has visions where she sees herself next to him, even though he is some distance away. Margaret, her mother, never appears but the need to keep her happy affects everyone else.

As the holiday slides into disaster, the British attitude of &quot;seeing it through to the end&quot; prevails, even though Clive could pay off all the staff and leave at any time. Nancy repeatedly threatens to quit, and is repeatedly mollified with crisp banknotes. She constantly warns Gwyn to stay away from the others, lest he be taken out of school and forced to work in a shop to earn some money. Nancy gradually reveals her resentment of Margaret and Alison, as she once expected to marry Bertram and should have been mistress of the very house she toils in.

Competition between the boys for Alison is, at most, a subtext here, although Garner&#x27;s television script is much more overt about Gwyn&#x27;s attraction to her, despite his poverty. Alison, notwithstanding any attraction to him, would rather keep her privileges, such as her tennis club membership, than cross her mother. This is something she eventually admits to Gwyn.

The mysterious Huw presides over this like some ringmaster at a circus, making strange pronouncements. There is a background of odd comments from the villagers, noises of motorcycles in the distance, sounds of birds, and mysterious noises from locked buildings.

Gwyn follows Alison on one of her inexplicable midnight walks. She is completing her tracing of the plates somewhere in the woods. Gwyn is harassed by columns of flame, which he tries to convince himself are merely marsh gas. He finds Alison when she has made the final owl, then escorts her back to the house. Huw is waiting, and greets them with the remark &quot;She&#x27;s come.&quot;

By this time the connection between the legend and the events is becoming clear. Gwyn tries to see things rationally. He attempts to run away, walking up the sides of the valley as the weather worsens, but is chased back by a pack of sheepdogs. Stealing Roger&#x27;s hiking gear, he tries the other side of the valley, only to find Huw waiting for him. Huw tells him of the power that exists in the valley, how those of the blood have to re-enact the legend each time, and how Blodeuwedd always comes as owls instead of flowers because of the hatred. Huw, of course, is Gwyn&#x27;s real father, so Gwyn is the next generation. Huw was responsible for Bertram&#x27;s death, sabotaging the old motorcycle Bertram liked to ride around the garden, not realising he would take it out on the dangerous hill road. The dinner plates and the wall painting were done by Huw&#x27;s ancestors, trying to lock up the magic in their creations, but Alison has let it loose again.

Huw directs Gwyn to a crack in an ancient tree where he finds various things, including a spear head. All the men of Huw&#x27;s line come to this tree, where they leave something and take something. Gwyn removes a carved stone, leaving a cheap owl-decorated trinket. He tells Huw to give the stone to Alison. Gwyn is going to return to the house and leave with his mother, who has finally and irrevocably quit.

In a locked room, Roger discovers a stuffed owl, which Bertram shot in his own attempt to lay the ghost of Blodeuwedd, along with all the paper owls that have traced intricate patterns in the dust of a storeroom. He also finds the sabotaged motorcycle. Nancy charges in and wrecks the place, destroying the owl and then attempting to knock the very feathers out of the air.

Alison, having been given the stone by Huw, collapses and is brought into the kitchen, where she writhes in the grip of some force that makes claw marks on her skin. Huw begs Gwyn to comfort her, but Gwyn by now feels totally betrayed by Alison and can say nothing. A storm rages outside, branches smashing through the windows and skylight, a sound of owls and eagles pressing in on them. Feathers swirl in the room and trace owl patterns on the walls and ceiling.

Roger is desperate, abasing himself before Gwyn, but to no avail. &quot;It is always owls, over and over and over,&quot; says Huw. Then Roger shouts that it&#x27;s not true, that she is flowers. He yells this at Alison until abruptly all is peaceful, and the room is filled not with feathers but with petals.

==Writing==

Garner spent four years researching and writing the book. He learned Welsh &quot;in order not to use it&quot; in the dialogue—nor to use dialect, as in what he calls the &quot;Come you here, bach&quot; school of writing—because he believed that doing so would only superficially express what it is to be Welsh.

==Themes==
John Rowe Townsend cited the theme of ancient but living legend, which also appears in Garner&#x27;s earlier books, saying that in this book &quot;Garner added to his gift for absorbing old tales and retransmitting them with increased power a new grasp of the inward, emotional content of an incident or situation.&quot;

Another fellow reteller of Welsh material in English, Susan Cooper said that the novel can be called &quot;true fantasy&quot;, &quot;subtle and overwhelming&quot;. Penelope Farmer wrote, &quot;I doubt if you could find any piece of realistic fiction for adolescents that says a quarter as much about adolescence as Alan Garner&#x27;s &quot;The Owl Service&quot;.&quot;

Gillian Polack notes that although “Alan Garner doesn’t explore the Middle Ages deeply in &quot;The Owl Service&quot;”, he deftly utilises “one small legend to build a modern study of class and personality” which indicates that “where you come from and what opportunities your life gives you can open and close life choices”.

==Inspiration==

According to his Postscript included in the 2017 HarperCollins (London) edition, pp216–219, Garner had &quot;The sensation of finding, not inventing, a story ... It was all there, waiting, and I was the archaeologist picking away the earth to reveal the bones&quot;. He described 4 key inspirations leading to, and directly providing key elements of, the story, in both book and video forms.

First, (p216)

::It began when I read an old Welsh legend about Lleu, and his wife Blodeuwedd who was made for him out of flowers.

Second, (p217)

::The legend stuck in my mind for several years, and then one day my mother-in-law showed me an old dinner service. She had noticed that the floral pattern round the edge of the plates could be seen as the body, wings, and head of an owl. My wife, Griselda, traced the pattern, juggled it a bit, folded the pattern together and there it was, a model paper owl, which she perched on the back of a chair.

Third, (p217)

::But even so, for a long time nothing else would come. Then, by chance, we went to stay at a house in a remote valley in North Wales. Within hours of arriving I knew that I had found the setting for the story, or the setting had found me. Its atmosphere fitted both the original legend and the nature of the dinner service. Ideas began to grow. [...] The story took shape. I looked around for more ideas. The lie of the land fitted the descriptions in the legend. Everything was where it ought to be. The legend could have happened here. As I stood on the doorstep at night, thinking these things, an owl brushed its wings in my face.

Fourth, he cited a local&#x27;s key contribution: (pp217–218)

::Dafydd Rees was eighty-one years old. He was known in the valley as Clocydd, &quot;bell-ringer&quot;, because he had rung the church bell for sixty-five years, after his uncle retired from the same job after seventy years. Dafydd had worked as the caretaker and gardener of the house since 1898. He was the greatest help to me, since he let me in to his knowledge of the valley, its history, its traditions, its folklore. Everything that Gwyn, in the book, tells Alison about the valley, is what Dafydd told me. [...]

In its re-telling in video form, Garner described (p219) the later making of the television series, filmed in the valley itself, as &quot;a kind of magical madness&quot;, saying it &quot;had made the story...more real than reality&quot;.

::I found the experience hard to bear, because characters —who had lived in my head for so many years— were now really in the valley and really speaking the words that I had written. What had been a thought was now happening in front of me.

The abrupt and entire removing of crew, kit, and actors left him with mixed emotions and he closed with:

::For me, in the valley where I had set the story, it was a sense of loss. The valley had not changed. It was as it had been before I ever knew it. For a few hectic weeks my thoughts had taken on shapes, and moved as people in the landscape where I had imagined them. But now they had gone, and all was as it had always been.
::&quot;It was a good time,&quot; Dafydd wrote in a letter afterwards. &quot;I have been to the stone. She is lonely now.&quot;

===The dinner service===
The pattern of the dinner service, a floral design in which some &quot;flowers&quot; can be read as &quot;owls&quot; when upside down, was designed for Old Hall by Christopher Dresser (died 1904). Garner sought to identify the designer for more than forty years.

Peter Plummer, the producer and director of the television adaptation, described in 1979 a nationwide search for surviving dinner services with the same owl/flower pattern, conducted in association with &quot;TV Times&quot; during 1969:

::&quot;I only know now that there are precious few of these sets in circulation ... (we) only managed to turn up three other copies, one of which, curiously enough, had been accompanied by very unpleasant associations of disaster in the family which had owned it (and one of the other families suddenly woke up to what it was they were eating their tea off while watching the transmission of the first episode).&quot;

In 2012 Garner mentioned that he had only ever seen five plates with the design.

==Television adaptation==

&quot;The Owl Service&quot; was made into a Granada Television television serial of the same name in 1969. It was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 2000.

<text>Victor Ciorbea (; born on 26 October 1954) is a Romanian jurist, politician, and civil/public servant. He was the Mayor of Bucharest between 1996 and 1997 and, after his resignation from this public dignity/position, Prime Minister of Romania from 12 December 1996 to 30 March 1998. He had also served as the Ombudsman between 2014 and 2019.

==Biography==
Born in Ponor, Alba County on 26 October 1954, Ciorbea trained as a jurist, graduating from Babeș-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca in 1979. He worked for the municipal tribunal in Bucharest, as well as lecturing in Law at the University of Bucharest. He was awarded a doctorate in Law by the University of Bucharest, and later specialized in management at Case Western Reserve University in the United States (1992).

Originally a trade unionist (between 1990 and 1996, he was leader of the Federation of Free Trade Unions in Education, FSLI, and, between 1990 and 1993, leader of the nationwide National Confederation of Free Trade Unions of Romania – Brotherhood) and member of the National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚ-CD). He was backed for the premiership by the Romanian Democratic Convention (CDR) after the elections of 1996. Ciorbea enforced several measures in order to advance Romania&#x27;s transition toward a market economy, including an austerity budget, following a program known as &quot;Contractul cu România&quot; (&quot;Contract with Romania&quot;).

He resigned following a conflict with PNȚ-CD leader Ion Diaconescu, moving on to found the minor &quot;Alianța Natională Creștin Democrată&quot; (the National Christian Democratic Alliance, ANCD), which merged back into the PNȚ-CD after the latter lost the 2000 elections, and soon after became leader of the reunited party.

Faced with the task of regaining voter confidence, Ciorbea resigned his party office in 2004, in favour of Gheorghe Ciuhandu, the Mayor of Timișoara. Following the latter&#x27;s nomination, the party became the Christian Democratic National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚ-CD).

In 2012, as a member of National Liberal Party (PNL), he was elected as senator. In April 2014, without the support of his own party colleagues, but with the help of the ruling PSD, he became Ombudsman.

<doc id="508409" wikidata="Q1063695" url="?curid=508409" title="Charles Batteux">
<text>Charles Batteux (6 May 171314 July 1780) was a French philosopher and writer on aesthetics.
==Biography==
Batteux was born in Alland&#x27;Huy-et-Sausseuil, Ardennes, and studied theology at Reims. In 1739 he came to Paris, and after teaching in the colleges of Lisieux and Navarre, was appointed to the chair of Greek and Roman philosophy in the Collège de France. 
His 1746 treatise &quot;Les beaux arts réduits à un même principe&quot; (translated into English as &quot;The Fine Arts Reduced to a Single Principle&quot;, trans. James O. Young, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015) was an attempt to find a unity among existing theories of beauty and taste on &quot;a single principle&quot;, and its views were widely accepted, not only in France but throughout Europe.
According to P. O. Kristeller, 

The reputation thus gained, confirmed by his translation of Horace (1750), led to Batteux&#x27;s becoming a member of the Académie des Inscriptions (1754) and of the Académie française (1761). His &quot;Cours de belles lettres&quot; (1765) was afterwards included with some minor writings in the large treatise, &quot;Principes de la littérature&quot; (1774). His philosophical writings were &quot;La morale d&#x27;Épicure tirée de ses propres écrits&quot; (1758), and the &quot;Histoire des causes premières&quot; (1769). In consequence of the freedom with which in this work he attacked the abuse of authority in philosophy, he lost his professorial chair. 
His last and most extensive work was a &quot;Cours d&#x27;études à l&#x27;usage des élèves de l&#x27;école militaire&quot; in forty-five volumes.

In &quot;Les Beaux Arts&quot;, Batteux developed a theory influenced by John Locke through Voltaire&#x27;s sceptical sensualism. He held that the fine arts are arts (&quot;assemblages of rules for doing well&quot;), for producing fine or beautiful things (&quot;which please&quot; of themselves), always &quot;in imitation of &quot;la belle nature&quot;&quot; and requiring genius. 
Applying this principle to the art of poetry, and analysing, line by line and even word by word, the works of great poets, he deduced the law that the beauty of poetry consists in the accuracy, beauty and harmony of individual expression. 
His &quot;Histoire des causes premières&quot; was among the first attempts at a history of philosophy, and in his work on Epicurus, following on Gassendi, he defended Epicureanism against the general attacks made against it.

For his work &quot;La Morale d&#x27;Épicure&quot; 1758 
see A. Toscano,“La Morale d’Épicure” di Charles Batteux ed il principio del “secondo natura”, in “Scienze e Ricerche” n. 42, 1 dicembre 2016, ISSN: 2283-5873, pp. 20–29.

Strictly in Aesthetics terms Batteux sets the single principle for fine arts in imitation of nature, and this in terms of ideal of perfection to make a harmonious whole: &quot;let&#x27;s choose the most beautiful parts of nature, to make an exquisite whole, more perfect then nature, but never ending to be natural&quot;. In this concept, clearly, Batteux follows a long tradition, present at least in Leon Battista Alberti; as well as for the expression of fine arts, present in Giovanni Battista Armenini and more back in Sebastiano Serlio.

<text>Dimitrie C. Brătianu (1818 – 8 June 1892) was the Prime Minister of Romania and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 10 April 1881 until 8 June 1881. 

Born in Pitești, he was the son of &quot;stolnic&quot; Dincă Brătianu and his wife, Anastasia Brătianu (née Tigveanu), and the older brother of Ion C. Brătianu. For his studies, he went to Paris, where he took the baccalauréat in 1835 and, after one year of medical school, he studied law at the University of Paris, obtaining his law degree in 1841. In April 1848, he returned to his home country and participated in the Wallachian Revolution of 1848. After the revolution was suppressed, Brătianu went into exile, only returning to Wallachia in July 1857.

As mayor of Bucharest, he witnessed a major event in Romania&#x27;s history: the arrival of King Carol I of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, the first king of Romania. Brătianu received Carol I near the Băneasa Forest, where he gave a speech to over 30,000 people. Brătianu was a member of the Macedo-Romanian Cultural Society.

<doc id="508428" wikidata="Q317313" url="?curid=508428" title="Petru Groza">
<text>Petru Groza (7 December 1884 – 7 January 1958) was a Romanian politician, best known as the first Prime Minister of the Communist Party-dominated government under Soviet occupation during the early stages of the Communist regime in Romania, and later as the President of the Presidium of the Great National Assembly (nominal head of state of Romania) from 1952 until his death in 1958.

Groza emerged as a public figure at the end of World War I as a notable member of the Romanian National Party (PNR), preeminent layman of the Romanian Orthodox Church, and then member of the Directory Council of Transylvania. In 1925–26 he served as Minister of State in the cabinet of Marshal Alexandru Averescu. In 1933, Groza founded a left-wing Agrarian organization known as the Ploughmen&#x27;s Front (&quot;Frontul Plugarilor&quot;). The left-wing ideas he supported earned him the nickname &quot;The Red Bourgeois&quot;.

Groza became Premier in 1945 when Nicolae Rădescu, a leading Romanian Army general who assumed power briefly following the conclusion of World War II, was forced to resign by the Soviet Union&#x27;s deputy People&#x27;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Andrei Y. Vishinsky. During Groza&#x27;s tenure, Romania&#x27;s King, Michael I, was forced to abdicate as the nation officially became a &quot;People&#x27;s Republic&quot;. Although his authority and power as Premier was compromised by his reliance upon the Soviet Union for support, Groza presided over the onset of full-fledged Communist rule in Romania before eventually being succeeded by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej in 1952 and became the President of the Presidium of the Great National Assembly until his death in 1958.

==Early life ==
Born as one of the three sons of a wealthy couple in Bácsi (now called Băcia), a village near Déva (today Deva) in Transylvania (part of Austria-Hungary at the time), his father Adam was a priest. Groza was afforded a variety of opportunities in his youth and early career to establish connections and a degree of notoriety, which would later prove essential in his political career. He attended primary school in his native village, then in Kastély (now Coștei) and Lugos (now Lugoj) in the Banat. In 1903, he graduated from the Hungarian Reformed high school (now the Aurel Vlaicu High School) in Szászváros (now Orăștie). That autumn, he began his law and economics training in Hungary, studying at the University of Budapest. In 1905, he took courses at the University of Berlin, heading to Leipzig University in 1906. He obtained a doctorate from the latter institution in 1907.

== Career ==
After completing his studies, Groza returned to Deva to work as a lawyer. During World War I he served as a soldier in the 8th Honvéd Regiment. In 1918, at the war&#x27;s end, he emerged on the political scene as a member of the Romanian National Party (PNR) and obtained a position on the &quot;Directory Council of Transylvania&quot;, convened by ethnic Romanian politicians who had voted in favour of union with Romania; he maintained his office over the course of the following two years.

Throughout this period of his life, Groza established a variety of political connections, working in various Transylvanian political and religious organizations. From 1919 to 1927, for example, Groza obtained a position as a deputy in Synod and Congress of the Romanian Orthodox Church. In the mid-1920s, Groza, who had left the PNR after a conflict with Iuliu Maniu and had joined the People&#x27;s Party, served as the Minister for Transylvania and Minister of Public Works and Communications in the Third Averescu cabinet.

During this period in his life, Groza was able to amass a personal fortune as a wealthy landowner and establish a notable reputation as a prominent layman within the Romanian Orthodox Church, a position which would later make him invaluable to a Romanian Communist Party (PCR) that was campaigning to attract the support of Eastern Orthodox Christians who constituted the nation&#x27;s most numerous religious group in 1945.

== Politics ==

=== Rise to power ===

Despite having briefly retired from public life in 1928 after holding a series of political posts, Groza reemerged on the political scene in 1933, founding a peasant-based political organization, the Ploughmen&#x27;s Front.

Although the movement originally began in order to oppose the increasing burden of debt carried by Romania&#x27;s peasants during the Great Depression in Romania and because the National Peasants&#x27; Party could not help the poorest peasants, by 1944 the organization was essentially under Communist control. The Communist Party wished to seize power but was too weak to seize it alone – post-communist historiography would later claim that in 1944 it had only about a thousand members. Accordingly, the Romanian communist leaders decided to create a broad coalition of political organizations.

This coalition was composed of four major front organizations: the Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union, the Union of Patriots, the Patriotic Defense, and, by far the most widely backed by the Romanian populace, Groza&#x27;s Ploughmen&#x27;s Front. Being a chief political actor in the largest of the Communist front organizations, Groza was able to assert himself in a position of eminence within the Romanian political sphere as the Ploughmen&#x27;s Front joined the Communist Party to create the &quot;National Democratic Front&quot; in October 1944 (it also included the Social Democrats, Mihai Ralea&#x27;s Socialist Peasants&#x27; Party and the Hungarian People&#x27;s Union, as well as other minor groups). He was first considered by the Communist Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu for the post of Premier in October 1944.
Groza&#x27;s prominent status within the National Democratic Front afforded him the opportunity to succeed General Nicolae Rădescu as premier when, in January 1945, top Romanian communist leaders, namely Ana Pauker and Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej rebuked Rădescu with allegedly failing to combat &quot;fascist sympathizers&quot;. With the help of Soviet authorities, the Communists soon mobilized workers to hold a series of demonstrations against Rădescu, and by February many had died because the demonstrations often led to violence. While the communists claimed that the Romanian Army was responsible for the deaths of innocent civilians, Rădescu weakened his own popular support by stating that the communists were &quot;godless foreigners with no homeland&quot;. In response, Andrey Vyshinsky, the Soviet vice commissar of foreign affairs, traveled to Bucharest and allegedly gave King Michael an ultimatum—unless he sacked Rădescu and replaced him with Groza, Romania&#x27;s independence would be at risk. The king had hoped that General Gheorghe Avramescu, who commanded the Romanian 4th Army in the fight to liberate Transylvania and Hungary, would be designated the next prime minister, but, while Michael was waiting on 2 March for Avramescu to return from the front to Bucharest, the NKVD arrested Avramescu in Slovakia, and he died the next day. Faced with mounting Soviet pressure, Michael complied, and Groza became prime minister on 6 March 1945.

=== The Groza cabinets ===
Groza gave key portfolios such as defence, justice, and the interior to the Communists. It nominally included ministers from the National Liberals and National Peasants as well, but the ministers using those labels were fellow travellers like Groza, and had been handpicked by the Communists.

Despite the annoyance of the two powers, the Communists constituted only a minority in Groza&#x27;s cabinet. The leading figures in the Romanian Communist Party, Pauker and Gheorghiu-Dej, wanted the Groza government to preserve the façade of a coalition government and thus enable the Communists to win the confidence of the masses, since right after the Second World War the communists enjoyed very little political support. For this reason top communist figures like Pauker and Gheorghiu-Dej did not join Groza&#x27;s cabinet. They planned to gradually impose an out-and-out Communist regime under the veil of the existing coalition government. By conflating the successes of the regime with their Party, Pauker and Gheorghiu-Dej hoped to win support for the party and lay the foundations for a one-party state. Accordingly, Groza maintained the illusion of a coalition government, appointing members of diverse political organizations to his cabinet and formulating his government&#x27;s short-term goals in broad, non-ideological terms. He stated at a cabinet meeting on 7 March 1945, for example, that the government sought to guarantee safety and order for the population, implement desired land reform policies, and focus on a &quot;swift cleanup&quot; of the state bureaucracy and immediate prosecution of war criminals, i.e., officials of the Fascist wartime regime of Marshal Ion Antonescu (&quot;see Romania during World War II and Romanian People&#x27;s Tribunals&quot;).

To confirm Groza in office, elections were held on 19 November 1946. The count was rigged in order to give an overwhelming majority to the Bloc of Democratic Parties, a Communist-dominated front that included the Ploughmen&#x27;s Front. Years later, historian reviewed a confidential Communist Party report about the election that showed the BPD had, at most, won 47 percent of the vote. He concluded that had the election been conducted honestly, the opposition parties would have won enough votes between them to form a coalition government—albeit with far less than the 80 percent support long claimed by opposition supporters.

In the mind of the Groza government, the 1946 election confirmed it in office. This claim was made in the face of protests by the United States and the United Kingdom who held that, pursuant to the agreements reached at the Yalta Conference in 1945, only &quot;interim governmental authorities broadly representative of the population&quot;, should be supported by the major powers. As a result, Groza&#x27;s government was permanently estranged from the United States and the United Kingdom, who nominally supported the waning influence of the monarchist forces under King Michael I.

=== As Prime Minister ===

Within days of becoming premier, Groza delivered his first major success. On 10 March 1945, the Soviet Union agreed to return to Romania Northern Transylvania, a territory of over that had been assigned to Hungary through the 1940 Second Vienna Award sponsored by Germany and Italy. Groza promised that the rights of each ethnic group within the restored territory would be protected (mainly, as a reference to the Hungarian minority in Romania), while Joseph Stalin declared that the previous government under Rădescu had permitted such a large degree of sabotage and terrorism in the region that it would have been impossible to deliver the territory to the Romanians. As a result, only after Groza&#x27;s guarantee of ethnic minority rights did the Soviet government decide to &quot;satisfy the petition of the Romanian government&quot;. The recovery of this territory, nearly fifty-eight percent Romanian in 1945, was hailed as a major accomplishment within the formative stages of the Groza regime.

Groza continued to improve the image of his own government while strengthening the position of the Communist Party with a series of political reforms. He proceeded to eliminate any antagonistic elements in the government administration and, in the newly acquired Transylvanian territory, removed three city prefects, including that of the region&#x27;s capital, Cluj. The prefects removed were immediately replaced by loyal government officials directly appointed by Groza, so as to strengthen loyalist elements in local government in the region. Groza also promised a series of land reform programs to benefit military personnel, which would confiscate and subsequently redistribute all properties in excess of in addition to all the property of traitors, absentees, and all who collaborated with the wartime Romanian government, the Hungarian occupiers during Miklós Horthy and Ferenc Szálasi&#x27;s régimes, and Nazi Germany.

Despite giving the appearance of liberal democracy by granting women&#x27;s suffrage, Groza pursued a series of reforms attempting to clamp down on the prominence of politically dissident media outlets in the nation. During the first month of his premiership, Groza acted to close down &quot;Romania Nouă&quot;, a popular newspaper published by sources close to Iuliu Maniu, leader of the traditional National Peasants&#x27; Party who disagreed widely with Groza&#x27;s attempted reforms. Within a month of his assumption of the premiership, Groza shut down over nine provincial newspapers and a series of periodicals which, Groza declared, were products of those, &quot;who served Fascism and Hitlerism&quot;. Groza soon continued this repression by limiting the number of political parties allowed within the state. Although Groza had promised to purge only individuals from the government bureaucracy and diplomatic corps immediately after assuming power, in June 1947 he began to prosecute entire political organizations, as, after the Tămădău Affair, he arrested key members of the National Peasants&#x27; Party and sentenced Maniu to life in prison &quot;for political crimes against the Romanian people&quot;. By August of that year, both the National Peasants&#x27; Party and the National Liberal Party had been dissolved and in 1948, the government coalition incorporated the Romanian Workers&#x27; Party (the forced union of communists and Romanian Social Democrats) and the Hungarian People&#x27;s Union, effectively minimizing all political opposition within the state.

=== Royal strike and political crisis ===
On August 18, Roy Melbourne presented to Foreign Minister Gheorghe Tătărescu a verbal note showing that the American government &quot;wants the establishment of a representative regime made up of all democratic groups in this country&quot;. Consequently, the United States will only sign a final peace treaty with a fully recognized democratic government. Both Groza and Tătărescu rejected the note, declaring it null and void. They argued that the US could not address a government it did not recognize. British diplomats also sent such a note, but the government had the same attitude.

Faced with Groza&#x27;s refusal to resign, King Michael instituted, on August 21, the royal strike and no longer agreed to countersign the government&#x27;s documents. At the December 1945 Conference, it was decided that the situation should be resolved by appointing one PNL and PNȚ member each to the government, after which free elections would be organized and freedom of &quot;press, speech, religion and association&quot; would be ensured. Maniu warned that without the neutrality of the Ministries of Interior and Justice, free elections could not take place in Romania, but the decision had to be followed. On January 7, 1946, Emil Hațieganu, from PNȚ, and , from PNL took the oath as ministers. Basically, the decisions in Moscow represented the victory of the Soviet point of view, the government of Petru Groza being recognized by the USA and Great Britain on February 5, 1946.

During his term as premier, Groza also clashed with the nation&#x27;s remaining monarchist forces under King Michael I. Although his powers were minimal within Groza&#x27;s regime, King Michael symbolized the remnants of the traditional Romanian monarchy and, in late 1945, the King urged Groza to resign. The King maintained that Romania must abide by the Yalta accords, allowing the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union to each have a hand in post-war government reconstruction and the incorporation of a broader coalition force he had already organized. Groza flatly rejected the request, and relations between the two figures remained tense over the next few years, with Groza and the King differing on the prosecution of war criminals and in the awarding of honorary Romanian citizenship to Stalin in August 1947.

Early on the morning of 30 December 1947, Groza summoned Michael back to Bucharest, ostensibly &quot;to discuss important matters&quot;; the king had been preparing for a New Year&#x27;s party at Peleș Castle in Sinaia. When Michael arrived, Groza presented the king with a pretyped instrument of abdication and demanded that Michael sign it. According to Michael&#x27;s account, when he refused, Groza threatened to launch a bloodbath and arrest thousands of people. Michael eventually signed the document, and a few hours later parliament abolished the monarchy and declared Romania a republic.

=== The elections of November 1946 ===
After the failure of the royal strike, Mihai adopted a more cautious position with the government. In view of the elections, the governmental political forces constituted, on May 17, 1946, the Bloc of Democratic Parties to submit joint lists for the elections. BPD consisted of PCR, PSD, PNL-Tătărescu, PNȚ-Alexandrescu, FP, and PNP. Instead, the democratic parties, PNȚ, PNL, and PSDI, failed in their attempt to create a common opposition front. The government also amended the electoral law, so that for the first time in history, women could also participate in the electoral process. The election campaign was carried out by numerous and serious abuses by government forces and exacerbated opposition attacks against them. Although Washington and London repeatedly gave Maniu guarantees that the elections to be held would be free and supervised by the Western powers, the government did not hesitate to use Stalin&#x27;s dictum in the electoral process: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter who votes &quot;with whom, it matters who count the votes&quot;&quot;. The elections took place on November 19, 1946, with a massive turnout. The official published results were: BPD – 69.81%, PNȚ – 12.88%, UPM – 8.32%, PNL – 3.78%, PȚD – 2.36%.

Immediately, the opposition accused the government of fraud, with Maniu claiming that the results had been reversed, so that in fact the PNȚ had won. Instead, the governing parties claimed that the election results reflected the citizens&#x27; adherence to the BND program, and the minor incidents that occurred were provoked by the opposition. In fact, it was the same Romanian electoral tradition that the government declared that the elections were fair, while the opposition accused them of fraud.

The same divergence existed between Moscow and the British and American officials. Reports arrived in Washington from the diplomatic mission of the Western powers and from the Ministry of the Interior in Bucharest, which had the same divergent content. The US and Great Britain limited themselves to some formal declarations, the agreement on the division of spheres of influence having been taken a long time ago. The memoirs prepared by Maniu and Brătianu were not taken into account, and on December 1, 1946, King Michael delivered the Opening Message of the Assembly of Deputies: &quot;I am happy to be among the representatives of the country, gathered today for the first time, after a long interruption of parliamentary life.&quot;

On February 10, 1947, Romania signed the Peace Treaty with the Allied and Associated Powers, so the regime of the Armistice Convention officially ended. This fact meant that the UK and the United States no longer had any leverage to intervene in favor of the opposition, Romania passing under the exclusive control of the USSR.

=== Removal of opposition ===
After the parliamentary elections, the essential political objective of the Groza government was to seize all power in the state and liquidate any forms of opposition. The plan was drawn up by the Minister of the Interior, Teohari Georgescu, and Panteley Bodnarenko, a Soviet intelligence officer. Since the beginning of 1947, the communist authorities have carried out numerous arrests against political opponents by committing serious abuses. On July 14, 1947, the Home Office authorities managed to set a trap for the main peasant-national leaders, who were preparing to leave for Great Britain to inform Western diplomats about the real situation in the country. The Tămădău affair was labeled as an act of national treason and turned into a major political case.

In order to allow the involvement of PNȚ and Iuliu Maniu, the authorities extended the charges from fraudulent attempt to leave the country to activities of a political nature. On July 30, 1947, through a journal of the Council of Ministers, it was decided to dissolve the National Peasant Party. On the same day, the Assembly of Deputies was convened, during which, based on a report drawn up by Teohari Georgescu, the dissolution was approved with 294 votes for and one against. The diary stated: &quot;The National-Peasant Party under the presidency of Mr. Iuliu Maniu is and remains dissolved on the date of publication in the Official Monitor of this Journal. The same dissolution decision also includes all county, network and communal organizations of the aforementioned party, military, youth, women&#x27;s organizations and any other organizations or associations led by this party&quot;.

On November 1, the National Liberal Party decided to cease its activity. Five days later, the Assembly of Deputies adopted a motion of no confidence in Gheorghe Tătărescu, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the vice-president of the Council of Ministers. The following day, PNL-Tătărescu representatives resigned from the government. The trial of the PNȚ leaders took place between October 29 and November 4.

The sentence was established in advance, based on accusations without material cover, based not on evidence, but on political indications coming from Moscow and presented in legal form in Bucharest. Iuliu Maniu and Ion Mihalache were the only ones sentenced to hard prison for life.

=== Proclamation of the Republic ===
On November 12, King Michael and Queen Mother Elena went to London to witness the marriage of Princess Elizabeth, the heir to the British Crown. Here, he met Princess Ana de Bourbon-Parma. The two went to Lausanne, Switzerland, where they unofficially got engaged on December 6, 1947. Asking for the approval of the Romanian government, the answer that came 10 days later states that the marriage was not opportune at that time.

The international press was already starting to speculate that the Romanian sovereign would stay abroad for a woman, abandoning his constitutional prerogatives. To refute the speculations, on December 18, Michael boarded the train in Lausanne and arrived in Bucharest three days later. After a meeting with Petru Groza, where no conclusion was reached, Michael and his mother went to Sinaia for the winter holidays. On Christmas Eve, Emil Bodnăraș (who, according to some information, had just arrived from Moscow, where he had received from Stalin the instructions regarding the organization of the abdication of King Michael), was inaugurated as Minister of National Defense.

At around 20:30 on the evening of December 29, King Michael was informed about Groza&#x27;s formal request to grant him an audience the next day, at 10:00. Initially, he assumed it was about his marriage. In the morning of December 30, 1947, the king, together with the queen-mother and some people from the Court moved to Bucharest, and around 12:00 they arrived at the palace on Kiseleff road. In 15 minutes Petru Groza also arrived, who was accompanied by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. Groza was the first to address, &quot;Well, Your Majesty, the time has come to arrange an amicable parting.&quot; Surprised, Michael asked what he meant by these words. &quot;The problem of ending the monarchy. After all, I warned you that you need to prepare for something like this. You must understand that there is no place for a king in Romania anymore,&quot; Groza declared. The king retorted, &quot;It is not you who can tell me to go. This matter must be decided by the people&quot;.

Groza states that the government will arrange the material problems so that the royal family can lead a comfortable life. Also, Gheorghiu-Dej alluded to a possible lawsuit that could be filed &quot;His Majesty&quot;. At that moment, Michael declared that &quot;your proposal raises serious constitutional issues&quot;. &quot;We&#x27;ve thought of everything,&quot; Groza replied, pulling out a sheet of white parchment paper from the folder he&#x27;d been holding since the audience began. &quot;I will study this paper,&quot; declares the king, hoping to buy more time. Precise horror: &quot;You must read now. We are not leaving this house until the paper is signed, even if we have to stay here until tonight. Our people are waiting for the news of the abdication. If we don&#x27;t have your signature, there will be trouble.&quot;

At that point, the king went into the next room, where the Palace Marshal informed him that the guard had been changed, the palace was surrounded by troops, and telephone communications were down. When he returned to the room, Michael asked why all these measures were taken. &quot;The people are impatient Sire, we have been here for quite a long time,&quot; answered Groza. &quot;What if I refuse to sign&quot;?, asked the king. Groza resorted to a last threat: &quot;You saw, everything was foreseen. A civil war may break out. We cannot be responsible for anyone&#x27;s security. And you will bear the responsibility&quot;.

In a report from December 1990, Michael claimed that Groza and Gheorghiu-Dej resorted to blackmail: &quot;They told me that the members of the government, that is, the communists, would have to, in order to counteract any form of opposition, execute over a thousand of students among those who had been arrested in the last year&quot;. He also stated that Groza &quot;came up to me and asked me to feel his waistcoat near the pocket. He said to me: Touch! And he had the gun in his pocket, giving the explanation: So that what happened to Antonescu doesn&#x27;t happen to me.&quot; After this, Michael sits down at the table and signs the abdication document.

At 15:30 the Council of Ministers met. Petru Groza announced the act of abdication and a government proclamation was issued to the country. This informed the king&#x27;s abdication and appreciated that &quot;Thus, the Romanian people acquired the freedom to build a new form of state — the People&#x27;s Republic&quot;. At 19:10, under the presidency of Mihail Sadoveanu, the extraordinary meeting of the Assembly of Deputies opened.

Two bills were unanimously approved. The first took note of the abdication of King Michael I, for himself and his descendants, the Constitution of Romania was abrogated, and the new official name of the state became the Romanian People&#x27;s Republic. It was also specified that the legislative power will be exercised by the Assembly of Deputies until its dissolution and the meeting of a Constituent National Assembly, which will be held at a date fixed by the Assembly of Deputies. It will adopt the new Constitution of the RPR. Through the second project, the members of the Provisional Presidium of the RPR were appointed: Constantin Ion Parhon, president, Mihail Sadoveanu, Ștefan Voitec, , and Ion Niculi, vice presidents. The meeting ended after only one hour.

=== President of the MAN presidium ===
On February 24, 1948, the Assembly of Deputies was dissolved. Three days later, the People&#x27;s Democracy Front was established, an electoral alliance formed by the Romanian Workers&#x27; Party (the new name adopted by the communists following the merger with the PSD), the Plowmen&#x27;s Front, PNL-Bejan, and the Hungarian People&#x27;s Union. On March 28, the elections were held for the Great National Assembly, the unicameral legislative forum of the RPR. The first objective of the Great Assembly was to draft a new fundamental law. The Constitution of the Romanian People&#x27;s Republic was promulgated on April 13, 1948.

Groza kept his mandate as prime minister until June 2, 1952. Ten days later he replaced Constantin Ion Parhon as president of the presidium of the Great National Assembly, the institution that symbolically ensured the leadership of the RPR. He remained in this position until the end of his life.

Starting from 1948, the communist authorities began to impose the Stalinist model of organization and management of society. On June 11, 1948, the Groza government passed the law for the nationalization of industry. This measure aimed at the destruction of private property and generalized public ownership in industry, banking, and transport. The State Planning Committee was created, which ensured economic development on a planned basis, based on economic centralism. Starting from 1951, the economic organization plan was for five years (the five-year plans).

Also following the Soviet model, the Collective Agricultural Farms and the State Agricultural Farms were established, which indicated the types of crops and fixed the prices of agricultural goods. Peasants were allowed to keep small plots of land, but which did not exceed . On the international level, Romania was a founding member of Comecon (1949) and of the Warsaw Pact (1955).

Old and sick, Groza was forced to accept, on February 7, 1953, the dissolution of the Plowers&#x27; Front, a competitor and thorn in the side of the communists. However, he did not join the PMR, thus achieving the political feat of placing himself in leading positions within the regime without ever having been a party member. One explanation may be the ability with which he managed to attract the support and trust of Stalin, recalled in one of his political notes:I approached him. He was sitting on a kind of shack, slightly higher than the floor. I threw myself on my knees, kissed his feet, and said to him: At last I have attained my ideal of a little child. This day will be the most beautiful day of my life. Stalin, obviously impressed, took me by the arm, lifted me up, hugged me. My circus made a special impression on him and I won him over. I was an unparalleled theatrical artist!

==Death==
Groza stepped down as premier in 1952, and was succeeded by Gheorghiu-Dej. He was then named president of the Presidium of the Great National Assembly (&quot;de jure&quot; head of state of Romania), a post he held until 1958, when he died from complications following a stomach operation. He was buried at Ghencea Cemetery; his remains were later moved to the Carol Park Mausoleum, and finally to the cemetery in his native village, Băcia.

His daughter Maria Groza, who had served as his personal secretary, was later active in her own right as a diplomat and politician.

==Legacy==

The mining town of Ștei in Bihor County was named &quot;Dr. Petru Groza&quot; after him, a name it kept until after the Romanian Revolution of December 1989. After his death in 1958, &quot;Transylvania Boulevard&quot; in Bucharest was renamed &quot;Dr. Petru Groza Boulevard&quot;; it is now named after Gheorghe Marinescu. There are streets named after Groza in Cluj-Napoca, Galați, and Medgidia.

A bronze statue of Groza, placed on a red Carrara marble pedestal, was unveiled in Deva in 1962. The monument, designed by sculptor , was removed in 1990, and replaced in 1999 by a statue of Trajan; in 2007, Groza&#x27;s statue was transported to Băcia. Another statue of him, sculpted by , was inaugurated in the Cotroceni neighborhood of Bucharest in 1971; this statue was taken down in 1990, and replaced in 1993 by a monument to the Artillery Heroes. As of 2010, it lies in an open field near Mogoșoaia Palace, next to a statue of Vladimir Lenin that used to be in front of Casa Scînteii.

In 1995 she portrayed Former First Lady Pat Nixon acting opposite Anthony Hopkins playing the title role in the Oliver Stone biographical drama &quot;Nixon&quot; (1995). Critic Roger Ebert praised Allen&#x27;s performance writing, &quot;The key supporting performance in the movie is by Joan Allen as Pat Nixon.

That same year Allen acted teen romantic drama &quot;Mad Love&quot; (1995).

The following year Allen played Elizabeth Proctor, a woman accused of witchcraft, in &quot;The Crucible&quot; (1996).

The following year she starred in the drama &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; directed by Ang Lee, playing an unsatisfied woman who discovers her husband is having an affair with a neighbor. Allen acted opposite Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Elijah Wood, Christina Ricci, and Tobey Maguire. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; named it her best film performance writing, &quot;Allen is exquisitely contained, embodying the awkward grace and indefinable ache.&quot; She also had a supporting role in the science fiction action film &quot;Face/Off&quot; (1997).

In 1998 Allen starred in the Gary Ross-directed fantasy comedy-drama &quot;Pleasantville&quot; (1998). Allen acted alongside Jeff Daniels, Reese Witherspoon, and Tobey Maguire.

In 2005, she received many positive notices for her leading role in the comedy/drama &quot;The Upside of Anger&quot;, in which she played an alcoholic housewife. Kirk Honeycutt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; writing, &quot;Allen turns the character into a tour de force that unleashes an unexpected comedy about compassion and self-loathing.&quot; She received a Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actress nomination for her performance. She played CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy in &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;, &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; and &quot;The Bourne Legacy&quot;.

The play was met with mixed reviews from critics. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote the play &quot;is as awkward as it is sublime&quot;, noting its &quot;brazen sweetness&quot; and &quot;openhearted humor&quot;. Allen voiced the character Delphine in Bethesda Softworks&#x27; 2011 video game &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot;.

<doc id="508455" wikidata="Q1988216" url="?curid=508455" title="Oxygen therapy">
<text>Oxygen therapy, also referred to as supplemental oxygen, is the use of oxygen as medical treatment. Supplemental oxygen can also refer to the use of oxygen enriched air at altitude. Acute indications for therapy include hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels), carbon monoxide toxicity and cluster headache. It may also be prophylactically given to maintain blood oxygen levels during the induction of anesthesia. Oxygen therapy is often useful in chronic hypoxemia caused by conditions such as severe COPD or cystic fibrosis. Oxygen can be delivered via nasal cannula, face mask, or endotracheal intubation at normal atmospheric pressure, or in a hyperbaric chamber. It can also be given through bypassing the airway, such as in ECMO therapy.
Oxygen is required for normal cellular metabolism. However, excessively high concentrations can result in oxygen toxicity, leading to lung damage and respiratory failure. Higher oxygen concentrations can also increase the risk of airway fires, particularly while smoking. Oxygen therapy can also dry out the nasal mucosa without humidification. In most conditions, an oxygen saturation of 94–96% is adequate, while in those at risk of carbon dioxide retention, saturations of 88–92% are preferred. In cases of carbon monoxide toxicity or cardiac arrest, saturations should be as high as possible. While air is typically 21% oxygen by volume, oxygen therapy can increase O2 content of air up to 100%.
The medical use of oxygen first became common around 1917, and is the most common hospital treatment in the developed world. It is currently on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Home oxygen can be provided either by oxygen tanks or oxygen concentrator.

==Medical uses==

Oxygen is widely used by hospitals, EMS, and first-aid providers in a variety of conditions and settings. A few indications frequently requiring high-flow oxygen include resuscitation, major trauma, anaphylaxis, major bleeding, shock, active convulsions, and hypothermia.

=== Acute conditions ===
In context of acute hypoxemia, oxygen therapy should be titrated to a target level based on pulse oximetry (94–96% in most patients, or 88–92% in people with COPD). This can be performed by increasing oxygen delivery, described as FIO2(fraction of inspired oxygen). In 2018, the British Medical Journal recommended that oxygen therapy be stopped for saturations greater than 96% and not started for saturations above 90 to 93%. This may be due to an association between excessive oxygenation in the acutely ill and increased mortality. Exceptions to these recommendations include carbon monoxide poisoning, cluster headaches, sickle cell crisis, and pneumothorax.

Oxygen therapy has also been used as emergency treatment for decompression sickness for years. Recompression in a hyperbaric chamber with 100% oxygen is the standard treatment for decompression illness. The success of recompression therapy is greatest if given within four hours after resurfacing, with earlier treatment associated with a decreased number of recompression treatments required for resolution. It has been suggested in literature that heliox may be a better alternative to oxygen therapy.

In the context of stroke, oxygen therapy may be beneficial as long as hyperoxic environments are avoided.

People receiving outpatient oxygen therapy for hypoxemia following acute illness or hospitalization should be re-assessed by a physician prior to prescription renewal to gauge the necessity of ongoing oxygen therapy. If the initial hypoxemia has resolved, additional treatment may be an unnecessary use of resources.

=== Chronic conditions ===
Common conditions which may require a baseline of supplementary oxygen include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. Patients may also require additional oxygen during acute exacerbations. Oxygen may also be prescribed for breathlessness, end-stage cardiac failure, respiratory failure, advanced cancer, or neurodegenerative disease in spite of relatively normal blood oxygen levels. Physiologically, it may be indicated in people with arterial oxygen partial pressure Pa ≤ 55mmHg (7.3kPa) or arterial oxygen saturation Sa ≤ 88%.

Careful titration of oxygen therapy should be considered in patients with chronic conditions predisposing them to carbon dioxide retention (e.g., COPD, emphysema). In these instances, oxygen therapy may decrease respiratory drive, leading to accumulation of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia), acidemia, and increased mortality secondary to respiratory failure. Improved outcomes have been observed with titrated oxygen treatment largely due to gradual improvement of the ventilation/perfusion ratio. The risks associated with loss of respiratory drive are far outweighed by the risks of withholding emergency oxygen, so emergency administration of oxygen is never contraindicated. Transfer from the field to definitive care with titrated oxygen typically occurs long before significant reductions to the respiratory drive are observed.

=== Contraindications ===
There are certain situations in which oxygen therapy has been shown to negatively impact a person&#x27;s condition.
* Oxygen therapy can exacerbate the effects of paraquat poisoning and should be withheld unless severe respiratory distress or respiratory arrest is present. Paraquat poisoning is rare, with about 200 deaths globally from 1958 to 1978.
* Oxygen therapy is not recommended for people with pulmonary fibrosis or bleomycin-associated lung damage.
* ARDS caused by acid aspiration may be exacerbated with oxygen therapy according to some animal studies.
* Hyperoxic environments should be avoided in cases of sepsis.
=== Adverse effects ===
In some instances, oxygen delivery can lead to particular complications in population subsets.
* In infants with respiratory failure, administration of high levels of oxygen can sometimes promote overgrowth of new blood vessels in the eye leading to blindness. This phenomenon is known as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).
* In rare instances, people receiving hyperbaric oxygen therapy have had seizures, which has been previously attributed to oxygen toxicity.
* There is some evidence that extended HBOT can accelerate development of cataracts.

===Alternative medicine===

Some practitioners of alternative medicine have promoted &quot;oxygen therapy&quot; as a cure for many human ailments including AIDS, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, &quot;available scientific evidence does not support claims that putting oxygen-releasing chemicals into a person&#x27;s body is effective in treating cancer&quot;, and some of these treatments can be dangerous.

== Physiologic effects ==
Oxygen supplementation has a variety of physiologic effects on the human body. Whether or not these effects are adverse to a patient is dependent upon clinical context. Cases in which an excess amount of oxygen is available to organs is known as hyperoxia. While the following effects may observed with noninvasive high-dose oxygen therapy (i.e., not ECMO), delivery of oxygen at higher pressures is associated with exacerbation of the following associated effects.

=== Absorption atelectasis ===
It has been hypothesized that oxygen therapy may promote accelerated development of atelectasis (partial or complete lung collapse), as well as denitrogenation of gas cavities (e.g., pneumothorax, pneumocephalus). This concept is based on the idea that oxygen is more quickly absorbed compared to nitrogen within the body, leading oxygen-rich areas that are poorly ventilated to be rapidly absorbed, leading to atelectasis. It is thought that higher fractions of inhaled oxygen (&quot;FI&quot;O2) are associated with increasing rates of atelectasis in the clinical scenario. In clinically healthy adults, it is believed that absorption atelectasis typically does not have any significant implications when managed properly.

=== Airway inflammation ===
In regard to the airway, both tracheobronchitis and mucositis have been observed with high levels of oxygen delivery (typically &gt;40% O2). Within the lungs, these elevated concentrations of oxygen have been associated with increased alveolar toxicity (coined the Lorrain-Smith effect). Mucosal damage is observed to increase with elevated atmospheric pressure and oxygen concentrations, which may result in the development of ARDS and possibly death.

=== Central nervous system effects ===
Decreased cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure (ICP) have been reported in hyperoxic conditions, with mixed results regarding impact on cognition. Hyperoxia as also been associated with seizures, cataract formation, and reversible myopia.

=== Hypercapnea ===
Among retainers, excess exposure to oxygen in context of the Haldane effect causes decreased binding of deoxyhemoglobin to in the blood. This unloading of may contribute to the development of acid-base disorders due to the associated increase in PaCO2 (hypercapnea). Patients with underlying lung disease such as COPD may not be able to adequately clear the additional produced by this effect, worsening their condition. In addition, oxygen therapy has also been shown to decrease respiratory drive, further contributing to possible hypercapnea.

=== Immunological effects ===
Hyperoxic environments have been observed to decrease granulocyte rolling and diapedesis in specific circumstances in humans. In regard to anaerobic infections, cases of necrotizing fasciitis have been observed to require fewer debridement operations and have improvement in regard to mortality in patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This may stem from oxygen intolerance of otherwise anaerobic microorganisms.

=== Oxidative stress ===
Sustained exposure to oxygen may overwhelm the body&#x27;s capacity to deal with oxidative stress.  Rates of oxidative stress appears to be influenced by both oxygen concentration and length of exposure, with general toxicity observed to occur within hours in certain hyperoxic conditions.

=== Reduction in erythropoiesis ===
Hyperoxia is observed to result in a serum reduction in erythropoietin, resulting in reduced stimulus for erythropoiesis. Hyperoxia at normobaric environments does not appear to be able to halt erythropoiesis completely.

=== Pulmonary vasodilation ===
Within the lungs, hypoxia is observed to be a potent pulmonary vasoconstrictor, due to inhibition of an outward potassium current and activation of inward sodium current leading to pulmonary vascular muscular contraction. However, the effects of hyperoxia do not seem to have a particularly strong vasodilatory effect from the few studies that have been performed on patients with pulmonary hypertension. As a result, an effect appears to be present but minor.

=== Systemic vasoconstriction ===
In the systemic vasculature, oxygen serves as a vasoconstrictor, leading to mildly increased blood pressure and decreased cardiac output and heart rate. Hyperbaric conditions do not seem to have a significant impact on these overall physiologic effects. Clinically, this may lead to increased left-to-right shunting in certain patient populations, such as those with atrial septal defect. While the mechanism of the vasoconstriction is unknown, one proposed theory is that increased reactive oxygen species from oxygen therapy accelerates the degradation of endothelial nitric oxide, a vasodilator. These vasoconstrictive effects are thought to be the underlying mechanism helping to abort cluster headaches.

Dissolved oxygen in hyperoxic conditions may make also a significant contribution to total gas transport.
==Storage and sources==

Oxygen can be separated by a number of methods (e.g., chemical reaction, fractional distillation) to enable immediate or future use. The main methods utilized for oxygen therapy include:
# Liquid storage – Liquid oxygen is stored in insulated tanks at low temperature and allowed to boil (at a temperature of 90.188 K (−182.96 °C)) during use, releasing gaseous oxygen. This method is widely utilized at hospitals due to high oxygen requirements. See Vacuum Insulated Evaporator for more information on this method of storage.
# Compressed gas storage – Oxygen gas is compressed in a gas cylinder, which provides a convenient storage method (refrigeration not required). Large oxygen cylinders hold a volume of and can last about two days at a flow rate of 2 litres per minute (LPM). A small portable M6 (B) cylinder holds and weighs about . These tanks can last 4–6 hours with a conserving regulator, which adjust flow based on a person&#x27;s breathing rate. Conserving regulators may not be effective for patients who breathe through their mouth.
# Instant usage – The use of an electrically powered oxygen concentrator or a chemical reaction based unit can create sufficient oxygen for immediate personal use. These units (especially the electrically powered versions) are widely used for home oxygen therapy as portable personal oxygen. One particular advantage includes continuous supply without need for bulky oxygen cylinders.

===Hazards and risk===
Highly concentrated sources of oxygen also increase risk for rapid combustion. Oxygen itself is not flammable, but the addition of concentrated oxygen to a fire greatly increases its intensity, and can aid the combustion of materials that are relatively inert under normal conditions. Fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought together in close proximity, although an ignition event (e.g., heat or spark) is needed to trigger combustion.

Concentrated oxygen will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically. Steel pipes and storage vessels used to store and transmit both gaseous and liquid oxygen will act as a fuel; and therefore the design and manufacture of oxygen systems requires special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized. Highly concentrated oxygen in a high-pressure environment can spontaneously ignite hydrocarbons such as oil and grease, resulting in a fire or explosion. The heat caused by rapid pressurization serves as the ignition source. For this reason, storage vessels, regulators, piping and any other equipment used with highly concentrated oxygen must be &quot;oxygen-clean&quot; prior to use to ensure the absence of potential fuels. This does not only apply to pure oxygen; any concentration significantly higher than atmospheric (approximately 21%) carries a potential ignition risk.

Some hospitals have instituted &quot;no-smoking&quot; policies which can help keep ignition sources away from medically piped oxygen. These policies do not eliminate the risk of injury among patients with portable oxygen systems, especially among smokers. Other potential sources of ignition include candles, aromatherapy, medical equipment, cooking, and deliberate vandalism.

==Delivery==
Various devices are used for oxygen administration. In most cases, the oxygen will first pass through a pressure regulator, used to control the high pressure of oxygen delivered from a cylinder (or other source) to a lower pressure. This lower pressure is then controlled by a flowmeter (which may be preset or selectable) which controls the flow at a measured rate (e.g., litres per minute [LPM]). The typical flowmeter range for medical oxygen is between 0 and 15 LPM with some units capable of obtaining up to 25 LPM. Many wall flowmeters using a Thorpe tube design are able to be dialed to &quot;flush&quot; oxygen which is beneficial in emergency situations.

===Low-dose oxygen===
Many people only require slight increases in inhaled oxygen, rather than pure or near-pure oxygen. These requirements can be met through a number of devices dependent on situation, flow requirements, and personal preference.

A nasal cannula (NC) is a thin tube with two small nozzles inserted into a person&#x27;s nostrils. It can provide oxygen at low flow rates, 1–6 litres per minute (LPM), delivering an oxygen concentration of 24–40%.

There are also a number of face mask options, such as the simple face mask, often used at between 5 and 10 LPM, capable of delivering oxygen concentrations between 35% and 55%. This is closely related to the more controlled air-entrainment masks, also known as Venturi masks, which can accurately deliver a predetermined oxygen concentration from 24 to 50%.

In some instances, a partial rebreathing mask can be used, which is based on a simple mask, but features a reservoir bag, which can provide oxygen concentrations of 40–70% at 5–15 LPM.

Demand oxygen delivery systems (DODS) or oxygen resuscitators deliver oxygen only when the person inhales or the caregiver presses a button on the mask (e.g., nonbreathing patient). These systems greatly conserve oxygen compared to steady-flow masks, and are useful in emergency situations when a limited supply of oxygen is available and there is a delay in transporting the person to higher care. Due to utilization of a variety of methods for oxygenation requirements performance differences arise. They are very useful in CPR, as the caregiver can deliver rescue breaths composed of 100% oxygen with the press of a button. Care must be taken not to over-inflate the person&#x27;s lungs, for which some systems employ safety valves. These systems may not be appropriate for people who are unconscious or in respiratory distress because of the required respiratory effort.

===High flow oxygen delivery===

For patients requiring high concentrations of oxygen, a number of devices are available. The most commonly utilized device is the non-rebreather mask (or reservoir mask). Non-rebreather masks draw oxygen from attached reservoir bags with one-way valves that direct exhaled air out of the mask. If flow rate is not sufficient (~10L/min), the bag may collapse on inspiration. This type of mask is indicated for acute medical emergencies. The delivered FIO2 (Inhalation volumetric fraction of molecular oxygen) of this system is 60–80%, depending on oxygen flow and breathing pattern.

Another type of device is a humidified high flow nasal cannula which enables flows exceeding a person&#x27;s peak inspiratory flow demand to be delivered via nasal cannula, thus providing FIO2 of up to 100% because there is no entrainment of room air. This also allows the person to continue to talk, eat, and drink while still receiving therapy. This type of delivery method is associated with greater overall comfort, improved oxygenation, respiratory rates and reduced sputumstatis compared with face mask oxygen.

In specialist applications such as aviation, tight-fitting masks can be used. These masks also have applications in anaesthesia, carbon monoxide poisoning treatment and in hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

===Positive pressure delivery===
Patients who are unable to breathe on their own will require positive pressure to move oxygen into their lungs for gaseous exchange to take place. Systems for delivery vary in complexity and cost, starting with a basic pocket mask adjunct which can be used to manually deliver artificial respiration with supplemental oxygen delivered through a mask port.

Many emergency medical service members, first aid personnel, and hospital staff may use a bag-valve-mask (BVM), which is a malleable bag attached to a face mask (or invasive airway such as an endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway), usually with a reservoir bag attached, which is manually manipulated by the healthcare professional to push oxygen (or air) into the lungs. This is the only procedure allowed for initial treatment of cyanide poisoning in the UK workplace.Automated versions of the BVM system, known as a resuscitator or pneupac can also deliver measured and timed doses of oxygen directly to people through a facemask or airway. These systems are related to the anaesthetic machines used in operations under general anaesthesia that allow a variable amount of oxygen to be delivered, along with other gases including air, nitrous oxide and inhalational anaesthetics.

===Drug delivery===
Oxygen and other compressed gases are used in conjunction with a nebulizer to allow delivery of medications to the upper and/or lower airways. Nebulizers use compressed gas to propel liquid medication into therapeutically sized aerosol droplets for deposition to the appropriate portion of the airway. A typical compressed gas flow rate of 8–10 L/min is used to nebulize medications, saline, sterile water, or a combination these treatments into a therapeutic aerosol for inhalation. In the clinical setting, room air (ambient mix of several gasses), molecular oxygen, and Heliox are the most common gases used to nebulize a bolus treatment or a continuous volume of therapeutic aerosols.

===Exhalation filters for oxygen masks===
Filtered oxygen masks have the ability to prevent exhaled particles from being released into the surrounding environment. These masks are normally of a closed design such that leaks are minimized and breathing of room air is controlled through a series of one-way valves. Filtration of exhaled breaths is accomplished either by placing a filter on the exhalation port or through an integral filter that is part of the mask itself. These masks first became popular in the Toronto (Canada) healthcare community during the 2003 SARS Crisis. SARS was identified as being respiratory based, and it was determined that conventional oxygen therapy devices were not designed for the containment of exhaled particles. In 2003, the HiOx80 oxygen mask was released for sale. The HiOx80 mask is a closed design mask that allows a filter to be placed on the exhalation port. Several new designs have emerged in the global healthcare community for the containment and filtration of potentially infectious particles. Other designs include the ISO- oxygen mask, the Flo2Max oxygen mask, and the O-Mask.

Typical oxygen masks allow a person to breathe in a mixture of room air and therapeutic oxygen. However, as filtered oxygen masks use a closed design that minimizes or eliminates the person&#x27;s contact with and ability to inhale room air, delivered oxygen concentrations in such devices have been found to be elevated, approaching 99% using adequate oxygen flows. Because all exhaled particles are contained within the mask, nebulized medications are also prevented from releasing into the surrounding atmosphere, decreasing the occupational exposure to healthcare staff and other people.

=== Aircraft ===
In the United States, most airlines restrict the devices allowed on board an aircraft. As a result, passengers are restricted in what devices they can use. Some airlines will provide cylinders for passengers with an associated fee. Other airlines allow passengers to carry on approved portable concentrators. However, the lists of approved devices varies by airline so passengers may need to check with any airline they are planning to fly on. Passengers are generally not allowed to carry on personal cylinders. In all cases, passengers need to notify the airline in advance of their equipment.

Effective May 13, 2009, the Department of Transportation and FAA ruled that a select number of portable oxygen concentrators are approved for use on all commercial flights. FAA regulations require larger airplanes to carry D-cylinders of oxygen for use in case of an emergency.

===Oxygen conserving devices===
Since the 1980s, devices have been available which conserve stored oxygen by delivering it during the portion of the breathing cycle when it is more effectively used. This has the effect of stored oxygen lasting longer, or a smaller, and therefore lighter, portable oxygen delivery system being practicable. This class of device can also be used with portable oxygen concentrators, making them more efficient.

The delivery of supplemental oxygen is most effective if it is made at a point in the breathing cycle when it will be inhaled to the alveoli, where gas transfer occurs. oxygen delivered later in the cycle will be inhaled into physiological dead space, wher it serves no useful purpose as it cannot diffuse into the blood. Oxygen delivered during stages of the breathing cycle in which it is not inhaled is also wasted.

A continuous constant flow rate uses a simple regulator, but is inefficient as a high percentage of the delivered gas does not reach the alveoli, and over half is not inhaled at all. A system which accumulates free-flow oxygen during resting and exhalation stages, (reservoir cannulas) makes a larger part of the oxygen available for inhalation, and it will be selectively inhaled during the initial part of inhalation, which reaches furthest into the lungs. A similar function is provided by a mechanical demand regulator which provides gas only during inhalation, but requires some physical effort by the user, and also ventilates dead space with oxygen. A third class of system (pulse dose oxygen conserving device, or demand pulse devices) senses the start of inhalation and provides a metered bolus, which if correctly matched to requirements, will be sufficient and effectively inhaled into the alveoli.Such systems can be pneumatically or electrically controlled.

Adaptive demand systems
A development in pulse demand delivery are devices that automatically adjust the volume of the pulsed bolus to suit the activity level of the user. This adaptive response in intended to reduce desaturation responses caused by exercise rate variation.

Pulsed delivery devices are available as stand alone modules or integrated into a system specifically designed to use compressed gas, liquid oxygen or oxygen concentrator sources. Integrated design usually allows optimisation of the system for the source type at the cost of versatility.

Transtracheal oxygen catheters are inserted directly into the trachea through a small opening in the front of the neck for that purpose. The opening is directed downward, towards the bifurcation of the bronchi. Oxygen introduced through the catheter bypasses the dead spaces of the nose, pharynx and upper trachea during inhalation, and during continuous flow, will accumulate in the anatomic dead space at the end of exhalation and be available for immediate inhalation to the alveoli on the following inhalation. This reduces wastage and provides efficiency roughly three times greater than with external continuous flow. This is roughly equivalent to a reservoir cannula. Transtracheal catheters have been found to be effective during rest, exercise and sleep.

<text>Bandit Queen is a 1994 Indian Hindi-language biographical action-adventure film based on the life of Phoolan Devi as covered in the book &quot;India&#x27;s Bandit Queen: The True Story of Phoolan Devi&quot; by the Indian author Mala Sen. It was directed by Shekhar Kapur and starred Seema Biswas as the title character. The music was composed by Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. The film won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi, Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie, and Best Direction for that year. The film premiered in the Directors&#x27; Fortnight section of the 1994 Cannes Film Festival, and was screened at the Edinburgh Film Festival. The film was selected as the Indian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 67th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.

== Plot ==
The film opens in the summer of 1968 in a small village in Uttar Pradesh. Phoolan is married to a twenty-something-year-old man called Puttilal (Aditya Shrivastava). Though child marriages were customary during that time, Phoolan&#x27;s mother Moola (Savitri Raekwar) objects to the timing of the match. Phoolan&#x27;s aging father Devideen (Ram Charan Nirmalker) conforming to his culture, disagrees, and Phoolan is sent off with Puttilal.

Phoolan is exposed to some sexual and exploitative abuses, including the caste system. (Phoolan&#x27;s family, as well as Puttilal&#x27;s family, belong to the lower-ranked Mallah sub-caste; the higher-ranked Thakur caste takes the lead in social and political situations.) Puttilal is physically and sexually abusive, and Phoolan eventually runs away and returns home. As Phoolan grows older, she faces incidents of (non-consensual) fondling and groping from the Thakur men (whose parents make up the &quot;panchayat&quot; or village government). At the next town meeting, the &quot;panchayat&quot; wields their patriarchal authority to banish Phoolan from the village, since she will not consent to the sexual advances of the higher caste males.

Accordingly, Phoolan lives with her cousin Kailash (Saurabh Shukla). En route to another village, she encounters a troop of &quot;daku&quot;s (bandits) of the Babu Gujjar gang, led by Vikram Mallah Mastana (Nirmal Pandey). Phoolan stays with Kailash for a while but is eventually compelled to leave. Angry and hopeless, Phoolan goes to the local police to try to have her ban lifted, but she is beaten, molested, and arrested by policemen, who rape her in custody. The Thakurs put up bail and have her released. But, unknown to her, the bail is a bribe (paid, through the police, to Babu Gujjar&#x27;s gang), and Babu Gujjar arrives to collect his prize.

In May 1979, Phoolan is abducted by Babu Gujjar (Anirudh Agarwal). Gujjar is a physically imposing man and a ruthless, predatory mercenary. Although Gujjar&#x27;s lieutenant Vikram is sympathetic towards Phoolan, Gujjar indiscriminately brutalizes and humiliates her, until one day Vikram catches him raping her and shoots him in the head. Vikram takes over the gang, and his empathy for Phoolan eventually grows into a relationship.

All goes well until Thakur Shri Ram (Govind Namdeo) is released from prison. Thakur Shri Ram is the real gang leader (boss of the erstwhile Gujjar). Shri Ram returns to his gang and while Vikram receives him with respect, Shri Ram bristles at Vikram&#x27;s egalitarian leadership style and covets Phoolan. Around this time, Phoolan revisits her former husband Puttilal, and with Vikram&#x27;s help, abducts him and exacts her justice for his rape and abuse, beating him up. She shares her closure with Vikram.

In August 1980, Shri Ram arranges to have Vikram assassinated, and abducts Phoolan, bringing her to the village of Behmai. Phoolan is repeatedly raped and beaten by Shri Ram and by the rest of the gang members, as punishment for her &quot;disrespect&quot; for his previous advances, and for her audacity at being equal. The final humiliation and punishment is that she is stripped naked, paraded around Behmai, beaten, and sent to fetch water from the well (in full view of the village).

A severely traumatized Phoolan returns to her cousin Kailash. She recovers gradually and seeks out Man Singh (Manoj Bajpai), an old friend of Vikram Mallah. Man Singh brings her to another large gang, led by Baba Mustakim (Rajesh Vivek). She relates her history to Baba and asks him for some men and weapons to form a gang. Baba Mustakim agrees, and Man Singh and Phoolan become the leaders of the new gang.

Phoolan leads her new gang with courage, generosity, humility, and shrewdness. Her stock and her legend grow. She becomes known as Phoolan Devi, the bandit queen. In February 1981, Baba Mustakim informs her of a large wedding in Behmai, with Thakur Shri Ram in attendance. As Phoolan departs, Baba Mustakim warns her to remain low-key. Phoolan attacks the wedding party and her gang exacts revenge on the entire Thakur clan of Behmai. They round up the men and beat them up. Many of the men are finally shot. This act of vengeance brings her to the attention of the national law enforcement authorities (in New Delhi). The top police officials now begin a massive manhunt for Phoolan, and Thakur Shri Ram relishes the opportunity to come to their aid.

The manhunt claims many lives in Phoolan&#x27;s gang. They are ultimately forced to hide out in the rugged ravines of Chambal without any food or water. Phoolan evaluates her options and decides to surrender. Her terms are to have her remaining mates protected and provided for. The film ends with Phoolan&#x27;s surrender in February 1983. The end credits indicate that all the charges against her were withdrawn (including the charges of murder at Behmai), and that she was released in 1994.

==Release==
===Box office===
In India, the film grossed (). In the United States and Canada, the film grossed $399,748 (). Combined, the film grossed approximately () worldwide.

===Controversy===
Although Phoolan Devi is a heroine in the film, she fiercely disputed its accuracy and fought to get it banned in India. She even threatened to immolate herself outside a theater if the film were not withdrawn. Eventually, she withdrew her objections after the producer Channel 4 paid her £40,000. Author-activist Arundhati Roy in her film review entitled, &quot;The Great Indian Rape Trick&quot;, questioned the right to &quot;restage the rape of a living woman without her permission&quot;, and charged Shekhar Kapur with exploiting Phoolan Devi and misrepresenting both her life and its meaning.

===Critical reception===
The film has a Rotten Tomatoes approval rating of 97% based on 29 reviews, with an average score of 7.6/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Brimming with bravura spectacle and an arresting turn by Seema Biswas, &quot;The Bandit Queen&quot; is a galvanizing ode to rebellion.&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum called it &quot;an eye-filling and often stirring movie&quot;, writing that at &quot;its best, this recalls radical third-world &#x27;westerns&#x27; like Glauber Rocha&#x27;s Antonio das mortes as well as Kenji Mizoguchi&#x27;s films about men&#x27;s inhumanity to women.&quot; He writes, however, that the film &quot;despite its ambition, bracing anger, and visual panache ... remains many notches below such reference points because of its sensationalistic and fairly indiscriminate piling on of horrors and violence, which ultimately becomes pornographic. The issue isn&#x27;t what actually happened to Phoolan Devi ... The issue is the film&#x27;s tendency to desensitize us with a surfeit of details.&quot; James Berardinelli gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, writing that the &quot;picture of human indignity and suffering painted by &quot;Bandit Queen&quot; is on par with that of &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;. As the Nazis treated the Jews like animals, so too do the upper caste Indians regard those born into poverty and squalor.&quot; &quot;Tightly-paced, powerfully-written, and well-acted&quot;, he writes, &quot;&quot;Bandit Queen&quot; is a first-rate adventure movie.&quot; Edward Guthmann of &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and described it as a &quot;handsome, impassioned film&quot; and praised Biswas&#x27; performance, calling it &quot;fireball of unrelenting, white-hot fury -- a slap in the face to her country and its barbaric, outdated treatment of women.&quot; He notes that the film &quot;makes no pretense of objectivity. Kapur clearly is outraged by the gender and caste biases of his country&quot;. This lack of objectivity is countered by Richard Corliss, who called it an &quot;exciting movie that brings Devi&#x27;s story to life with passion but without passing judgment.&quot; Reviewing the film at the Indian Panorama section of the International Film Festival of India, S. R. Ashok Kumar of &quot;The Hindu&quot; wrote that &quot;The director has woven the screenplay in such a way that not a single minute is dull. The camera by Ahok Mehta has moved with ease in the jungle and actors Saurav Shukla, Rajesh Vivek have done their best. Seema Biswas as Phoolan Devi has given a subtle performance&quot;.

<text>Melchior Cardinal de Polignac (11 October 1661 – 20 November 1742) was a French diplomat, Cardinal and Neo-Latin poet.

Second son of Armand XVI, marquis de Polignac and Marquis Chalancon, Governor of Puy; and Jacqueline de Beauvoir -Grimoard-de Roure (his third wife), Melchior de Polignac was born at Chateau de la Ronte, near Puy en Vélay, Lavoûte-sur-Loire, Haute-Loire, Auvergne.

==Education and early career==

A precocious child, he was taken by his uncle to Paris, and installed in the Jesuit Collège de Clermont (later named the Collège de Louis le Grand). At the appropriate time, he passed to the Collège de Harcourt, where thanks to the misdirected efforts of a teacher who was an enthusiast for Aristotle, Polignac adopted the opposite view and became a Cartesian. His thesis in Theology at the Sorbonne (1683) discussed the Kings of Judah who had destroyed the &quot;high places&quot;. He was either prescient, or aware of discussion around Louis XIV which led in two years to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) and the removal of the Huguenot &quot;high places&quot;. He had somehow attracted the patronage of the Cardinal Emmanuel de la Tour d&#x27;Auvergne de Bouillon, who took Polignac with him when he went to Rome for the Conclave following the death of Pope Innocent XI on 12 August 1689. Bouillon chose Polignac as one of his Conclavists. When the new Pope, Alexander VIII (Ottoboni) was elected, he assisted Cardinal de Bouillon and the French Ambassador, the Duc de Chaulnes, in attempting to improve relations between Louis XIV and the Holy See. Polignac was sent back to France to report to Louis, who immediately sent him back to Rome with further instructions. He was still in Rome when Alexander VIII died after less than sixteen months on the throne, and was again Conclavist of Cardinal de Bouillon in the Conclave of 1691 that elected Innocent XII (Pignatelli).

At an early age he achieved recognition as a diplomat. In 1693 he was sent as ambassador to Poland, where he worked with Cardinal Augustyn Michal Stefan Radziejowski, the Primate of Poland and nephew of King John III Sobieski, to bring about the election of François-Louis de Bourbon, prince de Conti as successor to John Sobieski (1697). The other candidate, Augustus the Strong of Saxony, however, was supported by Austria and Russia, and was elected over the French candidate. The subsequent failure of this intrigue led to Polignac&#x27;s temporary disgrace, and retirement to his Abbey of Bon-Port, but in 1702 he was restored to favour. In 1709 he was sent along with Nicholas du Blé, Maréchal d&#x27;Huxelles, as plenipotentiaries to conduct negotiations toward peace at the Dutch town of Geertruidenberg, but thanks to the obstinacy of Louis XIV, they were unsuccessful. Polignac left Getruidenberg on 25 July 1710 and had an interview with Louis XIV at Versailles on 31 July. In 1712 he was sent, again along with the Maréchal d&#x27;Huxelles, as a plenipotentiary of Louis XIV of France, to the Congress of Utrecht, and this time a peace was concluded.

==Character portrait==

The Duc de Saint-Simon provides a character portrait of the Abbé de Polignac around the end of 1705, as he was trying to restart his career and climb back into the notice of the French government, in particular the Duc de Bourbon—a portrait full of Saint-Simon&#x27;s usual snobbery and malevolence:

&quot;The Abbe de Polignac, after his adventures in Poland and the exile which followed them, came back to the surface. He was a tall man, very well made, with a handsome face, much cleverness, and above all, grace and polished manners; all kinds of knowledge, a most agreeable way of expressing himself, a touching voice, a gentle eloquence, insinuating, manly, exact in terms, charming in style, a gift of speech that was wholly his own; all about him was original and persuasive; amusing in narratives; possessed of a smattering of all the arts, all the manufactures, all the professions. In whatever belonged to his own, that is, learning and the ecclesiastical calling, he was rather less versed. … In other respects he was wholly occupied with his own ambition, without friendship, without gratitude, without any feeling except for himself; false, lax, indifferent to the means of success; without restraint from God or man, but always with a cloak of delicacy which gave him dupes; above all, a libertine, more from facility, coquetry, ambition, than from natural debauchery; so that while the heart was false and the soul not upright, his judgment was nil, his actions erroneous, his mind inaccurate, which, in spite of the most gracious and deceptive exterior, caused the failure in his hands of every enterprise intrusted to him.

&quot;With a face and talents so fitted to impress others, he was aided by his birth, to which, however, his property did not respond; but that fact dispelled all envy and conciliated favour and good will. The most amiable ladies of the Court, those even of advanced age, the men most distinguished for place or reputation, the persons of both sexes who chiefly set the tone,—he won them all. Even the King succumbed to him through M. du Maine, to whose wife he was devoted. He was on all the Marly trips, end every one was eager to enjoy his charms; he had them for all sorts of conditions, persons, and minds...&quot;

==Literary prestige==

On 26 May 1704 Abbé de Polignac was elected to the Académie Française, to the seat once held by Bossuet. His inauguration speech survives. In 1715 he became a member of the Académie royale des sciences, and was its President several times. In 1717, he became a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres.

He left unfinished a refutation of Lucretius, written in Latin verse, mostly during his first exile, and published after his death by the abbé de Rothelin (&quot;Anti-Lucretius&quot;, 1745). Lucretius&#x27; poem, &quot;De rerum natura&quot;, had also been left unpublished at that poet&#x27;s death, and was published through the efforts of Cicero, according to Jerome. Polignac&#x27;s poem was very popular in the eighteenth century and translated several times: for example, Jean-Pierre de Bougainville translated it into French prose in 1749, and François-Joseph Bérardier de Bataut translated it in French verse in 1786. It was translated into English by George Canning in 1766 in a self-published tome. It is now forgotten.

==Ecclesiastical career==

Pope Clement XI (Altieri) had been watching Polignac&#x27;s career. On 17 May 1706 he showed his favor by naming Polignac an Auditor of the Rota (one of the Church&#x27;s highest courts), a post made vacant by the promotion of Msgr. Joseph-Emmanuel de la Trémoille to the cardinalate. He spent the next three years in Rome. In 1712, he was created a Cardinal Deacon by Pope Clement XI (Altieri) on 18 May 1712 but the nomination was made &quot;in pectore&quot;, that is, his appointment was not made public at the time; it was only announced on 30 January 1713. At the time Polignac was a negotiator residing in a Protestant country, and it was deemed inadvisable to disrupt the course of events or cause offense by making his elevation public. While in Holland, he met and conversed with the famous Protestant philosophe, Pierre Bayle, who had begun publishing the Dictionnaire in 1697. Once the Peace was concluded, he was presented with the red biretta at Versailles by Louis XIV on 6 June 1713. He did not go to Rome for the induction ceremonies, and thus had no deaconry assigned to him for many years. He did not attend the Conclave of April–May 1721, which elected Innocent XIII (de&#x27; Conti), having been forbidden to travel to Rome by the French Regent, Philippe d&#x27; Orleans. But he was present at the Conclave of 1724, though he made a very late appearance on 23 April, after the Conclave had been in progress for seven weeks. He was eligible to participate, since he had finally been ordained deacon and priest, on 8 and 19 September 1722, by Msgr. Pierre Sabatier, the Bishop of Amiens. After the Conclave, on 27 September, the new Pope named him Cardinal Deacon of S. Maria in Porticu. Polignac immediately wrote an account of the Conclave and sent it off to the new First Minister of Louis XV, Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon. The Duke was so highly impressed by the report, both in content and style, that he had the King name Polignac French Chargé d&#x27;affaires to the Holy See, a post he held until 1732. He was thus absent from France for eight years.

On 20 November Benedict XIII (Orsini) promoted him to being Cardinal Priest of S. Maria in Via. On 19 December 1725 he transferred to the title of S. Maria degli Angeli. These promotions were conditioned, to be sure, by his appointment as Chargé d&#x27;affaires. Also in 1724, Polignac was elected a member of the Roman Arcadian Academy, founded in 1692 in memory of Queen Christina of Sweden; his academy name was Teodosso Cesisio. In 1730 he was in Rome and participated in the four-month-long Conclave which elected Clement XII (Corsini). He did not, at the age of 78, travel to Rome for the Conclave of 1740.

==His position in French society==

During the last years of Louis XIV, Abbé de Polignac enjoyed the position of Master of the King&#x27;s Chapel (1713–1716). But during the Regency Polignac became involved in the Cellamare Conspiracy, which attempted to dislodge Philippe d&#x27;Orleans from the Regency, and replace him with Philip V of Spain, uncle of the young King Louis XV. Polignac was relegated to Flanders and confined to his Abbey d&#x27;Anchin for three years. As soon as Louis XV attained his majority, however, he had Polignac rehabilitated and restored to his positions. In 1726, he received the Archbishopric of Auch. He was consecrated in Rome by Pope Benedict XIII. In 1728 he was granted the Collar of the Order of the Holy Spirit.

==Death==

He died at his home in what is now 80–88 rue Bonaparte in the 6th Arrondissement in Paris (also known as the &quot;Hôtel de Polignac&quot;), on 20 November 1742, at the age of 80, of &quot;hydropsie&quot;. He was buried in the Church of S. Sulpice in Paris. At the time of his death, he was also Abbot of Begars, Mouron, and Corbie; and Prior of Montdidier, Voute-sur-Loire, and Nagent le Rotron. After his death Frederick the Great bought his acclaimed collection of marble statues, which he had collected through his archaeological work in Rome.

<doc id="508478" wikidata="Q181251" url="?curid=508478" title="Aérospatiale Alouette III">
<text>The Aérospatiale Alouette III (, &quot;Lark&quot;; company designations SA 316 and SA 319) is a single-engine, light utility helicopter developed by French aircraft company Sud Aviation. During its production life, it proved to be a relatively popular rotorcraft; including multiple licensed manufacturers, more than 2,000 units were built.

The Alouette III was developed as an enlarged derivative of the earlier and highly successful Alouette II. Sharing many elements with its predecessor while offering an extra pair of seats and other refinements, it quickly became a commercial success amongst both civil and military customers. Further variants were also developed; amongst these was a high-altitude derivative, designated as the SA 315B Lama, which entered operational service during July 1971. The Alouette III was principally manufactured by Aérospatiale; the type was also built under licence by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in India as the HAL Chetak, by Industria Aeronautică Română (IAR) in Romania as the IAR 316 and F+W Emmen in Switzerland.

Similar to the Alouette II, in military service, it was used to perform missions such as aerial observation, photography, air-sea rescue, liaison, transport and training; it could also be armed with anti-tank missiles, anti-shipping torpedoes, and a fixed cannon. In a civilian capacity, the Alouette III was commonly used for casualty evacuation (often fitted with a pair of external stretcher panniers), crop-spraying, personnel transportation, and for carrying external loads. By the 2010s, many operators were in the process of drawing down their fleets and replacing them with more modern types; the French military intend to replace their Alouette IIIs with the newly developed Airbus Helicopters H160.

==Development==
===Origins===
The Alouette III has its origins with an earlier helicopter design by French aircraft manufacturer Sud-Est, the SE 3120 Alouette, which, while breaking several helicopter speed and distance records in July 1953, was deemed to have been too complex to be realistic commercial product. Having received financial backing from the French government, which had taken an official interest in the venture, the earlier design was used as a starting point for a new rotorcraft that would harness the newly developed turboshaft engine; only a few years prior, Joseph Szydlowski, the founder of Turbomeca, had successfully managed to develop the Artouste, a single shaft turbine engine derived from his Orédon turbine engine. An improved version of this engine was combined with the revised design to quickly produce a new helicopter, initially known as the SE 3130 Alouette II.

During April 1956, the first production Alouette II was completed, becoming the first production turbine-powered helicopter in the world. The innovative light helicopter soon broke several world records and became a commercial success. As a result of the huge demand for the Alouette II, manufacturer Sud Aviation took a great interest in the development of derivatives, as well as the more general ambition of embarking on further advancement in the field of rotorcraft.

In accordance with these goals, the company decided to commit itself to a new development programme with the aim of developing a more powerful helicopter that would be capable of accommodating up to 7 seats or a pair of stretchers. The design team was managed by French aerospace engineer René Mouille. The design produced, designated as the SE 3160, featured several improvements over the Alouette II; efforts were made to provide for a higher level of external visibility for the pilot as well as for greater aerodynamic efficiency via the adoption of a highly streamlined exterior.

===Into flight and production===

On 28 February 1959, the first prototype SE 3160 performed its maiden flight, piloted by French aviator Jean Boulet. Shortly thereafter, the SE 3160 would become more commonly known as the Alouette III. During its flight test programme, the prototype demonstrated its high altitude capabilities on several occasions; in June 1959, it landed at an altitude of over 4,000 metres in the Mont Blanc mountain range and, during October 1960, it was able to achieve the same feat at an altitude more than 6,000 metres in the Himalayas. During these attempts, it was flown by Jean Boulet, who was accompanied by a pair of passengers and 250 kg of equipment.

During 1961, the initial SE 3160 model of the type entered serial production. On 15 December 1961, the Alouette III received its airworthiness certificate, clearing it to enter operational service. Despite an order placed by the French Army for an initial batch of 50 Alouette IIIs during June 1961, the first two customers of the rotorcraft were in fact export sales, having been sold outside of France. The Alouette III was specifically designed to fly at high altitudes, as such, it quickly earned a reputation for its favourable characteristics during rescue operations. According to its manufacturer, it was the first helicopter to present an effective multi-mission capability and performance to match with its diverse mission range in both civil or military circles.

The SE 3160 model continued to be produced until 1968, when it was replaced by the refined SA 316B model. (After its production ended, the SE 3160 has sometimes been retroactively redesignated &quot;SA 316A&quot;, but its original SE 3160 designation is more commonly used, especially in older sources.) Both the SE 3160 and the SA 316B were powered by a more powerful version of the Artouste engine, the Artouste IIIB, whose turbine was rated to produce , though because of the limits of the engine&#x27;s reduction gearbox, the Artouste IIIB was de-rated to generate in service. The later SA 319B model adopted the more fuel-efficient Turbomeca Astazou XIVB engine, extending its range and endurance; on 10 July 1967, the Astazou-powered Alouette III performed its first flight. During 1979, the 1,437th Alouette III departed from the company&#x27;s assembly line in Marignane, France, after which the main production line was closed down as a consequence of diminishing demand for the type. During 1985, the final French-produced Alouette III was delivered. It had been produced from 1961 to 1985 in France, however, license production continued.

==== Overseas production ====

Despite the closure of Aérospatiale &#x27;s own production line, the event was not the end of the type&#x27;s manufacturing activity. Over 500 Alouette IIIs are recorded as having been manufactured under licence abroad in several countries, such as Romania, India, and Switzerland. Various versions of the Alouette III were also either licence-built or otherwise assembled by IAR in Romania (as the IAR 316), F+W Emmen (de) in Switzerland, by Fokker and Lichtwerk in the Netherlands, and in India as the HAL Chetak. The Romanian IAR 316, was an Aérospatiale SA 316B Alouette III license produced from 1971 to 1987, with 250 made with about half for Romania and half for export. Additionally, Romania also developed the IAR 317 Airfox, an attack helicopter version of the IAR 316;at least one prototype was made and was debuted at the 1985 Paris Air Show.

Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) obtained a licence to construct the Alouette III, which was known locally as the HAL Chetak, at their own production facilities in India. More than 300 units were built by HAL; the company has continued to independently update and indigenise the helicopter over the decades. A modernised variant of the Chetak has remained production, though at a diminished volume, into the 21st century. The latest HAL Chetak was delivered in 2021, and also included updated avionics. Over 350 Chetak had been produced the 2020s.

==Operational history==
===Argentina===
The Argentine Naval Aviation operated a total of 14 Alouette III helicopters. A single SA316B was on board the when she was sunk by torpedoes fired by during the 1982 Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom. A second Alouette III played an important role during the Argentine Invasion of South Georgia. On 2 December 2010, the last example was retired at a ceremony held at BAN Comandante Espora, Bahía Blanca.

===Australia===
Between April 1964 and 1967, a small batch of Alouette IIIs were delivered from France in a disassembled state to Australia. Following their assembly, these were used by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) at the Woomera Rocket Range for light passenger transport purpose and to assist in the recovery of missile parts in the aftermath of test launches conducted at the Range.

===Austria===
Between 1967-69 Austria acquired 12 SE3160 Alouette IIIs, which were upgraded to version SE316B. They are used for liaison and transport purposes and still play a vital role in rescue missions in the high mountains of Austria with their side-mounted hook.

They are stationed in Aigen im Ennstal, Klagenfurt and Schwaz in Tirol. Austria plans to decommission them beginning in 2023, and they are to be replaced by the Leonardo AW169M.

In addition to the original order, three more used Alouette III were acquired from other forces to replace attrition.

===Bangladesh===

Indian civilian authorities and the IAF donated 1 DC-3 Dakota (gifted by the Maharaja of Jodhpor), 1 Twin Otter plane, and 1 Alouette III helicopter for the newborn Bangladesh Air Force, which was to take advantage of the lack of night-fighting capability of the PAF to launch hit-and-run attacks on sensitive targets inside Bangladesh from the air. The Alouette III helicopter was rigged to fire 14 rockets from pylons attached to its side and had .303 Browning machine guns installed, in addition to having 1-inch (25 mm) steel plate welded to its floor for extra protection. Squadron Leader Sultan Mahmood, Flight Lieutenant Bodiul Alam, and Captain Shahabuddin, all of whom later won the Bir Uttam gallantry award, operated the helicopter.

===Chile===
During 1977, the Chilean Navy ordered a batch of ten SA-319Bs. These rotorcraft, which were delivered by the middle of 1978, were only made operational just before the peak of the Beagle conflict between Chile and neighbouring Argentina. The Alouette III was the first real organic maritime ship borne tactical helicopter to be operated by Chile&#x27;s naval forces; for this role, they were equipped with a radar and armed with rockets, guns, depth charges and a single light anti-submarine torpedo.

During the frantic training period in 1978 to meet wartime needs, a sole SA-319B was accidentally damaged, leading to it being placed in storage and subsequently repaired back to an airworthy condition years later. All ten Chilean Navy SA-319Bs were operational and in excellent conditions by the end of the 1980s, shortly after which they were replaced by larger SA532 Super Puma helicopters, and were bought by civilian operators.

===Denmark===
Between 1962 and 1967, a total of 8 Alouette IIIs were delivered to the Royal Danish Navy. They were primarily tasked with SAR and reconnaissance in support of the navy&#x27;s Arctic patrol ships. During 1982, they were replaced by a batch of British Westland Lynx.

===France===
During early 1960, the Alouette III officially entered squadron service with the French armed forces. In June 1971, having been suitably impressed by the type&#x27;s performance so far, the French Army elected to order a force of 50 Alouette IIIs for their own purposes. Amongst the most noteworthy uses that France applied the type to was the first use of helicopter-based anti-tank missiles in the form of the SS.11 MCLOS wire-guided missile.

During June 1960, an Alouette III carrying seven people successfully performed both take-offs and landings on Mont Blanc in the French Alps at an altitude of 4,810 metres (15,780 feet), an unprecedented altitude for such activities by a helicopter at the time. The same helicopter again demonstrated the type″s extraordinary performance in November 1960 by making take-offs and landings with a crew of two and a payload of 250 kg (551 lbs) in the Himalayas at an altitude of 6,004 metres (19,698 feet).

During June 2004, the Alouette III was retired from the French Air Force after 32 years of successful service, having been entirely replaced by the newer twin-engined Eurocopter EC 355 Ecureuil 2. The French Army also withdrew the last of their examples during 2013 in favour of more modern rotorcraft.

By 2017, the French Navy were still using the Alouette III in a reduced capacity, nonetheless being used to routinely conduct both Search and Rescue and logistics missions. Since the 1970s, the type has gradually been supplanted by the larger Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin, and later on, by the specialised Eurocopter AS565 Panther as an anti-submarine warfare platform. The use of twin-engined rotorcraft in the maritime environment has become somewhat of an expected standard, one which the single-engined Alouette III cannot satisfy, putting the type at an obvious disadvantage. During January 2018, it was announced that the French Navy would be replacing its remaining Alouette IIIs with rented Aérospatiale SA 330 Pumas as a stop-gap measure; this decision was reportedly taken due to its increasing unreliability, rapidly inflating operating costs, and the sheer age of the fleet. However, as of 2021 the Alouette III was still reported to be in service. The aircraft was finally withdrawn from French Navy service in June 2022. It had been in service for 60 years and was in active use right to the end, with the last three ending their service at the end of December. The aircraft was long known for ease of maintenance, which aided its use overseas, however and the end of its life it was requiring increasing maintenance hours and it was becoming hard to get spare parts which were no longer in production. The aircraft was still be used for training, interdiction missions, and shorter range mission.

===Ireland===

During 1963, the first pair of Alouette IIIs were delivered to the Irish Air Corps; a third rotorcraft arrived in 1964 and a batch of five further aircraft were delivered between 1972 and 1974. The service ultimately operated a total of eight Alouette IIIs between 1963 and 2007; throughout much of this period, they were the only helicopters operated by the Corps. 

On 21 September 2007, the Alouette III was formally retired from the Irish Air Corps during a ceremony held at Baldonnel Aerodrome. During 44 years of successful service, the Irish Alouette III fleet amassed over 77,000 flying hours. As well as routine military missions, the aircraft undertook some 1,717 search-and-rescue missions, saving 542 lives and flew a further 2,882 air ambulance flights. The oldest of the Alouettes, 195, is kept in &#x27;rotors running&#x27; condition for the Air Corps Museum.

===India===
Under a licensing arrangement between Aérospatiale and Indian aircraft manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), the Alouette III has been built under licence by HAL in India. Known locally under the designation HAL Chetak, more than 300 rotorcraft have been manufactured to date; the majority of these were acquired for military purposes with the Indian Armed Forces, who have used them to perform various mission roles, including training, transport, CASEVAC (casualty evacuation), communications and liaison roles. By 2017, the Chetak was reportedly serving as the most widely used IAF helicopter for training, light utility and light attack roles.

During 1986, the Indian Government constituted the Army&#x27;s Aviation Corps; consequently, the majority of Chetaks previously operated by AOP Squadrons were transferred from the Indian Air Force to the Indian Army on 1 November 1986. The Air Force has continued to fly a force of armed Chetaks in the anti-tank role as well as for CASEVAC missions and general duties. During the 2010s, the Chetak is being gradually replaced by the newer HAL Dhruv in the armed forces. An option to re-engine the HAL Chetak with the Turbomeca TM 333-2B engine, which would better facilitate high-altitude operations in the Himalayas was considered, but ultimately not pursued.

In addition to producing the type for Indian customers, HAL has also achieved some export sales of Chetak helicopters to several nations, including Namibia and Suriname. India has also opted to donate several secondhand Chetak helicopters to other countries, such as neighbouring Nepal. As of 2017, the Indian Navy has reportedly recognised the necessity of procuring a replacement for the type.

HAL Chetak was used in Operation Khukri which was a multinational operation launched in the United Nations Assistance Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), involving India, Ghana, Britain and Nigeria

Beginning in the 1970s, during Republic Day parades, Chetak helicopters have been decorated to look like animals such as dodo birds, fish, and, most notably, elephants. The helicopters decorated like elephants have become iconic in India, and known as names such as &quot;dancing elephant helicopters&quot; and &quot;flying elephants&quot;.

Newly built HAL Chetak were delivered as recently as 2019, after a 2017 contract for 8 additional Chetak. The last (or latest for now) new Chetak was delivered in 2021, and in 2022 marked 60 years of service in India. By the 2020s over 350 Hal Chetak had been produced.

===Indonesia===

The Indonesian Army Aviation received seven Alouette III in 1969, replacing their Mil Mi-4 which were grounded due to lack of spare parts. Their first combat operations was mopping up the Sarawak communist insurgents in Riam Sejawak, West Kalimantan Province. The Indonesian Army sent three Alouette III to participate in the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975 and its subsequent counter-guerilla operations, performing combat search-and-rescue and reconnaissance roles. In 2003, the Indonesian Army still has a single operational Alouette III.

===Pakistan===
During the 1960s, Pakistan purchased a fleet of 35 Alouette III helicopters to equip the Pakistan Air Force (PAF). These saw active combat during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, in which the type was mainly used for liaison and VIP-transport missions. In 2010, it was announced that Switzerland had come to an agreement with Pakistan for a number of ex-Swiss Alouette IIIs to be donated to the PAF; however, the terms of this agreement restricts their usage to performing search and rescue and disaster relief operations. Pakistan Navy started operating Alouette III helicopters in 1977. The helicopters are still in service and have a long history of flying laurels.

===Portugal===


Portugal was the first country to use the Alouette III in combat. In 1963, during the Overseas Wars in Angola, Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea, Portugal began using Alouette IIIs in combat, mainly in air assault and medevac operations, where it proved its qualities. Besides the basic transport version (code named &quot;canibal&quot;, plural &quot; canibais&quot;), Portugal used a special version of the Alouette III with a MG 151 20 mm autocannon mounted in the rear in order to fire from the left side door; it was designated &quot;helicanhão&quot; (heli-cannon) and code named &quot;lobo mau&quot; (big bad wolf).

In the Overseas Wars, the Portuguese usually launched air assaults with groups of six or seven Alouette III: five or six &quot;canibais&quot; – each usually carrying five paratroopers or commandos – and a &quot;lobo mau&quot; heli-cannon. The Portuguese practice was for the troops to jump from the &quot;canibais&quot; when the helicopters were hovering two-three metres above the ground – famous images of these disembarking troops became an iconic image of the war. The landing of the troops was covered by the &quot;lobo mau&quot;. While the troops performed the ground assault, the &quot;canibais&quot; moved away from the combat zone, while the &quot;lobo mau&quot; stayed to provide fire support, destroying enemy resistance and concentration points with the fire from its 20 mm autocannon. Once the ground combat had finished, the &quot;canibais&quot; returned; firstly to collect the wounded, then the rest of the troops.

In April 2020, the last of Portugal&#x27;s SE3160 Alouette IIIs were withdrawn from service, the type having been replaced by five AgustaWestland AW119 Koala.

===Republic of Korea===

In 1977, the Republic of Korea Navy started operating 12 Alouette IIIs. It was typically dispatched aboard several destroyers in an anti-submarine capacity. On 13 August 1983, the Republic of Korea Navy discovered a naval vessel of the Korean People&#x27;s Army that had entering their sea. A single Alouette III engaged the spy ship and destroyed it using an AS.12 missile; following the mission, the specific helicopter involved received a victory marking, which was the only aircraft to receive such a mark in the entire Republic of Korea Armed Forces. The Alouette III was also operated as a rescue helicopter, responding to major incidents such as the crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 733 in Mokpo, Republic of Korea, on 26 July 1993.

Following the introduction of the Westland Lynx during the early 1990s, the Alouette IIIs were diverted to secondary roles, such as training, and were gradually phased out of service. A substantial number were withdrawn in 2006. South Korea&#x27;s remaining Alouette IIIs were withdrawn from service in December 2019.

===Rhodesia===
The nation of Rhodesia emerged as a prolific user of both the Alouette II and its enlarged sibling, the Alouette III. Early operations were flown with an emphasis on its use by the Rhodesian Army and British South Africa Police, including paramilitary and aerial reconnaissance operations. Throughout the 1960s, the type progressively spread into additional roles, including aerial supply, casualty evacuation, communications relays, and troop-transports. Rhodesian aerial operations would typically involve flying under relatively high and hot conditions, which reduced the efficiency of aircraft in general; however, the Alouette II proved to be both hardy and relatively resistant to battle damage. In order to extend the inadequate range of the type, fuel caches were strategically deployed across the country to be used for refuelling purposes.
At its peak, No. 7 Squadron of the Rhodesian Air Force operated a force of 34 Alouette IIIs, which would normally operate in conjunction with a smaller number of Alouette IIs. They played a major part in the Rhodesian Forces&#x27; Fireforce doctrine, in which they would rapidly deploy ground troops, function as aerial observation and command posts, and provide mobile fire support as armed gunships. In order to improve performance, Rhodesia&#x27;s Alouette fleet was subject to extensive modifications during its service life, including changes to their refueling apparatus, gun sights, and cabin fittings, along with the installation of additional armouring and armaments.

Over time, the Rhodesian Security Forces developed an innovative deployment tactic of rapidly encircling and enveloping enemies, known as the Fireforce, for which the Alouette II was a core component. The quick-reaction Fireforce battalions were typically centred at Centenary and Mount Darwin; however, a deliberate emphasis was placed on locating both rotorcraft and troops as close to a current or anticipated theatre of operations as would be feasibly possible.

===South Africa===

The Alouette III served for over 44 years in the South African Air Force (SAAF); it is believed that 121 examples were acquired between 1962 and 1975 for the service from France. During 1966, by which point the SAAF had built up a fleet of around 50 Alouette IIIs already, it was decided to dispatch several of the type to support ground troops stationed in South West Africa attempting to contain the emerging South West African People&#x27;s Organisation (SWAPO); this would be the beginnings of what would become the lengthy South African Border War. The type saw considerable action during the conflict; while initially used for more passive operations such as aerial reconnaissance, from July 1967 onwards, Alouette III participated in active combat missions as well. It was frequently employed as a support platform for performing South African counterstrike operations inside neighbouring Namibia and Angola. Reportedly, a total of eight Alouette IIIs had been listed as having been lost over the conflict zone by the end of the war.

By 1990, there were a total of 70 Alouette III helicopters remaining in active service. Throughout the course of its service life with the SAAF, the Alouette III fleet was recorded as having accumulated more than 346,000 flight hours. During June 2006, the last Alouette III was officially withdrawn from SAAF service at a ceremony held at AFB Swartkop, near Pretoria.

During January 2013, reports emerged that South African defense officials were in the process of planning to transfer some of the retired fleet, along with spare parts and associated support equipment, to the Zimbabwean Air Force; South African newspaper Mail &amp; Guardian claimed that the rotorcraft could be used to sway politics in the nation in favour of the incumbent President, Robert Mugabe. However, during February 2013, an interim court order was issued which blocked the proposed sale of South African Alouette IIIs to Zimbabwe. In February 2014, reports emerged that South Africa now intended to sell part of the ex-SAAF fleet to Namibia instead.

===Suriname===
During 1986, the South American country of Suriname purchased a pair of secondhand Alouette III helicopters from Portugal. During 1999, the Surinam Air Force opted to retire and sell off its Alouette III helicopters. In their place, three newly built HAL Chetaks (an Indian version of the Alouette IIIs) were delivered to the Suriname Air Force on 13 March 2015, while the pilots and technicians of the Surinam Air Force underwent training on the type in Bangalore, India for some time.

===Switzerland===
During 1964, the Swiss Air Force opted to procure a batch of nine Alouette III rotorcraft directly from Aérospatiale; further orders included one placed in 1966 for 15 more. In addition, a total of 60 SA-316Bs (often referred to as the &quot;F+W Alouette IIIS&quot;) were licence-assembled by F+W Emmen in Switzerland.

During 2004, the Swiss Armed Forces announced the expected withdrawal of the Alouette III from front-line service would commence by 2006 and that it was to be entirely retired by 2010; they have been replaced by a smaller force of 20 new-built Eurocopter EC635s. Since their retirement, at least 10 ex-Swiss Alouettes have been gifted to Pakistan to perform search and rescue operations.

<text>In geometry, a dodecagon, or 12-gon, is any twelve-sided polygon.

==Regular dodecagon==

A regular dodecagon is a figure with sides of the same length and internal angles of the same size. It has twelve lines of reflective symmetry and rotational symmetry of order 12. A regular dodecagon is represented by the Schläfli symbol {12} and can be constructed as a truncated hexagon, t{6}, or a twice-truncated triangle, tt{3}. The internal angle at each vertex of a regular dodecagon is 150°.

===Area===
The area of a regular dodecagon of side length &quot;a&quot; is given by: 
:formula_1

And in terms of the apothem &quot;r&quot; (see also inscribed figure), the area is:
:formula_2

In terms of the circumradius &quot;R&quot;, the area is:
:formula_3

The span &quot;S&quot; of the dodecagon is the distance between two parallel sides and is equal to twice the apothem. A simple formula for area (given side length and span) is: 
:formula_4
This can be verified with the trigonometric relationship:
:formula_5

===Perimeter===
The perimeter of a regular dodecagon in terms of circumradius is: 
:formula_6

The perimeter in terms of apothem is:
:formula_7
This coefficient is double the coefficient found in the apothem equation for area.

==Dodecagon construction==
As 12 = 22 × 3, regular dodecagon is constructible using compass-and-straightedge construction:


==Dissection==

Coxeter states that every zonogon (a 2&quot;m&quot;-gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into &quot;m&quot;(&quot;m&quot;-1)/2 parallelograms.
In particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi. For the &quot;regular dodecagon&quot;, &quot;m&quot;=6, and it can be divided into 15: 3 squares, 6 wide 30° rhombs and 6 narrow 15° rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 6-cube, with 15 of 240 faces. The sequence OEIS sequence defines the number of solutions as 908, including up to 12-fold rotations and chiral forms in reflection.
One of the ways the mathematical manipulative pattern blocks are used is in creating a number of different dodecagons. They are related to the rhombic dissections, with 3 60° rhombi merged into hexagons, half-hexagon trapezoids, or divided into 2 equilateral triangles.
== Symmetry ==

The &quot;regular dodecagon&quot; has Dih12 symmetry, order 24. There are 15 distinct subgroup dihedral and cyclic symmetries. Each subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the g12 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can be seen as directed edges.
==Occurrence==

===Tiling===

A regular dodecagon can fill a plane vertex with other regular polygons in 4 ways:
Here are 3 example periodic plane tilings that use regular dodecagons, defined by their vertex configuration:
== Skew dodecagon==

A skew dodecagon is a skew polygon with 12 vertices and edges but not existing on the same plane. The interior of such a dodecagon is not generally defined. A &quot;skew zig-zag dodecagon&quot; has vertices alternating between two parallel planes.

A regular skew dodecagon is vertex-transitive with equal edge lengths. In 3-dimensions it will be a zig-zag skew dodecagon and can be seen in the vertices and side edges of a hexagonal antiprism with the same D5d, [2+,10] symmetry, order 20. The dodecagrammic antiprism, s{2,24/5} and dodecagrammic crossed-antiprism, s{2,24/7} also have regular skew dodecagons.

===Petrie polygons===
The regular dodecagon is the Petrie polygon for many higher-dimensional polytopes, seen as orthogonal projections in Coxeter planes. Examples in 4 dimensions are the 24-cell, snub 24-cell, 6-6 duoprism, 6-6 duopyramid. In 6 dimensions 6-cube, 6-orthoplex, 221, 122. It is also the Petrie polygon for the grand 120-cell and great stellated 120-cell.
==Related figures==
A dodecagram is a 12-sided star polygon, represented by symbol {12/n}. There is one regular star polygon: {12/5}, using the same vertices, but connecting every fifth point. There are also three compounds: {12/2} is reduced to 2{6} as two hexagons, and {12/3} is reduced to 3{4} as three squares, {12/4} is reduced to 4{3} as four triangles, and {12/6} is reduced to 6{2} as six degenerate digons.

Deeper truncations of the regular dodecagon and dodecagrams can produce isogonal (vertex-transitive) intermediate star polygon forms with equal spaced vertices and two edge lengths. A truncated hexagon is a dodecagon, t{6}={12}. A quasitruncated hexagon, inverted as {6/5}, is a dodecagram: t{6/5}={12/5}.
==Examples in use==

In block capitals, the letters E, H and X (and I in a slab serif font) have dodecagonal outlines. A cross is a dodecagon, as is the logo for the Chevrolet automobile division.

The regular dodecagon features prominently in many buildings. The Torre del Oro is a dodecagonal military watchtower in Seville, southern Spain, built by the Almohad dynasty. The early thirteenth century Vera Cruz church in Segovia, Spain is dodecagonal. Another example is the Porta di Venere (Venus&#x27; Gate), in Spello, Italy, built in the 1st century BC has two dodecagonal towers, called &quot;Propertius&#x27; Towers&quot;.

Regular dodecagonal coins include:
*British threepenny bit from 1937 to 1971, when it ceased to be legal tender.
*British One Pound Coin, introduced in 2017.
*Australian 50-cent coin
*Fijian 50 cents
*Tongan 50-seniti, since 1974
*Solomon Islands 50 cents
*Croatian 25 kuna
*Romanian 5000 lei, 2001–2005
*Canadian penny, 1982–1996
*South Vietnamese 20 đồng, 1968–1975
*Zambian 50 ngwee, 1969–1992
*Malawian 50 tambala, 1986–1995
*Mexican 20 centavos, 1992-2009

<text>Cornelius Bumpus (May 7, 1945 – February 3, 2004) was an American woodwind, brass and keyboard player and vocalist from Santa Cruz, California.

==Biography==
Bumpus began his musical career playing alto saxophone at ten for his school band, and by age twelve he was playing at Luso-American dances. He attended Santa Cruz High School where he performed in the band and won the John Philip Sousa Award. He also played school dances with his own band, Corny and the Corvettes. In 1966 he was in Bobby Freeman&#x27;s band and after that he began his association with many well-known groups.
His role in these bands was primarily as a saxophonist and organist. His most notable touring was with the Doobie Brothers and Steely Dan. Bumpus toured with Steely Dan from 1993 to 2003. In 2002, he worked on the &quot;Big Blue Earth&quot; project sponsored by the Church of Christ, Scientist. During the 1980s, Bumpus enjoyed a short tenure with Café Society, a Los Angeles pop band, in which he played in a horn section with the trombonist Dan Levine and trumpeter Anne Petereit King.

In 1981, Bumpus issued his first solo LP, &quot;A Clear View&quot;, which featured his singing, writing and sax playing, stretching out with the band on several, long, jazzy jams over six minutes each.

In 1999 Bumpus was part of a Doobie Brothers tribute band with fellow former members Chet McCracken and Dave Shogren. Also in that band was Billy Martin (keyboards/vocals), Allen Carman (bass/vocals) and Todd Plant (lead vocals). Chris Pinnick, former guitarist for Chicago, was added at a later date. The Doobie Brothers obtained an injunction preventing this band from performing under any variation of the &quot;Doobie Brothers&quot; name.

Bumpus suffered a heart attack on February 3, 2004, while on an airline flight from New York to California, where he was scheduled to perform at the Columbia College Jazz Concert Series. The plane made an emergency landing in Sioux City, Iowa, so he could get medical assistance, but Bumpus had died by the time the plane reached the ground. He was 58 at the time of his death.

<doc id="508492" wikidata="Q418639" url="?curid=508492" title="Locked nucleic acid">
<text>A locked nucleic acid (LNA), also known as bridged nucleic acid (BNA), and often referred to as inaccessible RNA, is a modified RNA nucleotide in which the ribose moiety is modified with an extra bridge connecting the 2&#x27; oxygen and 4&#x27; carbon. The bridge &quot;locks&quot; the ribose in the 3&#x27;-&quot;endo&quot; (North) conformation, which is often found in the A-form duplexes. This structure provides for increased stability against enzymatic degradation. LNA also offers improved specificity and affinity in base-pairing as a monomer or a constituent of an oligonucleotide. LNA nucleotides can be mixed with DNA or RNA residues in a oligonucleotide.

==Synthesis==
Obika et al. were the first to chemically synthesize LNA in 1997, independently followed by Jesper Wengel&#x27;s group in 1998. This became possible after Zamecnick and Stephenson laid the groundwork on the possibility of oligonucleotides being great agents for controlling gene expression in 1978. To date, two different approaches, referred to as linear and convergent strategies respectively, have been shown to produce high yield and efficient LNAs. The linear strategy of synthesis was first detailed in the works of Obika et al. In this approach, uridine (or any readily available RNA nucleoside) can be used as the starting material. The convergent strategy requires the synthesis of a sugar intermediate which serves a glycosyl donor necessary for coupling with nucleobases. Commonly, D-glucose is used to produce the sugar intermediate which is subsequently reacted with nucleobases using a modified Vorbrügen procedure allowing for stereoselective coupling.

The addition of different moieties has remained a possibility with the maintenance of key physicochemical properties like the high affinity and specificity evident in the originally synthesized LNA. Such oligomers are synthesized chemically and are commercially available.

=== Incorporation into DNA/RNA ===
LNA can be incorporated into DNA and RNA using the promiscuity of certain DNA and RNA polymerases. Phusion DNA polymerase, a commercially designed enzyme based on a Pfu DNA polymerase, efficiently incorporates LNA into DNA.

== Properties ==
LNA offers enhanced biostability compared to biological nucleic acids. LNA modified oligonucleotides have demonstrated improved thermodynamics in hybridization to RNA, ssDNA, and dsDNA.

== Applications ==

===LNAzymes ===
DNAzymes can be modified to include LNA residues, producing LNAzymes (LNA-modified DNAzymes). These modified oligonucleotides, like their DNAzyme relatives, are generally endonucleases that bind to specific RNA target sequences and cleave the phosphodiester bond that exists between the nucleotides. However, they demonstrate more efficient cleavage of phosphodiester bonds compared to their unmodified counterparts. Modification of the substrate recognition arms of DNAzymes with LNA monomers yields a LNAzyme which recognizes coxsackievirus A21 (CAV-21) and cleaves its RNA target sequence similar to one in the 5&#x27; untranslated region (5&#x27; UTR) of the human rhinovirus-14 (HRV-14); a sequence unrecognized by unmodified DNAzymes.

===Therapeutics===
Using LNA based oligonucleotides therapeutically is an emerging field in biotechnology. A variety of LNA oligonucleotides have been assessed for their pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles. Studies concluded that LNA toxicity is generally independent of oligonucleotide sequence, and displays a preferential safety profile for translatable therapeutic applications.

LNA has been investigated for its therapeutic properties in treating cancers and infectious diseases. A locked nucleic acid phosphorothioate antisense molecule, termed SPC2996, has been developed to target the mRNA coding for Bcl-2 oncoprotein, a protein that inhibits apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (CLL). Phase I and II clinical trials demonstrated a dose dependent reduction in circulating CLL cells in approximately 30% of the sample population, suggesting further investigation into SPC2996.

LNA has also been applied to Miravirsen, an experimental therapeutic intended for the treatment of Hepatitis C, constituting a 15-nucleotide phosphorothioate sequence with binding specificity for MiR-122 (a miRNA expressed in hepatocytes). 

=== Detection and diagnosis ===

Allele-specific PCR using LNA allows for the design of shorter primers, without compromising binding specificity. 

LNA has been incorporated in fluorescence &quot;in situ&quot; hybridization (FISH). FISH is a common technique used to visualize genetic material in a variety of cells, but studies noted that this technique has been limited by low probe hybridization efficiency. Conversely, LNA-incorporated probes demonstrated increased hybridization efficiency in both DNA and RNA. The improved efficiency of LNA-incorporated FISH has resulted in FISH analysis of the human chromosome, several types of non-human cells, and microarrays.

LNA genotyping assays have been conducted as well, specifically to detect a mutation in apolipoprotein B.

For its high affinity for mismatch discrimination, LNA has been studied for its applications in diagnostic tools. Immobilized LNA probes have been introduced in a multiplex SNP genotyping assay.

=== Gene editing ===
LNA-modified ssODNs (synthetic single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides) can be used like ordinary ssODNs for single-base gene editing. Using LNA at or close to the intended site of modification offers evasion of DNA mismatch repair due to the higher thermodynamic stability it has.

<text>Active Exploits is a diceless set of role-playing game rules by Precis Intermedia Gaming. The core rules (which contain no setting) are distributed for free as a PDF file, or for a fee as a printed book. There are a number of published game settings and official game conversions which use these rules.

The system is considered innovative, but more in common with GURPS and Unisystem, rather than other diceless games such as Amber and Nobilis

The game has options for freeform and live action role-playing, as well as for converting the game to other systems. Ample conversion rules allow the adaptation of the engine to a number of commercial systems.

== Published Settings and Official Conversions ==
Active Exploit has converted other published RPGs into diceless versions.
*&quot;&quot;, a role-playing game based in Feudal Japan.
*&quot;Dreamwalker&quot;, a setting taking place in others&#x27; dreams.
*&quot;Blood Island Diceless&quot;, swashbuckling adventures on the high seas.
*&quot;CORPS Diceless&quot;, based on &quot;CORPS&quot;, a conspiracy themed RPG about UFOs, vampires, secret societies, etc.
*&quot;Bloodshadows (3rd Edition)&quot; core book has Active Exploits conversion rules.

== Awards ==
The game won an Indie RPG award in 2003 for free game of the year and best support.

== Modes of Play ==

===Basic Exploits===
This is an introductory version of the rules, intended for those who are new to the system or prefer something less involved.

===Advanced Exploits===
This presents both advanced and optional rules which players can selectively use. Some examples of advanced elements are:

*Flairs: These zoom in on character&#x27;s abilities.
*Fields of Expertise: These replace the need for skills by generalizing occupational knowledge.
*Convictions: These expand on the basic concept of Principles (in Basic Exploits) by utilizing Revelation and Dementia.
*Threads: These define group dynamics and help encourage more character-oriented roleplaying.
*Vehicles: Rules for using vehicles, from motorcycles to starships.

===Live Exploits===
These are guidelines from the Basic and Advanced Exploits sections which are optimized for live action role-playing.

===Adaptive Exploits (Special Edition Softcover only)===
A framework for converting characters from other game systems for use with Active Exploits, and adapting other ability/skill-based systems for diceless play.

<text>A compressor is a mechanical device that increases the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume. An air compressor is a specific type of gas compressor.

Many compressors can be staged, that is, the gas is compressed several times in steps or stages, to increase discharge pressure. Often, the second stage is physically smaller than the primary stage, to accommodate the already compressed gas without reducing its pressure. Each stage further compresses the gas and increases its pressure and also temperature (if inter cooling between stages is not used).

==Types==
Compressors are similar to pumps: both increase the pressure on a fluid (such as a gas) and both can transport the fluid through a pipe. The main distinction is that the focus of a compressor is to change the density or volume of the fluid, which is mostly only achievable on gases. Gases are compressible, while liquids are relatively incompressible, so compressors are rarely used for liquids. The main action of a pump is to pressurize and transport liquids.

The main and important types of gas compressors are illustrated and discussed below:
===Positive displacement===
A positive displacement compressor is a system that compresses the air by the displacement of a mechanical linkage reducing the volume (since the reduction in volume due to a piston in thermodynamics is considered as positive displacement of the piston).

Put another way, a positive displacement compressor is one that operates by drawing in a discrete volume of gas from its inlet then forcing that gas to exit via the compressor&#x27;s outlet. The increase in the pressure of the gas is due, at least in part, to the compressor pumping it at a mass flow rate which cannot pass through the outlet at the lower pressure and density of the inlet.

====Reciprocating compressors====

Reciprocating compressors use pistons driven by a crankshaft. They can be either stationary or portable, can be single or multi-staged, and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines. Small reciprocating compressors from 5 to 30 horsepower (hp) are commonly seen in automotive applications and are typically for intermittent duty. Larger reciprocating compressors well over are commonly found in large industrial and petroleum applications. Discharge pressures can range from low pressure to very high pressure (&gt;18000 psi or 124 MPa). In certain applications, such as air compression, multi-stage double-acting compressors are said to be the most efficient compressors available, and are typically larger, and more costly than comparable rotary units. Another type of reciprocating compressor, usually employed in automotive cabin air conditioning systems, is the swash plate or wobble plate compressor, which uses pistons moved by a swash plate mounted on a shaft (see &quot;axial piston pump&quot;).

Household, home workshop, and smaller job site compressors are typically reciprocating compressors or less with an attached receiver tank.

A linear compressor is a reciprocating compressor with the piston being the rotor of a linear motor.

This type of compressor can compress a wide range of gases, including refrigerant, hydrogen, and natural gas. Because of this, it finds use in a wide range of applications in many different industries and can be designed to a wide range of capacities, by varying size, number of cylinders, and cylinder unloading. However, it suffers from higher losses due to clearance volumes, resistance due to discharge and suction valves, weighs more, is difficult to maintain due to having a large number of moving parts, and it has inherent vibration.

====Ionic liquid piston compressor====
An ionic liquid piston compressor, &quot;ionic compressor&quot; or &quot;ionic liquid piston pump&quot; is a hydrogen compressor based on an ionic liquid piston instead of a metal piston as in a piston-metal diaphragm compressor.

====Rotary screw compressors====

Rotary screw compressors use two meshed rotating positive-displacement helical screws to force the gas into a smaller space. These are usually used for continuous operation in commercial and industrial applications and may be either stationary or portable. Their application can be from to over and from low pressure to moderately high pressure (&gt;).

The classifications of rotary screw compressors vary based on stages, cooling methods, and drive types among others. Rotary screw compressors are commercially produced in Oil Flooded, Water Flooded and Dry type. The efficiency of rotary compressors depends on the air drier, and the selection of air drier is always 1.5 times volumetric delivery of the compressor.

Designs with a single screw or three screws instead of two exist.

Screw compressors have fewer moving components, larger capacity, less vibration and surging, can operate at variable speeds, and typically have higher efficiency. Small sizes or low rotor speeds are not practical due to inherent leaks caused by clearance between the compression cavities or screws and compressor housing. They depend on fine machining tolerances to avoid high leakage losses and are prone to damage if operated incorrectly or poorly serviced.

====Rotary vane compressors====

Rotary vane compressors consist of a rotor with a number of blades inserted in radial slots in the rotor. The rotor is mounted offset in a larger housing that is either circular or a more complex shape. As the rotor turns, blades slide in and out of the slots keeping contact with the outer wall of the housing. Thus, a series of increasing and decreasing volumes is created by the rotating blades. Rotary vane compressors are, with piston compressors one of the oldest of compressor technologies.

With suitable port connections, the devices may be either a compressor or a vacuum pump. They can be either stationary or portable, can be single or multi-staged, and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines. Dry vane machines are used at relatively low pressures (e.g., ) for bulk material movement while oil-injected machines have the necessary volumetric efficiency to achieve pressures up to about in a single stage. A rotary vane compressor is well suited to electric motor drive and is significantly quieter in operation than the equivalent piston compressor.

Rotary vane compressors can have mechanical efficiencies of about 90%.

====Rolling piston====
The Rolling piston in a rolling piston style compressor plays the part of a partition between the vane and the rotor. Rolling piston forces gas against a stationary vane.

2 of these compressors can be mounted on the same shaft to increase capacity and reduce vibration and noise. A design without a spring is known as a swing compressor.

In refrigeration and air conditioning, this type of compressor is also known as a rotary compressor, with rotary screw compressors being also known simply as screw compressors.

It offers higher efficiency than reciprocating compressors due to less losses from the clearance volume between the piston and the compressor casing, it&#x27;s 40% to 50% smaller and lighter for a given capacity (which can impact material and shipping costs when used in a product), causes less vibration, has fewer components and is more reliable than a reciprocating compressor. But its structure does not allow capacities beyond 5 refrigeration tons, is less reliable than other compressor types, and is less efficient than other compressor types due to losses from the clearance volume.

====Scroll compressors====

A scroll compressor, also known as scroll pump and scroll vacuum pump, uses two interleaved spiral-like vanes to pump or compress fluids such as liquids and gases. The vane geometry may be involute, archimedean spiral, or hybrid curves. They operate more smoothly, quietly, and reliably than other types of compressors in the lower volume range.

Often, one of the scrolls is fixed, while the other orbits eccentrically without rotating, thereby trapping and pumping or compressing pockets of fluid between the scrolls.

Due to minimum clearance volume between the fixed scroll and the orbiting scroll, these compressors have a very high volumetric efficiency.

These compressors are extensively used in air conditioning and refrigeration because they are lighter, smaller and have fewer moving parts than reciprocating compressors and they are also more reliable. They are more expensive though, so peltier coolers or rotary and reciprocating compressors may be used in applications where cost is the most important or one of the most important factors to consider when designing a refrigeration or air conditioning system.

This type of compressor was used as the supercharger on Volkswagen G60 and G40 engines in the early 1990s.

When compared with reciprocating and rolling piston compressors, scroll compressors are more reliable since they have fewer components and have a simpler structure, are more efficient since they have no clearance volume nor valves, and possess the advantages both of surging less and not vibrating so much. But, when compared with screw and centrifugal compressors, scroll compressors have lower efficiencies and smaller capacities.

====Diaphragm compressors====
A diaphragm compressor (also known as a membrane compressor) is a variant of the conventional reciprocating compressor. The compression of gas occurs by the movement of a flexible membrane, instead of an intake element. The back-and-forth movement of the membrane is driven by a rod and a crankshaft mechanism. Only the membrane and the compressor box come in contact with the gas being compressed.

The degree of flexing and the material constituting the diaphragm affects the maintenance life of the equipment. Generally stiff metal diaphragms may only displace a few cubic centimeters of volume because the metal cannot endure large degrees of flexing without cracking, but the stiffness of a metal diaphragm allows it to pump at high pressures. Rubber or silicone diaphragms are capable of enduring deep pumping strokes of very high flexion, but their low strength limits their use to low-pressure applications, and they need to be replaced as plastic embrittlement occurs.

Diaphragm compressors are used for hydrogen and compressed natural gas (CNG) as well as in a number of other applications.
The photograph on the right depicts a three-stage diaphragm compressor used to compress hydrogen gas to for use in a prototype compressed hydrogen and compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling station built in downtown Phoenix, Arizona by the Arizona Public Service company (an electric utilities company). Reciprocating compressors were used to compress the natural gas. The reciprocating natural gas compressor was developed by Sertco.

The prototype alternative fueling station was built in compliance with all of the prevailing safety, environmental and building codes in Phoenix to demonstrate that such fueling stations could be built in urban areas.

===Dynamic===
====Air bubble compressor====
Also known as a trompe. A mixture of air and water generated through turbulence is allowed to fall into a subterranean chamber where the air separates from the water. The weight of falling water compresses the air in the top of the chamber. A submerged outlet from the chamber allows water to flow to the surface at a lower height than the intake. An outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air to the surface. A facility on this principle was built on the Montreal River at Ragged Shutes near Cobalt, Ontario in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines.

====Centrifugal compressors====

Centrifugal compressors use a rotating disk or impeller in a shaped housing to force the gas to the rim of the impeller, increasing the velocity of the gas. A diffuser (divergent duct) section converts the velocity energy to pressure energy. They are primarily used for continuous, stationary service in industries such as oil refineries, chemical and petrochemical plants and natural gas processing plants. Their application can be from to thousands of horsepower. With multiple staging, they can achieve high output pressures greater than .

This type of compressor, along with screw compressors, are extensively used in large refrigeration and air conditioning systems. Magnetic bearing (magnetically levitated) and air bearing centrifugal compressors exist.

Many large snowmaking operations (like ski resorts) use this type of compressor. They are also used in internal combustion engines as superchargers and turbochargers. Centrifugal compressors are used in small gas turbine engines or as the final compression stage of medium-sized gas turbines.

Centrifugal compressors are the largest available compressors, offer higher efficiencies under partial loads, may be oil-free when using air or magnetic bearings which increases the heat transfer coefficient in evaporators and condensers, weigh up to 90% less and occupy 50% less space than reciprocating compressors, are reliable and cost less to maintain since less components are exposed to wear, and only generate minimal vibration. But, their initial cost is higher, require highly precise CNC machining, the impeller needs to rotate at high speeds making small compressors impractical, and surging becomes more likely. Surging is gas flow reversal, meaning that the gas goes from the discharge to the suction side, which can cause serious damage, specially in the compressor bearings and its drive shaft. It is caused by a pressure on the discharge side that is higher than the output pressure of the compressor. This can cause gases to flow back and forth between the compressor and whatever is connected to its discharge line, causing oscillations.

====Diagonal or mixed-flow compressors====
Diagonal or mixed-flow compressors are similar to centrifugal compressors, but have a radial and axial velocity component at the exit from the rotor. The diffuser is often used to turn diagonal flow to an axial rather than radial direction. Comparative to the conventional centrifugal compressor (of the same stage pressure ratio), the value of the speed of the mixed flow compressor is 1.5 times larger.

====Axial compressors====
Axial compressors are dynamic rotating compressors that use arrays of fan-like airfoils to progressively compress a fluid. They are used where high flow rates or a compact design are required.

The arrays of airfoils are set in rows, usually as pairs: one rotating and one stationary. The rotating airfoils, also known as blades or &quot;rotors&quot;, accelerate the fluid. The stationary airfoils, also known as &quot;stators&quot; or vanes, decelerate and redirect the flow direction of the fluid, preparing it for the rotor blades of the next stage. Axial compressors are almost always multi-staged, with the cross-sectional area of the gas passage diminishing along the compressor to maintain an optimum axial Mach number. Beyond about 5 stages or a 4:1 design pressure ratio a compressor will not function unless fitted with features such as stationary vanes with variable angles (known as variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators), the ability to allow some air to escape part-way along the compressor (known as interstage bleed) and being split into more than one rotating assembly (known as twin spools, for example).

Axial compressors can have high efficiencies; around 90% polytropic at their design conditions. However, they are relatively expensive, requiring a large number of components, tight tolerances and high quality materials. Axial compressors are used in medium to large gas turbine engines, natural gas pumping stations, and some chemical plants.

=== Hermetically sealed, open, or semi-hermetic===
Compressors used in refrigeration systems must exhibit near-zero leakage to avoid the loss of the refrigerant if they are to function for years without service. This necessitates the use of very effective seals, or even the elimination of all seals and openings to form a hermetic system. These compressors are often described as being either hermetic, open, or semi-hermetic, to describe how the compressor is enclosed and how the motor drive is situated in relation to the gas or vapor being compressed. Some compressors outside of refrigeration service may also be hermetically sealed to some extent, typically when handling toxic, polluting, or expensive gasses, with most non-refrigeration applications being in the petrochemical industry.

In hermetic and most semi-hermetic compressors, the compressor and motor driving the compressor are integrated, and operate within the pressurized gas envelope of the system. The motor is designed to operate in, and be cooled by, the refrigerant gas being compressed. Open compressors have an external motor driving a shaft that passes through the body of the compressor and rely on rotary seals around the shaft to retain the internal pressure.

The difference between the hermetic and semi-hermetic, is that the hermetic uses a one-piece welded steel casing that cannot be opened for repair; if the hermetic fails it is simply replaced with an entire new unit. A semi-hermetic uses a large cast metal shell with gasketed covers with screws that can be opened to replace motor and compressor components. The primary advantage of a hermetic and semi-hermetic is that there is no route for the gas to leak out of the system. The main advantages of open compressors is that they can be driven by any motive power source, allowing the most appropriate motor to be selected for the application, or even non-electric power sources such as an internal combustion engine or steam turbine, and secondly the motor of an open compressor can be serviced without opening any part of the refrigerant system.

An open pressurized system such as an automobile air conditioner can be more susceptible to leak its operating gases. Open systems rely on lubricant in the system to splash on pump components and seals. If it is not operated frequently enough, the lubricant on the seals slowly evaporates, and then the seals begin to leak until the system is no longer functional and must be recharged. By comparison, a hermetic or semi-hermetic system can sit unused for years, and can usually be started up again at any time without requiring maintenance or experiencing any loss of system pressure. Even well lubricated seals will leak a small amount of gas over time, particularly if the refrigeration gasses are soluble in the lubricating oil, but if the seals are well manufactured and maintained this loss is very low.

The disadvantage of hermetic compressors is that the motor drive cannot be repaired or maintained, and the entire compressor must be replaced if a motor fails. A further disadvantage is that burnt-out windings can contaminate the whole systems, thereby requiring the system to be entirely pumped down and the gas replaced (This can also happen in semi hermetic compressors where the motor operates in the refrigerant). Typically, hermetic compressors are used in low-cost factory-assembled consumer goods where the cost of repair and labor is high compared to the value of the device, and it would be more economical to just purchase a new device or compressor. Semi-hermetic compressors are used in mid-sized to large refrigeration and air conditioning systems, where it is cheaper to repair and/or refurbish the compressor compared to the price of a new one. A hermetic compressor is simpler and cheaper to build than a semi-hermetic or open compressor.

==Thermodynamics of gas compression==

===Isentropic compressor===
A compressor can be idealized as internally reversible and adiabatic, thus an isentropic steady state device, meaning the change in entropy is 0. 

The enthalpy change for a flow process can be calculated.

dH = VdP +TdS

Isentropic dS is zero.

dH = VdP

Non flow isentropic processes like some positive displacement compressors may use a different equation.

dH = PdV 

By defining the compression cycle as isentropic, an ideal efficiency for the process can be attained, and the ideal compressor performance can be compared to the actual performance of the machine. Isotropic Compression as used in ASME PTC 10 Code refers to a reversible, adiabatic compression process

Isentropic efficiency of Compressors:
: formula_1

: formula_2 is the enthalpy at the initial state
: formula_3 is the enthalpy at the final state for the actual process
: formula_4 is the enthalpy at the final state for the isentropic process

===Minimizing work required by a compressor===

====Comparing reversible to irreversible compressors====

Comparison of the differential form of the energy balance for each device.

Let formula_5 be heat, formula_6 be work, formula_7 be kinetic energy, and formula_8 be potential energy.

Actual Compressor:
: formula_9
Furthermore, formula_10 and T is [absolute temperature] (formula_11) which produces:formula_12

orformula_13

Therefore, work-consuming devices such as pumps and compressors (work is negative) require less work when they operate reversibly.

====Effect of cooling during the compression process====
isentropic process: involves no cooling,
polytropic process: involves some cooling
isothermal process: involves maximum cooling

By making the following assumptions the required work for the compressor to compress a gas from formula_14 to formula_15 is the following for each process:




: formula_14 and formula_15

: Flow processes VdP
: All processes are internally reversible
: The gas behaves like an ideal gas with constant specific heats

Isentropic (formula_18, where formula_19):

: formula_20

Polytropic (formula_21):

: formula_22

Isothermal (formula_23 or formula_24):

:formula_25

By comparing the three internally reversible processes compressing an ideal gas from formula_14 to formula_15, the results show that isentropic compression (formula_18) requires the most work in and the isothermal compression(formula_23 or formula_24) requires the least amount of work in. For the polytropic process (formula_21) work decreases as the exponent, n, decreases, by increasing the heat rejection during the compression process. One common way of cooling the gas during compression is to use cooling jackets around the casing of the compressor.

===Compressors in ideal thermodynamic cycles===
Ideal Rankine Cycle 1-&gt;2 Isentropic compression in a pump

Ideal Carnot Cycle 4-&gt;1 Isentropic compression

Ideal Otto Cycle 1-&gt;2 Isentropic compression

Ideal Diesel Cycle 1-&gt;2 Isentropic compression

Ideal Brayton Cycle 1-&gt;2 Isentropic compression in a compressor

Ideal Vapor-compression refrigeration Cycle 1-&gt;2 Isentropic compression in a compressor

NOTE: The isentropic assumptions are only applicable with ideal cycles. Real world cycles have inherent losses due to inefficient compressors and turbines. The real world system are not truly isentropic but are rather idealized as isentropic for calculation purposes.

==Temperature==

Compression of a gas increases its temperature.

For a polytropic transformation of a gas:

: formula_32

The work done for polytropic compression (or expansion) of a gas into a closed cylinder.
: formula_33

: formula_34

so
: formula_35

in which &quot;p&quot; is pressure, &quot;V&quot; is volume, &quot;n&quot; takes different values for different compression processes (see below), and 1 &amp; 2 refer to initial and final states.
* Adiabatic – This model assumes that no energy (heat) is transferred to or from the gas during the compression, and all supplied work is added to the internal energy of the gas, resulting in increases of temperature and pressure. Theoretical temperature rise is:
: formula_36
with &quot;T&quot;1 and &quot;T&quot;2 in degrees Rankine or kelvins, &quot;p&quot;2 and &quot;p&quot;1 being absolute pressures and formula_37 ratio of specific heats (approximately 1.4 for air). The rise in air and temperature ratio means compression does not follow a simple pressure to volume ratio. This is less efficient, but quick. Adiabatic compression or expansion more closely model real life when a compressor has good insulation, a large gas volume, or a short time scale (i.e., a high power level). In practice there will always be a certain amount of heat flow out of the compressed gas. Thus, making a perfect adiabatic compressor would require perfect heat insulation of all parts of the machine. For example, even a bicycle tire pump&#x27;s metal tube becomes hot as you compress the air to fill a tire. The relation between temperature and compression ratio described above means that the value of formula_38 for an adiabatic process is formula_39 (the ratio of specific heats).
* Isothermal – This model assumes that the compressed gas remains at a constant temperature throughout the compression or expansion process. In this cycle, internal energy is removed from the system as heat at the same rate that it is added by the mechanical work of compression. Isothermal compression or expansion more closely models real life when the compressor has a large heat exchanging surface, a small gas volume, or a long time scale (i.e., a small power level). Compressors that utilize inter-stage cooling between compression stages come closest to achieving perfect isothermal compression. However, with practical devices perfect isothermal compression is not attainable. For example, unless you have an infinite number of compression stages with corresponding intercoolers, you will never achieve perfect isothermal compression.

For an isothermal process, formula_38 is 1, so the value of the work integral for an isothermal process is:
: formula_41

When evaluated, the isothermal work is found to be lower than the adiabatic work.
* Polytropic – This model takes into account both a rise in temperature in the gas as well as some loss of energy (heat) to the compressor&#x27;s components. This assumes that heat may enter or leave the system, and that input shaft work can appear as both increased pressure (usually useful work) and increased temperature above adiabatic (usually losses due to cycle efficiency). Compression efficiency is then the ratio of temperature rise at theoretical 100 percent (adiabatic) vs. actual (polytropic). Polytropic compression will use a value of formula_38 between 0 (a constant-pressure process) and infinity (a constant volume process). For the typical case where an effort is made to cool the gas compressed by an approximately adiabatic process, the value of formula_38 will be between 1 and formula_39.

==Staged compression==
In the case of centrifugal compressors, commercial designs currently do not exceed a compression ratio of more than 3.5 to 1 in any one stage (for a typical gas). Since compression raises the temperature, the compressed gas is to be cooled between stages making the compression less adiabatic and more isothermal. The inter-stage coolers (intercoolers) typically result in some partial condensation that is removed in vapor–liquid separators.

In the case of small reciprocating compressors, the compressor flywheel may drive a cooling fan that directs ambient air across the intercooler of a two or more stage compressor.

Because rotary screw compressors can make use of cooling lubricant to reduce the temperature rise from compression, they very often exceed a 9 to 1 compression ratio. For instance, in a typical diving compressor the air is compressed in three stages. If each stage has a compression ratio of 7 to 1, the compressor can output 343 times atmospheric pressure (7 × 7 × 7 = 343 atmospheres). ()

==Drive motors==
There are many options for the motor that powers the compressor:
* Gas turbines power the axial and centrifugal flow compressors that are part of jet engines.
* Steam turbines or water turbines are possible for large compressors.
* Electric motors are cheap and quiet for static compressors. Small motors suitable for domestic electrical supplies use single-phase alternating current. Larger motors can only be used where an industrial electrical three phase alternating current supply is available.
* Diesel engines or petrol engines are suitable for portable compressors and support compressors. 
* In automobiles and other types of vehicles (including piston-powered airplanes, boats, trucks, etc.), diesel or gasoline engine&#x27;s power output can be increased by compressing the intake air, so that more fuel can be burned per cycle. These engines can power compressors using their own crankshaft power (this setup known as a supercharger), or, use their exhaust gas to drive a turbine connected to the compressor (this setup known as a turbocharger).

==Lubrication==
Compressors that are driven by an electric motor can be controlled using a VFD or power inverter, however many hermetic and semi-hermetic compressors can only work in a range of or at fixed speeds, since they may include built-in oil pumps. The built-in oil pump is connected to the same shaft that drives the compressor, and forces oil into the compressor and motor bearings. At low speeds, insufficient quantities of oil reach the bearings, eventually leading to bearing failure, while at high speeds, excessive amounts of oil may be lost from the bearings and compressor and potentially into the discharge line due to splashing. Eventually the oil runs out and the bearings are left unlubricated, leading to failure, and the oil may contaminate the refrigerant, air or other working gas.

==Applications==
Gas compressors are used in various applications where either higher pressures or lower volumes of gas are needed:
* In pipeline transport of purified natural gas from the production site to the consumer, a compressor is driven by a motor fueled by gas bled from the pipeline. Thus, no external power source is necessary.
* In maritime cargo transport and cargo operations by gas carriers.
* Petroleum refineries, natural gas processing plants, petrochemical and chemical plants, and similar large industrial plants require compressing for intermediate and end-product gases.
* Refrigeration and air conditioner equipment use compressors to move heat in refrigerant cycles (see &quot;vapor-compression refrigeration&quot;).
* Gas turbine systems compress the intake combustion air.
* Small-volume purified or manufactured gases require compression to fill high pressure cylinders for medical, welding, and other uses.
* Various industrial, manufacturing, and building processes require compressed air to power pneumatic tools.
* In the manufacturing and blow moulding of PET plastic bottles and containers.
* Some aircraft require compressors to maintain cabin pressurization at altitude.
* Some types of jet engines—such as turbojets and turbofans—compress the air required for fuel combustion. The jet engine&#x27;s turbines power the combustion air compressor.
* In underwater diving, self-contained breathing apparatus, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and other life support equipment, compressors provide pressurised breathing gas either directly or via high pressure gas storage containers, such as diving cylinders. In surface supplied diving, an air compressor is generally used to supply low pressure air (10 to 20 bar) for breathing.
* Submarines use compressors to store air for later use in displacing water from buoyancy chambers to adjust buoyancy.
* Turbochargers and superchargers are compressors that increase internal combustion engine performance by increasing the mass flow of air inside the cylinder, so the engine can burn more fuel and hence produce more power.
* Rail and heavy road transport vehicles use compressed air to operate rail vehicle or road vehicle brakes—and various other systems (doors, windscreen wipers, engine, gearbox control, etc.).
* Service stations and auto repair shops use compressed air to fill pneumatic tires and power pneumatic tools.
* Fire pistons and heat pumps exist to heat air or other gasses, and compressing the gas is only a means to that end.
* Rotary lobe compressors are often used to provide air in pneumatic conveying lines for powder or solids. Pressure reached can range from 0.5 to 2 bar g.

<text>Ahmad Tavakkoli (; born 5 March 1951) is an Iranian conservative and principlist politician, journalist. He is currently member of the Expediency Discernment Council. Also he is currently managing-director of &quot;Alef&quot; news website and founder of the corruption watchdog, non-governmental organization &quot;Justice and Transparency Watch&quot;.

Tavakkoli is the former representative of Tehran, Rey, Shemiranat and Eslamshahr electoral district in the parliament and the director of Majlis Research Center.

==Career==
Tavakkoli was the minister of labour under Mir-Hossein Mousavi, a parliament representative from Behshahr, and a presidential candidate in two of the presidential elections in Iran (running against Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami).

Tavakkoli temporarily left politics after the leftists oppositions forced him out of the ministry of labour. He founded &quot;Resalat&quot;, a conservative newspaper, and later left Iran to study economics in the UK, where he received his PhD.

===Views and personal life===
Tavakkoli is a critic of a capitalist economy, and backs the government&#x27;s role in controlling the economy. He is a cousin of the Larijani brothers, including Ali Larijani and Mohammad Javad Larijani.

Tavakkoli was also a fierce critic of President Ahmadinejad. On 2 March 2011, the PBS&#x27; Tehran Bureau reported that Tavakkoli criticized the then President for mentioning only Iran and not Islam in recent speeches.

<text>The Coronation Tap is a ciderhouse, a pub that specialises in serving cider, in the Clifton suburb of the English city of Bristol.

The Coronation Tap, or Cori to regulars, has existed under that name for at least two hundred years. It is at least thirty years older than the Clifton Suspension Bridge and was described in 1806 as &quot;a beerhouse with cottage adjoining&quot;.

The most popular drink is the strong &quot;Exhibition Cider&quot;, served in half pints. The pub is popular with students within the city.

<text>Phalaenopsis (), also known as moth orchids, is a genus of about seventy species of plants in the family Orchidaceae. Orchids in this genus are monopodial epiphytes or lithophytes with long, coarse roots, short, leafy stems and long-lasting, flat flowers arranged in a flowering stem that often branches near the end. Orchids in this genus are native to Asia, New Guinea, and Australia, but mostly occur in Indonesia and the Philippines.

==Description==


Orchids in the genus &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; are monopodial epiphytic, sometimes lithophytic herbs with long, coarse roots with pneumatodes (which allow for gaseous exchange of the photosynthetic roots), and short leafy stems hidden by overlapping leaf bases. The leaves are usually arranged in two rows, relatively large and leathery, oblong to elliptic and sometimes succulent. A few to many, small to large, long-lasting, flat, often fragrant flowers are arranged on erect to hanging racemes or panicles. The sepals and petals are free from and spread widely apart from each other. The sepals are usually larger than the sepal and the petals much wider than the sepals. The labellum is joined stiffly to the column and has three lobes. The side lobes are erect and more or less parallel to each other and the middle lobe sometimes has a pair of appendages or antennae.

=== Reproduction ===
Unlike most other angiosperms, the development of the ovules is triggered by pollination. Therefore a temporal mismatch of male and female gametes exists (i.e. the male structures are ready but the female structures have not yet been fully developed). In orchids, fertilisation occurs within days or months after the pollination event. After pollination occurs, the stigmatic cavity is often closed through swelling of the column. As a result, the pollinia are completely enclosed. The pollen germinates after enclosure and tubes are produced. In &quot;Phalaenopsis aphrodite&quot;, pollen tubes entered the ovary within 3 days after pollination. Within 15 days, pollen tubes evenly spread throughout the placental cavities. Within 60 days after the pollination event, 30.6% of the tips of the pollen tubes started to enter the micropyles (i.e. entry points) of the ovules. Finally, 65 to 70 days after the pollination event, fertilisation occurred.

&quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; are unique in that in some species of the subgenus &quot;Polychilos&quot;, the flowers turn into green leaves after pollination. As in many other plants, the petals of the orchid flowers serve to attract pollinating insects and protect essential organs. Following pollination, petals usually will undergo senescence (i.e. wilt and disintegrate) because it is metabolically expensive to maintain them. However, in many &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; species, such as &quot;P. violacea&quot;, the petals and sepals find new uses following pollination, thus escaping programmed cell death. In producing chloroplasts, they turn green, become fleshy, and start to photosynthesize, as leaves do.

=== Phytochemistry ===
Floral fragrance has been analysed for several species. The fragrance of &quot;Phalaenopsis bellina&quot; has been shown to be composed of about 79 compounds, primarily of the terpenoid class. It was most intense in the morning.

In &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot;, phenylpropanoid enzymes are enhanced in the process of plant acclimatisation at different levels of photosynthetic photon flux.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; was first formally described in 1825 by Carl Ludwig Blume and the description was published in . The name &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek word () meaning &#x27;a kind of moth&#x27; with the &quot;-opsis&quot; meaning &#x27;having the appearance of&#x27; or &#x27;like&#x27;.

The genus name is abbreviated &quot;Phal.&quot; horticulturally.

===Infrageneric structure===
The large monophyletic genus &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; is divided into several sub-units. They are either regarded as subgenera or as sections. Not all of them are monophyletic.
The subgenus &quot;Polychilos&quot; is monophyletic and it is divided into two subclades. The subgenus &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; is paraphyletic under its current definition. Likewise the evidence shows that the subgenera &quot;Aphyllae&quot; and &quot;Parishianae&quot;, as currently defined, are not monophyletic. The position of the monotypic subgenus &quot;Proboscidioides&quot;, which only consists of &quot;Phalaenopsis lowii&quot;, suggests a close relationship with the subgenus &quot;Aphyllae&quot;.

The following phylogenetic tree is a simplified tree to show the general placement of the main infrageneric groups. It is meant to give an overview, despite the contended monophyly of some of the respective groups.
===&quot;Ornithochilus&quot;===

The former genus &quot;Ornithochilus&quot; was merged with &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; and is considered by some to be a subgenus. Its members have distinctly 4-lobed, fringed labella with a short, curved spur situated near the middle of the lip as opposed to the base. &quot;Ornithochilus&quot; formerly had three known species, native to China, the Himalayas and Southeast Asia:

*&quot;Ornithochilus cacharensis&quot; - Assam
*&quot;Ornithochilus difformis&quot; - Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Assam, India, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Borneo, Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia 
*&quot;Ornithochilus yingjiangensis&quot; - Yunnan

===&quot;Hygrochilus&quot;===

The former genera &quot;Sedirea&quot; and &quot;Hygrochilus&quot; were incorporated into &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; subgen. &quot;Hygrochilus&quot;. The interspecific relationships within the subgenus &quot;Hygrochilus&quot; are poorly understood and are a source of confusion. The type species of the subgenus is &quot;Phalaenopsis hygrochila&quot;. The species of this subgenus are morphologically distinct from the other subgenera, due to their four pollinia and spurred flowers, as well as their unusually long stems.

===Species list===
See List of &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; species

===Intergeneric hybrids===
See List of &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; species

== Distribution ==
Species of &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; are found from India to southern China, Indochina, Malaysia and from Indonesia to the Philippines and New Guinea. There is a single species, &quot;Phalaenopsis rosenstromii,&quot; endemic to Queensland, Australia. &quot;Phalaenopsis stuartiana&quot; has become naturalised in Costa Rica, Panama, and Suriname.

== Ecology ==
Pollination of &quot;Phalaenopsis pulcherrima&quot; through bees, specifically &quot;Amegilla nigritar&quot;, has been recorded in China. This species employs a deceptive pollination strategy. The orchid does not provide rewards to pollinators. It benefits from blooming in the same period as rewarding species. &quot;Amegilla&quot; is the most important pollinator, but diurnal insects – such as four species of bees, two species of butterflies, one species of moth and two other unidentified insects – have also been observed to interact with the flowers.

== Conservation ==
Many species are highly threatened. For instance &quot;Phalaenopsis lindenii&quot; is categorized as endangered, &quot;Phalaenopsis violacea&quot; is categorized as vulnerable and &quot;Phalaenopsis micholitzii&quot; is categorized as critically endangered. Some species, like &quot;P. javanica,&quot; are believed to be extinct in the wild.

==Use in horticulture==
&quot;Phalaenopsis&quot;, abbreviated Phal in the horticultural trade, are among the most popular orchids sold as potted plants, owing to the ease of propagation and flowering under artificial conditions. They were among the first tropical orchids in Victorian collections. Since the advent of the tetraploid hybrid &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; Doris, they have become extremely easy to grow and flower in the home, as long as some care is taken to provide them with conditions that approximate their native habitats. Their commercial production has become an industry.

If very healthy, a &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; plant may have up to ten or more leaves. They bloom in their full glory for several weeks. If kept in the home, the flowers may last two to three months after which a &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; orchid will need to conserve energy for further leaf, bud, and root development.

In nature, &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; species are typically fond of warm temperatures, thriving in temperatures around 20 to 35 °C (68–95 °F), but are adaptable to conditions more comfortable for human habitation in temperate zones (15 to 30 °C or 59–86 °F); at temperatures below 18 °C (64.4 °F) overwatering causes root rot and the plants will also drop their leaves if they experience temperatures below 60 °F for extended periods. &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; prefer moderate humidity (60–70%) and low light of 12,000 to 20,000 lux. However, Phalaenopsis orchids can adapt to the lower humidity found in most homes. They are also typically hardier than other species of orchids, and this makes them particularly popular among first-time orchid growers.

The flower spikes appear from the pockets near the base of each leaf. The first sign is a light green &quot;mitten-like&quot; object that protrudes from the basal leaf tissue. Over approximately three months the spike elongates until it begins to swell fat buds that will bloom.

It previously was believed that flowering is triggered by a night-time drop in temperature of around 5 to 6 degrees over two to four consecutive weeks, usually in the fall, and a day-time drop in temperature to below . Using two &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; clones, Matthew G. Blanchard and Erik S. Runkle (2006) established that, other culture conditions being optimal, flower initiation is controlled by daytime temperatures declining below , with a definite inhibition of flowering at temperatures exceeding . The long-held belief that reduced evening temperatures control flower initiation in &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; was shown to be false. Rather, lower daytime temperatures influence flowering, while night time temperatures do not appear to have any effect.

<doc id="508521" wikidata="Q836770" url="?curid=508521" title="Gloster Javelin">
<text>The Gloster Javelin is a twin-engined all-weather interceptor aircraft designed and produced by the Gloster Aircraft Company. It was operated by the Royal Air Force from the mid-1950s until the late 1960s and was the final aircraft design to bear the Gloster name.

The Javelin was designed in response to specification F.44/46 during the late 1940s and early 1950s as high-performance night fighter capable of all-weather operations. In terms of its basic configuration, it was a T-tailed delta-wing aircraft powered by a pair of Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire turbojet engines. Following a protracted development period, the Javelin was introduced to squadron service during 1956. Throughout its service life, the aircraft received several upgrades, which were typically focused upon its engines, radar and weapons, including support for the De Havilland Firestreak air-to-air missile.

The Javelin was succeeded in the interceptor role by the English Electric Lightning, a supersonic aircraft capable of flying at more than double the Javelin&#x27;s top speed, which was introduced into the RAF only a few years following the former&#x27;s introduction. Several variants were proposed, including fighter bomber and aerial reconnaissance-oriented models, as well as the supersonic-capable Gloster thin-wing Javelin; however, these were not pursued. The Javelin had a relatively short service life, the last examples were withdrawn from operational service in 1968 following the introduction of successively more capable versions of the Lightning.

==Development==

===F.44/46===
In the aftermath of the Second World War, Britain identified a threat posed by the jet-powered strategic bomber and atomic weaponry and thus placed a great emphasis on developing aerial supremacy through continuing to advance its fighter technology, even following the end of the conflict. Initial planning was based on the premise that another war was at least ten years away, and development was limited mostly to paper projects. Several events in the late 1940s led to this timeline being moved up.

In 1947, the Air Ministry issued a requirement for a high-performance night fighter under specification F.44/46. It called for a two-seat design that would intercept enemy aircraft at heights of up to at least 40,000 feet. It would also have to reach a maximum speed of 525 kn (973 km/h, 605 mph) at this height, be able to perform rapid ascents and attain an altitude of 45,000 feet within ten minutes of engine ignition.

Additional criteria given in the requirement included a minimum flight endurance of two hours, a takeoff distance of 1,500 yards, structural strength to support up to 4g manoeuvres at high speed and for the aircraft to incorporate aircraft interception radar, multi-channel VHF radio and various navigational aids. The aircraft would also be required to be economical to produce, at a rate of ten per month for an estimated total of 150 aircraft.

===Gloster designs===
Gloster Aircraft developed and produced the only British jet aircraft to be operational during the war, the Gloster Meteor. Through the post-war period, they produced a series of updated versions of the Meteor, including some with delta wing layouts for all or the outer portion of the wings. These were further developed by moving the engines to the fuselage and using a complete delta wing layout, leading to a second series of designs that continued in parallel.

P.228, drawn up in 1946, was essentially a two-seat Meteor with slightly swept wings. A similar design was also offered to the Royal Navy as the P.231. The later-issued P.234 and P.238 of early 1947 had adopted many of the features that would be distinctive of the Javelin, including the large delta wing and tailplane, and were based on the Rolls-Royce AJ65 engine (better known as Avon). The two differed primarily in role; P.234 was a single-seat day fighter with a V-tail, while P.238 was a two-seat night fighter with a mid-mounted delta tailplane.

Development of both concepts continued. P.240 of April 1947 was Meteor-like in form but moved the engines from the wings to the fuselage, and added a slight sweep to the leading edge of the wing, producing a somewhat delta wing shape. P.240 also replaced the Rolls-Royce Derwent engines with the Metrovick F.9, which would later move companies and become the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire. The all-delta layout of P.238 was also updated as P.241, which used an all-delta horizontal stabilizer in a T-tail arrangement. P.241 bears a strong resemblance to the final Javelin design.

The Air Ministry released more detailed specifications on 17 Jun 1949, as F.4/48. Gloster responded with two further updated designs, P.300, which was essentially a quick update to the Meteor with two seats and newer Derwent engines, and the P.316/P.317, another update to the delta layout mounting the Sapphire engines. The P.316 and 317 differed primarily in role, 316 was a single-seat design lacking radar and mounting up to four bombs in containers under the fuselage, while 317 was a two-seat design with radar and some form of heavy armament to be determined.

The RAF requirements were subject to some changes, mainly in regards to radar equipment and armaments; Gloster also initiated some changes as further research was conducted into the aerodynamic properties of the new swept and delta wings, as well as use of the new Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire turbojet engine.

===Prototypes===

On 13 April 1949, the Ministry of Supply issued instructions to two aircraft manufacturers, Gloster and de Havilland, to each construct four airworthy prototypes of their competing designs to meet the requirement, as well as one airframe each for structural testing. These prototype aircraft were the Gloster GA.5, designed by Richard Walker, and the de Havilland DH.110, the latter of which held the advantage of also being under consideration for the Royal Navy. Development was considerably delayed through political cost-cutting measures, the number of prototypes being trimmed down to an unworkable level of two each before the decision was entirely reversed; this led to the unusual situation where the first production Javelin was completed before the prototype order being fulfilled.

The first prototype was completed in 1951. An unusual feature of the prototypes was the opaque canopy over the rear cockpit. It had been believed that visibility outside the cockpit was unnecessary and a hindrance to the observer; the only external view available was through 2 small &#x27;portholes&#x27;. Following a month of ground testing, on 26 November 1951, the first prototype conducted its first flight at Moreton Valence airfield. Bill Waterton, Gloster&#x27;s Chief Test Pilot, would later describe the Javelin as being &quot;as easy to fly as an Anson&quot;, although also expressing concern over its inadequate power controls. Disaster nearly struck during one test flight when aerodynamic flutter caused the elevators to detach in mid-flight; despite the lack of control surfaces, Bill Waterton was able to land the aircraft using tailplane trimming and engine thrust for pitch control. He was awarded the George Medal for his actions to retrieve flight data from the burning aircraft.

The second prototype (WD808) received a modified wing in 1953. After initial testing by Waterton, it was passed to another Gloster test pilot, Peter Lawrence for his opinion. On 11 June 1953, the aircraft crashed during testing. Lawrence had ejected from the aircraft, but too late (at about ), and was killed. The Javelin had experienced a &quot;deep stall&quot;; the wing acting like an airbrake had killed forward motion and at the same time degraded the airflow over the elevators, leaving them useless. Without elevator control, Lawrence was unable to regain control and the aircraft dropped from the sky. A stall warning device was later developed and implemented for the Javelin.

The third prototype (&quot;WT827&quot;), and the first to be fitted with operational equipment including radar, first flew on 7 March 1953. The fourth prototype (&quot;WT830)&quot; was passed to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&amp;AEE) for trials and the fifth prototype, &quot;WT836&quot;, made its first flight in July 1954. On 4 July 1954, a prototype Javelin accidentally achieved supersonic speed during a test flight, the pilot having been distracted by an oxygen supply failure.

===Production and further development===
The official production order for the Javelin was issued in mid-1953; as the Gloster Meteor was still being actively produced by Gloster, considerable elements of the Javelin were subcontracted out to other aviation companies owned by the Hawker Siddeley Group, such as Armstrong Whitworth. While some delays were incurred, the Javelin&#x27;s status as a &quot;super priority&quot; for production helped to minimize the time involved in producing each aircraft. On 22 July 1954, XA544, the first production aircraft, took flight at Hucclecote. Production was assisted by a large order placed by the United States Air Force, purchasing aircraft for the RAF as part of the Mutual Defense Aid Program at a price of £36.8 million.

On 21 October 1954, a pilot attached to Gloster from RAE Farnborough was killed while flying Javelin &quot;XA546&quot; having entered what appeared to be an intentional spin. On 8 December 1955, a service test pilot S/L Dick was testing &quot;XA561&quot; for the A&amp;AEE when the aircraft entered a flat spin at during manoeuvres testing the buffet boundary, which the anti-spin parachute could not stop, and he chose to eject at . Following this, a stall-warning device was developed for the Javelin.

By the end of 1956, the Javelin was up to a FAW 7 variant, which was the first to meet the specifications of the original Air Ministry requirement, and which was to become the definitive version of the aircraft (most of which were later altered to the FAW 9 standard). The Javelin was evolving so quickly that deliveries of the FAW 8 began before FAW 7 production had ended. As a result, the final 80 FAW 7 aircraft went straight from the factory into storage, eventually flying after being re-manufactured as FAW 9s. A total of 427 Javelins were produced in all variants, plus seven prototypes. While there had been considerable interest from several NATO air forces, there were no export orders for the Javelin.

==Design==

The Javelin was the RAF&#x27;s first purpose-built all-weather interceptor aircraft. Aerodynamic features of the type included its adoption of the new delta wing and a large tailplane. Fuel and armaments were housed in the delta wing, and the engines and crew in the fuselage. The delta wing and tailplane combination had been deemed necessary by Gloster for effective manoeuvrability at high speed and for the aircraft to be controllable at low landing speeds. In one instance during testing, when both elevators had been torn off by elevator flutter, the Javelin remained controllable by using both the trimming capability of the large tailplane and thrust changes to control pitch. Changes from the prototypes included alterations to the rear fuselage and a central &quot;pen nib&quot; fairing extending beyond the engine nozzles, to eliminate buffeting of the rudder by the jet exhaust and increased sweepback of the wing&#x27;s leading edge to improve high-speed handling.

The Javelin was reportedly easy to fly even on one engine. The flight controls were fully power-assisted and production aircraft adopted a hydraulic &#x27;feel&#x27; system for the pilot. The Javelin featured an infinitely variable airbrake; the airbrake proved to be extremely responsive and effective, allowing pilots to conduct rapid descents and heavy braking manoeuvres, enabling equally rapid landings to be performed. The turnaround time between sorties was significantly shorter than with the preceding Gloster Meteor, due to improved ground accessibility and engine ignition sequence. Unlike the Meteor, the Javelin was fitted with ejector seats, at the introduction to service of the type. No other operational fighter of the West even to the present day had a bigger wing, in terms of area, than the Javelin, and in the USSR, only the Tu-128 had a larger (about 10m2) wing.

In spite of the aircraft&#x27;s unorthodox aerodynamic features, the Javelin had a fairly conventional structure and materials, being mainly composed of an aluminium alloy, with some use of steel edging. The fuselage was composed of four sections, the nose (containing the radar radome), the front fuselage, centre fuselage and rear fuselage; the nose and rear fuselage were removable for servicing and easy replacement. The engines were on either side of the centre fuselage, the internal space in the centre containing the service bay that housed much of the aircraft&#x27;s electrical, hydraulic, and avionics subsystems. The engine air intakes were placed on the forward fuselage, running directly from beneath the cockpit rearwards into the delta wing. Electricity was provided by a pair of 6,000 watt, 24-volt generators driven by the auxiliary gearbox; inverters provided AC power for equipment such as some flight instruments and the radar.

== Variants ==
A total of 435 aircraft were built by Gloster (302 built) and Armstrong-Whitworth (133 built); both companies at that time were part of the Hawker Siddeley group. Several were converted to different marks (sometimes repeatedly).
;Gloster GA.5
:Five prototypes GA.5s were built by Gloster, the first order for four aircraft to Specification F.4/48 was placed by the Air Ministry on 17 Jun 1949. Subsequently two aircraft were cancelled but additional prototype aircraft were ordered in 1951:
* WD804 - Unarmed first prototype with Sapphire Sa.3 engines first flown from Moreton Valance on 26 November 1951.
* WD808 - Unarmed second prototype first flew on 21 August 1952.
* WT827 - First flew 7 March 1953 it was the first armed aircraft and the first fitted with a radar.
* WT830 - First aircraft with powered controls, first flew 14 January 1954. Used for aerodynamic and stress trials.
* WT836 - Production standard aircraft with improved canopy. first flew 20 July 1954
;FAW 1
: Initial version with Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire Sa.6 engines with 8,000 lbf (35.6 kN thrust) each, British AI.17 radar, four 30 mm ADEN cannon in wings, and electrically operated tail plane;. The designation FAW 1, sometimes written FAW.1 or F(AW) Mk 1, stood for &quot;Fighter, All-Weather Mark 1&quot;. First flown on 25 July 1954, forty aircraft were built at Hucclecote, mainly used for trials and the first aircraft to be delivered to 46 Squadron at RAF Odiham.
;FAW 2
: Replaced the AI.17 radar with U.S.-made Westinghouse AN/APQ-43 radar (known as the AI.22 in RAF service), hydraulically operated tail; 30 produced.
;T 3
: Dual-control trainer version with no radar, bulged canopy for improved instructor visibility. All-moving tailplane, lengthened fuselage to compensate for altered centre of gravity, adding additional internal fuel. Retained four cannon; 22 production aircraft and one prototype.
;FAW 4
: Similar to FAW 1, with the addition of vortex generators on wings for improved stall characteristics, as well as an all-moving tailplane. Fitted with the original AI.17 radar of the FAW.1. 50 produced.
;FAW 5
: Based on FAW 4, with revised wing structure incorporating additional fuel tanks, provision for missile pylons (never fitted); 64 produced.
;FAW 6
: Combined FAW 2&#x27;s American radar with the revised wing of the FAW.5. 33 produced. Snub nosed with AI.22 radar installed.
;FAW 7
: Introduced new Sa.7 engines with 11,000 lbf (48.9 kN) thrust each, powered rudder, extended rear fuselage. Armed with two 30 mm ADEN plus four Firestreak air-to-air missiles. FAW 7s equipping two squadrons were armed with four ADEN cannon only; 142 produced. AI.17 radar installed.
;FAW 8
: Upgraded Sa.7R engines with reheat, raising thrust to 12,300 lbf (54.7 kN) thrust above 20,000 ft (6,100 m); at lower altitudes, the limitation of the fuel pump caused a loss of cold thrust. New &quot;drooped&quot; wing leading edge and auto-stabiliser for better handling. Snub nosed with AI.22 radar installed.
;FAW 9
: A total of 118 FAW 7s refitted with the revised wing and engines with reheat, of the Mk 8., 44 of these were fitted with refuelling probes as FAW 9F/R. AI.17 radar installed.
;FAW 9R
:R standing for &quot;Range&quot;. A total of 40 of the 44 FAW 9F/R were refitted to carry underwing fuel tanks.

==Unproduced variants==

Several variants were proposed and investigated but not produced, including aerial reconnaissance versions, a fighter bomber version with underwing panniers for bombs, and a supersonic variant with area-ruled fuselage, thinner wings, and a new tail. The &quot;thin-wing Javelin&quot; would have been capable of about Mach 1.6, with a higher ceiling than contemporary US designs. Initial work started with fitting a thinner-section wing to a Javelin fuselage but as the project developed the changes became so great that it would effectively have been a different aircraft albeit having an outward resemblance to the Javelin. The Gloster P.370 to F.153D for &quot;Thin Wing Gloster All Weather Fighter, an update of the initial F.118 specification was ordered in 1954; a prototype &quot;XG336&quot; along with two pre-production aircraft. The final incarnation of the thin-wing Gloster (P.376) just before cancellation was a large aircraft carrying two Red Dean all-aspect missiles as a possible contender for Operational Requirement F.155. Both the aircraft, then under construction, and the missile were cancelled in 1957.

<doc id="508522" wikidata="Q325027" url="?curid=508522" title="Richard Doyle (illustrator)">
<text>Richard &quot;Dickie&quot; Doyle (18 September 1824 – 10 December 1883) was a British illustrator of the Victorian era. His work frequently appeared, amongst other places, in &quot;Punch magazine&quot;; he drew the cover of the first issue, and designed the magazine&#x27;s masthead, a design that was used for over a century.

==Biography==
Born at 17 Cambridge Terrace, London, one of seven children of Irish cartoonist John Doyle (known as &#x27;H.B&#x27;), a noted political caricaturist, Doyle had three brothers, James, Charles and Henry Edward Doyle, who were also artists. The young Doyle had no formal art training other than his father&#x27;s studio, but from an early age displayed a gifted ability to depict scenes of the fantastic and grotesque. Throughout his life he was fascinated by fairy tales. He produced his first complete illustrated book, &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot;, when he was twelve; it was published posthumously in 1887.

He joined the staff of &quot;Punch&quot; in 1843 aged 19, remaining there for seven years.

He was the uncle of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes stories.

==Career==
Doyle&#x27;s first published illustrations appeared in &quot;The Eglinton Tournament&quot; (1840), a humour book set in the Middle Ages, which met with commercial success.

Doyle collaborated with John Leech, W. C. Stanfield and other artists to co-illustrate three Charles Dickens Christmas books, &quot;The Chimes&quot; (1844), &quot;The Cricket on the Hearth&quot; (1845) and &quot;The Battle of Life&quot; (1846).

In 1846 Doyle&#x27;s illustrations for &quot;The Fairy Ring&quot; (a new translation of Grimm&#x27;s tales), first made his name as a fairytale illustrator. Following this in 1849 he produced &quot;Fairy Tales from All Nations&quot; (compiled by &#x27;Anthony R. Montalba&#x27;, which proved a tremendous success. Doyle was able to fully explore his love of fairy mythology with his many illustrations and borders filled with elves, pixies and other mythical creatures.

Following this success Doyle illustrated a string of fantasy titles: &quot;The Enchanted Doll&quot; by Mark Lemon (1849), &quot;The Story of Jack and the Giants&quot; (1850), and John Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;The King of the Golden River&quot; (1850), which went through three editions in its first year of publication.

Edward Ellice was a serial host for notable visitors to Scotland. In 1859 Doyle was invited and Katherine Ellice, an amateur artist, served as host when he visited. Katherine was given an illustrated diary of a journey to the islands of Rona and Skye and this is extant.

He also wrote for &quot;Punch&quot; a series of articles entitled &quot;Manners and Customes of ye Englyshe&quot;. A devout Roman Catholic, he resigned his position on the staff of &quot;Punch&quot; in 1850 in response to its hostility to what was termed &quot;papal aggression&quot;, and spent the remainder of his career in preparing drawings for book illustration and to painting in watercolour. Doyle published works of his own, which helped establish his reputation with a large readership: &quot;Manners and Customs of Ye Englishe&quot; (1849) and &quot;Bird&#x27;s Eye View of Society&quot; (1864).

His chief series of illustrations were those for &quot;The Newcomes&quot;, &quot;The King of the Golden River&quot;, and &quot;The Foreign Tour of Brown, Jones and Robinson&quot;. In 1844, Doyle designed the cover of Punch&#x27;s sixth issue. It became the basis of the magazine&#x27;s masthead until 1954, and was based on Titian&#x27;s &quot;Bacchus and Ariadne&quot;.

His masterpiece is indubitably &quot;In Fairyland, a series of Pictures from the Elf World&quot;, with a poem by William Allingham, printed by Edmund Evans and published by Longman in time for Christmas 1869 (dated 1870). In the 16 colour plates and 36 line illustrations plus title page, Doyle was given a completely free hand. The folio was richly bound in green cloth, and has been described as one of the finest examples of Victorian book production (Richard Dalby, &quot;The Golden Age of Children&#x27;s Book Illustration&quot;, 1991 p. 12). The illustrations were used in the publication of another book as well, &quot;The Princess Nobody&quot; by Andrew Lang (1884).

Doyle was generally regarded as being brilliant but unreliable. For example, he was consistently late with his illustrations for &quot;The Newcomes&quot;, only meeting his commitments when Thackeray threatened to give the work to another artist. Doyle&#x27;s excuses were often ridiculous, and the Dalziel brothers reported that on one occasion he failed to meet a deadline because he had &#x27;not got any pencils&#x27;. Such amateurism hampered Doyle&#x27;s success. Several books he had been commissioned to illustrate did not appear because he lacked the application needed to finish them, and completed work was often uneven in quality and &#x27;deplorably pedestrian&#x27;.

Doyle signed many of his drawings with the depiction of a small bird standing on the initials &#x27;RD&#x27;, a reference to his nickname &quot;Dickie&quot; (as in &quot;dickie bird&quot;).

<text>Annecy ( , ; , also ) is the prefecture and largest city of the Haute-Savoie department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of Southeastern France. It lies on the northern tip of Lake Annecy, south of Geneva, Switzerland. 

Nicknamed the &quot;Pearl of the French Alps&quot; in Raoul Blanchard&#x27;s monograph describing its location between lake and mountains, the town controls the northern entrance to the lake gorge. Due to a lack of available building land between the lake and the protected Semnoz mountain, its population has remained stable, around 50,000 inhabitants, since 1950. However, the 2017 merger with several ex-communes extended the population of the city to 128,199 inhabitants and that of the urban area to 177,622, placing Annecy seventh in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region.

Switching from the counts of Geneva&#x27;s dwelling in the 13th century, to the counts of Savoy&#x27;s in the 14th century, the city became Savoy&#x27;s capital in 1434 during the Genevois-Nemours prerogative until 1659. Its role increased in 1536, during the Calvinist Reformation in Geneva, while the bishop took refuge in Annecy. Saint Francis de Sales gave Annecy its advanced Catholic citadel role known as Counter-Reformation. The annexation of Savoy merged the city to France in 1860. 

Sometimes called &quot;Venice of the Alps&quot;, this idyllic and touristic representation comes from the three canals and the Thiou river, which passes through the old city. The city experienced an industrial development in the 19th century with silk manufacturing. Some of its industrial legacy remains today with the headquarters of NTN-SNR bearings, Salomon, Entremont and Dassault Aviation.

From the end of the 19th century, Annecy developed tourism around its lake summer facilities, winter resorts proximity and cultural attraction with its castle renovation and fine art museum opening in 1956 and the Animated Film Festival since 1963, hosted in Bonlieu&#x27;s cultural centre. The municipal environmental policy managed to keep 40.3% of green spaces, and the city was awarded the &quot;Golden Flower&quot; in 2015, given to the nine most-flowered French cities.

==History==
===Early history===

Le vieil Annecy (&quot;Old Annecy&quot;; not to be confused with Annecy-le-Vieux, formerly a neighboring town but now merged into Annecy), was a settlement from the time of the Romans. Annecy was the court of the counts of Geneva or Genevois from the 10th century. It passed to the counts of Savoy in 1401. In 1444, it became the regional capital of the provinces of Genevois, Faucigny and Beaufortain.

===Counter-Reformation===
With the advance of Calvinism, Annecy became a centre for the Counter-Reformation, the old Bishopric of Geneva being transferred to it in 1535. Francis of Sales was born in Sales, France in 1567 and served as bishop of Annecy from 1602 to 1622; his relics are preserved in the cathedral. During the French Revolution, the Savoy region was conquered by France. Annecy became attached to the department of Mont Blanc, whose capital was Chambéry. The Catholic diocese was suppressed in 1801.

===1815–present===
After the Bourbon Restoration in 1815, Annecy was returned to the King of Sardinia and the Catholic diocese restored in 1822. The Hôtel de Ville (city hall) was completed in 1851.

When Savoy was annexed to France in 1860 with the Treaty of Turin, it became the capital of the new department of Haute-Savoie. Annecy was the site of the second round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks in 1949. In 2012, a multiple murder occurred in the Annecy area.

The new municipality was established on 1 January 2017 by merger with the former communes of Annecy-le-Vieux, Cran-Gevrier, Meythet, Pringy and Seynod.

==Administration==
Annecy is part of four cantons (Annecy-1, Annecy-2, Annecy-3 and Annecy-4); it is the prefecture of Haute-Savoie.

Since 2017, Annecy has consisted of six delegate cities: Annecy; Annecy-le-Vieux; Cran-Gevrier; Meythet; Pringy; and Seynod. Local government consists of a city council with 202 members. The number of members in each commune delegate depends upon its population. The Mayor is Jean-Luc Rigaut (UDI) since 2007.

The intercommunality of Annecy, Communauté d&#x27;agglomération du Grand Annecy, includes 34 municipalities.

==Geography==

The Fier forms part of the commune&#x27;s northwestern border. The surrounding mountains are Mont Veyrier, Mont Semnoz, La Tournette and Parmelan.

===Climate===
Annecy has an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb) despite its relatively far inland position. Influenced by its elevation, summers are rather moderate on average, although they can be highly variable with extreme heat spikes. Winters see occasional freezing temperatures, but temperatures most often stay in the single-digits during the daytime with frequent cold rain. Air frosts are normal during the night and snowfall is not uncommon.

==Culture==
Annecy has hosted the Annecy International Animated Film Festival since 1960 and the Rencontres Internationales d&#x27;Annecy Cinéma &amp; Architecture since 1999 and it was one of the oldest festivals in France.

==Sport==
On 23 July 2009, Annecy played host to Stage 18 of the Tour de France, as the start/finish point for an individual time trial around Lake Annecy. It was also the start town for stage 10 of the 2018 Tour de France on 17 July 2018.

Annecy launched a bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics but lost to Pyeongchang. If they had been chosen, Annecy would have been the fourth French city to host the Winter Olympic Games, after Chamonix (1924), Grenoble (1968), and Albertville (1992).

Ligue 1 former team Évian Thonon Gaillard F.C. played their home matches in Annecy. The club was founded in 2007, they grew up to reach Ligue 1, and stayed for four years in the division, thanks to their emblematic trainer Pascal Dupraz.

The Annecy basin is one of the world&#x27;s leading locations for the sport of paragliding, an activity of some economic importance to the region. The area regularly hosts major competitions, most recently a leg of the Paragliding World Cup in 2012. Due to its proximity with the lake and the mountains, Annecy is also popular for watersports (sailing, rowing, wakeboarding, water skiing) and wintersports (alpine skiing, snowboarding, Nordic skiing). Le Semnoz, a relatively small ski resort is 35 minutes away from Annecy. Other bigger ski resorts, La Clusaz and Le Grand Bornand, are only 40 minutes away. Annecy is also very popular among trail runners and many races are organized year round, such as the World Trail Running Championships in 2015.

==Early life==
Amber Tamblyn is the daughter of singer/artist Bonnie Tamblyn and actor Russ Tamblyn. Her paternal grandfather, Eddie Tamblyn, was a vaudeville performer. Her uncle is Larry Tamblyn, who is the keyboardist in the 1960s rock band The Standells. She attended the Santa Monica Alternative School House, which, in her words, was &quot;very unorthodox, no letter grades&quot;. At the age of ten, she played Pippi Longstocking in a school play; her father&#x27;s agent, Sharon Debord, was attending as a family friend and ended up convincing her father to allow Tamblyn to go on auditions.

==Career==
===Television===

Tamblyn&#x27;s first TV role was Emily Bowen (later known as Emily Quartermaine) on the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;, a role that she played for six years (from 1995 to 2001). She also starred in &quot;Evergreen&quot;, the pilot episode of the second &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; revival in 2002. Tamblyn became better known playing Joan Girardi, a teenage girl who receives frequent visits from God, on the CBS drama series &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot;. Tamblyn&#x27;s father made several appearances as God in the form of a dog walker on the show, which ran from 2003 to 2005.

Early guest-starring roles include: &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (playing Janice Penshaw, the best friend of Michelle Trachtenberg&#x27;s character Dawn Summers), &quot;Boston Public&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot;, where Ashton Kutcher and his crew members tricked her into losing someone else&#x27;s dog. In 2007, she starred in the CBS pilot for &quot;Babylon Fields&quot;, an apocalyptic comedic drama about the undead trying to resume their former lives. The CBS network excluded the show from its fall programming lineup, since it would have competed with the network&#x27;s other undead-themed drama, &quot;Moonlight&quot;.

In spring 2009, Tamblyn starred in &quot;The Unusuals&quot;, as NYPD homicide detective Casey Shraeger. The show was canceled after its first season. In the same year, she had a recurring role alongside her eventual husband David Cross in the IFC sitcom &quot;The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret&quot;.

From November 2010 until April 2011, she starred as medical student Martha M. Masters in the seventh season of the Fox medical drama series &quot;House&quot;. She returned for the series finale in 2012.

In August 2013, Tamblyn was cast as Charlie Harper (Charlie Sheen)&#x27;s long-lost (and previously unknown) lesbian daughter, Jenny Harper, on the sitcom &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, opposite Ashton Kutcher and Jon Cryer. Her first appearance was on the season 11 opener, September 26, 2013.

She has appeared on numerous episodes of Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Inside Amy Schumer&quot;, including the &quot;Milk Milk Lemonade&quot; sketch which aired in 2015. She has also guest starred on IFC&#x27;s &quot;Portlandia&quot; and &quot;Comedy Bang! Bang!&quot;, as well as numerous shows on Adult Swim, including &quot;The Heart, She Holler&quot; opposite Patton Oswalt and &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;.

Tamblyn launched her film career playing bit parts in her father&#x27;s movies: &quot;Rebellious&quot; and &quot;Johnny Mysto: Boy Wizard&quot;. She also appeared in 1995&#x27;s &quot;Live Nude Girls&quot;. Her first major film role was in 2005&#x27;s &quot;The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants&quot; as Tibby Rollins, co-starring Alexis Bledel, America Ferrera, and Blake Lively. She reprised the role in the 2008 sequel, &quot;The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2&quot;.

Her horror film career began with the opening scene of 2002&#x27;s &quot;The Ring&quot;. Tamblyn also appeared in the Japan-set &quot;The Grudge 2&quot;. The film, which also stars Sarah Michelle Gellar, was released on October 13, 2006, and debuted in the #1 spot at the North American box office. In August 2010, she won the Bronze Leopard at the Locarno International Film Festival for her performance in the title role of &quot;Stephanie Daley&quot;. The film, which also won an award at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival, features Tamblyn as a 16-year-old who kills her baby moments after giving birth in the bathroom of a ski resort. She was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the 22nd Independent Spirit Awards. The film also stars Tilda Swinton and Timothy Hutton.

In January 2008, Tamblyn appeared in the Hallmark film &quot;The Russell Girl&quot;, as Sarah Russell, a woman suffering from disease and mental anguish. Also in 2008, she starred in &quot;Blackout&quot;. She appeared in the 2009 film &quot;Spring Breakdown&quot;, also featuring Amy Poehler, Rachel Dratch, and Parker Posey. Tamblyn appeared alongside Orlando Bloom, Colin Firth, and Patricia Clarkson in the 2010 film &quot;Main Street&quot;, a drama set in North Carolina. That year, she also had a role in the drama &quot;127 Hours&quot;, with James Franco.

In 2012, Tamblyn starred alongside Wes Bentley and Vincent Piazza in the indie feature &quot;3 Nights in the Desert&quot; directed by Gabriel Cowan, written by playwright Adam Chanzit and produced by John Suits.

===Writings===

In 2005, Simon &amp; Schuster Children&#x27;s Publishing published her debut book of poems, written between the ages of 11 and 21, entitled &quot;Free Stallion&quot;. The &quot;School Library Journal&quot;″s review states that, &quot;&quot;Free Stallion&quot; is a compilation of poetry that amounts to a portrait of the artist as a teenager... Many of the selections are appropriately self-absorbed but move beyond journalistic catharsis to real insight and stunning language for one so young.&quot; Poet Laureate Lawrence Ferlinghetti called the book, &quot;A fine, fruitful gestation of throbbingly nascent sexuality, awakened in young new language.&quot; In 2008, she was featured in the Write Bloody Publishing anthology, &quot;The Last American Valentine: Illustrated Poems to Seduce and Destroy&quot;.

In 2009, Manic D. Press published her second collection of poetry, &quot;Bang Ditto&quot;.

In 2015, HarperCollins published her third collection, a hybrid of poetry and art called &quot;Dark Sparkler&quot; which explored the lives and deaths of child star actresses. The book was a large critical success and bestseller, which features accompanying original art from Marilyn Manson, David Lynch, Marcel Dazma, Adrian Tomine, and many others. For the book&#x27;s publication launch in 2015, Tamblyn and the band Yo La Tengo created an hour long poetry and music show incorporating poems from Tamblyn&#x27;s book. They performed the show in New York at Housing Works and in Los Angeles at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

In 2019, Penguin Random House published &quot;Era of Ignition; Coming of Age in a Time of Rage and Revolution&quot;, a collection of her cultural criticism and memoir essays. The book is a personal exploration of feminism during divisive times.

Tamblyn has self-published two chapbooks of poetry, &quot;Of the Dawn&quot; and &quot;Plenty of Ships&quot;, and has participated in poetry readings at various venues, particularly in California. &quot;The Loneliest&quot;, a poem book inspired by Thelonious Monk and his music, was published in 2005 and contains haiku poetry written by Tamblyn and coupled with collages by George Herms.

Tamblyn appeared in a poetry concert film recorded on August 4, 2002, in Los Angeles, &quot;The Drums Inside Your Chest&quot;. Beginning in October 2009, she began blogging for the Poetry Foundation&#x27;s blog, &quot;Harriet&quot;. Her poem &quot;Bridgette Anderson&quot; was one of the poems featured in Saul Williams&#x27; book &quot;Chorus&quot;, published by MTV Books in September 2011.

In 2007, she co-founded Write Now Poetry Society, dedicated to creating unique and quality poetry programming. The non-profit has a long history with The Getty Museum, curating poetry events in conjunction with art openings, such as 2011&#x27;s &quot;Dark Blushing&quot;, featuring new poems commissioned by poets Patricia Smith and NEA fellow Jeffrey McDaniel, based on works of art by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Blake. Since 2011, Tamblyn has reviewed books of poetry by women for iconic feminist magazine, &quot;BUST Magazine&quot;.

=== James Woods allegation and Hasidic incident ===

In a series of September 2017 tweets later reiterated in an open letter published in &quot;Teen Vogue&quot;, she said that actor James Woods tried to seduce her and a friend at a restaurant and offered to take them to Las Vegas when both Tamblyn and her friend were 16. Woods denied her allegations, calling them a &quot;lie&quot;. Tamblyn later wrote an essay for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in which she said that Woods&#x27;s &quot;accusation that I was lying sent me back to that day in that producer&#x27;s office, and back to all the days I&#x27;ve spent in the offices of men; of feeling unsure, uneasy, questioned and disbelieved, no matter the conversation.&quot;

In March 2018, Tamblyn came under criticism for tweets about New York City&#x27;s Hasidic Jewish community following an incident in Brooklyn involving her daughter. Tamblyn said she was nearly struck by a van driven by a Hasidic Jewish man while walking with her daughter in a stroller. She said &quot;this is not the first time a man from the Hasidic community in NYC has attempted to harm me or other women I know. Any woman riding a bike through South Williamsburg can attest. I hope this guy is caught.&quot; Writing in &quot;Tablet&quot;, journalist Liel Leibovitz chided Tamblyn for &quot;speaking so hurtfully about an entire community of underprivileged people&quot;. Tamblyn denied accusations of anti-Semitism.

==Personal life==

Tamblyn and actor-comedian David Cross became engaged in August 2011, and married on October 6, 2012. On February 21, 2017, Tamblyn announced that she and Cross had recently had a daughter.

She is sometimes said to be the goddaughter of musician Neil Young and actors Dean Stockwell and Dennis Hopper, although in a 2009 interview with &quot;Parade&quot;, Tamblyn explained that &quot;godfather&quot; was &quot;just a loose term&quot; for Stockwell, Hopper and Young, three famous friends of her father&#x27;s who were always around the house when she was growing up, and who were big influences on her life.

She was the writing mentee of the late San Francisco Poet Laureate Jack Hirschman. 

=== Politics ===
Tamblyn supported and campaigned for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 United States presidential election. On social media, Tamblyn urged voters to check voter ID requirements citing VoteRiders as a source of assistance across the United States.

She is one of the founders of the non-profit organization Time&#x27;s Up, which was created to combat workplace sexual harassment. She is also a feminist.

In October 2023, Tamblyn signed the Artists4Ceasefire open letter to Joe Biden, President of the United States, calling for a ceasefire between Israel and Gaza.

===Relationship with parents===
In June 2021, Tamblyn wrote an essay in &quot;The New York Times&quot; expressing solidarity with Britney Spears&#x27;s effort to end the conservatorship controlling her life. Tamblyn wrote that she became financially successful when she turned 21 and starred in &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot; after which her father became her co-manager, and her mother her business manager. She wrote that having her parents on the payroll damaged their relationship, and that her money &quot;paid for our vacations, dinners out, and sometimes even the bills. When it finally came time to disentangle our personal and professional relationships, it was deeply painful for all three of us&quot; but noted she, unlike Spears, &quot;had a healthy and loving relationship with my parents, for the most part&quot; and her parents &quot;were supportive and ethical in every way&quot;. When the &quot;circle of those I supported opened up to include extended family members and friends. I was the one they came to for a small loan or in an emergency, the one who always picked up the check&quot;, &quot;using money to make people happy, or fix problems, or appease my guilt&quot;, she recounted that she felt like &quot;everybody&#x27;s ATM: a bank that was, nonetheless, unconditionally loved&quot;.

<text>Henry Hussey Vivian, 1st Baron Swansea (6 July 1821 – 28 November 1894), known between May 1882 and June 1893 as Sir Hussey Vivian, 1st Baronet, was a Welsh industrialist and politician from the Vivian family.

==Biography==

Born at Singleton Abbey, Swansea, Henry was the eldest son of industrialist and MP John Henry Vivian and his wife Sarah, daughter of Arthur Jones, of Reigate. His younger brothers were Arthur Vivian (who would become an industrialist and MP), Glynn Vivian (afterwards an art collector and philanthropist) and Graham Vivian. His uncle was Richard Hussey Vivian, first baron Vivian. He was educated at Eton and studied metallurgy in Germany and France from 1838 before entering Trinity College, Cambridge in 1839.

After two years he became manager of the Liverpool branch of the copper-smelting business founded by his grandfather, Vivian &amp; Sons. Three years later he became a partner of the firm before coming to Swansea to manage the Hafod Works during the last ten years of his father&#x27;s life (1845–1855). He developed a range of by-products from copper-smelting and diversified into other metallurgical activities. He is credited with originating the &quot;sliding scale&quot; of miners&#x27; wages after the strike of 1889, though other authorities attribute the idea to William Thomas Lewis, afterwards Lord Merthyr. He was one of the chief promoters of the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway, helped to further extend the harbour facilities of the town and championed the merits of Welsh coal in Parliamentary debates. It was largely due to his efforts that Swansea became a major industrial centre.

He served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Truro (1852–57), Glamorganshire (1857–1885), and Swansea District, 1885–1893. 

In 1889, he became the first chairman of the Glamorgan County Council. He was also a Justice of the Peace, Deputy Lieutenant for Glamorgan and for some years first Lieutenant-Colonel of the 4th Glamorgan Rifle Volunteers.

He was created a baronet of Singleton, in the Parish of Swansea in the County of Glamorgan, on 13 May 1882, and Baron Swansea, of Singleton in the County of Glamorgan, on 9 June 1893.

After his death on 28 November 1894, probate was granted to his sons Henry Hussey Vivian and Odo Richard Vivian valuing his estate at £163,707 1s 9d, he was buried in the churchyard of St Paul&#x27;s Church in Sketty. There is a bronze statue of Henry wearing a frock coat and gown in St. David&#x27;s Shopping Centre, Swansea, created by Italian sculptor Mario Raggi. There is also a plaque at St John&#x27;s Church in Hafod. It was erected by his widow and contains the words &#x27;Life&#x27;s race well run. Life&#x27;s work well done. Life&#x27;s crown well won. Then comes rest&#x27;.

Lord Swansea&#x27;s younger brother Sir Arthur Vivian was also a Liberal politician.

==Marriages and children==
Lord Swansea married, on 15 April 1847, to Jessie Dalrymple Goddard (c. 1825 – 28 February 1848), the daughter of Ambrose Goddard, of the Lawn, Swindon. His wife died of childbed fever a few weeks after the birth of their only child.

* The Hon. John Aubrey Vivian (23 July 1854 – 1 March 1898); died unmarried

Lord Swansea took as his third wife, on 10 November 1870, Averil Beaumont (1841 – 14 January 1934), daughter of Capt. Richard Beaumont, R.N., and granddaughter of the 3rd Baron Macdonald of Slate. He and his third wife had seven children;

<text>The Library of Congress&#x27;s Center for the Book was founded in 1977 by Daniel J. Boorstin, the Librarian of Congress, to promote literacy, libraries, and reading and an understanding of the history and heritage of American literature. The Center for the Book is mainly supported by tax-deductible donations. 

==History==
In 1977, Librarian of Congress Dr. Daniel J. Boorstin founded the Library of Congress&#x27;s Center for the Book, which was established by Congress in public law 95-129 to promote books, reading, literacy and libraries, as well as the scholarly study of books. Dr. Boorstin appointed Dr. John Y. Cole to the position of founding director of the Center for the Book. Cole had previously served as the chairman of the one-year task force on library goals, organization and planning that had recommended a Center for the Book to Dr. Boorstin. 

In 1984 the center began to establish state affiliate Centers for the Book. Center for the Book Affiliates carry out the national Center’s mission, sponsor programs that highlight their area’s local literary heritage and call attention to the importance of books, reading, libraries and literacy. Today there are affiliate centers in all 50 states, American Samoa, the District of Columbia, Guam, Northern Marianas, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

==Leadership==

Dr. John Y. Cole was the founding director of the Center for the Book in 1977. He is the author of &quot;Jefferson’s Legacy: A Brief History of the Library of Congress&quot; (1993) and &quot;On These Walls: Inscriptions and Quotations in the Library of Congress&quot; (1995), among other books focusing on the history of the Library of Congress. 

The role that John Cole and the Center for the Book played in promoting the study of the history of the book was documented in a bibliographic essay, “The Center for the Book and the History of the Book” that covered the time period 1977-1999. Cole&#x27;s work at the Center for the Book was honored in a special issue of &quot;Libraries &amp; the Cultural Record&quot; 

Cole retired as Director of the Center for the Book in 2016 and was appointed Library of Congress Historian where he served from 2016-2021.

Pam Jackson was director of the Center for the Book from 2016 to 2018. John Van Oudenaren was director in 2018. 

Guy Lamolinara, is the current director. He is the author of “The National and International Roles of the Center for the Book.”

The Library of Congress National Book Festival, established in 2001 by Laura Bush and James H. Billington, is an annual event in which the Center for the Book plays a major role. The festival was previously held on the National Mall for two days in the fall. Authors are invited to give readings, sign books, give lectures and do interviews. Representatives from across the country are also invited to promote their states’ literary heritage.

Every year since 2002, the Library affiliates each choose a book to celebrate at the Book Festival in the Library’s Roadmap to Reading.
Lists of &quot;Great Reads from Great Places&quot; since 2002 are available at the Center for the Book website.

=== Letters About Literature ===

Letters About Literature was a national contest created by the Center for the Book that encouraged literacy in grades 4–12. The contest asked students to read a work of either prose or poetry and write to its author (living or dead), explaining how what they read affected them. Contestants competed in one of three age groups: Level I: grades 4–6; Level II: grades 7–8; Level III: grades 9–12. Letters were initially screened through two rounds of judges, who were individuals with knowledge of children’s literature. The best letters moved on to state competitions, and those winners moved on to a national competition hosted by the Library of Congress. Judging began in March for state competitions, and national winners were announced in May. The final competition was held during the 2018/19 school year.

=== River of Words ===

The Center for the Book and St. Mary&#x27;s College Center for Environmental Literacy partner in presenting River of Words, the largest youth poetry and art competition in the world. Founded in 1995 under former Poet Laureate Robert Hass, the contest is free to all contestants. The contest asks students ages 5–19 to examine a watershed in their environment and reflect on what it means to them. They must then express their reflection through poetry or art. In 2011 the Center for the Book co-sponsored a concert in which acclaimed composer Libby Larsen set some of the winning poems to music. Every year the contest receives tens of thousands of submissions. The contest is particularly popular with Scout troops and other organizations with an emphasis on the outdoors.

=== Young Readers Center ===
The Young Readers Center was opened in the Library of Congress&#x27;s Thomas Jefferson Building in 2009 to provide a place for children 16 years and younger accompanied by an adult to access reading materials and other literary resources and to attend programs, such as a weekly story hour.

=== Literacy Awards ===
The Center for the Book began managing the Library of Congress Literacy Awards after their creation was announced at the 2012 International Summit for the Book. Created and sponsored by philanthropist David M. Rubenstein, the awards support organizations that perform innovative work in increasing literacy levels. Totaling $250,000, the three annual awards are given to organizations that have made significant progress in advancing the promotion of literacy in the United States and beyond: the David M. Rubenstein Prize ($150,000), the American Prize ($50,000), and the International Prize ($50,000).

The award winners and honorees are announced at the annual Library of Congress National Book Festival, and list is available at the Library of Congress website.

=== National Collegiate Book Collecting Contest ===
The National Collegiate Book Collecting Contest was started in 2005 by &quot;Fine Books &amp; Collections&quot; magazine to recognize extraordinary book collections of college students. After three years of running the competition, the magazine turned it over to the Library of Congress. More than 35 colleges and universities hold book-collecting contests. The winners of those contests are encouraged to enter the national competition. Student book collectors whose schools do not offer a competition may also apply to the national contest.

=== Library of Congress Poetry &amp; Literature Center ===
The Center for the Book administers the Library of Congress Poetry &amp; Literature Center, which serves as the Office of the U.S. Poet Laureate. The Poetry &amp; Literature Center organizes a yearly program of readings, performances, conferences and lectures. The center oversees the prestigious biannual Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry. The prize is awarded to the most distinguished American book of poetry published in the two years before the award is given. The center also grants the esteemed Witter Bynner Fellowship. Started in 1998, the Poetry &amp; Literature Center awards these fellowships to two up-and-coming poets.

=== National Ambassador for Young People’s Literature ===

Sponsored by the Center for the Book and the Children’s Book Council, the National Ambassador for Young People’s Literature serves to promote youth literacy and the valuable attributes it develops, such as lifelong literacy, education and the growth and enhancement of the lives of young people. The ambassador is appointed by a select group of individuals who work in the youth literature field. Four individuals have held the positions since its creation in 2008: Jon Scieszka, Katherine Paterson, Walter Dean Myers, Kate DiCamillo, and current ambassador Gene Luen Yang.

<text>A diving air compressor is a breathing air compressor that can provide breathing air directly to a surface-supplied diver, or fill diving cylinders with high-pressure air pure enough to be used as a hyperbaric breathing gas. A low pressure diving air compressor usually has a delivery pressure of up to 30 bar, which is regulated to suit the depth of the dive. A high pressure diving compressor has a delivery pressure which is usually over 150 bar, and is commonly between 200 and 300 bar. The pressure is limited by an overpressure valve which may be adjustable.

Most high pressure diving air compressors are oil-lubricated multi-stage piston compressors with inter-stage cooling and condensation traps. Low pressure compressors may be single or two-stage, and may use other mechanisms besides reciprocating pistons. When the inlet pressure is above ambient pressure the machine is known as a gas booster pump.

The output air must usually be filtered to control purity to a level appropriate for breathing gas at the relevant diving depth. Breathing gas purity standards are published to ensure that the gas is safe. It may also be necessary to filter the intake air, to remove particulates, and in some environments it may be necessary to remove carbon dioxide, using a scrubber. The quality of the inlet air is critical to the quality of the product as many types of impurity are impracticable to remove after compression. Condensed water vapour is usually removed between stages after cooling the compressed air to improve efficiency of compression.

High pressure compressors may be set up with large storage cylinders and a filling panel for portable cylinders, and may be associated with gas blending equipment. Low pressure diving compressors usually supply compressed air to a gas distribution panel via a volume tank, which helps compensate for fluctuations in supply and demand. Air from the gas panel is supplied to the diver through the diver&#x27;s umbilical.

== Machinery ==
High pressure diving compressors are generally three- or four-stage-reciprocating air compressors that are lubricated with a high-grade mineral or synthetic compressor oil free of toxic additives (a few use ceramic-lined cylinders with O-rings, not piston rings, requiring no lubrication). Oil-lubricated compressors must only use lubricants specified by the compressor&#x27;s manufacturer as suitable for use with breathing air. Special filters are used to clean the air of most residual oil and water (see &quot;Air purity&quot;).

Smaller compressors are often splash lubricated - the oil is splashed around in the crankcase by the impact of the crankshaft and connecting rods - but larger compressors are likely to have pressurized lubrication using an oil pump which supplies the oil to critical areas through pipes and passages in the castings. Most oil lubricated compressors will have a wet sump at the bottom of the crankcase, and require the oil level to be within limits indicated by a sight glass or dipstick for proper lubrication. The compressor should also be level within the manufacturer&#x27;s specification while operating. These constraints ensure that the lubricant is in the right place for either the moving parts to contact it for splash lubrication, or for reliable suction to the oil pump. Failure to comply with these specifications can lead to damage to the compressor due to excessive friction and overheating, and contamination of the breathing air by toxic breakdown products of the lubricants.

The compression process helps remove water from the gas, making it dry, which is good for reducing corrosion in diving cylinders and freezing of diving regulators, but contributes towards dehydration, a factor in decompression sickness, in divers who breathe the gas.

Low pressure diving compressors are usually single stage compressors as the delivery pressure is relatively low.

== Air purity ==

The compressed air output by the compressor must be filtered to make it fit for use as a breathing gas. Periodically, the air produced by a compressor must be tested to ensure it meets air purity standards. Frequency of testing, contaminants that must be analysed, and the allowable limits vary between applications and jurisdictions. The following impurities may be checked for:
* Carbon dioxide – 
* Carbon monoxide – A gas that is present in the exhaust gas of internal combustion engines, including those often used to drive compressors. It also comes from the breakdown of lubricating oil when compressors run too hot. Carbon monoxide is odorless, colorless, and tasteless. It is deadly even in small quantities, because it readily binds with the hemoglobin in red blood cells and thus destroys the blood&#x27;s ability to carry oxygen. Breathing air compressors must be carefully designed and placed so that the compressor&#x27;s intake is located in fresh air well away and upstream from any engine exhaust.
* Lubricating-oil vapour – Oil, which must be used to lubricate the compressor&#x27;s internal parts, can be harmful if it contaminates the breathing gas and is inhaled as a mist. Petroleum-based oils cannot be absorbed and metabolized by the body and will coat the internal surfaces of the lungs, causing a condition known as lipoid pneumonia and leading to asphyxiation and death. For this reason, compressors must be carefully designed and maintained to ensure that oil contamination of the breathing gas is within safe limits. Oils used should be approved by the compressor manufacturer and rated as safe for breathing air compressors. A range of mineral based and synthetic oils are supplied by several lubricant manufacturers for this application.
* Total hydrocarbons – 
* Nitrogen dioxide – 
* Odor and taste – 
* Solid particles – 
* Water vapor – Allowable limits for moisture content depend on pressure: Moist air is not harmful to the diver and reduces dehydration, so is acceptable in low pressure breathing air for surface supply in much higher concentration than for storage in high pressure cylinders, where corrosion due to condensation is a problem, and where regulator freezing may occur.

== Filtration ==

Filters remove:
* Solid particles from intake air, using paper filters
* Water, using water separators, silica gel, activated alumina or a molecular sieve
* Oil, using activated carbon or a molecular sieve
* Carbon monoxide, using a catalyst (Hopcalite)
* Carbon dioxide, using a prefilter (scrubber) may be necessary depending on intake air quality.

=== Low pressure filtration ===
The intake air for a high pressure compressor should be clean and have a low carbon dioxide content. Removal of particulate contamination is usually by a paper type dust filter at the first stage intake. Carbon dioxide can be removed by a scrubber if necessary. Clean fresh air does not need to be scrubbed at present, but inner city air may have an excessively high carbon dioxide content, and standard atmospheric air carbon dioxide content is slowly increasing. Carbon dioxide scrubbing requires moisture for the absorbent material to work effectively, and moist air is undesirable for the other filter media, so carbon dioxide scrubbing is often removed by a pre-filter system before the air is compressed.

=== High pressure filtration systems ===

When the air is compressed, the partial pressure of water vapour is proportionately increased. The air is also heated by compression, and when cooled between stages in the inter-cooler coils, the relative humidity increases, and when it exceeds 100% will tend to condense out onto the surface of the tubes and as droplets carried by the air-stream. The air from the inter-cooler coils is led into the large diameter vertical axis tube of a separator, where it changes direction by about 90 degrees and is slowed down considerably. When the airflow changes direction towards the outlet at the top of the separator casing, the denser droplets have a tendency to hit the walls and coalesce into a film, which will flow downwards to the bottom of the separator and collect there where it can be periodically discharged through a drain valve. This reduces the water content of the outlet air, which is then compressed again in the next stage cylinder, cooled again, and the water that condenses out is again removed by the next separator. 

After final stage separation the relatively droplet free but humid air passes through the filter to remove yet more water, and any other contaminants that the filter media will adsorb. The efficiency of dehumidification and filtration depends on significant compression and limited flow velocity, which requires back-pressure at the final stage outlet to resist flow when the filling pressure is low. The back-pressure valve provided in the outlet from the final filter stack affects how effectively the filter works.

The final stage of air treatment is filtration of residual moisture, oil and hydrocarbons, and where necessary catalytic conversion of carbon monoxide. All of these depend on sufficient time in contact with the filter media, known as &quot;dwell time&quot;, so either the filter must have a long air path or the air must flow slowly. Slow air flow is easily achieved by high compression, so filtration works best at or near the working output pressure of the compressor, and this is achieved by the back-pressure valve, which only allows air to flow out of the filter above the set pressure.

The filter system comprises one or more pressure vessels known as filter towers with either prepacked cartridge or loose filter media, a back pressure valve, one or more pressure gauges, and a coalescing separator. After passing through the final intercooler coil the compressed air passes through separators to mechanically remove condensed water and oil droplets, after which other contaminants re removed in the filters by chemical bonding, absorption and catalysis. The first filter medium is desiccant, as water contamination can reduce the effectiveness of some of the other media. Next is the carbon monoxide converting catalyst (if used), then activated carbon, and finally a particulate filter, which will also catch dust from the filter media. The ratio of desiccant to activated carbon will be somewhere around 70/30. 

The ability to remove impurities from the air passing through the filtration media is largely dependent on how long the air remains in contact with the media while passing through the filter stack, known as dwell time. A longer dwell time in the filter is an effective way of increasing contact time, and this is proportional to the pressure of the air in the filter housing. By using a back pressure valve the air always takes approximately the same time to pass through the filter and filtration is consistent (assuming a consistent operating speed). The back-pressure valve is usually set to near the working pressure of the compressor to ensure that the air is compressed sufficiently for the filters to work effectively.

Delivered air should have a dew point lower than the operational temperature of the cylinder, which is generally above 0°C when immersed, but can be colder during transport. Air temperature is also decreased during expansion through the regulator when in use, and when this temperature is low enough for the condensate to freeze, it can lock up the moving parts of the regulator and cause a free flow, known as internal icing. Correct back-pressure also provides relatively even loading of the compressor stages, which reduces vibration caused by imbalance, and extends the compressor service life.

The activated carbon filter medium works best when dry, so it is usually loaded into the filter stack so that the air will first flow through the desiccant media, commonly molecular sieve. Hopcalite catalyst will convert carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide, but requires very dry air—relative humidity must be below 50 per cent—so hopcalite is loaded downstream from the desiccant. A carbon dioxide absorbent may be loaded downstream of the hopcalite.

====Filtration media====
Desiccants are intended to absorb water vapour. Desiccant media used in HP breathing air filters include: activated alumina, silica gel, sorbead, and molecular sieve. Some grades of molecular sieve can absorb up to 23% of its own weight in water, can produce dew points of , and have additional capacities for absorbing hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, and other organics, and function at up to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Manganese dioxide based catalysts (Monoxycon and Hopcalite 300) are used to oxidize carbon monoxide into much less toxic carbon dioxide. This is important if there is a risk of carbon monoxide contamination as it is highly toxic. The air entering the catalyst layer must be dry (dew point of around –50 degrees), as moisture neutralizes the catalyst. After the catalyst, an absorbent can be used to remove the CO2.

Activated carbon absorbs both condensable and gaseous hydrocarbons, and is effective in removing odours, organic compounds, and halogenated solvents. 

==Compressor balance and the backpressure valve==
The last part of the compressor gas circuit is the back-pressure valve. This is a spring-loaded valve that opens to allow flow of air only after the pressure reaches the set pressure. It is usually set to a pressure close to the working pressure of the compressor, and has two basic functions.
Firstly it ensures that after a short starting period, all of the compressor stages are operating at their designed discharge pressures, so that the loads on the pistons are steady and evenly distributed round the crankshaft. This is the loading at which the compressor is balanced at the designed running speed. When the pressure in any cylinder is different from the nominal pressure, the loads will be unbalanced and the compressor will vibrate more than when balanced, and the shaft bearings will be more severely loaded and will wear faster. During start-up the compressor first builds up pressure on the first stage, and is unbalanced, with a greater load on that cylinder&#x27;s piston, and will vibrate more than normal, as there is no equivalent load on the other stage pistons, then pressure in the other stages builds up in sequence, until all cylinders are operating at their working pressures, the loads on all the pistons are similar, and the back-pressure valve starts to open to let the compressed gas flow to the distribution panel.

== Pressure ==


Diving compressors generally fall into one of two categories: those used for surface-supplied diving and those used for filling scuba diving cylinders and surface-supply storage cylinders.

Surface-supplied air diving compressors are low-pressure and high-volume. They supply breathing air directly to a diver, through a gas control panel sometimes called a &quot;rack&quot; via a hose which is usually part of a group of hoses and cables called an &quot;umbilical&quot;. Their output is generally between . These compressors must be sufficiently powerful to deliver gas at a sufficient pressure and volume for multiple divers working at depths of up to about .

Compressors used to fill scuba cylinders have a high delivery pressure and may have a low delivery volume. They are used to fill diving cylinders and storage cylinders or banks of storage cylinders. These compressors may be smaller and less powerful because the volume of gas they deliver is not so critical as it is not directly used by the diver; a lower volume compressor can be used to fill large storage cylinders during the periods when demand is low. This stored compressed air can be decanted into diving cylinders when needed. Common scuba diving cylinder pressures are 200 bar (2940 psi), 3000 psi (207 bar), 232 bar (3400 psi) and 300 bar (4500 psi).

== Heat of compression ==

When diving cylinders are filled the gas inside them warms as a result of adiabatic heating. When the gas cools by losing heat to the surroundings, the pressure will drop as described by the general gas equation and Gay-Lussac&#x27;s law. Divers, to maximise their dive time, generally want their cylinders filled to their safe capacity, the working pressure. To provide the diver with a cylinder filled to the working pressure at the nominal temperature of 15 or 20 °C, the cylinder and gas must be kept cool when filling or filled to a pressure such that when it cools it is at the working pressure. This is known as the developed pressure for the filling temperature. Health and safety regulations and pressure vessel design standards may limit the working temperature of the cylinder, commonly to 65 °C, in which case the cylinder must be filled slowly enough to avoid exceeding the maximum working temperature.
Cylinders are often filled at a rate of less than 1 bar (100 kPa or 15 lbf/in²) per second to allow time for heat transfer to the surroundings to limit this increase in temperature. As a method to remove heat faster when filling the cylinder, some filling stations “wet fill” cylinders immersed in a bath of cold water. There is an increased risk of internal cylinder corrosion caused by moisture from the wet environment entering the cylinder due to contamination during connection of the filling hose during wet filling.

== The bank ==
Compressors may be connected to a bank of large, high-pressure cylinders to store compressed gas, for use at peak times. This allows a cheaper low-powered compressor, which is relatively slow at pumping gas, to fill the bank automatically during idle periods, storing a large volume of pressurized air so that a batch of cylinders can be filled more quickly at peak demand without being delayed by the slow-running compressor. In surface-supplied diving, high-pressure cylinder banks may be used as an emergency backup in case of primary compressor failure, or they may be used as the primary source of breathing gas, a system also known as &quot;Scuba replacement&quot;.

== Filling diving cylinders ==
Cylinders may be filled directly from the compressor outlet, or from a filling manifold, via a flexible high-pressure hose with a filling valve and purge valve known as a filling whip. A pressure gauge is provided to monitor the pressure in the cylinder as it is filled. an overpressure valve or an electrical pressure-switch may be used to limit filling pressure if the compressor is set to a higher pressure than the developed working pressure of the cylinders to be filled.

== Gas blending ==
Compressors may be linked to a gas blending panel to make nitrox, trimix, heliair or heliox mixes. The panel controls the decanting of oxygen and helium from cylinders bought from commercial gas suppliers.

As it is not possible to decant to a diving cylinder from a storage cylinder that holds gas at a lower pressure than the diving cylinder, the expensive gas in low pressure storage cylinders is not easily consumed and may go to waste when the storage cylinder is returned to the supplier. The cascade system may be used with a bank of storage cylinders to economically consume these high cost gases so that the economically maximum gas is used from the bank. This involves filling a diving cylinder by first decanting from the bank cylinder with the lowest pressure that is higher than the diving cylinder&#x27;s pressure and then from the next higher-pressure bank cylinder in succession until the diving cylinder is full. The system maximizes the use of low-pressure bank gas and minimizes the use of high-pressure bank gas.

Another method for scavenging expensive low pressure gases is to pump it with a gas booster pump such as a Haskel pump, or to add it to the intake air of a suitable compressor at atmospheric pressure in a mixer known as a blending stick.

== Operation ==
A diving air compressor operator may be required to be formally certified as competent to operate a diving air compressor and to fill high pressure cylinders. In other jurisdictions the operator may be required to be competent to use the equipment and externally examine cylinders for compliance, but there may be no formal licence or registration required. In yet other jurisdictions there may be no control at all. National and/or state occupational health and safety legislation will usually apply.

There are two basic aspects which may be considered: The health and safety of the operator, who operates hazardous equipment, and is exposed to mechanical and noise hazard from the compressor machinery, high pressure equipment, and cylinders, and the health and safety of the user of the breathing gas, who relies on the compressor operator for quality assurance.

<doc id="508548" wikidata="Q313464" url="?curid=508548" title="Willard Scott">
<text>Willard Herman Scott Jr. (March 7, 1934 – September 4, 2021) was an American weather presenter, radio and television personality, actor, narrator, clown, comedian, and author, whose broadcast career spanned 68 years, 65 years with the NBC broadcast network. Scott was best known as a weather reporter on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show where he also celebrated US centenarian birthdays and notable anniversaries. Scott was the creator and original performer of McDonald&#x27;s mascot clown Ronald McDonald. 

The 6&#x27;3&quot;, 290 lb. (, ) Scott was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a &quot;garrulous, gaptoothed, -wearing, funny-hatted, sometimes toupee-clad, larger-than-life American Everyman&quot;. Scott parlayed his national exposure as weather presenter into a highly successful career as a pitchman who promoted an ever-widening range of products the fees for which outstripped his million-dollar annual salary at NBC (equivalent to $ in ). Scott said, &quot;I run me like a conglomerate, because that&#x27;s what I am. I always keep lots of balls in the air.&quot;

Scott credited his success to his efforts to make everyone, his audience, his clients feel loved. Scott said, &quot;If you watch, you’ll see that I am trying to weave a web of love. I want to make the whole country feel as if we are one. I may be a cornball, but I am me — not a sophisticated, slick New York wazoo act.&quot; Early radio contemporary Johnny Holliday said of Scott, &quot;Everybody he came in contact with just loved the guy. He just had that magic about him, that he made everybody feel special.&quot;

In Scott&#x27;s autobiography &quot;The Joy of Living&quot; he summed his life, saying &quot;If you were to look at my resume, you’d see that I’m ...bald, I’m overweight, I don’t make all the smooth moves and I dress like a slob. I take tremendous pride in the fact that I beat the system.&quot;

==Early life and education==

Scott was born on March 7, 1934, in Alexandria, Virginia, the only child of parents Willard Herman (1905—1977) and Mattie Thelma (née Phillips) Scott (1905—1977). Scott was raised as and remained a fundamentalist Christian who considered becoming a minister before starting his broadcasting career.

===Childhood interest in broadcasting===
Scott showed an early interest in broadcasting. Recounting his first experience visiting a radio station, he said &quot;One day when I was eight, Mom took me to the movies in DC. Afterward, she wanted to shop, so I wandered over to my favorite radio station, WTOP. I introduced myself to the receptionist and told her I was a fan. She took me to the control room and said, &#x27;You can sit here if you stay very quiet. That man will be broadcasting live&#x27;. The man was Eric Sevareid, then a correspondent for CBS. He’d just gotten back from Burma, where he’d been lost in the jungle for months. I sat there enthralled as Sevareid recounted his ordeal&quot;.

At the age of nine, Scott organized a group of 15 boys into a radio club on his neighborhood block. Scott built his own radio station in his family home&#x27;s basement and sold ads he aired during his low power broadcasts. The club netted about $25 a month () in advertising revenue from neighborhood businesses. Scott said &quot;...I set to work building a station in our basement. My parents bought me an oscillator, which enabled me to broadcast to 20 neighborhood homes within a radius. My friends and I read the news, played tunes on a phonograph, and chattered away. A few months after we started, three men from the FCC showed up. They told us our signal was reaching National Airport — Pan Am’s radios were picking up kids talking and playing records. So ended my basement station&quot;.

Spending time at local Alexandria radio station WPIK-AM on Friday nights as a teenager, a local disk jockey allowed him to create a radio show called &quot;Lady Make Believe&quot;. Scott also served as announcer for the show. Scott also held two part-time disk jockey jobs while in high school, 
&quot;High School Hit Parade&quot; on WOL 1450 AM and &quot;Dancing Party&quot; on WCFM 99.5 FM.

===NBC radio announcer at 16===
Scott was 16 years old in 1950 when he worked as an NBC page at WRC (AM), NBC&#x27;s owned-and-operated radio station in Washington, D.C., for $12 per week (). Scott explained how he started announcing at NBC – &quot;I auditioned to be an announcer but was never hired. Then one of the announcers left for vacation and my boss said, &#x27;What the hell, let Scott fill in — it’s only two weeks.&#x27; When he returned, I became a regular substitute&quot;.

===High school and college===
Scott attended Alexandria, Virginia&#x27;s George Washington High School. While a freshman in 1947, Scott broadcast a high school news report on a local FM radio station every Saturday. Scott graduated high school in 1951. He was elected class president all four years of his attendance. Named &quot;Our capable and popular class president&quot;, he was also voted &quot;Most Likely to Succeed&quot; by his classmates.

Scott attended American University, where he worked alongside fellow student Ed Walker at WAMU-AM, the university&#x27;s radio station (1951—1953). Scott became a member of Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity while at American University and graduated in 1955 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in &quot;philosophy and religion&quot;.

==Broadcast radio career==
===&quot;Joy Boys&quot; radio show===
From 1955 to 1972, Scott teamed with Ed Walker as co-host of the nightly &quot;Joy Boys&quot; radio program on NBC-owned WRC radio (this was interrupted from 1956 to 1958 when Scott served on active duty in the U.S. Navy). Scott routinely sketched a list of characters and a few lead lines setting up a situation, which Walker would commit to memory or make notes on with his Braille typewriter (Walker was blind since birth). 

The show opened with Scott and Walker singing their &quot;Joy Boys&quot; opening theme song set to the music of John N. Klohr&#x27;s The Billboard March. They recorded it in two versions, a duet between them, and Walker singing in four-part harmony with himself, for use as, respectively, the opening and closing themes for the show:

&quot;We are the Joy Boys of radio;&quot;
&quot;We chase electrons to and fro-o-o.&quot;
&quot;We are the Joy Boys of radio;&quot;
&quot;We chase electrons to and fro.&quot;

In a 1999 Washington Post article recalling the &quot;Joy Boys&quot; at the height of their mid-1960s popularity, said the &quot;Joy Boys&quot; &quot;dominated Washington, providing entertainment, companionship, and community to a city on the verge of powerful change&quot;. The &quot;Joy Boys&quot; broadcast on WRC until the station changed to a rock music format in October, 1972. The &quot;Joy Boys&quot; show moved to WWDC-AM for another two years. Scott wrote in his book &quot;The Joy of Living&quot;, their close professional and personal bond continued until Walker&#x27;s death in October 2015. Scott said they were &quot;closer than most brothers&quot;. 

After the &quot;Joy Boys&quot; show ended, Scott thrived as a Washington D.C. area personality, doing product pitches and popping up at ribbon-cutting ceremonies.

===WAVY AM 1350 disk jockey while in the Navy===
In 1956 Scott lived near Norfolk, Virginia while serving in the U.S. Navy and moonlighted at WAVY AM radio as one of four staff disk jockeys who presented the &quot;WAVY Nifty Fifty, Tidewater&#x27;s Top Tune Tally.&quot;. He was promoted on local advertising for the Tidewater area radio station.

==Early broadcast television career==
===Children&#x27;s programs a great preparation for television success===
Scott felt his early work in children&#x27;s programming was one reason for his success in engaging and entertaining television viewers. &quot;I have always said that the best training to be a TV newsman or anybody on television is to do a children’s show because you are oblivious to the fact that there is a camera there. ...You are playing to the kids in the studio, and then you are playing directly to the kids at home. You look in the lens and you are never using a teleprompter ...and you get a tremendous, comfortable feeling in front of a camera doing a children’s show. There are no two ways about that: Doing a kid’s show is great training.&quot;

===&quot;Barn Party&quot;===
Scott&#x27;s first children&#x27;s television appearance was on WNBW TV&#x27;s &quot;Barn Party&quot; in 1954. Scott said &quot;My first chance to do kiddie shows professionally came before I was in the Navy, on a Saturday TV show called &quot;Barn Party&quot;. I was &#x27;Farmer Willard&#x27; and I played opposite a very refined lady named Betsy Stelck, who had a fairyland aura about her...&quot; The show was a hit. When children were asked to mail in requests for tickets to attend the weekly broadcast production, 6,223 requests were received. The studio only seated 50.

===&quot;Afternoon&quot;===
Scott was a &quot;co-master of ceremonies&quot; with Mac McGarry on this 1955 afternoon variety program broadcast on WRC-TV. The show featured live music, vocalists, fashion and food segments by Inga Rundvold and Jim Henson&#x27;s puppet group Sam and Friends, an early incarnation of the Muppets. At the time, Henson was a college freshman. Scott remembered Henson&#x27;s work as &quot;... an innovative bunch of puppets created by a guy named Jim Henson. ... I worked with a bald-headed Muppet with a big nose, named Sam, sort of the way Fran Allison worked on Kukla, Fran and Ollie. Then there was the frog named Kermit. I used to do a commercial for a local peanut butter called Schindler&#x27;s. He&#x27;d open his mouth, I&#x27;d give him a big spoonful, and he&#x27;d go &#x27;ahh&#x27;&quot;.

===&quot;Commander Retro&quot;===
Scott said this 1966 children’s show he created and hosted was &quot;The worst show I did in my life, in my opinion, was the best show I ever did in my life, we had more fun&quot;. Scott used Lester, his basset hound, as &quot;Doctor Strangedog&quot;, a human German physicist and spy who had stowed away on the rocket ship. The spy had eaten too many hotdog sausages, exploded and turned into a talking dog. Scott played the commander of their traveling spaceship. The rocket ship set had control panels made of plastic mini-ice cube trays with blinking Christmas lights behind them. Scott said &quot;This was a terrible show, a real turkey ...but it was more fun to do than any of them&quot;.

===&quot;Bozo the Clown&quot;===
Scott portrayed &quot;Bozo the Clown&quot; on WRC-TV&#x27;s one-hour, weekday show &quot;Bozo&#x27;s Circus&quot;. Scott said &quot;WRC bought local rights to Bozo the Clown, and I was cast in the role. Bozo went to the White House and met JFK and Caroline. I played him from 1959 to 1962, doing a daily one-hour show&quot;. Washington, D.C., area McDonald&#x27;s hired Scott – as Bozo – to attract customers. Whenever Scott as Bozo arrived at one of the then five D.C. area McDonald&#x27;s, he caused traffic jams. Roads were shut down for two miles and extra police had to control thousands of kids as they arrived to see Bozo. WRC-TV canceled the show in 1962.

===Created Ronald McDonald, the Hamburger-Happy Clown===

Washington, D.C., McDonald&#x27;s stores had enjoyed incredible customer attendance when Scott appeared as Bozo the Clown. When WRC-TV cancelled the show, Scott could no longer appear as that popular clown. The local McDonald&#x27;s franchisees wanted another clown to drive sales and asked Scott to develop a new character. Scott said &quot;At the time, Bozo was the hottest children&#x27;s show on the air. You could probably have sent Pluto the Dog or Dumbo the Elephant over and it would have been equally as successful. But I was there, and I was Bozo... There was something about the combination of hamburgers and Bozo that was irresistible to kids... That&#x27;s why when Bozo went off the air a few years later, the local McDonald&#x27;s people asked me to come up with a new character to take Bozo&#x27;s place. So, I sat down and created Ronald McDonald&quot;.

Scott&#x27;s Ronald McDonald costume included a small paper cup over his nose, a cardboard food tray worn as a hat and a cardboard food tray containing a complete McDonald&#x27;s meal - a wrapped hamburger, paper bag of fries and a drink, worn just above the front of his pants that “magically” replaced the hamburger every time one disappeared. Scott portrayed Ronald McDonald from 1963 through 1967, appearing in three television commercials and narrating a 45 rpm recording of &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot; as part of a 1963 holiday promotion. The record has become a sought-after collectible.

McDonald&#x27;s corporation purchased the Washington, D.C., franchise back from the area franchisees and became the owner of the Ronald McDonald intellectual property. Scott was told he would continue to portray the clown but just before he was to appear at the 1966 Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, Scott was replaced by a new clown actor, Coco, who had been a clown in the Ringling Brothers circus.

In his book &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot;, Eric Schlosser claims that McDonald&#x27;s replaced Scott on account of his weight, supposedly concerned about McDonald&#x27;s image. Scott denied the claims and cited other commitments he had at the time.

===&quot;The Ronald Show&quot;===
Scott continued to appear as Ronald McDonald in the Washington, D.C., broadcast market. In 1966, Scott served as master of ceremonies WRC-TV&#x27;s new program, &quot;The Ronald Show&quot;. The show had a studio audience of 30 youngsters every Saturday who played games, performed dramatic skits and interacted with Scott as clown Ronald. Scott said the show was &quot;One of those magnificent rare treasures ... featuring dramatizations and dance contests.&quot;

==Weather presenter career==
Scott&#x27;s weathercaster career started when he was chosen as a fill-in weatherman on WRC-TV in 1967. The incumbent had suddenly walked off the job. In 1970, Scott became WRC-TV&#x27;s full-time weekday weatherman. In March 1980, the NBC network came calling, and Scott was named weatherman on TODAY, replacing Bob Ryan. Ryan then took Scott&#x27;s old job, becoming the meteorologist at WRC-TV.

==&quot;The Today Show&quot;==
Scott was tapped by NBC in 1980 to become its weatherman for &quot;The Today Show&quot;. At the time, the &quot;Today Show&quot; was in its first ratings battle with ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Scott quickly established his ability to connect with his audience. Often appearing as different characters in his segments, he once delivered the weather as pop singer Boy George. His antics on &quot;Today&quot; helped move the show&#x27;s ratings back to first place, where it remained for much of the decade.

During the 1980s, Scott routinely did weather reports on the road, interviewing locals at community festivals and landmarks. He also periodically performed on the program from Washington, D.C., which he still considered his home.

===Appearance as Carmen Miranda===
Scott said he used to dress up like Carmen Miranda as a kid to sell war bonds in World War II. He promised to don a Miranda outfit again if a viewer would donate $1,000 to the USO. The donation was made and Scott gave his August 22, 1983, weather forecast on the &quot;Today Show&quot; dressed in drag, wearing a bright red tropical dress, earrings and pearls, heels, and a showy, multi-colored headdress with feathers and fruit, reminiscent of the late Brazilian entertainer&#x27;s outfits. Scott&#x27;s weather forecast was accompanied by two flamenco musicians. 

Discussing his Carmen Miranda appearance in 1987, Scott told the &quot;New York Times&quot; &quot;People said I was a buffoon to do it. Well, all my life I&#x27;ve been a buffoon. That&#x27;s my act.&quot; He explained his love for his audience, saying &quot;I just love people. A lot of speakers on the talk circuit leave right afterward. I do a lot of schmoozing. I&#x27;m like a dog. You just open the door and I go, &#x27;rrrr, rrrr,&#x27; and then I lick everybody&#x27;s face.&quot;

===Smucker&#x27;s birthday segments===
Scott started celebrating centenarians&#x27; happy birthdays on “Today” in 1983. &quot;Saluting people on their 100th birthday started when I got a card that read, &#x27;My uncle is turning 100. Could you mention him on TV?&#x27; I did it and about a week later got two cards, then four, then six.&quot; Eventually Smucker&#x27;s sponsored the segment, showing each person’s photo and name on a Smucker&#x27;s strawberry jelly jar label. When Scott died, Smucker’s posted a tribute to him, putting his face on the jelly jar label graphic.

===Bryant Gumbel criticism and ratings repercussions===
In 1989, &quot;The Today Show&quot; co-host Bryant Gumbel wrote an internal memo critical of the show&#x27;s personalities, a memo that was later leaked to the media. In the memo, Gumbel said Scott &quot;holds the show hostage to his assortment of whims, wishes, birthdays and bad taste ...this guy is killing us and no one&#x27;s even trying to rein him in.&quot; This garnered enough of a backlash that the next time they appeared on camera together Scott kissed Gumbel on the cheek to show he&#x27;d forgiven him, and also later said he hoped the whole thing would go away.

After Gumbel&#x27;s comments, there was a decline in viewership ratings for the &quot;Today Show&quot;. According to NBC, the &quot;Q Score&quot; popularity tracking poll taken by Marketing Evaluations Inc. showed an increase in negative reaction to Gumbel and his earlier criticism of Scott in its annual May 1989 survey of the show. The then &quot;Today Show&quot; executive producer Tom Capra said &quot;The publicity and the negative factors have hurt us&quot;. CBS network research also indicated continuing negative reaction to Gumbel&#x27;s comments regarding Scott.

===&quot;Today Show&quot; staff support===
After Scott&#x27;s Carmen Miranda appearance, Tom Brokaw, former &quot;Today Show&quot; anchor said of Scott, &quot;Willard was a born showman&quot;. Al Roker, the meteorologist who succeeded Scott on the &quot;Today Show&quot; said &quot;No broadcaster was loved by so many and brought so many smiles&quot;.

===Commercial pitchman===
In 1992, Scott, who was the first incarnation of Ronald McDonald, recorded a commercial for McDonald&#x27;s arch-rival Burger King. He also was the spokesman for the Days Inn hotel chain, appearing in their commercials from 1993 until 1997.

The companies Scott endorsed include: Howard Johnson Motor Lodges, True Value Hardware, Burger King, Lipton tea, Maxwell House coffee, the American Dairy Association, the Florida Citrus Commission, Diet Coke, USA Today and many others.

==Later broadcast television career==
===&quot;Willard Scott&#x27;s Home and Garden Almanac&quot;===
In 1995, Scott was the host of one of the first weekly series on the then new cable TV channel Home &amp; Garden Television. The series ran two years.

===Actor===
Scott made occasional guest appearances as neighbor &quot;Mr. Poole&quot; on &quot;The Hogan Family&quot;, where his character was married to Mrs. Poole, played by Edie McClurg.

==Voice-over and narration career==
===NASA===
Scott worked as the narrator for NASA&#x27;s weekly program called &quot;The Space Story&quot;, with his contributions spanning from the Apollo Program to the Space Shuttle.

==Other TV work==

===Personal appearances / TV Commentator career===
Scott was the host of WAVE TV&#x27;s broadcast coverage of the Kentucky Derby Festival Pegasus Parade in Louisville, Kentucky, from 1982 through 2005. Scott also hosted the NBC telecast of the &quot;Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade&quot; from 1987 to 1997. He was replaced by Matt Lauer in 1998.

For several years in the 1980s, Scott donned a Santa Claus costume for the broadcast of the National Tree-Lighting Ceremony in Washington, D.C.

In 1990 and 1992, Scott also hosted the Pillsbury Bake-Off on CBS (while under contract with CBS&#x27; rival NBC).

==Military service==
Scott enlisted in the U.S. Navy, serving from 1956 to 1958 as a seaman. Then 22 years old, Scott recorded his feelings on November 23, 1956, the day before he enlisted.

==Retirement==
Scott went into semi-retirement in early 1996, succeeded by Al Roker who moved from D.C. station WTTG. Scott had helped Roker earn the weather job at the NBC&#x27;s WKYC in Cleveland.

Scott continued to appear two days a week on the morning program to wish centenarians a happy birthday (a tradition that continues to the present day). He appeared from the studio lot of WBBH, the NBC affiliate in Fort Myers, Florida. 

Scott also continued to substitute for Roker for over a decade afterward, an arrangement that mostly ended after NBC acquired The Weather Channel in 2008 and started using that channel&#x27;s meteorologists as substitutes.

Scott announced his full retirement from television on December 11, 2015. On Scott&#x27;s final day, &quot;Today&quot; held a tribute to Scott featuring taped highlights from his many years with the show. The plaza outside Rockefeller Center was renamed Willard Scott Way in his honor. Several former &quot;Today&quot; staff came to bid farewell to Scott including Tom Brokaw, Jane Pauley, Katie Couric, and Gene Shalit along with Barbara Bush. After Scott was feted on the &quot;Today Show&quot; with cupcakes and comments from co-anchors, he said &quot;I&#x27;m fading off into the sunset&quot; and started singing Dale Evans&#x27;s song &quot;Happy trails to you until we meet again. Happy trails to you. Keep smilin&#x27; on &#x27;til then.&quot;

==Awards==


==Radio reissues and Santa Claus==
In 2001, American University reissued some of the old &quot;Joy Boys&quot; radio broadcasts of the 1960s on CDs. He also played Santa Claus at various White House events.

==Writings==
Scott published several fiction and non-fiction books:
*&quot;The Joy of Living&quot;
*&quot;Down Home Stories&quot;
*&quot;Willard Scott’s All-American Cookbook&quot;
*&quot;America Is My Neighborhood&quot;
*&quot;The Older the Fiddle, the Better the Tune&quot;
*&quot;If I Knew It Was Going to Be This Much Fun, I Would Have Become a Grandparent First&quot;

He also co-authored two books with Bill Crider:

*&quot;Murder Under Blue Skies&quot;
*&quot;Murder in the Mist&quot;

He preached a sermon at the 185th anniversary of his home church, First Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, that was published in &quot;Best Sermons 2&quot;, edited by James W. Cox [Harper &amp; Row, 1989].

==Personal life==
Scott was married to Mary Dwyer Scott from 1959 until her death in 2002. The couple had two children, Mary and Sally. On April 1, 2014, at age 80, Scott married Paris Keena, whom he first met in 1977 while she was working at WRC-TV in Washington, D.C. They had been together as a couple since 2003. They lived on Sanibel Island, Florida.

==Death==
Scott died of natural causes on September 4, 2021, at the age of 87.

<doc id="508549" wikidata="Q1062347" url="?curid=508549" title="Ivan Rybkin">
<text>Ivan Petrovich Rybkin (; born 20 October 1946) is a Russian politician. He was Chairman of Russia&#x27;s State Duma in 1994–96 and Secretary of the Security Council in 1996–1998. He has the federal state civilian service rank of 1st class Active State Councillor of the Russian Federation.

He ran for the Russian presidency in 2004, before dropping out after allegedly being kidnapped and drugged by Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers.

==Early life==
He was born in village of Semigorka, Voronesh Oblast. In 1968, Rybkin graduated from Volgograd Agricultural Institute, and in 1991 from the Soviet Academy of Social Sciences.

==Political career==
After a career on lower ranks of the Communist Party, Rybkin was elected as peoples&#x27; deputy to the congress of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic in 1990. In 1993, Rybkin became a member of the Agrarian Party of Russia. That very year in December, he was elected deputy of the State Duma.

===Speaker of Russian State Duma===
In 1994, Rybkin was elected speaker of the State Duma. In January 1995, he became a member of the Security Council of the Russian Federation. In July of that year, Rybkin became a leader of the Ivan Rybkin Bloc.

Ivan Rybkin Bloc got 1.39% of the vote in the 1995 Russian legislative election, falling short of a 5% electoral threshold. Its campaign video clip featured two cows who discussed fairness in a philosophical manner.

In March 1998, Rybkin was appointed Deputy Prime Minister for Commonwealth of Independent States affairs.

===Presidential campaign and alleged kidnapping===
In 2004, Rybkin was nominated by Berezovsky&#x27;s Liberal Party for the Russian presidential elections. During the campaign, on 2 February 2004, he accused incumbent President Vladimir Putin of organizing terrorist acts in Russia in 1999 and of being involved in shady business activities with Yury Kovalchuk, Mikhail Kovalchuk, Gennady Timchenko, KiNEx and the Russia Bank, which allegedly swallowed up a vast share of the nation&#x27;s financial flows.

Rybkin&#x27;s candidacy aligned itself strongly with Berezovsky&#x27;s politics. While it was believed that Rybkin would, even optimistically, be unable to receive more than 2% of the vote, it was also believed that he might receive a sizable enough amount of funding from Berezovsky that he could orchestrate a significant amount of anti-Putin campaigning in advance of the election.

Many Russians had reported themselves to be too unfamiliar with Rybkin to have an opinion on him.

In February 2004, Rybkin disappeared for four days under mysterious circumstances. A day before his disappearance he accused the Putin administration of complicity in the 1999 bomb attacks in Moscow that led to a war in the Russian breakaway republic of Chechnya. Five days later, Rybkin appeared in Kyiv. According to Rybkin&#x27;s first explanations, on February 5 he decided to “take a break from the fuss” that was raised around him and went to Kyiv. Rybkin did not specify what kind of “fuss” this was. He said that he turned off his mobile phones so that his rest would not be disturbed. “I have the right to two or three days of privacy! - said Rybkin. “I often visit Kyiv, my friends and I walk the streets, especially since the weather was good there this weekend.” Later, he stated that he had been kidnapped and drugged by Russian FSB agents who lured him to Ukraine promising to arrange meeting with the former Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov. Upon arrival he was offered refreshments in the apartment, at which point he became &quot;very drowsy.&quot; After being unconscious, he woke up on 10 February. Upon waking, he was shown a videotape in which he was performing &quot;revolting acts&quot; conducted by &quot;horrible perverts&quot;. He was told that the tape would be made public if he continued with his presidential campaign. According to Alexander Litvinenko, the FSB agents apparently treated Rybkin with their standard truth drug.

Rybkin said he feared for his safety if he returned to Russia, and whilst he initially continued the campaign from abroad, on 5 March 2004, he withdrew from the race, saying he did not want to be part of &quot;this farce,&quot; as he called the elections.

<doc id="508555" wikidata="Q1911432" url="?curid=508555" title="Maurice Spector">
<text>Maurice Spector (March 19, 1898 – August 1, 1968) was a Canadian politician who served as the chairman of the Communist Party of Canada and the editor of its newspaper, &quot;The Worker&quot;, for much of the 1920s. He was an early follower of Leon Trotsky after Trotsky&#x27;s split from the Communist International.

==Early life==
Spector was born in the Russian Empire and immigrated to Canada with his family as an infant. He graduated from Queen&#x27;s University and practiced labour law in Toronto when he was not employed in political positions.

==First radical political activity==
Spector was influenced by Trotsky&#x27;s work &quot;The Bolsheviki and World Peace,&quot;, which was published in the Toronto &quot;Mail and Empire&quot; in January 1918 and by Social Democratic Party of Canada (SDP) Dominion Secretary Isaac Bainbridge, who introduced him to Lenin&#x27;s writings and inspired him to join the SDP. Spector engaged with the left wing of the Canadian SDP and eventually left to form the Communist Party of Canada.

==Turn to Trotskyism==
In 1928, Spector, while attending the Sixth Congress of the Comintern in Moscow, accidentally got hold of a copy of Trotsky&#x27;s &quot;Critique of the Draft Programme of the Communist International&quot;, which criticized the position of Nikolai Bukharin and Joseph Stalin and especially the theory of &quot;socialism in one country&quot;. The critique was a landmark in the ideological arming of the International Left Opposition. In a truly-prophetic statement, Trotsky warned that if this position were adopted by the Communist International, it would inevitably mark the beginning of a process that would lead to the nationalist and reformist degeneration of every communist party in the world. Three generations later, his prediction, which was then ridiculed by the Stalinists, has been shown to be correct.

Stalin had no intention of circulating Trotsky&#x27;s document, but by a strange accident of history, that is what happened. The Stalinist regime had not yet been consolidated, and the Communist International still had to observe certain norms of democratic centralism, which permitted the circulation of minority opinions. Although Trotsky had been expelled from the Russian party a year earlier, he took advantage of the Congress to appeal to the Communist International. In the process, he submitted his document on the Draft Programme. Through a blunder in the apparatus, it circulated Trotsky&#x27;s document to the heads of the delegations, including members of the programme commission. It was then that the American James Cannon and Maurice Spector first saw and read Trotsky&#x27;s document.

Cannon recalled:
&quot;Through some slip-up in the apparatus in Moscow,&quot; recalls Cannon, &quot;which was supposed to be airtight, this document of Trotsky came into the translating room of the Comintern. It fell into the hopper, where they had a dozen or more translators and stenographers with nothing else to do. They picked up Trotsky&#x27;s document, translated it and distributed it to the heads of the delegations and the members of the programme commission. So, lo and behold, it was laid in my lap, translated into English by Maurice Spector, a delegate from the Canadian party, and in somewhat the same frame of mind as myself, was also on the programme commission and he got a copy. We let the caucus meetings and the Congress sessions go to the devil while we read and studied this document. Then I knew what I had to do, and so did he. Our doubts had been resolved. It was as clear as daylight that Marxist truth was on the side of Trotsky. We had a compact there and then - Spector and I - that we would come back home and begin a struggle under the banner of Trotskyism.&quot;

Spector was a founder of the Canadian Trotskyist movement, which was first constituted as a branch of the Communist League of America in 1929.

== Workers Party of Canada ==
In 1932 he co-founded, with Jack MacDonald, the Workers Party of Canada. The new organization represented the first Canadian section of the International Left Opposition.

== Leaving Canada ==
Spector moved to New York City in 1936 and became a leading member of the Trotskyist movement there. He presented the International Report at the founding convention of the Socialist Workers Party at the end of 1938 but dropped out of the party in 1939. (Contrary to some reports, he did not take part in the 1939-40 debate between James Cannon and Max Shachtman.)

He joined the Socialist Party of America shortly after leaving the SWP in 1939 and remained on its executive body until 1958, when he resigned after breaking with Max Shachtman and his proposal to merge Shachtman&#x27;s Independent Socialist League with the Socialist Party, which Spector anticipated would move the SP to the right.

In his later, Spector became editor of a children&#x27;s magazine published by the Labour Zionist movement.

==Deportation threat==
Canada had revoked Spector&#x27;s citizenship, and in 1941, the Federal Bureau of Investigation learned that Spector was in the United States illegally and had him detained. As Canada refused to accept him, the United States began proceedings to deport him to the Soviet Union. The American Civil Liberties Union defended Spector on the grounds that as a Trotskyist, his life would be in danger if he was deported to the Soviet Union. Spector eventually regained his Canadian citizenship and was permitted to remain in New York.

==Later life==
Spector was employed for part of his post-Trotskyist career by the American Council for Judaism and was director of the New York trade union division of the National Committee for Labor Israel in his later years.

Spector died on August 1, 1968, at the age of 70.

<doc id="508557" wikidata="Q193083" url="?curid=508557" title="Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics">
<text>Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics or NUTS () is a geocode standard for referencing the administrative divisions of countries for statistical purposes. The standard, adopted in 2003, is developed and regulated by the European Union, and thus only covers the EU member states in detail. The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics is instrumental in the European Union&#x27;s Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund delivery mechanisms and for locating the area where goods and services subject to European public procurement legislation are to be delivered.

For each EU member country, a hierarchy of three NUTS levels is established by Eurostat in agreement with each member state; the subdivisions in some levels do not necessarily correspond to administrative divisions within the country. A NUTS code begins with a two-letter code referencing the country, as abbreviated in the European Union&#x27;s Interinstitutional Style Guide. The subdivision of the country is then referred to with one number. A second or third subdivision level is referred to with another number each. Each numbering starts with 1, as 0 is used for the upper level. Where the subdivision has more than nine entities, capital letters are used to continue the numbering. Below the three NUTS levels are local administrative units (LAUs). A similar statistical system is defined for the candidate countries and members of the European Free Trade Association, but they are not part of NUTS governed by the regulations.

The current NUTS classification, dated 21 November 2016 and effective from 1 January 2018 (now updated to current members ), lists 92 regions at NUTS 1, 244 regions at NUTS 2, 1215 regions at NUTS 3 level, and 99,387 local administrative units (LAUs).

==National structures==
Not all countries have every level of division, depending on their size. For example, Luxembourg and Cyprus only have local administrative units (LAUs); the three NUTS divisions each correspond to the entire country itself.

==Establishment==
NUTS regions are generally based on existing national administrative subdivisions. In countries where only one or two regional subdivisions exist, or where the population of existing subdivisions is too small or too large, a second and/or third level is created. This may be on the first level (ex. France, Italy, Greece, and Spain), on the second (ex. Germany) and/or third level (ex. Belgium). In countries with small populations, where the entire country would be placed on the NUTS 2 or even NUTS 3 level (ex. Luxembourg, Cyprus), the regions at levels 1, 2 and 3 are identical to each other (and also to the entire country), but are coded with the appropriate length codes levels 1, 2 and 3.

The NUTS system favors existing administrative units, with one or more assigned to each NUTS level. Specific guidelines are based in population, leaving little or no role for other types of variables such as area, distance, topography, levels of jurisdiction or history, which can only be considered in (unspecified) types of special cases. From the NUTS Regulation, the average population size of the regions in the respective level shall lie within the following thresholds:

For non-administrative units, deviations from these population marks exist for particular geographical, socio-economic, historical, cultural or environmental circumstances, especially for islands and outermost regions.

<text>The Achaean League () was a Hellenistic-era confederation of Greek city-states on the northern and central Peloponnese. The league was named after the region of Achaea in the northwestern Peloponnese, which formed its original core. The first league was formed in the fifth century BC. The second Achaean League was established in 280 BC. As a rival of Antigonid Macedon and an ally of the Roman Republic, the league played a major role in the expansion of Rome into Greece. This process eventually led to the League&#x27;s conquest and dissolution by the Romans in 146 BC.

The League represents the most successful attempt by the Greek city-states to develop a form of federalism, which balanced the need for collective action with the desire for local autonomy. Through the writings of the Achaean statesman Polybius, this structure has had an influence on the constitution of the United States and other modern federal states.

==History==
===Classical league===
The first Achaean League became active in the fifth century in the northwestern Peloponnese. After the catastrophic destruction of the ancient capital Helike by an earthquake and tsunami in 373 BC, it appears to have lapsed. Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Hellenica&quot; reports that Achaea underwent a democratic revolution in 367 and the previous ruling class was exiled.

===Hellenistic league===
The regional Achaean League was reformed in 281/0 BC by the communities of Dyme, Patrae, Pharae and Tritaea, joined in 275 by Aegium, which controlled the important sanctuary of Zeus Homarios. The league grew quickly to include the entire Achaean heartland, and after a decade it had ten or eleven members. The key moment for the League&#x27;s transformation into a major power came in 251, when Aratus, the exiled son of a former magistrate of Sicyon, overthrew the tyranny in his native city and brought it into the Achaean League. Since the Sicyonians were of Dorian and Ionian origin, their inclusion opened the League for other national elements. Aratus, then only twenty years old, rapidly became the leading politician of the League. In the thirty two years between 245 and his death in 213, Aratus would hold the office of general a total of sixteen times.

At this time, Central Greece and the Peloponnese were dominated by the Macedonian Kingdom of Antigonus II Gonatas who maintained garrisons at key strategic points such as Chalcis, Piraeus and Acrocorinth, the so-called &quot;fetters of Greece&quot;. In other cities of the Peloponnese, namely Argos, Orchomenus, and Megalopolis, Antigonus had installed friendly rulers who were perceived as tyrants by the Achaeans. Aratus, whose father had been killed by one, called for the liberation of these cities and secured financial support for the League from Ptolemy II of Egypt, an enemy of the Antigonids. He then used the money to challenge the Macedonian hold on the Peloponnese.

Aratus&#x27; greatest success came when he captured Corinth and the fortress of Acrocorinth in 243 BC in a daring night attack. This effectively blocked Macedonian access to the Peloponnese by land, isolating their allies at Megalopolis and Argos. In light of this success, a number of Greek communities, including Epidaurus and Megara joined the League and Ptolemy III increased Egypt&#x27;s support for the Achaeans, being elected as the League&#x27;s &quot;hegemon&quot; (leader) in return. Antigonus Gonatas finally made peace with the Achaean League in a treaty of 240 BC, ceding the territories that he had lost in Greece.

The increased size of the league meant a bigger citizen army and more wealth, which was used to hire mercenaries, but it also led to hostility from the remaining independent Greek states, especially Elis, the Aetolian League and Sparta, which perceived the Achaeans as a threat. Corinth was followed by Megalopolis in 235 BC and Argos in 229 BC. However the league soon ran into difficulties with the revived Sparta of Cleomenes III. Aratus was forced to call in the aid of the Macedonian King, Antigonus III Doson, who defeated Cleomenes at Sellasia. Antigonus Doson re-established Macedonian control over much of the region. In 229 BC, the Achaean League participated in a naval battle off the island of Paxos in a coalition with Korkyra and the Aetolian League, and were defeated by a coalition of Illyrians and Acarnanians; as a result, the Korkyreans were forced to accept an Illyrian garrison in their city, which was put under the command of Demetrius of Pharos.

In 220 BC, the Achaean League entered into a war against the Aetolian League, which was called the &quot;Social War&quot;. The young king Philip V of Macedon sided with the Achaeans and called for a Panhellenic conference in Corinth, where the Aetolian aggression was condemned. After Aratus&#x27;s death, however, the League joined Rome in the Second Macedonian War (200–196 BC), which broke Macedonian power in mainland Greece. The Achaean League was one of the main beneficiaries. Under the leadership of Philopoemen, the League was able to finally defeat a heavily weakened Sparta and take control of the entire Peloponnese.
The League&#x27;s dominance was not to last long, however. During the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC), the League flirted with the idea of an alliance with Perseus of Macedon, and the Romans punished it by taking several hostages to ensure good behavior, including Polybius, the Hellenistic historian who subsequently wrote about the rise of the Roman Republic. In 146 BC, the league&#x27;s relations with Rome completely collapsed, leading to the Achaean War. The Romans under Lucius Mummius defeated the Achaeans at the Battle of Corinth, razed Corinth and dissolved the League, finally putting an end to the independence of Ancient Greece from external rule and ushering in the Roman era. G.T. Griffith has written that Achaean War was &quot;a hopeless enterprise for the Achaeans, badly led and backed by no adequate reserves of money or men.&quot; Lucius Mummius received the agnomen &quot;Achaicus&quot; (&quot;conqueror of Achaea&quot;) for his role.

===Roman era===
The original name Koinon of Achaeans (Achaean League) continues to exist in epigraphy, denoting either the previous Peloponnesian members (see koinon of Free Laconians) or the whole of Roman Achaea. In c. 120 BC Achaeans of cities in the Peloponnese dedicated an honorary inscription to Olympian Zeus, after a military expedition with Gnaeus Domitius against the Galatians in Gallia Transalpina. In Athens, in AD 221–222, the koinon of Achaeans, when the was Egnatius Brachyllus, decided to send an embassy to the emperor Caracalla

== Government ==
The government of the league consisted of an assembly of citizens, a smaller council, and a (general).

The (general) controlled the league&#x27;s military forces. Originally, two held office simultaneously, but from 251, there was only one, who was elected annually by the assembly. Until 217 the entered office in May; afterwards he assumed power at the beginning of winter. Individuals could hold the office more than once (and frequently did so), but not in consecutive years. The general was assisted in his duties by a board of ten &quot;demiourgoi&quot;, a secretary, a (cavalry commander), a (admiral), and (sub-generals commanding in military districts). The office of &quot;Hegemon&quot; (leader) was given to various Antigonid and Ptolemaic kings at various points in Achaean history. Ostensibly, the &quot;hegemon&quot; had ultimate command on land and sea, but in fact the office seems to have been an honorary position which obliged the holder to contribute money to the League and support the League&#x27;s military ventures.

Ultimate decision-making power rested with the assembly (), which was held at Aegium four times a year. All male citizens of communities belonging to the League were entitled to attend. Alongside the assembly there was a council (&quot;boule&quot;), which was open to citizen men over thirty years old. Special meetings () had to be called in order for the league to declare war, form an alliance, or receive official communications from the Macedonian king or (later) the Roman Republic.

The league was ostensibly a democracy, but control seems to have consistently rested with a small elite group who monopolised the generalship and other official positions. Given the difficulty of travelling to Aegium, assemblies were probably dominated by the wealthy.

==Army==
The Achaean army was an army of the traditional &quot;hoplite&quot; type. From the 270s onwards however, much like the rest of Greece, the emergence of the shield known as the &quot;thyreos&quot; was incorporated into Greek warfare and a new type of troop was developed. Reforming their troops into &quot;thyreophoroi&quot;, the Achaean army was now composed of light troops. The were a mixture of evolved and light &quot;hoplites&quot;, carrying the shield, a thrusting spear and javelins. Plutarch says that they could be effective at a distance, but in close combat the narrow shield disadvantaged them. He also says that their formation was ineffective, because it lacked inter-locked shields or a &#x27;leveled line of spears&#x27;. Aratus, one of the major Achaean (generals) and statesmen was known for his use of light forces for irregular operations, a type of warfare suited to the &quot;thyreophoroi&quot; but not suited to operations in the open field.

The League in 217 decided to maintain a standing force of 8,000 mercenary foot and 500 mercenary cavalry, added to a picked citizen force of 3,000 infantry and 300 cavalry, of which 500 foot and 50 horse would come from Argos and the same amount from Megalopolis. Aratus also obtained 500 foot and 50 horse each from Taurion and the Messenians for defence of parts of the League open to attack via Laconia. The citizen infantry would have been armed as , apart from the citizen light troops who would have been archers and slingers etc. This picked citizen force may well have existed before these so-called reforms, at least on an official basis, as we know of a similar elite force of the same size at the Battle of Sellasia in 222.

However, it was the Achaean general Philopoemen in 208 who changed the Achaean fighting style and weaponry to the Macedonian fashion. According to Plutarch, Philopoemen &#x27;persuaded them to adopt long pike and heavy shield instead of spear and buckler, to protect their bodies with helmets and breastplates and greaves, and to practice stationary and steadfast fighting instead of the nimble movements of light-armed troops&#x27;. These &#x27;reforms&#x27; were not necessarily new to some of the constituent cities of the League, as the city of Megalopolis had been given bronze shields and armed in the Macedonian fashion by Antigonus Doson for the Sellasia campaign many years before. Philopoemen then trained the new army how to fight with the new weapons and tactics and how to co-ordinate them with a new mercenary corps that was hired. He spent nearly 8 months of his term as &quot;strategos&quot; visiting, training and advising cities in this capacity. At the Battle of Mantinea in 207 BC the Achaean phalanx was positioned with intervals between the companies with lighter troops. This was a major attempt by Philopoemen to increase the flexibility of his phalanx. He may have picked up this tactic too from his experience at the Battle of Sellasia, where the phalanx of Antigonus Doson was also divided up with light/medium troops in between them. As well as reforming and re-organizing the infantry, Philopoemen also reformed the citizen cavalry. The cavalry was recruited, much like in other Greek states, from the rich and noble classes. Philopoemen organized the cavalry in &quot;lochoi&quot;, which usually in ancient military treatises means &#x27;files&#x27;, most probably of 8 men, grouped into &quot;dilochiai&quot;, a formation of double-files of 16 and so forth.

However, by the time of the Achaean War in 146 BC, the League&#x27;s army had decreased in strength and efficiency. The League was even reduced to freeing and arming 12,000 slaves. This was probably due to the 2nd century BC decline in population. This may well account for the increased hiring of mercenaries, especially Cretans and Thracians.

==Members==

The below are the original Peloponnesian members, except the ancient regions of Sparta, Elis and Messenia. Later Hypana in Elis, Corone, Messene, Sparta and Pagae in Attica were joined by conquest. In 223 BC, Megara in Attica deserted the Achaean League and joined the Boeotian Confederacy.

Besides many city-states on the Mainland joining the Achaean Federation, certain Mediterranean island city-states also became part of the federation. For example, Kydonia on Crete joined at some time after 219 BC.

The city of Helike had been an important member of the first Achaean League, but sank into the sea following a disastrous earthquake in 373 BC. The town of Olenus, also one of the twelve members of the first Achaean League, had been abandoned before 280 BC, but was sometimes counted as though still extant.

The dates in brackets indicate the year of first adhesion. Some cities had periods of separation or foreign occupation and later joined again.

<text>The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR (known also as the Brighton line, the Brighton Railway or the Brighton)) was a railway company in the United Kingdom from 1846 to 1922. Its territory formed a rough triangle, with London at its apex, practically the whole coastline of Sussex as its base, covering a large part of Surrey. It was bounded on its western side by the London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR), which provided an alternative route to Portsmouth. On its eastern side the LB&amp;SCR was bounded by the South Eastern Railway (SER)—later one component of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SE&amp;CR)—which provided an alternative route to Bexhill, St Leonards-on-Sea, and Hastings. The LB&amp;SCR had the most direct routes from London to the south coast seaside resorts of Brighton, Eastbourne, Worthing, Littlehampton and Bognor Regis, and to the ports of Newhaven and Shoreham-by-Sea. It served the inland towns and cities of Chichester, Horsham, East Grinstead and Lewes, and jointly served Croydon, Tunbridge Wells (preserved as the Spa Valley Railway), Dorking and Guildford. At the London end was a complicated suburban and outer-suburban network of lines emanating from London Bridge and Victoria, and shared interests in two cross-London lines.

The LB&amp;SCR was formed by a merger of five companies in 1846, and merged with the L&amp;SWR, the SE&amp;CR and several minor railway companies in southern England under the Railways Act 1921 to form the Southern Railway from 1 January 1923.

==Origins of the company==

The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR) was formed by an act of Parliament, the (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. cclxxxii), on 27 July, through the amalgamation of a number of railway companies:
*The London and Croydon Railway (L&amp;CR), created in 1836 and opened in 1839.
*The London and Brighton Railway (L&amp;BR), created in 1837 and opened in 1841.
*The Brighton and Chichester Railway, created in 1844 and opened in stages between November 1845 and June 1846, with an extension to Havant under construction at the time of amalgamation.
*The Brighton, Lewes and Hastings Railway, created in February 1844, opened in June 1846.
*The Croydon and Epsom Railway, created in July 1844, under construction at the time of amalgamation.
Only the first two were independent operating railways: the Brighton and Chichester and the Brighton, Lewes and Hastings had been purchased by the L&amp;BR in 1845, and the Croydon and Epsom was largely owned by the L&amp;CR.)

The amalgamation was brought about, against the wishes of the boards of directors of the companies, by shareholders in the L&amp;CR and L&amp;BR who were dissatisfied with the early returns from their investments.

The LB&amp;SCR existed for 76 years until 31 December 1922, when it was wound up as a result of the Railways Act 1921 and merged with the London and South Western Railway and the South Eastern and Chatham Railway to form the Southern Railway.

===Original routes===
(Dates of opening from F. Burtt &quot;The Locomotives of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway 1839–1903&quot;.)

At the time of its creation the LB&amp;SCR had around in existence or under construction, consisting of three main routes and a number of branches.

The main line to Brighton from London Bridge opened in 1841. The sections between Corbett&#x27;s Lane (New Cross) and London Bridge and between Croydon and Redhill were shared with the South Eastern Railway (SER). There were two branch lines under construction at the time of the amalgamation: the Sutton &amp; Mole Valley Lines from Croydon to Epsom (opened 10 May 1847), and the Arun Valley Line from to (opened 14 February 1848).

The West Sussex coast line originated with a branch line from Brighton to Shoreham, opened 12 May 1840. This had been extended to Chichester by the time of the amalgamation, and a further extension to Havant was under construction (opened 15 March 1847), with the ultimate aim of extending the line to Portsmouth.

The East Sussex coast line from Brighton to Lewes and St Leonards-on-Sea, with running powers over the SER to Hastings, opened 27 June 1846, one month before the amalgamation, with branches to Newhaven (opened 8 December 1847), Eastbourne and Hailsham (opened 14 May 1849). A connecting spur from the Brighton main line at Keymer Junction near Haywards Heath to the Brighton–Lewes line was under construction at the time of amalgamation, opening in October 1847.
A short line from New Cross to Deptford Wharf, proposed by the L&amp;CR, was approved in July 1846, shortly before amalgamation, but was not opened until 2 July 1849. The use of this line for passengers would have contravened the recently negotiated agreement with the SER that the LB&amp;SCR would not operate lines to the east of its main line, and it was restricted to goods. A short branch from this line to the nearby Surrey Commercial Docks in Rotherhithe opened in July 1855.

===London stations===
The main London terminus was the L&amp;CR station at London Bridge, built by the London and Greenwich Railway (L&amp;GR) in 1836, and exchanged for the original L&amp;CR station in 1842. For the first few years of its existence, LB&amp;SCR trains used the L&amp;GR lines from Corbett&#x27;s Lane into London, but by 1849 the viaducts had been widened sufficiently for its own tracks.

The LB&amp;SCR inherited from the L&amp;CR running powers to the smaller SER passenger terminus at Bricklayers Arms. Poorly sited for passengers, it closed in 1852 and was converted into a goods station.

The LB&amp;SCR owned three stations at Croydon, later East Croydon (former L&amp;BR) Central Croydon and West Croydon (former L&amp;CR).

===Atmospheric lines===
The L&amp;CR had been partially operated by the atmospheric principle between Croydon and Forest Hill, as the first phase of a scheme to use this mode of operation between London and Epsom. However, following a number of technical problems, the LB&amp;SCR abandoned atmospheric operation in May 1847. This enabled it to build its own lines into London Bridge, and have its own independent station there, by 1849.

The history of the LB&amp;SCR can be studied in five distinct periods.

==Relations with neighbouring railways, and the beginnings of expansion 1846–1859==
The LB&amp;SCR was formed at the same time as the bursting of the railway mania investment bubble, and so it found raising capital for expansion extremely difficult during the first years of its operation, other than to complete those projects that were already in hand. The L&amp;BR had experienced difficult relations with the SER where the companies shared facilities, notably at Redhill and Hastings and on the approaches to London Bridge). In October 1849 the SER acquired the new Reading, Guildford and Reigate Railway (RG&amp;RR) line, which the LB&amp;SCR regarded as a major incursion into its territory. However, the LB&amp;SCR had one important playing card not available to the L&amp;BR—control of the SER main line between New Cross and Croydon. In 1849 the LB&amp;SCR appointed a new and capable chairman, Samuel Laing, who negotiated a formal agreement with the SER that would resolve their difficulties for the time being and would define the territories of the two railways. Under this agreement the LB&amp;SCR would have free access to London Bridge, Bricklayers Arms station and goods yard, and Hastings. The SER would have free use of the New Cross to Croydon line, and receive revenues from passengers at intermediate stations, but would not make or work competing lines to Brighton, Horsham, Chichester or Portsmouth.

In 1847 the naval dockyard of Portsmouth was being approached by two equally indirect routes from London, both under construction: a L&amp;SWR route via Fareham and the former Brighton and Chichester Railway route from Havant. The two companies entered into an agreement in that year to share a line from Cosham on the mainland to Portsea Island, ending at the centre of Portsmouth town. Further progress towards the dockyard was prevented by Admiralty objections. The LB&amp;SCR began its services between Chichester and Portsmouth, on 14 June 1847, and the L&amp;SWR from Fareham in October 1848.

In 1853 the Direct Portsmouth Railway gained parliamentary authority to build a line from Godalming to Havant with the intention of the company selling itself either to the L&amp;SWR or the LB&amp;SCR. This scheme would provide a far more direct route to Portsmouth but involved sharing the LB&amp;SCR tracks for the between Havant and the joint line to Portsea. The LB&amp;SCR objected to the scheme but the L&amp;SWR negotiated with the new company and in December 1858 sought to operate a train over the new route. The LB&amp;SCR attempted to prevent the use of its tracks and the so-called &#x27;battle of Havant&#x27; ensued. The matter was eventually resolved in the courts in August 1859, and relations between the railways were formalized in agreements of 1860 and 1862.

Samuel Laing had also approved a modest degree of expansion elsewhere, most notably the acquisition of a branch line from the main line at Three Bridges to the market town of East Grinstead in July 1855.

===Crystal Palace Branch===
Some of the directors of the LB&amp;SCR were closely involved with the company that purchased The Crystal Palace after the completion of The Great Exhibition in October 1851 and arranged for its removal to a site on Sydenham Hill, close to the London to Brighton main line, which they purchased from Leo Schuster. The Crystal Palace became a major tourist attraction and the LB&amp;SCR built a branch line from Sydenham to the new site, which was opened in June 1854, and enlarged London Bridge station to handle the additional traffic. The attraction proved to be an enormous success with 10,000 passengers conveyed daily to and from the new branch. On one day in 1859, 112,000 people were conveyed to Crystal Place by train, 70,000 of which from London Bridge.

==Rapid expansion 1856–1866==
Samuel Laing retired as chairman at the end of 1855 to pursue a political career, and was replaced by the merchant banker Leo Schuster, who had previously sold his estate on Sydenham Hill to the new Crystal Palace Company. Schuster instituted a policy of rapidly expanding the route mileage of the railway with new routes throughout south London, Sussex, and east Surrey. Some of these were financed and built by the LB&amp;SCR, others by independent local companies set up with the intention of connecting a town to the railway network with the intention of sale or lease to the LB&amp;SCR. Schuster accelerated the rate of mileage increase after appointing Frederick Banister as Chief Engineer in 1860. As a result, a further were constructed or authorised between 1857 and 1865.

===West End of London===
Schuster also encouraged an independent concern, the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway (WEL&amp;CPR), to construct a new line extending in a wide arc round south London from the LB&amp;SCR Crystal Palace branch to Wandsworth in 1856 and to Battersea in 1858 with a temporary terminus at Battersea Pier. Shortly after this line was completed, the LB&amp;SCR leased it from the WEL&amp;CPR and incorporated it into its system.

Between 1858 and 1860 the LB&amp;SCR was a major shareholder in the Victoria Station and Pimlico Railway (VS&amp;PR), together with the East Kent Railway (later the London Chatham and Dover Railway (LC&amp;DR)), the Great Western Railway (GWR) and the London &amp; North Western Railway (LNWR). This enterprise constructed the Grosvenor Bridge over the River Thames at Battersea and the line to the Victoria Station, thereby creating a through (albeit roundabout) route from its main line near Croydon to a terminus in the West End of London. Following the acquisition of the WEL&amp;CPR, a new &#x27;cut-off&#x27; line between Windmill Bridge Junction (Norwood) and Balham was constructed during 1861 and 1862, which had the effect of reducing the distance from East Croydon to Victoria.

===New lines in South London===
The VS&amp;PR line was also connected with another joint venture the West London Extension Joint Railway, jointly financed by the LB&amp;SCR, L&amp;SWR, GWR and the L&amp;NWR, to permit goods transfers between the companies and cross-London passenger trains. This line was opened in 1863, and in the same year the LB&amp;SCR and L&amp;SWR jointly opened a large interchange station named Clapham Junction. The LB&amp;SCR also operated passenger trains between Clapham Junction and Addison Road.

The West Croydon to Wimbledon Line was built as an independent railway joining the LB&amp;SCR and the L&amp;SWR main lines and opened in October 1855. For a few months it was operated under contract by its engineer George Parker Bidder but in 1856 it was leased to the LB&amp;SCR who purchased it in 1858.

At the same time, the LB&amp;SCR was cooperating with the LC&amp;DR to create the South London line between its terminuses at London Bridge and Victoria. The LC&amp;DR was used from Victoria to Brixton, followed by new construction by the LB&amp;SCR through Denmark Hill, and Peckham to the main line to London Bridge at South Bermondsey.

===New lines in Sussex===
During 1858, a branch line was built from Lewes to Uckfield, extended to Groombridge and Tunbridge Wells in 1868. In 1864 the Newhaven branch was extended to Seaford. The East Grinstead line was extended in 1866 to Groombridge and Tunbridge Wells. A large area in East Sussex between Tunbridge Wells and Eastbourne remained without railways, and the LB&amp;SCR was anxious in case the SER should venture into this territory. As a result, in 1864 it sought powers to build a line between these two towns. It also obtained powers for the Ouse Valley Railway, from the south of Balcombe and north of Haywards Heath on the Brighton main line to Uckfield and Hailsham; an extension to St Leonards was also approved in May 1865. However, some work had been carried out by the end of 1866, but not completed.

In West Sussex the Horsham branch was extended to Pulborough and Petworth in 1859. In 1861 a line was built from near Horsham to Shoreham, providing a direct link to Brighton. Branches were built from the West Sussex coast line to Littlehampton in 1863, to connect with a new cross-channel ferry service, to Bognor Regis in 1864, and to Hayling Island in 1867. The line from Havant to Hayling had been built by the Hayling Railway, but it was leased to the LB&amp;SCR in 1874.

Following the 1862 agreement with the L&amp;SWR, a line was built from near Pulborough to a junction with the West Sussex coast line near Ford in 1863. This provided a shorter LB&amp;SCR route from London to Portsmouth via Three Bridges and Horsham.

===New lines in Surrey===
The Epsom and Leatherhead Railway was an independent line from the L&amp;SW main line at Wimbledon through Epsom and Leatherhead towards Guildford. The LB&amp;SCR entered into an agreement to share its station at Epsom and to use the line as far as Leatherhead. The line opened in August 1859 and in 1860 this portion was transferred to the joint ownership of the LB&amp;SCR and the L&amp;SWR. The LB&amp;SCR then bought the Banstead and Epsom Downs Railway, which was building a branch line from Sutton to Epsom Downs for Epsom Downs Racecourse, opened in May 1865.

The LB&amp;SCR wished to connect Horsham with significant towns in Surrey, and in 1865 it opened a line between West Horsham and the L&amp;SWR near Guildford. It constructed a line from Leatherhead to Dorking in March 1867, continued to Horsham two months later. This enabled alternative LB&amp;SCR routes from London to Brighton and the West Sussex coast and further reduced the distance of its route from London to Portsmouth.

The LB&amp;SCR supported the independent Surrey and Sussex Junction Railway, which obtained powers in July 1865 to build a line from Croydon to Tunbridge Wells via Oxted, to be worked by the LB&amp;SCR. The involvement of LB&amp;SCR directors in this scheme was interpreted by the SER as a breach of the 1849 agreement, and in retaliation the SER and LC&amp;DR obtained the South Eastern and London, Chatham and Dover (London, Lewes and Brighton) Railways Act 1866 (29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. cccxviii) for a rival &#x27;London, Lewes and Brighton Railway&#x27;, which would undermine the profitable LB&amp;SCR monopoly to that town. Neither scheme was proceeded with.

===Newhaven Harbour===
Following the opening of the branch from Lewes to Newhaven, the LB&amp;SCR sought to develop a shorter Continental route from London to Paris via Dieppe, in competition with the SER routes from Dover to Calais and Folkestone to Boulogne. The LB&amp;SCR built its wharf and warehousing facilities on the east side of the river, with Newhaven Harbour station. It funded the dredging of the channel and other improvements to the harbour between 1850 and 1878, to enable it to be used by larger cross-channel ferries, and in 1863 the LB&amp;SCR and the Chemins de Fer de l&#x27;Ouest introduced the Newhaven–Dieppe passenger service. In 1878 the railway formed and underwrote the Newhaven Harbour Company and thereafter delegated responsibility for its operation to it.

===Growth of the London suburbs===
Largely as a result of the railway, the rural area between New Cross and Croydon rapidly became built up, and the population of Croydon increased 14-fold, from 16,700 to 233,000, during the LB&amp;SCR&#x27;s existence. During the 1860s the LB&amp;SCR began to develop new traffic from the growing number of middle-class commuters who were beginning to live in the south London suburbs and working in central London.

As part of its suburban expansion, the LB&amp;SCR built a line from Peckham Rye roughly parallel to the main line, through East Dulwich, Tulse Hill, Streatham and Mitcham to Sutton and Epsom Downs, which opened in October 1868.

===Deterioration of relations with the SER===
Relations between the LB&amp;SCR and the SER and the interpretation of the 1848 agreement continued to be difficult throughout the 1850s and 1860s. They reached a low point in 1863 when the SER produced a report for its shareholders outlining a long list of the difficulties between the two companies, and the reasons why they considered that the LB&amp;SCR had broken the 1848 agreement.

The main areas of disagreement listed were at Hastings, allowing the LC&amp;DR to use its lines to Victoria, a proposed LB&amp;SCR branch to Bromley, the new LB&amp;SCR line to Dorking, LB&amp;SCR opposition to the SER attempts at building a line to the west end, the LB&amp;SCR agreement to let the LC&amp;DR use its goods facilities at Bricklayers Arms, and the perennial problem of the shared main line between Redhill and Croydon.

The most flagrant example of the lack of cooperation between the two companies, however, was with respect to the independent Caterham Railway, which ran in South Eastern territory, but joined the Brighton mainline at the LB&amp;SCR Godstone Road station (later renamed Caterham Junction). Both companies objected to the other operating the branch line, which resulted in a delay of a year between the completion of the work and the opening of the line in 1856. Their failure to agree on such matters as through ticketing quickly drove the independent company into bankruptcy. Even after the SER took over running of the branch in 1859, the squabbling and bloody mindedness continued to the great detriment of the passengers. Eventually the matters reached the leader columns of &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in 1862 before the companies would negotiate with one another.

The chronic congestion over the shared line between East Croydon railway station and Redhill eased after 1 May 1868 when the route ceased to be on the South Eastern Main Line to Dover following the opening of the &#x27;Sevenoaks cut off&#x27; line between St Johns and Tonbridge railway station. A ten-year agreement between the SER and the LB&amp;SCR over the use of the station and lines to Coulsdon was signed 1 February 1869 and renewed ten years later.

==1867 financial crisis and its impact==
The collapse of the bankers Overend, Gurney and Company in 1866 and the financial crisis the following year brought the LB&amp;SCR to the brink of bankruptcy. A special meeting of shareholders was adjourned, and the powers of the board of directors were suspended pending receipt of a report into the financial affairs of the company and its prospects. The report made clear that the LB&amp;SCR had overextended itself with large capital projects sustained by profits from passengers, which suddenly declined as a result of the crisis. Several country lines were losing money – most notably between Horsham and Guildford, East Grinstead and Tunbridge Wells, and Banstead and Epsom – and the LB&amp;SCR was committed to building or acquiring others with equally poor prospects. The report was extremely critical of the policies of Schuster and the company secretary, Frederick Slight, both of whom resigned. It did however point out that these lines had been built or acquired as a means for preventing competition from neighbouring railways. The committee recommended the abandonment of several projects, and that the LB&amp;SCR should enter into a working agreement with the SER.

The new board of directors accepted many of these recommendations, and they managed to persuade Samuel Laing to return as chairman. It was through his business acumen and that of the new secretary and general manager J. P. Knight that the LB&amp;SCR gradually recovered its financial health during the early 1870s.

As a result, all construction of lines was suspended. Three important projects then under construction were abandoned: the Ouse Valley Railway, its extension to St Leonards, and the Surrey and Sussex Junction Railway. The line between Tunbridge Wells and Eastbourne was shelved until the financial situation improved. For the next decade, projects were limited to additional spurs or junctions in London and Brighton to enhance the operation of the network, or small-scale ventures in conjunction with other railway companies. The latter included a short line from Streatham through Tooting to Wimbledon in 1868, and a connection from Portsmouth Town to Portsmouth Harbour in 1876, both jointly with the L&amp;SWR.

The proposed &#x27;working cooperation&#x27; with the SER never took effect but remained under active consideration by both parties, and later involved the LC&amp;DR. It was not until 1875 that the idea was dropped, after the SER pulled out of negotiations due to the conditions imposed by Parliament on the proposed merger. The LB&amp;SCR continued as an independent railway but the SER and LCDR eventually formed a working relationship in 1899 with the formation of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway.

One new line to which the LB&amp;SCR was committed was the East London Railway, a consortium of six railway companies: the Great Eastern Railway (GER); the LB&amp;SCR; the LC&amp;DR; the SER; the Metropolitan Railway; and the District Railway. It sought to reuse the Thames Tunnel, built by Marc and Isambard Kingdom Brunel between 1825 and 1843. A line was therefore built between the LB&amp;SCR at New Cross and Wapping with a link to the GER main line, in March 1869. It was primarily intended for goods transfer between these railways, but the LB&amp;SCR introduced a passenger service between Liverpool Street Station and Croydon.

==Later 19th century==

By the mid-1870s the LB&amp;SCR had recovered its financial stability through a policy of encouraging the more intensive use of lines and reducing operating costs. Between 1870 and 1889 annual revenue rose from £1.3 million to £2.4 million, whilst its operating costs rose from £650,000 to just over £1 million. The LB&amp;SCR was able to embark upon new railway building and improvements to infrastructure. Some new lines passed through sparsely populated areas and merely provided shorter connections to towns that were already on the railway network, and so were unlikely to be profitable, but the LB&amp;SCR found itself under pressure from local communities wanting a rail connection, and was frightened that they would otherwise be developed by rivals.

The main reason for the financial recovery lay in the exploitation of London suburban traffic. By the late 1880s the LB&amp;SCR had developed the largest suburban network of any British railway, with in the suburbs in addition to its main lines, in three routes between London Bridge and Victoria: the South London line, the outer South London Line and the Crystal Palace lines, and the LB&amp;SCR was earning more from season tickets than any other British railway. Thus an official return showed that the railway had operated more than 100,000 passenger trains from April to June 1889, more than any other company operating only in southern England.

===New routes and station improvements===

The scheme to link Eastbourne with Tunbridge Wells was revived in April 1879 with the opening of a line connecting the Hailsham branch to Heathfield, completed the following September from Heathfield to Eridge, and later known as the Cuckoo Line.

In 1877 authority was granted to the Lewes and East Grinstead Railway (L&amp;EGR), roughly parallel to the &#x27;Cuckoo Line&#x27;, sponsored by local landowners, including the Earl of Sheffield, and including a branch from Horsted Keynes to Haywards Heath on the Brighton main line. A year later an act of 1878 enabled the LB&amp;SCR to acquire and operate lines, opened in August 1882 and September 1883. The East Grinstead–Lewes line subsequently became known as the &#x27;Bluebell line&#x27; and, following its closure in 1958, the section between and was taken over by the Bluebell Railway Preservation Society.

The LB&amp;SCR in West Sussex was largely complete by 1870 except for a link between Midhurst and Chichester, delayed by the financial crisis of 1867; this was revived and opened in 1881. Minor improvements around Littlehampton were made, and a branch to Devil&#x27;s Dyke opened in 1887, built by and owned by an independent company but operated by the LB&amp;SCR. In Hampshire the LB&amp;SCR leased the Hayling Island branch line from 1874, opened in 1865 as an independent concern. The LB&amp;SCR and the L&amp;SWR jointly built a branch from a new station on their existing joint line at Fratton to East Southsea in 1887, but early in the 20th century had to compete with a tramway, and it was closed at the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.

Although the proposed Surrey and Sussex Junction Railway had been abandoned in 1867, there remained a demand from Croydon to towns such as East Grinstead, Tunbridge Wells and the East Sussex coast. The SER was looking for a relief route in the same general direction for its Tonbridge and Hastings services, and the two railways collaborated in a joint line between South Croydon, on the main Brighton line, and Oxted. Beyond Oxted, the LB&amp;SCR would build its own lines to link with the Bluebell line at East Grinstead and its line to Tunbridge Wells. SER trains would join the line between Redhill and Tonbridge. Authority was granted in 1878 and they opened in 1884.

Brighton railway station was rebuilt and extended in 1882–83 with a new single roof, and Eastbourne was rebuilt in 1886 to cope with additional traffic.
===Congestion and slow trains===
With the steady growth of traffic in the South London suburbs during the 1880s and early 1890s, the LB&amp;SCR was the subject of press criticism for poor timekeeping and slow trains, although it was never subjected to the levels of press and public obloquy accorded to the SER. Two of the reasons for poor timekeeping were the volume of traffic generated and the complexity of the LB&amp;SCR network north of Redhill with large numbers of junctions and signals. A further complication was that both the LB&amp;SCR and the SER shared the of track between Redhill and East Croydon. This part of the line was owned by the SER, which (according to Acworth) gave its trains precedence through the junctions at Redhill, but the LB&amp;SCR paid an annual fee of £14,000 for its use. Relations with the SER began to deteriorate once more and eventually both companies appointed Henry Oakley general manager of the Great Northern Railway as an independent assessor in 1889. Oakley supported the LB&amp;SCR right to use the line but increased the annual payment to £20,000. However this did not solve the problem and an 1896 study of LB&amp;SCR passenger services, by J. Pearson Pattinson described the of shared track between Redhill and Stoats Nest (Coulsdon) as being &#x27;in a state of the utmost congestion, and detentions of the Brighton expresses, blocked by South Eastern stopping trains, are as constant as irritating.&#x27;

====Quarry line====
Ultimately the only solution was for the LB&amp;SCR to build its own line between Coulsdon North and Earlswood, bypassing Redhill, which became known as the &#x27;Quarry line&#x27;. Plans were drawn up by Charles L. Morgan, the Chief Engineer. Authority was granted by Parliament in July 1896, and construction took place in 1898–99. The line involved substantial civil engineering works including the excavation of new tunnels at Merstham and Redhill, cuttings, embankments and a covered way at Cane Hill Hospital. The line opened on 8 November 1899 (1 April 1900 for passengers).

==20th century==
During its last 20 years the LB&amp;SCR opened no new lines, but invested in improving its main line and London terminals, together with the electrification of its London suburban services.
Following the completion of the &quot;Quarry line&quot;, the bottleneck on the heavily used main line moved further south. Plans were drawn up for the quadrupling throughout, but only the from Earlswood to Three Bridges were completed, between 1906 and 1909. A fifth track was laid between Norwood Junction and South Croydon in 1907–08. Extension beyond Three Bridges would have involved heavy engineering at Balcombe tunnel, over the Ouse Valley Viaduct and through the South Downs. The required capital expenditure was diverted to extending the electrification programme.

Unlike other mainline railway companies, the LB&amp;SCR had to share both its London termini with its rivals, London Bridge with the SER and Victoria with the LC&amp;DR. The rapid increase in commuting towards the end of the 19th century created an urgent need to expand the cramped and limited facilities at Victoria. During the first decade of the new century the line between Grosvenor Bridge and Victoria was widened and the station rebuilt on a much larger scale. A new turntable and locomotive servicing facilities enabled the use of more powerful locomotives. During the same period LB&amp;SCR facilities at London Bridge were enlarged, but since the station had been rebuilt so many times it remained a &#x27;sprawling confusion&#x27;.

===Motive power shortage===
Between 1905 and 1912 the LB&amp;SCR suffered an increasingly serious motive power shortage due to the inability of Brighton Works to keep pace with the volume of repairs and new construction required. By 1910 30% of the locomotive stock was unusable due to delays and inefficiencies at the works, leading to the sickness and retirement of the Locomotive, Carriage and Wagon Superintendent D. E. Marsh. The problem was solved by the establishment of Lancing Carriage Works and the reorganisation of Brighton Works by Marsh&#x27;s successor L. B. Billinton.

===The First World War===

With other British railways the LB&amp;SCR was brought under government control during the First World War. Until then it had carried relatively little heavy goods, but this changed dramatically at the outbreak of war. The LB&amp;SCR was responsible for carrying the bulk of the stores and munitions delivered to the British troops on the continent, principally through its port of Newhaven This included nearly 7 million tons of goods, including 2.7 million tons of explosives. It necessitated an additional 53,376 goods trains over the four years of the war.

Newhaven harbour also received casualties landing in hospital ships, with the railway providing ambulance trains. There were several army camps within the territory of the LB&amp;SCR which therefore provided 27,366 troop trains. Army horses awaiting shipping to France were stabled at Farlington Racecourse.

At the outbreak of hostilities the area surrounding Newhaven Port was requisitioned and the Harbour station closed. From 22 September 1916 Newhaven became a special military area for handling Government traffic under the Defence of the Realm Regulations.

This additional traffic required substantial improvements to infrastructure, notably at Newhaven harbour, where additional warehousing, new sidings and signalling constructed and electric lighting was installed. When Newhaven became overwhelmed the tidal port of Littlehampton was rebuilt and pressed into service. Inland, a much enlarged goods marshalling yard was established at Three Bridges, which was chosen as a nodal point for handling War traffic. At Gatwick and Haywards Heath, passing loops were constructed so that the frequent passenger trains would not be impeded by slower goods trains and to hold munitions trains during air raids. Some munitions trains were routed to Newhaven via the Steyning Line to Brighton to avoid congesting the part of the Brighton main line which had only two tracks.
Between 1914 and 1918, 5,635 members of LB&amp;SCR staff joined the forces, creating staff shortages at all levels (including the Chief Mechanical Engineer who was called up for service in Russia and Romania). This necessitated the employment of female labour in clerical grades and for carriage cleaning. The railway erected a War Memorial at London Bridge in 1920 honouring the 532 staff who had lost their lives. Likewise, in April 1922, the last locomotive to be constructed by the company, 4-6-4T &#x27;L&#x27; Class No. 333, was named &#x27;Remembrance&#x27; and carried a memorial plaque.

===LB&amp;SCR at Grouping===
By 31 December 1922, when the LB&amp;SCR ceased to have an independent existence, it had of route. Of these, was single track, double track, triple track, and four or more tracks. Sidings had a total length of . According to Bonavia, &#x27;the Brighton was a highly individual line in its strengths and weaknesses, it was to experience drastic changes under Southern [Railway] management which older members of the staff would not always accept gracefully.&#x27;

==Train services==
The LB&amp;SCR was essentially a passenger-carrying concern, with goods and mineral traffic playing a limited role in its receipts. As originally envisaged the railway was a trunk route, conveying passengers (and to a lesser extent goods) between London, Croydon and the south coast, with relatively little traffic to and from stations in between. However, the railway&#x27;s existence began to generate new goods and passenger traffic at towns and villages on or near the main line, such as Reigate, Crawley and Haywards Heath. This also applied to Sussex and Surrey market towns such as Lewes, Horsham, East Grinstead and Dorking as soon as these were connected to the rail network. After 1870 the development of the London suburbs south of the Thames had a profound effect on the nature of the railway. The development of Newhaven harbour was also a stimulus to the development of both categories of traffic.

The speed and punctuality of many LB&amp;SCR passenger services was the subject of widespread criticism in the technical and popular press during the 1890s. This was in part due in part to the complexity of the system between London and Croydon, with a large number of signals and junctions, the sharing of stretches of line with the SER, and the relatively short routes, which gave little opportunity to make up for lost time. The LB&amp;SCR gradually began to rebuild its reputation during the 20th century through improvements to mainline infrastructure and electrification of suburban services.

===Express passenger services===
The company had no long-distance express trains, with a maximum journey length of . Nevertheless, frequent express passenger services ran to the most important coastal destinations from both London Bridge and Victoria. Season ticket revenue, particularly from Brighton to London, was the backbone of the LB&amp;SCR&#x27;s finances for most of the 19th century. The morning rush hour business services were among &quot;the heaviest express services in the world&quot; in the 1880s, with loads of 360 tons.

Individual Pullman cars were introduced to Britain on the Midland Railway in 1874, followed by the Great Northern Railway soon after and the LB&amp;SCR in 1875. The LB&amp;SCR pioneered all-Pullman trains in England, the &quot;Pullman Limited Express&quot; on 5 December 1881. It consisted of four cars built at the Pullman Car Company workshops in Derby, &quot;Beatrice&quot;, &quot;Louise&quot;, &quot;Maud&quot; and &quot;Victoria&quot;, the first electrically lit coaches on a British railway. The train made two down and two up trips per day, one each way on Sundays. It was renamed the &quot;Brighton Pullman Limited&quot; in 1887, and first-class carriages were attached. A new train was built in 1888: three Pullmans were shipped over in parts from the Pullman Palace Car Company in America, and assembled by the LB&amp;SCR at Brighton.

The &quot;Brighton Limited&quot; was introduced on 2 October 1898. It ran only on Sundays, and not in July–September. It was timed to make the journey from Victoria in 60 minutes: &quot;London to Brighton in one hour&quot; was the advertisement used for the first time. On 21 December 1902 it made a record run of 54 minutes. It hit the headlines again when, faced with the threat of a competing electric railway being built from London to Brighton, it ran to Brighton in 48 minutes 41 seconds and the return to London in 50 minutes 21 seconds, matching the schedule put forward by the promoters of the electric line. The &quot;Southern Belle&quot;, introduced 8 November 1908, was described as &quot;the most luxurious train in the World.&quot; By 1910 two trips each way were running every day; later three were run on Sundays. Third-class Pullman cars began running on Sunday 12 September 1915 from Victoria to Brighton and Eastbourne.

===Stopping trains===
Slower passenger services between London and the south coast often divided at East Croydon to serve both the London termini, and combined there for down trains, so East Croydon had an important nodal function in the system. After 1867, following the opening of the direct line to Horsham, Sutton acted as a similar node for passenger trains between London and Portsmouth.

===Slip coaches===
The LB&amp;SCR appears to have invented the practice of slipping coaches from the rear of express trains at intermediate stations for onward transmission to branch lines or smaller stations on the main line. The earliest recorded example was at Haywards Heath in February 1858, where coaches for Hastings were slipped from a London–Brighton express. The slipping was coordinated by a series of communication bell signals between the guards on the two portions of the train and the locomotive crew.

Before 1914, twenty-one coaches were slipped each day on the Brighton main line. Coaches were slipped at Horley and Three Bridges for stations to East Grinstead, Forest Row and Horsham, or at Haywards Heath for stations to Brighton and Eastbourne. The practice continued until the electrification of the main line in 1932.

===London suburban traffic===
After 1870, the LB&amp;SCR greatly encouraged commuters into London by reducing the prices of season tickets and introducing special &quot;workmen&#x27;s trains&quot; for manual workers in that year. By May 1890 the company was operating 10,773 trains into its London termini each month, more than any other company. This growth changed the character of the railway and had a profound influence upon its motive power policy and passenger train services. In the 1870s and 1880s it led to the building of new standard tank engine classes such as the &quot;Terrier&quot; and D1 classes under William Stroudley. R. J. Billinton replaced these with the D3, E3, E4, and E5 classes designed for London suburban services, during the 1890s. When steam locomotives became unable to cope with the increased suburban traffic and competition from electric trams in the early 20th century, it resulted in the electrification of the London suburban network.

===Excursion and holiday traffic===

Excursion trains from London to the South Coast and the Sussex countryside had been introduced in 1844, and were a feature of the LB&amp;SCR throughout its existence. Special fares to Brighton and other south coast resorts on summer Sundays and at bank holidays were regularly advertised in the press. Likewise, special trains serving the regular fetes and exhibitions at Crystal Palace during the summer months.

After 1870 the LB&amp;SCR sought to develop the holiday and excursion trade and market other south coast resorts such as Hayling Island and the Isle of Wight as holiday destinations, by publishing a range of attractive posters. On the Isle of Wight the LB&amp;SCR and the L&amp;SWR jointly took over the ferry service from Portsmouth and built new pier at Ryde with a short line to the station at St John&#x27;s Road in 1880. During the 1900s the company ran special Sunday trains to enable London cyclists to explore the Sussex and Surrey countryside. By 1905 the railway was offering day trips to Dieppe and circular tickets, valid for a month, to enable Londoners to explore towns along the South Coast.

In 1904 the Great Western Railway inaugurated holiday trains during the summer months from Birkenhead to Brighton and Eastbourne, in conjunction with the LB&amp;SCR. The following year LB&amp;SCR and L&amp;NWR jointly operated the &quot;Sunny South Special&quot; from Liverpool and Manchester to these destinations. These trains operated via the West London lines, with the LB&amp;SCR responsible for their operation from Kensington or Willesden.

The LB&amp;SCR served important Horse racing tracks at Brighton, Epsom, Gatwick, Goodwood, Lewes, Lingfield and Plumpton, and Portsmouth Park (Farlington). Race day special trains were an important source of revenue during the summer months.

===Rail motor services===
During the first few years of the 20th century the LB&amp;SCR, in common with other railways, became concerned about losses on branch and short-distance passenger services, particularly in winter. The L&amp;SWR and the LB&amp;SCR boards decided to investigate the use of steam powered railcars on the joint branch line between Fratton and East Southsea, in June 1903. The locomotive and carriage units were both built by the L&amp;SWR, but one of the carriages was painted in the LB&amp;SCR livery. The two vehicles had to be quickly withdrawn as they were found to be chronically underpowered, but were rebuilt with larger boilers and thereafter gave adequate service. However, their use did not stem the loss of traffic to the roads and in 1914 the branch was closed.

Nevertheless, the LB&amp;SCR directors asked the Chief Mechanical Engineer, Robert Billinton, to investigate the use of steam or petrol railcars on lightly used services. Billinton died in 1904, before examples could be acquired, but in 1905 his successor Douglas Earle Marsh acquired two steam railcars from Beyer, Peacock and Company and two petrol railcars from Dick, Kerr &amp; Co. These were compared with small steam locomotives of the Stroudley A1 and D1 classes fitted for &quot;motor train&quot; or &quot;push-pull&quot; working. Neither type of railcar was successful, being inadequate to cope with traffic fluctuations between winter and summer, but the &quot;motor trains&quot; could be adapted by the addition or removal of extra coaches. As a result, the experiment provided a new lease of life for the Stroudley tank classes, which continued to be used on branch lines for many years after their withdrawal from suburban services. The steam railcars were sold in 1919, and the petrol railcars were used for departmental (non-revenue-earning) purposes during the erection of the catenary for the overhead electrification of the London suburban lines.

During the experiments relating to railcars and &quot;motor trains&quot;, the LB&amp;SCR constructed unmanned halts, such as Lyons Crossing Halt and Littlehaven Halt on the Arun Valley Line, in an attempt to increase passenger revenue.

===Freight services===
Freight represented a relatively small part of the LB&amp;SCR&#x27;s finances during its first half century. Agricultural goods and general merchandise were carried, together with wine, foodstuffs and manufactured goods imported from France. During the 1870s the pattern of goods services slowly began to change, leading to rapid growth in the 1890s, &#x27;caused by the transport of raw materials and finished products of entirely new industries such as petroleum, cement, brick and tile manufacture, forestry and biscuit making.&#x27; This resulted in the construction of 55 goods locomotives of the C2 class

There were no coal mines within LB&amp;SCR territory, and so it had to pay substantially more for its fuel than most other companies. The bulk of its coal was brought in trains from Acton yard on the Great Western Railway to Three Bridges for redistribution, and the LB&amp;SCR kept two goods locomotives at the GWR Westbourne Park Depot for this purpose. In 1898 there was a scheme to develop Deptford Wharf for the landing of coal by sea. The additional fuel costs were partially offset by the sale of shingle for rail ballast from Pevensey.

The main London goods depot was at &#x27;Willow Walk&#x27;, part of the Bricklayers Arms complex, where the LB&amp;SCR established its facilities in 1849. These were enlarged in 1854 after it entered into an agreement with the LC&amp;DR to handle its goods traffic. Further extensions were built in 1865 and 1902. There were also freight handling facilities at Battersea and Deptford Wharves, and New Cross in London and the railway constructed a marshalling yard to the south of Norwood Junction during the 1870s, extended in the early 1880s. Other freight handling facilities outside London were at: Brighton (where there was a separate goods station at, adjacent to the passenger station), Eastbourne, Hastings, Littlehampton, Portsmouth, Newhaven, Seaford, and Three Bridges.

==Electrification==
Proposals for a &quot;London and Brighton Electric Railway&quot; made to Parliament in 1900 failed to proceed, but caused the LB&amp;SCR to consider electrification. Also, competition from the introduction of trams in London meant that annual traffic over the circuitous route between Victoria and London Bridge stations had dropped from 8 million to 3 million journeys by 1908. Because of the nature of its traffic with a very large number of commuter journeys over relatively short distances, the railway was an obvious candidate for electrification, and had sought powers for suburban lines in 1903. Third and fourth rail direct current electrification had been chosen for the underground tube railways and the Metropolitan Railway and District Railway in London, the Mersey Railway in Liverpool and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Liverpool to line. However the LB&amp;SCR foresaw electrification of its main line, and ultimately to Portsmouth and Hastings, and therefore decided on a high-tension overhead supply system at 6,600 volts AC.

Although the Midland Railway line from Lancaster to Morecambe and Heysham had been the first to use overhead lines, the LB&amp;SCR lines covered a far greater length of track. This system was of German origin and the contractor for the electrical equipment was Allgemeine Elektricitäts Gesellschaft of Berlin, while the main contractor was Robert W Blackwell &amp; Co Ltd. Power supply was from the London Electric Supply Corporation (LESCo) at Deptford.

The first section was the South London line connecting London Bridge with Victoria via Denmark Hill, opened on 1 December 1909. It was marketed as &#x27;The Elevated Electric&#x27; and was an immediate success. Traffic on the line grew from 3 to 10 million journeys per year. Other routes followed: on 12 May 1911 Victoria–Crystal Palace via Balham and West Norwood, followed on 3 March 1912 by the line from Peckham Rye to West Norwood. Repair shops were established at Peckham Rye, and carriage sheds at Norwood Junction.

Continued success and profitability of its earliest projects caused the LB&amp;SCR to decide to electrify all remaining London suburban lines in 1913. However, the outbreak of war the following year delayed what was planned to have been considerable further mileage of electrified line. By 1921 most of the inner London suburban lines were electrified, and during 1922 lines to Coulsdon and Sutton, opened on 1 April 1925. During 1920 plans were drawn up to extend the &#x27;Elevated Electric&#x27; to Brighton, Worthing, Eastbourne, Newhaven and Seaford, and to Epsom and Oxted, but these were overtaken by the Grouping.

The &#x27;Elevated Electric&#x27; proved to be a technical and financial success, but was short-lived since the L&amp;SWR had adopted the third-rail system: its mileage far exceeded that of the LB&amp;SCR. In 1926 the Southern Railway announced that, as part of a huge electrification project, all overhead lines were to be converted to third rail, thus bringing all lines into a common system. The last overhead electric train ran on 22 September 1929.

==Accidents and signalling control==
Semaphore signalling and signal boxes were first introduced on the L&amp;CR and had been adopted by the L&amp;BR as early as the 1840s. There were a number of serious accidents in the early years of the LB&amp;SCR, some due to failures in communication. The LB&amp;SCR began to improve its safety record in the 1860s with the introduction of interlocking, and the early introduction of Westinghouse air brakes. Given the large number of junctions and the intensive use of its system, the LB&amp;SCR maintained a good safety record during the last half century of its existence.

The following accidents occurred on the LB&amp;SCR:
*On 6 June 1851, there was a derailment at Falmer Bank, East Sussex due to an object on the line.
*On 27 November 1851, passenger train from Brighton ran into the eighth wagon of a goods train that had just left , station, West Sussex, due to the passenger train passing a signal at danger.
*On 17 March 1853, the boiler of locomotive No. 10 exploded at Brighton, East Sussex.
*On 27 August 1853, confusion over a warning signal at New Cross caused a goods train to collide with an empty passenger train, resulting in the death of a fireman
*On 21 August 1854, there was an accident at , Surrey due to numerous causes, resulting in three fatalities and eleven injured.
*On 3 October 1859, the boiler of a locomotive exploded at Falmer Incline.
*On 25 August 1861, in the accident known as the Clayton Tunnel rail crash, an excursion train ran into the rear of another inside Clayton Tunnel, West Sussex due to a combination of the failure of an automatic signal to return to &#x27;danger&#x27; and culpable operating errors. At the time, this was the deadliest accident up to that time in the United Kingdom with 23 killed and 176 injured.
*On 29 May 1863, there was a derailment at Streatham Common, Surrey. Four people (including the driver) were killed 59 people were injured.
*On 23 June 1869, two trains collided at New Cross Gate, Surrey due to driver error, excessive speed and guard error, injuring 91 people.
*On 27 September 1879, the boiler of a locomotive exploded at , East Sussex. One person was killed and two were injured.
*On 1 May 1891, in the accident known as the Norwood Junction rail accident, a cast-iron bridge collapsed under a train at Norwood Junction, Surrey. Six people were injured.
*On 23 July 1894, a brake van next to the engine hauling the 6.35pm from derailed at Farlington Halt railway station and the first two coaches overturned. The guard on the train was killed and seven passengers were injured.
*On 1 September 1897, a passenger train derailed near Heathfield, East Sussex. One person was killed.
*On 23 December 1899, a Brighton train passed a signal at danger and ran into the back of a boat train express in thick fog at Keymer Junction, West Sussex. There were six fatalities and 20 injured.
*In 1904, a freight train hauled by D1 class No. 239 &quot;Patcham&quot; was derailed at Cocking, West Sussex.
*On 29 January 1910, an express passenger train became divided and was derailed at Stoat&#x27;s Nest, Surrey due to a defective wheelset on a carriage. Seven people were killed and 65 were injured.
*On 21 October 1913, seven labourers were working a night shift at London Bridge station, scraping and cleaning the cradles and insulator fittings of the overhead line equipment. The wire brush of one of the men, labourer Amos Boniface, touched one of the electrical wires and he suffered severe burns. Boniface died 19 days later from his injuries.
*On 3 April 1916, a passenger train was derailed between and stations, East Sussex.
*On 18 April 1918, a freight train became divided, the rear part coming to rest inside Redhill Tunnel, Surrey. Due to a signalman&#x27;s error, another freight train ran into the wagons and was derailed. A third freight train ran into the wreckage.

===Signalling and signal boxes===

The LB&amp;SCR originally used semaphore for home signals and &#x27;double disc&#x27; for distant signals, but after 1872 semaphore signals were used for both purposes.

The LB&amp;SCR was using primitive interlocking between signals at some junctions by 1844. In 1856, John Saxby, an LB&amp;SCR carpenter, patented a form of manual interlocking of the points and signals, first tried at Bricklayers Arms that year. The first fully interlocking frame was installed by Saxby at Keymer Junction near Haywards Heath in 1860, where he built a small workshop to undertake private work. He left the company and in 1862 formed Saxby &amp; Farmer signalling contractors. Thereafter the LB&amp;SC patronised Saxby &amp; Farmer for most of its signalling until circa 1880. Thereafter it adopted the Sykes &#x27;Lock and block&#x27; system used on the LC&amp;DR.

The LB&amp;SCR inherited the world&#x27;s first signal boxes, at Bricklayers Arms Junction and Brighton Junction (Norwood). After 1880 it gradually developed its own architecture for signal boxes, using home-produced and contractor-built frames. J. E. Annett, the inventor of Annett&#x27;s key in 1875, a portable form of interlocking, was a former LB&amp;SCR employee.

During the remodelling of Victoria Station between 1898 and 1908 it was resignalled using the Sykes electromechanical method for controlling points and signals, allowing for more compact signal boxes.

==Rolling stock==
For the greater part of its existence the LB&amp;SCR relied upon steam locomotives for motive power, and it owned no diesel or electric locomotives. The electrified lines were worked by electric multiple units for passenger traffic and by steam for freight. It experimented with two petrol railcars in 1906 and 1907, but these proved to be underpowered and highly unreliable and were soon taken out of traffic.

The LB&amp;SCR under Stroudley was one of the first railways in Britain to adopt the Westinghouse air brake after 1877 in preference to the far less effective vacuum brakes employed by its neighbours.

===Steam locomotives===
The LB&amp;SCR inherited 51 steam locomotives from the Brighton, Croydon and Dover Joint Committee, and it built or purchased 1,055 locomotives. Of these, 620 were handed over to the Southern Railway on 1 January 1923.

The LB&amp;SCR achieved early fame as the first railway to use the &quot;Jenny Lind&quot; locomotive in 1847, designed by David Joy, the Chief Draughtsman of the E. B. Wilson and Company of Leeds, later widely used by other railways. The policy of John Chester Craven, Locomotive Superintendent from 1847 to 1869, was to design locomotives for each task or type of traffic. Many of his designs were capable locomotives, but with 72 different classes in use at the time of William Stroudley&#x27;s appointment in 1870, the policy was hopelessly uneconomic.

Stroudley reduced this to 12 main classes, many with interchangeable parts, by 1888. He introduced a number of extremely successful and long-lived designs, notably the A1 (&#x27;Terrier&#x27;) and E1 classes , and the D1 class , the powerful G class &#x27;singles&#x27; and the B1 &#x27;Gladstone&#x27; class express passenger locomotives. Less successful were his C and C1 classes of 1871 and 1882 respectively, both of which proved to be underpowered as the volume of freight traffic grew towards the end of the century. Stroudley&#x27;s locomotives were all limited to six wheels, and he never used bogies largely because of the limitations imposed by turntables, notably at Victoria. The high price of coal encouraged him to experiment with condensing apparatus.

Stroudley&#x27;s successor R. J. Billinton continued the process of standardisation of locomotive parts until his death in 1904, thereby reducing maintenance costs. He introduced eight-wheeled designs in the form of express locomotives of the B4 class and the D3 class , for use on London suburban services. He also introduced a very successful and versatile series of four tank engine classes with radial axles for both passenger and freight duties. Of less success was his freight locomotives of the C2 class.

D.E. Marsh continued the process of building larger locomotives with the H1 class of express passenger locomotives of 1905, based on a former Great Northern railway design. A superheated version was introduced in 1911. Marsh was also responsible for the design of four of classes (I1-I4) but of these, only the I3 class were successful, being described by Klaus Marx as &#x27;wonder engines&#x27;. This class was also instrumental in demonstrating the benefits of superheating to locomotive engineers in Britain. Marsh also designed a class of 4-6-2 tank engines, and a very poor C3 class of , freight locomotives, which proved to perform worse than the locomotives they were due to replace. However, he found that by rebuilding Billinton&#x27;s unsuccessful C2 class with his newly designed C3 boiler he was at last able to produce a successful freight design for the railway in the form of the C2X class.

The last Chief Mechanical Engineer was L.B. Billinton, who designed the powerful K class mixed-traffic locomotives and the LB&amp;SCR E2 class in 1913, and the L class 4-6-4 tanks of 1914. All of these designs were successful but his career was cut short by the First World War and the grouping of British railways. According to D.L. Bradley, the railway handed over &quot;a nicely balanced stock of locomotives well-suited to the demands of the Brighton section&quot; to the Southern Railway at grouping in 1923.

LB&amp;SCR locomotive designs had little impact on the locomotive policy of the Southern Railway after 1923 because they were built to a more generous loading gauge and had Westinghouse air brakes unlike the two other main constituent companies. Although the designs were not perpetuated, the originals proved to be particularly long-lived. 62.8% of locomotives inherited by the Southern Railway were still in use at the nationalisation of British Railways in 1948, compared with 57.9% for the L&amp;SWR and 56.8% for the SE&amp;CR.

===Electric traction===
The electrified lines were operated by electric multiple units. These were originally three-car units, with a trailer sandwiched between motor cars, later converted into two-car units with one driving motor car and one driving trailer. New classes of multiple unit were developed for each electrified line, known as the South London stock and the Crystal Palace stock. A third type, the Coulsdon and Wallington stock was planned by the LB&amp;SCR but introduced by the Southern Railway. 

===Coaching stock===

The jobs of Locomotive Superintendent and Carriage and wagon superintendent were combined until the retirement of D. E. Marsh in 1911. As a result, the LB&amp;SCR was never at the forefront of carriage development for its ordinary coaching stock, and as late as the mid-1860s was still building open-side 3rd class carriages. Stroudley introduced four-wheeled and later six-wheeled designs which lasted for 40 years, and shortly before his death in 1889 he introduced a few bogie carriages for the main business trains. Stroudley was a pioneer of dynamo-driven electric lighting and communication cords. The LB&amp;SCR introduced breakfast cars to its main business trains.

The appointment of Albert Panter as Carriage and Wagon Works Manager under Robert Billinton in 1898 (Carriage and Wagon Superintendent from 1912) led to the introduction of bogie carriages for mainline trains in 1905, but suburban services were operated by six-wheeled &quot;block trains&quot; with solid wooden buffers, permanently tight coupled in sets of ten or 12. Many of these were still in use at grouping in 1923. Better vehicles appeared early in the 20th century with the &#x27;Balloon stock&#x27; and electric stock.

Sixteen carriages of LB&amp;SCR origin have been preserved, including one luxurious &quot;Directors&#x27; saloon&quot; of 1914: these are principally on the Bluebell Railway and the Isle of Wight Steam Railway. A number of grounded carriage bodies used as holiday homes survive.

===Wagons===
Sixteen wagons formerly in LB&amp;SCR ownership now survive, largely because the Southern Railway transferred them to the Isle of Wight, where they remained in use until the 1960s.

===Liveries===
After 1870 the LB&amp;SCR was renowned for the attractiveness of its locomotives and coaching stock and condition of its country stations. &quot;No company, even the North-Western itself turns out smarter looking trains than the Brighton main line expresses and even some of the suburban trains.&quot;

Between 1846 and 1870 passenger locomotives were painted hunter green with some having black lining. Frames were red, and wheels were black; buffer beams were the regulation &#x27;signal red&#x27;. Goods locomotives were black with red and white lining, except those operating into Brighton or London Bridge, in passenger livery. Some engines had boilers lagged with wooden strips. These were either highly polished mahogany with brass fixings or were painted in alternating stripes of dark green and vermilion. The main shade of green used gradually became darker. By the time Stroudley became Locomotive Superintendent the colour had become a variant of Brunswick Green used by many other companies. Carriages were painted sea green or varnished wood, the latter mainly first class stock.
From 1870 to 1905 the livery was Stroudley&#x27;s famous Improved Engine Green, a golden ochre very similar to that used by his former employer, the Highland Railway. On passenger locomotives Improved Engine Green was finished with olive green borders lined with black, red and white. Frames and buffer beams were carmine red, lined with yellow and black. The wheels were Improved Engine Green with red lining. Cab roofs were white. Goods engines were all-over olive green with black borders, similar to the pre-1870 colours. If fitted with Westinghouse brakes the black borders were edged with red lines. Locomotives with names had the name applied in gold leaf to the tank side on tank locomotives, to a wheel splasher on tender locomotives. The letters were edged with a thin red line and given depth with black shading. This livery was one of the most ornate and distinctive used on British locomotives, and is remembered with nostalgia. Carriages were all mahogany in colour, with white roofs and black chassis gear. Initially the wood of the body was varnished, but as it became harder to maintain a high-quality varnish finish and it was painted in a similar-coloured paint. Panel lining and other details were picked out with gold leaf.

From 1905 to 1923 front-line express locomotives were a dark shade of umber. Lining was black with a gilt line either side. Cab roofs remained white. Frames were black, wheels umber, and buffer beams returned to signal red. The company&#x27;s initials were painted on the tender- or tank-sides (initially &#x27;L.B.&amp; S.C.R.&#x27;, but after 1911 the ampersand and the R were removed) in gilt. Secondary passenger locomotives had the same livery, but instead of gilt lining chrome yellow paint was used. Goods engines were gloss black with double vermilion lining. Names and numbers were in white letters with red shading. Carriages were initially all olive green with white lining and detailing. From 1911 this changed to plain umber with black lettering picked out with gold shading.

==Ferry services and ships==

The LB&amp;SCR invested in cross-channel ferry services, initially from Shoreham to Dieppe. Following the opening of the line to Newhaven in 1847, it improved Newhaven harbour, building a wharf and dredging the channel. A Newhaven–Dieppe service was established in 1847, but discontinued soon afterwards. In 1850 it established a Newhaven–Jersey ferry service, and in 1853 it reinstated the Dieppe service.

The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (New Lines) Act 1862 (25 &amp; 26 Vict. c. lxviii) gave the LB&amp;SCR power to own and operate its own steam vessels, so it instructed Chief Engineer Frederick Banister to greatly expand the port and its facilities. In 1863 the Chemins de Fer de l&#x27;Ouest in France agreed to operate the Newhaven–Dieppe passenger service jointly, advertised as the &quot;shortest and cheapest&quot; route to Paris, but never the quickest because of the much longer time taken at sea than the rival Dover to Calais route. (Newhaven harbour was taken over by the military authorities and the ferries requisitioned for the duration of the First World War.)

In 1863, the LB&amp;SCR transferred the Jersey service to Littlehampton and soon afterwards established another between Littlehampton and Honfleur.

By 1880 lines connected the Ryde Pier and the Portsmouth Harbour ferry terminals. It was therefore a natural progression for the companies to acquire the ferry routes. To do this the LB&amp;SCR and the L&amp;SWR formed the South Western and Brighton Railway Companies Steam Packet Service (SW&amp;BRCSPS), which bought the operators.

In 1884 the Isle of Wight Marine Transit Company started a goods rail ferry between the Hayling Island Branch Line at Langstone and the Bembridge branch line at St Helens quay. The rail ferry PS &quot;Carrier&quot;, designed to carry railway trucks, was moved from Scotland. The project was unsuccessful and, despite being acquired by the LB&amp;SCR in 1886, ended in 1888.

The LB&amp;SCR operated a significant number of ships in its own right, jointly with Chemins de Fer de l&#x27;Ouest, and as a part of the SW&amp;BRCSPS. See List of LB&amp;SCR ships

==Structures, buildings and civil engineering==
The LB&amp;SCR inherited significant structures, buildings and other civil engineering features, including:
*Bridges and viaducts – the Ouse Valley Viaduct, London Road viaduct, the Lewes Road viaduct Moulsecoomb.
*The Norwood Junction flyover, the world&#x27;s first railway overpass.
*Tunnels – Merstham, Balcombe, Haywards Heath, Clayton and Patcham, Ditchling Road (Brighton) and Falmer
*Stations – Modular station buildings at Brighton, Croydon, Redhill and Reigate Road, Horley, Three Bridges and Hassocks, designed by David Mocatta.
===Stations===
The LB&amp;SCR inherited or built 20 termini, the most significant at , Victoria, , Portsmouth Harbour and Eastbourne. Stations at major junctions included Clapham Junction, , , Horsham, and .

The use of Mocatta&#x27;s modular station designs was not perpetuated. During the 1850s and 1860s most stations were constructed according to one or two stock designs prepared by the Chief Engineers, R. Jacomb-Hood and Frederick Banister (1860–1895). Banister had a love of Italianate architecture, meaning that during the 1880s the LB&amp;SCR produced elaborate decorated architecture for many country stations, notably on the Bluebell and Cuckoo Lines. The architect was Banister&#x27;s son-in-law, Thomas Myres.

===Workshops and motive power depots===
The L&amp;BR established a repair workshop at Brighton in 1840. Between 1852 and 1957 more than 1,200 steam locomotives and prototype diesel electric and electric locomotives were constructed there, before closure in 1962. It had small locomotive repair facilities at New Cross and Battersea Park Depots in London.

By the first decade of the 20th century, Brighton works could no longer cope with the repair and building of both locomotives and rolling stock. In 1911 the LB&amp;SCR built a carriage and wagon works at Lancing, which operated until 1965. A marine engineering workshop was established in the mid-1870s at Newhaven.

There were engine sheds at Battersea Park, Brighton, Bognor, Coulsdon, Croydon, Eastbourne, Epsom, Fratton (joint) Horsham, Littlehampton, Midhurst, New Cross, Newhaven, St Leonards, Three Bridges and Tunbridge Wells West.

The headquarters and main offices were at Brighton railway station from 1846 until 1892, when they were transferred to the former &quot;Terminus Hotel&quot; at London Bridge

===Hotels===
The LB&amp;SCR opened the &quot;Terminus Hotel&quot; at London Bridge and the &quot;Grosvenor Hotel&quot; at Victoria in 1861. The first of these was not successful due to its site on the south bank and was turned into offices for the railway in 1892. It was destroyed by bombing in 1941. The &quot;Grosvenor Hotel&quot; was rebuilt and enlarged in 1901. The LB&amp;SCR acquired the &quot;Terminus Hotel&quot; next to Brighton station in 1877, and operated the &quot;London and Paris Hotel&quot; at Newhaven.

==The LB&amp;SCR as an investment==
The 1867 report by the railway found that there had been &#x27;a reckless disregard for shareholders&#x27; interests for many years.&#x27;. As a result, the company policies were several times subjected to criticism in pamphlets published during the 1870s and 1880s. The matter was settled in 1890 when the economist and editor of the Financial Times, William Ramage Lawson, conducted a detailed analysis of the financial performance and prospects of the LB&amp;SCR, comparing it with other British railways. He concluded that the &quot;Brighton Deferred stock&quot; &#x27;combined the highest return on investment, with the best prospect of future appreciation and the smallest risk of retrogression.&#x27; Among the reasons given for this opinion were:
*Well established route and freedom from competition
*Varied and well distributed sources of traffic
*Moderate working expenses due to high quality construction of the original route and good maintenance.
*Energetic and prudent management

From 1870 the LB&amp;SCR appears to have been a well-run, enterprising and profitable railway for its shareholders.

==Industrial relations==

For its time, the LB&amp;SCR was regarded as a good employer. In 1851 it created a benevolent fund for staff who had become incapacitated, and from 1854 operated a savings bank. In 1867 there was a two-day strike involving the drivers and firemen over their working hours, resolved by negotiation. In 1872 a superannuation fund was established for higher grades of staff, extended to become a pension fund for all staff in 1899 under the (62 &amp; 63 Vict. c. liv).

Labour relations between the railway management, locomotive crews and Brighton works staff declined markedly in the period 1905 and 1910 leading to several strikes and sackings. This was partly due to increased union militancy and to the intransigency of the Locomotive Superintendent Douglas Earle Marsh. This situation improved under Marsh&#x27;s successor.

<text>The tropical gar (&quot;Atractosteus tropicus&quot;) is a species of fish from Central America, where it is found in the Pacific and Atlantic drainages from southern Mexico to Costa Rica. In Central America it is known as &quot;gaspar&quot; and in Mexico it is known as &quot;pejelagarto&quot;, a contraction of the words &quot;pez&quot; (fish) and &quot;lagarto&quot; (alligator). This gar inhabits a wide range of fresh and brackish water habitats such as rivers, floodplains, lakes and pools, but avoids areas with a strong current. It reaches lengths of up to (although typically less than half that length) and a weight up to . The tropical gar looks very similar to the longnose gar in color and markings, but can be distinguished by its shorter, broader snout. The tropical gar&#x27;s diet consists mainly of cichlids and other fish.

While gar are not widely eaten, there is a traditional Tabasco dish of the same name that uses chili, limes, and salt to cook the animal.

<text>Jens Christian Bugge Wesseltoft (born 1 February 1964) is a Norwegian jazz pianist, composer, and producer, son of jazz guitarist Erik Wesseltoft.

==Career==


In 1989, Wesseltoft collaborated with the Knut Riisnæs Quartet and was soon after contacted by Arild Andersen to join in on commissioned work for Vossajazz—released on the album &quot;Sagn&quot; (1990)—and the follow-up &quot;Arv&quot; (1993). He worked with Jan Garbarek on his &quot;Molde Canticle&quot;, a commission from Moldejazz, released on the 1990 album &quot;I Took Up the Runes&quot;.

Wesseltoft had an impact on the Norwegian jazz scene at the beginning of the 1990s while going through a transition from Nordic jazz traditions, exemplified by the ECM label, to a style sometimes referred to as &quot;future jazz&quot; or nu jazz. Thereafter, he toured extensively on the international jazz scene, performing both jazz and rock concerts, and on a series of recordings on his own Jazzland label. He collaborated with a series of artists in this period, such as guitarists Terje Rypdal and Jon Eberson, and in the mid-1990s, he toured and recorded the album &quot;Billy Cobham presents Nordic – Off Color&quot;, released in 1999, together with Billy Cobham. For many years, he also collaborated with experimental jazz vocalist Sidsel Endresen and was in the lineup for her commissioned work at Moldejazz in 1993, which was released on the album &quot;Exile&quot; a year later. His own commissioned work &quot;A Little War Story&quot; for Vossajazz was also performed in 1993.

Wesseltoft formed his own band, New Conception of Jazz, in 1995, and their first album, &quot;New Conception of Jazz&quot;, was awarded a Spellemannprisen in 1996, the same year it was released.

Firmly committed to electronic music, Wesseltoft completely eschews acoustic forms and is just as adamant that he will not be tied by genre boundaries, bringing hip hop and other contemporary dance music forms into his concept of contemporary jazz. On the album &quot;Sharing&quot; (1998), many listeners were taken by surprise by his extensive use of club DJs and scratchers.

His track &quot;Existence&quot; can be heard in Philippe Harel&#x27;s movie &quot;Extension du domaine de la lutte&quot;, an adaptation of Michel Houellebecq&#x27;s 1994 novel.

After working with Dan Berglund on his 2014 album &quot;Trialogue&quot;, Wesseltoft founded the jazz trio Rymden, adding Magnus Öström on drums. They had their first appearance at the Nattjazz Festival in Bergen in 2017. According to Wesseltoft, they began work on a debut album after this successful performance. Further appearances followed in 2017 and 2018, and in 2019, Rymden recorded their first album, &quot;Reflections &amp; Odysseys&quot;.

John Kellman of &quot;All About Jazz&quot; magazine noted Wesseltoft&#x27;s solo performance at The Punkt Festival, Kristiansand, Norway, as one of his 25 &quot;Best Live Shows of 2013&quot;.

<text>A foot-candle (sometimes foot candle; abbreviated fc, lm/ft2, or sometimes ft-c) is a non-SI unit of illuminance or light intensity. The foot-candle is defined as one lumen per square foot. This unit is commonly used in lighting layouts in parts of the world where United States customary units are used, mainly the United States. Nearly all of the world uses the corresponding SI derived unit lux, defined as one lumen per square meter.

The foot-candle is defined as the illuminance of the inside surface of a one-foot-radius sphere with a point source of one candela at its center. Alternatively, it can be defined as the illuminance of one lumen on a one-square foot surface with a uniform distribution. Given the relation between candela and lumen, the two definitions listed are identical, with the second one potentially being easier to relate to in some everyday situations.

One foot-candle is equal to approximately 10.764 lux. In many practical applications, as when measuring room illumination, it is often not needed to measure illuminance more accurately than ±10%; in these situations it is sufficient to think of one foot-candle as about ten lux.

==Use==
In the US lighting industry, foot-candles are a common unit of measurement used by architects to calculate adequate lighting levels. Foot-candles are also commonly used in the museum and gallery fields in the US, where lighting levels must be carefully controlled to conserve light-sensitive objects such as prints, photographs, and paintings, the colors of which fade when exposed to bright light for a lengthy period.

In the motion picture cinematography field in the US, incident light meters are used to measure the number of foot-candles present, which are used to calculate the intensity of motion picture lights, allowing cinematographers to set up proper lighting-contrast ratios when filming.

Since light intensity is the primary factor in the photosynthesis of plants, US horticulturalists often measure and discuss optimum intensity for various plants in foot-candles.

==Examples==
Full, unobstructed sunlight has an intensity of up to 930 fc. An overcast day will produce an intensity of around 100 fc. The intensity of light near a window can range from 100 to 460 fc, depending on the orientation of the window, time of year and latitude.

Indoor lighting for residences seeks to provide 5-40 fc for general spaces and 70-90 fc for work spaces.

Lighting requirements for commercial spaces range from 5 fc for storage spaces to 200 fc for visually intensive work.

<doc id="508579" wikidata="Q927057" url="?curid=508579" title="Jack Haley">
<text>John Joseph Haley Jr. (August 10, 1898 – June 6, 1979) was an American actor, comedian, dancer, radio host, singer, drummer and vaudevillian. He was best known for his portrayal of the Tin Man and his farmhand counterpart Hickory in the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

==Early life==
Haley was born in Boston, Massachusetts on August 10, 1898. His father John Joseph Haley Sr. was a waiter by trade, and later a ship&#x27;s steward. He died in the wreck of the schooner &quot;Charles A. Briggs&quot; at Nahant, Massachusetts on February 1, 1898, aged 31, when Jack wasn&#x27;t born yet. He had one older brother, William Anthony &quot;Bill&quot; Haley, a musician, who developed pneumonia which caused tuberculosis, and he died in 1915 at the age of twenty.

==Career==

Haley headlined in vaudeville as a song-and-dance comedian. One of his closest friends was Fred Allen, who would frequently mention &quot;Mr. Jacob Haley of Newton Highlands, Massachusetts&quot; on the air. Haley made a few phonograph records in 1923, and in the early 1930s starred in comedy shorts for Vitaphone in Brooklyn, New York. His wide-eyed, good-natured expression gained him supporting roles in musical feature films, including &quot;Poor Little Rich Girl&quot; with Shirley Temple, &quot;Higher and Higher&quot; with Frank Sinatra and the Irving Berlin musical &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;. Both &quot;Poor Little Rich Girl&quot; and &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; were released by Twentieth Century-Fox. Haley was under contract to them and appeared in the Fox films &quot;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm&quot; and &quot;Pigskin Parade&quot;, marking his first appearance with Judy Garland.
Haley hosted a radio show from 1937 to 1939 known to many as &quot;The Jack Haley Show&quot;. The first season (1937–1938), the show was sponsored by Log Cabin Syrup and was known as &quot;The Log Cabin Jamboree&quot;. The next season (1938–1939), the show was sponsored by Wonder Bread and was known as &quot;The Wonder Show&quot;. During the second season the show featured Gale Gordon and Lucille Ball as regular radio performers.

Haley returned to musical comedies in the 1940s. Most of his &#x27;40s work was for RKO Radio Pictures. He left the studio in 1947 when he refused to appear in a remake of RKO&#x27;s &quot;Seven Keys to Baldpate&quot;. Phillip Terry took the role. He subsequently went into real estate, taking guest roles in television series over the next couple of decades. 

===&quot;The Tin Man&quot; in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;===
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer hired Haley for the part of the Tin Man in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. He replaced song-and-dance comedian Buddy Ebsen, who had suffered a severe allergic reaction after inhaling aluminum powder from his silver face makeup, which triggered a congenital bronchial condition; the dust settled in Ebsen&#x27;s lungs and, within a few days of principal photographic testing, he found himself struggling to breathe. For Haley, to avoid the same problem, the dust was converted into a paste—even so, the paste caused an eye infection that sidelined Haley for four shooting days. Surgical treatment averted serious or permanent damage to Haley&#x27;s eyes. Haley also portrayed the Tin Man&#x27;s Kansas counterpart, Hickory Twicker, one of Aunt Em and Uncle Henry&#x27;s farmhands.

Haley did not remember the makeup or the costume fondly. Interviewed about the film years later by Tom Snyder, he related that many fans assumed making the film was a fun experience. Haley said, &quot;Like hell it was. It was work!&quot; For his role as the Tin Woodman, Haley spoke in the same soft tone he used when reading bedtime stories to his children. &quot;Oz&quot; was one of only three films Haley made for MGM. The others were &quot;Pick a Star&quot;, a 1937 Hal Roach production distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and &quot;Mr. Cinderella&quot; in 1936.

==Personal life==

Haley was raised Roman Catholic. He was a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California. His nephew Bob Dornan served as a Republican congressman for California.

===Final years and death===
On June 1, 1979, Haley suffered a heart attack. He died on June 6, 1979, at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles at the age of 80. His funeral was held at the Church of the Good Shepherd and the eulogy was given by Ray Bolger who concluded it by saying, &quot;It&#x27;s going to be awfully lonely on that Yellow Brick Road now, Jack.&quot;

Haley is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City, California.

Haley&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Heart of the Tin Man&quot;, was published in 2000.

<text>Newton Diehl Baker Jr. (December 3, 1871 – December 25, 1937) was an American lawyer, Georgist, politician, and government official. He served as the 37th mayor of Cleveland, Ohio from 1912 to 1915. As U.S. Secretary of War from 1916 to 1921, Baker presided over the United States Army during World War I.

Born in Martinsburg, West Virginia, Baker established a legal practice in Cleveland after graduating from Washington and Lee University School of Law. He became a progressive Democratic ally of Mayor Tom L. Johnson. Baker served as city solicitor of Cleveland from 1901 to 1909 before taking office as mayor in 1912. As mayor, he sought public transit reform, hospital improvement, and city beautification. Baker supported Woodrow Wilson at the 1912 Democratic National Convention, helping Wilson win the votes of the Ohio delegation. After leaving office, Baker accepted appointment as Secretary of War under President Wilson. He was one of several prominent Georgists appointed to positions in the Wilson Cabinet.

Baker presided over the U.S. military&#x27;s participation in World War I. He selected General John J. Pershing to command the American Expeditionary Forces, which he insisted act as an independent unit. He left office in 1921 and returned to BakerHostetler, the legal practice he co-founded. He served as an attorney in &quot;Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.&quot;, a landmark case that established the constitutionality of zoning laws. He was a strong supporter of the League of Nations and continued to advocate American participation in the League during the 1920s. Beginning in 1928, he served as a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration. He was a candidate for the presidential nomination at the 1932 Democratic National Convention, but the convention chose Franklin D. Roosevelt.

==Early years==
Newton Diehl Baker was born on December 3, 1871, in Martinsburg, West Virginia, the son of Newton Diehl Baker Sr. and Mary Ann (Dukehart) Baker. Baker&#x27;s grandfather, Elias Baker, was a staunch unionist, his father, on the contrary, joined the Confederate Army, served as a cavalryman, was wounded, and became a northern prisoner of war. After returning home in 1865, he obtained a medical degree from the University of Maryland Medical School and worked as a physician in Martinsburg until his death in 1906.

Baker attended the village schools in Martinsburg through his second year in high school and finished his preparatory training at Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia.

In 1892, Baker graduated with bachelor&#x27;s degree from Johns Hopkins University, where he was a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. He attended lectures of Woodrow Wilson, who was a visiting professor at the time. After receiving his law degree from Washington and Lee University School of Law in 1894, he tried for a year to establish law practice in Martinsburg, and then became private secretary to Postmaster General William L. Wilson, who served in the Confederate cavalry with Baker&#x27;s father. He stayed in Washington, D.C. until June 1897, then took a vacation in Europe, and returned to Martinsburg. In January 1899, he became a junior partner at Foran, McTigne and Baker in Cleveland.

Baker was small and thin. He was rejected for military service in the Spanish–American War because of poor eyesight.

==Cleveland politics==
When Baker moved to Cleveland, his political sympathies belonged to the Democratic Party; he supported the so-called &quot;Gold Democrats&quot; and their platform of gold standard, free trade, and civil service reform. He built a successful legal career and became involved in local politics. He helped the Democratic candidate Tom L. Johnson to become the mayor of Cleveland, and under his mentorship started his own public career. Johnson was a passionate advocate of Georgist political progressivism. Baker became exposed to Johnson&#x27;s politics and also became a Georgist. He assisted Johnson in his fights against city&#x27;s utility monopolies, e.g., Cleveland Electric Railway Company owned by Mark Hanna, which made Baker popular among Clevelanders.

After serving as city solicitor from 1901 to 1909, he became mayor of the city in 1911. As a city official, Baker&#x27;s main interests were providing Cleveland with electricity (he built a municipal light plant), public transit reform, hospital improvement, and city beautification. He was a strong backer of Cleveland College, now a part of Case Western Reserve University. He and Augustus Raymond Hatton helped draft Ohio&#x27;s home rule amendment. Its approval by voters in 1912 was Baker&#x27;s crowning achievement as a mayor. It granted Cleveland a right to draw its own charter and conduct the city business without state interference.

When Baker worked on Wilson&#x27;s behalf at the Democratic National Convention in Baltimore in 1912, he was considered as a possible vice-presidential contender. He and Wilson had been acquaintances since they were both at Johns Hopkins in the 1890s, and Baker played a vital role during Wilson&#x27;s Democratic nomination for president at the convention by securing votes from Ohio delegates. Wilson wanted to bring him to Washington D.C. Though offered the post twice, Baker declined to serve as United States Secretary of the Interior during President Wilson&#x27;s first term.

A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Baker as the eigteenth-best American big-city mayor to have served between the years 1820 and 1993. 

In 1916, following his tenure as mayor of Cleveland, Baker and two other partners founded the law firm of BakerHostetler.

==Secretary of War==

As the United States considered whether to enter World War I, President Woodrow Wilson had named Baker Secretary of War on 9 March 1916, because Baker was acceptable to advocates and opponents of American participation in the conflict. The post also required legal expertise because of the War Department&#x27;s role in administering the Philippines, the Panama Canal, and Puerto Rico. The &quot;New York Times&quot; called him a &quot;warm supporter&quot; of the President. At 44, he was the youngest member of the Cabinet. The American entry into World War I occurred in April 1917.

One historian described his relationship to the military:


As Secretary of War, Baker presided over the American military participation in the First World War in 1917 and 1918, including the creation of a nationwide military draft. Baker selected Gen. John J. Pershing to head the American Expeditionary Forces. At Baker&#x27;s insistence, Wilson made the American forces an independent fighting partner of the Allies against the Central Powers, rather than letting American troops be used to replenish British and French forces as those nations advised. At one meeting with British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, Baker told him that &quot;if we want advice as to who should command our armies, we would ask for it. But until then we do not want nor need it from anyone, least of all you.&quot;

On December 15, 1917, a War Council was formed (as distinct from the Council of National Defense) consisting of the Secretary of War, his Assistant, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, the Quartermaster General of the United States Army, the Chief of Ordnance and possibly others. The War Council was to oversee and coordinate all matters of supply and to plan for the effective use of the military power of the nation. Baker had inherited a supply chain problem of gargantuan proportions although at first in April the administration knew nothing of its scale. Problems began quickly to crop up and on 18 December, three days after its formation, Baker fired three of the five officers appointed to the War Council. He appointed George Washington Goethals as Quartermaster General on that day.

He was occasionally attacked by military professionals who thought him incompetent or a pacifist at heart. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m so much of a pacifist, I&#x27;m willing to fight for it.&quot;

In 1917, Baker was elected an honorary member of the Virginia Society of the Cincinnati..

In 1918, Wilson told Baker that he hoped he would follow him into the White House in 1920..

Emmett Jay Scott served as Baker&#x27;s Special Advisor of Black Affairs.

==Later years==
After stepping down as Secretary of War in 1921, Baker returned to practicing law at Baker &amp; Hostetler.

For several years he was the leading proponent of American participation in the League of Nations.

In 1922, the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; published a brief account of Baker&#x27;s life that drew sharp criticism. It said, in part, &quot;The charge of pacifism was often brought against him and his career generally as Secretary was widely condemned throughout the United States.&quot; Among the prominent names who called the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; to account were Livingston Farrand of Cornell and Ernest M. Hopkins of Dartmouth.

At the 1924 Democratic National Convention, during discussion of the party platform, Baker was the principal advocate of language committing the party to American membership in the League of Nations. After losing in the platform committee, which advocated a national referendum on the question, he raised the issue on the floor of the convention.
Though he had no chance of winning over the delegates to support his position, he delivered a speech that was the highlight of the convention, &quot;political oratory at its peak&quot; according to an exhaustive account of the convention: &quot;According to reporters, men and women everywhere burst into tears. It was a &quot;tour de force&quot;, emotional and bordering on hysteria.&quot; He drew upon memories of Wilson, who had died just five months earlier and pleaded for a return to Wilsonian idealism:

When his allotted 20 minutes expired, the crowd roared for him to continue. After an hour he left the lectern to a tremendous ovation. Speakers who tried to argue against him were booed. Yet the final vote went against him by a margin of more than 2 to 1. According to a &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial,

For a moment that vast audience was lifted from partisan thoughts to heights from which it could have a glimpse of the promised land of peace. ... Not only did Mr. Baker do his best, but he made one of the best and most moving speeches heard of late in any political meeting. He showed himself a disciple worthy to wear his master&#x27;s mantle. He too has the spirit of prophecy upon him.

Later at the convention, he nominated former Governor James M. Cox of Ohio as his state&#x27;s &quot;favorite son.&quot;

In 1928, President Coolidge appointed Baker a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration of The Hague, and he was reappointed to another six-year term by Roosevelt in 1935. In 1929, President Herbert Hoover appointed Baker to the Wickersham Commission on issues relating to law enforcement, criminal activity, police brutality, and Prohibition.

He remained active in Democratic Party affairs and was considered as a serious prospect for the Democratic nomination for President in 1932, when he declined to announce his candidacy but worked behind the scenes in the hope of being chosen if Franklin D. Roosevelt failed to win the nomination.

Yale University awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws in 1932.

Baker argued before the U.S. Supreme Court as counsel for the property owner in &quot;Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.&quot;, a landmark case that established the constitutionality of zoning laws.

Baker served on the Board of Trustees of Johns Hopkins University beginning in 1918 and was considered for appointment as president of the institution in 1928.

In 1936, he resigned as a member of the Cuyahoga County Democratic Committee after serving for 26 years. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society that same year.

He published a lecture in pamphlet form as &quot;War in the Modern World&quot; in 1935.

==Personal life==

Baker married Elizabeth Wells Leopold, a faculty member at Wilson College, on July 5, 1902. They had two daughters (Margaret and Elizabeth) and a son, Newton D. Baker III, all of whom survived him, as did five grandchildren.

Confined to his bed after December 3, 1937, because of a longstanding heart condition, Baker died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Shaker Heights, Ohio, on Christmas Day, December 25, 1937. After lying in state with full military honors at Trinity Cathedral and a simple funeral at the family&#x27;s request, Baker was buried in Lake View Cemetery. His wife died on August 24, 1951.

==Legacy==
During World War II the Liberty ship was built in Panama City, Florida, and named in his honor.

In 1957 Western Reserve University, now Case Western Reserve, erected the Newton D. Baker Building in his honor. Located on the corner of Adelbert and Euclid, across from Severance Hall, it served as a large unit of general purpose classrooms and administrative offices. The building was torn down in November 2004.

The Georgetown mansion Baker occupied while Secretary of War, now known as Newton D. Baker House, is on the National Register of Historic Places.

The law firm he founded, Baker Hostetler, is one of the nation&#x27;s 100 largest firms.

Baker High School and Newton D. Baker School of Arts located on W. 159th Street in West Park, Cleveland are both named after Baker. A dormitory at Ohio State University, dedicated in 1940, is named Baker Hall (see information about the building) in his honor. The Newton D. Baker dormitory at Washington and Lee University is also named for him. The Veterans Administration Hospital in his hometown of Martinsburg WV was originally named the Newton D. Baker Hospital and is still referred to as such by local residents.

<text>Elmore Rual &quot;Rip&quot; Torn Jr. (February 6, 1931 – July 9, 2019) was an American actor whose career spanned roughly 60 years. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for playing Marsh Turner in &quot;Cross Creek&quot; (1983). Torn&#x27;s portrayal of Artie the producer on &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; (1993–1998) received six Emmy Award nominations, winning in 1996. Torn is also known for his roles as Judas Iscariot in &quot;King of Kings&quot; (1961), Thomas J. Finley, Jr. in &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; (1962), Dr. Nathan Bryce in &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; (1976), Bob Diamond in &quot;Defending Your Life&quot; (1991), Zeus in &quot;Hercules&quot; (1997), Zed in the &quot;Men in Black&quot; franchise (1997, 2002), Jim Brody in &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; (2001), Patches O&#x27;Houlihan in &quot;&quot; (2004), and Louis XV in &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (2006).

== Early life ==
Elmore Rual Torn Jr. was born on February 6, 1931, in Temple, Texas, the son of Elmore Rual “Tiger” Torn Sr., and Thelma Mary Torn (née Spacek). The senior Elmore was an agriculturalist and economist who worked to promote the consumption of black-eyed peas, particularly as a custom on New Year&#x27;s Day. Thelma was an aunt of actress Sissy Spacek. The family is of German, Austrian, and Czech/Moravian ancestry. The nickname &quot;Rip&quot; is a family tradition among men in the Torn family, having been used by his father, uncle, and a cousin. Torn graduated from Taylor High School in Taylor, Texas, in 1948.

Torn was a member of the Texas A&amp;M University Corps of Cadets, although he graduated from the University of Texas where he studied acting under the Shakespeare professor B. Iden Payne, and was a member of the Alpha Nu chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity. After graduation, he served in the Korean War with the 2nd Infantry Division with the military police in the United States Army.

== Career ==
=== Film and television ===
After moving to Hollywood, Torn made his film debut in the 1956 film &quot;Baby Doll&quot;. Torn then studied at the Actors Studio in New York under Lee Strasberg, becoming a prolific stage actor, appearing in the original cast of Tennessee Williams&#x27; play &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot;, and reprising the role in the film and television adaptations. Torn later helped his younger cousin Sissy Spacek enroll in the Actors Studio. He also appeared in the first production of his friend James Baldwin&#x27;s &quot;Blues For Mister Charlie&quot;. Along with Baldwin and numerous mutual friends he was active in the Civil Rights movement from the &#x27;50s forward, as Baldwin&#x27;s biographer David Leeming relates.

One of Torn&#x27;s earliest roles was in &quot;Pork Chop Hill&quot;, portraying the brother-in-law of Gregory Peck&#x27;s character. He also had an uncredited role in &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; as Barry Mills. In 1957, Torn portrayed Jody in an early episode of &quot;The Restless Gun&quot;. In 1957, he starred as incarcerated Steve Morgan in the &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; episode &quot;Number Twenty-Two&quot;, and on the same series in 1961, he played a recently released prisoner, Ernie Walters, in the &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; episode &quot;The Kiss-Off&quot;. After portraying Judas, betrayer of Jesus, in 1961 epic film &quot;King of Kings&quot;, Torn appeared in the February 7, 1962, episode of the acclaimed TV series &quot;The Naked City&quot;, &quot;A Case Study of Two Savages&quot;, adapted from the real-life case of backwood killers Charles Starkweather (played by Torn) and Ora Mae Youngham, (played by Tuesday Weld), Starkweather&#x27;s young bride, who were on a homicidal spree starting in Appalacia and ending in New York City. He played a graduate student with multiple degrees in 1963 television series &quot;Channing&quot;, and as Roy Kendall in the &quot;Breaking Point&quot; episode &quot;Millions of Faces&quot;. More military roles followed, as a Marine drill instructor in an episode of &quot;The Lieutenant&quot; in 1963 and as a GI in an episode of &quot;Combat!&quot; the next year. In 1964, Torn appeared as Eddie Sanderson in the episode &quot;The Secret in the Stone&quot; in &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; and in the premiere of &quot;The Reporter&quot;. In 1965, in the film &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot;, he played Slade, a corrupt New Orleans millionaire, who pressures Steve McQueen during a high-stakes poker game. On television that year, Torn portrayed Colonel Royce in the episode &quot;The Lorelei&quot; of &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot;. Following these roles, he had turns as a character actor in numerous subsequent films. The part of George Hanson in &quot;Easy Rider&quot; was written for Torn by Terry Southern, but according to Southern&#x27;s biographer Lee Hill, Torn withdrew from the project after co-director Dennis Hopper and he got into a bitter argument in a New York restaurant. Jack Nicholson played Hanson, instead, in a career-launching performance.

In 1972, Torn won rave reviews for his portrayal of a country and western singer in the cult film &quot;Payday&quot;. He co-starred with singer David Bowie in the 1976 science-fiction film, &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;. He portrayed a Southern senator in 1979&#x27;s &quot;The Seduction of Joe Tynan&quot;, opposite Alan Alda and Meryl Streep, and a music producer in Paul Simon&#x27;s 1980 film &quot;One-Trick Pony&quot;.

In 1982, Torn played a role as a black magic cult leader in the sword-and-sorcery movie &quot;The Beastmaster&quot;. He also co-starred in &quot;Jinxed!&quot;, a comedy with Bette Midler, and appeared as an airline executive in &quot;Airplane II: The Sequel&quot;. He played a sheriff opposite Treat Williams and Kris Kristofferson in the 1984 thriller &quot;Flashpoint&quot;. Torn received an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor for his role in 1983&#x27;s &quot;Cross Creek&quot; as a poor neighbor of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings in the orange groves of Florida. He was nominated for the CableACE Award for his portrayal of Big Daddy in the 1984 Showtime production of &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;. He co-starred with John Candy as a man who helps a tourist win a sailboat race in the 1985 comedy &quot;Summer Rental&quot;. He had a brief role as Sheriff Hank Pearson in &quot;Extreme Prejudice&quot;.
In 1988, he ventured into directing with &quot;The Telephone&quot;. The screenplay was written by Terry Southern and Harry Nilsson, and the film was produced by their company, Hawkeye. The story, which concerned an unhinged, out-of-work actor, had been written with Robin Williams in mind. After he turned it down, Whoopi Goldberg expressed a strong interest, but when production began, Torn reportedly had to contend with Goldberg constantly digressing and improvising, and he had to plead with her to perform takes that stuck to the script.

Goldberg was backed by the studio, which also allowed her to replace Torn&#x27;s chosen DP, veteran cinematographer John A. Alonzo, with her husband. As a result of the power struggle, Torn, Southern, and Nilsson cut their own version of the film, using the takes that adhered to the script and this was screened at the Sundance Film Festival, but the studio put together a rival version using other takes and it was poorly reviewed when it premiered in January 1988.

In 1990, he portrayed Colonel Fargo in &quot;By Dawn&#x27;s Early Light&quot;, a film from HBO about a fictional world war. In 1991, he portrayed Albert Brooks&#x27; character&#x27;s celestial defense attorney in &quot;Defending Your Life&quot;. He played a jeweler who murders his own nephew in order to steal a winning lottery ticket in an episode of &quot;Columbo&quot; that year on TV, &quot;Death Hits the Jackpot&quot;. In 1993, Torn portrayed the OCP CEO in &quot;RoboCop 3&quot; and starred opposite Tantoo Cardinal in &quot;Where the Rivers Flow North&quot;. This is the same year that Torn played the owner of a fictional battery company in a series of Energizer commercials in which the owner of a rival battery company hires various fictional villains to assault the Energizer Bunny and eliminate the competition. He was a naval officer presiding over a wargame in the Kelsey Grammer submarine comedy &quot;Down Periscope&quot; in 1996.

In 1997, Torn appeared in the Disney film &quot;Hercules&quot;, in which he voiced the god Zeus. Torn played MIB agency boss Zed in the 1997 hit film &quot;Men in Black&quot;, starring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, a role he reprised in the 2002 sequel &quot;Men in Black II&quot;. In 2001, Torn portrayed James &quot;Jim&quot; Brody in the comedy film &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot;. In 2004, he played the iconic wrench-tossing coach Patches O&#x27;Houlihan in &quot;&quot;.

=== Stage career ===
==== Broadway ====
Torn appeared in ten Broadway plays and directed one. In 1959, he made his feature Broadway debut when he played Tom Junior in &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot;, for which he won a Theatre World Award and also received a Tony Award nomination.

He returned next in 1962 in the play &quot;Daughter of Silence&quot; as Carlo, following that with a role in the 1963 production of &quot;Strange Interlude&quot;. In 1964, he played Lyle Britten in &quot;Blues for Mister Charlie&quot;, and four years later, he was Roberto in &quot;The Cuban Thing&quot; for its only performance on September 24, 1968.

In 1971, he portrayed Edgar in &quot;Dance of Death&quot;, and directed his first Broadway play in 1973: &quot;Look Away&quot;. In 1975, he portrayed the Son in the Broadway revival of &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; and 5 years later, portrayed Don in &quot;Mixed Couples&quot;. For 13 years, Torn was absent from Broadway, but returned in 1993 to portray Chris Christopherson in &quot;Anna Christie&quot;. In his last Broadway appearance in 1997, Torn portrayed Will Kidder in &quot;The Young Man from Atlanta&quot;.

==== Off-Broadway ====
Torn made his feature off-Broadway acting debut as Eben Cabot in the play &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot;, followed by Peter in &quot;The Kitchen&quot; at the 81st Street Theatre. His third off-Broadway role was Marion-Faye-A-Pimp in &quot;The Deer Park&quot;, for which he won the 1967 Obie Award for Distinguished Performance. He performed at the Lucille Lortel Theatre in the play &quot;Dream of a Blacklisted Actor&quot;, and later at the Joseph Papp Public Theater&#x27;s Anspacher Theater as William McLeod in &quot;Barbary Shore&quot;. He last acted off-Broadway at the American Place Theatre as Henry Hackamore in Sam Shepard&#x27;s 1979 play &quot;Seduced: a Play in Two Acts&quot;.

Torn&#x27;s off-Broadway debut as director was for the Evergreen Theater with the play &quot;The Beard&quot;; he won the 1968 Obie for Distinguished Direction for that work. He next directed &quot;The Honest-to-God Schnozzia&quot; at the Gramercy Arts Theater, followed by August Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;Creditors&quot; and &quot;The Stronger&quot;—in which he acted beside his wife at the time, Geraldine Page for the Joseph Papp Public Theater. Torn and Page also co-produced that production, and had previously presented the two plays along with &quot;Miss Julie&quot; at the off-off-Broadway Hudson Guild Theatre the year before.

=== &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; ===
From 1992 to 1998, Torn portrayed Artie in &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;. For his work, Torn received six consecutive Emmy Award nominations as Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and won the award once (1996). Torn was the only actor in the series who won an Emmy Award for his work. Other than the Emmy nominations and win, he received two American Comedy Awards nominations for Funniest Male Performance in a Series, winning once, and two CableACE Awards for his work on the series.

=== Later career ===

Following &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, Torn appeared in many comedic roles in films. He was also known for his voice work and did voice-overs for many animated films.

In 2007 and 2008, he made five guest appearances on &quot;30 Rock&quot; as the fictional chief executive officer of General Electric, Don Geiss. He was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series, but lost to Tim Conway, who guest-starred in the same sitcom. Torn&#x27;s character was reportedly killed off as a direct result of his 2010 arrest, though Tina Fey denied this in a DVD commentary. Torn voiced the character of Hephaestus in the 2010 video game &quot;God of War III&quot;.

Torn also appears in the music video for the They Might Be Giants song &quot;Can&#x27;t Keep Johnny Down&quot;, from their 2011 album &quot;Join Us&quot;.

In 2015, he reprised his role as Zed in a &quot;Men in Black&quot; safety video for Air New Zealand with rugby player Israel Dagg and singer Stan Walker.

== Personal life ==
=== Family ===
Torn was married three times, and had six children and four grandchildren.

His first marriage to actress Ann Wedgeworth lasted from 1956 to 1961. They had a daughter, Danae Torn.

In 1963, Torn married Geraldine Page, and they remained married until her death in 1987. They had a daughter, actress Angelica Page, and twin sons: actor Tony Torn, and Jon Torn (an associate professor of electronic media and film at Northern Arizona University). Torn apparently delighted in the fact that the doorbell of their New York townhouse read Torn Page.

Torn married actress Amy Wright in 1989. They had two children.

=== Legal issues ===
On January 29, 2010, Torn was arrested after breaking into a Litchfield Bancorp branch office in Lakeville, Connecticut. He was charged with carrying a firearm without a permit, carrying a firearm while intoxicated, first-degree burglary, second-degree criminal trespassing, and third-degree criminal mischief. The Connecticut State Police said Torn, who lived in Lakeville, broke into the bank thinking it was his home. In court, his lawyer told the judge his client needed help with alcohol abuse and that he could start treatment immediately in New York. Torn was released on $100,000 bail.

As a condition of his release, Torn had to be evaluated for substance abuse. On August 11, 2010, Torn was denied special probation, which would have allowed his name to be cleared of charges. The judge in the case cited Torn&#x27;s history of alcohol abuse and the possession of a loaded weapon while intoxicated, which carries a minimum one-year sentence. On December 14, 2010, Torn pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment, criminal trespass, criminal mischief, and possession of a firearm, and was given a two-and-a-half-year suspended jail sentence, and three years&#x27; probation.

=== On-set conflicts ===
Appearing as an interview subject in Studs Terkel&#x27;s 1974 oral-history book &quot;Working&quot;, Torn confessed, &quot;I have certain flaws in my make-up. Something called irascibility. I get angry easily. I get saddened by things easily.&quot;

While filming &quot;Maidstone&quot; (1968), Torn struck director and star Norman Mailer in the head with a hammer. With the camera rolling, Mailer bit Torn&#x27;s ear and they wrestled to the ground. The fight continued until it was broken up by cast and crew members. The fight is featured in the film. Although the scene may have been planned by Torn, the blood shed by both actors was real, and Torn was reportedly outraged by Mailer&#x27;s direction.

In 1994, he filed a defamation lawsuit against Dennis Hopper over a story Hopper told on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. Hopper claimed that Torn pulled a knife on him during pre-production of the film &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969). According to Hopper, Torn was originally cast in the film, but was replaced with Jack Nicholson after the incident. Torn claimed in his lawsuit that Hopper pulled the knife on him. A trial court judge ruled in Torn&#x27;s favor and Hopper was ordered to pay $475,000 in compensatory damages, but he denied Torn&#x27;s request for punitive damages, ruling Hopper had not acted with malice. Hopper appealed. On April 1, 1998, a California appellate court upheld the ruling for compensatory damages, and reversed the ruling for the punitive damages, requiring Hopper to pay another $475,000.

== Death ==
Torn died on July 9, 2019, at his home in Lakeville, Connecticut, at the age of 88 due to complications from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He is buried at the Poughkeepsie Rural Cemetery in Poughkeepsie, New York.

<text>Hans Sachs (5 November 1494 – 19 January 1576) was a German &quot;Meistersinger&quot; (&quot;mastersinger&quot;), poet, playwright, and shoemaker.

==Biography==
Hans Sachs was born in Nuremberg (). As a child he attended a singing school that was held in the church of Nuremberg. This helped to awaken in him a taste for poetry and music. His father was a tailor. He attended Latin school () in Nuremberg. When he was 14 he took up an apprenticeship as a shoemaker.

After the apprenticeship, at age 17, he was a journeyman and set out on his Journeyman years (&quot;Wanderjahre&quot; or &quot;Walz&quot;), that is, travelling about with companions and students. Over several years he worked at his craft in many towns, including Regensburg, Passau, Salzburg, Munich, Osnabrück, Lübeck, and Leipzig.

In 1513 he reached the small town of Wels, where he remained for a time, devoting himself to the cultivation of the fine arts. The Emperor Maximilian I chanced to pass through this town with his dazzling retinue, and the young poet allowed himself to be carried away by the splendour of the court. The prince placed him in the halls of the palace of Innsbruck. Later Hans Sachs quit the court and went to Schatz and Munich.

In the same year, he took up a kind of apprenticeship to become a mastersinger at Munich. Lienhard Nunnenbeck, a linen weaver, was his master. In 1516 he settled in Nuremberg and stayed there for the rest of his life. On 1 September 1519 he married Kunigunde Creutzer (1502–1560). He had seven children, but all died while he was still alive. He married again on 2 September 1561, this time to the young widow Barbara Harscher.

The great event of his intellectual life was the coming of the Reformation; he became an ardent adherent of Luther, and in 1523 wrote in Luther&#x27;s honor the poem beginning “The nightingale of Wittenberg, which is heard everywhere” (), and four remarkable dialogues in prose, in which his warm sympathy with the reformer was tempered by counsels of moderation. In spite of this, his advocacy of the new faith earned him a reproof from the town council of Nuremberg, and he was forbidden to publish any more “pamphlets or rhymes” (). It was not long, however, before the council itself openly threw in its lot with the Reformation.

==Works==

He wrote over 6000 pieces of various kinds. Exact numbers vary widely in secondary literature, mainly because it is not always clear if a piece is an independent work or part of a larger work. Also, certain works may be put in different categories by different authors. His productivity is especially remarkable because he kept working as a shoemaker throughout his life. (As far as is known, the Mastersingers did not as a common practice write or sing for money.) His works include

*Mastersongs () proper (about 4200)
*other poems and songs
*Carnival plays
*Tragedies
*Comedies
*Prose dialogues
*Fables
* Religious tracts, including “A wonderful prophecy of the papacy about how things will go for it up until the end of the world” () in collaboration with Andreas Osiander (1527).

Sachs wrote about Fünsing, a fictional &quot;village of fools&quot;, known from two of his : &quot;Der Roßdieb zu Fünsing&quot; (&quot;A Horse Thief from Fünsing&quot;) and &quot;Die Fünsinger Bauern&quot; (&quot;Peasants of Fünsing&quot;). (1558)

In the first one, one of the best known pieces of Sachs, the caught horse thief defends himself by arguing that he is no more dishonest than the judges, who, he asserts would do the same, had they had an opportunity. The judges let him go after he promises to come back after the harvest to be hanged.

The second one tells of various stupidity of Fünsinger in verse.

==Assessment==
His mastersongs were not published, being intended solely for the use of the Nuremberg Meistersinger school, of which Sachs was the leading spirit. His fame rests mainly on the “spoken poems” () which include his dramatic writings. His “tragedies” and “comedies” are, however, little more than stories told in dialogue, and are divided by convenient pauses into a varying number of acts. Sachs had little idea of the essentials of dramatic construction or the nature of dramatic action.

The subjects are drawn from the most varied sources, but particularly the Bible, the classics and the Italian novelists. He succeeds best in the short anecdotal &quot;Fastnachtsspiel&quot; or Shrovetide play, where characterisation and humorous situation are of more importance than dramatic form or construction.

Some of his farces have been played on the modern stage. Among these are:
* &quot;Der fahrende Schüler im Paradies&quot; (1550)
* &quot;Das Wildbad&quot; (1550)
* &quot;Das heiss Eisen&quot; (1551)
* &quot;Der Bauer im Fegefeuer&quot; (1552)

==As a fictional character==
Hans Sachs is the subject of an opera (1840) by Albert Lortzing. He is a leading character in Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; (1868).

<text>In chemistry, reactivity is the impulse for which a chemical substance undergoes a chemical reaction, either by itself or with other materials, with an overall release of energy.

&quot;Reactivity&quot; refers to:
* the chemical reactions of a single substance,
* the chemical reactions of two or more substances that interact with each other,
* the systematic study of sets of reactions of these two kinds,
* methodology that applies to the study of reactivity of chemicals of all kinds,
* experimental methods that are used to observe these processes, and
* theories to predict and to account for these processes.

The chemical reactivity of a single substance (reactant) covers its behavior in which it: 
* decomposes,
* forms new substances by addition of atoms from another reactant or reactants, and
* interacts with two or more other reactants to form two or more products.

The chemical reactivity of a substance can refer to the variety of circumstances (conditions that include temperature, pressure, presence of catalysts) in which it reacts, in combination with the:
* variety of substances with which it reacts,
* equilibrium point of the reaction (i.e., the extent to which all of it reacts), and
* rate of the reaction.

The term &quot;reactivity&quot; is related to the concepts of &quot;chemical stability&quot; and &quot;chemical compatibility&quot;.

==An alternative point of view==
&quot;Reactivity&quot; is a somewhat vague concept in chemistry. It appears to embody both thermodynamic factors and kinetic factors (i.e., whether or not a substance reacts, and how fast it reacts). Both factors are actually distinct, and both commonly depend on temperature. For example, it is commonly asserted that the reactivity of alkali metals (Na, K, etc.) increases down the group in the periodic table, or that hydrogen&#x27;s reactivity is evidenced by its reaction with oxygen. In fact, the rate of reaction of alkali metals (as evidenced by their reaction with water for example) is a function not only of position within the group but also of particle size. Hydrogen does not react with oxygen—even though the equilibrium constant is very large—unless a flame initiates the radical reaction, which leads to an explosion.

Restriction of the term to refer to reaction rates leads to a more consistent view. &quot;Reactivity&quot; then refers to the rate at which a chemical substance tends to undergo a chemical reaction in time. In pure compounds, reactivity is regulated by the physical properties of the sample. For instance, grinding a sample to a higher specific surface area increases its reactivity. In impure compounds, the reactivity is also affected by the inclusion of contaminants. In crystalline compounds, the crystalline form can also affect reactivity. However, in all cases, reactivity is primarily due to the sub-atomic properties of the compound.

Although it is commonplace to make statements that &quot;substance X is reactive,&quot; each substance reacts with its own set of reagents. For example, the statement that &quot;sodium metal is reactive&quot; suggests that sodium reacts with many common reagents (including pure oxygen, chlorine, hydrochloric acid, and water), either at room temperature or when using a Bunsen burner.

The concept of stability should not be confused with reactivity. For example, an isolated molecule of an electronically excited state of the oxygen molecule spontaneously emits light after a statistically defined period. The half-life of such a species is another manifestation of its stability, but its reactivity can only be ascertained via its reactions with other species.

==Causes of reactivity==
The second meaning of &quot;reactivity&quot; (i.e., whether or not a substance reacts) can be rationalized at the atomic and molecular level using older and simpler valence bond theory and also atomic and molecular orbital theory. Thermodynamically, a chemical reaction occurs because the products (taken as a group) are at a lower free energy than the reactants; the lower energy state is referred to as the &quot;more stable state.&quot; Quantum chemistry provides the most in-depth and exact understanding of the reason this occurs. Generally, electrons exist in orbitals that are the result of solving the Schrödinger equation for specific situations.

All things (values of the &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot;l quantum numbers) being equal, the order of stability of electrons in a system from least to greatest is;
*unpaired, and with no other electrons in similar orbitals, 
*unpaired, and with all degenerate orbitals half-filled, 
*(and the most stable is) a filled set of orbitals. 
To achieve one of these orders of stability, an atom reacts with another atom to stabilize both. For example, a lone hydrogen atom has a single electron in its 1s orbital. It becomes significantly more stable (as much as 100 kilocalories per mole, or 420 kilojoules per mole) when reacting to form H2.

It is for this same reason that carbon almost always forms four bonds. Its ground-state valence configuration is 2s2 2p2, half-filled. However, the activation energy to go from half-filled to fully-filled p orbitals is negligible, and as such, carbon forms them almost instantaneously. Meanwhile, the process releases a significant amount of energy (exothermic). This four equal bond configuration is called sp3 hybridization.

The above three paragraphs rationalize, albeit very generally, the reactions of some common species, particularly atoms. One approach to generalize the above is the activation strain model of chemical reactivity which provides a causal relationship between, the reactants&#x27; rigidity and their electronic structure, and the height of the reaction barrier.

The rate of any given reaction:
:&lt;chem&gt;Reactants -&gt; Products&lt;/chem&gt;
is governed by the rate law:
:formula_1

where the rate is the change in the molar concentration in one second in the rate-determining step of the reaction (the slowest step), is the product of the molar concentration of all the reactants raised to the correct order (known as the reaction order), and &#x27; is the reaction constant, which is constant for one given set of circumstances (generally temperature and pressure) and independent of concentration. The reactivity of a compound is directly proportional to both the value of &#x27; and the rate. For instance, if
:&lt;chem&gt;A + B -&gt; C + D&lt;/chem&gt;,
then
:formula_2

where is the reaction order of , is the reaction order of , is the reaction order of the full reaction, and is the reaction constant.

<text>The little black dress (LBD) is a black evening or cocktail dress, cut simply and often quite short. Fashion historians ascribe the origins of the little black dress to the 1920s designs of Coco Chanel. It is intended to be long-lasting, versatile, affordable, and widely accessible. Its ubiquity is such that it is often simply referred to as the &quot;LBD&quot;.

The little black dress is considered essential to a complete wardrobe. Many fashion observers state that every woman should own a simple, elegant black dress that can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. For example, the LBD can be worn with a jacket and pumps for daytime business wear. It can also be worn with ornate jewelry and accessories for evening wear or a formal event such as a wedding or ball.

==History==
Black has always been a color rich in symbolism. In the early 16th century, black represented wealth among Spanish aristocrats and Dutch merchants as it was incredibly expensive to produce the black color from &quot;imported oak apples.&quot; In the early 18th century, black represented romance and artistry. As Ann Demeulemeester said of it, &quot;Black is poetic. How do you imagine a poet? In a bright yellow jacket? Probably not.&quot; In the early 19th century, black was adopted by the Romantics such as Byron, Shelley, and Keats, due to its melancholic aura. As the Victorian era began, black transitioned from a color of art to one of grief and mourning – widows were expected to wear black for at least a year – and also for service livery, as the uniform for maids.

In 1926 Coco Chanel published a picture of a short, simple black dress in American &quot;Vogue&quot;. It was calf-length, straight and decorated only by a few diagonal lines. &quot;Vogue&quot; called it &quot;Chanel&#x27;s Ford&quot;. Like the Model T, the little black dress was simple and accessible for women of all social classes. &quot;Vogue&quot; also said that the LBD would become &quot;a sort of uniform for all women of taste&quot;. This, as well as other designs by the house of Chanel helped disassociate black from mourning, and reinvent it as the uniform of the high-class, wealthy, and chic. As Coco herself proclaimed, &quot;I imposed black; it&#x27;s still going strong today, for black wipes out everything else around.&quot;

The little black dress continued to be popular through the Great Depression, predominantly through its economy and elegance, albeit with the line lengthened somewhat. Hollywood&#x27;s influence on fashion helped the little black dress&#x27;s popularity, but for more practical reasons: as Technicolor films became more common, filmmakers relied on little black dresses because other colors looked distorted on screen and botched the coloring process. During World War II, the style continued in part due to widespread rationing of textiles, and in part as a common uniform (accessorized for businesswear) for civilian women entering the workforce.
The rise of Dior&#x27;s &quot;New Look&quot; in the post-war era and the sexual conservatism of the 1950s returned the little black dress to its roots as a uniform and a symbol of the dangerous woman. Hollywood femmes fatales and fallen women characters were portrayed often in black halter-style dresses in contrast to the more conservative dresses of housewives or more wholesome Hollywood stars. Synthetic fibres made popular in the 1940s and 1950s broadened the availability and affordability of many designs.

The generation gap of the 1960s created a dichotomy in the design of the little black dress. The younger &quot;mod&quot; generation preferred, in general, a miniskirt on their versions of the dress and designers catering to the youth culture continued to push the envelope - shortening the skirt even more, creating cutouts or slits in the skirt or bodice of the dress, using sheer fabrics such as netting or tulle. Many women aspired to simple black sheath dresses similar to the black Givenchy dress worn by Audrey Hepburn in the acclaimed film &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;.

The popularity of casual fabrics, especially knits, for dress and business wear during the 1980s brought the little black dress back into vogue. Coupled with the fitness craze, the new designs incorporated details already popular at the time such as broad shoulders or peplums: later in the decade and into the 1990s, simpler designs in a variety of lengths and fullness were popular. The grunge culture of the 1990s saw the combination of the little black dress with both sandals and combat boots, though the dress itself remained simple in cut and fabric.

The new glamour of the late 1990s led to new variations of the dress but, like the 1950s and the 1970s, colour re-emerged as a factor in fashion and formalwear and repeatedly shows an aversion to black. The resurgence of body conscious clothing, muted colour schemes, and the reemergence of predominant black, along with the retrospective trends of the 1980s in the late 2000s paved way to the return of interest to the dress.

==Famous examples==
The black dress worn by Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly in the film &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (1961), designed by Hubert de Givenchy, epitomized the standard for wearing little black dresses accessorized with pearls (together called &quot;basic black&quot;), as was frequently seen throughout the early 1960s. The dress set a record in 2006 when it was auctioned for £410,000, six times its original estimate.

Betty Boop, a cartoon character based in part on the 1920s it girl Helen Kane, was drawn wearing a little black dress in her early films, though with Technicolor later, Betty&#x27;s dress became red.

Wallis Simpson, Duchess of Windsor, was known to own several little black dresses and said much in praise of the garments. One quote of the Duchess: &quot;When a little black dress is right, there is nothing else to wear in its place.&quot;

Édith Piaf, the French folk icon, performed in a black sheath dress throughout her career: for this habit she was nicknamed &quot;little black sparrow&quot;. It was thought that the dress helped audiences focus more on Piaf&#x27;s singing and less on her appearance.

Diana, Princess of Wales wore a black Christina Stambolian dress to the Serpentine Gallery&#x27;s summer party hosted by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in June 1994, the night her husband Charles, Prince of Wales admitted to having an adulterous affair with Camilla Parker Bowles. Diana&#x27;s dress has been likened to a &quot;little black dress&quot;.

Maria Sharapova wore a &quot;little black dress&quot; during her night matches at the 2006 US Open which she helped design with Nike and featured a round crystal-studded collar after being inspired by Hepburn, and went on to win the tournament. Upon her return to the sport in 2017, eleven years after winning the tournament, she again wore a &quot;little black dress&quot; collaborating with Nike and Swarovski for her night matches at the 2017 US Open to celebrate her return at the championships. The look was intended to be reminiscent of her 2006 dress.

In an incident at London&#x27;s Covent Garden theatre in 2004, a director fired the then-obese soprano Deborah Voigt from an opera because she could not fit into a &quot;little black cocktail dress&quot;, replacing her with the slimmer Anne Schwanewilms.
