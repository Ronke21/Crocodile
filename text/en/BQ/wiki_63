<text>ASIMO (Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility) is a humanoid robot created by Honda in 2000. It is displayed in the Miraikan museum in Tokyo, Japan. On 8 July 2018, Honda posted the last update of ASIMO on their official page stating that it would be ceasing all development and production of ASIMO robots in order to focus on more practical applications using the technology developed through ASIMO&#x27;s lifespan. It made its last active appearance in March 2022, over 20 years after its first, as Honda announced that they are retiring the robot to concentrate on remote-controlled, avatar-style, robotic technology.

There are four published models of the ASIMO. A few years after the release in 2002 there were 20 units of the first ASIMO model produced. As of February 2009, there were over 100 ASIMO units in existence.

==Development==
Honda began developing humanoid robots in the 1980s, including several prototypes that preceded ASIMO. It was the company&#x27;s goal to create a walking robot. E0 was the first bipedal (two-legged) model produced as part of the Honda E series, which was an early experimental line of self-regulating, humanoid walking robot with wireless movements created between 1986 and 1993.
This was followed by the Honda P series of robots produced from 1993 through 1997. The research made 
on the E- and P-series led to the creation of ASIMO. Development began at Honda&#x27;s &quot;Wako Fundamental Technical Research Center&quot; in Japan in 1999 and ASIMO was unveiled in October 2000. ASIMO is an acronym which stands for Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility. The Japanese word Asi also stands for &#x27;leg&#x27; and Mo for &#x27;mobility&#x27;. ASIMO is pronounced as &quot; and means &#x27;also legs&#x27;.

In 2018, Honda ceased the commercial development of ASIMO, although it will continue to be developed as a research platform and make public appearances.

===Form ===
ASIMO stands tall and weighs . Research conducted by Honda found that the ideal height for a mobility assistant robot was between 120 cm and the height of an average adult, which is conducive to operating door knobs and light switches. ASIMO is powered by a rechargeable 51.8 V lithium-ion battery with an operating time of one hour. Switching from a nickel–metal hydride battery in 2004 increased the amount of time ASIMO can operate before recharging. ASIMO has a three-dimensional computer processor that was created by Honda and consists of a three stacked die, a processor, a signal converter and memory. The computer that controls ASIMO&#x27;s movement is housed in the robot&#x27;s waist area and can be controlled by a PC, wireless controller, or voice commands.

===Abilities===
ASIMO has the ability to recognize moving objects, postures, gestures, its surrounding environment, sounds and faces, which enables it to interact with humans. The robot can detect the movements of multiple objects by using visual information captured by two camera &quot;eyes&quot; in its head and also determine distance and direction. This feature allows ASIMO to follow or face a person when approached. The robot interprets voice commands and human gestures, enabling it to recognize when a handshake is offered or when a person waves or points, and then respond accordingly. ASIMO&#x27;s ability to distinguish between voices and other sounds allows it to identify its companions. ASIMO is able to respond to its name and recognizes sounds associated with a falling object or collision. This allows the robot to face a person when spoken to or look towards a sound. ASIMO responds to questions by nodding or providing a verbal answer in different languages and can recognize approximately 10 different faces and address them by name.

There are sensors that assist in autonomous navigation. The two cameras inside the head are used as a visual sensor to detect obstacles. The lower portion of the torso has ground sensor which comprises one laser sensor and one infrared sensor. The laser sensor is used to detect ground surface. The infrared sensor with automatic shutter adjustment based on brightness is used to detect pairs of floor markings to confirm the navigable paths of the planned map. The pre-loaded map and the detection of floor markings help the robot to precisely identify its present location and continuously adjust its position. There are front and rear ultrasonic sensors to sense the obstacles. The front sensor is located at the lower portion of the torso together with the ground sensor. The rear sensor is located at the bottom of the backpack.

===Impact and technologies===
Honda&#x27;s work with ASIMO led to further research on walking assist devices that resulted in innovations such as the Stride Management Assist and the Bodyweight Support Assist.

In honor of ASIMO&#x27;s 10th anniversary in November 2010, Honda developed an application for the iPhone and Android smartphones called &quot;Run with ASIMO.&quot; Users learn about the development of ASIMO by virtually walking the robot through the steps of a race and then sharing their lap times on Twitter and Facebook.

==Public appearances==


Since ASIMO was introduced in 2000, the robot has traveled around the world and performed in front of international audiences. ASIMO made its first public appearance in the U.S. in 2002 when it rang the bell to open trade sessions for the New York Stock Exchange. From January 2003 to March 2005, the robot toured the U.S. and Canada, demonstrating its abilities for more than 130,000 people. From 2003 to 2004, ASIMO was part of the North American educational tour, where it visited top science and technology museums and academic institutions throughout North America. The goal of the tour was to encourage students to study science through a live show that highlighted ASIMO&#x27;s abilities. Additionally, the robot visited top engineering and computer science colleges and universities across the US as part of the ASIMO Technology Circuit Tour in an effort to encourage students to consider scientific careers. In 2004, ASIMO was inducted into the Carnegie Mellon Robot Hall of Fame. In March 2005, the robot walked the red carpet at the world premiere of the animated film, &quot;Robots&quot;. In June 2005, ASIMO became a feature in a show called &quot;Say &#x27;Hello&#x27; to Honda&#x27;s ASIMO&quot; at Disneyland&#x27;s Innoventions attraction, which was a part of the Tomorrowland area of the park. This was the only permanent installation of ASIMO in North America until Innoventions was closed in April 2015.

The robot first visited the United Kingdom in January 2003 for private demonstrations at the Science Museum in London. ASIMO continued on a world tour, making stops in countries such as Spain, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, South Africa and Australia. In October 2008, ASIMO greeted Prince Charles during a visit to the Miraikan Museum in Tokyo, where it performed a seven-minute step and dance routine.

In a demonstration at Honda&#x27;s Tokyo headquarters in 2007, the company demonstrated new intelligence technologies that enabled multiple ASIMO robots to work together. The demonstration showed the robot&#x27;s ability to identify and avoid oncoming people, work with another ASIMO, recognize when to recharge its battery and perform new tasks, such as carrying a tray and pushing a cart.

In 2008, ASIMO conducted the Detroit Symphony Orchestra in a performance of &quot;The Impossible Dream&quot; to bring attention to its partnership with the Orchestra and support the performing arts in Detroit. A 49-foot replica of ASIMO made with natural materials, such as lettuce seed, rice and carnations led the 120th Rose Parade in celebration of Honda&#x27;s 50th year of operation in the US. Later that year, the robot made an appearance in Italy at the Genoa Science Festival.

In January 2010, Honda debuted its &quot;Living With Robots&quot; documentary at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. The film focuses on the experience of human interaction with robots like ASIMO. ASIMO attended the Ars Electronica festival in Linz, Austria in September 2010, which allowed Honda to study the results of human and robot interaction and use the results to guide development of future versions of the robot. In April 2011, ASIMO was demonstrated at the FIRST Championship in St. Louis, Missouri, US to encourage students to pursue studies in math, science and engineering, and in November 2011 ASIMO was one of the star attractions at the first Abu Dhabi Science Festival.

ASIMO visited the Ontario Science Center in Toronto in May 2011 and demonstrated its abilities to Canadian students. The robot later traveled to Ottawa for the unveiling of an exhibit at the Canadian Museum of Civilization 19 May through 22 May 2011.

ASIMO appeared as a guest on the British quiz show &quot;QI&quot; on 2 December 2011. After serving water to host Stephen Fry and dancing with comedian Jo Brand, ASIMO won with 32 points.

ASIMO was also the inspiration behind 2012&#x27;s film &quot;Robot &amp; Frank&quot;, where a robot assists an aging man to commit his last job as a &#x27;cat burglar&#x27;. The robot in the film, portrayed by an actor in costume, has the appearance of an ASIMO robot.

In April 2014, the robot was introduced to President Obama at the Miraikan science museum in Tokyo.

On 24 March 2017, Honda revealed ASIMO in Disneyland&#x27;s Autopia attraction.

===Failures===
On multiple occasions, audience members at public showcasings of ASIMO have filmed the robot acting incorrectly and falling down stairs. These videos have been uploaded on YouTube, and some have become viral for their comedic nature.

<doc id="500903" wikidata="Q4776343" url="?curid=500903" title="Antonina Miliukova">
<text>Antonina Ivanovna Miliukova (; – ) was the wife of Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky from 1877 until his death in 1893. After marriage she was known as Antonina Tchaikovskaya.

== Early years ==
Little is known of Antonina before she met Tchaikovsky. Her family resided in the Moscow area. They belonged to the local gentry but lived in poverty. The family was also a highly fractious one. Tchaikovsky tells us as much in a letter he wrote his sister Alexandra Davydova during his honeymoon:

After three days with them in the country, I begin to see that everything I can&#x27;t stand in my wife derives from her belonging to a completely weird family, where the mother was always arguing with the father—and now, after his death, does not hesitate to malign his memory in every way possible. It&#x27;s a family in which the mother &quot;hates&quot; (!!!) some of her own children, in which the sisters are constantly squabbling, in which the only son has completely fallen out with his mother and all his sisters, etc., etc.

Antonina first met Tchaikovsky in 1865 at the Moscow home of a common friend, Anastasia Khvostova, a well-known singer. His close friend Alexei Apukhtin was staying with her, and Anastasia&#x27;s brother Nikolai had been a classmate of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s brother Modest at the School of Jurisprudence. Antonina was 16 at the time; Tchaikovsky was 25. Although he did not recall this meeting, she immediately became infatuated with him.

She reportedly gave up work as a professional seamstress to study music at the Moscow Music Conservatory. Tchaikovsky was one of her professors. Eventually she had to abandon her studies at that institution, probably as a result of financial troubles. She wrote to Tchaikovsky on at least two occasions in 1877, two years after she had left school. At that time she was 28, far past the age at which women of that time generally married.

== Marriage to Tchaikovsky ==
By June 1877, Tchaikovsky proposed marriage, in order (according to one theory) to please his family and put to rest any social rumors regarding his sexual orientation. He described Miliukova as &quot;a woman with whom I am not the least in love.&quot;

They were married at the Church of Saint George in Moscow on 18 July 1877 (6 July, old style) and held their wedding dinner at the Hermitage Restaurant.

===Separation===
The marriage was disastrous for Tchaikovsky. A permanent separation followed after only six weeks, for which Modest blamed Antonina&#x27;s character. In his biography on Tchaikovsky, Modest describes her as a &quot;crazed half-wit.&quot; According to Anthony Holden, &quot;In truth, Antonina was as much the right woman for Tchaikovsky as any other. It was marriage which was the wrong institution.&quot;

For Antonina the marriage was a period of great happiness. She wrote, &quot;I would look at him surreptitiously, so he didn&#x27;t notice, and admire him enormously, especially during morning tea. So handsome, with kindly eyes which melted my heart, he breathed such freshness into my life! I would just sit there looking at him, and think &#x27;Thank God he belongs to me and no-one else! Now he is my husband, no one can take him away from me ...&#x27;&quot;

Antonina reacted negatively to her separation from Tchaikovsky, which his brother Anatoly confirmed to her would be permanent. Nikolai Rubinstein, an acquaintance of Antonina, accompanied Anatoly to discuss the situation. At Tchaikovsky&#x27;s apartment, Antonina invited both men in for tea. Rubinstein explained her husband&#x27;s condition, and the report from a psychologist who had examined him. He did so with a bluntness and &quot;cruel precision of expression,&quot; Anatoly later recalled to Nikolay Kashkin, that &quot;made me go hot and cold.&quot; Antonina responded that she would agree to whatever her &quot;darling Peti&quot; wanted. She then began pouring tea. This reaction surprised both men.

Rubinstein left soon after:

&quot;Anatonina Ivanovna saw Rubinstein to the door, and returned with a broad smile on her face, saying, &#x27;Well, who&#x27;d have thought I would entertain the famous Rubinstein to tea at my home today!&#x27;&quot; 

She then recalled to Anatoly a number of her prior romantic relationships. After that she asked what Anatoly would like for dinner. Anatoly followed Rubinstein out the door as soon as he could. He headed back to St. Petersburg and made arrangements to take his brother on a prolonged tour of Western Europe.

Kashkin, in his retelling of the incident, characterized Antonina&#x27;s behavior as indicative of mental imbalance. Modest treated it similarly in his biography.

Antonina believed she was the victim of a family conspiracy to end the marriage. She wrote, &quot;We were separated by constant whispering to Pyotr Ilyich that family life would kill his talent. At first, he paid no attention to this talk, but then he began somewhat to listen to it more and more attentively... To lose his talent was for him the most dreadful thing of all. He began to believe their slanders and became dull and gloomy.&quot;

She also believed that Tchaikovsky&#x27;s collapse, which immediately preceded their separation, was caused by stress from his obligations to her and his music. She accompanied him to the railway station on the last day of their union. &quot;One day, he told me he needed to go away on business for three days. I accompanied him to the mail train; his eyes were wandering, he was nervous, but I was so far in my thoughts from any trouble already hanging over my head. Before the first bell he had a spasm in his throat and went alone with jerky irregular steps to the station to drink some water. Then we entered the car, he looked at me plaintively, without lowering his eyes […] He never came back to me.&quot;

==Divorce attempts==
On 5 October 1877, Tchaikovsky wired his brother Anatoly, telling him to wire a summons to St. Petersburg in conductor Eduard Nápravník&#x27;s name. Anatoly settled his brother in St. Petersburg. He then traveled to Moscow, accompanied by Nikolai Rubinstein, to ask Antonina to consent to a divorce. Although she did not consent, Tchaikovsky and Antonina never lived together again. After finding Tchaikovsky verging on a nervous breakdown, Anatoly summoned a mental specialist. The specialist told Tchaikovsky not to cohabit or see his wife again.

Due to laws regarding divorce in Imperial Russia, the two remained legally married until Tchaikovsky&#x27;s death. This did not prevent further attempts at divorce in 1878 and 1879. The only legal ground for divorce was adultery, which Antonina refused to admit. A 10,000 ruble incentive from von Meck to accept the divorce was also rejected. This sum would have been payable through his publisher, P. Jurgenson, once a divorce had been finalized.

Antonina may have helped fuel Tchaikovsky&#x27;s fear of public exposure by her unpredictable behavior. During her stay at Kamenka immediately following their separation, she wrote him letters that unsettled him. In July 1880, she accused him of spreading rumors about her in Moscow. She responded, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you start with yourself, telling […] about your own terrible vice?&quot;

In March 1881, Antonina gave birth to a child out of wedlock. Although Tchaikovsky now had legal grounds for divorce, he did not act. He might have thought that legal action would drag up matters he hoped were forgotten or at least buried. He continued to send her a regular allowance, which may have helped buy her silence. Divorce would have meant Tchaikovsky&#x27;s freedom from any further financial responsibility for her. Eventually, she had three children. She surrendered all of them to foundling hospitals.

==Tchaikovsky&#x27;s views on his wife==
Tchaikovsky himself insisted to his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck, &quot;My wife, whatever she may be, is not to be blamed for my having driven the situation to the point where marriage became necessary. The blame for everything lies on my lack of character, my weakness, impracticality, childishness!&quot; He considered his falling in with her, at a time when he had decided to be married simply for the sake of being married, as something to simply attribute to Fate. Nevertheless, he personally showed nothing but disregard for her after their separation, often referring to her as &quot;the reptile&quot;. For the rest of his life, any news concerning her drove him to hysterics. A single letter from her could upset him for several days.

He continued to disparage her to von Meck. &quot;You will ask, of course: but how did we spend the time when she and I were alone together? She is very talkative, but all her talk comes down to the following two subjects. Hourly she would repeat to me innumerable stories about innumerable who had felt tender feelings toward her. For the most part, these were generals, nephews of prominent bankers, well-known artists, even members of the imperial family.&quot;

&quot;Next,&quot; he continued to von Meck, &quot;she would no less frequently, and with a sort of inexplicable passion, describe to me the vices, the cruel and base actions and detestable behavior of all her relatives, with every of whom, it turned out, she is in enmity. Her mother would especially catch her in this... The third topic of her tireless chatter was her stories of life at boarding school. There was no end to them.&quot; He also added, &quot;Desiring to know what maternal instincts she had, I asked her once whether she liked children. I received in reply: &#x27;Yes, when they are clever.&#x27;&quot; 

Things changed when Tchaikovsky returned to Moscow from Kamenka. Antonina demanded that he fulfill his marital duties in the bedroom. Tchaikovsky considered this change an act of betrayal. It sent him into despair and severely wounded his pride.

== Later years ==
In later years, the couple met briefly a couple of times, much to Tchaikovsky&#x27;s displeasure. Though she outlived Tchaikovsky by 24 years, she spent the last 20 of them in an insane asylum. She died on 1 March 1917 in Moscow at age 68.

== Her memoirs ==
After his death she wrote or dictated her reminiscences about their marriage. While they were printed in 1894 and reprinted in 1913, they were never widely known. According to Tchaikovsky scholar Alexander Poznansky, she comes across in them as naive, superficial and not very intelligent. He also said that her memoirs revealed a woman devoted to the memory of her husband, an appreciation of his greatness, and the vague feeling of an enormous misunderstanding having taken place between them. Poznansky added that &quot;nothing in the reminiscences gives any grounds for suspecting them for being a forgery. On the contrary, the genuineness of the intonation, the idiosyncratic style, and the wealth of detail all attest its authenticity.&quot;

<text>Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais (1795 – December 1840) was a French chess master, possibly the strongest player in the early 19th century.

== Early life ==

La Bourdonnais was born on the island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean in 1795. He was the grandson of Bertrand-François Mahé de La Bourdonnais. He learned chess in 1814 and began to take the game seriously in 1818, regularly playing at the Café de la Régence. He took lessons from Jacques François Mouret, his first teacher, and within two years he became one of the best players of the &quot;Café&quot;.

==Chess career==
La Bourdonnais was forced to earn his living as a professional chess player after squandering his fortune on ill-advised land deals. He played in an era before a World Chess Championship was established, but was considered to be perhaps the strongest player in the world from 1821 — when he became able to beat his chess teacher Alexandre Deschapelles — until his death in 1840. The most famous match series in that time was the series against Alexander McDonnell in 1834. These matches of 85 games were analyzed by Kasparov in his book &quot;My Great Predecessors&quot;.

== Death ==
He died penniless in London on 13 December 1840, having been forced to sell all his possessions, including his clothes, to satisfy his creditors. George Walker arranged his burial a stone&#x27;s throw from his old rival Alexander McDonnell at Kensal Green Cemetery.

== Notable games ==
* Alexander McDonnell vs. Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais, 16, London 1834, Sicilian Defense: Old Sicilian. Open (B32), 0–1 A game demonstrating the strength of pawns. Its end position is one of the most surprising in the history of chess.
* Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais vs. Alexander McDonnell, 3, London 1834, Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted: Old Variation (D20), 1–0 La Bourdonnais punishes McDonnell&#x27;s premature attack.

<text>The Selkirk locomotives were 36 steam locomotives of the 2-10-4 wheel arrangement built for Canadian Pacific Railway by Montreal Locomotive Works, Montreal in Quebec, Canada.

==History==
The first of these large engines, which had a 2-10-4 wheel arrangement, was built in July 1929. Altogether, twenty were constructed before the end of this year bearing numbers 5900 to 5919. The Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s classification was T1a. These locomotives weighed fully loaded. They were the largest and most powerful locomotives in the British Empire. While most other 2-10-4s were named after the state of Texas, these locomotives were named after the Selkirk range of mountains that they crossed, the (railway) summit of which was located just inside the western portal of the Connaught Tunnel beneath Rogers Pass.

Montreal Locomotive Works built another ten of these successful Selkirk locomotives during November and December 1938. The Canadian Pacific Railway assigned them T1b class. They were numbered from 5920 to 5929. Modifications led the T1b to be ten tons or tonnes lighter while increasing steam pressure from . A further six Selkirks, classed T1c, were built by the Montreal Locomotive Works shop in 1949. They were the last standard gauge steam locomotives built in Canada for a Canadian railway. They were much the same as the T1b except for a few refinements, including two cross-compound air compressors to speed recharging of the air brake system. 

Some small streamlining touches were not retained. The streamlined casing around the smokebox stack was now absent as was the teardrop shape of the classification lights. Also, the inside of the cabs were no longer lined/insulated in the same manner as the previous classes (previous classes had provided better cold-weather cab insulation and were more popular with engine crews). They were all equipped with boosters (some shortly after being built) and all Selkirks (5900 through 5935) were built as oil burners. The tenders held of water and of fuel oil. They had to be equipped with two pairs of six-wheel trucks because the total tender weight was .

The first Selkirks, which come from the T1a class, had a heavier-looking, non-streamlined appearance which better exemplified the heavy steam-power look. Their original, as-delivered rear sand-domes were removed early in their service life. All of the later T1b and T1c-class locomotives were semi-streamlined and were painted with CPR Tuscan red panels along the sides of their running boards, beneath the cab windows and on the sides of the tenders with gold leaf (originally) border trim (which was later changed to a type of yellow similar to &quot;duluxe gold&quot;). Some of the original T1a-class Selkirks also received this paint scheme (but with narrower panels along the sides of the running boards that widened in the middle to carry the locomotive&#x27;s road number).

All 36 Selkirk locomotives (5900 through 5935) were initially assigned to handle both freight as well as passenger trains between the major division points of Calgary and Revelstoke, a distance of . They were also used for in pusher service from Revelstoke west (uphill) to the wye at Taft, assisting the road engines of both freight as well as passenger trains up the steep grade to this location. The Laggan Subdivision covered the eastern portion of their assigned territory and included the Field Hill and the Spiral Tunnels while the western portion of their primary, assigned territory consisted of the Mountain Subdivision which covered the remaining and included Rogers Pass, the Connaught Tunnel and Stoney Creek Bridge. The grades encountered had a maximum of 2.2% (1 in 45), with curves of 12° or radius. Rated at tractive effort, on the lesser grades they could haul unassisted and without the booster cut-in. The booster engine added an additional of tractive effort up to a maximum speed of . Due to their extreme weight, they could not proceed west of Taft to Vancouver.

When diesels began operation between Calgary and Revelstoke in the early 1950s, the Selkirks were reassigned to work the Brooks and Maple Creek subdivisions between Calgary and Swift Current, Saskatchewan. They were also used to haul freight trains north of their new Alyth terminal (in Calgary) as far as Edmonton. At least some of the reassigned Selkirks received an &quot;all black&quot; (non-passenger) paint scheme without CPR Tuscan red panels and without grey or &quot;blued&quot; metal boiler-jackets; however, they still retained the yellow panel trim around the previous CPR Tuscan red (now black) panels (on those locomotives formerly painted with &quot;outlined&quot; panels). The last Selkirks (5930 through 5935) were taken out of service in 1959.

==Preservation==
All but two Selkirk locomotives class were scrapped, and both surviving classes are from the T1c class. None of the earlier T1a class or T1b class locomotives was preserved. The 5935 is preserved in the Canadian Railway Museum, in Saint-Constant, Quebec. The 5931 (which was repainted and intentionally renumbered incorrectly as 5934 upon initial public display near downtown Calgary) is displayed at Heritage Park in Calgary, Alberta.

<doc id="500922" wikidata="Q2458157" url="?curid=500922" title="Chromaticism">
<text>Chromaticism is a compositional technique interspersing the primary diatonic pitches and chords with other pitches of the chromatic scale. In simple terms, within each octave, diatonic music uses only seven different notes, rather than the twelve available on a standard piano keyboard. Music is chromatic when it uses more than just these seven notes.

Chromaticism is in contrast or addition to tonality or diatonicism and modality (the major and minor, or &quot;white key&quot;, scales). Chromatic elements are considered, &quot;elaborations of or substitutions for diatonic scale members&quot;.

==Development of chromaticism==
Chromaticism began to develop in the late Renaissance period, notably in the 1550s, often as part of &quot;musica reservata&quot;, in the music of Cipriano de Rore, in Orlando Lasso&#x27;s &quot;Prophetiae Sibyllarum&quot;, and in the theoretical work of Nicola Vicentino.

The following timeline is abbreviated from its presentation by Benward &amp; Saker:
:Baroque Period (1600—1750) &quot;The system of major and minor scales developed during the early part of the baroque period. This coincided with the emergence of key consciousness in music.&quot;
:Classical Period (1750—1825) &quot;The major and minor keys were the basis of music in the classical period. Chromaticism was decorative for the most part and shifts from one key to another...were used to create formal divisions.&quot;
:Romantic Period (1825—1900) &quot;Chromaticism increased to the point that the major—minor key system began to be threatened. By the end of the period, keys often shifted so rapidly in the course of a composition that tonality itself began to break down.&quot;
:Post-Romantic and Impressionistic Period (1875—1920) &quot;With the breakdown of the major—minor key system, impressionist composers began to experiment with other scales...particularly...pentatonic, modal, and whole-tone scales.&quot;
:Contemporary Period (1920—present) &quot;The chromatic scale has predominated in much of the music of our period.&quot;
:Jazz and Popular Music (1900—present) &quot;Popular music has remained the last bastion of the major-minor key system... The blues scale [&quot;a chromatic variant of the major scale&quot;] is often found in jazz and popular music with blues influence.&quot;


As tonality began to expand during the last half of the nineteenth century, with new combinations of chords, keys and harmonies being tried, the chromatic scale and chromaticism became more widely used, especially in the works of Richard Wagner, such as the opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;. Increased chromaticism is often cited as one of the main causes or signs of the &quot;breakdown&quot; of tonality, in the form of increased importance or use of:
*mode mixture
*leading tones
*tonicization of each chromatic step and other secondary key areas
*modulatory space
*hierarchical organizations of the chromatic set such as George Perle&#x27;s
*the use of non-tonal chords as tonic &quot;keys&quot;/&quot;scales&quot;/&quot;areas&quot; such as the Tristan chord.

As tonal harmony continued to widen and even break down, the chromatic scale became the basis of modern music written using the twelve-tone technique, a tone row being a specific ordering or series of the chromatic scale, and later serialism. Though these styles/methods continue to (re)incorporate tonality or tonal elements, often the trends that led to these methods were abandoned, such as modulation.

===Types of chromaticism===

David Cope describes three forms of chromaticism: modulation, borrowed chords from secondary keys, and chromatic chords such as augmented sixth chords.

The total chromatic is the collection of all twelve equally tempered pitch classes of the chromatic scale.

List of chromatic chords:
*Dominant seventh chords of subsidiary keys, used to create modulations to those keys (V7–I cadences)
*Augmented sixth chords
*Neapolitan sixth chords as chromatic subdominants
*Diminished seventh chords as chromatic vii7
*Altered chords
*Expanded chords
**Shir-Cliff, Jay, and Rauscher (1965)

Other types of chromaticity:
*Pitch axis theory
*Parallel scales
*Nonchord tone
*The minor mode in major keys (mode mixture)
**Shir-Cliff, Jay, and Rauscher (1965)

==Chromatic note==


A chromatic note is one which does not belong to the scale of the key prevailing at the time. Similarly, a chromatic chord is one which includes one or more such notes. A chromatic and a diatonic note, or two chromatic notes, create chromatic intervals.

A chromatic scale is one which proceeds entirely by semitones, so dividing the octave into twelve equal steps of one semitone each.

Linear chromaticism is used in jazz: &quot;All improvised lines ... will include non-harmonic, chromatic notes.&quot; Similar to in the bebop scale this may be the result of metric issues, or simply the desire to use a portion of the chromatic scale

==Chromatic chord==


A chromatic chord is a musical chord that includes at least one note not belonging in the diatonic scale associated with the prevailing key, the use of such chords is the use of chromatic harmony. In other words, at least one note of the chord is chromatically altered. Any chord that is not chromatic is a &quot;diatonic chord&quot;.

For example, in the key of C major, the following chords (all diatonic) are naturally built on each degree of the scale:
*I = C major triad [contains pitch classes C E G]
*ii = D minor triad [contains D F A]
*iii = E minor triad [contains E G B]
*IV = F major triad [contains F A C]
*V = G major triad [contains G B D]
*vi = A minor triad [contains A C E]
*vii = B diminished triad [contains B D F]

However, a number of other chords may also be built on the degrees of the scale, and some of these are chromatic. Examples:
*II in first inversion is called the Neapolitan sixth chord. For example, in C Major: F–A–D. The Neapolitan Sixth chord resolves to the V.
*The iv diminished chord is the sharpened subdominant with diminished seventh chord. For example: F–A–C–E. The IV diminished chord resolves to the V. The IV can also be understood as the tonicization of V where it functions as vii7 of the V chord, written vii7/V.
*VI: The augmented sixth chord, A–C(–C, D, or E)–F, resolves to the V.
*Consonant chromatic triads, modulation to these triads would be chromatic modulation:
**III, VI, II, iv, vii, and VII in major
**iii, vi, II, iv, ii, and vii in minor.

==Chromatic line==
In music theory, is a Latin term which refers to chromatic line, often a bassline, whether descending or ascending.

A line cliché is any chromatic line that moves against a stationary chord. There are many different types of line clichés—most often in the root, fifth or seventh—but there are two named line clichés. The major line cliché moves from the fifth of the chord to the sixth, then back to the fifth. Assuming the starting chord is the tonic, the simplest form of the major line cliché forms a I–I+–vi–I+ progression. The minor line cliché moves down from the root to the major seventh, to the minor seventh, and can continue until the fifth.

From the late 16th century onward, chromaticism has come to symbolize intense emotional expression in music. Pierre Boulez (1986, p. 254) speaks of a long established &quot;dualism&quot; in Western European harmonic language: &quot;the diatonic on the one hand and the chromatic on the other as in the time of Monteverdi and Gesualdo whose madrigals provide many examples and employ virtually the same symbolism. The chromatic symbolizing darkness doubt and grief and the diatonic light, affirmation and joy—this imagery has hardly changed for three centuries.&quot; When an interviewer asked Igor Stravinsky (1959, p. 243) if he really believed in an innate connection between &quot;pathos&quot; and chromaticism, the composer replied: &quot;Of course not; the association is entirely due to convention.&quot; Nevertheless, the convention is a powerful one and the emotional associations evoked by chromaticism have endured and indeed strengthened over the years. To quote Cooke (1959, p. 54) &quot;Ever since about 1850—since doubts have been cast, in intellectual circles, on the possibility, or even the desirability, of basing one&#x27;s life on the concept of personal happiness—chromaticism has brought more and more painful tensions into our art-music, and finally eroded the major system and with it the whole system of tonality.&quot;

Examples of descending chromatic melodic lines that would seem to convey highly charged feeling can be found in:

==Quotes==
Some individual views on chromaticism include:



==Connotations==

Chromaticism is often associated with dissonance.

In the 16th century the repeated melodic semitone became associated with weeping, see: passus duriusculus, lament bass, and pianto.

Susan McClary (1991) argues that chromaticism in operatic and sonata form narratives can be chosen to be understood through a Marxist narrative as the &quot;Other&quot;, racial, sexual, class or otherwise, to diatonicism&#x27;s &quot;male&quot; self, whether through modulation, as to the secondary key area, or other means. For instance, Catherine Clément calls the chromaticism in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Isolde&quot; &quot;feminine stink&quot;. However, McClary also contradicts herself saying that the same techniques used in opera to represent madness in women were historically highly prized in avant-garde instrumental music, &quot;In the nineteenth-century symphony, &quot;Salome&quot;″s chromatic daring is what distinguishes truly serious composition of the vanguard from mere cliché-ridden hack work.&quot; (p. 101)

<text>Freddie H. Fu (; (1950 – September 24, 2021) was a Hong Kongese-American doctor and academic. He was the David Silver Professor and chairman of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. In 2010, he was appointed by the University of Pittsburgh as the eighth distinguished service professor. He died due to metastatic melanoma on 24 September 2021.

==Career==
Fu was born in Hong Kong, his ancestral hometown is Nanhai district, Foshan city, Guangdong province. He attended Dartmouth College, where he was a member of the Alpha Chi Alpha fraternity. Dr. Fu was president of the Pennsylvania Orthopaedic Society and, in 2008, assumed the presidency of the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM) and was the first foreign-born president in AOSSM&#x27;s 40-year history. In 2009, he was named president of the International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine. In 2011, he received the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons&#x27; (AAOS) Diversity Award. In 2012, Fu received the Sports Leadership Award from Dapper Dan Charities, which was subsequently renamed the Freddie Fu Sports Leadership Award and will remain in perpetuity.

== Pitt orthopaedic research ==
At the time of his death, his team had more than 100 studies completed or underway to evaluate the merits of the anatomic approach by viewing the knee as an organ. He also had ongoing collaborations with K. Christopher Beard, Ph.D., a vertebrate paleontologist, and other curators at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and veterinarians at the Pittsburgh Zoo. Additionally, Fu worked closely with C. Owen Lovejoy, Ph.D., an anthropologist at Kent State University, who reconstructed the skeleton of “Lucy”, the nearly complete fossil of a human ancestor that walked upright more than three million years ago. Such collaborations allowed for detailed study of evolution and bony and soft tissue anatomy of the knee.

<doc id="500935" wikidata="Q1559605" url="?curid=500935" title="Canton (flag)">
<text>In vexillography, the canton is a rectangular emblem placed at the top left of a flag, usually occupying up to a quarter of a flag&#x27;s area. The canton of a flag may be a flag in its own right. For instance, British ensigns have the Union Jack as their canton, as do their derivatives such as the national flags of Australia and New Zealand.

Following the practice of British ensigns, a canton sometimes contains a symbol of national unity, such as the blue field and white stars of the flag of the United States of America. In these cases, the canton may be called simply the union.

The American flag&#x27;s canton derives from Britain&#x27;s use of the Union Jack in the flags of its possessions (including, historically, the Thirteen American Colonies). Subsequently, many New World nations (along with other later countries and regions, such as Liberia or Malaysia) that were inspired by the United States adopted flag elements that were inspired by the American flag. As a result, many extant uses of a prominent canton derive either from British territorial history, or American influence and inspiration.

==Current flags using cantons==
===Sovereign states===
===Territories, regions, and provinces===
====States of Australia====
All of the Australian states (although not the territories) use the UK&#x27;s national flag in their cantons.
====Provinces of Canada====
Two of Canada&#x27;s ten provinces use flags with cantons, both the UK national flag.
====Counties of Liberia====
Every county flag of Liberia contains the Liberian national flag in its canton.
====Other====

Many French colonial flags contained the Flag of France in the canton.

<text>An okrug is a type of administrative division in some Slavic-speaking states. The word &quot;okrug&quot; is a loanword in English, alternatively translated as area, district, county, or region. 

Etymologically, &quot;okrug&quot; literally means &#x27;circuit&#x27;, derived from Proto-Slavic , in turn from &quot;around&quot; + &quot;circle&quot;. In meaning, the word is similar to the German term &quot;Bezirk&quot; or &quot;Kreis&quot; (&#x27;district&#x27;) and the French word &quot;arrondissement&quot;; all of which refer to something &quot;encircled&quot; or &quot;surrounded&quot;.

==Bulgaria==
In Bulgaria, &quot;s&quot; are the abolished primary unit of the administrative division and implied &quot;districts&quot; or &quot;counties&quot;. They existed in the postwar Bulgaria between 1946 and 1987 and corresponded approximately to today&#x27;s oblasts.

==Poland==
As historical administrative subdivisions of Poland, existed in the later part of the Congress Poland period, from 1842, when the name was applied to the former &quot;powiats&quot; (the name being transferred to the former &quot;obwody&quot;). See: subdivisions of Congress Poland.

 were also created temporarily from 1945 to 1946, in the areas annexed to Poland from Germany as a result of the Soviet military advance. An was then subdivided into . These were later replaced by voivodeships, and the by s.

==Russia==
===Imperial Russia===
&quot;Okrugs&quot; were one of the several types of administrative division for oblasts and selected governorates in Imperial Russia. Until the 1920s, okrugs were administrative districts in Cossack hosts such as the Don Cossacks.

===Soviet Union===
Inherited from Imperial Russia, in the 1920s, &quot;okrugs&quot; were administrative divisions of several other primary divisions such as oblasts, krais, and others. For some time in the 1920s they also served as the primary unit upon the abolishment of guberniyas and were divided into raions. On 30 July 1930 most of the okrugs were abolished. The remaining okrugs were phased out in the Russian SFSR during 1930–1946, although they were retained in Zakarpattia Oblast of the Ukrainian SSR in a status equivalent to that of a raion.

National okrugs were first created in the Mountain ASSR of the Russian SFSR in 1921 as units of the Soviet autonomy and additional national okrugs were created in the Russian SFSR for the peoples of the north and Caucasus region. In 1977, all national okrugs were renamed autonomous okrugs.

===Russian Federation===
In the present-day Russian Federation, the term &quot;okrug&quot; is either translated as &quot;district&quot; or rendered directly as &quot;okrug&quot;, and is used to describe the following types of divisions:
*Federal Districts (), such as the Siberian Federal District
*Autonomous okrugs (), such as Chukotka Autonomous Okrug

After the series of mergers in 2005–2008, several autonomous okrugs of Russia lost their federal subject status and are now considered to be administrative territories within the federal subjects they had been merged into:
*Agin-Buryat Okrug, a territory with special status within Zabaykalsky Krai
*Komi-Permyak Okrug, a territory with special status within Perm Krai
*Koryak Okrug, a territory with special status within Kamchatka Krai
*Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug, a territory with special status within Irkutsk Oblast

&quot;Okrug&quot; is also used to describe the administrative divisions of the two &quot;federal cities&quot; in Russia:
*the administrative &quot;okrugs&quot; of Moscow are an upper-level administrative division
*the municipal &quot;okrugs&quot; of St.  Petersburg is a lower-level administrative division

In the federal city of Sevastopol, municipal okrugs are a type of municipal formation.

In Tver Oblast, the term &quot;okrug&quot; also denotes a type of an administrative division which is equal in status to that of the districts.

Furthermore, the designation &quot;okrug&quot; denotes several &quot;selsoviet&quot;-level administrative divisions:
*okrugs, such as okrugs of Samara Oblast
*rural okrugs (), such as the rural okrugs of Belgorod Oblast
*rural territorial okrugs (), such as the rural territorial okrugs of Murmansk Oblast
*stanitsa okrugs (), such as the stanitsa okrugs of Krasnodar Krai

In some cities, the term &quot;okrug&quot; is used to refer to the administrative divisions of those cities. Administrative okrugs are such divisions in the cities of Murmansk, Omsk, and Tyumen; city okrugs are used in Krasnodar; municipal &quot;okrugs&quot; are the divisions of Nazran; okrugs exist in Belgorod, Kaluga, Kursk, and Novorossiysk; and territorial okrugs are the divisions of Arkhangelsk and Lipetsk.

The term &quot;okrug&quot; is also used to describe a type of a municipal formation, the municipal urban okrug—a municipal urban settlement not incorporated into a municipal district.

==Serbia==

The Republic of Serbia is divided into twenty-nine &quot;okrugs&quot; as well as the City of Belgrade. The term &quot;okrug&quot; in Serbia is often translated as either &quot;district&quot; or &quot;county&quot;.

<doc id="500939" wikidata="Q4877609" url="?curid=500939" title="Beaupre (surname)">
<text>Beaupre (originally Beaupré) ( ) is a surname found mostly in Canada, the United States and parts of England.

== In England, Wales and France ==
Beaupré was a prominent family in Norfolk, who built Beaupré Hall, Outwell. Christian, daughter and coheir of Thomas de St Omer, married John, the great-great-grandson of one Synulph, who lived during the reign of King Henry II, and had issue: John &quot;dicte quoque Beaupré&quot;, who lived during the reign of King Edward II, and married Katherine, daughter of Osbert Mountfort. Their son Thomas Beaupré would be raised by his grandmother Christian (last St Omer in this line) after the death of both of his parents. Thomas was knighted by King Edward III, and married Joan Holbeache, and died during the reign of King Richard II.

Nicholas Beaupré married Margaret Fotheringhay, one of the three daughters and heiresses of Thomas Fotheringhay (son of Gerrard Fotheringhay) by his wife Elizabeth Doreward, sister and heiress of John Doreward and daughter of William Doreward of Bocking, Essex. One of Margaret&#x27;s sisters was Christiana Fotheringhay, wife of John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford (1482–1540), KG, Lord Great Chamberlain. The other was Helen or Ellen Fotheringhay, who married Henry Thursby of Ashwicken and Burg&#x27;s Hall in Hillington (1476–1506), the nephew of Thomas Thursby (d.1510), merchant, thrice Mayor of King&#x27;s Lynn and the founder and benefactor of Thoresby College.

The son of Nicholas Beaupré and Margaret Fotheringhay, Edmund Beaupré, married Margaret, the daughter of Sir John Wiseman, servant to the 15th Earl of Oxford. His second wife, Katherine Wynter (widow of John Wynter of Great Yarmouth) was the daughter of Phillip Bedingfeld of Ditchingham Hall. After Edmund Beaupré&#x27;s death in 1567 leaving no male heirs, the hall succeeded to Sir Robert Bell, by virtue of marriage to Edmund&#x27;s daughter Dorothy in 1559; whereby his Beaupré line became extinct. In 1529, together with his cousin Thomas Thursby of Hillington, Norfolk, as heirs of John Doreward, of Great Yeldham, Essex, Edmund Beaupré released the manor of Coggeshall to Richard Sowthwell, esquire. This was the same manor that the same Richard Southwell would later give King Henry VIII as part of his fine for the murder of Sir William Pennington . In 1541 Edmund Beaupré got the wardship and marriage of his relative Edward Thursby of Doreward&#x27;s Hall in Bocking, Essex. He married him to the sister of his second wife, Mary Bedingfeild.

<doc id="500942" wikidata="Q311737" url="?curid=500942" title="Samuel Reshevsky">
<text>Samuel Herman Reshevsky (born Szmul Rzeszewski; November 26, 1911 – April 4, 1992) was a Polish chess prodigy and later a leading American chess grandmaster. He was a contender for the World Chess Championship from the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s: he tied for third place in the 1948 World Chess Championship tournament, and tied for second in the 1953 Candidates tournament. He was an eight-time winner of the US Chess Championship, tying him with Bobby Fischer for the all-time record.

He was an accountant by profession and also a chess writer.

==Early life, early chess exhibition and competition==

Reshevsky was born at Ozorków near Łódź, Congress Poland, to a Jewish family. He learned to play chess at age four and was soon acclaimed as a child prodigy. At age eight, he was beating many accomplished players with ease and giving simultaneous exhibitions.

In November 1920, his parents moved to the United States to make a living by publicly exhibiting their child&#x27;s talent. Reshevsky played thousands of games in exhibitions all over the US. He played in the 1922 New York Masters tournament; at that stage, he was likely the youngest player ever to have competed in a strong tournament.

For a period in his youth, Reshevsky did not attend school, for which his parents appeared in District Court in Manhattan, facing a charge of improper guardianship. However, Julius Rosenwald, wealthy co-owner of Sears, Roebuck and Company in Chicago, soon afterward became Reshevsky&#x27;s benefactor, and he guaranteed Reshevsky&#x27;s future on the condition that he would complete his education.

Reshevsky never became a truly professional chess player. He gave up most competitive chess for seven years, from 1924 to 1931, to complete his secondary education while successfully competing in occasional events during this period.

Reshevsky graduated from the University of Chicago in 1934 with a degree in accounting and supported himself and his family by working as an accountant. He moved to New York City and lived there or in its suburbs for the remainder of his life. He and his wife, Norma Mindick, had three children. As a religious Jew, Reshevsky would not play on the Sabbath nor on the major Jewish Festivals; his games were scheduled accordingly.

==Death==
Reshevsky died April 4, 1992, in Suffern, New York, of a heart attack.

==Chess career==
===American results===
Reshevsky won the US Open Chess Championship in 1931 at Tulsa; this event was known as the Western Open at the time. He shared the 1934 US Open title with Reuben Fine at Chicago.

Reshevsky won the US Chess Championship in 1936, 1938, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1946, and 1969. He also tied for first in 1972 but lost the playoff in 1973 to Robert Byrne. He competed in a record 21 US Championships and achieved a plus score every time except for 1966–67, when he scored just 4½/11. He also holds US Championship records for most finishes in the top three places (15), most games played (269), and most games won (127).

===International results===

Reshevsky&#x27;s international career began in 1935 with a trip to England, where he won at Great Yarmouth with 10/11. He then won first place at the Margate tournament, where he beat, among others, former world champion José Raúl Capablanca; the game followed the Exchange Variation of the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined. The game score follows: 

:Reshevsky vs. Capablanca, 1935 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 d5 4.Bg5 Nbd7 5.cxd5 exd5 6.e3 Be7 7.Bd3 0-0 8.Qc2 c5 9.Nf3 c4 10.Bf5 Re8 11.0-0 g6 12.Bh3 Nf8 13.Bxc8 Rxc8 14.Bxf6 Bxf6 15.b3 Qa5 16.b4 Qd8 17.Qa4 a6 18.b5 Re6 19.Rab1 Rb8 20.Rb2 Be7 21.bxa6 Rxa6 22.Qc2 Ne6 23.Rfb1 Ra7 24.a4 Nc7 25.Ne5 Qe8 26.f4 f6 27.Ng4 Qd7 28.h3 Kg7 29.Nf2 Ba3 30.Ra2 Bd6 31.Nfd1 f5 32.Nb5 Ra5 33.Nxc7 Bxc7 34.Nc3 Qd6 35.Qf2 b6 36.Qf3 Rd8 37.Rab2 Qe7 38.Rb4 Rd7 39.Kh1 Bd8 40.g4 fxg4 41.hxg4 Qd6 42.Kg1 Bc7 43.Kf2 Rf7 44.g5 Bd8 45.Ke2 Bxg5 46.Rxb6 Qa3 47.Kd2 Be7 48.Rb7 Rxa4 49.Qxd5 Ra5 50.Qxc4 Rh5 51.Kd3 Qa8 52.Qe6 Qa3 53.Rd7 Rhf5 54.Rb3 Qa1 55.Rxe7 Qf1+ 56.Kd2 

A year later Reshevsky shared third place at the Nottingham 1936 chess tournament. In 1937 he shared first at Kemeri, Latvia, and in 1938 shared fourth in the famous AVRO tournament in the Netherlands, which featured arguably the eight strongest players in the world. Reshevsky won his third US Open title at Boston 1944.

Reshevsky was a serious contender for the World Championship from roughly 1935 to the mid 1960s. He was one of five chess grandmasters to compete in the World Championship match tournament in The Hague/Moscow 1948 and finished in joint third place with Paul Keres, behind Mikhail Botvinnik and Vasily Smyslov. This tournament was organized because World Champion Alexander Alekhine had died in 1946 while holding the title, which was an unprecedented situation.

In 1950, Reshevsky was awarded the title of International Grandmaster by FIDE, the World Chess Federation, on its inaugural list. Although eligible, he did not play in the Candidates Tournament in Budapest. It has generally been believed that he was barred from attending by the US State Department due to the Cold War. The only other eligible active player from a NATO country, Max Euwe of the Netherlands, also did not play. In 1991, however, Reshevsky said the decision not to go was his.

The following Candidates in Zurich 1953 tournament was probably Reshevsky&#x27;s best chance to qualify for a World Championship match, but he finished in joint second place with David Bronstein and Keres, two points behind Smyslov. Bronstein, in his last book, &quot;Secret Notes&quot;, published in 2007 just after his death the previous year, confirmed long-standing rumours by writing that the nine Soviet grandmasters (out of a field of 15 players) at Zurich were under orders from both their chess leadership and the KGB not to let Reshevsky win the tournament under any circumstances, with Smyslov being the preferred victor. Bronstein claims that when Reshevsky maintained his strong contention late into the two-month event, the Soviets prearranged several results in games amongst themselves to successfully prevent Reshevsky&#x27;s overall victory while also ensuring that Reshevsky faced the maximum test in his own games against the Soviet players. Bronstein had earlier (1995) written that he was ordered by the Soviet delegation leader to win as Black against Reshevsky in the second cycle at Zurich and managed to do so after a very hard struggle. Several other writers, including GM Alexei Suetin (who was the second of Tigran Petrosian at Zurich 1953), also confirmed the Soviet collusion in Zurich.

Reshevsky qualified for one more Candidates in 1967 but lost the subsequent quarterfinal match to Viktor Korchnoi the following year.

===Olympiad results===
Reshevsky competed eight times for the US at the Chess Olympiads, six times on , over a 37-year span, helping the US team to win the gold in 1937 and bronze in 1974, and winning an individual bronze medal for his performance on board one in 1950. His complete results were (+39−12=49) in 100 games, for 63.5 percent. He played at Stockholm 1937, Dubrovnik 1950, Helsinki 1952, Munich 1958, Tel Aviv 1964, Lugano 1968, Siegen 1970, and Nice 1974.

==Match player==
In 1952, New York hosted the first eight games of an informal match for &quot;The Championship of the Free World&quot; between Reshevsky and Polish-Argentine grandmaster Miguel Najdorf. An additional five games were played in Mexico City and five more in San Salvador. Reshevsky won the match, 11–7. The following year a rematch took place in Buenos Aires. Reshevsky again won, 9½–8½.

In his long career, Reshevsky proved a formidable match player. In 1941, he defeated I. A. Horowitz in a US Championship playoff match by (+3−0=13). In 1942, he defeated Isaac Kashdan by (+6−2=3). In 1952, he defeated Svetozar Gligorić by (+2−1=7). In 1956, he defeated William Lombardy by (+1−0=5). In 1957, he defeated Arthur Bisguier by (+4−2=4). In 1957, he defeated Donald Byrne by (+7−3=0). In 1960, he defeated Pal Benko by (+3−2=5).

Reshevsky lost his first match in 1964, but it was a four-game playoff match following the Amsterdam 1964 Interzonal, where he had tied for 8th–9th with the Hungarian Champion Lajos Portisch. The final spot for advancement to the Candidates Match was at stake and there was little time between the end of the Interzonal and the start of the match. Reshevsky&#x27;s earlier matches had always had a lead time of several months, which allowed him to prepare his openings, but he proved to be at a distinct disadvantage in this area against Portisch, who was a full-time chess professional and always excellent in his opening preparation. Reshevsky was quickly outplayed on the White side of the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted in the first game and eventually fell on time in a lost position. In the second game, he played sharply with Black, but Portisch was able to exchange the queens and a pair of rooks, thus draining much of the tension in the position. A draw by threefold repetition of position soon ensued. In his last game with White, Reshevsky had to go for broke. An Open Sicilian arose, but Portisch seized the initiative on the queenside; having gained a clear advantage, he was able to translate it into a crushing kingside attack, thus winning the match and the final Candidates spot. Amsterdam 1964 was the first meeting between these two chess greats, and Portisch was to prove a difficult opponent for Reshevsky, whose lifetime score against him was (+0−4=9).

Reshevsky played on top board for the US in the 1955 team match against the USSR, held in Moscow, and defeated World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik over four games, winning one and drawing three.

==Rivalry with Bobby Fischer==
Once Bobby Fischer made his debut at age 14 in the US Championship with the 1957–58 event, he dominated completely, winning on each of his eight attempts, leaving Reshevsky, the seven-time former champion, back in the chasing pack. There was little love lost between the two players, separated by a generation in age. Ahead of the Buenos Aires 1960 tournament, Reshevsky reportedly said, &quot;I would settle for 19th place – if Fischer placed 20th.&quot; Reshevsky in fact won the Buenos Aires 1960 tournament, with Fischer well back; this was the only time Reshevsky finished ahead of Fischer in an international tournament.

In 1961 Reshevsky began a 16-game match with the then-current US Champion Fischer; it was jointly staged in New York and Los Angeles. Despite Fischer&#x27;s recent meteoric rise, consensus opinion favored Reshevsky. After eleven games and a tie score (two wins apiece with seven draws), the match ended due to a scheduling dispute between Fischer and match organizer Jacqueline Piatigorsky, with Reshevsky receiving the winner&#x27;s share of the prize fund.

In the 1967 Sousse Interzonal, Fischer turned up 53 minutes late (only seven minutes short of an automatic time forfeiture) for his game with Reshevsky, and made his opening move without a word of apology. Reshevsky, who had been convinced that Fischer had withdrawn from the tournament, lost the game badly and complained furiously to the organizers. Despite losing that game, Reshevsky advanced to the next stage. Reshevsky also refused to play for the US team in the Chess Olympiads of 1960, 1962 and 1966 because Fischer, as US champion, was chosen ahead of him for the top board. He did, however, finally consent to play on a lower board in 1970, the only time the two men appeared in the same team.

Although Reshevsky and Fischer had one of the fiercest rivalries in chess history, Fischer greatly respected the older champion, stating in the late 1960s that he thought Reshevsky was the strongest player in the world in the mid-1950s. This was around the time when Reshevsky defeated World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik in their four-game mini-match, which was the top board of the US vs. USSR team match held in Moscow.

During his long chess career, Reshevsky played eleven of the first twelve world champions, from Emanuel Lasker to Anatoly Karpov, the only player to do so (he met Garry Kasparov but never played him). He defeated seven world champions: Lasker, José Raúl Capablanca, Alexander Alekhine, Max Euwe, Mikhail Botvinnik, Vasily Smyslov, and Bobby Fischer.

==Important tournament titles==
Aside from US Championships, Reshevsky&#x27;s important tournament titles included: 
Syracuse 1934, 
Hastings 1937–38, 
Leningrad/Moscow 1939, 
Hollywood 1945 (Pan American Championship), 
New York 1951 (Maurice Wertheim Memorial), 
Havana 1952, 
New York 1956 (Lessing Rosenwald Trophy), 
Dallas 1957, 
Haifa/Tel Aviv 1958, 
Buenos Aires 1960, 
Netanya 1969, 
Reykjavík Open 1984, at age 72.

Reshevsky competed seriously at least semi-regularly, virtually until his death in New York City in 1992. He defeated old rival Vasily Smyslov in a tournament game in 1991.

==Style==
Reshevsky was a tough and forceful player who was superb at positional play but could also play brilliant tactical chess when warranted. He often used huge amounts of time in the opening, which sometimes forced him to play the rest of the game in a very short amount of time. That sometimes unsettled Reshevsky&#x27;s opponents, but at other times resulted in blunders on his part. Reshevsky&#x27;s inadequate study of the opening and his related tendency to fall into time pressure may have been the reasons that, despite his great talent, he never became world champion; he himself acknowledged this in his book on chess upsets. This shortcoming was similarly noted by GM Larry Evans in commentary contained in Fischer&#x27;s book &quot;My 60 Memorable Games&quot;.

Reshevsky specialized in closed openings with the white pieces, usually opening with 1.d4, and was a virtuoso with the Exchange Variation of the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined. He rarely opened with 1.e4 against strong opposition. With the black pieces, he employed a broad and varied repertoire during his long career.

Contemporary American GM Arnold Denker complimented Reshevsky&#x27;s extraordinary tenacity and fighting spirit and noted that Reshevsky developed a vital advantage in his great head-to-head battles with his main American rival, GM Reuben Fine, particularly in US Championships from the mid 1930s through the early 1940s. Trouble in games against Reshevsky was the main reason Fine was never able to win the US Championship.

==Writings==
Reshevsky&#x27;s books include &quot;Reshevsky on Chess&quot; (1948), &quot;How Chess Games Are Won&quot; (1962), &quot;Great Chess Upsets&quot; (1976), and &quot;The Art of Positional Play&quot; (1978), as well as an account of the 1972 World Championship match between his great rival Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky. He also wrote articles on chess for American Chess Bulletin, Chess Life and Chess Review magazines, and for &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==Quotes==
* &quot;By playing slowly during the early phases of a game I am able to grasp the basic requirements of each position. Then, despite being in time pressure, I have no difficulty in finding the best continuation. Incidentally, it is an odd fact that more often than not it is my opponent who gets the jitters when I am compelled to make these hurried moves.&quot;
* His self-description, &quot;My style is somewhere between that of Tal and Petrosian&quot;, is sometimes circulated as an ironic comment (given that these two players are considered to represent opposite extremes of style) but makes more sense in its full context; from his book &quot;Great Chess Upsets&quot; : I am essentially a positional player, although I can conduct an assault with precision and vigor, when the opportunity arises. My style lies between that of Tal and Petrosian. It is neither over-aggressive nor too passive. My strength consists of a fighting spirit, a great desire to win, and a stubborn defense whenever in trouble. I rarely become discouraged in an inferior situation, and I fear no one.

<doc id="500948" wikidata="Q830588" url="?curid=500948" title="Field guide">
<text>A field guide is a book designed to help the reader identify wildlife (flora or fauna or funga) or other objects of natural occurrence (e.g. rocks and minerals). It is generally designed to be brought into the &quot;field&quot; or local area where such objects exist to help distinguish between similar objects. Field guides are often designed to help users distinguish animals and plants that may be similar in appearance but are not necessarily closely related.

It will typically include a description of the objects covered, together with paintings or photographs and an index. More serious and scientific field identification books, including those intended for students, will probably include identification keys to assist with identification, but the publicly accessible field guide is more often a browsable picture guide organized by family, colour, shape, location or other descriptors.

==History==
Popular interests in identifying things in nature probably were strongest in bird and plant guides. Perhaps the first popular field guide to plants in the United States was the 1893 &quot;How to Know the Wildflowers&quot; by &quot;Mrs. William Starr Dana&quot; (Frances Theodora Parsons). In 1890, Florence Merriam published &quot;Birds Through an Opera-Glass&quot;, describing 70 common species. Focused on living birds observed in the field, the book is considered the first in the tradition of modern, illustrated bird guides. In 1902, now writing as Florence Merriam Bailey (having married the zoologist Vernon Bailey), she published &quot;Handbook of Birds of the Western United States&quot;. By contrast, the &quot;Handbook&quot; is designed as a comprehensive reference for the lab rather a portable book for the field. It was arranged by taxonomic order and had clear descriptions of species size, distribution, feeding, and nesting habits.

From this point into the 1930s, features of field guides were introduced by Chester A. Reed and others such as changing the size of the book to fit the pocket, including colour plates, and producing guides in uniform editions that covered subjects such as garden and woodland flowers, mushrooms, insects, and dogs.

In 1934, Roger Tory Peterson, using his fine skill as an artist, changed the way modern field guides approached identification. Using color plates with paintings of similar species together – and marked with arrows showing the differences – people could use his bird guide in the field to compare species quickly to make identification easier. This technique, the &quot;Peterson Identification System&quot;, was used in most of Peterson&#x27;s Field Guides from animal tracks to seashells and has been widely adopted by other publishers and authors as well.

Today, each field guide has its own range, focus and organization. Specialist publishers such as Croom Helm, along with organisations like the Audubon Society, the RSPB, the Field Studies Council, National Geographic, HarperCollins, and many others all produce quality field guides.

==Principles==

It is somewhat difficult to generalise about how field guides are intended to be used, because this varies from one guide to another, partly depending on how expert the targeted reader is expected to be.

For general public use, the main function of a field guide is to help the reader identify a bird, plant, rock, butterfly or other natural object down to at least the popular naming level. To this end some field guides employ simple keys and other techniques: the reader is usually encouraged to scan illustrations looking for a match, and to compare similar-looking choices using information on their differences. Guides are often designed to first lead readers to the appropriate section of the book, where the choices are not so overwhelming in number.

Guides for students often introduce the concept of identification keys. Plant field guides such as &quot;Newcomb&#x27;s Wildflower Guide&quot; (which is limited in scope to the wildflowers of northeastern North America) frequently have an abbreviated key that helps limit the search. Insect guides tend to limit identification to Order or Family levels rather than individual species, due to their diversity.

Many taxa show variability and it is often difficult to capture the constant features using a small number of photographs. Illustrations by artists or post processing of photographs help in emphasising specific features needed to for reliable identification. Peterson introduced the idea of lines to point to these key features. This passage was written by his wife, Virginia Marie Peterson, in the preface to one of his field guides:

Field guides aid in improving the state of knowledge of various taxa. By making the knowledge of experienced museum specialists available to amateurs, they increase the gathering of information by amateurs from a wider geographic area and increasing the communication of these findings to the specialists.

<text>BIOSCI, also known as Bionet, is a set of electronic communication forum used by life scientists around the world. It includes the Bionet Usenet newsgroups and parallel e-mail lists, with public archives since 1992 at www.bio.net. BIOSCI/Bionet provides public, open access biology news and discussion for areas such as molecular biology methods and reagents, bioinformatics software and computational biology, toxicology, and several organism communities including yeast, C.elegans and annelida (worms), the plant arabidopsis, fruitfly, maize (corn), and others.

BIOSCI/Bionet was started as part of the GenBank public biosequence database project by Intelligenetics at Stanford University in the mid-1980s, in collaboration with Martin Bishop and Michael Ashburner in the University of Cambridge. It latter moved to the United Kingdom&#x27;s MRC Rosalind Franklin Centre for Genomics Research (RFCGR). In 2005, with the closing of RFCGR, BIOSCI/Bionet moved to Indiana University Biology Department&#x27;s IUBio Archive.
As one of the earliest bioinformatics community projects on the Internet, GenBank acquired the bio.net domain and the Usenet hierarchy of Bionet for promoting open access communications among bioscientists, in conjunction with public biology data distribution.

Michael Ashburner, co-founder of BIOSCI with Dave Kristofferson of GenBank (Intelligenetics), writes of its origins ... in the early 1980s, Martin Bishop and I ran an email news service for a sequence analysis service that we ran on the Cambridge IBM3084Q mainframe. I was also a user of MOLGEN at Stanford, and there Dave Kristofferson ran an internal bulletin board using ANU News. We combined forces to start the Bulletin boards. 

Bionet has provided open access, Internet news groups and discussion for many thousands of life scientists for 30 years. As of 2019 April, discussion lists are suspended, but are archived for reading. A new supporting organization is sought to continue Bionet into its fourth decade, as Indiana University will no longer support this public service to biologists.

The Usenet hierarchy of Bionet.* includes bionet.announce (general biology announcements), and research communities of bionet.microbiology, bionet.molbio.methds-reagnts, bionet.neuroscience, bionet.genome.arabidopsis, bionet.plants.education, bionet.drosophila, bionet.biology.computational plus 50 other active areas of discussion.

<doc id="500954" wikidata="Q713159" url="?curid=500954" title="Saber Marionette">
<text>is a Japanese series created by Satoru Akahori featuring android girls. It has been produced in the form of anime, manga, and light novels.

In January 1995, a twelve-episode audio drama series called &quot;SM Girls Saber Marionette R&quot; aired on the radio show &quot;Nowanchatte Say You&quot;. The audio drama concluded in April 1995, and the story was continued one month later with the release of the first episode of the &quot;Saber Marionette R&quot; OVA. Episode two was released in late July 1995, and in September 1995, the final episode was released.

From April, 1995 to December 1995, an incomplete seven-chapter manga titled &quot;SM Girls Gaiden Saber Marionette Z&quot; was published in &quot;Gakken&quot;&#x27;s magazine &quot;AnimeV&quot;, in its &quot;Vcomi&quot; section. It was illustrated by Megumu Okada and was never published in a &quot;tankōbon&quot; format. The eighth chapter was released in a novel format.
Later, Akahori and Katsumi Hasegawa attempted to re-compose the story as a &quot;Saber Marionette R 2&quot; novel, but it was never realized and was released as another novel.

In October 1995 the &quot;SM Girls Saber Marionette J&quot; audio drama series premiered on &quot;Nowanchatte Say You&quot; and ran until January 1996. In October 1996 the &quot;Saber Marionette J&quot; anime series aired. The series ran through March 1997 with 25 episodes. Beginning with a short story published in the October 1994 issue of &quot;Gekkan Dragon Magazine&quot;, twelve volumes of serialized light novels were produced.
A manga series illustrated by Yumisuke Kotoyoshi was adapted from an anime series serialized in the Gekkan Dragon Jr. and then Gekkan Comic Dragon.

In October 1997, a sequel arrived on video, the &quot;Saber Marionette J Again&quot; OVA. In June 1998, the sixth and final episodes of the OVA were released. In October 1998, the &quot;Saber Marionette J to X&quot; TV series was first broadcast. The series ran for 26 episodes, concluding in March 1999.

A manga titled &quot;Saber Marionette 2: Shiritsu Oedo Gakuen Koubouki&quot; started serializing in Fujimi Shobo&#x27;s Gekkan Dragon Magazine in October 2000, but it was soon canceled.

A manga titled &quot;Saber Marionette i − Neo Gene&quot; illustrated by Megane Ōtomo started its serialization in July 2008 in Fujimi Shobo&#x27;s Gekkan Dragon Age and was finally compiled in one &quot;tankōbon&quot;.

In July 2015, the group then known as Animation Innovation Content (AIC) Project (currently: Saber Project) announced that it had licensed the rights to the franchise, and simultaneously announced the launch of the Saber &quot;re:anime project&quot;.

==&quot;Saber Marionette J&quot;==

 is about Mamiya Otaru and his three marionettes, humanoid female robots; the young and free-spirited Lime; the small and reserved Cherry; and the outgoing and busty Bloodberry.

In a world with no women, the surviving men have reintroduced the female in the form of an android. Called Marionettes, they are built to serve men and are limited in their interactions with humans. That is until a poor boy named Otaru Mamiya encounters a Marionette named Lime. Lime is a Saber model with a special circuit that gives her emotions. When Otaru awakens two more Saber Marionettes, his life as an &#x27;average&#x27; boy quickly becomes as extraordinary as the lives of his eager, busty new friends.

== Saber Marionette J Again ==

&quot;Saber Marionette J Again&quot; is a 6-episode OVA that has events which take place after &quot;Saber Marionette J&quot;. In the story, Faust asks Otaru to receive the three Saber Dolls in his apartment, so that he can educate them as he did with Lime, Cherry, and Bloodberry. At the same time, Lorelei is asked to repair Tiger&#x27;s maiden circuit, which is broken.

Meanwhile, planet Terra II is beginning to experience a plasmatic crisis. The key to save the planet lies within a new marionette, which will bear the name Marine. The mystery behind Marine lies in her triple maiden circuit, and is not unveiled until episode four. She matures faster than the other marionettes, and is stronger than Bloodberry and Panther combined.

==&quot;Saber Marionette J to X&quot;==

&quot;Saber Marionette J to X&quot; continues approximately a year after the conclusion of Saber Marionette J. In the early episodes Otaru, Lime, Bloodberry and Cherry are shown leading comparatively ordinary lifestyles, cherishing the peaceful days that dawn on Japoness.

As the story progresses, due to uncanny circumstances, Faust appears once again, much more zealous, brutal and merciless than before, restarting his world-conquering agenda. He is accompanied by his subordinates, the Saber dolls. He is revealed to be a clone of the now introspective, atonement-seeking Faust, the embodiment of a measure taken by Gartland to secure the aspirations of Faust the First.

Later on, as Japoness stirs, more, and even much more sinister and ulterior motives are revealed, and the joint efforts, and investigations lead to the conclusion that Yan of Xian and Dr. Hesse, the former scientist and servant of Faust both have a hand in the matter.

They successfully kidnap the Marionettes and make them lose their memories for a prolonged period, which they use for their own gains later on. The series concerns itself with the return of the Marionettes&#x27; memories extensively.

Yan and particularly Hesse are shown in-depth only at the end, showing their personal goals and past traumas in the last arc which resolves the man-machine conflict, with themes of technology and human responsibility.

==&quot;Saber Marionette R&quot;==
&quot;Saber Marionette R&quot; takes place many years after the events in J. This series features three new marionettes that have the same names and basic personalities as those from the &quot;J&quot; and &quot;J to X&quot; series, but with different appearances (this series&#x27; Lime looks more like a child and has shorter hair, for example).

Saber Marionette R takes place in the city-state of Romana, which resembles medieval Italy. The three marionettes, Cherry, Lime and Bloodberry, now accompany Junior, the heir to the throne of Romana. However, a criminal known as Face is freed from prison by three marionettes of his own called the Sexadolls, named Edge, Brid and Canny. Face threatens the future of Romana by killing the king and forcing everyone to search for Junior and arrest him. Cherry, Lime and Bloodberry must destroy Face&#x27;s Sexadolls, protect Junior and help Romana become peaceful once more.

<doc id="500956" wikidata="Q6879604" url="?curid=500956" title="Missouri Plan">
<text>The Missouri Plan (originally the Missouri Nonpartisan Court Plan, also known as the merit plan, or some variation) is a method for the selection of judges. It originated in Missouri in 1940 and has been adopted by many states of the United States. Similar methods are used in some other countries.

Under the Plan, a non-partisan commission reviews candidates for a judicial vacancy. The commission then sends to the governor a list of candidates considered best qualified. The governor then has sixty days to select a candidate from the list. If the governor does not make a selection within sixty days, the commission makes the selection.

At the next general election after the completion of one year&#x27;s service, the judge must stand in a retention election. If a majority votes against retention, the judge is removed from office, and the process starts anew. Otherwise, the judge serves out a full term.

As of 2016, 38 states have a form of merit-based selection and retention method for some or all judges. Twenty-five states have a nominating commission to screen all candidates of the state courts of last resort. Eight states have commissions which fill interim vacancies on the highest courts. Twenty states utilize retention elections for judges who wish to serve on highest state courts beyond their initial term.

== Nonpartisan judicial commissions under the Plan ==
Under the Missouri Nonpartisan Court Plan, a nonpartisan judicial commission reviews applications, interviews candidates and selects a judicial panel. For the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals, the Appellate Judicial Commission makes the selection. It is composed of three lawyers elected by members of the Missouri Bar (the organization of all lawyers licensed in this state), three citizens selected by the governor, and the chief justice, who serves as chair. Each of the three geographic districts of the Court of Appeals must be represented by one lawyer and one citizen member on the Appellate Judicial Commission.

Each of the circuit courts in Clay, Greene, Jackson, Platte, and St. Louis Counties, and the city of St. Louis has its own circuit judicial commission. These commissions are composed of the chief judge of the court of appeals district in which the circuit is located, plus two lawyers elected by the bar and two citizens selected by the governor. All of the lawyers and citizens must live within the circuit for which they serve the judicial commission.

==History and spread of the plan==
In line with other reforms urged during the Progressive Era, legal scholars put forth ideas in the first decades of the 1900s to reduce or remove the role of politics in the selection of judges, particularly circuit judges with responsibilities over the day-to-day work of the courts. An example of this advocacy is the merit selection program urged by Albert M. Kales in his work &quot;Unpopular Government in the United States&quot; (1914).

Support for merit selection increased due to the perceived corruption of urban political bosses. Missouri voters adopted the system by initiative petition in November 1940 after several very contentious judicial elections, which were heavily influenced by the political machine of Tom Pendergast. Most associate and circuit judges are elected. However, the state constitution requires such judges in Jackson County (Kansas City) and the city of St. Louis to be selected under the nonpartisan system. Similarly, the voters in Clay and Platte counties (parts of Kansas City), St. Louis county, and Greene County (Springfield) have elected to appoint such judges under the nonpartisan system. After Missouri adopted this method for selecting judges, several other states adopted it, either in full or in part. The plan was put forth by a committee chaired by Luther Ely Smith, &quot;founder&quot; of the Gateway Arch National Park.

The Missouri Non-Partisan Court Plan has served as a model for thirty-four other states that use merit selection to fill some or all judicial vacancies. 23 states use the method or a variant for the state supreme court.

California uses a heavily modified version in which the Governor can theoretically nominate any California attorney who has practiced for ten years. But then the nominee must undergo an evaluation by the Commission on Judicial Nominees Evaluation (JNE) of the State Bar of California, which then forwards a nonbinding evaluation to the Governor. For superior court positions, the Governor can make an appointment after receiving a report from JNE. For appellate court positions, the Governor submits the nomination to the Commission on Judicial Appointments, consisting of the Chief Justice, the Attorney General, and the presiding justice of the affected Court of Appeal district (or the most senior presiding justice for Supreme Court nominations). The CJA holds a public meeting, and receives the report from the JNE Commission, then decides whether to confirm the nominee. Once confirmed, the judge can take office but then must go through retention elections (at different intervals for each level of the judiciary).

== Criticism ==
The Missouri Plan is not without critics. There are several alternative ways of filling judicial posts that are used in other states. These include direct elections (either partisan or non-partisan), election by the state legislature, or appointment by the governor with advice and consent of the state senate. Missouri had previously used all of these methods before adopting the Nonpartisan Court Plan in 1940.

=== Excessive influence of attorneys ===
Better Courts for Missouri has argued that flaws in the current plan give elite trial lawyers too much control over judicial selection. According to the organization&#x27;s executive director, &quot;they are a small, insular group who have their interests. They have a lot to add to the process, but we don&#x27;t think they should dominate the process - (and they) are in no way accountable to Missourians.&quot;

Professor Stephen Ware of the University of Kansas wrote about the Missouri Plan, &quot;As the bar is an elite segment of society, states that give lawyers more power than their fellow citizens are rightly described as &quot;elitist&quot;.&quot; Ware continued:

=== Low diversity of the Commission ===
Elbert Walton, a disbarred lawyer and former Missouri State legislator, believed that the plan had a negative effect on African Americans. &quot;It is unfair that lawyers elect judges ... It disenfranchises people and it especially disenfranchises black people.&quot; At a press conference in February, 2008, Walton accused Missouri Bar President Charlie Harris, an African-American, of ignoring the Missouri Plan&#x27;s effect on black people. Walton noted that no African American had ever been elected to one of the Missouri Bar&#x27;s three slots on the Appellate Judicial Commission, though many have been appointed judges, and suggested that Mr. Harris &quot;ought to be ashamed of himself&quot; for supporting such a plan. 

Governor Phil Bredesen of Tennessee has criticized that state&#x27;s version of the Missouri Plan for similar reasons. Despite criticisms from elected politicians such as Walton and Bredesen, no published research or data suggests that Missouri Plan states have less judicial diversity compared to non-Missouri Plan states.

=== Political interference ===
The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote &quot;If the recent slugfests have proven anything, it&#x27;s that Missouri&#x27;s courts are every bit as hung up in politics as they are in other states. The difference is that in Missouri the process happens behind closed doors.&quot;

Similarly, Professor Brian T. Fitzpatrick of Vanderbilt University has argued that politics are undoubtedly a part of judicial selection in Missouri Plan states, writing, &quot;In short, I am skeptical that merit selection &quot;removes&quot; politics from judicial selection. Rather, merit selection may simply &quot;move&quot; the politics of judicial selection into closer alignment with the ideological preferences of the bar.&quot; Fitzpatrick notes that &quot;…if we are willing to accept the notions that lawyers care about the outcomes of judicial decisions and that these outcomes are correlated with judges&#x27; ideological preferences, then we might expect merit commissions to select judges who share the ideological preferences of the bar rather than those of the public.&quot;

Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen has made similar complaints. He remarked, &quot;I think [the nominating commissioners] have been vastly too political in their selection process. And what they are supposed to do is give you the best candidates in the ideal world.&quot;

<text>The king is a playing card with a picture of a king displayed on it. The king is usually the highest-ranking face card. In the French version of playing cards and tarot decks, the king immediately outranks the queen. In Italian and Spanish playing cards, the king immediately outranks the knight. In German and Swiss playing cards, the king immediately outranks the &quot;Ober&quot;. In some games, the king is the highest-ranked card; in others, the Ace is higher. Aces began outranking kings around 1500 with Trappola being the earliest known game in which the aces were highest in all four suits. In the ace–ten family of games such as pinochle and Schnapsen, both the ace and the 10 rank higher than the king.

==History==
The king card is the oldest and most universal court card. It most likely originated in Persian Ganjifeh where kings are depicted as seated on thrones and outranking the viceroy cards which are mounted on horses. Playing cards were transmitted to Italy and Spain via the Mamluks and Moors. The best preserved and most complete deck of Mamluk cards, the Topkapı pack, did not display human figures but just listed their rank most likely due to religious prohibition. It is not entirely sure if the Topkapı pack was representative of all Mamluk decks as it was a custom-made luxury item used for display. A fragment of what may be a seated king card was recovered in Egypt which may explain why the poses of court cards in Europe resemble those in Persia and India.

Seated kings were generally common throughout Europe. During the 15th century, the Spanish started producing standing kings. The French originally used Spanish cards before developing their regional deck patterns. Many Spanish court designs were simply reused when the French invented their own suit-system around 1480. The English imported their cards from Rouen until the early 17th century when foreign card imports were banned. The king of hearts is sometimes called the &quot;suicide king&quot; because he appears to be sticking his sword into his head. This is a result of centuries of bad copying by English card makers where the king&#x27;s axe head has disappeared.

Starting in the 15th century, French manufacturers assigned to each of the court cards names taken from history or mythology. This practice survives only in the Paris pattern which ousted all its rivals, including the Rouen pattern around 1780. The names for the kings in the Paris pattern (&quot;portrait officiel&quot;) are:

Most French-suited continental European patterns are descended from the Paris pattern but they have dropped the names associated with each card.

<text>Lars Valter Hörmander (24 January 1931 – 25 November 2012) was a Swedish mathematician who has been called &quot;the foremost contributor to the modern theory of linear partial differential equations&quot;. Hörmander was awarded the Fields Medal in 1962 and the Wolf Prize in 1988. In 2006 he was awarded the Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition for his four-volume textbook &quot;Analysis of Linear Partial Differential Operators&quot;, which is considered a foundational work on the subject.

Hörmander completed his Ph.D. in 1955 at Lund University. Hörmander then worked at Stockholm University, at Stanford University, and at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He returned to Lund University as a professor from 1968 until 1996, when he retired with the title of professor emeritus.

==Biography==

===Education===
Hörmander was born in Mjällby, a village in Blekinge in southern Sweden where his father was a teacher. Like his older brothers and sisters before him, he attended the realskola (secondary school), in a nearby town to which he commuted by train, and the gymnasium (high school) in Lund from which he graduated in 1948.

At the time when he entered the gymnasium, the principal had instituted an experiment of reducing the period of the education from three to two years, and the daily activities to three hours. This freedom to work on his own, &quot;[greater] than the universities offer in Sweden today&quot;, suited Hörmander &quot;very well&quot;. He was also positively influenced by his enthusiastic mathematics teacher, a docent at Lund University who encouraged him to study university-level mathematics.

After proceeding to receive a Master&#x27;s degree from Lund University in 1950, Hörmander began his graduate studies under Marcel Riesz (who had also been the advisor for Hörmander&#x27;s gymnasium teacher). He made his first research attempts in classical function theory and harmonic analysis, which &quot;did not amount to much&quot; but were &quot;an excellent preparation for working in the theory of partial differential equations.&quot; He turned to partial differential equations when Riesz retired and Lars Gårding who worked actively in that area was appointed professor.

Hörmander took a one-year break for military service from 1953 to 1954, but due to his position in defense research was able to proceed with his studies even during that time. His Ph.D. thesis &quot;On the theory of general partial differential operators&quot; was finished in 1955, inspired by the nearly concurrent Ph.D. work of Bernard Malgrange and techniques for hyperbolic differential operators developed by Lars Gårding and Jean Leray.

===Fields Medal and years in the U.S.===
Hörmander applied for a professorship at Stockholm University, but temporarily left for the United States while the request was examined. He spent quarters from winter to fall in respective order at the University of Chicago, the University of Kansas, the University of Minnesota, and finally at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences in New York City. These locations offered &quot;much to learn&quot; in partial differential equations, with the exception of Chicago of which he however notes the Antoni Zygmund seminar held by Elias Stein and Guido Weiss to have strengthened his familiarity with harmonic analysis.

In the theory of linear differential operators, &quot;many people have contributed but the deepest and most significant results are due to Hörmander&quot;, according to Hörmander&#x27;s doctoral advisor, Lars Gårding. Hörmander won the Fields medal in 1962.

Hörmander was given a position as a part-time professor at Stanford in 1963 but was soon thereafter offered a professorship at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He first wished not to leave Sweden but attempts to find a research professorship in Sweden failed and &quot;the opportunity to do research full time in a mathematically very active environment was hard to resist&quot;, so he accepted the offer and resigned from both Stanford and Stockholm and began at the Institute in the fall of 1964. Within two years of &quot;hard work&quot;, he felt that the environment at the institute was too demanding, and in 1967 decided to return to Lund after one year. He later noted that his best work at the institute was done during the remaining year.

===Later years===
Hörmander mostly remained at Lund University as a professor after 1968 but made several visits to the United States during the two next decades. He visited the Courant Institute in 1970, and also the Institute for Advanced Study in 1971 and during the academic year, 1977–1978 when a special year in microlocal analysis was held. He also visited Stanford in 1971, 1977, and 1982, and the University of California, San Diego in winter 1990. Hörmander was briefly director of the Mittag-Leffler Institute in Stockholm between 1984 and 1986 but only accepted a two-year appointment as he &quot;suspected that the administrative duties would not agree well&quot; with him, and found that &quot;the hunch was right&quot;. He also served as vice president of the International Mathematical Union between 1987 and 1990. Hörmander retired emeritus in Lund in January 1996. In 2006 he was honored with the Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition from the American Mathematical Society.

He was made a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1968. In 1970 he gave a plenary address (Linear Differential Operators) at the ICM in Nice.

He received the 1988 Wolf Prize &quot;for fundamental work in modern analysis, in particular, the application of pseudo differential and Fourier integral operators to linear partial differential equations&quot;.

In 2012 he was selected as a fellow of the American Mathematical Society, but died on 25 November 2012, before the list of fellows was released.

==Important publications==
His book &quot;Linear Partial Differential Operators&quot;, which largely was the cause for his Fields Medal, has been described as &quot;the first major account of this theory&quot;. It was published by Springer-Verlag in 1963 as part of the &quot;Grundlehren&quot; series.

Hörmander devoted five years to compiling the four-volume monograph, &quot;The Analysis of Linear Partial Differential Operators&quot;, first published between 1983 and 1985. A follow-up of his &quot;Linear Partial Differential Operators&quot;, &quot;illustrate[d] the vast expansion of the subject&quot; over the past 20 years, and is considered the &quot;standard of the field&quot;. In addition to these works, he has written a recognised introduction to 
several complex variables based on his 1964 Stanford lectures, and wrote the entries on differential equations in Nationalencyklopedin.

<doc id="500959" wikidata="Q601818" url="?curid=500959" title="Henderson–Hasselbalch equation">
<text>In chemistry and biochemistry, the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation
formula_1
relates the pH of a chemical solution of a weak acid to the numerical value of the acid dissociation constant, &quot;K&quot;a, of acid and the ratio of the concentrations, formula_2 of the acid and its conjugate base in an equilibrium. 
:formula_3
:For example, the acid may be carbonic acid
:formula_4
The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation can be used to estimate the pH of a buffer solution by approximating the actual concentration ratio as the ratio of the analytical concentrations of the acid and of a salt, MA.

The equation can also be applied to bases by specifying the protonated form of the base as the acid. For example, with an amine, formula_5
:formula_6
The Henderson–Hasselbach buffer system also has many natural and biological applications.

==History==
The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation was developed by two scientists, Lawrence Joseph Henderson and Karl Albert Hasselbalch. Lawrence Joseph Henderson was a biological chemist and Karl Albert Hasselbalch was a physiologist who studied pH.

In 1908, Lawrence Joseph Henderson derived an equation to calculate the hydrogen ion concentration of a bicarbonate buffer solution, which rearranged looks like this:

In 1909 Søren Peter Lauritz Sørensen introduced the pH terminology, which allowed Karl Albert Hasselbalch to re-express Henderson&#x27;s equation in logarithmic terms, resulting in the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation.

==Assumptions, limitations, and derivation==

A simple buffer solution consists of a solution of an acid and a salt of the conjugate base of the acid. For example, the acid may be acetic acid and the salt may be sodium acetate. The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation relates the pH of a solution containing a mixture of the two components to the acid dissociation constant, &quot;K&quot;a of the acid, and the concentrations of the species in solution. 
To derive the equation a number of simplifying assumptions have to be made.

Assumption 1: The acid, HA, is monobasic and dissociates according to the equations
:formula_7
:formula_8
:formula_9
CA is the analytical concentration of the acid and CH is the concentration the hydrogen ion that has been added to the solution. The self-dissociation of water is ignored. A quantity in square brackets, [X], represents the concentration of the chemical substance X. It is understood that the symbol H+ stands for the hydrated hydronium ion. Ka is an acid dissociation constant.

The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation can be applied to a polybasic acid only if its consecutive p&quot;K&quot; values differ by at least 3. Phosphoric acid is such an acid.

Assumption 2. The self-ionization of water can be ignored. This assumption is not, strictly speaking, valid with pH values close to 7, half the value of pKw, the constant for self-ionization of water. In this case the mass-balance equation for hydrogen should be extended to take account of the self-ionization of water.
:formula_10
However, the term formula_11 can be omitted to a good approximation.

Assumption 3: The salt MA is completely dissociated in solution. For example, with sodium acetate
:formula_12
the concentration of the sodium ion, [Na+] can be ignored. This is a good approximation for 1:1 electrolytes, but not for salts of ions that have a higher charge such as magnesium sulphate, MgSO4, that form ion pairs.

Assumption 4: The quotient of activity coefficients, formula_13, is a constant under the experimental conditions covered by the calculations.

The thermodynamic equilibrium constant, formula_14, 
:formula_15 
is a product of a quotient of concentrations formula_16 and a quotient, formula_17, of activity coefficients formula_18. In these expressions, the quantities in square brackets signify the concentration of the undissociated acid, HA, of the hydrogen ion H+, and of the anion A−; the quantities formula_19 are the corresponding activity coefficients. If the quotient of activity coefficients can be assumed to be a constant which is independent of concentrations and pH, the dissociation constant, &quot;K&quot;a can be expressed as a quotient of concentrations. 
:formula_20

=== Derivation ===
Source:

Following these assumptions, the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation is derived in a few logarithmic steps.formula_21

Solve for formula_22:formula_23

On both sides, take the negative logarithm:formula_24

Based on previous assumptions, formula_25 and formula_26formula_27

Inversion of formula_28 by changing its sign, provides the Henderson–Hasselbalch equationformula_29

==Application to bases==
The equilibrium constant for the protonation of a base, B, 
: + H+ 
is an association constant, &quot;K&quot;b, which is simply related to the dissociation constant of the conjugate acid, BH+.
:formula_30
The value of formula_31 is ca. 14 at 25 °C. This approximation can be used when the correct value is not known. Thus, the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation can be used, without modification, for bases.

==Biological applications==
With homeostasis the pH of a biological solution is maintained at a constant value by adjusting the position of the equilibria
:formula_32
where formula_33 is the bicarbonate ion and formula_34 is carbonic acid. Carbonic acid is formed reversibly from carbon dioxide and water. However, the solubility of carbonic acid in water may be exceeded. When this happens carbon dioxide gas is liberated and the following equation may be used instead.
:formula_35
formula_36 represents the carbon dioxide liberated as gas. In this equation, which is widely used in biochemistry, formula_37 is a mixed equilibrium constant relating to both chemical and solubility equilibria. It can be expressed as
:formula_38
where is the molar concentration of bicarbonate in the blood plasma and is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the supernatant gas. The concentration of formula_34 is dependent on the formula_40which is also dependent on .

One of the buffer systems present in the body is the blood plasma buffering system. This is formed from formula_41, carbonic acid, working in conjunction with , bicarbonate, to form the bicarbonate system. This is effective near physiological pH of 7.4 as carboxylic acid is in equilibrium with formula_42 in the lungs. As blood travels through the body, it gains and loses H+ from different processes including lactic acid fermentation and by NH3 protonation from protein catabolism. Because of this the formula_43, changes in the blood as it passes through tissues. This correlates to a change in the partial pressure of formula_36 in the lungs causing a change in the rate of respiration if more or less formula_42 is necessary. For example, a decreased blood pH will trigger the brain stem to perform more frequent respiration. The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation can be used to model these equilibria. It is important to maintain this pH of 7.4 to ensure enzymes are able to work optimally.

Life threatening Acidosis (a low blood pH resulting in nausea, headaches, and even coma, and convulsions) is due to a lack of functioning of enzymes at a low pH. As modelled by the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, in severe cases this can be reversed by administering intravenous bicarbonate solution. If the partial pressure of formula_42 does not change, this addition of bicarbonate solution will raise the blood pH.

== Natural buffers ==
The ocean contains a natural buffer system to maintain a pH between 8.1 and 8.3. The oceans buffer system is known as the carbonate buffer system. The carbonate buffer system is a series of reactions that uses carbonate as a buffer to convert formula_47 into bicarbonate. The carbonate buffer reaction helps maintain a constant H+ concentration in the ocean because it consumes hydrogen ions, and thereby maintains a constant pH. The ocean has been experiencing ocean acidification due to humans increasing formula_47 in the atmosphere. About 30% of the formula_47 that is released in the atmosphere is absorbed by the ocean, and the increase in formula_47 absorption results in an increase in H+ ion production. The increase in atmospheric formula_51 increases H+ ion production because in the ocean formula_51 reacts with water and produces carbonic acid, and carbonic acid releases H+ ions and bicarbonate ions. Overall, since the Industrial Revolution the ocean has experienced a pH decrease by about 0.1 pH units due to the increase in formula_47 production.

Ocean acidification affects marine life that have shells that are made up of carbonate. In a more acidic environment it is harder organisms to grow and maintain the carbonate shells. The increase of ocean acidity can cause carbonate shell organisms to experience reduced growth and reproduction.

<text>The queen is a playing card with a picture of a queen on it. In many European languages, the king and queen begin with the same letter so the latter is often called &quot;dame&quot; (lady) or variations thereof. In French playing cards, the usual rank of a queen is between the king and the jack. In tarot decks, it outranks the knight which in turn outranks the jack. In the Spanish deck and some Italian decks, the Queen does not exist and the Knight appears in them instead, with the same role and value.

In several card games, including the middle eastern Trex and French Barbu, the queen is a major card to avoid taking, with each queen taken inflicting a penalty on the player. Similarly, in Hearts, the queen of spades is to be avoided, and is called a variety of unsavoury names.

In the Paris pattern, each court card is identified as a particular historical or mythological personage as follows:

Queens may have been an invention of early German cardmakers. One of the earliest surviving packs of playing cards, the Stuttgart pack (circa 1440), consists of all female courts in two of the four suits where Queens have replaced Kings. The Ambraser Hofjagdspiel (circa 1440 to 1445) and many other surviving 15th-century packs include the Queen as a fourth independent rank from the King, Ober, and Unter. Modern German-suited playing cards have dropped the Queen rank, but French-suited playing cards have since adopted it as a replacement for the Knights.

==Cultural references==
Regarding the anonymous nursery rhyme, &quot;The Queen of Hearts&quot; (published 1782), Katherine Elwes Thomas claims, in &quot;The Real Personage of Mother Goose&quot;, that the Queen of Hearts was based on Elizabeth of Bohemia. Benham, in his book &quot;Playing Cards: History of the Pack and Explanations of its Many Secrets&quot;, notes that French playing cards from the mid-17th century have Judith from the Hebrew Bible as the Queen of Hearts.

<text>A Jack or Knave, in some games referred to as a Bower, in Tarot card games as a Valet, is a playing card which, in traditional French and English decks, pictures a man in the traditional or historic aristocratic or courtier dress generally associated with Europe of the 16th or 17th century. The usual rank of a jack is between the ten and the queen. The Jack corresponds to the Unter in German and Swiss-suited playing cards.

==History==

The earliest predecessor of the knave was the (second or under-deputy) in the Mamluk card deck. This was the lowest of the three court cards and like all court cards was depicted through abstract art or calligraphy. When brought over to Italy and Spain, the was made into the (an infantry soldier) and the (a page ranking below the knight card) respectively. In France, where the card was called the valet, the queen was inserted between the king and knight. The knight was subsequently dropped out of non-Tarot decks leaving the valet directly under the queen. The king-queen-valet format then made its way into England.
As early as the mid-16th century the card was known in England as the knave which originally meant &#x27;boy or young man&#x27;, as its German equivalent, Knabe, still does. In the context of a royal household it meant a male servant without a specific role or skill; not a cook, gardener, coachman, etc. The French word valet means the same thing.

The word &#x27;Jack&#x27; was in common usage in the 16th and 17th centuries to mean any generic man or fellow, as in Jack-of-all-trades (one who is good at many things), Jack-in-the-box (a child&#x27;s toy), or Jack-in-the-Pulpit (a plant).

The term became more entrenched in card play when, in 1864, American cardmaker Samuel Hart published a deck using &quot;J&quot; instead of &quot;Kn&quot; to designate the lowest-ranking court card. The knave card had been called a jack as part of the terminology of the game All Fours since the 17th century, but this usage was considered common or low class. However, because the card abbreviation for knave was so close to that of the king (&quot;Kn&quot; versus &quot;K&quot;), the two were easily confused. This confusion was even more pronounced after the markings indicating suits and rankings were moved to the corners of the card, a move which enabled players to &quot;fan&quot; a hand of cards without obscuring the individual suits and ranks. The earliest deck known of this type is from 1693, but such positioning did not become widespread until reintroduced by Hart in 1864, together with the knave-to-jack change. Books of card games published in the third quarter of the 19th century still referred to the &quot;knave&quot;. Note the exclamation by Estella in Charles Dickens&#x27;s novel &quot;Great Expectations&quot;: &quot;He calls the knaves, jacks, this boy!&quot; Knave was the proper term and it was considered uncouth to call them &#x27;Jacks&#x27;. Nevertheless, in a few European countries, the equivalent of the name &#x27;knave&#x27; for this card continues to the present. For example, in Denmark, it is the &quot;Knægt&quot;, symbol B (for &quot;Bonde&quot;); in Sweden, the &quot;knekt&quot;, symbol Kn.

The German nickname of &quot;Bauer&quot; (&quot;farmer&quot; or &quot;peasant&quot;) often used for the Jacks, appears in English as the loanword, Bower, used for the top trumps (usually Jacks) in games of the euchre family as well as some games of German origin where the Jacks play a significant role, e.g. Reunion.

==Representations==

In the English pattern, the jack and the other face cards represent no one in particular, in contrast to the historical French practice, in which each court card is said to represent a particular historical or mythological personage. The valets in the Paris pattern have traditionally been associated with such figures as Ogier the Dane (a knight of Charlemagne and legendary hero of the chansons de geste) for the jack of spades; La Hire (French warrior) for the Jack of Hearts; Hector (mythological hero of the Iliad) for the jack of diamonds; and Lancelot or Judas Maccabeus for the jack of clubs.

In some southern Italian decks, there are androgynous knaves that are sometimes referred to as maids. In the Sicilian Tarot deck, the knaves are unambiguously female and are also known as maids. As this deck also includes queens, it is the only traditional set to survive into modern times with two ranks of female face cards. This pack may have been influenced by the obsolete Portuguese deck which also had female knaves. The modern Mexican pattern also has female knaves.

==Poetry==
The figure of the jack has been used in many literary works throughout history. Among these is one by 17th-century English writer Samuel Rowlands. &quot;The Four Knaves&quot; is a series of Satirical Tracts, with Introduction and Notes by E. F. Rimbault, upon the subject of playing cards. His &quot;The Knave of Clubbs: Tis Merry When Knaves Meet&quot; was first published in 1600, then again in 1609 and 1611. In accordance with a promise at the end of this book, Rowlands went on with his series of Knaves, and in 1612 wrote &quot;The Knave of Harts: Haile Fellowe, Well Meet&quot;, where his &quot;Supplication to Card-Makers&quot; appears, thought to have been written to the English manufacturers who copied to the English decks the court figures created by the French.
The Knave of Hearts appears as a thieving antagonist in the traditional children&#x27;s poem &quot;The Queen of Hearts&quot;

==Example cards==
The cards shown here are from a Paris pattern deck (where the rank is known as the &quot;valet&quot;), and include the historical and mythological names associated with them. The English pattern of jacks can be seen in the photo at the top of the article.
==Trickster figure==

The jack, traditionally the lowest face card, has often been promoted to a higher or the highest position in the traditional ranking of cards, where the ace or king generally occupied the first rank. This is seen in the earliest known European card games, such as Karnöffel, as well as in more recent ones such as Euchre. Games with such promotion include:

<text>John Heinrich Detlef Rabe (23 November 1882 – 5 January 1950) was a de-nazified businessman and diplomat best known for his efforts to stop war crimes during the Japanese Nanjing Massacre and protect Chinese civilians. The Nanking Safety Zone, which he helped to establish, sheltered approximately 250,000 Chinese people from attack by the Imperial Japanese Army. He had been sent to China as an official German representative in the European-U.S. diplomatic quarter in Nanjing, the Chinese capital. He served as senior chief of the diplomatic mission at the time of Japanese conquest.

== Early life and career ==

Rabe was born in Hamburg on 23 November 1882. He pursued a career in business and worked in Africa for several years.

In 1908, he left for China, and between 1910 and 1938 worked for the Siemens AG China Corporation in Shenyang, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and later Nanjing. Rabe suffered from diabetes by the time he worked in Nanjing, requiring him to take regular doses of insulin. At the time of the Japanese attack on Nanjing, Rabe was a staunch Nazi and the party&#x27;s local head, serving as a Deputy Group Leader in the Nazi Party.

== Establishment of the Nanking Safety Zone ==


Many Westerners were living in Nanjing, the Chinese capital city, until December 1937, with some conducting trade and others on missionary trips. As the Imperial Japanese Army approached Nanjing and initiated bombing raids on the city, all but 22 foreigners fled, with 15 American and European missionaries and businessmen forming part of the remaining group. As the Japanese Army advanced on Nanjing on 22 November 1937, Rabe, along with other foreign nationals, organized the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone and created the Nanking Safety Zone to provide Chinese refugees with food and shelter from the impending Japanese massacre. He explained his reasons as: &quot;there is a question of morality here… I cannot bring myself for now to betray the trust these people have put in me, and it is touching to see how they believe in me&quot;. The zones were located in all of the foreign embassies and at Nanjing University.

The committee was inspired by the establishment in November of a similar neutral zone in Shanghai, which had protected approximately 450,000 civilians. Rabe was elected leader of the committee, in part because of his Nazi Party status and the German-Japanese bilateral Anti-Comintern Pact. The committee established the Nanking Safety Zone in the western quarter of the city. The Japanese government had agreed not to attack parts of the city that did not contain Chinese military forces and the members of the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone attempted to persuade the Chinese government to move all their troops out of the area. In this they were partly successful. On 1 December 1937, before fleeing the city, Nanjing Mayor Ma Chao-chun ordered all Chinese citizens remaining in Nanjing to move into the Safety Zone. When Nanjing fell on 13 December 1937, 500,000 non-combatants remained in the city. Rabe also opened up his properties to help 650 more refugees.

== Nanjing Massacre ==

According to Rabe, the Nanjing Massacre resulted in the deaths of 50,000 to 60,000 civilians. Rabe and his zone administrators tried frantically to stop the atrocities. Modern estimates of the death toll of the Nanjing Massacre vary, but some put the number of murdered civilians as high as 300,000. Rabe&#x27;s appeals to the Japanese using his Nazi Party credentials often only delayed them, but the delay allowed hundreds of thousands of refugees to escape. The documentary &quot;Nanking&quot; credited Rabe with saving the lives of 250,000 Chinese civilians; other sources suggest he saved 250,000 to 300,000. In his diary, Rabe documented Japanese atrocities committed during the assault on and occupation of the city.

In a series of lectures that he gave in Germany after his return, Rabe would say that &quot;We Europeans put the number [of civilian casualties] at about 50,000 to 60,000&quot;. Rabe was not the only person to record Japanese atrocities. By December 1937, after the defeat of the Chinese force, Japanese soldiers often went house-to-house in Nanjing, shooting any civilians that they encountered. Additional evidence of these violent acts came from the diaries kept by Japanese soldiers and journalists appalled at what occurred.

Rabe summarized the conduct of Japanese soldiers in Nanjing in the following manner:

I&#x27;ve written several times in this diary about the body of the Chinese soldier who was shot while tied to his bamboo bed and who is still lying unburied near my house. My protests and pleas to the Japanese embassy finally to get this corpse buried, or give me permission to bury it, have thus far been fruitless. The body is still lying in the same spot as before, except that the ropes have been cut and the bamboo bed is now lying about two yards away. I am totally puzzled by the conduct of the Japanese in this matter. On the one hand, they want to be recognized and treated as a great power on a par with European powers, on the other, they are currently displaying a crudity, brutality, and bestiality that bears no comparison except with the hordes of Genghis Khan. I have stopped trying to get the poor devil buried, but I hereby record that he, though very dead, still lies above the earth!
== Return to Germany ==

On 28 February 1938, Rabe left Nanjing. He traveled first to Shanghai, returning to Berlin on 15 April 1938. He took with him a large number of source materials documenting Japanese atrocities in Nanjing. Rabe showed films and photographs of Japanese atrocities in lecture presentations in Berlin, and he wrote to Hitler, asking him to use his influence to persuade the Japanese to stop further violence. Rabe was detained and interrogated by the Gestapo; his letter was never delivered to Hitler. Due to the intervention of Siemens AG, Rabe was released. He was allowed to keep evidence of the massacre (excluding films) but not to lecture or write on the subject again. Rabe continued working for Siemens, which briefly posted him to the safety of Siemens AG in Afghanistan. Rabe subsequently worked in the company&#x27;s Berlin headquarters until the end of the war.

== Postwar ==

After the war, Rabe was arrested first by the Soviet NKVD, then by the British Army. Both let him go after intense interrogation. He worked sporadically for Siemens, earning little. He was later denounced by an acquaintance for his Nazi Party membership, losing the work permit he had been given by the British Zone of Occupation. Rabe then had to undergo lengthy de-Nazification (his first attempt was rejected and he had to appeal) in the hope of regaining permission to work. He depleted his savings to pay for his legal defence.

Unable to work and with his savings spent, Rabe and his family survived in a one-room apartment by selling his Chinese art collection but it was insufficient to prevent their malnutrition. He was formally declared &quot;de-Nazified&quot; by the British on 3 June 1946 but continued to live in poverty. His family subsisted on wild seeds, his children eating soup and dry bread until running out of that as well. In 1948, Nanjing citizens learned of the Rabe family&#x27;s dire circumstances and quickly raised a sum of money equivalent to $2,000 USD ($ in 2025). The city&#x27;s mayor traveled to Germany via Switzerland, where he bought a large amount of food for the Rabe family. From mid-1948 until the Chinese Revolution, the people of Nanjing also sent the family a food package each month, for which Rabe wrote many letters expressing deep gratitude.

== Death and legacy ==

On 5 January 1950, Rabe died of a stroke. In 1997, his tombstone was moved from Berlin to Nanjing, where it received a place of honour at the massacre memorial site and still stands today. In 2005, Rabe&#x27;s former residence in Nanjing, the John Rabe House, was restored to its former state; it houses the John Rabe and International Safety Zone Memorial Hall, opened in 2006. The Austrian Service Abroad was later invited to send a Peace Servant there. 

Rabe&#x27;s grave in Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Cemetery in Berlin-Charlottenburg was re-erected in 2013. 

His bravery would earn him the monikers: &quot;The Living Buddha of Nanjing&quot;, &quot;The Good Nazi&quot; and &quot;The Schindler of Nanking&quot; by the Chinese.

== War diaries ==

A selection of Rabe&#x27;s wartime diaries was published in English as &quot;The Good German of Nanking&quot; (UK title) or &quot;The Good Man of Nanking&quot; (US title) (original German title: &quot;Der gute Deutsche von Nanking&quot;).

<text>A mudra (; , , &quot;seal&quot;, &quot;mark&quot;, or &quot;gesture&quot;; ) is a symbolic or ritual gesture or pose in Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. While some mudras involve the entire body, most are performed with the hands and fingers.

As well as being spiritual gestures employed in the iconography and spiritual practice of Indian religions, mudras have meaning in many forms of Indian dance, and yoga. The range of mudras used in each field (and religion) differs, but with some overlap. In addition, many of the Buddhist mudras are used outside South Asia, and have developed different local forms elsewhere.

In hatha yoga, mudras are used in conjunction with pranayama (yogic breathing exercises), generally while in a seated posture, to stimulate different parts of the body involved with breathing and to affect the flow of prana. It is also associated with bindu, bodhicitta, amrita, or consciousness in the body. Unlike older tantric mudras, hatha yogic mudras are generally internal actions, involving the pelvic floor, diaphragm, throat, eyes, tongue, anus, genitals, abdomen, and other parts of the body. Examples of this diversity of mudras are Mula Bandha, Mahamudra, Viparita Karani, Khecarī mudrā, and Vajroli mudra. These expanded in number from 3 in the &quot;Amritasiddhi&quot;, to 25 in the &quot;Gheranda Samhita&quot;, with a classical set of ten arising in the &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&quot;.

Mudra is used in the iconography of Hindu and Buddhist art of the Indian subcontinent and described in the scriptures, such as &quot;Nātyaśāstra&quot;, which lists 24 &#x27; (&quot;separated&quot;, meaning &quot;one-hand&quot;) and 13&#x27; (&quot;joined&quot;, meaning &quot;two-hand&quot;) mudras. Mudra positions are usually formed by both the hand and the fingers. Along with &quot;āsanas&quot; (&quot;seated postures&quot;), they are employed statically in the meditation and dynamically in the practice of Hinduism.

Hindu and Buddhist iconography share some mudras. In some regions, for example in Laos and Thailand, these are distinct but share related iconographic conventions.

According to Jamgön Kongtrül in his commentary on the &quot;Hevajra Tantra&quot;, the ornaments of wrathful deities and witches made of human bones (Skt: ; ) are also known as mudra &quot;seals&quot;.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
The word mudrā has Sanskrit roots. According to scholar Sir Monier Monier-Williams it means &quot;seal&quot; or &quot;any other instrument used for sealing&quot;.

==Buddhist Iconography==
A Buddha image can have one of several common mudras, combined with different asanas. The main mudras used represent specific moments in the life of the Buddha, and are shorthand depictions of these.

=== Abhaya Mudrā ===
The &quot;Abhayamudra&quot; &quot;gesture of fearlessness&quot; represents protection, peace, benevolence and the dispelling of fear. In Theravada Buddhism it is usually made while standing with the right arm bent and raised to shoulder height, the palm facing forward, the fingers closed, pointing upright and the left hand resting by the side. In Thailand and Laos, this mudra is associated with the &quot;Walking Buddha&quot;, sometimes also shown having both hands making a double abhaya mudra that is uniform.

This mudra was probably used before the onset of Buddhism as a symbol of good intentions proposing friendship when approaching strangers. In Gandharan art, it is seen when showing the action of preaching. It was also used in China during the Wei and Sui eras of the 4th and 7th centuries.

This gesture was used by the Buddha when attacked by an elephant, subduing it as shown in several frescoes and scripts.

In Mahayana Buddhism, the deities are often portrayed as pairing the Abhaya Mudrā with another Mudrā using the other hand.

===Bhūmisparśa Mudrā===

The &quot;bhūmisparśa&quot; or &quot;earth witness&quot; mudra of Gautama Buddha is one of the most common iconic images of Buddhism. Other names include &quot;Buddha calling the earth to witness&quot;, and &quot;earth-touching&quot;. It depicts the story from Buddhist legend of the moment when Buddha attained complete enlightenment, with Buddha sitting in meditation with his left hand, palm upright, in his lap, and his right hand touching the earth. In the legend, Buddha was challenged by the evil one, Mara, who argue for a witness to attest his right to achieve it. In response to Mara, Buddha touched the ground, and Phra Mae Thorani, the earth goddess, appeared to be the witnesses for the Buddha&#x27;s enlightenment.

In East Asia, this mudra (also called the Maravijaya attitude) may show Buddha&#x27;s fingers not reaching as far as the ground, as is usual in Burmese or Indian depictions.

===Bodhyangi Mudrā===

The &quot;Bodhyangi mudrā&quot;, the &quot;mudrā of the six elements,&quot; or the &quot;fist of wisdom,&quot; is a gesture entailing the left-hand index finger being grasped with the right hand. It is commonly seen on statues of the Vairocana Buddha.

===Dharmachakra Pravartana Mudrā===

The Buddha preached his first sermon after his Enlightenment in Deer Park in Sarnath. The dharmachakra Pravartana or &quot;turning of the wheel&quot; mudrā represents that moment. In general, only Gautama Buddha is shown making this mudrā except Maitreya as the dispenser of the Law. Dharmachakra mudrā is two hands close together in front of the chest in vitarka with the right palm forward and the left palm upwards, sometimes facing the chest.
There are several variants such as in the Ajanta Caves frescoes, where the two hands are separated and the fingers do not touch. In the Indo-Greek style of Gandhara, the clenched fist of the right hand seemingly overlies the fingers joined to the thumb on the left hand. In pictorials of Hōryū-ji in Japan the right hand is superimposed on the left. Certain figures of Amitābha are seen using this mudra before the 9th century in Japan.

===Dhyāna Mudrā===
The &quot;dhyāna mudrā&quot; (&quot;meditation mudra&quot;) is the gesture of meditation, of the concentration of the Good Law and the sangha. The two hands are placed on the lap, right hand on left with fingers fully stretched (four fingers resting on each other and the thumbs facing upwards towards one another diagonally), palms facing upwards; in this manner, the hands and fingers form the shape of a triangle, which is symbolic of the spiritual fire or the Three Jewels.
This mudra is used in representations of Gautama Buddha and Amitābha. Sometimes the dhyāna mudrā is used in certain representations of as the &quot;Medicine Buddha&quot;, with a medicine bowl placed on the hands. It originated in India most likely in Gandhāra and in China during the Northern Wei.

It is heavily used in Southeast Asia in Theravada Buddhism; however, the thumbs are placed against the palms. Dhyāna mudrā is also known as &quot;samādhi mudrā&quot; or &quot;yoga mudrā&quot;, .

The &quot;mida no jōin&quot; (弥陀定印) is the Japanese name of a variation of the dhyāna mudra, where the index fingers are brought together with the thumbs. This was predominantly used in Japan in an effort to distinguish Amitābha (hence &quot;mida&quot; from Amida) from the Vairocana Buddha, and was rarely used elsewhere.

=== Varada Mudrā ===

The &quot;Varadamudrā&quot; &quot;generosity gesture&quot; signifies offering, welcome, charity, giving, compassion and sincerity. It is nearly always shown made with the left hand by a revered figure devoted to human salvation from greed, anger and delusion. It can be made with the arm crooked and the palm offered slightly turned up or in the case of the arm facing down the palm presented with the fingers upright or slightly bent. The Varada mudrā is rarely seen without another mudra used by the right hand, typically abhaya mudrā. It is often confused with vitarka mudrā, which it closely resembles. In China and Japan during the Northern Wei and Asuka periods, respectively, the fingers are stiff and then gradually begin to loosen as it developed over time, eventually leading to the Tang dynasty standard where the fingers are naturally curved.

In India, varada mudra is used by both seated and standing figures, of Buddha and boddhisattvas and other figures, and in Hindu art is especially associated with Vishnu. It was used in images of Avalokiteśvara from Gupta art (4th and 5th centuries) onwards. Varada mudrā is extensively used in the statues of Southeast Asia.

===Vajra Mudrā===

The &quot;Vajra mudrā&quot; &quot;thunder gesture&quot; is the gesture of knowledge. 

===Vitarka Mudrā===

The &quot;Vitarka mudrā&quot; &quot;mudra of discussion&quot; is the gesture of discussion and transmission of Buddhist teaching. It is done by joining the tips of the thumb and the index together, and keeping the other fingers straight very much like the abhaya and varada mudrās but with the thumbs touching the index fingers. This mudra has a great number of variants in Mahayana Buddhism. In Tibetan Buddhism, it is the mystic gesture of Tārās and bodhisattvas with some differences by the deities in Yab-Yum. Vitarka mudrā is also known as &quot;Vyākhyāna mudrā&quot; (&quot;mudra of explanation&quot;). This is also called as chin-mudra.

===Jñāna Mudrā===

The &quot;Jñāna mudrā&quot; (&quot;mudra of wisdom&quot;) is done by touching the tips of the thumb and the index together, forming a circle, and the hand is held with the palm inward towards the heart. The mudra represents spiritual enlightenment in the indian-origin religions. Sometimes sadhus chose to be buried alive in this samadhi position. A 2700 old skeleton arranged like this was found at Balathal in Rajasthan, suggesting that something like yoga may have existed at that time.

===Karana Mudrā===

The &quot;karana mudrā&quot; is the mudra which expels demons and removes obstacles such as sickness or negative thoughts. It is made by raising the index and the little finger, and folding the other fingers. It is nearly the same as the Western &quot;sign of the horns&quot;, the difference is that in the Karana mudra the thumb does not hold down the middle and ring finger. This mudra is also known as &quot;tarjanī mudrā.&quot;

==Indian classical dance==

In Indian classical dance and derived dances (such as Khmer, Thai or Balinese), the term &quot;Hasta Mudra&quot; is used (although, there are terms used for mudras in derived dances). The &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; describes 24 mudras, while the &quot;Abhinaya Darpana&quot; of Nandikeshvara gives 28. In all their forms of Indian classical dance, the mudras are similar, though the names and uses vary. There are 28 (or 32) root mudras in Bharatanatyam, 24 in Kathakali and 20 in Odissi. These root mudras are combined in different ways, like one hand, two hands, arm movements, body and facial expressions. In Kathakali, which has the greatest number of combinations, the vocabulary adds up to c. 900. Sanyukta mudras use both hands and asanyukta mudras use one hand. In Thai dances, there are 9 mudras.

== Yoga ==


The classical sources for the yogic seals are the &quot;Gheranda Samhita&quot; and the &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&quot;. The &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&quot; states the importance of mudras in yoga practice: &quot;Therefore the [Kundalini] goddess sleeping at the entrance of Brahma&#x27;s door [at the base of the spine] should be constantly aroused with all effort, by performing mudra thoroughly.&quot; In the 20th and 21st centuries, the yoga teacher Satyananda Saraswati, founder of the Bihar School of Yoga, continued to emphasize the importance of mudras in his instructional text &quot;Asana, Pranayama, Mudrā, Bandha&quot;.

=== Hand Gestures ===
There are numerous hand gesture &quot;mudras&quot; in yoga. Each of the hand gestures is based on the concept of the five elements as they relate to one&#x27;s fingers.

=== Hatha Yoga ===
The yoga mudras are diverse in the parts of the body involved and in the procedures required, as in Mula Bandha, Mahamudra, Viparita Karani, Khecarī mudrā, and Vajroli mudra.

==== Mula Bandha ====

Mula Bandha, the Root Lock, consists of pressing one heel into the anus, generally in a cross-legged seated asana, and contracting the perineum, forcing the prana to enter the central sushumna channel.

==== Mahamudra ====
Mahamudra, the Great Seal, similarly has one heel pressed into the perineum; the chin is pressed down to the chest in Jalandhara Bandha, the Throat Lock, and the breath is held with the body&#x27;s upper and lower openings both sealed, again to force the prana into the sushumna channel.

==== Viparita Karani ====
Viparita Karani, the Inverter, is a posture with the head down and the feet up, using gravity to retain the prana. Gradually the time spent in the posture is increased until it can be held for &quot;three hours&quot;. The practice is claimed by the &quot;Dattatreyayogashastra&quot; to destroy all diseases and to banish grey hair and wrinkles.

==== Khechari mudra ====
Khecarī mudrā, the Khechari Seal, consists of turning back the tongue &quot;into the hollow of the skull&quot;, sealing in the &quot;bindu&quot; fluid so that it stops dripping down from the head and being lost, even when the yogi &quot;embraces a passionate woman&quot;. To make the tongue long and flexible enough to be folded back in this way, the &quot;Khecharividya&quot; exhorts the yogi to make a cut a hair&#x27;s breadth deep in the frenulum of the tongue once a week. Six months of this treatment destroys the frenulum, leaving the tongue able to fold back; then the yogi is advised to practise stretching the tongue out, holding it with a cloth, to lengthen it, and to learn to touch each ear in turn, and the base of the chin. After six years of practice, which cannot be hurried, the tongue is said to become able to close the top end of the sushumna channel.

==== Vajroli mudra ====
Vajroli mudra, the Vajroli Seal, requires the yogi to preserve the semen, either by learning not to release it, or if released by drawing it up through the urethra from the vagina of &quot;a woman devoted to the practice of yoga&quot;.

==Martial arts==
Some Asian martial arts forms contain positions (Japanese: &quot;in&quot;) identical to these mudras. Tendai and Shingon Buddhism derived the supposedly powerful gestures from Mikkyo Buddhism, still to be found in many Ko-ryū (&quot;old&quot;) martial arts &quot;Ryū&quot; (schools) founded before the 17th century. For example the &quot;knife hand&quot; or &quot;shuto&quot; gesture is subtly concealed in some Koryu kata, and in Buddhist statues, representing the sword of enlightenment.

<text>Mac OS X 10.1 (code named Puma) is the second major release of macOS, Apple&#x27;s desktop and server operating system. It superseded Mac OS X 10.0 and preceded Mac OS X Jaguar. Mac OS X 10.1 was released on September 25, 2001, as a free update for Mac OS X 10.0 users. 
The operating system was handed out for free by Apple employees after Steve Jobs&#x27; keynote speech at the Seybold publishing conference in San Francisco. It was subsequently distributed to Mac users on October 25, 2001, at Apple Stores and other retail stores that carried Apple products.

Mac OS X 10.1 was codenamed &quot;Puma&quot; because the internal team thought it was &quot;one fast cat.&quot;

==System requirements==
Supported computers:
*Power Mac G3
*Power Mac G4
*Power Mac G4 Cube
*iMac G3
*iMac G4, 
*eMac,
*PowerBook G3, except for the original PowerBook G3
*PowerBook G4
*iBook
RAM:
*128 megabytes (MB) (unofficially 64 MB minimum)
Hard Drive Space:
*1.5 gigabytes (GB)

==Features==
Apple introduced many features that were missing from the previous version, as well as improving overall system performance.

This system release brought some major new features to the Mac OS X platform:
*Performance enhancements — Mac OS X 10.1 introduced large performance increases throughout the system.
*Easier CD and DVD burning — better support in Finder as well as in iTunes
*DVD playback support — DVDs can be played in Apple DVD Player
*More printer support (200 printers supported out of the box) — One of the main complaints of version 10.0 users was the lack of printer drivers, and Apple attempted to remedy the situation by including more drivers, although many critics complained that there were still not enough.
*Faster 3D (OpenGL performs 20% faster) — The OpenGL drivers and handling were vastly improved in this version of Mac OS X, which created a large performance gap for 3D elements in the interface, and 3D applications.
*Improved AppleScript — The scripting interface now allows scripting access to many more system components, such as the Printer Center, and Terminal, thus improving the customizability of the interface. As well, Apple introduced AppleScript Studio, which allows a user to create full AppleScript applications in a simple graphical interface.
*Improved filehandling - The Finder was enhanced to optionally hide file extensions on a per-file basis. The Cocoa API was enhanced to allow developers to set traditional Mac type and creator information directly without relying on Carbon to do it.
*ColorSync 4.0, the color management system and API.
*Image Capture, for acquiring images from digital cameras and scanners.
*Menu Extras, a set of items the user can add to the system menu, replacing the supplied Dock Extras from Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah.

Apple switched to using Mac OS X as the default on all then-new Macs with the 10.1.2 release.

===Applications found on Mac OS X 10.1 Puma===

*Address Book
*AppleScript
*Calculator
*Chess
*Clock
*CPU Monitor
*DVD Player
*Image Capture
*iMovie

<text>Adeline Records was an American record label that was formed in Oakland, California in late 1997 and closed in August 2017.

== History ==
In 1997, Adeline Records was founded by Billie Joe Armstrong, lead singer of Green Day, Screw 32&#x27;s Doug Sangalang, Green Day guitarist Jason White, and professional skateboarder Jim Thiebaud. It was named after a street (Adeline Street) that runs from The Port of Oakland through West Oakland and Emeryville, terminating at Ward St and Shattuck Ave in Berkeley.

Green Day&#x27;s management company, Pat Magnarella Management, took over ownership of the label and ran it from the company&#x27;s office in San Diego for many years.

The label was closed in 2017. In July 2017, Pat Magnarella split from Green Day having managed them for over 21 years. Shortly thereafter Adeline Records abruptly closed down.

=== Merchandise ===
Adeline Records also sold clothing for men and women as well as other clothing, providing advertising for the label. The range was called &quot;Adeline Street&quot; and included clothes (skirts, tops, underwear, dresses, hats, hoodies, jackets), accessories and jewellery for men, women, and children. The Adeline street logo is a skull and crossbones with a heart in the center of the crossed bones in pink for women and khaki for men. The clothing line ceased trading in 2008. The company posted the following statement at the time: &quot;Adeline Street has decided not to move forward with future designs while Billie Joe and the guys are working hard on their follow up to &#x27;American Idiot.&#x27;&quot;

<text>An estate in land is, in the law of England and Wales, an interest in real property that is or may become possessory. It is a type of personal property and encompasses land ownership, rental and other arrangements that give people the right to use land. This is distinct from sovereignty over the land, which includes the right to government and taxation.

This should be distinguished from an &quot;estate&quot; as used in reference to an area of land, and &quot;estate&quot; as used to refer to property in general.

In property law, the rights and interests associated with an estate in land may be conceptually understood as a &quot;bundle of rights&quot; because of the potential for different parties having different interests in the same real property.

== Categories of estates ==
Estates in land can be divided into four basic categories:
# Freehold estates: rights of conveyable exclusive possession and use, having &quot;immobility&quot; and &quot;indeterminate duration&quot;
#* fee simple 
#** fee simple absolute—most rights, least limitations, indefeasible
#* defeasible estate—voidable possession and use
#** fee simple determinable
#** fee simple subject to a condition subsequent
#** fee simple subject to executory limitation
#* finite estate—limited to lifetimes
#** life estate—fragmented possession and use for duration of someone&#x27;s life
#** fee tail—inalienable rights of inheritance for duration of family line
# Leasehold estates: rights of &quot;possession&quot; and &quot;use&quot; but not &quot;ownership&quot;. The lessor (owner/landlord) gives this right to the lessee (tenant). There are four categories of leasehold estates:
## estate for years (a term of year absolute or tenancy for years)—lease of any length with specific begin and end date
## periodic estate (periodic tenancy)—automatically renewing lease (month to month, week to week)
## estate at will (tenancy at will)—leasehold for no fixed time or period. It lasts as long as both parties desire. Termination is bilateral (either party may terminate at any time) or by operation of law. 
## tenancy at sufferance—created when tenant remains after lease expires and becomes a holdover tenant, converts to holdover tenancy upon landlord acceptance.
#*Types of leases:
#** gross lease
#** net lease
#** percentage lease
# Concurrent estates: owned or possessed by two or more individuals simultaneously.
## tenancy by the entirety
## joint tenancy
## tenancy in common
## statutory estates: created by statute:
##* community property
##* homestead — protection from claim by creditors
##* dower—interest a wife has in the property of her husband
##* curtesy—interest a husband has in the property of his wife
# Equitable estates: neither &quot;ownership&quot; nor &quot;possession&quot;
#* Future interests — interests in real or personal property, a gift or trust, or other things in which the privilege of possession or of enjoyment is in the future and not the present
#** reversions
#** possibilities of reverter
#** powers of termination, also known as rights of reentry for condition broken
#** remainders
#** executory interests
#* Incorporeal interests — those that cannot be possessed physically, since they consist of rights of a particular user, or the right to enforce an agreement concerning use
#** easement
#*** easement in gross
#*** easement appurtenant
#**** ingress
#**** egress
#** profits
#** real covenants
#*** covenant appurtenant
#*** covenant in gross
#** equitable servitudes
#** licenses
#* Lien
#** general
#** specific

<doc id="500991" wikidata="Q912481" url="?curid=500991" title="Mac OS X 10.0">
<text>Mac OS X 10.0 (code named Cheetah) is the first major release of macOS, Apple&#x27;s desktop and server operating system. It was released on March 24, 2001, for a price of $129 after a public beta.

Mac OS X was Apple&#x27;s successor to the classic Mac OS. It was derived from NeXTSTEP and FreeBSD, and featured a new user interface called Aqua, as well as improved stability and security due to its new Unix foundations. It introduced the Quartz graphics rendering engine for hardware-accelerated animations. Many technologies were ported from the classic Mac OS, including Sherlock and the QuickTime framework. The core components of Mac OS X were open sourced as Darwin.

Boxed releases of Mac OS X 10.0 also included a copy of Mac OS 9.1, which can be installed alongside Mac OS X 10.0, through the means of dual booting (which meant that reboots are required for switching between the two OSes). This was important for compatibility reasons; while many Mac OS 9 applications could be run under Mac OS X in the Classic environment, some, such as applications that directly accessed hardware, could only run under Mac OS 9.

Six months after its release, Mac OS X 10.0 was succeeded by Mac OS X 10.1, code named Puma.

== Development ==
The development of Mac OS X 10.0 began in 1998, after Apple acquired NeXT Computer, which was founded by Steve Jobs after he was forcibly removed from Apple in the mid-1980s.

The initial development of Mac OS X was led by Avie Tevanian, who had previously worked at NeXT and had played a key role in the development of NeXTSTEP. The development team faced significant challenges in merging the classic Mac OS with the new Unix-based architecture, as well as in creating a modern user interface that would be familiar to Mac users.

Mac OS X 10.0 was released to the public on March 24, 2001, after several months of beta testing. The release was met with mixed reviews, with some users praising the new features and stability, while others criticized the lack of compatibility with older Mac applications.

Some of the key features of Mac OS X 10.0 included the Aqua user interface, which introduced translucent menus, drop shadows, and other visual effects; the Dock, a new way of launching and switching between applications; and a new file system called HFS+. The operating system also included built-in support for networking protocols such as TCP/IP and PPP, as well as for USB and FireWire devices.

==New and updated features==
* The features of the release include the Dock which was a new way of organizing one&#x27;s Mac OS X applications on a user interface, and a change from the classic method of application launching in previous Mac OS systems.
* It included Terminal, a terminal emulator that provides access to Mac OS X&#x27;s Unix command-line interface; the classic Mac OS had previously had the distinction of being one of the few operating systems with no command line interface.
* The new Mail email client included the ability to configure the software to receive all of a user&#x27;s email accounts in one list, the ability to file emails into folders, the ability to search for emails, and the ability to automatically append signatures to outgoing emails. 
* The Address Book was a new application which had features including exporting and importing cards to and from vCard format, API to interface with other applications, change of address notifications, contact groups, auto-merge when importing vCards, customizable fields and categories, the automatic formatting of phone numbers. 
* TextEdit replaced the SimpleText application with new features.
* PDF support was added; it allows the user to create PDFs from any application. 
* The OS introduced the new Aqua UI. 
* Several features of Mac OS 9 were ported to Mac OS X, including the Sherlock desktop and web search engine.

==Removed features==
*File-sharing client — The system can only use TCP/IP, not AppleTalk, to connect to servers sharing the Apple Filing Protocol. It cannot use SMB to connect to Windows or Samba servers.
*File-sharing server — As a server, the system can share files using only the Apple Filing Protocol (over TCP/IP), HTTP, SSH, and FTP.
*Optical media — Neither DVD playback nor burning CDs or DVDs is supported. However, audio CD burning was added in the Mac OS X 10.0.2 update, roughly two months after initial release.

== Architecture ==
Mac OS X is built on Darwin, a Unix-like operating system derived from FreeBSD. Darwin includes a new kernel, XNU, derived from Mach and BSD, as a replacement for the Mac OS nanokernel used in classic Mac OS.

Unlike Mac OS 9, Mac OS X has protected memory and preemptive multitasking. This means that if an application&#x27;s memory becomes corrupted due to a bug, the application will crash without the entire system crashing and needing to be rebooted.

Mac OS X also had support for OpenGL, AppleScript, and the Carbon and Cocoa APIs.

==Language support==
Mac OS X 10.0 began a short era (that ended with Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar&#x27;s release) where Apple offered two types of installation CDs: 1Z and 2Z CDs. The difference in the two lay in the extent of multilingual support.

Input method editors of Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and Korean were only included with the 2Z CDs. They also came with more languages (the full set of 15 languages), whereas the 1Z CDs came only with about eight languages and could not actually display simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese and/or Korean (except for the Chinese characters present in Japanese Kanji). A variant of 2Z CDs were introduced when Mac OS X v10.0.3 was released to the Asian market (this variant could not be upgraded to version 10.0.4). The brief period of multilingual confusion ended with the release of v10.2. Currently, all Mac OS X installer CDs and preinstallations include the full set of 15 languages and full multilingual compatibility.

== Marketing ==
Mac OS X 10.0 was not externally marketed with its codename, a practice which began with Mac OS X Jaguar.

On March 23, 2001, the night before the launch day, Apple hosted a launch party in a Micro Anvika store located at Tottenham Court Road, London. Attendees were provided with live music, along with food and alcoholic beverages. The first 50 Mac OS X 10.0 customers of the participating stores in the UK, including the store hosting the launch party, would receive a free Apple Pro Mouse, while the next 100 customers would be given a commemorative Mac OS X T-shirt. These participating stores also provided demonstrations and offers for Mac products.
Similarly, an Apple Authorized Service Provider (known back then as an Apple Specialist), in Cupertino, California, held a launch party at midnight. The first 100 Mac OS X 10.0 customers would receive a free commemorative Mac OS X T-shirt. On the day, the store was completely packed with customers and fans of Apple products. Steve Wozniak, one of the co-founders of Apple, also attended the launch party.

In the US, multiple Apple authorized resellers also held events on March 24–25, 2001, to coincide with Mac OS X&#x27;s launch.

A store located in Minneapolis reported that over 60% of their available Mac OS X stock was sold on launch day.

On April 3, 2001, Apple launched a bi-weekly email newsletter service named Mac OS X Product News that showcased the latest software for Mac OS X.

== Reception ==

The release of Mac OS X 10.0 saw mixed reviews. ZDNet called the new OS &quot;underdone&quot; due to poor performance, kernel panics, with main applications such as Finder causing system freezes. CNET rated Mac OS X 10.0, a 6 out of 10, calling it &quot;more stable than previous Mac OSs&quot;, along with compliments on its UI, memory management and speed, but isn&#x27;t &quot;ready for the masses&quot;, due to issues such as the lack of native third-party applications for the platform, missing DVD playback and hard to use user interfaces. David Pogue stated in a &quot;New York Times&quot; tech column, that while he felt Mac OS X was better looking and easier to use than Mac OS 9 with superior features and menus, it is not yet ready for the average user, as it&#x27;s not as polished, with missing features such as CD burning (at launch), automated shutdown scheduling, Labels menu.

<text>The National Railroad Museum is a railroad museum located in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin, US.

Founded in 1956 by community volunteers, the National Railroad Museum is one of the oldest and largest U.S. institutions dedicated to preserving and interpreting the nation&#x27;s railroad history. Two years later, a joint resolution of Congress recognized the Museum as the National Railroad Museum. The museum has been a Nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization since 1958.

Its collection of locomotives and rolling stock spans more than a century of railroading. Notable items include an &quot;Aerotrain;&quot; Union Pacific Big Boy No. 4017, one of the world&#x27;s largest steam locomotives; and British Railways Class A4 No. 60008 &quot;Dwight D Eisenhower&quot; (ex-London &amp; North Eastern Railway No. 4496 &quot;Golden Shuttle&quot;) and train used by the Supreme Allied Commander and his staff in the United Kingdom and continental Europe during World War II.

A museum building houses a wide variety of railroad artifacts, an archive, and photography gallery. A standard gauge track rings the grounds. An wooden observation tower has views of the Fox River and Green Bay.

The museum hosted an annual &quot;Day Out with Thomas&quot; event until 2019, where Thomas the Tank Engine pulls young friends past the exhibited rolling stock; and in October, &quot;Terror on the Fox&quot;: Green Bay Preble Optimist Club&#x27;s haunted attraction that includes &quot;haunted&quot; train rides after dark. The Frederick J. Lenfesty Center, an enclosed and climate-controlled structure, built in 2001, houses several of the unique and rarer locomotives and cars.


==Expansion==
A $15 million expansion project plan has been released that includes plaza along the Fox River and an additional display building. The state of Wisconsin, through the use of American Rescue Plan Act funds is contributing $7 million to this project.

==Other collections==
The museum&#x27;s archives hold corporate records and documents, annual reports, maps, mechanical and engineering drawings, oral histories, and ephemera. The holdings represent various railroad companies, labor unions, and fraternal organizations.

Its library holds works on the social, economic, political, and cultural aspects of U.S. railroading history.

The National Railroad Museum holds over 5,000 artifacts, including textiles, uniforms, tools and personal items.

Its photograph collection includes 15,000 photographic prints, slides, and film negatives of U.S. railroading since 1890.

==Capital campaign==
As of 2019, the museum was working to raise money to build a roundhouse to surround its current buildings (except the train station) to shelter from the weather the locomotives and cars displayed in the open pavilion.

<doc id="500995" wikidata="Q131540285" url="?curid=500995" title="Invagination">
<text>Invagination is the process of a surface folding in on itself to form a cavity, pouch or tube. In developmental biology, invagination of epithelial sheets occurs in many contexts during embryonic development. Invagination is critical for making the primitive gut during gastrulation in many organisms, forming the neural tube in vertebrates, and in the morphogenesis of countless organs and sensory structures. Models of invagination that have been most thoroughly studied include the ventral furrow in &quot;Drosophila&quot; &quot;melanogaster&quot;, neural tube formation, and gastrulation in many marine organisms. The cellular mechanisms of invagination vary from one context to another but at their core they involve changing the mechanics of one side of a sheet of cells such that this pressure induces a bend in the tissue. 

The term, originally used in embryology, has been adopted in other disciplines as well. 

== History ==
The process of tissue invagination has fascinated scientists for over a century and a half. Since the beginning, scientists have tried to understand the process of invagination as a mechanical process resulting from forces acting in the embryo. For example, the Swiss biologist Wilhelm His, observing the invagination of the chick neural tube, experimented with modeling this process using sheets of different materials and suggested that pushing forces from the lateral edges of the neural plate might drive its invagination. Scientists throughout the next century have speculated on the mechanisms of invagination, often making models of this process using either physical analogs, or, especially in recent years, mathematical and computational modeling.

== Cellular mechanisms ==
Invagination can be driven by a number of mechanisms at the cellular level. Regardless of the force-generating mechanism that causes the bending of the epithelium, most instances of invagination result in a stereotypical cell shape change. At the side of the epithelium exposed to the environment (the apical side), the surface of cells shrinks, and at the side of the cell in contact with the basement membrane (the basal side), the cell surfaces expand. Thus, cells become wedge-shaped. As these cells change shape, the tissue bends in the direction of the apical surface. In many–– though not all––cases, this process involves active constriction of the apical surface by the actin-myosin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, while most invagination processes involve shrinking of the apical surface, there have been cases observed where the opposite happens - the basal surface constricts and the apical surface expands, such as in optic cup morphogenesis and formation of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary in zebrafish.

=== Apical constriction ===
Apical constriction is an active process that results in the shrinkage of the apical side of the cell. This causes the cell shape to change from a column or cube-shaped cell to become wedge-shaped. Apical constriction is powered by the activity of the proteins actin and myosin interacting in a complex network known as the actin-myosin cytoskeleton. Myosin, a motor protein, generates force by pulling filaments of actin together. Myosin activity is regulated by the phosphorylation of one of its subunits, myosin regulatory light chain. Thus, kinases such as Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK), which phosphorylate myosin, as well as phosphatases, which dephosphorylate myosin, are regulators of actomyosin contraction in cells.

The arrangement of actin and myosin in the cell cortex and the way they generate force can vary across contexts. Classical models of apical constriction in embryos and epithelia in cell culture showed that actin-myosin bundles are assembled around the circumference of the cell in association with adherens junctions between cells. Contraction of the actin-myosin bundles thus results in a constriction of the apical surface in a process that has been likened to the tightening of a purse string. More recently, in the context of a cultured epithelium derived from the mouse organ of Corti, it has also been shown that the arrangement of the actin and myosin around the cell circumerence is similar to a muscle sarcomere, where there are a repeating units of myosin connected to antiparallel actin bundles. In other cells, a network of myosin and actin in the middle of the apical surface can also generate apical constriction. For example, in cells of the &quot;Drosophila&quot; ventral furrow, the organization of actin and myosin is analogous to a muscle sarcomere arranged radially. In some contexts, a less clearly organized “cortical flow” of actin and myosin can also generate contraction of the apical surface.

=== Basal relaxation ===
To maintain a constant cell volume during apical constriction, cells must either change their height or expand the basal surface of their cells. While the process of basal relaxation has been less thoroughly studied, in some cases it has been directly observed that the process of apical constriction occurs alongside an active disassembly of the actin-myosin network at the basal surface of the cell, allowing the basal side of the cell to expand. For example, this has been observed in the &quot;Drosophila&quot; ventral furrow invagination and the formation of the otic placode in the chicken.

=== Changes in cell height ===
Invagination also often involves, and can be driven by, changes in cell height. When apical constriction occurs, this can lead to elongation of cells to maintain constant cell volume, and consequently a thickening of the epithelium. However, shortening of cells along the apical-basal axis can also help deepen the pit formed during invagination. Active changes in cell shape to cause cell shortening have been shown to contribute to invagination in a few cases. For example, in the &quot;Drosophila&quot; leg epithelium, apoptotic cells shrink and pull on the apical surface of the epithelium via an apical-basal cable made up of actin and myosin. In the invagination that occurs in ascidian gastrulation, cells first undergo apical constriction and then change their shape to become rounder ––and thus shorter along the apical-basal axis––which is responsible for the completion of the invagination movement. During cell division, cells also naturally take on a rounded morphology. The rapid drop in cell height caused by rounding of cells during mitosis has also been implicated in invagination of the &quot;Drosophila&quot; tracheal placode.

=== Supracellular cables ===
Supracellular actomyosin cables are structures of actin and myosin that align between cells next to each other and are connected by cell junctions. These cables play many roles in morphogenesis during embryonic development, including invagination. Rather than solely relying on apical constriction of individual cells, invagination can be driven by compressive forces from this cable contracting around the site of invagination, such as in the case of salivary gland invagination in &quot;Drosophila&quot;. In neural tube formation in the chick embryo, rows of supracellular cables stretching across the site of invagination help pull the tissue together to facilitate bending into a tube.

== Notable examples ==

=== &quot;Drosophila&quot; ventral furrow ===

One of the most well studied models of invagination is the ventral furrow in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;. The formation of this structure is one of the first major cell movements in &quot;Drosophila&quot; gastrulation. In this process, the prospective mesoderm––the region of cells along the ventral midline of the embryo––folds inwards to form the ventral furrow. This furrow eventually pinches off and becomes a tube inside the embryo and ultimately flattens to form a layer of tissue underneath the ventral surface.

Ventral furrow formation is driven by apical constriction of the future mesoderm cells, which first flatten along the apical surface and then contract their apical membranes. The classical models for how apical constriction worked in this context were based on the “purse-string” mechanism where an actin-myosin band around the circumference of the apical cell surface contracts. However, more recent investigations have revealed that, while there is a circumferential band of actin associated with cell junctions on the side of cells, it is actually an actin-myosin network arranged radially across the apical surface that powers apical constriction. This structure acts like a radial version of a muscle sarcomere. Force generated by myosin results in contraction towards the center of the cell. The cells do not contract continuously but rather have pulsed contractions. In between contractions, the actin network around the circumference of the cell helps stabilize the reduced size of the cell, allowing for a progressive decrease in size of the apical surface. In addition to apical constriction, adhesion between cells through adherens junctions is critical for transforming these individual cell-level contractions into a deformation of a whole tissue.

Genetically, formation of the ventral furrow relies on the activity of the transcription factors &quot;twist&quot; and &quot;snail&quot;, which are expressed in the prospective ventral mesoderm before furrow formation. Downstream of &quot;twist&quot; is the Fog signaling pathway, which controls the changes that occur in the apical domain of cells.

=== Neural tube formation ===
Scientists have studied the process of neural tube formation in vertebrate embryos since the late 1800s. Across vertebrate groups including amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, the neural tube (the embryonic precursor of the spinal cord) forms through the invagination of the neural plate into a tube, known as primary neurulation. In fish (and in some contexts in other vertebrates), the neural tube can also be formed by a non-invagination-mediated process known as secondary neurulation. While some differences exist in the mechanism of primary neurulation between vertebrate species, the general process is similar. Neurulation involves the formation of a medial hinge point at the middle of the neural plate, which is where tissue bending is initiated. The cells at the medial hinge point become wedge shaped. In some contexts, such as in &quot;Xenopus&quot; frog embryos, this cell shape change appears to be due to apical constriction. However, in chickens and mice, bending at this hinge point is mediated by a process called basal wedging, rather than apical constriction. In this case, the cells are so thin that the movement of the nucleus to the basal side of the cell causes a bulge in the basal part of the cell. This process may be regulated by how the cell divisions take place. Contractions of actin-myosin cables are also important for the invagination of the neural plate. Supracellular actin cables stretching across the neural plate help pull the tissue together (see ). Furthermore, forces pushing into the neural plate from the adjacent tissue also may play a role in the folding of the neural plate.

=== Sea urchin gastrulation ===

Sea urchin gastrulation is another classic model for invagination in embryology. One of the early gastrulation movements in sea urchins is the invagination of a region of cells at the vegetal side of the embryo (vegetal plate) to become the archenteron, or future gut tube. There are multiple stages of archenteron invagination: a first stage where the initial folding in of tissue occurs, a second stage where the archenteron elongates, and in some species a third stage where the archenteron contacts the other side of the cell cavity and finishes its elongation.

Apical constriction occurs in archenteron invagination, with a ring of cells called “bottle cells” in the center of the vegetal plate becoming wedge-shaped. However, invagination does not seem to be solely driven by the apical constriction of bottle cells, as inhibiting actin polymerization or removing bottle cells does not fully block invagination. Several other mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in the process, including a role for extraembryonic extracellular matrix. In this model, there are two layers of extracellular matrix at the apical surface of cells made of different proteins. When cells from the vegetal plate secrete a molecule (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan) that is highly water absorbent into the inner layer, this causes the layer to swell, making the tissue buckle inwards. Several genetic pathways have been implicated in this process. Wnt signaling through the non-canonical planar cell polarity pathway has been shown to be important, with one of its downstream targets being the small GTPase RhoA. FGF signaling also plays a role in invagination.

===&quot;Amphioxus&quot; gastrulation===

The invagination in &quot;amphioxus&quot; is the first cell movement of gastrulation. This process was first described by Conklin. During gastrulation, the blastula will be transformed by the invagination. The endoderm folds towards the inner part and thus the blastocoel transforms into a cup-shaped structure with a double wall. The inner wall is now called the archenteron; the primitive gut. The archenteron will open to the exterior through the blastopore. The outer wall will become the ectoderm, later forming the epidermis and nervous system.

===Tunicate gastrulation===
In tunicates, invagination is the first mechanism that takes place during gastrulation. The four largest endoderm cells induce the invagination process in the tunicates. Invagination consists of the internal movements of a sheet of cells (the endoderm) based on changes in their shape. The blastula of the tunicates is a little flattened in the vegetal pole making a change of shape from a columnar to a wedge shape. Once the endoderm cells were invaginated, the cells will keep moving beneath the ectoderm. Later, the blastopore will be formed and with this, the invagination process is complete. The blastopore will be surrounded by the mesoderm by all sides.

== Other forms of invagination ==

=== Biology ===
* The inner membrane of a mitochondrion invaginates to form cristae, thus providing a much greater surface area to accommodate the protein complexes and other participants that produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). 
* Invagination occurs during endocytosis and exocytosis when a vesicle forms within the cell and the membrane closes around it.
* Invagination of a part of the intestine into another part is called intussusception.

=== Geology ===
In geology, invagination is used to describe a deep depression of strata. Used by Donald L. Baars in &quot;The Colorado Plateau&quot;.

<doc id="500998" wikidata="Q1755543" url="?curid=500998" title="Little Albert experiment">
<text>The Little Albert experiment was an unethical study that mid-20th century psychologists interpret as evidence of classical conditioning in humans. The study is also claimed to be an example of stimulus generalization although reading the research report demonstrates that fear did not generalize by color or tactile qualities. It was carried out by John B. Watson and his graduate student, Rosalie Rayner, at Johns Hopkins University. The results were first published in the February 1920 issue of the &quot;Journal of Experimental Psychology&quot;.

After observing children in the field, Watson hypothesized that the fearful response of children to loud noises is an innate unconditioned response. He wanted to test the notion that by following the principles of the procedure now known as &quot;classical conditioning&quot;, he could use this unconditioned response to condition a child to fear a distinctive stimulus that normally would not be feared by a child (in this case, furry objects). However, he admitted in his research article that the fear he generated was neither strong nor lasting.

==Method==
The aim of Watson and Rayner was to condition a phobia in an emotionally stable child. For this study, they chose a nine-month-old infant from a hospital. The child was referred to as &quot;Albert&quot; for the experiment. Watson followed the procedures which Ivan Pavlov had used in his experiments with dogs.

Before the experiment, Albert was given a battery of baseline emotional tests: the infant was exposed, briefly and for the first time, to a white rat, a rabbit, a dog, a monkey, masks (with and without hair), cotton, wool, burning newspapers, and other stimuli. Albert showed no fear of any of these items during the baseline tests.

For the experiment proper, by which point Albert was 11 months old, he was put on a mattress on a table in the middle of a room. A white laboratory rat was placed near Albert and he was allowed to play with it. At this point, Watson and Rayner made a loud sound behind Albert&#x27;s back by striking a suspended steel bar with a hammer each time the baby touched the rat. Albert responded to the noise by crying and showing fear. After several such pairings of the two stimuli, Albert was presented with only the rat. Upon seeing the rat, Albert became very distressed, crying and crawling away. Apparently, the infant associated the white rat with the noise. The rat, originally a neutral stimulus, had become a conditioned stimulus and was eliciting an emotional (conditional) response similar to the distress (unconditioned response) originally given to the noise (unconditioned stimulus).

In further experiments, Little Albert seemed to generalize his response to the white rat. He became distressed at the sight of several other furry objects, such as a rabbit, a furry dog, a seal-skin coat, and even a Santa Claus mask with white cotton balls in the beard. However, this stimulus generalization did not extend to everything with hair.

Watson&#x27;s experiment had many failings by modern standards. For example, it had only a single subject and no control subjects. Furthermore, such an experiment could be hard to conduct in compliance with current laws and regulations, given the expected risks to the subject.

==Subsequent events==

Albert was about one year old at the end of the experiment, and he reportedly left the hospital shortly thereafter. Though Watson had discussed what might be done to remove Albert&#x27;s conditioned fears, he chose not to attempt such desensitization with Albert, and it is thought likely that the infant&#x27;s fear of furry things continued postexperimentally.

Watson later gave a series of weekend lectures describing the Little Albert study. One of these lectures was attended by Mary Cover Jones, which sparked her interest in pursuing graduate work in psychology. Jones conducted an experiment to figure out how to eliminate fear responses in children and studied a boy named Peter, who was two years old. Peter shared similar fears of white rabbits and furry objects as Little Albert. Jones was able to increase Peter&#x27;s tolerance of white rabbits by exposing him to the animal at gradually shorter distances and having Peter interact with children who were not afraid of the rabbit. Watson is listed in the publication of the study as advisor and editor. Mary Cover Jones was the first psychologist to desensitize, or decondition, a fear response and become known as the &quot;Mother of Behavior Therapy&quot;.

==Identifying Little Albert==
According to some textbooks, Albert&#x27;s mother worked in the same building as Watson and did not know the tests were being conducted. When she found out, she took Albert and moved away, letting no one know where they were going. A 2009 report, however, disputes that. The original report had stated that the baby&#x27;s mother was a wet nurse at the hospital, who may have felt coerced and unable to turn down a request for her baby to be used in Watson&#x27;s experiment. The claim of coercion was challenged in an article published in the same journal as the coercion claim.

===Douglas Merritte===
In 2009, psychologists Hall P. Beck and Sharman Levinson published an article in which they claimed to have discovered the true identity of &quot;Albert B.&quot; After reviewing Watson&#x27;s correspondence and publications, as well as research in public documents (such as the 1920 United States Census and state birth and death records), Beck argued that &quot;Albert B.&quot; was a pseudonym for Douglas Merritte, the son of Arvilla Merritte, then a woman who appears to have been a wet nurse at the Harriet Lane Home.

It was later found that Douglas Merritte had hydrocephalus, from which he died at the age of 6. With this condition, which is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid on the brain, Merritte may have had severe trouble seeing at the time of the experiment, and this disputes the claim that the child in question was average and healthy. According to researchers who looked at this case years later, if Douglas Merritte was, indeed, Little Albert, his actions during the conditioning sessions align with signs of neurological impairment. This includes Little Albert&#x27;s use of hand-scooping, rather than grasping gestures typical of this age, as well as poor eye-scanning abilities and his lack of facial expressions. Other research has argued, however, that Douglas Merritte may not have been &quot;Little Albert&quot;, who may, in fact, have been young Albert Barger (known later as William Albert Martin).

===Albert Barger===
The identity claimed by Beck, et al., has been contested by psychology researchers Russ Powell, Nancy Digdon and Ben Harris, who offer an alternative identity based on available data. Albert Barger had been born within a day of Merritte, and his mother had also worked at the hospital where the experiment was conducted. In addition, his body weight and developmental condition closely matched the experiment&#x27;s documentation of the subject baby&#x27;s condition. Moreover, according to Watson and Rayner (1920), Little Albert was 12 months and 21 days the last day of the experiment when &quot;he was taken from the hospital&quot; (p. 12), the exact age Albert Barger had been when he left the hospital. Finally, when Powell et al. were allowed to independently verify Douglas Merritte&#x27;s clinical file, it was revealed that he was &quot;completely blind&quot;, which is at odds with the experiment&#x27;s films where Little Albert engages in probable instances of object-directed action and social referencing. 

Through the use of a professional genealogist, the researchers learned Barger had died in 2007 at age 87 and identified one close living relative, a niece. In an interview, Barger&#x27;s niece stated that she and her uncle had been quite close throughout his life, and acknowledged Barger&#x27;s antipathy toward dogs as a well-known fact that family members, particularly his wife, would tease him about (the researchers noted there was no way to determine whether or not this behavior was linked to Watson&#x27;s experiment). She also informed researchers of her uncle&#x27;s aversion to animals in general, not just dogs. Though it was not a particularly strong aversion, family members would often have to keep their dogs in a separate room when he visited. Outside of this, Barger&#x27;s niece stated that she did not recall any other phobias he may have had. The researchers concluded that Barger would have been unaware of his role as an infant test subject.

==Ethical considerations==
The experiment today would be considered unethical according to the American Psychological Association&#x27;s ethic code, and legislation has been passed to prevent such potentially harmful experiments. In the early 1970s, following widely publicized cases of research abuse, the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research (NCPHS) was created to study issues surrounding the protection of humans in research. In 1979, the Commission issued a report entitled &quot;Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research&quot; (commonly called the &quot;Belmont Report&quot;), which provided the ethical framework on which current federal regulations for the protection of human participants in research are based. Under the NCPHS standards set in the late 1970s, an experiment such as Watson&#x27;s would not have been allowed. Research with participants is also regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Public Health Service Act. In addition, training of researchers in the use of human participants has been required by the National Institutes of Health since 2000.

==Criticisms==
A detailed review of the original study and its subsequent interpretations by Ben Harris (1979) stated:
It is difficult to be certain exactly what happened during the Little Albert experiment since concrete evidence and scientific records are lacking. Though a film was shot during the experiment, textbooks interpret the movie differently. Various sources give contradicting accounts of events that took place, and they raise questions about exactly what stimuli were used, which stimuli the baby came to fear, and what happened to the child after the experiment. It was said that most textbooks &quot;suffer from inaccuracies of various degrees&quot; while referring to Watson and Rayner&#x27;s study. Texts often misrepresent, exaggerate, or minimize the range of Albert&#x27;s post-conditioning fears.

Other criticisms stem from the health of the child (cited as Douglas Merritte) who was not a &quot;healthy&quot;, &quot;normal&quot; infant as claimed in the study, but one who was very ill and had exhibited symptoms of hydrocephalus since birth—according to relatives he never learned to walk or talk later in life. The child would die five years after the experiment due to complications from the congenital disease. It is stated that the study&#x27;s authors were aware of the child&#x27;s severe cognitive deficit, abnormal behavior, and unusually frequent crying, but continued to terrify the sick infant and generalize their findings to healthy infants, an act criticized as academic fraud. These accusations were successfully challenged in the same journals that published the initial claims. The articles refuting the &quot;sick baby&quot; claim explain that the child was actually William (called Albert by his family) Barger, and that the child was, in fact, healthy.

<text>Parker-Hannifin Corporation, originally Parker Appliance Company, usually referred to as just Parker, is an American corporation specializing in motion and control technologies. Its corporate headquarters are in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, in Greater Cleveland (with a Cleveland mailing address).

The company was founded in 1917 and has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since December 9, 1964. The firm is one of the largest companies in the world in motion control technologies, including aerospace, climate control, electromechanical, filtration, fluid and gas handling, hydraulics, pneumatics, process control, and sealing and shielding. Parker employs about 61,000 people globally.

In 2024, the company was ranked 216 in the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500.

==History==
===1917–1950===
Arthur L. Parker founded the firm as the Parker Appliance Company in Ohio around 1917 or 1918. In its early years, it built pneumatic brake systems for buses, trucks and trains. In 1919, Parker&#x27;s truck slid over a cliff, causing the company to lose its entire inventory and forcing the founder to return to his previous job. Nonetheless, he restarted Parker Appliance Company in 1924.

By 1927, the firm had expanded into airplanes. For his flight across the Atlantic Ocean, Charles Lindbergh requested Parker parts be used in the construction of his aircraft the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;. The firm contributed the system that linked the aircraft&#x27;s 16 fuel tanks.

During World War II, Parker experienced a boom in business as the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s primary supplier of valves and fluid connectors. By 1943, the firm employed 5,000 Cleveland, Ohio, residents. After Arthur Parker&#x27;s death in 1945 and the end of the war, the company neared bankruptcy due to the sudden drop in demand. Arthur Parker&#x27;s wife, Helen Parker, assumed control of the company and prevented its liquidation. She hired new management staff and directed the company&#x27;s focus back to civilian manufacturing.

===1950s–1960s===
In the early 1950s, the firm&#x27;s executives set a goal to make Parker, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; put it, &quot;the General Electric of fluid power&quot;, a goal it generally achieved in the coming decades. In 1957, the company purchased Hannifin, a producer of valve and cylinder products, and changed its name to Parker Hannifin. Many more acquisitions followed, with the company reaching 40 acquisitions by the year 1979.

In 1953, Arthur Parker&#x27;s son Patrick S. Parker began working full-time at the company. He rose to become its president in 1968, and served as CEO from 1971 to 1983 and as chairman from 1977 to 1999. During and after his tenure, the firm grew dramatically, with revenues rising from $197 million in 1968 to over $7 billion in 2005.

The company debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in 1964, under the ticker symbol PH. In 1966, the company joined the Fortune 500. The company designed parts for the craft used in NASA&#x27;s first crewed Moon landing in 1969.

===1970s–1990s===
An economic downturn in 1970 forced the company to expand beyond its focus on hydraulic systems. In the following years it began to expand into the automotive aftermarket, considered a more stable industry. The company also directed itself toward growth in aerospace, acquiring companies that created flight controls and wheel brake equipment for airplanes. By 1979, Parker Hannifin employed 20,000 people in 100 plants, selling 90,000 items for machinery, airplanes, cars and construction equipment to 60,000 customers. The company made some of the equipment inside the mechanical shark in the 1975 movie &quot;Jaws&quot;.

In 1982, Paul G. Schloemer replaced Patrick Parker as the company&#x27;s president (although Patrick Parker remained chairman and CEO). That same year, the firm entered the Mexican market. By 2008, Parker Hannifin Mexico would come to operate 11 plants in the country, seven of which made parts exclusively for the U.S. market. In 1988, the company reached $2 billion in sales.

The firm opened its first retail &quot;ParkerStore&quot; in Cleveland in 1993. Within 10 years, the network of stores expanded to 200 locations in the U.S. and more than 400 worldwide. ParkerStores offer a variety of Parker products, including hydraulics, automation, and hose and fitting components, at locations close to industrial product buyers. Parker Hannifin systems helped control the massive replica of the &quot;Titanic&quot; in the 1997 film of the same name. In 1997, the firm moved its headquarters from Cleveland to a new building in Mayfield Heights, a suburb of Cleveland. In 1999, the company&#x27;s sales reached approximately $5 billion.

===2000s–present===
Parker Hannifin acquired Commercial Intertech Corporation, a maker of hydraulic systems, in 2000.Commercial Intertech had previously acquired Oildyne Inc., a well known hydraulic manufacturer. Parker has an Oildyne division today. With a cost of $366 million, this was at the time Parker Hannifin&#x27;s biggest acquisition.

In 2001, CEO Don Washkewicz introduced lean startup methods to company operations and has said that over the decade this reduced the time to obtain price quotes by 60% and cut product development lead times by 25%.

In 2002 the company appointed Craig Maxwell as head of engineering; Maxwell brought a focus on innovation as well as rigor; he argued for and was given a $20M annual budget to fund blue sky inventions made by engineers and has given engineers time to pursue them; at the same time his team developed software that allows tracking each of the company&#x27;s 1700 ongoing R&amp;D projects graded by risk and potential reward, and closely managing their progress. In 2011 he hired Ryan Farris out of Vanderbilt University and licensed patents covering a powered exoskeleton that Farris had worked on at Vanderbilt. In 2015 the company opened an internal business incubator that Maxwell had proposed when he was first hired.

The company won $2 billion in contracts to build fuel and hydraulic systems for Airbus A350 airliners in 2008 Two years later, its products were used in repairing the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil rig.

Thomas Williams took over the CEO role from Washkewicz in 2015. In 2016, the company completed its largest acquisition to date, buying Clarcor, a filtration systems manufacturer, for $4.3 billion. In 2019, Parker bought Lord Corporation for $3.7 billion and Kent, WA based Exotic Metals Forming Company for $1.7 billion.

In August 2021, the company agreed to buy British aerospace and defense company Meggitt for £6.3 billion. In July 2022, after making commitments to the UK government including increasing research and development spending in Britain, the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy approved the takeover without being referred for a full Competition and Markets Authority investigation. The acquisition completed in September 2022.

In May 2022, it was announced Parker Hannifin has sold its aircraft wheel and brake division to the Bloomfield-headquartered aerospace company, Kaman Corporation for US$440 million.

==Aerospace==
Parker Hannifin&#x27;s aerospace group designs and manufactures aerospace hydraulic equipment, flight controls, fuel system components, high-temperature bleed air valves, and other components. Headquartered in Irvine, California, Parker Aerospace operates facilities around the world. The company has had contracts to contribute parts and maintenance for machinery produced by Airbus, Rolls-Royce, Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China as well as other manufacturers.

In 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration contracted Parker Aerospace to develop a new monitoring device, the Multi-Sensor Enroute Flight Inspection System, for flight inspection aircraft.

Notable acquisitions by the division include the Kalamazoo, Michigan-based Abex/NWL division of Pneumo Abex in 1996, and Naples, Florida-based Shaw Aero Devices, in 2007. In 2012, the company partnered with General Electric to form a 50–50 joint venture, Advanced Atomization Technologies, for producing fuel nozzles for commercial aircraft engines.

===Boeing 737 accidents and incidents===

In 1995, it was discovered that failures in a servo unit supplied by Parker Hannifin to Boeing for use in their 737 aircraft may have contributed to several accidents and incidents, including the crashes of United Airlines Flight 585 and USAir Flight 427.

In 2004, a Los Angeles jury ordered Parker Hannifin to pay US$43 million to the plaintiff families of the 1997 SilkAir Flight 185 crash in Indonesia. Parker Hannifin subsequently appealed the verdict, which resulted in an out-of-court settlement for an undisclosed amount. The Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) could not determine the cause of the crash due to the near total lack of physical evidence because of the complete destruction; The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), however disagreed, and concluded that the crash was caused, possibly intentionally, by the pilot.

The FAA ordered an upgrade of all Boeing 737 rudder control systems by November 12, 2002. The firm argued that the components they supplied were not at fault, citing that the product has one of the safest records in its class, but the FAA directive went through regardless. In 2016, former NTSB investigator John Cox stated that time has proven the NTSB correct in its findings that the valve was faulty, because no additional rudder-reversal incidents have occurred since Boeing&#x27;s redesign.

===F-35 fueldraulic line failure===
On January 18, 2013, the F-35B variant of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II was grounded after the failure of a fueldraulic line in the aircraft&#x27;s propulsion system that controls the exhaust vectoring system. This followed an incident two days earlier on January 16, in which the propulsion system experienced a fueldraulic failure prior to a conventional takeoff. The failure was found to be a manufacturing defect by Parker Hannifin&#x27;s Stratoflex division.

<doc id="501007" wikidata="Q780739" url="?curid=501007" title="Jeff Grubb">
<text>Jeff Grubb (born August 27, 1957) is an author of novels, short stories, and comics, as well as a computer and role-playing game designer in the fantasy genre. Grubb worked on the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; campaign setting under Tracy Hickman, and the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; setting with Ed Greenwood. His written works include &quot;The Finder&#x27;s Stone Trilogy&quot;, the &quot;Spelljammer&quot; and &quot;Jakandor&quot; campaign settings, and contributions to &quot;Dragonlance&quot; and the computer game &quot;Guild Wars Nightfall&quot; (2006).

==Personal life==
Grubb was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He met Kate Novak in high school and married her in 1983. His first year of employment involved work with air pollution control devices.

==Beginnings in role-playing games==
Grubb became a wargaming enthusiast during his high school years. He started to play Avalon Hill wargames including &quot;PanzerBlitz&quot; and &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;, and the SPI game, &quot;Frigate&quot;. 
As a freshman, he attended the campus war-gaming club and was introduced to the role-playing game, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Grubb said,
:&quot;I walked up to a group of players to ask what they were doing. One turned to me, handed me three six-siders, and said, &#x27;Roll these. We need a cleric.&#x27; It was all downhill from there.&quot;
Within the year, Grubb attended Gen Con, a table-top gaming convention, for the first time. He also ran his own campaign set in Toril, his own game universe.

==Career==

===TSR===
Grubb&#x27;s overseeing of the design of the &quot;AD&amp;D Open&quot; at Gen Con in 1982, led to his employment as a game designer at TSR. He was a design consultant on Gary Gygax&#x27;s 1983 work, &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; for the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game. Tracy Hickman got Harold Johnson, then Grubb, Carl Smith and Larry Elmore in on the idea of Dragonlance before Margaret Weis and Douglas Niles joined them. In 1984, Grubb was the principal architect of the &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot; game system.

Grubb was a consultant on the first edition of &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot;, and authored the first edition of the &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot;. Grubb contacted Ed Greenwood, author of numerous articles in &quot;Dragon&quot; about his home campaign setting, and soon Greenwood began sending Grubb packages full of maps of his world and background information for the setting; this collaboration resulted in the publication of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting beginning with the &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting&quot; (1987). He is the designer of the &quot;Spelljammer&quot; campaign setting, and the Al-Qadim setting. Grubb felt that Al-Qadim was well received because the designers were able to hide the potential of the setting from the executives at TSR.

In the late 1980s, Grubb wrote four fill-in issues of the DC Comics licensed &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; comic book, and wrote 25 issues of DC Comic&#x27;s &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; series. Grubb started the &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; line for TSR with a board game published in 1988. Grubb continued to work on role-playing games with TSR for many years, long enough to be regarded affectionately as an &quot;old timer&quot; by Scott Haring. In 1994, he left TSR to pursue freelance work. Grubb wrote three supplements for the &quot;Jakandor&quot; setting, published in 1997–1998 as the final publications in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; series.

===Freelance work===
When Wizards of the Coast purchased TSR inc., Grubb was engaged to work on games, settings, and source books such as &quot;Tempest Feud&quot; for the &quot;Star Wars Roleplaying Game&quot;, &quot;d20 Modern&quot; and &quot;Urban Arcana&quot;. He wrote &quot;The Memoirs of Auberon of Faerie&quot; for R. Talsorian Games and was one of the authors of the D20 &quot;Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game&quot; for Sword &amp; Sorcery Studios. He has also been involved with Sovereign Press, founded by Margaret Weis and Don Perrin in 2001. He designed the &quot;HeroClix&quot; Unleashed set.

==Comics, novels, and short stories==
In 1988, &quot;Azure Bonds&quot;, Grubb&#x27;s first novel, which was coauthored with his wife, Kate Novak, was published as part of &quot;The Finder&#x27;s Stone Trilogy&quot;. The second and third books in the trilogy, &quot;The Wyvern&#x27;s Spur&quot; and &quot;Song of the Saurials&quot;, were published by TSR inc. in 1990 and 1991. Grubb and Novak continued to write novels in the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; setting, releasing &quot;Masquerades&quot;, &quot;Finder&#x27;s Bane&quot;, and &quot;Tymora&#x27;s Luck&quot;. Other settings such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Warcraft&quot; and &quot;StarCraft&quot; have also featured in his novels. Grubb also wrote the 45th issue of &quot;Superman Adventures&quot;, &quot;Mateless in Metropolis&quot; (cover date July 2000).

Grubb&#x27;s short stories are set in a variety of fictional worlds, including &quot;Dragonlance&quot;, &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;, &quot;Ravenloft&quot; and &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot;. In general, his short fiction has been well received, with his story &quot;Malediction&quot; being described as amongst the best of those included in &quot;Thieves&#x27; World: Enemies of Fortune&quot;, while &quot;Beowulf in the City of the Dark Elves&quot; has been regarded as the best of the original fiction in &quot;The Further Adventures of Beowulf: Champion of Middle Earth&quot;.

Among his favorite novels that he authored are &quot;Azure Bonds&quot;, &quot;Lord Toede&quot;, and &quot;The Brothers&#x27; War&quot;, and his favorite short stories include &quot;The Judgement of abd-al-Mammat&quot; and &quot;Lycanthrope Summer.&quot;

Grubb is the author of over a dozen novels and 30 short stories.

==Computer games==
The novel &quot;Azure Bonds&quot; was developed into a computer game, &quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot;, in 1989, and was published by Strategic Simulations. ArenaNet hired Grubb to write the story for the third installment of their &quot;Guild Wars&quot; franchise, &quot;Guild Wars Nightfall&quot;. Although credited as a designer under lead designer James Phinney, in an interview with GameSpy he describes his role as more of an &#x27;embedded writer&#x27; than a designer. Grubb was involved in designing the &quot;Guild Wars: Eye of the North&quot; expansion pack. Primarily responsible for writing the storyline, he describes himself as an &#x27;embedded writer&#x27; rather than as a game designer. He has also done world-building and writing for Blue Byte. He is working as a writer and game designer for Guild Wars 2.

<text>In biochemistry, an oxidase is an oxidoreductase (any enzyme that catalyzes a redox reaction) that uses dioxygen (O2) as the electron acceptor. In reactions involving donation of a hydrogen atom, oxygen is reduced to water (H2O) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Some oxidation reactions, such as those involving monoamine oxidase or xanthine oxidase, typically do not involve free molecular oxygen.

The oxidases are a subclass of the oxidoreductases. The use of dioxygen is the only unifying feature; in the EC classification, these enzymes are scattered in many categories.

==Examples==
An important example is EC 7.1.1.9 cytochrome c oxidase, the key enzyme that allows the body to employ oxygen in the generation of energy and the final component of the electron transfer chain. Other examples are:
* EC 1.1.3.4 Glucose oxidase
* EC 1.4.3.4 Monoamine oxidase
* EC 1.14.-.- Cytochrome P450 oxidase
* EC 1.6.3.1 NADPH oxidase
* EC 1.17.3.2 Xanthine oxidase
* EC 1.1.3.8 L-gulonolactone oxidase
* EC 1.10.3.2 Laccase
* EC 1.4.3.13 Lysyl oxidase
* EC 1.10.3.2 Polyphenol oxidase
* Sulfhydryl oxidase. This enzyme oxidises thiol groups.

==Oxidase test==
In microbiology, the oxidase test is used as a phenotypic characteristic for the identification of bacterial strains; it determines whether a given bacterium produces cytochrome oxidases (and therefore utilizes oxygen with an electron transfer chain).

The test is used to determine whether a bacterium is an aerobe or anaerobe. However a bacterium that is oxidase negative is not necessarily anaerobic, it may just indicate the bacterium does not possess cytochrome c oxidase.

<text>The Apple Store is a chain of retail stores owned and operated by Apple Inc. The stores sell, service and repair various Apple products, including Mac desktop and MacBook laptop personal computers, iPhone smartphones, iPad tablet computers, Apple Watch smartwatches, Apple TV digital media players, software, and both Apple-branded and selected third-party accessories.

The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company&#x27;s products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple&#x27;s online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage over the years, with 535 stores across 27 countries and regions worldwide, opening its latest store in Downtown Detroit, Michigan, United States. Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.

In May 2016, Angela Ahrendts, Apple&#x27;s then-Senior Vice President of retail, unveiled a significantly redesigned Apple Store in Union Square, San Francisco, featuring large glass doors for the entry, open spaces, and rebranded rooms. 

Many Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls, but Apple has built several stand-alone flagship stores in high-profile locations. It has been granted design patents and received architectural awards for its stores&#x27; designs and construction, specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes. The success of Apple Stores has had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers, who have lost traffic, control and profits due to perceived higher quality of service and products at Apple Stores. Apple&#x27;s notable brand loyalty among consumers causes long lines of hundreds of people at new Apple Store openings or product releases. Due to the popularity of the brand, Apple receives many job applications, many of which come from young workers. Apple Store employees receive above-average pay, are offered money toward education and health care, and receive product discounts; however, there are limited or no paths of career advancement. A May 2016 report with an anonymous retail employee highlighted a hostile work environment with harassment from customers, intense internal criticism, and a lack of significant bonuses for securing major business contracts.

== Overview ==
Many Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls, but Apple has several stand-alone flagship stores in high-profile locations, such as the one located in Grand Central Terminal in New York City. Several multi-level stores feature glass staircases, and some also glass bridges. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 2011 that these features were part of then-CEO Steve Jobs&#x27; extensive attention to detail, and Apple received a design patent in 2002 for its glass staircase design. Historically, Apple has partnered with architectural firm Bohlin Cywinski Jackson in designing and creating its original retail stores, and has in recent years partnered with architectural firm Foster + Partners in designing its newer stores, as well as its corporate Apple Park campus.
Apple has received numerous architectural awards for its store designs, and its &quot;iconic&quot; glass cube, designed in part by Peter Bohlin, at Apple&#x27;s Fifth Avenue store in New York City, received a separate design patent in 2014.

Ron Johnson held the position of Senior Vice President of Retail Operations from 2001 until November 1, 2011. During his tenure, it was reported that while Johnson was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, inventory was controlled by then-COO and now-CEO Tim Cook, who has a background in supply chain management. In January 2012, Apple transferred retail leadership to John Browett. However, after attempts to cut costs, including reducing new hires and limiting staff hours, he was fired after six months, later telling a conference that he &quot;just didn&#x27;t fit with the way they ran the business&quot;. In October 2013, Apple hired Angela Ahrendts from Burberry. When Ahrendts left in April 2019, Deirdre O’Brien expanded from Worldwide Sales and Operations, to People, and currently, to People and Retail. In an interview with Funke Mediengruppe in May 2021 she commented, Apple is sticking to its plan to open more stores around the globe in the future, as reported by &quot;Bloomberg&quot;. 

===Work environment===
Due to the popularity of the brand, applicants for jobs at Apple Stores are numerous, with many young workers applying. The pace of work is high due to the popularity of the iPhone and iPad. Employees typically work for only a few years as career prospects are limited with no path of advancement other than limited retail management slots. Apple Store employees make above-average pay for retail employees and are offered benefits including 401(k) plans, product discounts, and reduced price on stock. The retention rate for the technicians who staff the Genius Bar is more than 90%.

A May 2016 &quot;Business Insider&quot; article featured a lengthy interview with an anonymous Apple Store retail worker in the United Kingdom, where the employee highlighted significant dissatisfaction and issues for retail workers, including harassment and death threats from customers, an intense internal criticism policy that feels &quot;like a cult&quot;, a lack of any significant bonus if a worker manages to secure a business contract worth &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot;, a lack of promotion opportunities, and are paid so little that many workers are unable to buy products themselves even with a &quot;generous&quot; discount on any Apple product or Apple stock.

According to an April 2022 press release, over 70 percent of the eligible employees in the Apple Store located in the Cumberland Mall in Atlanta, Georgia, have signified interest in unionizing. The employees asked for a $28 per hour wage, better benefits, and profit-sharing. If successful, the effort would make the store the first unionized Apple retail store in the United States.

==History==

===Third-party retail===
Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, returned to the company as interim CEO in 1997. According to his biographer Walter Isaacson, Jobs began a concerted campaign to help sales by improving the retail presentation of Macintosh computers. Even with new products launched under his watch, like the iMac and the PowerBook G3 and an online store, Apple still relied heavily on big-box computer and electronics stores for most of its sales. There, customers continued to deal with poorly trained and ill-maintained Mac sections that did not foster customer loyalty to Apple and did not help differentiate the Mac user experience from Windows. In fact, the retailer trend was towards selling their own generic in-house brand PCs which used even cheaper components than those by major PC makers, increasing retailer overall margins by keeping the manufacturing profits. This &quot;provided a powerful profit motive to convert customers interested in buying a Mac into the owners of a new, cheaply assembled, house brand PC&quot;.

Tim Cook, who joined Apple in 1998 as Senior Vice President for Worldwide Operations, announced the company would &quot;cut some channel partners that may not be providing the buying experience [Apple expects]. We&#x27;re not happy with everybody.&quot; Jobs severed Apple&#x27;s ties with every big box retailer, including Sears, Montgomery Ward, Best Buy, Circuit City, Computer City, and Office Max to focus its retail efforts with CompUSA—which reached an agreement to establish dedicated departments for Apple hardware, staffed by trained employees and representatives. Apple also worked with local user groups to promote launch events for new hardware and Mac OS releases.

Between 1997 and 2000, the number of Mac authorized resellers dropped from 20,000 to just 11,000. The majority of these were cuts made by Apple itself. Jobs proclaimed that Apple would be targeting Dell as a competitor, with Cook&#x27;s mandate to match or exceed Dell&#x27;s lean inventories and streamlined supply chain. Jobs made an open statement to Michael Dell, &quot;with our new products and our new store and our new build-to-order, we&#x27;re coming after you, buddy.&quot; While Dell had operated as direct mail order and online order company, having pulled out of retailers to realize greater profit margins and efficiency, Apple had direct orders with sales handled by its channel partners, other mail order resellers, independent dealerships, and the new relationship with CompUSA.

A revised concept for an Apple &quot;store-within-a-store&quot; was designed by Eight Inc., a San Francisco-based firm who had developed Apple&#x27;s presences at the MacWorld expo; they were designed as a self-contained showroom with more minimalistic design that emphasized the products themselves. After a trial at retail outlets in Japan, CompUSA began to adopt the new concept for its locations beginning in 1999. The &quot;store within a store&quot; approach still had shortcomings; acting as a mystery shopper, &quot;Macworld&quot; writer David Pogue observed that all but one of the locations he visited had employees who actively steered him towards Windows PCs and attacked Macs (such as claiming they did not have software available); the company&#x27;s PR director Suzanne Shelton stated that finding &quot;specialized&quot; talent was difficult. Despite this, CompUSA sales of Macs had increased. Apple then added Best Buy as a second authorized reseller. Challenges still remained, as resellers&#x27; profit margins on selling Macs was only around 9%, and selling Macs was only worthwhile if ongoing service and support contracts were provided, of which retailer experiences were inconsistent.

=== Online store ===
In 1997, the year Steve Jobs returned to Apple, Dell founder and CEO Michael Dell was asked how he would fix Apple. Dell responded: &quot;I&#x27;d shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders&quot;. This angered Jobs, due to Dell&#x27;s success with its online store originally built by NeXT, his former business that Apple acquired to bring Jobs back. A team of Apple and NeXT employees spent several months building an online store that would be better than Dell&#x27;s. On November 10, 1997, Steve Jobs announced the online store at an Apple press event, and during his keynote speech, he said: &quot;I guess what we want to tell you, Michael, is that with our new products and our new store and our new build-to-order manufacturing, we&#x27;re coming after you, buddy.&quot;

In August 2015, Apple revamped the online storefront, removing the dedicated &quot;Store&quot; tab and making the entire website a retail experience. Later, in August 2021, a redesigned store section of the website returned, with products still being able to be purchased directly through their respective pages.

===Origins===

Jobs believed the Apple retail program needed to fundamentally change the relationship to the customer, and provide more control over the presentation of Apple products and the Apple brand message. Jobs recognized the limitations of third-party retailing and began investigating options to change the model.

In 1999, Jobs personally recruited Millard Drexler, former CEO of Gap Inc., to serve on Apple&#x27;s board of directors. In 2000, Jobs hired Ron Johnson from Target. The retail and development teams headed by Allen Moyer from The Walt Disney Company then began a series of mock-ups for the Apple Store inside a warehouse near the company&#x27;s Cupertino headquarters.

On May 15, 2001, Jobs hosted a press event at Apple&#x27;s first store, located at the Tysons Corner Center mall in Tysons, Virginia, near Washington, D.C. The store officially opened on May 19, along with another store in Glendale Galleria in Glendale, California. More than 7,700 people visited Apple&#x27;s first two stores in the opening weekend, spending a total of .

=== Expansion ===

Several publications and analysts predicted the failure of Apple Stores. However, the Apple retail program established its merits, bypassing the sales-per-square-foot measurement of competing nearby stores, and in 2004 reached $1 billion in annual sales, the fastest of any retailer in history. Sales continued to grow, reaching $1 billion a quarter by 2006. Then-CEO Steve Jobs said that &quot;People haven&#x27;t been willing to invest this much time and money or engineering in a store before&quot;, adding that &quot;It&#x27;s not important if the customer knows that. They just feel it. They feel something&#x27;s a little different.&quot; In 2011, Apple Stores in the United States had an average revenue of $473,000 for each employee. According to research firm RetailSails, the Apple Store chain ranked first among U.S. retailers in terms of sales per unit area in 2011, almost doubling Tiffany, the second retailer on the list. On a global level, all Apple Stores had a combined revenue of US$16 billion. Under the leadership of Ron Johnson, the former senior Vice President of Retail Operations, the Apple Stores have, according to an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, been responsible for &quot;[turning] the boring computer sales floor into a sleek playroom filled with gadgets&quot;. The Apple Stores have also been credited with raising the company&#x27;s brand equity, with Scott Galloway, Professor of Marketing at New York University Stern School of Business, stating that the Stores are the &quot;temple to the brand which is this unbelievable experience called an Apple Store, and then you have this very mediocre experience called an AT&amp;T or Verizon connect your phone experience for Samsung and the other Android players&quot;.

Apple has since re-established ties with major big box retailers like Best Buy and Staples. Authorized Apple resellers have a dedicated store-within-a-store section, offering a distinctive Apple-style experience to showcase products. The relationship with Best Buy calls for the company to send Apple Solutions Consultants (ASCs) to train Best Buy employees to be familiar with Apple&#x27;s product lineup.

In an interview with Funke Mediengruppe in May 2021 Deirdre O&#x27;Brien commented, &quot;Apple is sticking to its plan to open more stores around the globe in the future.&quot;

Apple has announced it will expand Online Apple Store operations to Saudi Arabia by Summer 2025 and Retail Apple Store by 2026. It is in a stage of building a store in Diryah.

=== Influence ===
Apple Stores have considerably changed the landscape for consumer electronics retailers and influenced other technological companies to follow suit. According to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;Apple’s retail stores have taken traffic, control and profits away from Verizon as well as electronics retailers, such as Best Buy, that once looked at wireless phones as a lucrative profit source&quot;. &quot;CNET&quot; has reported that the &quot;Apple retail experience hurts Best Buy&quot; and noted, &quot;Buy a MacBook at the Apple Store and it&#x27;s hard to go back to the Best Buy Windows laptop buying experience&quot;. The publication also wrote that &quot;Apple salespeople are generally more knowledgeable, the products themselves are generally higher quality, and the stores are more appealing, aesthetically and practically.&quot;

In October 2009, reports surfaced that Steve Jobs and his retail team would help &quot;drastically overhaul&quot; Disney Stores. His involvement was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;particularly notable&quot;, given his work on the &quot;highly successful&quot; Apple Stores and his election to Disney&#x27;s board of directors in 2006.

In August 2009, the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; reported that Apple&#x27;s first store in the United Kingdom, at Regent Street, was the most profitable shop of its size in London, with the highest sales per square foot, taking in £60 million a year, or £2,000 per square foot.

Many other electronics retailers from around the world such as Huawei, Samsung, Xiaomi started to follow the designing trend of Apple Store.

=== Redesign ===
In May 2016, Apple significantly redesigned its Union Square Apple Store in downtown San Francisco, adding large glass doors for the entry, open spaces with touch-sensitive tables and shelves for product displays, and rebranded rooms for the store. &quot;The Avenue&quot; is the central location for hardware, as well as for receiving advice from salespersons and &quot;Creative Pros&quot; with specialized knowledge of music, photography, creativity, and apps. The &quot;Genius Bar&quot; becomes the &quot;Genius Grove&quot;, a tree-lined area for help and support. &quot;The Forum&quot; features a large video screen and offers game nights, sessions with experts in creative arts, and community events. &quot;The Plaza&quot;, while limited to select locations, offers a &quot;park-like&quot; space outside the store featuring free 24/7 Wi-Fi access and will host live concerts on some weekends. Designed by Jony Ive and Angela Ahrendts, the idea was to make Apple Stores into &quot;town squares&quot;, in which people come naturally to the store as a gathering place, and to &quot;help foster human experiences that draw people out of their digital bubbles&quot;. The new design will be adopted to every store Apple has, and while renovation is undergoing, stores are either relocated or temporarily closed.

In April 2017, Apple announced that its &quot;Today at Apple&quot; educational sessions, which launched with its Union Square redesign in 2016 and offer more than 60 free hands-on sessions for creative skills, will also be expanded to all of its stores.

Starting May 2018, a Video Wall was added to stores around the world, and upgraded in some stores like Apple Palo Alto.

==Genius Bar==

All Apple Stores feature a Genius Bar, where customers can receive technical advice or set up service and repair for their products. The Genius Bar provides hardware service on products that are not classified vintage or obsolete. However, in most cases the Geniuses will at least attempt to assist customers with older hardware.

The Genius Bar at Apple Stores offers same-day service for both OLED/LCD screen and lithium-ion battery replacement. If the in-house technician needs to send the affected device to an Apple Repair Center, most repaired or replaced iPhones will be returned or ready for pickup in approximately 3 business days.

In May 2017, Apple launched a new program called Today at Apple. Customers can come in and receive free training from a Creative in more than 60 different sessions. Topics include basic device knowledge, Apple&#x27;s professional film, and music editing software, coding for kids, and tools for using Apple products in classroom-based learning.

The largest Genius Bar in the world is located in Amsterdam.

== Store openings ==
Apple Store openings and new product releases can draw crowds of hundreds, with some waiting in line as much as a day before the opening. The opening of New York City&#x27;s Fifth Avenue store in 2006 was highly frequented, and had visitors from Europe who flew in for the event. The opening of Apple Michigan Avenue was attended by Tim Cook and Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner, among hundreds of others.

== Stores at corporate locations ==

In 1993, Apple opened a store, then known as The Company Store, at its Apple Campus on Infinite Loop in Cupertino, California. Predating the modern Apple Store chain, the store was, at the time, the only place in the world where Apple merchandise could be purchased, including T-shirts, mugs, and pens. In June 2015, the store was closed for renovations, and in September it was reopened, offering a new design resembling other Apple Store locations and, for the first time, selling iPhones. The Infinite Loop location closed on January 20, 2024.

As part of the process of moving its corporate headquarters to the new Apple Park complex, a similar store with exclusive merchandise opened as part of the Apple Park Visitor Center on November 17, 2017.

==Imitations==
In July 2011, an American expatriate blogger who lives in the southwestern Chinese city of Kunming reported on her discovery of what she called &quot;the best ripoff store we had ever seen&quot;—a fake Apple Store, complete with the glass exterior, wood display tables, winding staircase and large promotional posters found in legitimate Apple Stores, and with employees wearing lanyards and the same T-shirts as actual Apple Store employees. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that the store had &quot;gotten widespread international attention for the remarkable lengths to which its proprietors seem to have gone to mimic the look and feel of a real Apple Store.&quot; The fake Apple Store was mentioned by U.S. presidential contender Mitt Romney in the second 2012 election debate. Chinese law prohibits retailers from copying the look and feel of competitors&#x27; stores, but enforcement is lax.

According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, unauthorized Apple resellers are found throughout China; the blogger&#x27;s original post noted that two such stores were located within walking distance of the first knockoff, one of them with a misspelled sign reading &quot;Apple Stoer&quot;. An employee of the first knockoff confirmed that the store was not one of the 13 authorized Apple resellers in Kunming. In a follow-up report, Reuters indicated that local authorities in Kunming had closed two fake Apple Stores in that city due to lack of official business permits, but allowed three other such stores to stay open, including the one that had attracted international attention. The operators of that store had applied for a reseller license from Apple. At the time of the report, only four legitimate Apple Stores had opened in China, with two in Beijing and two in Shanghai.

These imitation Apple Store locations should not be confused with Apple Premium Resellers, which are independent businesses authorized to sell Apple products, and which are expected by Apple to offer services comparable to the company&#x27;s corporate stores and a similar store design aesthetic. Apple Premium Resellers typically operate in countries and suburban communities not served by Apple Stores.

<text>Cyclopentolate is a muscarinic antagonist. It is commonly used as an eye drop during pediatric eye examinations to dilate the eye (mydriatic) and prevent the eye from focusing/accommodating (cycloplegic). Cyclopentolate or atropine can also be administered to reverse muscarinic and central nervous system effects of indirect cholinomimetic (anti-AChase) administration.

It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

After instillation of cyclopentolate, pupil dilation (mydriasis) typically lasts up to 24 hours, while paralysis of the ciliary muscle (cycloplegia) typically lasts 6-24 hours. During this time, patients may be more light sensitive than normal and may notice close objects blurred (and possibly distant objects blurred, depending on the patient&#x27;s visual system). Cyclopentolate is often chosen as a milder, shorter-lasting, cycloplegic alternative to atropine, another cycloplegic agent which lasts much longer. Tropicamide is an even shorter-lasting cycloplegic than cyclopentolate, but is less reliable for finding latent hyperopia. Cyclopentolate drops act rapidly to dilate the pupil. 

The side and adverse effects of cyclopentolate are similar to the side and adverse effects of other anticholinergic medications. Because of that, extra caution should be taken when prescribing cyclopentolate to patients who are already taking other anticholinergic drugs. A possible ocular (eye-related) side effect is increase in pressure inside the eye, which is of particular concern when there is a predisposition toward or a presence of glaucoma. Other ocular side effects can include burning sensations, discomfort with bright light (photophobia), blurred vision, irritation, inflammation of the eye mucous membranes (conjunctivitis), inflammation of the cornea of the eye (keratitis), and other issues. Nonocular (not eye-related) side and adverse effects can include neuropsychiatric symptoms. like subtle concentration and memory problems, subtle decision-making problems, drowsiness, and more pronounced disorientation to time and place, confusion, disturbances of speech and movement, hyperactivity, restlessness, and seizures. Temporary psychosis can develop that includes hallucinations, particularly when higher doses are used in children or older adults on other anticholinergic medications. Patients with dementia of the Alzheimer&#x27;s type can experience worsening of their dementia symptoms. Additional side and adverse effects can include skin flushing, skin rashes, gastrointestinal problems, increased heart beat (tachycardia), increased body temperature (hyperpyrexia), blood vessel dilation, urinary retention, dry mouth and reduced sweating, and reduced bronchial secretions. Severe poisoning with cyclopentolate may result in coma, paralysis of breathing, and death. Cyclopentolate derivatives can be used as an antidote for organophosphate poisoning.
Lethality of cyclopentolate has been studied in rodents. The LD50 (the dose at which 50% of animals die from the drug) is approximately 4000 mg/kg in rats and 960 mg/kg in mice. Readily recognizable symptoms of overdose include tachycardia, dizziness, dry mouth, behavioral disturbances, uncoordination, and drowsiness.

Cycloplegia is necessary in cases of suspected latent hyperopia (or &quot;over-focusing&quot;) so that an ophthalmologist or optometrist can accurately measure how much a person has to flex their focusing muscle (accommodation) in order to see in the distance and up-close. Correction of latent hyperopia in children can often prevent, or sometimes correct, unwanted eye turns (strabismus), some forms of refractive amblyopia, and may alleviate eye strain or frontal headaches caused by prolonged near-work. Cycloplegia is also helpful in relieving accommodative spasm.

== History ==
Cyclopentolate was first synthesized in 1952 as a chemical analogue of atropine. It was one of several derivatives of an analogue to tropic acid which were tested for pharmacological action &quot;in a search for new and better antispasmodic agents.&quot;

Brand names for cyclopentolate include Cyclogyl, Cylate, Mydrilate, and Pentolair.

<text>The flag of Nova Scotia consists of a blue saltire on a white field defaced with the royal arms of Scotland. Adopted in 1929 after a royal warrant was issued, it has been the flag of the province since January 19 of that year. It is a banner of arms modelled after the province&#x27;s coat of arms. Utilized as a pennant since 1858, it was officially recognized under primary legislation as Nova Scotia&#x27;s flag in 2013. When flown with the flags of other Canadian provinces and the national flag, it is fourth in the order of precedence.

==History==
The Scottish first settled in modern-day Nova Scotia after 1621, when (King of Scotland and England) conferred the land to William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling, via royal charter and gave it the Latin name for &quot;New Scotland&quot;. Four years later, the colony was granted its own coat of arms by Charles I, with the emblem first recorded at the Court of the Lord Lyon in Edinburgh on May 28, 1625. Towards the end of that same decade, the Scots established two short-lived settlements there that were ultimately unsuccessful. Sovereignty over the territory subsequently changed hands between the French and the British throughout the 17th century. This continued until 1713, when the Peace of Utrecht saw France permanently relinquish mainland Nova Scotia to the United Kingdom.

The flag of Nova Scotia was reportedly first flown on its merchant vessels during the Age of Sail in the 19th century, but vexillologist Whitney Smith opines that these ambiguous accounts are doubtful. The first documented usage of the coat of arms of Nova Scotia as a banner of arms was in June 1858 during a celebratory tribute at a cricket club, as stated by an article in the &quot;Acadian Recorder&quot; at the time and recounted in the &quot;Provincial Flag Act&quot;. Nova Scotia later acquiesced to a federation with the other colonies of New Brunswick and the United Province of Canada in 1867 under the British North America Act to form the Dominion of Canada. There was vociferous sentiment against Confederation in some parts of Nova Scotia, with a few of its residents flying flags at half-mast on July 1, 1867. The four provinces comprising the new Dominion were allocated individual coats of arms. However, the College of Arms, the heraldic authority in England, was apparently unaware of the earlier grant of arms to Nova Scotia in 1625. Consequently, Queen Victoria issued a Royal Warrant on May 26 of the following year, conferring a different coat of arms on the new province. This consisted of a salmon and three thistles.

The new coat of arms, however, did not become popular in Nova Scotia. As a result, an Order in Council was promulgated by the province&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor on March 7, 1928, asking for the reinstatement of the 1625 arms. A Royal Warrant was subsequently issued by on January 19, 1929, granting the request. It was the first flag in the overseas Commonwealth to be approved by royal charter – thus purportedly making it the oldest flag of a Dominion – and is the oldest provincial flag in Canada. However, it is not the first Canadian provincial flag to be officially adopted, a distinction held by the flag of Quebec, which was approved by the Parliament of Quebec on March 7, 1950, two years after the order in council was announced.

In a 2001 online survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association, Nova Scotia&#x27;s flag ranked within the top sixth of state, provincial and territorial flags from Canada, the United States, and select current and former territories of the United States. It finished in 12th place out of 72, and placed second among Canadian flags after Quebec. Twelve years later, the flag was officially recognized as the flag of the province under an Act of Legislature. This came about after an eleven-year-old student from Canso uncovered this aberration while conducting research for a school project. Unlike the flags of British Columbia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island – which are also provincial flags that are banner of arms – Nova Scotia&#x27;s was never recognized as such under a provincial statute. The student contacted the member of the Legislative Assembly representing her electoral district, Jim Boudreau, who consulted with the Legislative Library and other government bodies to ascertain that such a law was not on the books. He consequently introduced the bill that became the &quot;Provincial Flag Act&quot; after receiving royal assent on May 10, 2013. The student and her family were invited to the House of Assembly that same month in acknowledgment of her efforts.

==Design==
===Description===
The flag of Nova Scotia has an aspect ratio of 1:2. The blazon for the banner of arms – as outlined in the letters patent registering it with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on July 20, 2007 – reads, &quot;Argent a saltire Azure, overall on an escutcheon Or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules&quot;. The official colour scheme, according to the website of the Government of Nova Scotia, follows approximately the Pantone Matching System as indicated below. The colour numbers for the flag&#x27;s white shade are not specified.

===Symbolism===
The colours and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. According to historians Ian McKay and Robin Bates, the Cross of Saint Andrew alludes to divine providence and its part in enabling Scottish immigrants to be &quot;the first among the Nova Scotians&quot;. The royal arms epitomize feudal times in Scotland and how this sowed the seeds of the province&#x27;s constancy as a society. Taken altogether, the saltire and the royal arms signify how Nova Scotia was formerly a colony of the Kingdom of Scotland with the backing of its royal family (the House of Stuart).

===Similarities===
The Nova Scotian flag has a conspicuous resemblance to both the national flag and the Royal Banner of Scotland. The shield is also identical to the royal arms of Scotland. This is due to Nova Scotia&#x27;s aforementioned historical connections to the country. The colours of Saint Andrew&#x27;s Cross were reversed on the province&#x27;s flag in order to bring about a more distinct contrast with the royal arms, as stated by Whitney Smith.

==Protocol==

Advice regarding flag etiquette is the responsibility of the province&#x27;s Protocol Office. When flown together with the flag of Canada and the other provincial and territorial flags, the flag of Nova Scotia is fourth in the order of precedence (after the national flag and, in descending order of precedence, the flags of Ontario and Quebec, and ahead of New Brunswick). Even though Nova Scotia entered into Confederation on the same date as those three provinces (July 1, 1867), it is placed third among the group since its size of population at the time was the third-largest.

<text>The flag of the Northwest Territories, is the subnational flag of the Northwest Territories of Canada. It was adopted in 1969 by the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories.

==Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company flag==

The NWT had no flag of its own during its early history, but the flag of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company continued to be used at that company&#x27;s forts, stores and other establishments. The Legislative Assembly of the NWT was created in 1951.

==Current flag==
The Northwest Territories&#x27; first official flag was chosen by a special committee of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories in 1969. The committee reviewed entries from a Canada wide contest. The winner of the contest was Robert Bessant from Margaret, Manitoba.

The flag features a blue field, on which is a Canadian pale (a white stripe taking up half the width of the flag), with at the centre, the shield from the coat of arms of the Northwest Territories. The blue represents the abundant Northwest Territories waters, whereas the white represents snow and ice.

Two blue panels represent the Northwest Territories&#x27; many rivers and lakes. The white section, representing ice and snow, is equal in area to the 2 blue panels combined. The territorial Shield is centred in the white section. The white section of the Shield, with a wavy blue line dividing it, represents the Arctic Ocean and the Northwest Passage. A diagonal line, representing the tree line, divides the lower portion into a green and red section with green symbolizing the trees and red symbolizing the tundra. The gold bars in the green section and the white fox in the red section represent the abundant minerals and furs upon which the history and prosperity of the Northwest Territories has been based.

<text>The flag of Yukon is a green, white, and blue tricolour with the coat of arms of Yukon at the centre above a wreath of fireweed, the territorial flower. An official flag for Yukon was created during the 1960s, a decade in which the national flag of Canada was chosen as well as several other provincial flags were created. The flag of Yukon was officially selected from a territory-wide design competition in 1967, with the winning design adopted on March 1, 1968.

==History==
The flag of Yukon was officially adopted on March 1, 1968. The flag was chosen from a territory-wide competition as part of Canada&#x27;s Centennial celebrations of 1967. The competition was sponsored by the Whitehorse branch of the Royal Canadian Legion. A C$100 prize was offered to the winning design. There were a total of 137 submissions with the winning design coming from Yukon College graduate Lynn Lambert. Lambert submitted 10 designs of which one made the final three designs as selected by a committee, with his eventually being named the winner. A prototype design was sent to Ottawa for suitable heraldic description. An expert in Ottawa sent back an amended version of the submitted flag design. The committee in Whitehorse however kept with the original design. The flag was adopted by the &#x27;Flag Act&#x27; on December 1, 1967.

===Symbolism===
The flag is divided into three coloured panels: 
*green representing Yukon&#x27;s forests
*white representing snow
*blue representing Yukon&#x27;s lakes and rivers
In the centre of the white panel is the Coat of Arms of Yukon above a wreath of fireweed, the floral emblem of the Yukon. The crest of the Coat of Arms is a Malamute sled dog, a common work dog in the Yukon, standing on a mound of snow. The shield of the Coat of Arms contains at the top, a cross of St. George for England with a roundel with a pattern of vair (fur), called &quot;Roundel in Vair&quot;. Below in the middle of the shield are two wavy lines representing Yukon&#x27;s rivers on a blue background. Finally at the bottom of the shield are two red triangles representing Yukon&#x27;s mountains with gold circles in them representing the Yukon&#x27;s great mineral resources.

===Technical description===
The flag of Yukon has a flag ratio of 1:2, equivalent to the flag of Canada. The centre white panel is larger by one and a half times the width of each of the other two panels, for a pale ratio of 1 to 1.5 to 1.

===Terminology===
In flag terminology, the flag is a tricolour, meaning it has three colours, in approximately equal size. However, it may not be considered a true tricolour as it is defaced, containing the coat of arms of Yukon, where a true tricolour contains no additional symbols.

<text>This is a list of cities in Malta. By the usual standards that most other countries use when designating a city, Malta&#x27;s cities would be too small to be considered such, and in fact Malta is sometimes regarded as a single city-state. Malta&#x27;s cities are regarded as such because they received the designation of &quot;città&quot; at some point during their history. In Maltese law, no distinction is made between cities, towns, and villages; city status is purely honorary and colloquial. Malta is divided into 68 local councils. The local councils which formerly had city status all feature a mural crown on the crest of their coat of arms. The table shows the historical cities:

<text>This list of cities in Mali tabulates all the largest communes in the country of Mali (including those in the north-eastern portion where the Mali Government no longer exercises de facto control). Besides the largest cities and towns (all urban communes are shown), this table also includes other large rural communes with a population in excess of 50,000.

By far the largest agglomeration in Mali is the capital, Bamako, with a population of 1,809,106 (at the 2009 Census). Thus about 12½ percent of Mali&#x27;s population lives in Bamako.

==Cities==
The following table lists all communes with over 50,000 population from the 1 April 2009 census, together with the higher-level administrative unit (&quot;région&quot;) and second-level unit (&quot;cercle&quot;) in which each is situated. The population figures refer to the real city (i.e. commune) without any suburbs in neighbouring communes.

Bamako is a separate capital district and is not within any &quot;région&quot; or &quot;cercle&quot;; it comprises six urban communes (not individually listed in the table below), which are numbered rather than named.

The next table lists all the remaining &quot;urban&quot; communes with under 50,000 population from the 1 April 2009 census, together with the higher-level administrative unit (&quot;région&quot;) and second-level unit (&quot;cercle&quot;) in which each is situated. The population figures refer to the real city (i.e. commune) without any suburbs in neighbouring communes.

<doc id="501040" wikidata="Q6630132" url="?curid=501040" title="Vug">
<text>A vug, vugh, or vugg () is a small- to medium-sized cavity inside rock. It may be formed through a variety of processes. Most commonly, cracks and fissures opened by tectonic activity (folding and faulting) are partially filled by quartz, calcite, and other secondary minerals. Open spaces within breccias formed by an ancient collapse are another important source of vugs.

Vugs may also form when mineral crystals or fossils inside a rock matrix are later removed through erosion or dissolution processes, leaving behind irregular voids. The inner surfaces of such vugs are often coated with a crystal druse. Fine crystals are often found in vugs where the open space allows the free development of external crystal form.

The term &quot;vug&quot; is not applied to veins and fissures that have become completely filled, but may be applied to any small cavities within such veins. Geodes are a vug-formed rock, although that term is usually reserved for more rounded crystal-lined cavities in sedimentary rocks and ancient lavas.

The word &quot;vug&quot; was introduced to the English language by Cornish miners, from the days when Cornwall was a major supplier of tin. The Cornish word was , which meant &quot;cave&quot;.

<text>IX Corps was a corps-sized formation of the British Army that existed during the First and the Second World Wars.

==First World War==
The IX Corps was formed in England in 1915 in readiness to make a new landing at Suvla during the Battle of Gallipoli. Headquarters was formed at the Tower of London. Command of the corps was given to Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Stopford. His handling of the corps during the August offensive, the Battle of Sari Bair warranted his replacement after only nine days with Lieutenant-General Julian Byng.

During the Gallipoli campaign the corps comprised the following divisions:
* 10th (Irish) Division
* 11th (Northern) Division
* 13th (Western) Division
* 53rd (Welsh) Division
* 54th (East Anglian) Division
* 2nd Mounted Division
* IX Corps Signals was provided by London District Signals, Royal Engineers

Following the British evacuation of Gallipoli, the corps was moved to France in 1916, where it was commanded by Alexander Hamilton-Gordon until he was relieved in 1918.

In April 1918 the corps was allotted those divisions which had suffered severe casualties in the fighting during the Operation Michael the First Battle of the Somme (1918) and the Battle of the Lys,
* 8th Division
* 19th (Western) Division
* 21st Division
* 25th Division
* 50th (Northumbrian) Division

These divisions were moved south to a quiet sector to reform. This sector was the unlucky target of the next German offensive, the Third Battle of the Aisne in May–June 1918, causing further losses to IX Corps. General Denis Duchêne, commander of the French Sixth Army, had deployed IX Corps (five divisions) too far forward, on the Chemin des Dames ridge, which had been gained at such cost in the Second Battle of the Aisne the previous year. (The French Commander-in-Chief Philippe Pétain and the Army Group Commander Franchet d’Esperey would have preferred the ridge to be lightly held and the main defence to be a battle zone between it and the River Aisne).

In September 1918 the following divisions joined the corps:
* 6th Infantry Division
At the time of the Armistice the IX Corps was part of the Fourth Army.

==Second World War==
Disbanded in 1919 after the First World War, IX Corps was reformed during the Second World War in Britain in April 1941, under the command of Lieutenant-General Ridley Pakenham-Walsh. The 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division and the Durham and North Riding County Division transferred to IX Corps from X Corps on 9 April 1941, which suggests this is the date the IX Corps became effective. The Northumberland County Division joined IX Corps the following day.

The 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division was transferred to the corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Edwin Morris, on 21 November 1941. On 30 November, both of the county divisions were disbanded, and on 1 December 1941, the corps was renamed IX Corps District. The 15th Division left the IX Corps District on 28 September 1942, to transfer to Northumbrian District, suggesting the corps temporarily ceased to be operational on this date.

IX Corps, now commanded by Lieutenant-General John Crocker, was sent to take part in the Tunisian Campaign in the British First Army (Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson). The IX Corps headquarters, with Brigadier Gordon MacMillan as its chief of staff, landed in and opened as the reserve for the Allied 18th Army Group on 24 March 1943. The 6th Armoured Division transferred to the corps from V Corps on 12 March 1943. The corps also took command of the US 34th Infantry Division and the 128th Infantry Brigade Group, part of the 46th Infantry Division and commenced an attack on Pinchon-Fondouk on the southern flank of the First Army.

For the final offensive in North Africa several veteran formations from the Eighth Army (General Sir Bernard Montgomery) arrived to reinforce the IX Corps, which was to play a leading role in the final offensive. The British 7th Armoured Division, from the Eighth Army, joined IX Corps on 30 April. The 4th Indian Infantry Division, also from the Eighth Army, joined on 30 April, followed by the 201st Guards Brigade, with the 4th Infantry Division joining on 3 May. This gave IX Corps, now commanded by Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks (replacing Crocker who had been injured by a PIAT in a training incident), two armoured divisions and two infantry divisions. The final assault commenced on 5 May with the two infantry divisions forcing the Medjez-el-Bab gap, through which the two armoured divisions passed through to bring about the eventual surrender of the Axis forces on 13 May 1943.

With the surrender of almost 250,000 Axis soldiers in North Africa, the 7th Armoured Division transferred to V Corps on 18 May 1943, the 4th Infantry Division following it four days later, and the 6th Armoured Division (with the attached 201st Guards Brigade) on 26 May. IX Corps, with no commander after Horrocks returned to X Corps and as Crocker was still injured, was disbanded on 31 May 1943.

<text>Jarosite is a basic hydrous sulfate of potassium and ferric iron (Fe-III) with a chemical formula of KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6. This sulfate mineral is formed in ore deposits by the oxidation of iron sulfides. Jarosite is often produced as a byproduct during the purification and refining of zinc and is also commonly associated with acid mine drainage and acid sulfate soil environments.

==Physical properties==

Jarosite has a trigonal crystal structure and is brittle, with basal cleavage, a hardness of 2.5–3.5, and a specific gravity of 3.15–3.26. It is translucent to opaque with a vitreous to dull luster, and is colored dark yellow to yellowish-brown. It can sometimes be confused with limonite or goethite with which it commonly occurs in the gossan (oxidized cap over an ore body). Jarosite is an iron analogue of the potassium aluminium sulfate, alunite.

== Solid solution series ==

The alunite supergroup includes the alunite, jarosite, beudantite, crandallite and florencite subgroups. The alunite supergroup minerals are isostructural with each other and substitution between them occurs, resulting in several solid solution series. The alunite supergroup has the general formula AB3(TO4)2(OH)6. In the alunite subgroup B is Al, and in the jarosite subgroup B is Fe3+. The beudantite subgroup has the general formula AB3(XO4)(SO4)(OH)6, the crandallite subgroup AB3(TO4)2(OH)5•H2O and the florencite subgroup AB3(TO4)2(OH)5 or 6.
In the jarosite-alunite series Al may substitute for Fe and a complete solid solution series between jarosite and alunite, KAl3(SO4)2(OH)6, probably exists, but intermediate members are rare. The material from Kopec, Czech Republic, has about equal Fe and Al, but the amount of Al in jarosite is usually small.

When jarosite forms from pyrite oxidation in sedimentary clays, the main sources of K+ are illite, a non-swelling clay, or K-feldspar. In other geological settings mica&#x27;s alteration can also be a source of potassium.

In the jarosite-natrojarosite series Na substitutes for K to at least Na/K = 1:2.4 but the pure sodium end member NaFe3(SO4)2(OH)6 is not known in nature. Minerals with Na &gt; K are known as natrojarosite. End member formation (jarosite and natrojarosite) is favoured by a low temperature environment, less than 100 °C, and is illustrated by the oscillatory zoning of jarosite and natrojarosite found in samples from the Apex Mine, Arizona, and Gold Hill, Utah. This indicates that there is a wide miscibility gap between the two end members, and it is doubtful whether a complete series exists between jarosite and natrojarosite.

In hydroniumjarosite the hydronium ion H3O+ can also substitute for K+, with increased hydronium ion content causing a marked decrease in the lattice parameter &quot;c&quot;, although there is little change in &quot;a&quot;. Hydroniumjarosite will only form from alkali-deficient solutions, as alkali-rich jarosite forms preferentially.

Divalent cations may also substitute for the monovalent cation K+ in the A site. Charge balance may be achieved in three ways. 
:Firstly by replacing two monovalent cations by one divalent cation, and leaving an A site vacancy, as in plumbogummite, Pb2+Al3(PO4)2(OH)5.H2O, which is a member of the crandallite subgroup.
:Secondly by incorporating divalent ions in the B sites, as in osarizawaite, Pb2+Cu2+Al2(SO4)2(OH)6, alunite subgroup, and beaverite, Pb2+Cu2+(Fe3+,Al)2(SO4)2(OH)6, jarosite subgroup.
:Thirdly by replacing divalent anions with trivalent anions, as in beudantite, PbFe3+3(AsO4)3−(SO4)(OH)6, beudantite subgroup.

== History ==
Jarosite was first described in 1852 by August Breithaupt in the Barranco del Jaroso in the Sierra Almagrera (near Los Lobos, Cuevas del Almanzora, Almería, Spain). The name jarosite is directly derived from &quot;jara&quot;, the Spanish name of a yellow flower that belongs to the genus &quot;Cistus&quot; and grows in the sierra. The mineral and the flower have the same color.

Mysterious spheres of clay, in diameter and covered with jarosite, have been found beneath the Temple of the Feathered Serpent, an ancient six-level stepped pyramid from Mexico City.

=== Mars exploration ===
Ferric sulfate and jarosite have been detected by three martian rovers: &quot;Spirit&quot;, &quot;Opportunity&quot; and &quot;Curiosity&quot;. These substances are indicative of strongly oxidizing conditions prevailing at the surface of Mars. In May 2009, the &quot;Spirit&quot; rover became stuck when it drove over a patch of soft ferric sulfate that had been hidden under a veneer of normal-looking soil.
Because iron sulfate has very little cohesion, the rover&#x27;s wheels could not gain sufficient traction to pull the body of the rover out of the iron sulfate patch. Multiple techniques were attempted to extricate the rover, but the wheels eventually sank so deeply into the iron sulfate that the body of the rover came to rest on the Martian surface, preventing the wheels from exerting any force on the material below them. As the JPL team failed to recover the mobility of &quot;Spirit&quot;, it signified the end of the journey for the rover.

=== Antarctica deep borehole ===
On Earth, jarosite is mainly associated with the ultimate stage of pyrite oxidation in clay environment, and can also be found in mine tailings waste where acidic conditions prevail. Against all expectations, jarosite has also been fortuitously discovered in minute quantities in the form of small dust particles in ice cores recovered from a deep borehole in Antarctica. That surprising discovery was made by geologists who were searching for specific minerals capable of indicating ice age cycles within the layers of a 1620-meter-long ice core. Geologists speculate that jarosite dust could also have accumulated within ice in glaciers on Mars. However, that hypothesis is a matter of controversy because, on Mars, jarosite deposits can be very thick (up to 10 meters). However, Mars is also a very dusty planet and, in the absence of plate tectonics on Mars, glacial dust deposits might have accumulated over long periods of time.

== Use in materials science ==
Jarosite is also a more generic term denoting an extensive family of compounds of the form AM3(OH)6(SO4)2, where A+ = Na, K, Rb, NH4, H3O, Ag, Tl and M3+ = Fe, Cr, V. In condensed matter physics and materials science they are renowned for containing layers with kagome lattice structure, relating to geometrically frustrated magnets.

<text>Martin Joseph &quot;Marty&quot; Chávez (born March 2, 1952) is an American politician, businessman, and attorney who served as a member of the New Mexico Senate from 1987 to 1993 and as the 26th and 28th mayor of Albuquerque, New Mexico. He served as the Executive Director of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. and Chairman of the Advisory Board for the Center for Green Schools at U.S. Green Building Council. In 2012, he unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for the Congressional seat being vacated by Martin Heinrich, who retired from the House to run for Senate.

He was a senior advisor to Ready for Hillary, an unaffiliated Super PAC supporting of a Hillary Clinton presidential candidacy prior to her announcement. He was a member of the national finance committee of the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign.

==Early life and education==
He was born in 1952 in Albuquerque, New Mexico to a family of Hispanic heritage. Chávez attended both Catholic and public secondary schools. After graduating from Manzano High School, Chávez earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in university studies from the University of New Mexico and a Juris Doctor from Georgetown University Law Center.

== Career ==
He was the founding director of the New Mexico Workers&#x27; Compensation Administration in 1986.

===New Mexico Senate===
From 1987 to 1993, he served in the New Mexico Senate, where he helped pass the New Mexico Workers Compensation Act and to implement the Voter Registration Reform Act, known as &quot;motor voter&quot;.

===First mayoral term===

====1993 election====
He pulled a major upset by defeating former Governor David Cargo in the 1993 election for Mayor of Albuquerque 50.4%-49.6%, a difference of just 596 votes.

===1998 gubernatorial election===

In 1997, Chávez opted not to run for re-election as mayor and instead ran for Governor of New Mexico in 1998. He won the six-candidate Democratic primary with 48% of the vote and won most of the counties in the state. He defeated very experienced candidates like State Representative Gary King, former Governor Jerry Apodaca, and State Auditor Robert Vigil. In the general election he was defeated by incumbent Republican governor Gary Johnson 55%-45%.

===Second mayoral term===

====2001 election====
In 2001, Chávez again ran for Mayor of Albuquerque and finished first in a seven-candidate race.

====2005 re-election bid====
In 2005, he was the first mayor to be re-elected for two consecutive terms since the creation of the strong mayoral form of government in 1974

===Tenure===
As Mayor, Chávez partnered with the University of New Mexico, Sandia National Laboratories and leading entrepreneurs and educators to establish the Albuquerque Institute of Math and Science (AIMS), a charter high school dedicated to academic excellence. In 2009, the AIMS graduated its first senior class of 26 students. For the first time in New Mexico&#x27;s history, an entire graduating class had enrolled in college.

===Recognitions===
During his tenure as Mayor, Chávez and the City of Albuquerque received the following recognitions:
* Top Ten Places to Live In the US, U.S. News &amp; World Report (2009);
* &quot;Cool&quot; Mayor Award, Mayors for Climate Protection –cited as &quot;The Visionary&quot; for sustainable water vision, urban forestry program and climate change initiatives, ICLEI (2009);
* EPA Climate Protection Award, 1st Place, US Environmental Protection Agency (2008);
* U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Siemens Sustainable Community Award (2008);
* Fittest City in America, Men&#x27;s Fitness Magazine (2008);
* Renewable Energy Innovator of the Year Award, Association of Energy Engineers (2008);
* Best Cities for Jobs or a Career, Forbes Magazine (2007);
* Climate Protection Award, 1st Place, United States Conference of Mayors (2007);
* Most Pet Friendly City, 3rd Place, Forbes Magazine (2007);
* World Leadership Award for Water Utilities Conservation, World Leadership Forum, London, (2006)
* Number-one Place to do Business, Forbes Magazine (2006);
* Mayor of Trees Award, National Alliance for Community Trees (2004);
* William F. Dixon Award for Open Government, the Foundation for Open Government (2004);

====2008 U.S. Senate election====

On October 8, 2007, Chávez announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat that was being vacated by retiring Republican Senator Pete Domenici. Democratic leaders, including Senator Charles Schumer, Chairman of Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, recruited Tom Udall into the race.

Chávez indicated that he intended to remain in the race, referring to Udall as Washington&#x27;s &quot;fair-haired boy&quot;. However, Chavez withdrew from the race on December 7 saying, &quot;While I deeply appreciate all the support I have received, it has become very clear to me that Democrats should not be divided in the upcoming election. &quot;

====2009 re-election bid====
In 2009, Chávez succeeded in overturning a two-consecutive mayoral term limit, which he had gotten passed into law, and announced he would seek a third consecutive, and fourth overall, term as mayor. He ran against Republican State Representative Richard J. Berry and Democratic State Senator Richard Romero in a hotly contested race. Romero split the Democratic vote, and Richard J. Berry defeated Chavez 44% to 35% while Romero finished a distant third with 21%.

===Post-mayoral career===

====ICLEI====

In March 2010, Chávez, was appointed Executive Director of ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA. Chávez had served on ICLEI USA&#x27;s Board of Directors and was recognized nationally as a &quot;green mayor&quot; during his tenure in Albuquerque. Chavez leads a staff of 52 ICLEI USA employees, based in six regional offices: Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Oakland, and Seattle. In addition to these responsibilities Chávez also speaks at many conferences including George Mason University&#x27;s Washington Youth Summit on the Environment in 2011.

====Memberships====
Chavez serves on the Board of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF). Chávez is a member of the National Building Museum&#x27;s Intelligent Cities Advisory Committee and member of the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Vibrant Cities and Urban Forests Task Force. In March 2011, Chávez joined polar explorer and environmentalist Robert Swan, on an expedition to explore the effects of climate change in the Antarctica.

====2012 congressional election====

Chávez sought the Democratic nomination to succeed Martin Heinrich in the U.S. House, but lost to Bernalillo County Commissioner Michelle Lujan Grisham.

===Current Memberships===
Martin Chavez was named to a two-year term on the board of directors of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) in May 2013. He also on the board of directors of American Rivers. He is a former senior adviser to the Hispanic Technology and Telecommunications Partnership (HTTP), He is currently a senior adviser to Smart City Media, an Internet of Things company that merges interactive smart signs with mobile applications to deliver location-based media in real time, and to P3GM, a Smart Cities technology startup focusing on public-private partnerships in the smart cities arena. He is also a member of the board of directors of the Center for National Policy/Truman Security Project.

<text>The  (), or German Customs Union, was a coalition of German states formed to manage tariffs and economic policies within their territories. Organized by the 1833 treaties, it formally started on 1 January 1834. However, its foundations had been in development from 1818 with the creation of a variety of custom unions among the German states. By 1866, the included most of the German states. The Zollverein was not part of the German Confederation (1815-1866).

The foundation of the was the first instance in history in which independent states consummated a full economic union without the simultaneous creation of a political federation or union.

Prussia was the primary driver behind the creation of the customs union. Austria was excluded from the because of its highly protectionist trade policy, the unwillingness to split its customs territory into the separate Austrian, Hungarian and Galician-Lodomerian ones, as well as due to opposition of Prince von Metternich to the idea. By the founding of the North German Confederation in 1867, the covered states of approximately , and had produced economic agreements with several non-German states, including Sweden–Norway. After the founding of the German Empire in 1871, the Empire assumed the control of the customs union. However, not all states within the Empire were part of the until 1888 (Hamburg for example). Conversely, though Luxembourg was a state independent of the German Empire, it remained in the until 1919.

== Background ==


The splintering of territory and states over generations meant that by the 1790s in the German-speaking Holy Roman Empire in Central Europe, there were approximately 1800 customs barriers. Even within the Prussian state itself, there were, at the beginning of the 19th century, more than 67 local customs and tariffs, with as many customs borders. To travel from Königsberg in East Prussia to Cologne, for example, a shipment was inspected and taxed about 80 times. Each customs inspection at each border slowed the shipment&#x27;s progress from source to destination, and each assessment on the shipment reduced profit and increased the price of goods, dramatically stifling trade.

When France defeated the Second Coalition, made up of Russian, Austrian and German forces, and annexed territories up to the Rhine, there was a general consolidation of the myriad of tiny states in Germany in the Mediatization of 1803. This was also called the &quot;Principal Conclusion of the Extraordinary Imperial Delegation&quot; (or, in German, , usually called the ). This last piece of major legislation enacted by the Holy Roman Empire re-arranged the map of Central Europe, especially in the southwestern territories. The resulted in the secularization of many ecclesiastical territories, and the so-called &quot;mediatization&quot;, i.e. the annexation to larger neighboring territories, of many of the formerly free imperial territories, including most of the imperial cities. Considerable portions of the Habsburg family territories in southwestern Central Europe were &quot;mediatized&quot;, or given as compensation, to the princes and dukes who had lost territories in the French expansion. Most of the imperial cities, imperial abbeys, and ecclesiastical states and cities were mediatized or secularized in 1803. With the final dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, most of the remaining tiny principalities were annexed by larger neighbors.

Historians have analyzed three Prussian goals in the development of the : first, as a political tool to eliminate Austrian influence in Germany; second, as a way to improve the economies; and third, to strengthen Germany against potential French aggression while reducing the economic independence of smaller states. The created a larger market for German-made farm and handicraft products and promoted commercial unification under fiscally sound economic parameters. While the Union sought to limit trade and commercial barriers between and among member states, it continued to uphold the protectionist barriers against outsiders.

According to economic historian Florian Ploeckl, the commonly accepted view among economic historians is that Prussia was motivated to create &quot;Zollverein&quot; in order to achieve economies of scale in customs administration, thus leading to substantial fiscal savings.

== Initial efforts at a single-toll system ==

During the Napoleonic Era, efforts in the Rhineland toward economic unity had mixed success. The Confederation of the Rhine, and the other satellite creations of Napoleonic France, sought to establish autarky in European trade. By 1806, as Napoleon I sought to secure his hegemony in Europe, the Continental System offered a semblance of unified effort toward a widespread domestic market for European goods. However, the main purpose of the Continental System was military, not economic. Napoleon wanted a trade embargo against Britain, through which he hoped to wreck the British economy. The combination of war and isolation from Britain&#x27;s trading system destroyed markets for external raw materials and for manufactured goods, resulting in the near ruin of the Central European economy. Especially hard hit were the trading economies of the Lowlands and Rhineland states, which had relied heavily upon imports of raw materials from throughout the world, and on the export of finished products. The domestic markets in Central Europe were not large enough to sustain consumption of their own production. These problems were dramatically exacerbated by the numerous excise taxes and tolls which were the main source of state income. Reduction in trade meant the near bankruptcy of the smaller states.

At the Congress of Vienna in 1814 and 1815, diplomatsprincipally those from the Great Powersconfirmed the remapping of Europe, and broadly, the rest of the world, into spheres of influence. Central Europe, or German-speaking Europe, remained largely within the influence of the Austrian Habsburgs, balanced at the periphery by the Russian empire in the east, and the French in the west. Prussia was expected to play some role in these spheres of influence, but the ambiguities of the Austrian and Prussian relationship were unresolved. The German states retained autonomy; however, the old imperial institution of the &quot;Reichstag&quot; was converted to the form of a Confederation &quot;Diet,&quot; to meet in Frankfurt. The Habsburg archdukes, now Emperors of Austria, were to serve as permanent presidents of this institution. Isolated voices, such as Joseph Görres and Freiherr vom Stein, called for the abolition of domestic tolls and the creation of a German tariff on imports. The mandate from the Vienna Congress, however, established the German Confederation, but did not deal with the economic circumstances, nor did it make any effort to achieve economic and trade standardization. Instead, the articles that established the Confederation suggested that trade and transportation questions be discussed at a later date.

===Problems with unifying the customs and toll agreements===
Prussia and the central and southwestern states of Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Darmstadt, Württemberg, Baden, and Bavaria were leaders in the modernization of the toll system within the German states. In the Prussian case, the experience of the Confederation of the Rhine in removing customs barriers offered an example of how it could be done, and Hans, Count von Bülow, who until 1811 had been the Finance Minister in Westphalia, and who had accepted this position in 1813 in Prussia, modeled the Prussian customs statutes on those of the former states of the Confederation. The addition of territory to the existing Prussian state made elimination of customs barriers a powerful factor in Prussian politics. The significant differences between &quot;old&quot; Prussia and the newly acquired territories complicated the debate. The &quot;newer&quot; Prussian provinces in the Rhineland and Westphalia, with their developing manufacturing sectors, contended with the heavily agricultural territories of &quot;old&quot; Prussia. The dissimilarities in the two sides of Prussia confirmed regional perceptions for the need for their own political and administrative units, which became an important element of the customs debate. Within &quot;old&quot; Prussia itself, the customs statutes from 1818 reduced domestic customs barriers. After 1818, goods coming into Prussia and leaving Prussia were charged a high tariff. Goods moved freely within the state itself. The Prussian toll was therefore very simple and efficient. Manufactured goods were heavily taxed, especially textiles, and the most important taxes were for food, necessities and luxury goods.

Similarly, in the southwest German states, it became urgent to integrate the newly acquired territories into the states&#x27; existing economic systems. The territorial growth of the southwestern middle-sized states, in particular the two Hessian principalities, but also the growth of Baden and Württemberg, had split the territorial continuity of Prussia; the Prussian state was no longer linked entirely by territory, but rather was separated from many of its &quot;newer&quot; acquisitions by territories newly acquired by other states. These states often saw their own interests as conflicting generally and specifically with Prussian expansionism, and resented Prussian dominance and authority. Furthermore, these newly expanded states, usually referred as &quot;middle-sized states&quot; (or, in German, ), faced problems in integrating their newly acquired territories and populations into an existing political, economic and legal structure.

These problems were exacerbated by European wide economic woes following the Napoleonic Wars. Unemployment and high prices, especially for foodstuffs, characterized an economy not yet converted back to peacetime needs. The problem in Britain was particularly severe and the British response created a ripple effect that worsened problems in the German states: In trying to manage the post-war economy, the British government was caught between the Malthusian understanding of the relationship of wages, prices, and population, and the Ricardian model. On the one hand, adherents to the Malthusian model believed it was dangerous for Britain to rely on imported corn, because lower prices would reduce wages, and landlords and farmers would lose purchasing power. On the other hand, adherents to the Ricardian model thought that Britain could use its capital and population to advantage in a system of free trade. The problems in Britain established precedent for problems in the German states; the British limitation on grain imports, through the Corn Laws, blocked economic recovery in the German states, particularly in eastern Prussia, by limiting the amount of grain that could be imported into Britain. Not only did the Corn Laws keep the price of grain in Britain high, they undermined the viability of &quot;Junker&quot; producers in east Prussia, and limited their access to external markets.

The commercial reform efforts sponsored by Bavaria in 1856 led to the General German Commercial Code in 1861 that was quickly approved by a majority of the confederation. It proved highly successful in reducing barriers and increasing trade.

== 1820s and 1830s ==

At the close of the Napoleonic Wars, Germany was made up of 39 states, among them four city-states. Having abolished its own internal tariffs in 1818, Prussia began inviting individual states to eliminate tariffs, with the agreements setting the foundation for &quot;Zollverein&quot; cementing strong economic ties between the various Prussian and Hohenzollern territories, and ensuring economic contact between non-contiguous holdings of the Hohenzollern family, also the ruling family of Prussia. It was formed to remove the various obstacles (such as different weights and measures in German states) to economic exchange and growth by the new commercial classes, creating a national unity in economic matter at a time when Germany was divided.
Surmounting the domestic customs, and the individual states&#x27; dependence on those customs as their primary source of income, proved to be a difficult problem. The myriad of customs barriers restricted trade and hampered the industrial development, but the rulers of the states were reluctant to forgo their income from the customs. The impasse was overcome through external forces. With the repeal of the Continental System, the German tradesmen stood in direct conflict with the English industry. A united German Trade and Tradesmens Union demanded protection from English exports. Their spokesman, the economist Friedrich List, feared that the German people would end up as &quot;drawers of water and hewers of wood for Britain&quot;. Similarly, Karl Friedrich Nebenius, later president of the Ducal Ministry in the Grand Duchy of Baden and the author of Baden&#x27;s 1819 proposed customs initiative with the German Confederation, offered a widely publicized description about the difficulties of surmounting such protections:

In 1820, Württemberg planned to start a customs union among the so-called Third Germany: the middle-sized German states, including itself, Baden, Bavaria, and the two Hessian states (Hesse-Darmstadt and Hesse-Kassel). This customs union excluded both Austria and Prussia, primarily because the two major German powers were considered too overbearing. Plans foundered on the differing interests of the affected states. While the economic development in Baden proceeded relatively well, with its long borders and well entrenched infrastructure for trade, economic development in Bavaria lagged well behind it, and the Bavarian regime enacted a protective tariff on goods produced outside its border. The result was a short lived trade agreement between Baden and Hesse-Darmstadt. Nevertheless, a second agreement, reached in Stuttgart in 1825, established rapport between Württemberg and Bavaria, with the foundation of the South German Customs Union. In opposition to the Prussian activities, Hanover, Saxony, Hesse, and other states (Austria, France, Great Britain, and the Netherlands), developed their own economic agreements. While they promised one another not to join the Prussian union, they did develop trade agreements of their own. The Union remained unsuccessful, because it only sought to maintain the &quot;status quo&quot;, not to fix the problems created by toll barriers.

In 1834, Baden and Württemberg joined the Prussian union, which was renamed the German Customs Union. The &quot;Tax Union&quot; or Steuerverein was formed in 1834 as a customs union first of the Duchy of Brunswick and the Kingdom of Hanover, then with the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg in 1836. By 1835, the German Customs Union had expanded to include the majority of the states of the German Confederation, even Saxony, the Thuringian states, Württemberg and Baden, Bavaria, and the Hessian states. Functionally, it removed many internal customs barriers, while upholding a protectionist tariff system with foreign trade partners.

== Timeline ==

The original customs union was not ended in 1866 with outbreak of the Austro-Prussian War, but a substantial reorganization emerged in 1867. The new &quot;Zollverein&quot; was stronger, in that no individual state had a veto. When eventually Hamburg acceded to the Customs Union in 1888 it negotiated the exemption of an area of 4 square miles at the centre of its port, which remained outside of the &quot;Zollverein&quot;. Bremen (which includes Bremerhaven) had a similar agreement.

== Impact ==

=== Economic impact ===
According to one study, &quot;The &quot;Zollverein&quot; was the most important institutional development for Germany&#x27;s economic unification during the middle of the 19th century. It had a strong impact on regional development, changing regional fortunes by the opening and closing of markets.&quot;

=== Role in the unification of Germany ===
According to economic historians Helmut Böhme and H.-U. Wehler, the &quot;Zollverein&quot; set the groundwork for the unification of Germany under Prussian guidance. This traditional view is disputed by historians such as Hans-Joachim Voth who contend that far from allowing Prussia to increase its political influence over the smaller states, the customs union may have had the contrary effect: many governments used the increased revenue brought by the customs union to try to consolidate their independence. The smaller states entered the customs union for purely fiscal reasons, and as the events of 1866 were to demonstrate, membership in the &quot;Zollverein&quot; did not in the least lead to any form of political commitment toward Berlin, as many states remained suspicious of Prussia and generally pro-Austrian.

The impact of the &quot;Zollverein&quot; on German unification may have been more incidental because it never intended to be a political platform but focused on the economy. As it constituted the main feature of Berlin&#x27;s &quot;German policy&quot; for many years, Prussian ministers and other government officials became accustomed to think in terms of Germany as a whole and to look beyond specifically Prussian benefits when looking for a consensus across Germany.

According to revisionist historians, the &quot;Zollverein&quot; may not even have been instrumental in bringing about Prussia&#x27;s economic preeminence in Germany. They argue that nothing seems to indicate that industrial investments increased decisively during the period in Prussia, or that the customs union played a significant role in reducing the dominance of agriculture in the kingdom&#x27;s economy.

=== In literature ===

In 1840 the poet August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben published, in his &quot;Unpolitische Lieder&quot;, a song entitled &quot;Der deutsche Zollverein&quot; which ironically compares the economic advantages of a customs union to the political unity which the German Confederation had failed to achieve.

<text>University of Mumbai (formerly known as University of Bombay) is a public state university in Mumbai. It is one of the largest university systems in the world with over 549,000 students on its campuses and affiliated colleges. , the university had 711 affiliated colleges. 

It was established in 1857 following a dispatch from Sir Charles Wood, President of the Board of Control, to Governor-General Lord Dalhousie. There are courses available covering science, commerce and the arts.

== History ==
Wood&#x27;s despatch, drafted by Sir Wood in 1854, advocated a range of educational reforms in India, including the establishment of universities in major Indian cities. As such, the University of Bombay was established in 1857 after the presentation of a petition from the Bombay Association to the imperial Government of India. The University of Mumbai was modelled on similar universities in the United Kingdom, specifically the University of London.

The first departments established were the Faculty of Arts at Elphinstone College in 1835 and the Faculty of Medicine at Grant Medical College in 1845. Both colleges existed before the university was founded and surrendered their degree-granting privileges to the university. The first degrees awarded in 1862 were Bachelor of Arts and Licentiate in Medicine. Medical schools such as Sindh Medical School in Hyderabad, Sindh were affiliated with the university as well.

Cornelia Sorabji, who later studied law at Somerville College becoming Oxford&#x27;s first female law student and India&#x27;s first female advocate, was the university&#x27;s first female graduate in 1888.

Until 1904, the university only conducted examinations, awarded affiliations to colleges, developed curricula, and produced guidelines for colleges developing curricula. Teaching departments, research disciplines, and post-graduate courses were introduced from 1904, and several additional departments were established. After India achieved independence in 1947, the functions and powers of the university were reorganized under The Bombay University Act of 1953. The name of the university was changed from University of Bombay to University of Mumbai in 1996.

In 1949, student enrolment was 42,272 with 80 affiliated colleges. By 1975, these numbers had grown to 156,190 and 114 respectively.

===Kalina Campus===
Examination processes were made more efficient by the introduction of online delivery of question papers for examinations, and assessment of answer books by scanning at remote examination centres. The academic depository of the university was started in collaboration with CDSL in 2015. The university is the first university in the country to start an academic depository.

===Library===

====Rajabai Clock Tower====

One of Mumbai&#x27;s landmarks, the Rajabai Clock Tower, was completed in the 1870s and houses the University of Mumbai&#x27;s library. Sir George Gilbert Scott modeled the Rajabai Clock Tower on the clock tower of the Palace of Westminster in London. Local businessman Premchand Roychand contributed to the cost of construction and named the tower in memory of his mother, Rajabai. The tower is tall and has five storeys. At a height of from the ground, there are eight statues representing the Indian castes. The tower clock is reported to have played 16 tunes including &quot;Rule Britannia&quot;, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, &quot;Home! Sweet Home!&quot; and &quot;A Handel Symphony&quot;. On the initiative of the then Vice-Chancellor, Rajan Welukar, the first phase of restoration of Rajabai Clock Tower started in 2013 and was completed in May 2015. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) gave a Rs 4 crore grant for this phase of the restoration project.

=== Convocation Hall ===
==Affiliated colleges==
Its jurisdiction extends over 7 districts - Mumbai City district, Mumbai Suburban district, Palghar district, Raigad district, Ratnagiri district, Sindhudurg district, Thane district.

===Prominent institutes===
Several departments of the University of Mumbai are a part of vocational institutions and are not located on the four Mumbai campuses. These include the departments of Medicine and Medical Research located in many prominent hospitals in Mumbai, such as the Tata Memorial Hospital, Bombay Hospital and G.S. Medical College and King Edward Memorial Hospital. The Department of Medicine at Tata Memorial Hospital is now affiliated with the Homi Bhabha National Institute.

Institute of Chemical Technology (then known as the University Department of Chemical Technology, UDCT), was originally a department of MU, which later gained the status of a university.

Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, then known as the Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute, founded in 1887, was the first Engineering Institute of the University of Mumbai. Thadomal Shahani Engineering College was the first Engineering college in the University of Mumbai to start courses in Computer Engineering, Information Technology, Electronics Engineering and Biomedical Engineering.

==Libraries==
Jawaharlal Nehru Library (JNL) is the central library, located on the campus at Kalina. By May 2019, it was desperately in need of restoration, and it was said to have been in a dire state for the prior two years.

<doc id="501086" wikidata="Q1500337" url="?curid=501086" title="Speedrunning">
<text>Speedrunning is the act of playing a video game, or section of a video game, with the goal of completing it as fast as possible. Speedrunning often involves following planned routes, which may incorporate sequence breaking and exploit glitches that allow sections to be skipped or completed more quickly than intended. Tool-assisted speedrunning (TAS) is a subcategory of speedrunning that uses emulation software or additional tools to create a precisely controlled sequence of inputs.

Many online communities revolve around speedrunning specific games; community leaderboard rankings for individual games form the primary competitive metric for speedrunning. Racing between two or more speedrunners is also a popular form of competition. Videos and livestreams of speedruns are shared via the internet on media sites such as YouTube and Twitch. Speedruns are sometimes showcased at marathon events, which are gaming conventions that feature multiple people performing speedruns in a variety of games.

== History ==
===Early examples===

Speedrunning has generally been an intrinsic part of video games since the early days of the medium, similar to the chasing of high scores, though it did not achieve broad interest until 1993. Some groundwork for what would become modern speedrunning was established by id Software during the development for &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; (1992), although prior games such as &quot;Metroid&quot; (1986) and &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; (1989) encouraged speedrunning by noting a player&#x27;s time upon meeting certain metrics, including completion of the game. &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; recorded a &quot;par time&quot; statistic which was based on John Romero&#x27;s personal records for each level. Romero&#x27;s best level times were also printed in the official hint book, which was available via the same mail-order system used to distribute the game at the time. His intention was that players would attempt to beat his times.

=== &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot; demos, early Internet communities ===
The development of a strong speedrunning community is considered to have originated with the 1993 computer game &quot;Doom&quot;. The game retained the &quot;par time&quot; mechanic from &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; and included a feature that allowed players to record and play back gameplay using files called &quot;demos&quot; (also known as game replays). Demos were lightweight files that could be shared more easily than video files on Internet bulletin board systems at the time. Internally, in January 1994, University of Waterloo student Christina Norman created a File Transfer Protocol server dedicated to compiling demos, named the LMP Hall of Fame (after the .lmp file extension used by &quot;Doom&quot; demos). The LMP Hall of Fame inspired the creation of the Doom Honorific Titles by Frank Stajano, a catalogue of titles that a player could obtain by beating certain challenges in the game. The &quot;Doom&quot; speedrunning community emerged in November 1994, when Simon Widlake created COMPET-N, a website hosting leaderboards dedicated to ranking completion times of &quot;Doom&quot;&#x27;s single-player levels. 

In 1996, id Software released &quot;Quake&quot; as a successor to the &quot;Doom&quot; series. Like its predecessor, &quot;Quake&quot; had a demo-recording feature and drew attention from speedrunners. In April 1997, Nolan &quot;Radix&quot; Pflug created Nightmare Speed Demos (NSD), a website for tracking &quot;Quake&quot; speedruns. In June 1997, Pflug released a full-game speedrun demo of &quot;Quake&quot; called &quot;Quake Done Quick&quot;, which introduced speedrunning to a broader audience. &quot;Quake&quot; speedruns were notable for their breadth of movement techniques, including &quot;bunny hopping,&quot; a method of gaining speed also present in future shooting games like &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; and &quot;Team Fortress&quot;. In April 1998, NSD merged with another demo-hosting website to create Speed Demos Archive.

=== Speed Demos Archive and video sharing ===
For five years, Speed Demos Archive hosted exclusively &quot;Quake&quot; speedruns, but in 2003 it published a 100% speedrun of &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; done by Pflug. Six months later, SDA began accepting runs from all games. Unlike its predecessor websites, SDA did not compile leaderboards for their games; they displayed only the fastest speedrun of each game. Until SDA&#x27;s expansion into games other than &quot;Quake&quot; in 2004, speedrun video submissions were primarily sent to early video game record-keeper Twin Galaxies. The videos were often never publicly released, creating verifiability concerns that SDA aimed to address. It was often impossible to determine what strategies had gone into setting these records, hindering the development of speedrunning techniques. Sites dedicated to speedrunning, including game-specific sites, began to establish the subculture around speedrunning. These sites were not only used for sharing runs but also to collaborate and share tips to improve times, leading to collaborative efforts to continuously improve speedrunning records on certain games.

In 2003, a video demonstrating a TAS of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; garnered widespread attention on the internet; many speedrunners cite this as their first introduction to the hobby. It was performed and published by a Japanese user named Morimoto. The video was lacking context to indicate that it was a TAS, so many people believed it to be an actual human performance. It drew criticism from viewers who felt &quot;cheated&quot; when Morimoto later explained the process by which he created the video and apologized for the confusion. In December 2003, after seeing Morimoto’s TAS, a user named Bisqwit created TASVideos (initially named NESVideos), a site dedicated to displaying tool-assisted speedruns.

The creation of video-sharing and streaming websites in the late 2000s and early 2010s contributed to an increase in the accessibility and popularity of speedrunning. In 2005, the creation of YouTube enabled speedrunners to upload and share videos of speedruns and discuss strategies on the SDA forums. Twitch, a livestreaming website centered around video gaming, was launched in 2011. The advent of livestreaming made for easier verification and preservation of speedruns, and some speedrunners believe it is responsible for a shift towards collaboration among members of the community. In 2014, &quot;Speedrun.com&quot; was created, which had less stringent submission guidelines than SDA and was intended to centralize speedrun leaderboards for many different games. Speedrunners&#x27; move towards using &quot;Speedrun.com&quot; and social media platforms like Skype and Discord contributed to SDA&#x27;s relevance waning in the 2010s.

== Methodology ==
=== Gameplay strategies ===

Routing is a fundamental process in speedrunning. Routing is the act of developing an optimal sequence of actions and stages in a video game. A route may involve skipping one or more important items or sections. Skipping a part of a video game that is normally required for progression is referred to as &quot;sequence breaking&quot;, a term first used in reference to the 2002 action-adventure game &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;. Video game glitches may be used to achieve sequence breaks, or may be used for other purposes such as skipping cutscenes and increasing the player&#x27;s speed or damage output. Some people, called &quot;glitch-hunters&quot;, choose to focus on finding glitches that will be useful to speedrunners. In some games, arbitrary code execution exploits may be possible, allowing players to write their own code into the game&#x27;s memory. Several speedruns use a &quot;credits warp&quot;, a category of glitch that causes the game&#x27;s credits sequence to play, which may require arbitrary code execution. The use of glitches and sequence breaks in speedruns was historically not allowed, per the rules of Twin Galaxies&#x27; early leaderboards. When speedrunning moved away from Twin Galaxies towards independent online leaderboards, their use became increasingly common.

=== Tool-assisted speedruns ===

A tool-assisted speedrun (TAS) is a speedrun that uses emulation software and tools to create a &quot;theoretically perfect playthrough&quot;. According to TASVideos, common examples of tools include advancing the game frame by frame to play the game more precisely, retrying parts of the run using savestates, and hex editing. These tools are designed to remove restrictions imposed by human reflexes and allow for optimal gameplay. The run is recorded as a series of controller inputs intended to be fed back to the game in sequence. Although generally recorded on an emulator, TASes can be played back on original console hardware by sending inputs into the console&#x27;s controller ports, a process known as console verification (as some exploits are possible on emulation but not console). To differentiate them from tool-assisted speedruns, unassisted speedruns are sometimes referred to as &quot;real-time attack&quot; (RTA) speedruns. Due to the lack of a human playing the game in real time, TASes are not considered to be in competition with RTA speedruns.

=== Categorization and ranking ===
Speedruns are divided into various categories that impose additional limitations on a runner. It is common for category restrictions to require a certain amount of content to be completed in the game. Each video game may have its own speedrun categories, but some categories are popular irrespective of game. The most common are:

* &quot;Any%&quot;, which involves getting to the end as fast as possible with no qualifier, 
* &quot;100%,&quot; which requires full completion of a game. This may entail obtaining all items or may use some other metric.
* &quot;Low%&quot;, the opposite of 100%, which requires the player to beat the game while completing the minimum amount possible.
* &quot;Glitchless&quot;, which restricts the player from performing any glitches during the speedrun.
* &quot;No Major Glitches&quot;, Which consist of beating the game as fast as possible while not using any &quot;game breaking&quot; glitches.
Speedrunners compete in these categories by ranking times on online leaderboards. According to &quot;Wired&quot;, the definitive website for speedrun leaderboards is &quot;Speedrun.com&quot;. the site hosts leaderboards for over 20,000 video games. Runners usually record footage of their speedruns for accurate timing and verification, and may include a timer in their videos. They often use timers that keep track of splits—the time between the start of the run and the completion of some section or objective. Verification is usually done by leaderboard moderators who review submissions and determine the validity of individual speedruns.

== Community ==
According to many speedrunners, community is an important aspect of the hobby. Matt Merkle, director of operations at Games Done Quick, says that speedrunners &quot;value the cooperation the community encourages,&quot; and many speedrunners have said that their mental health has improved because of their involvement in the community. Erica Lenti, writing for &quot;Wired,&quot; said a sense of community is vital to speedrunning because it motivates players and aids in the development of routes and tricks used in speedruns, and Milan Jacevic highlighted &quot;years of research&quot; and collective community efforts that contribute to world records.

Speedrunners use media-sharing sites like YouTube and Twitch to share videos and livestreams of speedruns. The speedrunning community is divided into many sub-communities focused on speedrunning specific games. These sub-communities can form their own independent leaderboards and communicate about their games using Discord. Many communities have used the centralized leaderboard hosting site &quot;Speedrun.com&quot; since its founding in 2014.

=== Marathons ===
Speedrunning marathons, a form of gaming convention, feature a series of speedruns by multiple speedrunners. While many marathons are held worldwide, the largest event is Games Done Quick, a semiannual marathon held in the United States. it has raised over $37 million for charity organizations since its inception in 2010. The largest marathon in Europe is the European Speedrunner Assembly, held in Sweden. Both events broadcast the speedruns on Twitch and raise money for various charity organizations. Speedruns at marathons are done in one attempt and often have accompanying commentary. Many people consider marathons to be important to runners and spectators in the speedrunning community. Peter Marsh, writing for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, says that the Games Done Quick events provide an inclusive space for women and the LGBTQ community in contrast to the related cultures of gaming and Twitch streaming. Alex Miller of &quot;Wired&quot; says the events have played an important role in connecting people and supporting international humanitarian organization Médecins Sans Frontières during the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Speedrun races ===
Races between two or more speedrunners are a common competition format. They require players to be skilled at recovering from setbacks during a speedrun because they cannot start over. Occasionally, races are featured at marathons; a 4-person &quot;Super Metroid&quot; race is a popular recurring event at Games Done Quick marathons. The Global Speedrun Association (GSA) have organized head-to-head tournaments for multiple games, including &quot;Celeste&quot;, &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, and &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot;. In 2019, GSA organized an in-person speedrun race event called PACE. Their efforts have drawn criticism from some speedrunners who believe that they &quot;undermine the community spirit&quot;, citing cash prizes as incentives to avoid collaboration with other speedrunners and ignore games without prize money. Video game randomizers—ROM hacks that randomly shuffle item locations and other in-game content—are popular for speedrun races as well. Tournaments and other events have been organized for randomizer races, and they have been featured at speedrun marathons.

== Cheating ==
=== Methods ===
==== Splicing ====
Splicing is by far the most popular cheating method in speedrunning. Here, a speedrun is not recorded continuously, as is usually the case, but instead composed of various video snippets recorded at different times, sometimes with gameplay stolen from TAS composers or legitimate players.

At SGDQ 2019, speedrunner &quot;ConnorAce&quot; used a spliced run to illegitimately claim the world record on &quot;Clustertruck&quot; for the &quot;NoAbility%&quot; category, depriving the legitimate record holder from being invited to the event. The run was treated with suspicion due to it not being submitted officially to speedrun.com, with the video being unlisted on YouTube prior to ConnorAce&#x27;s acceptance into SGDQ. In October 2019, ConnorAce&#x27;s run was exposed by the YouTube documentarian Apollo Legend.

In a typical case, splicing allows difficult segments to be repeated to perfection and edited together afterwards into one seemingly continuous effort, which can sometimes dramatically reduce the amount of time needed to grind out a comparable score. However, a spliced run is not considered cheating if it is announced to be a multi-segment run upon submission; for example, this community-made multi-segment compilation for &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;

==== TASbotting ====
When &#x27;TASbotting&#x27;, the player records their controller inputs as a tool-assisted run in an external device in order to then have this device reproduce the inputs on a real console. As with splicing, the inputs of individual segments can be combined and, as is usual for tool-assisted runs, inputs can be made frame by frame. As long as these inputs are authentic and seem realistic for a human being, such manipulations are much more difficult to detect in the resulting video product than splicing. If, on the other hand, a TAS is not outputted on the original hardware but, as usual, on emulators, it can sometimes be alleged from the resulting video that such auxiliary programs were used; additionally, some emulators never perfectly imitate the desired hardware, which can cause synchronization issues when replayed on a console.

==== Modifying the timer or playback speed ====
Modifying game timers, especially on computer games, is another common method to improve one&#x27;s recorded times. However, this is a very noticeable manipulation, especially in highly competitive areas, since the speedruns in the upper area of leaderboards are repeatedly analyzed by other players in order to check their legitimacy and playback reproducibility, including a temporal check known as &quot;retiming&quot;. This often reveals discrepancies between one&#x27;s recording time and a speedrun in the leaderboards. 

Another method, a variation of splicing, includes speeding up cutscenes or compressing transitional black space. Again, such methods are likely to be detected by a speedrun moderator, although some games, especially where PC speed can have an effect, may actually vary depending on hardware. 

Finally, another common cheating method is to play the game using frame-by-frame advancement or in slow motion, which is similar to normal tool-assisted speedrunning but without the ability to redo inputs. Playing in slow motion is often effective for games that require very precise movements. 

==== Modifying in-game files ====
While it is often possible to use traditional cheats such as a GameShark to increase character speed, strength, health, etc., such cheats are generally quite easy for an experienced moderator to detect, even when applied subtly. However, the modification of internal files to improve RNG can often be much more difficult to detect. 

One of the most infamous examples of file modification was several cheated runs by the speedrunner Dream in 2020, whose luck was considered so extreme in a series of &quot;Minecraft&quot; speedruns that they were considered exceedingly unlikely to have been done without cheating (with an approximately 1 in 20 sextillion chance of occurring, as estimated by Matt Parker from &quot;Numberphile&quot;) by both the moderators at &quot;Speedrun.com&quot; and various YouTubers, such as Karl Jobst and Matt Parker, whose videos on Dream gained a combined 5.7 million and 6.5 million views, respectively, as of January 2024. Dream later admitted to the runs being cheated about five months after his runs were rejected, although he claimed he did not know he was using a modified version of the game. Nearly two years later, the player who helped uncover Dream&#x27;s cheated runs, MinecrAvenger, was also found to be using similar luck manipulation in late 2022.

==== Lying about times ====
While all of the aforementioned methods are deceptive in nature, the simplest way of cheating is merely to lie about a time. One of the most infamous cases of this was done by Todd Rogers. Several of his records have come under scrutiny for being seemingly impossible or lacking sufficient proof. In 2002, Robert Mruczek, then chief referee at Twin Galaxies, officially rescinded Todd&#x27;s record time in &quot;Barnstorming&quot; after other players pointed out that his time of 32.04 seconds did not appear to be possible, even when the game was hacked to remove all obstacles. Upon further investigation, Twin Galaxies referees were unable to find independent verification for this time, having instead been relying on erroneous information from Activision.

As listed on the Twin Galaxies leaderboard until January 2018, Rogers&#x27;s record in the 1980 Activision game &quot;Dragster&quot; was a time of 5.51 seconds from 1982. At the time, Activision verified high scores by Polaroid. According to Rogers, after he submitted a photo of this time, he was called by Activision, who asked him to verify how he achieved such a score, because they had programmed a &#x27;perfect run&#x27; of the game and were unable to achieve better than a 5.54. The game&#x27;s programmer David Crane would later confirm that he had a vague recollection of programming test runs, but did not remember the results. In 2012, Todd received a Guinness World Record for the longest-standing video game score record, for his 1982 &quot;Dragster&quot; record. In 2017, a speedrunner named Eric &quot;Omnigamer&quot; Koziel disassembled the game&#x27;s code and concluded that the fastest possible time was 5.57 seconds. With a tick rate of 0.03 seconds, the record claim is two ticks faster than Omnigamer&#x27;s data and one tick faster than the reported Activision &#x27;perfect run&#x27;.

=== Cheat detection ===
In order to prevent most of these methods, some games require a video of the hands on the controller or keyboard (&quot;handcam&quot;), in addition to the screen recording, so that game-specific moderators in charge of authenticating a submission can ensure that the inputs are really done in the specified combination and by a human. Other methods include forensic audio analysis, which is a common method for detecting telltale signs of video splicing; this is why runs without high-quality audio streams are often rejected on speedrun boards.

Additional detection methods are the use of mathematics (as in the aforementioned Dream case) or human moderation of suspicious inputs (in games which record them such as &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;TrackMania&quot;). Cheat detection software created for &quot;TrackMania&quot; was used to analyze over 400,000 replays and isolate a handful of cheaters, leading to hundreds of world records being determined to have been cheated using slowdown tools. This included those of Burim &quot;riolu&quot; Fejza, who was signed to the eSports team Nordavind (now known as 00 Nation) before being dropped following the scandal.

<text>Gary Rand Graham (June 6, 1950 – January 22, 2024) was an American actor. With a career spanning five decades beginning in the 1970s in television and movies, he is perhaps best known for his starring role as Detective Matthew Sikes in the television series &quot;Alien Nation&quot; (1989–1990) and five subsequent &quot;Alien Nation&quot; television films (1994–1997), as well as his work in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, most notably the recurring role of Soval, the Vulcan ambassador to Earth in &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;.

== Biography and early career ==
Graham was born in Long Beach, California. One of his earliest roles was in the 1980 CBS miniseries &quot;Scruples&quot;, based on the Judith Krantz novel starring Lindsay Wagner. He was cast as a hitman on the television show &quot;Moonlighting&quot; co-starring opposite Bruce Willis. Graham played more than 38 TV roles and had been in more than 40 movies.

As a musician, Graham was in the bands The Gary Graham Garage Band, The Gary Graham Band and The Sons of Kirk.

Graham was also a contributor to Breitbart News.

Graham died from cardiac arrest in Spokane, Washington on January 22, 2024, at the age of 73.

==Later career==
=== Television ===
Graham starred in a 2008 television pilot styled after &quot;Sin City&quot; called &quot;Dead End City&quot;. He also appeared in the December 18, 1984 episode of &quot;Remington Steele&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Steele A Plot&quot; (season 3, episode 11), as Butch Bemis. 

As well as starring as Detective Matthew Sikes in the television series &quot;Alien Nation&quot; (1989–1990), he resumed this role in the TV movies &quot;Alien Nation: Dark Horizon&quot; (1994), &quot;Alien Nation: Body and Soul&quot; (1995), &quot;Alien Nation: Millennium&quot; (1996), &quot;Alien Nation: The Enemy Within&quot; (1996) and &quot;Alien Nation: The Udara Legacy&quot; (1997).

Graham starred on &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; as the recurring character Ambassador Soval, a Vulcan ambassador to Earth. He also guest-starred on &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; (1995) once, playing Ocampan community leader Tanis in the second-season episode &quot;Cold Fire&quot;. He played Ragnar in the fan production &quot;Star Trek: Of Gods and Men&quot; and continued that role in &quot;Star Trek: Renegades&quot;.

In 2015, Graham reprised his role as Ambassador Soval, in the fan film &quot;Star Trek: Axanar&quot;.

=== Film ===
Graham&#x27;s film appearances include &quot;Hardcore&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Knights&quot;, &quot;All the Right Moves&quot;, &quot;The Arrogant&quot;, &quot;The Last Warrior&quot;, &quot;Robot Jox&quot;, &quot;Running Woman&quot; and &quot;Siren&quot;. His most recent films are &quot;InAlienable&quot;, &quot;Action Hero&quot; and &quot;Dreams Awake&quot;. He made his directorial debut in the spring of 2008 with the film &quot;Interviews,&quot; which he also wrote.

=== Web-based work ===
Graham also made appearances as the &quot;Smoking Jacket Guy&quot; in the introduction and other scenes in the Internet gaming show &quot;The Jace Hall Show&quot;. Graham played Dr. David Macavoy in the web series &quot;Universal Dead&quot;. In late June 2010, it was announced that &quot;Universal Dead&quot; will be made into a feature film.

<doc id="501101" wikidata="Q21100804" url="?curid=501101" title="Clathrin">
<text>Clathrin is a protein that plays a role in the formation of coated vesicles. Clathrin was first isolated by Barbara Pearse in 1976. It forms a triskelion shape composed of three clathrin heavy chains and three light chains. When the triskelia interact they form a polyhedral lattice that surrounds the vesicle. The protein&#x27;s name refers to this lattice structure, deriving from Latin &quot;clathri&quot; meaning lattice. Barbara Pearse named the protein clathrin at the suggestion of Graeme Mitchison, selecting it from three possible options. Coat-proteins, like clathrin, are used to build small vesicles in order to transport molecules within cells. The endocytosis and exocytosis of vesicles allows cells to communicate, to transfer nutrients, to import signaling receptors, to mediate an immune response after sampling the extracellular world, and to clean up the cell debris left by tissue inflammation. The endocytic pathway can be hijacked by viruses and other pathogens in order to gain entry to the cell during infection.

== Structure ==


The clathrin triskelion is composed of three clathrin heavy chains interacting at their C-termini, each ~190 kDa heavy chain has a ~25 kDa light chain tightly bound to it. The three heavy chains provide the structural backbone of the clathrin lattice, and the three light chains are thought to regulate the formation and disassembly of a clathrin lattice. There are two forms of clathrin light chains, designated a and b. The main clathrin heavy chain, located on chromosome 17 in humans, is found in all cells. A second clathrin heavy chain gene, on chromosome 22, is expressed in muscle.

Clathrin heavy chain is often described as a leg, with subdomains, representing the foot (the N-terminal domain), followed by the ankle, distal leg, knee, proximal leg, and trimerization domains. The N-terminal domain consists of a seven-bladed β-propeller structure. The other domains form a super-helix of short alpha helices. This was originally determined from the structure of the proximal leg domain that identified and is composed of a smaller structural module referred to as clathrin heavy chain repeat motifs. The light chains bind primarily to the proximal leg portion of the heavy chain with some interaction near the trimerization domain. The β-propeller at the &#x27;foot&#x27; of clathrin contains multiple binding sites for interaction with other proteins.

When triskelia assemble together in solution, they can interact with enough flexibility to form 6-sided rings (hexagons) that yield a flat lattice, or 5-sided rings (pentagons) that are necessary for curved lattice formation. When many triskelions connect, they can form a basket-like structure. The structure shown, is built of 36 triskelia, one of which is shown in blue. Another common assembly is a truncated icosahedron. To enclose a vesicle, exactly 12 pentagons must be present in the lattice.

In a cell, clathrin triskelion in the cytoplasm binds to an adaptor protein that has bound membrane, linking one of its three feet to the membrane at a time. Clathrin cannot bind to membrane or cargo directly and instead uses adaptor proteins to do this. This triskelion will bind to other membrane-attached triskelia to form a rounded lattice of hexagons and pentagons, reminiscent of the panels on a soccer ball, that pulls the membrane into a bud. By constructing different combinations of 5-sided and 6-sided rings, vesicles of different sizes may assemble. The smallest clathrin cage commonly imaged, called a mini-coat, has 12 pentagons and only two hexagons. Even smaller cages with zero hexagons probably do not form from the native protein, because the feet of the triskelia are too bulky.

== Function ==

Clathrin performs roles in shaping rounded vesicles in the cytoplasm for intracellular trafficking. Clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) selectively sort cargo at the cell membrane, trans-Golgi network, and endosomal compartments for multiple membrane traffic pathways. After a vesicle buds into the cytoplasm, the coat rapidly disassembles, allowing the clathrin to recycle while the vesicle gets transported to a variety of locations.

Adaptor molecules are responsible for self-assembly and recruitment. Two examples of adaptor proteins are AP180 and epsin. AP180 is used in synaptic vesicle formation. It recruits clathrin to membranes and also promotes its polymerization. Epsin also recruits clathrin to membranes and promotes its polymerization, and can help deform the membrane, and thus clathrin-coated vesicles can bud. In a cell, a triskelion floating in the cytoplasm binds to an adaptor protein, linking one of its feet to the membrane at a time. The triskelion foot will bind to other ones attached to the membrane to form a polyhedral lattice, triskelion foot, which pulls the membrane into a bud. The foot does not bind directly to the membrane, but binds to the adaptor proteins that recognize the molecules on the membrane surface.

Clathrin has another function aside from the coating of organelles. In non-dividing cells, the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles occurs continuously. Formation of clathrin-coated vesicles is shut down in cells undergoing mitosis. During mitosis, clathrin binds to the spindle apparatus, in complex with two other proteins: TACC3 and ch-TOG/CKAP5. Clathrin aids in the congression of chromosomes by stabilizing kinetochore fibers of the mitotic spindle. The amino-terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain and the TACC domain of TACC3 make the microtubule binding surface for TACC3/ch-TOG/clathrin to bind to the mitotic spindle. The stabilization of kinetochore fibers requires the trimeric structure of clathrin in order to crosslink microtubules.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) regulates many cellular physiological processes such as the internalization of growth factors and receptors, entry of pathogens, and synaptic transmission. It is believed that cellular invaders use the nutrient pathway to gain access to a cell&#x27;s replicating mechanisms. Certain signalling molecules open the nutrients pathway. Two chemical compounds called Pitstop 1 and Pitstop 2, selective clathrin inhibitors, can interfere with the pathogenic activity, and thus protect the cells against invasion. These two compounds selectively block the endocytic ligand association with the clathrin terminal domain in vitro. However, the specificity of these compounds to block clathrin-mediated endocytosis has been questioned. In later studies, however, the specificity of Pitstop 2 was validated as being clathrin dependent.

<doc id="501118" wikidata="Q1309121" url="?curid=501118" title="Hermit kingdom">
<text>The term hermit kingdom is an epithet used to refer to any country, organization or society that willfully isolate itself off, either metaphorically or physically, from the rest of the world. The Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (North Korea) is commonly cited as a prominent example of a hermit kingdom in the present day.

==Historic use: Korea==
The first country to be described as a &quot;hermit kingdom&quot; was Korea during the Joseon dynasty, in William Elliot Griffis&#x27;s 1882 book &quot;Korea: The Hermit Nation&quot;.
Korea, which had become increasingly isolationist since the 17th century, was frequently described as a hermit kingdom until 1905, when it became a protectorate of Japan.

== Cold War uses ==
During the Cold War, Enver Hoxha&#x27;s Albania was widely considered a &quot;hermit kingdom&quot; as it was a Stalinist regime, did not allow ordinary citizens out of the country, and pursued autarky to become entirely self-sufficient. Unlike North Korea, Hoxha&#x27;s regime, after the Sino-Albanian split, refused to ally with anyone and was hostile towards the entire world, which made it more isolationist than North Korea, which was then Stalinist but was allied with other Eastern Bloc states and did not become isolationist until after the end of the Cold War.

== Modern use ==
Today, the term is often applied to North Korea in news and social media, and in 2009, it was used by Hillary Clinton, then the United States Secretary of State.
Other current countries considered isolationist &quot;hermit kingdoms&quot; include Turkmenistan,
Belarus,
Eritrea,
and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
Historically, the term has been applied to Nepal,
Ladakh,
and Bhutan
in the Himalayas.

== Other uses ==
The term &quot;hermit kingdom&quot; has also been used to describe Western Australia when it closed its borders during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>This is a list of cities and towns in [[Niger]]. All larger cities are also Communes of Niger. While often translated as &quot;town&quot;, Nigerien communes are simply the third level administrative subdivision of the nation. These can be classified &quot;Urban&quot; or &quot;Rural&quot; communes, and while often the administrative unit of a town or city, all areas of the country fall within a commune. Smaller towns and neighborhoods are designated &quot;Quarters&quot; (Urban) or &quot;Villages&quot; (Rural).

<doc id="501123" wikidata="Q26961357" url="?curid=501123" title="Electronic voting in India">
<text>Electronic voting is the standard means of conducting elections using Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in India. The system was developed for the Election Commission of India by state-owned Electronics Corporation of India and Bharat Electronics. Starting in the late 1990s, they were introduced in Indian elections in a phased manner.

Prior to the introduction of electronic voting, paper ballots were used and manual counting was done. The printed paper ballots were expensive, required substantial post-voting resources and time to count individual ballots and were prone to fraudulent voting with pre-filled fake ballots. Introduction of EVMs have brought down the costs significantly, reduces the time of counting to enable faster announcement of results and eliminated fraudulent practices due to safety features such as security locking, limits to rate of voting per minute and verification of thumb impressions. EVMs are stand-alone machines that use write once read many memory. They are self-contained, battery-powered and do not need any networking capability. They do not have any wireless or wired components that connect to the internet.

Various opposition parties at times have alleged faulty EVMs after they failed to defeat the incumbent. In 2011, the Supreme Court of India directed the Election Commission to include a paper trail to help confirm the reliable operation of EVMs. The Election Commission developed EVMs with voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) which was trialed in the 2014 Indian general election. After the 2019 ruling by the Supreme Court, EVMs with accompanying VVPAT are used in all the elections with a small percentage (2%) of the VVPATs verified to ensure the reliability before certifying the final results.

The Election Commission of India has also claimed that the machines, system checks, safeguard procedures, and election protocols are tamper-proof. To mitigate any doubts regarding the hardware, prior to the election day, a sample number of votes for each political party nominee are entered into each machine, in the presence of polling agents and at the end of this sample trial run, the votes counted and matched with the entered sample votes, to ensure that the machine&#x27;s hardware has not been tampered with, it is operating reliably and that there were no hidden votes pre-recorded in each machine.

== Background ==
Paper ballots were exclusively used during elections till the 1990s. With the paper ballots, substantial resources were required for printing, transportation, storage and counting of individual ballots. Paper ballots were prone to fraudulent voting and booth capturing, where party loyalists captured booths and stuffed them with pre-filled fake ballots. Since the late 1950s, there were multiple documented cases of such activities being reported and the problem grew between the 1950s and 1980s, becoming a serious and large scale problem in certain states and regions often accompanied with violence. In the late 1970s, Election Commission of India sought a solution for the issues which resulted in the development of electronic voting machines (EVM).

== History ==
=== Design and introduction ===
The idea of using an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) was proposed in 1977 and Electronics Corporation of India (ECIL) was tasked with the development of the same. A working model was evolved in 1979 and was showcased to various political parties in August 1980. Bharat Electronics (BEL) and ECIL were tasked with manufacturing EVMs. The EVMs were first trialed in May 1982 in the by-election to Paravur assembly constituency in Kerala in a limited number of polling stations. In a ruling on a case filed against the usage of EVMs in the by-election, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the Representation of People Act, 1951 and the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 specified the usage of paper ballots and forbade the use of any new methods including electronic voting. The court stated the manner in which the orders were issued for the use of EVMs was unconstitutional and the usage of any alternate means would require to be specified under the law. By the time of the verdict, EVMs had been used in several other elections and the court did not rule on the results of those elections.

=== Wider adoption ===
Post the court ruling, as there was no provision explicitly permitting the usage of EVMs, it was not deployed immediately. An amendment to the Representation of the People Act, 1951 which allowed the usage of EVMs, was passed by the Parliament of India in December 1988 and came into force in March 1989. In March 1992, changes were made to the Conduction of Election Rules, 1961 by the Government of India to permit the usage of electronic voting. The deployment was delayed as general consensus could not be reached with the political parties and other stakeholders on the usage of EVMs. In 1998, the machines were used on an experimental basis across 25 state assembly constituencies during the assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi. In May 2001, EVMs were used in all constituencies for the state assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Puducherry and West Bengal. In 2004, in the General Election, the EVMs were used in all 543 Parliamentary Constituencies for the first time. Since the time, all state assembly and parliamentary elections are held using the EVMs.

=== Further improvements ===
As it was possible to know how many people from a polling station exactly voted for a candidate, there was a probability that a winning candidate might show favoritism or hold a grudge on specific areas depending on the votes received. In order to mitigate the issue, a totaliser was developed in 2008, which was connected to several EVM units and displayed only the overall results instead of votes from individual machines.

After a consultation with the political parties in 2010, the Election Commission appointed an expert technical committee to study the feasibility of a voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) in EVMs as a measure of transparency. The committee was tasked with examining the possibility of displaying a printed paper to a voter which consisted of the symbol of the party to which the vote was cast. Based on the recommendation of the committee, a VVPAT system was developed and was put on field trials in 2011. In July 2011, trials were conducted at 175 polling booths in Ladakh, Thiruvananthapuram, Cherrapunjee, East Delhi and Jaisalmer to test the performance of the VVPAT system under various weather conditions.

VVPAT was further introduced on a trial basis in a by-poll at Noksen in Nagaland in September 2013. It was later used in various legislative elections and in eight Lok Sabha constituencies in 2014 Indian general election. Following a directive of the Supreme Court on 8 October 2013, the Election Commission of India introduced VVPATs along with EVMs in a phased manner. In 2019, the Supreme Court further directed that a small percentage (2%) of the VVPATs to be verified to ensure the reliability before the final results were certified.

== Design and technology ==
The EVM was designed by a team led by A.G. Rao and Ravi Poovaiah, professors at IIT Bombay. An EVM consists of two units, a control unit, and the ballot unit which are connected by a cable. The ballot unit facilitates the actual voting by a voter and consists of a ballot paper screen with the names of candidates and their symbols alongside labeled buttons, indicator lights and Braille signage. The control unit is responsible for the operational control of the ballot units, stores the vote counts and displays the results on LED displays. The control unit is pre-programmed at the time of manufacturing and cannot be altered later.

The machines are powered by a 7.5 volt battery inserted into the control unit. The designers intentionally opted for battery power, to prevent the possibility of power cables interfering with the functioning and the EVMs can function without a secondary power source. The two units work in tandem and cannot work independently. The EVMs do not have any communication components or internet interface. The ballot unit has an internal clock and a pre-programmed protocol by which it records every input-output event with a timestamp provided it is powered.

A single ballot unit can list a maximum of 16 candidates and as a part of the initial design, up to four ballot units could be connected in parallel to a single control unit to cater to a maximum of 64 candidates. After an upgrade in 2013, 24 ballot units can now be connected to a single unit so that it can cater to a maximum of 384 candidates. A single machine can record a maximum of 2000 votes. The devices were designed to prevent fraud by limiting the number of new votes can be entered into the machine in a given time frame. In a minute, the EVMs can register a maximum of five votes. The later version of the EVMs are all equipped with VVPAT capability. VVPAT system which was an upgrade of the EVMs had modified software that allowed a printer to be attached to the machine. In June 2018, a built-in-hood was added to protect the printer and other devices from excess light and heat in VVPAT systems.

== Usage ==
The EVMs are inventoried and stored at secure locations when not in use. They are tracked by the Election Commission of India on a real-time basis and distributed randomly to the polling booths. In 2017, the Election Commission decided to replace all first generation machines and most of the machines in use in 2024 belong to the third generation. Prior to the elections, the machines are randomly allocated to polling booths and sample checks are carried out to ensure working condition. Ballot papers are inserted into the displays in the ballot unit and test votes for each nominee is entered into the machine in the presence of polling agents and counted to match with the entered sample votes.

Before the voting, the control units are sealed. The control unit is operated by the polling booth officer, while the ballot unit is operated by the voter in privacy. The officer confirms the voter&#x27;s identification before electronically activating the ballot unit to accept a new vote. Once the voter enters the vote, the ballot unit displays the vote to the voter and records it in its memory. Post the voting, the polling officer presses the close button and the control unit registers the polled votes. The units are identified by unique identifier numbers and the a particular control unit is designed to work with a specific ballot unit. Once the polling process is completed, the votes are recorded in the device&#x27;s memory on the same order of polling and the device&#x27;s ability to accept additional votes is disabled. The control unit can store the vote in its memory for more than ten years. With the VVPAT system, when a vote is cast, it is recorded in its memory and simultaneously a serial number and vote data is printed out for the voter to verify the same. The Election Commission maintains a database of thumb impressions and signatures of the voters along with identification, which is matched in order to identify the eligibility of a voter and ensure that a voter cannot cast a ballot more than once.

After a poll closes on an election day, the Presiding officer will hand over an account of votes recorded in each machine to the polling agents of the political parties. The units are separated and the control units moved and stored separately in locked and guarded premises. At the time of counting of votes, the results are displayed on the control unit on pressing the &quot;Result&quot; button. The button cannot be pressed before the polling is closed by the polling officer-in-charge. It is usually hidden and is exposed only at the counting center in the presence of the designated officer. The total displayed will also be tallied with the count given on the polling day.

== Cost and efficiency ==
The manufacturing cost per EVM was for the first batch of machines that were purchased in 1989–90. The cost of the production of later models was estimated to be in 2006. The cost was estimated to be per unit based on an additional order placed in 2014. Though the design, production and procurement was capital intensive, it has helped reduce the cost incurred on the printing of ballot papers, their transportation and storage and the counting staff and the remuneration paid to them. EVMs are easier to transport compared to ballot boxes as they are lighter, more portable, and come with polypropylene carrying cases. As there are reduced probability of malfeasance and rejection of votes, it eliminates the requirement of re-polling due to these issues. An independent study had also indicated that the voting by the economically weaker section have increased due to the ease of usage with EVMs. The shelf life of an EVM is estimated to be 15 years.

== Reliability ==
The use of EVMs and questions of their reliability have been raised by academics and politicians. In February 2010, an international conference held under the chairmanship of Subramanian Swamy blamed the Election Commission for shirking from its responsibility on proving the transparency of EVMs. In April 2010, an independent security analysis undertaken by Hari K. Prasad, Rop Gonggrijp, and Alex Halderman, found that the machines could be manipulated by people who have physical access to the machines. While manufacturing, people with access could insert malicious hardware and people with physical access between voting and counting could change vote totals or learn about the results earlier. It suggested moving to a voting system that provides greater transparency such as paper ballots, precinct count optical scan, or a voter verified paper audit trail for skeptical voters to observe the physical counting process to gain confidence that the outcome is fair. In August 2010, one of the authors of the research was charged with suspected EVM theft. A research from &quot;The Hindu&quot; shared similar concerns that the EVMs could be manipulated during manufacturing, storage during the non-election periods and service of the machines by authorised technicians. It further suggested the usage of paper trail for verification and the use of authentication units to check the devices for counterfeit or tampered units. 

In August 2017, EVMs from multiple countries were hacked by programmers at the EVM Hacking village at the 25th DEF CON conference held at Las Vegas. Indian made EVMs however, were not included as part of the event. In the same year, the Election Commission organized an open hackathon encouraging people to attempt hacking of EVMs used by the commission in various Indian elections. While the Commission announced that no attempts were made to demonstrate any vulnerabilities in the event, the registered participants claimed that the Commission made only a few select machines available and imposed additional conditions. In January 2019, a self proclaimed cyber expert based in London claimed that the results can be manipulated by using low frequency signals. The Election Commission however dismissed the allegations since the machines did not use wireless frequencies to communicate with other devices and no proof was provided by the expert to demonstrate the hacking of the devices.

The Election Commission and the manufacturers of the EVMs have consistently rejected the possibility of EVM tampering. They have maintained that the machines are tamper-proof as the programming is done at a secure manufacturing facility. They have also contended that there is no connecting or transmission devices attached to the machines and the machines are securely stored with a real-time logging system in the machine detecting any access or attempts to change. Concerns have also been raised on the software which could be tampered with during initial programming and could be programmed to register a particular button. The Commission responded that the buttons are interchangeable and the order of candidates is randomly selected.

There have been multiple cases against the usage of EVMs before the state high courts and the Supreme Court of India. The courts have often dismissed these cases and ruled in the favor of the Election Commission and the Supreme Court has declared that the use of EVMs is constitutionally valid. A PIL was filed in the Supreme Court in 2011 for directing the Election Commission to modify the EVMs to give a slip printed with the symbol of the party in whose favor the voter cast. On 17 January 2012, Delhi High Court in its ruling on Subramanian Swamy&#x27;s writ petition challenging the use of EVMs in the present form asked the Election Commission to hold wider consultations with the executive, political parties and other stakeholders on the matter. Following further petitions in the Supreme Court and the subsequent ruling in 2013 led to the use of VVPATs.

== Export to other countries ==
Nepal, Bhutan, Namibia and Kenya have acquired India-manufactured EVMs. In 2013, the Election Commission of Namibia acquired 1700 control units and 3500 ballot units from Bharat Electronics Limited and these units were used in the regional and presidential elections in 2014. Several other Asian and African countries have also expressed interested in using the Indian made EVMs.

<text>Lamins, also known as nuclear lamins are fibrous proteins in type V intermediate filaments, providing structural function and transcriptional regulation in the cell nucleus. Nuclear lamins interact with inner nuclear membrane proteins to form the nuclear lamina on the interior of the nuclear envelope. Lamins have elastic and mechanosensitive properties, and can alter gene regulation in a feedback response to mechanical cues. Lamins are present in all animals but are not found in microorganisms, plants or fungi. Lamin proteins are involved in the disassembling and reforming of the nuclear envelope during mitosis, the positioning of nuclear pores, and programmed cell death. Mutations in lamin genes can result in several genetic laminopathies, which may be life-threatening.

== History ==
Lamins were first identified in the cell nucleus, using electron-microscopy. However, they were not recognized as vital components of nuclear structural support until 1975. During this time period, investigations of rat liver nuclei revealed that lamins have an architectural relationship with chromatin and nuclear pores. Later in 1978, immunolabeling techniques revealed that lamins are localized at the nuclear envelope under the inner nuclear membrane. It wasn&#x27;t until 1986 that an analysis of lamin cDNA clones across a variety of species supported that lamins belong to the intermediate filament (IF) protein family. Further investigations found evidence that supports that all IF proteins arose from a common lamin-like ancestor. This theory is based on the observation that organisms that contain IF proteins necessarily contain lamins as well; however, the presence of lamins is not a requirement for simultaneously containing IF proteins. Furthermore, sequence comparisons between lamins and IF proteins support that an amino-acid sequence that is characteristic of lamins is found in early forms of IF proteins. This sequence is lost in later forms of IF proteins, suggesting that the structure of later intermediate filaments diverged. After this research, investigations of lamins slowed. Studies of lamins became more popular in the 1990s when it was discovered that mutations in the genes that code for lamins can be related to muscular dystrophies, cardiomyopathies, and neuropathies. Current research is being performed to develop treatment methods for the aforementioned laminopathies and to investigate the role lamins play in the aging process.

== Structure ==
The structure of lamins is composed of three units that are common among intermediate filaments: a central α-helical rod domain containing heptad repeats surrounded by globular N and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal is shorter and located at the top (head) while the C-terminal is longer and located at the end (tail). Lamins have a unique structure of the heptad repeats that is continuous in nature and contains an additional six heptads. While the head domain of lamins is fairly consistent, the composition of the tail domain varies based on the type of lamin. However, all C-terminal domains contain a nuclear localization sequence (NLS). Similar to other IF proteins, lamins self-assemble into more complex structures. The basic unit of these structures is a coiled-coil dimer. The dimers arrange themselves in a head-to-tail manner, allowing for the formation of a protofilament. As these protofilaments aggregate, they form lamin filaments. Lamins of higher level organisms, such as vertebrates, continue to assemble into paracrystalline arrays. These complex structures allow nuclear lamins to perform their specialized functions in maintaining the shape of the nucleus as well as roles during mitosis and apoptosis.

==A- and B-types==
Lamins are divided into two major categories: A- and B-types. These subdivisions are based on similarities in cDNA sequences, structural features, isoelectric points, and expression trends.

=== A-type lamins ===
A-type lamins are characterized by a neutral isoelectric point, and they are typically displayed during later stages of embryonic development. Expressed in differentiated cells, A-type lamins originate from the &quot;LMNA&quot; gene. Two isoforms, lamins A and C, can be created from this gene via alternative splicing. This creates a high amount of homology between the isoforms. Unlike lamin C, Lamin A is generated in a precursor form called prelamin A. Prelamin A and lamin C differ in structure only at the carboxyl-terminus. Here, prelamin A contains two extra exons that lamin C lacks. Furthermore, lamin C contains six unique amino-acid residues while prelamin A contains ninety-eight residues not found in the other isoform. A CaaX motif is found within the unique residues in prelamin A. Due to the presence of the CaaX motif, prelamin A undergoes a series of posttranslational modifications to become mature lamin A. These steps include farnesylation of the carboxyl-terminal cysteine, endoproteolytic release of the terminal amino acids, carboxymethalation of the accessible farnesylcysteine, and removal of the final fifteen residues by a zinc metalloprotease. The very first modification involving farnesylation of prelamin A is crucial to the development of mature lamin A. Isoform lamin C does not undergo posttranslational modifications. Some studies have demonstrated that lamins A and C are not required for the formation of the nuclear lamina, yet disruptions in the &quot;LMNA&quot; gene can contribute to physical and mental limitations.

=== B-type lamins ===
B-type lamins are characterized by an acidic isoelectric point, and they are typically expressed in every cell. As with A-type lamins, there are multiple isoforms of B-type lamins, the most common being lamin B1 and lamin B2. They are produced from two separate genes, &quot;LMNB1&quot; and &quot;LMNB2&quot;. Similar to prelamin A, B-type lamins also contain a CaaX motif at the carboxyl-terminus. This marker triggers the same sequence of posttranslational modifications previously described for prelamin A except for the final cleavage step involving a zinc metalloprotease. Further investigations of B-type lamins across multiple species have found evidence that supports that B-type lamins existed before A-type lamins. This stems from the similarity in structure of B-type lamins between invertebrates and vertebrates. Furthermore, organisms that only contain a single lamin contain a B-type lamin. Other studies that have investigated the structural similarities and differences between A- and B-type lamins have found that the positions of introns/exons in B-type lamins have been conserved in A-type lamins, with more variations in the A-type lamins. This suggests that the common ancestor of these lamin types was a B-type lamin.

==Function==

=== Maintenance of nuclear shape ===
Due to their properties as a type of IF protein, lamins provide support for maintaining the shape of the nucleus. They also play an indirect role in anchoring the nucleus to the endoplasmic reticulum, forming a continuous unit within the cell. This is accomplished by lamin and lamin-interacting proteins (SUN1/SUN2) connecting with proteins on the outer nuclear membrane. These proteins in turn interact with cytoskeletal elements of the endoplasmic reticulum, forming a strong complex that can withstand mechanical stress. Nuclei that lack lamins or have mutated versions have a deformed shape and do not function properly.

=== Mitosis ===
During mitosis, lamins are phosphorylated by Mitosis-Promoting Factor (MPF), which drives the disassembly of the lamina and the nuclear envelope. This allows chromatin to condense and the DNA to be replicated. After chromosome segregation, dephosphorylation of nuclear lamins by a phosphatase promotes reassembly of the nuclear envelope.

=== Apoptosis ===
Apoptosis is a highly organized process of programmed cell death. Lamins are crucial targets for this process due to their close associations with chromatin and the nuclear envelope. Apoptotic enzymes called caspases target lamins and cleave both A- and B-types. This allows chromatin to separate from the nuclear lamina in order to be condensed. As apoptosis continues, cell structures slowly shrink into compartmentalized &quot;blebs.&quot; Finally, these apoptotic bodies are digested by phagocytes. Studies of apoptosis involving mutant A- and B-type lamins that are resistant to cleavage by caspases show decreased DNA condensation and apoptotic “blebbing” formation, thereby underscoring the important role of lamins in apoptosis.

== Clinical significance ==
Mutations in the LMNA gene, encoding Lamins A and C, can produce a series of disorders ranging from muscular dystrophies, neuropathies, cardiomyopathies, and premature ageing syndromes. Collectively, these conditions are known as laminopathies.

===Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome===

One specific laminopathy is Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), characterized by premature ageing. Those affected by the condition appear normal at birth, but show signs of premature ageing including hair-loss, thinness, joint abnormalities, and weak motor skills as they develop. Furthermore, health problems usually seen in older persons such as atherosclerosis and high blood pressure occur at a much younger age. Those with HGPS typically die in their early teens, usually following a heart attack or stroke.

HGPS is caused by a point mutation in the &quot;LMNA&quot; gene that codes for lamin A. The genetic alteration results in an alternative splice, creating a mutated form of prelamin A that is much shorter and lacks the cleavage site for a zinc metalloprotease. Because prelamin A cannot be properly processed during posttranslational modifications, it retains its lipid modification (farnesylation) and remains in the inner nuclear membrane. This disrupts the mechanical stability of the nucleus, resulting in a higher rate of cell death and therefore a higher rate of aging. Current studies are investigating the effects of farnesyl-transferase inhibitors (FTIs) to see if farnesyl attachment can be inhibited during posttranslational modification of prelamin A in order to treat patients with HGPS.

=== Lamin A/C heart disease ===
Some laminopathies affect heart muscle. These mutations cause a spectrum of heart disease ranging from no apparent effect to severe dilated cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure. Laminopathies frequently cause heart rhythm problems at an early stage in the disease process including abnormally slow heart rhythms such as sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular block, and abnormally rapid heart rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia. As a result, those with Lamin A/C heart disease are often treated with pacemakers or implantable defibrillators in addition to medication.

Bruce Metzger, in his &quot;Textual Commentary on the Greek NT&quot;, comments on Matthew 10:3:

:&quot;The name &quot;Judas Zelotes&quot; in several Old Latin manuscripts (compare also the same name in the fifth century mosaic in the great Baptistry at Ravenna) may be a further assimilation to the previous name in Luke&#x27;s list, &quot;Simon who was called the Zealot.&quot;&quot;

<doc id="501128" wikidata="Q503207" url="?curid=501128" title="Honorius of Canterbury">
<text>Honorius (died 30 September 653) was a member of the Gregorian mission to Christianize the Anglo-Saxons from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism in 597 AD who later became Archbishop of Canterbury. During his archiepiscopate, he consecrated the first native English bishop of Rochester as well as helping the missionary efforts of Felix among the East Anglians. Honorius was the last to die among the Gregorian missionaries.

==Early life==
A Roman by birth, Honorius may have been one of those chosen by Pope Gregory the Great for the Gregorian mission to England, although it seems more likely that he was a member of the second party of missionaries, sent in 601. It is not known if his name was given to him at birth or if he chose it when he became archbishop.

==Archbishop==
In 627, Honorius was consecrated as archbishop by Paulinus of York at Lincoln. Honorius wrote to Pope Honorius I asking the pope to raise the see of York to an archbishopric, so that when one archbishop in England died, the other would be able to consecrate the deceased bishop&#x27;s successor. The pope agreed, and sent a pallium for Paulinus, but by this time, Paulinus had already been forced to flee from Northumbria. When Paulinus, after the death of King Edwin of Northumbria in October 633, fled Northumbria, he was received by Honorius and appointed to the bishopric of Rochester. The papal letter is dated to June 634, and implies that news of Edwin&#x27;s death had not reached the pope. This evidence may mean that the traditional date of Edwin&#x27;s death may need to be moved to October 634. The papal letter may also mean that the traditional date of consecration for Honorius may need re-dating, as the long gap between 627, when he is said to have been consecrated, and 634, when he finally received a pallium, is much longer than usually found. It may be that Honorius was consecrated closer to 634. The papal letter to Honorius is given in the &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; of the medieval writer Bede.

Honorius consolidated the work of converting the English by sending Felix, a Burgundian, to Dunwich after Felix came to the archbishop and made known his desire to go to East Anglia as a missionary. Honorius may have consecrated Felix as the first bishop of East Anglia or Felix may have already been consecrated on the continent. The dating of this episode is unclear, but it is probably close to 631. It is possible that King Sigeberht of East Anglia, who converted to Christianity while he was in exile on the continent, had already met Felix and was behind Felix&#x27;s journey to Honorius. As well as his help to Felix, Honorius consecrated the first Anglo-Saxon bishop, Ithamar of Rochester, and his successor was also a native of England.

Honorius had few conflicts with the Irish missionary efforts, and admired Aidan, one of the leading Irish clergy.

==Death and legacy==

Honorius died on 30 September 653, the last of the Gregorian missionaries. He was buried at the Church of St Augustine in Canterbury. He was later revered as a saint, with his feast day being 30 September. His relics were translated to a new tomb in 1091, and around that same time a hagiography of his life was written by Goscelin. In the 1120s his relics were still being venerated at St Augustine&#x27;s.

<doc id="501136" wikidata="Q827450" url="?curid=501136" title="Hepatocyte">
<text>A hepatocyte is a cell of the main parenchymal tissue of the liver. Hepatocytes make up 80% of the liver&#x27;s mass.
These cells are involved in:
* Protein synthesis
* Protein storage
* Transformation of carbohydrates
* Synthesis of cholesterol, bile salts and phospholipids
* Detoxification, modification, and excretion of exogenous and endogenous substances
* Initiation of formation and secretion of bile

==Structure==
The typical hepatocyte is cubical with sides of 20-30 μm, (in comparison, a human hair has a diameter of 17 to 180 μm). The typical volume of a hepatocyte is 3.4 x 10−9 cm3.
Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is abundant in hepatocytes, in contrast to most other cell types.

===Microanatomy===
Hepatocytes display an eosinophilic cytoplasm, reflecting numerous mitochondria, and basophilic stippling due to large amounts of rough endoplasmic reticulum and free ribosomes. Brown lipofuscin granules are also observed (with increasing age) together with irregular unstained areas of cytoplasm; these correspond to cytoplasmic glycogen and lipid stores removed during histological preparation. The average life span of the hepatocyte is 5 months; they are able to regenerate.

Hepatocyte nuclei are round with dispersed chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Anisokaryosis (or variation in the size of the nuclei) is common and often reflects tetraploidy and other degrees of polyploidy, a normal feature of 30-40% of hepatocytes in the adult human liver. Binucleate cells are also common.

Hepatocytes are organised into plates separated by vascular channels (sinusoids), an arrangement supported by a reticulin (collagen type III) network. The hepatocyte plates are one cell thick in mammals and two cells thick in the chicken. Sinusoids display a discontinuous, fenestrated endothelial cell lining. The endothelial cells have no basement membrane and are separated from the hepatocytes by the space of Disse, which drains lymph into the portal tract lymphatics.

Kupffer cells are scattered between endothelial cells; they are part of the reticuloendothelial system and phagocytose spent erythrocytes. Stellate (Ito) cells store vitamin A and produce extracellular matrix and collagen; they are also distributed amongst endothelial cells but are difficult to visualise by light microscopy.

==Function==
===Protein synthesis===
The hepatocyte is a cell in the body that manufactures serum albumin, fibrinogen, and the prothrombin group of clotting factors (except for Factors 3 and 4).

It is the main site for the synthesis of lipoproteins, ceruloplasmin, transferrin, complement, and glycoproteins.
Hepatocytes manufacture their own structural proteins and intracellular enzymes.

Synthesis of proteins is by the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and both the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) are involved in secretion of the proteins formed.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is involved in conjugation of proteins to lipid and carbohydrate moieties synthesized by, or modified within, the hepatocytes.

Proteins produced by hepatocytes that function as hormones are known as hepatokines.

===Carbohydrate metabolism===

The liver forms fatty acids from carbohydrates and synthesizes triglycerides from fatty acids and glycerol.
Hepatocytes also synthesize apoproteins with which they then assemble and export lipoproteins (VLDL, HDL).

The liver is also the main site in the body for gluconeogenesis, the formation of carbohydrates from precursors such as alanine, glycerol, and oxaloacetate.

===Lipid metabolism===
The liver receives many lipids from the systemic circulation and metabolizes chylomicron remnants.
It also synthesizes cholesterol from acetate and further synthesizes bile salts.
The liver is the sole site of bile salts formation.

===Detoxification===
Hepatocytes have the ability to metabolize, detoxify, and inactivate exogenous compounds such as drugs (see drug metabolism), insecticides, and endogenous compounds such as steroids.

The drainage of the intestinal venous blood into the liver requires efficient detoxification of miscellaneous absorbed substances to maintain homeostasis and protect the body against ingested toxins.

One of the detoxifying functions of hepatocytes is to modify ammonia into urea for excretion.

The most abundant organelle in liver cells is the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

===Aging===
As mammalian liver cells age, damages in their DNA increase in prevalence. A review of the literature indicated that in mouse liver cells DNA damages (single-strand breaks, oxidized bases and 7-methylguanine) increase with age. Also, in rat liver, DNA single- and double-strand breaks, oxidized bases, and methylated bases increase with age; and in rabbit liver, cross-linked bases increase with age. Liver cells depend on DNA repair pathways that specifically protect the transcribed compartment of the genome to promote sustained functionality and cell preservation with age.

==Society and culture==
===Use in research===
Primary hepatocytes are commonly used in cell biological and biopharmaceutical research. In vitro model systems based on hepatocytes have been of great help to better understand the role of hepatocytes in (patho)physiological processes of the liver. In addition, pharmaceutical industry has heavily relied on the use of hepatocytes in suspension or culture to explore mechanisms of drug metabolism and even predict in vivo drug metabolism.
For these purposes, hepatocytes are usually isolated from animal or human whole liver or liver tissue by collagenase digestion, which is a two-step process. In the first step, the liver is placed in an isotonic solution, in which calcium is removed to disrupt cell-cell tight junctions by the use of a calcium chelating agent. Next, a solution containing collagenase is added to separate the hepatocytes from the liver stroma. This process creates a suspension of hepatocytes, which can be seeded in multi-well plates and cultured for many days or even weeks. For optimal results, culture plates should first be coated with an extracellular matrix (e.g. collagen, Matrigel) to promote hepatocyte attachment (typically within 1-3 hr after seeding) and maintenance of the hepatic phenotype. In addition, and overlay with an additional layer of extracellular matrix is often performed to establish a sandwich culture of hepatocytes. The application of a sandwich configuration supports prolonged maintenance of hepatocytes in culture. Freshly-isolated hepatocytes that are not used immediately can be cryopreserved and stored. They do not proliferate in culture. Hepatocytes are intensely sensitive to damage during the cycles of cryopreservation including freezing and thawing. Even after the addition of classical cryoprotectants there is still damage done while being cryopreserved. Nevertheless, recent cryopreservation and resuscitation protocols support application of cryopreserved hepatocytes for most biopharmaceutical applications.

<text>Tahoua is a city in Niger and the administrative centre of the Department of Tahoua and the larger Tahoua Region. It is the fourth largest town in the country, with a population of 117,826 (2012 Census).

==Overview==
The city is primarily a market town for the surrounding agricultural area. It serves as an entrepot for Tuareg merchants from the north and Fulani traders from the south. The town is noted for its production of &quot;tchoukou&quot; cheese.

It is divided into a pair of urban municipalities: Tahoua I and Tahoua II. The town itself is divided into an old town area, and the Sabon Gari (&#x27;new town&#x27;) area to the north.

==History==
Tahoua began as a pair of small villages called Bilbis and Fakoua, and began growing from the 17th century on as various groups began migrating to the area, such as the Fulani and Tuareg. Various animist (or &quot;Azna&quot;) peoples began fleeing to the area to escape persecution from Muslim rulers further north. In 1990, Tahoua was reported to have the lowest HDI score in history, at 0.172.

== Demographics == 
Tahoua is mainly dominated by Fulani , and Tuareg ethnic groups. 
==Transport==
Tahoua is served by the Tahoua Airport.

<doc id="501158" wikidata="Q421987" url="?curid=501158" title="Intermediate filament">
<text>Intermediate filaments (IFs) are cytoskeletal structural components found in the cells of vertebrates, and many invertebrates. Homologues of the IF protein have been noted in an invertebrate, the cephalochordate &quot;Branchiostoma&quot;.

Intermediate filaments are composed of a family of related proteins sharing common structural and sequence features. Initially designated &#x27;intermediate&#x27; because their average diameter (10 nm) is between those of narrower microfilaments (actin) and wider myosin filaments found in muscle cells, the diameter of intermediate filaments is now commonly compared to actin microfilaments (7 nm) and microtubules (25 nm). Animal intermediate filaments are subcategorized into six types based on similarities in amino acid sequence and protein structure. Most types are cytoplasmic, but one type, Type V is a nuclear lamin. Unlike microtubules, IF distribution in cells shows no good correlation with the distribution of either mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum.

== Structure ==

The structure of proteins that form intermediate filaments (IF) was first predicted by computerized analysis of the amino acid sequence of a human epidermal keratin derived from cloned cDNAs. Analysis of a second keratin sequence revealed that the two types of keratins share only about 30% amino acid sequence homology but share similar patterns of secondary structure domains. As suggested by the first model, all IF proteins appear to have a central alpha-helical rod domain that is composed of four alpha-helical segments (named as 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B) separated by three linker regions.

The central building block of an intermediate filament is a pair of two intertwined proteins that is called a coiled-coil structure. This name reflects the fact that the structure of each protein is helical, and the intertwined pair is also a helical structure. Structural analysis of a pair of keratins shows that the two proteins that form the coiled-coil bind by hydrophobic interactions. The charged residues in the central domain do not have a major role in the binding of the pair in the central domain.

Cytoplasmic IFs assemble into non-polar unit-length filaments (ULFs). Identical ULFs associate laterally into staggered, antiparallel, soluble tetramers, which associate head-to-tail into protofilaments that pair up laterally into protofibrils, four of which wind together into an intermediate filament.
Part of the assembly process includes a compaction step, in which ULF tighten and assume a smaller diameter. The reasons for this compaction are not well understood, and IF are routinely observed to have diameters ranging between 6 and 12 nm.

The N-terminus and the C-terminus of IF proteins are non-alpha-helical regions and show wide variation in their lengths and sequences across IF families.
The N-terminal &quot;head domain&quot; binds DNA. Vimentin heads are able to alter nuclear architecture and chromatin distribution, and the liberation of heads by HIV-1 protease may play an important role in HIV-1 associated cytopathogenesis and carcinogenesis. Phosphorylation of the head region can affect filament stability. The head has been shown to interact with the rod domain of the same protein.

C-terminal &quot;tail domain&quot; shows extreme length variation between different IF proteins.

The anti-parallel orientation of tetramers means that, unlike microtubules and microfilaments, which have a plus end and a minus end, IFs lack polarity and cannot serve as basis for cell motility and intracellular transport.

Also, unlike actin or tubulin, intermediate filaments do not contain a binding site for a nucleoside triphosphate.

Cytoplasmic IFs do not undergo treadmilling like microtubules and actin fibers, but are dynamic.

== Biomechanical properties ==

IFs are rather deformable proteins that can be stretched several times their initial length. The key to facilitate this large deformation is due to their hierarchical structure, which facilitates a cascaded activation of deformation mechanisms at different levels of strain. Initially the coupled alpha-helices of unit-length filaments uncoil as they&#x27;re strained, then as the strain increases they transition into beta-sheets, and finally at increased strain the hydrogen bonds between beta-sheets slip and the ULF monomers slide along each other.

== Types ==
There are about 70 different human genes coding for various intermediate filament proteins. However, different kinds of IFs share basic characteristics: In general, they are all polymers that measure between 9–11 nm in diameter when fully assembled.

Animal IFs are subcategorized into six types based on similarities in amino acid sequence and protein structure:

=== Types I and II – acidic and basic keratins ===
These proteins are the most diverse among IFs and constitute type I (acidic) and type II (basic) IF proteins. The many isoforms are divided in two groups:
* epithelial keratins (about 20) in epithelial cells (image to right)
* trichocytic keratins (about 13) (hair keratins), which make up hair, nails, horns and reptilian scales.

Regardless of the group, keratins are either acidic or basic. Acidic and basic keratins bind each other to form acidic-basic heterodimers and these heterodimers then associate to make a keratin filament.

Cytokeratin filaments laterally associate with each other to create a thick bundle of ~50 nm radius. The optimal radius of such bundles is determined by the interplay between the long range electrostatic repulsion and short range hydrophobic attraction. Subsequently, these bundles would intersect through junctions to form a dynamic network, spanning the cytoplasm of epithelial cells.

=== Type III ===

There are four proteins classed as type III intermediate filament proteins, which may form homo- or heteropolymeric proteins.
* Desmin IFs are structural components of the sarcomeres in muscle cells and connect different cell organelles like the desmosomes with the cytoskeleton.
* Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is found in astrocytes and other glia.
* Peripherin found in peripheral neurons.
* Vimentin, the most widely distributed of all IF proteins, can be found in fibroblasts, leukocytes, and blood vessel endothelial cells. They support the cellular membranes, keep some organelles in a fixed place within the cytoplasm, and transmit membrane receptor signals to the nucleus.
* Syncoilin is an atypical type III IF protein.

=== Type IV ===
* Alpha-internexin
* Neurofilaments – the type IV family of intermediate filaments that is found in high concentrations along the axons of vertebrate neurons.
* Synemin
* Syncoilin

=== Type V – nuclear lamins ===
* Lamins
Lamins are fibrous proteins having structural function in the cell nucleus.

In metazoan cells, there are A and B type lamins, which differ in their length and pI. Human cells have three differentially regulated genes.
B-type lamins are present in every cell. B type lamins, lamin B1 and B2, are expressed from the LMNB1 and LMNB2 genes on 5q23 and 19q13, respectively.
A-type lamins are only expressed following gastrulation. Lamin A and C are the most common A-type lamins and are splice variants of the LMNA gene found at 1q21.

These proteins localize to two regions of the nuclear compartment, the nuclear lamina—a proteinaceous structure layer subjacent to the inner surface of the nuclear envelope and throughout the nucleoplasm in the nucleoplasmic veil.

Comparison of the lamins to vertebrate cytoskeletal IFs shows that lamins have an extra 42 residues (six heptads) within coil 1b. The c-terminal tail domain contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), an Ig-fold-like domain, and in most cases a carboxy-terminal CaaX box that is isoprenylated and carboxymethylated (lamin C does not have a CAAX box). Lamin A is further processed to remove the last 15 amino acids and its farnesylated cysteine.

During mitosis, lamins are phosphorylated by MPF, which drives the disassembly of the lamina and the nuclear envelope.

=== Type VI ===
* Beaded filaments: Filensin, Phakinin.
* Nestin (was once proposed for reclassification but due to differences, remains as a type VI IF protein)

Vertebrate-only. Related to type I-IV. Used to contain other newly discovered IF proteins not yet assigned to a type.

== Function ==

=== Cell adhesion ===
At the plasma membrane, some keratins or desmin interact with desmosomes (cell-cell adhesion) and hemidesmosomes (cell-matrix adhesion) via adapter proteins.

=== Associated proteins ===
Filaggrin binds to keratin fibers in epidermal cells. Plectin links vimentin to other vimentin fibers, as well as to microfilaments, microtubules, and myosin II. Kinesin is being researched and is suggested to connect vimentin to tubulin via motor proteins.

Keratin filaments in epithelial cells link to desmosomes (desmosomes connect the cytoskeleton together) through plakoglobin, desmoplakin, desmogleins, and desmocollins; desmin filaments are connected in a similar way in heart muscle cells.

== Diseases arising from mutations in IF genes ==
* Dilated cardiomyoathy (DCM), mutations in the &quot;DES&quot; gene
* Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), mutations in the &quot;DES&quot; gene
* Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), mutations in the &quot;DES&quot; gene
* Non-compaction cardiomyopathy, mutations in the &quot;DES&quot; genes
* Cardiomyopathy in combination with skeletal myopathy (&quot;DES&quot;)
* Epidermolysis bullosa simplex; keratin 5 or keratin 14 mutation
* Laminopathies are a family of diseases caused by mutations in nuclear lamins and include Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and various lipodystrophies and cardiomyopathies among others.

== In other organisms ==
IF proteins are universal among animals in the form of a nuclear lamin. The Hydra has an additional &quot;nematocilin&quot; derived from the lamin. Cytoplasmic IFs (type I-IV) are only found in Bilateria; they also arose from a gene duplication event involving &quot;type V&quot; nuclear lamin. In addition, a few other diverse types of eukaryotes have lamins, suggesting an early origin of the protein.

There was not really a concrete definition of an &quot;intermediate filament protein&quot;, in the sense that the size or shape-based definition does not cover a monophyletic group. With the inclusion of unusual proteins like the network-forming beaded lamins (type VI), the current classification is moving to a clade containing nuclear lamin and its many descendants, characterized by sequence similarity as well as the exon structure. Functionally-similar proteins out of this clade, like crescentins, alveolins, tetrins, and epiplasmins, are therefore only &quot;IF-like&quot;. They likely arose through convergent evolution.

<doc id="501160" wikidata="Q380330" url="?curid=501160" title="Vlad II Dracul">
<text>Vlad II (), also known as Vlad Dracul () or Vlad the Dragon (before 1395 – November 1447), was Voivode of Wallachia from 1436 to 1442, and again from 1443 to 1447. He is internationally known as the father of Vlad the Impaler, or Dracula. Born an illegitimate son of Mircea I of Wallachia, he spent his youth at the court of Sigismund of Luxembourg, who made him a member of the Order of the Dragon in 1431 (hence his sobriquet). Sigismund also recognized him as the lawful Voivode of Wallachia, allowing him to settle in nearby Transylvania. Vlad could not assert his claim during the life of his half-brother, Alexander I Aldea, who acknowledged the suzerainty of the Ottoman Sultan, Murad II.

After Alexander Aldea died in 1436, Vlad seized Wallachia with Hungarian support. Following the death of Sigismund of Luxembourg in 1437, Hungary&#x27;s position weakened, causing Vlad to pay homage to Murad II, which included participating in Murad II&#x27;s invasion of Transylvania in the summer of 1438. John Hunyadi, Voivode of Transylvania, came to Wallachia to convince Vlad to join a crusade against the Ottomans in 1441. After Hunyadi routed an Ottoman army in Transylvania, the sultan ordered Vlad to come to Edirne where he was captured in 1442. Hunyadi invaded Wallachia and made Vlad&#x27;s cousin, Basarab II, voivode.

Vlad was released before the end of the year but was forced to leave his two young sons as hostages in the Ottoman court. He was restored in Wallachia with Ottoman support in 1443. He remained neutral during Hunyadi&#x27;s &quot;Long Campaign&quot; against the Ottoman Empire between October 1443 and January 1444, but he sent 4,000 horsemen to fight against the Ottomans during the Crusade of Varna. With the support of a Burgundian fleet, he captured the important Ottoman fortress at Giurgiu in 1445. He made peace with the Ottoman Empire in 1446 or 1447, which contributed to the deterioration of his relationship with Hunyadi. Hunyadi invaded Wallachia, forcing Vlad to flee from Târgoviște in late November, where he was killed at a nearby village.

== Early life ==
Vlad&#x27;s early life is poorly documented. He was born before 1395, and was one of the numerous illegitimate sons of Mircea I of Wallachia. Vlad&#x27;s modern biographers agree that he was sent as a hostage to Sigismund of Luxembourg, King of Hungary, in 1395 or 1396. Sigismund mentioned that Vlad had been educated at his court, suggesting that he spent his youth in Buda, Nuremberg and other major towns of Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire.

Mircea I died in 1418, and his only legitimate son (and co-ruler), Michael, succeeded him. Two years later, Michael died fighting against his cousin, Dan II (the son of Mircea I&#x27;s elder brother, Dan I). During the following decade, Dan II and Vlad&#x27;s half-brother, Radu II Praznaglava, were fighting against each other for Wallachia.

Vlad left Buda for Poland without Sigismund&#x27;s authorization in early 1423, but was captured before reaching the border. Before long, Sigismund acknowledged Dan II as the lawful ruler of Wallachia. The Byzantine historian, Doukas, recorded that Vlad was &quot;an officer in the army&quot; of the Byzantine Emperor, John VIII Palaiologos, and he &quot;had access&quot; to the imperial palace in Constantinople. Historian Radu Florescu says that Sigismund had appointed Vlad to receive John VIII (who had come to Italy to seek assistance against the Ottomans) in Venice in 1423, and Vlad accompanied the emperor back to Constantinople. After realizing that John VIII could not help him to seize Wallachia, Vlad returned to Hungary in 1429.

Sigismund made Vlad a first-class member of the Order of the Dragon (a chivalric order established by Sigismund) in Nuremberg on 8 February 1431. Other first-class members included Alfonso V of Aragon and Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania. The dragon-shaped badge of the order gave rise to his Romanian sobriquet, &quot;Dracul&quot; (&quot;the Dragon&quot;), for which his sons became known as &quot;Dracula&quot; (&quot;son of Dracul&quot;). Vlad swore fealty to Sigismund who declared him the lawful prince of Wallachia. Vlad had to promise that he would protect the Roman Catholic Church. However, Sigismund did not assist him to seize Wallachia. In the summer, Vlad&#x27;s half-brother, Alexander I Aldea, invaded Wallachia with Moldavian support and dethroned Dan II.

Vlad did not abandon his claim to Wallachia and settled in Transylvania. A Neo-Renaissance mural in a three-storey house in the main square of Sighișoara (which was uncovered on the 500th anniversary of the death of Vlad Dracul&#x27;s son, Dracula) may depict Vlad Dracul after an original painting, according to Radu Florescu. The mural depicts a corpulent man with oval-shaped eyes and long moustaches wearing a white turban.

Alexander I Aldea went to Adrianople to do homage to the Ottoman Sultan, Murad II, in 1432. Vlad wanted to invade Wallachia with the support of Wallachian boyars (or noblemen) who had fled to Transylvania, but Alexander Aldea&#x27;s principal official, Albu, prevented the invasion. Sigismund authorized Vlad to buy weapons and muster an army of exiled boyars only in 1434. In 1435, Alexander Aldea fell seriously ill and never recovered. Taking advantage of his brother&#x27;s illness, Vlad broke into Wallachia, but Alexander Aldea and his Ottoman allies forced him to retreat.

== Reign ==

=== First rule ===
Alexander Aldea died in autumn 1436, enabling Vlad Dracul to seize Wallachia with Hungarian support. He did not dismiss his predecessor&#x27;s officials with the exception of Albu, who thus became his enemy. Vlad did not confirm the treaty that Alexander Aldea had concluded with the Ottomans, provoking an Ottoman incursion against Wallachia in November.

Vlad&#x27;s patron, Sigismund of Luxembourg, died on 9 December 1437. Sigismund&#x27;s death and the uprising of the Transylvanian peasants weakened Hungary, forcing Vlad to seek reconciliation with the Ottoman Empire. He went to Edirne and swore fealty to Murad II. He also promised to pay a yearly tribute to the sultan and to support the Ottomans&#x27; military campaigns at the sultan&#x27;s order. Before long, Murad II decided to invade Hungary and gathered his troops at Vidin.

Albert of Habsburg (who was Sigismund of Luxembourg&#x27;s son-in-law and successor) wrote a letter to Vlad, ordering him to protect Transylvania. Ignoring the king&#x27;s command, Vlad joined Murad II who came to Wallachia at the head of his army in summer 1438, serving the sultan as his guide. The Ottoman and Wallachian troops broke into Hungary at Orșova. They routed the army of a local Vlach &quot;kenez&quot;, Cândea, near Hațeg. They marched along the river Mureș, capturing Câlnic and Sebeș. At Sebeș, Vlad convinced the leaders of the town to give in without resistance, promising to protect their property if they accompanied him to Wallachia. The Ottomans and Wallachians laid siege to Sibiu, but the siege lasted only for 8 days. They destroyed the outskirts of Brașov, before they left Hungary loaded with plunder and taking more than 30,000 captives.

After the Ottoman army left Wallachia, Vlad offered Albert of Habsburg to set the burghers who had been captured at Sebeș free, but the king (who regarded them traitors) refused his offer. Vlad&#x27;s attempts to maintain a balance between Hungary and the Ottomans made both the king and the sultan suspicious about his true intentions. Albert allowed a pretender to the Wallachian throne, Basarab (who was a son of Dan II) to settle in Hungary. The Ottomans strengthened the fortress of Giurgiu and sent new troops to garrison the town.

Albert of Habsburg died on 27 October 1439. The majority of the Hungarian noblemen elected Władysław III of Poland king in early 1440. Władysław made the talented military commander, John Hunyadi, voivode of Transylvania in February 1441. Hunyadi who decided to restore the influence of Hungary in Wallachia ordered the burghers of Brașov to mint coins for Vlad around 15 October. Two or three weeks later, Hunyadi came to Târgoviște to meet Vlad, demanding him to join a crusade against the Ottoman Empire.

After Hunyadi defeated the Ottomans in Transylvania in March 1442, the Ottoman governor of Bulgaria accused Vlad of treachery, according to the contemporaneous Ottoman historian, Neşri. Murad summoned Vlad to Edirne to demonstrate his loyalty. Before departing, Vlad made his eldest son, Mircea, the ruler of Wallachia. Soon after he came to Edirne, he was captured at the sultan&#x27;s command. He was held in captivity in Gallipoli.

=== Captivity and second rule ===
Murad sent Hadım Şehabeddin, Beylerbey (or governor) of Rumelia, to annex Wallachia in August 1442. Hunyadi annihilated the Ottoman army in the Carpathian Mountains in September, and made Vlad&#x27;s cousin, Basarab, voivode of Wallachia. Before the end of the year, Murad II released Vlad. Vlad had to pledge that he would not support the enemies of the Ottoman Empire and he would pay an annual tribute and send 500 Wallachian boys to serve as janissaries in the sultan&#x27;s army. He was also forced to leave his two sons, Vlad and Radu, as hostages in the Ottoman Empire.

The circumstances of Vlad&#x27;s return to Wallachia are unknown. He regained his throne between March and September 1443. During Hunyadi&#x27;s &quot;Long Campaign&quot; against the Ottoman Empire, which lasted from October 1443 to January 1444, Vlad remained neutral, especially because the sultan promised the release of his two sons. In the ensuing peace negotiations between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, Murad II was willing to release Vlad from his obligation to personally visit his court, but the papal legate, Julian Cesarini, prevented the ratification of the peace treaty. Instead, he urged Władysław to continue the crusade against the Ottoman Empire. On the other hand, Vlad tried to dissuade Władysław III from waging war against the Ottomans, reminding him that Murad II went hunting with more retainers than Władysław had troops, according to the Polish historian, Jan Długosz. Nevertheless, he sent 4,000 horsemen under the command of his son, Mircea, to fight against the Ottomans.

The crusade ended with the catastrophic defeat of the crusaders in the Battle of Varna on 10 November 1444. After the battle Hunyadi wanted to return to Hungary through Wallachia, but he was captured by Wallachian soldiers at the Danube. Vlad only released him after Lawrence Héderváry, Palatine of Hungary, threatened him with a war. According to historian John Jefferson, Vlad held Hunyadi in captivity because he wanted to hand him over to the sultan. Camil Mureşanu writes that Hunyadi was only imprisoned because the soldiers who captured him did not recognize him. Historian Kurt W. Teptow says, Vlad held Hunyadi responsible for the catastrophe and almost killed him. After releasing Hunyadi, Vlad gave him precious gifts and accompanied him as far as the Hungarian border.

A fleet of Burgundian crusaders attacked the Ottoman fleet on the Black Sea in the spring 1445. The commander of the fleet, Walerand of Wavrin, sent envoys to Hungary to start negotiations about a joint campaign against the Ottoman Empire. At Hunyadi&#x27;s request, one of Wavrin&#x27;s envoys, Pedro Vasque de Saavedra, visited Vlad and convinced him to meet Wavrin. In July, Vlad went to Isaccea where he made an alliance with Wavrin. Vlad mustered an army of 4,000–6,000 strong and placed it under the command of his son, Mircea.

The Burgundian and Wallachian army laid siege to Silistra in the middle of September, but they could not capture it. Before long, however, they conquered and destroyed the small fort at Tutrakan. Vlad convinced Wavrin to attack Giurgiu, saying that whenever the Ottomans &quot;want to harry Wallachia or Transylvania, they and their horses can cross&quot; the Danube near the fortified island at Giurgiu, connected to the Wallachian bank by a bridge. During the siege of Giurgiu, two iron rings of a large bombard suddenly broke, killing two soldiers, because Vlad, who was in the command of the fire, did not allow the bombard to cool down between blows. The Ottoman garrison of the fortress capitulated on the condition that they were allowed to freely leave for the Ottoman Empire. However, after they left the fortress, 2,000 Wallachian soldiers attacked and massacred them at Vlad&#x27;s order, because he regarded the commander of the Ottoman garrison responsible for his captivity in 1442.

Before long, the Ottoman garrison at Ruse also capitulated. Vlad gave asylum to more than 11,000 Bulgarians who had rebelled against the Ottomans, assisting them to cross the Danube into Wallachia. The Burgundian crusaders and the Wallachians approached Nicopolis, where a Hungarian army under the command of John Hunyadi joined them on 14 September. However, an early frost forced the crusaders to abandon the campaign in October, because they feared that the Danube would freeze over.

The relationship between Wallachia and Hungary soon deteriorated. In a letter written late in 1445 to the townspeople of Brașov, Vlad complained that Wallachian merchants were arrested in Transylvania, although he had left his &quot;little children to be butchered for Christian peace so that [he] and [his] country [could] be subjects&quot; of the king of Hungary. His words evidence that he was convinced that his two sons had been murdered in the Ottoman Empire, but the sultan did not harm the boys. In 1446 or 1447, Vlad made peace with the Ottomans, even agreeing to return the Bulgarian refugees to the Ottoman Empire. He intervened in the fight for the Moldavian throne in favor of Roman II of Moldavia in July 1447. The Poles also supported Roman, but Roman&#x27;s opponent, Peter III, was Hunyadi&#x27;s protégé.

On 20 July 1447, John Hunyadi ordered the burghers of Brașov to give shelter to a pretender to the Wallachian throne, Vladislav, who was a cousin of Vlad. Hunyadi unexpectedly broke into Wallachia in late November, taking with him Vladislav (also known as Dan). Vlad fled from Târgoviște, but he was captured and killed in the marshes at Bălteni. In a letter written on 4 December 1447, Hunyadi styled himself &quot;voivode of the Transalpine land&quot; (Wallachia) and referred to Târgoviște as his fortress, implying that he had taken control of Wallachia by that time. Hunyadi placed Vladislav on the throne of Wallachia.

The place of Vlad Dracul&#x27;s burial has not been identified. Cazacu says, he was most probably buried in the Snagov Monastery. Florescu writes, Vlad Dracul was buried in a chapel in the Dealu Monastery near Târgoviște.

== Family ==

According to a widely accepted scholarly theory, Vlad&#x27;s wife was &quot;Cneajna&quot;, a daughter of Alexander I of Moldavia. She was called Eupraxia, according to Florescu. Historian Matei Cazacu writes that she was his second wife. He does not identify Vlad&#x27;s first wife. Vlad&#x27;s descendants were known as Drăculești, because they adopted Vlad&#x27;s sobriquet as their patronymic (Dracula). The conflict between the Drăculești and the Dănești (the descendants of Dan I of Wallachia), and strifes between the members of the Drăculești line contributed to the political instability in 15th-century Wallachia.

Vlad&#x27;s eldest sons, Mircea and Vlad Dracula, were first mentioned in a charter of Vlad on 20 January 1437. Mircea was born in about 1428, Vlad between 1429 and 1431. Their brother (Vlad Dracul&#x27;s third son), Radu the Fair, was born before 2 August 1439. Florescu writes that Vlad Dracul&#x27;s daughter, Alexandra, married the Wallachian boyar Vintilă Florescu. Vlad Dracul also fathered illegitimate children. A Wallachian noblewoman, Călțuna, gave birth to Vlad the Monk. Almost no information is known about the life of another illegitimate son, Mircea.

<text>William Harrison Hays Sr. (; November 5, 1879 – March 7, 1954) was an American politician, and member of the Republican Party. As chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1918 to 1921, Hays managed the successful 1920 presidential campaign of Warren G. Harding. Harding then appointed Hays to his cabinet as his first Postmaster General. He resigned from the cabinet in 1922 to become the first chairman of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America. As chairman, Hays oversaw the promulgation of the Motion Picture Production Code (informally known as the Hays Code), which spelled out a set of moral guidelines for the self-censorship of content in American cinema.

==Early life==
William Harrison Hays Sr. was born November 5, 1879, in Sullivan, Indiana. He attended Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana.

==Career==
He was the manager of Warren G. Harding&#x27;s successful campaign for the Presidency of the United States in the 1920 election and was subsequently appointed Postmaster General. While serving in the Harding Administration, he became peripherally involved in the Teapot Dome scandal.

===Teapot Dome scandal===
The oilman Harry Ford Sinclair devised a scheme in which twenty-five cents was diverted from the sale of every barrel of oil sold from the oil field leases that were the focus of the Teapot Dome scandal. Sinclair testified that he &quot;loaned&quot; Will H. Hays, then-chairman of the Republican National Committee, $185,000 worth of Liberty Bonds, later getting back $100,000. Sinclair also gave Hays $75,000 as an outright gift to the committee. At the time, Hays was attempting to pay off the 1920 Republican campaign debt. Hays later approached a number of wealthy men and told them that if they would contribute to pay down the committee&#x27;s debt, he would reimburse them for their contributions with Liberty Bonds.

In 1924, after his resignation from the Harding administration and while he was serving as President of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, Hays was called to testify before the Senate Committee on Public Lands. When asked how much money Sinclair had contributed to the Republican Party, Hays testified that his contribution was $75,000. In 1928, after more details of Sinclair&#x27;s scheme had emerged, Hays was called to testify again. Hays then told the full story of Sinclair&#x27;s contribution, including the donation of $185,000 in Liberty Bonds and the $75,000 cash contribution. He stated that he had not mentioned the bonds in his earlier testimony because the Committee &quot;had not asked about any bonds.&quot; While there was some public perception that Hays was attempting to conceal Sinclair&#x27;s large contribution to the Republican National Committee, he testified that he was &quot;using the bonds to raise money for the deficit.&quot;

===Chairman of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America ===
Hays resigned his cabinet position on January 14, 1922, to become Chairman of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America shortly after the organization&#x27;s founding. He began his new job, at a $35,360 annual salary (), on March 6 of that year. There was speculation that he would be paid between $100,000 and $150,000 a year.

The goal of the organization was to improve the image of the movie industry in the wake of the scandal surrounding the alleged rape and murder of model and actress Virginia Rappe, of which film star Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle was accused, and amid growing calls by religious groups for federal censorship of the movies. Hiring Hays to &quot;clean up the pictures&quot; was, at least in part, a public relations ploy and much was made of his conservative credentials, including his roles as a Presbyterian deacon and past chairman of the Republican Party.

In his new position in Hollywood, Hays&#x27; main roles were to persuade individual state censor boards not to ban specific films outright and to reduce the financial impact of the boards&#x27; cuts and edits. At that time, the studios were required by state laws to pay the censor boards for each foot of film excised and for each title card edited; in addition, studios also had the expense of duplicating and distributing separate versions of each censored film for the state or states that adhered to a particular board&#x27;s decisions.
Hays attempted to reduce studio costs (and improve the industry&#x27;s image in general) by advising individual studios on how to produce movies to reduce the likelihood that the film would be cut. Each board kept its &quot;standards&quot; secret (if, indeed, they had any standardization at all), so Hays was forced to intuit what would or would not be permitted by each board. At first he applied what he called &quot;The Formula&quot; but it was not particularly successful; from that he developed a set of guidelines he called &quot;The Don&#x27;ts and Be Carefuls&quot;. In general his efforts at pre-release self-censorship were unsuccessful in quieting calls for federal censorship.

Catholic bishops and lay people tended to be wary of federal censorship and favored the Hays approach of self-censorship; these included the outspoken Catholic layman Martin J. Quigley, publisher of &quot;Exhibitors Herald-World&quot; (a trade magazine for independent exhibitors). For several months in 1929, Martin Quigley, Joseph Breen, Father Daniel A. Lord S.J., Father FitzGeorge Dinneen S.J., and Father Wilfred Parsons (editor of Catholic publication &quot;America&quot;) discussed the desirability of a new and more stringent code of behavior for the movies. With the blessing of Cardinal George W. Mundelein of Chicago, Father Lord authored the code, which later became known as &quot;The Production Code&quot;, &quot;the code&quot;, and &quot;The Hays Code&quot;. It was presented to Will Hays in 1930 who said, &quot;My eyes nearly popped out when I read it. This was the very thing I had been looking for&quot;.

The studio heads were less enthusiastic but they agreed to make the code the rule of the industry, albeit with many loopholes that allowed studio producers to override the Hays Office&#x27;s application of it. From 1930 to 1934, the production code was only slightly effective in fighting back calls for federal censorship. However, things came to a head in 1934 with widespread threats of Catholic boycotts of &quot;immoral&quot; movies, as well as reduced funding from Catholic financiers such as A. P. Giannini of the Bank of America. As a result, the studios granted Hays&#x27; organization full authority to enforce the production code on all studios, creating a relatively strict regime of self-censorship which endured for decades (the code was set aside in the 1960s when the age-based rating system in force today was adopted). Hays hired Joseph Breen, a Catholic and antisemite who was able to use his position to censor films expressing sentiments against Nazism or fascism. In 1934, to deal with &quot;inappropriate&quot; industry personnel (alongside the Code&#x27;s concern with the industry&#x27;s output), Hays created a list of 117 names of performers whose personal lives he thought made them unfit to appear in films.

As an example of Hays&#x27; philosophy, he reportedly said to a movie director: &quot;When you make a woman cross her legs in the films, maybe you don&#x27;t need to see how she can cross them and stay within the law; but how low she can cross them and still be interesting&quot;.

Hays worked with the U.S. government, particularly the State Department and the Department of Commerce, to maintain Hollywood&#x27;s domination of overseas movie markets.

===Central Casting===
When the entertainment industry started to take off in the early 1920s, thousands of people flocked to Hollywood with hopes of becoming the next big star. These hopefuls were called &quot;extras&quot; because they were the extra people who filled out scenes. The main way to find work at this time was to wait outside the gates of studios, hoping to be hired on the spot. With little regulation on hiring film extras, many people were exploited while looking for work. In an effort to fix the employment issues and exploitation that plagued the industry, Hays commissioned several studies of the employment conditions in Hollywood, including one from Mary van Kleeck, a prominent sociologist with the Russell Sage Foundation. After reviewing the results of the studies, Hays adopted a suggestion of van Kleeck&#x27;s and created the Central Casting Corporation in 1925 as a way to regulate the hiring of extras in Hollywood.

===Production Code===

The production code enumerated three &quot;General Principles&quot;:

#No picture shall be produced that will lower the moral standards of those who see it. Hence the sympathy of the audience should never be thrown to the side of crime, wrongdoing, evil or sin.
#Correct standards of life, subject only to the requirements of drama and entertainment, shall be presented.
#Law, natural or human, shall not be ridiculed, nor shall sympathy be created for its violation.

Specific restrictions were spelled out as &quot;Particular Applications&quot; of these principles:

:*Nudity and suggestive dances were prohibited.
:*The ridicule of religion was forbidden, and ministers of religion were not to be represented as comic characters or villains.
:*The depiction of illegal drug use was forbidden, as well as the use of liquor, &quot;when not required by the plot or for proper characterization.&quot;
:*Methods of crime (e.g. safe-cracking, arson, smuggling) were not to be explicitly presented.
:*References to sex perversions such as homosexuality and venereal disease were forbidden, as were depictions of childbirth.
:*The language section banned various words and phrases that were considered to be offensive.
:*Murder scenes had to be filmed in a way that would discourage imitations in real life, and brutal killings could not be shown in detail.
:*&quot;Revenge in modern times&quot; was not to be justified.
:*The sanctity of marriage and the home had to be upheld.
:*&quot;Pictures shall not infer that low forms of sex relationship are the accepted or common thing.&quot;
:*Adultery and illicit sex, although recognized as sometimes necessary to the plot, could not be explicit or justified and were not supposed to be presented as an attractive option.
:*Portrayals of miscegenation were forbidden.
:*&quot;Scenes of Passion&quot; were not to be introduced when not essential to the plot.
:*&quot;Excessive and lustful kissing&quot; was to be avoided, along with any other treatment that might &quot;stimulate the lower and baser element.&quot;
:*The flag of the United States was to be treated respectfully, and the people and history of other nations were to be presented &quot;fairly.&quot;
:*&quot;Vulgarity&quot;, defined as &quot;low, disgusting, unpleasant, though not necessarily evil, subjects&quot; must be &quot;subject to the dictates of good taste.&quot;
:*Capital punishment, &quot;third-degree methods&quot;, cruelty to children and animals, prostitution and surgical operations were to be handled with similar sensitivity.

==Death==
After his retirement, Will H. Hays returned to Sullivan, Indiana, where he died on March 7, 1954. His widow died in 1960.

==In popular culture==
In their 1940 short &quot;No Census, No Feeling&quot;, The Three Stooges refer to Will Hays and his position as censor czar in a joke, when Moe tells Curly, &quot;We have a job now, we&#x27;re working for the Census&quot;; Curly replies &quot;You mean Will Hays?&quot; in a word association of &quot;census&quot; and &quot;censors&quot;.

In the 1942 Looney Tunes cartoon “A Tale of Two Kitties,” an Abbott and Costello parody, two cats, Babbit and Catstello, try to eat a naked “tweety” bird. During the ladder scene, Babbit yells &quot;Give me the bird!&quot; To which Catstello replies, &quot;If the Hays Office would only let me, I&#x27;d give him the bird all right!&quot;

<text>Papilio glaucus, the eastern tiger swallowtail, is a species of butterfly native to eastern North America. It is one of the most familiar butterflies in the eastern United States, ranging north to southern Ontario, Canada, and is common in many different habitats. It flies from spring until fall, during which it produces two to three . Adults feed on the nectar of many species of flowers, mostly from those of the families Apocynaceae, Asteraceae, and Fabaceae. &quot;P. glaucus&quot; has a wingspan measuring . The male is yellow with four black &quot;tiger stripes&quot; on each forewing. Females may be either yellow or black, making them dimorphic. The yellow morph is similar to the male, but with a conspicuous band of blue spots along the hindwing, while the dark morph is almost completely black.

The green eggs are laid singly on plants of the families Magnoliaceae and Rosaceae. Young caterpillars are brown and white; older ones are green with two black, yellow, and blue eyespots on the thorax. The caterpillar will turn brown prior to pupating. It will reach a length of . The chrysalis varies from a whitish color to dark brown. Hibernation occurs in this stage in locations with cold winter months.

The eastern tiger swallowtail is the state butterfly of Alabama (as well as state mascot), Delaware, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, and is the state insect of Virginia.

==Description==
The wingspan ranges from with females being the larger sex. Southern individuals are larger than northern ones. Males are yellow with four black &quot;tiger stripes&quot; on each forewing. The outer edge of the forewing is black with a row of yellow spots. The veins are marked with black. The postmedian area of the hindwing is black with yellow spots along the margin. The inner margin of the hindwing has small red and blue spots. The ventral forewing margin has a yellow bar that is broken into spots. This broken bar is present in both sexes, and is used to distinguish &quot;P. glaucus&quot; from its close relatives.

Females are dimorphic. The yellow morph differs from the male in having a blue postmedian area on the dorsal hindwing. In the dark morph, the areas that are normally yellow are replaced with dark gray or black. The bluish postmedian area on the ventral hindwing has one row of orange spots. A shadow of the &quot;tiger stripes&quot; can be seen on the underside of some dark females.
&quot;P. glaucus&quot; is one of a few species of papilionids known to produce gynandromorphs. Most bilateral gynandromorphs are hybrids of &quot;P. glaucus&quot; and &quot;P. canadensis&quot; that are found along hybrid zones. Color mosaics are found in the central part of the species range.
==Taxonomy==
The first known drawing of a North American butterfly was of an eastern tiger swallowtail. It was drawn by John White in 1587, during Sir Walter Raleigh&#x27;s third expedition to Virginia. White named his drawing &quot;Mamankanois&quot; which is believed to be a Carolina Algonquian word for &quot;butterfly&quot;. This species was later described by Carl Linnaeus in his 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1758. Some taxonomists place &quot;P. glaucus&quot;, along with the other tiger swallowtails, in the genus &quot;Pterourus&quot;.

The eastern tiger swallowtail was formerly considered a single species with a vast range into northern Canada and the eastern United States. In 1991, the subspecies &quot;Papilio glaucus canadensis&quot; was elevated to species level, thus reducing the range of &quot;P. glaucus&quot; to south of Canada. In 2002, another closely related species, &quot;P. appalachiensis&quot;, was described by H. Pavulaan and D. M. Wright from the southern Appalachian Mountains. These two species can be separated from &quot;P. glaucus&quot; by size; &quot;P. canadensis&quot; is smaller and &quot;P. appalachiensis&quot; is larger. These two also have a solid yellow bar along the margin of the ventral forewing. &quot;P. canadensis&quot; females are not dimorphic, and &quot;P. appalachiensis&quot; females are rarely black.

Similar species for the dark &quot;P. glaucus&quot; female include the pipevine swallowtail (&quot;Battus philenor&quot;), the spicebush swallowtail (&quot;Papilio troilus&quot;), and the female black swallowtail (&quot;Papilio polyxenes&quot;). &quot;B. philenor&quot; differs from the dark morph &quot;P. glaucus&quot; by the row of light-colored spots on each wing margin. &quot;P. troilus&quot; is more greenish, and has two rows of orange spots on the ventral hindwing. &quot;P. polyxenes&quot; is smaller, and the ventral hindwing has two rows of yellow-orange spots.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;P. glaucus&quot; is found in the eastern United States from southern Vermont to Florida west to eastern Texas and the Great Plains. It is common throughout its range, although is rarer in southern Florida and absent from the Florida Keys. In 1932, a single specimen was collected in County Wicklow, Ireland. It is believed to have been an accidental introduction from North America.

&quot;P. glaucus&quot; can be found almost anywhere deciduous forests occur. Common habitats include woodlands, fields, rivers, creeks, roadsides, and gardens. It will stray into urban parks and city yards. Because it has adapted to many different habitats and host plants, &quot;P. glaucus&quot; is a generalist, and is not considered threatened. &quot;Papilio glaucus&quot; is considered to be one of the most polyphagous of all swallowtail species. This is likely due to genetic traits and differential detoxification abilities. However, as compared to &quot;Papilio canadensis&quot;, at the northern overlap between the two species, &quot;P. glaucus&quot; survive very poorly through their first larval instar when settling on a quaking aspen (&quot;Populus tremeloides&quot;) tree and their survival rate under those conditions are approximately 15%, whereas &quot;P. canadensis&quot; thrives on this food plant.

Adults are seen from spring to fall, although the exact date varies depending on the location. In the south, they are seen from February to November; in the north, they are seen from May to September. &quot;P. glaucus&quot; produces two in the north and three in the south. The first broods yield the smallest adults.

==Behavior==

Eastern tiger swallowtails are diurnal, and are usually solitary. Adults are known to fly high above the ground, usually seen above the tree canopy. Males seek females by patrolling habitats containing the larval host plants. During courtship, the male and female fly about each other prior to landing and mating. The male releases perfume-like pheromones during courtship to entice the female into mating.

Adults use a wide range of food sources, most preferring to nectar on sturdy plants with red or pink flowers. Many members of the families Apocynaceae, Asteraceae and Fabaceae are used as common nectar sources. Males participate in a behavior called puddling, in which they congregate on mud, damp gravel or puddles. They extract sodium ions and amino acids from these sources which aid in reproduction. Males that puddle are typically fresh, and puddle only for their first couple of days. Females will occasionally puddle, but do not form congregations. Adults have also been seen feeding on dung, carrion, and urine.

The eastern tiger swallowtail, &quot;Papilio glaucus&quot;, is probably the most polyphagous of all 560+ species of swallowtail butterflies in the world.

==Life cycle==
The butterfly may have one or two generations in the north, while southern areas may have three. Time duration for various stages is as follows:
*Egg - It takes three to five days for eggs to hatch.
*Larva - The caterpillar has five instars.
*Pupa - The chrysalis stage lasts nine to eleven days, or over winter hibernation.

===Egg===

Females lay their eggs singly on the host plant leaves, preferring to oviposit on host plants near nectar sources. The egg is round and green, later turning yellowish green with reddish dots. The size of the egg is large for a butterfly, being 0.8 millimeters (0.03 in) in height and 1.2 millimeters (0.05 in) in width. It takes between 4 and 10 days to hatch.

===Caterpillar===
The caterpillar eats the leaves of the host plant. It will rest on a silk pad on a leaf, with the edges of the leaf folded over itself and held together with silk. The first three instars are brown. A large white spot, known as a saddle, is found on the abdomen. After molting to the fourth instar, the caterpillar becomes green. The swollen thorax has two black, yellow, and blue eyespots. These eyespots are much smaller than those of the similar-looking spicebush swallowtail caterpillar. A yellow and black transverse stripe is present between the first and second abdominal segments. It is concealed between the folds of the segments when the caterpillar is at rest. The abdomen is spotted transversely with light blue. Before pupating, the caterpillar will turn dark brown. It will reach a length of . The caterpillar of &quot;P. glaucus&quot; is impossible to distinguish from the caterpillars of &quot;P. canadensis&quot; and &quot;P. appalachiensis&quot;.

===Chrysalis===
The chrysalis measures . It hangs from a surface by a silk girdle around the thorax and a silk pad at the base. The chrysalis varies in color, ranging from off white to dark brown. It is often spotted with green and dark brown. Lighter-colored chrysalids often have a dark lateral stripe along each side of the body. Two horn-like projections are present on the head; one is found on the thorax. &quot;P. glaucus&quot; chrysalids can be found in a variety of places, but are commonly found on tree trunks, fence posts, and in ground litter. It hibernates in locations with cold winters.

===Host plants===

The caterpillar feeds on host plants of many different families. Common host plants used are those of the families Magnoliaceae and Rosaceae, with species including tulip tree (&quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot;), sweet bay magnolia (&quot;Magnolia virginiana&quot;) and wild black cherry (&quot;Prunus serotina&quot;). It also feeds on other members of the family Rosaceae, as well as members from the families Lauraceae, Oleaceae, Rutaceae, and Tilioideae.
Aspens (&quot;Populus&quot; sect. &quot;Populus&quot;), birches (&quot;Betula&quot;), and willows (&quot;Salix&quot;) have been recorded in older literature as host plants, but these are used by &quot;P. canadensis&quot;. Host plants of &quot;P. glaucus&quot; include:
* Wild black cherry (&quot;Prunus serotina&quot;)
* Ash (&quot;Fraxinus&quot; species)
* Cottonwood (&quot;Populus&quot; species)
* Wafer ash or hoptree (&quot;Ptelea trifoliata&quot;)
* Common lilac (&quot;Syringa vulgaris&quot;)
* Sweet bay magnolia (&quot;Magnolia virginiana&quot;)
* Tulip poplar or tulip tree (&quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot;)
* Willow (&quot;Salix&quot; species)

==Defense against predators==

The first three instars of the caterpillar are bird dropping mimics, coloration that helps protect it from predators. In later instars, the eyespots on the thorax serve to deter birds. Like all members of the family Papilionidae, the caterpillar of &quot;P. glaucus&quot; possesses an osmeterium, an orange, fleshy organ that emits foul-smelling terpenes to repel predators. Normally hidden, the osmeterium is located on the first segment of the thorax, and can be everted when the caterpillar feels threatened. The combination of eyespots and osmeterium makes the caterpillar resemble a snake.

Since adults are palatable, dark morph females use Batesian mimicry to protect themselves from vertebrate predators by mimicking the poisonous pipevine swallowtail. Dark morph females are more prevalent in the south, where &quot;B. philenor&quot; is more common.

<text>Papilio is a genus in the swallowtail butterfly family, Papilionidae, as well as the only representative of the tribe Papilionini. The word &quot;papilio&quot; is Latin for butterfly.

It includes the common yellow swallowtail (&quot;Papilio machaon&quot;), which is widespread in the Northern Hemisphere and the type species of the genus, as well as a number of other well-known North American species such as the western tiger swallowtail (&quot;Papilio rutulus&quot;). Familiar species elsewhere in the world include the Mormons (&quot;Papilio polytes&quot;, &quot;Papilio polymnestor&quot;, &quot;Papilio memnon&quot;, and &quot;Papilio deiphobus&quot;) in Asia, the orchard and Ulysses swallowtails in Australia (&quot;Papilio aegeus&quot;, &quot;Papilio ulysses&quot;, respectively) and the citrus swallowtail of Africa (&quot;Papilio demodocus&quot;).

Older classifications of the swallowtails tended to use many rather small genera. More recent classifications have been more conservative, and as a result a number of former genera are now absorbed within &quot;Papilio&quot;, such as &quot;Achillides&quot;, &quot;Eleppone&quot;, &quot;Druryia&quot;, &quot;Heraclides&quot; (giant swallowtails), &quot;Menelaides&quot;, &quot;Princeps&quot;, &quot;Pterourus&quot; (tiger swallowtails), and &quot;Sinoprinceps&quot;. The genus as recognized by modern systems has about 200 members. The genus &quot;Chilasa&quot; is regarded as a subgenus of &quot;Papilio&quot; by some workers, as are the baggy-tailed swallowtails (&quot;Agehana&quot;), although the latter taxon is usually considered a subgenus of &quot;Chilasa&quot;.

Many of the larvae resemble bird droppings during a development stage. Adults are edible to birds and some species are mimics.

==Ecology==
In their larval form, members of &quot;Papilio&quot; typically feed upon plants of Rutaceae including common ornamental and agriculturally important species such as &quot;Citrus&quot; species, &quot;Murraya&quot; species, &quot;Choisya&quot; species and &quot;Calodendrum&quot; species. Caterpillars sequester terpenoids from their diet to produce a foul smelling oil used in defence.

<text>Paid inclusion is a search engine marketing product where the search engine company charges fees related to inclusion of websites in their search index. The use of paid inclusion is controversial, and paid inclusion&#x27;s popularity has decreased over time among search engines.

==Definition of paid inclusion==
The FTC defined paid inclusion as &quot;Paid inclusion can take many forms. Examples of paid inclusion include programs where the only sites listed are those that have paid; where paid sites are intermingled among non-paid sites; and where companies pay to have their Websites or URLs reviewed more quickly, or for more frequent spidering of their Websites or URLs, or for the review or inclusion of deeper levels of their Websites, than is the case with non-paid sites.&quot;

Note that paid inclusion is different from paid placement. With paid placement, companies pay search engines to rank higher than they would have ranked if relevancy was the only ranking factor. Paid placement also gives companies guaranteed top rankings if they pay for it. With paid inclusion, top rankings are not guaranteed, and only inclusion within the search engine is. Therefore, a company who paid for inclusion within a search engine will still have its rankings determined by relevancy.

==History of paid inclusion==
In the early days of search, paid inclusion was a convenient way for search engines, such as Inktomi, Microsoft, Ask, Yahoo, Overture, AltaVista, and FAST, to obtain revenue. Unlike the other major search engines, Google decided to avoid paid inclusion and, instead, pursue higher relevancy using AdSense as its revenue source. As time went by, search engines such as Microsoft and Ask moved away from paid inclusion—both search engines ended paid inclusion programs in 2004.

===Google&#x27;s incorporation of paid inclusion===
In 2012, Google re-incorporated paid inclusion within its search, though in a different form. Google Flights, Google Hotel Finder, and Google Shopping all have new forms of paid inclusion programs. Some critics, such as Danny Sullivan, founder of Search Engine Watch, criticize this move as a step away from the Founder&#x27;s Letter that was a part of Google&#x27;s IPO. Aaron Wall of the popular SEO site SEOBook.com criticize Google&#x27;s use of paid inclusion as a way to push almost all organic rankings below the fold.

==Mixed views on paid inclusion==
Paid inclusion has its advantages and drawbacks. The advantage of a paid inclusion search engine is that spam is reduced while relevancy improves. However, detractors of paid inclusion allege that it causes searches to return results based more on the economic standing of the interests of a web site, and less on the relevancy of that site to end-users. Ask Jeeves reported that paid inclusion reduced relevancy and, in 2004, ended its paid inclusion program.

==Guidelines for paid inclusion==
The FTC has advised search engines to clearly mark paid placement and paid inclusion in accordance with Section 5 of the FTC Act. For this is only a guideline and not a law, companies with search algorithms such as Nextag and Google are not legally bound to follow it.

<doc id="501176" wikidata="Q59905" url="?curid=501176" title="Swallowtail butterfly">
<text>Swallowtail butterflies are large, colorful butterflies in the family Papilionidae, and include over 550 species. Though the majority are tropical, members of the family inhabit every continent except Antarctica. The family includes the largest butterflies in the world, the birdwing butterflies of the genus &quot;Ornithoptera&quot;.

Swallowtails have a number of distinctive features; for example, the papilionid caterpillar bears a repugnatorial organ called the osmeterium on its prothorax. The osmeterium normally remains hidden, but when threatened, the larva turns it outward through a transverse dorsal groove by inflating it with fluid.

The forked appearance in some of the swallowtails&#x27; hindwings, which can be seen when the butterfly is resting with its wings spread, gave rise to the common name &quot;swallowtail&quot;. As for its formal name, Linnaeus chose &quot;Papilio&quot; for the type genus, as &quot;papilio&quot; is Latin for &quot;butterfly&quot;. For the specific epithets of the genus, Linnaeus applied the names of Greek figures to the swallowtails. The type species: &quot;Papilio machaon&quot; honored Machaon, one of the sons of Asclepius, mentioned in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. Further, the species &quot;Papilio homerus&quot; is named after the Greek poet, Homer.

The Mon of the Taira clan of Japan is an Agehachō (swallowtail butterfly).

== Taxonomy ==

=== Subfamilies ===

The genera of extant swallowtails are usually classified into three subfamilies, Baroniinae, Parnassiinae, and Papilioninae, the latter two being further divided into tribes. In swallowtails, besides morphological characteristics, the choice of food plants and ecological lifestyle reflect phylogeny and classification.

==== Baroniinae ====
The Baroniinae are a monotypic subfamily, restricted to a very small region in Mexico and are considered to be the most basal of the subfamilies. &quot;Baronia brevicornis&quot; is considered to be a relict species, and shares features with a fossil taxon &quot;Praepapilio&quot;. &quot;Baronia&quot; is unique among papilionidae&#x27; as having an &quot;Acacia&quot; species (family Leguminosae) as its food plant.

Subfamily: Baroniene.
==== Parnassiinae ====
The Parnassiinae are a subfamily of essentially Holarctic butterflies. The vast majority of species, mostly &quot;Parnassius&quot;, can be found in mountain habitats. Parnassiinines can also be found in other habitats such as &quot;arid deserts (&quot;Hypermnestra&quot;), humid forests (&quot;Luehdorfia&quot;) and even lowland meadows (&quot;Zerynthia&quot;)&quot;. The tribes recognized in the Parnassiinae are Parnassiini, Zerynthiini, and Luehdorfiini.

Tribe Parnassiini contains two genera, &quot;Hypermnestra&quot;, largely confined to central Asia and the genus &quot;Parnassius&quot; (the Apollos), a distinctive group of many species, all of which are alpine and capable of living at high altitudes. Most &quot;Parnassius&quot; have two small reddish spots on their hindwings. The tribe Luehdorfiini contains the genera &quot;Archon&quot; of Asia minor and the genus &quot;Luehdorfia&quot; of China and Japan. These two tribes have evolved to change their food plants, while the third tribe, Zerynthiini, has retained the archetypical papilionid food plant, the lowland vine &quot;Aristolochia&quot;. Zerynthiini comprises four genera – &quot;Sericinus&quot;, &quot;Bhutanitis&quot;, &quot;Zerynthia&quot; and &quot;Allancastria&quot;.

Subfamily: Parnassiinae.
==== Papilioninae ====
The tribes recognized in the Papilioninae are Leptocircini, Teinopalpini, Troidini, and Papilionini.

Subfamily: Papilioninae.
==== Praepapilioninae ====
An additional subfamily, Praepapilioninae, consisting of a single genus &quot;Praepapilio&quot;, includes two species of extinct butterflies, each member being described from single fossils found in a middle Eocene deposit in Colorado, United States (Durden and Rose, 1978).

== Phylogeny ==
A phylogeny of the Papilionidae based on Nazari (2007) is given:
It is now accepted that the subfamily Papilioninae is monophyletic. The swallowtail butterflies in the nominate tribe Papilionini number about 225 species and studies have been made on their host plant coevolution and phylogeny. Old morphological classifications were also found to be valid in that they formed clusters. Species belonging to the groups that use Rutaceae as host plants formed two groups corresponding to Old World and American taxa. Those that fed on Lauraceae and Magnoliaceae were found to form another cluster which includes both Asian and American taxa.

The Parnassinae, like the Papilioninae, were also believed to be monophyletic based on morphological studies but recent studies based on both morphological and molecular characteristics suggest that this is not the case. Of the Parnassiinae, the genera &quot;Parnassius&quot; and &quot;Hypermnestra&quot; were found to be extremely close based on molecular studies
and are now considered to be part of the tribe Parnassiini. The two taxa, &quot;Archon&quot; and &quot;Luehdorfia&quot;, have been found to be closely related through analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, and, though they share no morphological similarities, have now been united in the tribe Luehdorfiini.

The subfamily Baroniinae is represented by the sole representative species &quot;Baronia brevicornis&quot;. They are unique in the family to use the Fabaceae (Leguminosae) as their larval host plants. The Baronninae and the extinct subfamily Praepapilioninae share many external similarities and are traditionally considered to be the most primitive subfamilies and sister to the rest of the swallowtails. Recent research suggests that this may not be the case, the Baroniinae being closely related to only the Parnassiinae, and &quot;Praepapilio&quot; to only the Papilionini and neither taxa being sister to the rest of the swallowtails.

== Distribution ==
As of 2005, 552 extant species have been identified which are distributed across the tropical and temperate regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;GloBIS/GART&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Various species inhabit altitudes ranging from sea level to high mountains, as in the case of most species of &quot;Parnassius&quot;. The majority of swallowtail species and the greatest diversity are found in the tropics and subtropical regions between 20°N and 20°S, particularly Southeast Asia, and between 20°N and 40°N in East Asia. Only 12 species are found in Europe and only one species, &quot;Papilio machaon&quot; is found in the British Isles. North America has 40 species, including several tropical species and &quot;Parnassius&quot;.

The northernmost swallowtail is the Siberian Apollo (&quot;Parnassius arcticus&quot;), found in the Arctic Circle in northeastern Yakutia, at altitudes of 1500 meters above sea level. In the Himalayas, various Apollo species such as &quot;Parnassius epaphus&quot;, have been found at altitudes of 6,000 meters above sea level.

== Food ==
The caterpillars of various swallowtail butterfly species feed on a wide range of different plants, most depending on only one of five families: Aristolochiaceae, Annonaceae, Lauraceae, Umbelliferae (Apiaceae) and Rutaceae. By eating some of these toxic plants, the caterpillars sequester aristolochic acid which renders both the caterpillars and the butterflies of some of these as toxic, thus protecting them from predators. Similarly, the &quot;Parnassius smintheus&quot; sequesters sarmentosin from its host plant &quot;Sedum lanceolatum&quot; for protection from predators. Swallowtail tribes Zerynthiini (Parnassiinae), Luehdorfiini (Parnassiinae) and Troidini (Papilioninae), almost exclusively use the family Aristolochiaceae as their host plants.

For example, the eastern black swallowtail&#x27;s (&quot;Papilio polyxenes&quot;) main host plant in the wild is Queen Anne&#x27;s lace, but they also eat garden plants in the carrot family, including carrots, parsley, dill, and fennel.

Adult swallowtails sip nectar, but also mud and sometimes manure.

== Life cycle ==
The detailed descriptions of morphological characteristics of the Papilionidae, as quoted in Bingham (1905) are as follows:

Stages of development of a papilionid, the giant swallowtail (&quot;Papilio cresphontes&quot;)

== Distinguishing characteristics ==
The key characteristics that differentiate the Papilionidae from the other butterfly families are:
* The osmeterium is a forked, fleshy eversible organ found in the prothoracic segment of caterpillars.
* Venation – in swallowtails, the second anal vein, 2A, extends up to the wing margin and does not link with the first anal vein, 1A. These veins are fused in other butterfly families and 2A does not reach the wing margin.
* The sclerites of the cervix (membranous neck between the head and thorax) are fused beneath the neck where the muscles for head movement are anchored.

== Special adaptations and defense ==
Swallowtail butterflies practice Batesian mimicry, a behavior in which the butterflies&#x27; appearance closely resemble that of distasteful species that prevents predation. Swallowtails differ from many animals that practice mimicry. The tiger swallowtail butterfly (&quot;Papilio glaucus&quot;), exhibits a female-limited polymorphism for Batesian mimicry and others, such as the Canadian tiger swallowtail (&quot;Papilio canadensis&quot;) do not display any form of mimicry.

Predators include the red-winged blackbird, Pennsylvania firefly, five-lined skink, green darner, goldenrod spider, Chinese mantis, fiery searcher, and striped skunk.

=== Biological basis for polymorphisms in mimicry ===
Not all individuals in some species are identical in appearance. For example, &quot;Papilio glaucus&quot; (eastern tiger swallowtail), Y-linkage determines whether the females are either wild-type (yellow and black) or melanic (dark melanin replaces the yellow background). This genetic difference stems from the fact that melanism is controlled by a single gene, which controls the level of dopamine in the organism. The enzyme BAS, which assists dopamine in producing the yellow pigmentation, normally found on the wings&#x27; background, is suppressed. Without the pigmentation, the butterfly appears mostly black (the melanic form) and is a Batesian mimic of &quot;Battus philenor&quot;, the pipevine swallowtail. There are also &quot;Papilio glaucus&quot; that are not wholly black; several possess an intermediate &quot;sooty&quot; color and are sensitive to temperature.

The different polymorphisms (wild-type, melanic, and the &#x27;sooty&#x27; intermediate) depend upon the geographical distribution and abundance of its mimic, the &quot;Battus philenor&quot;, whose wing color varies depending on its geographical location. In order to be successfully confused for the &quot;B. philenor&quot; by predators, the &quot;Papilio glaucus&#x27;s&quot; background wing color matches that of the &quot;B. philenor&quot; residing in the same regional area. Studies support this theory; in the southeastern United States, the relative abundance of melanic females has been found to geographically correlate with &quot;B. philenor&quot;.

=== Mimicry ===
Only certain subsets of swallowtails practice mimicry. Species differ in whether one or both sexes is mimetic, and whether the mimicry is monomorphic or polymorphic. A phenomenon which has received particular attention is female-limited polymorphism, in which only the females of a species are mimetic and polymorphic, often mimicking different, distantly-related aposematic butterflies. This polymorphism is seen in &quot;Papilio dardanus&quot;, the African swallowtail butterfly, whose females have three different morphs for wing color pattern: a black-and-white pattern for Batesian mimicry, a black-and-yellow pattern that resembles the males of the species, and a pattern with orange patches that resembles the elderly males of the species. Given that the males of the species, which do not have Batesian mimicry, are preyed upon much more frequently by predators than the females, an ongoing question is why females would exhibit the non-mimetic wing pattern, which would seemingly lower their fitness compared to the mimicry form. The pipevine swallowtail exhibits Batesian mimicry as well.

Several hypotheses for this phenomenon were made, the two noteworthy being the pseudosexual selection hypothesis and the male avoidance hypothesis. In the pseudosexual hypothesis, male butterflies aggressively approached the &quot;male&quot;-looking females and then mellowed their behavior into sexual behavior when they were close enough to identify them as females. In the male avoidance hypothesis, female butterflies disguise themselves in an attempt to evade male harassment, as courtship can be harmful, time-consuming, and attract predators.

One study recorded male responses to females of each morphs and found that the males consistently favored the Batesian mimics, then the black and yellow, and then the morph with orange patches. The scientists concluded that frequency-dependent selection did lead to equal success for all three alternative strategies: the Batesian females suffered the fewest predators but their fitness was reduced the most by sexual harassment, while the other two faced lower sexual harassment but also lost fitness from predators&#x27; attacks.

== Mating and young ==
After mating, the male &quot;Parnassines&quot; produce a glue-like substance that is used to seal the female genital opening and prevent other males from mating. They lay individual eggs on the underside of the leaves of their food plants. There is no parental investment once the eggs have been laid.

The pupae are typically attached to the substrate by the cremaster but with head up held by a silk girdle. The Apollos, however, pupate in debris on the ground and also build a loose cocoon. In the temperate regions, the winters are passed in a pupal diapause stage.

== In culture ==
Since swallowtail butterflies are large, colorful, and attractive, they have been targeted by butterfly collectors. The largest of these, the birdwing butterflies are particularly sought after and are cultured in butterfly farms to supply collectors.

Many members of the family, as larvae, feed on plants of the citrus family Rutaceae, making some of these attractive butterflies pests in citrus orchards.

The Oregon swallowtail is the state insect of Oregon. The eastern tiger swallowtail is the state insect of Virginia and the state butterfly of Georgia, Delaware, and South Carolina. The black swallowtail is the state butterfly of Oklahoma.

<text>MreB is a protein found in bacteria that has been identified as a homologue of actin, as indicated by similarities in tertiary structure and conservation of active site peptide sequence. The conservation of protein structure suggests the common ancestry of the cytoskeletal elements formed by actin, found in eukaryotes, and MreB, found in prokaryotes. Indeed, recent studies have found that MreB proteins polymerize to form filaments that are similar to actin microfilaments. It has been shown to form multilayer sheets comprising diagonally interwoven filaments in the presence of ATP or GTP.

MreB along with MreC and MreD are named after the mre operon (murein formation gene cluster E) to which they all belong.

== Function ==
MreB controls the width of rod-shaped bacteria, such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. A mutant &quot;E. coli&quot; that creates defective MreB proteins will be spherical instead of rod-like. Also, most bacteria that are naturally spherical do not have the gene encoding MreB. Members of the Chlamydiota are a notable exception, as these bacteria utilize the protein for localized septal peptidoglycan synthesis. Prokaryotes carrying the &quot;mreB&quot; gene can also be helical in shape. MreB has long been thought to form a helical filament underneath the cytoplasmic membrane, however, this model has been brought into question by three recent publications showing that filaments cannot be seen by electron cryotomography and that GFP-MreB can be seen as patches moving around the cell circumference. It has been shown to interact with several proteins that are proven to be involved in length growth (for instance PBP2). Therefore, it probably directs the synthesis and insertion of new peptidoglycan building units into the existing peptidoglycan layer to allow length growth of the bacteria.

<text>Julia Stimson Thorne (September 16, 1944 – April 27, 2006) was an American writer. She was the first wife of John Kerry, who was U.S. Senator during their marriage.

==Biography==
Thorne was born in New York City on September 16, 1944, the daughter of Alice (Barry) and Landon Ketchum Thorne Jr. Her maternal great-grandfather was journalist David S. Barry. Thorne spent much of her childhood in Rome where her father worked various jobs. She graduated from the Foxcroft School in 1962. She also took some classes at the New York School of Interior Design and at Radcliffe. 

Julia Thorne was a direct eleventh generation descendant of John Bowne, a defiant activist in the struggle for religious freedom. William Thorne Sr., third signatory of the Flushing Remonstrance is also an ancestor. Thorne was also a distant cousin of her husband John Kerry through their common ancestor Elizabeth Fones.

Thorne married John Kerry on May 23, 1970, and wore a dress that was over &quot;two centuries old.&quot; She and Kerry had two daughters together, Alexandra Forbes Kerry and Vanessa Bradford Kerry. During their marriage, Julia began showing signs of depression and later wrote that she had at one time contemplated suicide. In the 1980s, she created a nonprofit called the Depression Initiative to educate people about depression. Thorne and Kerry were divorced on July 25, 1988 after a six-year separation. She overcame depression by 1990, and by all accounts the two had an amicable relationship. She married Richard J. Charlesworth in 1997 and they moved to Bozeman, Montana. She continued to be supportive of Kerry&#x27;s run for president in 2004. Thorne died from cancer on April 27, 2006, in her home in Concord, Massachusetts.

== Books ==
Her book, &quot;You Are Not Alone: Words of Experience and Hope for the Journey Through Depression&quot; (1993) (with Larry Rothstein) () collects accounts of different people who have faced depression. Ann Landers wrote that &quot;this little book could be a lifesaver and the best $10 you will ever spend.&quot; 

&quot;A Change of Heart: Words of Experience and Hope for the Journey Through Divorce&quot; (1996) ()

<doc id="501183" wikidata="Q24773445" url="?curid=501183" title="FtsZ">
<text>FtsZ is a protein encoded by the &quot;ftsZ&quot; gene that assembles into a ring at the future site of bacterial cell division (also called the Z ring). FtsZ is a prokaryotic homologue of the eukaryotic protein tubulin. The initials FtsZ mean &quot;Filamenting temperature-sensitive mutant Z.&quot; The hypothesis was that cell division mutants of &quot;E. coli&quot; would grow as filaments due to the inability of the daughter cells to separate from one another. FtsZ is found in almost all bacteria, many archaea, all chloroplasts and some mitochondria, where it is essential for cell division. FtsZ assembles the cytoskeletal scaffold of the Z ring that, along with additional proteins, constricts to divide the cell in two.

== History ==
In the 1960s scientists screened for temperature sensitive mutations that blocked cell division at 42 °C. The mutant cells divided normally at 30°, but failed to divide at 42°. Continued growth without division produced long filamentous cells (Filamenting temperature sensitive). Several such mutants were discovered and mapped to a locus originally named &quot;ftsA,&quot; which could be one or more genes&quot;.&quot; In 1980 Lutkenhaus and Donachie showed that several of these mutations mapped to one gene, &quot;ftsA,&quot; but one well-characterized mutant, PAT84, originally discovered by Hirota et al, mapped to a separate, adjacent gene. They named this cell division gene &quot;ftsZ.&quot; In 1991 Bi and Lutkenhaus used immunogold electron microscopy to show that FtsZ localized to the invaginating septum at midcell. Subsequently, the Losick and Margolin groups used immuno-fluorescence microscopy and GFP fusions to show that FtsZ assembled Z rings early in the cell cycle, well before the septum began to constrict. Other division proteins then assemble onto the Z ring and constriction occurs in the last part of the cell cycle.

In 1992-3 three labs independently discovered that FtsZ was related to eukaryotic tubulin, which is the protein subunit that assembles into microtubules. This was the first discovery that bacteria have homologs of eukaryotic cytoskeletal proteins. Later work showed that FtsZ was present in, and essential for, cell division in almost all bacteria and in many but not all archaea.

Mitochondria and chloroplasts are eukaryotic organelles that originated as bacterial endosymbionts, so there was much interest in whether they use FtsZ for division. Chloroplast FtsZ was first discovered by Osteryoung, and it is now known that all chloroplasts use FtsZ for division. Mitochondrial FtsZ was discovered by Beech in an alga; FtsZ is used for mitochondrial division in some eukaryotes, while others have replaced it with a dynamin-based machinery.

In 2014, scientists identified two FtsZ homologs in archaea, FtsZ1 and FtsZ2. 

== Function ==
During cell division, FtsZ is the first protein to move to the division site, and is essential for recruiting other proteins that produce a new cell wall (septum) between the dividing cells. FtsZ&#x27;s role in cell division is analogous to that of actin in eukaryotic cell division, but, unlike the actin-myosin ring in eukaryotes, FtsZ has no known motor protein associated with it. Cell wall synthesis may externally push the cell membrane, providing the force for cytokinesis. Supporting this, in &quot;E. coli&quot; the rate of division is affected by mutations in cell wall synthesis. Alternatively, FtsZ may pull the membrane from the inside based on Osawa (2009) showing the protein&#x27;s contractile force on liposomes with no other proteins present.

Erickson (2009) proposed how the roles of tubulin-like proteins and actin-like proteins in cell division became reversed in an evolutionary mystery. The use of the FtsZ ring in dividing chloroplasts and some mitochondria further establishes their prokaryotic ancestry. L-form bacteria that lack a cell wall do not require FtsZ for division, which implies that bacteria may have retained components of an ancestral mode of cell division.

Much is known about the dynamic polymerization activities of tubulin and microtubules, but little is known about these activities in FtsZ. While it is known that single-stranded tubulin protofilaments form into 13 stranded microtubules, the multistranded structure of the FtsZ-containing Z-ring is not known. It is only speculated that the structure consists of overlapping protofilaments. Nevertheless, recent work with purified FtsZ on supported lipid bilayers as well as imaging FtsZ in living bacterial cells revealed that FtsZ protofilaments have polarity and move in one direction by treadmilling (see also below).

Recently, proteins similar to tubulin and FtsZ have been discovered in large plasmids found in &quot;Bacillus&quot; species. They are believed to function as components of segrosomes, which are multiprotein complexes that partition chromosomes/plasmids in bacteria. The plasmid homologs of tubulin/FtsZ seem to have conserved the ability to polymerize into filaments.

=== The contractile ring (the &quot;Z ring&quot;) ===
FtsZ has the ability to bind to GTP and also exhibits a GTPase domain that allows it to hydrolyze GTP to GDP and a phosphate group. &quot;In vivo&quot;, FtsZ forms filaments with a repeating arrangement of subunits, all arranged head-to-tail. These filaments form a ring around the longitudinal midpoint, or septum, of the cell. This ring is called the Z-ring.

The GTP hydrolyzing activity of the protein is not essential to the formation of filaments or cell division. Mutants defective in GTPase activity often still divide, but sometimes form twisted and disordered septa. It is unclear as to whether FtsZ actually provides the physical force that results in division or serves as a scaffold for other proteins to execute division.

There are two models for how FtsZ might generate a constriction force. One model is based on the observation that FtsZ protfilaments can be straight or curved. The transition from straight to curved is suggested to generate a bending force on the membrane. Another model is based on sliding protofilaments. Computer models and &quot;in vivo&quot; measurements suggest that single FtsZ filaments cannot sustain a length more than 30 subunits long. In this model, FtsZ scission force comes from the relative lateral movement of subunits. Lines of FtsZ would line up together parallel and pull on each other creating a &quot;cord&quot; of many strings that tightens itself.

In other models, FtsZ does not provide the contractile force but provides the cell a spatial scaffold for other proteins to execute the division of the cell. This is akin to the creating of a temporary structure by construction workers to access hard-to-reach places of a building. The temporary structure allows unfettered access and ensures that the workers can reach all places. If the temporary structure is not correctly built, the workers will not be able to reach certain places, and the building will be deficient.

The scaffold theory is supported by information that shows that the formation of the ring and localization to the membrane requires the concerted action of a number of accessory proteins. ZipA or the actin homologue FtsA permit initial FtsZ localization to the membrane. Following localization to the membrane, division proteins of the Fts family are recruited for ring assembly. Many of these proteins direct the synthesis of the new division septum at midcell (FtsI, FtsW), or regulate the activity of this synthesis (FtsQ, FtsL, FtsB, FtsN). The timing of Z-ring formation suggests the possibility of a spatial or temporal signal that permits the formation of FtsZ filaments.

Recent super-resolution imaging in several species supports a dynamic scaffold model, in which small clusters of FtsZ protofilaments or protofilament bundles move unidirectionally around the ring&#x27;s circumference by treadmilling, anchored to the membrane by FtsA and other FtsZ-specific membrane tethers. The speed of treadmilling depends on the rate of GTP hydrolysis within the FtsZ protofilaments, but in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, synthesis of the division septum remains the rate limiting step for cytokinesis. The treadmilling action of FtsZ is required for proper synthesis of the division septum by septal peptidoglycan synthesis enzymes, suggesting that these enzymes can track the growing ends of the filaments.

=== Septal localization and intracellular signaling ===

The formation of the Z-ring closely coincides with cellular processes associated with replication. Z-ring formation coincides with the termination of genome replication in &quot;E. coli&quot; and 70% of chromosomal replication in &quot;B. subtilis&quot;. The timing of Z-ring formation suggests the possibility of a spatial or temporal signal that permits the formation of FtsZ filaments. In &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, at least two negative regulators of FtsZ assembly form a bipolar gradient, such that the concentration of active FtsZ required for FtsZ assembly is highest at mid-cell between the two segregating chromosomes, and lowest at the poles and over the chromosomes. This type of regulation seems to occur in other species such as &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; and &quot;Caulobacter crescentus&quot;. However, other species including &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; and &quot;Myxococcus xanthus&quot; seem to use positive regulators that stimulate FtsZ assembly at mid-cell.

=== Communicating distress ===

FtsZ polymerization is also linked to stressors like DNA damage. DNA damage induces a variety of proteins to be manufactured, one of them called SulA. SulA prevents the polymerization and GTPase activity of FtsZ. SulA accomplishes this task by binding to self-recognizing FtsZ sites. By sequestering FtsZ, the cell can directly link DNA damage to inhibiting cell division.

=== Preventing DNA damage ===

Like SulA, there are other mechanisms that prevent cell division that would result in disrupted genetic information sent to daughter cells. So far, two proteins have been identified in &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;B. subtilis&quot; that prevent division over the nucleoid region: Noc and SlmA. Noc gene knockouts result in cells that divide without respect to the nucleoid region, resulting in its asymmetrical partitioning between the daughter cells. The mechanism is not well understood, but thought to involve sequestration of FtsZ, preventing polymerization over the nucleoid region. The mechanism used by SlmA to inhibit FtsZ polymerization over the nucleoid is better understood, and uses two separate steps. One domain of SlmA binds to a FtsZ polymer, then a separate domain of SlmA severs the polymer. A similar mechanism is thought to be used by MinC, another inhibitor of FtsZ polymerization involved in positioning of the FtsZ ring.

== Clinical significance ==

The number of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains is currently increasing; thus, the determination of drug targets for the development of novel antimicrobial drugs is urgently needed. The potential role of FtsZ in the blockage of cell division, together with its high degree of conservation across bacterial species, makes FtsZ a highly attractive target for developing novel antibiotics. Researchers have been working on synthetic molecules and natural products as inhibitors of FtsZ. 

The spontaneous self-assembly of FtsZ can also be used in nanotechnology to fabricate metal nanowires.

<text>The Mississippi Sea Wolves were a professional hockey team based in Biloxi, Mississippi, and play in the Mississippi Coast Coliseum. The Sea Wolves were members of the ECHL.

The Sea Wolves were founded in 1996 and had considerable success over their 10 seasons in the ECHL. They reached the playoffs in five of their first seven years and a league championship in 1999, when they defeated the Richmond Renegades in a best-of-seven series to claim the Kelly Cup.

Damages from Hurricane Katrina to the Mississippi Coast Coliseum forced the team to suspend operations for the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons under the ECHL&#x27;s hardship provisions. Hurricane Katrina resulted in extensive damage to the team’s home arena, including flood damage to team offices, locker rooms, ice-making equipment, and two Zambonis. During the 2006–07 ECHL All-Star Game, the league officially confirmed the Sea Wolves would return in 2007–08.

On March 30, 2009, the Sea Wolves announced that the organization would be suspending operations again for the 2009–10 season, but a little more than a month later the team&#x27;s management announced that professional hockey would continue to be played on the Mississippi Gulf Coast in the form of the Mississippi Surge in the Southern Professional Hockey League. The Surge played at the Coast Coliseum from the 2009–10 season through 2013–14.

In 2021, the Federal Prospects Hockey League hosted three neutral site games in Biloxi. Biloxi Pro Hockey sold 20,163 tickets in the month of December and an announcement was made on December 30 that a new Sea Wolves team would return in 2022. The new team began play in the 2022–23 FPHL season.

<text>Mucus (, ) is a slippery aqueous secretion produced by, and covering, mucous membranes. It is typically produced from cells found in mucous glands, although it may also originate from mixed glands, which contain both serous and mucous cells. It is a viscous colloid containing inorganic salts, antimicrobial enzymes (such as lysozymes), immunoglobulins (especially IgA), and glycoproteins such as lactoferrin and mucins, which are produced by goblet cells in the mucous membranes and submucosal glands. Mucus serves to protect epithelial cells in the linings of the respiratory, digestive, and urogenital systems, and structures in the visual and auditory systems from pathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses. Most of the mucus in the body is produced in the gastrointestinal tract.

Amphibians, fish, snails, slugs, and some other invertebrates also produce external mucus from their epidermis as protection against pathogens, to help in movement, and to line fish gills. Plants produce a similar substance called mucilage that is also produced by some microorganisms.

==Respiratory system==

In the human respiratory system, mucus is part of the airway surface liquid (ASL), also known as epithelial lining fluid (ELF), that lines most of the respiratory tract. The airway surface liquid consists of a &quot;sol&quot; layer termed the periciliary liquid layer and an overlying &quot;gel&quot; layer termed the mucus layer. The periciliary liquid layer is so named as it surrounds the cilia and lies on top of the surface epithelium. The periciliary liquid layer surrounding the cilia consists of a gel meshwork of cell-tethered mucins and polysaccharides. The mucus blanket aids in the protection of the lungs by trapping foreign particles before they can enter them, in particular through the nose during normal breathing.

Mucus is made up of a fluid component of around 95% water, the mucin secretions from the goblet cells, and the submucosal glands (2–3% glycoproteins), proteoglycans (0.1–0.5%), lipids (0.3–0.5%), proteins, and DNA. The major mucins secreted – MUC5AC and MUC5B - are large polymers that give the mucus its rheologic or viscoelastic properties. MUC5AC is the main gel-forming mucin secreted by goblet cells, in the form of threads and thin sheets. MUC5B is a polymeric protein secreted from submucosal glands and some goblet cells, and this is in the form of strands.

In the airways—the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles—the lining of mucus is produced by specialized airway epithelial cells called goblet cells, and submucosal glands. Small particles such as dust, particulate pollutants, and allergens, as well as infectious agents and bacteria are caught in the viscous nasal or airway mucus and prevented from entering the system. This process, together with the continual movement of the cilia on the respiratory epithelium toward the oropharynx (mucociliary clearance), helps prevent foreign objects from entering the lungs during breathing. This explains why coughing often occurs in those who smoke cigarettes. The body&#x27;s natural reaction is to increase mucus production. In addition, mucus aids in moisturizing the inhaled air and prevents tissues such as the nasal and airway epithelia from drying out.

Mucus is produced continuously in the respiratory tract. Mucociliary action carries it down from the nasal passages and up from the rest of the tract to the pharynx, with most of it being swallowed subconsciously. Sometimes in times of respiratory illness or inflammation, mucus can become thickened with cell debris, bacteria, and inflammatory cells. It is then known as phlegm which may be coughed up as sputum to clear the airway.

===Respiratory tract===

Increased mucus production in the upper respiratory tract is a symptom of many common ailments, such as the common cold, and influenza. Nasal mucus may be removed by blowing the nose or by using nasal irrigation. Excess nasal mucus, as with a cold or allergies, due to vascular engorgement associated with vasodilation and increased capillary permeability caused by histamines, may be treated cautiously with decongestant medications. Thickening of mucus as a &quot;rebound&quot; effect following overuse of decongestants may produce nasal or sinus drainage problems and circumstances that promote infection.

During cold, dry seasons, the mucus lining nasal passages tends to dry out, meaning that mucous membranes must work harder, producing more mucus to keep the cavity lined. As a result, the nasal cavity can fill up with mucus. At the same time, when air is exhaled, water vapor in breath condenses as the warm air meets the colder outside temperature near the nostrils. This causes an excess amount of water to build up inside nasal cavities. In these cases, the excess fluid usually spills out externally through the nostrils.
In the lower respiratory tract impaired mucociliary clearance due to conditions such as primary ciliary dyskinesia may result in mucus accumulation in the bronchi. The dysregulation of mucus homeostasis is the fundamental characteristic of cystic fibrosis, an inherited disease caused by mutations in the &quot;CFTR&quot; gene, which encodes a chloride channel. This defect leads to the altered electrolyte composition of mucus, which triggers its hyperabsorption and dehydration. Such low-volume, viscous, acidic mucus has a reduced antimicrobial function, which facilitates bacterial colonisation. The thinning of the mucus layer ultimately affects the periciliary liquid layer, which becomes dehydrated, compromising ciliary function, and impairing mucociliary clearance. A respiratory therapist can recommend airway clearance therapy which uses a number of clearance techniques to help with the clearance of mucus.

====Mucus hypersecretion====
In the lower respiratory tract excessive mucus production in the bronchi and bronchioles is known as mucus hypersecretion. Chronic mucus hypersecretion results in the chronic productive cough of chronic bronchitis, and is generally synonymous with this. Excessive mucus can narrow the airways, limit airflow, and accelerate a decline in lung function.

==Digestive system==
In the human digestive system, mucus is used as a lubricant for materials that must pass over membranes, e.g., food passing down the esophagus. Mucus is extremely important in the gastrointestinal tract. It forms an essential layer in the colon and in the small intestine that helps reduce intestinal inflammation by decreasing bacterial interaction with intestinal epithelial cells. The layer of mucus of the gastric mucosa lining the stomach is vital to protect the stomach lining from the highly acidic environment within it.

==Reproductive system==
In the human female reproductive system, cervical mucus prevents infection and provides lubrication during sexual intercourse. The consistency of cervical mucus varies depending on the stage of a woman&#x27;s menstrual cycle. At ovulation cervical mucus is clear, runny, and conducive to sperm; post-ovulation, mucus becomes thicker and is more likely to block sperm. Several fertility awareness methods rely on observation of cervical mucus, as one of three primary fertility signs, to identify a woman&#x27;s fertile time at the mid-point of the cycle. Awareness of the woman&#x27;s fertile time allows a couple to time intercourse to improve the odds of pregnancy. It is also proposed as a method to avoid pregnancy.

==Clinical significance==
In general, nasal mucus is clear and thin, serving to filter air during inhalation. During times of infection, mucus can change color to yellow or green either as a result of trapped bacteria or due to the body&#x27;s reaction to viral infection. For example, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; infection may turn the mucus yellow. The green color of mucus comes from the heme group in the iron-containing enzyme myeloperoxidase secreted by white blood cells as a cytotoxic defense during a respiratory burst.

In the case of bacterial infection, the bacterium becomes trapped in already-clogged sinuses, breeding in the moist, nutrient-rich environment. Sinusitis is an uncomfortable condition that may include congestion of mucus. A bacterial infection in sinusitis will cause discolored mucus and would respond to antibiotic treatment; viral infections typically resolve without treatment. Almost all sinusitis infections are viral and antibiotics are ineffective and not recommended for treating typical cases.

In the case of a viral infection such as cold or flu, the first stage and also the last stage of the infection cause the production of a clear, thin mucus in the nose or back of the throat. As the body begins to react to the virus (generally one to three days), mucus thickens and may turn yellow or green. 

Obstructive lung diseases often result from impaired mucociliary clearance that can be associated with mucus hypersecretion, and these are sometimes referred to as &quot;mucoobstructive lung diseases&quot;. Techniques of airway clearance therapy can help to clear secretions, maintain respiratory health, and prevent inflammation in the airways.

A unique umbilical cord lining epithelial stem cell expresses MUC1, termed (CLEC-muc). This has been shown to have good potential in the regeneration of the cornea.

== Properties of mucus ==
=== Tunable swelling capacity ===
Mucus is able to absorb water or dehydrate through pH variations. The swelling capacity of mucus stems from the bottlebrush structure of mucin within which hydrophilic segments provide a large surface area for water absorption. Moreover, the tunability of swelling effect is controlled by polyelectrolyte effect.

==== Polyelectrolyte effect in mucus ====
Polymers with charged molecules are called polyelectrolytes. Mucins, a kind of polyelectrolyte proteoglycans, are the main component of mucus, which provides the polyelectrolyte effect in mucus. The process of inducing this effect comprises two steps: attraction of counter-ions and water compensation. When exposed in physiological ionic solution, the charged groups in the polyelectrolytes attract counter-ions with opposite charges, thereby leading to a solute concentration gradient. An osmotic pressure is introduced to equalize the concentration of solute throughout the system by driving water to flow from the low concentration areas to the high concentration areas. In short, the influx and outflux of water within mucus, managed by the polyelectrolyte effect, contribute to mucus&#x27; tunable swelling capacity.

==== Mechanism of pH-tunable swelling ====
The ionic charges of mucin are mainly provided by acidic amino acids including aspartic acid (pKa=3.9) and glutamic acid (pKa=4.2). The charges of acidic amino acids will change with environmental pH value due to acid dissociation and association. Aspartic acid, for example, has a negative side chain when the pH value is above 3.9, while a neutrally charged side chain will be introduced as pH value drops below 3.9. Thus, the number of negative charges in mucus is influenced by the pH value of surrounding environment. That is, the polyelectrolyte effect of mucus is largely affected by the pH value of solution due to the charge variation of acidic amino acid residues on the mucin backbone. For instance, the charged residue on mucin is protonated at a normal pH value of the stomach, approximately pH 2. In this case, there is scarcely polyelectrolyte effect, thereby causing compact mucus with little swelling capacity. However, a kind of bacteria, &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, is prone to producing base to elevate the pH value in stomach, leading to the deprotonation of aspartic acids and glutamic acids, i.e., from neutral to negative-charged. The negative charges in the mucus greatly increase, thus inducing the polyelectrolyte effect and the swelling of the mucus. This swelling effect increases the pore size of the mucus and decreases mucus&#x27; viscosity, which allows bacteria to penetrate and migrate into the mucus and cause disease.

=== Charge selectivity ===
The high selective permeability of mucus plays a crucial role in the healthy state of human beings by limiting the penetration of molecules, nutrients, pathogens, and drugs. The charge distribution within mucus serves as a charge selective diffusion barrier, thus significantly affecting the transportation of agents. Among particles with various surface zeta potentials, cationic particles tend to have a low depth of penetration, neutral ones possess medium penetration, and anionic ones have the largest penetration depth. Furthermore, the effect of charge selectivity changes when the status of the mucus varies, i.e., native mucus has a threefold higher potential to limit agent penetration than purified mucus.

==Other animals==
Mucus is also produced by a number of other animals. All fish are covered in mucus secreted from glands all over their bodies. Invertebrates such as snails and slugs secrete mucus called snail slime to enable movement, and to prevent their bodies from drying out. Their reproductive systems also make use of mucus for example in the covering of their eggs. In the unique mating ritual of &quot;Limax maximus&quot; the mating slugs lower themselves from elevated locations by a mucus thread. Mucus is an essential constituent of hagfish slime used to deter predators. Mucus is produced by the endostyle in some tunicates and larval lampreys to help in filter feeding.

<text>In legislative procedure, a rider is an additional provision added to a bill or other measure under the consideration by a legislature, which may or may not have much, if any, connection with the subject matter of the bill.

Some scholars identify riders as a specific form of logrolling, or as implicit logrolling. Others distinguish riders from logrolling. Adding riders to legislation is not permitted in legislatures bound by a single-subject rule.

==United States==

=== Federal legislation ===
In the U.S. Congress, riders have been a traditional method for members of Congress to advance controversial measures without building coalitions specifically in support of them, allowing the measure to move through the legislative process: &quot;By combining measures, the legislative leadership can force members to accept a measure that might not survive alone because they want the entire bill to pass.&quot; Since the 1980s, however, omnibus bills have become more common: these bills contain provisions, sometime important provisions, on an array of policy areas, and &quot;are powerful for focusing attention away from controversial items to other main items&quot; that either have broad support or are viewed as necessary, &quot;must-pass&quot; measures (such as appropriation bills). While members of Congress often use riders to attempt to kill a piece of legislation, &quot;omnibus bills are pursued in order to get something passed.&quot; The phrase &quot;and for other purposes&quot; is frequently included within bills, even if a rider is not initially attached, so as to permit riders unrelated to the original legislation to be added later.

When the veto is an all-or-nothing power as it is in the United States Constitution, the executive must either accept the riders or reject the entire bill. The practical consequence of the custom of using riders is to constrain the veto power of the executive.

The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 was passed to allow the President of the United States to veto single objectionable items within bills passed by Congress, but the Supreme Court struck down the act as unconstitutional in &quot;Clinton v. City of New York&quot;.

Riders may be unrelated to the subject matter of bills to which they are attached and are commonly used to introduce unpopular provisions. For example, a rider to stop net neutrality was attached to a bill relating to military and veteran construction projects. Another rider has been the Hyde Amendment which since 1976 has been attached to Appropriation Bills to prevent Medicaid paying for most abortions. Another was the Boland Amendment in 1982 and 1983 to restrict financing of the Contras in Nicaragua.

A recent notable example of a rider was in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. An amended version of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010 that was signed into law by Barack Obama only one week before, the amended bill included a rider for the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, whose student loan reform was completely unrelated to the broader bill&#x27;s primary focus on health care reform.

=== State legislation ===
Riders exist at the state level as well. For just one example, a 2005 bill in West Virginia that was primarily focused on limiting the number of members that cities can appoint to boards of parks and recreation unexpectedly included a rider that made the English language the official language of the state of West Virginia. Most members of the West Virginia Legislature did not realize that the rider had been entered into the bill until it had already passed both state houses. Then-West Virginia governor Joe Manchin, although a personal supporter of the English-only movement, promptly vetoed the bill due to a provision in the Constitution of West Virginia that limits bills to one topic, which also makes riders &quot;de facto&quot; unconstitutional in West Virginia. To counteract riders, 43 of the 50 U.S. states have provisions in their state constitutions allowing the use of line item vetoes so that the executive can veto single objectionable items within a bill, without affecting the main purpose or effectiveness of the bill.

==Europe==

=== France ===
The Constitutional Council of France has taken an increasingly hard view against riders, which it considers unconstitutional and contrary to the rules of procedure of the parliamentary assemblies. In 1985 the Council started striking down amendment to laws because they were unrelated to the subject of the law. Two special categories of riders merit mention: the &quot;budgetary riders&quot;, attached to budget bills, and &quot;social riders&quot;, attached to the budget bill for social security organizations, clauses that have no link to the budget or to the social security budgets, respectively.

=== Greece ===
Greece&#x27;s constitutional provisions regarding parliamentary procedure forbid the parliamentary discussion of bills containing unrelated topics. Specifically, article 74, paragraph 5 of the Greek Constitution stipulates that a) a bill that contains provisions unrelated to its main subject is not introduced for discussion, and b) additions or amendments unrelated to the bill&#x27;s main subject are not introduced for discussion.

=== Hungary ===
In 2005, the Constitutional Court of Hungary struck down the yearly national budget law in its entirety, because almost half of the paragraphs were not related to state fiscals at all, but modified 44 other existing pieces of legislation, which concerned health regulations, public education and foreign relations. This judicial ruling restricted the government&#x27;s future options in bypassing due parliamentary debate and imposing certain reforms unilaterally.

=== United Kingdom ===
In some legislative systems, such as the British Parliament, riders are prevented by the existence of the long title of a bill that describes the full purpose of the bill. Any part of the bill that falls outside the scope of the long title would not be permitted. However, legislators often bypass this limitation by naming a bill vaguely, such as by appending &quot;and for connected purposes&quot; to the name.

=== The Czech Republic ===
Both Chamber of Deputies of The Czech Republic and Senate of The Czech Republic should respect the principles of transparent governance, and should be scrutinised by the opposition and the general public. Their final decision should follow a long and public debate on the subject of regulation. In The Czech Republic, however, this parliamentary principle is often violated by complex amendments to bills and so-called wild riders, amendments that are not substantively related to the bill in question.

In The Czech Republic, acceptance of legislative additions is contrary to the Constitution of the Czech Republic and the legislative procedure established by the Law of the Czech Republic. According to the conclusion of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic in its ruling Pl.ÚS 21/01, the legislative practice, when a single law amends several laws that are not directly related to each other in terms of content, does not correspond with the purpose and principles of the legislative process. Such a procedure would create an unclear legal situation which contradicts the fundamental principles of the rule of law. The basic principles of the rule of law are the principles of the predictability of the law, its comprehensibility, clarity and internal consistency, i.e. the coherence and unity of the legal order. The principle of the democratic rule of law is regulated by Articles 1 and 2 of the Constitution of the Czech Republic. According to Article 2(3), &quot;&#x27;State power shall be at the service of all citizens and may be exercised only in the cases, within the limits and in the manner prescribed by the law&quot;&#x27;.

Up to date, there is no legislative regulation to prevent the practice of legislative riders. However, there are safeguards that should prevent the practice of wild riders. One of these safeguards is The Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic itself, whose role under Section 68(2) of The Constitutional Court Act of the Czech Republic is to determine whether a bill has been adopted and passed in a constitutionally-conforming manner. The Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic has taken hard view against wild riders. According to the conclusion of The Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic in its rulings Pl.ÚS 21/01 and Pl.ÚS 77/06, wild riders are unconstitutional and contrary to the law of legislative procedure and its principles.

==== PL. ÚS 21/01: Budget Case ====
What occurred in this particular budget case is that several statutes were simultaneously amended by a single statute, and among these amended statutes was an act on the State Budget. The Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic stated that the practice by which several diverse statutes are simultaneously amended by the adoption of a single statute is a relatively common one in legislative practice, and that this practice is in principle constitutionally conforming, but only in the case that the amended statutes bear mutual substantive connection to each other.  However, in this case, the amended laws were not bearing any direct substantive connection to each other and were amended by a single act. Such practice, according to The Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic, must be designated as an undesirable phenomenon, and one not corresponding to the purpose and principles of the legislative process. The Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic further stated that the Rules of Procedure of the Chamber of Deputies regulate the discussion of the act on the State Budget, according to which &quot;&#x27;The Act on the State Budget may not provide for changes, amendments or cancellations or other acts of law.&quot;&#x27; 

==== PL. ÚS 77/06: Legislative Riders ====
As far as the issue of legislative riders is concerned, this ruling of The Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic is considered to be the most significant. In this case, The Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic had to assess whether the proposed amendment submitted by MP Michal Doktor concerned the same subject as the bill which was under consideration in the legislative process. The Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic deemed necessary to distinguish two types of proposed amendments. The first type of proposed amendment has long been designated in American doctrine as &quot;legislative riders&quot;, which is considered to be a constitutionally-conforming form of proposed amendment.  However, the second type, called &quot;wild riders&quot;, is a technique in which a legislative scheme from an entirely different statute is attached to the bill in the form of a proposed amendment. The rule of close relation (the germaneness rule) has been applied. In other words, it tests the issue as to whether, in this particular case, a proposed amendment was a proper amendment or whether it was a wild rider. In this ruling, The Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic concluded that it takes a distinctly negative view of wild riders, especially because of their potential negative impact on the principles of the democratic rule of law, which are threatened by wild riders, which turned out to be crucial as a reference for future cases concerning wild riders.

==Philippines==
The Congress of the Philippines is prohibited to add riders in bills. According to Article VI, Section 26(1) of the Constitution of the Philippines, bills must espouse a particular subject which has to be conveyed in the title thereof.

==Examples==
* CISA Act (2015)
* REAL ID Act (2005)
* Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act (2003)
* Lautenberg Amendment
* Hyde Amendment
* The rider &quot;Confirmation of antitrust status of graduate medical resident matching programs&quot; was attached to the Pension Funding Equity Act and gave the Association of American Medical Colleges a victory in the antitrust case Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges.

<doc id="501193" wikidata="Q683263" url="?curid=501193" title="New Living Translation">
<text>The New Living Translation (NLT) is a translation of the Bible in contemporary English. Published in 1996 by Tyndale House Foundation, the NLT was created &quot;by 90 leading Bible scholars.&quot; The NLT relies on recently published critical editions of the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts.

The origin of the NLT came from a project aiming to revise &quot;The Living Bible&quot; (TLB). This effort eventually led to the creation of the NLT—a new translation separate from the LB. The first NLT edition retains some text of the LB, but these are less evident in text revisions that have been published since.

== Translation philosophy ==
The &quot;New Living Translation&quot; used translators from a variety of Christian denominations. The method combined an attempt to translate the original texts simply and literally with a dynamic equivalence synergy approach used to convey the thoughts behind the text where a literal translation may have been difficult to understand or even misleading to modern readers. A part of the reasoning behind adapting the language for accessibility is the premise that more people will hear the Bible read aloud in a church service than are likely to read it or study it on their own.

It has been suggested that this &quot;thought-for-thought&quot; methodology, while making the translation easier to understand, is less accurate than a literal (formal equivalence) method, and thus the &quot;New Living Translation&quot; may not be suitable for those wishing to undertake detailed study of the Bible.

== Textual basis ==
The Old Testament translation was based on the Masoretic Text (Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia) and was further compared to other sources such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, Septuagint, Greek manuscripts, Samaritan Pentateuch, Syriac Peshitta, and Latin Vulgate. The New Testament translation was based on the two standard editions of the Greek New Testament (the UBS 4th revised edition and the Nestle-Aland Novum Testamentum Graece 27th edition).

== Translation history ==

Work on this revision began in 1989 with ninety translators; it was published in July 1996, 25 years after the publication of &quot;The Living Bible&quot;. Advanced reader copies of the Epistle to the Romans were originally printed as the &quot;New Living Version&quot;, but eventually renamed the New Living Translation to avoid confusion between this new work and &quot;The Living Bible&quot;. NLV is still used to identify the New Living Translation in ONIX for Books. Soon after that, a new revision was begun and The Second Edition of the NLT (also called the NLTse) was released in 2004. A revision in 2007 comprised mostly minor textual or footnote changes. Other revisions were released in 2013 and 2015 with minor changes throughout.

In 2016, Tyndale House Publishers, the Conference of Catholic Bishops of India Commission for Bible, ATC Publishers Bengaluru, and twelve Biblical scholars collaborated to prepare a New Living Translation Catholic Edition. After reviewing the changes introduced in the Catholic edition, Tyndale subsequently approved and adopted the Indian Bishops&#x27; edits into the main body of the 2015 edition, where they appear in all subsequent editions, Protestant and Catholic alike.

== Translation properties ==
The New Living Translation is (according to its publisher) intended to be easily accessible to readers of modern English. As part of this effort:
* Weights and measures, money, dates and times, etc., are described in modern terms, with footnotes giving the literal translation. For example, John 6:7 reads: &quot;Philip replied, &#x27;Even if we worked for months, we wouldn&#x27;t have enough money to feed them, with a note that the Greek text reads &quot;Two hundred denarii would not be enough&quot; and an explanation that a denarius was equivalent to a laborer&#x27;s full day&#x27;s wage.
* Some phrases are translated into contemporary English; e.g. &quot;they beat their breasts&quot; (Luke 23:48) is translated as &quot;They went home in deep sorrow&quot;, again with footnotes providing more literal interpretations.
* Gender-inclusive language is used where the editors believed that it was appropriate, thus () is translated &quot;brothers and sisters&quot;.

== Circulation ==
In July 2008, the NLT gained the No. 1 spot in unit sales, unseating the NIV for the first time in over two decades. According to the Christian Booksellers Association (as of March 2014), the NLT is the second most popular Bible translation based on unit sales, and the fourth most popular based on sales numbers.

A Roman Catholic edition of the NLT with the Deuterocanon was published by ATC Publications in Bangalore, India. The NLT Catholic Edition (NLTCE) was granted an imprimatur by Oswald Cardinal Gracias, Archbishop of Bombay and President of the Council of Catholic Bishops of India. It was later released in North America as the &quot;Catholic Holy Bible Reader&#x27;s Edition&quot; on October 17, 2017. Although the imprimatur does not extend to use of the NLTCE in the liturgy, it has been officially approved by the Catholic Church for private study and devotional use.

The NLT is available in numerous editions as well as numerous study Bible editions, including: &quot;The Life Application Study Bible&quot;, &quot;The Life Recovery Bible&quot;, &quot;The NLT Study Bible&quot;, and the &quot;NLT Illustrated Study Bible&quot;. The Cornerstone Biblical Commentary series uses the second-edition NLT text as its base. In June 2017, the &quot;Africa Study Bible&quot;, edited by Africa International University dean John Jusu, was offered to African English readers.

<doc id="501202" wikidata="Q616953" url="?curid=501202" title="Association of American Railroads">
<text>The Association of American Railroads (AAR) is an industry trade group representing primarily the major freight railroads of North America (Canada, Mexico and the United States). Amtrak and some regional commuter railroads are also members. Smaller freight railroads are typically represented by the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association (ASLRRA), although some smaller railroads and railroad holding companies are also members of the AAR. The AAR also has two associate programs, and most associates are suppliers to the railroad industry.

==Creation==
AAR was created October 12, 1934, by the merger of five industry-related groups:
* The American Railway Association
* The Association of Railway Executives
* The Bureau of Railroad Economics
* The Railway Accounting Officers Association
* The Railway Treasury Officers Association

William George Besler was its first President.

==Facilities and subsidiaries==
The AAR is headquartered in Washington, D.C., not far from the Capitol. Its information technology subsidiary, Railinc, is based in Cary, North Carolina. Railinc IT systems and information services, including the Umler system, the Interline Settlement System and Embargoes system are an integral part of the North American rail infrastructure. Railinc delivers approximately nine million messages each day over its EDI network, including transportation waybills, advance train consists, blocking requests and responses and trip plans. Its applications support railroads, equipment owners and rail industry suppliers along every link of the supply chain. The company maintains the only industry-accepted version of the North American railroad industry&#x27;s official code tables. Beginning as an information technology department within the Association of American Railroads (AAR), the company was established as a wholly owned, for-profit subsidiary of the AAR in 1999.

Another subsidiary, the Transportation Technology Center, Inc. (TTCI), operates and maintains the Transportation Technology Center, a facility northeast of Pueblo, Colorado, owned by the United States Department of Transportation. The facility is under a care, custody and control contract with the Federal Railroad Administration. TTCI has an array of specialized testing facilities and tracks. The site enables testing of freight and passenger rolling stock, vehicle and track components, and safety devices.

==Functions==
Where appropriate, the AAR represents its members&#x27; interests to the public at large and to Congress and government regulators in particular. The AAR works to improve the efficiency, safety and service of the railroad industry, such as through its responsibility for the industry&#x27;s interchange rules and equipment specifications, e.g. for locomotive multiple unit control.

One of the AAR&#x27;s duties is to oversee the assignment of reporting marks – two to four letter codes that uniquely identify the owner of any piece of railroad rolling stock or intermodal freight transport equipment (trailers, semi-trailers, containers, etc.) that can be carried on a railroad.

== Reports ==
In November 2013 the AAR urged the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) to press for improved tank car safety by requiring all tank cars used to transport flammable liquids to be retrofitted or phased out, and new cars be built to more stringent standards.&quot;

<doc id="501204" wikidata="Q903644" url="?curid=501204" title="Microtubule organizing center">
<text>The microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) is a structure found in eukaryotic cells from which microtubules emerge. MTOCs have two main functions: the organization of eukaryotic flagella and cilia and the organization of the mitotic and meiotic spindle apparatus, which separate the chromosomes during cell division. The MTOC is a major site of microtubule nucleation and can be visualized in cells by immunohistochemical detection of γ-tubulin. The morphological characteristics of MTOCs vary between the different phyla and kingdoms. In animals, the two most important types of MTOCs are 1) the basal bodies associated with cilia and flagella and 2) the centrosome associated with spindle formation.

==Organization==

Microtubule-organizing centers function as the site where microtubule formation begins, as well as a location where free-ends of microtubules attract to. Within the cells, microtubule-organizing centers can take on many different forms. An array of microtubules can arrange themselves in a pinwheel structure to form the basal bodies, which can lead to the formation of microtubule arrays in the cytoplasm or the 9+2 axoneme. Other arrangements range from fungi spindle pole bodies to the eukaryotic chromosomal kinetochores (flat, laminated plaques). MTOCs can be freely dispersed throughout the cytoplasm or centrally localized as foci. The most notable MTOCs are the centrosome at interphase and the mitotic spindle poles.

Centrioles can act as markers for MTOCs in the cell. If they are freely distributed in the cytoplasm, centrioles can gather during differentiation to become MTOCs. They can also be focused around a centrosome as a single MTOC, though centrosomes can work as an MTOC absent of centrioles.

==In interphase==
Most animal cells have one MTOC during interphase, usually located near the nucleus, and generally associated closely with the Golgi apparatus. The MTOC is made up of a pair of centrioles at its center, and is surrounded by pericentriolar material (PCM) that is important for microtubule nucleation. Microtubules are anchored at the MTOC by their minus ends, while their plus ends continue to grow into the cell periphery. The polarity of the microtubules is important for cellular transport, as the motor proteins kinesin and dynein typically move preferentially in the &quot;plus&quot; and &quot;minus&quot; directions respectively, along a microtubule, allowing vesicles to be directed to or from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Particularly for the Golgi apparatus, structures associated with the apparatus travel towards the minus end of a microtubule and aid in the overall structure and site of the Golgi in the cell.

==Centrosomes==

Movements of the microtubules are based on the actions of the centrosome. Each daughter cell after the cessation of mitosis contains one primary MTOC. Before cell division begins, the interphase MTOC replicates to form two distinct MTOCs (now typically referred to as centrosomes). During cell division, these centrosomes move to opposite ends of the cell and nucleate microtubules to help form the mitotic/meiotic spindle. If the MTOC does not replicate, the spindle cannot form, and mitosis ceases prematurely.

γ-tubulin is a protein located at the centrosome that nucleates the microtubules by interacting with the tubulin monomer subunit in the microtubule at the minus end. Organization of the microtubules at the MTOC, or centrosome in this case, is determined by the polarity of the microtubules defined by y-tubulin.

==Basal body==

In epithelial cells, MTOCs also anchor and organize the microtubules that make up cilia. As with the centrosome, these MTOCs stabilize and give direction to the microtubules, in this case to allow unidirectional movement of the cilium itself, rather than vesicles moving along it.

==Spindle pole body==

In yeasts and some algae, the MTOC is embedded into the nuclear envelope as a spindle pole body. Centrioles do not exist in the MTOCs of yeast and fungi. In these organisms, the nuclear envelope does not break down during mitosis and the spindle pole body serves to connect cytoplasmic with nuclear microtubules. The disc-shaped spindle pole body is organized into three layers: the central plaque, inner plaque, and outer plaque. The central plaque is embedded in the membrane, while the inner plaque is an amorphous intranuclear layer, and the outer plaque is the layer located in the cytoplasm.

==In plants==
Plant cells lack centrioles or spindle pole bodies except in their flagellate male gametes, and they are entirely absent in the conifers and flowering plants. Instead, the nuclear envelope itself appears to function as the main MTOC for microtubule nucleation and spindle organization during plant cell mitosis.

==Signal transduction==
The MTOC reorients itself during signal transduction, primarily during wound repair or immune responses. The MTOC is relocalized to a position between the edge of the cell and the nucleus in cells like macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Organelles like the Golgi apparatus aid in the reorientation of the MTOC which can occur rapidly. Transduction signals cause microtubules to grow or contract, as well as cause the centrosome to become motile. The MTOC is located in a perinuclear position and contains the negative ends of microtubules while the positive ends grow rapidly towards the edge of the cell. The Golgi apparatus reorients along with the MTOC, and together cause the cell to seemingly send a polarized signal.

In immune responses, upon interaction with a target cell in response to antigen-specific loaded antigen-presenting cells, immune cells, such as the T cells, natural killer cells, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, localize their MTOCs near the contact zone between the immune cell and the target cell. For T cells, the T cell receptor signaling response causes the reorientation of the MTOC by microtubules shortening to bring the MTOC to the site of interaction of the T cell receptor.

<text>Nocodazole is an antineoplastic agent which exerts its effect in cells by interfering with the polymerization of microtubules. Microtubules are one type of fibre which constitutes the cytoskeleton, and the dynamic microtubule network has several important roles in the cell, including vesicular transport, forming the mitotic spindle and in cytokinesis. Several drugs including vincristine and colcemid are similar to nocodazole in that they interfere with microtubule polymerization.

Nocodazole has been shown to decrease the oncogenic potential of cancer cells via another microtubules-independent mechanisms. Nocodazole stimulates the expression of LATS2 which potently inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway by abrogating the interaction between the Wnt-dependent transcriptional co-factors beta-catenin and BCL9.

It is related to mebendazole by replacement of the left most benzene ring by thiophene.

==Use in cell biology research==
As nocodazole affects the cytoskeleton, it is often used in cell biology experiments as a control: for example, some dominant negative Rho small GTPases cause a similar effect as nocodazole, and constitutively activated mutants often reverse or negate the effect.

Nocodazole is frequently used in cell biology laboratories to synchronize the cell division cycle. Cells treated with nocodazole arrest with a G2- or M-phase DNA content when analyzed by flow cytometry. Microscopy of nocodazole-treated cells shows that they do enter mitosis but cannot form metaphase spindles because microtubules (of which the spindles are made) cannot polymerise. The absence of microtubule attachment to kinetochores activates the spindle assembly checkpoint, causing the cell to arrest in prometaphase. For cell synchronization experiments, nocodazole is usually used at a concentration of 40–100 ng/mL of culture medium for a duration of 12–18 hours. Prolonged arrest of cells in mitosis due to nocodazole treatment typically results in cell death by apoptosis.

Another standard cell biological application of nocodazole is to induce the formation of Golgi ministacks in eukaryotic cells. The perinuclear structural organization of the Golgi apparatus in eukaryotes is dependent on microtubule trafficking, but disrupting the trafficking of Golgi elements from the endoplasmic reticulum treatment with nocodazole (33 &quot;μ&quot;M for 3 hours) induces numerous Golgi elements to form adjacent to ER exit sites. These functional Golgi ministacks remain distributed about the cell, unable to track forward to form a perinuclear Golgi since nocodazole has depolymerized the microtubules.

Also used with Mad2p protein as an anti-microtubule drug.
