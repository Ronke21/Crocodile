<text>Canada did not officially participate in the Vietnam War. However, it contributed to peacekeeping forces in 1973 to help enforce the Paris Peace Accords.

Privately, some Canadians contributed to the war effort. Canadian corporations sold materiel to the U.S. government. In addition, at least 30,000 Canadians volunteered to serve in the U.S. armed forces during the war. At least 134 Canadians died or were reported missing in Vietnam.

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of U.S. Vietnam War resisters immigrated to Canada to avoid the draft. Largely middle class and educated, they had a significant impact on Canadian life. After the war, tens of thousands of Vietnamese boat people were also admitted and became a unique part of Canadian life.

== Beginnings ==

During the First Indochina War between France and the Indo-Chinese nationalist and communist parties, Canada remained militarily neutral but provided modest diplomatic and economic support to the French. Canada was, however, part of the International Control Commission (along with Poland and India) that oversaw the 1954 Geneva Agreements that divided Vietnam, provided for French withdrawal, and would have instituted elections for reunification by 1956. Behind the scenes, Canadian diplomats tried to discourage both France and the United States from escalating the conflict in a part of the world Canada had decided was not strategically vital.

Canada laid out six prerequisites to joining a war effort or Asian alliance like SEATO:
# It had to involve cultural and trade connections in addition to a military alliance.
# It had to demonstrably meet the will of the people in the countries involved.
# Other free Asian states had to support it directly or in principle.
# France had to refer the conflict to the United Nations organization.
# Any multilateral action must conform to the UN charter.
# Any action had to be divorced from all elements of colonialism.

These criteria effectively guaranteed Canada would not participate in the Vietnam War.

== Canadian involvement in the war ==

At the start of the Vietnam War, Canada was a member of the International Control Commission (ICC) overseeing the implementation of the Geneva Agreements, and thus attempted to maintain an air of neutrality. However, the Canadian negotiators were strongly on the side of the U.S. One representative (J. Blair Seaborn, younger brother of Robert Seaborn) was even involved in secretly exchanging messages between the U.S. and North Vietnam on behalf of the U.S., with the approval of the Canadian government. Canada also sent foreign aid to South Vietnam, which, while humanitarian, was directed by the U.S.
Canada tried to mediate between the warring countries, aiming for a conclusion that could allow the U.S. to leave the conflict honourably. It has also been commonly believed, as reported at the time, that the Canadian government of Prime Minister Lester Pearson publicly criticized U.S. war methods. Yet, the text of a speech which Pearson delivered at Temple University in Philadelphia on April 2, 1965 has debunked this widespread rumor, with Pearson even stating &quot;The government and great majority of people of my country have supported wholeheartedly the US peacekeeping and peacemaking policies in Vietnam.&quot;

Meanwhile, Canadian industry exported military supplies and raw materials useful in their manufacture, including ammunition, napalm and Agent Orange, to the United States, as trade between the two countries continued without interruption or hindrance. In total, Canadians firms sold over $12.5 billion of war materials to the US during the war, including machinery, munitions, clothing, food, and raw materials. Testing of Agent Orange also took place in Canada.

&quot;500 firms sold $2.5 billion of war materials (ammunition, napalm, aircraft engines and explosives) to the Pentagon. Another $10 billion in food, beverages, berets and boots for the troops was exported to the U.S., as well as nickel, copper, lead, oil, brass for shell casings, wiring, plate armour and military transport. In Canada unemployment fell to record low levels of 3.9%&quot;.

Although these exports were sales by Canadian firms, not gifts from the Canadian government, they nonetheless benefited the U.S. war effort. The first official statement about the Canadian economic support given to the United States armed forces was by Lester Pearson on March 10, 1967, when he stated that the export of goods to Canada&#x27;s southern ally was &quot;necessary and logical&quot; due to the extreme integration of both economies, and that an embargo would be a notice of withdrawal from North American defense arrangements. 

As the war escalated, however, relations between Canada and the United States gradually deteriorated. In his Temple University speech, while stating firm support for U.S. policy, Pearson also called for a pause in the bombing of North Vietnam. In a perhaps apocryphal story, when a furious President Lyndon B. Johnson met with Pearson the next day, he grabbed the much smaller Canadian by his lapels and talked angrily with him for an hour. After this incident, the two men somehow found ways to resolve their differences over the war and had further contacts, including later twice meeting in Canada. With the federal elections of 1968, which brought Pierre Trudeau to the prime ministry, Canadian policy changed radically to one of unrelenting criticism of U.S. policy in Vietnam. Trudeau called for immediate negotiations between the U.S. and North Vietnam and offered on at least one occasion to serve as mediator in the negotiations, annoying President Richard Nixon, who succeeded Lyndon Johnson after his own election to the U.S. presidency in 1968.

== Assistance to the U.S. war effort ==
Canada&#x27;s official diplomatic position in relation to the Vietnam War was that of a non-belligerent, which imposed a ban on the export of war-related items to the combat areas. Nonetheless, Canadian industry was also a major supplier of equipment and supplies to the U.S. forces, not sending these directly to South Vietnam but to the United States. The goods included relatively benign items like boots, but also aircraft, munitions, napalm, and commercial defoliants, the use of which was fiercely opposed by anti-war protesters at the time. 
In accordance with the 1956 Defence Production Sharing Agreement, Canadian industry sold $2.47 billion in materiel to the United States between 1965 and 1973. Many of the companies were owned by US parent firms, but all export sales over $100,000 US (and thus, the majority of contracts) were arranged through the Canadian Commercial Corporation, a crown corporation which functioned as an intermediary between the United States Department of Defense and Canadian industry. In some cases Canadian defence contractors were even sent to the theatre of war to undertake company work, such as when de Havilland Canada sent mobile repair teams from the Downsview, Toronto plant to complete depot-level repair of battle-damaged de Havilland Caribou aircraft that were owned and operated by the U.S. Army. Furthermore, the Canadian and the American Defence departments worked together to test chemical defoliants for use in Vietnam, a collaboration only revealed to the public in 1981. Canada also allowed their NATO ally to use Canadian facilities and bases for training exercises and weapons testing as per existing treaties.

Canadian diplomats covertly supported US counterinsurgency and espionage efforts in Vietnam, justifying these actions as a counterbalance to similar activities conducted by its Eastern bloc peers on the International Control Commission and the International Commission of Control and Supervision. 

Between January 28, 1973, and July 31, 1973, Canada provided 240 peacekeeping troops to &quot;Operation Gallant&quot;, the peacekeeping operation associated with the International Commission of Control and Supervision (ICCS) Vietnam, along with Hungary, Indonesia, and Poland. Their role was to monitor the cease-fire in South Vietnam per the Paris Peace Accords. After Canada&#x27;s departure from the Commission, it was replaced by Iran.

== Canadians in the U.S. armed forces ==

In a counter-current to the movement of U.S. draft evaders and deserters to Canada, about 30,000 Canadians volunteered to fight for the U.S. in Southeast Asia. Among the volunteers were 50 Mohawks from the Kahnawake reserve near Montreal. U.S. Army Sergeant Peter C. Lemon, an immigrant from Canada, was awarded the U.S. Medal of Honor for his valour in the conflict. This cross-border enlistment was not unprecedented: Both the First and the Second World War saw thousands of Americans join the Canadian military before the U.S officially declared war on Germany.

In 2015, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) produced a story remembering the Canadians who fought and died in the war. According to that story, a Canadian veterans association estimates that 20,000 Canadians enlisted in the U.S. armed forces to fight alongside the Americans, while some historians put the number as high as 40,000. Of these, an estimated 12,000 saw combat in Vietnam, and at least 134 were killed or declared missing in action.

The 2015 CBC story paid special attention to Rob McSorley, a teen-age Army Ranger from Vancouver who was shot dead by North Vietnamese soldiers. Other Canadians who gave their lives and were recognized in the story include:
* Thomas Edwin Fraser of the Six Nations Reserve in Ohsweken, Ontario
* Randolph Hatton from Toronto
* Robert Wilson Holditch from Port Robinson, Ontario
* Bruce Thomas Kennedy from Espanola, Ontario
* Jonathan Peter Kmetyk from St. Catharines, Ontario
* John J. Roden from Halifax, Nova Scotia
* Larry Semeniuk from Windsor, Ontario
* Murray Dean Vidler from Kerrobert, Saskatchewan.

In Windsor, Ontario, there is a privately funded monument to the Canadians killed in the Vietnam War. In Melocheville, Quebec, there is a monument dating from October 1989 funded by the Association Québécoise des Vétérans du Vietnam.

==U.S. war resisters in Canada==

U.S. draft evaders (often referred to by the disparaging term &quot;draft dodgers&quot;) and military deserters who sought refuge in Canada during the Vietnam War would ignite controversy among those seeking to immigrate to Canada, some of it provoked by the Canadian government&#x27;s initial refusal to admit those who could not prove they had been discharged from U.S. military service. This changed in 1968 with the installment of Pierre Trudeau as prime minister. On May 22, 1969, Ottawa announced that Canadian immigration officials could not ask about immigration applicants&#x27; military status if they appeared at the border seeking permanent residence in Canada. According to Valerie Knowles, draft evaders were usually college-educated sons of the middle class who could no longer defer induction into the Selective Service System. Deserters, on the other hand, were predominantly sons of the lower-middle and working classes who had been inducted into the armed services directly from high school or who had volunteered, hoping to obtain a skill and broaden their opportunities.

Starting in 1965, Canada became a choice haven for U.S. draft evaders and deserters. Because they were not formally classified as refugees but admitted as immigrants, there is no official estimate of how many draft evaders and deserters entered Canada during the Vietnam War. One informed estimate puts their number between 30,000 and 40,000. Whether or not this estimate is accurate, the fact remains that emigration from the United States was high as long as the U.S. was participating in the war militarily and maintained compulsory military service. In 1971-72, Canada received more immigrants from the United States than from any other country. 

=== Draft evaders ===
Estimates vary greatly as to how many males from the U.S. settled in Canada for the specific reason of dodging the draft or &quot;evading conscription,&quot; as opposed to desertion, or other reasons. Canadian immigration statistics show that 20,000 to 30,000 draft-eligible males from the U.S. came to Canada as immigrants during the Vietnam era. The BBC has reported that &quot;as many as 60,000 young American men dodged the draft.&quot; Estimates of the total number of U.S. citizens who moved to Canada due to their opposition to the war range from 50,000 to 125,000 This exodus was &quot;the largest politically motivated migration from the United States since the United Empire Loyalists moved north to oppose the American Revolution.&quot; Major communities of war resisters formed in Montreal, the Slocan Valley, British Columbia, and on Baldwin Street in Toronto, Ontario.

They were at first assisted by the Student Union for Peace Action, a campus-based Canadian anti-war organization with connections to Students for a Democratic Society in the U.S. Canadian immigration policy at the time made it easy for immigrants from all countries to obtain legal status in Canada. By late 1967, draft evaders were being assisted primarily by several locally based anti-draft organizations (over twenty of them), such as the Vancouver Committee to Aid American War Objectors and the Toronto Anti-Draft Programme. As a counselor for the Programme, Mark Satin wrote the &quot;Manual for Draft-Age Immigrants to Canada&quot; in 1968. It sold nearly 100,000 copies overall. In 1970, Canadian singer Gordon Lightfoot recorded his song &quot;Sit Down Young Stranger&quot; to express his views on Canada&#x27;s acceptance of American draft evaders.

The influx of these young men, who, as mentioned earlier, were often well educated and politically leftist, affected Canada&#x27;s academic and cultural institutions, and Canadian society at large. These new arrivals tended to balance the &quot;brain drain&quot; that Canada had experienced. While some draft evaders returned to the United States after a pardon was declared in 1977 during the presidential administration of Jimmy Carter, roughly half of them stayed in Canada.

Prominent draft evaders who stayed in Canada permanently, or for a significant amount of time, have included:
* Mike Fisher – founding member of Heart, notable rock/pop band
* William Gibson – science fiction writer, winner of a Nebula Award
* Jim Green – Vancouver city councillor and mayoral candidate
* Michael Hendricks – gay rights advocate
* Jeffry House – lawyer, clients include many activists
* Bill King – musician and organizer of Toronto&#x27;s Beaches Jazz Festival
* Michael Klein – activist physician, spouse of Bonnie Sherr Klein, father of Naomi Klein
* Keith Maillard – professor of creative writing, University of British Columbia
* Eric Nagler – children&#x27;s entertainer on The Elephant Show
* Wayne Robinson – father of Svend Robinson, former Member of Parliament
* Jay Scott – film critic, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;
* Jesse Winchester – singer-songwriter
* Michael Wolfson – assistant chief statistician at Statistics Canada
* Harry Yates – human resources manager at the Ministry of the Attorney General of British Columbia

=== Deserters ===
Distinct from draft resisters, there were also deserters from the U.S. armed forces who also made their way to Canada. There was pressure from both the United States and Canada for the deserters to be arrested, or at least stopped at the border.

The deserters have not been pardoned and may still face &quot;pro forma&quot; arrest, as the case of Allen Abney demonstrated in March 2006. Another similar case was that of Richard Allen Shields: He had deserted the U.S. Army in Alaska in 1972 after serving a year in Vietnam. Twenty-eight years later, on March 22, 2000, while he attempted to drive a lumber truck across the US-Canada border (in Metaline Falls, Washington) he was arrested by U.S. Customs agents and jailed at Fort Sill.
He was discharged from the Army with an Other Than Honorable discharge in April 2000.
Other noteworthy deserters from that era include the following:
* Andy Barrie- former host of Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Radio&#x27;s &quot;Metro Morning&quot; in Toronto (He later received a General discharge from the United States Army, became a Canadian citizen, and is free to travel to the U.S.)
* Dick Cotterill
* Michael Shaffer: &quot;After six months in the Army, my application for CO status was denied and I was told that I would be going to Vietnam. I refused to draw my weapon and was ordered court-martialed. On Labour Day 1970 I was able to escape and cross into Canada ... During President Ford&#x27;s Clemency Program in 1975, I went to Fort Dix seeking the &quot;Undesirable Discharge&quot; offered to deserters who turned themselves in. The Army decided that I wasn&#x27;t eligible and court-martial proceedings were resumed. With help from the ACLU, I was released and two years later a Federal Court ordered the Army to discharge me Honourably as a Conscientious Objector ... I remained in Vancouver&quot;
* Jack Todd – award-winning sports columnist for the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;
* Mike Tulley - Edmonton, Alberta area sound engineer and social activist

===Missing-text controversy===

In February 2009, text on how both draft evaders and resisters of the Vietnam War were ultimately allowed to stay in Canada suddenly vanished from the website of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada.&quot;

Originally, the Government of Canada website had contained the following statements:

... Starting in 1965, Canada became a choice haven for American draft resisters and deserters, ... Although some of these transplanted Americans returned home after the Vietnam War, most of them put down roots in Canada, making up the largest, best-educated group this country had ever received.

The above statement (now gone from the website) was part of an extensive online chapter on draft resisters and deserters from the Vietnam war, which was found in the larger online document,&quot;Forging Our Legacy: Canadian Citizenship and Immigration, 1900–1977&quot; It was originally posted on the Government of Canada website in the year 2000, when the Liberal Party of Canada, led by Jean Chrétien, was in power and responsible for the content of that website but in 2009, the Ministry of Stephen Harper [took] &quot;a much dimmer view of dozens of U.S. soldiers who&#x27;ve come north after refusing to serve in the invasion of Iraq. Some had already been deported to face military jail terms ranging from about six to 15 months.&quot;

The removal from the Citizenship and Immigration website occurred in the same month that its multi-party counterpart, the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration was debating that issue: On February 12, 2009, that multi-party committee passed, for the second time, a non-binding motion reaffirming Parliament&#x27;s earlier (June 2008) vote which recommended that the government let Iraq War resisters stay in Canada. A month and a half later, on March 30, 2009, the House of Commons of Canada again voted in a non-binding motion 129 to 125 in favour of the committee&#x27;s recommendation.

== After the war ==

The Vietnam War continued to resonate in Canada long after the war was over.

=== Vietnamese boat people ===
After the fall of South Vietnam in April 1975, hundreds of thousands of refugees, called boat people, fled Vietnam and adjacent nations. According to Canadian immigration historian Valerie Knowles, from 1979 to 1980 Canada admitted an estimated 60,000 of these refugees, &quot;most of whom had endured several days in small, leaky boats, prey to vicious pirate attacks, before ending up in squalid camps&quot;. Knowles says it was the highest number of boat people accepted by any nation, including the United States, during that period. The boat people constituted 25% of all newcomers admitted to Canada from 1978 to 1981. This created a substantial Vietnamese community in Canada, concentrated especially in Montreal, Vancouver, and Toronto.

=== Cultural and political shifts ===

The Vietnam War was an important cultural turning point in Canada. Coupled with Canada&#x27;s centenary in 1967 and the success of Expo 67, Canada became far more independent and nationalistic. The public, if not their representatives in parliament, became more willing to oppose the United States and to move in a different direction socially and politically.

=== Agent Orange in New Brunswick ===

In 1981, a government report revealed that Agent Orange, the controversial defoliant, had been tested at CFB Gagetown, New Brunswick. In June 1966, the chemical was sprayed over nearly 600 acres (2.4 km2) of forest inside the base. There are differing opinions about the level of toxicity of the site; but, in 2006, the Canadian government said it planned to compensate some of those who were exposed. As of 2011, some claims have been paid but the administration of the compensation program has been criticized.

<doc id="490201" wikidata="Q334911" url="?curid=490201" title="Health insurance">
<text>Health insurance or medical insurance (also known as medical aid in South Africa) is a type of insurance that covers the whole or a part of the risk of a person incurring medical expenses. As with other types of insurance, risk is shared among many individuals. By estimating the overall risk of health risk and health system expenses over the risk pool, an insurer can develop a routine finance structure, such as a monthly premium or payroll tax, to provide the money to pay for the health care benefits specified in the insurance agreement. The benefit is administered by a central organization, such as a government agency, private business, or not-for-profit entity.

According to the Health Insurance Association of America, health insurance is defined as &quot;coverage that provides for the payments of benefits as a result of sickness or injury. It includes insurance for losses from accident, medical expense, disability, or accidental death and dismemberment&quot;.
A health insurance policy is a insurance contract between an insurance provider (e.g. an insurance company or a government) and an individual or his/her sponsor (that is an employer or a community organization). The contract can be renewable (annually, monthly) or lifelong in the case of private insurance. It can also be mandatory for all citizens in the case of national plans. The type and amount of health care costs that will be covered by the health insurance provider are specified in writing, in a member contract or &quot;Evidence of Coverage&quot; booklet for private insurance, or in a national health policy for public insurance.

==Funding and obligations==

There are two types of health insurance – tax payer-funded and private-funded. A private-funded insurance plan example includes an employer-sponsored self-funded ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) plan. Typically, these companies promote themselves as having ties to major insurance providers. However, in the context of an ERISA plan, these insurance companies do not actively participate in insurance practices; instead, they handle administrative tasks. Consequently, ERISA plans are exempt from state regulations and fall under federal jurisdiction, overseen by the US Department of Labor (USDOL). Specific details about benefits or coverage can be found in the Summary Plan Description (SPD). Should there be a need for an appeal, the process typically involves initiating it through the insurance company and then reaching out to the Employer&#x27;s Plan Fiduciary. If a resolution is still not achieved, the decision can be escalated to the USDOL for review to ensure compliance with ERISA regulations, and, if necessary, legal action can be taken by filing a lawsuit in federal court. Health insurance can be combined with publicly funded health care and medical savings accounts.

The individual insured person&#x27;s obligations may take several forms:

* Premium: The amount the policy-holder or their sponsor (e.g. an employer) pays to the health plan to purchase health coverage. (US specific) According to the healthcare law, a premium is calculated using 5 specific factors regarding the insured person. These factors are age, location, tobacco use, individual vs. family enrollment, and which plan category the insured chooses. Under the Affordable Care Act, the government pays a tax credit to cover part of the premium for persons who purchase private insurance through the Insurance Marketplace.
* Deductible: The amount that the insured must pay out-of-pocket before the health insurer pays its share. For example, policy-holders might have to pay a $7500 deductible per year, before any of their health care is covered by the health insurer. It may take several doctor&#x27;s visits or prescription refills before the insured person reaches the deductible and the insurance company starts to pay for care. Furthermore, most policies do not apply co-pays for doctor&#x27;s visits or prescriptions against your deductible.
* Co-payment: The amount that the insured person must pay out of pocket before the health insurer pays for a particular visit or service. For example, an insured person might pay a $45 co-payment for a doctor&#x27;s visit, or to obtain a prescription. A co-payment must be paid each time a particular service is obtained.
* Coinsurance: Instead of, or in addition to, paying a fixed amount up front (a co-payment), the co-insurance is a percentage of the total cost that an insured person may also pay. For example, the member might have to pay 20% of the cost of a surgery over and above a co-payment, while the insurance company pays the other 80%. If there is an upper limit on coinsurance, the policy-holder could end up owing very little, or a great deal, depending on the actual costs of the services they obtain.
* Exclusions: Not all services are covered. Billed items like use-and-throw, taxes, etc. are excluded from admissible claim. The insured are generally expected to pay the full cost of non-covered services out of their own pockets.
* Coverage limits: Some health insurance policies only pay for health care up to a certain dollar amount. The insured person may be expected to pay any charges in excess of the health plan&#x27;s maximum payment for a specific service. In addition, some insurance company schemes have annual or lifetime coverage maxima. In these cases, the health plan will stop payment when they reach the benefit maximum, and the policy-holder must pay all remaining costs.
* Out-of-pocket maximum: Similar to coverage limits, except that in this case, the insured person&#x27;s payment obligation ends when they reach the out-of-pocket maximum, and health insurance pays all further covered costs. Out-of-pocket maximum can be limited to a specific benefit category (such as prescription drugs) or can apply to all coverage provided during a specific benefit year.
* Capitation: An amount paid by an insurer to a health care provider, for which the provider agrees to treat all members of the insurer.
* In-Network Provider: (U.S. term) A health care provider on a list of providers preselected by the insurer. The insurer will offer discounted coinsurance or co-payments, or additional benefits, to a plan member to see an in-network provider. Generally, providers in network are providers who have a contract with the insurer to accept rates further discounted from the &quot;usual and customary&quot; charges the insurer pays to out-of-network providers.
* Out-of-Network Provider: A health care provider that has not contracted with the plan. If using an out-of-network provider, the patient may have to pay full cost of the benefits and services received from that provider. Even for emergency services, out-of-network providers may bill patients for some additional costs associated.
* Prior Authorization: A certification or authorization that an insurer provides prior to medical service occurring. Obtaining an authorization means that the insurer is obligated to pay for the service, assuming it matches what was authorized. Many smaller, routine services do not require authorization.
* Formulary: the list of drugs that an insurance plan agrees to cover.
* Explanation of benefits: A document that may be sent by an insurer to a patient explaining what was covered for a medical service, and how payment amount and patient responsibility amount were determined. In the case of emergency room billing, patients are notified within 30 days post service. Patients are rarely notified of the cost of emergency room services in-person due to patient conditions and other logistics until receipt of this letter.

Prescription drug plans are a form of insurance offered through some health insurance plans. In the U.S., the patient usually pays a copayment and the prescription drug insurance part or all of the balance for drugs covered in the formulary of the plan. Such plans are routinely part of national health insurance programs. For example, in the province of Quebec, Canada, prescription drug insurance is universally required as part of the public health insurance plan, but may be purchased and administered either through private or group plans, or through the public plan.

Some, if not most, health care providers in the United States will agree to bill the insurance company if patients are willing to sign an agreement that they will be responsible for the amount that the insurance company does not pay. The insurance company pays out of network providers according to &quot;reasonable and customary&quot; charges, which may be less than the provider&#x27;s usual fee. The provider may also have a separate contract with the insurer to accept what amounts to a discounted rate or capitation to the provider&#x27;s standard charges. It generally costs the patient less to use an in-network provider.

== Comparisons ==


The Commonwealth Fund, in its annual survey, &quot;Mirror, Mirror on the Wall&quot;, compares the performance of the health care systems in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada and the U.S. Its 2007 study found that, although the U.S. system is the most expensive, it consistently under-performs compared to the other countries. One difference between the U.S. and the other countries in the study is that the U.S. is the only country without universal health insurance coverage.

The Commonwealth Fund completed its thirteenth annual health policy survey in 2010. A study of the survey &quot;found significant differences in access, cost burdens, and problems with health insurance that are associated with insurance design&quot;. Of the countries surveyed, the results indicated that people in the United States had more out-of-pocket expenses, more disputes with insurance companies than other countries, and more insurance payments denied; paperwork was also higher although Germany had similarly high levels of paperwork.

==By country==
=== Australia ===

The Australian public health system is called Medicare, which provides free universal access to hospital treatment and subsidised out-of-hospital medical treatment. It is funded by a 2% tax levy on all taxpayers, an extra 1% levy on high income earners, as well as general revenue.

The private health system is funded by a number of private health insurance organizations. The largest of these is Medibank Private Limited, which was, until 2014, a government-owned entity, when it was privatized and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.

Australian health funds can be either &#x27;for profit&#x27; including Bupa and nib; &#x27;mutual&#x27; including Australian Unity; or &#x27;non-profit&#x27; including GMHBA, HCF and the HBF Health Insurance. Some, such as Police Health, have membership restricted to particular groups, but the majority have open membership. Membership to most health funds is now also available through comparison websites. These comparison sites operate on a commission-basis by agreement with their participating health funds. The Private Health Insurance Ombudsman also operates a free website that allows consumers to search for and compare private health insurers&#x27; products, which includes information on price and level of cover.

Most aspects of private health insurance in Australia are regulated by the &quot;Private Health Insurance Act 2007&quot;. Complaints and reporting of the private health industry is carried out by an independent government agency, the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman. The ombudsman publishes an annual report that outlines the number and nature of complaints per health fund compared to their market share 

The private health system in Australia operates on a &quot;community rating&quot; basis, whereby premiums do not vary solely because of a person&#x27;s previous medical history, the current state of health, or (generally speaking) their age (but see Lifetime Health Cover below). Balancing this are waiting periods, in particular for pre-existing conditions (usually referred to within the industry as PEA, which stands for &quot;pre-existing ailment&quot;). Funds are entitled to impose a waiting period of up to 12 months on benefits for any medical condition the signs and symptoms of which existed during the six months ending on the day the person first took out insurance. They are also entitled to impose a 12-month waiting period for benefits for treatment relating to an obstetric condition, and a 2-month waiting period for all other benefits when a person first takes out private insurance. Funds have the discretion to reduce or remove such waiting periods in individual cases. They are also free not to impose them, to begin with, but this would place such a fund at risk of &quot;adverse selection&quot;, attracting a disproportionate number of members from other funds, or from the pool of intending members who might otherwise have joined other funds. It would also attract people with existing medical conditions, who might not otherwise have taken out insurance at all because of the denial of benefits for 12 months due to the PEA Rule. The benefits paid out for these conditions would create pressure on premiums for all the fund&#x27;s members, causing some to drop their membership, which would lead to further rises in premiums, and a vicious cycle of higher premiums-leaving members would ensue.

The Australian government has introduced a number of incentives to encourage adults to take out private hospital insurance. These include:
* Lifetime Health Cover: If a person has not taken out private hospital cover by 1 July after their 31st birthday, then when (and if) they do so after this time, their premiums must include a loading of 2% per annum for each year they were without hospital cover. Thus, a person taking out private cover for the first time at age 40 will pay a 20 percent loading. The loading is removed after 10 years of continuous hospital cover. The loading applies only to premiums for hospital cover, not to ancillary (extras) cover.
* Medicare Levy Surcharge: People whose taxable income is greater than a specified amount (in the 2011/12 financial year $80,000 for singles and $168,000 for couples) and who do not have an adequate level of private hospital cover must pay a 1% surcharge on top of the standard 1.5% Medicare Levy. The rationale is that if the people in this income group are forced to pay more money one way or another, most would choose to purchase hospital insurance with it, with the possibility of a benefit if they need private hospital treatment – rather than pay it in the form of extra tax as well as having to meet their own private hospital costs.
** The Australian government announced in May 2008 that it proposes to increase the thresholds, to $100,000 for singles and $150,000 for families. These changes require legislative approval. A bill to change the law has been introduced but was not passed by the Senate. An amended version was passed on 16 October 2008. There have been criticisms that the changes will cause many people to drop their private health insurance, causing a further burden on the public hospital system, and a rise in premiums for those who stay with the private system. Other commentators believe the effect will be minimal.
* Private Health Insurance Rebate: The government subsidises the premiums for all private health insurance cover, including hospital and ancillary (extras), by 10%, 20% or 30%, depending on age. The Rudd Government announced in May 2009 that as of July 2010, the Rebate would become means-tested, and offered on a sliding scale. While this move (which would have required legislation) was defeated in the Senate at the time, in early 2011 the Gillard Government announced plans to reintroduce the legislation after the Opposition loses the balance of power in the Senate. The ALP and Greens have long been against the rebate, referring to it as &quot;middle-class welfare&quot;.

=== Canada ===

As per the Constitution of Canada, health care is mainly a provincial government responsibility in Canada (the main exceptions being federal government responsibility for services provided to aboriginal peoples covered by treaties, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the armed forces, and Members of Parliament). Consequently, each province administers its own health insurance program. The federal government influences health insurance by virtue of its fiscal powers – it transfers cash and tax points to the provinces to help cover the costs of the universal health insurance programs. Under the Canada Health Act, the federal government mandates and enforces the requirement that all people have free access to what are termed &quot;medically necessary services,&quot; defined primarily as care delivered by physicians or in hospitals, and the nursing component of long-term residential care. If provinces allow doctors or institutions to charge patients for medically necessary services, the federal government reduces its payments to the provinces by the amount of the prohibited charges. Collectively, the public provincial health insurance systems in Canada are frequently referred to as Medicare. This public insurance is tax-funded out of general government revenues, although British Columbia and Ontario levy a mandatory premium with flat rates for individuals and families to generate additional revenues – in essence, a surtax. Private health insurance is allowed, but in six provincial governments only for services that the public health plans do not cover (for example, semi-private or private rooms in hospitals and prescription drug plans). Four provinces allow insurance for services also mandated by the Canada Health Act, but in practice, there is no market for it. All Canadians are free to use private insurance for elective medical services such as laser vision correction surgery, cosmetic surgery, and other non-basic medical procedures. Some 65% of Canadians have some form of supplementary private health insurance; many of them receive it through their employers. Private-sector services not paid for by the government account for nearly 30 percent of total health care spending.

In 2005, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled, in &quot;Chaoulli v. Quebec&quot;, that the province&#x27;s prohibition on private insurance for health care already insured by the provincial plan violated the Quebec Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and in particular, the sections dealing with the right to life and security, if there were unacceptably long wait times for treatment, as was alleged in this case. The ruling has not changed the overall pattern of health insurance across Canada, but has spurred on attempts to tackle the core issues of supply and demand and the impact of wait times. 

=== China ===
=== Cyprus ===
In 2020 in Cyprus introduced the General Healthcare System (GHS, also known as GESY) which is an independent insurance fund through which clinics, private doctors, pharmacists, laboratories, microbiological laboratories, and physiotherapists will be paid so that they can offer medical care to permanent residents of Cyprus who will be paying contributions to this fund.

In addition to GESY, more than 12 local and international insurance companies (e.g. Bupa, Aetna, Cigna, Metlife) provide individual and group medical insurance plans. The plans are divided into two main categories plans providing coverage from inpatient expenses (i.e. hospitalization, operations) and plans covering inpatient and outpatient expenses (such as doctor visits, medications, physio-therapies).

=== France ===

The national system of health insurance was instituted in 1945, just after the end of the Second World War. It was a compromise between Gaullist and Communist representatives in the French parliament. The Conservative Gaullists were opposed to a state-run healthcare system, while the Communists were supportive of a complete nationalisation of health care along a British Beveridge model.

The resulting programme is profession-based: all people working are required to pay a portion of their income to a not-for-profit health insurance fund, which mutualises the risk of illness, and which reimburses medical expenses at varying rates. Children and spouses of insured people are eligible for benefits, as well. Each fund is free to manage its own budget, and used to reimburse medical expenses at the rate it saw fit, however following a number of reforms in recent years, the majority of funds provide the same level of reimbursement and benefits.

The government has two responsibilities in this system.
* The first government responsibility is the fixing of the rate at which medical expenses should be negotiated, and it does so in two ways: The Ministry of Health directly negotiates prices of medicine with the manufacturers, based on the average price of sale observed in neighboring countries. A board of doctors and experts decides if the medicine provides a valuable enough medical benefit to be reimbursed (most medicine is reimbursed, including homeopathy). In parallel, the government fixes the reimbursement rate for medical services: this means that a doctor is free to charge the fee that he wishes for a consultation or an examination, but the social security system will only reimburse it at a pre-set rate. These tariffs are set annually through negotiation with doctors&#x27; representative organisations.
* The second government responsibility is oversight of the health-insurance funds, to ensure that they are correctly managing the sums they receive, and to ensure oversight of the public hospital network.

Today, this system is more or less intact. All citizens and legal foreign residents of France are covered by one of these mandatory programs, which continue to be funded by worker participation. However, since 1945, a number of major changes have been introduced. Firstly, the different health care funds (there are five: General, Independent, Agricultural, Student, Public Servants) now all reimburse at the same rate. Secondly, since 2000, the government now provides health care to those who are not covered by a mandatory regime (those who have never worked and who are not students, meaning the very rich or the very poor). This regime, unlike the worker-financed ones, is financed via general taxation and reimburses at a higher rate than the profession-based system for those who cannot afford to make up the difference. Finally, to counter the rise in health care costs, the government has installed two plans, (in 2004 and 2006), which require insured people to declare a referring doctor in order to be fully reimbursed for specialist visits, and which installed a mandatory co-pay of €1 for a doctor visit, €0.50 for each box of medicine prescribed, and a fee of €16–18 per day for hospital stays and for expensive procedures.

An important element of the French insurance system is solidarity: the more ill a person becomes, the less the person pays. This means that for people with serious or chronic illnesses, the insurance system reimburses them 100% of expenses, and waives their co-pay charges.

Finally, for fees that the mandatory system does not cover, there is a large range of private complementary insurance plans available. The market for these programs is very competitive, and often subsidised by the employer, which means that premiums are usually modest. 85% of French people benefit from complementary private health insurance.

=== Germany ===
Germany has the world&#x27;s oldest national social health insurance system, with origins dating back to Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s Sickness Insurance Law of 1883.

Beginning with 10% of blue-collar workers in 1885, mandatory insurance has expanded; in 2009, insurance was made mandatory on all citizens, with private health insurance for the self-employed or above an income threshold. As of 2016, 85% of the population is covered by the compulsory Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) (&quot;Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung&quot; or &quot;GKV&quot;), with the remainder covered by private insurance (&quot;Private Krankenversicherung&quot; or &quot;PKV&quot;). Germany&#x27;s health care system was 77% government-funded and 23% privately funded as of 2004. While public health insurance contributions are based on the individual&#x27;s income, private health insurance contributions are based on the individual&#x27;s age and health condition.

Reimbursement is on a fee-for-service basis, but the number of physicians allowed to accept Statutory Health Insurance in a given locale is regulated by the government and professional societies.

Co-payments were introduced in the 1980s in an attempt to prevent over utilization. The average length of hospital stay in Germany has decreased in recent years from 14 days to 9 days, still considerably longer than average stays in the United States (5 to 6 days). Part of the difference is that the chief consideration for hospital reimbursement is the number of hospital days as opposed to procedures or diagnosis. Drug costs have increased substantially, rising nearly 60% from 1991 through 2005. Despite attempts to contain costs, overall health care expenditures rose to 10.7% of GDP in 2005, comparable to other western European nations, but substantially less than that spent in the U.S. (nearly 16% of GDP).

Germans are offered three kinds of social security insurance dealing with the physical status of a person and which are co-financed by employer and employee: health insurance, accident insurance, and long-term care insurance. Long-term care insurance (&quot;Gesetzliche Pflegeversicherung&quot;) emerged in 1994 and is mandatory. Accident insurance (gesetzliche Unfallversicherung) is covered by the employer and basically covers all risks for commuting to work and at the workplace.

=== Greece ===
The National Health System in Greece covers both out and in-patient treatment.
The out-patient treatment is carried out by social administrative structures as following:
* EOPPY (National Organization for the Provision of Health Services): contracted private healthcare providers
* PEDY (National Primary Healthcare Network) units: public healthcare
* State hospitals, rural and regional medical units, health centers of the ESY (National Health System)
* Private health professionals: Medical professionals and services not contracted with EOPYY.
The in-patient treatment is carried out by:
* State hospitals of the National Health System (ESY).
* Private Clinics contracted with the National Health Carrier (EOPYY)
* Private hospitals and clinics that are not contracted with the National Health Carrier.
In Greece anyone can cover the hospitalization expenses using a private insurance policy, that can be bought by any of the local or multinational insurance companies that operate in the region (e.g. Metlife, Interamerican, Aetna, IMG).

=== India ===

In India, provision of healthcare services and their efficiency varies state-wise. Public health services are prominent in most of the regions with the national government playing an important role in funding, framing and implementing policies and operating public health insurances.

The vast majority of Indians are covered by either a comprehensive public health insurance scheme run by the National Health Authority called the Ayushman Bharat Yojana or a private health insurance scheme providing comprehensive coverage and that is tightly regulated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India.

=== Japan ===

There are three major types of insurance programs available in Japan: Employee Health Insurance (健康保険 Kenkō-Hoken), National Health Insurance (国民健康保険 Kokumin-Kenkō-Hoken), and the Late-stage Elderly Medical System (後期高齢医療制度 Kouki-Kourei-Iryouseido). Although private health insurance is available, all Japanese citizens, permanent residents, and non-Japanese with a visa lasting one year or longer are required to be enrolled in either National Health Insurance or Employee Health Insurance. National Health Insurance is designed for those who are not eligible for any employment-based health insurance program. The Late-stage Elderly Medical System is designed for people who are age 75 and older.

National Health Insurance is organised on a household basis. Once a household has applied, the entire family is covered. Applicants receive a health insurance card, which must be used when receiving treatment at a hospital. There is a required monthly premium, but co-payments are standardized so payers are only expected to cover ten to thirty percent of the cost, depending on age. If out-of-pocket costs exceed pre-determined limits, payers may apply for a rebate from the National Health Insurance program.

Employee Health Insurance covers diseases, injuries, and death regardless of whether an incident occurred at a workplace. Employee Health Insurance covers a maximum of 180 days of medical care per year for work-related diseases or injuries and 180 days per year for other diseases or injuries. Employers and employees must contribute evenly to be covered by Employee Health Insurance.

The Late-stage Elderly Medical System began in 1983 following the Health Care for the Aged Law of 1982. It allowed many health insurance systems to offer financial assistance to elderly people. There is a medical coverage fee. To be eligible, those insured must be either: older than 70, or older than 65 with a recognized disability. The Late-stage Elderly Medical System includes preventive and standard medical care.
==== Issues of the healthcare system ====
Due to Japan&#x27;s aging population, the Late-stage Elderly Medical System represents one third of the country&#x27;s total healthcare cost. When retiring employees shift from Employee Health Insurance to the Late-stage Elderly Medical System, the national cost of health insurance is expected to increase since individual healthcare costs tend to increase with age.

=== Netherlands ===

In 2006, a new system of health insurance came into force in the Netherlands. This new system avoids the two pitfalls of adverse selection and moral hazard associated with traditional forms of health insurance by using a combination of regulation and insurance equalization pool. Moral hazard is avoided by mandating that insurance companies provide at least one policy that meets a government set minimum standard level of coverage, and all adult residents are obliged by law to purchase this coverage from an insurance company of their choice. All insurance companies receive funds from the equalization pool to help cover the cost of this government-mandated coverage. This pool is run by a regulator which collects salary-based contributions from employers, which make up about 50% of all health care funding, and funding from the government to cover people who cannot afford health care, which makes up an additional 5%.

The remaining 45% of health care funding comes from insurance premiums paid by the public, for which companies compete on price, though the variation between the various competing insurers is only about 5%. However, insurance companies are free to sell additional policies to provide coverage beyond the national minimum. These policies do not receive funding from the equalization pool but cover additional treatments, such as dental procedures and physiotherapy, which are not paid for by the mandatory policy.

Funding from the equalization pool is distributed to insurance companies for each person they insure under the required policy. However, high-risk individuals get more from the pool, and low-income persons and children under 18 have their insurance paid for entirely. Because of this, insurance companies no longer find insuring high-risk individuals an unappealing proposition, avoiding the potential problem of adverse selection.

Insurance companies are not allowed to have co-payments, caps, or deductibles, or deny coverage to any person applying for a policy, or charge anything other than their nationally set and published standard premiums. Therefore, every person buying insurance will pay the same price as everyone else buying the same policy, and every person will get at least the minimum level of coverage. This applies to all people permanently living and working in the Netherlands. International students that move to the Netherlands for study purposes have to take out compulsory Dutch health insurance if they also decide to work (zero-hour contracts included) or do a paid internship during their stay. In that case, they&#x27;ll need to take out the compulsory basic package of Dutch health insurance. Additional insurance is optional, depending on the student&#x27;s personal needs.

=== New Zealand ===

Since 1974, New Zealand has had a system of universal no-fault health insurance for personal injuries through the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). The ACC scheme covers most of the costs of related to treatment of injuries acquired in New Zealand (including overseas visitors) regardless of how the injury occurred, and also covers lost income (at 80 percent of the employee&#x27;s pre-injury income) and costs related to long-term rehabilitation, such as home and vehicle modifications for those seriously injured. Funding from the scheme comes from a combination of levies on employers&#x27; payroll (for work injuries), levies on an employee&#x27;s taxable income (for non-work injuries to salary earners), levies on vehicle licensing fees and petrol (for motor vehicle accidents), and funds from the general taxation pool (for non-work injuries to children, senior citizens, unemployed people, overseas visitors, etc.)

=== Rwanda ===

Rwanda is one of a handful of low income countries that has implemented community-based health insurance schemes in order to reduce the financial barriers that prevent poor people from seeking and receiving needed health services. This scheme has helped reach 90% of the country&#x27;s population with health care coverage.

=== Singapore ===

Singaporeans have one of the longest life expectancy at birth in the world. During this long life, encountering uncertain situations requiring hospitalization are inevitable. Health insurance or medical insurance cover high healthcare costs during hospitalization.

Health insurance for Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents

MediShield Life, is a universal health insurance covering all Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents. MediShield Life covers hospitalization costs for a stay in ward B2 or C in a Public hospital. For the hospitalization in a Private hospital, or in ward A or B1 in Public hospital, MediShield Life coverage is pegged to B2 or C ward prices and insured is required to pay the remaining bill amount. This remaining bill amount can be paid using MediSave but limits are applied on the MediSave usage. MediShield Life does not cover overseas medical expenses and the treatment of serious pre-existing illnesses for which one has been receiving treatment during the 12 months before the start of the MediShield Life coverage. MediShield Life also does not cover treatment of congenital anomalies (medical conditions that are present at birth), cosmetic surgery, pregnancy-related charges and mental illness.

As the MediShield Life benefits are capped for B2 or C ward hospitalization in public hospitals, Integrated Shield plans provide coverage for the hospitalization in private hospitals, or ward A or B1 in public hospitals. Integrated Shield insurance plans cover large hospitalization bills for Private hospitals or, ward A or B1. However, insured is still required to pay a portion of the bill amount. This is in accordance with Singapore&#x27;s healthcare philosophy which promotes personal responsibility with getting individuals to share the cost of healthcare. With this philosophy, deductible, co-insurance and peroration are applied on most of the Health Insurance plans in Singapore. Such health insurance plans provide an option to purchase a health insurance rider to cover these charges.

Health insurance for Foreigners in Singapore

Unlike Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, Foreigners are not automatically covered by the MediShield Life. Foreigners can purchase the health insurance plans from several life insurers in Singapore.

=== South Korea ===

South Korea&#x27;s life expectancy at birth was 82.7 years in 2017, higher than the OECD average of 80.8. Men&#x27;s life expectancy was 79.7 years, higher than the OECD average of 78.1 years, and women&#x27;s life expectancy was 85.7 years, higher than the average of 83.4 years.

Health care in South Korea is provided by the National Health Insurance (NHI), which is mandatory. Anyone residing in South Korea, regardless of nationality or occupation, can purchase this insurance.

=== Switzerland ===
Healthcare in Switzerland is universal and is regulated by the Swiss Federal Law on Health Insurance. Health insurance is compulsory for all persons residing in Switzerland (within three months of taking up residence or being born in the country). It is therefore the same throughout the country and avoids double standards in healthcare. Insurers are required to offer this basic insurance to everyone, regardless of age or medical condition. They are not allowed to make a profit off this basic insurance, but can on supplemental plans.

The universal compulsory coverage provides for treatment in case of illness or accident and pregnancy. Health insurance covers the costs of medical treatment, medication and hospitalization of the insured. However, the insured person pays part of the costs up to a maximum, which can vary based on the individually chosen plan, premiums are then adjusted accordingly. The whole healthcare system is geared towards to the general goals of enhancing general public health and reducing costs while encouraging individual responsibility.

The Swiss healthcare system is a combination of public, subsidized private and totally private systems. Insurance premiums vary from insurance company to company, the excess level individually chosen (&quot;franchise&quot;), the place of residence of the insured person and the degree of supplementary benefit coverage chosen (complementary medicine, routine dental care, semi-private or private ward hospitalization, etc.).

The insured person has full freedom of choice among the approximately 60 recognized healthcare providers competent to treat their condition (in their region) on the understanding that the costs are covered by the insurance up to the level of the official tariff. There is freedom of choice when selecting an insurance company to which one pays a premium, usually on a monthly basis. The insured person pays the insurance premium for the basic plan up to 8% of their personal income. If a premium is higher than this, the government gives the insured person a cash subsidy to pay for any additional premium.

The compulsory insurance can be supplemented by private &quot;complementary&quot; insurance policies that allow for coverage of some of the treatment categories not covered by the basic insurance or to improve the standard of room and service in case of hospitalization. This can include complementary medicine, routine dental treatment and private ward hospitalization, which are not covered by the compulsory insurance.

As far as the compulsory health insurance is concerned, the insurance companies cannot set any conditions relating to age, sex or state of health for coverage. Although the level of premium can vary from one company to another, they must be identical within the same company for all insured persons of the same age group and region, regardless of sex or state of health. This does not apply to complementary insurance, where premiums are risk-based.

Switzerland has an infant mortality rate of about 3.6 out of 1,000. The general life expectancy in 2012 was for men 80.5 years compared to 84.7 years for women. These are the world&#x27;s best figures.

=== United Kingdom ===

The UK&#x27;s National Health Service (NHS) is a publicly funded healthcare system that provides coverage to everyone normally resident in the UK. It is not strictly an insurance system because (a) there are no premiums collected, (b) costs are not charged at the patient level and (c) costs are not pre-paid from a pool. However, it does achieve the main aim of insurance which is to spread financial risk arising from ill-health. The costs of running the NHS (est. £104 billion in 2007–8) are met directly from general taxation. The NHS provides the majority of health care in the UK, including primary care, in-patient care, long-term health care, ophthalmology, and dentistry.

Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance, but it is used by less than 8% of the population, and generally as a top-up to NHS services.
There are many treatments that the private sector does not provide. For example, health insurance on pregnancy is generally not covered or covered with restricting clauses. Typical exclusions for Bupa schemes (and many other insurers) include:
aging, menopause and puberty; AIDS/HIV; allergies or allergic disorders; birth control, conception, sexual problems and sex changes; chronic conditions; complications from excluded or restricted conditions/ treatment; convalescence, rehabilitation and general nursing care ; cosmetic, reconstructive or weight loss treatment; deafness; dental/oral treatment (such as fillings, gum disease, jaw shrinkage, etc.); dialysis; drugs and dressings for out-patient or take-home use† ; experimental drugs and treatment; eyesight; HRT and bone densitometry; learning difficulties, behavioural and developmental problems; overseas treatment and repatriation; physical aids and devices; pre-existing or special conditions; pregnancy and childbirth; screening and preventive treatment; sleep problems and disorders; speech disorders; temporary relief of symptoms.
(† = except in exceptional circumstances)

There are a number of other companies in the United Kingdom which include, among others, Chubb Limited, AXA, Aviva, Bupa, Groupama Healthcare, WPA and VitalityHealth. Similar exclusions apply, depending on the policy which is purchased.

In 2009, the main representative body of British Medical physicians, the British Medical Association, adopted a policy statement expressing concerns about developments in the health insurance market in the UK. In its Annual Representative Meeting which had been agreed earlier by the Consultants Policy Group (i.e. Senior physicians)
stating that the BMA was &quot;extremely concerned that the policies of some private healthcare insurance companies are preventing or restricting patients exercising choice about (i) the consultants who treat them; (ii) the hospital at which they are treated; (iii) making top up payments to cover any gap between the funding provided by their insurance company and the cost of their chosen private treatment.&quot; It went in to &quot;call on the BMA to publicise these concerns so that patients are fully informed when making choices about private healthcare insurance.&quot; The practice of insurance companies deciding which consultant a patient may see as opposed to GPs or patients is referred to as Open Referral. The NHS offers patients a choice of hospitals and consultants and does not charge for its services.

The private sector has been used to increase NHS capacity despite a large proportion of the British public opposing such involvement. According to the World Health Organization, government funding covered 86% of overall health care expenditures in the UK as of 2004, with private expenditures covering the remaining 14%.

Nearly one in three patients receiving NHS hospital treatment is privately insured and could have the cost paid for by their insurer. Some private schemes provide cash payments to patients who opt for NHS treatment, to deter use of private facilities. A report, by private health analysts Laing and Buisson, in November 2012, estimated that more than 250,000 operations were performed on patients with private medical insurance each year at a cost of £359 million. In addition, £609 million was spent on emergency medical or surgical treatment. Private medical insurance does not normally cover emergency treatment but subsequent recovery could be paid for if the patient were moved into a private patient unit.

=== United States ===

Short Term Health Insurance

On the 1st of August, 2018 the DHHS issued a final rule which made federal changes to Short-Term, Limited-Duration Health Insurance (STLDI) which lengthened the maximum contract term to 364 days and renewal for up to 36 months. This new rule, in combination with the expiration of the penalty for the Individual Mandate of the Affordable Care Act, has been the subject of independent analysis.

The United States health care system relies heavily on private health insurance, which is the primary source of coverage for most Americans. As of 2018, 68.9% of American adults had private health insurance, according to The Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found that in 2011, private insurance was billed for 12.2 million U.S. inpatient hospital stays and incurred approximately $112.5 billion in aggregate inpatient hospital costs (29% of the total national aggregate costs). Public programs provide the primary source of coverage for most senior citizens and for low-income children and families who meet certain eligibility requirements. The primary public programs are Medicare, a federal social insurance program for seniors and certain disabled individuals; and Medicaid, funded jointly by the federal government and states but administered at the state level, which covers certain very low income children and their families. Together, Medicare and Medicaid accounted for approximately 63 percent of the national inpatient hospital costs in 2011. SCHIP is a federal-state partnership that serves certain children and families who do not qualify for Medicaid but who cannot afford private coverage. Other public programs include military health benefits provided through TRICARE and the Veterans Health Administration and benefits provided through the Indian Health Service. Some states have additional programs for low-income individuals.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, health advocacy companies began to appear to help patients deal with the complexities of the healthcare system. The complexity of the healthcare system has resulted in a variety of problems for the American public. A study found that 62 percent of persons declaring bankruptcy in 2007 had unpaid medical expenses of $1000 or more, and in 92% of these cases the medical debts exceeded $5000. Nearly 80 percent who filed for bankruptcy had health insurance. The Medicare and Medicaid programs were estimated to soon account for 50 percent of all national health spending. These factors and many others fueled interest in an overhaul of the health care system in the United States. In 2010 President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This Act includes an &#x27;individual mandate&#x27; that every American must have medical insurance (or pay a fine). Health policy experts such as David Cutler and Jonathan Gruber, as well as the American medical insurance lobby group America&#x27;s Health Insurance Plans, argued this provision was required in order to provide &quot;guaranteed issue&quot; and a &quot;community rating,&quot; which address unpopular features of America&#x27;s health insurance system such as premium weightings, exclusions for pre-existing conditions, and the pre-screening of insurance applicants. During 26–28 March, the Supreme Court heard arguments regarding the validity of the Act. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was determined to be constitutional on 28 June 2012. The Supreme Court determined that Congress had the authority to apply the individual mandate within its taxing powers.

==== History and evolution ====
In the late 19th century, &quot;accident insurance&quot; began to be available, which operated much like modern disability insurance. This payment model continued until the start of the 20th century in some jurisdictions (like California), where all laws regulating health insurance actually referred to disability insurance.

Accident insurance was first offered in the United States by the Franklin Health Assurance Company of Massachusetts. This firm, founded in 1850, offered insurance against injuries arising from railroad and steamboat accidents. Sixty organizations were offering accident insurance in the U.S. by 1866, but the industry consolidated rapidly soon thereafter. While there were earlier experiments, the origins of sickness coverage in the U.S. effectively date from 1890. The first employer-sponsored group disability policy was issued in 1911.

Before the development of medical expense insurance, patients were expected to pay health care costs out of their own pockets, under what is known as the fee-for-service business model. During the middle-to-late 20th century, traditional disability insurance evolved into modern health insurance programs. One major obstacle to this development was that early forms of comprehensive health insurance were enjoined by courts for violating the traditional ban on corporate practice of the professions by for-profit corporations. State legislatures had to intervene and expressly legalize health insurance as an exception to that traditional rule. Today, most comprehensive private health insurance programs cover the cost of routine, preventive, and emergency health care procedures. They also cover or partially cover the cost of certain prescription and over-the-counter drugs. Insurance companies determine what drugs are covered based on price, availability, and therapeutic equivalents. The list of drugs that an insurance program agrees to cover is called a formulary. Additionally, some prescriptions drugs may require a prior authorization before an insurance program agrees to cover its cost.

Hospital and medical expense policies were introduced during the first half of the 20th century. During the 1920s, individual hospitals began offering services to individuals on a pre-paid basis, eventually leading to the development of Blue Cross organizations. The predecessors of today&#x27;s Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) originated beginning in 1929, through the 1930s and on during World War II.

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) regulated the operation of a health benefit plan if an employer chooses to establish one, which is not required. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) gives an ex-employee the right to continue coverage under an employer-sponsored group health benefit plan.

Through the 1990s, managed care insurance schemes including health maintenance organizations (HMO), preferred provider organizations, or point of service plans grew from about 25% US employees with employer-sponsored coverage to the vast majority. With managed care, insurers use various techniques to address costs and improve quality, including negotiation of prices (&quot;in-network&quot; providers), utilization management, and requirements for quality assurance such as being accredited by accreditation schemes such as the Joint Commission and the American Accreditation Healthcare Commission.

Employers and employees may have some choice in the details of plans, including health savings accounts, deductible, and coinsurance. As of 2015, a trend has emerged for employers to offer high-deductible plans, called consumer-driven healthcare plans which place more costs on employees, while employees benefit by paying lower monthly premiums. Additionally, having a high-deductible plan allows employees to open a health savings account, which allows them to contribute pre-tax savings towards future medical needs. Some employers will offer multiple plans to their employees.

=== Russia ===

The private health insurance market, known in Russian as &quot;voluntary health insurance&quot; () to distinguish it from state-sponsored Mandatory Medical Insurance, has experienced sustained levels of growth. It was introduced in October 1992.

<text>The FV4007 Centurion was the primary British Army main battle tank of the post-World War II period. Introduced in 1945, it is widely considered to be one of the most successful post-war tank designs, remaining in production into the 1960s, and seeing combat into the 1980s. The chassis was adapted for several other roles, and these variants have remained in service. It was a very popular tank with good armour, mobility, and a powerful main armament.

Development of the Centurion began in 1943 with manufacture beginning in January 1945. Six prototypes arrived in Belgium less than a month after the war in Europe ended in May 1945. It entered combat with the British Army in the Korean War in 1950 in support of the UN forces. The Centurion later served on the Indian side in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, where it fought against US-supplied M47 and M48 Patton tanks, and it served with the Royal Australian Armoured Corps in the Vietnam War.

Israel&#x27;s army used Centurions in the 1967 Six-Day War, the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the 1978 South Lebanon conflict, and the 1982 Lebanon War. Centurions modified as armoured personnel carriers were used in Gaza, the West Bank and on the Lebanese border. Jordan used Centurions, first in 1970 to fend off the Syrian incursion within its borders during the Jordanian Civil War and later in the Golan Heights in 1973. South Africa deployed its Centurions in Angola during the South African Border War.

The Centurion became one of the most widely used tank designs, equipping dozens of armies around the world, with some in service until the 1990s. During the 2006 Lebanon War, the Israel Defense Forces employed modified Centurions as armoured personnel carriers and combat engineering vehicles. South Africa still operates over 170 Centurions, which were modernised in the 1980s and 2000s as the (elephant).

Between 1946 and 1962, 4,423 Centurions were produced, consisting of 13 basic marks and numerous variants. In the British Army it was replaced by the Chieftain.

== Development ==
In 1943, the Directorate of Tank Design, under Sir Claude Gibb, was asked to produce a new design for a heavy cruiser tank under the General Staff designation A41. After a series of fairly mediocre designs in the A series in the past, and bearing in mind the threat posed by the German 88 mm gun, the War Office demanded a major revision of the design requirements, specifically: increased durability and reliability, the ability to withstand a direct hit from the German 88 mm gun and providing greater protection against mines. Initially in September 1943 the A41 tank was to weigh no more than , the limit for existing Mark I and Mark II transport trailers and for a Bailey bridge of span. The British railway loading gauge required that the width should not exceed and the optimum width was , but, critically, for the new tank this restriction had been lifted by the War Office under pressure from the Department of Tank Design. A high top speed was not important, while agility was to be equal to that of the Comet. A high reverse speed was specified, as during the fighting in southern Italy, Allied tanks were trapped in narrow sunken roads by the German Army. The modified production gearbox had a two-speed reverse, with the higher reverse speed similar to second gear.

The Department produced a larger hull by replacing the long-travel five-wheel Christie suspension used on the Comet with a six wheel Horstmann suspension, and extending the spacing between the second and third wheels. The Christie suspension, with vertical spring coils between side armour plates, was replaced by a Horstmann suspension with three horizontally sprung, externally mounted two-wheel bogies on each side. The Horstmann design did not offer the same ride quality as the Christie system, but took up less room and was easier to maintain. In case of damage by mines, individual suspension and wheel units could be replaced relatively easily. The hull was redesigned with welded, sloped armour and featured a partially cast turret with the highly regarded 17 pounder (76.2 mm/3-inch) as the main gun and a 20 mm Polsten cannon in an independent mounting to its left. With a Rover-built Rolls-Royce Meteor engine, as used on the Comet and Cromwell, the new design would have excellent performance.

But even before the Outline Specification of the A41 was released in October 1943, these limits were removed, and the weight was increased from 40 tons to , because of the need for heavier armour and a wider turret (too wide for the tank to be transported by rail) with a more powerful gun. The new version carried armour equal to the heaviest infantry tanks, while improved suspension and engines provided cross-country performance superior to even the early cruiser tanks. The War Office decided it would be wiser to build new trailers, rather than hamper what appeared to be a superb design. Historian David Fletcher states, &quot;But was Centurion, after all, a Universal Tank? The answer has to be a qualified negative.&quot;
The design mockup, built by AEC Ltd, was viewed in May 1944. Subsequently, twenty pilot models were ordered with various armament combinations: ten with a 17 pounder and a 20 mm Polsten gun (of which half had a Besa machine gun in the turret rear and half an escape door), five with a 17-pounder, a forward Besa machine gun and an escape door, and five with a QF 77 mm gun and a driver-operated hull machine gun.

Prototypes of the original 40-ton design, the Centurion Mark I, had 76 mm of armour in the front glacis, which was thinner than that on the then current infantry tanks (the Churchill), which had 101 mm or 152 mm on the Churchill Mk VII and VIII being produced at the time. However, the glacis plate was highly sloped, and so the effective thickness of the armour was very high—a design feature shared by other effective designs, such as the German Panther tank and Soviet T-34. The turret was well armoured at 152 mm. The tank was also highly mobile, and easily outperformed the Comet in most tests. The uparmoured Centurion Mark II soon arrived; it had a new 118 mm-thick glacis and the side and rear armour had been increased from 38 mm to 51 mm. Only a handful of Mk I Centurions had been produced when the Mk II replaced it on the production lines. Full production began in November 1945 with an order for 800 on production lines at Leyland Motors, Lancashire the Royal Ordnance Factories ROF Leeds and Royal Arsenal, and Vickers at Elswick. The tank entered service in December 1946 with the 5th Royal Tank Regiment.

=== Continued development ===
Soon after the Centurion&#x27;s introduction, Royal Ordnance finished work on the 84 mm calibre Ordnance QF 20 pounder tank gun. With this, the Centurion went through another upgrade to mount the 20-pounder. By this point, the usefulness of the 20 mm Polsten had been called into question, it being unnecessarily large for use against troops, so it was replaced with a Besa machine gun in a completely cast turret. The new Centurion Mark III also featured a fully automatic stabilisation system for the gun, allowing it to fire accurately while on the move, dramatically improving battlefield performance. Production of the Mk 3 began in 1948. The Mk 3 proved substantially more capable than prior variants, resulting in the earlier designs being removed from service as soon as the new Mk 3s became available, and existing tanks were then either converted into the Centurion armoured recovery vehicle (ARV) Mark 1 for use by the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers or upgraded to Mk 3 standard. Improvements introduced with the Mk 3 included a more powerful version of the engine and a new gun sight and gun stabiliser.
The 20 pounder gun was used until the Royal Ordnance Factories introduced the 105 mm L7 gun in 1959. All later variants of the Centurion, from Mark 5/2 on, used the L7.

Design work for the Mk 7 was completed in 1953, with production beginning soon afterwards. One disadvantage of earlier versions was the limited range, initially just on hard roads, hence external auxiliary tanks and then a &quot;monowheel&quot; trailer were used. But the Mk7 had a third fuel tank inside the hull, giving a range of . Additionally, it was found possible to put the Centurion on some European rail routes with their larger loading gauges.

The Centurion was used as the basis for a range of specialist equipment, including combat engineering variants with a 165 mm demolition gun Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE). It is one of the longest-serving designs of all time, serving as a battle tank for the British and Australian armies from the Korean War (1950–1953) to the Vietnam War (1961–1972), and as an AVRE during Operation Desert Storm in January–February 1991.

=== Production ===
The development cost of Centurion did not exceed £5 million. The cost of a Centurion tank was £35,000 in 1950, but had risen to £38,000 in 1952. Of this, &quot;the gun control equipment costs £1,600, and the actual gadget that works the stabiliser only £100.&quot; By comparison, during World War II a Covenanter tank cost the British Government £12,000, a Crusader tank cost £13,700, a Matilda tank cost £18,000, and a Valentine tank £14,900; in 1967 a Chieftain tank cost between £90,000 and £95,000, and in 1984 a Challenger 1 tank cost £1.5 million. In 1955, Sir Edward Boyle (the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Supply) told the House of Commons that &quot;the cost of the Centurion tank has been coming down recently as production has settled into its stride.&quot; 

== Service history ==

=== Korean War ===
On 14 November 1950, the British Army&#x27;s 8th King&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars, equipped with three squadrons (64 tanks) of Centurion Mk 3, landed in Pusan. The first recorded Centurion kill occurred near Seoul against a North Korean captured Cromwell tank. Operating in sub-zero temperatures, the 8th Hussars learnt the rigors of winter warfare: their tanks had to be parked on straw to prevent the steel tracks from freezing to the ground. Engines had to be started every half-hour, with each gear being engaged in turn to prevent them from being frozen into place. During the Battle of the Imjin River, Centurions won lasting fame when they covered the withdrawal of the 29th Brigade, with the loss of five tanks, most later recovered and repaired. In 1952, Centurions of the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards were also involved in the Second Battle of the Hook where they played a significant role in repelling Chinese attacks. Centurions of the 1st Royal Tank Regiment participated in the Third Battle of the Hook repelling the PLA and also were involved in the Battle of the Samichon River in 1953. In a tribute to the 8th Hussars, General John O&#x27;Daniel, commanding the US 1st Corps, stated: &quot;In their Centurions, the 8th Hussars have evolved a new type of tank warfare. They taught us that anywhere a tank can go, is tank country: &quot;even the tops of mountains&quot;.&quot; However, the lack of pintle-mounted machine guns on the turret meant that the Centurion was only able to fire in one direction and so was vulnerable to infantry attacks.

=== Deployment in Western Europe ===
By early 1952, with the Cold War heating up, NATO needed modern heavy tanks to meet the T-34 versions with the Warsaw Pact countries, and to deter Soviet forces by stationing them with the BAOR in West Germany, where the French had just the light AMX-13, and the Germans had none. America was keen to have Centurions supplied to Denmark and the Netherlands under the Mutual Defence Assistance Program, as production of the M48 Patton would not start until April 1952. A Mk 3 cost £31,000 or £44,000 with ammunition. The Royal Canadian Armoured Corps deployed a regiment of Centurions to Germany to support the Canadian Brigade.

=== Suez Crisis ===
During the Suez Crisis, British ground commander General Sir Hugh Stockwell believed that methodical and systematic armoured operations centred on the Centurion would be the key to victory.

The Egyptians destroyed Port Said&#x27;s Inner Harbour, which forced the British to improvise and use the Fishing Harbour to land their forces. The 2nd Brigade of the Parachute Regiment landed by ship in the harbour. Centurions of the British 6th Royal Tank Regiment were landed and by 12:00 they had reached the French paratroopers. While the British were landing at Port Said, the men of the 2 RPC at Raswa fought off Egyptian counter-attacks featuring SU-100 tank destroyers.

After establishing themselves in a position in downtown Port Said, 42 Commando headed down the Shari Muhammad Ali, the main north–south road to link up with the French forces at the Raswa bridge and the Inner Basin lock. While doing so, the Marines also took Port Said&#x27;s gasworks. Meanwhile, 40 Commando supported by the Royal Tank Regiment remained engaged in clearing the downtown of Egyptian snipers. Lieutenant Colonel Norman Tailyour arranged for more reinforcements to be brought in via helicopter.

=== Vietnam War ===
In 1967, the Royal Australian Armoured Corps&#x27; (RAAC), 1st Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) Squadron transferred to &quot;A&quot; Squadron, 3rd Cavalry Regiment in South Vietnam. Although they successfully conducted combat operations in their areas of operations, reports from the field stated that their lightly-armoured M113A1 armoured personnel carriers were unable to force their way through dense jungle limiting their offensive actions against enemy forces. The Australian government, under criticism in Parliament, decided to send a squadron of Australian Centurion tanks to South Vietnam. The 20-pdr armed Australian Centurions of &#x27;C&#x27; Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment landed in South Vietnam on 24 February 1968, being headquartered at Nui Dat in III Corps (MR3).

Colonel Donald Dunstan, later to be governor of South Australia, was the deputy task force commander of the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) in South Vietnam. Dunstan had quite possibly been the last Australian to use tanks and infantry in a combined operation during the Second World War (as part of the Bougainville campaign), and the first since the war to command Australia&#x27;s tanks and infantry in combat. When he temporarily took over command during Brigadier Ronald Hughes&#x27;s absence, he directed that the Centurions be brought up from Nui Dat to reinforce firebases &quot;Coral&quot; and &quot;Balmoral&quot;, believing that they were a strong element that were not being used. Besides adding a great deal of firepower, Dunstan stated, he &quot;couldn&#x27;t see any reason why they [the Centurions] shouldn&#x27;t be there&quot;. His foresight enabled 1 ATF to kill approximately 267 soldiers from the 141st and 165th North Vietnamese Army Regiments during the six-week-long Battle of Coral–Balmoral in May 1968, as well as capturing 11 prisoners, 36 crew-served weapons, 112 small arms, and other miscellaneous enemy weapons.
After the Battle of Coral-Balmoral, a third Centurion troop, which included two tankdozers, was formed. By September 1968, &#x27;C&#x27; Squadron was brought to its full strength of four troops, each equipped with four Centurion tanks. By 1969, &#x27;B&#x27; Squadron, 3rd Cavalry; &#x27;A&#x27; Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment; &#x27;B&#x27; Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment; and &#x27;C&#x27; Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment, had all made rotations through South Vietnam. Originally deployed as 26 Centurion tanks, after three and a half years of combat operations, 58 Centurions had served in country; 42 had suffered battle damage with six beyond repair and two crewmen had been killed in action.

The Centurion crews, after operating for a few weeks in country, soon learned to remove the protective armoured side skirts from both sides of the tank, to prevent the vegetation and mud from building up between the track and the mudguards. Each Centurion in Vietnam normally carried a basic load of 62 rounds of 20 pounder shells, 4,000 rounds of .50 cal and 9,000 rounds of .30 cal machine gun ammunition for the tank commander&#x27;s machine gun as well as the two coaxial machine guns. They were equipped with petrol engines, which necessitated the use of an extra externally mounted fuel tank, which was attached to the vehicle&#x27;s rear.

=== Indo-Pakistani wars ===
In 1965, the bulk of India&#x27;s tank fleet was older M4 Sherman tanks, but India also had Centurion Mk.7 tanks, with the 20 pounder gun, and also AMX-13 and M3 Stuart light tanks. The Centurion Mk.7 at that time was one of the most modern western tanks.

The offensive of Pakistan&#x27;s 1st Armoured Division was blunted at the Battle of Asal Uttar on 10 September. Six Pakistani armoured regiments were opposed by three Indian armoured regiments. One of these regiments, 3 Cavalry, fielded 45 Centurion tanks. The Centurion, with its 20-pounder gun and heavy armour, proved to be more than a match for the M47 and M48 Pattons. On the other side, when Pakistani Army armoured division primary composed of M47 and M48 Pattons, they proved to be able to penetrate only a few of the Centurion tanks, as witnessed in the Battle of Chawinda in the Sialkot sector. A post-war US study of the tank battles in South Asia concluded that the Patton&#x27;s armour could be penetrated by the 20-pounder tank gun (84 mm) of the Centurion (later replaced by the even more successful L7 105 mm gun on the Mk. 7 version which India also possessed) as well as the 75 mm tank gun of the AMX-13 light tank.

In 1971, at the Battle of Basantar, an armoured division and an armoured brigade of the Pakistani I Corps confronted two armoured brigades of the Indian I Corps, which had Centurion tanks. This resulted in a substantial tank battle, between the American-built tanks of the Pakistani Army and the Indian Army&#x27;s mixture of Soviet T-55s and British Centurions. Casualties were heavily skewed against the Pakistani force, with 46 tanks destroyed.

=== Middle East ===

The first country which bought Centurion tanks was Egypt. The first tanks were received in 1950. Israel&#x27;s formerly British Centurions were first delivered in 1959. Differing varieties of the Centurion were bought by Israel over the years from many different countries or captured in combat. Following their acquisition the Israelis quickly upgraded the tanks with British 105 mm L7 instead of the original 20-pounder main gun and renamed them Sho&#x27;t (&quot;scourge&quot; or &quot;whip&quot;).
When the Six-Day War broke out in 1967, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had 293 Centurion / Sho&#x27;t tanks that were ready for combat out of a total of 385 tanks. In Sinai, Egypt had 30 Centurion tanks. All 30 Egyptian tanks were destroyed or captured by Israel during the conflict. Israel also captured about 30 Jordanian Centurion tanks from a total of 90 in Jordanian service. 25 tanks were abandoned in Hebron by the 10th Jordanian Independent Tank Regiment.

All Sho&#x27;t tanks were upgraded with the more efficient Continental AVDS-1790-2A diesel engine (also used in the M48 and the M60 tanks) and an Allison CD-850-6 transmission from 1970 to 1974. The upgraded version was named Sho&#x27;t Kal Alef, and was later followed by three additional sub-variants called Bet, Gimel and Dalet according to the upgrades added. The upgrades included thicker armour, new turret rotating mechanism, new gun stabiliser, improved ammunition layout with more rounds, and increased fuel capacity. A modern fire control system, an improved fire extinguisher system, better electrical system and brakes, and the capability of installing reactive armour completed the modifications. They had American radios and either the original 7.62 mm calibre MG on the commander&#x27;s cupola or a 12.7 mm calibre HMG. The Sho&#x27;t Kal could be distinguished from the Centurion by its raised rear deck, to accommodate the bigger engine.
The Sho&#x27;t Kal version of Centurion earned its legendary status during the Battle of &quot;The Valley of Tears&quot; on the Golan Heights in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. 105 Sho&#x27;t Kal tanks of the 7th Armoured Brigade and 20 Sho&#x27;t tanks of the 188th Brigade defeated the advance of some 500 Syrian T-55s and T-62s and the Sho&#x27;t Kal became emblematic of Israeli armour&#x27;s prowess. During the entire war, 1,063 Israeli tanks were disabled (more than half of them Centurions), about 600 of which were completely destroyed or captured. Some 35 Israeli Centurions were captured by Egypt, dozens more were captured by Syria and Iraq and four by Jordan. On the other hand, 2,250 Arab tanks were disabled (including 33 Jordanian Centurions, 18 of them destroyed), 1,274 of them were destroyed or captured (643 tanks were lost in the north and 631 were lost in the south). After the war, to replace Israeli losses, the United States delivered 200 M60 and M48 tanks and the United Kingdom delivered 400 Centurion tanks to Israel.

Sho&#x27;t Kal tanks with Blazer reactive armour package were used in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. During the war, 21 Centurion tanks were knocked out, of which 8 were destroyed.

The Israelis started to retire the Sho&#x27;t Kal during the 1980s and they were completely retired during the 2000s. Most of them were converted to Nagmasho&#x27;t, Nagmachon, and Nakpadon (heavy armoured personnel carriers or Infantry Fighting Vehicles) and Puma armoured engineering vehicles.

=== Jordan ===

Fifty Centurions were purchased by Jordan between 1954 and 1956 and by 1967 about 90 Centurions were in service. The Jordanian Army used its Centurion tanks in the Six-Day War. In 1967, the 10th Independent Tank Regiment was equipped with 44 Centurion Mk.V tanks armed with 20pdr guns, but was initially deployed on the East Bank. Later, the unit was moved urgently to the Hebron area, in West Bank, in order to link with the supposed Egyptian advance. Some Centurion tanks were destroyed and about 30 captured by the Israeli Army. Israelis entering Hebron captured 25 Jordanian Centurion tanks. The Royal Guards Brigade had one regiment that was also equipped with Centurions.

After the 1967 war, the army was rearmed and more Centurion tanks were purchased.

In September 1970 (Black September) Jordan used Centurions of the 40th Armoured Brigade against invading Syrian T-55 tanks. Jordan lost 75 to 90 tanks out of 200 involved. Most of them were destroyed by Syrian tank fire at ar-Ramtha, while others were destroyed by the PLO in Amman.
Palestinians used captured Centurion tanks against the Jordanian army.

In 1972, Centurion tanks were reequipped with 105 mm guns. During the Yom Kippur War, the Jordanian 40th Armoured Brigade was deployed in the Golan front to support Syrian troops and show King Hussein&#x27;s concern for Arab solidarity. The 40th Armoured Brigade moved northward towards Sheikh Meskin, but its counterattack was uncoordinated and largely ineffective as the Israelis were in prepared defensive positions.

In 1982–1985, 293 surviving Centurions of the Jordanian Army were refitted with the diesel engine and transmission of the M60A1 tank in place of the original Meteor petrol engine, Belgian SABCA computerised fire-control system, which incorporated a laser range-finder and passive night sight for the gunner, Cadillac Gage electro-hydraulic turret drive and stabilisation system and a new Teledyne Continental hydropneumatic suspension in place of the Horstmann units. These upgraded vehicles were called the Tariq. After retirement from service with the arrival of ex-British Challenger tanks in the late 1990s, several Tariqs were converted into heavy APCs (Dawsar).

=== British use of Centurion AVREs ===
In 1972 during Operation Motorman in Northern Ireland, 165mm-armed Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVREs) with dozer blades were used to destroy barricades set up by the IRA in Northern Ireland. The 165mm demolition guns were pointed to the rear and covered up.

During Operation Desert Storm in 1991, 12 FV4003 Centurion Mk5 AVREs were deployed with 32 Armoured Engineer Regiment as part of British operations during the campaign. Three were lost in training in two separate incidents involving vehicle fires and detonation of munitions. One AVRE was destroyed on 5 February 1991 and two were destroyed in a second incident the next day. Four minor injuries were sustained. No AVRES saw action during the operation.

=== South Africa ===

South Africa ordered 203 Centurion Mk 3 tanks from the United Kingdom in 1953. The South African Centurions entered service between 1955 and 1958, and included about 17 armoured recovery vehicles. South Africa&#x27;s major strategic priorities at the time revolved around assisting the British Armed Forces and other member states of the Commonwealth of Nations during a conventional war in the Middle East or Anglophone Africa. The Centurions were procured specifically because they were compatible with Commonwealth tank tactics and pre-existing British armoured formations.

Following South Africa&#x27;s withdrawal from the Commonwealth in 1961, its priorities shifted toward internal security and diversifying national arms procurement outside traditional suppliers such as the United Kingdom. To that end, 100 Centurion Mk 3s and 10 Centurion-based recovery vehicles were sold off to Switzerland in 1961. The remaining Centurions were largely relegated to reserve roles as a result of maintenance problems compounded by parts shortages and a tendency to overheat in the hot African climate. In 1972, the South African Army retrofitted some of its Centurions with the engines and transmission of American-made M48 Patton tanks in an attempt to improve technical performance. The upgraded Centurions were designated &quot;Skokiaan&quot; and proved unpopular due to their high fuel consumption and poor operating range.

Tanks reentered the mainstream of South African military doctrine in 1975, following Operation Savannah, which saw the lightly armoured South African forces in Angola threatened by large formations of Soviet tanks supplied to the People&#x27;s Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) and their Cuban allies. Operation Savannah was followed by further modifications and trials under Project &quot;Semel&quot;, and the South African government was obliged to finance the creation of a new private sector enterprise, the Olifant Manufacturing Company (OMC), to refurbish the Centurions. During this period South Africa managed to restore its tank fleet to its original size by purchasing a number of surplus Centurion hulls from Jordan and India. The passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 418, which imposed a mandatory arms embargo on the country, forced South Africa to purchase the hulls without turrets or armament. OMC upgraded each Centurion with a 29-litre Continental turbocharged diesel engine and a new transmission adopted from the M60 Patton. The refurbished Centurions were also armed with a South African variant of the Royal Ordnance L7 105 mm main gun. They were accepted into service with the South African Armoured Corps as the Olifant Mk1A in 1985.

South African expeditionary forces clashed with FAPLA T-54/55 tanks during Operation Askari in late 1983 and early 1984; however, due to the enormous logistical commitment needed to keep the Olifants operational so far from conventional repair facilities, they were not deployed. At length the South African mechanised infantry, bolstered by Eland and Ratel-90 armoured car squadrons, succeeded in destroying the tanks on their own, although severe delays were encountered due to their lack of adequate anti-tank weaponry. Morale also suffered when inexperienced armoured car crews were ordered to take on the Angolan T-54/55s in their vulnerable vehicles. Criticism in this regard led to the deployment of a single squadron of thirteen Olifant Mk1As to the Angolan border, where they were attached to the 61 Mechanised Battalion Group. Following the Lusaka Accords, which effectively ensured a ceasefire between South Africa and Angola, these Olifants were placed into storage and the tank crews rotated out.

The collapse of the Lusaka Accords and the subsequent launch of Operation Moduler in late 1987 led to the Olifant squadron being reactivated on the direct orders of South African State President P.W. Botha. On 9 November 1987 the Olifants destroyed two Angolan T-55s during a heated nine-minute skirmish. This marked the first occasion South African tanks had been sent into battle since World War II. Throughout Operation Moduler, South African forces typically dispersed into an &quot;arrowhead&quot; formation, with Olifants in the lead, Ratel-90 armoured cars on the flanks, and the remainder of the mechanised infantry to the rear and centre. Three Olifants were abandoned in a minefield during Operation Packer and subsequently captured by FAPLA, while another two were damaged beyond immediate repair by mines but successfully recovered. A number of others suffered varying degrees of track and suspension damage due to mines or Angolan tank fire, but were able to keep moving after field repairs.

In the early 1990s, the Olifant Mk1A was superseded by the Olifant Mk1B, which incorporated major improvements in armour protection, a slightly more powerful engine, a double armoured floor for protection against mines, and a torsion bar suspension.

=== Sweden ===
At the end of the Second World War, it was clear that the mix of tanks in service with the Swedish Armed Forces was not just obsolete but also presented a large logistical problem. Kungliga Arméförvaltningens Tygavdelning (KAFT, the weapons bureau of the army administrative service) conducted a study that concluded that the most cost-effective alternative would be to purchase the newly developed Centurion Mk 3, which, while quite modern, was judged to also have upgrade potential for future requirements. A purchase request was sent to Great Britain, but the reply was that no deliveries could be made before the needs of the British Army had been satisfied, which it was estimated would take between five and 15 years. Thus, in 1951, the vehicle bureau of KAFT was set to develop a Swedish alternative project, E M I L. Parallel with this, negotiations were initiated with France about buying the AMX-13.
The British stance altered in early December 1952, due to the economic necessity of increasing exports to earn scarce foreign currency. Britain offered to sell the desired Centurions immediately. Minister of Defence Torsten Nilsson arbitrarily placed an order of 80 Mk 3, with Swedish Army designation &quot;Stridsvagn 81&quot; (Strv 81), around new year 1952/1953, with the first delivery in April 1953. In 1955, Sweden ordered a batch of 160 Centurion Mk 5 (also designated Strv 81), followed by a batch of 110 Centurion Mk 10 around 1960 (designated Strv 101). The Centurions, together with the Stridsvagn 103, formed the backbone of the Swedish armoured brigades for several decades. The Mk 3 and the Mk 5 were upgraded with a 105 mm gun in the 1960s, becoming Strv 102.

Between 1983 and 1987, the Centurions had a midlife renovation and modification (REMO) done, which included among other things night vision equipment, targeting systems, laser range finders, improved gun stabilisation, thermal sleeves on the barrel and exhaust pipes and reactive armour developed by the Swedish FFV Ordnance. Around 80 Strv 102 were upgraded with Continental diesel engines and Allison gearboxes in the early 1980s, becoming Strv 104.

The Swedish Army gradually phased out its Centurions and Strv 103s during the 1990s as a consequence of comparative tests of the T-72, Leclerc, M1A2 and Leopard 2 Improved They were replaced with the Stridsvagn 121 and Stridsvagn 122.

=== Nuclear tests ===

An Australian Army Mk 3 Centurion Type K, Army Registration Number 169041, was involved in a small nuclear test at Emu Field in Australia in 1953 as part of Operation Totem 1. Built as number 39/190 at the Royal Ordnance Factory, Barnbow in 1951 it was assigned the British Army number 06 BA 16 and supplied to the Australian Commonwealth Government under Contract 2843 in 1952.

It was placed less than from the 9.1 kt blast with its turret facing the epicentre, left with the engine running and a full ammunition load. Examination after detonation found that it had been pushed away from the blast point by about , pushed slightly left and that its engine had stopped working, but only because it had run out of fuel. Antennae were missing, lights and periscopes were heavily sandblasted, the cloth mantlet cover was incinerated, and the armoured side plates had been blown off and carried up to from the tank. It could still be driven from the site. Had the tank been manned, the crew would most likely have been killed by the shock wave. 

169041, subsequently nicknamed &quot;The Atomic Tank&quot;, was used in the Vietnam War. In May 1969, during a firefight, 169041 (call sign 24C) was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG). The turret crew were all wounded by fragmentation as the RPG hollow charge jet entered the lower left side of the fighting compartment, travelled diagonally across the floor and lodged in the rear right corner. Trooper Carter was evacuated, while the others remained on duty and the tank remained battleworthy.

&quot;The Atomic Tank&quot; was located at Robertson Barracks in Palmerston, Northern Territory, before being moved to RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia. Although other tanks were subjected to nuclear tests, 169041 is the only one known to have withstood a blast and to have later fought in a war.

;FV 3802 : Self-propelled 25-pdr (88 mm) artillery prototype based on the Centurion—engine at the rear as in the gun tank, but only five road wheels per side. The gun was fitted in a barbette with 45° traverse to each side. Accepted in principle in 1954, but abandoned in favour of FV3805 in 1956.

;FV 3805 : Self-propelled  artillery prototype, again based on the Centurion—engine at the front and driver over the trackguard. Project stopped in 1960 in favour of the FV433 105 mm SP Abbot. The single surviving prototype of the FV3805, which had its gun removed, is known to be located on the Isle of Wight on the south coast of England. This prototype was converted into an artillery observation vehicle. As of August 2015, there is currently a crowd-sourced restoration project in process, with the intent to restore the vehicle to fully operational and running capacity.

;FV 4002 Centurion Mk 5 Bridgelayer: (1963) – Mk 5 chassis with a No 5 Tank Bridge. The bridge could be launched in less than two minutes, could span a gap of and with a height difference of up to and could bear up to 80 tons.

;FV 4003 Centurion Mk 5 AVRE 165: (1963) – AVRE (Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers) vehicle with a 165 mm demolition gun with a range of about and firing a HESH projectile for breaching obstacles. It was fitted with a hydraulically operated dozer blade or a mine plough and could carry a fascine bundle or a roll of metal Class 60 Trackway, tow the Viper mine-clearance equipment or a trailer. This variant had a five-man crew and was used in the 1972 Operation Motorman and in the 1991 Gulf War.

;FV 4004 Conway : &quot;FV 4004 Self-propelled gun, 120 mm, L1 gun, Mk 3&quot; prototype based on a Centurion Mark 3 hull with a larger calibre 120 mm L1 gun in a turret designed by Auster and made by Chubb of rolled plate. Due to the long recoil of the gun, the gun had to mounted higher up to avoid striking the turret ring and had limited elevation and depression. It was intended to be an interim design until the Conqueror tank, which had the same gun entered service. One was built before the project was cancelled in 1951.

;FV 4005 Stage1/Stage 2: An experimental tank destroyer with a 183 mm gun L4, which was a modified version of the BL howitzer. The project started in 1951/52, as an effort to quickly put the gun on a Centurion hull alongside the intended FV215 Heavy Tank project, and developed in July 1955. The Stage 1 used an open mount fixed gun with a loader assistant device for firing trials, this was then developed into the Stage 2 with a lightly armoured, fully enclosed and traversable turret but with the loading assist removed. By August 1957, the tank destroyer was dismantled. It was later reassembled, replacing the original Centurion Mk.3 Hull with Mk.12 Hull, and put on display in the Bovington Tank Museum. In November 2023 the turret was removed from the Mk.12 Hull before being placed on an Mk.3 hull and restored to running condition.

;FV 4006 Centurion ARV Mk 2: (1956) – Mk 1 / Mk 2 / Mk 3 hull with the turret replaced by a superstructure housing a winch. The winch was powered by an auxiliary engine and was capable of pulling of up to 90 tons using a system of blocks. Armed with a single machine gun on the commander&#x27;s cupola.
;FV 4007 Centurion Mk 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8/1, 8/2
;FV 4008 Duplex Drive Amphibious Landing Kit: 12 lightweight panels forming a skirt around a permanently fixed deck; the panels were jettisoned with explosive charges.
;FV 4010 a.k.a. Heavy Tank Destroyer G.W. Carrier: Malkara Anti Tank Guided Missile launcher vehicle
;FV 4011 Centurion Mk 5
;FV 4012 Centurion Mk 7/1, 7/2
;FV 4013 Centurion ARV Mk 1: (1952) – Based on Mk 1 / Mk 2 hull. Turret replaced by a superstructure housing a winch driven by a Bedford QL truck engine. About 180 units were built, some of them were used in the Korean War. After 1959, they were used solely as training vehicles.
;FV 4015 Centurion Mk 9
;FV 4016 Centurion ARK: (1963) – Armoured Ramp Carrier. Built on a Mark 5, the vehicle itself was part of the bridge. It could span a gap of up to , and could bear up to 80 tons.
;FV 4017 Centurion Mk 10
;FV 4018 Centurion BARV (1963): Beach Armoured Recovery Vehicle. The last Centurion variant to be used by the British Army. One vehicle was still in use by the Royal Marines until 2003. Replaced by the Hippo, which is based on a Leopard 1 chassis.
;FV 4019 Centurion Mk 5 Bulldozer: (1961) – Centurion Mk V with a dozer blade identical to that of the Centurion AVRE. One such tank was usually given to every Centurion-equipped squadron.
;FV 4202 &quot;40 ton Centurion&quot;: Used to demonstrate various concepts later used in the Chieftain. A Rolls-Royce Meteorite engine with five pairs of smaller wheels. It had a needle nose turret front carrying a 20-pounder gun, welded to the rear of a Centurion turret. The driver had a reclining seat but could not operate the vehicle in the reclined position.

All Israeli Centurion 105-mm-gunned &quot;Sho&#x27;t&quot; variants are an upgrade and advancement of the previous variant, and were produced after one another. Sho&#x27;ts were converted to armoured personnel carriers after their service.
;Sho&#x27;t (English – &quot;Whip&quot;)
:A standard Israeli designation of the Centurion with a 105 mm L7.

==== Singapore ====
;Tempest
:Operated by Singapore, modernised with Israeli assistance, similar to Israeli variant, with diesel engine and new main gun, and possibly reactive armour. Tank is highly classified within the Singapore Army, resulting in an extremely scarce amount of information.

==== Netherlands ====

; and Mk 5/2 NL
:Circa 1965, Dutch Mk 5 and 5/2 tanks were equipped with infrared headlights, searchlight, and viewing equipment, of Philips design instead of the types used on British tanks. Around the same time, a .50-caliber ranging machine gun was added, as was a spare wheel bracket on the rear of the turret, and from 1969, the M1919 Browning machine guns were replaced by FN MAGs. From 1973, the tanks&#x27; radio sets were replaced by Philips-designed ones.
:Between 1962 and 1965, 17 Mk 5 gun tanks were converted to bridge layers (Dutch: &quot;bruggenlegger&quot;), using the same bridge and mechanism as the American M48 and M60 AVLBs.
:Also in 1962–65, 17 Mk 5s with 20-pounder guns were converted to dozer tanks by fitting adapted blades from old M4 Sherman dozers. Once ammunition stocks for the 20-pounders were exhausted, the guns were removed and the turrets fixed facing to the rear, with the smoke grenade launchers relocated to the now front of the turret with spotlights installed there as well to assist dozer operations at night.

==== South Africa ====

;Olifant
: Centurion tanks redesigned and rebuilt by South Africa with the help of Israel; considered the best indigenous tank design on the African continent.

;;Olifant Mk 2
:Redesigned turret, new fire control system. Can mount an LIW 105 mm GT-8 rifled gun or a 120 mm smooth bore gun.

==== Sweden ====
The designations follows the pattern of main gun calibre in centimetres followed by the service order number. Hence the Strv 81 is read as the first tank with an 8 cm gun, while the Strv 101 is the first tank with a 10 cm gun that was accepted into service.

;Stridsvagn 81
:Swedish Army designation for both the initial 80 Mk 3 Centurions (20 pdr gun) and the 1955 purchase of 160 Mk 5 Centurions, all with Imperial instrumentation, Swedish radios, etc. Pre-NATO threading made the screws incompatible with the later Strv 101.

== Operators ==
=== Current operators ===
* Israel: Gun tanks retired, many hulls converted to Nagmachon APCs, Nakpadon ARVs or Puma CEVs.
* Jordan: Chassis re-used for the modern Temsah APC
* South Africa: In service as the indigenously developed and upgraded Mk1A/B and Mk2 Olifant tank

=== Former operators ===
* Australia: Replaced by Leopard 1.
* Austria: Now fixed in bunkers.
* Canada: Initially ordered 274 Mk 3 tanks, plus nine armoured recovery vehicles and four bridge-layers and additional orders followed. The Mk 5 (upgunned to 105 mm) were used later. From 1969 to 1970, the Canadian Army lists 77 tanks based in Germany (mostly Mk 5 and Mk 11&#x27;s) and the remainder in Canada (60 at CFB Wainwright AB, 59 at CFSD Longue-Pointe QC, 46 at CFB Gagetown NB, 30 at CFB Borden, 29 at CFB Meaford ON, 27 at CFB Calgary AB, 12 at CFB Petawawa ON, six at RCEME School Kingston ON and one at the LETE Test Establishment Orleans, CFB Ottawa ON) for a total of 347 tanks (including 120 Mk 5s, three Mk 5 recovery tanks and some Mk 11s with IR and ranging guns fitted). Replaced by Leopard C1. Many of the tanks were sold to Israel, which converted them to diesel. Some are still in use as variants.
* Denmark: 216 tanks plus 14 armoured recovery vehicles and 4 bridge-layers all types augmented by Leopard 1 variants
* Egypt: Replaced by T-55s, T-62s, M60A3s and M1A1s.
* India: Retired
* Iraq: Retired
* Kuwait: 50. Handed over to Somalia in the later half of 1979.
* Lebanon


* Netherlands: Initially received 435 Mk 3 tanks beginning in 1953, increased to 592 by 1956; all were paid for by the United States as part of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act. As one was lost to an accidental fire in 1953, 591 gun tanks were on strength, and were soon upgraded to Mk 5 standard with 20-pounder gun and the British radio sets replaced by American types; one fuel mono-trailer was also available per tank. From 1956 to 1958, 66 ARV Mk 2s were procured, and in 1959–60, 70 Mk 7 tanks were delivered from the UK; these were all held in war reserve until 1969, when they were disposed of. Over the years 1960–72, 343 Mk 5 tanks were gradually upgunned with 105 mm guns to Mk 5/2 standard, as were 19 Mk 7s (to Mk 7/2) in 1966–68. Between 1962 and 1965, 17 Mk 5 tanks were converted to bridge layers, using the same bridge and mechanism as the American M48 and M60 AVLBs; at the same time, another 17 Mk 5s with 20-pounder guns were converted to dozer tanks. As an experiment, one Mk 5/2 and one Mk 7/2 were converted by installing a diesel engine in 1968; though successful, it was not adopted because the cost approached that of buying a new Leopard 1. All Centurions were replaced by Leopard 2 MBTs in the 1980s, after having been used alongside Leopard 1s in the 1970s. Many Mk 5 and all Mk 7 tanks were returned to the United States (which had paid for them), which appears to have shipped most to Israel.
* New Zealand: Used 12 vehicles in the variant Mk 3 (three tanks) from UK, Mk 5 and 5/1 (total eight tanks) from British Army in Hong Kong and one ARV from UK. Retired from services in 1968 and seven tanks together with the ARV sold to Australia. Two have been preserved and have been handed over to the museum. The other two went to the Waiouru training ground as hard range targets.
* Socialist Republic of Romania: Defector Ion Mihai Pacepa claimed Romania received one example from Israel in 1978 in exchange for increased immigration of Romanian Jews to Israel. Pacepa further states that Nicolae Ceaușescu had planned to produce the Centurion under license.
* Singapore: 63 Centurion Mk3 and Mk7s bought from India in 1975 and more from Israel in 1993–1994, all upgraded to Israeli standard with new main guns and diesel engines It has since been placed into storage and replaced by the Leopard 2SGs.
* Somalia: Christopher F. Foss, writing in the second edition of &quot;Jane&#x27;s Main Battle Tanks&quot; said that &#x27;Kuwait was believed to have supplied Somalia with about 35 Centurions.&#x27; The &quot;Military Balance 1987–88&quot; (p. 112) listed 30 Centurions held by the Somali Army.
* Sweden: Replaced by Stridsvagn 121 (Leopard 2A4)
* Switzerland: Replaced by Leopard 2
* United Kingdom: Replaced by Chieftain

<text>Claiborne is an unincorporated community in Talbot County, Maryland, United States. The village is located on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay near the mouth of the Eastern Bay at , and uses ZIP code 21624. The 2000 U.S. Census listed the population as 147 and the number of homes as 84, slightly down from its 1941 population of 156. Between 1890 and 1930, the village was a busy port for passenger and then automobile ferry service across the Chesapeake Bay, with numerous stores and motels/resorts, including Maple Hall and the Bellfonte Hotel. A post office was added in 1893 and the Protestant Episcopal Church of Claiborne was built in 1898. In 1912, an elementary school and Methodist Church were added. Before 1912, students attended school in nearby McDaniel. The town&#x27;s first school consisted of the kitchen of the local railroad pavilion, used as a classroom. In 1913, the town became home to the Claiborne Fresh Air Association, Inc., (“Miracle House”) which was formed for the purpose of providing 10 weeks of fresh air and summer vacation for children who had been exposed to tuberculosis. The role of Claiborne as a terminal for cross-Bay ferries was diminished in 1930 when the primary route shifted to Matapeake in Kent Island. It ended altogether in 1938 when the direct connection from Annapolis to Claiborne was terminated and only an auxiliary shuttle between Claiborne and Romancoke on Kent Island remained. This shuttle service ended in 1952, a few months after the opening of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge; thus ending all ferry service to Claiborne after more than six decades.

==History==
Prior to the 1870s, Claiborne was part of the nearby McDanieltown postal community (now McDaniel). Its name can be traced back in honor of William Claiborne, a fur trader who founded an English settlement on nearby Kent Island in 1631. Early land patents in Claiborne included &quot;Rich Neck Manor,&quot; which was first granted 2,000 acres to Capt. William Mitchel, Esq. in 1649 Subsequent owners of Rich Neck, Philip Land, built a chapel in the 1650s. The Rich Neck Manor Chapel still stands, but is private property. Rich Neck was also home to Matthew Tilghman, the head of the Maryland delegation to the Continental Congress, and Lloyd Tilghman, Confederate general.

It was past the entrance to today&#x27;s Claiborne harbor that British vessels passed during the War of 1812, landing in McDanieltown, within sight of Claiborne.

The area of town now known as &quot;Old Claiborne,&quot; was located on Tilghman&#x27;s Creek facing the Miles River. It included a steam sawmill started by John Hansel Tunis around 1867. &quot;Bingham&#x27;s Steamboat Wharf&quot; was created in 1867 to support a planned resort at &quot;Bingham&#x27;s Mineral Springs,&quot; with thrice-weekly service between Old Claiborne and Baltimore and other destinations up the Miles River to St. Michaels. By 1877, John Tunis&#x27; son, Joseph Tunis, had added the Claiborne Oyster Company, a boatyard, a few homes, two more steamboat wharves, and expanded his father&#x27;s sawmill into the Claiborne Saw and Planing Mills. At the foot of Rich Neck Road was a general store. Tunis also laid out grids for a new community of 188 lots and advertised them for between $18 and $40. A plat of it appears in an 1877 county atlas, showing eight main streets with the names: Rich Neck Road, Leeds, Ward, Progress, Monument, Tilghman, and Dom Pedro. At its center was Henry Clay Square, a large area reserved for public buildings. Joseph Tunis provided a slogan: “Young man don’t go West, but to Claiborne.” The village did not develop as Tunis had hoped and by 1893, Tunis had abandoned his plans. In later years several families from North Carolina who knew or where employed by the Tunis family in their North Carolina lumber mills relocated to &quot;Old Claiborne&quot;, for example Ben Perry whose home in &quot;Old Claiborne&quot; was built in 1905.

A second community, the &quot;new&quot; Claiborne, was started in 1886 when Gen. Joseph B. Seth and the Baltimore &amp; Eastern Shore Railroad Company agreed to begin ferry and railroad service between Claiborne and Bay Ridge, on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay. Seth along with Theophilus Tunis and Frank Turner envisioned a resort community similar to Bay Ridge and laid out plans for the &quot;new&quot; Claiborne, calling it &quot;Bay City”.

Although &quot;Bay City&quot; never developed as expected, Claiborne&#x27;s importance was raised once the ferries began operating with Claiborne as a primary terminus on the Eastern Shore. In 1890 the Baltimore &amp; Eastern Shore Railroad Company completed a railroad line from Claiborne to Easton so that passengers coming into Claiborne could continue through to Ocean City. Initially the plan was to use rail-transfer steamers to move rail cars between Bay Ridge and Claiborne but this was abandoned in late 1891 and a conventional passenger ferry service between Baltimore and Claiborne was substituted. This service failed to provide adequate cash flow to service the outstanding debt, and the Baltimore &amp; Eastern Shore Railroad was liquidated in August 1894. The assets were purchased by the newly created Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Railway.

Steamer service by the Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Railway continued until 1924 when BC&amp;A had shifted its traffic to Love Point. In 1927 the Baltimore, Chesapeake, &amp; Atlantic Railway filed for bankruptcy and was sold at foreclosure on March 28, 1928. One parcel was for the company&#x27;s railroad and the Claiborne ferry, and was sold for $650,000. At that point passenger rail service from Claiborne to points further east was discontinued, and the Claiborne-McDaniel section of the rail line was removed in 1938.

In 1916, the recently amended Panama Canal Act precluded the operation for ferry lines by railroad companies, with exceptions permitted only via approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The ICC ordered the Pennsylvania Railroad, parent of the Baltimore, Chesapeake &amp; Atlantic Railway, to terminate its Chesapeake ferry operations, with the exception of the Love Point and Claiborne routes since those were seen as extensions of the rail lines, rather than competitors. Local merchants on the Eastern Shore protested the order to close, World War I intervened, and the order was effectively dismissed in the early 1920s.

A second ferry company, the Eastern Shore Development Steamship Company, began service in 1912 between Claiborne and Annapolis starting with the steamer &quot;Atlantic&quot; and then switching over in December 1912 to the steam yacht &quot;Texas&quot;, formerly owned by Edward H. R. Green, the son of Wall Street investor Henrietta Green. That business, owned by New York investors A.J. McIntosh, B.A. Sinn and J.W.R. Crawford, failed in 1916. It had proven too difficult for the new ferry company to compete against the established railroad ferry, as the latter added capacity, shifted schedules and refused to wait for arriving ferries from the Eastern Shore Development Steamship Company, even as it would for its own ferries. The railroad also refused to sell joint tickets with the new ferry competitor and charges connecting rail passenger in Claiborne a premium compared to its own bundled rail-ferry tickets. The matter was submitted to the ICC for action and the two parties negotiated a partial solution before the ICC was forced to act.

In 1919, another competing ferry, Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry, Inc. (later the Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Company), began service between Claiborne and Annapolis. On Sunday evening it was not uncommon for traffic to be backed up several miles into Claiborne, waiting for the return ferry trip across the Chesapeake Bay. The increased automobile traffic to Claiborne forced the state to take the then unusual step of passing a special roads bill to improve the road between Claiborne and Easton, Maryland. In 1921, bus service was added from Claiborne to Easton, Hurlock, and Cambridge. In 1926 the service was enhanced with the introduction of the first &quot;double-ender&quot; ferry, the &quot;Gov. Albert C. Ritchie.&quot; At that point the ferry company began to earn strong profits.

In 1928 Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry, Inc. was restructured and renamed the Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Company. In 1930 the primary eastern terminal for cross-Bay ferries from Annapolis was moved from Claiborne to a new ferry terminal at Matapeake, on Kent Island. This significantly shortened the distances involved for most people leaving Annapolis. While direct service between Claiborne and Annapolis was continued after 1930, by the mid-1930s that service had been downgraded significantly.

In 1938 the ferry route to Claiborne was changed to run between Claiborne and Romancoke on Kent Island. This ended direct cross-Bay service to Claiborne. In 1943 the western terminal was moved from Annapolis to Sandy Point. Ferry service stopped running in December 1952, a few months after the Chesapeake Bay Bridge was built.

&quot;Claude W. Somers&quot; was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

==Connecting passenger train service east==
As late as 1924 the Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Railway was operating daily except Sunday passenger trains east from Claiborne to various points on the DelMarVa peninsula: Easton, Hurlock, Salisbury&#x27;s Union Station, Berlin and finally, Ocean City, Maryland. In 1924 the service was changed from a steam-powered locomotive to a gasoline-powered rail car. However, by 1928 that railroad company&#x27;s successor, Baltimore and Eastern Railroad had dropped passenger train service from Claiborne. Nonetheless, travelers at that time could get train connections in Easton: the B&amp;ER was still running Love Point - Easton - Ocean City trains. This service had ended by 1938.

<text>A Pure Michigan Byway is the designation for a segment of the State Trunkline Highway System in the US state of Michigan that is a &quot;scenic, recreational, or historic route that is representative of Michigan&#x27;s natural and cultural heritage.&quot; The designation was created with the name Michigan Heritage Route by the state legislature on June 22, 1993, and since then six historic, seven recreational and seven scenic byways have been designated by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), and another two have been proposed. These byways have been designated in both the Upper and Lower peninsulas (UP, LP) of the state. The current name was adopted on December 30, 2014, and it references the Pure Michigan tourism marketing campaign.

To be listed as a Pure Michigan Byway, a road must be a state trunkline highway, and it must be nominated through a two-stage process. Candidates are evaluated based on a set of objective criteria by MDOT in a process that can take several years to complete. The criteria include a highway&#x27;s relationship to sites or districts on the National Register of Historic Places, to recreational areas, or to scenic landscapes. Each candidate must be supported by local stakeholders, including the appropriate local units of government. Each byway has a local organization that produces a management plan for the roadway and the preservation of its surrounding environment.

==Program==
According to MDOT, the department&#x27;s Pure Michigan Byway Program works with local communities, organizations, and government agencies to identify roads that access Michigan&#x27;s &quot;unique recreational, scenic and historic cultural treasures&quot;. The program also attempts to preserve the unique and irreplaceable qualities of selected corridors, improve distinct roads in a careful and considerate way, and promote a greater awareness of and appreciation for the state&#x27;s scenic, recreational, historical and cultural resources, according to the Federal Highway Administration. These actions provide economic benefits by stimulating tourism. Staffers for State Representative Peter Pettalia of Presque Isle said that the point of the program, in context of the 2014 change to the Pure Michigan Byway name, was to get people to drive the selected roads and spend money at local businesses.

Additions to the system are made when local organizations apply to MDOT through a two-stage process. First, a local organization proposes the addition, verifying that the suggested byway is a state trunkline highway and noting which local governments support the designation. MDOT reviews this pre-application to determine initial eligibility. If the proposed byway is determined to be eligible, the organization is asked to submit a full application to the department for approval. The full process can take up to seven years to complete. The MDOT director compiles a report annually that is submitted to the governor, members of the Michigan Legislature and members of the State Transportation Commission; this report details any new additions in the previous year and any changes or deletions affecting the system.

==Types and requirements==
The three types of byways are defined in Public Act 69 of 1993, the legislation that originally established the system. The Legislature defined these types to be:

;Historic
:significant to the history, archeology, architecture, engineering, or culture of this state.
;Recreational
:facilities normally associated with leisure-time activities, including, but not limited to, parks, public access sites, wildlife refuges, forest areas, marinas, swimming areas, hiking trails, and sightseeing areas.
;Scenic
:an area of outstanding natural beauty whose features include, but are not limited to, significant natural features such as vegetation, land form, water, and open areas with exceptional vistas and views, that singly or in combination make that area unique and distinct in character.

In his annual report to the State Legislature at the end of 2014, MDOT Director Kirk Steudle described an additional three categories of byway not listed in the legislation setting up the system.

;Cultural
:A state highway traversing an area with unique cultural and/or ethnic heritage amenities such as art galleries, theaters, opera houses, restaurants, markets, and music venues.
;Archaeological
:A state highway traversing a corridor with ruins, artifacts, and structural remains.
;Natural
:A state highway that traverses a corridor with natural features that are relatively undisturbed, unique geological landforms, vegetation, water bodies, or conservation areas.
In establishing specific objective criteria related to the selection of potential byways, MDOT has set up limitations on these classifications. Regardless of classification, all byways are supported with a management plan for the corridor designed to deal with protection, preservation, and enhancement of the roadway. All routes are given specific termini points with a reasonable length. They must also have the backing of local units of government, landowners and organizations. No specific criteria have been published for cultural, archaeological or natural byways.

Historic byways are assessed based on the numbers of sites listed, or eligible for listing, on the National Register of Historic Places. These sites need to be visible from the route of the byway, or, in the case of historic districts, a &quot;substantial portion of the district must lie adjacent to the highway&quot;. Local organizations backing a proposed historic byway must also have promotional plans and demonstrate coordination with state agencies related to state history.

Recreational byways must be used mainly for recreational purposes, connecting to one or more recreation sites. They can also connect multiple sites together with a common theme, and they are assessed on their scenic qualities with lower inclusion standards than scenic byways.

Scenic byways must exclude commercial or industrial zones adjacent to the trunkline. These roads are also assessed on qualities such as the &quot;uniqueness&quot;, &quot;vividness&quot;, &quot;intactness&quot;, &quot;unity&quot;, and &quot;viewshed&quot; of the roadway and its surrounding environment as set up in department guidelines.

==History==

The Michigan Heritage Route System was created after Public Act 69 of 1993 was signed into law on June 22, 1993, going into effect immediately. The law required MDOT to set up specific criteria and procedures related to selecting and maintaining heritage routes, subject to approval of the Legislature. Since the program was put into operation in 1993, 16 heritage routes have been approved by the department. The first two were approved in 1995 at opposite ends of the state: a scenic route along US Highway 41 (US 41) in the Keweenaw Peninsula region of the northern UP and a historic route along M-125 in downtown Monroe in the southeastern corner of the LP. The first recreational route was approved in 1998 along M-15 in the southeastern LP. Since 2008, local groups have proposed the creation of a heritage route along the former West Michigan Pike (US 31) on the western side of the LP and a loop around Ontonagon County in the western UP. In a department report dated December 22, 2014, the UP byway was no longer under active proposal, and the West Michigan Pike was dedicated on July 25, 2016.

The Legislature proposed another change to the system in 2013 to rename the Heritage Routes in the system to Pure Michigan Byways under a bill introduced in the state House of Representatives. The bill passed in the House in March 2014, and the state Senate during the lame duck session in December 2014. Sponsors of the bill said that including the highways in the Pure Michigan tourism advertising campaign would provide promotional benefits, and they stated that the change &quot;allows the state to comply with federal changes, which require the word &#x27;route&#x27; be changed to &#x27;byway&#x27;.&quot; The bill received the governor&#x27;s signature and was filed on December 30, 2014, taking effect as Public Act 445 that day. MDOT had one year from that effective date to obtain a trademark license from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, owners of the Pure Michigan trademark, and to unveil the new signage bearing the updated program name. They unveiled the new signage as part of the dedication of the M-134 North Huron Byway in October 2015.

==List==
There are six historic, seven recreational and six scenic byways in Michigan, with one additional route proposed.

<doc id="490225" wikidata="Q5290058" url="?curid=490225" title="Chimaera">
<text>Chimaeras are cartilaginous fish in the order Chimaeriformes (), known informally as ghost sharks, rat fish (not to be confused with rattails), spookfish, or rabbit fish; the last two names are also applied to Opisthoproctidae and Siganidae, respectively.

At one time a &quot;diverse and abundant&quot; group (based on the fossil record), their closest living relatives are sharks and rays, though their last common ancestor with them lived nearly 400 million years ago. Living species (aside from plough-nose chimaeras) are largely confined to deep water.

==Anatomy==
Chimaeras are soft-bodied, shark-like fish with bulky heads and long, tapered tails; measured from the tail, they can grow up to in length. Like other members of the class Chondrichthyes, chimaera skeletons are entirely cartilaginous, or composed of cartilage. Males use forehead denticles to grasp a female by a fin during copulation. The gill arches are condensed into a pouch-like bundle covered by a sheet of skin (an operculum), with a single gill-opening in front of the pectoral fins.

The pectoral fins are large enough to generate lift at a relaxed forward momentum, giving the chimaera the appearance of &quot;flying&quot; through the water. Further back on the body are also a pair of smaller pelvic fins, and some genera bear an anal fin in front of the tail. In chimaerids and rhinochimaerids, the tail is leptocercal, meaning that it is thin and whip-like, edged from above and below by fins of similar size. In callorhinchids, the tail is instead heterocercal, with a larger upper lobe inclined upwards, similar to many sharks. There are two dorsal fins: a large triangular first dorsal fin and a low rectangular or depressed second dorsal fin. For defense, some chimaeras have a venomous spine on the front edge of the dorsal fin.

In many species, the bulbous snout is modified into an elongated sensory organ, capable of electroreception to find prey. The cartilaginous skull is holostylic, meaning that the palatoquadrate (upper jaw cartilage) is completely fused to the neurocranium (cranial cartilage). This contrasts with modern sharks, where the palatoquadrate is movable and detachable, a trait known as hyostyly. The back of the head is supported by a complex of fused vertebrae called the synarcual, which also connects to the dorsal fin spine.

Instead of sharks&#x27; many sharp, consistently-replaced teeth, chimaeras have just six large, permanent tooth-plates, which grow continuously throughout their entire life. These tooth-plates are arranged in three pairs, with one pair at the tip of the lower jaws and two pairs along the upper jaws. They together form a protruding, beak-like crushing and grinding mechanism, comparable to the incisor teeth of rodents and lagomorphs (hence the name &quot;rabbit fish&quot;). Chimaera teeth are unique among vertebrates, due to their mode of mineralization. Most of each plate is formed by relatively soft osteodentin, but the active edges are supplemented by a unique hypermineralized tissue called pleromin. Pleromin is an extremely hard enamel-like tissue, arranged into sheets or beaded rods, but it is deposited by mesenchyme-derived cells similar to those that form bone. In addition, pleromin&#x27;s hardness is due to the mineral whitlockite, which crystalizes within the teeth as the animal matures. Other vertebrates with hypermineralized teeth rely on enamel, which is derived from ameloblasts and encases round crystals of the mineral apatite.

Chimaeras also differ from sharks in that they have separate anal and urogenital openings.

== Behavior ==
Chimaeras live in temperate ocean floors, with some species inhabiting depths exceeding , with relatively few modern species regularly inhabiting shallow water. Exceptions include the members of the genus &quot;Callorhinchus&quot;, the rabbit fish and the spotted ratfish, which locally or periodically can be found at shallower depths. Consequently, these are also among the few species kept in public aquaria. They live in all the oceans except for the Arctic and Antarctic oceans.

=== Diet ===
The usual diet of chimaeras consist of crustaceans, and more specifically, they include ophiurans and molluscs. Modern species are demersal durophages, but they used to be more diverse. The Carboniferous period had forms that lived as specialised suction feeders in the water column.

=== Reproduction ===
Chimaera reproduction resembles that of sharks in some ways: males employ claspers for internal fertilization of females and females lay eggs within spindle-shaped, leathery egg cases.

Unlike sharks, male chimaeras have retractable sexual appendages (known as tentacula) to assist mating. The frontal tentaculum, a bulbous rod which extends out of the forehead, is used to clutch the females&#x27; pectoral fins during mating. The prepelvic tentacula are serrated hooked plates normally hidden in pouches in front of the pelvic fins, and they anchor the male to the female. Lastly, the pelvic claspers (sexual organs shared by sharks) are fused together by a cartilaginous sheathe before splitting into a pair of flattened lobes at their tip.

=== Parasites ===
As other fish, chimaeras have a number of parasites. &quot;Chimaericola leptogaster&quot; (Chimaericolidae) is a monogenean parasite of the gills of &quot;Chimaera monstrosa&quot;; the species can attain in length.

== Conservation and threats ==
Despite their secluded habits, some chimaera species may be threatened by overfishing through bycatch or commercial exploitation. No species are listed as Endangered according to the IUCN, but four are listed as Vulnerable, four more as Near Threatened, and many more as Data Deficient (too rare to evaluate). Many species have restricted ranges and practically none have had their movement patterns studied. In addition, bycatch reports are usually insufficiently precise to the species or even genus level, so it is difficult to keep track of bycatch on a species-by-species basis. This lack of data renders chimaera species especially susceptible to overlooked population declines.

Several near-shore species are purposefully caught for their meat, especially callorhinchids, &quot;Hydrolagus bemisi&quot; (pale ghost shark), and &quot;Hydrolagus novaezealandi&quot;ae (dark ghost shark). Modern quotas have helped to moderate collection of these species to a sustainable level, though &quot;Callorhinchus milii&quot; (the Australian ghostshark) experienced severe overfishing in the 20th century before protections were enacted. &quot;Neoharriotta pinnata&quot; (sicklefin chimaera) is targeted along the coast of India for its liver oil, and a recent decline of catch rates may indicate a population crash. Even species without commercial exploitation can fall victim to bycatch: &quot;Callorhinchus callorynchus&quot; (American elephantfish), &quot;Neoharriotta carri&quot; (dwarf sicklefin chimaera), &quot;Chimaera monstrosa&quot; (rabbit fish), &quot;Chimaera ogilbyi&quot; (Ogilby&#x27;s ghostshark), &quot;Hydrolagus colliei&quot; (spotted ratfish), and &quot;Hydrolagus melanophasma&quot; (eastern Pacific black ghostshark) all have bycatch rates exceeding 10% in certain parts of their range, and some are experiencing steep declines. Chimaeras have mostly avoided harvesting for the fin trade, which threatens many true sharks.

Another threat is habitat destruction of coastal nurseries (by urban development) or deepwater reefs (by deep sea mining and trawling). Near-shore species such as &quot;Callorhinchus milii&quot; are vulnerable to the effects of climate change: stronger storms and warmer seawater are predicted to increase egg mortality by disrupting the stable environments necessary to complete incubation.

==Classification==

In some classifications, the chimaeras are included (as subclass Holocephali) in the class Chondrichthyes of cartilaginous fishes; in other systems, this distinction may be raised to the level of class. Chimaeras also have some characteristics of bony fishes.

A renewed effort to explore deep water and to undertake taxonomic analysis of specimens in museum collections led to a boom during the first decade of the 21st century in the number of new species identified. A preliminary study found 8% of species to be threatened. There are over 50 extant species in six genera and three families, with other genera known from fossils. The extant species fall into three families—the Callorhinchidae, Rhinochimaeridae and Chimaeridae with the callorhinchids being the most basal clade.

Suborder Chimaeroidei 
*Family Callorhinchidae 
** Genus &quot;Callorhinchus&quot; (3 extant species) Mid-Cretaceous–recent
* Family Chimaeridae 
** Genus &quot;Chimaera&quot; (16 species) Eocene–recent
** Genus &quot;Hydrolagus&quot; (26 species) Miocene–recent
* Family Rhinochimaeridae 
** Genus &quot;Harriotta&quot; (2 species)
** Genus &quot;Neoharriotta&quot; (3 species)
** Genus &quot;Rhinochimaera&quot; (3 species)

== Evolution ==
Tracing the evolution of these species has been problematic given the paucity of good fossils. DNA sequencing has become the preferred approach to understanding speciation.

The group containing chimaeras and their close relatives (Holocephali) is thought to have diverged from Elasmobranchii (the group containing modern sharks and rays) during the Devonian, over 380 million years ago. The oldest known chimaeriform is &quot;Protochimaera&quot; from the Early Carboniferous (338–332 million years ago) of Russia, which is more closely related to modern chimeras (Chimaeroidei) than any other known extinct groups of Chimaeriformes. The earliest known remains attributable to modern chimaeras are known from the Early Jurassic (Pliensbachian) of Europe, but egg cases from the Late Triassic of Yakutia, Russia and New Zealand that resemble those of rhinochimaerids and callorhinchids respectively indicates that they had a global distribution prior to the end of the Triassic. Unlike modern chimaeras, Mesozoic representatives are often found in shallow water settings. Most modern chimaera groups appear to have originated during the Mesozoic Marine Revolution. Modern chimaeras reached their highest ecological diversity during the mid-Cretaceous (Albian to Cenomanian), when they acquired a variety of different dentition types.

It has commonly been assumed that due to being an evolutionarily basal group that is largely found in the deep ocean, modern chimaeras likely colonized the deep ocean during the Mesozoic and used it as a refugium to survive mass extinction events. However, more recent studies indicate that chimaeras were likely a shallow-water group for most of their existence, and only colonized the deep ocean in the aftermath of the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. The plough-nosed chimaeras are the only group to still inhabit shallower waters, in the manner of ancestral chimaera groups.

<text>Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic is the fifth studio album by the English progressive rock group King Crimson, released on 23 March 1973 through Island Records in the UK and Atlantic Records in the United States and Canada. This album is the debut of King Crimson&#x27;s third incarnation, featuring co-founder and guitarist Robert Fripp along with four new members: bass guitarist and vocalist John Wetton, violinist and keyboardist David Cross, percussionist Jamie Muir, and drummer Bill Bruford. It is a key album in the band&#x27;s evolution, drawing on Eastern European modernist classical music and European free improvisation as central influences.

==Background==
At the end of the tour to promote King Crimson&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Islands&quot;, Fripp had parted company with the three other members of the band (Mel Collins, Boz Burrell and Ian Wallace). Collins has stated that he was asked to stay on with the new lineup of the band but decided not to. The previous year had also seen the ousting of the band&#x27;s lyricist and artistic co-director Peter Sinfield. Fripp had cited a developing musical and sometimes personal incompatibility with the other members; he was now writing starker music drawing on influences such as Béla Bartók, Igor Stravinsky, Jimi Hendrix and free improvisation.

In order to pursue these ideas, Fripp first recruited bass guitarist and vocalist John Wetton, a longstanding friend of the band who had lobbied to join at least once before but had joined Family in the meantime. The second recruit was Jamie Muir, a free-improvising percussionist who had previously been performing in the Music Improvisation Company with Derek Bailey and Evan Parker, as well as in Sunship (with Alan Gowen and Allan Holdsworth) and Boris (with Don Weller and Jimmy Roche, both later of jazz-rock band Major Surgery). Muir occasionally played a conventional drum kit, but more often used a range of small percussion instruments. 

On drums Fripp recruited Bill Bruford of Yes. Another longstanding King Crimson admirer, Bruford felt that he had done all he could with Yes at that point. He was keen to leave the band before they embarked on their &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; tour, believing that the experimentation-oriented King Crimson would be a more expansive outlet for his musical ideas. The final member of the new band was David Cross, a violinist, keyboardist and occasional flute player.

==Production==
&quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot; showed several significant changes in King Crimson&#x27;s sound. Having previously relied on woodwinds as significant melodic and textural instruments, the band now replaced them with Cross&#x27; violin. Muir&#x27;s percussion rig featured eccentric instrumentation including chimes, bells, thumb pianos, a musical saw, shakers, rattles, found objects (such as sheet metal, toys and baking trays), and miscellaneous drums and chains. The Mellotron, a staple part of King Crimson&#x27;s instrumentation since their debut album, was retained for this new phase, played by Fripp and Cross, both of whom also played electric piano. The instrumental pieces carried strong jazz fusion and European free-improvisation influences, and some aggressive portions verging on heavy metal.

The band&#x27;s multi-instrumentalism initially extended to Wetton and Muir playing (respectively) violin and trombone on occasion at early gigs. Wetton and Cross contributed additional piano and flute respectively to the album sessions. As Muir left the group in February 1973, shortly after the album was completed and before they could embark on a supporting tour, &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot; would be the group&#x27;s only album to feature this lineup.

&quot;Easy Money&quot; was composed piecemeal, with Fripp writing the verses and Wetton later adding the chorus.

The name of the album came from Muir, who thought that the title aptly described the music. &quot;It may or may not be an actual dish available at your neighborhood delicatessen,&quot; Fripp stated. &quot;But what it means to me is something precious which is stuck, but visible. Something precious, which is encased in form.&quot;

The album spawned the concert staple &quot;Exiles&quot;, whose Mellotron introduction had been adapted from an instrumental piece called &quot;Mantra&quot; which the band&#x27;s original lineup had performed throughout 1969. At that time, as well as in late 1972, the melody was played by Fripp on guitar. In addition, a section of &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic, Part One&quot; was reworked from a piece entitled &quot;A Peacemaking Stint Unrolls&quot;, which was recorded by the &quot;Islands&quot;-era band and finally released in 2010 as a bonus track on that album&#x27;s 40th anniversary edition.

==Release and reissues==
The album peaked at number 20 on the UK charts and at number 61 in the U.S. In 2012 &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot; was issued as part of the King Crimson 40th Anniversary Series, including the release of an expansive box set subtitled &quot;The Complete Recordings&quot;. This CD, DVD-A and Blu-ray set includes every available recording of the short-lived 5-man line-up, through live performances and studio sessions.

==Reception and legacy==
In his contemporary review, Alan Niester of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; summarized the album: &quot;You can&#x27;t dance to it, can&#x27;t keep a beat to it, and it doesn&#x27;t even make good background music for washing the dishes,&quot; recommending listeners to &quot;approach it with a completely open mind.&quot; He described the songs on the album as &quot;a total study in contrasts, especially in moods and tempos – blazing and electric one moment, soft and intricate the next.&quot; While not fully appreciative of the music on the record, he complimented the violin playing as &quot;tasteful [...] in the best classical tradition.&quot;

Bill Martin wrote in 1998, &quot;[f]or sheer formal inventiveness, the most important progressive rock record of 1973 was... &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot;&quot;, adding that listening to this album and Yes&#x27;s &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; would demonstrate &quot;what progressive rock is all about&quot;.

AllMusic&#x27;s retrospective review was resoundingly positive, marking every aspect of the band&#x27;s transition from a jazz-influenced vein to a more experimental one as a complete success. It deemed John Wetton &quot;the group&#x27;s strongest singer/bassist since Greg Lake&#x27;s departure,&quot; and gave special praise to the remastered edition.

Robert Christgau&#x27;s retrospective review gave a more ambivalent view, saying of the band&#x27;s instrumental work, &quot;not only doesn&#x27;t it cook, which figures, it doesn&#x27;t quite jell either.&quot;

In the Q &amp; Mojo Classic Special Edition &quot;Pink Floyd &amp; The Story of Prog Rock&quot;, the album came number 22 in its list of &quot;40 Cosmic Rock Albums&quot;.

&quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot; comes in at #20 in &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; &quot;50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time&quot; list.

The album is featured in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

The progressive metal bands Dream Theater and Murmur both covered &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic Pt. II&quot;. Dream Theater&#x27;s version is featured on the special edition of their album &quot;Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings&quot;.

<doc id="490244" wikidata="Q633452" url="?curid=490244" title="Cnidoscolus stimulosus">
<text>Cnidoscolus stimulosus, the bull nettle, spurge nettle, stinging nettle, tread-softly or finger rot, is a perennial herb covered with stinging hairs, native to southeastern North America. A member of the family Euphorbiaceae (spurge family), it is not a true nettle. It prefers sandy, well-drained soil and mostly exists in pine/blackjack oak forests on sandhills, rims of Carolina bays, dunes, dry pastures, fields and roadsides.

==Description==
The green leaves of this plant are alternate, consisting of three to five untoothed lobes. The large, white flowers have five petals. Male and female flowers are on different plants. Flowers occur throughout the spring and summer followed by a small capsule that produces three large seeds. The entire plant above ground, including the flower petals, is covered with stinging hairs. The tap root can be used as an excellent potato substitute, tasting like pasta.

As the common names imply, the urticating hairs on this plant contain a caustic irritant that inflicts a painful sting to those who contact it with bare skin. It can cause a painful, irritating rash and can cause more serious reactions with some people.

==Etymology and names==
The species name &quot;stimulosus&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;stimulus&quot;, meaning &quot;goad&quot; or &quot;prod&quot;. This plant is also known as bull nettle and &quot;mala mujer&quot; (Spanish for &quot;bad woman&quot; or witch), though the latter name is applied to several other plants with similar properties.

<doc id="490256" wikidata="Q233628" url="?curid=490256" title="Elizabeth Monroe">
<text>Elizabeth Monroe (&quot;née&quot; Kortright; June 30, 1768 – September 23, 1830) was the first lady of the United States from 1817 to 1825, as the wife of James Monroe, fifth president of the United States. Due to the fragile condition of Monroe&#x27;s health, many of her duties as the official White House hostess were assumed by her eldest daughter, Eliza Monroe Hay.

==Birth, parents, and childhood (1768–1778(86))==
Monroe was born in New York City on June 30, 1768, the youngest daughter of Lawrence Kortright, a wealthy merchant, and Hannah (&quot;née&quot; Aspinwall) Kortright. Elizabeth Monroe&#x27;s paternal second great grandfather, Cornelius Jansen Kortright, was born in Holland, Netherlands, in 1645, and immigrated to New York in the year of 1663. His father, Jan Bastiaenson Van Kortrijk, was also born in Holland, Netherlands in 1618 and immigrated with his son to New York. Jan Bastiaenson&#x27;s father, Bastiaen Van Kortrijk, was born in the city of Kortrijk in Flanders, Spanish Netherlands, in 1586, and immigrated to Holland, Netherlands, in 1615. Monroe&#x27;s father was one of the founders of the New York Chamber of Commerce. During the American Revolutionary War, he was part owner of several privateers fitted out at New York, and it has also been documented that he enslaved at least four Black people. He purchased land tracts in what is now Delaware County, New York, and from the sale of this land the town of Kortright, New York, was formed.

Monroe grew up in a household with four older siblings: Sarah, Hester, John and Mary. According to the parish records of Trinity Church, New York, Monroe&#x27;s mother, Hannah, died on September 6 or 7, 1777, at the age of 39. The cause of death was recorded as resulting from Child Bed. An unidentified sibling of Monroe&#x27;s, aged 13 months, succumbed to flux and fever a few days later. Hannah and the infant were both buried at St. George&#x27;s Chapel in New York. At the time of their deaths, Monroe was nine years old. Her father never remarried.

On August 3, 1778, almost a year after the death of Monroe&#x27;s mother, the home of the Lawrence Kortright family was nearly destroyed by fire during a blaze which caused damage and destruction to fifty homes near Cruger&#x27;s Wharf in lower Manhattan. A historian later wrote that this blaze was due to the mismanagement of British troops while directing the firefighters. Monroe, age 10, with her father and siblings, survived the fire unscathed.

==Courtship and marriage (1785–1786)==
Kortright first caught the attention of James Monroe in 1785 while he was in New York City serving as a member of the Continental Congress. William Grayson, James Monroe&#x27;s cousin and fellow Congressman from Virginia, described Elizabeth and her sisters as having &quot;made so brilliant and lovely an appearance&quot; at a theater one evening, &quot;as to depopulate all the other boxes of all the genteel male people therein.&quot; 

James Monroe, then 27 years old, married Elizabeth, then 17 years old, on February 16, 1786, at her father&#x27;s home in New York City. The marriage was performed by Reverend Benjamin Moore, and recorded in the parish records of Trinity Church, New York. After a brief honeymoon on Long Island, the newlyweds returned to New York City to live with her father until Congress adjourned. Their first child, whom they named Eliza Kortright Monroe, was born in December, 1786, in Virginia.

==Ambassador&#x27;s wife (1794–1796)==
In 1794, George Washington appointed James as United States Minister to France. In Paris, as wife of the American Minister during the Reign of Terror, she helped secure the release of Madame La Fayette, wife of the Marquis de Lafayette, when she learned she was imprisoned and scheduled to be executed by guillotine. The Monroes also provided support and shelter to the American citizen Thomas Paine in Paris, after he was arrested for his opposition to the execution of Louis XVI. While in France, the Monroes&#x27; daughter Eliza became a friend of Hortense de Beauharnais, step-daughter of Napoleon, and both girls received their education in the school of Madame Jeanne Campan. James was recalled from his Ambassadorship in 1796, due in part to his support of France in the opposition of the Jay Treaty.

==Governor&#x27;s wife (1799–1802)==
The Monroes returned to Virginia, where James became governor, and Elizabeth became First Lady of Virginia. The couple&#x27;s son, James Spence, was born in 1799 but died in 1800. During this time, Elizabeth suffered the first of a series of seizures and collapses that were possibly a product of epilepsy, which plagued her for the rest of her life and gradually caused her to restrict her social activities. The Monroe&#x27;s third child, a daughter they named Maria Hester, was born in Virginia in early 1802.

==Great Britain (1803–1804)==
In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson appointed James as United States Minister to Great Britain and Spain. Elizabeth found the social climate in London less favorable than it had been in Paris, possibly because British society resented the United States&#x27; refusal to aid it in its conflict with France. In 1804, James was sent as a special envoy to France to negotiate the Louisiana Purchase. That same year, the Monroes were invited by Napoleon Bonaparte to attend his coronation in Paris, as part of the official American delegation.

==Return to Virginia and Washington (1807–1817)==
The Monroes returned to Virginia in 1807. James Monroe won election and returned to the Virginia House of Delegates, and also resumed his legal career. In 1811, Monroe won election to another term as governor of Virginia, but served only four months. In April 1811, his friend President James Madison appointed Monroe Secretary of State, and he was confirmed to the position by the United States Senate. Monroe had little to do with the War of 1812, since President Madison and the war hawks in Congress were dominant. During the War, Elizabeth stayed primarily at the Monroe family estates at Oak Hill in Loudoun County, Virginia, and later at Ashlawn-Highland in Albemarle County, Virginia.

The war went very badly, so Madison turned to Monroe for help, appointing him United States Secretary of War in September 1814 after the Burning of Washington by the British, who the national capital and burned the White House. Monroe resigned as Secretary of State on October 1 but no successor was ever appointed, so he handled both offices from October 1, 1814 to February 28, 1815. As Secretary of War, Monroe formulated plans to invade Canada a second time to win the War of 1812, but a peace treaty was ratified in February 1815, before any U.S. military forced moved north. Monroe then resigned as Secretary of War and was formally re-appointed Secretary of State, where he served until March 4, 1817, when he succeeded James Madison to become the nation&#x27;s fifth President of the United States.

==First Lady of the United States (1817–1825)==
Elizabeth began her tenure as First Lady on March 4, 1817, when her husband commenced his first term as the fifth president of the United States. Upon moving into the White House, the Monroes relocated several of the dozens of Black people they enslaved in order to continue their forced labor. However, the White House was still under reconstruction, so Elizabeth hosted the inaugural ball at their private residence on I Street, and part of the time the First Family lived in the Octagon House. Since all the White House furnishings had been destroyed, the Monroes brought some from their private residences. Her husband was re-elected to a second term in office in 1820, and Elizabeth attended the inaugural ball held in Brown&#x27;s Hotel. She remained in her role of First Lady until March 4, 1825.

Although Elizabeth Monroe regained a measure of respect and admiration during her husband&#x27;s second term, she compared poorly to her predecessor, Dolley Madison, who had captivated Washington society, setting a standard by which future First Ladies were measured. Furthermore, Elizabeth and her eldest daughter may have sought to make access to the White House more socially exclusive, reflecting French practices, which were barely tolerated given American democratic values, although President Monroe&#x27;s term was also known for good feelings and relations. Still, Elizabeth had made such an impression upon General Andrew Jackson that her husband always mentioned her to him in their correspondence. Elizabeth also drew favorable reviews as the couple briefly hosted General Lafayette during his return tour through America. During Elizabeth&#x27;s illnesses, some of the social duties were carried out by her daughters, as discussed below. Furthermore, James or Elizabeth destroyed her correspondence, both between themselves and with others, before her death.

Since 1982 Siena College Research Institute has periodically conducted surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. Consistently, Monroe has been ranked in the lower-half of first ladies by historians in these surveys. In terms of cumulative assessment, Monroe has been ranked:
*24th-best of 42 in 1982
*23rd-best of 37 in 1993
*31st-best of 38 in 2003
*29th-best of 38 in 2008
*30th-best of 38 in 2014

In the 2014 survey, Monroe and her husband were also ranked the 15th-highest out of 39 first couples in terms of being a &quot;power couple&quot;.

==Children (1786–1802)==
James and Elizabeth had three children:
* Elizabeth (&quot;Eliza&quot;) Kortright Monroe Hay (1786–January 27, 1840): Born in Virginia in December, 1786, Eliza was educated at the school of Madame Jeanne Campan in Paris, when her father served as United States Ambassador to France. Eliza appeared to many a haughty, pompous socialite, quick to remind others of her good breeding and lofty station. In late September or early October 1808 she married George Hay, a prominent Virginia attorney who had served as prosecutor in the trial of Aaron Burr and later U.S. District Judge. Their daughter, Hortense, was named in honor of her childhood friend and classmate, Hortense de Beauharnais, step-daughter of Napoleon. During her father&#x27;s presidency, Eliza alienated most of Washington society for her refusal to call on wives of the diplomatic corps, as was the custom, and caused another social furor in closing her sister&#x27;s wedding to all but family and friends. For all her apparent vanity, however, she demonstrated genuine compassion during the fever epidemic that swept Washington during her father&#x27;s Presidency. She spent many sleepless nights selflessly caring for victims. Following the deaths of her husband and father, Eliza moved to Paris, France, where she died on January 27, 1840. 
*James Spence Monroe (1799–1800): The only son of the Monroes, James Spence was 16 months old when he died after &quot;several days sickness&quot;.
*Maria Hester Monroe Gouverneur (1802–June 20, 1850) In an April 12, 1802 letter to James Madison, James Monroe states that his wife recently added a daughter to their family. Parish records indicate that Maria was born on April 8. The following year, while still an infant, Maria accompanied her parents to London, when James Monroe became Ambassador from the United States to the Court of St. James. Upon the family&#x27;s return to the United States, Maria finished school in Philadelphia. On March 9, 1820, she married her first cousin, Samuel L. Gouverneur, in the first wedding of a president&#x27;s child at the White House. Many in Washington criticized the Monroes for keeping the wedding private; just 42 members of the family and close friends were invited. Friction between Maria&#x27;s husband and her outspoken sister strained family relations thereafter. The Gouverneurs moved to New York City. Former President Monroe, upon losing his wife in 1830, moved in with them. President John Quincy Adams appointed her husband postmaster of New York City. Maria died on June 20, 1850, at the age of 48, at Oak Hill, in Loudon County, Virginia. 

==Death and legacy (1825–1830)==
After Monroe&#x27;s terms as president expired, he and Elizabeth faced considerable debts from their years of public service, both from non-reimbursed entertaining expenses and because Monroe was forced to manage their various properties remotely. Monroe sold his plantation, Highland in Albemarle County to pay debts, and both retired to Oak Hill in Loudoun County, nearer Washington, D.C., and their daughter Eliza and her husband (although the Hays moved to Richmond in 1825 when he became the U.S. District Judge for Virginia). Although retiring, Elizabeth managed to travel to New York to visit her younger daughter, as well as other friends and relations, but made no further social visits. Sickly and suffering several long illnesses (including severe burns from a collapse near a fireplace a year after leaving the White House), Elizabeth died at Oak Hill on September 23, 1830, aged 62, her husband following her less than a year later, aged 73.

She was interred at the estate, but her husband later died in New York under their daughter&#x27;s care and was originally buried in that northern state. His remains were moved 25 years after his death to become a key attraction during the development of Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia. Elizabeth&#x27;s remains were reinterred there in 1903, where both spouses remain buried.

The First Spouse Program under the Presidential $1 Coin Act authorizes the United States Mint to issue 1/2 ounce $10 gold coins and bronze medal duplicates to honor the first spouses of the United States. Elizabeth Monroe&#x27;s coin was released in February 2008.

A gown in the collection of the James Monroe Museum indicates Elizabeth was a petite woman, not taller than 5 feet.

<doc id="490258" wikidata="Q551840" url="?curid=490258" title="Split-brain">
<text>Split-brain or callosal syndrome is a type of disconnection syndrome when the corpus callosum connecting the two hemispheres of the brain is severed to some degree. It is an association of symptoms produced by disruption of, or interference with, the connection between the hemispheres of the brain. The surgical operation to produce this condition (corpus callosotomy) involves transection of the corpus callosum, and is usually a last resort to treat refractory epilepsy. Initially, partial callosotomies are performed; if this operation does not succeed, a complete callosotomy is performed to mitigate the risk of accidental physical injury by reducing the severity and violence of epileptic seizures. Before using callosotomies, epilepsy is instead treated through pharmaceutical means. After surgery, neuropsychological assessments are often performed.

After the right and left brain are separated, each hemisphere will have its own separate perception, concepts, and impulses to act. Having two &quot;brains&quot; in one body can create some interesting dilemmas. There was a case in which, when one split-brain patient would dress himself, sometimes he pulled his pants up with one hand (the side of his brain that wanted to get dressed) and down with the other (the side that did not). He was also reported to have grabbed his wife with his left hand and shook her violently, at which point his right hand came to her aid and grabbed the aggressive left hand (a phenomenon sometimes occurring, known as alien hand syndrome). However, such conflicts are very rare. If a conflict arises, one hemisphere usually overrides the other.

When split-brain patients are shown an image only in the left half of each eye&#x27;s visual field, they cannot verbally name what they have seen. This is because the brain&#x27;s experiences of the senses is contralateral. Communication between the two hemispheres is inhibited, so the patient cannot say out loud the name of that which the right side of the brain is seeing. A similar effect occurs if a split-brain patient touches an object with only the left hand while receiving no visual cues in the right visual field; the patient will be unable to name the object, as each cerebral hemisphere of the primary somatosensory cortex only contains a tactile representation of the opposite side of the body. If the speech-control center is on the right side of the brain, the same effect can be achieved by presenting the image or object to only the right visual field or hand.

The same effect occurs for visual pairs and reasoning. For example, a patient with split brain is shown a picture of a chicken foot and a snowy field in separate visual fields and asked to choose from a list of words the best association with the pictures. The patient would choose a chicken to associate with the chicken foot and a shovel to associate with the snow; however, when asked to reason why the patient chose the shovel, the response would relate to the chicken (e.g. &quot;the shovel is for cleaning out the chicken coop&quot;).

== History ==

Early anatomists, such as Galen (129) and Vesalius (1514–1564 CE), identified the corpus callosum. They generally described its function as a structure holding together the two halves of the brain. In 1784, Félix Vicq-d&#x27;Azyr described the corpus callosum as allowing communication between the two halves of the brain. He proposed that eliminating the corpus callosum would divide the brain into two independent parts. In 1892, Joseph Jules Dejerine reported symptoms in a person who had destruction of part of the corpus callosum (along with damage to the visual cortex: inability to read while retaining the ability to write, now referred to as pure alexia or as &quot;Dejerine syndrome&quot;. In 1908, Hugo Liepmann observed left-sided apraxia (a motor disorder of motor planning to perform tasks or movements) and agraphia (loss of the ability to communicate through writing) following a lesion in the corpus callosum.

According to Vaddiparti et al. (2021), the first surgical cuts to the corpus callosum, partial corpus callosotomy, were made by neurosurgeon Walter Dandy in order to access and to remove tumors in the pineal gland. In 1936, Dandy described three cases in which he cut the corpus callosum from its posterior (towards the back of the head) across about two thirds of its width. He described these cuts as &quot;bloodless&quot; and that &quot;no symptoms follow[ed] [the] ... division&quot; of the corpus callosum. He concluded that his operations &quot;dispose ... of the extravagant claims to function of the corpus callosum&quot;.

Prior to the 1960s, research on people with certain brain injuries led to the notion that there is a &quot;language center&quot; only in the left hemisphere of the brain. For example, people with lesions in two specific areas of the left hemisphere lost their ability to talk, to read, and to understand speech. Roger Sperry and his colleagues pioneered research showing that creating another lesion (done to relieve otherwise untreatable epilepsy), in the connections between the left and right hemispheres, revealed that the right hemisphere can allow people to read, to understand speech, and to say some simple words. Research over the next twenty years showed that the disconnected right hemisphere is superior to the disconnected left hemisphere in allowing people to understand spatial information (such as maps), music, and emotions, whereas the disconnected left hemisphere is superior in allowing analytical thinking, talking, reading, and understanding speech. This research led to a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for Sperry in 1981.

Sperry&#x27;s initial colleagues included his Caltech PhD students, Michael Gazzaniga and Jerre Levy. Even though Sperry is considered the founder of split-brain research, Gazzaniga&#x27;s clear summaries of their collaborative work are consistently cited in psychology texts. In Sperry and Gazzaniga&#x27;s &quot;The Split Brain in Man&quot; experiment published in &quot;Scientific American&quot; in 1967 they attempted to explore the extent to which two halves of the human brain were able to function independently and whether or not they had separate and unique abilities. They wanted to examine how perceptual and intellectual skills were affected in someone with a split brain. At Caltech, Gazzaniga worked with Sperry on the effects of split-brain surgery on perception, vision and other brain functions. The surgery, which was a treatment for severe epilepsy, involved severing the corpus callosum, which carries signals between the left-brain hemisphere, the seat of speech and analytical capacity, and the right-brain hemisphere, which helps recognize visual patterns. At the time this article was written, only ten patients had undergone the surgery to sever their corpus callosum (corpus callosotomy). Four of these patients had consented to participate in Sperry and Gazzaniga&#x27;s research. After the corpus callosum severing, all four participants&#x27; personality, intelligence, and emotions appeared to be unaffected. However, the testing done by Sperry and Gazzaniga showed the subjects demonstrated unusual mental abilities. The researchers created different types of tests to analyze the range of cognitive capabilities of the split-brain subjects. These included tests of their visual stimulation abilities, a tactile stimulation situation, and a test that involved both visual and tactile information.

=== Visual test ===

The first test started with a board that had a horizontal row of lights. The subject was told to sit in front of the board and stare at a point in the middle of the lights, then the bulbs would flash across both the right and left visual fields. When the patients were asked to describe afterward what they saw, they said that only the lights on the right side of the board had lit up. Next, when Sperry and Gazzaniga flashed the lights on the right side of the board on the subjects left side of their visual field, they claimed not to have seen any lights at all. When the experimenters conducted the test again, they asked the subjects to point to the lights that lit up. Although subjects had only reported seeing the lights flash on the right, they actually pointed to all the lights in both visual fields. This showed that both brain hemispheres had seen the lights and were equally competent in visual perception. The subjects did not say they saw the lights when they flashed in the left visual field even though they did see them because the center for speech is located in the brain&#x27;s left hemisphere. This test supports the idea that in order to say one has seen something, the region of the brain associated with speech must be able to communicate with areas of the brain that process the visual information.

=== Tactile test ===

In a second experiment, Sperry and Gazzaniga placed a small object in the subject&#x27;s right or left hand, without the subject being able to see (or hear) it. When the object was placed in the right hand, the isolated left hemisphere perceived the object and could easily describe and name it. However, when the object was placed in the left hand, the isolated right hemisphere could not name or describe the object. Questioning this result, the researchers found that the subjects &quot;could&quot; later match it from several similar objects; tactile sensations limited to the right hemisphere were accurately perceived but could not be verbalized. This further demonstrated the apparent location (or lateralization) of language functions in the left hemisphere.

=== Combination of both tests ===

In the last test the experimenters combined both the tactile and visual test. They presented subjects with a picture of an object to only their right hemisphere, and subjects were unable to name it or describe it. There were no verbal responses to the picture at all. If the subject however was able to reach under the screen with their left hand to touch various objects, they were able to pick the one that had been shown in the picture. The subjects were also reported to be able to pick out objects that were related to the picture presented, if that object was not under the screen.

Sperry and Gazzaniga went on to conduct other tests to shed light on the language processing abilities of the right hemisphere as well as auditory and emotional reactions as well. The significance of the findings of these tests by Sperry and Gazzaniga was extremely telling and important to the psychology world. Their findings showed that the two halves of the brain have numerous functions and specialized skills. They concluded that each hemisphere really has its own functions. One&#x27;s left hemisphere of the brain is thought to be better at writing, speaking, mathematical calculation, reading, and is the primary area for language. The right hemisphere is seen to possess capabilities for problem solving, recognizing faces, symbolic reasoning, art, and spatial relationships.

Roger Sperry continued this line of research up until his death in 1994. Michael Gazzaniga continues to research the split brain. Their findings have been rarely critiqued and disputed; however, a popular belief that some people are more &quot;right-brained&quot; or &quot;left-brained&quot; has developed. In the mid-1980s Jarre Levy, a psychobiologist at the University of Chicago, was at the forefront of scientists who wanted to dispel the notion we have two functioning brains. She believes that because each hemisphere has separate functions that they must integrate their abilities instead of separating them. Levy also claims that no human activity uses only one side of the brain. In 1998 a French study by Hommet and Billiard was published that questioned Sperry and Gazzaniga&#x27;s study that severing the corpus callosum actually divides the hemispheres of the brain. They found that children born without a corpus callosum demonstrated that information was being transmitted between hemispheres, and concluded that subcortical connections must be present in these children with this rare brain malformation. They are unclear about whether these connections are present in split-brain patients though. Another study by Parsons, Gabrieli, Phelps, and Gazzaniga in 1998 demonstrated that split-brain patients may commonly perceive the world differently from the rest of us. Their study suggested that communication between brain hemispheres is necessary for imaging or simulating in one&#x27;s mind the movements of others. Morin&#x27;s research on inner speech in 2001 suggested an alternative for interpretation of commissurotomy according to which split-brain patients exhibit two uneven streams of self-awareness: a &quot;complete&quot; one in the left hemisphere and a &quot;primitive&quot; one in the right hemisphere.

== Hemispheric specialization ==

The two hemispheres of the cerebral cortex are linked by the corpus callosum, through which they communicate and coordinate actions and decisions. Communication and coordination between the two hemispheres is essential because each hemisphere has some separate functions. The right hemisphere of the cortex excels at nonverbal and spatial tasks, whereas the left hemisphere is more dominant in verbal tasks, such as speaking and writing. The right hemisphere controls the primary sensory functions of the left side of the body. In a cognitive sense the right hemisphere is responsible for recognizing objects and timing, and in an emotional sense it is responsible for empathy, humor and depression. On the other hand, the left hemisphere controls the primary sensory functions of the right side of the body and is responsible for scientific and math skills, and logic. The extent of specialized brain function by an area remains under investigation. It is claimed that the difference between the two hemispheres is that the left hemisphere is &quot;analytic&quot; or &quot;logical&quot; while the right hemisphere is &quot;holistic&quot; or &quot;intuitive&quot;. Many simple tasks, especially comprehension of inputs, require functions that are specific to both the right and left hemispheres and together form a one-direction systematized way of creating an output through the communication and coordination that occurs between hemispheres.

=== Role of the corpus callosum ===

The corpus callosum is a structure in the brain along the longitudinal fissure that facilitates much of the communication between the two hemispheres. This structure is composed of white matter: millions of axons that have their dendrites and terminal boutons projecting in both the right and left hemisphere. However, there is evidence that the corpus callosum may also have some inhibitory functions. Post-mortem research on human and monkey brains shows that the corpus callosum is functionally organized. This organization results in modality-specific regions of the corpus callosum that are responsible for the transfer of different types of information. Research has revealed that the anterior midbody transfers motor information, the posterior midbody transfers somatosensory information, the isthmus transfers auditory information, and the splenium transfers visual information. Although much of the inter-hemispheric transfer occurs at the corpus callosum, there are trace amounts of transfer via commissural pathways, such as the anterior commissure, posterior commissure, habenular commissure, and the hippocampal commissure.

Studies of the effects on the visual pathway on split-brained patients has revealed that there is a redundancy gain (the ability of target detection to benefit from multiple copies of the target) in simple reaction time. In a simple response to visual stimuli, split-brained patients experience a faster reaction time to bilateral stimuli than predicted by model. A model proposed by Iacoboni et al. suggests split-brained patients experience asynchronous activity that causes a stronger signal, and thus a decreased reaction time. Iacoboni also suggests there exists dual attention in split-brained patients, which implies that each cerebral hemisphere has its own attentional system. An alternative approach taken by Reuter-Lorenz et al. suggests that enhanced redundancy gain in the split brain is primarily due to a slowing of responses to unilateral stimuli, rather than a speeding of responses to bilateral ones.

The simple reaction time in split-brained patients, even with enhanced redundancy gain, is slower than the reaction time of normal adults.

=== Functional plasticity ===

Following a stroke or other injury to the brain, functional deficiencies are common. The deficits are expected to be in areas related to the part of the brain that has been damaged; if a stroke has occurred in the motor cortex, deficits may include paralysis, abnormal posture, or abnormal movement synergies. Significant recovery occurs during the first several weeks after the injury. However, recovery is generally thought not to continue past six months. If a specific region of the brain is injured or destroyed, its functions can sometimes be transferred and taken over by a neighboring region. There is little functional plasticity observed in partial and complete callosotomies; however, much more plasticity can be seen in infant patients receiving a hemispherectomy, which suggests that the opposite hemisphere can adapt some functions typically performed by its opposite pair. A study performed by Anderson et al. (2005) proved a correlation between the severity of the injury, the age of the individual, and their cognitive performance. It was evident that there was more neuroplasticity in older children—even if their injury was extremely severe—than in infants who suffered moderate brain injury. In some incidents of any moderate to severe brain injury, it mostly causes developmental impairments and in some of the most severe injuries it can cause a profound impact on their development that can lead to long-term cognitive effects. In the aging brain, it is extremely uncommon for neuroplasticity to occur; &quot;olfactory bulb and hippocampus are two regions of the mammalian brain in which mutations preventing adult neurogenesis were never beneficial, or simply never occurred&quot;.
=== Corpus callosotomy ===

Corpus callosotomy is a surgical procedure that sections the corpus callosum, resulting in either the partial or complete disconnection between the two hemispheres. It is typically used as a last-resort measure in treatment of intractable epilepsy. The modern procedure typically involves only the anterior third of the corpus callosum; however, if the epileptic seizures continue, the following third is lesioned prior to the remaining third if the seizures persist. This results in a complete callosotomy in which most of the information transfer between hemispheres is lost.

Due to the functional mapping of the corpus callosum, a partial callosotomy has fewer detrimental effects because it leaves parts of the corpus callosum intact. There is little functional plasticity observed in partial and complete callosotomies on adults; the most neuroplasticity is seen in young children but not in infants.

It is known that when the corpus callosum is severed during an experimental procedure, the experimenter can ask each side of the brain the same question and receive two different answers. When the experimenter asks the right visual field / left hemisphere what they see the participant will respond verbally, whereas if the experimenter asks the left visual field / right hemisphere what they see the participant will not be able to respond verbally but will pick up the appropriate object with their left hand.

=== Memory ===
It is known that the right and the left hemisphere have different functions when it comes to memory. The right hemisphere is better at recognizing objects and faces, recalling knowledge that the individual has already learned, or recalling images already seen. The left hemisphere is better at mental manipulation, language production, and semantic priming but was more susceptible to memory confusion than the right hemisphere. The main issue for individuals that have undergone a callosotomy is that because the function of memory is split into two major systems, the individual is more likely to become confused between knowledge they already know and information that they have only inferred.

In tests, memory in either hemisphere of split-brained patients is generally lower than normal, though better than in patients with amnesia, suggesting that the forebrain commissures are important for the formation of some kinds of memory. This suggests that posterior callosal sections that include the hippocampal commissures cause a mild memory deficit (in standardized free-field testing) involving recognition. This makes first-person accounts hard to consider and to assess as scientists don&#x27;t know if the consciousness was split as well.

=== Control ===

In general, split-brained patients behave in a coordinated, purposeful, and consistent manner, despite the independent, parallel, usually different, and occasionally conflicting processing of the same information from the environment by the two disconnected hemispheres. When two hemispheres receive competing stimuli at the same time, the response mode tends to determine which hemisphere controls behavior.

Often, split-brained patients are indistinguishable from normal adults. This is due to the compensatory phenomena; split-brained patients progressively acquire a variety of strategies to get around their interhemispheric transfer deficits. One issue that can happen with their body control is that one side of the body is doing the opposite of the other side, called the intermanual effect.

=== Attention ===

Experiments on covert orienting of spatial attention using the Posner paradigm confirm the existence of two different attentional systems in the two hemispheres. The right hemisphere was found superior to the left hemisphere on modified versions of spatial relations tests and in locations testing, whereas the left hemisphere was more object based. The components of mental imagery are differentially specialized: the right hemisphere was found superior for mental rotation, the left hemisphere superior for image generation. It was also found that the right hemisphere paid more attention to landmarks and scenes whereas the left hemisphere paid more attention to exemplars of categories.

=== Surgery procedure ===
The surgical operation to produce this condition (corpucallosotomy) involves transection of the corpus callosum, and is usually a last resort to treat refractory epilepsy. To lower the degree and ferocity of epileptic convulsions, partial callosotomies are first done; if these are unsuccessful, a callosotomy is next carried out to reduce the risk of unintentional bodily harm. Epilepsy is first managed with medications rather than callosotomies. Neuropsychological evaluations following surgery are frequently carried out.

== Case studies of split-brain patients ==

=== Patient WJ ===

Patient WJ was the first patient to undergo a full corpus callosotomy in 1962, after experiencing fifteen years of convulsions resulting from grand mal seizures. He was a World War II paratrooper who was injured at 30 years old during a bombing raid jump over the Netherlands, and again in a prison camp following his first injury. After returning home, he began to suffer from blackouts in which he would not remember what he was doing or where, and how or when he got there. At age 37, he suffered his first generalized convulsion. One of his worst episodes occurred in 1953, when he suffered a series of convulsions lasting for many days. During these convulsions, his left side would go numb and he would recover quickly, but after the series of convulsions, he never regained complete feeling on his left side.

Before his surgery, both hemispheres functioned and interacted normally, his sensory and motor functions were normal aside from slight hypoesthesia, and he could correctly identify and understand visual stimuli presented to both sides of his visual field. During his surgery in 1962, his surgeons determined that no massa intermedia had developed, and he had undergone atrophy in the part of the right frontal lobe exposed during the procedure. His operation was a success, in that it led to decreases in the frequency and intensity of his seizures.

=== Patient JW ===

Funnell et al. (2007) tested patient JW some time before June 2006. They described JW as

Funnell et al.&#x27;s (2007) experiments were to determine each of JW&#x27;s hemisphere&#x27;s ability to perform simple addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. For example, in one experiment, on each trial, they presented an arithmetic problem in the center of the screen for one second, followed by a central crosshair JW was to look at. After one more second, Funnell et al. presented a number to one or the other hemisphere / visual field for 150 ms—too fast for JW to move his eyes. Randomly in half the trials, the number was the correct answer; in the other half of the trials it was the incorrect answer. With the hand on the same side as the number, JW pressed one key if the number was correct and another key if the number was incorrect.

Funnell et al.&#x27;s results were that performance of the left hemisphere was highly accurate (around 95%)—much better than performance of the right hemisphere, which was at chance for subtraction, multiplication, and division. Nevertheless the right hemisphere showed better-than-chance performance for addition (around 58%).

Turk et al. (2002) tested hemispheric differences in JW&#x27;s recognition of himself and of familiar faces. They used faces that were composites of JW&#x27;s face and Dr. Michael Gazzaniga&#x27;s face. Composites ranged from 100% JW, through 50% JW and 50% Gazzaniga, to 100% Gazzaniga. JW pressed keys to say whether a presented face looked like him or Gazzaniga. Turk et al. concluded there are cortical networks in the left hemisphere that play an important role in self-recognition.

=== Patient VP ===

Patient VP is a woman who underwent a two-stage callosotomy in 1979 at the age of 27. Although the callosotomy was reported to be complete, a follow-up MRI in 1984 revealed spared fibers in the rostrum and splenium. The spared rostral fibers constituted approximately 1.8% of the total cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum and the spared splenial fibers constituted approximately 1% of the area. VP&#x27;s postsurgery intelligence and memory quotients were within normal limits.

One of the experiments involving VP attempted to investigate systematically the types of visual information that could be transferred via VP&#x27;s spared splenial fibers. The first experiment was designed to assess VP&#x27;s ability to make between-field perceptual judgments about simultaneously presented pairs of stimuli. The stimuli were presented in varying positions with respect to the horizontal and vertical midline with VP&#x27;s vision fixated on a central crosshair. The judgments were based on differences in color, shape or size. The testing procedure was the same for all three types of stimuli; after presentation of each pair, VP verbally responded &quot;yes&quot; if the two items in the pair were identical and &quot;no&quot; if they were not. The results show that there was no perceptual transfer for color, size or shape with binomial tests showing that VP&#x27;s accuracy was not greater than chance.

A second experiment involving VP attempted to investigate what aspects of words transferred between the two hemispheres. The set up was similar to the previous experiment, with VP&#x27;s vision fixated on a central crosshair. A word pair was presented with one word on each side of the crosshair for 150 ms. The words presented were in one of four categories: words that looked and sounded like rhymes (e.g. tire and fire), words that looked as if they should rhyme but did not (e.g. cough and dough), words that did not look as if they should rhyme but did (e.g. bake and ache), and words that neither looked nor sounded like rhymes (e.g. keys and fort). After presentation of each word pair, VP responded &quot;yes&quot; if the two words rhymed and &quot;no&quot; if they did not. VP&#x27;s performance was above chance and she was able to distinguish among the different conditions. When the word pairs did not sound like rhymes, VP was able to say accurately that the words did not rhyme, regardless of whether or not they looked as if they should rhyme. When the words did rhyme, VP was more likely to say they rhymed, particularly if the words also looked as if they should rhyme.

Although VP showed no evidence for transfer of color, shape or size, there was evidence for transfer of word information. This is consistent with the speculation that the transfer of word information involves fibers in the ventroposterior region of the splenium—the same region in which VP had callosal sparing. VP is able to integrate words presented to both visual fields, creating a concept that is not suggested by either word. For example, she combines &quot;head&quot; and &quot;stone&quot; to form the integrated concept of a tombstone.

=== Kim Peek ===

Kim Peek was arguably the most well-known savant. He was born on November 11, 1951, with an enlarged head, sac-like protrusions of the brain and the membranes that cover it through openings in the skull, a malformed cerebellum, and without a corpus callosum, an anterior commissure, or a posterior commissure. He was able to memorize over 9,000 books, and information from approximately 15 subject areas. These include: world/American history, sports, movies, geography, actors and actresses, the Bible, church history, literature, classical music, area codes/zip codes of the United States, television stations serving these areas, and step-by-step directions within any major U.S. city. Despite these abilities, he had an IQ of 87, was diagnosed as autistic, was unable to button his shirt, and had difficulties performing everyday tasks. The missing structures of his brain have yet to be linked to his increased abilities, but they can be linked to his ability to read pages of a book in 8–10 seconds. He was able to view the left page of a book with his left visual field and the right page of a book with his right visual fields so he could read both pages simultaneously. He also had developed language areas in both hemispheres, something very uncommon in split-brain patients. Language is processed in areas of the left temporal lobe, and involves a contralateral transfer of information before the brain can process what is being read. In Peek&#x27;s case, there was no transfer ability—this is what led to his development of language centers in each hemisphere. 

Although Peek did not undergo corpus callosotomy, he is considered a natural split-brain patient and is critical to understanding the importance of the corpus callosum. Kim Peek died in 2009.

<doc id="490264" wikidata="Q3569279" url="?curid=490264" title="Windmill Theatre">
<text>The Windmill Theatre in Great Windmill Street, London, was a variety and revue theatre best known for its nude &quot;tableaux vivants&quot;, which began in 1932 and lasted until its reversion to a cinema in 1964. Many prominent British comedians of the post-war years started their careers at the theatre.

== As the Palais de Luxe ==
Great Windmill Street took its name from a windmill that stood there from the reign of King Charles II until the late 18th century. In 1909 a cinema, the Palais de Luxe, opened on the site. It stood on the corner of a block of buildings that included the Apollo and Lyric theatres, where Archer Street joined Great Windmill Street, just off Shaftesbury Avenue. The building complex incorporates Piccadilly Buildings, an 1897 building which housed the offices of British Mutoscope and Biograph Company, an early producer of films.

The Palais de Luxe was one of the first places where early silent films were shown. As larger cinemas were opened in the West End, business slowed and the Palais de Luxe was forced to close. It was re-opened briefly by Elsie Cohen in 1929 when it was briefly the first &quot;art cinema&quot; in Britain showing foreign films. Cohen would re-establish the idea at the Academy Cinema in Oxford Street in 1931.

== The Windmill ==
In 1930, after her husband&#x27;s death, Laura Henderson bought the Palais de Luxe building and hired F. Edward Jones, an architect, to remodel the interior to a small 320-seat, two-tier (stalls and circle) theatre. It was then renamed the Windmill. It opened on 15 June 1931, as a playhouse with a new play by Michael Barringer called &quot;Inquest&quot;. Its existence as a theatre was short and unprofitable, and it soon returned to screening films, such as &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; (1930) starring Marlene Dietrich.

Mrs Henderson hired a new theatre manager, Vivian Van Damm, who developed the idea of the Revudeville—a programme of continuous variety that ran from 2:30 pm until 11 pm. They began to put on shows with singers, dancers, showgirls, and specialty numbers. The first Revudeville act opened on 3 February 1932, featuring 18 unknown acts. These continued to be unprofitable; in all, the theatre lost £20,000 in the first four years after its opening.

Amrit Walia, the co-founder, said: &quot;In the 1930s Laura Henderson famously broke conventions and challenged norms to create the famous institution known as the Windmill Theatre&quot;.

=== Windmill Girls ===
A breakthrough came when Van Damm began to incorporate glamorous nude females on stage, inspired by the Folies Bergère and Moulin Rouge in Paris. This coup was made possible by convincing Lord Cromer, then Lord Chamberlain, in his position as the censor for all theatrical performances in London, that the display of nudity in theatres was not obscene: since the authorities could not credibly hold nude statues to be morally objectionable, the theatre presented its nudes — the legendary &quot;Windmill Girls&quot; — in motionless poses as living statues or &quot;tableaux vivants&quot;. The ruling: &#x27;If you move, it&#x27;s rude.&#x27; The Windmill&#x27;s shows became a huge commercial success, and the Windmill girls took their show on tour to other London and provincial theatres and music halls. The Piccadilly and Pavilion theatres copied the format and ran non-stop shows, reducing the Windmill&#x27;s attendance.

=== Tableaux vivants ===
Van Damm produced a series of nude tableaux vivants based on themes such as Annie Oakley, mermaids, American Indians, and Britannia. Typically, nude performers would assemble onstage with the curtain down (i.e. out of sight of the audience) and then strike poses before the curtain went up. The performers would then hold those poses, remaining perfectly still until the curtain came down again. Alternatively, a succession of nude performers would stand in the wings on trolleys and be wheeled onstage from the wings by a fully-clothed stage-hand. In all cases the performers themselves had to remain completely motionless, as if they were a statue made of stone or bronze.

Later, movement was introduced in the form of the fan dance, where a naked dancing girl&#x27;s body was concealed by fans held by herself and four female attendants. At the end of the act the girl would stand stock still, and her attendants would remove the concealing fans to reveal her nudity. The girl would then hold the pose for about ten seconds before the close of the performance. Another way the spirit of the law was evaded, enabling the girl to move, and thus satisfying the demands of the audience, was by moving the props rather than the girls. Ruses such as a technically motionless nude girl holding on to a spinning rope were used. Since the rope was moving rather than the girl, authorities allowed it, even though the girl&#x27;s body was displayed in motion.

===&quot;We Never Closed&quot;: World War II===
The theatre&#x27;s famous motto &quot;We Never Closed&quot; (often humorously modified to &quot;We Never Clothed&quot;) was a reference to the fact that the theatre remained open, apart from the compulsory closure that affected all theatres for 13 days (4 to 16 September) in 1939. Performances continued throughout the Second World War even at the height of the Blitz. The showgirls, cast members, and crew moved into the safety of the theatre&#x27;s two underground floors during some of the worst air attacks, from 7 September 1940 to 11 May 1941.

Many of the Windmill&#x27;s patrons were families and troops, as well as celebrities who came as Henderson&#x27;s guests. These high society guests included Princesses Helena Victoria and Marie Louise (granddaughters of Queen Victoria). For a time, on the opening night of every new Windmill show, the Royal Box was always reserved for the Rt. Hon. George Lansbury, a member of His Majesty&#x27;s Government. 

The theatre ran into the occasional problem with male patrons, but security guards were always on the lookout for improper behaviour. One of the more comical off-stage acts was the spectacle of the &quot;Windmill Steeplechase&quot; where, at the end of a show, patrons from the back rows would make a dash over the top of the seats to grab the front rows for the following show.

== Postwar years ==
When Mrs Henderson died on 29 November 1944, aged 82, she left the Windmill to Van Damm. During his tenure, the Windmill was home to numerous famous comedians and actors who had their first real success there, including Jimmy Edwards, Harry Worth, Tony Hancock, Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers, Michael Bentine, George Martin, Bruce Forsyth, Arthur English, Tommy Cooper and Barry Cryer. Cryer was &quot;a bottom of the bill&quot; comic at the Windmill, while Forsyth performed as a juvenile performer — a superior post. A number of the most celebrated photographic pin-up models of the 1950s and early 1960s also did a stint as Windmill Girls, including June Palmer, Lyn Shaw, June Wilkinson, and Lorraine Burnett.

Van Damm ran the theatre until his death on 14 December 1960, aged approximately 71. He left the theatre to his daughter, rally driver Sheila Van Damm. She struggled to keep it going, but by this time, London&#x27;s Soho neighbourhood had become a seedier place. The Soho neighbourhood of the 1930s and 1940s had been a respectable place filled with shops and family restaurants. The Revudeville shows ran from 1932 to 1964, until the Windmill officially closed on 31 October 1964.

=== Windmill Cinema ===
The theatre then changed hands and became the Windmill Cinema (with a casino incorporated in the building), having been bought by the Compton Cinema Group run by Michael Klinger and Tony Tenser. On 2 November 1964, the Windmill Cinema opened with the film &quot;Nude Las Vegas&quot;. The cinema became part of the Classic Cinema chain in May 1966. On 9 June 1974, the Windmill Cinema closed. 

=== 1974 to Present: Multiple Changes ===
The cinema&#x27;s lease was bought in February 1974 by nightclub and erotica entrepreneur Paul Raymond. Raymond returned it to a venue for nude shows &quot;à la Revuedeville but without the comic element&quot;. The first production at the now renamed Windmill Theatre was a play called &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Laid&quot;, which opened on 2 September 1974, and starred Fiona Richmond and John Inman. A nude dance show called &quot;Rip-Off&quot; was the next production at the theatre; this show commenced on 10 May 1976. Paul Raymond re-introduced burlesque when he renamed the Windmill &quot;La Vie en Rose Show Bar&quot; and opened the venue as a supper club with a laser disco on 16 November 1982. 

The venue became Paramount City in May 1986, a cabaret club managed for a short duration by Debbie Raymond, Paul Raymond&#x27;s daughter. A period as a television studio followed – the Sky television programme &quot;Jameson Tonight&quot; was produced in the studio. In 1989, Big Bang performed their Arabic Circus Tour at the Windmill Theatre.

In 1994, the former theatre part of the building was leased to Oscar Owide as a Wild West venue which became after a short time an erotic table-dancing club called The Windmill International, run by Oscar Owide and his son Daniel. Until 2009, the Paul Raymond Organisation occupied the Piccadilly Buildings section of the building as their offices. A &quot;gas or electricity explosion&quot; occurred in the male toilets of the Windmill Club on 3 March 2017, causing damage to the adjacent pavement, and leading to a brief evacuation of the building and surrounding area. Oscar Owide died in December 2017. A month later, the Windmill lost its licence because it had been found to have broken the &quot;no touching&quot; requirement between performers and clients.

In May 2021, it was announced that the Windmill would reopen as a 350-seat restaurant and bar, with a cabaret.

== Film and stage depictions ==
There have been four films about or featuring The Windmill:
*&quot;Tonight and Every Night&quot; (1945), starring Rita Hayworth, was made in Technicolor, based on Leslie Storm&#x27;s Broadway play &quot;Heart of the City&quot;. Although the theatre in the film is called &quot;The Music Box&quot;, it is a thinly-disguised Windmill, featuring American GIs in attendance during war-torn London, and the theatre&#x27;s being hit by bombs in the Blitz. The film does not feature a Vivian Van Damm character. However, the theatre is run by May Tolliver, played by Florence Bates — who could be construed as being Mrs Henderson. There is no hint in this film that the theatre featured nudes.
*&quot;Murder at the Windmill&quot; (1949), called &quot;Mystery at the Burlesque&quot; in the US, is a low-budget exploitation film, and little more than an excuse to feature the Windmill boys and girls performing intercut with a plot about the murder of an attendee. Van Damm auditioned to play himself but was considered &quot;too wooden&quot;. It featured marked early appearances for Diana Decker, Jon Pertwee, and Jimmy Edwards. It was the first film for producer Danny Angel, who was married to Van Damm&#x27;s daughter Betty.
*&quot;Secrets of a Windmill Girl&quot; (1966) was even more exploitative. It features the first appearance of Pauline Collins, Martin Jarvis, Dana Gillespie, and some of the former Windmill Theatre dancers including Pat Patterson, Jill Millard, and Sadie Comben.
* &quot;Mrs Henderson Presents&quot; (2005), a comedy-drama BBC film about the theatre, starring Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins, was critically acclaimed but not a strong commercial success.
* &quot;Mrs Henderson Presents&quot; (2015), a musical comedy based on the film, which premiered at the Theatre Royal Bath before a short run in the West End.

<text>John Harvey Kellogg (February 26, 1852 – December 14, 1943) was an American businessman, inventor, physician, and advocate of the Progressive Movement. He was the director of the Battle Creek Sanitarium in Battle Creek, Michigan, founded by members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. It combined aspects of a European spa, a hydrotherapy institution, a hospital and high-class hotel. Kellogg treated the rich and famous, as well as the poor who could not afford other hospitals. According to &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, his &quot;development of dry breakfast cereals was largely responsible for the creation of the flaked-cereal industry, with the founding and the culmination of the global conglomeration brand of Kellogg&#x27;s (now Kellanova).&quot;

An early proponent of the germ theory of disease, Kellogg was well ahead of his time in relating intestinal flora and the presence of bacteria in the intestines to health and disease. The sanitarium approached treatment in a holistic manner, actively promoting vegetarianism, nutrition, the use of yogurt enemas to clear &quot;intestinal flora&quot;, exercise, sun-bathing, and hydrotherapy, as well as abstinence from smoking tobacco, drinking alcoholic beverages, and sexual activity. Kellogg dedicated the last 30 years of his life to promoting eugenics and segregation. Kellogg was a major leader in progressive health reform, particularly in the second phase of the clean living movement. He wrote extensively on science and health. His approach to &quot;biologic living&quot; combined scientific knowledge with Adventist beliefs, promoting health reform, and temperance. Many of the vegetarian foods that Kellogg developed and offered his patients were publicly marketed: Kellogg&#x27;s brother, Will Keith Kellogg, is best known today for the invention of the breakfast cereal corn flakes. 

Kellogg held liberal theological beliefs radically different from mainstream Nicene Christianity and emphasized what he saw as the importance of human reason over many aspects of traditional doctrinal authority. He strongly rejected fundamentalist and conservative notions of original sin, human depravity, and the atonement of Jesus, viewing the last in terms of &quot;his exemplary life&quot; on Earth rather than death. Becoming a Seventh-day Adventist as their beliefs shifted towards Trinitarianism during the 1890s, Adventists were &quot;unable to accommodate the essentially liberal understanding of Christianity&quot; exhibited by Kellogg, viewing his theology as pantheistic and unorthodox. Disagreements with other members of the SDA led to a major schism: he was disfellowshipped in 1907, but continued to follow many of their beliefs and directed the sanitarium until his death. Kellogg helped to establish the American Medical Missionary College in 1895. Popular misconceptions have wrongly attributed various cultural practices, inventions, and historical events to Kellogg.

==Early life==
John Harvey Kellogg was born in Tyrone, Michigan, on February 26, 1852, to John Preston Kellogg (1806–1881) and his second wife Ann Janette Stanley (1824–1893). His father, John Preston Kellogg, was born in Hadley, Massachusetts; his ancestry can be traced back to the founding of Hadley, Massachusetts, where a great-grandfather operated a ferry. 
John Preston Kellogg and his family moved to Michigan in 1834, and after his first wife&#x27;s death and his remarriage in 1842, to a farm in Tyrone Township.
In addition to six children from his first marriage, John Preston Kellogg had 11 children with his second wife Ann, including John Harvey and his younger brother, Will Keith Kellogg.

John Preston Kellogg became a member of several revivalist movements, including the Baptists, the Congregationalist Church, and finally the Seventh-day Adventist Church. He was one of four adherents who pledged substantial sums to convince Seventh-day Adventists Ellen G. White and her husband James Springer White to relocate to Battle Creek, Michigan, with their publishing business, in 1855. He persuaded a Seventh-day Adventist couple, Daniel H. Kress and Lauretta E. Kress, to become doctors at Michigan where he had studied; they were early founders of what became Washington Adventist Hospital. In 1856, the Kellogg family moved to Battle Creek to be near other members of the denomination. There John Preston Kellogg established a broom factory. The Kelloggs believed that the Second Coming of Christ was imminent, and that formal education of their children was therefore unnecessary. Originally a sickly child, John Harvey Kellogg attended Battle Creek public schools only briefly, from ages 9–11. He left school to work sorting brooms in his father&#x27;s broom factory. Nonetheless, he read voraciously and acquired a broad but largely self-taught education. At age 12, John Harvey Kellogg was offered work by the Whites. He became one of their protégés, rising from errand boy to printer&#x27;s devil, and eventually doing proofreading and editorial work. He helped to set articles for &quot;Health, or how to live&quot; and &quot;The Health Reformer&quot;, becoming familiar with Ellen G. White&#x27;s theories of health, and beginning to follow recommendations such as a vegetarian diet. Ellen White described her husband&#x27;s relationship with John Harvey Kellogg as closer than that with his own children.

Kellogg hoped to become a teacher, and at age 16 taught a district school in Hastings, Michigan. By age 20, he had enrolled in a teacher&#x27;s training course offered by Michigan State Normal School. The Kelloggs and the Whites, however, convinced him to join his half-brother Merritt, Edson White, William C. White, and Jennie Trembley, as students in a six-month medical course at Russell Trall&#x27;s Hygieo-Therapeutic College in Florence Township, New Jersey. Their goal was to develop a group of trained doctors for the Adventist-inspired Western Health Reform Institute in Battle Creek. Under the Whites&#x27; patronage, John Harvey Kellogg went on to attend medical school at the University of Michigan and the Bellevue Hospital Medical College in New York City. He graduated in 1875 with a medical degree. In October 1876, Kellogg became director of the Western Health Reform Institute. In 1877, he renamed it the Battle Creek Medical Surgical Sanitarium, cleverly coining the term &quot;sanitarium&quot; to suggest both hospital care and the importance of sanitation and personal health.
Kellogg would lead the institution until his death in 1943.

==Theological views==
Kellogg was brought up in the Seventh-day Adventist Church from childhood. Selected as a protégé of the Whites and trained as a doctor, Kellogg held a prominent role as a speaker at church meetings. Throughout his lifetime, Kellogg experienced pressure from both science and religion regarding his theological views.
At the Seventeenth Annual Session of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, October 4, 1878, the following action was taken:

=== Theological modernism ===
Kellogg rejected Christian fundamentalism and promoted the tenets of theological modernism. He rejected many of the traditional tenets of Nicene Christianity, viewing the atonement of Jesus as &quot;his exemplary life&quot; on Earth rather than the Cross. Kellogg mocked the concepts of original sin and inherent human depravity, frequently joking that &quot;the total depravity which we often hear talked about is, half the time at least, nothing more nor less than total indigestion&quot;. Historian Brian C. Wilson writes:One of the most controversial aspects of Kellogg&#x27;s developing theology... was its decidedly non-Christocentric focus. While &quot;God&quot; is mentioned one hundred times, &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; is mentioned only briefly, twelve times, and is treated as something of a peripheral character. 

===Harmony of science and the Bible===
Kellogg defended &quot;the harmony of science and the Bible&quot; throughout his career, but he was active at a transitional time, when both science and medicine were becoming increasingly secularized. White and others in the Adventist ministry worried that Kellogg&#x27;s students and staff were in danger of losing their religious beliefs, while Kellogg felt that many ministers failed to recognize his expertise and the importance of his medical work. There were ongoing tensions between his authority as a doctor, and their authority as ministers. 
Nonetheless, Kellogg attempted to reconcile science and medicine with religion, rejecting their separation, and emphasizing the presence of God within God&#x27;s creation of living things.

He further elaborated these ideas in his book &quot;The Living Temple&quot; (1903):

At the same time that Kellogg defended the presence of God in nature against secularization, his co-religionists saw his descriptions of the presence of God in nature as evidence of
panentheistic tendencies (Everything is in God). 
Kellogg rejected their religious criticisms, asserting that his views on indwelling divinity were simply a restatement of the omnipresence of God, and not pantheism.

===Pantheism Crisis===
His theological views went against many of the traditional tenets of Nicene Christianity. As Seventh-day Adventist beliefs shifted towards orthodox Trinitarianism during the 1890s, Adventists within the denominations were &quot;unable to accommodate the essentially liberal understanding of Christianity&quot; exhibited by Kellogg, viewing his theology as pantheistic and unorthodox. What came to be referred to as the &quot;Pantheism Crisis&quot; of 1903 was a pivotal moment in the church&#x27;s history. Kellogg&#x27;s theological views were only one of the issues involved: operation of the sanitarium was equally if not more important. 
Control of the sanitarium and its finances had been a source of contention for some time, especially as the institution expanded and attracted more affluent patients. 
Tensions came to a head when the Battle Creek Sanitarium, originally owned by the Seventh-day Adventist Church but run by Kellogg, was destroyed by fire on February 18, 1902. Although almost all of the guests escaped safely, property loss was estimated at $300,000 to $400,000, about twice the insured value.

Ellen G. White, who had proclaimed that a cleansing sword of fire was poised over the increasingly &quot;worldly&quot; and business-oriented Battle Creek, was against rebuilding the large institution. Although she apparently wrote a manuscript testifying against the rebuilding in 1902, it was not sent to Kellogg at that time, and Kellogg did not directly consult her about his plans. With support of the board of directors, he not only rebuilt the institution, but doubled its size. The new building was designed by architect Frank Mills Andrews of Ohio and opened on May 31, 1903. Designed to be fireproof, the new brick building was six stories high, with an elegant frontage extending 550 feet along Washington Avenue, and three wings opening out behind. It included, among other things, a solarium and palm court, and it cost more than $700,000.

===Disfellowship===
Kellogg used proceeds from his book &quot;The Living Temple&quot; to help pay the costs of reconstruction. The book&#x27;s printing was opposed by a commission of the General Council of the Adventists after W. W. Prescott, one of the four members of the commission, argued that it was heretical. When Kellogg arranged to print it privately, the book went through its own trial by fire: on December 30, 1902, fire struck the &quot;Herald&quot; where the book was typeset and ready to print. When it finally appeared in 1903, the book was sharply criticized by White for what she considered its many statements of pantheism. Over the next few years, there was increasing conflict between Kellogg, General Conference President A. G. Daniells and others. In 1907, Kellogg was &quot;disfellowshipped&quot;, as part of a schism that split the church. Kellogg retained control of the Battle Creek Sanitarium and the American Medical Missionary College, and continued to promote Adventist ideas of health and well-being at those institutions.

In later life, Kellogg spoke positively of Seventh-day Adventists and Ellen G. White&#x27;s prophetic ministry, despite their struggles. In 1941, in response to critic E. S. Ballenger, Kellogg admonished Ballenger for his critical attitude to Mrs. White.

==Battle Creek Sanitarium==
Kellogg was a Seventh-day Adventist until mid-life, and gained fame while being the chief medical officer of the Battle Creek Sanitarium, which was owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The sanitarium was operated based on the church&#x27;s health principles. Adventists believe in promoting a vegetarian diet, abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, and a regimen of exercise, all of which Kellogg followed. He is remembered as an advocate of vegetarianism and wrote in favor of it, even after leaving the Adventist Church. His dietary advice in the late 19th century discouraged meat-eating, but not emphatically so. His development of a bland diet was driven in part by the Adventist goal of reducing sexual stimulation. 

Kellogg was an especially strong proponent of nuts, which he believed would save humanity in the face of decreasing food supplies. Though mainly renowned nowadays for his development of corn flakes, Kellogg also invented a process for making peanut butter and developed healthy &quot;granose biscuits&quot; which became popular as far away as Australia and England.

The Battle Creek Sanitarium had its own experimental kitchen. There, Ella Eaton Kellogg helped to develop vegetarian foods, and supervised a &quot;school of cookery&quot; which taught classes in food preparation for homemakers. She published a cookbook, &quot;Science in the Kitchen&quot;, containing hundreds of recipes along with discussions of nutrition and household and diet management. Some of its inventive vegetarian recipes use food products created at the sanitarium, such as Nuttolene (a meat pâté made from peanuts), 
Protose (a combination of nuts and grains), and various types of nut butters.

Kellogg believed that most disease is alleviated by a change in intestinal flora. He posited that bacteria in the intestines can either help or hinder the body; that pathogenic bacteria produce toxins during the digestion of protein which poison the blood; that a poor diet favors harmful bacteria that can then infect other tissues in the body; that the intestinal flora is changed by diet and is generally changed for the better by a well-balanced vegetarian diet favoring low-protein, laxative, and high-fiber foods. He recommended various regimens of specific foods designed to heal particular ailments.

Kellogg further believed that natural changes in intestinal flora could be sped by enemas seeded with favorable bacteria. He advocated the frequent use of an enema machine to cleanse the bowel with several gallons of water. Water enemas were followed by the administration of a pint of yogurt – half was eaten, the other half was administered by enema, &quot;thus planting the protective germs where they are most needed and may render most effective service.&quot; The yogurt served to replace the intestinal flora of the bowel, creating what Kellogg claimed was a squeaky-clean intestine.
Sanitarium visitors also engaged in breathing exercises and mealtime marches, to promote proper digestion of food throughout the day. Because Kellogg was a staunch supporter of phototherapy, the sanitarium made use of artificial sunbaths. Kellogg was a skilled surgeon, who often donated his services to indigent patients at his clinic. 

He had many notable patients, such as former president William Howard Taft, composer and pianist Percy Grainger, arctic explorers Vilhjalmur Stefansson and Roald Amundsen, world travellers Richard Halliburton and Lowell Thomas, aviator Amelia Earhart, economist Irving Fisher, Nobel prize winning playwright George Bernard Shaw, actor and athlete Johnny Weissmuller, founder of the Ford Motor Company Henry Ford, inventor Thomas Edison, African-American activist Sojourner Truth, and actress Sarah Bernhardt.

==Patents and inventions==
===Foods===
John Harvey Kellogg developed and marketed a wide variety of vegetarian foods. Many of them were meant to be suitable for an invalid diet, and were intentionally made easy to chew and to digest. Starchy foods such as grains were ground and baked, to promote the conversion of starch into dextrin. Nuts were ground and boiled or steamed.

The foods Kellogg developed also tended to be bland. In this, Kellogg followed the teachings of Ellen G. White and Sylvester Graham who recommended a diet of bland foods to minimize excitement, sexual arousal, and masturbation.

====Breakfast cereals====

Around 1877, John H. Kellogg began experimenting to produce a softer breakfast food, something easy to chew. He developed a dough that was a mixture of wheat, oats, and corn. It was baked at high temperatures for a long period of time, to break down or &quot;dextrinize&quot; starch molecules in the grain. After it cooled, Kellogg broke the bread into crumbs. The cereal was originally marketed under the name &quot;Granula&quot; but this led to legal problems with James Caleb Jackson who already sold a wheat cereal under that name. In 1881, under threat of a lawsuit by Jackson, Kellogg changed the sanitarium cereal&#x27;s name to &quot;Granola&quot;. 
It was used initially by patients at the sanitarium, but slowly began to build up a following among former patients. In 1890, John formed the Sanitas Food Company to develop and market food products.

The Kelloggs are best known for the invention of the famous breakfast cereal corn flakes. The development of the flaked cereal in 1894 has been variously described by those involved: Ella Eaton Kellogg, John Harvey Kellogg, his younger brother Will Keith Kellogg, and other family members. There is considerable disagreement over who was involved in the discovery, and the role that they played. According to some accounts, Ella suggested rolling out the dough into thin sheets, and John developed a set of rollers for the purpose. According to others, John had the idea in a dream, and used equipment in his wife&#x27;s kitchen to do the rolling. It is generally agreed that upon being called out one night, John Kellogg left a batch of wheat-berry dough behind. Rather than throwing it out the next morning, he sent it through the rollers and was surprised to obtain delicate flakes, which could then be baked. Will Kellogg was tasked with figuring out what had happened, and recreating the process reliably. Ella and Will were often at odds, and their versions of the story tend to minimize or deny each other&#x27;s involvement, while emphasizing their own part in the discovery. The process that Kellogg had discovered, tempering, was to be a fundamental technique of the flaked cereal industry.

A patent for &quot;Flaked Cereals and Process of Preparing Same&quot; was filed on May 31, 1895, and issued on April 14, 1896, to John Harvey Kellogg as Patent No. 558,393. Significantly, the patent applied to a variety of types of grains, not just to wheat. John Harvey Kellogg was the only person named on the patent. Will later insisted that he, not Ella, had worked with John, and repeatedly asserted that he should have received more credit than he was given for the discovery of the flaked cereal.

During their first year of production, the Kelloggs sold tens of thousands of pounds of flaked cereal, marketing it as &quot;Granose&quot;. They continued to experiment using rice and corn as well as wheat, and in 1898 released the first batch of Sanitas Toasted Corn Flakes. A modified version with a longer shelf life was released in 1902. By that time, both &quot;Granose Biscuits&quot; and &quot;Granose Flakes&quot; were available.

Will Kellogg continued to develop and market flaked cereal. When he proposed adding sugar to the flakes, John would not agree to the change. 
So, in 1906, Will started his own company, the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company. This marked the start of a decades-long feud between the brothers. Will&#x27;s Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company eventually became the Kellogg Company, while John was denied the right to use the Kellogg name for his cereals.

They had other competitors as well, including C. W. Post. Post was treated at the Battle Creek Sanitarium between February 6 and November 9, 1891, and later by Christian Scientists whom he credited with his successful treatment. He settled in Battle Creek, opened his own sanitarium, the LaVita Inn, in March 1892, and founded his own dry foods company, Post Holdings.
Post started selling Postum coffee substitute in 1895. 
He issued Grape-Nuts breakfast cereal, a mixture of yeast, barley and wheat, in January 1898. 
In January 1906, Post introduced &quot;Elijah&#x27;s Manna&quot;, later renaming it Post Toasties Double-Crisp Corn Flakes, and marketing it as a direct competitor to Kellogg&#x27;s Corn Flakes.

John Harvey Kellogg was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006 for the discovery of tempering and the invention of the first dry flaked breakfast cereal, which &quot;transformed the typical American breakfast&quot;.

====Peanut butter====
John H. Kellogg is one of several people who have been credited with the invention of peanut butter. 
Rose Davis of Alligerville, New York has been reported to have made a peanut spread as early as 1840, after her son described Cuban women grinding peanuts and eating the paste on bread. 
In 1884, Marcellus Gilmore Edson (1849–1940) of Montreal, Canada obtained a patent for the &quot;Manufacture of peanut-candy&quot;, combining 1 part of a &quot;flavoring paste&quot; made from roasted peanuts with 7 parts of sugar. 
By 1894, George A. Bayle of St. Louis was selling a &quot;Cheese Nut&quot; snack food containing peanuts and cheese; a peanut-only version was apparently more successful.
George Washington Carver is often credited because of his scientific work with peanuts and promotion of their use. Carver and Kellogg corresponded in the 1920s and 30s about the use of both peanuts and sweet potatoes.

Some form of nut butter, likely made with peanuts, was served to patients at the Battle Creek Sanitarium before October 1895, when Kellogg wrote to Ellen White that &quot;some very excellent preparations from nuts&quot; had entirely replaced butter.
Kellogg did not patent peanut butter explicitly, and later stated that this was intentional: &quot;Let everybody that wants it have it, and make the best use of it&quot;. Kellogg did, however, apply for two patents relating to &quot;nut butters&quot; in 1895, before anyone else did so.

On November 4, 1895, John H. Kellogg applied for two patents that are relevant to the production of peanut butter. Patent No. 567901, granted September 15, 1896, was for a &quot;Food Compound&quot; which produced &quot;an improved article of manufacture, the alimentary product composed of completely digested starch, completely-emulsified vegetable oil such as described, and thoroughly cooked and finely-divided vegetable proteins derived from nuts, as specified.&quot; 
The process described involved taking raw edible nuts, preferably peanuts or almonds, blanching them to remove their skins, and then boiling them for several hours. The nuts were then crushed and passed through rollers to separate out &quot;a fine and comparatively dry and nearly white nutmeal&quot; and a &quot;moist, pasty, adhesive, and brown&quot; butter or paste.

The second patent, No. 604493, granted on May 24, 1898, was for a &quot;Process of Producing Alimentary Products&quot; from &quot;edible nuts, preferably peanuts&quot;. The process for making the paste again involved boiling the peanuts, but noted that roasting was a possible alternative. The final substance was heated in sealed cans to obtain &quot;a product differing in many ways from the original paste&quot; with a consistency resembling cheese.

By 1898, the Kelloggs were marketing a wide variety of nut-based foods through the Sanitas Nut Food Company.
Kellogg marketed nut butters as a nutritious protein substitute for people who had difficulty chewing on solid food. Because peanuts were the least expensive nut available, they rapidly dominated the nut butter market.
Joseph Lambert, who had worked for Kellogg at the sanitarium, began selling a hand-operated peanut butter grinder in 1896. In 1899, his wife Almeida Lambert published a &quot;Guide for Nut Cookery&quot;.

====Meat substitutes====
Kellogg credited his interest in meat substitutes to Charles William Dabney, an agricultural chemist and the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture. Dabney wrote to Kellogg on the subject around 1895.

In 1896, Kellogg introduced but did not patent &quot;Nuttose&quot;, the first commercially produced alternative to meat. Nuttose was made primarily from peanuts and resembled &quot;cold roast mutton&quot;.
By seasoning or marinating, Nuttose could be made to taste like fried chicken or barbeque. Served with mashed potatoes and vegetables, it could mimic a traditional American meal.

On March 19, 1901, Kellogg was granted the first United States Patent for a &quot;vegetable substitute for meat&quot;, for a blend of nuts and grain cereals called &quot;Protose&quot;.
In applying for , Kellogg described Protose as a product &quot;which shall possess equal or greater nutritive value in equal or more available form... By proper regulation of the temperature and proportions of the ingredients, various meat-like flavors are developed, which give the finished product very characteristic properties.&quot;
Nuttose and Protose were the first of many meat alternatives.

====Other foods====
In addition to developing imitation meats variously made from nuts, grains, and soy, Kellogg also developed the first acidophilus soy milk, which was patented in 1934.
Kellogg advocated that it be administered to bottle-fed babies, to improve their intestinal fauna and combat bowel infections. Perhaps his most famous patients were the Dionne quintuplets. When he learned that Marie had a bowel infection, Kellogg sent a case of his soy acidophilus to their doctor, Allan Roy Dafoe. When Marie&#x27;s infection cleared up, Dafoe requested that Kellogg send an ongoing supply for the quintuplets. By 1937, each one consumed at least a pint per day. Another famous patient who benefited from soy acidophilus was polar explorer Richard E. Byrd.
Kellogg also sold yogurt, soy flour, and soy bread.

===Medical inventions===

Although they are less discussed than his food creations, Kellogg designed and improved upon a number of medical devices that were regularly used at the Battle Creek Sanitarium in surgical operations and in treatment modalities falling under the term &quot;physiotherapy&quot;.
Many of the machines invented by Kellogg were manufactured by the Battle Creek Sanitarium Equipment Company, which was established in 1890.
Dr. Kellogg attempted to popularize these treatment methods, including electrotherapy, hydrotherapy, and motor therapy, in his work &quot;The Home Handbook of Domestic Hygiene and Rational Medicine&quot;, first published in 1881.

As he specialized in certain gynecological surgeries (particularly hemorrhoidectomies and ovariotomies) and gastrointestinal surgeries, he developed various instruments for these operations. These included specialized hooks and retractors, a heated operating table, and an aseptic drainage tube used in abdominal surgery.

Additionally, Kellogg took keen interest in devising instruments for light therapy, mechanical exercising, proper breathing, and hydrotherapy. His medical inventions spanned a wide range of applications and included a hot air bath, vibrating chair, oscillomanipulator, window tent for fresh air, pneumograph to graphically represent respiratory habits, loofah mitt, and an apparatus for home sterilization of milk. Some of his inventions were fashionable enough to be included in the first class gymnasium of the &quot;RMS Titanic&quot;.

Kellogg did not make concerted efforts to profit from his medical inventions. Kellogg&#x27;s statement in 1916 about his food company sheds light on his general motivations: &quot;I desire to make clear...that the food business I have been carrying on is a part of my general scheme to propagate the ideas of health and biological living. Otherwise, I should not have engaged in it as a commercial enterprise, but I have carried it on as a part of the general philanthropic work in which I was engaged.&quot;

====Phototherapeutic inventions====
Partly motivated by the overcast skies of Michigan winters, Kellogg experimented with and worked to develop light therapies, as he believed in the value of the electric light bulb to provide heat penetration for treating bodily disorders.

He constructed his first incandescent light bath in 1891, claiming to treat thousands of patients at the Battle Creek Sanitarium before exhibiting the bath at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. The invention reportedly aroused little attention there but was brought back to Germany, where it began to be manufactured and sold. It was spread to Vienna by Kellogg&#x27;s friend Dr. Wilhelm Winternitz; installed in royal palaces across Europe; and popularly replaced old Turkish steam baths at athletic clubs. Only after cabinet baths became popular in Europe did demand within the United States develop. It was imported from Berlin to New York &quot;as a therapeutic novelty&quot;. In 1896, Kellogg patented the radiant-heat bath in the United States (US558394).

In order &quot;to make a record of his work and experience as a pioneer in this branch of physiotherapeutics&quot;, Kellogg published his book &quot;Light Therapeutics: a practical manual of phototherapy for the student and the practitioner, with special reference to the incandescent electric-light bath&quot; in 1910. In the short work, Kellogg describes the application of the arc light to the spine, chest, abdominal region, loins, shoulders, hip and thigh, knees and other joints. He also goes into detail about combining electrotherapies with hydrotherapies, e.g. the electric light bath with shower and shampoo.

====Electrotherapeutic inventions====
Though Kellogg stated that &quot;electricity is not capable of accomplishing half the marvels that are claimed for it by many enthusiastic electrotherapists,&quot; he still believed electric currents to be &quot;an extremely valuable therapeutic agent, especially when utilized in connection with hydrotherapy, thermotherapy, and other physiologic methods.&quot; As a result, electrotherapy coils were used in the Static Electrical Department of the Battle Creek Sanitarium especially for cases of paresthesias of neurasthenia, insomnia, and certain forms of neuralgia. Devices were also used to administer electric shocks to various parts of a patient&#x27;s body.

Vibrational therapy by way of sinusoidal (high-frequency oscillating) electric current was discovered by Kellogg in 1884 to have medical use for increasing blood circulation and passive exercise. In particular, Kellogg invented a vibrating chair used to stimulate vital organs in the lower abdomen. Even today one can visit the Kellogg Discovery Center in Battle Creek, Michigan, and sit on Kellogg&#x27;s vibrating chair, which is equipped to mechanically oscillate 20 times per second. Furthermore, Kellogg devised an electrotherapy exercise bed in which a sinusoidal current that produced muscular contraction could be delivered without pain for twenty minutes and reportedly achieve the stimulation of a brisk four-mile walk.

====Mechanical massage devices====
Massage devices included two- or four-person foot vibrators, a mechanical slapping massage device, and a kneading apparatus that was advertised in 1909 to sell for . Kellogg advocated mechanical massage, a branch of mechanotherapy, for cases of anemia, general debility, and muscular or nervous weakness.

====Irrigator====
In 1936, Kellogg filed a petition for his invention of improvements to an &quot;irrigating apparatus particularly adaptable for colonic irrigating, but susceptible of use for other irrigation treatments.&quot; The improved irrigator included features such as measuring the amount of liquid entering and exiting the colon as well as indicating and regulating the positive pressure of the pumped liquid.

At the Battle Creek Sanitarium, these colonic irrigators were often used to shoot gallons of water up patients&#x27; rectums into their colons, sometimes followed by a half-pint yogurt enema to aid in further cleaning. It has been suggested that multiple people would get this treatment at one time.

==Views on health==
===Biologic living===
Synthesizing his Adventist beliefs with his scientific and medical knowledge, Kellogg created his idea of &quot;biologic living&quot;. This was the idea that appropriate diet, exercise, and recreation was required to maintain a healthy body, mind, and soul. As such, the policies and therapies at the Battle Creek Sanitarium were very much in line with these principles of biologic living, such as the focus on vegetarianism or drinking 8–10 glasses of water a day. In fact, his belief that biologic living would protect his health was so strong that he did not even feel it necessary to get vaccinated against smallpox.

Kellogg&#x27;s philosophy was presented in seven textbooks that were prepared for Adventist schools and colleges. In these, Kellogg put his main emphasis on the value of fresh air, exercise, and sunshine, and the dangers of alcohol and tobacco. In terms of practice, Kellogg&#x27;s biologic living was very similar to the methods of Christian physiologists, requiring sexual restraint, total abstinence from drugs, and a vegetarian diet.

===Views on tobacco===
Kellogg was a prominent member of the anti-tobacco consumption campaign, speaking out often on the issue. He believed that consumption of tobacco not only caused physiological damage, but also pathological, nutritional, moral, and economic devastation onto society. His belief was that &quot;tobacco has not a single redeeming feature… and is one of the most deadly of all the many poisonous plants known to the botanist.&quot; His beliefs were very much in line with the prevailing view of the Adventists, who had become some of the most important supporters of the anti-tobacco movement.

In his 1922 book &quot;Tobaccoism, or How Tobacco Kills&quot;, Kellogg cited many studies on the negative impacts of smoking, and went so far as to attribute the longer lifespan of women to the observation that they partook in tobacco less than their male counterparts.

Kellogg also served as the president of the Michigan Anti-Cigarette Society, and after the First World War, he served as a member of the Committee of Fifty to Study the Tobacco Problem. This latter group included Henry Ford, George Peabody, and John Burroughs, and ended with the production of one of the first educational motion pictures against smoking. Kellogg&#x27;s work on several committees against smoking culminated in Utah Senator Reed Smoot introducing a bill to Congress in 1929 that aimed to put tobacco under the purview of the Pure Food and Drug Act. In the end, however, this measure failed to pass.

===Views on alcohol and other beverages===
Though alcoholic beverages were commonly used as a stimulant by the medical community during the time that Kellogg began his medical practice, he was firm in his opposition to the practice. The usage of alcohol as a remedy to anything was &quot;an evil of stupendous proportions.&quot;

Kellogg went against the prevailing notion of the time that alcohol was a stimulant. Citing contemporary research, Kellogg believed that alcohol could not be a stimulant because it lessened vital activity and depressed vital forces. Seeing its effects on plants, animals, and humans, he felt that alcohol was a poison. Kellogg noticed deleterious effects that alcohol had on both the brain, the digestive system, and the liver, among other organs.

In addition to the idea that alcohol was an unsuitable therapeutic tool, Kellogg also considered it to lead to mental and moral bankruptcy. Alcohol was &quot;one of the devil&#x27;s most efficient agents for destroying the happiness of man, both for the present and the hereafter.&quot; Even moderate drinkers were subject to these effects, as Kellogg felt that a poison was a poison in all doses.

Kellogg also opposed tea and coffee due to the caffeine content of those beverages. His view was that caffeine was a poison. Not only did he detail numerous physiological and developmental problems caused by caffeine, but he also suggested that caffeine usage could lead to moral deficiencies. He blamed the prevalence of these beverages not only on the prohibition of alcoholic beverages at the time, but also on the extensive marketing efforts organized by the producers of these products. Kellogg&#x27;s view was that &quot;nature has supplied us with pure water, with a great variety of fruit juices and wholesome and harmless flavors quite sufficient to meet all our needs.&quot;

As early as the 1880s, Kellogg had prepared charts and lectures on the dangers of tobacco and alcohol, which were used widely by lecturers who encouraged temperance in their students. In 1878, John Harvey Kellogg, along with Ellen G. White, the founder of the Seventh-day Adventists, and several others, had organized the American Health and Temperance Association. The goal of this organization was to expose the far-reaching dangers of tobacco, alcohol, tea, and coffee. For the 15 years that the organization persisted, Kellogg remained as its president.

==Hydropathy==
===Properties of water===
Kellogg has labeled the various uses of hydropathy as being byproducts of the many properties of water. In his 1876 book, &quot;The Uses of Water in Health &amp; Disease&quot;, he acknowledges both the chemical composition and physical properties of water. Hydrogen and oxygen, when separate, are two &quot;colorless, transparent, and tasteless&quot; gases, which are explosive when mixed. More importantly, water, he says, has the highest specific heat of any compound (although in actuality it does not). As such, the amount of heat and energy needed to elevate the temperature of water is significantly higher than that of other compounds like mercury. Kellogg addressed water&#x27;s ability to absorb massive amounts of energies when shifting phases. He also highlighted water&#x27;s most useful property, its ability to dissolve many other substances.

===Remedial properties of water===
According to Kellogg, water provides remedial properties partly because of vital resistance and partly because of its physical properties. For Kellogg, the medical uses of water begin with its function as a refrigerant, a way to lower body heat by way of dissipating its production as well as by conduction. &quot;There is not a drug in the whole materia medica that will diminish the temperature of the body so readily and so efficiently as water.&quot; Water can also serve as a sedative. While other substances serve as sedatives by exerting their poisonous influences on the heart and nerves, water is a gentler and more efficient sedative without any of the negative side-effects seen in these other substances. Kellogg states that a cold bath can often reduce one&#x27;s pulse by 20 to 40 beats per minute quickly, in a matter of a few minutes. Additionally, water can function as a tonic, increasing both the speed of circulation and the overall temperature of the body. A hot bath accelerates one&#x27;s pulse from 70 to 150 beats per minute in 15 minutes. Water is also useful as an anodyne since it can lower nervous sensibility and reduce pain when applied in the form of hot fomentation. Kellogg argues that this procedure will often give one relief where every other drug has failed to do so. He also believed that no other treatment could function as well as an antispasmodic, reducing infantile convulsions and cramps, as water. Water can be an effective astringent as, when applied cold, it can arrest hemorrhages. Moreover, it can be very effective in producing bowel movements. Whereas purgatives would introduce &quot;violent and unpleasant symptoms&quot;, water would not. Although it would not have much competition as an emetic at the time, Kellogg believed that no other substance could induce vomiting as well as water did. Returning to one of Kellogg&#x27;s most admired qualities of water, it can function as a &quot;most perfect eliminative&quot;. Water can dissolve waste and foreign matter from the blood. These many uses of water led Kellogg to belief that &quot;the aim of the faithful physician should be to accomplish for his patient the greatest amount of good at the least expence of vitality; and it is an indisputable fact that in a large number of cases water is just the agent with which this desirable end can be obtained.&quot;

===Incorrect uses of the water cure===
Although Kellogg praised hydropathy for its many uses, he did acknowledge its limits. &quot;In nearly all cases, sunlight, pure air, rest, exercise, proper food, and other hygienic agencies are quite as important as water. Electricity, too, is a remedy which should not be ignored; and skillful surgery is absolutely indispensable in not a small number of cases.&quot; With this belief, he went on to criticize many medical figures who misused or overestimated hydropathy in the treating of disease. Among these, he criticized what he referred to as &quot;Cold-Water Doctors&quot; who would recommend the same remedy regardless of the type of ailment or temperament of the patient. These doctors would prescribe ice-cold baths in unwarmed rooms even during the harshest winters. In his opinion, this prejudicial approach to illness resulted in converting hydropathy to a more heroic type of treatment where many became obsessed with taking baths in ice-cold water. He addresses the negative consequences that resulted from this &quot;infatuation&quot;, among them tuberculosis and other diseases. This dangerous habit was only exacerbated by physicians who used hydropathy in excess. Kellogg recounts an instance where a patient with a low typhus fever was treated with 35 cold packs while in a feeble state and, not to the surprise of Kellogg, died. Kellogg posits this excessive and dangerous use of hydropathy as a return to the &quot;violent processes&quot; of bloodletting, antimony, mercury and purgatives. Kellogg also criticizes the ignorance in &quot;Hydropathic Quacks&quot; as well as in Preissnitz, the founder of modern hydropathy, himself. Kellogg states that the &quot;Quacks&quot; as well as Preissnitz are ignorant for overestimating the hydropathy as a &quot;cure-all&quot; remedy without understanding the true nature of disease.

==Later life==
Kellogg would live for over 60 years after writing &quot;Plain Facts&quot;. He continued to work on healthy eating advice and run the sanitarium, although this was hit by the Great Depression and had to be sold. He ran another institute in Florida, which was popular throughout the rest of his life, although it was a distinct step down from his Battle Creek institute.

In 1937, Kellogg received an honorary degree in Doctor of Public Service from Oglethorpe University.

Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Will Durant, who had been a vegetarian since the age of 18, called Dr. Kellogg &quot;his old mentor&quot;, and said that Dr. Kellogg, more than any other person since his high school days, had influenced his life.

===&quot;Good Health&quot; journal===

Kellogg became editor of the &quot;Health Reformer&quot; journal in 1874. The journal changed its name to &quot;Good Health&quot; in 1879 and Kellogg held his editorial position for many years until his death. The &quot;Good Health&quot; journal had more than 20,000 subscribers and was published until 1955.

===Race Betterment Foundation===

Kellogg was outspoken about his views on race and his belief in racial segregation, regardless of the fact that he himself raised several black foster children. In 1906, together with Irving Fisher and Charles Davenport, Kellogg founded the Race Betterment Foundation, which became a major center of the new eugenics movement in America. Kellogg was in favor of racial segregation in the United States and he also believed that immigrants and non-whites would damage the white American population&#x27;s gene pool.

He co-founded the Race Betterment Foundation, co-organized several National Conferences on Race Betterment and attempted to create a &#x27;eugenics registry&#x27;. Alongside discouraging &#x27;racial mixing&#x27;, Kellogg was in favor of sterilizing &#x27;mentally defective persons&#x27;, promoting a eugenics agenda while working on the Michigan Board of Health and helping to enact authorization to sterilize those deemed &#x27;mentally defective&#x27; into state laws during his tenure.

===Late relationship with Will Keith Kellogg===
Kellogg had a long personal and business split with his brother, after fighting in court for the rights to cereal recipes. The Foundation for Economic Education records that the nonagenarian J.H. Kellogg prepared a letter seeking to reopen the relationship. His secretary decided her employer had demeaned himself in it and refused to send it. The younger Kellogg did not see it until after his brother&#x27;s death.

==Personal life==
John Harvey Kellogg married Ella Ervilla Eaton of Alfred Center, New York, on February 22, 1879. The couple maintained separate bedrooms and did not have any biological children. However, they were foster parents to 42 children, legally adopting 8 of them, before Ella died in 1920. The adopted children included Agnes Grace, Elizabeth Ella, Harriett Eleanor, John William, Ivaline Maud, Paul Alfred, Robert Mofatt, and Newell Carey.

==Death==

Kellogg died on December 14, 1943, in Battle Creek, Michigan. He was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Battle Creek. In his will, Kellogg left his entire estate to the Race Betterment Foundation.

==In popular culture==
British actor Anthony Hopkins plays a highly fictionalized Dr. J.H. Kellogg in the American 1994 film &quot;The Road to Wellville&quot; by Alan Parker. This film depicts the fire of the sanitarium building complex, and ends with Dr. Kellogg, years after, dying of a heart attack while diving from a high board.

=== Misconceptions ===
Several popular misconceptions falsely attribute various cultural practices, inventions, and historical events to Kellogg. These include false claims that Kellogg&#x27;s corn flakes were invented or marketed to prevent masturbation. In reality, they were promoted to prevent indigestion. Another common misconception credits Kellogg with popularizing routine infant circumcision in the United States and broader Anglosphere. This is incorrect, although Kellogg did advocate circumcision, without anaesthetic, as an eficacious cure for masturbation. He wrote in &quot;Plain facts for old and young&quot; that &quot;Eminent physicians have expressed the opinion that the practice would be a salutary one for all men.&quot; However in later editions, Kellogg came to criticize this growing belief among medical professionals, arguing that routine circumcision provided doubtful medical benefit, citing iatrogenically created meatal stenosis among the Jewish male population:

<doc id="490272" wikidata="Q580268" url="?curid=490272" title="Athlete (band)">
<text>Athlete were an English indie rock band formed in Deptford, London, comprising Joel Pott (lead vocals and guitar), Carey Willetts (bass and backing vocals), Stephen Roberts (drums and backing vocals), Tim Wanstall (keyboards).

The band had a brief period of high-profile domestic success in which their debut album &quot;Vehicles &amp; Animals&quot; (2003) was a platinum seller in 2005 and Mercury Music Prize nomination. It was followed up by &quot;Tourist&quot; (2005) which reached No. 1 and sold over 500,000 copies allowing this album to also go platinum. Athlete&#x27;s subsequent two albums, &quot;Beyond the Neighbourhood&quot; (2007) and &quot;Black Swan&quot; (2009), saw the band exploring different styles, influenced by the works of artists such as Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds.

The band has been on hiatus since anniversary tours in 2012 and 2013. Joel Pott has been working since then as songwriter and producer for other artists. Carey Willets released a solo album in 2012, called &quot;Stickers&quot; and has another project called &quot;Boxes&quot;. Stephen Roberts and Tim Wanstall have been working on production with other bands. In 2011, Stephen Roberts stated that they set aside plans for a fifth record, have no plans to make a new album, and are exploring different careers. Since then, they have been relatively quiet.

== History ==
=== Debut releases and development (2000–2002) ===
Friends since the age of fourteen, Athlete took their wide ranging influences such as Grandaddy and The Flaming Lips and started jamming and practising in the basement of The Bear, a pub which was converted into a church and sandwich bar, on Deptford High Street in 1999. They began recording there, before sending demos out.

Signing with Regal Recordings, the band released their first single &quot;Westside&quot; in February 2002, which was a hit, garnering airplay on BBC Radio 1 and paving the way for another single, &quot;You Got the Style&quot; which cracked the Top 40 in June. Parlophone took notice and promptly signed the musicians, who entered the studio with producer Victor Van Vugt (Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds, Beth Orton) in late 2002 to record their first studio LP.

=== Commercial success, but mixed critical reception (2003–2006) ===
The band came to prominence in 2003 with their debut album, &quot;Vehicles and Animals&quot;, producing popular singles such as &quot;You Got the Style&quot; and &quot;El Salvador&quot;. The album earned a Mercury Music Prize nomination and went on to sell over 250,000 copies. They played their first live session on UK radio on the &quot;Dermot O&#x27;Leary Show&quot; on BBC Radio 2. Following the release of the album in April 2003, the summer of that year was a particularly fruitful time. Shortly after Glastonbury and T in The Park festivals, the band were nominated for the Mercury Award. After nomination, the album went from silver (60,000 sales) to gold (100,000) in the space of two weeks. &quot;I think there&#x27;s an underdog waiting to be discovered by the Mercury every year,&quot; said Steve. &quot;And that year it was us.&quot; &quot;By the time we played V at the end of the summer it seemed like everybody there knew the record,&#x27; said Joel Pott, &#x27;There was 20,000 people, all singing along.&#x27;

Their second album, &quot;Tourist&quot;, reached Number One in the UK Album Charts in its first week, following the huge success of single &quot;Wires&quot;. The song was written about Pott&#x27;s newborn baby who was rushed to intensive care after a premature birth, and in 2006 it won them the Ivor Novello Award for &quot;Best Contemporary Song&quot;. In the UK charts, the band has frequently been frustrated by singles just missing out on top 40 placings, due to inconsistent support by music television channels and radio stations. For instance, certain songs, such as &quot;Wires&quot; and &quot;Half Light&quot;, were played up to 10 times a day on larger UK radio stations, yet other singles such as &quot;Westside&quot; and &quot;Tourist&quot; received little radio play.

&quot;Tourist&quot; had a mixed critical reception, with some suggesting that Athlete had failed to sustain the unique style of their previous album, while others saw the new album as a logical progression from their old sound. Allmusic wrote that &quot;Its art direction is a winning tribute to the striking cover art of Britpop past, but musically, &quot;Tourist&quot; settles for complacent.&quot; The supporting tour took place between 2005 and mid-2006.

=== Development with subsequent releases (2007–2009) ===
On 10 June 2007, it was announced that the title of their third album would be &quot;Beyond the Neighbourhood&quot;. The album was recorded by the band themselves in their own studio, and mixed by Ben Allen and Michael Brauer, who had worked on &quot;Tourist&quot;. Released on 3 September 2007, &quot;Beyond the Neighbourhood&quot; was a self-produced collection of low-key songs, viewed as a disappointment by some, and an interesting sidestep by others. Jonny Pilcher contributed additional guitar on 7 tracks. Pilcher then played live with the band on the subsequent tour. It entered at No. 5 on the UK album chart. Singles included Beach Boys-influenced &quot;Hurricane&quot;, charting disappointingly at number 31, also &quot;Tokyo&quot; which missed the Top 100 (number 198) and &quot;The Outsiders EP&quot;, which did not chart at all.

They embarked on tours of the UK in late 2007 and early 2008 in support of the album. They also played during the 2008 TT motorcycle racing festival on the Isle of Man.

&quot;Black Swan&quot; is the fourth studio album produced by the band. Athlete recorded this album while temporarily unsigned. American producer Tom Rothrock collaborated with the group long distance after hearing only a few acoustic demos. In April they announced a 29 date tour of the UK to promote their new album. The tour took place throughout June and July. On 2 June 2009 it was announced that the band had parted ways with Parlophone Records and signed up with Fiction Records, who released &quot;Black Swan&quot; on 24 August 2009. The first single from the album &quot;Superhuman Touch&quot; was released on 17 August 2009, entering the UK charts at No. 74, climbing to No. 71 a week later. On 12 June 2009, Athlete released the song &quot;Summer Sun&quot; as a free download for email-subscribers. The song is not included in the track listing confirmed by band member Carey Willetts, and is likely to be considered as a b-side from the upcoming album. The first single to be released in America is &quot;The Getaway&quot;. On 9 November 2009, Athlete released &quot;Black Swan Song&quot; as a single.

=== Compilation releases, touring and split (2010–2013) ===
&quot;Singles 1–10&quot; was the first compilation album released by the band. Many of the bands big hits, including &quot;El Salvador&quot; and &quot;Wires&quot; appear on this album. The selection of tracks spans the past 10 years. There is one previously unreleased song on the album entitled &quot;Back Track.&quot; After the release Athlete completed a tour of Britain, Europe and North America from March till December 2010, performing the hits from the non-bonus edition. The band toured in July across Britain, and in August headlined Union Chapel, and also took the stage at Bingley Music Live and Brownstock Festival in 3 and 4 September 2011.

In 2011 the band toured some of their biggest songs, but in a &quot;stripped back&quot; fashion. The idea was that the band took some of their songs and reworked them completely to be played in an acoustic style. The tour came around after the band played a small gig at London&#x27;s Canary Wharf. After the gig was highly successful, they announced the tour which included 18 dates across the U.K with two dates at London&#x27;s Union Chapel. The second of which was recorded for a live album &quot;Live at Union Chapel&quot; released early in 2012. The album has 12 songs including the singles &quot;Wires&quot; and &quot;Half Light&quot; and includes the band talking to the audience between songs. This was Athlete&#x27;s fourth live EP after two iTunes Festival EPs and the &quot;Tokyo EP&quot; recorded at Camden Koko.

In a September 2011 interview, keyboardist Tim Wanstall said &quot;it&#x27;s been every two years (releasing an album) on the odd numbers since 2003 so this is the first year to break that cycle. Actually we&#x27;re all exploring individual paths at the moment so the if/how/when of another album is a pretty open book.&quot; In 2012 the band performed at several festivals including Hop Farm Festival, Shindig Festival and Lakefest. In May 2013, the band embarked on &quot;Vehicles &amp; Animals&quot; 10th Anniversary Tour, with dates at Bristol Academy, Cambridge Junction and Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire.

Since this tour, the band became dormant and later split. Pott turned to songwriting and production duties for other artists, forging working relationship with George Ezra, co-writing and producing his first two studio albums: &quot;Wanted on Voyage&quot; (2014) and &quot;Staying at Tamara&#x27;s&quot; (2018), as well as co-writing Shura&#x27;s debut effort &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Real&quot; (2016). He referred to his time in the band in the past tense in a 2015 interview with M Magazine. Stephen Roberts and Tim Wanstall have been working on production with other bands. Carey Willets released his first solo album in 2012, called &quot;Stickers&quot;, while also working on production and on a project called &quot;Boxes&quot;.

<doc id="490278" wikidata="Q382331" url="?curid=490278" title="Monkey's fist">
<text>A monkey&#x27;s fist or monkey paw is a type of knot, so named because it looks somewhat like a small bunched fist or paw. It is tied at the end of a rope to serve as a weight, making it easier to throw, and also as an ornamental knot. This type of weighted rope can be used as a hand-to-hand weapon, called a slungshot by sailors. It was also used in the past as an anchor in rock climbing, by stuffing it into a crack. It is still sometimes used today in sandstone, as in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains in Germany.

==Description==

The monkey&#x27;s fist knot is most often used as the weight in a heaving line. The line would have the monkey&#x27;s fist on one end, an eye splice or bowline on the other, with about 30 feet (~10 metres) of line between. A lightweight feeder line would be tied to the bowline, then the weighted heaving line could be hurled between ship and dock. The other end of the lightweight line would be attached to a heavier-weight line, allowing it to be drawn to the target easily.

The knot is often tied around a small weight, such as a stone, marble, tight fold of paper, grapeshot, or a piece of wood. However, this may be considered unsafe and therefore poor seamanship.
The UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency&#x27;s (MCA) publication &quot;Code of Safe Working Practices for Merchant Seamen&quot;, Section 25.3.2, states that &quot;heaving lines should be constructed with a &#x27;monkey’s fist&#x27; at one end. To prevent personal injury, the &#x27;fist&#x27; should be made only with rope and should not contain added weighting materials&quot;.
==Tying==
The three coils of cordage in a monkey&#x27;s fist form in effect a set of Borromean rings in three dimensions. This is most obvious when tied flat. The rings should then be started near center, coiled from outside inwards, in all three set of rings, and the third set finished by letting the end exit through the triangular hole at the center. Subsequent tightening should let the outside edges curl to form an opposing triangular hole around the main part. This is suitable if a ring formed object is to be contained in the central cavity around the main part. If the object has no hole, it might be desirable to have the ends exit the knot at or near the central triangular hole.


== Other applications ==
A monkey&#x27;s fist can be used on two ends of a tow lines of one side a fish net which is then thrown from one trawler to another, allowing the net to be cast and set between two boats so the trawl can be used between the two, in pair trawling where the tow or catch is negotiated between both parties. This makes it easier to catch fish given the greater surface area between both boats to turn around and catch missed fish from the sea much more quickly. Once all fish have been hauled up from the sea, tow lines of the fish net is returned by way of thrown both monkey&#x27;s fists back to the host trawler. Alternatively, a monkey fist can be used as a weight of a heaving line thrown to over to an opposing ship to bring two ships together.

Monkey&#x27;s fists are commonly used as a convenient and unobtrusive method of storing and transporting precious gemstones.

A throwing monkey&#x27;s fist can be created by tying around a heavy material such as iron ball, or stone. A floating monkey&#x27;s fist can be created by tying around a buoyant material such as cork, styrofoam, air filled ring or ball.

It is also the most common knot used in a pair for cufflinks where it is considered a &quot;silk knot.&quot;

Monkey fists have become popular as main deployment handles for sport parachute systems.

Monkey fists are often used in modern begleri as they are gentler on the knuckles than metal beads.

Monkey fists are often used in shibari and bondage, tied partway down the rope to be used as a gag.

<doc id="490284" wikidata="Q157242" url="?curid=490284" title="Alec Todd">
<text>Alexander Robertus Todd, Baron Todd (2 October 1907 – 10 January 1997) was a British biochemist whose research on the structure and synthesis of nucleotides, nucleosides, and nucleotide coenzymes gained him the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1957.

==Early life and education==
Todd was born at Cathcart in outer Glasgow, the elder son of Alexander Todd, JP, a clerk with the Glasgow Subway, and his wife, Jane Lowry.

He attended Allan Glen&#x27;s School and graduated from the University of Glasgow with a bachelor&#x27;s degree (BSc) in 1928. He received a doctorate (Dr Phil.nat.) from Goethe University Frankfurt in 1931 for his thesis on the chemistry of the bile acids.

Todd was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and, after studying at Oriel College, Oxford, he received another doctorate (DPhil) in 1933.

==Career==
Todd held posts with the Lister Institute, the University of Edinburgh (staff, 1934–1936) and the University of London, where he was appointed Reader in biochemistry.

In 1938, Alexander Todd spent six months as a visiting professor at California Institute of Technology, eventually declining an offer of faculty position. Todd became the Sir Samuel Hall Chair of Chemistry and director of the Chemical Laboratories of the University of Manchester in 1938, where he began working on nucleosides, compounds that form the structural units of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA).

In 1944, he was appointed to the 1702 Chair of Chemistry in the University of Cambridge, which he held until his retirement in 1971. In 1949, he synthesised adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Todd served as a visiting professor at the University of Chicago in Autumn 1948 and University of Sydney in 1950.

In 1955, he helped elucidate the structure of vitamin B12, although the final formula and definite structure was determined by Dorothy Hodgkin and her team, and later worked on the structure and synthesis of vitamin B1 and vitamin E, the anthocyanins (the pigments of flowers and fruits) from insects (aphids, beetles) and studied alkaloids found in cannabis. He served as chairman of the Government of the United Kingdom&#x27;s advisory committee on scientific policy from 1952 to 1964.

He is credited as the first person to synthesize H4-CBD and H2-CBD from Cannabidiol by hydrogenation as early as 1940.

He received the 1957 Nobel Prize in Chemistry “for his work on nucleotides and nucleotide co-enzymes.”

Elected a Fellow of Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1944, he served as Master from 1963 to 1978. Lord Todd became the first Chancellor of the new University of Strathclyde in 1965, and a visiting professor at Hatfield Polytechnic (1978–1986). Among his many honours, including over 40 honorary degrees, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1942, a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1955, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957, and the American Philosophical Society in 1965. President of the Royal Society from 1975 to 1980, The Queen awarded him the Order of Merit in 1977.

In 1981, Todd became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.

==Personal life and death==

In 1937, Todd married Alison Sarah Dale (d. 1987), daughter of Nobel Prize winner Henry Hallett Dale, who like Todd, served as President of the Royal Society of London. They had a son and two daughters:

* Alexander Henry Todd (b. 1939), educated at Oriel College, Oxford, Master Salters&#x27; Company (1999/2000), m. 1stly 1967 (div 1981) Joan Margaret Koester, m. 2ndly Patricia Mary Harvey Jones, daughter of Brigadier Alan Harvey Jones , of Somerford Booths, Cheshire;
* Helen Jean Todd (b. 1941), m. 1963 Philip Edgar Brown, and has two sons and a daughter;
* Hilary Alison Todd (b. 1946).

Todd died in Cambridge on 10 January 1997 at the age of 89 following a heart attack.

==Honours==
Todd was honoured as a Nieuwland Lecturer at the University of Notre Dame in 1948, an Arthur D. Little Visiting Professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1954, and a Hitchcock Lecturer at University of California, Berkeley, in 1957.

Knighted as Sir Alexander Todd in 1954 he was elevated as a Life Peer on 16 April 1962, being created Baron Todd of Trumpington in the County of Cambridge.

Lord Todd, Master of the Worshipful Company of Salters (1961/62) and then Master of Christ&#x27;s College (1963–78), is commemorated by a blue plaque erected by the Royal Society of Chemistry at the Department of Chemistry in the University of Cambridge.

<doc id="490286" wikidata="Q737768" url="?curid=490286" title="Anne Hébert">
<text>Anne Hébert (pronounced in French) (August 1, 1916 – January 22, 2000), was a Canadian author and poet. She won Canada&#x27;s top literary honor, the Governor General&#x27;s Award, three times, twice for fiction and once for poetry.

==Early life==
Hébert was born in Sainte-Catherine-de-Fossambault (name later changed to Sainte-Catherine-de-Portneuf, and in 1984 to Sainte-Catherine-de-la-Jacques-Cartier), Quebec. Her father, Maurice Hébert, was a poet and literary critic. She was a cousin and childhood friend of modernist poet Hector de Saint-Denys Garneau. She began writing poems and stories at a young age.

==Career==
By the time she was in her early twenties, Hébert&#x27;s work had been published in a number of periodicals. Her first collection of poems, &quot;Les Songes en Équilibre&quot;, was published in 1942. In it she writes of herself as existing in solitude in a &quot;dreamlike torpor&quot;. It received positive reviews and won her the Prix David.

Saddened by the 1943 death of her thirty-one-year-old cousin, Hector de Saint-Denys Garneau, and by the death of her only sister Marie in 1952, Hébert&#x27;s poetry became filled with images of death and drowning.&quot;
No Quebec publisher would publish her 1945 collection of stories, &quot;Le Torrent&quot;. It was finally published in 1950 at the expense of Roger Lemelin. The provocative tales were considered shocking at the time, but later grew in popularity.

Hébert was affiliated with Canada&#x27;s first film bureau. She worked for Radio Canada, Film Board of Canada and National Film Board of Canada during the 1950s.

Again, she could not find a publisher for her second book of anguish-filled poetry, &quot;Le Tombeau des rois&quot; (The Tomb of Kings), and had to publish it at her own expense in 1953. In 1954 Hébert used a grant from the Royal Society of Canada to move to Paris, thinking that the city would be more receptive to her writing.

&quot;Les Chambres de bois&quot; (1958), her first novel, was a passionate story which depicted violence and brutality through evocative imagery. Hébert was one of the first Québécois writers to experiment in her work with the expression of alienation and rebellion, rather than realistic narration and discussion.&quot;

In 1960 during Québec&#x27;s Quiet Revolution, Hébert published &quot;Mystère de la parole&quot;, a new collection of poems about more down-to-earth subjects than her previous work.

Hébert&#x27;s 1970 novel &quot;Kamouraska&quot; combines two romantic yet suspenseful stories and is set in 19th-century Québec.

Hébert returned to Canada in the 1990s. Her last novel &quot;Un Habit de lumière&quot; was published in 1998.

Hébert died of bone cancer on January 22, 2000, in Montreal.

==Recognition==
Hébert&#x27;s first book of poetry, &quot;Les Songes en Équilibre&quot;, won Quebec&#x27;s Prix David. She won the Prix France-Canada and the Ludger-Duvernay Prize in 1958 for &quot;Les chambres de bois&quot;.

Hébert was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1960.

Her &quot;Poèmes&quot; (a reprinting of &quot;Le Tombeau des rois&quot;, coupled with a section of new poems, &quot;Mystère de la parole&quot;) won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for poetry in 1960. She twice won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for fiction, for her novels &quot;Les enfants du sabbat&quot; (1975) and &quot;L&#x27;enfant chargé des songes&quot; (1992).

She won the Molson Prize in 1967.

Hébert won France&#x27;s Prix de librairies for her 1970 novel &quot;Kamouraska&quot; and its Prix Femina for her 1982 novel &quot;Les fous de Bassan&quot;. Both books have also been made into movies, &quot;Kamouraska&quot; in 1973 directed by Claude Jutra, and &quot;Les fous de Bassan&quot; in 1986 by Yves Simoneau. &quot;Kamouraska&quot; also won the Grand Prix of the Académie royale de la langue françaises de Belgique.

Hébert&#x27;s work has been translated into at least seven languages, including English, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish. &quot;The First Garden,&quot; the English translation of &quot;Le premier jardin&quot;, won the Félix Antoine-Savard Prize for Translation in 1991,

L&#x27;école Anne-Hébert, opened in Vancouver in 1983, is an elementary school that offers instruction from kindergarten through grade 6 in French only.

In 2013, documentary filmmaker Michel Langlois released &quot;Anne des vingt jours&quot;, a biographical documentary about Hébert.

===Commemorative postage stamp===
On September 8, 2003, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the National Library of Canada, Canada Post released a special commemorative series, &quot;The Writers of Canada&quot;, with a design by Katalina Kovats, featuring two English-Canadian and two French-Canadian stamps. Three million stamps were issued. The two French-Canadian authors used were Hébert and her cousin, Hector de Saint-Denys Garneau.

<text>The Roue de Paris is a tall transportable Ferris wheel, originally installed on the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France, for the 2000 millennium celebrations. It left Paris in 2002 and has since then seen service at numerous other locations around the world.

It is a Ronald Bussink series R60 wheel and needs no permanent foundations, instead (40 tonnes) of water ballast provide a stable base. It weighs 365 tonnes.

Due to its transportable design, it can be erected in 72 hours and dismantled in 60 hours by a specialist team. Transport requires seven container lorries, ten open trailer lorries, and one closed trailer lorry.

The forty-two gondolas can be loaded either three or six at a time, and each can accommodate eight passengers.

==Installations==

<text>A swing bridge (or swing span bridge) is a movable bridge that can be rotated horizontally around a vertical axis. It has as its primary structural support a vertical locating pin and support ring, usually at or near to its center of gravity, about which the swing span (turning span) can then pivot horizontally as shown in the animated illustration to the right. 

In its closed position, a swing bridge carrying a road or railway over a river or canal, for example, allows traffic to cross. When a water vessel needs to pass the bridge, road traffic is stopped (usually by traffic signals and barriers), and then motors rotate the bridge horizontally about its pivot point. The typical swing bridge will rotate approximately 90 degrees, or one-quarter turn; however, a bridge which intersects the navigation channel at an oblique angle may be built to rotate only 45 degrees, or one-eighth turn, in order to clear the channel. Small swing bridges as found over narrow canals may be pivoted only at one end, opening as would a gate, but require substantial underground structure to support the pivot.

==Advantages==

* As this type requires no counterweights, the complete weight is significantly reduced as compared to other moveable bridges.
* Where the channel is wide enough for separate traffic directions on each side, the likelihood of vessel-to-vessel collisions is reduced.
* The central support is often mounted upon a berm along the axis of the watercourse, intended to protect the bridge from watercraft collisions when it is opened. This artificial island forms an excellent construction area for building the moveable span, as the construction will not impede traffic.

==Disadvantages==

* In a symmetrical bridge, the central pier forms a hazard to navigation. Asymmetrical bridges may place the pivot near one side of the channel.
* Where a wide channel is not available, a large portion of the bridge may be over an area that would be easily spanned by other means.
* A wide channel will be reduced by the center pivot and foundation.
* When open, the bridge will have to maintain its own weight as a balanced double cantilever, while when closed and in use for traffic, the live loads will be distributed as in a pair of conventional truss bridges, which may require additional stiffness in some members whose loading will be alternately in compression and tension.
* If struck from the water near the edge of the span, it may rotate enough to cause safety problems (see Big Bayou Canot rail accident).

==Examples==

<text>The Morgan Bible (mostly Morgan Library &amp; Museum, New York, Ms M. 638), also called the Morgan Picture Bible, Crusader Bible, Shah Abbas Bible or Maciejowski Bible, is a unique medieval illuminated manuscript. It is a picture book Bible consisting of 46 surviving folios. The book consists of miniature paintings of events from the Hebrew Bible, set in the scenery and costumes of thirteenth-century France, and depicted from a Christian perspective. It is not a complete Bible, as it consists largely of illustrations of stories of kings, especially King David. The illustrations are now surrounded by text in three scripts and five languages: Latin, Persian, Arabic, Judeo-Persian, and Hebrew. The level of detail in the images and the remarkable state of preservation of the work make it particularly valuable to scholars.

Forty-three folios are in the Morgan Library &amp; Museum in New York City, with two folios in the Bibliothèque nationale de France (MS nouv. acq. lat. 2294). A single folio is now in the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles (MS 16). Two folios are thought to be missing from the original work.

== Description ==
The Morgan Bible is part of Morgan Library &amp; Museum in New York (Ms M. 638). It is a medieval picture Bible. The Morgan Bible originally contained 48 folios; of these, 43 still reside in the Morgan Museum, two are in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris, one is in the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, and two have been lost. The cover that once bound the manuscript has also been lost over time. The surviving leaves measure at 32.5 × 29.1 cm (12 13/16 × 11 7/16 in.) In full, the manuscript contained over 380 scenes. It was the work of at least six different artists. The book consists of paintings of events from Hebrew scripture but are given a setting in the customs and costumes of thirteenth-century France, concentrating on stories of kings, especially David.

The Morgan Bible is not a complete Bible. It includes portions of &quot;Genesis, Exodus, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, and Samuel&quot; with a particular emphasis on early Israelite heroes who are presented as models of kingship to learn from.

Originally, the Bible contained only miniatures, organized in a consistent visual rhythm from page to page. Within 100 years, the book acquired marginal inscriptions in Latin describing the scenes illustrated. Cardinal Bernard Maciejowski, Bishop of Kraków, had the book given as a gift to Abbas I of Persia in 1608. Abbas ordered inscriptions in Persian to be added, mostly translating the Latin ones already there. Later, in the eighteenth century, inscriptions were added in Judeo-Persian. The Latin text allowed art historians to identify the subjects of the miniatures.

The manuscript is of particular interest to scholars because of the quality and preservation of the illuminations. The level of detail included, from architecture to siege engines to haircuts, provides historians with valuable clues as to what life was like at the time, while the stylistic changes and subtle variations in the story-lines give some insight into one of the most powerful men in Europe.

== Provenance ==

The book has traditionally been thought to have been created in Paris in the mid-1240s for Louis IX of France. A suggestion by Allison Stones, expanding on conclusions by others such as François Avril, that it was instead illuminated in northern France around 1250 has not won general acceptance.

The modern imagery may have been a political statement because the Franks, especially during the reign of Louis IX, saw themselves as the legitimate heirs of Rome. Under Louis IX, France took a militant position against the enemies of Christendom, taking an active part in the Seventh and Eighth Crusades. The creation of the Morgan Bible falls around the time Louis IX went on his first crusade, and the style of using modern clothes on biblical figures appears in other works he commissioned around this time such as the Sainte-Chapelle chapel in Paris, whose stained glass is in the same style, suggesting they may have been used to legitimize his position at home and among the other crusaders.

After the death of Louis IX, ownership passed to his brother, Charles of Anjou who defeated Naples in 1266 and founded the Angevin Dynasty. While the book was in Italy, Latin text was added.

Ownership up to this point has been based mostly on guesswork and circumstantial evidence. The first recorded owner of the Bible was Cardinal Bernard Maciejowski, who was the Bishop of Cracow, Poland. Maciejowski studied for the priesthood in Italy and likely gained ownership of the manuscript while there.

In 1604, Cardinal Maciejowski gifted the Bible to Shah Abbas through a delegation, as is evidenced by the inscription of folio 1 that reads in Latin (translated by Daniel Weiss): “Bernard Maciejowski, Cardinal Priest of the Holy Roman Church, Bishop of Cracow, Duke of Siewierz, and Senator of the Kingdom of Poland with sincere wishes offers this gift to the supreme King of the Persians at Cracow the mother city of the kingdom of Poland on the seventh of September 1604.” It officially reached the Shah back in Isfahan in 1608. The Shah seemed to enjoy the gift and after having missionaries explain the pictures, he had Persian inscriptions added and added his own seal of ownership on folio 42v.

=== Lost Leaves ===
It appears that at some point during the manuscript&#x27;s travels, several pages were deliberately removed from it. It has been suggested that Shah Abbas tore out these pages, all involving Absalom&#x27;s rebellion, because he thought they might be a bad influence on his young son; however, others suggest that he may have removed them in 1615, as they may have provided a painful reminder of how he executed his son that year for treason.

When the Afghans conquered Isfahan in 1722, the royal library was sacked along with the rest of the city. Little is known of the manuscript&#x27;s whereabouts in the succeeding years, except that a Persian Jew added Judeo-Persian inscriptions to the manuscript, and even commented on and corrected the previous scripts.

The manuscript was not heard of again until 1833, when it was auctioned off by Sotheby&#x27;s, whose records indicate that they purchased it in Cairo. It was sold to London dealers Payne and Foss, who subsequently sold it to manuscript collector Sir Thomas Phillipps, who owned around 60,000 manuscripts before he died. When Phillipps died, his collection went to his daughter, and then to his grandson, who eventually began selling it off in order to pay off debts. Sotheby&#x27;s once again took charge of auctioning the book, eventually selling it to J. P. Morgan in 1910 for £10,000.

<text>Sunbury-on-Thames, known locally as Sunbury, is a town on the north bank of the River Thames in the Borough of Spelthorne, Surrey, England, southwest of central London. Historically part of the county of Middlesex, in 1965 Sunbury and other surrounding towns were initially intended to form part of the newly created county of Greater London, but were instead transferred to Surrey. Sunbury adjoins Feltham to the north, Hampton to the east, Ashford to the northwest and Shepperton to the southwest. Walton-on-Thames is to the south, on the opposite bank of the Thames.

The town has two main focal points: Lower Sunbury (known locally as Sunbury Village), adjoining the river. Sunbury Common (known locally as Sunbury Cross) is to the north and surrounds the railway station and the London end of the M3 motorway. Lower Sunbury contains most of the town&#x27;s parks, pubs and listed buildings, whereas Sunbury Common is more urban and includes offices and hotels. Lower Sunbury holds an annual fair and regatta each August.

Sunbury railway station is on the Shepperton branch line. Trains to and from London Waterloo are operated by South Western Railway.

==History==

The earliest evidence of human settlement in Sunbury has been the discovery of Bronze Age funerary urns dating from the 10th century BCE in Green Lane, Sunbury Common. There is an important scheduled monument by Rooksmead Road, a prehistoric bowl barrow, known as Cloven Barrow, on low-lying ground that was part of the flood plain of the Thames, now around 1 km to the south. It has a circular mound approximately 14 m in diameter and 2.5 m high, surrounded by a ditch from which material used to build it was excavated. The ditch has become infilled over the years and survives as a buried feature up to 2 m wide. The monument has been partly disturbed by modern gardening activities, and by the construction of a greenhouse on its western side. Cloven Barrow (Old English &quot;Clofenan Beorh&quot;, or the &#x27;barrow with a cleft&#x27;) was mentioned in an Anglo-Saxon document, known as the &quot;Sunbury Charter&quot;, which has been dated to around AD 962.

Many years later the arrival of Huguenot refugees gave the name to French Street.

The place-name &#x27;Sunbury&#x27; is first attested in one of the many Anglo-Saxon charters, one of to 962, where it appears as &quot;Sunnanbyrg&quot;. Another charter of 962 lists it as &quot;Sunnanbyrig&quot;. Sunbury appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Sunneberie&quot;. The name means &#x27;Sunna&#x27;s burgh or fortification&#x27;. The same first name is found in Sonning in Berkshire.

Sunbury&#x27;s Domesday assets were: seven hides. It had five ploughs, meadow for six ploughs, and cattle pasture. It had about 22 households, including one priest and included the manor of Kempton, Kynaston, Chennes[-ton]/[-tone], Kenton or Kenyngton, listed separately. The manor rendered £6 per year to its feudal system overlords. That of Kempton rendered £4.

Lower Sunbury presented for two centuries a mainly rural and quite gentrified village as still visible in many conserved buildings and structures, see Landmarks. Of particular note are the wealth and community tie of its parish church as well as many ornate and unusual houses and mansions (or mansion remains). The oldest and most extravagant homes are those from the Georgian era: throughout and for three decades after the 18th century, the time when the body of Sunbury&#x27;s oldest church dates to – many of those on large plots of land have been demolished and subdivided.

 Gilbert White described Sunbury, in &quot;The Natural History of Selborne&quot;, letter , 4 November 1767 as &quot;one of those pleasant villages lying on the Thames, near Hampton Court&quot;.

In 1889 a group of music hall stars met in the Magpie Hotel in Lower Sunbury to form the Grand Order of Water Rats. The pub-restaurant it has become was named after the horse that one of the entertainers owned, whilst the Grand Order was named because Magpie – a trotting pony owned by Richard Thornton, music hall owner – had been described as a drowned water rat. The &quot;Three Fishes&quot; in Green Street is one of the oldest pubs in Surrey, an officially protected building of the late 16th century.

In the twentieth century, kennels near Sunbury Cross in the town were used for keeping greyhounds for racing at the former stadia at Wandsworth, Charlton and Park Royal.

Sunbury-on-Thames is historically in Middlesex. Under the Local Government Act 1888 county councils were established the following year, with Sunbury governed by the new Middlesex County Council. This was further refined by the creation of Sunbury-on-Thames Urban District in 1894. In 1965, all but three districts of Middlesex were absorbed into Greater London; Sunbury was one of these exceptions. The area of Sunbury&#x27;s Urban District has since been in the county of Surrey as to its upper tier of local government. Royal Mail ignored the change in 1965 and the former postal county is Middlesex. Mention of any county in postal addresses is considered dated but widely practised in some areas. In 1974 the urban district was abolished and it has since formed part of the borough of Spelthorne.

==Topography and localities==


Sunbury is a post town that is in part north and south of the M3, varying from 14 to 9m AOD with a term for each part.

===Lower Sunbury===
Lower Sunbury, , locally known as &#x27;Sunbury village&#x27;, bordering the Thames and M3, is just over half of the town forming an almost entirely green-buffered residential suburb which includes eight schools: including three of the six secondary schools in the Borough (or of eight including those which are independent). Opposed to London, partially in Shepperton are parts of the Metropolitan Green Belt including four farms, a golf course, riverside horseriding centre at Beasley&#x27;s Ait, the Swan Sanctuary, a rugby training centre and Upper Halliford&#x27;s park. Lower Sunbury has one of the larger NHS medical general practitioner (GP) centres in the Borough. Football, playgrounds and tennis grounds are in both halves of the town with London Irish rugby club being the main organised team in the village. Sunbury Park has dog-walking, cycle paths, parking and is in a cluster with five others including a tree-lined linear park, a modest, sloped riverside park and an adjoining café-served park.

The town has been the home to London Irish since 1932 whose premiership team since 2001 has played at the Madejski Stadium in Reading, Berkshire. Many hundreds of players train at Sunbury during the rugby season. Its eastern border is Kempton Park Racecourse which has on the far side of the town the main area of historic woodland and wildlife preservation, the Kempton Park Reservoirs SSSI which blends into the park&#x27;s own ponds, woods, Portman Brook and additional channels in the Green Belt.

The neighbourhood has a tapestry known as the Millennium Embroidery which was conceived and designed in the 1990s and completed in 2000. Since July 2006 its permanent home is the purpose-built Sunbury Millennium Embroidery Gallery, in a well-tended, free-to-visit Walled Garden adjoining Sunbury Park. The opening of a café within the gallery building, which architecturally resembles a boat, has increased the leisure time spent in the predominantly Georgian and early Victorian conservation area, the majority of which runs along Thames Street, a small section of which King&#x27;s Lawn is a terraced public riverside. Fishing is permitted here for those with two Environment Agency licences. The Walled Garden hosts annual concerts, flower displays, events related to its facing Millennium Embroidery Café and occasionally plays in summer. Three public pools attract swimmers: Nuffield Health; You Fit (next to the Shepperton border); and Everyone Active&#x27;s Sunbury Leisure Centre.

In July of each year, Lower Sunbury is the start of the colourful traditional ceremony of Swan Upping, where two livery companies carry out marking of the swans on all upper reaches of the River Thames. In August, the traditional Sunbury Amateur Regatta takes place on the stretch of the river around Rivermead Island.

Lower Sunbury has similar property plot sizes to Shepperton and house prices as Hampton. Most property is 1930s–1960s semi-detached or detached houses with gardens on verge or tree-lined roads. The railway here benefits from seating at peak times but gives lower speed of access to the City of London relative to the South West Main Line developments of Elmbridge. Wide roads and parking provide strengths of the borough. The largest plots of garden measure only around an acre not covering any of the grassy plain, western outlying farms or boundary-lining trees in the far east and west. Lower Sunbury has numerous pubs, independent restaurants. A dog-free meadow permitting informal cricket and football is near the main parade of shops at which annual carols are held and at the regatta time in August a celebratory street market takes place.

===Sunbury Common===
&lt;br&gt;

The northern section is &quot;Sunbury Common&quot;, patches of which remain, commanded by its four tower blocks and two hotels, overall with a mixed-use urban composition; it also houses major employers including offices of Siemens, European Asbestos Solutions, Chubb and BP. The M3, with its inaugural junction at Sunbury Cross, sections off Lower Sunbury. Sunbury Common has a long, curved shopping parade that includes Marks &amp; Spencer, Halfords, Farmfoods supermarket, Costa and Boots as well as beauty and nail salons. Also in this area, set off the main road is a Tesco Extra.
North and east of the area is part of the green belt: a small farm and larger natural brookland habitat with most of this area being in the adjoining London Borough of Hounslow and before the early 19th century part of distant Hanworth Park, historically part of Hounslow Heath. Its wild flower meadows, brooks and human-made troughs with wetland plants and insects form the Kempton Park Reservoirs SSSI. The operational Kempton Reservoirs and roads passing into Hampton form the rest of the town&#x27;s eastern border, a buffer further south.
Sunbury here has five or six high rise tower blocks: 3 residential including the newly converted chubb building; and two hotels. Similarly it has industrial/business parks clustered generally in the acute angles between the M3/A316 (Country Way) and the A308 (Staines Road West). BP&#x27;s Engineering and Research Centre in the north replaced Meadhurst House and gardens occupied by the Cadbury family and has evolved into BP&#x27;s international centre for business and technology across a number of landscaped units. A number of other major companies have premises.

Marking the western border of the Upper Halliford/Charlton parts of Sunbury ecclesiastical and historic parish, however no longer by the town, is the Queen Mary Reservoir which was constructed 1914–25 and is home to a sailing club regularly used by schools and youth organisations to teach water sports.

==Landmarks==
===Anglican church===
St Mary&#x27;s Church was built originally in the medieval period, to which its foundations date. It was entirely rebuilt in 1752, designed by Stephen Wright (Clerk of Works to Hampton Court Palace); it has a tall apsidal (dome-like) chancel with a south chapel and western extensions to aisles added in extensive remodelling designed by architect Samuel Sanders Teulon in 1857. A solitary central monument in the church itself is to Lady Jane Coke (died 1761), stained glass and a vestry much extended in the early 20th century. It is a listed building in the mid-category, Grade II*.

===Sunbury Court===
Sunbury Court in Lower Sunbury (b.1723) is the home of the high council of The Salvation Army since 1925.

===Hawke House===
Sunbury has the main home, Hawke House, of Admiral Hawke who blockaded Rochefort in 1757 and in 1758 he directed the blockade of Brest for six months. Its three parts are Georgian buildings with small gardens to front and rear. The vast bulk of the land behind and across the road belonging to the house was re-planned in stages in the mid 20th century as private detached homes with gardens.

===Millennium Embroidery===
Its own modernist gallery contains the wall-dominating commissioned artwork, a substantial tapestry, that commemorates Sunbury&#x27;s ascension to the third millennium. It was designed by John Stamp and David Brown to be a large patchwork of Sunbury landmarks, including St. Mary&#x27;s Church, the Admiral Hawke/Hawke House and the river. The finished piece is actually composed of several embroideries, the largest of which measures . It took four years to complete and enlisted the help of over 140 volunteers and artists. Queen Elizabeth II visited the Embroidery in 2001 and the gallery built for it in 2006.

===Wheatley&#x27;s Ait===

This residential island of Sunbury is one of the longest on the River Thames and is divided into two sections by a storm weir. It is connected by a wide footbridge. The main weir, maintained and owned by the Environment Agency, connects the downstream end of the island to Sunbury Lock Ait, which is almost uninhabited, and is within the modern parish bounds of Walton and has the Middle Thames Yachting and Motorboat Club.

===Sunbury Court Island===

Sunbury Court Island, as with most of Sunbury&#x27;s riverside, privately owned, is another residential island, connected by a narrow arched footbridge well above river level.

===Sunbury House===
An abortive proposal for this western part of the manor was designed by Sir Christopher Wren to be the local army barracks but not built. Sunbury House was a large building with gardens and allotments covering the rectangle of land between Thames Street, Green Street, Forge Lane and Halliford Road. It was leased in 1855 by the Bishop family, who had owned it since its 1789 commencement of construction for Charles Bishop, HM Procurator General, to Captain Auguste Frederic Lendy, a French officer, who, with the assistance of the exiled French Royal family (living at Orleans House) founded a military academy.

This was a period when military commissions were still bought and sold, and training of officers in the army itself was quite rudimentary, so these establishments existed to teach students the necessary skills before taking up their posts.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1915 the house was largely destroyed by a flood which only the two wings survived. One of these was later demolished, the remaining large west wing becoming a nursing home in two parts: Sunbury House which has not yet been listed and West Lodge almost entirely late 18th century and a building listed in the initial category at Grade II.

==Education==
===State schools===
====Primary schools====
The town has six primary schools:
* Chennestone Primary School

Founded in the 1950s as Manor Lane Primary School. In 1967 the school changed its name to Chennestone to reflect the name of one of four manors in the parish, as spelt in the Domesday Book, when its pronunciation as with &quot;Chent&quot; in that book (Kent) would have been close to Kenyngton, its other form soon after recorded and its eventual form, Kempton.
* Beauclerc Infants School (federated with above)
* Hawkedale Infants School
* Kenyngton Manor School ()
* St Ignatius RC Primary School
* Springfield Primary School

====Secondary schools====

==In literature==
The riverside St Mary&#x27;s Anglican Church and the Ferry House nearby are mentioned in the book &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; by Charles Dickens.

Sunbury&#x27;s islands and the ardour of rowing up Sunbury backwater (weir stream) to access the public riverside are mentioned in &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; by Jerome K. Jerome.

Sunbury is the setting for the 1890 novel &quot;Kit and Kitty&quot; by R. D. Blackmore.

Sunbury is passed through briefly in H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, where it is described to have been partially covered in heavy, inky vapour by the Martians.

Sunbury is mentioned in the opening chapter of &quot;Rural Rides&quot; by farmers&#x27; champion William Cobbett: &quot;All Middlesex is ugly, notwithstanding the millions upon millions which it is continually sucking up from the rest of the kingdom; and though the Thames and its meadows now-and-then are seen from the road, the country is not less ugly from Richmond to Chertsey-bridge, through Twickenham, Hampton, Sunbury and Sheperton [sic], than it is elsewhere. The soil is a gravel at bottom with a black loam at top near the Thames; further back it is a sort of spewy gravel; and, the buildings consist generally of tax-eaters showy, tea-garden-like boxes, and of shabby dwellings of labouring people, who in this part of the country look to be about half Saint Giles&#x27;s: dirty, and have every appearance of drinking gin.&quot; A few years after Cobbett&#x27;s death Thomas Babington wrote in 1843, &quot;An acre in Middlesex is worth a principality in Utopia&quot; which contrasts neatly with its agricultural caricature.

==Notable people==

==Demography and housing==

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the settlement who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

<text>The Basel problem is a problem in mathematical analysis with relevance to number theory, concerning an infinite sum of inverse squares. It was first posed by Pietro Mengoli in 1650 and solved by Leonhard Euler in 1734, and read on 5 December 1735 in &quot;The Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences&quot;. Since the problem had withstood the attacks of the leading mathematicians of the day, Euler&#x27;s solution brought him immediate fame when he was twenty-eight. Euler generalised the problem considerably, and his ideas were taken up more than a century later by Bernhard Riemann in his seminal 1859 paper &quot;On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude&quot;, in which he defined his zeta function and proved its basic properties. The problem is named after the city of Basel, hometown of Euler as well as of the Bernoulli family who unsuccessfully attacked the problem.

The Basel problem asks for the precise summation of the reciprocals of the squares of the natural numbers, i.e. the precise sum of the infinite series:
formula_1

The sum of the series is approximately equal to 1.644934. The Basel problem asks for the &quot;exact&quot; sum of this series (in closed form), as well as a proof that this sum is correct. Euler found the exact sum to be formula_2 and announced this discovery in 1735. His arguments were based on manipulations that were not justified at the time, although he was later proven correct. He produced an accepted proof in 1741.

The solution to this problem can be used to estimate the probability that two large random numbers are coprime. Two random integers in the range from 1 to formula_3, in the limit as formula_3 goes to infinity, are relatively prime with a probability that approaches formula_5, the reciprocal of the solution to the Basel problem.

==Euler&#x27;s approach==
Euler&#x27;s original derivation of the value formula_2 essentially extended observations about finite polynomials and assumed that these same properties hold true for infinite series.

Of course, Euler&#x27;s original reasoning requires justification (100 years later, Karl Weierstrass proved that Euler&#x27;s representation of the sine function as an infinite product is valid, by the Weierstrass factorization theorem), but even without justification, by simply obtaining the correct value, he was able to verify it numerically against partial sums of the series. The agreement he observed gave him sufficient confidence to announce his result to the mathematical community.

To follow Euler&#x27;s argument, recall the Taylor series expansion of the sine function
formula_7
Dividing through by formula_8 gives
formula_9

The Weierstrass factorization theorem shows that the right-hand side is the product of linear factors given by its roots, just as for finite polynomials. Euler assumed this as a heuristic for expanding an infinite degree polynomial in terms of its roots, but in fact it is not always true for general formula_10. This factorization expands the equation into:
formula_11

If we formally multiply out this product and collect all the terms (we are allowed to do so because of Newton&#x27;s identities), we see by induction that the coefficient of is 
formula_12

But from the original infinite series expansion of , the coefficient of is . These two coefficients must be equal; thus,
formula_13

Multiplying both sides of this equation by −2 gives the sum of the reciprocals of the positive square integers.
formula_14

This method of calculating formula_15 is detailed in expository fashion most notably in Havil&#x27;s &quot;Gamma&quot; book which details many zeta function and logarithm-related series and integrals, as well as a historical perspective, related to the Euler gamma constant.

===Generalizations of Euler&#x27;s method using elementary symmetric polynomials===

Using formulae obtained from elementary symmetric polynomials, this same approach can be used to enumerate formulae for the even-indexed even zeta constants which have the following known formula expanded by the Bernoulli numbers:
formula_16

For example, let the partial product for formula_17 expanded as above be defined by formula_18. Then using known formulas for elementary symmetric polynomials (a.k.a., Newton&#x27;s formulas expanded in terms of power sum identities), we can see (for example) that
formula_19

and so on for subsequent coefficients of formula_20. There are other forms of Newton&#x27;s identities expressing the (finite) power sums formula_21 in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials, formula_22 but we can go a more direct route to expressing non-recursive formulas for formula_23 using the method of elementary symmetric polynomials. Namely, we have a recurrence relation between the elementary symmetric polynomials and the power sum polynomials given as on this page by
formula_24

which in our situation equates to the limiting recurrence relation (or generating function convolution, or product) expanded as
formula_25

Then by differentiation and rearrangement of the terms in the previous equation, we obtain that
formula_26

===Consequences of Euler&#x27;s proof===
By the above results, we can conclude that formula_23 is &quot;always&quot; a rational multiple of formula_28. In particular, since formula_29 and integer powers of it are transcendental, we can conclude at this point that formula_23 is irrational, and more precisely, transcendental for all formula_31. By contrast, the properties of the odd-indexed zeta constants, including Apéry&#x27;s constant formula_32, are almost completely unknown.

==The Riemann zeta function ==
The Riemann zeta function is one of the most significant functions in mathematics because of its relationship to the distribution of the prime numbers. The zeta function is defined for any complex number with real part greater than 1 by the following formula:
formula_33

Taking , we see that is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of all positive integers:
formula_34

Convergence can be proven by the integral test, or by the following inequality:
formula_35

This gives us the upper bound 2, and because the infinite sum contains no negative terms, it must converge to a value strictly between 0 and 2. It can be shown that has a simple expression in terms of the Bernoulli numbers whenever is a positive even integer. With :
formula_36

==A proof using Euler&#x27;s formula and L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule==

The normalized sinc function formula_37 has a Weierstrass factorization representation as an infinite product:
formula_38

The infinite product is analytic, so taking the natural logarithm of both sides and differentiating yields
formula_39

(by uniform convergence, the interchange of the derivative and infinite series is permissible). After dividing the equation by formula_40 and regrouping one gets
formula_41

We make a change of variables (formula_42):
formula_43

Euler&#x27;s formula can be used to deduce that
formula_44
or using the corresponding hyperbolic function:
formula_45

Then
formula_46

Now we take the limit as formula_47 approaches zero and use L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule thrice. By Tannery&#x27;s theorem applied to formula_48, we can interchange the limit and infinite series so that formula_49 and by L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule
formula_50

==A proof using Fourier series==

Use Parseval&#x27;s identity (applied to the function ) to obtain
formula_51
where
formula_52

for , and . Thus,
formula_53

and
formula_54

Therefore,
formula_55
as required.

==Another proof using Parseval&#x27;s identity==

Given a complete orthonormal basis in the space formula_56 of L2 periodic functions over formula_57 (i.e., the subspace of square-integrable functions which are also periodic), denoted by formula_58, Parseval&#x27;s identity tells us that
formula_59

where formula_60 is defined in terms of the inner product on this Hilbert space given by
formula_61

We can consider the orthonormal basis on this space defined by formula_62 such that formula_63. Then if we take formula_64, we can compute both that
formula_65

by elementary calculus and integration by parts, respectively. Finally, by Parseval&#x27;s identity stated in the form above, we obtain that
formula_66

===Generalizations and recurrence relations===
Note that by considering higher-order powers of formula_67 we can use integration by parts to extend this method to enumerating formulas for formula_68 when formula_69. In particular, suppose we let
formula_70

so that integration by parts yields the recurrence relation that
formula_71

Then by applying Parseval&#x27;s identity as we did for the first case above along with the linearity of the inner product yields that
formula_72

==Proof using differentiation under the integral sign==

It&#x27;s possible to prove the result using elementary calculus by applying the differentiation under the integral sign technique to an integral due to Freitas:
formula_73

While the primitive function of the integrand cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions, by differentiating with respect to formula_74 we arrive at

formula_75
which can be integrated by substituting formula_76 and decomposing into partial fractions. In the range formula_77 the definite integral reduces to

formula_78

The expression can be simplified using the arctangent addition formula and integrated with respect to formula_74 by means of trigonometric substitution, resulting in

formula_80

The integration constant formula_81 can be determined by noticing that two distinct values of formula_82 are related by

formula_83
because when calculating formula_84 we can factor formula_85 and express it in terms of formula_86 using the logarithm of a power identity and the substitution formula_87. This makes it possible to determine formula_88, and it follows that

formula_89

This final integral can be evaluated by expanding the natural logarithm into its Taylor series:

formula_90

The last two identities imply

formula_91

==Cauchy&#x27;s proof==
While most proofs use results from advanced mathematics, such as Fourier analysis, complex analysis, and multivariable calculus, the following does not even require single-variable calculus (until a single limit is taken at the end).

For a proof using the residue theorem, see here.

===History of this proof===
The proof goes back to Augustin Louis Cauchy (Cours d&#x27;Analyse, 1821, Note VIII). In 1954, this proof appeared in the book of Akiva and Isaak Yaglom &quot;Nonelementary Problems in an Elementary Exposition&quot;. Later, in 1982, it appeared in the journal &quot;Eureka&quot;, attributed to John Scholes, but Scholes claims he learned the proof from Peter Swinnerton-Dyer, and in any case he maintains the proof was &quot;common knowledge at Cambridge in the late 1960s&quot;.

===The proof===

The main idea behind the proof is to bound the partial (finite) sums
formula_92
between two expressions, each of which will tend to as approaches infinity. The two expressions are derived from identities involving the cotangent and cosecant functions. These identities are in turn derived from de Moivre&#x27;s formula, and we now turn to establishing these identities.

Let be a real number with , and let be a positive odd integer. Then from de Moivre&#x27;s formula and the definition of the cotangent function, we have
formula_93

From the binomial theorem, we have
formula_94

Combining the two equations and equating imaginary parts gives the identity
formula_95

We take this identity, fix a positive integer , set , and consider for . Then is a multiple of and therefore . So,
formula_96
where formula_97.

<text>Mervyn Ian Guy Hamilton (16 September 1922 – 20 April 2016) was an English film director. He directed 22 films from the 1950s to the 1980s, including four James Bond films.

==Early life==
Hamilton was born in Paris on 16 September 1922, son of Frederick William Guy Hamilton (1895-1988), press attaché to the British embassy in Paris and Captain in the King&#x27;s Own Royal Lancaster Regiment, and Winifred Grace Culling (1895-1970), daughter of William Archibald Culling Fremantle, of the Church Missionary Society in India. His mother was a great-granddaughter of the Christian campaigner Sir Culling Eardley, 3rd Baronet, and of the politician Thomas Fremantle, 1st Baron Cottesloe. His parents divorced in 1923, and Hamilton attended school in England. His first exposure to the film industry came in 1938, when he was a clapperboard boy at the Victorine Studios in Nice. At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Hamilton escaped from France by the MV &quot;Saltersgate&quot;, a collier bound for French North Africa; one of the other 500 refugees aboard was W. Somerset Maugham. 

Having travelled from Oran to Gibraltar before arriving in London, he worked in the film library at Paramount News before being commissioned in the Royal Navy; he served in the 15th Motor Torpedo Boat 718 Flotilla, a unit that ferried agents into France and brought downed British pilots back to England. 

During this service, he was left behind for a month in occupied Brittany; he was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.

==Career==

===Assistant Director===
After the war Hamilton wanted to get into film production and managed to get a job on a second unit in Dartmoor on a Trevor Heid picture. Then he was put under contract by Alexander Korda as a third assistant director. Over the next few years he worked his way up to a first assistant director.

Hamilton later said, &quot;I found that working with bad directors was infinitely more useful because you watched them get into trouble three times a day and puddle around and you say, you know, I won&#x27;t do that, I don&#x27;t want to fall into that trap.&quot;

He worked on &quot;They Made Me a Fugitive&quot; (1947), &quot;Mine Own Executioner&quot; (1947), &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1948), and &quot;The Fallen Idol&quot; (1949) directed by Carol Reed. &quot;I was devoted to Carol,&quot; said Hamilton later. &quot;He made my life easy because I followed him around like a little dog while learning my trade. If you’d ask him a question, he’d always answer it...Carol Reed was the biggest influence on me and on everything that I did.&quot;

Hamilton assisted on &quot;Britannia Mews&quot; (1949), a 20th Century Fox film shot in England, directed by Jean Negulesco; was reunited with Reed on &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949), in which Hamilton doubled for Orson Welles in a couple of shots; &quot;The Angel with the Trumpet&quot; (1950), &quot;State Secret&quot; (1950) for Sidney Gilliat; &quot;Outcast of the Islands&quot; (1951) for Reed; &quot;The African Queen&quot; (1951) for John Huston; and &quot;Home at Seven&quot; (1952) for Ralph Richardson.

===Early films as director===
Reed suggested to Hamilton that if he wanted to direct he should refuse to re-sign with Korda unless he gave Hamilton a chance to direct. It worked and Korda allocated Hamilton the job of directing the B-movie &quot;The Ringer&quot; (1952).

Hamilton&#x27;s second film as director was &quot;The Intruder&quot; (1953) dealing with soldiers returning to civilian life, produced by Ivan Foxwell. He followed it with an adaptation of &quot;An Inspector Calls&quot; (1954).

Hamilton&#x27;s fourth film was the prisoner-of-war story &quot;The Colditz Story&quot; (1955), which he also co-wrote with producer Foxwell. It was his highest-grossing movie of the decade. He also tried a musical with Max Bygraves, &quot;Charley Moon&quot; (1956) and an adventure film which he co wrote with Foxwell, &quot;Manuela&quot; (1957).

Hamilton had his first experience with larger-budget films towards the end of the decade, when he replaced the sacked Alexander Mackendrick on the set of &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot; (1959) featuring Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster.

After &quot;A Touch of Larceny&quot; (1960), which he co wrote with producer Foxwell, Hamilton again found himself working with a war theme on the Dino De Laurentiis-produced Italian war comedy &quot;The Best of Enemies&quot; (1961). This was the first film to show Hamilton&#x27;s skill with intricate set-piece action sequences. 

He turned down an offer to direct &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962), the first James Bond film. His next release, and somewhat outside his developing œuvre, was &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot;, which, though filmed in 1963, was not released until 1965. The film was heavily censored and, in protest, Hamilton asked for his name to be removed when the film was finally released. He directed &quot;Man in the Middle&quot; (1964) with Robert Mitchum.

===James Bond===
Hamilton followed with his first James Bond film, &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964). He later reflected that he was able to successfully merge the series&#x27;s mix of action adventure, sexual innuendo and black humour.

In the late 1960s, Hamilton directed two further films for Bond producer Harry Saltzman: &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot; (1966, starring Michael Caine), and the war epic &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1969). 
He returned to the Bond film franchise with the chase- and gadget-dependent &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971), &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974). He claimed in a much later interview that he had instructed Roger Moore not to mimic Sean Connery&#x27;s rendition of James Bond and said the only Bond he regretted making was &quot;Golden Gun&quot;. Hamilton was later asked to direct &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981) but declined because the cash-strapped United Artists could not afford his salary.

Hamilton was originally chosen to direct &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot; (1978), but due to his status as a tax exile, he was allowed to be in England for only thirty days a year, where production had moved at the last minute to Pinewood Studios. The job of director was then passed to Richard Donner, but Hamilton insisted that he be paid in full. 

Hamilton&#x27;s only film projects in the latter part of the 1970s were the commercially unsuccessful &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot; (1978) and the poorly received adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s mystery &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d&quot; (1980). 

Another Christie adaptation followed in 1982, with &quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot; which was received more favourably than &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d&quot;. 

Hamilton directed only two more films in the 1980s (&quot;Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins&quot; in 1985 and 1989&#x27;s &quot;Try This One for Size&quot;) before entering retirement.

In the late 1980s he was approached to direct &quot;Batman&quot; (1989), but declined. In a 2003 interview, he said that the contemporary Bond films relied too heavily on special effects and not as much on the spectacular and risky stunts of the Bond films of his era.

&quot;I know that I’ve made some bad pictures, but when I was making a film, I knew I had to do the best I could with the material that I was working with,&quot; he said. &quot;Sometimes I wished I had a more cooperative or a better writer, but that&#x27;s the same for everybody.&quot;

==Death==
Hamilton died at the age of 93 on 20 April 2016.

==Personal life==
Hamilton was married twice, first to Naomi Chance in 1953, and then to the actress Kerima in 1964, many years after they first met during the filming of &quot;Outcast of the Islands&quot;. They lived in a villa in Andratx on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca from the mid-1970s until his death.

<doc id="490305" wikidata="Q188151" url="?curid=490305" title="Ischemia">
<text>Ischemia or ischaemia is a restriction in blood supply to any tissue, muscle group, or organ of the body, causing a shortage of oxygen that is needed for cellular metabolism (to keep tissue alive). Ischemia is generally caused by problems with blood vessels, with resultant damage to or dysfunction of tissue, i.e., hypoxia and microvascular dysfunction. It also implies local hypoxia in a part of a body resulting from constriction (such as vasoconstriction, thrombosis, or embolism). 

Ischemia causes not only insufficiency of oxygen but also reduced availability of nutrients and inadequate removal of metabolic wastes. Ischemia can be partial (poor perfusion) or total blockage. The inadequate delivery of oxygenated blood to the organs must be resolved either by treating the cause of the inadequate delivery or reducing the oxygen demand of the system that needs it. For example, patients with myocardial ischemia have a decreased blood flow to the heart and are prescribed with medications that reduce chronotropic and inotropic effect to meet the new level of blood delivery supplied by the stenosed vasculature so that it is adequate.

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of ischemia vary, as they can occur anywhere in the body and depend on the degree to which blood flow is interrupted. For example, clinical manifestations of acute limb ischemia (which can be summarized as the &quot;six P&#x27;s&quot;) include pain, pallor, pulseless, paresthesia, paralysis, and poikilothermia.

Without immediate intervention, ischemia may progress quickly to tissue necrosis and gangrene within a few hours. Paralysis is a very late sign of acute arterial ischemia and signals the death of nerves supplying the extremity. Foot drop may occur as a result of nerve damage. Because nerves are extremely sensitive to hypoxia, limb paralysis or ischemic neuropathy may persist after revascularization and may be permanent.

=== Cardiac ischemia ===

Cardiac ischemia may be asymptomatic or may cause chest pain, known as angina pectoris. It occurs when the heart muscle, or myocardium, receives insufficient blood flow. This most frequently results from atherosclerosis, which is the long-term accumulation of cholesterol-rich plaques in the coronary arteries. In most Western countries, Ischemic heart disease is the most common cause of death in both men and women, and a major cause of hospital admissions.

=== Bowel ===

Both large and small intestines can be affected by ischemia. The blockage of blood flow to the large intestine (colon) is called ischemic colitis. Ischemia of the small bowel is called mesenteric ischemia.

=== Brain ===
Brain ischemia is insufficient blood flow to the brain, and can be acute or chronic. Acute ischemic stroke is a neurological emergency typically caused by a blood clot blocking blood flow in a vessel in the brain. Chronic ischemia of the brain may result in a form of dementia called vascular dementia. A sudden, brief episode (symptoms lasting only minutes) of ischemia affecting the brain is called a transient ischemic attack (TIA), often called a mini-stroke. TIAs can be a warning of future strokes, with approximately 1/3 of TIA patients having a serious stroke within one year.

=== Limb ===
Inadequate blood supply to a limb may result in acute limb ischemia or chronic limb threatening ischemia.

=== Cutaneous ===

Reduced blood flow to the skin layers may result in mottling or uneven, patchy discoloration of the skin.

=== Kidney ischemia ===
Kidney ischemia is a loss of blood flow to the kidney cells. Several physical symptoms include shrinkage of one or both kidneys, renovascular hypertension, acute renal failure, progressive azotemia, and acute pulmonary edema. It is a disease with high mortality rate and high morbidity. Failure to treat could cause chronic kidney disease and a need for renal surgery.

==Causes==
Ischemia is a vascular disease involving an interruption in the arterial blood supply to a tissue, organ, or extremity that, if untreated, can lead to tissue death. It can be caused by embolism, thrombosis of an atherosclerotic artery, or trauma. Venous problems like venous outflow obstruction and low-flow states can cause acute arterial ischemia. An aneurysm is one of the most frequent causes of acute arterial ischemia. Other causes are heart conditions including myocardial infarction, mitral valve disease, chronic atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathies, and prosthesis, in all of which thrombi are prone to develop.

===Occlusion===
The thrombi may dislodge and may travel anywhere in the circulatory system, where they may lead to pulmonary embolus, an acute arterial occlusion causing the oxygen and blood supply distal to the embolus to decrease suddenly. The degree and extent of symptoms depend on the size and location of the obstruction, the occurrence of clot fragmentation with embolism to smaller vessels, and the degree of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).
* Thromboembolism (blood clots)
* Embolism (foreign bodies in the circulation, e.g. amniotic fluid embolism)

===Trauma===
Traumatic injury to an extremity may produce partial or total occlusion of a vessel from compression, shearing, or laceration. Acute arterial occlusion may develop as a result of arterial dissection in the carotid artery or aorta or as a result of iatrogenic arterial injury (e.g., after angiography).

===Other===
An inadequate flow of blood to a part of the body may be caused by any of the following:
* Thoracic outlet syndrome (compression of the brachial plexus)
* Atherosclerosis (lipid-laden plaques obstructing the lumen of arteries)
* Hypoglycemia (lower than normal level of glucose)
* Tachycardia (abnormally rapid beating of the heart)
* Radiotherapy, therapeutic radiation used to treat cancer can cause a delayed side effect injury in adjacent tissue via progressive, proliferative endarteritis, inflamed arterial linings that disrupt the tissue&#x27;s blood supply.
* Hypotension (low blood pressure, e.g. in septic shock, heart failure)
* Outside compression of a blood vessel, e.g. by a tumor or in the case of superior mesenteric artery syndrome
* Sickle cell disease (abnormally shaped red blood cells)
* Induced g-forces which restrict the blood flow and force the blood to the extremities of the body, as in acrobatics and military flying
* Localized extreme cold, such as by frostbite or improper cold compression therapy
* Tourniquet application
* An increased level of glutamate receptor stimulation 
* Arteriovenous malformations and peripheral artery occlusive disease
* rupture of significant blood vessels supplying a tissue or organ.
* Anemia vasoconstricts the periphery so that red blood cells cannot work internally on vital organs such as the heart, brain, etc., thus causing lack of oxygen to the periphery.
* Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant.
* Unconsciousness, such as due to the ingestion of excessive doses of central depressants like alcohol or opioids, can result in ischemia of the extremities due to unusual body positions that prevent normal circulation

==Pathophysiology==


Ischemia results in tissue damage in a process known as ischemic cascade. The damage is the result of the build-up of metabolic waste products, inability to maintain cell membranes, mitochondrial damage, and eventual leakage of autolyzing proteolytic enzymes into the cell and surrounding tissues.

Restoration of blood supply to ischemic tissues can cause additional damage known as reperfusion injury that can be more damaging than the initial ischemia. Reintroduction of blood flow brings oxygen back to the tissues, causing a greater production of free radicals and reactive oxygen species that damage cells. It also brings more calcium ions to the tissues causing further calcium overloading and can result in potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias and also accelerates cellular self-destruction. The restored blood flow also exaggerates the inflammation response of damaged tissues, causing white blood cells to destroy damaged cells that may otherwise still be viable.

== Treatment ==

Early treatment is essential to keep the affected organ viable. The treatment options include injection of an anticoagulant, thrombolysis, embolectomy, surgical revascularization, or partial amputation. Anticoagulant therapy is initiated to prevent further enlargement of the thrombus. Continuous IV unfractionated heparin has been the traditional agent of choice.

If the condition of the ischemic limb is stabilized with anticoagulation, recently formed emboli may be treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis using intra-arterial infusion of a thrombolytic agent (e.g., recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), streptokinase, or urokinase). A percutaneous catheter inserted into the femoral artery and threaded to the site of the clot is used to infuse the drug. Unlike anticoagulants, thrombolytic agents work directly to resolve the clot over a period of 24 to 48 hours.

Direct arteriotomy may be necessary to remove the clot. Surgical revascularization may be used in the setting of trauma (e.g., laceration of the artery). Amputation is reserved for cases where limb salvage is not possible. If the patient continues to have a risk of further embolization from some persistent source, such as chronic atrial fibrillation, treatment includes long-term oral anticoagulation to prevent further acute arterial ischemic episodes.

Decrease in body temperature reduces the aerobic metabolic rate of the affected cells, reducing the immediate effects of hypoxia. Reduction of body temperature also reduces the inflammation response and reperfusion injury. For frostbite injuries, limiting thawing and warming of tissues until warmer temperatures can be sustained may reduce reperfusion injury.

Ischemic stroke is at times treated with various levels of statin therapy at hospital discharge, followed by home time, in an attempt to lower the risk of adverse events.

==Society and culture==
The Infarct Combat Project (ICP) is an international nonprofit organization founded in 1998 to fight ischemic heart diseases through education and research.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word &quot;ischemia&quot; () is from Greek ἴσχαιμος &quot;iskhaimos&quot; &#x27;staunching blood&#x27;, from ἴσχω &quot;iskhο&quot; &#x27;keep back, restrain&#x27; and αἷμα &quot;haima&quot; &#x27;blood&#x27;.

<text>121 (one hundred [and] twenty-one) is the natural number following 120 and preceding 122.

==In mathematics==

&quot;One hundred [and] twenty-one&quot; is 
* a square (11 times 11)
* the sum of the powers of 3 from 0 to 4, so a repunit in ternary. Furthermore, 121 is the only square of the form formula_1, where &quot;p&quot; is prime (3, in this case).
* the sum of three consecutive prime numbers (37 + 41 + 43).
* As formula_2, it provides a solution to Brocard&#x27;s problem. There are only two other squares known to be of the form formula_3. Another example of 121 being one of the few numbers supporting a conjecture is that Fermat conjectured that 4 and 121 are the only perfect squares of the form formula_4 (with being 2 and 5, respectively).
* It is also a star number, a centered tetrahedral number, and a centered octagonal number.

* In decimal, it is a Smith number since its digits add up to the same value as its factorization (which uses the same digits) and as a consequence of that it is a Friedman number (formula_5). But it cannot be expressed as the sum of any other number plus that number&#x27;s digits, making 121 a self number.

<text>A peep show or peepshow is a presentation of a live sex show or pornographic film which is viewed through a viewing slot.

Several historical media provided voyeuristic entertainment through hidden erotic imagery. Before the development of the cinema in 1895, motion pictures were presented in peep boxes, such as the kinetoscope and the mutoscope. These remained relatively popular for erotic and pornographic films, such as &quot;What the Butler Saw&quot;. 

In contemporary use, a peep show is a piecewise presentation of pornographic films or a live sex show which is viewed through a viewing slot, which shuts after the time paid for has expired. The viewing slots can be operated by a money box device, or paid for at a counter. 

Pornographic peep shows became popular in the 1970s as part of the developing pornography industry. Until home video became widespread, peep shows made up a major part of the way in which video pornography was accessed. In 1986 a US Presidential report into pornography said that peep shows were making significant earnings which were often undeclared or untaxed, and in some US locations peep shows were subsequently suppressed.

For live peep shows, booths can surround a stage upon which usually a female performer performs a striptease and sexually explicit poses. In Barcelona female performers at times also perform sexual intercourse with male performers on stage. In some cases, booths include paper towel dispensers for customers who engage in masturbation. A customer and performer can mutually agree on a fee for a &quot;private dance&quot;, which can take place in a peep show booth with a clear window and seating space for only one spectator.

== California ==
Research on peep show establishments in California examined the hypothesis that neighborhoods surrounding sex businesses such as peep show establishments and X-rated movie stores have higher rates of crime. The researchers compared 911 calls in peep show and control neighborhoods in San Diego. Although peep show neighborhoods had approximately 16 percent more calls, the researchers concluded that the difference was not statistically significant. However, other researchers reanalyzed the data and concluded that the difference was significant.

=== Regal Show World ===
Regal Show World was an adult entertainment business on lower Market Street in San Francisco, California. The company&#x27;s slogan was &quot;Where you are king&quot;. The business had a peep show and an adult video arcade. The peep show had performers working in an enclosed round room with viewing booths surrounding it and sometimes had a &quot;double in the bubble&quot; show in which two performers worked simultaneously. During the winter of 1997 to 1998, the business had thirty-five performers. At this time, over 80% of performers there attempted to unionize and &quot;signed union authorization cards for representation by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Local 790&quot;.

The business was owned by Bijou Group, Inc., a privately held company in San Francisco that was founded in 1990. Bijou Group owned similar businesses in San Francisco such as New Century Theater, Market Street Cinema, and the Campus Theater. Bijou Group, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization . In November 1998, management of Regal Show World announced that the peep show would be closed on November 30 of that month due to &quot;economic reasons&quot;. At the time, some performers in the industry stated that closure of the peep show was done as a retaliative measure against attempts for performers to unionize. The company declared bankruptcy after performers made a second attempt at unionization, whereby the performers &quot;signed cards calling for a union election&quot;, and the theater was closed.

=== Lusty Lady ===
The former Lusty Lady peep show in San Francisco, California, entered the news in 1997, when it became the first U.S. sex business to be unionized. In 2003 it was bought by the employees and became a worker cooperative. It closed due to increased rent in 2013.

== Nevada ==
In Las Vegas in the early 1990s, city authorities began to move peep shows and other sexually oriented businesses away from the city centre. The last peep show in Las Vegas closed in 2019.

== New York ==
Times Square in New York was famous for its peep shows up until the 1990s. Female performers would stand undressed on a small semicircular or circular stage surrounded by individual booths. By inserting a token into a machine, a patron could open the opaque partitions separating them from the stage. He could then choose a performer and, for the payment of a small tip, summon her and fondle her sexually or ask her to perform sex acts on him. After taking office as mayor in 1994, Rudy Giuliani waged a legal battle to shut down the Times Square peep shows. Following a major legal decision in Giuliani&#x27;s favor in 1998, the peep shows mostly closed.

== Washington ==

The former Lusty Lady peep show in Seattle, Washington, was, unlike its namesake in San Francisco, not unionized. Similar to the Lusty Lady in San Francisco, however, the Seattle peep show was deemed an iconic local landmark by the time it finally closed in 2010. Its closing was attributed to being unable to compete with pornography on the Internet.

<text>The University of Houston (; ) is a public research university in Houston, Texas, United States. It was established in 1927 as Houston Junior College, a coeducational institution and one of multiple junior colleges formed in the first decades of the 20th century. In 1934, HJC was restructured as a four-year degree-granting institution and renamed University of Houston. In 1977, it became the founding member of the University of Houston System. Today, Houston is the university in Texas, awarding 11,156 degrees in 2023. As of 2024, it has a worldwide alumni base of 331,672.

The university consists of fifteen colleges and an interdisciplinary honors college offering some 310-degree programs and enrolls approximately 37,000 undergraduate and 8,600 graduate students. The university&#x27;s campus, which is primarily in southeast Houston, spans , with the inclusion of its two instructional sites located in Sugar Land and Katy. The university is also the founding campus of the University of Houston System.

The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot; and spends approximately $240 million annually in research. The university operates more than 35 research centers and institutes on campus in areas such as superconductivity, space commercialization and exploration, biomedical sciences and engineering, energy and natural resources, and artificial intelligence.

The university has more than 500 student organizations and 17 intercollegiate sports teams. Its varsity athletic teams, known as the Houston Cougars, are members of the Big 12 Conference and compete in the NCAA Division I in all sports. In 2021, the university received and accepted an invitation to join the Big 12 Conference. The football team regularly makes bowl game appearances, and the men&#x27;s basketball team has made 23 appearances in the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament—including six Elite Eight and Final Four appearances. The men&#x27;s golf team has won 16 national championships—the most in NCAA history. In 2022, UH&#x27;s men&#x27;s track and field team earned its seventh Indoor Conference Championship title, and its swimming and diving team defended its American Athletic Conference title for the sixth straight season.

==History==
===Founding===
The University of Houston began as Houston Junior College (HJC). On March 7, 1927, trustees of the Board of Education of the Houston Independent School District (HISD) unanimously signed a charter founding the junior college. The junior college was operated and administered by HISD.

HJC was originally located on the San Jacinto High School campus and offered only night courses to train future teachers.

Its first class began June 5, 1927, with an enrollment of 232 students and 12 faculty recruited from Rice University, the University of Texas and Sam Houston State Teacher&#x27;s College. The first session accepted no freshman students, and its purpose was to mainly educate future teachers about the college. In the fall semester, HJC opened enrolled to high school students. By then, the college had 230 students and eight faculty members holding evening classes at San Jacinto High School and day classes in area churches.

HJC&#x27;s first president was Edison Ellsworth Oberholtzer, who was the dominant force in establishing the junior college.
===University beginnings===
The junior college became eligible to become a university in October 1933 when the governor of Texas, Miriam A. Ferguson, signed House Bill 194 into law. On September 11, 1933, Houston&#x27;s Board of Education adopted a resolution to make HJC a four-year institution and changing its name to the University of Houston. Unanimously approved by the board, the formal charter of UH was passed April 30, 1934.

UH&#x27;s first session as a four-year institution began June 4, 1934, at San Jacinto High School with an enrollment of 682. By the fall semester it had 909 students enrolled in classes taught by 39 faculty members in three colleges and schools – College of Arts and Sciences, College of Community Service and General College. In 1934, the first campus of the University of Houston was established at the Second Baptist Church at Milam and McGowen. The next fall, the campus was moved to the South Main Baptist Church on Main Street—between Richmond Avenue and Eagle Street—where it stayed for the next five years. In May 1935, the institution as a university held its first commencement at Miller Outdoor Theatre.

In the mission of finding UH a permanent home, heirs of philanthropists J. J. Settegast and Ben Taub donated to the university for use as a permanent location in 1936. At this time, there was no road that led to the land tract, but in 1937, the city added Saint Bernard Street, which was later renamed to Cullen Boulevard. It would become a major thoroughfare of the campus. As a project of the National Youth Administration, workers were paid fifty cents an hour to clear the land. In 1938, Hugh Roy Cullen donated $335,000 (equivalent to $ in ) for the first building to be built at the location. The Roy Gustav Cullen Memorial Building was dedicated on June 4, 1939, and opened for classes officially on Wednesday, September 20, 1939. The building was the first air-conditioned college building constructed on a U.S. campus.
A year after opening the new campus, the university had over 2,000 students. As World War II approached, enrollment decreased due to the draft and enlistments. The university was one of six colleges selected to train radio technicians in the V-12 Navy College Training Program. By the fall of 1943, there were only about 1,100 regular students at UH; thus, the 300 or so servicemen contributed in sustaining the faculty and facilities of the Engineering College. This training at UH continued until March 1945, with a total of 4,178 students.

On March 12, 1945, Senate Bill 207 was signed into law, removing the control of the University of Houston from HISD and placing it into the hands of a board of regents. In 1945, the university—which had grown too large and complex for the Houston school board to administer—became a private university.

In March 1947, the regents authorized creation of a law school at the university. In 1949, the M.D. Anderson Foundation made a $1.5 million gift to UH for the construction of a dedicated library building on the campus. By 1950, the educational plant at UH consisted of 12 permanent buildings. Enrollment was more than 14,000 with a full-time faculty of more than 300. KUHF, the university radio station, signed on in November. By 1951, UH had achieved the feat of being the second-largest university in the state of Texas.

===State university===

In 1953, the university established KUHT—the first educational television station in the nation—after the four yearlong Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s television licensing freeze ended. During this period, however, the university as a private institution was facing financial troubles. Tuition failed to cover rising costs, and in turn, tuition increases caused a drop in enrollment. That&#x27;s when it was proposed that UH become a state-funded university.

After a lengthy battle between supporters of the University of Houston, led by school president A.D. Bruce, and forces from state universities, including the University of Texas, geared to block the change, Senate Bill 2 was passed on May 23, 1961, enabling the university to enter the state system in 1963. Beginning roughly during this period, UH became known as &quot;Cougar High&quot; because of its low academic standards, which the university leveraged to its advantage in recruiting athletes.

The University of Houston, initially reserved for white and non-black students, was racially desegregated circa the 1960s as part of the civil rights movements. A group of students called Afro-Americans for Black Liberation (AABL) advocated for desegregation in that period. Robinson Block, a UH undergraduate student writing for &quot;Houston History Magazine&quot;, stated that as local businesses and student organization remained segregated by race, the first group of black students &quot;had a hard time&quot;.

As the University of Houston celebrated its 50th anniversary, the Texas Legislature formally established the University of Houston System in 1977. Philip G. Hoffman resigned from his position as president of UH and became the first chancellor of the University of Houston System. The University of Houston became the oldest and largest member institution in the UH System with nearly 30,000 students.

On April 26, 1983, the university appended its official name to University of Houston–University Park; however, the name was changed back to University of Houston on August 26, 1991. This name change was an effort by the UH System to give its flagship institution a distinctive name that would eliminate confusion with the University of Houston–Downtown (UHD), which is a separate and distinct degree-granting institution that is not part of the University of Houston.

===Restructuring and growth===

In 1997, the administrations of the UH System and the University of Houston were combined under a single chief executive officer, with the dual title of chancellor of the UH System and president of the University of Houston. Arthur K. Smith became the first person to hold the combined position. Since 1997, the University of Houston System Administration has been located on campus in the Ezekiel W. Cullen Building.

On October 15, 2007, Renu Khator was selected for the position of UH System chancellor and UH president. On November 5, 2007, Khator was confirmed as the third person to hold the dual title of UH System chancellor and UH president concurrently, and took office in January 2008.

In January 2011, the University of Houston was classified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as a research university with very high research activity.
==Campus==

UH is in southeast Houston, with an official address of 4800 Calhoun Road. It was known as University of from 1983 to 1991. The campus spans and is roughly bisected by Cullen Boulevard—a thoroughfare that has become synonymous with the university. The Third Ward Redevelopment Council defines the University of Houston as being part of the Third Ward. Melissa Correa of KHOU also stated that the university is in the Third Ward.

The university campus includes numerous green spaces, fountains and sculptures, including a work by famed sculptor Jim Sanborn. Renowned architects César Pelli and Philip Johnson have designed buildings on the UH campus. Recent campus beautification projects have garnered awards from the Keep Houston Beautiful group for improvements made to the Cullen Boulevard corridor.

UH is the flagship institution of the University of Houston System (UH System). It has additional instructional sites located in Sugar Land and Katy. The University of (UHCL), the University of Houston–Downtown (UHD), and the University of (UHV) are separate universities; they are not instructional sites of UH.
===Campus layout===

The University of Houston&#x27;s campus framework has identified the following five core districts: the Central District, the Arts District, the Professional District, the Residential District, and the Athletics District. In addition, the campus contains several outlying areas not identified among the five districts.

The Central Distinct contains the academic core of the university and consists of the M.D. Anderson Library, the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, the College of Technology and the Honors College. The interior of the campus has the original buildings: the Roy G. Cullen Building, the Old Science Building, and the Ezekiel W. Cullen Building. Academic and research facilities include the Cullen Performance Hall, the Science and Engineering Research and Classroom Complex, and Texas Center for Superconductivity and various other science and liberal arts buildings. This area of campus features the reflecting pool at Cullen Family Plaza, the Lynn Eusan Park, and various plazas and green spaces.
The Arts District is located in the northern part of campus and is home to the university&#x27;s School of Art, the Moores School of Music, the School of Theatre and Dance, the Gerald D. Hines College of Architecture and Design, and the Jack J. Valenti School of Communication. The district also has the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Center for the Performing Arts which houses the Lyndall Finley Wortham Theatre, the main stage of the School of Theatre and Dance, and Moores Opera Center. Other facilities include the Dudley Recital Hall and the Organ Recital Hall in the Fine Arts Building, the Quintero Theatre in the School of Theatre and Dance, and the Moores Opera House and Choral Recital Hall in the Moores School of Music Building.

The Professional District is located northeast and east of the university campus. The district has facilities of the University of Houston Law Center, the Cullen College of Engineering and the C.T. Bauer College of Business. This area of campus is home to Calhoun Lofts, which is an upper-level and graduate housing facility. The East Parking Garage is located on the east end of the district. Adjacent to the district is the University Center (UC), the larger of two student unions on campus.

The Residential District is in the southern portion of the campus, along Wheeler Avenue and east of Martin Luther King Boulevard. This area has undergraduate dormitories, the Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management, now Conrad N. Hilton College of Global Hospitality Leadership, and the College of Optometry. Dormitory facilities include the twin 18-story Moody Towers, Cougar Village, University Lofts, Cougar Place, and the recently demolished Quadrangle which had the following five separate halls: Oberholtzer, Bates, Taub, Settegast, and Law. The Quadrangle was rebuilt in 2020 and renamed The Quad, admitting sophomore level students and up. Adjacent to the Moody Towers and Lynn Eusan Park is the Hilton University of Houston Hotel.

The Athletics District covers the northwest and west part of campus. It includes athletic training facilities for UH sport teams and its stadiums. The western part of the district is home to TDECU Stadium, the football indoor practice facility and the Stadium Parking Garage. Across the parking garage, in the northwestern portion of the district, is the Hofheinz Pavilion. In 2018, the stadium was rebuilt and renamed to the Fertitta Center after UH received a $20 million donation from entrepreneur and UH System Board of Regents chairman Tilman Fertitta. Facilities surrounding the stadium are Carl Lewis International Track &amp; Field Complex, Cougar Field, Softball Stadium, the Alumni Center and the Athletic Center.

Additionally, the University Branch of the Fort Bend County Libraries system is located on the campus for use by students and the Sugar Land community.
==Institutional structure==
===Governance===
The University of Houston (UH) is one of four separate and distinct institutions in the University of Houston System, and was known as University of from 1983 to 1991. UH is the flagship institution of the UH System. It is a multi-campus university with a branch campus located in Sugar Land. The University of Houston–Clear Lake (UHCL), the University of Houston–Downtown (UHD), and the University of Houston–Victoria (UHV) are stand-alone universities; they are not branch campuses of UH.

The organization and control of the UH is vested in the UH System Board of Regents. The board consists of nine members who are appointed by the governor for a six-year term and has all the rights, powers and duties that it has with respect to the organization and control of other institutions in the System; however, UH is maintained as a separate and distinct institution.

===Administration===

The president is the chief executive officer (CEO) of the University of Houston, and serves concurrently as chancellor of the UH System. The position is appointed by its board of regents. As of January 2008, Renu Khator has been president of the University of Houston and chancellor of the UH System.

The administrations of UH and the UH System are located on the university campus in the Ezekiel W. Cullen Building. From 1961 until 1977, the Weingarten House in Riverside Terrace housed the president of UH. Currently, the chancellor/president resides in the Wortham House in Broadacres Historic District, provided by the UH System Board of Regents as part of the chancellor/president&#x27;s employment contract.
==Academics==


The university offers over 310-degree programs. With final approval of a PhD in Communication Sciences and Disorders, a Doctorate in Nursing Practice, and a Doctorate in Medicine, university offers 51 doctoral degrees including three professional doctorate degrees in law, optometry, medicine and pharmacy.

In 2022, UH System Board of Regents unanimously approved the addition of a new degree program of the Bachelor of Arts in Mexican American and Latino/a Applied Studies. Being located in a city with a large Hispanic/Latino population, the degree aims to focus on the experiences and contributions of the Latino community in the United States.

UH is one of four public universities in Texas with a Phi Beta Kappa chapter. The University of Houston&#x27;s faculty includes National Medal of Science recipient Paul Chu from the Physics Department, and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Jody Williams.

The College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences (CLASS) has the Creative Writing Program which includes founders such as alumnus Donald Barthelme and offers degrees in poetry, fiction, and non-fiction. The Gerald D. Hines College of Architecture and Design is one of only 36 schools to have an accreditation from the National Architectural Accrediting Board.

In August 2016, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board approved the creation of the Hobby School of Public Affairs. The school, named in honor of former Texas Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby, builds on the existing educational and research programs of the Center for Public Policy, which was founded at UH in 1981. The designation officially moves the Master of Public Policy Degree from the UH College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences to the Hobby School of Public Affairs and approves the addition of a Master of Public Policy degree as a dual degree with the Graduate College of Social Work&#x27;s Master of Social Work.

In October 2018, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board approved the creation of the College of Medicine. A site has been selected for the college&#x27;s new building, and the inaugural class entered in 2020.

===Rankings===
In the 2024 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings, UH placed in the top 50 universities for social mobility, and the University of Houston Law Center was ranked tied for 68th in the nation and 5th in the state of Texas. The C.T. Bauer College of Business was ranked as the 56th best business school in the country and 7th best in the state of Texas.

In the 2024 The Princeton Review and &quot;Entrepreneur&quot; magazine rankings, the undergraduate entrepreneurship studies program at the Bauer College of Business ranked 1st in the nation.



UH president Renu Khator hailed these achievements, stating that “progress is not just about numbers; it’s about the positive, lasting impact we have on our students and the broader community. Our students deserve the best education, and our city and state deserve a top-notch public university.” However, this improvement in rankings was largely due to changes in U.S. News&#x27; ranking methodology, which removed key measures of academic excellence, such as the percentage of faculty with the highest degrees, the percentage of students in the top 10 percent of their high school class, and average class size. These changes gave the appearance of progress without reflecting any meaningful improvement in academic standards.

In reality, the administration’s policies aimed at climbing the rankings have actively eroded academic excellence. One faculty member pointed out that the focus on rankings, which increasingly reward colleges for simply granting degrees, has reduced the quality of instruction. In an effort to meet ranking metrics, the university has increased class sizes to boost revenue and lowered academic requirements and performance standards to raise graduation rates. While these tactics improved UH’s position in the rankings, they have diminished the educational experience, favoring quantity over quality.

As one faculty member put it, these changes “increased revenue and decreased costs, more customers and fewer employees (though, paradoxically, more midlevel managers).” The shift “exemplifies the creeping corporatization of higher education—&#x27;Bilk them, and they will come.&#x27;&quot;

Simultaneously, there has been a growing emphasis on funding athletics. “Value is now a matter of Saturday-afternoon football,” said one faculty member. In pursuit of national relevance, the university has poured $170 million since 2018 into a struggling football program that plays to half-empty stadiums. Value is now defined by major stakeholders, particularly megadonors, who prefer to fund sports programs over academic initiatives.&quot;

==Research==

The Carnegie Foundation classifies UH as a doctoral degree-granting institution with &quot;highest research activity.&quot; The designation recognizes it as one of only nine universities in Texas with the classification.

According to the National Science Foundation, UH spent $177 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 123rd in the nation. It operates more than 40 research centers and institutes on campus, and through these facilities, UH maintains partnerships with government, health care and private industry. Areas of interdisciplinary research include nanotechnology, superconductivity, space commercialization and exploration, biomedical sciences and engineering, energy and natural resources, and artificial intelligence.

The university has five institutional research thrusts to address several research challenges aimed at economic development and improving the quality of life. The five thrusts include: Cyber and Physical Security, Drug Discovery and Development, Sustainable Communities and Infrastructure, Energy Security and Transition, and Accessible Health Care.

In 2018, UH launched its 50in5 initiative. Led by the Provost Paula Short and Vice President for Research Amr Elnashai, the university is working to increase research by 50 percent in five years. This includes the doubling of UH&#x27;s national centers from five to 10, thereby improving its position for the Association of American University&#x27;s membership.

In 2022, UH received $4 million for the expansion of its Center of Economic Inclusion.

==Student life==

The University of Houston is notable for its diverse student body, and &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranks the university as the second-most ethnically diverse research university in the United States. UH&#x27;s Asian and Hispanic student population is among the highest in the state. Due to the high percentage of Hispanic students on campus, UH has been deemed a Hispanic-serving institution. Its international student population is primarily from Asia.

===Art, music and theatre===

Located in the Fine Arts Building, Blaffer Art Museum is a contemporary art museum dedicated to emerging, mid-career, and underrepresented artists and bodies of work through exhibitions, publications, and public programs. Its educational programs include public lectures, artists&#x27; talks, docent tours, audio guides, and youth programs such as Studio Saturday, Summer Arts, and the Young Artist Apprenticeship Program.

The Cullen Performance Hall is a 1,612 seat proscenium theater located near Entrance 1. The hall offers a variety of events sponsored by departments and organizations at the university in addition to contemporary music concerts, opera, modern dance, and theatrical performances put on by groups in and outside the Houston area.

The Moores School of Music presents concerts in various campus venues: Dudley Recital Hall and the Organ Recital Hall in the Fine Arts Building, and in the Moores Opera House and Choral Recital Hall in the music building. Musical events range from opera to jazz with performers including students, faculty, and guest artists.

The School of Theatre and Dance offers a subscription series of five plays each year. Works by classical and modern dramatists, as well as new musical collaborators, are seen in full productions or &quot;gypsy runthroughs.&quot;

The School of Art exhibits young artists several times a year, including the Master of Fine Arts exhibition held traditionally near the end of the spring semester in the Blaffer Art Museum. The School of Art also hosts presentations by numerous visiting artists and art historians throughout the academic year.

===Housing===
UH has several on campus dormitories: Moody Towers, The Quad, Cougar Village I &amp; II, Cougar Place, University Lofts, Bayou Oaks, Cullen Oaks, and Cambridge Oaks.

Moody Towers, frequently just called &quot;Moody,&quot; is one of the tallest complexes on campus and the largest area of residence halls. Each of the two towers consists of eighteen stories and together house 1,100 students. The Towers feature a newly renovated dining hall. The rooms in Moody were renovated during the summer of 2011.

The Quad is the newest dorm on campus, having been completed in the Fall of 2020. Named after the former dorms, &quot;The Quadrangle,&quot; there are laundry facilities on each floor, as well as a recreational facility, computer lab, and an outdoor courtyard. An extension of The Quad, the Townhouses are single-student dorms right across from The Quad. In total, The Quad and Townhouses combine for 7 buildings that house almost 1,200 students.

In August 2009, University Lofts—a university-owned and operated residential facility aimed at graduate and professional students—opened and includes retail stores, lecture halls, and recreation facilities.

Cougar Village I &amp; II are a freshman, including first year Honors students, dorm which opened in August 2010 and August 2013, respectively. The dormitory features themed floors with kitchens and lounges, a tutoring center, computer labs, multi-purpose rooms, study areas, a convenience store, a laundry facility, and a fitness center. Cougar Village I &amp; II are exclusive only to freshman and Honors College students.

In addition to traditional dormitories, Cougar Place was an apartment-style housing complex consisting of 400 units. Cougar Place has since been demolished and has been replaced with a new on-campus housing complex for sophomores. The university has privately owned apartment complexes on campus: Cullen Oaks, Bayou Oaks, and Cambridge Oaks.

In June 2017, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found that the university did not violate the Constitution&#x27;s Due Process Clause or Title IX when it expelled both a student for committing a campus sexual assault in a dorm room then abandoning the nude victim in a dorm elevator, as well as his girlfriend, who had recorded the assault and shared the video on social media.
===Media===
The official student newspaper is &quot;The Cougar&quot;, formerly &quot;The Daily Cougar&quot;, and has been published since 1927. Students also produce the &quot;Houstonian&quot; magazine, which is for graduating students; &quot;Cooglife&quot;, a monthly lifestyle magazine; and &quot;Transitions&quot;, a magazine for incoming students.

CoogTV is a live student-run TV network that appears on the University of Houston cable network.

CoogRadio, UH&#x27;s student-run college radio station, made its debut on August 29, 2011.
==Traditions==

The seal of the University of Houston, officially adopted in 1938, is a stylized version of the coat-of-arms of General Sam Houston. The first official version was placed on the floor of the Roy Gustav Cullen Building.

UH&#x27;s official colors are scarlet red and albino white. These were the colors of Sam Houston&#x27;s ancestor, Sir Hugh de Paduinan, and were adopted by UH at the same time as the official seal. Scarlet red symbolizes courage or inner strength to face the unknown, and white symbolizes the goodness and purity of spirit embodied in helping one&#x27;s fellow man.

Cougar Red Friday is part of the ongoing Keep Houston Red initiative at the University of Houston. Students and staff are encouraged to wear red shirts on Friday to show pride for the university.

The school&#x27;s official mascot is a cougar, which was adopted in 1947 and later named Shasta. The university owned a series of female cougars, but this tradition ceased in 1989, upon the death of Shasta V. When a cougar cub was orphaned in Washington State and moved to the Houston Zoo in 2011, the university adopted it as its first live male cougar mascot and he was named Shasta VI. Shasta VI passed away in August 2022 from a progressive spinal disease. In November of the same year, the Houston Zoo received two orphaned male cubs from Washington State Fish &amp; Wildlife Services and decided the cubs would carry the long-standing tradition of representing the University of Houston as Shasta VII and Louie.

The Frontiersmen—initially exclusive to members of the Sigma Chi fraternity, but later opened membership to the entire student body—is a group of students who participate in university events to drive school spirit. At football games, the Frontiersmen—donning cowboy hats, jeans and dusters for attire—run across the field with the university&#x27;s flag and the Texas flag after each score.

The BLAZE is an oil field warning siren, operated by the Frontiersmen, that was chosen to represent the university&#x27;s ties to the petroleum industry. The purchase of the siren was completed in 1991. The Sigma Chi Fraternity has overseen the siren and gave it the name &quot;The BLAZE&quot; in honor of its fallen brother, David Blazek.

Frontier Fiesta—a re-creation of a 19th-century Western town, with music, food and historical exhibits—is a major event on campus each spring semester. The student-led festival is a part of a long-standing tradition dating back to the 1940s established by Gan Bey which later became the Sigma Chi Fraternity&#x27;s Epsilon Xi chapter at UH. Frontier Fiesta attained widespread notoriety when the Sigma Chi variety show performance known as &quot;Bella Union&quot; garnered national attention on the cover of Life magazine as &quot;The Greatest College Show on Earth&quot; and soon-after drew crowds numbered in the tens of thousands from all across the country to participate in the festivities.

Cougar First Impressions—a program headed by the UH Staff Council—takes place every year on the first two days of classes, when faculty and staff turn out to welcome new and returning students.

Weeks of Welcome is another program welcoming students to the university. Over the span of two weeks, departments and student organizations help students learn more about the university with a variety of events.
===The Cougar Paw===

The Cougar Paw is a popular hand sign used by University of Houston students, faculty, alumni, and athletics fans to represent camaraderie and support. The Cougar Paw tradition was adopted through several athletics events between the University of Houston and the University of Texas.

The University of Houston and the University of Texas played their first football game against one another in 1953. Since this was their first meeting, members of Alpha Phi Omega—the service fraternity in charge of taking care of Shasta I, the university&#x27;s mascot—brought her to the game. During the trip, Shasta&#x27;s front paw was caught in the car door and one toe was cut off. At the game, several Longhorn players saw what had happened and began taunting UH players by holding up their hands with the ring finger bent, suggesting the Cougars were invalids. Texas went on to win this game 28–7. UH students had been using the victory sign as a hand signal up to that time but they began using the bent-finger sign as a reminder that they would remember the taunts.

The Cougars did not play the Longhorns again until 1968. With UH fans holding up the new sign of Cougar pride, UH played UT to a 20–20 tie. They didn&#x27;t meet again until 1976, the first year UH was a member of the Southwest Conference. In front of a record crowd at Texas&#x27; Memorial Stadium, UH defeated UT 30–0, a rout that signaled the beginning of the end for legendary Texas coach Darrell Royal. This solidified the use of the Cougar Paw as a tradition.
==Athletics==
UH&#x27;s 17-sport intercollegiate program is a member of the Big 12 Conference. Houston was previously a member of Conference USA, of which it was a member from the time the conference was formed in 1995 until 2013, when they joined the American Athletic Conference. During that time span, the Cougars won 33 C-USA titles. Prior to 1995, Houston was a member of the Southwest Conference.

After more than 75 years of athletics at UH, other notable achievements include 16 national titles in men&#x27;s golf, one national title in cross country, six NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball Final Four appearances, and two College World Series appearances. More than 75 Olympic athletes have attended UH, bringing home 41 medals, including 20 gold.

<doc id="490315" wikidata="Q54621302" url="?curid=490315" title="Manganese Bronze Holdings">
<text>Manganese Bronze Holdings plc (MBH) was the holding company of LTI Limited. The firm&#x27;s sole business in its final years as a company was London black taxicab manufacturing through the LTI subsidiary.

The Manganese Bronze and Brass Co was founded in 1881, incorporated in 1882 and originally made ship propellers, operating from factories in London. By World War II, it was also extruding and rolling specialised alloys, and in the 1950s expanded into light alloy product manufacturing. In the early 1960s, it shortened its name to Manganese Bronze and became an important conglomerator of British motorcycle marques. The company acquired the subsidiary Carbodies in 1973, which was involved in the design, development and production of taxicabs. This subsidiary eventually became LTI Limited, and traded first as London Taxis International and then as The London Taxi Company. The sale of its components division in 2003 left the company with LTI Limited as its only operating division.

In October 2012, MBH entered administration, having not made a profit since 2007. The Chinese automotive manufacturer Geely, which already owned 20% of the shares in LTI Limited, the company&#x27;s only business, agreed to purchase LTI&#x27;s principal assets and trade from the administrator to save the business and continue the production of taxis in Coventry. The new holding company was named The London Taxi Corporation, and it traded as The London Taxi Company (as LTI had done). This successor company was renamed to London EV Company in 2017.

==Company history==
===Propeller and light alloy product manufacture===
What became the Manganese, Bronze and Brass Co was founded in 1876 as P.M. Parsons, incorporated in 1882 and originally made Parsons Alloy (copper and manganese) ship propellers, operating from Thames-side factories in Deptford and, later, Millwall, London. It expanded into alloy products, and in World War I was contracted by the Ministry of Munitions to produce shell cases. As its London location put it at risk of enemy air-raids, the shell case factory was moved to Ipswich. During World War II, its propeller works was moved to Birkenhead. A takeover of Redro Ltd in 1959 gave the firm a presence in Beverley and new light alloy product capabilities. In 1962, it shortened its name to Manganese Bronze. In 1963 Stone-Platt took over the marine division based at Birkenhead, and the company converted into a holding company, Manganese Bronze Holdings Ltd, with two operating subsidiaries: Manganese Bronze Ltd at Ipswich and Alpax Ltd at Willesden and Beverley.

===Automotive engineering===

In the early 1960s Manganese Bronze Bearings Ltd (as it was then known) was taken over by a Dennis Poore investment vehicle, Villiers Engineering Ltd, a motorcycle company chiefly known for its range of engines, creating Manganese Bronze Holdings Ltd. This company subsequently bought Associated Motor Cycles Ltd, owners of the Norton, AJS and Matchless motorcycle brands in 1964.

Manganese absorbed part of the Birmingham Small Arms Company in 1973 - which included Carbodies, the Coventry-based London taxicab maker, under chairman Dennis Poore, as part of a rescue plan initiated by the British government. BSA Motorcycles interests trading as Triumph were combined with Manganese motorcycle production to form Norton Villiers Triumph. BSA Guns was liquidated in 1986. BSA&#x27;s components businesses became Manganese Bronze Components Division, comprising sintering, precision casting and metal powders; this division was sold in 2003 and went bankrupt a short period later.

In 1984, the London taxicab dealer Mann &amp; Overton was bought by Manganese. In 1992 the name Carbodies Limited was dropped and the company was renamed LTI Limited, comprising three divisions: LTI Carbodies, LTI Mann and Overton and London Taxi Finance. The trading name was London Taxis International.

In January 2003 Manganese launched Zingo Taxi, an innovative taxi hailing system using mobile location technology. This was sold to Computer Cab in November 2004 for £1. This was to stem large losses because only 1,100 of London&#x27;s approximately 21,000 taxi drivers subscribed. Between July 2003 and November 2004 Manganese also sold its property portfolio, including the land under its Coventry manufacturing facility.

===Partnership with Geely===
In October 2006 Manganese and the Chinese automaker Geely announced the creation of a China-based taxicab manufacturing joint venture. An extraordinary general meeting held in January 2007 of Manganese&#x27;s shareholders approved the formation of the joint venture. In June 2008 Manganese announced the production of the first prototype TX4 taxi at its Chinese joint venture, LTI Shanghai.

In July 2008 Manganese announced that it would be making redundant 40 employees as a result of the global economic downturn.

On 29 June 2009 the company advised that Geely had a notifiable interest in 6,085,000 of the company&#x27;s ordinary shares, representing 19.971% of the issued ordinary share capital.

In March 2010 it was announced that Manganese would move the production of all taxicab bodies and chassis to Shanghai, but TX4 cabs for the UK market would continue to be assembled in Coventry. In the same month it was reported that Geely would increase its shareholding in Manganese to 51% through participation in a placing of new shares. In August 2010 it was announced that Geely had decided not to proceed with the share placement and its shareholding in Manganeze would remain at just under 20%. In November 2010, LTI changed their trading name to &quot;The London Taxi Company&quot; to reflect the company&#x27;s core business.

===Administration===
Manganese entered administration on 22 October 2012 after failing to secure additional funding; PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) were appointed as the administrator. On 31 October PwC announced that 156 Manganese staff in the UK were to be made redundant with immediate effect, out of the company&#x27;s then total of 274 employees in the country, with the losses spread across its manufacturing facility, head office and dealerships.

===Rescue of the taxicab business===

In January 2013, it was reported that Geely was in negotiations to buy the remaining shares of the company from PwC to save the business. A press statement in February 2013 announced that an agreement had been reached for Geely to purchase the remainder of the London Taxi Company&#x27;s assets, manufacturing rights, unsold stock and dealerships. Geely set up a new company, The London Taxi Corporation Ltd. under its British subsidiary Geely UK Ltd to resume assembly of the London black cab in Coventry.

<text>Yggdrasil Linux/GNU/X, or LGX (pronounced &quot;igg-drah-sill&quot;), is an early Linux distribution developed by Yggdrasil Computing, Incorporated, a company founded by Adam J. Richter in Berkeley, California.

Yggdrasil was the first company to create a live CD Linux distribution. Yggdrasil Linux described itself as a &quot;Plug-and-Play&quot; Linux distribution, automatically configuring itself for the hardware.

Yggdrasil is the World Tree of Norse mythology. The name was chosen because Yggdrasil took disparate pieces of software and assembled them into a complete product. Yggdrasil&#x27;s company motto was &quot;Free Software For The Rest of Us&quot;.

Yggdrasil is compliant with the Unix Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.

== History and releases ==

Yggdrasil announced their ‘bootable Linux/GNU/X-based UNIX(R) clone for PC compatibles’ on 25 November 1992 and made the first release on 8 December 1992.
This alpha release contained the 0.98.1 version of the Linux kernel, the v11r5 version of the X Window System supporting up to 1024x768 with 256 colours, various GNU utilities such as their C/C++ compiler, the GNU Debugger, bison, flex, and make, TeX, groff, Ghostscript, the elvis and Emacs editors, and various other software. Yggdrasil&#x27;s alpha release required a 386 computer with 8 MB RAM and 100 MB hard disk. The alpha release was missing some of the source code of some of the packages, such as elvis.

A beta release was made on 18 February 1993. The beta&#x27;s cost was US$60. LGX&#x27;s beta release in 1993 contained the 0.99.5 version of the Linux kernel, along with other software from GNU and X. By 22 August 1993, the Yggdrasil company had sold over 3100 copies of the LGX beta distribution.

The production release version carried a pricetag of US$99. However, Yggdrasil was offered for free to any developer whose software was included with the CD distribution. According to an email from the company&#x27;s founder the marginal cost of each subscription was $35.70.

Early Yggdrasil releases were also available from stores selling CD-ROM software.

== Yggdrasil Computing, Incorporated ==
Adam J. Richter started the Yggdrasil company together with Bill Selmeier. Richter spoke to Michael Tiemann about setting up a business, but was not interested in joining forces with Cygnus.

Richter was a member of League for Programming Freedom. Richter was using only a 200 MB hard disk when building the alpha release of LGX, which prevented him from practically being able to include the source code of some of the packages contained in the CDROM.

Yggdrasil Incorporated published some of the early Linux compilation books, such as &quot;The Linux Bible: The GNU Testament&quot; (), and contributed significantly to file system and X Window System functionality of Linux in the early days of their operation.

The company moved to San Jose, California in 1996. In 1996, Yggdrasil Incorporated released the Winter 1996 edition of &quot;Linux Internet Archives&quot;; six CDs of Linux software from Tsx-11 and Sunsite, the GNU archive on prep.ai.mit.edu, the X11R6 archives including the free contributed X11R6 software from ftp.x.org, the Internet RFC standards, and a total of nine non-Yggdrasil Linux distributions.

The company remained active until at least year 2000, when it released the Linux Open Source DVD, but its website was taken offline afterwards and the company has not released anything since.

The company&#x27;s last corporate filing was in January 2004. The California Secretary of State lists it as suspended.

The company once made an offer to donate 60% of the Yggdrasil CDROM sales revenues to the Computer Systems Research Group, but founder Adam J. Richter later indicated that the company would lose too much money and changed the offer accordingly, while still maintaining donations to CSRG.

The company also had volume discount plans.

<doc id="490321" wikidata="Q1068751" url="?curid=490321" title="Kyoto School">
<text>The is the name given to the Japanese philosophical movement centered at Kyoto University that assimilated Western philosophy and religious ideas and used them to reformulate religious and moral insights unique to the East Asian philosophical tradition. However, it is also used to describe postwar scholars who have taught at the same university, been influenced by the foundational thinkers of Kyoto school philosophy, and who have developed distinctive theories of Japanese uniqueness. To disambiguate the term, therefore, thinkers and writers covered by this second sense appear under The Kyoto University Research Centre for the Cultural Sciences.

Beginning roughly in 1913 with Kitarō Nishida, it survived the serious controversy it garnered after World War II to develop into a well-known and active movement. However, it is not a &quot;school&quot; of philosophy in the traditional sense of the phrase, such as with the Frankfurt School or Plato&#x27;s Academy. Instead, the group of academics gathered around Kyoto University as a &quot;de facto&quot; meeting place. Its founder, Nishida, steadfastly encouraged independent thinking.

According to James Heisig, the name &quot;Kyoto School&quot; was first used in 1932 by a student of Nishida and Hajime Tanabe. Jun Tosaka considered himself to be part of the &#x27;Marxist left-wing&#x27; of the school. Afterwards, the media and academic institutions outside Japan began to use the term. By the 1970s it had become a universally accepted term.

==History==
Masao Abe writes in his introduction to a new English translation of Nishida&#x27;s magnum opus that if one thinks of philosophy in terms of Kant or Hegel, then there is no philosophy taking place in Japan. But if it is instead thought of in the tradition carried out by Augustine and Kierkegaard, then Japan has a rich philosophical history, composed of the great thinkers Kūkai, Shinran, Dōgen, and others.

The group of philosophers involved with the Kyoto School in its nearly 100-year history is a diverse one. Members often come from very different social backgrounds. At the same time, in the heat of intellectual debate they did not hesitate to criticise each other&#x27;s work.

The following criteria roughly characterize the features of this school:

#Teaching at Kyoto University or at a nearby affiliated school.
#Sharing some basic assumptions about using Asian thought in the framework of Western philosophical tradition.
#Introducing and rationally investigating the meaning of &quot;nothingness&quot; and its importance in the history of philosophical debate.
#Expanding on the philosophical vocabulary introduced by Nishida.

Generally, most were strongly influenced by the German philosophical tradition, especially the thought of Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, and Heidegger. In addition, many employed their cultural resources in formulating their philosophy and bringing it to play to add to the philosophical enterprise.

While their work was not expressly religious it was informed significantly by it. For example, Tanabe and Keiji Nishitani wrote on Christianity and Buddhism and identified common elements between the religions. For this reason, some scholars classify the intellectual products of the school as &quot;religious philosophy.&quot;

Although the group was fluid and largely informal, traditionally whoever occupied the Chair of the Department of Modern Philosophy at the University of Kyoto was considered its leader. Nishida was the first, from 1913 to 1928. Hajime Tanabe succeeded him until the mid-1930s. By this time, Nishitani had graduated from Kyoto University, studied with Martin Heidegger for two years in Germany, and returned to a teaching post since 1928. From 1955 to 1963, Nishitani officially occupied the Chair. Since his departure, leadership of the school crumbled — turning the movement into a very decentralized group of philosophers with common beliefs and interests.

==Significance of its notable members==
The significance of the group continues to grow, especially in American departments of religion and philosophy. Since the mid-1980s, there has been a growing interest in East/West dialogue, especially inter-faith scholarship. Masao Abe traveled to both coasts of the United States on professorships and lectured to many groups on Buddhist-Christian relations.

The Kyoto School of Philosophy also influenced education in Japan, giving rise to the Kyoto School of Education. Nishida had various writings such as &quot;On Education&quot; (1933) and deeply influenced his student, philosopher of education Kimura Motomori. Kimura in turn taught Mori Akira (also the student of Tanabe), who connected the Kyoto School&#x27;s ideas to pragmatism and moral education. Through these figures, the ideas of the Kyoto School spread to philosophy of education and even educational practice.

Although Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki was closely connected to the Kyoto School and in some ways critical to the development of thought that occurred there — he personally knew Nishida, Tanabe, and Nishitani — he is not considered a true member of the group.

===Kitaro Nishida===

Kitaro Nishida, the school&#x27;s founder, is most known for his groundbreaking work &quot;An Inquiry into the Good&quot; and later for his elucidation of the &quot;logic of &quot;basho&quot;&quot; (Japanese: 場所; usually translated as &quot;place,&quot; or the Greek τόπος &quot;topos&quot;). This brought him fame outside Japan and contributed largely to the attention later paid to philosophers from the Kyoto School.

Nishida&#x27;s work is notable for a few reasons. Chief among them is how much they are related to the German tradition of philosophy since Schopenhauer. The logic of basho is a non-dualistic &#x27;concrete&#x27; logic, meant to overcome the inadequacy of the subject-object distinction essential to the subject logic of Aristotle and the predicate logic of Kant, through the affirmation of what he calls the &#x27;absolutely contradictory self-identity&#x27; — a dynamic tension of opposites that, unlike the dialectical logic of Hegel, does not resolve in a synthesis. Rather, it defines its proper subject by maintaining the tension between affirmation and negation as opposite poles or perspectives.

Nishitani describes East Asian philosophy as something very different from what the Western tradition of Descartes, Leibniz or Hume would indicate.
Nishida wrote &quot;The Logic of Place and the Religious Worldview&quot;, developing more fully the religious implications of his work and philosophy through &quot;Absolute Nothingness,&quot; which &quot;contains its own absolute self-negation within itself.&quot; By this Nishida means that while the divine is dynamically paradoxical, it should not be construed as pantheism or transcendent theism.

Nishitani and Abe spent much of their academic lives dedicated to this development of nothingness and the Absolute, leading on occasion to &quot;panentheism&quot;.

===Hajime Tanabe===
===Keiji Nishitani===

Keiji Nishitani, one of Nishida&#x27;s main disciples, became the doyen in the post-war period. Nishitani&#x27;s works, such as his &quot;Religion and Nothingness&quot;, primarily dealt with the Western notion of nihilism, inherited from Nietzsche, and religious interpretation of nothingness, as found in the Buddhist idea of sunyata and the specifically Zen Buddhist concept of mu.

==Criticism==

Today, there is a great deal of critical research into the school&#x27;s role before and during the Second World War.

Hajime Tanabe bears the greatest brunt of the criticism for bringing his work on the &quot;Logic of Species&quot; into Japanese politics, which was used to buttress the militarist project to formulate imperialist ideology and propaganda. Tanabe&#x27;s notion is that the logical category of &quot;species&quot; and nation are equivalent, and each nation or &quot;species&quot; provides a fundamental set of characteristics which define and determine the lives and outlooks of those who participate in it.

<text>The hei-tiki (, ) is an ornamental pendant of the Māori of New Zealand. Hei-tiki are usually made of pounamu (greenstone), and are considered a taonga (treasure) by Māori. They are commonly called &quot;tiki&quot; by New Zealanders, a term that originally refers to the first mortal. (The word &quot;hei&quot; in Māori can mean &quot;to wear around the neck&quot;.)

Retailers sell tourist versions of hei-tiki throughout New Zealand—these can be made from jade, other types of stone, plastic, or other materials.

==Origins and materials ==

One theory of the origin of the hei-tiki suggests a connection with Tiki, the first man in Māori legend. According to Horatio Gordon Robley, there are two main ideas behind the symbolism of hei-tiki: they are either memorials to ancestors, or represent the goddess of childbirth, Hineteiwaiwa. The rationale behind the first theory is that they were often buried when their kaitiaki (guardian) died and retrieved later to be placed somewhere special and brought out in times of tangihanga (mourning and associated activities). Because of the connection with Hineteiwaiwa, hei-tiki were often given to a woman by her husband&#x27;s family if she was having trouble conceiving.

Robley, author of &quot;A History of the Maori Tiki&quot;, suggested a similarity of some tiki to images of Buddha, which were often fashioned in green jade. He believed they may have been a forgotten memory of these, in debased form.

The most valuable hei-tiki are carved from pounamu which is either nephrite or bowenite (Māori: tangiwai). Pounamu is esteemed highly by Māori for its beauty, toughness and great hardness; it is used not only for ornaments such as hei-tiki and ear pendants, but also for carving tools, adzes and weapons. Named varieties include translucent green &quot;kahurangi&quot;, whitish &quot;inanga&quot;, semi-transparent &quot;kawakawa&quot;, and &quot;tangiwai&quot; or bowenite.

A 2014 thesis by Dougal Austin supervised by Peter Adds, based on a survey of the collection of hei-tiki at Te Papa Tongarewa and early-contact examples in foreign collections, found that the mana of hei-tiki is derived from the &quot;agency of prolonged ancestral use&quot; and stylistically was &quot;highly developed ... from the outset to conform to adze-shaped pieces of pounamu.&quot;

Examples of hei-tiki are found in museum collections around the world. The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (over 200) and the British Museum (about 50) have two of the largest collections, many of which were exchanged or gifted to European travellers and sailors at the earliest point of contact between the two cultures.

== Types ==

Traditionally there were several types of hei-tiki which varied widely in form. Modern-day hei-tiki, however, may be divided into two types. The first type is rather delicate with a head/body ratio of approximately 30/70 and small details such as ears, elbows and knees. The head is on a tilt, with one hand placed on the thigh, and the other on the chest. The eyes are relatively small. The second type is generally heavier than the first. It has a 40/60 head/body ratio, both hands are on the thighs, and the eyes are proportionately larger.

==Manufacture==

From the size and style of traditional examples of hei-tiki, it is likely that the stone was first cut in the form of a small adze. The tilted head of the &quot;ptīau&quot; variety of hei-tiki derives from the properties of the stone – its hardness and great value make it important to minimize the amount of the stone that has to be removed. Creating a hei-tiki with traditional methods is a long, arduous process during which the stone is smoothed by abrasive rubbing; finally, using sticks and water, it is slowly shaped and the holes bored out. After laborious and lengthy polishing, the completed pendant is suspended by a plaited cord and secured by a loop and toggle.
==Current popularity==

Among the other &quot;taonga&quot; (treasured possessions) used as items of personal adornment are bone carvings in the form of earrings or necklaces. For many Māori the wearing of such items relates to Māori cultural identity. They are also popular with young New Zealanders of all backgrounds for whom the pendants relate to a more generalized sense of New Zealand identity. Several artistic collectives have been established by Māori tribal groups. These collectives have begun creating and exporting jewellery (such as bone carved pendants based on traditional fishhooks &quot;hei matau&quot; and other greenstone jewellery) and other artistic items (such as wood carvings and textiles). Several actors who have recently appeared in high-profile movies filmed in New Zealand have come back wearing such jewellery, including Viggo Mortensen of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; fame who took to wearing a &quot;hei matau&quot; around his neck. These trends have contributed towards a worldwide interest in traditional Māori culture and arts such as Kiri Nathan including pounamu jewellery in her 2013 London Fashion Week exhibition.

The captain of HMS &quot;New Zealand&quot;, a battlecruiser funded in 1911 by the government of New Zealand for the defence of the British Empire and which took an active part in three battles of the First World War, wore into battle a hei-tiki (as well as a piupiu, Māori warrior&#x27;s skirt). The crew attributed to this the &quot;New Zealand&quot; being a &quot;lucky ship&quot; which sustained no casualties during the entire war.

==In popular culture==
The mockumentary film &quot;Hei Tiki&quot; was released in 1935, with a &quot;New York Times&quot; review describing the plot as being about a &quot;chieftain&#x27;s daughter who is declared tabu and destined to be the bride of the war god&quot;, attributing the title to mean &quot;love charm&quot; (a Hei-tiki pendant interpretation).

The crime writer Ngaio Marsh gives prominence to an amuletic hei-tiki (which she calls simply a tiki) in her 1937 novel &quot;Vintage Murder&quot;. She emphasises its aspect as a promoter of fertility.

<text>Cirque Corporation is an American company which developed and commercialized the first successful capacitive touchpad, now widely used in notebook computers. Cirque develops and sells a variety of touch input products, both in original equipment manufacturer and end-user retail form. Cirque was founded in 1991 by George E. Gerpheide, PhD, and James L. O&#x27;Callaghan, to commercialize the GlidePoint technology invented in the 1980s by Gerpheide.

==History==
For many years, Gerpheide and O&#x27;Callaghan traveled in an attempt to convince makers of notebook computer to agree to use GlidePoint. Gerpheide recalls &quot;We would often drive to the COMDEX trade show in Las Vegas and stay in a seedy hotel. There wasn&#x27;t money for a booth at the show, so we carried our GlidePoint prototypes around the convention center making demonstrations to whoever was willing to watch. The early prototypes had a suitcase full of electronic circuits. I knew they could be shrunk into an integrated circuit, but we didn&#x27;t have money for that either. So we were seeking a large leap of faith for a manufacturer to agree to use the technology. It was even worse because at that time most notebook computers were running DOS, which did not need a pointing device!&quot;

In April 1994, Cirque adapted GlidePoint into an integrated circuit and began selling a retail GlidePoint touchpad. The first notebook computer containing GlidePoint appeared soon thereafter. GlidePoint technology was licensed to Alps Electric Co., Ltd., and Alps launched touchpad products into the market.

In 2003, Cirque was acquired by Alps Electric as a wholly owned subsidiary. Cirque continues to function as an independent research and technology development facility.

==Technology==

GlidePoint&lt;br&gt;
GlidePoint was the first touchpad technology to be adopted in notebook computers as a system pointing device, that is, performing the same function as a mouse. Before that, system pointing was performed mostly using a small trackball embedded in the notebook computer case, and other mechanical devices. After GlidePoint&#x27;s commercial introduction in April 1994, its popularity in notebook computers steadily increased and Synaptics and Logitech also introduced capacitive touchpad technologies. , both Synaptics and GlidePoint touchpads are used widely, with approximately 90% of notebook computers using touchpads.

GlidePoint was not the first touch input technology. For example, it was pre-dated by resistive membrane input pads such as used in the Model 3155 Keyboard from Keytronic. Transparent resistive membrane technology is used in personal digital assistants such as the PalmPilot, point of sale terminals, video poker machines, and information kiosks and other touch screens. There are also prior capacitive touch input pads in the patent literature. One, &quot;The UnMouse&quot; was invented by James Logan and marketed by his company Microtouch Systems, Inc. as a retail plug-in mouse alternative product in the 1980s, but discontinued after a few years.

GlidePoint technology senses the presence and absolute position of a finger on the pad&#x27;s surface using capacitive techniques. Because of the capacitive technique, it does not require electrical contact with the finger, nor does it require the finger to exert pressure on the pad. It measures very small capacitance changes, due to a finger&#x27;s proximity, among electrodes in a grid buried beneath the insulating surface of the pad. From these measurements, it can determine if a finger is touching the pad, and if so, the finger&#x27;s absolute position horizontally and vertically on the surface. Subtraction of a preceding absolute position from the present absolute position yields the relative motion of the finger during that time. This relative motion is the same as a mouse for controlling the position of a computer screen cursor.

GlideSensor&lt;br&gt;
Cirque GlideSensor solutions are an extension of GlidePoint capacitive touch technology. They are configured to allow the rapid design of non-conventional touch input products. GlideSensor touch arrays may now be designed to take the form of thin films, flexible surfaces and irregular shapes.

GlideSensor&#x27;s mixed-mode ASIC controller was designed to blend the performance of GlidePoint with a low-voltage, low-power EEPROM programmable processor. The result is a touch controller capable of being rapidly configured to solve the most unusual input application.

Key GlideSensor technology features at a glance include: 
*Design sensors in circular, linear, flexible shapes
*Programmable controller for custom solutions
*Interfaced by SPI, I2C or PS2 for easy integration to microprocessor and PC-based systems
*Efficient low-power management
*Can sense through plastic materials of many colors
*Ideal for handheld portable battery-operated products

==Products==
Cirque&#x27;s Circle Trackpad Development Kit is Arduino based and uses open sourced code on GitHub. VR Grip™ is a technology platform that was featured at CES 2018.

==Awards==
*&quot;Best Products of 1994.&quot; &quot;PC Magazine&quot;. 10 January 1995, GlidePoint Touchpad, recognized as one of six best products on the cover.
*The company was twice recognized as one of the 500 fastest growing private company in America, &quot;The 1997 Ranking of the Fastest-Growing Private Companies in America.&quot; Inc. Magazine v. 15 no. 19 p. 149.

<doc id="490334" wikidata="Q1931577" url="?curid=490334" title="Thrombolysis">
<text>Thrombolysis, also called fibrinolytic therapy, is the breakdown (lysis) of blood clots formed in blood vessels, using medication. It is used in ST elevation myocardial infarction, stroke, and in cases of severe venous thromboembolism (massive pulmonary embolism or extensive deep vein thrombosis).

The main complication is bleeding (which can be dangerous), and in some situations thrombolysis may therefore be unsuitable. Thrombolysis can also play an important part in reperfusion therapy that deals specifically with blocked arteries.

==Medical uses==
Diseases where thrombolysis is used:
* ST elevation myocardial infarction: Large trials have shown that mortality can be reduced using thrombolysis (particularly fibrinolysis) in treating heart attacks. It works by stimulating secondary fibrinolysis by plasmin through infusion of analogs of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the protein that normally activates plasmin.
* Stroke: Thrombolysis reduces major disability or death when given within 3 hours (or perhaps even 6 hours) of ischaemic stroke onset when there are no contraindications to treatment.
* Massive pulmonary embolism. For the treatment of a massive pulmonary embolism, &quot;catheter-directed therapy&quot; is a safer and more effective alternative to systemic thrombolysis. This involves the injecting of drugs directly into the clot.
* Severe deep vein thrombosis (DVT), such as phlegmasia cerulea dolens, which threatens limb loss, or iliofemoral DVT, where clots involve at a minimum the common iliac vein
* Acute limb ischaemia
* Clotted hemothorax

Thrombolysis is usually intravenous. It may also be used directly into the affected blood vessel during an angiogram (intra-arterial thrombolysis), e.g. when patients present with stroke beyond three hours or in severe deep vein thrombosis (catheter-directed thrombolysis).

Thrombolysis is performed by many types of medical specialists, including interventional radiologists, vascular surgeons, cardiologists, interventional neuroradiologists, and neurosurgeons. In some countries such as the United States of America, emergency medical technicians may administer thrombolytics for heart attacks in prehospital settings, by on-line medical direction. In countries with more extensive and independent qualifications, prehospital thrombolysis (fibrinolysis) may be initiated by the emergency care practitioner (ECP). Other countries which employ ECP&#x27;s include, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand. Prehospital thrombolysis is always the result of a risk-benefit calculation of the heart attack, thrombolysis risks, and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) availability.

==Contraindications==
Thrombolysis is not without risks. Therefore, clinicians must select patients who are to be best suited for the procedure, and those who have the least risk of having a fatal complication. An absolute contraindication is in itself enough to avoid thrombolysis, while a relative contraindication needs to be considered in relation to the overall clinical situation.

=== Myocardial infarction ===
Absolute contraindications:
* Any previous history of hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke within 3 months.
* History of stroke, dementia, or central nervous system damage within 1 year
* Head trauma within 3 weeks or brain surgery within 6 months
* Known intracranial neoplasm
* Suspected aortic dissection
* Internal bleeding within 6 weeks
* Active bleeding or known bleeding disorder
* Traumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation within 3 weeks

Relative contraindications:
* Oral anticoagulant therapy
* Acute pancreatitis
* Pregnancy or within 1 week postpartum
* Active peptic ulceration
* Transient ischemic attack within 6 months

* Puncture of noncompressible blood vessel within 2 weeks
* Previous streptokinase therapy
* Major surgery, trauma, or bleeding within 2 weeks

=== Stroke ===
Absolute contraindications:
* Uncertainty about time of stroke onset (e.g. patients awakening from sleep).
* Coma or severe obtundation with fixed eye deviation and complete hemiplegia.
* Hypertension: systolic blood pressure ≥ 185mmHg; or diastolic blood pressure &gt;110mmHg on repeated measures prior to study (if reversed, patient can be treated).
* Clinical presentation suggestive of subarachnoid haemorrhage even if the CT scan is normal.
* Presumed septic embolus.

* INR &gt;1.7
* Known advanced liver disease, advanced right heart failure, or anticoagulation, and INR &gt; 1.5 (no need to wait for INR result in the absence of the former three conditions).
* Known platelet count &lt;100,000 uL.
* Serum glucose is &lt; 2.8 mmol/L or &gt;22.0 mmol/L.

Relative contraindications:
* Severe neurological impairment with NIHSS score &gt;22.
* Age &gt;80 years.
* CT evidence of extensive middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarction (sulcal effacement or blurring of grey-white junction in greater than 1/3 of MCA territory).
* Stroke or serious head trauma within the past three months where the risks of bleeding are considered to outweigh the benefits of therapy.
* Major surgery within the last 14 days (consider intra-arterial thrombolysis).
* Patient has a known history of intracranial haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, known intracranial arteriovenous malformation or previously known intracranial neoplasm
* Suspected recent (within 30 days) myocardial infarction.
* Recent (within 30 days) biopsy of a parenchymal organ or surgery that, in the opinion of the responsible clinician, would increase the risk of unmanageable (e.g. uncontrolled by local pressure) bleeding.
* Recent (within 30 days) trauma with internal injuries or ulcerative wounds.
* Gastrointestinal or urinary tract haemorrhage within the last 30 days or any active or recent haemorrhage that, in the opinion of the responsible clinician, would increase the risk of unmanageable (e.g. by local pressure) bleeding.
* Arterial puncture at non-compressible site within the last 7 days.
* Concomitant serious, advanced or terminal illness or any other condition that, in the opinion of the responsible clinician would pose an unacceptable risk.
* Minor or Rapidly improving deficit.
* Seizure: If the presenting neurological deficit is deemed due to a seizure.
* Pregnancy is not an absolute contraindication. Consider intra-arterial thrombolysis.

==Side-effects==
Hemorrhagic stroke is a rare but serious complication of thrombolytic therapy. If a patient has had thrombolysis before, an allergy against the thrombolytic drug may have developed (especially after streptokinase). If the symptoms are mild, the infusion is stopped and the patient is commenced on an antihistamine before infusion is recommenced. Anaphylaxis generally requires immediate cessation of thrombolysis.

==Agents==
Thrombolysis therapy uses thrombolytic drugs that dissolve blood clots. Most of these drugs target fibrin (one of the main constituent of blood clots) and are therefore called fibrinolytics. All currently approved thrombolytic drugs are biologics, either derived from &quot;Streptococcus&quot; species, or, more recently, using recombinant biotechnology whereby tPA is manufactured using cell culture, resulting in a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator or rtPA.

Some fibrinolytics are:
* Streptokinase (Kabikinase)
* Urokinase
* Recombinant tissue plasminogen activators (rtPA)
** Alteplase (Activase or Actilyse)
** Reteplase (Retavase)
** Tenecteplase
** Anistreplase (Eminase)

==Catheter-directed thrombolysis==
A 2023 meta-analysis of 44 studies compared treatments for pulmonary embolism including thrombolytic therapy delivered through a catheter. Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) methods included fragmentation and ultrasound use. CDT was associated with better outcomes than anticoagulation alone or systemic thrombolysis, but the studies were mostly small and observational.

In people who receive CDT, there is a risk of hemorrhage as a side effect. Scientists have studied whether measuring fibrinogen in blood can be used as a biomarker to predict hemorrhage. As of 2017 it was not known if this works or not.

==Research==
Researchers showed a 10-fold variation in the proportion of patients who received thrombolysis after stroke in England and Wales, ranging from 1 in 50 (2%) to 1 in 4 (24%). The team also showed that most of the variation was explained by hospital processes (such as how quickly people can have a brain scan) and in doctors’ decision-making (who they think should or should not receive thrombolysis) rather than knowledge of the time of stroke. 

Prospective, randomized clinical trials to evaluate the utility of catheter-directed thrombolysis in pulmonary embolism include HI-PEITHO (Higher-Risk Pulmonary Embolism Thrombolysis).

<text>In the anatomy of animals, paleoencephalon refers to most regions in the brain that are not part of the neocortex or neoencephalon.

The paleoencephalon is the phylogenetically oldest part of the animal brain. Paleoenchepheal areas of older species are larger in proportion to overall brain volume as compared to those of mammals.
The Paleocortex is a type of thin, primitive cortical tissue that consists of three to five cortical laminae. In comparison, the neocortex has six layers and the archicortex has three or four layers.

<text>The Peace Palace ( ; ) is an international law administrative building in The Hague, the Netherlands. It houses the International Court of Justice (which is the principal judicial body of the United Nations), the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA), The Hague Academy of International Law and the Peace Palace Library.

The palace officially opened on 28 August 1913; it was originally built to provide a home for the PCA, a court created to end war by the Hague Convention of 1899. Andrew Dickson White, whose efforts were instrumental in creating the court, secured from Scottish-American steel magnate Andrew Carnegie US$1.5 million ($, adjusted for inflation) to build the Peace Palace. The European Heritage Label was awarded to the Peace Palace on 8 April 2014.

== History ==
===Background===
In 1908, Thomas Hayton Mawson won a competition to design the grounds. Because of budget constraints, he also had to discard design elements: mountains and sculptures. He made use of a natural watercourse on the site.

===Conception===
The idea of the palace started from a discussion in 1900 between the Russian diplomat Friedrich Martens and American diplomat White over providing a home for the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA). White contacted Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie had reservations, and at first was only interested in donating money for the establishment of a library of international law. White, however, was able to convince Carnegie, and in 1903 Carnegie agreed to donate the US$1.5 million ($, adjusted for inflation) needed to house the court as well as to endow it with a library of international law. White described his idea to Carnegie:

&quot;A temple of peace where the doors are open, in contrast to the Janus-temple, in times of peace and closed in cases of war [...] as a worthy testimony of the people that, after many long centuries finally a court that has thrown open its doors for the peaceful settlement of differences between peoples&quot;.
Were such a fabric to be created, men would make pilgrimages from all parts of the civilized world to see it. It would become a sort of holy place, prized and revered by thinking men throughout the world, and to which, in any danger of war between any two countries, the minds of men would turn naturally and normally. The main difficulty now is that the people of the various nations do not really know what was done for them by the Conference; but such a building would make them know it. It would be an &quot;outward and visible sign&quot; of the Court, which would make its actual, tangible existence known to the ends of the earth&quot;
:—Andrew Dickson White to Andrew Carnegie, 5 August 1902

At first Carnegie simply wanted to donate the money directly to the Dutch Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands for the building of the palace, but legal problems prohibited this, and in November 1903 the Carnegie Stichting was founded to manage the construction, ownership, and maintenance of the palace. This foundation is still responsible for these issues.

===Construction===

To find a suitable design, the foundation called for an open international competition. The winning design, set in the Neo-Renaissance style, was submitted by French architect Louis M. Cordonnier. To build within budget, Cordonnier and his Dutch associate J.A.G. van der Steur adjusted the design. The palace initially had two big bell towers in front and two small ones in the back. Only one big tower and one small tower remained in the final building. Also to save money, the separate library building from the winning design was incorporated into the palace itself.

The palace is filled with many gifts of the different nations who attended the Second Hague Conference as a sign of their support. Among the gifts are a vase from Russia, doors from Belgium, marble from Italy, a fountain from Denmark, wall carpets from Japan, the clock for the clock tower from Switzerland, Persian rugs from Persia, wood from Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil and the United States of America and wrought-iron fences from Germany.

In 1907, the first stone was symbolically placed during the Second Hague Conference. The construction began some months later and was completed with an inauguration ceremony on 28 August 1913, attended by Andrew Carnegie, among others. At the ceremony, Carnegie predicted that the end of war was &quot;as certain to come, and come soon, as day follows night.&quot;

In 2007, Queen Beatrix opened the new building for the Peace Palace Library of International Law, housing the entire catalogue of the library, a lecture hall and a new reading room in the bridge to the main building of the Peace Palace. Like the new Academy Hall, the library was designed by architects Michael Wilford and . A Visitors Centre was added to the Peace Palace in 2012, which is also designed by Michael Wilford.

In 2002, an eternal peace flame was installed in front of its gates.

==Occupants==
The Peace Palace has accommodated a variety of organisations:

* Permanent Court of Arbitration (1913–present) The original occupant for which the Peace Palace was constructed. From 1901 until the opening of the palace in 1913, the Permanent Court of Arbitration was housed at Prinsegracht 71 in The Hague.
* Permanent Court of International Justice (1922–1946) and its successor the International Court of Justice (1946–present). In 1922 the Permanent Court of International Justice of the League of Nations was added to the occupants. This meant the library was forced to move to an annex building, and the Permanent Court of Arbitration was moved to the front left of the building. In 1946, when the United Nations replaced the League of Nations, the International Court of Justice was established as the UN&#x27;s principal judicial organ.
* Peace Palace Library of International Law (1913–present). Being the original vision of Carnegie, the library grew quickly to house the best collection of material on international law. Although this stature is well in the past, the library still contains some original classical works, as the original copies of Hugo Grotius&#x27; works on peace and law and Erasmus&#x27; &quot;Querela Pacis&quot;.
* The Carnegie Stichting (1913–present)
* The Hague Academy of International Law (1923–present). Established in 1914, strongly advocated by Tobias Michael Carel Asser. Funds for the academy came from another peace project by Andrew Carnegie, namely the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, established in 1910.

Other international courts in The Hague, the Iran–United States Claims Tribunal, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and the International Criminal Court, are separate organizations, located elsewhere in The Hague.

==Interior==

The palace also features a number of statues, busts and portraits of prominent peace campaigners from around the world and of all eras.

<doc id="490353" wikidata="Q1740086" url="?curid=490353" title="Kevin Bloody Wilson">
<text>Kevin Bloody Wilson (born Dennis Bryant; 13 February 1947) is an Australian musical comedian who performs comical songs with his heavy Australian English accent and often including sexual themes. He has won one ARIA Music Award.

==Early career==
Bryant was born in Bathurst, although he identifies with Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, where he was an electrician in the gold mines.

In the 1970s, Bryant fronted his own band called &#x27;Bryan Dennis and the Country Club&#x27;. He also used the name &#x27;Bryan Dennis&#x27; when he hosted a country music show on radio 6KG in Kalgoorlie from 1973 to 1980, before he was thrown off air for playing the parody song, &quot;I&#x27;m Heaving on a Jet Plane&quot;.

He moved to Perth and began playing bawdy songs as a hobby, singing at pubs and Australian rules football clubs. He had adopted the name Kevin Bloody Wilson by 1984, when he put together a cassette of his songs called &quot;Your Average Australian Yobbo&quot;, which he sold at gigs and by mail order. He managed to sell 22,000 copies of the cassette before it was eventually transferred to LP, where it went on to sell many thousands more.

He is one of Perth&#x27;s most famous comedians. His humour is regarded by media commentators as politically incorrect.
As one of Australia&#x27;s most successful comedians, he continues to tour and performs an average of 120 concerts worldwide each year.

Wilson is married and his wife Betty comes on tour with him. She sells merchandise at shows and has appeared on guest vocals in a few of his songs, including &quot;Dick&#x27;taphone&quot;.

Wilson appeared on the popular television show &quot;Enough Rope&quot; with Andrew Denton in October 2008, which resulted in the show&#x27;s highest ratings of the year. On the show, he told of how he met his wife Betty, who was originally from Kalgoorlie, but lived in Perth at the time they met. She had returned to the town to visit friends and her brother who still lived there and they met when she attended one of his shows. Betty, who was in the studio audience, told Denton that Wilson was a romantic who regularly bought her flowers.

&quot;The Genie in the Bottle&quot;, a country song which Wilson co-wrote with Adam Harvey, spent more than six weeks on the Australian Country Singles chart as well as reaching the number one video spot on the Country Music Television Channel in 2008.

==Discography==
===Studio albums===
===Live albums===
===Compilation albums===
His songs generally consist of irreverent humour and plenty of swearing with eclectic musical backing.

==ARIA Awards==
He has been nominated five times for the ARIA Award for Best Comedy Release at the ARIA Music Awards:
|-
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | 1987
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | &quot;Kev&#x27;s Back&quot;

==Website==
Wilson was the first Australian performing artist to have a website which a friend set up for him in 1993, which has since been a major source of album and product sales. He also runs an internet radio station kevfm.com, which was the first 24-hour adult comedy radio station.

==Daughter==
Tammy Jo &quot;Jenny Talia&quot; Bryant has followed in her father&#x27;s footsteps singing similarly bawdy songs, some of them being reworded Kev songs, but done from a female perspective.

<doc id="490363" wikidata="Q4828561" url="?curid=490363" title="Avian pallium">
<text>In the neuroanatomy of animals, an avian pallium is the dorsal telencephalon of a bird&#x27;s brain. The subpallium is the ventral telencephalon.

The pallium of avian species tends to be relatively large, comprising ~75% of the telencephalic volume. Birds have a unique pallial structure known as the hyperpallium, once called the &quot;hyperstriatum&quot;. Evidence suggests the avian pallium&#x27;s neuroarchitecture to be reminiscent of the mammalian cerebral cortex. The avian pallium has also been suggested to be an equivalent neural basis for consciousness.

A 2002 conference at Duke University (Avian Brain Nomenclature Consortium) established a standard nomenclature for describing the avian pallium as follows:

*Pallium
**Pyriform cortex
**Olfactory bulb
**Hippocampus
**Corticoid area
**Hyperpallium
***Apicale
***Intercalatum
***Densocellulare
**Mesopallium

<doc id="490364" wikidata="Q3656780" url="?curid=490364" title="Cape Wrath (TV series)">
<text>Cape Wrath (also known as Meadowlands) is a British thriller drama television series, created by Robert Murphy and Matthew Arlidge, that first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 10 July 2007 on Channel 4. Produced by Ecosse Films, the series focuses on the Brogan family, who are trying to escape their past while confronting an even more uncertain future.

The series was a co-production between Channel 4 in the UK and Showtime in the United States, where it received its world première on 17 June 2007, at 22:00 EST. During its original broadcast on Showtime, the series was accompanied by an interactive online experience, which following each episode, featured exclusive content detailing the background of a specific character from their life before they moved to Meadowlands, including their real name.

Due to low ratings, Channel 4 executives confirmed that a second series would not be commissioned. The complete series was released on Region 2 DVD on 27 August 2007. A quiz based upon the series is available to play on FunTrivia.

==Plot==
The series opens with Danny (David Morrissey) and Evelyn Brogan (Lucy Cohu) and their two teenage children, Zoe (Felicity Jones) and Mark (Harry Treadaway), entering a witness protection programme and moving to a bucolic neighbourhood known as Meadowlands to begin a new life. Picturesque and crime-free, Meadowlands appears to be a suburban paradise where the Brogan family can start a new life. However, they soon realise that it is not so easy to escape the past, and their haven becomes a world of paranoia and psychological intrigue with shocking surprises around every corner, especially the particularly stunning revelation that they can never leave.

==Production==
The series was filmed in Kent. Many of the interior sets were built in a warehouse close to The Maidstone Studios. The estate itself is in fact The Lakes, a new housing development built next to Leybourne Lakes Country Park. Kings Hill features as the local town centre. Other locations include The Kings Hill Golf Course, Wye College and Maidstone Leisure Centre.

<doc id="490378" wikidata="Q39663" url="?curid=490378" title="Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin">
<text>The Eurocopter, later Airbus Helicopters AS365 Dauphin, originally known as the Aérospatiale SA 365 Dauphin 2, is a medium-weight multipurpose twin-engine helicopter produced by Airbus Helicopters. It was originally developed and manufactured by French firm Aérospatiale, which was merged into the multinational Eurocopter company during the 1990s, and since 2014 Eurocopter was renamed Airbus Helicopters. Since entering production in 1975, the type has been in continuous production for more than 40 years, with the last delivery in 2021. The intended successor to the Dauphin is the Airbus Helicopters H160, which entered operational service in 2021.

The Dauphin 2 shares many similarities with the Aérospatiale SA 360, a commercially unsuccessful single-engine helicopter; however the twin-engine Dauphin 2 did meet with customer demand and has been operated by a wide variety of civil and military operators. Since the type&#x27;s introduction in the 1970s, several major variations and specialised versions of the Dauphin 2 have been developed and entered production, including the military-oriented Eurocopter Panther, the air-sea rescue HH/MH-65 Dolphin, the Chinese-manufactured Harbin Z-9, and the Eurocopter EC155.

==Development==
The SA 365/AS365 Dauphin 2 is a twin-engine development of the commercially unsuccessful single-engined Aérospatiale SA 360 Dauphin; only a year after the SA 360&#x27;s entry into service, Aerospatiale had recognized that a platform powered by two engines rather than one was better suited to both civil and military operations, thus a redesign program was initiated. On 24 January 1975, the first twin-engine Dauphin prototype performed its first flight; the prototype soon demonstrated an airspeed of 170 knots in level flight and set multiple speed records, among them the Paris-London trip at an average of 321 km/h.
The initial production variant entered service under the original designation of SA 365C; French certification of this model was received in July 1978, with US FAA and British CAA certification following later that year. Deliveries to customers began in December 1978. In 1982, the SA 356C Dauphin was succeeded by the more capable SA 365 N. Amongst several major design changes and improvements, the SA 365 N featured more powerful engines, greater use of composite materials, a better cabin arrangement, and retractable landing gear.

Further improvements were made with the introduction of the SA 365 N1, which had a substantially redesigned Fenestron anti-torque device, and with the SA 365 N2, which was equipped with more powerful Turbomeca Arriel 1C2 turboshaft engines. In January 1990, the overall type was formally redesignated as the AS365. The AS365 Dauphin is one of Eurocopter&#x27;s more successful helicopter designs; and has been widely used as a corporate transport, airborne law enforcement platform, emergency medical services (EMS) helicopter, electronic news gathering platform, and search and rescue helicopter.

The base Dauphin has been further developed into several purpose-built variants. During the 1980s, the SA 365 N was used as the basis for a militarised version of the Dauphin, initially designed as AS 365 K, which was used to perform utility, troop-transport, and maritime operations, widely known as the Eurocopter Panther. A variant of the Dauphin was specifically developed for and operated principally by the United States Coast Guard under the designation HH/MH-65 Dolphin. The SA 365 M model of the Dauphin has also been manufactured under licence in China as the Z-9 by the Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation; the Z-9 was subsequently developed into the armed Z-9W and Z-19 attack helicopter.

==Design==

The AS365 Dauphin is a twin-engine helicopter capable of travelling long ranges, and well suited to operating in climates of a high ambient temperature or at locations of significant altitude. The Dauphin is typically powered by a pair of Turbomeca Arriel turboshaft engines; on later variants, these are equipped with FADEC units, which provide additional functionality such as an automated start-up sequence and a training mode. The engines drive the rotorcraft&#x27;s foldable Starflex main rotor and its Fenestron anti-torque tail rotor via two separate transmissions; these gearboxes are also connected to two separate hydraulic systems as well as a stand-by hydraulic system for emergency use, such as deployment of the landing gear. Electrical power is provided by a pair of starter generators and a NiCad (Nickel-Cadmium) main battery; an emergency battery is also present. The combination of the rotorcraft&#x27;s Starflex main rotor and Fenestron tail provides a low-noise and low-vibration flight experience for those on board; Airbus Helicopters has claimed the sound emissions of the AS365 N3 to be 3.1 decibels below International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, making it the quietest helicopter in its class. The Dauphin can take off under a full load from sea level under Category A conditions.
The main fuselage of the rotorcraft comprises the cabin area, a separate luggage compartment, and a retractable tricycle landing gear arrangement; a total of four conventional doors to access the main cabin are typically installed, which can be optionally replaced by a single clamshell air stair entrance instead. Various portions of the rotorcraft are made from composite materials, such as the rotor blades that made of carbon fiber, other materials are used in portions of the fuselage. The fuselage features anti-corrosion protection and is structurally reinforced for an optional hoist or cargo sling to be installed, various other mooring and gripping points are also fitted on the rotocraft&#x27;s exterior surface. Various types and models of radar can be installed in the Dauphin&#x27;s nose.

The main cabin area is designed to be reconfigurable, a feature which is promoted to emergency medical service (EMS) and search and rescue (SAR) operators. In a regular passenger transport layout, the cabin can accommodate up to 12 passengers in addition to the two pilots; up to seven passengers can be accommodated in a VIP layout. Access to the cabin is via large sliding doors on either side of the helicopter, built-in boarding steps are typically installed to ease the boarding of passengers.

While the cockpit is typically equipped with dual flight controls for two-man operations, the Dauphin can be readily flown by a single pilot while operating under instrument flight rules; this was achieved in part by avionics such as the 4-axis Dual Digital Automatic Flight Control System (older production aircraft use a 3-axis flight control system with integrated autopilot instead) to reduce crew workload. The principal flight control system are connected to a total of 3 dual-chamber primary servo-units for cyclical and collective pitch control, and a single dual-chamber rear servo-unit for tail rotor pitch control. Other major avionics include multi-mission touch screen displays, weather radar, global positioning system (GPS) receiver, traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS), automatic voice alarm device (AVAD), health and usage monitoring system (HUMS), quick access records for helicopter flight data management, and digital audio communication system (DACS).

==Operational history==
In February 1980, the first series production Dauphin was used to break three separate speed-related world records in separate journeys between Battersea, London, United Kingdom and Issy-les-Moulineaux, Paris, France. In 1985, a new model of the Dauphin, the AS365 F, became the first rotorcraft in the world to fly with flight instruments being displayed in electronic displays, which replaced the traditional instrumentation; this variant was first procured by the Irish Air Corps for SAR operations.

The French Navy operated the Dauphin, in addition to the dedicated military-orientated Panther variant, to conduct various missions such as the &quot;Dauphin Service Public &quot; which involves various duties from seaborne SAR, maritime monitoring, and responding to distress calls. French Navy Dauphins are commonly deployed on board the aircraft carrier &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; as well as onboard other vessels of the French Navy and allies; they are fitted with a haul-down &quot;Harpoon&quot; in order to ease shipboard landings in rough weather.
By 1980, a total of 265 AS360/361/365 Dauphins had been delivered, 90% of these deliveries were to foreign customers in a total of 23 different nations. Amongst the biggest early customers for the type was Saudi Arabia, which ordered 24 Dauphins, and Angola, with an order for 17 Dauphins. The largest civil customers of the type has been Indian operator Pawan Hans, who by 2003 had a fleet of 19 Dauphins (nearly two-thirds of their total rotary fleet) and were in the process of procuring another 1 Dauphins to allow older aircraft to be phased out; they have been frequently used to support offshore oil extraction activities.

In February 1991, it was announced that the 500th Dauphin had been delivered to Bond Helicopters, who at that time operated a total of 15 of the type, with additional Dauphins on order. By 1991, the Dauphin was being operated by 138 customers across casi 45 nations. In December 2006, Eurocopter president Fabrice Brégier stated that between 30 and 40 Dauphins were being delivered each year. By 2012, more than 1,000 AS365/366/565 versions had been produced; Pawan Hans took delivery of the 1,000th Dauphin produced in April 2011, at which point the type was reportedly in service with over 300 operators worldwide.

Prior to the 2004 Summer Olympics, five AS 356N3 Dauphins were procured for the Hellenic Coast Guard for harbor surveillance purposes. Between 2009 and 2012, the Army Air Corps of the United Kingdom took delivery of five Dauphins, these were assigned to No. 658 Squadron AAC to replace four AgustaWestland A109 helicopters being used to support Special Air Service (SAS) operations.

, the AS365 N variant of the Dauphin holds the world speed record for a course, set at in 1991.

<text>Levi Day Boone (December 6, 1808 – January 24, 1882) served as mayor of Chicago, Illinois (1855–1856) for the American Party (Know-Nothings).

==Early life==

Boone was born near Lexington, Kentucky, the seventh son of Squire and Anna Grubbs Boone. Squire Boone, Sr. was Daniel Boone&#x27;s father and Levi Boone&#x27;s great-grandfather, making Levi Boone Daniel Boone&#x27;s great-nephew. Young Levi lost his father at the age of 9 when Squire finally succumbed to wounds which he incurred at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend.

Despite the poverty the family was plunged into by the death of Squire Boone, Levi graduated from the medical school of Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky in 1829 at the age of 21. He moved to Illinois and eventually established a practice in Hillsboro. In 1832, he served in the Black Hawk War, first in the cavalry and then as a surgeon. In 1833, Dr. Boone married Louise M. Smith, daughter of Theophilus W. Smith, Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court, with whom he had 11 children.

==Chicago years==

Arriving in Chicago in 1835, he helped organize the Cook County Medical Board and served as the organization&#x27;s first secretary. Boone had a medical practice with Charles V. Dyer. He was elected the first president of the Chicago Medical Society in 1850.

In 1843, he contributed to the rift in the congregation of Chicago&#x27;s First Baptist Church by giving a lecture on the scriptural basis of slavery.

In 1850, Boone unsuccessfully ran for Mayor of Chicago. He placed second, receiving 32.90% of the vote (losing to James Curtiss, who received 45.51% of the vote).

Running a second time, Boone was elected mayor in the 1855 Chicago mayoral election. Supported by a coalition of Know Nothings and temperance advocates, Boone ran for mayor on an anti-immigrant platform, along with 7 aldermen running on the same ticket. He defeated incumbent Isaac Lawrence Milliken with nearly 53% of the vote.

During his only year in office, he reorganized the Chicago police, combining the Day Police and the Night Watch into a single police force with 3 eight-hour shifts and requiring the police, for the first time, to wear uniforms. No foreign-born police were retained in the reorganization, and all new appointments were native-born Americans. He barred all immigrants from city jobs. 

Though not a teetotaler, Boone was a temperance advocate and worked to prohibit the sale and consumption of alcohol. Anticipating the passage by referendum of a Maine law to prohibit the sale of beverage alcohol in June 1855, he got the city council to pass an ordinance that raised the cost of liquor licenses from $50 to $300 a year, limited the term to three months, and attempted to enforce an old and disregarded ordinance to close taverns on Sundays. Many saw this as a means of attacking German immigrants, and on April 21, the move sparked the Lager Beer Riot after several tavern owners were arrested for selling beer on a Sunday. The referendum failed in June 1855, by a statewide vote of 54% to 46%.

Boone did not run for re-election in the mayoral election of 1856.

In 1862, Boone was arrested and briefly held in Camp Douglas on suspicion that he had helped a Confederate prisoner to escape.

He died in Chicago on January 24, 1882, and is buried in Rosehill Cemetery.

<text>Colonel Sir Ernest Edward &quot;Weary&quot; Dunlop, (12 July 1907 – 2 July 1993) was an Australian surgeon who was renowned for his leadership while being held prisoner by the Japanese during the Second World War.

==Early life and family==
Dunlop was born in Wangaratta, Victoria, the second of two children of parents James and Alice. He attended Benalla High School for two years of his education. He started an apprenticeship in pharmacy when he finished school, and moved to Melbourne in 1927. There, he studied at the Victorian College of Pharmacy and then the University of Melbourne, where he obtained a scholarship in medicine. Dunlop graduated from the University of Melbourne in 1934 with first class honours in pharmacy and in medicine, and excelled as a sportsman at Melbourne University and Ormond College. The nickname &quot;Weary&quot; was a reference to his last name—&quot;tired&quot; like a Dunlop tyre.

==Rugby union career==

Although brought up playing Australian Rules football, when at university – and although still playing &quot;Aussie Rules&quot;, as a ruckman for Ormond College – Dunlop took up rugby union; commencing as a fourth grade player with the Melbourne University Rugby Club in 1931. He rapidly progressed through the grades, to state, and then to the national representative level, becoming the first Victorian-born player to represent the Wallabies.

He made his national representative debut against the All Blacks at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 23 July 1932 as a number 8.

In the first Test of 1934 he again appeared for Australia, this time as a lock Australia won the match 25–11. Dunlop had broken his nose in a head clash in the Melbourne University boxing championships on 3 August 1934, and it was broken again in the first five minutes of the match.

Two weeks later the second and final match of that year&#x27;s Bledisloe Cup series finished in a draw; and, although Dunlop missed that match – he was one of a number of players from both teams who were victims of influenza – he stands as a member of the first Wallaby squad to have won the Bledisloe Cup away from New Zealand.

In June 2008, he was honoured in the third set of inductees into the Australian Rugby Union Hall of Fame. To date, he is the only Victorian so honoured.

==Pre-war career==
Dunlop had been a school cadet, and he continued his part-time army service until 1929, when his service ceased under pressure from his pharmacy studies. He re-enlisted in 1935 and was commissioned into the Australian Army Medical Corps on 1 July with the rank of captain. In May 1938 Dunlop left Australia for London on a ship, where he served as her medical officer. In London he attended St Bartholomew&#x27;s Medical School and in 1938 became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. The distinguished medical mentors Dunlop met in London, Professor Grey-Turner and Sir Thomas Dunhill, impressed him with their dedication to their job and he resolved to emulate their example.

==War and imprisonment==
During the Second World War, Dunlop was appointed to medical headquarters in the Middle East, where he developed the mobile surgical unit. In Greece he liaised with forward medical units and Allied headquarters, and at Tobruk he was a surgeon until the Australian Divisions were withdrawn for home defence. His troopship was diverted to Java in an ill-planned attempt to bolster the defences there. On 26 February 1942, he was promoted to temporary lieutenant-colonel. Dunlop became a Japanese prisoner of war in 1942 when he was captured in Bandung, Java, together with the hospital he was commanding.

Because of his leadership skills, he was placed in charge of prisoner-of-war camps in Java, and was later transferred briefly to Changi, and in January 1943 commanded the first Australians sent to work on the Thai segment of the Burma-Thailand railway where prisoners of the Japanese were being used as forced labourers to construct a strategically important supply route between Bangkok and Rangoon. Conditions in the railway camps were primitive and horrific—food was totally inadequate, beatings were frequent and severe, there were no medical supplies, tropical diseases were rampant, and the Japanese required a level of productivity that would have been difficult for fully fit and properly equipped men to achieve.

Along with a number of other Commonwealth Medical Officers, Dunlop&#x27;s dedication and heroism became a legend among prisoners. A courageous leader and compassionate doctor, he restored morale in those terrible prison camps and jungle hospitals. Dunlop defied his captors, gave hope to the sick and eased the anguish of the dying. His example was one of the reasons why Australian survival rates were the highest.

He became, in the words of one of his men, the author Donald Stuart, &quot;a lighthouse of sanity in a universe of madness and suffering&quot;.

He is depicted in a lighter moment during these terrible times on a birthday card painted by Ashley George Old for Major Arthur Moon and now held at the State Library of Victoria.

==Post-war life==
Dunlop was a Freemason.

==Honours and awards==
&#x27;Weary&#x27; Dunlop received many honours and awards throughout his life, including: 
* Officer of the Order of the British Empire (1947)
* Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (1965)
* Knight Bachelor (1969)
* named Australian of the Year 1976
* Companion of the Order of Australia (1987)
* Knight Commander of the Order of St John of Jerusalem (Knights Hospitaller) of the Order of St John of Jerusalem (1992)
* Knight Grand Cross (1st Class) of the Order of the Crown of Thailand (1993)
* Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England
* Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons
* Honorary Fellow of the Imperial College London
* Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh
* Honorary Life Member of the Returned and Services League of Australia
* Life Governor of the Royal Women&#x27;s Hospital and the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital.

In 1988 Dunlop was named one of &#x27;200 Great Australians&#x27;. In June 2008, he was honoured in the third set of inductees into the Australian Rugby Union Hall of Fame.

He received the posthumous honour of having the Canberra suburb of Dunlop named after him shortly after his death in 1993. His image is on the 1995 issue Australian fifty cent piece with the words &quot;They Served Their Country in World War II, 1939 – 1945&quot;. The fifty cent piece is part of a set including the one dollar coin and the twenty cent piece. He has a platoon named after him in the Army Recruit Training Centre, Blamey Barracks, Kapooka. Weary Dunlop Platoon is a holding platoon to recruits that want to leave recruit training.

He was on one of 1995 Australia Remembers 45c stamps.

<doc id="490391" wikidata="Q3398397" url="?curid=490391" title="Adnan Gulshair el Shukrijumah">
<text>Adnan Gulshair el Shukrijumah (, &quot;ʿAdnān Shukrī Jumaʿah&quot;) (4 August 1975 – 6 December 2014) was a citizen of Guyana and Saudi Arabia and a senior member of Al-Qaeda. He was born in Saudi Arabia and grew up in the United States.

In March 2003, a provisional arrest warrant was issued calling him a &quot;material witness&quot;, and he was subsequently listed by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on the Seeking Information - War on Terrorism list, and the United States Department of State, through the Rewards for Justice Program, offered a bounty of up to US$5 million for information about his location.

Last known to have lived with his family in Miramar, Florida, Shukrijumah was known to have a Guyanese passport but might also have used a Saudi, Canadian, or Trinidadian passport. Saudi Arabia has repeatedly denied that el Shukrijumah was a Saudi citizen. He was considered to be a high-ranking member of al-Qaeda.

His mother insisted that her asthmatic son had been wrongly accused. He also went by the names &quot;Abu Arif&quot;, and &quot;Jafar al-Tayyar&quot;, the latter translating to &quot;Jafar the Pilot&quot;.

In 2014, Shukrijumah was killed in a military manhunt operation by Pakistan Army Special Forces in South Waziristan. The Pakistani Taliban confirmed Shukrijumah&#x27;s death two days later. Al-Qaeda confirmed Shukrijumah&#x27;s death in July 2016.

==Early years==

Shukriumah moved to the United States in the 1980s as a young teenager with his parents. His mother Zuhrah Abdu Ahmed still resides in Florida, while his father died following a career as an imam. In 2001, his father had attracted the interest of officials, as the Saudi embassy had sent him $19,200.

Shukrijumah learned English later in his youth. As a young adult in 1997, he attended &quot;English as a Second Language&quot; classes. The FBI obtained a videotape of Adnan G. El Shukrijumah from the period that shows him giving a presentation exercise to the class, in which he speaks at length on the subject of jump starting a car. U.S. authorities believe that he may have been trained at an Afghan training camp in the late 1990s. He is alleged to have received assistance from American neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui. Shukrijumah enrolled at Broward Community College, and earned money on the side working as a freelance computer technician. Shukrijumah applied for a green card so as to have his permanent residence status in the United States recognized, but lied on his application about having ever been arrested in the past.

In March 2001, while investigating Imran Mandhai, who attended the same Florida mosque as Shukrijumah, authorities made a note that Mandhai had eyed Shukrijumah as a potential colleague in whom to confide his plans, although Shukrijumah had refused to associate with the militant Mandhai. Reports would later accuse Mandhai of plotting to destroy Mount Rushmore.

Shukrijumah left the United States in May 2001 and flew to Trinidad after receiving his degree in computer engineering. However Mandhai&#x27;s testimony in court would indicate that he believed he had last seen Shukrijumah two months after his stated departure. Authorities tried to speak with Shukrijumah, appearing unannounced at his parents&#x27; home six times asking if he was available - only to be told that he had left the country.

Under torture, Jose Padilla claims to have been partnered with Shukrijumah in the summer of 2001, and that the pair were taught how to seal natural gas into apartment complexes and detonate explosives in a course they received at the Kandahar airport. Padilla claims that the two men constantly fought, and he eventually went to Mohammed Atef to complain that he could not work with Shukrijumah and the training was canceled.

In late 2002, Shukrijumah phoned his parents to tell them that he had found a wife, settled down and had a son, and was now teaching English in Morocco.

==2003 worldwide alert==
In March 2003, his family&#x27;s Florida home was the subject of an FBI search which yielded no evidence of his location. A bulletin was released suggesting that he was wanted as a terrorist and posed a &quot;grave danger&quot; to &quot;gas stations, fuel trucks, subway systems, trains, or bridges&quot;. A number of &quot;sightings&quot; were reported across the country - including at a sandwich shop in south Tampa.

In September 2003, the FBI issued an alert for four people they alleged &quot;pose a threat to U.S. citizens&quot;, including Abderraouf Jdey, Shukrijumah and the previously unknown Zubayr al-Rimi and Karim el-Mejjati.

In October, author Paul Williams wrote a book titled &quot;Dunces of Doomsday&quot; in which he claimed that Amer el-Maati, Jaber A. Elbaneh and Anas al-Liby had all been seen around Hamilton, Ontario the previous year, and that Shukrijumah had been seen at McMaster University where he &quot;wasted no time in gaining access to the nuclear reactor and stealing more than of nuclear material for the creation of radiological bombs&quot;. He was subsequently sued by the university for libel, as there had been no evidence to suggest any part of his story was true. The publisher later apologised for allowing Williams to print statements which &quot;were without basis in fact&quot;.

==Summer 2004 terror alert==
On 26 May 2004, United States Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller announced that reports indicated that el Shukrijumah was one of seven al-Qaeda members who were planning terrorist actions for the summer or fall of 2004. The other alleged terrorists listed on that date were Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani (who was later captured in Pakistan), Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, and Amer el-Maati, Aafia Siddiqui, Adam Yahiye Gadahn, and Abderraouf Jdey. The first two had been listed as FBI Most Wanted Terrorists since 2001, indicted for their roles in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings. Jdey had already been on the FBI&#x27;s &quot;Seeking Information&quot; wanted list since inception on 17 January 2002, to which Shukrijumah had also been later added, and the other three as well. American Democrats labeled the warning &quot;suspicious&quot; and said it was held solely to divert attention from President Bush&#x27;s plummeting poll numbers and to push the failings of the Invasion of Iraq off the front page. CSIS director Reid Morden voiced similar concerns, saying it seemed more like &quot;election year&quot; politics, than an actual threat - and &quot;The New York Times&quot; pointed out that one day before the announcement, they had been told by the Department of Homeland Security that there were no current risks.

Ashcroft alleged that Shukrijumah had specifically &quot;scouted sites&quot; in New York City and around the Panama Canal for possible terrorist attacks. On 30 June, it was announced by the Honduran Security Ministry that el Shukrijumah had been in Honduras during the previous month meeting with members of the Mara Salvatrucha street gang. That September, the Aviation Security Association claimed that a Japanese flight attendant had confronted Shukrijumah while he had been acting strangely at Kansai International Airport. In June 2007, the New York Post claimed that Shukrijumah was &quot;Al Qaeda&#x27;s operations leader on a nuclear terror plot targeting the United States&quot; stating that Osama bin Laden had chosen him &quot;to detonate nuclear bombs simultaneously in several U.S. cities.&quot;

==Identified==
A 2006 , from the office of the Director of National Intelligence, asserted that &quot;Jafar al-Tayyar&quot; was identified as el Shukrijumah by waterboarded captive Abu Zubaydah. Khalid Shaikh Mohammad, after also being waterboarded, was shown a photograph of Shukijumah and agreed it was &quot;Jafar al-Tayyar&quot;. Other captives held at Guantanamo Bay detention camp had stated that another man, whose photograph they identified from a collection, was &quot;Jafar al-Tayyar&quot; although the American authorities discarded their claims.

==Linked to Najibullah Zazi plot and put on the FBI most wanted terrorists list==
In June 2010, anonymous U.S. counter-terrorism officials told the Associated Press that Najibullah Zazi, who was arrested in September 2009 on charges that he planned to suicide bomb the New York City Subway system, had met with Shukrijumah in a camp in Pakistan. On 8 July 2010, he was put on the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list.

==External operations council==
Shukrijumah and two other leaders were part of an &quot;external operations council&quot; that designed and approved terrorism plots and recruits, but his two counterparts were killed in U.S. drone attacks, leaving Shukrijumah as the de facto chief and successor to Mohammed – his former boss. &quot;He would be equated with being chief of operations,&quot; FBI special agent Brian LeBlanc told the US news network, adding that investigators believed Shukrijumah was &quot;extremely dangerous.&quot;
However, according to the &quot;Long War Journal&quot;, Shukrijumah was al-Qaeda&#x27;s operations chief for North America.

<doc id="490393" wikidata="Q238364" url="?curid=490393" title="Margaret Bourke-White">
<text>Margaret Bourke-White (; June 14, 1904 – August 27, 1971) was an American photographer and documentary photographer. She was the first foreign photographer permitted to take pictures of Soviet industry under the Soviets&#x27; first five-year plan, was the first American female war photojournalist, and took the photograph (of the construction of Fort Peck Dam) that became the cover of the first issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

== Early life ==
Margaret Bourke-White, born Margaret White in the Bronx, New York, was the daughter of Joseph White, a non-practicing Jew whose father came from Poland, and Minnie Bourke, who was of Irish Catholic descent. She grew up in Middlesex, New Jersey (the Joseph and Minnie White House in Middlesex), and graduated from Plainfield High School in Union County. From her naturalist father, an engineer and inventor, she claimed to have learned perfectionism; from her &quot;resourceful homemaker&quot; mother, she claimed to have developed “an unapologetic desire for self-improvement.&quot; Her younger brother, Roger Bourke White, became a prominent Cleveland businessman and high-tech industry founder, and her older sister, Ruth White, became well known for her work at the American Bar Association in Chicago, Ill. Roger Bourke White described their parents as &quot;Free thinkers who were intensely interested in advancing themselves and humanity through personal achievement&quot;, attributing the success of their children in part to this quality. He was not surprised at his sister Margaret&#x27;s success, saying &quot;[she] was not unfriendly or aloof&quot;.

Margaret&#x27;s interest in photography began as a hobby in her youth, supported by her father&#x27;s enthusiasm for cameras. Despite her interest, in 1922, she began studying herpetology at Columbia University, only to have her interest in photography strengthened after studying under Clarence White (no relation). She left after one semester, following the death of her father. 

She transferred colleges several times, attending the University of Michigan (where she was a photographer at the &quot;Michiganensian&quot; and became a member of Alpha Omicron Pi sorority), Purdue University in Indiana, and Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. Bourke-White ultimately graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1927, leaving behind a photographic study of the rural campus for the school&#x27;s newspaper, including photographs of her famed dormitory, Risley Hall. A year later, she moved from Ithaca, New York, to Cleveland, Ohio, where she started a commercial photography studio and began concentrating on architectural and industrial photography.

== Career ==

=== Architectural and commercial photography ===

One of Bourke-White&#x27;s clients was Otis Steel Company. Her success was due to her skills with both people and her technique. Her experience at Otis is a good example. As she explains in &quot;Portrait of Myself&quot;, the Otis security people were reluctant to let her shoot for many reasons. Firstly, steel making was a defense industry, so they wanted to be sure national security was not endangered. Second, she was a woman, and in those days, people wondered if a woman and her delicate cameras could stand up to the intense heat, hazard, and generally dirty and gritty conditions inside a steel mill. When she finally got permission, technical problems began. Black-and-white film in that era was sensitive to blue light, not the reds and oranges of hot steel (In the words of her collaborator, the ambient red-orange light had no &quot;actinic value&quot;), so she could see the beauty, but the photographs were coming out all black.
My singing stopped when I saw the films. I could scarcely
recognize anything on them. Nothing but a half-dollar-sized disk
marking the spot where the molten metal had churned up in the
ladle. The glory had withered.

I couldn&#x27;t understand it. &quot;We&#x27;re woefully underexposed,&quot; said
Mr. Bemis. &quot;Very woefully underexposed. That red light from
the molten metal looks as though it&#x27;s illuminating the whole
place. But it&#x27;s all heat and no light. No actinic value.&quot;

She solved this problem by bringing along a new style of magnesium flare, which produces white light, and having assistants hold the flares to light her scenes. Her abilities resulted in some of the best steel-factory photographs of that era, which earned her national attention.
&quot;To me... industrial forms were all the more beautiful because they were never designed to be beautiful. They had a simplicity of line that came from their direct application of purpose. Industry... had evolved an unconscious beauty – often a hidden beauty that was waiting to be discovered&quot;

In 1930, Bourke-White was hired to photograph the construction of what would become one of New York City&#x27;s most elegant skyscrapers, the Chrysler Building. She was deeply inspired by the new structure and especially smitten by the massive eagle&#x27;s-head figures projecting off the building. In her autobiography, Portrait of Myself, Bourke-White wrote, ‘On the sixty-first floor, the workmen started building some curious structures which overhung 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue below. When I learned these were to be gargoyles à la Notre Dame, but made of stainless steel as more suitable for the twentieth century, I decided that here would be my new studio. There was no place in the world that I would accept as a substitute.’

When the building&#x27;s management initially refused to rent to a woman, Bourke-White secured a recommendation from Fortune magazine, her principal employer at the time, and opened her studio shortly thereafter. She hired John Vassos to design the deluxe interior, whose clean modern lines echoed the building&#x27;s bold and graceful exterior. The Chrysler Building itself became the subject matter for Bourke-White, with the gargoyles a focal point (see).

===Photojournalism===
In the summer of 1929 Bourke-White accepted a job as associate editor and staff photographer for the new business-themed magazine Henry Luce was starting in the fall, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine - a position she held until 1935. 

In 1930 she became the first Western photographer allowed to enter the Soviet Union.

When Luce began his third magazine, the oversized, photograph-centered &quot;Life&quot; magazine, in 1936, he hired her as its first female photojournalist. Her photographs of the construction of the Fort Peck Dam featured in &quot;Life&quot;″s first issue, dated November 23, 1936, including the cover. Though Bourke-White titled the photo, &quot;New Deal, Montana: Fort Peck Dam&quot;, &quot;it is actually a photo of the spillway located three miles east of the dam&quot;, according to a United States Army Corps of Engineers webpage. This cover photograph became such a favorite that it was the 1930s&#x27; representative in the United States Postal Service&#x27;s &quot;Celebrate the Century&quot; series of commemorative postage stamps.

She held the title of staff photographer at &quot;LIFE&quot; until 1940, but returned from 1941 to 1942, and again in 1945, after which she stayed through her semi-retirement in 1957 (which ended her photography for the magazine) and her full retirement in 1969.

During the mid-1930s, Bourke-White, like Dorothea Lange, photographed drought victims of the Dust Bowl. In the February 15, 1937, issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine, her famous photograph of black flood-victims standing in front of a sign that declared, &quot;World&#x27;s Highest Standard of Living&quot;, showing a white family, was published. The photograph later would become the basis for the artwork of Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s 1975 album, &quot;There&#x27;s No Place Like America Today&quot;. 

=== Marriage and photojournalism in the South and Nazi Europe===
Bourke-White met the bestselling novelist Erskine Caldwell in the mid-thirties. Caldwell specialized in writing about poor communities in the rural south, and he invited her to collaborate on a photojournalist expedition through the south, which produced the book &quot;You Have Seen Their Faces&quot; (1937). 

They collaborated on two more books &quot;North of the Danube&quot; (1939) a travelogue about Czechoslovakia under the specter of Nazi occupation and &quot;Say, Is This the U.S.A.&quot; (1941) about industrialization in the United States.
She lived with Caldwell for several years before they married in 1939.

They traveled to Europe to record how Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia were faring under Nazism.

=== Soviet Union ===

Bourke-White was &quot;the first Western professional photographer permitted into the Soviet Union&quot;. She travelled there in consecutive summers from 1930 to 1932 to document the first Five-Year Plan. While in the USSR, she photographed Joseph Stalin, as well as making portraits of Stalin&#x27;s mother and great-aunt when visiting Georgia. She also took portraits of other famous people in the Soviet Union, such as Karl Radek, Sergei Eisenstein, and Hugh Cooper. She noted that the trips and work there required a lot of patience, and generally had mixed, yet positive impressions of the USSR. Her photographs were first published in &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine in 1931 under the title &quot;Eyes on Russia&quot;, and then as a book with the same name by Simon and Schuster. These photos additionally became &quot;a six-part series in &quot;The New York Times&quot; (1932), a deluxe photo portfolio (1934), and a set of photomurals for the Soviet consulate in New York (1934). Still other photographs circulated in exhibitions, books, and periodicals around the globe, especially in Soviet magazines and postcards of the early 1930s.&quot;

Bourke-White returned to the Soviet Union in 1941 during the Second World War. With five cameras, 22 lenses, four developing tanks and 3,000 flashbulbs, her luggage weighed in total 600 pounds. The resulting body of work was published in a book titled &quot;Shooting the Russian War&quot; in 1942.

===World War II===

Bourke-White was the first known female war correspondent, as well as the first woman to be allowed to work in combat zones during World War II. In 1941 she traveled to the Soviet Union just as Germany broke its pact of non-aggression. She was the only foreign photographer in Moscow when German forces invaded. Taking refuge in the U.S. Embassy, she then captured the ensuing firestorms on camera.

As the war progressed, she was attached to the U.S. Army Air Force in North Africa, then to the U.S. Army in Italy and later in Germany. She repeatedly came under fire in Italy in areas of fierce fighting. On January 22, 1943, Major Rudolph Emil Flack piloted the lead aircraft with Margaret Bourke-White (the first female photographer/writer to fly on a combat mission) aboard his 414th Bombardment Squadron B-17F and bombed the El Aouina Airdrome in Tunis, Tunisia.

&quot;The woman who had been torpedoed in the Mediterranean, strafed by the Luftwaffe, stranded on an Arctic island, bombarded in Moscow, and pulled out of the Chesapeake when her chopper crashed, was known to the &quot;Life&quot; staff as &#x27;Maggie the Indestructible. The incident in the Mediterranean refers to the sinking of the England-Africa bound British troopship SS &quot;Strathallan&quot; that she recorded in an article, &quot;Women in Lifeboats&quot;, in &quot;Life&quot;, February 22, 1943. Though disliked by General Dwight D Eisenhower, she became friendly with his chauffeur/secretary, Irishwoman Kay Summersby, with whom she shared the lifeboat.

In the spring of 1945 she traveled throughout a collapsing Germany with Gen. George S. Patton. She arrived at Buchenwald, the notorious concentration camp, and later said, &quot;Using a camera was almost a relief. It interposed a slight barrier between myself and the horror in front of me.&quot; After the war she produced a book entitled &quot;Dear Fatherland, Rest Quietly&quot;, a project that helped her come to grips with the brutality she had witnessed during and after the war.

The editor of a collection of Bourke-White&#x27;s photographs wrote: &quot;To many who got in the way of a Bourke-White photograph—and that included not just bureaucrats and functionaries but professional colleagues like assistants, reporters, and other photographers—she was regarded as imperious, calculating, and insensitive.&quot;

===Recording the India–Pakistan partition violence===

Bourke-White is known equally well in both India and Pakistan for her photographs of Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar at his home Rajgriha, Dadar in Mumbai on the occasion of a third impression of his book which was published in December 1940 as &quot;Thoughts on Pakistan&quot; (the book was republished in 1946 under the title &quot;India&#x27;s Political What&#x27;s What: Pakistan or Partition of India&quot;). These photographs were published on the &quot;Life&quot; magazine cover. She also photographed M. K. Gandhi (at his spinning wheel) and Pakistan&#x27;s founder, Mohammed Ali Jinnah (upright in a chair).

She was &quot;one of the most effective chroniclers&quot; of the violence that erupted at the 1947 independence and partition of India and Pakistan, according to Somini Sengupta, who calls her photographs of the episode &quot;gut-wrenching, and staring at them, you glimpse the photographer&#x27;s undaunted desire to stare down horror&quot;. She recorded streets littered with corpses, dead victims with open eyes, and refugees with vacant eyes. &quot;Bourke-White&#x27;s photographs seem to scream on the page&quot;, Sengupta wrote.

Sixty-six of Bourke-White&#x27;s photographs of the partition violence featured in a 2006 reissue of Khushwant Singh&#x27;s 1956 novel about the disruption, &quot;Train to Pakistan&quot;. In connection with the reissue, many of the photographs in the book were displayed at &quot;the posh shopping center Khan Market&quot; in Delhi, India. &quot;More astonishing than the images blown up large as life was the number of shoppers who seemed not to register them&quot;, Sengupta wrote. No memorial to the partition victims exists in India, according to Pramod Kapoor, head of Roli, the Indian publishing house coming out with the new book.

She had a knack for being at the right place at the right time: she interviewed and photographed Mohandas K. Gandhi just a few hours before his assassination in 1948. Alfred Eisenstaedt, her friend and colleague, said one of her strengths was that there was no assignment and no picture that was unimportant to her. She also started the first photography laboratory at &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

===Korean War===
Bourke-White served as a photographer for &quot;Life&quot; during Korean War of 1950–1953.

* Honorary Doctorate: University of Michigan (Ann Arbor), 1951
* Achievement Award: US Camera, 1963

==Later years ==
In 1953, Bourke-White developed her first symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. She was forced to slow her career to fight encroaching paralysis. In 1959 and 1961 she underwent several operations to treat her condition, which effectively ended her tremors but affected her speech. Bourke-White wrote an autobiography, &quot;Portrait of Myself&quot;, which was published in 1963 and became a bestseller, but she grew increasingly infirm and isolated in her home in Darien, Connecticut. A pension plan set up in the 1950s, &quot;though generous for that time&quot;, no longer covered her health-care costs. She also suffered financially from her personal generosity and from &quot;less-than-responsible attendant care&quot;.

== Personal life==
In 1924, during her studies, she married Everett Chapman, but the couple divorced two years later. Margaret White added her mother&#x27;s surname, &quot;Bourke&quot;, to her name in 1927 and hyphenated it. Bourke-White and novelist Erskine Caldwell were married from 1939 to their divorce in 1942.

==Death==
In 1971, Bourke-White died at Stamford Hospital in Stamford, Connecticut, aged 67, from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Legacy==
Photographs by Bourke-White are in the Brooklyn Museum, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the New Mexico Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, as well as in the collection of the Library of Congress. A 160-foot-long photomural she created for NBC in 1933, for the Rotunda in the broadcaster&#x27;s Rockefeller Center headquarters, was destroyed in the 1950s. In 2014, when the Rotunda and Grand Staircase leading up to it were rebuilt, the photomural was faithfully recreated in digital form on the 360-degree LED screens on the Rotunda&#x27;s walls. It forms one of the stops on the NBC Studio Tour.

Many of her manuscripts, memorabilia, photographs, and negatives are housed in Syracuse University&#x27;s Bird Library Special Collections section.
