<text>Alberts Kviesis (22 December 1881 – 9 August 1944) was a Latvian politician who served as third President of Latvia from 1930 to 1936.

== Early life ==
Alberts Kviesis was born in Kalnamuiža (Tērvete) parish (now Dobele Municipality) in the Courland Governorate. Having received his primary education from his parents, he thereafter finished the Jelgava Gymnasium and from 1902 studied law at the Tartu University, from where he graduated in 1907. After his studies, he worked as a lawyer in Jelgava. He took an active part in the work of Latvian national societies, having served as an acting chair of the Jelgava Latvian Society and a member of the Latvian commission of the Jelgava Red Cross.

== Political career ==
On 25 April 1917, in Tartu, he participated in the Kurzeme local assembly and was elected to the Provisional Land Council of Kurzeme. In May 1917, he was elected by the Congress of Latvian Lawyers to the Bureau of Latvian Lawyers of Tartu. On 17 November 1918 Kviesis was among the delegates of the Tautas padome (People’s Council) of Latvia and, as a lawyer, was elected the vice-chair of the Council for juridical affairs. During the first years of Latvian independence, Kviesis actively participated in the development of the Latvian legal and court system. In July 1919 he was appointed a member of the Court Chamber, becoming its chairman from March 1923. Concurrently, from 1921 to 1923 he served as the Minister for the Interior in the cabinet of Zigfrīds Anna Meierovics. He was one of the most active members of the Latvian Farmers&#x27; Union, being elected to the Constitutional Assembly and first three Saeimas. From 1926 he served as the Vice-Speaker of the Latvian parliament.

After his unsuccessful attempt during the Latvian presidential elections in 1927, Kviesis ran again in 1930 after Gustavs Zemgals refused to be a candidate for a second term. He was elected after eleven rounds of voting on 9 April 1930, with a 55-vote majority of the Saeima members. During his term as President, he never proposed a single law himself, never vetoed a single law passed by Saeima, and never exercised his right to call an extraordinary cabinet meeting. On 11 April 1933 he was reelected by Saeima for his second term.

On 15 May 1934, Prime Minister Kārlis Ulmanis organized a coup d’etat, of which the President, his fellow party member, had no prior knowledge. As the coup was under way, Kvesis’s communications in the Riga Castle were cut off, but he never made any attempt, as the army’s commander-in-chief, to prevent or resist the coup. After Ulmanis had informed the President at 1 a.m. on 16 May that the Saeima had been dissolved and the Constitution suspended, Kvesis made no protest and continued to exercise his duties until the expiration of his term, albeit without any real power. He dutifully signed all laws passed by Ulmanis’ authoritarian government, the only remarkable event of his second term being the solemn opening of the Freedom Monument in Riga on 18 November 1935.

On 19 March 1936, Kviesis promulgated a law which stipulated that Ulmanis would become president upon the expiration of Kvesis&#x27; term, thus unconstitutionally combining the two offices. The law took effect when Kvesis left office on 11 April 1936, after which he returned to his law practice.

As the Soviet army occupied Latvia in 1940, Kviesis was prohibited to practice law and put under house arrest. He evaded mass deportations of June 1941, having hid with his family at some forest warden’s home. During the German occupation, he returned to his law practice and became a collaborationist, working for the legal consultant at the Law General Directorate of the pro-German Latvian Self-Government which was completely under the German control. From 1943 to 1944 he served as the director for the legal affairs of the Latvian Self-Government.

In August 1944, as he boarded a German ship to leave with the retreating German army, he died of a heart attack while the ship was still at the harbor. He is buried at the Forest Cemetery in Riga.

<doc id="497860" wikidata="Q1017233" url="?curid=497860" title="Bus Éireann">
<text>Bus Éireann (; &quot;Irish Bus&quot;) is a state-owned bus and coach operator providing services throughout Ireland, with the exception of Dublin, where bus services are provided by sister company Dublin Bus. It is a subsidiary of Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ). The company&#x27;s primary hub is &quot;Busáras&quot;, located in Store Street, Dublin. In 2022 it operated 229 Public Service Obligation Routes, 14 expressway routes and 8940 school transport routes.

==History==
Bus Éireann was established in February 1987 when it was split out from Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ). The logo of Bus Éireann incorporates a red Irish Setter, a breed of dog that originated in Ireland.
The National Development Plan 1999-2006 included a large expansion in commuter services, especially in the Greater Dublin Area, and so the company greatly increased services on routes such as Dublin/Drogheda/Dundalk, Dublin/Ashbourne, Dublin/Ratoath, Dublin/Dunshaughlin/Navan/Kells/Cavan.

In 2008 Bus Éireann stated that they also intended to develop similar services to the 24-hour Dublin-Belfast route on the following routes: Donegal-Dublin, Ballina-Dublin, Sligo-Dublin and Drogheda-Balbriggan-Dublin Airport-Dublin. Due to the post-2008 economic downturn in Ireland these plans were never realised. On 20 January 2009, Bus Éireann announced that it was to let 320 staff go and withdraw 150 buses due to the economic crisis. Some services were permanently withdrawn or reduced due to the cutbacks.

During 2016, it was reported that Bus Éireann amassed losses of around and that these losses were set to rise throughout 2017. As a result, Shane Ross, TD, Ireland&#x27;s Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, mentioned the company &quot;faces insolvency within 18 months&quot;.
Bus Éireann concluded an all out strike on Thursday 13 April that lasted since Friday 24 March 2017.

In November 2020 Bus Éireann suspended its Dublin to Belfast service, route X1, along with its Expressway services linking Dublin to Cork (route X8), Galway (routes 20 and X20) and Limerick (route X12). The board of the company announced it had taken the decision to end these commercial services, as they were losing money, in order to protect core routes. The financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was also cited as a reason for the suspension. Galway-Roscommon TD Claire Kerrane criticised the decision, highlighting the negative impact it would have on passengers who had relied on it in Aughrim, Ballinasloe and Athlone at a time when people were being encouraged to move back to such towns from the cities.

During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020-2022 it was noted that Bus Éireann had been the only bus company to continue operating long-distance routes in the country. Speaking to the BBC, the general secretary of the National Bus and Rail Union (NBRU) Dermot O&#x27;Leary noted that as the majority of the Irish population stayed at home, the market for commercial companies to make profits on their normal routes ceased overnight, and they subsequently paused operations. As a result, &quot;essential workers [reliant on public transport] could not have gone into hospitals, doctor&#x27;s surgeries, pharmacies&quot; were it not for Bus Éireann. Bus Éireann also provided the only bus connection between Athlone and the cities of Galway and Dublin for a period in 2020 when private companies such as Citylink temporarily suspended services.

From 2021 Bus Éireann services were expanded as part of a general expansion of services of bus services in Ireland. In rural areas this is taking place under the Connecting Ireland programme. Connecting Ireland includes the expansion of LocalLink and Bus Éireann services, as well as a reorganisation of services nationally. In 2022 this included improvements to 20 bus routes under the purview of Bus Éireann. Services in urban areas have also been expanded, with the launch of new town bus services, such as Carlow&#x27;s, in July 2023.

==Services==
Bus Éireann&#x27;s main services are in Ireland but they also provide services to Northern Ireland in association with Ulsterbus including: &quot;expressway&quot; (intercity), &quot;commuter&quot;, &quot;local&quot; and &quot;school&quot; services. Additional services within Ireland include city services in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford and town services in Athlone, Balbriggan, Drogheda, Dundalk, Navan and Sligo.

Bus Éireann operates international services to Great Britain and mainland Europe, via the ports at Dublin and Rosslare Europort. Cities served include London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Leeds. These are operated under the Eurolines brand.

When the company was first established in February 1987, there were no bus services between Dublin and Belfast. The Dublin/Dublin Airport/Newry/Belfast route was initiated soon after and came to be jointly operated by Bus Éireann and Ulsterbus. Reasons for the route&#x27;s expansion in the 1990s and 2000s included the economic boom in the Republic, known as the Celtic Tiger; the Northern Ireland peace process which helped boost the economy there, and the rise of the low-cost airline industry, which greatly increased the numbers of people flying in and out of Dublin Airport from both sides of the border. By the 2000s the route operated an hourly service, each way, from 06:00 to 21:00 daily. In October 2006, further services were introduced on the route, departing at 01:00, 03:00, 05:00, and 23:00, thus establishing the route as the first &quot;24-hour inter-city bus service&quot; in the country. In November 2020 the service was suspended indefinitely by Bus Éireann although private companies continue to offer bus services between the two cities. These include Aircoach route 705X (01:30-22:30) and Dublin Coach route 400 (05:30-20:30).

A similar service to the Dublin-Belfast route was implemented on route 2 between Dublin Airport and Wexford, which started on 18 January 2009. Services departed Dublin Airport for Wexford on the hour from 05:00 to 23:00, with services during the night at 01:00 and 03:00. As of May 2022, no services exist on this route now between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00.

=== Expressway ===
‘Expressway’ is a division of Bus Éireann that provides intercity services throughout the country serving most of the main airports and cities in Ireland.

It is a commercial part of the company which, unlike the local and city services, does not receive government funding to operate.

Bus Éireann has also introduced regular clockface schedules on popular Expressway routes, such as hourly services on the routes Dublin/Athlone/Galway, Tralee/Killarney/Cork/Waterford, Cork/Limerick/Shannon Airport/Galway.

In 2021 with the launch of a new ticketing system for Expressway services, tickets ceased being interchangeable between expressway operated routes and PSO (i.e. Bus Éireann-branded) routes.

===Nightrider===
Bus Éireann introduced a number of Dublin &#x27;Nightrider&#x27; services in the early 2000s, offering special Friday and Saturday night buses for people departing the city centre to return to locations in the Greater Dublin Area. Over busy periods, the Nightrider could also be extended to operate six days a week, Mon-Sat (observed during the Christmas 2005 period), offering late-night transport options to the towns of Newbridge, Drogheda, Navan, Enfield and Wicklow. The route numbers on the Nightrider services were suffixed with an &#x27;N&#x27; to denote their night status.

* Route 101N operated from Dublin to Drogheda via Dublin Airport, Swords, Balrothery, Balbriggan, Gormanston Cross and Julianstown. The service left Dublin at 00:30 and 03:30 each Friday and Saturday night. At some point after the year 2013, the route was scrapped as the regular route 101 began to operate on a 24-hours a day basis, with the largest gap between departures being those at 01:30, 03:30 and 05:30.

* Route 109N operated from Dublin to Kells via Dublin Airport, Ashbourne, Ratoath, Dunshaughlin and Navan. On 30 May 2017, Bus Éireann announced it would be discontinuing the route. They did however notify that an alternative service was available on route 109A which operates hourly throughout the night, 7 days per week, 364 days per year. Route 109A operates hourly between 00:30-05:30 whilst the daytime route 109 is inactive.

* Route 126N operated from Dublin to Newbridge via Heuston Station, Inchicore, Newlands Cross, Citywest, Rathcoole Junction, Kill Junction and Naas. The service left Dublin at 00.30 and 03:30 each Friday and Saturday night. On 19 November 2018, Bus Éireann announced the termination of the route noting that costs to run the service were not being covered due to insufficient passenger numbers and it had been loss-making for some time. The operation of the daytime route 126 remained unaffected, but the last departure now left from Dublin at the earlier time of 23.00. In early December 2019 Go-Ahead Ireland took over operation of the route, and reinstated late night departures from the city. As of May 2022, route 126 caters for late-night passengers by departing from Connolly station (Mon-Sat) at the times of 00:05, 01:05 and 03:35.

* Route 133N operated from Dublin to Wicklow town, incorporating the towns of Kilmacanogue, Newtownmountkennedy, Newcastle, Ashford and Rathnew. The service left Dublin at 00.30 and 03:00 each Friday and Saturday night. In October 2008, Bus Éireann cancelled the service, mentioning that the route was no longer commercially viable. Others blamed the poor passenger numbers on the lack of adequate promotion or advertisement on the part of Bus Éireann with many people not even knowing the service existed.

The Nightrider service was also extended to Cork city and its environs during Christmas and other high-capacity events such as the Cork Jazz Festival. The service was also extended to Galway city for a time in 2008, departing Eyre Square at 01:30 for Moycullen, 02.30 for Spiddal and 03.30 for the towns of Oranmore and Claregalway. In December 2010 during a period of cold weather, Nightrider services from Dublin to Drogheda, Meath and Kildare were cancelled due to icy conditions.

===Tourism services===
Bus Éireann operates special one-day sightseeing tours from Dublin to locations such as Glendalough, Newgrange; from Cork, day tours to the Ring of Kerry, County Clare, West Cork, and Cape Clear Island; and from Galway, tours of Connemara and the Burren.

===Real-time passenger information===
RTPI is run by the National Transport Authority under the brand Transport for Ireland, a single portal providing information on public transport in Ireland.

Real-time information is available across most Bus Éireann services providing up-to-the-minute details about the arrival of a bus at a specific stop. It is calculated using the GPS location of a bus and is estimated and changed with current traffic conditions. Real-time information is available on the Bus Éireann website and via the Real Time Ireland App. Many stops across Ireland have real-time information that allows the customer to see exactly when the bus will arrive.

RTPI began to roll out across bus services in Ireland from 2011.

===Bus Scoile===
Bus Éireann operates &quot;Bus Scoile&quot; (School Bus), the School Transport Scheme on behalf of the Department of Education. County Meath VEC assists Bus Éireann in administering the service in County Meath to all second-level schools. Bus Éireann is responsible for planning routes, employing bus drivers, collecting fares and ensuring compliance with safety regulations and insurance. For the 2023/2024 school year 161,000 students used the service.

The &#x27;Schools&#x27; services are mostly operated by cascaded second-hand ex-frontline vehicles. Due to recent regulations regarding seatbelts, all dated and unsuited vehicles were withdrawn and replaced with second-hand vehicles (mainly from the UK). From 2006 to 2016 Bus Éireann has been purchasing brand new buses from BMC, Euro Coach Builders Donegal, Alexander Dennis and TAM Motors Slovenia in 2016.

A number of the routes are outsourced to local bus companies such as Dunshaughlin Coach Hire, Jerry Ryan, O&#x27;Rourkes, Bernard Kavanaghs, Bartons, and James Mullally Coach Hire.

==Stations==
Bus Éireann operates from 17 bus stations across Ireland:
* Athlone
* Ballina
* Ballyshannon
* Cavan
* Cork
* Drogheda
* Busáras, Dublin
* Dundalk
* Ennis
* Galway
* Killarney
* Letterkenny
* Limerick
* Monaghan
* Sligo
* Tralee
* Waterford

==Safety==
Bus Éireann has had a few fatal incidents, with those involving school buses being particularly scrutinised. After the death of five schoolgirls in a fatal accident in County Meath in 2005 involving a 1993 DAF MB230/Van Hool (ex-front line expressway) school bus. All school buses are fitted with seatbelts since 31 October 2011.

Some non-fatal incidents have also been quite serious, for example, an off-duty bus plunging into the River Liffey in Dublin, after a collision with another vehicle.

The company has also posted notices to encourage orderly queuing at bus stops after a series of incidents where pedestrians on the footpath were struck on the head by the wing mirrors of city buses.

In 2023 an Expressway bus caught fire, shortly after departing from Donegal Town. The 15 passengers on the bus escaped uninjured.

==Natural gas buses==
Bus Éireann introduced the first NGV on 17 July 2012 in Cork. It operated on the 216 (Cork University Hospital - City Centre - Monkstown) route until mid-August 2012 on a trial that was undertaken in partnership with Ervia. The Eco-city bus was made by MAN.

==Fleet==

As of January 2018, the fleet consists of 1,200 buses and coaches.
The company mainly uses buses built by firms such as Scania, VDL Berkhof and Volvo. Bus Éireann&#x27;s fleet has been substantially invested in as part of the National Development Plan. The vast majority of the operating fleet for expressway, commuter, and local services are now five years old or less.

<doc id="497868" wikidata="Q944899" url="?curid=497868" title="Triad (music)">
<text>In music, a triad is a set of three notes (or &quot;pitch classes&quot;) that can be stacked vertically in thirds. Triads are the most common chords in Western music.

When stacked in thirds, notes produce triads. The triad&#x27;s members, from lowest-pitched tone to highest, are called:
* the root
**Note: Inversion does not change the root. (The third or fifth can be the lowest note.)
* the third – its interval above the root being a minor third (three semitones) or a major third (four semitones)
* the fifth – its interval above the third being a minor third or a major third, hence its interval above the root being a diminished fifth (six semitones), perfect fifth (seven semitones), or augmented fifth (eight semitones). Perfect fifths are the most commonly used interval above the root in Western classical, popular and traditional music.

Some 20th-century theorists, notably Howard Hanson, Carlton Gamer, and Joseph Schillinger expand the term to refer to any combination of three different pitches, regardless of the intervals. Schillinger defined triads as &quot;A structure in harmony of but three parts; conventionally, but not necessarily, the familiar triad of ordinary diatonic harmony.&quot; The word used by other theorists for this more general concept is &quot;trichord&quot;. Others use the term to refer to combinations apparently stacked by other intervals, as in &quot;quartal triad&quot;; a combination stacked in thirds is then called a &quot;tertian triad&quot;.

The root of a triad, together with the degree of the scale to which it corresponds, primarily determine its function. Secondarily, a triad&#x27;s function is determined by its quality: major, minor, diminished or augmented. Major and minor triads are the most commonly used triad qualities in Western classical, popular and traditional music. In standard tonal music, only major and minor triads can be used as a tonic in a song or some other piece of music. That is, a song or other vocal or instrumental piece can be in the key of C major or A minor, but a song or some other piece cannot be in the key of B diminished or F augmented (although songs or other pieces might include these triads within the triad progression, typically in a temporary, passing role). Three of these four kinds of triads are found in the major (or diatonic) scale. In popular music and 18th-century classical music, major and minor triads are considered consonant and stable, and diminished and augmented triads are considered dissonant and unstable.

==History==
In the late Renaissance music era, and especially during the Baroque music era (1600–1750), Western art music shifted from a more &quot;horizontal&quot; contrapuntal approach (in which multiple, independent melody lines were interwoven) toward progressions, which are sequences of triads. The progression approach, which was the foundation of the Baroque-era basso continuo accompaniment, required a more &quot;vertical&quot; approach, thus relying more heavily on the triad as the basic building block of functional harmony.

The primacy of the triad in Western music was first theorized by Gioseffo Zarlino (1500s), and the term &quot;harmonic triad&quot; was coined by Johannes Lippius in his &quot;Synopsis musicae novae&quot; (1612).

==Construction==

Triads (or any other tertian chords) are built by superimposing &quot;every other&quot; note of a diatonic scale (e.g., standard major or minor scale). For example, a C major triad uses the notes C–E–G. This spells a triad by &quot;skipping over&quot; D and F. While the interval from each note to the one above it is a third, the quality of those thirds varies depending on the quality of the triad:
* &quot;major&quot; triads contain a major third and perfect fifth interval, symbolized: R 3 5 (or 0–4–7 as semitones) 
* &quot;minor&quot; triads contain a minor third, and perfect fifth, symbolized: R 3 5 (or 0–3–7) 
* &quot;diminished&quot; triads contain a minor third, and diminished fifth, symbolized: R 3 5 (or 0–3–6) 
* &quot;augmented&quot; triads contain a major third, and augmented fifth, symbolized: R 3 5 (or 0–4–8) 

The above definitions spell out the interval of each note above the root. Since triads are constructed of stacked thirds, they can be alternatively defined as follows:
* &quot;major&quot; triads contain a major third with a minor third stacked above it, e.g., in the major triad C–E–G (C major), the interval C–E is major third and E–G is a minor third.
* &quot;minor&quot; triads contain a minor third with a major third stacked above it, e.g., in the minor triad A–C–E (A minor), A–C is a minor third and C–E is a major third.
* &quot;diminished&quot; triads contain two minor thirds stacked, e.g., B–D–F (B diminished)
* &quot;augmented&quot; triads contain two major thirds stacked, e.g., D–F–A (D augmented).

Triads appear in close or open positions. &quot;When the three upper voices are as close together as possible, the spacing is described as close position or close harmony. [...] The other arrangements [...] are called open position or open harmony.&quot;

==Function==

Each triad found in a diatonic (single-scale-based) key corresponds to a particular diatonic function. Functional harmony tends to rely heavily on the primary triads: triads built on the tonic, subdominant, and dominant degrees. The roots of these triads are the first, fourth, and fifth degrees (respectively) of the diatonic scale, and the triads are accordingly symbolized I, IV, and V. Primary triads &quot;express function clearly and unambiguously.&quot; The other triads in diatonic keys include the supertonic, mediant, submediant, and leading-tone, whose roots are the second, third, sixth, and seventh degrees (respectively) of the diatonic scale, symbolized ii, iii, vi, and vii. They function as auxiliary or supportive triads to the primary triads.

<text>The UCL Institute of Education (IOE) is the faculty of education and society of University College London (UCL). It specialises in postgraduate study and research in the field of education and is one of UCL&#x27;s 11 constituent faculties. Prior to merging with UCL in 2014, it was a constituent college of the University of London. The IOE is ranked first in the world for education in the &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot;, and has been so every year since 2014.

The IOE is the largest education research body in the United Kingdom, with over 700 research students in the doctoral school. It also has the largest portfolio of postgraduate programmes in education in the UK, with approximately 4,000 students taking Master&#x27;s programmes, and a further 1,200 students on PGCE teacher-training courses. At any one time the IOE hosts over 100 research projects funded by Research Councils, government departments and other agencies.

==History==
In 1900, a report on the training of teachers, produced by the Higher Education Sub-Committee of the Technical Education Board (TEB) of the London County Council, called for further provision for the training of teachers in London in universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aldrich/Woodin 2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The TEB submitted a scheme to the Senate of the University of London for a new day-training college, which would train teachers of both sexes when most existing courses were taught in single-sex colleges or departments. The principal of the proposed college was also to act as the Professor of the Theory, History and Practice of Education at the university. The new college was opened on 6 October 1902 as the London Day Training College under the administration of the LCC.

Its first principal was Sir John Adams, who had previously been the Professor of Education at University of Glasgow.
Adams was joined with a mistress and master of Method (later Vice-Principals). The bulk of the teaching was carried out by the Vice-Principals and other specialists were appointed to teach specific subjects, including Cyril Burt. Initially the LDTC only provided teacher training courses lasting between 1 and 3 years.

The LDTC became a school of the University of London in 1909 and was wholly transferred to the university and was renamed the University of London, Institute of Education in 1932. Gradually the institute expanded its activities and began to train secondary school teachers and offered higher degrees. It also moved into specific areas of research with its Child Development Department, administered by Susan Sutherland Isaacs and the training of teachers for the colonial service. At the outbreak of World War II, the institute was temporarily transferred to the University of Nottingham.

As a result of the report of the McNair Committee, which was established by the Board of Education to examine recruitment and training of teachers and youth leaders a new scheme for teacher training was established in England. &quot;Area Training Organisations&quot; (ATO) were created to co-ordinate the provision of teacher training and were responsible for the overall administration of all colleges of education within their area. The ATO for the London area was based at the University of London under the name University of London, Institute of Education, which was responsible for around 30 existing colleges of education and education departments, including the existing Institute of Education. The colleges (known as &quot;constituent colleges&quot; of the institute) prepared students for the &quot;Certificate in Education&quot; of the institute, and latterly for the Bachelor of Education and Bachelor of Humanities degrees of the university. The existing institute (referred to as the &quot;Central Institute&quot;) and the new ATO (referred to as the &quot;Wider Institute&quot;) had separate identities, but confusingly were administered from the same building and by the same administrative staff. This dual identity continued until the Wider Institute gradually disappeared and was finally dissolved in 1975, coinciding with the closure (or &quot;merger&quot; with local polytechnics and other institutions) of many of the colleges of education.

In 1987 the institute once again became a school of the University of London and was incorporated by royal charter.

The IOE and UCL formed a strategic alliance in October 2012, including co-operation in teaching, research and the development of the London schools system. In February 2014 the two institutions announced their intention to merge and the merger was completed in December 2014.

In March 2015 it was announced that the IOE would be the lead partner in the UK Centre for Global Higher Education, a new centre focusing on the systematic investigation of higher education and its future. The Economic and Social Research Council announced that it would provide £5 million in funding for the centre for the period to 2019, the other partners in which are Lancaster University and the University of Sheffield.

==Campus==
The first home of the IOE (as the London Day Training College) was Passmore Edwards Hall on Clare Market, which belonged to the London School of Economics. It moved again in its second year to the Northampton Technical Institute in Finsbury and the College of Preceptors building in Bloomsbury Square. In 1907 the college moved to its first purpose-built building on Southampton Row. In 1938, the institute moved to the Senate House complex of the University of London on Malet Street. After World War II, the Senate House complex became unworkable due to a sharp increase in numbers of students. The institute began to expand into other buildings in the neighbouring area, including four houses on Bedford Way which were leased as a residential hall for students in 1946, a building on Tavistock Square as home of the music department in 1958, and a few &quot;huts&quot; on Malet Street (formerly belonging to the University of London Student Union) where the library was transferred.
In 1960, plans were prepared for a new building on Bedford Way designed by Denys Lasdun, though only part of his initial design was completed. The library was one of the aspects dropped from the design and in 1968 it was moved from huts into a converted office block on Ridgmount Street The library finally moved into an extension of the Bedford Way building in 1992 and was renamed the &quot;Newsam Library&quot; after Peter Newsam, the Director who oversaw the new construction.

In 2004, the Institute of Education and Birkbeck, University of London, jointly founded London Knowledge Lab, an interdisciplinary research unit concerned with learning and technology. It is located in Emerald Street, Holborn. In 2016, by mutual and cordial agreement, the institutional collaboration came to an end with the launch of two separate research centres, the UCL Knowledge Lab and the Birkbeck Knowledge Lab, extending the legacy of the London Knowledge Lab.

==Library==

The IOE&#x27;s Newsam Library is the largest in its field in Europe, containing more than 300,000 volumes and nearly 2,000 periodicals.

===Main collections===
* Educational collection of publications covering every aspect of education in the United Kingdom, organized by the specialist classification scheme, London Education Classification.
* International collection covering aspects of the organisation of education outside the UK
* Reference collection including reference works, indexes, legal guidance, statistics of education in the UK and recent official government publications. The library also maintains the Digital Education Resource Archive (DERA) which contains full text digital publications from over 100 official departments and agencies relating to education, skills and training . 
* Other subjects collection containing publications on educational related subjects including psychology, sociology, linguistics etc.
* Large selection of teaching materials for all subjects and stages of the curriculum with children&#x27;s fiction and picture books.

===Special collections===
There are 27 special collections of publications held by the Newsam Library. Some of the collections relate to a specific subject area or have been collection by a single source while others have been built up with several sources. The collection contains a comprehensive range of documents on education in the UK, the National Textbook Collection, and other unique resources.

===Archives===
The institute&#x27;s archive collections date back from 1797, and holds over 130 deposited collections as well as the records of the institute itself. The deposited collections contain the personal papers of educationalist and other notable people involved with education and the records of educational organisations such as trade unions, and education projects. The collections cover a wide area of education, from pre-school all the way through to adult education, from formal education settings to informal settings. The archives are open to both internal and external researchers by appointment only, and form part of University College London&#x27;s Special Collections.

==Research==
The IOE had a total research income of £12.17 million in 2013/14, of which £6.59 million was from UK Research Councils, £2.0 million from UK central government, £1.07 from European governments, £0.81 million from UK-based charities, and £1.7 million from other sources.

A total of 219 full-time-equivalent staff from the IOE were submitted to the Education Unit of Assessment (UoA) of the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF), around 15 per cent of the total 1,442 staff submitted by all institutions to the UoA and by far the highest amount of any single institution (compared to 54 staff submitted by the second-placed Open University and 40 by the third-placed Edinburgh University). 28% of the IOE&#x27;s research was classified as 4* (compared to 19% in the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE 2008)) and 40% as 3* (compared to 38% in the 2008 RAE) and the IOE achieved a GPA of 3.21, ranking it joint 11th in the UoA. Furthermore, according to the UCL Institute of Education&#x27;s research page, one-quarter of all UK Education research occurs at the IOE, while the IOE is home to four times as many leading education scholars than any other UK university.

The IOE prepared 23 cases for impact evaluation, with the next largest submission in the UoA comprising six cases. In a league table produced by &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; the IOE ranked first for &quot;research power&quot; in the UoA with a rating of 703 (compared to 164 for the second-placed Open University and 140 for the third-placed Oxford University).

===Centre for Longitudinal Studies===
The Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) is an ESRC Resource Centre based at the IOE. CLS houses three of Britain&#x27;s internationally renowned birth cohort studies:

*National Child Development Study (NCDS)
*1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70)
*Millennium Cohort Study (MCS): 2000 birth cohort

The studies were key sources of evidence for a number of UK Government inquiries such as the Plowden Committee on Primary Education (1967), the Warnock Committee on Children with Special Educational Needs (1978), the Finer Committee on One Parent Families (1966–74), the Acheson Independent Inquiry into Inequalities in Health (1998) and the Moser Committee on Adult Basic Skills (1997–99). A study of working mothers and early child development was influential in making the argument for increased maternity leave. Another study on the impact of assets, such as savings and investments on future life chances, played a major part in the development of assets-based welfare policy, including the much-debated &quot;Baby Bond&quot;.

Heather Joshi was director of the Centre for Longitudinal Studies between 2003 and 2010. She was succeeded by Jane Elliott, who served as director from 2010 to 2014. The archives of the CLS are held within the IOE&#x27;s archive collections.

<text>The Delinquents is a 1957 American drama film written, produced, and directed by Robert Altman. As the directorial debut of Altman, he filmed it in his hometown of Kansas City, Missouri during the summer of 1956 on a $63,000 budget. It is not only the first film Altman directed, but also the first to star Tom Laughlin.

==Plot==
In suburban Kansas City, a group of hot-rod greasers and carousing delinquents stir trouble in a bar when they are denied drinks. Cholly and Eddy, the leaders of the gang, respond by breaking a window. Meanwhile, 18-year-old Scotty White and 16-year-old Janice Wilson are very much in love, but her parents stand between them because Janice is &quot;too young to go steady&quot; and Scotty &quot;hangs out with the wrong crowd&quot;, with her dad telling him to stay away. Scotty, going to college in the fall, is told he could talk to them about seeing her when he comes back for Christmas vacation. At the drive-in alone that night, Scotty gets wrongly targeted by a gang who are looking for the person who slashed one of their tires. Cholly comes to Scotty&#x27;s rescue. Cholly cooks up the idea of posing as Janice&#x27;s new boyfriend and bringing her to meet Scotty the next night. The plan works well, and the teen crowd all meet at an abandoned mansion on the edge of town. However, the party gets out of hand with wild drinking and dancing, and Scotty and Janice leave to be alone after Cholly and Eddy each dance suggestively with Janice.

Soon after, the police mysteriously appear and break up the drunken free-for-all. Cholly and his right-hand-delinquent Eddy suspect Scotty of tipping off the police, and the whole gang kidnaps Scotty the next day and force him to gulp down an entire bottle of Scotch when he won&#x27;t admit to being the informant. In panic after Scotty passes out from drinking, the gang begins to drive him out to the country with the intention of abandoning him on the side of the road but on the way they pull into a service station to get some gas. Eddy decides to hold up the station, but Scotty unknowingly bungles it when he wakes up. Cholly hits the station attendant on the head with a gas pump, and the gang speeds off, leaving Scotty behind with the cash and the attendant. Scotty staggers home, finds the gang has kidnapped Janice, has several fights, and then has a switchblade fight with Cholly (told by a psychotic Eddy to kill Scotty to kill the only witness) in a home kitchen. Wounded, Scotty then goes to the police as the Whites and Wilsons reclaim their kids.

The film, which had started with a voiceover describing it as a tale of violence and immorality, ends with a voiceover:
“This is one story. Who&#x27;s to blame? The answers are not easy, nor are they pleasant. We are all responsible, and it&#x27;s our responsibility not to look the other way. Violence and immorality like this must be controlled, channeled. Citizens everywhere must work against delinquency, just as they work against cancer, cerebral palsy, or any other crippling disease. For delinquency is a disease. But the remedies are available: patience, compassion, understanding, and respect for parental and civil authority. By working with your church group, with a youth organization in your town, by paying closer attention to the needs of your children, you can help prevent the recurrence of regrettable events like the ones you have just witnessed. You can help halt the disease before it cripples our children, before it cripples society.”

==Production==
===Background===
Elmer Rhoden Jr. was a Kansas City motion picture theater exhibitor, president of the prominent Commonwealth Theaters chain in Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Iowa, Oklahoma, and South Dakota. Rhoden wanted to get into producing films. He had the distributing apparatus at hand and the necessary capital to invest. Although television was drawing viewers out of the theaters, teenagers still frequented theaters, and, soon, film producers realized that there was a large &quot;teen market&quot; they could tap into. During the mid-to-late 1950s, following the success of movies by American International Pictures aimed at the teenage market such as &quot;Shake, Rattle &amp; Rock!&quot; and &quot;Hot Rod Girl,&quot; a huge wave of films, often referred to as exploitation films, were later produced by the major Hollywood studios and independents alike. Common subjects of 1950s teen films included juvenile delinquency, rock and roll, horror, science fiction, and hot rods. Rhoden Jr. was one of the first independent exhibitors to note these shifts in the film industry and was determined to make it work for his business.

Due to the &quot;consent decree&quot; component of the &quot;Paramount Ruling&quot;, the major studios were constrained from booking their own chains by this antitrust ruling. But the Commonwealth circuit and other small regional independent film companies, by virtue of not having previously existed as film producers, were exempt from this rule. It was the beginning of the days of the low-budget regional filmmaker, and Rhoden figured that if he budgeted his &quot;teen-flicks&quot; cheaply enough and peddled them to his own Commonwealth chain, he would be guaranteed a tidy profit. So, in the spring of 1956, he raised $63,000 with the help of other local businessmen in Kansas City, decided his first teen film would be about troubled teens, thought up a title for it and nothing else, and hired local filmmaker Robert Altman (who knew Rhoden Jr. casually and had been directing industrial films and documentaries for the local Calvin Company) to write and direct the film.

Using several starting points such as &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot;, &quot;The Wild One&quot;, and &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; for influence, Altman wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Delinquents&quot; in five to seven days.

===Casting===
Rhoden approved the script and gave Altman the go-ahead on the casting, scouting of locations, and so forth. For much of the cast, Altman turned to the local Kansas City actors with whom he had worked in community theater and in industrial films, including James Lantz, Leonard Belove, and Kermit Echols, as well as his then-wife Lotus Corelli and his eight-year-old daughter Christine. However, hoping for a Hollywood-style film, Altman and Rhoden took a trip to California and cast for the three leads there. They came up with Peter Miller from &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; to play Cholly, and Richard Bakalyan to play Eddy. Tom Laughlin was cast in the lead role of Scotty, here making his film debut. Altman and Rhoden also came back from California with soundman Bob Post and camera operator Harry Birch.

Altman employed his friends and Calvin co-workers on the crew, including Reza Badiyi as assistant director/associate producer and his sister Joan as production manager. Altman scouted locations in Kansas City and chose to film in Loose Park, as well as at the Jewel Box Nightclub, one of his favorite hangouts, and also at several popular local teen hangouts including the Crest Drive-In Theater (which Rhoden owned) and Allen&#x27;s Drive-In. Through Kansas City native George Kuhn, one of the actors in the teenage gang in the film, Altman secured the temporary use of two houses to be those of Scotty and Janice in the film. One of them was Kuhn&#x27;s and his parents&#x27;, the other was his neighbors&#x27;.

===Filming===
Altman filmed &quot;The Delinquents&quot; in three weeks during the summer of 1956. Although Rhoden was officially the executive producer, Altman did most of that type of work himself. As Altman said years later, &quot;I wrote the thing in five days, cast it, picked the locations, drove the generator truck, got the people together, took no money, and we just did it, that&#x27;s all&quot;. Altman had the cooperation of local businesses as well as the Kansas City Police Department. Altman and Rhoden had actually gone to the police to make sure their portrayal of delinquents and their problems was accurate, and also contacted them in order to receive their cooperation for blocking off streets and using the police station for certain scenes. They also used real police officers as actors in the film.

Altman&#x27;s film crew was made up mostly of his Calvin co-workers. Calvin photographer Charles Paddock was director of photography, and Badiyi was assistant director. Calvin artist and designer (and Altman&#x27;s brother-in-law) Chet Allen was art director, and Altman&#x27;s sister Joan served in a production executive (such as script girl) while Altman&#x27;s wife (Lotus Corelli) and daughter Christine also starred in the film. Also with Altman&#x27;s Kansas City crew were Californians Harry Birch (camera operator) and Bob Post (sound recorder).

Laughlin was cast after Altman consulted the only agent he had in Bob Longnecker, who had Laughlin as a client. Laughlin and Altman had conflicting theories of acting. To Altman, Laughlin was &quot;an unbelievable pain in the ass&quot;, guilty that he had not become a priest, &quot;with a big Catholic hangup and a James Dean complex&quot;. There was one particular incident where Altman was ready to shoot a scene in which Laughlin was supposed to appear physically exhausted, and Laughlin excused himself with, &quot;I&#x27;ve got to get in the mood now&quot;. Laughlin then insisted on running around the block a couple of times while cast and crew cooled their heels. Laughlin was attempting to do &quot;everything he&#x27;d heard about James Dean doing&quot;, but when Laughlin&#x27;s attempts at method acting were not welcomed by the rest of the cast or crew, he wanted to quit the film. Altman then worked out a compromise for communication whereby Altman would tell Laughlin exactly what he wanted in any given scene. According to Altman, Laughlin &quot;performed the last half of the picture under protest&quot;. Laughlin, who described himself not as a Method actor but a &quot;Stanislavsky actor&quot;, described the production as &quot;very amateurish&quot;, disapproving of the lack of organization in Altman, with one instance involving Laughlin deciding to roll the cameras himself and shoot a scene rather than wait for Altman to show up for the crew (as he felt guilt over the fact that the production was on Rhoden’s money), which began the seeds of Laughlin starting to become a director.

Altman&#x27;s experimental directing style was still developing, but one sign of his future directorial achievements can be seen in a story told by one of Altman&#x27;s young cast members, SuEllen Fried, about the shooting of a party scene in the film: &quot;He rented an old house off Walworth Boulevard and told us to pretend we were having the wildest party of our lives, while he moved the camera from room to room and just filmed whatever was going on. We didn&#x27;t know when the camera was going. We were just having a wild party&quot;. Altman (who described writing the film as one done over a weekend that he dictated to his sister Joan that would see the scenes improvised on set) expressed his thoughts about doing a script as one where he tried to avoid the characters having the same voice, where the distinction in sources and voices seemed closer to reality that would push the actor into creating the part rather than having the writer or director just bring the elements prepackaged, which only works out if the actor is willing to take the responsibility.

===Post-production===
Finally, &quot;The Delinquents&quot; has also been noted (and praised) for its &quot;technical excellence&quot;, particularly the quality of the black-and-white photography. Director of photography Charles Paddock said that, just before beginning filming on &quot;The Delinquents&quot;, Altman advised him to watch the film &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; and imitate that style of lighting.

The filming was completed by August 1956. In his contract with Rhoden, Altman had a clause stipulating that the film&#x27;s post-production and editing would be executed under professional conditions in Hollywood. In late August, Altman and Reza Badiyi traveled across the country by car (Rhoden would not approve the air fare) to edit the film in California with Helene Turner. Fred Brown contributed the sound effects.

The finished film was picked up for distribution by United Artists for $150,000, who wanted a teenage exploitation film in order to compete with the other studios. United Artists altered the ending a bit and added a moralistic narration by a stock actor at the beginning and end. Altman did not find out until he saw a preview of the film, and was not impressed.

==Release and legacy==
&quot;The Delinquents&quot; received its &quot;gala world premiere&quot; in Kansas City in February 1957. The showing of the film was preceded by live music, a dance contest, and a parade of Corvettes carrying residents who had worked on the film. It was all covered by a live radio broadcast and the theater&#x27;s house lights were brought out.
The film was rejected by the British Board of Film Classification in 1957. United Artists released the film worldwide the next month. The film&#x27;s release was not wide, and it played mostly in drive-ins. However, it did gross $1,000,000 for United Artists. When Alfred Hitchcock saw the film, he was apparently impressed enough to give Altman a job directing episodes of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, which led to more television work for Altman over the next decade.

Rhoden produced one more film in Kansas City (&quot;The Cool and the Crazy&quot;) and was featured in &quot;TIME&quot; as one of the &quot;new wave&quot; of producers. He then produced a delinquency film in Hollywood, &quot;Daddy-O&quot;, but his mini-mogul reign was short-lived. An alcoholic who drank heavily, he died in 1959 at the age of 37 three months after suffering a heart attack.

==Home media==
As of April 29, 2011, the film has been released on DVD-R via Amazon.com.

<text>In cathode-ray tube (CRT) terms, a triad is a group of 3 phosphor dots coloured red, green, and blue on the inside of the CRT display of a computer monitor or television set. By directing differing intensities of cathode rays onto the 3 phosphor dots, the triad will display a colour by combining the red, green and blue elements. However, triads are not pixels, and multiple triads will form one logical pixel of the displayed image.

In liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), colours are similarly composed of these 3 fundamental colours.

<text>The People&#x27;s Council of Latvia (, LTP) was a temporary council which declared Latvia&#x27;s independence on November 18, 1918 and then acted as the temporary parliament of the country until a Constitutional Assembly was elected.

The People&#x27;s Council was formed on November 17, 1918 as a result of merging two councils of Latvian organizations: Latvian Provisional National Council (&quot;,&quot; LPNP) and the Democratic Bloc. Originally, the People&#x27;s Council had 40 members representing all the major Latvian political organizations, except the far right and the far left (communists). It was later expanded to 245 representatives.

On November 18, 1918, the People&#x27;s Council declared Latvia an independent country at the now National Theatre of Latvia. It chose Jānis Čakste as the President of the Council and Kārlis Ulmanis as the Prime Minister of the Latvian Provisional Government. The People&#x27;s Council acted as a temporary parliament of Latvia until May 1, 1920 when the Constitutional Assembly was elected.

<text>Navan ( ; , meaning &quot;the Cave&quot;) is the county town and largest town of County Meath, Ireland. It is at the confluence of the River Boyne and Blackwater, around 50 km northwest of Dublin. At the 2022 census, it had a population of 33,886, making it the ninth largest settlement in Ireland. The town is in a civil parish of the same name.

==Etymology==
The Modern Irish name &quot;An Uaimh&quot; is most likely derived from the prehistoric burial mound &quot;An Odhbha,&quot; named after Odhbha, the first wife of Érimón. It is likely the result of &quot;Odbha&quot; being later misunderstood and confused by locals with the similar sounding and much more familiar word &quot;uaimh,&quot; or &quot;uamha,&quot; which also has a very similar meaning &quot;cave, crypt or souterrain&quot;&quot;.&quot; The Modern English name Navan is likely either an anglicisation of &quot;An Uaimh&quot;, which was often written and pronounced &quot;An Uamhainn&quot;, or of &quot;An Odhbha(n).&quot; An Uaimh was the town&#x27;s sole official name from the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1922 until 1970 when it was changed to Navan.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI200/19712&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Official Languages Act 2003 both the Irish and English name have had equal status, as in the rest of the country.

==History==

=== Prehistory ===

==== An Odhbha ====
Originally An Odhbha was probably a prehistoric tumulus, one of many in the Boyne Valley.

===== Roman Artefacts =====
A small Roman copper alloy figure was found in the River Boyne near Navan. The figurine most likely represents a Lar, a Roman deity believed to protect the household. It is likely that the figure was placed in the river as a votive offering as in Irish mythology the river was considered divine and to have been created by the goddess Boann (Bóinn in Modern Irish). This belief in the divinity of rivers was shared by the Romans. Two Roman coins have also been found in Navan.

=== Middle Ages ===
The town of Navan was founded by the Normans: Hugh de Lacy, who was granted the Lordship of Meath in 1172, awarded the Barony of Navan to one of his knights, Jocelyn de Angulo, who built a fort there, from which the town developed.

Inside the town walls, Navan consisted of three streets. These were Trimgate Street, Watergate St. and Ludlow St. (which was once called Dublingate St.) The orientation of the three original streets remains from the Middle Ages but the buildings date from the Victorian and Edwardian periods.

=== More recent history===

Navan Town Hall started life as the local bridewell in 1831 and only became a municipal facility in 1983.

The town&#x27;s Post Office on Trimgate Street office was built in 1908 on the site of an earlier post office. In 1990, the post office was relocated to Kennedy Road. The building of a new shopping centre re-oriented the town&#x27;s centre. The onetime post office was acquired as the site of the town&#x27;s first McDonald&#x27;s restaurant.

==Bus transport==
Navan is served by several bus routes. The town has no central bus station. 

Since 2020, there are two town bus routes operated by Bus Éireann, the N1 and N2.

* N1 runs from Commons Road to Kilcarn Bridge, serving the town centre and areas of the town east of the Boyne River.
* N2 runs from Commons Road to Aisling Place, serving the town centre and areas north of the Boyne and Blackwater Rivers.

Navan is also served by long distance bus routes. Several are operated by Bus Éireann including the 109 and its variants 109A and 109X, which run to Dublin. Bus Éireann also runs the commercial NX express service to Navan.

Sillan also serve the town. Royal Breffni Tours provide services to Dundalk Institute of Technology. Streamline Coaches provide services to NUI Maynooth.

Coláiste na Mí is a VEC-run school in Johnstown that opened in 2013. Beaufort College is a large state-owned inter-denominational vocational school. The Abylity Secondary College was a parent-owned fee-paying non-denominational school.

Pierce Brosnan is a former pupil of St. Anne&#x27;s Loreto, which is situated beside St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church and near to St. Joseph&#x27;s Mercy. There are also St. Paul&#x27;s, St. Stephen&#x27;s, St. Ultan&#x27;s, and St. Oliver&#x27;s primary schools. Scoil Éanna is the town&#x27;s only gaelscoil. The town&#x27;s only Church of Ireland secondary school, Preston School, closed in the 1970s. It is now the site of the shopping centre in the town. There is a Church of Ireland primary school known as Flowerfield School, on the Trim rd a new site. It was originally situated at the Flowerfield area of the town, on the main thoroughfare to Drogheda, in a building that has been sympathetically converted into private accommodation. There is also a multi-denominational Educate Together primary school in the town, sited at Commons Road.

==Public art==
Public art and sculptures in Navan include &quot;Sniomh&quot;, by Betty Newman Maguire, which sits in front of Navan Fire Station. This sculpture is reputedly inspired by the movement of water and the merging of the rivers Boyne and Blackwater.

Another public sculpture, &quot;The Fifth Province&quot; by Richard King, is located on the Navan Bypass. This sculpture is composed of four branches and a central upright stem that symbolises the flowering of hope and peace.

&quot;The Bull&quot;, designed by sculptor Colin Grehan, is a prominent piece of public art. Situated in the market square of the town, this is a 16 tonne limestone statue of a bull being held back by two handlers and commemorates the historic bull markets that took place in the area. The statue was surrounded by controversy over its cost, an estimated €90,000, and its location. Local man Paddy Pryle noted that &quot;anybody coming up Timmons Hill, which is one of the main entrances into the town, will be entering Navan via the bull&#x27;s arse. It is one of the most crazy things I have seen put up yet,&quot; Objections to the statue delayed its erection by 8 years.

== Folklore ==
According to local folklore a Souterrain was discovered near the Navan Viaduct in 1848. The location of its entrance has since been lost.

Another folk tale involves the ghost of Francis Ledwidge. According to the story an old friend of Ludwidge was working at the Meath Chronicle, the local news printer, when he heard the sound of Ledwidge&#x27;s motorcycle outside. His friend was confused as he believed Ledwidge was fighting on the Western Front, upon going out to greet him the friend found that Ledwidge had disappeared. The story claims that this ghostly apparition appeared at the same moment he died.

In the Fenian cycle of Irish mythology, Fionn mac Cumhaill studied under the druid Finegas along the river Boyne. He is believed to have caught the Salmon of Knowledge in what is now Navan.

<text>Henri Milne-Edwards (23 October 1800 – 29 July 1885) was a French zoologist.

==Biography==
Henri Milne-Edwards was the 27th child of William Edwards, an English planter and colonel of the militia in Jamaica and Elisabeth Vaux, a Frenchwoman. Henri was born in Bruges, in present-day Belgium, where his parents had retired; Bruges was then a part of the newborn French Republic. His father had been jailed for several years for helping some Englishmen in their escape to their country. Henri spent most of his life in France. He was brought up in Paris by his older brother Guillaume Frederic Edwards (1777–1842), a distinguished physiologist and ethnologist. His father was released after the fall of Napoleon. The whole family then moved to Paris.

At first he turned his attention to medicine, in which he graduated as an MD at Paris in 1823. His passion for natural history soon prevailed, and he gave himself up to the study of the lower forms of animal life. He became a student of Georges Cuvier and befriended Jean Victoire Audouin.

He married Laura Trézel. They had nine children, including the biologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards.

===Name===
Originally the name Milne was one of the first names of Henri, but, to avoid confusion with his numerous relatives, he added it to his surname Edwards. He usually wrote it as &quot;Milne Edwards&quot;, whilst his son Alphonse always used &quot;Milne-Edwards&quot;. In taxon-authorship, the hyphenated name &quot;Milne-Edwards&quot; is most often used for both father and son.

==Works==
One of his earliest papers (&quot;&quot;), which was presented to the French Academy of Sciences in 1829, formed the theme of an elaborate and eulogistic report by Cuvier in the following year. It embodied the results of two dredging expeditions undertaken by him and his friend Audouin during 1826 and 1828 in the neighbourhood of Granville, and was remarkable for clearly distinguishing the marine fauna of that portion of the French coast into four zones.

Also in 1829, working in the scientific field of herpetology, he described and named five new species of lizards.

He became professor of hygiene and natural history in 1832 at the . In 1841, after the death of Audouin, he succeeded him at the chair of entomology at the . In 1862 he succeeded Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in the long-vacant chair of zoology.

Much of his original work was published in the &quot;Annales des sciences naturelles&quot;, with the editorship of which he was associated from 1834. Of his books may be mentioned the &#x27; (3 vols., 1837–1841), which long remained a standard work; &#x27;, published in 1858–1860, but begun many years before; &quot;&quot; (1857–1881), in 14 volumes; and a little work on the elements of zoology, originally published in 1834, but subsequently remodelled, which enjoyed an enormous circulation.

In 1842, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society. The Royal Society in 1856 awarded him the Copley Medal in recognition of his zoological investigations. He was elected an international member of the American Philosophical Society in 1860. He died in Paris. His son, Alphonse Milne-Edwards (1835–1900), who became professor of ornithology at the museum in 1876, devoted himself especially to fossil birds and deep-sea exploration.
An important early classification scheme for vertebrates, diagrammed as a series of nested sets, was illustrated in Milne-Edwards (1844).

<doc id="497884" wikidata="Q685216" url="?curid=497884" title="Combining character">
<text>In digital typography, combining characters are characters that are intended to modify other characters. The most common combining characters in the Latin script are the combining [[diacritic|diacritical marks]] (including combining accents). 

Unicode also contains many precomposed characters, so that in many cases it is possible to use both combining diacritics and precomposed characters, at the user&#x27;s or application&#x27;s choice. This leads to a requirement to perform Unicode normalization before comparing two Unicode strings and to carefully design encoding converters to correctly map all of the valid ways to represent a character in Unicode to a legacy encoding to avoid data loss.

In Unicode, the main block of combining diacritics for European languages and the International Phonetic Alphabet is U+0300–U+036F. Combining diacritical marks are also present in many other blocks of Unicode characters. In Unicode, diacritics are always added after the main character (in contrast to some older combining character sets such as ANSEL), and it is possible to add several diacritics to the same character, including stacked diacritics above and below, though some systems may not render these well.

==Unicode ranges==
The following blocks are dedicated specifically to combining characters:

*Combining Diacritical Marks (0300–036F), since version 1.0, with modifications in subsequent versions down to 4.1
*Combining Diacritical Marks Extended (1AB0–1AFF), version 7.0
*Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement (1DC0–1DFF), versions 4.1 to 5.2
*Combining Diacritical Marks for Symbols (20D0–20FF), since version 1.0, with modifications in subsequent versions down to 5.1
*Cyrillic Extended-A (2DE0–2DFF), version 5.1
*Combining Half Marks (FE20–FE2F), versions 1.0, with modifications in subsequent versions down to 8.0

Combining characters are not limited to these blocks; for instance, the combining dakuten (U+3099) and combining handakuten (U+309A) are in the Hiragana block, the Devanagari block contains combining vowel signs and other marks for use with that script, and so forth. Combining characters are assigned the Unicode major category &quot;M&quot; (&quot;Mark&quot;).

Codepoints U+032A and U+0346–034A are IPA symbols:
* U+032A : dental
* U+0346 : dentolabial
* U+0347 : alveolar
* U+0348 : strong articulation
* U+0349 : weak articulation
* U+034A : denasal

Codepoints U+034B–034E are IPA diacritics for disordered speech:
* U+034B : nasal escape
* U+034C : velopharyngeal friction
* U+034D : labial spreading
* U+034E : whistled articulation

U+034F is the &quot;combining grapheme joiner&quot; (CGJ) and has no visible glyph.

Codepoints U+035C–0362 are double diacritics, diacritic signs placed across two letters.

Codepoints U+0363–036F are medieval superscript letter diacritics, letters written directly above other letters appearing in medieval Germanic manuscripts, but in some instances in use until as late as the 19th century. For example, U+0364 is an &quot;e&quot; written above the preceding letter, to be used for (Early) New High German umlaut notation, such as &quot;uͤ&quot; for Modern German &quot;ü&quot;.



==OpenType==
OpenType has the &quot;ccmp&quot; &quot;feature tag&quot; to define glyphs that are compositions or decompositions involving combining characters, the &quot;mark&quot; tag to define the positioning of combining characters onto base glyph, and &quot;mkmk&quot; for the positionings of combining characters onto each other.

==Zalgo text==
 
Combining characters have been used to create Zalgo text, which is text that appears &quot;corrupted&quot; or &quot;creepy&quot; due to an overuse of combining characters. This causes the text to extend vertically, overlapping other text. This is mostly used in horror contexts on the Internet. It is typically very challenging for most software to render, so the combining marks are often reduced or completely stripped off.

==See also==
* Dotted circle

<text>Deschambault-Grondines () is a municipality located in the Portneuf Regional County Municipality (RCM), in the Capitale-Nationale region, Quebec, Canada.

Deschambault-Grondines was created in 2002 by the merger of the villages of Deschambault and Grondines. It is a member of the Fédération des Villages-relais du Québec. &#x27; 

== Deschambault ==
=== History ===
The village of Deschambault is located in the eastern part of the municipality. It has its origins in the Seigneurie de Chavigny, granted in 1640 by the Compagnie de la Nouvelle-France. In 1671, Jacques-Alexis Fleury, Sieur Deschambault, married the heiress of the seigneury and became its owner in 1683 through an exchange of land. He then gave his name to his new domain. The parish of Saint-Joseph-de-Deschambault was founded in 1713 and canonically erected in 1753. The parish municipality was created in 1855, and the village municipality separated from it in 1951. These two entities merged again in 1989.&#x27; 

 . . . At one time, Deschambault was said to have &quot;a pilot every two houses.&quot; Very early on &quot;the taste for the sea&quot; developed there, because the St. Lawrence has long been the only way to access the village. &quot;Everything was happening on the river !&quot; says Father Jacques Paquin, coordinator of the Deschambault Navigators Committee.&quot; 
 Even after the opening of the Chemin du Roy, a route considered difficult, the seaway continued to be used more than the land route. &quot;Deschambault, a village of sailors&quot;, Le Soleil. Translated from French.

== Grondines ==
=== History ===
The name Grondines was named by Samuel de Champlain himself in 1674. &quot;Grondines&quot; is from the French verb &quot;&quot;, meaning to rumble or roar.

The &#x27;seigneurie des Grondines&#x27; was one of the oldest lordship in the province of Quebec, and was initially granted in 1637 by the Company of New France to Duchess Marie-Madeleine de Vignerot de Pontcourlay, Dame d&#x27;atours of Marie de&#x27; Medici, and niece of Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister of Louis XIV.

The estate covered a land area of around 90 square miles or nearly 60,000 acres.&#x27; In 1646, the Governor of New-France at the time, Charles Jacques Huault de Montmagny, gave the concession to the nuns hospitallers, administrators of Hôtel-Dieu de Québec, and thereafter, it was resold in 1683 to Lord Jacques Aubert. Being the father-in-law of Louis Hamelin, the next lord of Grondines, the lordship passed to the Hamelin family afterwards, and was transmitted to their descendants until 1797, following the British Conquest. In 1698, comte Louis de Buade of Château Frontenac award them concessions, extending their lordship with additional islands and isles. This family was one of the eight seigneurial dynasties that lived permanently on their estate for six generations.

Over time, the Hamelins married members of the French-Canadian nobility. The families were the Couillard de l&#x27;Espinay, the Denys de la Ronde, partners of Charles Aubert de La Chesnaye, the Fleury d&#x27;Eschambault, the Gaultier de Varennes, the Lorimier de la Rivière, the Chavigny de la Chevrotière, and their in-laws included the Barons Le Moyne de Longueuil, the Pézard de Champlain, and the Boucher de Montarville.&#x27; 

A member of this family was also recognized as noble by the Sovereign Council of New France of Louis XIV in 1654, and would join the French-Canadian nobility, being the lord and commander Jacques-François Hamelin de Bourgchemin et de l&#x27;Hermitière, a descendant of Jacques Hamelin, bishop of Tulle.&#x27; In 1766, a member of the Hamelin de Chavigny also appeared in documents of the Canadian nobility, where they asked the king to keep in power the current Governor of Quebec James Murray, with the hope of being less penalized by the injustices they had to suffer after the British conquest.

The signatories, including A. Hamelin, were Luc de la Corne, François-Joseph Cugnet, Aubert de Gaspé, Antoine Juchereau Duchesnay, and a few others. The last lord of Grondines was Senator David Edward Price in 1871, a member of the influential Price family.

The Grondines windmill was built and is the oldest windmill in Québec.


== St. Lawrence River ==

In canoes, made of birch bark or carved out of a tree trunk, First Nations have crisscrossed the St. Lawrence River from west to east, from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean and all the rivers of the Americas, from north to south, from the Arctic to Tierra del Fuego, for millennia. Indigenous peoples knew the advantages, irritants, barriers and dangers of waterways long before the arrival of Europeans and Jacques Cartier (1491-1557).

Opposite Cape Lauzon, in the middle of the St. Lawrence River, the Richelieu Rapids stretch for a distance of nearly 2 km. These rapids, which are virtually invisible, correspond to a narrowing of the channel, marked, especially at low tide, by a much stronger current than anywhere else on the St. Lawrence downstream of Montreal.&#x27; 

From the canoes of the First Nations to the ships of the conquerors, the Richelieu Rapids have played a strategic role in the history of Cape Lauzon, Deschambault and all of Quebec. To this day, they still make life as hard for sailboats, rowboats, canoes, small boats as they do for the captains of large merchant ships.

The St. Lawrence River limits the territory of Portneuf regional County (RCM) for nearly 70 km. Along the Chemin du Roi, from one village to another, several spaces allow you to rest, visit, picnic, fish, observe birds, dip your toes in the water. The main attraction remains the docks.

In Grondines, the tip of the Anse des Grondines, also known in the vernacular: La Grande Pointe, Pointe de la Laille or Grande pointe de la Laille. The word laille could come from the English light, since there was a lighthouse at the end of the island.

According to historian Raymond Douville, this point is the origin of the name Grondines, probably given by the boaters who had to go around, at the rising tide, the many pebbles that the waves hit in dull roars and whose echoes resonated on the escarpments of the coast.

<doc id="497887" wikidata="Q135151" url="?curid=497887" title="Donald J. Cram">
<text>Donald James Cram (April 22, 1919 – June 17, 2001) was an American chemist who shared the 1987 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Jean-Marie Lehn and Charles J. Pedersen &quot;for their development and use of molecules with structure-specific interactions of high selectivity.&quot; They were the founders of the field of host–guest chemistry.

==Early life and education==
Cram was born and raised in Chester, Vermont, to a Scottish immigrant father, and a German immigrant mother. His father died before Cram turned four, leaving him the only male in a family of five. He grew up on Aid to Dependent Children, and learned to work at an early age, doing jobs such as picking fruit, tossing newspapers, and painting houses, while bartering for piano lessons. By the time he turned eighteen, he had worked at least eighteen different jobs.

Cram attended the Winwood High School in Long Island, N.Y.
From 1938 to 1941, he attended Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida on a national honorary scholarship, where he worked as an assistant in the chemistry department, and was active in theater, chapel choir, Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Society, and Zeta Alpha Epsilon. It was at Rollins that he became known for building his own chemistry equipment. In 1941, he graduated from Rollins College with a BS in chemistry.

In 1942, he graduated from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln with a MS in organic chemistry, with Norman O. Cromwell serving as his thesis adviser. His subject was &quot;Amino ketones, mechanism studies of the reactions of heterocyclic secondary amines with -bromo-, -unsaturated ketones.&quot;

In 1947, Cram graduated from Harvard University with a PhD in organic chemistry, with Louis Fieser serving as the adviser on his dissertation on &quot;Syntheses and reactions of 2-(ketoalkyl)-3-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinones&quot;

==Career==
From 1942 to 1945, Cram worked in chemical research at Merck &amp; Co laboratories, doing penicillin research with mentor Max Tishler. Postdoctoral work was as an American Chemical Society postdoctoral fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with John D. Roberts. Cram was the originator of Cram&#x27;s rule, which provides a model for predicting the outcome of nucleophilic attack of carbonyl compounds. He published over 350 research papers and eight books on organic chemistry, and taught graduate and post-doctoral students from 21 different countries.

===Research===
 Cram expanded upon Charles Pedersen&#x27;s ground-breaking synthesis of crown ethers, two-dimensional organic compounds that are able to recognize and selectively combine with the ions of certain metal elements. He synthesized molecules that took this chemistry into three dimensions, creating an array of differently shaped molecules that could interact selectively with other chemicals because of their complementary three-dimensional structures. Cram&#x27;s work represented a large step toward the synthesis of functional laboratory-made mimics of enzymes and other natural molecules whose special chemical behavior is due to their characteristic structure. He also did work in stereochemistry and Cram&#x27;s rule of asymmetric induction is named after him.

In 1973, Cram collaborated on research with Irish chemist Francis Leslie Scott.

===Professor===
Cram was named an assistant professor at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1947, and a professor in 1955. He served there until his retirement in 1987. He was a popular teacher, having instructed some 8,000 undergraduates in his career and guided the academic output of 200 graduate students. He entertained his classes by strumming his guitar and singing folk songs. He showed a self-deprecating style, saying at one time:

An investigator starts research in a new field with faith, a foggy idea, and a few wild experiments. Eventually the interplay of negative and positive results guides the work. By the time the research is completed, he or she knows how it should have been started and conducted.

==Personal life==
Cram once admitted that his career wasn&#x27;t without sacrifice. His first wife was Rollins classmate, Jean Turner, who also graduated in 1941, and went on to receive a master&#x27;s degree in social work from Columbia University. His second wife, Jane, is a former chemistry professor at Mount Holyoke College. Cram chose not to have any children, &quot;because I would either be a bad father or a bad scientist.&quot;

Cram died of cancer in 2001, at the age of 82.

<text>1. Fußball-Club Köln 01/07 e. V., better known as simply 1. FC Köln () or FC Cologne in English, is a German professional football club based in Cologne, in North Rhine-Westphalia. It was formed in 1948 as a merger of the clubs &quot;Kölner Ballspiel-Club 1901&quot; and &quot;SpVgg Sülz 07&quot;. Köln compete in the 2. Bundesliga, following relegation from the 2023–24 Bundesliga season. The team are three-time national champions, winning the 1962 German football championship, as well as the Bundesliga twice, first in its inaugural season of 1963–64 and then again in 1977–78. The team plays its home matches at RheinEnergieStadion.

The club&#x27;s nickname &quot;Die Geißböcke&quot; (The Billy Goats) refers to the club&#x27;s mascot, a male goat named &quot;Hennes&quot; after the veteran FC player and later manager Hennes Weisweiler. The first &quot;Hennes&quot; was donated by a circus entrepreneur as a Cologne carnival joke. The current mascot is &quot;Hennes&quot; IX after Hennes VIII was retired by the club due to old age. Another nickname for the club, more common locally due to its ambiguity, is &quot;FC&quot; (often written as &quot;Effzeh&quot;), a common German abbreviation for football clubs. Characteristic for the dialect spoken around Cologne, this is pronounced &quot;EF-tsay&quot;, in contrast to the Standard German pronunciation of the abbreviation where the second syllable is emphasized (). Köln play at home in white and red, both colours having been used as the main shirt colour throughout its history. The club has long-standing rivalries with nearby clubs Borussia Mönchengladbach, Fortuna Düsseldorf, and Bayer Leverkusen.

Like many of Germany&#x27;s other professional football clubs, 1. FC Köln is part of a larger sports club with teams in other sports like handball, table tennis and gymnastics. 1. FC Köln has over 100,000 members, making it the fourth largest club in Germany.

==History==
===Predecessor sides===
Kölner BC was formed on 6 June 1901 by a group of young men who were unhappy as part of the gymnastics club FC Borussia Köln and were more interested in football. BC participated in the Zehnerliga West in the years before World War I and took the Westdeutsche championship in 1912 and advanced to the preliminary rounds of the national finals. Their next best result was in the 1920 league final, where they lost 1–3 to Borussia Mönchengladbach.

Spielvereinigung 1907 Köln-Sülz was established in 1907 as Sülzer Sportverein and on 1 January 1919 merged with Fußball Club 1908 Hertha Sülz to form SpVgg. They won the Westdeutscher title in 1928, but lost in the early rounds of the national finals. They went on to play as a top flight club in the Gauliga Mittelrhein, one of sixteen premier level divisions established in 1933 in the reorganization of German football under the Third Reich. After winning a divisional championship in 1939, – they then entered a period of decline in the early 1940s. After the 1941 season, the Gauliga Mittlerhein was split into two new divisions: the Gauliga Köln-Aachen and the Gauliga Moselland, which included clubs from occupied Luxembourg. Sülz struggled until they were united with VfL Köln 1899 for the 1943–44 season, to form the combined wartime side Kriegspielgemeinschaft VfL 99/Sülz 07, which would end up winning the Gauliga Köln-Aachen title by a single point over SG Düren 99 in a close race. The club did not play the next campaign as war overtook the region.

===A successful new club===

After the union of these two predecessor sides (1948), 1. FC Köln began play in the tough Oberliga West in the 1949–50 season, and, by 1954, had won their first divisional championship. That same year they lost the DFB-Pokal final 1–0 to VfB Stuttgart. &quot;Die Geißböcke&quot; won their second divisional championship in 1960, and appeared in the national final against Hamburger SV, where they lost 2–3. In the 1962 and 1963 they went on to finish first in the Oberliga West in each of the next three seasons, and again played their way to the national final. They won the 1962 match 4–0 over 1. FC Nürnberg, resulting in entry to the 1962–63 European Cup, where they were one of the favourites to win the trophy. In the first round, Köln visited Dundee F.C. of Scotland and lost 1–8, and despite winning the second leg back in Germany by 4–0, they were out of the tournament. In the following year&#x27;s national final, they lost 1–3 to Borussia Dortmund.

===Continuing success===

In 1963, FC Köln was selected as one of the original 16 teams to play in the Bundesliga, Germany&#x27;s new professional football league. Köln continued their winning ways by becoming the first Bundesliga champion, in the league&#x27;s inaugural 1963–64 season. As German champions, Köln entered the 1964–65 European Cup, where it met England&#x27;s Liverpool at the quarter-final stage. After two 0–0 draws, a third game was played which was also a stalemate, this time 2–2. As the penalty shootout had not yet been introduced as the means of deciding a tie, Köln went out of the competition on the toss of a coin. Ironically enough, there was the need for a second coin toss because the first time the coin stuck vertically in the ground. The club also became the first Bundesliga side to field a Brazilian player, when it signed Zézé for a then club record fee of DM 150,000. Domestically, Köln recorded a second-place finish in the 1964–65 Bundesliga season and won its first DFB-Pokal in 1967–68.

At the start of the 1970s, Köln reached three DFB-Pokal finals in four seasons, losing all three; to Kickers Offenbach in 1970, Bayern Munich in 1971 and Borussia Mönchengladbach in 1973. The team also achieved another second place Bundesliga finish in 1973, before reaching another DFB-Pokal final in 1977, beating Hertha BSC over two legs to win the trophy for the second time.

In 1977–78, FC Köln enjoyed its most successful season, winning the Bundesliga title, its third national title overall, and retaining the DFB-Pokal. This makes Köln one of only four clubs to have won the double in the Bundesliga era.

Köln had another losing DFB-Pokal final appearance in 1980, before winning the competition for a fourth time in 1983. In 1986, the club appeared in its first European final, losing 5–3 on aggregate to Real Madrid in the UEFA Cup Final. Two second place Bundesliga finishes, in 1988–89 and 1989–90, and another DFB-Pokal final loss in 1991, marked the end of a glorious thirty-year period for FC Köln.

===21st century: ups and downs===

In recent years, the club&#x27;s performance has been mixed. The FC holds the distinction of the longest goalless streak in Bundesliga history, set in the 2001–02 Bundesliga season, with 1034 minutes (equivalent to 11-and-a-half games) until Thomas Cichon scored again.
In the early years of the Bundesliga, 1. FC Köln was the most successful club in West Germany in terms of total points won. Beginning in the early 1990s, however, the club&#x27;s performance declined, and in 1998 it was relegated for the first time. Since about 2000, the side has been a &quot;yo-yo team&quot;, moving between the first and second divisions. It returned to the Bundesliga at the end of the 2004–05 season, as 2. Bundesliga champions, after having been relegated the season before. There was little optimism about their return to the top flight, as they were picked by German football magazine &quot;kicker&quot; as one of the clubs most likely to be relegated.

This prediction came true when Köln lost to Hamburger SV 1–0 in the third-to-last match of the season. The club finished the season in second-last place and was relegated after conceding a league-worst 71 goals. The team&#x27;s most prolific goal scorer was Lukas Podolski with a total of 12 goals, who transferred to Bayern Munich after the end of the season. He also appeared with the Germany national team at the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

In late 2006, former coach Christoph Daum returned to the 2. Bundesliga club, and succeeded in leading the club back to the Bundesliga in 2008. After asuring Köln&#x27;s Bundesliga status in the 2008-09 campaign, Daum left Köln for his former club Fenerbahçe. Köln&#x27;s former star-striker Lukas Podolski returned for the 2009–10 season.

After a poor run of form in the 2010–11 season, recording only one win from its opening nine Bundesliga fixtures, Köln replaced coach Zvonimir Soldo with Frank Schaefer. Schaefer, who was originally in charge of the under-23 team of Köln, decided after the season that he would rather spend more time with his family than be a coach in the Bundesliga. Former Norwegian international and recent Copenhagen coach Ståle Solbakken replaced him. After earning just eight points in the first 13 matches of the second half of the season, Schaefer was reappointed as the club&#x27;s interim manager, assisted by former Köln player Dirk Lottner. The club, however, was relegated at the end of the season, finishing in 17th place, having accumulated €33m debt, and €11m negative equity.

===Turnaround (2012–2017)===
In April 2012, the club members elected a new board of directors, Werner Spinner as president, Markus Ritterbach for marketing, and Toni Schumacher for sport. In the 2012–13 season, under new trainer Holger Stanislawski, Köln finished in fifth place in the 2. Bundesliga, missing out on promotion back to the top division.

In 2012 the board hired Jörg Jakobs as director of football, who then got promoted in 2014 to sporting director, chief scout and director of the academy. In January 2013, Alexander Wehrle joined as managing director of FC Köln ltd. Wehrle was working as assistant for VfB Stuttgart president Erwin Staudt, especially for rebuilding the stadium. In summer 2013, Peter Stöger and Manfred Schmid were hired as coaching team, and Jörg Schmadtke as general manager. 2013–14 Köln finished first in the 2. Bundesliga and earned promotion to the top division. It was followed by a 12th place 2014–15, ninth in 2015–16, and fifth place in 2016–17. 25 years after the club&#x27;s last appearance in international football to date they qualified for the Europa League. After restructuring and repaying debt, equity turned from €11m negative to €20m positive. The turnover increased from €56m in 2012/13 to more than €120m in 2016/17.

===Decline and changes (2018–)===
After the club&#x27;s return the European stage, fortunes quickly changed. The team experienced an unsuccessful start to the 2017–18 Bundesliga season gaining only three points from its first sixteen matches. At the same time, the club&#x27;s Europa League campaign ended after the group stage. This downtrend led to the resignation of Jörg Schmadtke and Stöger&#x27;s dismissal in December 2017; he was replaced by Stefan Ruthenbeck, who was appointed as caretaker manager. In spite of an improved record in the second half of the season, the team finished last and were relegated to 2. Bundesliga at the end of the year.
Ahead of the 2018–19 season, Markus Anfang was appointed manager with a mandate to achieve an immediate return to the top flight. While the club occupied the league&#x27;s top spot for much of the season, Anfang was dismissed after a winless streak in April 2019. Just a week later, with André Pawlak having taken over as Anfang&#x27;s successor, the team achieved promotion with a 0–4 victory over Greuther Fürth. On 13 May 2019, the club announced that Jahn Regensburg manager Achim Beierlorzer would assume its vacant head coaching position from the upcoming season. He was signed to a contract until 2021. Following an unsuccessful start to the 2019–20 season, which included a 3–2 cup defeat against 1. FC Saarbrücken, the club decided to terminate Beierlorzer&#x27;s contract on 9 November 2019. Sporting director Armin Veh, who weeks earlier had announced that he would not extend his contract with the club, was also dismissed from his position. On 18 November, former HSV manager Markus Gisdol was appointed to the club&#x27;s head coaching position, while Horst Heldt was made sporting director. Both signed contracts until 2021. After avoiding relegation at the end of the season, Gisdol&#x27;s contract was extended until 2023. 

During the majority of the 2020–21 season, Köln was involved in a relegation battle and occupied one of the bottom three places in the division. On 11 April 2021, after losing to relegation rival Mainz 05, Gisdol was dismissed from his position as head coach. The next day, the club presented Friedhelm Funkel as an interim coach who would take over head coaching duties until the end of the season. On 11 May, it was reported that SC Paderborn manager Steffen Baumgart would succeed Funkel as head coach at the beginning of the 2021–22 season. Funkel&#x27;s side faced Holstein Kiel in the relegation playoffs. After losing 0–1 at home, his team recorded a 1–5 away win, enabling the club to retain its position in the Bundesliga. On 1 April 2022, the club appointed Christian Keller as its new managing director, a position that had been vacant since the dismissal of Heldt in May 2021.

In March 2023, during the second half of the 2022–23 campaign, Köln were put under a two-window transfer embargo by FIFA&#x27;s Dispute Resolution Chamber, having been found guilty of inducing a breach of contract without just cause while signing Jaka Čuber Potočnik from Olimpija Ljubljana in January 2022. As part of the same verdict, the club was also sentenced to pay Ljubljana a €51,750 compensation, in addition to training costs. Köln appealed the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, which affirmed the embargo imposed by FIFA.
In the 2023–24 Bundesliga season, Köln were relegated to the 2. Bundesliga after finishing second bottom on the table.

==Stadium==
The team plays its home matches in the Müngersdorfer Stadion, also known as the RheinEnergie Stadion for sponsorship purposes. It has a capacity of around 50,000 and the average attendance in the 2015–16 season was 48,676. The stadium sponsorship comes from a contract with the local power supplier RheinEnergie AG. However, most fans still call the stadium &quot;Müngersdorfer Stadion&quot;, named after the suburb of Müngersdorf, where it is located.

The club owns the &quot;Geißbockheim&quot; training centre, currently known as &quot;RheinEnergieSportpark&quot; for sponsorship, located in Sülz, which is a municipal part of Köln in the southwest of the city. The centre is home to the &quot;Franz-Kremer-Stadion&quot; the home of 1. FC Köln II.

<doc id="497890" wikidata="Q1932371" url="?curid=497890" title="The Adventures of Milo and Otis">
<text>is a 1986 Japanese adventure comedy-drama film about two animals: Milo, an orange tabby cat, and Otis, a pug. The original Japanese version, narrated by Shigeru Tsuyuki and with poetry recitation by Kyōko Koizumi, was released on July 12, 1986. Columbia Pictures removed 15 minutes from the original film and released a shorter English-language version, written by Mark Saltzman and narrated by Dudley Moore, on August 25, 1989.

==Plot==
The film opens on Nippon Farm, with a mother cat who has given birth to kittens. One of the kittens is named Milo, or Chatran in the Japanese version (, literally Brown Tiger), and has a habit of being too curious and getting himself into trouble. He finds a pug puppy named Otis, or Poosky in the Japanese version (), and they soon become friends. When Milo is hiding inside a box floating in the river, it breaks loose from the dock, and he accidentally drifts downstream. Otis runs after Milo, who himself goes on many adventures, escaping one obstacle after another.

Milo encounters a bear, escapes from a raven and Deadwood Swamp, steals a dead muskrat from a fox, follows a railroad called Nippon Bearway to the home of a deer who shelters him, sleeps in a nest with an owl, stays for a while with a pig and her piglets, catches a fish and is robbed of it by a raccoon, is mobbed by seagulls, and evades another bear, then a snake, before falling into a deep pit.

For his part, Otis follows Milo throughout, usually only an hour behind and less than a mile out of range. Finally, the two catch up with one another. While Milo is in the hole, Otis pulls him out by means of a rope. Milo and Otis are reunited, and soon find mates of their own: Joyce, a white cat, for Milo; and Sondra, a French pug, for Otis. Afterward, they briefly part ways and raise offspring of their own. Later, Milo, Otis, Joyce, and Sondra (along with their litters) happily find their way back together through the forest to their farm as the credits roll.

==Video game adaptation==
In 1986, to tie in with the original Japanese version of the film, a video game was released for the Japan-exclusive Famicom Disk System.

==Release==
The film was shown during the film market at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival before opening on 200 screens in Japan on July 12, 1986.

==Reception==
===Box office===
It was the number-one Japanese film on the domestic market in 1986, earning in distribution income that year. It grossed a total of ($90,822,000) in Japan. At the time, it was the third highest-grossing film ever in Japan, beaten only by &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982) and &quot;Antarctica&quot; (1983).

In the United States, &quot;The Adventures of Milo and Otis&quot; grossed , adding up to a combined grossed in Japan and the United States.

Adjusted for inflation, the film grossed the equivalent of in Japan and in the United States as of , for a combined inflation-adjusted in Japan and the United States.

In terms of box office admissions, the film sold tickets in Japan, tickets in the United States, and 1,318,750 tickets in Germany and France, for a combined tickets sold in Japan, North America and Mainland Europe.

===Home media===
In 2010, the film&#x27;s DVD version sold 810,334 units and grossed $5,464,010 in the United States. It was released on Blu-ray on January 24, 2012.

===Critical reception===
Reviews for the US version were positive, with an 80% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 10 reviews and an average rating of 6.9/10. Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;.

==Animal welfare allegations==
When the film was released, some animal welfare organizations alleged to have had a number of complaints from people who had seen the film and were concerned that it could not have been made without cruelty. The Tasmanian and Victorian branches of the RSPCA also alleged abuse.

The film was reported to have the approval of the American Humane Society. The American Humane Association attempted to investigate cruelty rumors through &quot;contacts in Europe who normally have information on movies throughout the world.&quot; While noting that the contacts had also heard the allegations, they were unable to verify them. The organization also reported, &quot;We have tried through humane people in Japan, and through another Japanese producer to determine if these rumors are true, but everything has led to a dead end.&quot; The same report noted that several Japanese Humane Societies allowed their names to be used in connection with the film and that the film &quot;shows no animals being injured or harmed.&quot;

==Awards==
* The Japanese Academy (1987)
** Won: Popularity Award - Most Popular Film
** Nominated: Award of the Japanese Academy - Best Music Score (Ryuichi Sakamoto)

<doc id="497891" wikidata="Q2422376" url="?curid=497891" title="Precomposed character">
<text>A precomposed character (alternatively composite character or decomposable character) is a Unicode entity that can also be defined as a sequence of one or more other characters. A precomposed character may typically represent a letter with a diacritical mark, such as &quot;é&quot; (Latin small letter &quot;e&quot; with acute accent). Technically, &quot;é&quot; (U+00E9) is a character that can be decomposed into an equivalent string of the base letter &quot;e&quot; (U+0065) and combining acute accent (U+0301). Similarly, ligatures are precompositions of their constituent letters or graphemes.

Precomposed characters are the legacy solution for representing many special letters in various character sets. In Unicode, they are included primarily to aid computer systems with incomplete Unicode support, where equivalent decomposed characters may render incorrectly.

== Comparing precomposed and decomposed characters ==

In the following example, there is a common Swedish surname Åström written in the two alternative methods, the first one with a precomposed &quot;Å&quot; (U+00C5) and &quot;ö&quot; (U+00F6), and the second one using a decomposed base letter &quot;A&quot; (U+0041) with a combining ring above (U+030A) and an &quot;o&quot; (U+006F) with a combining diaeresis (U+0308).

#Åström (U+00C5 U+0073 U+0074 U+0072 U+00F6 U+006D)
#Åström (U+0041 U+030A U+0073 U+0074 U+0072 U+006F U+0308 U+006D)

Except for the different colors, the two solutions are equivalent and should render identically. In practice, however, some Unicode implementations still have difficulties with decomposed characters. In the worst case, combining diacritics may be disregarded or rendered as unrecognized characters after their base letters, as they are not included in all fonts. To overcome the problems, some applications may simply attempt to replace the decomposed characters with the equivalent precomposed characters.

With an incomplete font, however, precomposed characters may also be problematic – especially if they are more exotic, as in the following example (showing the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European word for &quot;dog&quot;):

#ḱṷṓn (U+1E31 U+1E77 U+1E53 U+006E)
#ḱṷṓn (U+006B U+0301 U+0075 U+032D U+006F U+0304 U+0301 U+006E)

In some situations, the precomposed green k, u and o with diacritics may render as unrecognized characters, or their typographical appearance may be very different from the final letter n with no diacritic. On the second line, the base letters should at least render correctly even if the combining diacritics could not be recognized.

OpenType has the &quot;ccmp&quot; &quot;feature tag&quot; to define glyphs that are compositions or decompositions involving combining characters.

== Chinese characters ==
In theory, most Chinese characters as encoded by Han unification and similar schemes could be treated as precomposed characters, since they can be reduced (decomposed) to their constituent radical and phonetic components with Chinese character description languages. Such an approach could reduce the number of characters in the character set from tens of thousands to just a few thousand. On the other hand, a decomposed character set would introduce challenges for searching and editing software and require more bytes of encoding per document. One particular challenge would be the multiple-to-multiple projections between the set of decomposed characters and the precomposed character—one precomposed character may be decomposed into multiple different sets of decomposed characters while one set of decomposed characters could contract themselves into multiple different precomposed characters. There is no strict requirement or constraints regarding the relative position between components within a character, the form of variant and transform (narrow, widen, stretch, rotate, etc.) applied on components, nor the number of each components.

<text>A vacuum fluorescent display (VFD) is a display device once commonly used on consumer electronics equipment such as video cassette recorders, car radios, and microwave ovens.

A VFD operates on the principle of cathodoluminescence, roughly similar to a cathode-ray tube, but operating at much lower voltages. Each tube in a VFD has a phosphor-coated carbon anode that is bombarded by electrons emitted from the cathode filament. In fact, each tube in a VFD is a triode vacuum tube because it also has a mesh control grid.

Unlike liquid crystal displays (LCDs), a VFD emits very bright light with high contrast and can support display elements of various colors. Standard illumination figures for VFDs are around 640 cd/m2 with high-brightness VFDs operating at 4,000 cd/m2, and experimental units as high as 35,000 cd/m2 depending on the drive voltage and its timing. The choice of color (which determines the nature of the phosphor) and display brightness significantly affect the lifetime of the tubes, which can range from as low as 1,500 hours for a vivid red VFD to 30,000 hours for the more common green ones. Cadmium was commonly used in the phosphors of VFDs in the past, but the current RoHS-compliant VFDs have eliminated this metal from their construction, using instead phosphors consisting of a matrix of alkaline earth and very small amounts of group III metals, doped with very small amounts of rare earth metals.

VFDs can display seven-segment numerals, multi-segment alpha-numeric characters or can be made in a dot-matrix to display different alphanumeric characters and symbols. In practice, there is little limit to the shape of the image that can be displayed: it depends solely on the shape of phosphor on the anode(s).

The first VFD was the single indication DM160 by Philips in 1959. The first multi-segment VFD was a 1967 Japanese single-digit, seven-segment device made by Ise Electronics Corporation. The displays became common on calculators and other consumer electronics devices. In the late 1980s hundreds of millions of units were made yearly.

== Design ==

The device consists of a hot cathode (filaments), grids and anodes (phosphor) encased in a glass envelope under a high vacuum condition. The cathode is made up of fine tungsten wires, coated by alkaline earth metal oxides (barium, strontium and calcium oxides), which emit electrons when heated to 650 °C by an electric current. These electrons are controlled and diffused by the grids (made using photochemical machining), which are made up of thin (50 micron thick) stainless steel. If electrons impinge on the phosphor-coated anode plates, they fluoresce, emitting light. Unlike the orange-glowing cathodes of traditional vacuum tubes, VFD cathodes are efficient emitters at much lower temperatures, and are therefore essentially invisible. The anode consists of a glass plate with electrically conductive traces (each trace is connected to a single indicator segment), which is coated with an insulator, which is then partially etched to create holes which are then filled with a conductor like graphite, which in turn is coated with phosphor. This transfers energy from the trace to the segment. The shape of the phosphor will determine the shape of the VFD&#x27;s segments. The most widely used phosphor is Zinc-doped copper-activated Zinc oxide, which generates light at a peak wavelength of 505 nm.

The cathode wire to which the oxides are applied is made of tungsten or ruthenium-tungsten alloy. The oxides in the cathodes are not stable in air, so they are applied to the cathode as carbonates, the cathodes are assembled into the VFD, and the cathodes are heated by passing a current through them while inside the vacuum of the VFD to convert the carbonates into oxides.

The principle of operation is identical to that of a vacuum tube triode. Electrons can only reach (and &quot;illuminate&quot;) a given plate element if both the grid and the plate are at a positive potential with respect to the cathode. This allows the displays to be organized as multiplexed displays where the multiple grids and plates form a matrix, minimizing the number of signal pins required. In the example of the VCR display shown to the right, the grids are arranged so that only one digit is illuminated at a time. All of the similar plates in all of the digits (for example, all of the lower-left plates in all of the digits) are connected in parallel. One by one, the microprocessor driving the display enables a digit by placing a positive voltage on that digit&#x27;s grid and then placing a positive voltage on the appropriate plates. Electrons flow through that digit&#x27;s grid and strike those plates that are at a positive potential. The microprocessor cycles through illuminating the digits in this way at a rate high enough to create the illusion of all digits glowing at once via persistence of vision.

The extra indicators (in our example, &quot;VCR&quot;, &quot;Hi-Fi&quot;, &quot;STEREO&quot;, &quot;SAP&quot;, etc.) are arranged as if they were segments of an additional digit or two or extra segments of existing digits and are scanned using the same multiplexed strategy as the real digits. Some of these extra indicators may use a phosphor that emits a different color of light, for example, orange.

The light emitted by most VFDs contains many colors and can often be filtered to enhance the color saturation providing a deep green or deep blue, depending on the whims of the product&#x27;s designers. Phosphors used in VFDs are different from those in cathode-ray displays since they must emit acceptable brightness with only around 50 volts of electron energy, compared to several thousand volts in a CRT. The insulating layer in a VFD is normally black, however it can be removed or made transparent to allow the display to be transparent. AMVFD displays that incorporate a driver IC are available for applications that require high image brightness and an increased number of pixels. Phosphors of different colors can be stacked on top of each other for achieving gradations and various color combinations. Hybrid VFDs include both fixed display segments and a graphic VFD in the same unit. VFDs may have display segments, grids and related circuitry on their front and rear glass panels, using a central cathode for both panels, allowing for increased segment density. The segments can also be placed exclusively on the front instead of on the back, improving viewing angles and brightness.

== Use ==

Besides brightness, VFDs have the advantages of being rugged, inexpensive, and easily configured to display a wide variety of customized messages, and unlike LCDs, VFDs are not limited by the response time of rearranging liquid crystals and are thus able to function normally in cold, even sub-zero, temperatures, making them ideal for outdoor devices in cold climates. Early on, the main disadvantage of such displays was their use of significantly more power (0.2 watts) than a simple LCD. This was considered a significant drawback for battery-operated equipment like calculators, so VFDs ended up being used mainly in equipment powered by an AC supply or heavy-duty rechargeable batteries.
During the 1980s, this display began to be used in automobiles, especially where car makers were experimenting with digital displays for vehicle instruments such as speedometers and odometers. A good example of these were the high-end Subaru cars made in the early 1980s (referred to by Subaru enthusiasts as a &quot;digi-dash&quot;, or digital dashboard). The brightness of VFDs makes them well suited for use in cars. The Renault Espace Mk4 and Scenic Mk2 used VFD panels to show all functions on the dashboard including the radio and multi message panel. They are bright enough to read in full sunlight as well as dimmable for use at night. This panel uses four colors; the usual blue/green as well as deep blue, red and yellow/orange.

This technology was also used from 1979 to the mid-1980s in portable electronic game units. These games featured bright, clear displays but the size of the largest vacuum tubes that could be manufactured inexpensively kept the size of the displays quite small, often requiring the use of magnifying Fresnel lenses. While later games had sophisticated multi-color displays, early games achieved color effects using transparent filters to change the color of the (usually light blue) light emitted by the phosphors. High power consumption and high manufacturing cost contributed to the demise of the VFD as a videogame display. LCD games could be manufactured for a fraction of the price, did not require frequent changes of batteries (or AC adapters) and were much more portable. Since the late 1990s, backlit color active-matrix LCD displays have been able to cheaply reproduce arbitrary images in any color, a marked advantage over fixed-color, fixed-character VFDs. This is one of the main reasons for the decline in popularity of VFDs, although they continue to be made. Many low-cost DVD players still feature VFDs. 

From the mid-1980s onwards, VFDs were used for applications requiring smaller displays with high brightness specifications, though now the adoption of high-brightness organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is pushing VFDs out of these markets.

Vacuum fluorescent displays were once commonly used as floor indicators for elevators by Otis Elevator Company worldwide and Montgomery Elevator Company in North America (the former from the early 1980s to the late-2000s in the form of (usually two) green 16-segment displays, and the latter from the mid 1980s to the early 2000s in the form of (usually 3) green or blue 10x14 dot-matrix displays, one for the arrow and the other two for the digits).

In addition to the widely used fixed character VFD, a graphic type made of an array of individually addressable pixels is also available. These more sophisticated displays offer the flexibility of displaying arbitrary images, and may still be a useful choice for some types of consumer equipment.

Multiplexing may be used in VFDs to reduce the number of connections necessary to drive the display.

=== Use as amplifier ===

Several radio amateurs have experimented with the possibilities of using VFDs as triode amplifiers. In 2015, Korg released the Nutube, an analogue audio amplifier component based on VFD technology. The Nutube is used in applications such as guitar amplifiers from Vox and the Apex Sangaku headphone amplifier. The Nutube is sold by Korg but made by Noritake Itron.

== Fade ==

Fading is sometimes a problem with VFDs. Light output drops over time due to falling emission and reduction of phosphor efficiency. How quickly and how far this falls depends on the construction and operation of the VFD. In some equipment, loss of VFD output can render the equipment inoperable. Fading can be slowed by using a display driver chip to lower the voltages necessary to drive a VFD. Fading can also occur due to evaporation and contamination of the cathode. Phosphors that contain sulfur are more susceptible to fading.

Emission may usually be restored by raising filament voltage. Thirty-three percent voltage boost can rectify moderate fade, and 66% boost severe fade. This can make the filaments visible in use, though the usual green-blue VFD filter helps reduce any such red or orange light from the filament.

== History ==

Of the three prevalent display technologies – VFD, LCD, and LED – the VFD was the first to be developed. VFD and LED displays were used in early handheld calculators. LED displays were an alternative to VFDs in this use as they had simpler power requirements, not requiring the high voltages. Choice of display technology varied through commercial decisions by the manufacturer, with companies such as Casio, Canon &amp; Sharp dropping LED displays in preference to VFDs and early LCDs, whereas Texas Instruments and Hewlett Packard, both manufacturers of LED displays, continued with LED technology for much longer. Later, once LCD technology was well established, it displaced LED displays and VFDs in handheld calculators, offering lower power requirements at lower cost. More recently, outside the education sector, calculator applications on mobile phones have for many replaced the pocket calculator, and there is progression from LED backlit LCDs back to full LED displays in the form of Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) displays.

The first VFD was the single indication DM160 by Philips in 1959. It could easily be driven by transistors, so was aimed at computer applications as it was easier to drive than a neon and had longer life than a light bulb. The 1967 Japanese single digit seven segment display in terms of anode was more like the Philips DM70 / DM71 Magic Eye as the DM160 has a spiral wire anode. The Japanese seven segment VFD meant that no patent royalties needed to be paid on desk calculator displays as would have been the case using Nixie tubes or Panaplex neon digits or for LED displays on pocket calculators. In the UK the Philips designs were made and marketed by Mullard (almost wholly owned by Philips even before WWII).

The Russian IV-15 VFD tube is very similar to the DM160. The DM160, DM70/DM71 and Russian IV-15 can (like a VFD panel) be used as triodes. The DM160 is thus the smallest VFD and smallest triode valve. The IV-15 is slightly different shape (see photo of DM160 and IV-15 for comparison).

<doc id="497902" wikidata="Q221598" url="?curid=497902" title="European System of Central Banks">
<text>The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) is an institution that comprises the European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks (NCBs) of all 27 member states of the European Union (EU). Its objective is to ensure price stability throughout the EU, and improve monetary and financial cooperation between eurozone and non-eurozone member states of the EU.

==Organization==
The process of decision-making in the Eurosystem is centralized through the decision-making bodies of the ECB, namely the Governing Council and the Executive Board. As long as there are EU member states which have not adopted the euro, a third decision-making body, the General Council, shall also exist. The NCBs of the member states that do not participate in the eurozone are members of the ESCB with a special statuswhile they are allowed to conduct their respective national monetary policies, they do not take part in the decision-making with regard to the single monetary policy for the eurozone and the implementation of such decisions.

The Governing Council comprises all the members of the executive board and the governors of the NCBs of the member states without a derogation, that is, those countries which have adopted the euro. The main responsibilities of the Governing Council are:
*Adopt the guidelines and take the decisions necessary to ensure the performance of the tasks entrusted to the Eurosystem
*Formulate the monetary policy of the eurozone, including, as appropriate, decisions relating to intermediate monetary objectives, key interest rates, and the supply of reserves in the Eurosystem
*Establish the necessary guidelines for their implementation

The executive board comprises the President, the Vice-President and four other members, all chosen from among persons of recognized standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters. They are appointed by common accord of the governments of the member states at the level of the Heads of State or Government, on a recommendation from the Council of Ministers after it has consulted the European Parliament and the Governing Council of the ECB (i.e., the Council of the European Monetary Institute (EMI) for the first appointments). The main responsibilities of the executive board are:
*Implement monetary policy in accordance with the guidelines and decisions laid down by the Governing Council of the ECB and, in doing so, to give the necessary instructions to the NCBs
*Execute those powers which have been delegated to it by the Governing Council of the ECB

The General Council comprises the President and the Vice-President and the governors of the NCBs of all 27 member states. The General Council performs the tasks which the ECB took over from the EMI and which, owing to the derogation of one or more member states, still have to be performed in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The General Council also contributes to:
* ECB&#x27;s advisory functions
* Collection of statistical information
* Preparation of the ECB&#x27;s annual reports
* Establishment of the necessary rules for standardising the accounting and reporting of operations undertaken by the NCBs
* Taking of measures relating to the establishment of the key for the ECB&#x27;s capital subscription other than those already laid down in the Treaty
* Laying-down of the conditions of employment of the members of staff of the ECB
* Necessary preparations for irrevocably fixing the exchange rates of the currencies of the member states with a derogation against the euro

The Statute of the ESCB makes provision for the following measures to ensure security of tenure for NCB governors and members of the Executive Board:
* Minimum renewable term of office for national central bank governors of five years
* Minimum non-renewable term of office for members of the Executive Board of eight years (a system of staggered appointments was used for the first executive board for members other than the President in order to ensure continuity)
* Removal from office is only possible in the event of incapacity or serious misconduct; in this respect the Court of Justice of the European Union is competent to settle any disputes

==Member banks==
The ESCB is composed of the European Central Bank and the national central banks of all 27 member states of the EU. The first section of the following list lists member states and their central banks that form the Eurosystem (plus the ECB), which set eurozone monetary policy. The second section lists member states and their central banks that maintain separate currencies.

<doc id="497913" wikidata="Q508131" url="?curid=497913" title="Andrew Turnbull, Baron Turnbull">
<text>Andrew Turnbull, Baron Turnbull, (born 21 January 1945) is a British politician and civil servant who served as the head of Her Majesty&#x27;s Civil Service and Cabinet Secretary between 2002 and 2005, when he was succeeded by Sir Gus O&#x27;Donnell. He now sits in the House of Lords as a crossbencher.

==Education==
Turnbull was educated at Enfield Grammar School and Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he studied economics.

==Career==
Turnbull was appointed an Overseas Development Institute Fellow in 1968 and was posted to work as an economist in the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Foreign Trade in Lusaka, Zambia. Turnbull served as Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister under Margaret Thatcher and John Major (1988–1992). He served as Defra permanent secretary then Permanent Secretary to the Treasury (1998–2002), the latter traditionally the second-highest-ranking Civil Service post, before succeeding to the highest-ranking post.

The two most senior civil service roles at the top of government have in recent decades been filled by the same individual. As head of the civil service, Lord Turnbull was akin to the chief executive of the organisation, though the lines of reporting are somewhat more complex than is typical in the private sector since Permanent Secretaries (senior civil servants within each department of government) report to ministers. As Cabinet Secretary, a post created in 1916, Turnbull was responsible for the organisation of the Cabinet Office, providing support to the Prime Minister and to the government as a whole. When Turnbull succeeded to the dual role on 2 September 2002, Prime Minister Tony Blair asked him to focus on the management of the civil service, and to make its reorganisation his priority.

Turnbull was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1990, a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in the 1992 Birthday Honours and promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 1998 Birthday Honours.

He was created a life peer as Baron Turnbull, of Enfield in the London Borough of Enfield, on 11 October 2005.

He has taken on directorships, and in 2007 was listed as Senior Executive Advisor with Booz Allen Hamilton. He is a patron of international development charity Zambia Orphans Aid UK, of which he was formerly the chairman.

==Controversy==

===Iraq war===
Turnbull became involved in controversy when on 28 February 2004 he wrote a formal letter admonishing ex-minister Clare Short for making media statements alleging that British intelligence had intercepted communications from (among others) Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan. Short made the confidential letter public, and in turn rebuked Turnbull for allegedly allowing the government decision-making machinery to crumble in the run-up to the 2003 Iraq war. Short suggested that the government&#x27;s legal expert, Attorney General Lord Goldsmith, had been &quot;leant on&quot; to provide advice that war would be legal. She argued that Turnbull had been responsible for what she alleged was inadequate Cabinet scrutiny of the legal advice, of the basis for the decision to go to war and the alternatives:

: &quot;He allowed us to rush to war in Iraq without defence and overseas policy meeting, looking at all the military options and the diplomatic options and political options. (He) allowed the Joint Intelligence Committee to meet with Alastair Campbell chairing it.&quot;

In March 2005, Lord Turnbull revealed that Lord Goldsmith&#x27;s opinion on the legality of the Iraq War was only one page long.

Turnbull gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry on 13 January 2010.

===Opinion of Gordon Brown===
On 20 March 2007, the day before the 2007 budget was announced, he gave an interview with the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in which he described Gordon Brown as acting with &quot;Stalinist ruthlessness&quot;, contrary to the convention that former civil servants do not talk to the media about serving government ministers.

===Environmental views===
He is a trustee of the Global Warming Policy Foundation. In 2011, the Foundation issued a report under Turnbull&#x27;s name, which stated that global temperatures were &quot;on a plateau&quot;. The report also called for more scepticism about global warming.

==Personal life==
Lord Turnbull has been married to his wife Diane since 1967 and has two sons. He lists his hobbies as golf, opera and sailing. He has also served on the Dulwich College Board of Governors, and was its chairman from 2009 to 2015.

<doc id="497916" wikidata="Q430728" url="?curid=497916" title="Apollo (spacecraft)">
<text>The Apollo spacecraft was composed of three parts designed to accomplish the American Apollo program&#x27;s goal of landing astronauts on the Moon by the end of the 1960s and returning them safely to Earth. The expendable (single-use) spacecraft consisted of a combined command and service module (CSM) and an Apollo Lunar Module (LM). Two additional components complemented the spacecraft stack for space vehicle assembly: a spacecraft–LM adapter (SLA) designed to shield the LM from the aerodynamic stress of launch and to connect the CSM to the Saturn launch vehicle and a launch escape system (LES) to carry the crew in the command module safely away from the launch vehicle in the event of a launch emergency.

The design was based on the lunar orbit rendezvous approach: two docked spacecraft were sent to the Moon and went into lunar orbit. While the LM separated and landed, the CSM remained in orbit. After the lunar excursion, the two craft rendezvoused and docked in lunar orbit, and the CSM returned the crew to Earth. The command module was the only part of the space vehicle that returned with the crew to the Earth&#x27;s surface.

The LES was jettisoned during launch upon reaching the point where it was no longer needed, and the SLA remained attached to the launch vehicle&#x27;s upper stage. Two uncrewed CSMs, one uncrewed LM, and one crewed CSM were carried into space by Saturn IB launch vehicles for low Earth orbit Apollo missions. Larger Saturn Vs launched two uncrewed CSMs on high Earth orbit test flights, the CSM on one crewed lunar mission, the complete spacecraft on one crewed low Earth orbit mission, and eight crewed lunar missions. After conclusion of the Apollo program, four CSMs were launched on Saturn IBs for three Skylab Earth orbital missions and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.

==Command and service module==

The major part of the Apollo spacecraft was a three-man vehicle designed for Earth orbital, translunar, and lunar orbital flight, and return to Earth. This consisted of a &quot;command module&quot; supported by a &quot;service module&quot;, built by North American Aviation (later North American Rockwell).

===Command module (CM)===

The command module was the control center for the Apollo spacecraft and living quarters for the three crewmen. It contained the pressurized main crew cabin, crew couches, control and instrument panel, Primary Guidance, Navigation and Control System, communications systems, environmental control system, batteries, heat shield, reaction control system to provide attitude control, forward docking hatch, side hatch, five windows, and a parachute recovery system. It was the only part of the Apollo/Saturn space vehicle that returned to Earth intact.

===Service module (SM)===

The service module was unpressurized and contained a main service propulsion engine and hypergolic propellant to enter and leave lunar orbit, a reaction control system to provide attitude control and translational capability, fuel cells with hydrogen and oxygen reactants, radiators to dump waste heat into space, and a high gain antenna. The oxygen was also used for breathing, and the fuel cells produced water for drinking and environmental control. On Apollo 15, 16 and 17 it also carried a scientific instrument package, with a mapping camera and a small sub-satellite to study the Moon.

A major portion of the service module was taken up by propellant and the main rocket engine. Capable of multiple restarts, this engine placed the Apollo spacecraft into and out of lunar orbit, and was used for mid-course corrections between the Earth and the Moon.

The service module remained attached to the command module throughout the mission. It was jettisoned just prior to reentry into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

==Lunar Module (LM)==
The Apollo Lunar Module was a separate vehicle designed to land on the Moon and return to lunar orbit, and was the first true &quot;spaceship&quot; since it flew solely in the vacuum of space. It consisted of a &quot;descent stage&quot; and an &quot;ascent stage&quot;. It supplied life support systems for two astronauts for up to four to five days on the Apollo 15, 16 and 17 missions. The spacecraft was designed and manufactured by the Grumman Aircraft Company.

The descent stage contained the landing gear, landing radar antenna, descent propulsion system, and fuel to land on the Moon. It also had several cargo compartments used to carry, among other things: the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Packages ALSEP, the modularized equipment transporter (MET) (a hand-pulled equipment cart used on Apollo 14), the Lunar Rover (Apollo 15, 16 and 17), a surface television camera, surface tools, and lunar sample collection boxes.

The ascent stage contained the crew cabin, instrument panels, overhead hatch/docking port, forward hatch, optical and electronic guidance systems, reaction control system, radar and communications antennas, ascent rocket engine and propellant to return to lunar orbit and rendezvous with the Apollo Command and Service Modules.

==Spacecraft–lunar module adapter (SLA)==

The spacecraft–LM adapter (SLA), built by North American Aviation (Rockwell), was a conical aluminum structure that connected the service module to the Saturn S-IVB rocket stage. It also protected the LM, the service propulsion system engine nozzle, and the launch-vehicle-to-service-module umbilical during launch and ascent through the atmosphere. 

The SLA was composed of four fixed panels bolted to the Instrument Unit on top of the S-IVB stage, which were connected via hinges to four panels which opened from the top similar to flower petals.

The SLA was made from aluminum honeycomb material. The exterior of the SLA was covered by a thin () layer of cork and painted white to minimize thermal stresses during ascent.

The service module was bolted to a flange at the top of the longer panels, and power to the SLA multiply-redundant pyrotechnics was provided by an umbilical. Because a failure to separate from the S-IVB stage could leave the crew stranded in orbit, the separation system used multiple signal paths, multiple detonators and multiple explosive charges where the detonation of one charge would set off another even if the detonator on that charge failed to function.

Once in space, the astronauts pressed the &#x27;CSM/LV Sep&#x27; button on the control panel to separate the CSM from the launch vehicle. Detonating cord was ignited around the flange between the SM and SLA, and along the joints between the four SLA panels, releasing the SM and blowing apart the connections between the panels. Dual-redundant pyrotechnic thrusters at the lower end of the SLA panels then fired to rotate them around the hinges at 30–60 degrees per second.

On all flights through Apollo 7, the SLA panels remained hinged to the S-IVB and opened to a 45-degree angle, as originally designed. But as the Apollo 7 crew practiced rendezvous with the S-IVB/SLA containing a dummy docking target, one panel did not open to the full 45 degrees, raising concern about the possibility of collision between the spacecraft and the SLA panels during docking and extraction of the LM in a lunar mission. Wally Schirra compared it to the &quot;angry alligator&quot; from Gemini 9. This led to a redesign using a spring-loaded hinge release system which released the panels at the 45-degree angle and pushed them away from the S-IVB at a velocity of about , putting them a safe distance away by the time the astronauts pulled the CSM away, rotated it through 180 degrees, and came back for docking.

The LM was connected to the SLA at four points around the lower panels. After the astronauts docked the CSM to the LM, they blew charges to separate those connections and a guillotine severed the LM-to-instrument-unit umbilical. After the charges fired, springs pushed the LM away from the S-IVB, and the astronauts were free to continue their trip to the Moon.

==Launch escape system (LES)==
The Apollo launch escape system (LES) was built by the Lockheed Propulsion Company. Its purpose was to abort the mission by pulling the CM (the crew cabin) away from the launch vehicle in an emergency, such as a pad fire before launch, guidance failure, or launch vehicle failure likely to lead to an imminent explosion.

The LES included three wires that ran down the exterior of the launch vehicle. If the signals from any two of the wires were lost, the LES would activate automatically. Alternatively, the Commander could activate the system manually using one of two translation controller handles, which were switched to a special abort mode for launch. When activated, the LES would fire a solid fuel escape rocket and open a canard system to direct the CM away from, and off the path of, a launch vehicle in trouble. The LES would then jettison and the CM would land with its parachute recovery system.

If the emergency happened on the launch pad, the LES would lift the CM to a sufficient height to allow the recovery parachutes to deploy safely before coming in contact with the ground.

In the absence of an emergency, the LES was routinely jettisoned about 20 or 30 seconds after the launch vehicle&#x27;s second-stage ignition, using a separate solid-fuel rocket motor manufactured by the Thiokol Chemical Company. Abort modes after this point would be accomplished without the LES. The LES was carried but never used on four uncrewed Apollo flights, and fifteen crewed Apollo, Skylab, and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project flights.

===Major components===

;Nose cone and Q-ball: The nose cone of the LES contained an array of 8 pressure-measuring pitot tubes in a structure known as the &quot;Q-ball&quot;. These sensors were connected to the CM and Saturn launch vehicle guidance computers, allowing calculation of dynamic pressure &quot;(q)&quot; during atmospheric flight and also the angle of attack in the event of an abort.
;Q-ball cover: A styrofoam cover, removed a few seconds before launch, protected the pitot tubes from being clogged by debris. The cover was split in half vertically and held together by a rubber band. A razor blade was positioned behind the rubber band, pinched between the halves of the cover. A wire cable was connected to the top and bottom of the razor blade and to both halves of the cover. The cable was routed through a pulley on the hammerhead crane at the top of the launch umbilical tower (LUT) down to a tube on the right side of the level of the LUT. The cable was connected to a cylindrical weight inside a tube. The weight rested on a lever controlled by a pneumatic solenoid valve. When the valve was actuated from the Launch Control Center (LCC), the pneumatic pressure of GN2 (nitrogen gas) rotated the lever down allowing the weight to drop down the tube. The dropping weight pulled the cable, which pulled the blade cutting the rubber band, and the cable pulled the halves of the cover away from the launch vehicle. The apparent overengineering of this safety system was due to the fact that the launch escape system, which depended on the Q-ball data, was armed 5 minutes before launch, so retraction of the Q-ball cover was a life-critical part of a possible pad abort.
;Canard assembly and pitch motor: These worked in combination to direct the CM off a straight path and to the side during an emergency. This would direct the CM off the flight path of an exploding launch vehicle. It would also direct the CM to land off to the side of any launch pad fire and not in the middle of it.
;Launch escape motor: The main solid-fuel rocket motor inside a long tube, with four exhaust nozzles mounted under a conical fairing. This would pull the CM rapidly away from a launch emergency.
;Tower jettison motor: A smaller solid fuel motor with two exhaust nozzles, mounted in the tube, above the escape motor. This jettisoned the entire Launch Escape System after it was no longer needed, sometime after second stage ignition.
;Launch escape tower: A truss framework of tubes that attached the escape motor fairing to the CM.
;Boost protective cover: A hollow conical fiberglass structure protecting the CM&#x27;s parachute compartment and providing a smooth aerodynamic cover over the docking tunnel and probe. After erosion of the pilot&#x27;s windows from the escape motor exhaust was discovered during early LES flight testing, an aft protective cover surrounding the CM&#x27;s entire upper surface was added.

<text>Cap-Santé () is a town in the Canadian province of Quebec. It is the county seat of Portneuf Regional County Municipality and was as well the county seat of the designated Portneuf County.

The name of the town means &quot;Cape Health&quot;. Cap-Santé is on the northern bank of the Saint Lawrence River, west of Quebec City. Legend has it that this community&#x27;s name was coined when soldiers suffering from an unknown disease miraculously recovered from a cure discovered in the village.

The old settlement is situated just west of the nearby Jacques-Cartier River and on the embankment of the Saint Lawrence River.

== History ==

The first settlers arrived around 1679, and in 1714 the village became an official parish.

The present-day church, a historical-registered building, was built from 1754 to 1767. Interrupted during construction by the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763), it is one of the last buildings to be constructed under the French regime. The church has a facade and two towers, a baroque interior, a neoclassical reredos, and two tiers of openings on the bell tower, a presbytery (designed by architect Charles Baillargé in 1849) featuring five neatly lined dormer windows. A cemetery encircles the square, leading to the river below.

The Place de l&#x27;Église square is crowned with old wells dating back to 1799. Vieux Chemin street was built along the same geographical line as that Chemin-du-Roy, the first road linking Montreal and Quebec City in the 18th century. Wooden and stone homes dot the narrow and shaded street that borders the cape. The quay is on the Saint Lawrence River.

In 1759 following the defeat of the French at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham during the Seven Years&#x27; War, the commander of the French forces, Chevalier de Lévis, ordered the construction of Fort Jacques-Cartier at the mouth of the Jacques-Cartier River from materials originally destined for the construction of a church. The following year, using the fort as a logistics base, Lévis attempted unsuccessfully with 7,000 men to recapture Quebec City from the British. The British captured the fort in September 1760 and kept a garrison there until 1763 after which they abandoned it. Virtually nothing remains of the fort aside from archaeological remains, which is also situated on private land inaccessible to the public on the &#x27;Plateau Jacques-Cartier&#x27; district of the municipality. Close by, is the Allsopp House (late 18th century), an old seigneurial manor named after the Allsopp family, now a private property registered as a historical building.

The founder of the Congregation of the Sisters of Bon Pasteur, Marie Fitzbach, lived in Cap-Santé from 1826–1840. Gérard Morisset, architect and art historian, was also a resident, and designed the interiors of many of the region&#x27;s churches.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Cap-Santé had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<text>Gabriella Brum (born 1962) is a German-British former model and beauty queen who won the 1980 Miss World and resigned 18 hours later, initially claiming her boyfriend disapproved. She stated that this was because of the pressure from the news media, though there were also allegations that she had posed nude in a magazine. The first runner-up in the pageant, Kimberley Santos from Guam, then assumed the title.

==Biography==
Brum&#x27;s mother, Angelika Roure, had met soldier, Edward Brum from London in 1961, but separated from him after a few years. The daughter, Gabriella Brum attended the Lessing High School in Berlin from 1976 to 1980, but left school in favor of a desired film career. She worked under various pseudonyms and met acting director, cameraman and producer Wolfgang Benno Bellenbaum (1928-1984), with whom she went to Los Angeles where she worked as a model.

===Miss Germany (1980)===
On 26 June 1980, Brum was crowned Miss Germany at the International Congress Center (ICC) in Berlin. A Time article from July 1980 shows that her election to Miss Germany met with criticism. So it was complained that Brum no longer lived in Germany as the main residence.

===Miss World (1980)===
On 13 November 1980, Brum won the Miss World pageant in London, making her the second German to win the title, after Petra Schürmann. The runner-up was Kimberley Santos from Guam. The following day, Brum resigned on the grounds that her boyfriend disagreed with her new obligations and she &quot;wanted to be with Benno instead of flying through the world under a strict contract for a year&quot;. Later, it was revealed she had been forced to resign because of allegations that there were nude photos of her. In a 2008 interview with &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, photographer Wolfgang Heilemann said he had taken the photos of Brum naked in bed having a pillow fight with her boyfriend, as part of a Miss World cover story for Paris Match.

===Living in the United States===
In the early years, Brum was a successful model in the United States. She appeared in Playboy 5/1981.

In 1981, she married Wolfgang Benno Bellenbaum; they soon separated. Her husband shot himself at the age of 55 in his apartment in Encino, a district of Los Angeles, and his body was identified by Brum. A farewell letter was found.

An article on the January 2012 United States Online News (USSPost) indicated that she was still based in Los Angeles at the time.

<text>Alexandra Rebecca Parks (born 26 July 1984) is a retired English singer-songwriter. In 2003 Parks won the second series of the BBC Television programme &quot;Fame Academy&quot; immediately followed by the release of her first album entitled &quot;Introduction&quot;, which went double platinum in the United Kingdom and gold in several other European countries. In 2005 she released her second album, &quot;Honesty&quot;, but was subsequently dropped by her record label in February 2006.

Parks has been inactive in music since 2006.

==Biography==
Alex Parks was born in July 1984 and was raised in the village of Mount Hawke, Cornwall. She is the youngest of four siblings. Parks attended college at The Hub in St Austell.

Parks began fronting a local band, &quot;One Trick Pony&quot;, which performed mostly cover songs by artists such as Joni Mitchell, Ani Di Franco and Michelle Branch. For two years they played in bars around Cornwall, but the momentum of the band gradually ran down, leaving Parks in her bedroom with a four-track tape machine and a bunch of her songs-in-progress.

Parks initially planned to move to Amsterdam to learn the art of clowning, but her career path changed when her father submitted an application for the second season of the BBC Television series, &quot;Fame Academy&quot;.

Parks is gay and before entering Fame Academy had a long-term girlfriend from Newquay.
==Fame Academy==
Having been prompted by her father to take part in auditions for the show, which threw her in amongst 12,000 hopefuls, the 18-year-old Alex found herself the youngest student chosen for the two-month stay at Witanhurst House in north London.

The final showdown between Parks and Alistair Griffin was screened live and generated so many angry messages from viewers after Daniel Bedingfield who duetted with both finalists, made his feelings clear by urging viewers that they should &quot;just vote for Alex&quot;. This outburst by Bedingfield led to claims of favouritism. The BBC was forced to close down the Points of View message boards as negative messages flooded the board. Bedingfield made a public apology to Griffin for his behaviour and outburst. The actual voting figures have never been publicly released. Parks went on to win the show.

===Recording career===
Her song &quot;Maybe That&#x27;s What It Takes&quot; was released on 17 November 2003 and peaked at number 3 in the UK Singles Chart the following week. Her debut album &quot;Introduction&quot; was subsequently released and sold over 500,000 copies. She expressed an interest in a recording career.

&quot;Honesty&quot; was eventually released in October 2005, preceded by the lead single, &quot;Looking For Water&quot;, in October 2005. The album peaked at No. 24 in the UK Albums Chart.

After being dropped by her label, Polydor, Parks wrote a statement to her fans on her official website stating that she had almost no support from the media and that she was disappointed in how things had turned out. She was not sure whether she was not promoted well enough because they did not like her music, her personally or the fact she had become famous via a reality TV programme.

<doc id="497935" wikidata="Q47541" url="?curid=497935" title="Serenity Prayer">
<text>The Serenity Prayer is an invocation by the petitioner for wisdom to understand the difference between circumstances (&quot;things&quot;) that can and cannot be changed, asking courage to take action in the case of the former, and serenity to accept in the case of the latter. 

The prayer has achieved very wide distribution, spreading through the YWCA and other groups in the 1930s, and in Alcoholics Anonymous and related organizational materials since at least 1941. Since at least the early 1960s, commercial enterprises such as Hallmark Cards have used the prayer in its greeting cards and gift items. The prayer has also made its way into popular culture, including in works by Bill Watterson, Nikolaj Velimirović, Neil Young, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Bryan Lee O&#x27;Malley and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, and films and television series including &quot;True Detective&quot; and &quot;The Colors Within&quot;.

==History==
A version of the prayer was originally composed by Protestant theologian Reinhold Niebuhr in the early 1930s. Initially popularized by one of his colleagues, the prayer began to spread widely without reference to the original author. 

Around 1932, Niebuhr is reported to have first used the prayer as the last part of a longer prayer. In an October 31, 1932 diary entry by American YWCA official Winnifred Wygal, she quotes her colleague Niebuhr:The victorious man in the day of crisis is the man who has the serenity to accept what he cannot help and the courage to change what must be altered.Drawing on this, Wygal published a prayer in the March 1933 edition of YWCA periodical &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Press&quot;, which was soon shared with a broader audience on the front page of the &quot;Santa Cruz Sentinel&quot; of March 15, 1933.

It read:Oh, God, give us courage to change what must be altered, serenity to accept what can not be helped, and insight to know the one from the other.The prayer was also quoted in the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; later that month. Substantial quotes from the prayer were also printed in two Atlanta newspapers that month. 

The prayer appeared a few additional times in American and Canadian newspapers in the 1930s, associated with the YWCA or with individual women. In 1937, the prayer was published in a Christian student newsletter, attributing it to Niebuhr.

Wygal published the prayer again in her 1940 book &quot;We Plan Our Own Worship Services&quot;, and attributed it to Niebuhr. It took this form:O God, give us the serenity to accept what cannot be changed, the courage to change what can be changed, and the wisdom to know the one from the other.The prayer became published in English language newspapers much more from 1940, but never attributed to Wygal or Niebuhr.
In June 1941, the prayer was published in an obituary in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, and from here became known by the first Alcoholics Anonymous group. The organisation embraced it and spread it widely. It was initially known within the group as &quot;The AA prayer&quot;, but by the late 1940s, was known as &quot;the serenity prayer.&quot;

Niebuhr presented it in a 1943 sermon at Heath Evangelical Union Church in Heath, Massachusetts. Niebuhr&#x27;s wife and daughter would later say this was when they understood the prayer was first written and used. It then also appeared in a sermon of Niebuhr&#x27;s in the 1944 &quot;A&quot; &quot;Book of Prayers and Services for the Armed Forces,&quot; and was printed on cards for American soldiers in WWII. From January 1944, Niebuhr began being cited as the source of the prayer in newspaper articles.

Niebuhr also published it in a magazine column in 1951. By this stage, the prayer had become commonly quoted as:
God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.
In 1962, Hallmark began using the prayer in its graduation cards, crediting Niebuhr, and in the 1970s they also produced a wall plaque. Posters and household ornaments were produced by others without attribution.

Rhetorician William FitzGerald believes Wygal wrote the prayer, arguing sexism as the reason for misattribution. Quotation researcher Fred Shapiro has alternated in his conclusions over time. In 2021&#x27;s &quot;The New Yale Book of Quotations,&quot; and in his discussion of it, says Wygal &quot;was the author of the earliest known occurrence&quot;.

==Versions==
The prayer has appeared in many versions. Reinhold Niebuhr&#x27;s versions of the prayer were always printed as a single prose sentence; printings that set out the prayer as three lines of verse modify the author&#x27;s original version. The best-known form is a late version, as it includes a reference to grace not found before 1951:

&lt;poem&gt;
God, give me grace to accept with serenity
the things that cannot be changed,
Courage to change the things
which should be changed,
and the Wisdom to distinguish
the one from the other.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The following clauses were added in the AA &quot;Origin of the Serenity Prayer: A Historic Paper&quot; but were not part of the tripartite original. Niebuhr&#x27;s daughter in her book &quot;The Serenity Prayer: Faith and Politics in Time of Peace and War&quot; said: &quot;... their message and their tone are not in any way Niebuhrian.&quot;

&lt;poem&gt;
Living one day at a time,
Enjoying one moment at a time,
Accepting hardship as a pathway to peace,
Taking, as He did,
This sinful world as it is,
Not as I would have it,
Trusting that He will make all things right,
If I surrender to His will,
That I may be reasonably happy in this life,
And supremely happy with Him forever in the next.

Amen.
&lt;/poem&gt;

A version, apparently quoted from memory and asking for the author of the quotation, appeared in the &quot;Queries and Answers&quot; column in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; in July 1950, and received a reply in the same column in August 1950, attributing the prayer to Niebuhr, and quoting it as follows:
&lt;poem&gt;O God and Heavenly Father,
Grant to us the serenity of mind to accept that which cannot be changed; courage to change that which can be changed, and wisdom to know the one from the other, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.&lt;/poem&gt;

Today, twelve-step recovery programs generally use a slightly different version, the text of which has been adopted in official publications from groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous:
&lt;poem&gt;God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to change the things I can,
and Wisdom to know the difference.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Precursors===
1st-century Greek stoic philosopher Epictetus wrote:&lt;poem&gt;Make the best use of what is in your power, and take the rest as it happens. Some things are up to us [eph&#x27; hêmin] and some things are not up to us. Our opinions are up to us, and our impulses, desires, aversions—in short, whatever is our own doing. Our bodies are not up to us, nor are our possessions, our reputations, or our public offices, or, that is, whatever is not our own doing.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

The 8th-century Indian Buddhist scholar Shantideva of the ancient Nalanda Mahavihara suggested:
&lt;poem&gt;If there&#x27;s a remedy when trouble strikes,
What reason is there for dejection?
And if there is no help for it,
What use is there in being glum?&lt;/poem&gt;

The 11th-century Jewish philosopher Solomon ibn Gabirol wrote:
And they said: At the head of all understanding – is distinguishing between what is and what cannot be, and the consoling of what is not in our power to change.

A Mother Goose rhyme (dating back to at least 1827) has been juxtaposed with Niebuhr&#x27;s prayer by philosopher W. W. Bartley:
&lt;poem&gt;For every ailment under the sun
There is a remedy, or there is none;
If there be one, try to find it;
If there be none, never mind it.&lt;/poem&gt;

In 1801, German philosopher Friedrich Schiller wrote:&lt;poem&gt;Blessed is he, who has learned to bear what he cannot change, and to give up with dignity, what he cannot save.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;
===Spurious attributions===
The prayer has been variously attributed (without evidence) to Thomas Aquinas, Cicero, Augustine, Boethius, Marcus Aurelius, and Francis of Assisi, among others.

Theodor Wilhelm, a professor of education at the University of Kiel, published a German version of the prayer under the pseudonym &quot;Friedrich Oetinger&quot; in 1951. Wilhelm&#x27;s version of the prayer became popular in West Germany, where it was widely but falsely attributed to the 18th-century philosopher Friedrich Christoph Oetinger. Elisabeth Sifton described Wilhelm&#x27;s account of the history of the prayer as &quot;dishonest&quot;.

==Use by twelve-step recovery programs==
The prayer became more widely known after being brought to the attention of Alcoholics Anonymous in 1941 by an early member, who came upon it in a caption in a &quot;routine &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; obituary&quot;. The original clipping appeared in the May 28, 1941, public notices section: &quot;Mother--God grant me the serenity to accept things I cannot change, courage to change things I can, and wisdom to know the difference. Goodby.&quot; AA&#x27;s co-founder Bill W. and the staff liked the prayer and had it printed in modified form and handed around. It has been part of Alcoholics Anonymous ever since, and has also been used in other twelve-step programs. &quot;Never had we seen so much A.A. in so few words,&quot; noted Bill W. The January 1950 edition of the &quot;Grapevine&quot; (&quot;The International Journal of Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;) identifies Niebuhr as the author, as does the AA web site.

<text>Von Steuben Day is a holiday traditionally held on a weekend in mid-September (von Steuben was born September 17), celebrating the Prussian-born Baron Friedrich von Steuben, who arrived in the United States as a volunteer offering his services to General George Washington in the American Revolutionary War. Von Steuben is still regarded as one of the most important German Americans, as his training of the young American troops made victory against the British possible. Thus, his work helped gain independence for the United States of America. The day is generally considered the German-American event of the year, and many participants wear tracht costumes, including dirndls and lederhosen, to celebrate their heritage. Celebrations focus on parades where participants march, dance, and play music.

The German-American Steuben Parade is an annual parade traditionally held in cities across the United States on Von Steuben Day.

The New York City parade is held every third Saturday in September. It was founded in 1957 by immigrants from Germany who, part of the most significant self-reported immigrant ancestral group in the United States, wanted to keep the traditions of their German homeland alive.

The Philadelphia parade, founded in 1970, is usually held every fourth Saturday in September.

The Chicago parade was featured in the 1986 film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;.

Many parades were canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===New York===
While Steuben Day is celebrated in many cities all across the United States, the largest crowds gather in New York City. Every year on the third Saturday in September, German-Americans celebrate the Annual Steuben Parade on Fifth Avenue and an Oktoberfest-style beer fest complete with food and live music in Central Park. The parade was founded in 1957 and has grown into one of the largest celebrations of German and German-American culture in the United States. In 2007, German-Americans celebrated the 50th anniversary of this affair and welcomed former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger as Grand Marshal and former German chancellor Helmut Kohl as Guest of Honor. In 2017, the parade celebrated its 60th anniversary with Grand Marshals Admiral Nielson from the German Navy along with longtime Parade Volunteer and German-American Community Leader Heinz Buck. But three years later, the parade was canceled on the grounds of COVID-19 pandemic and was deferred to 2021.

The first Steuben Parade was held in the German neighborhood of Ridgewood Queens. In 1958, the parade moved to Yorkville, known then as Germantown, and lined up on 86th Street. Over the years, as the event grew more extensive, it drew an ever-larger number of spectators. Soon, it gained the city&#x27;s recognition and marched up Fifth Avenue, turning onto 86th St, and marching across to First Avenue to cheering crowds.
86th Street was once the heart of Little Germany and was affectionately called the &quot;German Boulevard.&quot; It hosted many German shops, Konditereis, Biergartens, Vereins, theaters, restaurants, newspapers, and dance halls.

Today, the parade still marches up Fifth Avenue but now ends only at Fifth Avenue and 86th Street. It is led by cadets representing the German Language Club of the Military Academy of West Point, which General von Steuben founded. The three-hour parade is dominated by traditional German groups, spectacular colorful floats, marching bands, clubs, and organizations from Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, as well as the US and Canada, wearing their traditional German costumes. The parade honors one or more Grand Marshals, either American citizens with a German background or German citizens with a special relationship to America.
Every year, the German-American Steuben Parade is led by cadets representing the German Language Club of the Military Academy of West Point, which General von Steuben founded. However, it is not a parade in the military tradition. The rest of the about three-hour-long parade is dominated by traditional German brass music groups and marching bands, by clubs and organizations wearing traditional German Tracht, as well as by carnival groups, sharpshooters, or representatives of other traditions. For many years, the parade has had a solid Bavarian theme, dominated by men wearing lederhosen, women in dirndl, and groups dancing the traditional Schuhplattler. Recently, though, the parade opened up to represent more German themes.

====Grand Marshal and Guest of Honor====
Every year, the German-American Steuben Parade is led by one or more Grand Marshals, either American citizens with a German background or German citizens with a special relationship with America.

The Grand Marshals in 2009 were Congressman Michael McMahon, Fox 5 TV reporter Linda Schmidt, A&amp;P Chairman Christian Haub, and Parade Co-founder Ted Dengler. In previous years, Grand Marshals included Hollywood star Ralf Möller, NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer and Col. Gail Halvorsen, the &quot;Candy-Bomber&quot; from the 1948–49 Berlin Airlift.

In 2007, celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the German-American Steuben Parade, the Grand Marshal was former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, born in the Franconia region of Bavaria in Germany. The Guest of Honor was Dr. Klaus Scharioth, the German Ambassador to the United States. Also invited was former German chancellor Helmut Kohl, known to have a deep personal friendship with America.

Over the years, many distinguished Germans and Americans have led the Steuben Parade. Former Grand Marshals include Donald Trump, Siegfried &amp; Roy, George Steinbrenner, Carol Alt, Michael Bloomberg, Eric Braeden, John Roland, Louis Freeh, Norbert Schramm. Several Mayors of New York City of non-German background have also led the parade, including Rudolph Giuliani and George Pataki.

Among the Guests of Honor have been three German presidents: Walter Scheel, Richard von Weizsäcker and Johannes Rau, as well as other dignitaries from the political and economic fields, including state prime ministers Erwin Teufel, Kurt Biedenkopf and Bernhard Vogel.

====Parade events====
While the German-American Steuben Parade is held on the third Saturday in September, starting at noon, other weekend festivities exist. Usually, up to 35 music and costume groups from overseas are greeted at City Hall Park on the Friday preceding the parade. On the eve of the parade, a gala benefit banquet takes place as a fundraiser for the parade.

The parade leads to the German-American Friendship Party in Central Park. This is the most significant beer fest in New York, featuring many German brands on tap, as well as traditional German food such as bratwurst.

====Miss German-America====
Each May, the German-American Steuben Parade Committee crowns a Miss German-America, who serves as Queen of the Steuben Day Parade in September. She is selected based on her German-American heritage and knowledge of German culture. She is expected to promote the parade, its events, and numerous German festivals throughout the New York region each summer. Past winners include: Nicole Radske (2006), Christina Rom (2007), Melissa Gratzl (2008), Virginia Kovak (2009), Stephanie Russell-Kraft (2010), Denise Manukian (2011), Kirsten Mueller (2012), Kristina Kren (2013) Stefanie Kraker (2014) and Samantha Hart (2015).

====Logo====
The cornflower is the official flower and the logo of the German-American Steuben Parade of New York City, as it widely grows in both Germany and the United States. Also, the color blue symbolizes friendship and hope. In addition, the Cornflower was the national Flower of Prussia since its introduction by Kaiser Wilhelm I to honor his mother Queen Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and because of its color (prussian blue).

====Organization====
The German-American Steuben Parade Committee organizes the parade and all related events. Since 2014, the committee has been led by General Chairman Bob Radske. The two Vice Chairwomen are Nicole Miskiewicz and Melissa Alke-Sparnroft. The committee membership consists of representatives of many German-American organizations from the New York metropolitan area, some involved in founding the parade in 1957. The Steuben Parade is overseen by the German-American Committee of Greater New York, a not-for-profit organization registered in New York with 501(c)3 status.

===Philadelphia===
To celebrate the accomplishments of Baron von Steuben, the Philadelphia Von Steuben Day Parade is 50 miles from Valley Forge, where Steuben trained the Revolutionary Army. Philadelphia is where the Continental Congress met to sign the Declaration of Independence. It was also home to Benjamin Franklin, sent to France by the Continental Congress. It was during this trip that Franklin was introduced to von Steuben.

In addition, in 1683, William Penn invited the thirteen German families from Krefeld to join his &quot;Grand Experiment&quot;. They eventually settled and founded Germantown, now a section of Philadelphia. In 1983, a parade celebrated the 300th anniversary of the founding of Germantown. At that time, a group from Krefeld brought the Tri-Centennial Bike, a thirteen-seat bicycle that has become a feature of our annual parade.

====Parade events====
While the German–American Steuben Parade is held on the fourth Saturday in September, starting at noon, other weekend festivities exist. On the eve of the parade, a gala benefit banquet is held at the Cannstatter Volksfest Verein.

On Parade day itself, the day begins with an Ecumenical Service at 10:00 am. After the parade, participants are welcome to join the Oktoberfest held by the Bavarian Volksfest Verein on the grounds of the United German-Hungarian Club.

====Organization====
The Steuben Day Observance Association of Philadelphia and Vicinity organize the parade and all related events. The association is led by General Chairman Thomas Markow and two Vice Chairmen, Werner Fricker and James Schwartz. The association&#x27;s membership consists of representatives of many German-American organizations from the Philadelphia metropolitan area. The Steuben Day Observance Association of Philadelphia and Vicinity is a not-for-profit organization registered in Pennsylvania with 501(c)3 status.

== Von Steuben Day in pop culture ==
The Chicago parade was in the 1986 John Hughes movie &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, even though other movie details indicate that the film takes place near the end of the school year, not in September or on a Saturday.

&quot;Drunk History&quot;, season 2 episode 8 &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, as retold by Nick Rutherford features David Cross as Baron von Steuben.

<doc id="497941" wikidata="Q194526" url="?curid=497941" title="Tiger quoll">
<text>The tiger quoll (Dasyurus maculatus), also known as the spotted-tailed quoll, spotted quoll, spotted-tailed dasyure, or tiger cat, is a carnivorous marsupial of the quoll genus &quot;Dasyurus&quot; native to Australia. With males and females weighing around , respectively, it is the world&#x27;s second-largest extant carnivorous marsupial, behind the Tasmanian devil. Two subspecies are recognised; the nominate is found in wet forests of southeastern Australia and Tasmania, and a northern subspecies, &quot;D. m. gracilis&quot;, is found in a small area of northern Queensland and is endangered.

The tiger quoll commonly preys on small mammals, insects, birds, domestic poultry and large marsupials such as wombats. It mostly hunts live prey but occasionally scavenges when the opportunity arises. The tiger quoll kills its prey by executing a killing bite to the base of the skull or top of the neck, depending on the size of the prey. The species is listed as near-threatened on the IUCN Red List, and is primarily threatened by habitat loss caused by human activities.

== Taxonomy ==
The tiger quoll is a member of the family Dasyuridae, which includes most carnivorous marsupial mammals. This quoll was first described in 1792 by Robert Kerr, the Scottish writer and naturalist, who placed it in the genus &quot;Didelphis&quot;, which includes several species of American opossum. The species name, &quot;maculatus&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;spotted&quot;, which refers to the animal&#x27;s mottled fur pattern.

The tribe Dasyurini, to which quolls belong, also includes the Tasmanian devil, the antechinus, the kowari, and the mulgara. Genetic analysis of cytochrome b DNA and 12S rRNA of the mitochondria indicates that quolls evolved and diversified in the late Miocene between 15 and 5 million years ago, a time of great diversification in marsupials. The ancestors of all current species had diverged by the early Pliocene, around 4 million years ago.

Two subspecies are recognised:
*&quot;D. m. maculatus&quot;, found from southern Queensland south to Tasmania
*&quot;D. m. gracilis&quot;, found in an isolated population in northeastern Queensland

The following is a phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial genome sequences:
==Description==
The tiger quoll is the largest of the quolls. Adult females of the northern subspecies are generally smaller and weigh 1.5 times less than their male counterparts. Males and females of &quot;D. m. maculatus&quot; weigh on average , respectively, and males and females of &quot;D. m. gracilis&quot; weigh on average , respectively. The biggest male individuals may weigh , while the largest females can tip in at over . The tiger quoll has relatively short legs, but its tail is as long as its body and head combined. It has a thick head and neck and a slightly rounded and elongated snout. 

It has five toes on each foot, both front and hind, and the hind feet have well-developed halluces. Its long pink foot pads are ridged, an adaptation for its arboreal lifestyle. This makes up for the fact that its tail is not prehensile. The tiger quoll usually has a reddish-brown pelage (a minority have black fur) with white spots, and colourations do not change seasonally. It is the only quoll species with spots on its tail in addition to its body. Its fur and skin are covered in orange-brown-coloured oil. The underside is typically greyish or creamy white. 

The average length of &quot;D. m. maculatus&quot; is for males and for females. For &quot;D. m. gracilis&quot;, males have an average length of , while females average in length. The tail is on average long in both subspecies. The tiger quoll has the second-most powerful bite relative to body size of any living mammalian carnivore, exerting a force of .

==Range and ecology==
The tiger quoll is found in eastern Australia where more than of rain falls per year. Most sightings occur in elevations of at least . Historically, the quoll was present throughout southeastern Queensland, through eastern New South Wales, Victoria, southeastern South Australia, and Tasmania. European settlement has severely impacted and fragmented the quoll&#x27;s mainland distribution. Tiger quolls are rare in southeastern Queensland and mainly restricted to national parks. In Victoria, quoll populations have declined by nearly 50%. The range decline was not as severe in New South Wales, but they are still rare. The quoll was probably never very numerous in South Australia, but although considered locally extinct for 130 years, one was captured in the state&#x27;s south-east in 2023. In Tasmania, the tiger quoll frequents the northern and western areas where rains are seasonal. Tiger quolls were once native to Flinders Island and King Island, but were extirpated since the 20th century, so are not present on Tasmanian offshore islands.

Tiger quolls live in a variety of habitats, but seem to prefer wet forests such as rainforests and closed eucalypt forest. They are arboreal, but only moderately, as 11% of their travelling is done above ground. When they do take to the trees, they may hunt arboreal prey such as possum, leaping between trees if need be. When descending, they usually go head first.

Prey items eaten by quolls include insects, crayfish, lizards, snakes, birds, domestic poultry, small mammals, platypus, rabbits, arboreal possums, cuscuses, greater gliders, bandicoots, pademelons, small wallabies, and wombats. They may scavenge larger animals such as kangaroos, feral pigs, cattle, and dingoes. However, the tiger quoll does not scavenge as much as the Tasmanian devil. In one study, feral rabbits made up 76% of the diet on the mainland. They can climb high into trees and make nocturnal hunts for possums and birds. The flexibility of their diets suggests their prey base is not detrimentally affected by bushfires. When hunting, a quoll stalks its prey, stopping only when its head is up. It then launches its attack, executing a killing bite to the base of the skull or top of the neck, depending on the size of the prey. The quoll will pin small prey down with its forepaws and then deliver the bite. With large prey, it jumps and latches on its back and bites the neck.

Quolls, in turn, may be preyed on by Tasmanian devils and masked owls in Tasmania and dingos and dogs in mainland Australia. It may also be preyed on by wedge-tailed eagles and large pythons. Tiger quolls yield to adult devils, but will chase subadults away from carcasses. Quolls also probably compete with introduced carnivores, such as foxes, cats, and feral dogs. Tiger quolls are also hosts to numerous species of endoparasites.

==Life history==

Tiger quolls are generally nocturnal, and rest during the day in dens. However, juveniles and females with young in the den can be seen during the day and may leave their dens when it is light out. Quoll dens take the form of burrows, caves, rock crevices, tree hollows, hollow logs, or under houses or sheds. Quolls move by walking and bounding gaits. Trails are not particularly important for quoll, although they forage and scent mark along runways and roads. Tiger quolls may live in home ranges that range from for males and for females. Most resident quolls are female, although one population study found both males and females were split between transients and residents. Males have overlapping home ranges, but each has its own core area of at least . The home ranges of females may overlap less. Tiger quolls have been recorded traveling per day in search of food and other resources. Quolls sometimes share dens during the breeding season. After copulation, females act aggressively towards males, especially when close to parturition. For the tiger quoll, olfactory and auditory signals are used more often than visual signals when communicating. Quolls greet each other with nose-to-nose sniffs, and males will sniff the backsides of females to check for estrus. Quolls also mark themselves with mouth and ear secretions. Some populations have communal latrines, while others do not. Rocky creek beds, cliff bases, and roads serve as locations for latrines.

Adult quolls are rarely vocal outside of social interactions. Antagonistic or disturbed vocalisations are guttural huffs, coughs, hisses, and piercing screams. &quot;Cp-cp-cp&quot; sounds are produced by females in estrus. Females communicate with their young with &quot;chh-chh&quot; and &quot;echh-echh&quot; calls. The former are made by females and the latter are made by young. When conflict erupts among juveniles, a range of vocalisations are continuously emitted, and when clambering over their mother, she&#x27;ll emit a &quot;hiss&quot;. During antagonistic encounters, quolls also threaten each other with open mouths and teeth displays. At this time, the ears are laid back and the eyes are narrowed. Males grasp and bite each other in combat.

Tiger quolls reproduce seasonally. They mate in midwinter (June/July), but females can breed as early as April. Males are not involved in parenting, with females bearing full responsibility. The mating behaviour of the tiger quoll is unique among the quoll species in that the female vocalises when in estrus and easily accepts the male&#x27;s mounting. In addition, the female&#x27;s neck swells up. Mating involves the male holding on the female&#x27;s sides with his paws and holding on the neck with his mouth. Polyestrous, females are in heat for an average of 3 to 5 days within a 28-day cycle. Copulation can last as long as 24 hours. Succeeding a 3-week gestation period, females give birth with their hindquarters raised and their tails curled. Around 2 to 6 young are born, starting life at only 7 mm, and increasing in size by more than 5 times during their first month. For the time the young is in the pouch, a female rests on her sides. After the young has left the pouch, females stay in nests they have built. For their first 50–60 days of life, the young cannot see, so they rely on vocalisations and touch to find their mother or siblings. It stops when their eyes open after 70 days. Young are not carried on the back, but they do rest on their mother and cling to her when frightened. By 100 days the young become more independent of their mothers, and the mothers more aggressive towards their young. Males reach physical maturity at the age of three, and females at two. Both sexes attain sexual maturity at the about same age; one year. They do not usually last more than around three years in the wild.

==Conservation status==
The tiger quoll is listed by the IUCN on the Red List of Threatened Species with the status &quot;near threatened&quot;. , since its listing in 2004 under the EPBC Act, the Tasmanian population of &quot;Dasyurus maculatus maculatus&quot; is regarded as a vulnerable species, while the Queensland population of &quot;Dasyurus maculatus gracilis&quot; has been listed as endangered since July 2000. An estimated 14,000 mature tiger quolls are left in the world, as of 2018.

This species is vulnerable to decline because it requires certain climates and habitats, it tends to live in low densities, it is likely to compete with introduced predators (mainly foxes and feral cats) and requires much space, and it does not live very long. The biggest threat to the quoll is habitat destruction. Humans may directly contribute to quoll deaths through exploitation, motor collisions, and 1080 poisoning. An outbreak of disease in the 1900s is cited as another factor. Additionally, in south-east Queensland, the quoll&#x27;s habitat has been reduced to 30% of what it was in previous decades. Exposure to introduced species, cleared forest, and farms may lead to high mortality rates. 

Conservationists are using population monitoring and public education to preserve the species and intend to preserve their habitat and minimise the impacts of 1080 baiting. Wildlife corridors are being built to ensure the survival of the species, along with the management of introduced canids and felids.

<doc id="497949" wikidata="Q1053695" url="?curid=497949" title="Shimōsa Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area of modern Chiba Prefecture and Ibaraki Prefecture as well as the bordering parts of Saitama Prefecture and Tokyo (the parts that used to be located east of the lower reaches of the old Tone River prior to the river&#x27;s eastward diversion, &quot;i.e.&quot; the parts of the former Katsushika District of Shimōsa that have been transferred to North Katsushika District of Saitama Prefecture and Sumida, Kōtō, Edogawa, and Katsushika wards of Tokyo). It lies to the north of the Bōsō Peninsula (房総半島), whose name takes its first &quot;kanji&quot; from the name of Awa Province and its second from Kazusa and Shimōsa Provinces. Its abbreviated form name was or .

Shimōsa is classified as one of the provinces of the Tōkaidō. It was bordered by Kazusa Province to the south, Musashi and Kōzuke Provinces to the west, and Hitachi and Shimotsuke Provinces to the north. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Shimōsa was ranked as a &quot;great country&quot; (大国) and a far country (遠国).

==History==
Shimōsa was originally part of a larger territory known as , which was divided into &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; portions (i.e. Kazusa and Shimōsa) during the reign of Emperor Kōtoku (645–654). It was well-known to the Imperial Court in Nara period Japan for its fertile lands, and is mentioned in Nara period records as having supplied hemp to the Court. Shimōsa was divided into 11 (later 12) counties. The exact location of the capital of Shimōsa is not precisely known, but is believed to have been somewhere within the borders of the modern city of Ichikawa, Chiba, near Station where the ruins of the &quot;Kokubun-ji&quot; have been located. However, the &quot;Ichinomiya&quot; of Shimōsa Province is the Katori Jingū in what is now the city of Katori, Chiba, on the opposite coast of the province.

During the Heian period, the province was divided into numerous &quot;shōen&quot; controlled by local samurai clans, primarily the Chiba clan, which sided with Minamoto no Yoritomo in the Genpei War. During the Kamakura period, much of the province was under the control of the Chiba clan. By the early Muromachi period, the area was a highly contested region highly fragmented by various samurai clans. By the Sengoku period, the Later Hōjō clan held sway following the Battle of Kōnodai (1538) against the Ashikaga clan and the Satomi clan.

Following the installation of Tokugawa Ieyasu in Edo, after the Battle of Odawara, he created eleven han within the borders of Shimōsa to reward his followers, with the remaining area retained as &quot;tenryō&quot; territory owned directly by the &quot;shōgun&quot; and administered by various &quot;hatamoto&quot;. The entire province had an assessed revenue of 681,062 &quot;koku&quot;.
Following the Meiji Restoration, these various domains and &quot;tenryō&quot; territories were transformed into short-lived prefectures in July 1871 by the abolition of the han system. Most of Shimōsa Province became part of the new Chiba Prefecture on June 15, 1873, with four districts (Yūki, Toyoda, Sashima, Okada) going to the new Ibaraki Prefecture and the portion to the west of the Edogawa River going to the new Saitama Prefecture.

==Historical districts==

The area of former Shimōsa Province was organized into twelve districts by the Meiji cadastral reforms: Chiba, Inba, Katori, Kaijō, Shimohabu. Sōsa, Okada, Sashima, Toyoda, Yūki, Sōma and Katsushika.

<doc id="497951" wikidata="Q6540866" url="?curid=497951" title="Liberalism and conservatism in Latin America">
<text>Liberalism and conservatism in Latin America have unique historical roots as Latin American independence began to occur in 1808 after the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic Wars that eventually engulfed all of Europe. French revolutionaries in the 1790s began an intellectual awakening called the Enlightenment, which opened the door for ideas of positivism in Latin American society and people in Latin America turned to liberal ideologies as liberalism means the idea of liberty, equality and popular sovereignty.

During the early 19th century in Latin America, liberalism clashed with conservative views as liberals wanted to end the dominance of the Catholic Church, class stratification and slavery. These issues for many years strongly affected the way that Latin American society was organized. The majority of liberals believed in a democratic system of government, but this system would create many changes and much confusion in Latin American communities in the early 19th century. On the other hand, conservatism favored existing systems and hierarchies. Conservatives believed chaos and social disorder would break out if the political system were liberalized. Latin American conservatives generally believed in class stratification and opposed radical change in government in Latin America.

Simón Bolívar, a key leader in the early independence movements in the 19th century, pushed for a centralized government that spanned the entire Northern Andes and a united Latin America. Military and political leaders opposed him strongly, and accused him of seeking dictatorship. This fear of central power came from the regional divisions in Latin American politics.The contest between liberals and conservatives in Latin America, while sweeping in effect, was largely fought between members of the landed, white or creole elite. Creoles were the children of immigrated European families. Systems in place from the colonial period—such as slavery, patronage by the elite and debt peonage—meant that the great mass of Indians, Africans and people of mixed race had little, if any power compared to the very small creole ruling class. Although Indians, Africans, and people of mixed race had little power compared to that of the Creoles and white elites, they were still victims of conflict and violence caused by the conflicting ideologies of liberalism and conservativism. These individuals would often find themselves more vulnerable to labor extractions, liberal reformism, and mercantile violence than creole elites. Thus the concern that liberalization would lead to &quot;disorder&quot; that the conservatives spoke about is considered by some historians as a veiled or transparent fear of race war.

&quot;Caudillos&quot; soon came to power in some Latin American societies, such as Mexico. &quot;Caudillos&quot; were people of either progressive or conservative thought, who promised protection and restoration of traditional ways to the people. They were generally pragmatic, believing in a ruling system of what works best. &quot;Caudillos&quot; used military force to hold society together.One of the most prominent figures was General Antonio López de Santa Anna, a conservative caudillo in Mexico who represented the unstable politics of early post-independence in Latin America. Santa Anna went back and forth between holding power and being exiled, serving as president of Mexico eleven times and playing key roles in both military successes, such as defeating a French invasion in 1838, and losses, including the loss of Texas in 1836. In contrast, figures like the Argentine liberal Domingo Faustino Sarmiento strongly criticized the caudillo system, arguing that the dominance of military leaders in Argentina created a threat to democracy.
Since the 1980s, there have been several neo-liberal economic reforms across Latin America, in order to support expansive industrialization.

<doc id="497953" wikidata="Q1146715" url="?curid=497953" title="I-400-class submarine">
<text>The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) submarines were the largest submarines of World War II, with the final completed submarine being finished roughly a month before the end of the war. The &quot;I-400s&quot; remained the largest submarines ever built until the construction of nuclear ballistic missile submarines in the 1960s. The IJN called this type of submarine , shortened from . They were submarine aircraft carriers able to carry three Aichi M6A &quot;Seiran&quot; aircraft underwater to their destinations. They were designed to surface, launch their planes, then quickly dive again before they were discovered. They also carried torpedoes for close-range combat.

The &quot;I-400&quot; class was designed with the range to travel anywhere in the world and return. A fleet of 18 boats was planned in 1942, and work started on the first in January 1943 at the Kure, Hiroshima arsenal. Within a year the plan was scaled back to five, of which only three (&quot;I-400&quot; at Kure, and and &quot;I-402&quot; at Sasebo) were completed.

==Origins==
The &quot;I-400&quot; class was the brainchild of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet. Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, he conceived the idea of taking the war to the United States mainland by making aerial attacks against cities along the U.S. western and eastern seaboards using submarine-launched naval aircraft. He commissioned Captain Kameto Kuroshima to make a feasibility study.

Yamamoto submitted the resulting proposal to Fleet Headquarters on 13 January 1942. It called for 18 large submarines capable of making three round-trips to the west coast of the United States without refueling or one round-trip to any point on the globe. They also had to be able to store and launch at least two attack aircraft armed with one torpedo or bomb. By 17 March, general design plans for the submarines were finalized. Construction of &quot;I-400&quot; commenced at Kure Dock Yards on 18 January 1943, and four more boats followed: &quot;I-401&quot; (April 1943) and &quot;I-402&quot; (Oct 1943) at Sasebo; &quot;I-403&quot; (Sept 1943) at Kobe and &quot;I-404&quot; (February 1944) at Kure. Only three were completed.

Following Yamamoto&#x27;s death in April 1943, the number of aircraft-carrying submarines to be built was reduced from eighteen to nine, then five and finally three. Only &quot;I-400&quot; and &quot;I-401&quot; actually entered service; &quot;I-402&quot; was completed on 24 July 1945, five weeks before the end of the war, but never made it to sea.

==Design features and equipment==
Each submarine had four engines and carried enough fuel to go around the world one-and-a-half times—more than enough to reach the United States traveling east or west. Measuring more than long overall, they displaced , more than double their typical American contemporaries. The cross-section of its pressure hull had a unique figure-of-eight shape which afforded the necessary strength and stability to handle the weight of a large on-deck aircraft hangar. To allow stowage of three aircraft along the vessel&#x27;s centerline, the conning tower was offset to port.

Located approximately amidships on the top deck was a cylindrical watertight aircraft hangar, long and in diameter. The outer access door could be opened hydraulically from within or manually from the outside by turning a large hand-wheel connected to a rack and spur gear. The door was made waterproof with a rubber gasket.

Situated atop the hangar were three waterproofed Type 96 triple-mount  autocannon for AA defence, two aft and one forward of the conning tower. A single autocannon on a pedestal mount was also located just aft the bridge. One Type 11, deck gun was positioned aft of the hangar. It had a range of .

Eight torpedo tubes were mounted in the bow, four above and four below. There were no aft tubes.

Stowed in an open recessed compartment on the forward port side, just below top deck, was a collapsible crane used to retrieve the submarine&#x27;s &quot;Seiran&quot; floatplanes. The crane had an electrically operated hoist and was capable of lifting approximately . It was raised mechanically to a height of via a motor inside the boat. The boom extended out to a length of .

A special trim system was fitted to the boats, allowing them to loiter submerged and stationary while awaiting the return of their aircraft. However, operation of this system was noisy and its usefulness was in doubt.

Strung along the submarine&#x27;s gunwales were two parallel sets of demagnetization cables, running from the stern to the bow planes. They were meant to protect against magnetic mines, by nullifying the magnetic field which normally triggers the mines fusing system. A similar demagnetizing system was carried on many Japanese surface ships during the first part of the war, until they were later removed during refitting.

Electronics on board the &quot;I-400&quot;s included a Mark 3 Model 1 air search radar equipped with two separate antennas. This unit was capable of detecting aircraft out to a range of . The boats were also equipped with Mark 2 Model 2 air/surface radar sets with distinctive horn-shaped antennas. Each boat carried an E27 radar warning receiver, connected to both a trainable dipole antenna and a fixed non-directional antenna made up of a wire mesh basket and two metal rods.

The submarines were equipped with two periscopes of German manufacture, about long, one for use during daylight and the other at night.

A special anechoic coating made from a mixture of gum, asbestos, and adhesives was applied to the hulls from the waterline to the bilge keel. This coating was apparently based on German research, though completely different in composition from German anechoic tiles such as &quot;Alberich&quot; or &quot;Tarnmatte&quot;. This was intended to absorb or diffuse enemy sonar pulses and dampen reverberations from the boat&#x27;s internal machinery, theoretically making detection while submerged more difficult, though its effectiveness was never conclusively established.

In May 1945, &quot;I-401&quot; was fitted with a German-supplied snorkel, a hydraulically raised air intake device allowing the boat to run its diesel engines and recharge its batteries while remaining at periscope depth. This retrofit occurred while the boat was laid up at Kure for repairs after being damaged by an American mine in April.

&quot;I-402&quot; was completed shortly before the war ended, but had been converted during building to a tanker and was never equipped with aircraft.

==Characteristics==
The &quot;I-400&quot;-class subs were unwieldy and relatively difficult to maneuver while surfaced owing to their small rudders. The large superstructure also caused the sub to veer off course during any strong wind. The maximum safe diving depth of the &quot;I-400&quot;-class submarine was only 82% of its overall length, which presented problems if the submarine dived at too steep an angle in an emergency. Because of their large aircraft hangars and conning tower, all &quot;I-400&quot;-class boats had significant visual and radar signatures on the surface, and could be detected by aircraft relatively easily. Dive time was 56 seconds, nearly double that of U.S. fleet subs, which made the boats easier to destroy from the air when caught on the surface.

When submerged and traveling at a slow speed of two knots, the offset superstructure forced the helmsman to steer seven degrees starboard in order to steer a straight course. When conducting a torpedo attack the captain had to take into account his larger turning circle to starboard than to port, again because of the offset design. Like other Japanese submarines, crew members in &quot;I-400&quot; subs had no air conditioning to control temperatures in tropical waters and no flush toilets. Lack of cold storage greatly limited the crew&#x27;s diet, while inadequate sleeping quarters forced some of the crew to sleep on the decks or in passageways.

===Aircraft===

The hangar of the &quot;I-400&quot;s was originally designed to hold two aircraft. In 1943, however, Commander Yasuo Fujimori, Submarine Staff Officer of the Naval General Staff, requested it be enlarged. This was deemed feasible and, as remodelled, &quot;I-400&quot;s could stow up to three Aichi M6A &quot;Seiran&quot; floatplanes.

The &quot;Seiran&quot; was specifically designed for use aboard the submarines and could carry an bomb, with a range of at . To fit inside the narrow confines of the hangar, the floats were removed and stowed, the wings rotated 90 degrees and folded backward hydraulically against the fuselage, the horizontal stabilizers folded down and the top of the vertical stabilizer folded over so the overall forward profile of the aircraft was within the diameter of its propeller. When deployed for flight, the aircraft had a wingspan of and a length of . A crew of four could prepare and launch all three in 30 minutes (or 15 minutes if the planes&#x27; pontoons were not first attached, which would make recovery impossible). As the &quot;Seiran&quot; would normally be launched at night, parts and areas of the plane were coated with luminescent paint to ease assembly in the dark.

The &quot;Seiran&quot;s were launched from a Type 4 No. 2 Model 10 compressed-air catapult on the forward deck of the submarine. Underneath the catapult track were four high-pressure air flasks connected in parallel to a piston. The aircraft, mounted atop collapsible carriages via catapult attachment points along their fuselages, would be slung 70–75 feet along the track, though the piston itself only moved between eight and ten feet during operation.

Two sets of pontoons for the &quot;Seiran&quot;s were stored in special watertight compartments located just below the main deck on either side of the catapult track. From there they could be quickly slid forward on ramps and attached to the plane&#x27;s wings. A third set of pontoons and additional spares were kept inside the hangar.

The aircraft were to be launched by catapult, and fly their missions. The launching submarine was to submerge and stay in place to allow the aircraft to navigate back to the area by dead reckoning, where it would land on the water with its floats, and be hoisted back aboard by crane. Overall the system was the same as used by Japanese Navy cruisers and light cruisers when launching their reconnaissance floatplanes (like the Aichi E13A), only with aircraft specially designed for use with the I-400 class submarine, and with the added complexity of having to locate a submerged and hidden vessel on return from the mission.

Although this was the typical mode of operation, in cases where fast launching and recovery was essential for escape (see below), the floatplanes could be launched without their floats, and ditched upon landing, saving the time spent recovering and re-hangaring the aircraft, which was a complex and lengthy procedure. This had the added benefit of eliminating the weight and considerable drag of the large and bulky floats, which in turn increased the speed and range of the aircraft, but made any recovery of the aircraft after completing the mission impossible. (For a similar defensive measure involving catapult-launched, disposable aircraft used by Allied convoy groups in the Battle of the Atlantic, see CAM ship.) In extreme circumstances, the aircraft could theoretically be launched and abandoned altogether while the submarine beat a hasty retreat, leaving the crews to fly their missions with no hope of return, perhaps as a &quot;kamikaze&quot; mission.

==Operational history==
As the war turned against the Japanese and their fleet no longer had free rein in the Pacific, the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, devised a daring plan to attack New York, Washington D.C., and other large American cities.

===Panama Canal strike===
Following an inspection of Rabaul in August 1943, Captain Chikao Yamamoto and Commander Yasuo Fujimori conceived the idea of using the &quot;sen toku&quot; (secret submarine attack) to destroy the locks of the Panama Canal in an attempt to cut American supply lines to the Pacific Ocean and hamper the transfer of U.S. ships. Intelligence gathering on the proposed target began later that year.

The Japanese were well aware that American fortifications existed on both sides of the Canal. On the Atlantic, the large coastal artillery batteries of Fort Sherman had a range of 30,000 yards (), preventing enemy ships from getting near enough to shell the locks. In the months following the attack on Pearl Harbor, air and sea patrols had been strengthened around both entrances, and barrage balloons and anti-submarine nets erected. In August 1942, the 88th Coast (Anti-Aircraft) Artillery unit was added to help defend against aerial attacks.

As the war continued and Japan&#x27;s fortunes declined, however, security around the Canal grew increasingly lax. In January 1944 Commander Fujimori personally interviewed an American prisoner-of-war who had done guard duty there. He told Fujimori that defensive air patrols had virtually ceased, since it was considered increasingly unlikely the Axis powers would ever attack the locks. This further convinced Fujimori of his plan&#x27;s feasibility.

A Japanese engineer who had worked on the Canal during its construction handed over hundreds of documents to the Naval General Staff, including blueprints of the Canal structures and construction methods. A team of three shipping engineers studied the documents and concluded that the locks at Miraflores on the Pacific side were the most vulnerable to aerial bombing, but the Gatun locks on the Atlantic side offered a chance of causing greater damage, since it would be harder to halt any outflow of water. They estimated the Canal would be unusable for at least six months following a successful attack on the locks.

To increase the size of the airborne attack force, Commander Fujimori requested that two additional fleet submarines still under construction at Kobe, &quot;I-13&quot; and &quot;I-14&quot;, be modified to house two &quot;Seiran&quot;s each, bringing the total number of planes available to ten. It was originally planned that two of the &quot;Seiran&quot;s would carry torpedoes and the other eight would carry bombs. They were to make a combined torpedo and glide-bombing attack against the Gatun Locks. Eventually though, torpedo-bombing was dispensed with, because only one &quot;Seiran&quot; pilot had mastered the technique.

The Panama Canal strike plan called for four aircraft-carrying submarines (&quot;I-400&quot;, &quot;I-401&quot;, &quot;I-13&quot; and &quot;I-14&quot;) to sail eastward across the Pacific to the Gulf of Panama, a journey expected to take two months. At a point off the coast of Ecuador, the submarines would launch their &quot;Seiran&quot; aircraft at 0300hrs on a moonlit night. The &quot;Seiran&quot;s, without floats, would fly at an altitude of across the northern coast of Colombia to the vicinity of Colón. Now on the Caribbean side of the isthmus, they would turn westward on a heading of 270 degrees, then angle south-west and make their final approach to the Canal locks at dawn. After completing their bombing runs, the &quot;Seiran&quot;s were to return to a designated rendezvous point and ditch alongside the waiting submarines where the aircrews would be picked up.

Around April 1945, Captain Ariizumi, the man appointed to carry out the attack, decided the &quot;Seiran&quot; pilots would make &quot;kamikaze&quot; ramming attacks against the gates, rather than conventional bombing runs, a tactic becoming increasingly common as the war went against the Japanese. The &quot;Seiran&quot; squadron leader had already suggested as much to Ariizumi earlier that month, though for a time this was kept secret from the other pilots. At the end of May, however, one pilot happened to observe a &quot;Seiran&quot; having its bomb-release mechanism removed and replaced with a fixed mount. Realizing the implications of this change, he angrily confronted the executive officer of the squadron, who explained that the decision to withhold this intention from the other men was made to &quot;avoid mental pressures on the aircrews.&quot;

By 5 June 1945, all four aircraft-carrying submarines had arrived at Nanao Wan where a full-scale wooden model of the Gatun Locks gate had been built by the Maizuru Naval Arsenal, placed on a raft and towed into the bay. The following night, formal training commenced with the &quot;Seiran&quot; flight crews practising rapid assembly, catapult launch and recovery of their aircraft. There was also rudimentary formation flying. From 15 June the &quot;Seiran&quot; pilots made practice daylight bombing runs against the wooden gate mock-up. By 20 June, all training ended and the operation was set to proceed.

===Ulithi atoll===
Before the attack could commence, Okinawa fell, and word reached Japan that the Allies were preparing an assault on the Japanese home islands. The Japanese Naval General Staff concluded the Panama Canal attack would have little impact on the war&#x27;s outcome, and more direct and immediate action was necessary to stem the American advance.

Fifteen American aircraft carriers had assembled at the Ulithi atoll, preparatory to making a series of raids against the home islands. The Japanese mission was changed to an attack on the Ulithi base.

The attack on Ulithi Atoll was to take place in two phases. The first, codenamed &quot;Hikari&quot; (light), involved transporting four C6N &quot;Saiun&quot; (Myrt) single-engined high-speed reconnaissance planes to Truk Island. They were to be disassembled, crated and loaded into the water-tight hangars of submarines &quot;I-13&quot; and &quot;I-14&quot;. Upon reaching Truk, the &quot;Saiun&quot;s would be unloaded, reassembled and then flown over Ulithi to confirm the presence of American carriers anchored there. Following the delivery, &quot;I-13&quot; and &quot;I-14&quot; were to sail for Hong Kong, where they would embark four &quot;Seiran&quot; attack planes. They would then head to Singapore and join &quot;I-400&quot; and &quot;I-401&quot; for further operations.

The second phase of the Ulithi attack was codenamed &quot;Arashi&quot; (storm). &quot;I-400&quot; and &quot;I-401&quot; were to rendezvous at a predetermined point on the night of 14/15 August. On 17 August they would launch their six &quot;Seiran&quot;s before daybreak on a &quot;kamikaze&quot; mission against the American carriers. The &quot;Seiran&quot;s, each with an bomb bolted to its fuselage, were to fly less than above the water to avoid radar detection and the American fighters expected to be patrolling above.

Just before departing Maizuru Naval Station, the &quot;Seiran&quot;s were completely over-painted in silver with American stars and bars insignias covering the red Hinomarus, a direct violation of the rules of war. This was an attempt to further confuse recognition if the aircraft were prematurely spotted, but it was not well received by the pilots. Some felt it was both unnecessary and a personal insult to fly under American markings, as well as dishonorable to the Imperial Navy.

Following the attack on Ulithi, &quot;I-400&quot; and &quot;I-401&quot; would sail for Hong Kong. There they would take on six more &quot;Seiran&quot;s and sail for Singapore, where fuel oil was more readily available. They would then join &quot;I-13&quot; and &quot;I-14&quot; and stage further attacks with a combined force of ten &quot;Seiran&quot; aircraft.

On 22 June, &quot;I-13&quot; and &quot;I-14&quot; arrived at Maizuru Harbor to take on fuel. They reached Ominato on 4 July to pick up their &quot;Saiun&quot; reconnaissance aircraft. &quot;I-13&quot; departed for Truk on 11 July but never reached her destination. She was detected running on the surface, attacked, and damaged by radar-equipped TBM Avengers on 16 July. An American destroyer escort later arrived and sank her with depth charges.

Japan surrendered before the Ulithi attack was launched, and on 22 August 1945, the crews of the submarines were ordered to destroy all their weapons. The torpedoes were fired without arming and the aircraft were launched without unfolding the wings and stabilizers. When &quot;I-400&quot; surrendered to the American destroyer, , the U.S. crew was astounded at her size, nearly longer than the USS &quot;Blue&quot; and just as wide – considerably longer and wider than the largest American fleet submarine of the day.

===Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night===

The Japanese conceived of an attack on the United States through the use of biological weapons specifically directed at the civilian population in San Diego, California. Dubbed &quot;Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night&quot;, the plan was to launch aircraft from five &quot;I-400&quot; submarines near Southern California at night, who would then drop &quot;infected flea&quot; bombs on the intended target, in the hope that the resulting infection would spread to the entire Western seaboard and kill tens of thousands of people. The plan was scheduled for September 22, 1945, but Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945, before the operation was carried out.

==American inspections==

The U.S. Navy boarded and recovered 24 submarines, including the three &quot;I-400&quot; submarines, taking them to Sasebo Bay to study them. While there, they received a message that the Soviets were sending an inspection team to examine the submarines. To prevent this, Operation &quot;Road&#x27;s End&quot; was instituted. Most of the submarines were taken to a position designated as Point Deep Six, about southeast of Fukue Island, packed with charges of C-3 explosive and destroyed; they sank to a depth of .

Four remaining submarines, &quot;I-400&quot;, &quot;I-401&quot;, and , were sailed to Hawaii by U.S. Navy technicians for further inspection. Upon completion of the inspections, the submarines were scuttled in the waters off Kalaeloa near Oahu in Hawaii by torpedoes from US submarine on June 4, 1946, to prevent the technology from being made available to the Soviets who were demanding access to them. Dr. James P. (Jim) Delgado of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s maritime heritage program reported that the official government position that the exact location of the sinking was unknown, but has been confirmed by declassified US Navy documents.

==Artifacts==
The wreckage of &quot;I-401&quot; was discovered by the &quot;Pisces&quot; deep-sea submarines of the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory in March 2005 at a depth of . It was reported that &quot;I-400&quot; was later found by the same team off the southwest coast of the Hawaiian island of Oahu in August 2013 at a depth of . NOAA researcher Jim Delgado, working aboard &quot;Pisces V&quot;, told the Chicago Tribune &quot;It was torpedoed, partially collapsed and had sunk at a steep angle.&quot; The submarines scuttled off the Japanese coast were located in July 2015.

A restored &quot;Seiran&quot; airplane is displayed at the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s Udvar-Hazy Center in suburban Washington, D.C. It is the only surviving example of this aircraft, and was found at the Aichi Aircraft Factory following the end of the war in August 1945. Shipped to Naval Air Station Alameda, it was left on outdoor display until 1962, when it was transferred to the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Silver Hill, Maryland. There it remained in storage until 1989, when a comprehensive restoration effort was mounted. Though the plane had been ravaged by weather and souvenir collectors, and original factory drawings were lacking, the restoration team was able to reconstruct it accurately, and by February 2000 it was ready for display.

<doc id="497963" wikidata="Q747064" url="?curid=497963" title="Cairngorms">
<text>The Cairngorms () are a mountain range in the eastern Highlands of Scotland closely associated with the mountain Cairn Gorm. The Cairngorms became part of Scotland&#x27;s second national park (the Cairngorms National Park) on 1 September 2003. Although the Cairngorms give their name to, and are at the heart of, the Cairngorms National Park, they only form one part of the national park, alongside other hill ranges such as the Angus Glens and the Monadhliath, and lower areas like Strathspey.

The Cairngorms consists of high plateaux at about above sea level, above which domed summits (the eroded stumps of once much higher mountains ) rise to around . Many of the summits have tors, free-standing rock outcrops that stand on top of the boulder-strewn landscape. In places, the edges of the plateau form steep cliffs of granite and they are excellent for skiing, rock climbing and ice climbing. The Cairngorms form an arctic-alpine mountain environment, with tundra-like characteristics and long-lasting snow patches. This area is home to bird species such as ptarmigan, dotterel, snow bunting, curlew and red grouse, as well as mammals such as mountain hare. The plateau also supports Britain&#x27;s only herd of reindeer (albeit semi-domesticated). Surrounding the central massif are many remnants of the Caledonian forest in straths and glens of the Rivers Spey and Dee. These forests support many species that are rare elsewhere in Britain, including red squirrels, pine marten, wood ants, Scottish crossbill, capercaillie and crested tit.

There are no glaciers, but snow can fall in any month of the year, and snow patches usually persist all summer; for snow and ice climbing, the area is the most dependable in Britain. The mountains are also popular for hill-walking, ski touring and climbing, and there are three alpine ski centres in the range, at Cairn Gorm, The Lecht and Glenshee.

The range lies in the Scottish council areas of Aberdeenshire, Moray and Highland, and within the counties of Aberdeenshire, Inverness-shire and Banffshire.

==Etymology==

The original Gaelic name for the range is &quot;Am Monadh Ruadh&quot; (the red hills), distinguishing them from &quot;Am Monadh Liath&quot; (the grey hills), which lie to the west of the River Spey:
The English language name for the range is Cairngorms, and is derived from Cairn Gorm, which is prominent in the view of the mountains from Speyside. The earliest reference to this name appears to be from a Colonel T. Thornton, who visited the area in about 1786:
Cairn Gorm is generally translated as &quot;Blue Cairn&quot;, although the Gaelic &quot;gorm&quot; is also used as an adjective and verb, meaning green or greening and is often seen in connection with growing grass. Thus, there is a contradiction or confusion, because the original Scottish Gaelic name of the mountains translates to English as the &quot;red hills&quot; whilst their English name is the &quot;blue hills&quot; or the &quot;green hills&quot;.

==Geography==

The Cairngorms consist of three large elevated plateaux adorned with low, rounded glacial mountains, and divided by the passes of the Lairig an Laoigh and the Lairig Ghru. The range gives the sense of being a single plateau, because the passes that cut through them are not very deep: the summit of Lairig an Laoigh lies at , whilst the summit of the Lairig Ghru is at above sea level at the Pools of Dee, where the water may be frozen over even in mid-summer. This means a walker could cross between the Cairntoul () – Braeriach () massif to the Ben Macdui () – Cairn Gorm () massif and thence onto the Beinn a&#x27; Bhùird () – Ben Avon () massif without descending below the summit of the Lairig an Laoigh. The range is drained by the Rivers Dee and Spey; and the latter&#x27;s two tributaries: the Rivers Feshie and Avon.

The approximate southern boundary of the Cairngorm range is generally reckoned to run from slightly east of Braemar, west along the Dee and Glen Geldie to the head of Glen Feshie. The western edge of the range is defined by Glen Feshie and the River Spey as far as Aviemore, with the northern boundary running roughly eastward from Aviemore through Glenmore to Glen Avon. The eastern boundary is defined by Glen Avon and the Am Bealach Dearg, thus ending slightly east of Braemar.

The Cairngorms feature the highest, coldest and snowiest plateaus in the British Isles and are home to five of the six highest mountains in Scotland:

* Ben Macdui ()
* Braeriach ()
* Cairn Toul ()
* Sgor an Lochain Uaine ()
* Cairn Gorm ()

There are no public roads through the Cairngorms, and all the public roads in the general area either skirt the Cairngorms or stop short, providing access to them only. From the south and south-east, motorised access ends at Linn of Dee, or Allanaquoich. From the north-west, a road passes Coylumbridge, Glenmore and the Sugarbowl to end at the car park at the Cairngorm Mountain ski resort. The majority of hill-walkers access the range from these road ends.

==Climate==

In terms of height, remoteness and the severe and changeable weather, the Cairngorms are the most arduous area in the United Kingdom. The plateau area has a Tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;), and the shattered terrain is more like the high ground in high-arctic Canada or northern Norway than what is often observed in the European Alps or Rockies. The weather often deteriorates rapidly with elevation so that, when there are moderate conditions below the plateau, the top can be stormy or misty, and there can be icy or powdery snow. Even when no snow is falling, the wind can whip up lying snow to produce white-out conditions for a few metres above the surface, and snowdrifts can build up rapidly in sheltered places. Gravel can be blown through the air, and walking can be impossible.
The lowest recorded temperature in the United Kingdom has twice been recorded in the Cairngorms, at Braemar, where a temperature of , was recorded on 11 February 1895 and 10 January 1982. The greatest British wind speed of was measured at Cairngorm summit weather station in January 1993. The weather can be very hazardous at times, with dangerous and unpredictable conditions. What is often described as Britain&#x27;s worst mountaineering tragedy, the Cairngorm Plateau Disaster, left five children and one adult dead in November 1971.

Cairn Gorm gets of snow annually according to snowforecast.com.
===Snow patches===

The Cairngorms hold some of the longest-lying snow patches in Scotland:

*On Ben Macdui, snow has been known to persist at a few locations from one winter to the next.
*Lying at the north-eastern shoulder of Cairn Gorm is Ciste Mhearad. This hollow contains a patch which, hitherto, was known to persist through many years, but has not done so since 2000. Observations in 2007 and 2008 revealed that September was the month when final melting occurred for this patch. It sits at an elevation of and is located at approximately .
*Braeriach&#x27;s Garbh Choire Mòr is the location of Scotland&#x27;s most persistent snow beds. Snow has been absent from this corrie just 11 times in the last century: 1933, 1959, 1996, 2003, 2006, 2017, 2018, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Situated at an elevation of about 1140 m, these patches are located around ; the two most long-lasting patches are known as &quot;the Pinnacles&quot; and &quot;the Sphinx&quot; after the rock climbs lying above them. Recent studies based on morraine, avalanche debris fields and climate models suggest it is likely that Garbh Choire Mòr (as well as Coire an Lochain in the northern corries) contained glaciers as recently as the 19th century.

In 1994, the Cairngorms and surrounding mountains of north-east Scotland had 55 surviving patches, an exceptional number.

==Geology==

The Cairngorms were formed 40 million years before the last ice age, when slight uplift raised an eroded peneplain based on an exposed granite pluton. The highest present-day peaks represent eroded monadnock hills. During the ice ages, the ice caps that covered most of northern Scotland remained static—frozen to the ground for long periods—and actually protected the rounded summits and valleys and deep, weathered granite of the mountains of the area. Glacial erosion is represented in deep valleys which dissect the area. Many valleys are littered with glacial deposits from the period of glacial retreat. The most famous valley is the Lairig Ghru pass, a gouge through the centre of the mountains—a u-shaped valley, now partly filled with extensive scree produced by intense frost action during ice-free periods. Many parts of the Cairngorms exhibit classic periglacial weathering which occurred during cold periods in ice-free areas.

Tors are a common feature of the Cairngorm granite massif, being especially frequent on Ben Avon and Beinn Mheadhoin and impressively high on Bynack More. They represent masses of granite which are less closely jointed than surrounding rock and which have therefore been less susceptible to underground weathering associated with fluid percolation along joints. The present tors have been exhumed over a long period of time, not least by periglacial processes associated with ice ages during the Quaternary period.

==Nature and conservation==

The Cairngorms provide a unique alpine semi-tundra moorland habitat, home to many rare plants, birds and animals. Speciality bird species on the plateaux include breeding ptarmigan, dotterel, snow bunting, golden eagle, ring ouzel and red grouse, with snowy owl, twite, purple sandpiper and Lapland bunting seen on occasion. Mammal species include red deer and mountain hare, as well as the only herd of reindeer in the British Isles. They now roam the high Cairngorms, after being reintroduced in 1952 by a Swedish herdsman. The herd is now stable at around 150 individuals, some born in Scotland and some introduced from Sweden; since the individuals depend on humans for food and come from domesticated stock, they are not considered wild.

The surrounding areas feature an ancient woodland, one of the last major ones of its kind in the British Isles, known as the Caledonian forest. In the forests, capercaillie, black grouse, Scottish crossbill, parrot crossbill and crested tit are found. Of particular fame is the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) reserve at Abernethy Forest and Loch Garten. A famous pair of ospreys are present in the summer months, and they often attract large crowds to see them. The forest is home to the endangered capercaillie and endemic Scottish crossbill.

Research into lichen communities in the Cairngorms has shown that the area hosts distinctive terricolous (ground-dwelling) lichen vegetation associated with different types of plant communities. The most diverse lichen assemblages are found in the low-montane zone (750–900 m), particularly in prostrate &quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot; heath, where fruticose macrolichens are co-dominant with vascular plants. The lichen vegetation of the Cairngorms, while significant within Britain, is best considered a species-poor outlier of Scandinavian heath communities. Three main National Vegetation Classification (NVC) communities support significant lichen vegetation in the area: &quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;–&quot;Cladonia arbuscula&quot; heath at lower elevations, &quot;Vaccinium myrtillus&quot;–&quot;Cladonia arbuscula&quot; heath at intermediate levels, and &quot;Oreojuncus trifidus&quot;–&quot;Racomitrium lanuginosum&quot; rush heath on exposed summits. The distribution and diversity of lichens varies across the range, with the northern Cairngorms showing the greatest diversity, which decreases both eastward and westward due to changes in vascular plant and bryophyte cover.

As well being included as part of the Cairngorms National Park the Cairngorm Mountains are designated as a national scenic area, one of 40 such areas in Scotland. Apart from a small area around the Cairngorm Ski Area, the whole of the mountain area is protected as both a Special Area of Conservation and a Special Protection Area, thus forming part of the Natura 2000 network of protected sites. The Cairngorms are classified as a Category IV protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

The Cairngorms were declared a national nature reserve (NNR) in 1954, being the largest NNR in Britain. In 2006 Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) reviewed the Cairngorms NNR, and it was decided that the reserve should be broken up into separate, smaller reserves that reflected existing management units. There now are four NNRs within the core mountain area of the Cairngorms. Mar Lodge Estate, which covers the south side of the plateau and the watershed of the upper Dee has been classified as a national nature reserve since May 2017. The Abernethy Forest National Nature Reserve covers a stretch of land from the plateau down to Loch Garten on the north side of the range, and Glenmore Forest Park, covering a remnant of the Caledonian Forest surrounding Loch Morlich, is also designated as a national nature reserve. The Invereshie and Inshriach National Nature Reserve lies on the western flanks of the range, and extends to the summit of Sgòr Gaoith.

===Threats to the ecosystem===
The Cairngorms represents an unusually cold area of mountains in a maritime climate at 57 degrees north. The climate is projected to warm—and precipitation patterns to change—under present climate change models. This is an over-riding concern for the long-term conservation of this area. Ptarmigan has been considered as an indicator species for this process, although the natural population cycles of this bird do not seem to have been disrupted as yet.

Other man-made threats include the problems of popularity in a country with limited wilderness resources and a large, relatively affluent urban population. These include various types of recreation and the associated trampling damage and erosion, disturbance, litter and threats to water quality.

==Human habitation and ownership==

The valleys between the individual plateaux were used as drove roads by cattle drovers who built rough protective shelters for their arduous journeys. At about the same time that droving was dying out towards the end of the 19th century, deer stalking estates were flourishing, and so the shelters were developed into bothies to provide improved, though still primitive, accommodation for gamekeepers. In modern times, these bothies have been taken over by the Mountain Bothies Association for use by walkers and climbers to provide shelter and rough sleeping accommodation. With the exception of the bothies, there are no buildings or settlements within the Cairngorms, nor is there evidence for historic settlement, except in the uppermost reaches of the Derry and Gairn rivers. In the surrounding areas, villages such as Aviemore and Braemar provide a base for visitors to the core mountain area.

Much of the core mountain area is owned by conservation bodies, with the National Trust for Scotland owning Mar Lodge Estate, and the RSPB&#x27;s Abernethy Estate stretching from the lower slopes up to the plateau. The main private landowners are the Glenavon Estate in the northeast, the Invercauld Estate in the southeast, the Glen Feshie Estate to the southwest and the Rothiemurchus Estate in the northwest.

==Leisure==

There is a funicular railway on Cairn Gorm serving the Cairn Gorm Ski Centre. The funicular opened in late 2001, and runs from a base station at 637 m up to the Ptarmigan Centre, situated at 1097 m, 150 m from the summit of Cairn Gorm. It was built amidst some controversy, with supporters of the scheme claiming that it would bring valuable tourist income into the area, whilst opponents argued that such a development was unsuitable for a supposedly protected area. A condition was therefore imposed under which walkers were not allowed outside the top station if arriving by funicular, although this did not apply to skiers and snowboarders in the winter. In 2010 the operating company proposed to modify this requirement to allow guided walks, whilst still preventing general access. Guided walks continued to be the only way for walkers and summer visitors to access the plateau if arriving via the funicular as of 2017.

The mountains are very popular for hill-walking, with eighteen Munros lying between Ben Avon in the east and Glen Feshie in the west. In winter these summits can often be reached by ski touring. The Cairngorms have excellent climbing, and has long attracted winter climbers, especially in the northern corries. This area boasts what was for a time probably the world&#x27;s hardest traditionally protected mixed climb: &quot;The Hurting&quot;, grade XI. As with all land in Scotland, there is a right of responsible access to the mountains for those wishing to participate in recreational pursuits, although the restriction on access via the funicular means walkers and climbers cannot use the railway to access the hills.

Angling for trout and salmon is popular in the lochs and rivers that surround the mountains, and Loch Avon in the very heart of the range is noted for its Arctic charr. Other popular activities include birdwatching and wildlife watching, whilst the Cairngorm Gliding Club (based in Glen Feshie) offers the opportunity for gliding.

<doc id="497972" wikidata="Q1850512" url="?curid=497972" title="Peter Hitchens">
<text>Peter Jonathan Hitchens (born 28 October 1951) is a British conservative author, broadcaster, journalist, and commentator. He writes for &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; and was a foreign correspondent reporting from both Moscow and Washington, D.C. Peter Hitchens has contributed to &quot;The Spectator, The American Conservative&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;First Things&quot;, &quot;Prospect&quot;, and the &quot;New Statesman.&quot; His books include &quot;The Abolition of Britain&quot;, &quot;The Rage Against God&quot;, &quot;The War We Never Fought&quot; and &quot;The Phoney Victory&quot;.

Previously a socialist and supporter of the Labour Party, Hitchens became more conservative during the 1990s. He joined the Conservative Party in 1997 and left in 2003, and has since been deeply critical of the party, which he views as the biggest obstacle to true conservatism in the UK. Hitchens describes himself as a Burkean conservative, social democrat, and Anglo Gaullist. He advocates conservative Christian political views, such as opposition to same-sex marriage and support of stricter recreational drug policies. Hitchens criticised the UK&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially lockdowns and mandates that the public wear face masks.

== Background ==
=== Early life and family ===
Peter Hitchens was born in Malta, where his father, Eric Ernest Hitchens (1909–1987), a naval officer, was stationed as part of the then Mediterranean Fleet of the Royal Navy. His mother, Yvonne Jean Hitchens (née Hickman; 1921–1973), had met Eric while serving in the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service (Wrens) during the Second World War. Hitchens has Jewish descent via his maternal grandmother, a daughter of Polish Jewish migrants. His grandmother revealed this fact upon meeting his wife Eve Ross. Though his brother Christopher was quick to embrace his Jewish identity following the principle of matrilineal descent, Peter noted that they were only one-32nd Jewish by descent and has not identified as Jewish himself.

As a youth, Hitchens wanted to be an officer in the Royal Navy, following his father. However, when he was 10, he learned he had a lazy eye that could not be corrected, thereby barring him from serving in the Royal Navy.

Hitchens attended Mount House School, Tavistock, The Prebendal School, Chichester, The Leys School, and the Oxford College of Further Education before being accepted at the University of York, where he studied Philosophy and Politics and was a member of Alcuin College, graduating in 1973.

Hitchens married Eve Ross in 1983. They have a daughter and two sons. Their elder son, Dan, was editor of the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot;, a London-based Roman Catholic newspaper. Hitchens lives in Oxford.

=== Religion ===
Hitchens was brought up in the Christian faith and attended Christian boarding schools but became an atheist, beginning to leave his faith at 15. He returned to church later in life, and is now an Anglican and a member of the Church of England.

=== Relationship with his brother ===
Hitchens&#x27; only sibling was the journalist and author Christopher Hitchens, who was two years older. Christopher said in 2005 that the main difference between the two was belief in the existence of God. Peter was a member of the International Socialists (forerunners of the modern Socialist Workers&#x27; Party) from 1968 to 1975 (beginning at age 17) after Christopher introduced him to them. The brothers fell out after Peter wrote a 2001 article in &quot;The Spectator&quot; which allegedly characterised Christopher as a Stalinist.

After the birth of Peter&#x27;s third child, the two brothers reconciled. Peter&#x27;s review of his brother&#x27;s book &quot;God Is Not Great&quot; led to a public argument between the brothers but no renewed estrangement.

In 2007, the brothers appeared as panellists on BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot;, where they clashed on a number of issues. In 2008, in the US, they debated the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the existence of God. In 2010 at the Pew Research Center, the pair debated the nature of God in civilisation. At a memorial service for Christopher after his death in 2011, Peter read St Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Philippians 4:8 which Christopher had read at their father&#x27;s funeral.

== Journalism ==
Christopher Hitchens helped his brother began his career in journalism at the &quot;Socialist Worker&quot;. Its editor, Roger Protz, recalled that Hitchens &quot;was as dry as a stick, and had no personality of any sort&quot;.

Hitchens joined the Labour Party in 1977 but left shortly after campaigning for Ken Livingstone in 1979, thinking it was wrong to carry a party card when directly reporting politics, and coinciding with a culmination of growing personal disillusionment with the Labour movement.

Hitchens worked for the local press in Swindon and then at the &quot;Coventry Evening Telegraph&quot;. He then worked for the &quot;Daily Express&quot; between 1977 and 2000, initially as a reporter specialising in education and industrial and labour affairs, then as a political reporter, and subsequently as deputy political editor. Leaving parliamentary journalism to cover defence and diplomatic affairs, he reported on the decline and collapse of communist regimes in several Warsaw Pact countries, which culminated in a stint as Moscow correspondent and reporting on life there during the final months of the Soviet Union and the early years of the Russian Federation in 1990–92. He took part in reporting the UK 1992 general election, closely following Neil Kinnock. He then became the &quot;Daily Express&quot; Washington correspondent. Returning to Britain in 1995, he became a commentator and columnist.

Hitchens reported from Somalia at the time of the United Nations intervention in the Somali Civil War.

In 2000, Hitchens left the &quot;Daily Express&quot; after its acquisition by Richard Desmond, stating that working for him would have represented a moral conflict of interest. Hitchens joined &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, where he has a weekly column and weblog in which he debates directly with readers. Hitchens has also written for &quot;The Spectator&quot; and &quot;The American Conservative&quot; magazines, and occasionally for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Prospect&quot;, and the &quot;New Statesman&quot;.

After being shortlisted in 2007 and 2009, Hitchens won the Orwell Prize in political journalism in 2010. Peter Kellner, one of the Orwell Prize judges, described Hitchens&#x27;s writing as being &quot;as firm, polished and potentially lethal as a Guardsman&#x27;s boot.&quot;

A regular on British radio and television, Hitchens has been on &quot;Question Time&quot;, &quot;Any Questions?&quot;, &quot;This Week&quot;, &quot;The Daily Politics&quot; and &quot;The Big Questions&quot;. He has authored and presented four documentaries; one on the BBC about Euroscepticism, and three on Channel 4, including one on the surveillance state, and critical examinations of Nelson Mandela and David Cameron. In the late 1990s, Hitchens co-presented a programme on Talk Radio UK with Derek Draper and Austin Mitchell.

In 2010, Hitchens was described by Edward Lucas in &quot;The Economist&quot; as &quot;a forceful, tenacious, eloquent and brave journalist. He lambasts woolly thinking and crooked behaviour at home and abroad.&quot; In 2009, Anthony Howard wrote of Hitchens, &quot;the old revolutionary socialist has lost nothing of his passion and indignation as the years have passed us all by. It is merely the convictions that have changed, not the fervour and fanaticism with which they continue to be held.&quot;

==Political views==

Hitchens describes himself as a Burkean conservative, a social democrat and more recently, a British Gaullist. In 2010, Michael Gove, writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, asserted that, for Hitchens, what is more important than the split between the Left and the Right is &quot;the deeper gulf between the restless progressive and the Christian pessimist.&quot; Hitchens joined the Conservative Party in 1997 and left in 2003. This was when he challenged Michael Portillo for the Conservative nomination in the Kensington and Chelsea seat in 1999.

He has been consistently dismissive of the modern UK Conservative Party since the 1990s. This is because he believes that the party has since then abandoned true social conservatism. His view is that conservatism should embody a Burkean sense of public duty, conscience and the rule of law, which he sees as the best guarantee of liberty. Furthermore, this view holds a general hostility to hasty reforms and adventurism. This was central to his criticism of many policy proposals by the New Labour government, which he viewed as attacks on liberty and facets of a constitutional revolution. He believes the Conservative Party should be a defender of establishment institutions such as the Church of England and the Monarchy, but has shifted to social liberalism instead. He believes that atheism, along with cultural liberalism, are the causes of the systematic undermining of Christianity. Hitchens has written &quot;The left&#x27;s real interests are moral, cultural, sexual and social. They lead to a powerful state. This is not because they actively set out to achieve one.&quot; He also believes that the First World War and the devolution of marriage are the causes of the demise of Christianity in Europe.

In his book &quot;The Cameron Delusion&quot;, Hitchens argues that in the last few decades, the party has become virtually &quot;indistinguishable from Blairite New Labour&quot;. He thinks the Conservative Party is now just a vehicle for &quot;obtaining office for the sons of gentlemen&quot; and he loathes the party. Hitchens&#x27;s claim that the &quot;Conservatives are now the main Left-wing party in the country&quot; in his &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; column has been met with criticism.

He is in favour of capital punishment, and was the only British journalist to attend and write about the execution of British-born Nicholas Ingram in America in 1995. He supports first-past-the-post voting. He is opposed to the privatisation of railways.

Hitchens has been a member of the campaign to clear the name of Bishop of Chichester, George Bell, from allegations of child sexual abuse. He has argued that the Church of England convicted him in what he described as a kangaroo court, and stated his wish that allegations are not treated as proven facts.

Hitchens &quot;completely&quot; opposes the Right to Buy scheme introduced by Margaret Thatcher, describing it as a &quot;grave mistake&quot; and advocates for replacing the UK&#x27;s system of Housing Benefit, which he describes as an &quot;absolute scandal&quot;, with a substantial increase in public housing.

He is a supporter of grammar schools. Hitchens describes himself as a &quot;lifelong trade unionist&quot;.

== Writings and thought ==
=== War and terrorism ===
He was opposed to the NATO intervention in Kosovo and 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, arguing that neither was in the interests of either Britain or the United States, and opposed the war in Afghanistan.

He believes that the UK should never have participated in World War I, and is very critical of the view that World War II was &quot;The Good War&quot;. His view on World War II is laid out in his book &quot;The Phoney Victory&quot;, in which he argues that the UK entered World War II too early, and that the UK overly glorifies World War II. He argues that while the allies were fighting a radical evil, they sometimes used immoral methods, such as the carpet bombing of German civilians. He believes that Britain&#x27;s entry into World War II led to its rapid decline after the war. This was because, among other things, it could not finance the war and was not prepared for it. As a result, it had to surrender much of its wealth and power to avoid bankruptcy. Hitchens&#x27; views on the UK in World War II have been met with criticism by historians, with Richard J. Evans describing his book &quot;The Phoney Victory&quot; as &#x27;riddled with errors&#x27;. Hitchens responded to Evans&#x27; review on his online web-blog.

Hitchens is not anti-war, since he believes that this position often leaves countries defenceless in times of war. Instead, he argues that military power and the threat of war can be deterrents against war. Hitchens wrote about his concern of the use of security (anti-terrorism) legislation and increased police powers under New Labour, and how it has been used to suppress civil liberties. In Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Dispatches&quot;, Hitchens said the result of this legislation was that Britain ended up &quot;sleepwalking into a Big Brother state&quot;.

=== European Union ===

Hitchens is critical of the European Union and argued for many years, before Brexit, that Britain would be better off outside it. In 2017 he endorsed the Flexcit model proposed by Richard North and Christopher Booker as the most sensible and moderate way to leave the EU while remaining in the European Economic Area to preserve the economic benefits of EU membership. However, he did not vote in the 2016 UK EU referendum because he is critical of referendums. Instead of a referendum, he argued that a leave decision would be best done by voting into power a political party whose manifesto committed the country to withdrawal by an act of Parliament.

===Vaccination===

Hitchens was against the MMR vaccine following the Lancet MMR autism fraud. He asked in a 2001 article: &quot;Is it really our duty to risk our children&#x27;s lives with this jab?&quot; In 2013, he defended this earlier article, saying he was criticising &quot;State bossiness in an age that has seen a catalogue of mistakes, panics and mysteries in the world of disease and medicine&quot; and referred to the thalidomide scandal. He has defended discredited former doctor Andrew Wakefield.

After being vaccinated against COVID-19 in 2021, Hitchens rejected accusations he is an anti-vaxxer, but said that he was &quot;more or less forced to have an immunisation I would not normally have bothered with&quot;.

=== War on drugs ===
Hitchens has written about the enforcement of drug laws, most notably in his book &quot;The War We Never Fought&quot; (2012). He advocates harsher penalties properly enforced for possession and illegal use of cannabis, claiming that &quot;cannabis has been mis-sold as a soft and harmless substance when in fact it&#x27;s potentially extremely dangerous.&quot; He is opposed to the decriminalisation of recreational drugs in general. In 2012, Hitchens gave evidence to the Parliamentary Home Affairs Select Committee as part of its inquiry into drugs policy, and called for the British government to introduce a more hard-line policy on drugs. Hitchens disagrees with the notion of drug addiction, arguing that it goes against the notion of free will. He says: &quot;People take drugs because they enjoy it.&quot;

In October 2023, Hitchens was interviewed by YouTuber and podcast host Alex O&#x27;Connor for the latter&#x27;s &quot;Cosmic Skeptic Philosophy Podcast;&quot; in the midst of recording, Hitchens abruptly stood up and declared to O&#x27;Connor &quot;I really have decided in the past hour I really do not like you at all [...] I had no opinions of you before, and now I actively dislike you,&quot; after which he reportedly lingered by the door while expressing his contempt for O&#x27;Connor for about 15 minutes prior to &quot;storming&quot; out of the recording studio. According to O&#x27;Connor, the subject of the podcast was &quot;...issues pertaining to drug decriminalisation, whether we are experiencing a moral decline in society and the influence of secularism on this question, and the state of monarchy in the UK.&quot;&quot;&quot;

=== LGBT rights and marriage ===
Hitchens has criticised the transgender rights movement, claiming that it promotes zealotry and that changes in traditional gender roles in society are &quot;destroying truth itself&quot;.

Hitchens was one of the most outspoken opponents of same-sex marriage in 2013, the year before same-sex marriage was legal in Britain. In speaking to &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Owen Jones in 2015, he said his real issue was with the decline of heterosexual marriage in society and the legalisation &quot;of what was in effect no-fault divorce&quot;, and that same-sex marriage is &quot;a side-effect ... It&#x27;s a consequence of the collapse of heterosexual marriage, and I regret now getting involved in the argument about same-sex marriage, because it was a Stalingrad, a diversion. Why is one worrying about a few thousand people who want to have same-sex marriages, without being at all concerned about the collapse of heterosexual marriage, which involves millions of people, and millions of children?&quot;

In 2019, the University of Buckingham organised a &quot;free-speech society&quot; after Hitchens&#x27; &quot;no-platforming&quot; by the University of Portsmouth over his views on gay rights, which they believed would cause conflict with LGBT events on campus. Hitchens was the first guest invited by the society to address students. In response to his being no-platformed by the University of Portsmouth, Hitchens was invited by the Archivist and the Head of History and Politics at The Portsmouth Grammar School to give a short talk on &quot;The myth of Russian aggression&quot; to Sixth Form pupils.

=== Environment ===
Hitchens has claimed that &quot;the greenhouse effect probably doesn&#x27;t exist&quot; and that the scientific consensus linking global warming to human activity has not been proven, describing it as &quot;modish dogma&quot;. He has criticised wind power in the United Kingdom and argued in 2015 that its expansion put the UK at risk of blackouts.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
Hitchens has repeatedly criticised the British government&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He has particularly criticised COVID-19 lockdowns in the UK, suggesting they would have negative consequences and questioning their epidemiological efficacy. Critics have described him as a &quot;lockdown sceptic&quot;. Full Fact evaluated his statement, where he said it was &quot;not possible&quot; for the first lockdown in March to cause the peak in daily infections and deaths to decline, in a fact-checking article, and concluded that this was &quot;wrong&quot; based on available evidence. Hitchens&#x27; view was also disputed by Paul Mason in the &quot;New Statesman.&quot; George Monbiot in &quot;The Guardian&quot; also critiqued Hitchens&#x27; views. Daniel Hannan meanwhile expressed agreement with Hitchens in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. A tweet by Hitchens stating four fifths of cases were asymptomatic was also described as &quot;misleading&quot; by &quot;Voice of America&quot;. Hitchens criticised Imperial College London modelling, which suggested that there could be up to 500,000 COVID-19 deaths if the government did not impose a lockdown.

He has supported Sweden&#x27;s response to the pandemic. He has opposed the mandatory wearing of face masks during the pandemic, referring to them as &quot;muzzles&quot;. He also believes that government mandates to wear face coverings are oppressive. He has been accused of promoting misinformation about the pandemic and public health restrictions by several sources.

=== English independence ===
Hitchens has spoken in favour of English nationalism, arguing that the United Kingdom should be dissolved and England should become an independent country once again.

=== Russia and Ukraine ===

In 2010, Hitchens argued that Crimea should be part of Russia rather than Ukraine, stating that the peninsula is historically Russian. In November, 2022, he said that there exists a &quot;virulent&quot; nationalism in Ukraine, and that it is easier &quot;to be a non-Scot in Scotland&quot; than &quot;an ethnic Russian in Ukraine&quot; due to the &quot;ugly strain of Ukrainian nationalism that made life difficult for ethnic Russians in Ukraine.&quot;

Hitchens has stated that Ukraine should not join NATO. He is also against providing military aid to Ukraine, having stated: &quot;The conflict in Ukraine was always unnecessary. It has done nothing but harm to Ukraine and Ukrainians. Ukraine has been used as a battering ram in someone else&#x27;s quarrel.&quot; Hitchens called for peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia.

Hitchens has been a vocal supporter of pro-Russian British journalist Graham Phillips in his fight against being sanctioned by the government of the United Kingdom. Although expressing criticism of Phillips and his work, Hitchens has been strongly critical of the British government, describing Phillips&#x27;s fight against sanctions as &quot;liberty fighting tyranny&quot; and &quot;one of the most important court cases of our time&quot;. Writing in support of Phillips, and Julian Assange, in March 2024, Hitchens described Phillips as a &quot;prisoner of the (UK) state&quot;.

== Publications ==
Hitchens is the author of &quot;The Abolition of Britain&quot; (1999) and &quot;A Brief History of Crime&quot; (2003), both critical of changes in British society since the 1960s. A compendium of his &quot;Daily Express&quot; columns was published as &quot;Monday Morning Blues&quot; in 2000. &quot;A Brief History of Crime&quot; was reissued as &quot;The Abolition of Liberty&quot; in April 2004, with an additional chapter on identity cards (&quot;Your papers, please&quot;), and with two chapters – on gun control (&quot;Out of the barrel of a gun&quot;) and capital punishment (&quot;Cruel and unusual&quot;) – removed.

&quot;The Broken Compass: How British Politics Lost its Way&quot; was published in May 2009, and &quot;The Rage Against God&quot; was published in Britain in March 2010, and in the US in May. Hitchens&#x27;s book &quot;The War We Never Fought: The British Establishment&#x27;s Surrender to Drugs&quot;, about what he sees as the non-existence of the war on drugs, was published by Bloomsbury in the autumn of 2012.

In June 2014, Hitchens published his first e-book, &quot;Short Breaks in Mordor&quot;, a compendium of foreign reports. &quot;The Phoney Victory: The World War II Illusion&quot; was published in August 2018 by I.B. Tauris. It addresses what Hitchens views as the national myth of the Second World War, which he believes did long-term damage to Britain and its position in the world. It was negatively reviewed by the historian Richard Evans in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, who described the book as &quot;riddled with errors&quot;.

<doc id="497973" wikidata="Q2994716" url="?curid=497973" title="Fire alarm notification appliance">
<text>A fire alarm notification appliance is an active fire protection component of a fire alarm system. A notification appliance may use audible, visible, or other stimuli to alert the occupants of a fire or other emergency condition requiring action. Audible appliances have been in use longer than any other method of notification. Initially, all appliances were either electromechanical horns or electric bells, which would later be replaced by electronic sounders. Most of today&#x27;s appliances produce sound levels between 70 and 100 decibels at 3 ft.

==Methods of notification==
The primary function of the notification appliance is to alert persons at risk. Several methods are used and documented in industry specifications published by UL. 

Alerting methods include:
* Sound (audible signals)
** 95 dB @ 3,100 Hz tone are used in many current notification devices.
** 80 dB @ 520 Hz tone are used in newer notification devices.
** 70 dB to 100 dB weighted for human hearing (higher decibels, in the 100 to 115 dB range, were common with older electromechanical horns)
* Light (visible signals)
** 15 cd to 1,000 cd candela output
** 1 to 2 flashes per second

==Coding==

Coding refers to the pattern or tones a notification appliance sounds in and is controlled either by the panel or by setting jumpers or DIP switches on the notification appliances. The majority of audible notification appliances installed prior to 1996 produced a steady sound for evacuation. In general, no common standard at that time mandated any particular tone, or pattern for audible fire alarm evacuation signals. While less common than a steady sound, differing signaling methods were used for the same purpose. These are named with respect to their distinctive structure and include, March Time (usually 120 pulses per minute but sometimes at 90 pulses or 20 pulses per minute, depending on the panel), Hi-Lo (two different tones that alternate), Slow-Whoop (slow rising sweep upwards in tone) among others. Today these methods are confined to applications intended to trigger a response other than evacuation alone. In 1996, the ANSI and the NFPA recommended a standard evacuation pattern to eliminate confusion. The pattern is uniform without regard to the sound used. This pattern, which is also used for smoke alarms, is named the Temporal-Three alarm signal, often referred to as &quot;T-3&quot; or &quot;Code-3&quot; (ISO 8201 and ANSI/ASA S3.41 Temporal Pattern) and produces an interrupted four count (three half second pulses, followed by a one and one half second pause, repeated for a minimum of 180 seconds). CO (carbon monoxide) detectors are specified to use a similar pattern using four pulses of tone (often referred to as T4).

==Audibility==
From NFPA 72, 2002 Edition:
“7.4.2.1* To ensure that audible public mode signals are clearly heard, unless otherwise permitted by 7.4.2.2 through 7.4.2.5, they shall have a sound level at least 15 dB (Decibel) above the average ambient sound level or 5 dB above the maximum sound level having a duration of at least 60 seconds, whichever is greater, measured 1.5 m (5 ft) above the floor in the occupiable area, using the A-weighted scale (dBA).”

==Visual signals==
In 1970, Space Age Electronics introduced the first visual notification appliance, the AV32 light plate (which was installed over an existing horn) and V33 remote light. Meanwhile, in 1976, Wheelock introduced the first horn/strobe notification appliances with its 7000 series. The majority of visual signals throughout the 1970s and 1980s were white or red incandescent lights. In the 1980s, most new installations began to include visual signals, and more strobes started to appear. In the United States, the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) triggered changes in evacuation signaling methods to include the hearing impaired. Audible notification appliances would now have to include strobe lights with higher brightness intensity to alert the hearing impaired. This made incandescent lights inadequate for the purposes of the ADA.

Many existing installations that did not include visual signals were retrofitted with strobe plates. These retrofit plates would allow for the easy installation of a strobe without replacing the audible signal. Later, ADA codes also required that strobes be at least 15 candelas and have a flash rate of at least 60 flashes per minute (one flash per second).
Companies discontinued their translucent strobes, and replaced them with new, clear, high-intensity strobes. Today, strobe synchronization is often used to synchronize all strobes in a uniform flash pattern. This is to prevent individuals with photosensitive epilepsy from potentially experiencing seizures due to unsynchronized strobes.

==Voice evacuation==
Voice evacuation systems (also called Voice Alarm Systems) have become popular in most countries. Voice evacuation alarms typically are not as loud as horns or bells (although generally standards require the same minimum sound pressure levels), and usually sound an alarm tone (typically a slow whoop, code-3, or chime tone, although this depends on the country and particular application) and a voice message warning that an emergency has been reported and to evacuate the building (often also directing occupants to not use elevators). Voice evacuation systems can also be used by personnel to give specific live information and/or instructions over the alarm system using a built-in microphone, which provides a distinct advantage over horns or bells. The system can be stand alone (i.e. using dedicated loudspeakers, which can also feature integrated strobe lights), or the system can accommodate public address system functionality. In 1973, the Autocall fire alarm company (merged to SimplexGrinnell then relaunched), manufactured the first voice evacuation system.

===Voice evacuation in Europe===
In Europe, voice evacuation systems are normally a mandatory requirement for rail and air transport terminals, high-rise buildings, schools, hospitals, and other large facilities. Voice systems for emergency use date back at least as far as the second world war. Following the lead of companies like Avalon, Tannoy and Millbank Electronics etc., in the 1980s many other companies began producing voice-evacuation systems. In the 1990s, voice evacuation started to become the standard for large facilities, and is still growing in popularity. The use, design, operation and installation of Voice evacuation systems is governed in Europe by CENELEC European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization EN 60849 and in the UK by the British Standard BS 5839-Part 8, a system code of practice. This is joined by the European harmonised equipment standards family EN 54, and ISO 7240-16:2007.

== Effectiveness ==
Initial research into the effectiveness of the various alerting methods is sparse. From 2005 to 2007, research sponsored by the NFPA focused on understanding the cause of a higher number of deaths seen in high-risk groups such as the elderly, those with hearing loss, and those who are intoxicated.

Research findings suggest that a mid frequency (520 Hz) square wave output is significantly more effective at waking high-risk individuals.
More recent research suggests that strobe lights are not effective at waking sleeping adults with hearing loss and suggest that a different alarm tone is much more effective. Individuals in the hearing loss community are seeking changes to improved awakening methods.

===Effectiveness of mid frequency (520 Hz) sound===
Further NFPA research demonstrated the heightened waking effectiveness of mid frequency square wave auditory signals that use 520 Hz, especially when used to wake people with mild to moderately severe hearing loss. Two separate studies were conducted – one for the hard-of-hearing and one for the alcohol-impaired – in order to compare the waking effectiveness of 520 Hz mid frequency square wave devices and 3100 Hz pure tone T-3 sound devices.

Under the testing conditions, a 520 Hz square wave T-3 sound woke up 92% of hard-of-hearing participants, making it the most effective. The 3100 Hz pure tone T-3 sound woke up 56% of participants.

A summary of the studies shows that the 520 Hz square wave signal has at least 4 to 12 times more waking effectiveness than the current 3100 Hz signal.

===NFPA code implementation of mid frequency (520 Hz) sound===
Effective January 1, 2014, section 18.4.5.3 of the 2010 and later editions of NFPA 72 requires the mid frequency audible fire alarm signal in occupancy sleeping areas with a protected premises (building) fire alarm system. The Chapter 18 committee chose to apply the requirement to all sleeping areas – not just those where occupants have self-identified as having a hearing impairment. This was done intentionally for several reasons: in many cases, the applications impacted are lodging spaces such as hotels, and many people may not know they have a hearing impairment or they may be alcohol impaired.

The 520 Hz mid frequency signal is required in sleeping areas of the following buildings:
* Hotels and motels 
* College and university dormitories
* Retirement/assisted-living facilities without trained staff responsible for waking up patients
* Dwelling units within apartments and condominiums

According to NFPA 72-2010, section 18.4.5.3*, audible appliances provided for sleeping areas to awaken occupants shall produce a mid frequency alarm signal that complies with the following (effective January 1, 2014):
* (1) The alarm signal shall be a square wave or provide equivalent awakening ability.
* (2) The wave shall have a fundamental frequency of 520 Hz +/- 10 percent.

<text>Trim Castle () is a castle on the south bank of the River Boyne in Trim, County Meath, Ireland, with an area of 30,000 m2. Over a period of 30 years, it was built by Hugh de Lacy and his son Walter as the &quot;caput&quot; of the Lordship of Meath. The Irish Government currently own and are in charge of the care of the castle, through the state agency The Office of Public Works (OPW).

The castle is on the List of National Monuments in County Meath.

==History==
===De Lacy===
The land area of Meath was owned by the church but was granted to Hugh de Lacy in 1172 by Henry II of England as one of the new administrative areas. De Lacy built a huge ringwork castle defended by a stout double palisade and external ditch on top of the hill. There may also have been further defences around the cliffs fringing the high ground. Part of a stone footed timber gatehouse lies beneath the present stone gate at the west side of the castle.
The site was chosen because it is on raised ground, overlooking a fording point on the River Boyne. The area was an important early medieval ecclesiastical and royal site that was navigable in medieval times by boat up the River Boyne, about 25 miles from the Irish Sea. Trim Castle is referred to in the Norman poem &quot;The Song of Dermot and the Earl&quot;.

De Lacy left Ireland entrusting the castle to Hugh Tyrrel, baron of Castleknock, one of his chief lieutenants. The ringwork was attacked and burnt by forces of the Gaelic High King of Ireland, Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair; Tyrrel, having appealed in vain for help, was forced to flee. Ua Conchobair soon withdrew and De Lacy, or Raymond FitzGerald, immediately repaired or rebuilt the castle in 1173. After Hugh&#x27;s death in 1186 his son Walter de Lacy succeeded as Lord of Meath. He continued rebuilding and the castle was completed in the 1220s, most likely in 1224. The year when construction was completed was considered to be 1220 by historians in the 19th century but that is now in dispute.

===Geneville and Mortimer===
The next phase of the castle&#x27;s development took place at the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th century; a new great hall (with undercroft and attached solar in a radically altered curtain tower), a new forebuilding, and stables were added to the keep.

On Walter de Lacy&#x27;s death in 1241 his granddaughter Mathilda (&#x27;Maud&#x27;) inherited the castle. Her second husband was Geoffrey de Geneville (brother of the crusade historian Jean de Joinville), Lord of Vaucouleurs in Champagne, France, and of many lordships in England and Ireland which were to devolve upon his heirs. His son Piers de Geneville (who married Joan de Lusignan) died in 1292 leaving a daughter Joan, who in 1301 married Roger Mortimer (1st Earl of March). Mathilda having died in 1304, in 1308 Geoffrey conveyed his Irish lordships to Roger Mortimer, and entered the priory at St. Mary&#x27;s in Trim. Joan Mortimer inherited the title Baroness Geneville suo jure when Geoffrey died in 1314.

The castle thereby passed to the Mortimer family who held it until 1425, when the male line died out with Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March. After this the estate passed to Richard of York, son of Edmund&#x27;s sister Anne Mortimer by Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge. Richard of York was killed at the Battle of Wakefield in 1460, and in 1461 his son, King Edward IV, appointed Germyn Lynch, goldsmith of London, to be his representative at Trim as warden and master worker of the new issues of moneys and coins within the Castles of Dublin and Trim, and the town of Galway.

===Later ownership===

During the 15th century the Irish Parliament met in Trim Castle seven times and a mint operated in the castle. It was at that time the centre of administration for Meath and marked the outer northern boundary of The Pale. In the 16th century it fell into decline and was allowed to deteriorate, but it was refortified during the Irish Confederate Wars in the 1640s. In 1649 after the sacking of Drogheda, the garrison of Trim fled to join other Irish forces and the place was occupied by the army of Oliver Cromwell.

After the wars of the 1680s, the castle was granted to the Wellesley family who held it until Arthur Wellesley (the Duke of Wellington), sold it to the Leslies. In following years it passed via the Encumbered Estates Court into the hands of the Dunsany Plunketts. They left the lands open and from time to time allowed various uses, with part of the Castle Field rented for some years by the Town Council as a municipal dump, and a small meeting hall for the Royal British Legion erected. The Dunsany held the Castle and surrounds until 1993, when after years of discussion, Lord Dunsany sold the land and buildings to the State, retaining only river access and fishing rights.

===Restoration===
The Office of Public Works began a major programme of exploratory works and conservation, costing in the region of 4.5 million euro, including partial restoration of the moat and the installation of a protective roof on the keep. The castle was re-opened to the public in 2000.

==Structure==

With an area of 30,000 m2, Trim Castle is the largest Cambro-Norman castle in Ireland. The design of the central three-storey keep (also known as a donjon or great tower) is unique for a Norman keep being of cruciform shape, with twenty corners. It was built on the site of the previous large ring work fortification in at least three stages, initially by Hugh de Lacy (c. 1174) and then in 1196 and 1201–5 by Walter de Lacy.
The castle interior was partially the subject of archaeological digs, by David Sweetman of the OPW in the 1970s, and more extensively by Alan Hayden in the 1990s.

The surviving curtain walls are predominantly of three phases. The west and north sides of the enceinte are defended by rectangular towers (including the Trim Gate) dating to the 1170s; the Dublin gate was erected in the 1190s or early part of the 13th century; and the remaining wall to the south with its round towers dates to the first two decades of the 13th century.
The castle has two main gates. The one in the west side dates to the 1170s and sits on top of a demolished wooden gateway. The upper stories of the stone tower were altered to a semi-octagonal shape, c. 1200. The Dublin Gate in the south wall is a single round towered gate with an external barbican tower. It dates from the 1190s or early 13th century and was the first example of its type to be constructed in Ireland.
Apart from the keep, the main extant structures consist of the following: an early 14th-century three-towered fore work defending the keep entrance and including stables within it (accessed by a stone causeway crossing the partly filled-in ditch of the earlier ringwork); a huge late 13th-century three-aisled great hall (with an under croft beneath its east end opening via a water gate to the river); a stout defensive tower (turned into a solar in the late 13th century at the northern angle of the castle); a smaller aisled hall (added to the east end of the great hall in the 14th or 15th century); a building (possibly the mint) added to the east end of the latter hall; two 15th- or 16th-century stone buildings added inside the town gatehouse, 17th-century buildings (added to the end of the hall range and to the north side of the keep) and a series of lime kilns (one dating from the late 12th century, the remainder from the 18th and 19th centuries).

==Access==
The Office of Public Works operate a Guide Service at Trim Castle and the grounds are open to the public for self-guiding, on payment of an entry fee. Access to the Castle keep is by guided tour only, an entry fee also applies. In winter, the complex is open only on weekends and bank holidays.

==Popular culture==
The 1980 movie &quot;The Big Red One&quot;, starring Lee Marvin and Mark Hamill, was also partially shot in Trim and in particular at Trim Castle.

The castle is noted for the part it played in the filming of Mel Gibson&#x27;s film &quot;Braveheart&quot;. The castle was presented as the walled city of York; scenes that took place in London were also filmed here.

==Controversies==
In 2003 there was a controversy surrounding the decision by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government Martin Cullen not to oppose the construction of a five-storey hotel across the road from the castle. The development had been condemned by a local councillor, a senior inspector in An Bord Pleanála (acting in a private capacity, and later choosing to withdraw his appeal lest it be considered a conflict of interest) and heritage bodies, many of whom had been critical of the government&#x27;s treatment of other heritage sites such as Carrickmines Castle (the ruins of which were excavated partly to allow the completion of a roadway). The hotel was opened in August 2006.

The recent addition of buildings outside the west side of the town has further intruded on the castle remains.

<doc id="497979" wikidata="Q1676882" url="?curid=497979" title="Yablochkov candle">
<text>A Yablochkov candle (sometimes electric candle or Jablochkoff candle) is a type of electric carbon arc lamp, invented in 1876 by the Russian electrical engineer Pavel Yablochkov.

==Design==
A Yablochkov candle consists of a sandwich of two electrodes, which are long carbon rods, approximately 6 by 12 millimetres in cross-section, separated by a block of inert and insulating material such as plaster of Paris or kaolin. There is a small piece of fuse wire or carbon paste linking the two carbon rods at the top end. The assembly is mounted vertically into a suitable insulated holder. 
On application of the electric supply, the fuse wire &quot;blows&quot; and strikes the arc. The arc then continues to burn, gradually consuming the carbon electrodes and the intervening plaster, which melts at the same pace. The first candles were powered by a Gramme machine.
The drawback of using direct current was that one of the rods would burn at twice the rate of the other. This problem was initially solved by preparing the sandwich with one of the rods thicker than the other, but this solution was not practicable. The problem was eventually solved by powering the candles with alternating current which burned the two rods at the same speed.

The electrodes last about two hours or until the power is cut. A classic Yablochkov candle cannot be relit, since the fuse wire between the electrodes has been consumed. Later versions of the candle, however, included powdered metal in the inert separator. This would act as a new fuse wire, allowing a half-burnt candle to be restarted once extinguished.
The advantage of this design over other carbon arc designs is that it removes the need for a mechanical regulator to maintain the appropriate distance between the carbon electrodes to sustain the arc.

In his trials to power more sets of candles with different light flux and in order to obtain different voltages, Yablochkov invented the first transformers.

As any other carbon arc lamps, Yablochkov candles have a very bright light that can be used for lighting large lengths of streets or large interiors such as factories and train stations and its use as a street lighting system was cheaper than oil lamps.
The disadvantages of these lamps are related to a short duration, which implied replacing them after short periods of time. When lit they produce buzzing noise, dangerous UV rays, carbon monoxide emissions and radio frequency interference. During use they were a constant fire hazard principally due to sparks and high operating temperature.
==History==
In 1875 Yablochkov left Russia and started his Paris business; by 1876 he was granted the French patent 112024 for his candles. The first public experiment was held in London on April 15, 1876. The Yablochkov candles were first used commercially in 1877 in the &quot;Marengo hall&quot; of the department store Galeries du Louvre in Paris with an installation of 80 lamps. Their presence is mentioned by Émile Zola in his novel &quot;Au Bonheur des dames (Ladies paradise)&quot;. In this occasion Paris was nicknamed &quot;city of lights&quot;.

They were first demonstrated as street illumination during the Paris Exhibition of 1878, notably on the Avenue de l&#x27;Opéra, in Place du Theatre Français (now Place André Malraux) and in Place de l&#x27;Opéra. The 64 lamps had four to twelve candles each, connected in series and were enclosed in globes of enamelled glass. In December of the same year Yablochkov candles were installed along the Victoria Embankment in London.

Werner von Siemens visited the 1878 Paris Exhibition and negotiated to become a distribution agent for the candles in Germany; in return he delivered dynamo machines to Yablochkov. The candles were soon used in many European cities but also in other continents: cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City, New Delhi, Calcutta, and Madras were using them. The Shah of Persia and the King of Cambodia used the candles for their palaces.

The candles were successfully used aboard the French ironclad &quot;Amiral Duperré&quot;, launched in 1879.

In 1881 at the International Exposition of Electricity the Yablochkov candles were regarded as one of the main attractions. At that time their cost was estimated to have dropped from 66 cents (of French francs) in 1877 to just 10 cents, making them very convenient also with respect to gas lamps. The main drawback was that the candles needed a big power machine in order to be lit.

At the height of their success 8,000 candles per day were produced in France.

<text>The (; ) is a chess opening beginning with the moves:
:1. 
:2. 
:3. 

&quot;White aims to develop quickly – but so does Black. White can construct a but in unfavourable conditions a centre which cannot provide a basis for further active play.&quot;

The name &quot;Italian Game&quot; is also commonly used; however, that name is sometimes used instead to describe all openings starting 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4, including 3...Nf6 (the Two Knights Defence) and other less common replies.

The Giuoco Piano is assigned codes C50 to C54 in the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot;.
== History ==
The Giuoco Piano is one of the oldest recorded openings. The Portuguese writer Pedro Damiano played it at the beginning of the 16th century and the Italian Greco played it at the beginning of the 17th century. The Giuoco Piano was popular through the 19th century, but modern refinements in defensive play have led most chess masters towards openings like the Ruy Lopez that offer White greater chances for long-term initiative.

In modern play, grandmasters have shown distinct preference for the slower and more strategic Giuoco Pianissimo (4.d3, or 4.c3 Nf6 5.d3). Anatoly Karpov used the Giuoco Pianissimo against Viktor Korchnoi twice in the 1981 World Championship match, with both games ending in a draw; Garry Kasparov used it against Joël Lautier at Linares 1994, resigning after 29 moves; Vladimir Kramnik chose it against Teimour Radjabov at Linares (2004); Viswanathan Anand used it to defeat Jon Hammer in 2010; Magnus Carlsen used it against Hikaru Nakamura at London 2011, winning in 41 moves and Ian Nepomniachtchi used it against Magnus Carlsen in the 2021 World Championship match, losing in 49 moves.

== Variations ==
The main continuations on White&#x27;s fourth move are:
* 4., the Main line
* 4., the Evans Gambit, in which White offers a pawn in return for rapid 
* 4., the Giuoco Pianissimo
* 4., often with the intention of meeting 4...Nf6 with 5.d4, the Max Lange Attack, in which White opens up the , or 5.d3, the Giuoco Pianissimo

Other continuations are:
* 4. Nf6, the Four Knights Variation
* 4., the Italian Gambit, which is considered an inaccurate move order due to the reply 4...Bxd4
* 4.Bxf7+ Kxf7 5.Nxe5+ Nxe5, the Jerome Gambit, an opening where White sacrifices two pieces with the idea of exposing Black&#x27;s king and obtaining a 

=== Main line: 4.c3 ===
White plays 4.c3 in preparation for the central advance d2–d4. The main reply 4...Nf6 was first analysed by Greco in the 17th century. Alternatives include 4...Qe7, with the intention of holding on to the centre.

==== 4...Nf6 ====
5.d4 exd4 6.cxd4
:White can also try 6.e5, a line favoured by Evgeny Sveshnikov, when play usually continues 6...d5 7.Bb5 Ne4 8.cxd4 Bb6, with approximate . Additionally, White has a gambit alternative in 6.0-0, which Graham Burgess revived in the book &quot;101 Chess Opening Surprises&quot;; the critical line runs 6...Nxe4 7.cxd4 d5 8.dxc5 dxc4 9.Qe2 Qd3. The seldom seen pawn thrust 6.b4 was played in the off-balance upset encounter Fier–Mamedyarov, Chessable Masters 2023. After 6...Bb6 7.e5 d5 8.exf6 dxc4 9.Qe2+ Be6 10.b5, Black offered the sacrifice 10...Nb4. White choose to accept the offer with 11.cxb4, allowing Black a pair of connected passed pawns for the piece. Accurate play was required to hold back the passers&#x27; advance. Play continued 11...Qxf6 12.0-0 0-0 13.a4 a5 14.bxa5 Rxa5 15.Bg5 Qf5 16.Bd2 Raa8 17.Bb4 Rfe8 18.a5 Qxb5 19.Qd2 c5. White countered with 20.Bc3, attempting to exchange his extra bishop for the dangerous d-pawn, seeking to regain equality. Black eventually converted his advantage, with the simplifying and consolidating exchanges 20...Bd8 21.Bxd4 cxd4 22.Nxd4 Qd7 23.Nxe6 Qxe6.

6...Bb4+
:White now has a choice between 7.Nc3 and 7.Bd2. 7.Nc3 usually leads to the Møller Attack, an aggressive line involving the sacrifice of a pawn, but it has been largely abandoned in high-level games, as Black gains the advantage with accurate defence. 7.Bd2 offers about equal chances.

===== 7.Nc3 (including Greco Variation and Møller Attack) =====
7...Nxe4 8.0-0 (diagram) 

:Greco encouraged an attack on White&#x27;s with 8.0-0, allowing 8...Nxc3, the Greco Variation. If 9.bxc3 Bxc3?! 10.Qb3 Bxa1?, White wins with 11.Bxf7+ Kf8 12.Bg5. Greco&#x27;s game (probably analysis) continues 12...Ne7 13.Ne5 (13.Re1 and 13.Rxa1 also win) 13...d5 14.Qf3 Bf5 15.Be6 g6 16.Bh6+ Ke8 17.Bf7#. This is well-known, and Black can avoid it by playing 10...d5. For this reason, the Scottish master James Aitken proposed 10.Ba3, which gives White the advantage. After 9.bxc3, best for Black is 9...d5! 10.cxb4 dxc4 11.Re1+ Ne7 12.Qa4+! Bd7 13.b5 0-0 14.Qxc4 Ng6!

:In 1898, Danish player Jørgen Møller published analysis of the line in &quot;Tidsskrift for Skak&quot;. In what is now known as the Møller Attack, White sacrifices a pawn for development and the initiative.
8...Bxc3 9.d5 
:9.bxc3 is met with 9...d5!

9...Bf6
:On 9...Ne5, a possible continuation is 10.bxc3 Nxc4 11.Qd4 f5 12.Qxc4 d6.

10.Re1 Ne7 11.Rxe4 d6 12.Bg5 Bxg5 13.Nxg5 h6!
:13...0-0 14.Nxh7! has been analysed to a draw with best play, although Black has many opportunities to go wrong.

14.Bb5+
:After 14.Qe2 hxg5 15.Re1 Be6! 16.dxe6 (White also can try 16.Qd2 c6! 17.dxe6 f6 18.Bd3 d5 19.Rg4 Qc7 20.h3 0-0-0 21.b4, attacking) 16...f6 17.Re3 c6 18.Rh3 Rxh3 19.gxh3 g6 it is doubtful that White has compensation for the sacrificed pawn, according to Grandmaster Larry Kaufman; 14.Qh5 0-0 15.Rae1 Ng6! (or 15...Nf5!) also favours Black.
14...Bd7 15.Qe2 Bxb5 16.Qxb5+ Qd7 17.Qxb7
:17.Qe2 Kf8! wins a second pawn, as in Barczay–Portisch, Budapest 1969.

17...0-0 18.Rae1 Rab8 19.Qxa7 Nxd5 20.Qd4 Qf5 21.Nf3 Rb4
:and Black is clearly better.

===== 7.Bd2 =====
If White does not want to gambit , 7.Bd2!, Greco&#x27;s move, is a good alternative. The game could continue 7...Bxd2+ (Kaufman recommends 7...Nxe4 8.Bxb4 Nxb4 9.Bxf7+ Kxf7 10.Qb3+ d5!? [10...Kf8 11.Qxb4+ Qe7 12.Qxe7+ Kxe7 is safer, reaching an equal endgame] 11.Ne5+ Ke6! 12.Qxb4 c5!?) 8.Nbxd2 d5 9.exd5 Nxd5 10.Qb3 Nce7 (10...Na5 is an alternative, inviting a repetition of moves after 11.Qa4+ Nc6 [threatening 12...Nb6] 12.Qb3 Na5) 11.0-0 0-0 12.Rfe1 c6. In this position White has more freedom, but the isolated d-pawn can be a weakness. 7.Nbd2 is also a viable move for White, although this still only offers approximate equality. It has not been a popular choice among human players, but it seems to be recommended by computer engines. 7.Kf1?! has been largely abandoned.

==== 4...Qe7 and alternatives ====
Black can try to hold a in the centre at e5 with 4...Qe7, a move which first appeared in the Göttingen manuscript c. 1500. After 5.d4 (5.0-0 usually transposes) Bb6, White&#x27;s options include 6.0-0, 6.d5, 6.a4 and 6.Bg5. A typical continuation is 6.0-0 d6 7.a4 a6 8.h3 Nf6 9.Re1 0-0 (Leonhardt–Spielmann, Ostend 1907).

4...Bb6 usually transposes after 5.d4 Qe7.

Other 4th moves for Black are considered inferior.

=== Giuoco Pianissimo: 4.d3 ===

With 4., White plays the Giuoco Pianissimo (, a name given by Adolf Anderssen). White aims for a slow buildup, deferring the to d4 until it can be prepared. By avoiding an immediate confrontation in the centre, White prevents the early release of through exchanges and enters a positional maneuvering game. 4.Nc3 Nf6 5.d3 is the Giuoco Pianissimo Deferred. 4.d3 f5 is the not-so-quiet Lucchini Gambit; there can follow 5.Ng5 f4, the Dubois Variation.

If White plays c2–c3, the position can take some characteristics of the Ruy Lopez if the bishop retreats to c2 via b3. This idea has been taken up by some grandmasters, such as Anish Giri, to avoid the drawish Berlin Defence in the Ruy Lopez. White can also play b4 and a4, chasing the black bishop and staking out on the . Despite its slow, drawish reputation, this variation became more popular after being taken up by John Nunn in the 1980s. The common move orders are 4.c3 Nf6 5.d3 (&quot;ECO&quot; C54), and transposition from the Bishop&#x27;s Opening: 2.Bc4 Nf6 3.d3 Nc6 4.Nf3 Bc5 5.c3 or 5.0-0 d6 6.c3.

<doc id="497981" wikidata="Q233139" url="?curid=497981" title="Two Knights Defense">
<text>The Two Knights Defense (also called the Prussian Defense) is a chess opening that begins with the moves:
:1. 
:2. 
:3. 

First recorded by Giulio Cesare Polerio (c. 1550 – c. 1610) in the late 16th century, this line of the Italian Game was extensively developed in the 19th century. Black&#x27;s third move is a more aggressive defense than the Giuoco Piano (). Black allows White to attack his f7-pawn with 4.Ng5. If White does so, the game quickly takes on a tactical character: Black is practically forced to give up a pawn for the initiative. The complications are such that David Bronstein suggested that the term &quot;defense&quot; does not fit, and that the name &quot;Chigorin Counterattack&quot; would be more appropriate. The Two Knights has been adopted as Black by many aggressive players including Mikhail Chigorin and Paul Keres, and world champions Mikhail Tal and Boris Spassky. In modern grandmaster play, 3.Bc4 is less common than 3.Bb5, and the more solid 3...Bc5 is the most frequent reply, so the Two Knights Defense is infrequently seen. It remains popular with amateur players. The theory of this opening has been explored extensively in correspondence chess by players such as Hans Berliner and Yakov Estrin.
==Main variations==

===4.Ng5===

German master Siegbert Tarrasch called 4.Ng5 &quot;a real duffer&#x27;s move&quot; (&quot;ein richtiger Stümperzug&quot;) and Soviet opening theorist Vasily Panov called it &quot;primitive&quot;, but this attack on f7 practically wins a pawn by . Despite Tarrasch&#x27;s criticism, 4.Ng5 has remained a popular choice for White at all levels.

====Main line: 4...d5 ====
After 4...d5 White has little option but to play 5.exd5, since both the bishop and e4-pawn are attacked. Then Black usually plays 5...Na5 but there are other options:
* The recapture 5...Nxd5 is extremely risky. Albert Pinkus tried to bolster this move with analysis in 1943 and 1944 issues of &quot;Chess Review&quot;, but White gets a strong attack with either the safe Lolli Attack 6.d4, which Bobby Fischer thought to be very strong, or the sacrificial Fried Liver (or Fegatello) Attack 6.Nxf7! Kxf7 7.Qf3+ Ke6 8.Nc3. These variations are usually considered too difficult for Black to defend , but they are sometimes used in correspondence play. Lawrence Trent describes 5...Nxd5 as &quot;a well-known bad move&quot; (or words to that effect).
* The Fritz Variation 5...Nd4 and Ulvestad&#x27;s Variation 5...b5 are related as they share a common subvariation. American master Olav Ulvestad introduced 5...b5 in a 1941 article in &quot;Chess Review&quot;. White has only one good reply: 6.Bf1!, protecting g2 so White can answer 6...Qxd5 with 7.Nc3. Both replies 6.Bxb5 Qxd5 7.Bxc6+ Qxc6 and 6.dxc6 bxc4 7.Nc3 are weak for White. Black&#x27;s best response is to transpose to the Fritz Variation with 6...Nd4, making another advantage of 6.Bf1 apparent; the bishop is not attacked as it would be if White had played 6.Be2. German master Alexander Fritz (1857–1932) suggested 5...Nd4 to Carl Schlechter, who wrote about the idea in a 1904 issue of &quot;Deutsche Schachzeitung&quot;. In 1907 Fritz himself wrote an article about his move in the Swedish journal &quot;Tidskrift för Schack&quot;. White&#x27;s best reply is 6.c3, when the game often continues 6...b5 7.Bf1 Nxd5 8.Ne4 or 8.h4.
* The Berliner Variation, named in honor of IM / GMC Dr. Hans Berliner, continues the Fritz sub-line 8.Ne4 with 8...Qh4, from the famous game Estrin–Berliner, World Correspondence Championship 1965–68, eventually won by Black; this win was pivotal to Berliner&#x27;s eventual championship victory. That game, which saw Black embark on a very sharp sacrificial path, continued 9.Ng3 Bg4 10.f3 e4 11.cxd4 Bd6 12.Bxb5+ Kd8 13.0-0 exf3. IM / GMC Estrin later published, in 1971, the suggestion 14.Qb3!? as an improvement on the game continuation, and this possibility has continued to interest many players.
After 5...Na5, the Polerio Defense, Paul Morphy would play to hold the gambit pawn with 6.d3, the Kieseritzky Attack (or Morphy Variation), which has not been popular, since it has long been known that Black obtains good chances for the pawn with 6...h6 7.Nf3 e4 8.Qe2 Nxc4 9.dxc4 Bc5. (Bronstein once tried the piece sacrifice 8.dxe4!? with success, but its soundness is doubtful.)

Instead, White usually plays 6.Bb5+, when play usually continues 6...c6 (6...Bd7 is also possible) 7.dxc6 bxc6 8.Be2 h6. (The move 8.Qf3, popular in the nineteenth century and revived by Efim Bogoljubow in the twentieth, can be played instead; Black may reply with 8...h6, 8...Rb8, or 8...Be7.) White then has a choice of retreats for the knight. The usual move here is 9.Nf3, after which Black obtains some initiative after 9...e4 10.Ne5 Bd6 (see diagram). This is the Knorre Variation, and is considered to be the main line of the Two Knights Defense. After ten moves, White has developed only two pieces against Black&#x27;s three pieces and pawns, but has an extra pawn as well as a better pawn structure. Both 11.d4 and 11.f4 have been tried here with no definitive conclusion. 10...Bc5 is a viable alternative for Black, as is 10...Qc7 (the Goring Variation).

Steinitz favored 9.Nh3 instead, although it did not bring him success in his famous 1891 cable match against Chigorin. The Steinitz Variation was mostly forgotten until Fischer revived it in the 1960s. Nigel Short led a second revival of 9.Nh3 in the 1990s, and today it is thought to be about equal in strength to the more common 9.Nf3. In addition to the moves 8.Be2 and 8.Qf3, the move 8.Bd3 is a valid alternative that has apparently become fashionable in recent years.

====Traxler Variation: 4...Bc5 ====

This bold move ignores White&#x27;s attack on f7 and leads to wild play. Czech problemist Karel Traxler played it against Reinisch in Prague in 1890. Later it was named after Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania by Frank Marshall, who claimed to be first to analyze and publish it, so today 4...Bc5 is known as both the Traxler Variation and (in the United States and the United Kingdom only) the Wilkes-Barre Variation.

White can play 5.d4, 5.Nxf7, or 5.Bxf7+:
* After 5.d4 d5!, White&#x27;s best move is 6.Bxd5, reapplying the pressure on f7.
* 5.Nxf7 is very complicated after 5...Bxf2+. The current main lines all are thought to lead to drawn or equal positions, e.g. after 6.Kxf2 Nxe4+ 7.Kg1, or even 7.Ke3.
* White&#x27;s best try for an advantage is probably 5.Bxf7+ Ke7 6.Bb3 (although 6.Bd5 was the move recommended by Lawrence Trent), as this poses Black the most problems. No grandmasters have regularly adopted the Wilkes-Barre as Black, but Alexander Beliavsky and Alexei Shirov have played it occasionally even in top competition. No clear refutation is known. A tricky variation is 5.Bxf7+ Kf8!?, where Black plays for one last trick with 6.Bb3 d6 7.Nf7 Qe7. If White plays the seemingly standard 8.Nxh8, Black is now winning after 8...Bg4 9.f3 Nxe4, making use of the pinned f3-pawn. This pawn cannot capture the bishop as 10.fxg4?? Qh4+ 11.g3 Bf2+ wins by force for Black.

====4...Nxe4====
4...Nxe4?! is considered unsound but must be handled carefully. 5.Nxe4 d5 poses no problems for Black. If 5.Nxf7? Qh4! 6.g3 (6.0-0 Bc5!) 6...Qh3 7.Nxh8 Qg2 8.Rf1 Nd4 9.Qh5+ g6 10.Nxg6 hxg6 11.Qxg6+ Kd8 and Black has dangerous threats. (Alternatively, after 5.Nxf7? Qh4! 6.g3, Black could play more aggressively 6...Nxg3! 7.fxg3 Qe4+ 8.Qe2 Qxh1+ 9.Qf1 Qxf1+ 10.Kxf1 d5 11.Bxd5 Bh3+ 12.Ke1 Nb4 13.Bb3 Nxc2+ 14.Bxc2 Kxf7 with a distinct advantage of material for Black.)
Correct is 5.Bxf7+! Ke7 6.d4! (6.d3 is also good) and now:
* 6...d5 7.Nc3! (best, discovered by Soviet player Lopukhin; White has a clear advantage) 7...Nxc3 8.bxc3 Qd6 (8...Bf5 9.Qf3; 8...e4 9.f3!) 9.a4! Kd8 10.Bg8! Ke8 11.Bxh7± (Estrin).
* 6...h6 7.Nxe4 Kxf7 and now 8.dxe5 Qe8 9.f4 d6 10.0-0 () Kg8 11.Nbc3 dxe5 12. f5 Qf7 13.Nd5 Bd7 14.f6 g6 15.Ne7+! and White has excellent chances (Estrin).

===4.d4===
White can choose to rapidly with 4.d4 exd4 5.0-0. Now Black can simply by eliminating White&#x27;s last center pawn with 5...Nxe4, after which White regains the with 6.Re1 d5 7.Bxd5 Qxd5 8.Nc3, but Black has a comfortable position after 8...Qa5 or 8...Qh5.

The wild Nakhmanson Gambit 6.Nc3 gives White compensation if Black accepts the piece with 6...dxc3 7.Bxf7+ Kxf7 8.Qd5+ and then makes the intuitive move 8...Ke8?! Instead, 8...Kf6! has been analyzed to offer Black a substantial edge with best play. Victor Bologan suggests declining the gambit with 6...Nxc3 7.bxc3 d5 8.Bb5 Be7 leading to a better position for Black.

Alternatively, Black can enter the extensively analyzed Max Lange Attack after 5...Bc5 6.e5 d5, which can also arise by transposition from the Giuoco Piano or Scotch Game. White can choose to avoid these lines by playing 5.e5, a line often adopted by Sveshnikov. After 5.e5, either 5...Ne4 or 5...Ng4 is a reply, but most common and natural is 5...d5 6.Bb5 Ne4 7.Nxd4 Bc5, with play. The tricky 5.Ng5?! is best met by 5...d5! 6.exd5 Qe7+!

===Modern Bishop&#x27;s Opening: 4.d3 ===
The quiet move 4.d3, the Modern Bishop&#x27;s Opening, transposes into the Giuoco Pianissimo if Black responds 4...Bc5, but there are also independent variations after 4...Be7 or 4...h6. White tries to avoid the tactical battles that are common in other lines of the Two Knights and to enter a more positional game. The resulting positions take on some characteristics of the Ruy Lopez if White plays c3 and retreats the bishop to c2 via Bc4–b3–c2. This move became popular in the 1980s and has been used by John Nunn and others.

===Four Knights Variation: 4.Nc3 ===

The attempt to defend the pawn with 4.Nc3 does not work well since Black can take the pawn anyway and use a fork trick to regain the piece, 4.Nc3?! Nxe4! 5.Nxe4 d5. The try 5.Bxf7+? does not help, as Black has the and a better position after 5...Kxf7 6.Nxe4 d5. Instead, 4.Nc3 is usually played with the intent to gambit the e-pawn with the Boden–Kieseritzky Gambit, 4.Nc3 Nxe4 5.0-0. This gambit is not commonly seen in tournament play as it is not well regarded by opening theory, but it can offer White good practical chances, especially in blitz chess.

==Chess opening theory table==

White must respond to the attack on the e-pawn. (For explanation of notation, see chess opening theory table.)

<text>Heinrich Roth (also known as &quot;Henricus Rodius&quot; or &quot;Henrique Roa&quot;; December 18, 1620 – June 20, 1668) was a missionary and pioneering Sanskrit scholar.

== Life ==
Having been born in Dillingen and raised in Augsburg, where his father Konrad Roth (died 1637) worked as &quot;Doctor utriusque iuris&quot; for the Prince-Bishopric, from 1635 to 1639 Heinrich Roth studied Rhetoric at the University of Dillingen and Philosophy at the Jesuit college in Innsbruck. In 1639, he became a Jesuit in Landsberg, and from 1641 to 1645 taught at the University of Munich, before returning to Dillingen to start theological studies, which he completed in Ingolstadt in 1649. The same year, he was ordained priest in Eichstätt.

On behalf of Francesco Piccolomini, in 1649 Roth was assigned to the so-called Ethiopian mission to India. Traveling by the land route via Smyrna (1650) and Isfahan, he arrived in Goa by 1652. He worked first on the Island of Salsette off Goa, where from time to time he acted as Portuguese interpreter. He was then sent on an embassy by one of the native princes, and via Uttarakhand finally reached the Mughal Empire and its residence in Agra in 1654. Acting as rector of the Jesuit residence in Agra since 1659, he was involved in the persecution under Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb.

Next to learning the Persian, Kannada and Hindustani languages, Roth at Agra for several years also acquired a profound knowledge of classical Sanskrit grammar and literature from local pandits. The French explorer and philosopher Francois Bernier, who got acquainted with Roth in these years, got to appreciate him as one versed in expert knowledge of the culture and philosophy of religions in India

In 1662, joined by fellow Jesuit Johann Grueber, who was on his way back from China, Roth revisited Europe by the land route via Kabul, and arrived in Rome in February 1664. Athanasius Kircher, in his monumental work &quot;China illustrata&quot;, published their itinerary, Roth&#x27;s description of the Sanskrit alphabet, and some short excerpts of Roth&#x27;s other works. Traveling north to Germany, Roth held some public lectures in Neuburg on the history and culture of the Mughal Empire, excerpts of which subsequently appeared in print. In Vienna, Roth succeeded in gaining financial support from emperor Leopold I to have his Sanskrit grammar – the first such work ever compiled by a European, which Roth had completed in Agra by 1660 – appear in print, but the project was stopped by the Jesuit Superior General Giovanni Paolo Oliva.

Ordered by Oliva to set up a Jesuit mission in Nepal, Roth traveled back via Constantinople and Surat, returning to Agra by 1666, where he died in 1668 before he could embark on the Nepalese mission. His gravesite is still visible at the Padri Santos chapel in Lashkarpur, a suburb of Agra.

== Work ==
Heinrich Roth&#x27;s Sanskrit grammar, that he had completed by 1660 in Latin language under the title &quot;Grammatica Linguae Sanscretanae Brachmanum Indiae Orientalis&quot; (the manuscript of which is preserved today at the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Rome) and that was augmented by preliminary studies for a complete Sanskrit-Latin dictionary, made him a pioneering scholar in modern Sanskrit studies in Europe. Further works include studies on the Hindustani and Devanagari alphabets, on Vedanta and on Vishnu. Also, a total of 35 letters, written by Roth from India and during his travel back to Europe, survive at the Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels.

<doc id="497987" wikidata="Q4176108" url="?curid=497987" title="Honshū–Shikoku Bridge Project">
<text>The is a system of bridges connecting the islands of Honshu and Shikoku across the Inland Sea of Japan, which were previously only connected by ferry. It consists of three major connections. All bridges are now controlled by the Honshu-Shikoku Bridge Expressway Company and the . The system consists of three expressways and their respective bridge systems.

==Kobe-Awaji-Naruto Expressway==
The eastern expressway was completed in 1998. Crossing the Akashi Strait, this connection links Hyōgo Prefecture on Honshu with Tokushima Prefecture on Shikoku, using Awaji Island for most of its length. The route connects to the Sanyō Expressway at its northern terminus, allowing traffic to connect to Himeji, Kobe, and other major cities on Honshū.

This connection uses three suspension bridges. The Akashi Kaikyō Bridge was the world&#x27;s longest suspension bridge at the time of its construction in 1998, and connects Kobe to Awaji Island (Awaji, Hyogo). The others are the Ōnaruto Bridge, connecting Awaji to Ōge Island (Naruto, Tokushima) across the Naruto Strait, and the connecting Ōge Island with Shikoku.

Although the connection was initially designed to accommodate railway service as well as road traffic, economic considerations turned it into a road connection only.

==Seto-Chūō Expressway==
The central expressway was completed in 1988. Also known as the Great Seto Bridge, this line connects Okayama Prefecture to Kagawa Prefecture. A series of six major bridges and five viaducts are used. The six bridges are the Shimotsui-Seto Bridge, Hitsuishijima Bridge, the Iwakurojima Bridge, the Yoshima Bridge, the Kita Bisan-Seto Bridge, and the Minami Bisan-Seto Bridge.

The Seto-Chūō bridges are also used by JR trains (Seto-Ōhashi Line), and are designed to accommodate high-speed Shinkansen service in the future, although there are no current plans to extend the Shinkansen to Shikoku.

==Nishiseto Expressway==
The western expressway was completed in 1999. Commonly known as the Shimanami Kaidō, this connection links Hiroshima Prefecture to Ehime Prefecture. The link consists of nine bridges: the Shin-Onomichi Bridge, Innoshima Bridge, Ikuchi Bridge, Tatara Bridge, Ōmishima Bridge, Hakata-Ōshima Bridge, and the three-part Kurushima-Kaikyō Bridge. It is the only route that can be crossed on bicycle or by foot.

<text>The King&#x27;s Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves:
:1. 
:2. 

White offers a pawn to divert the black e-pawn. If Black accepts the gambit, White may play d4 and Bxf4, regaining the gambit pawn with domination, or direct their forces against the weak square f7 with moves such as Nf3, Bc4, 0-0, and g3. A downside to the King&#x27;s Gambit is that it weakens White&#x27;s king&#x27;s position, exposing it to the latent threat of ...Qh4+ (or ), which may force White to give up castling rights.

The King&#x27;s Gambit is one of the oldest documented openings, appearing in the earliest of chess books, Luis Ramírez de Lucena&#x27;s &quot;Repetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez&quot; (1497). It was examined by the 17th-century Italian chess player Giulio Cesare Polerio. The King&#x27;s Gambit was one of the most popular openings until the late 19th century, when improvements in defensive technique led to its decline in popularity. It is infrequently seen at master level today, as Black has several methods to obtain , but is still popular at amateur level.
== History ==
The King&#x27;s Gambit was one of the most popular openings for over 300 years, and has been played by many of the strongest players in many of the greatest , including the Immortal Game. Nevertheless, players have held widely divergent views on it. François-André Danican Philidor (1726–1795), the greatest player and theorist of his day, wrote that the King&#x27;s Gambit should end in a draw with best play by both sides, stating that &quot;a gambit equally well attacked and defended is never a decisive [game], either on one side or the other.&quot; Writing over 150 years later, Siegbert Tarrasch, one of the world&#x27;s strongest players in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, pronounced the opening &quot;a decisive mistake&quot; and wrote that &quot;it is almost madness to play the King&#x27;s Gambit.&quot; Similarly, future world champion Bobby Fischer wrote a famous article, &quot;A Bust to the King&#x27;s Gambit&quot;, in which he stated, &quot;In my opinion the King&#x27;s Gambit is busted. It loses by force&quot; and offered his Fischer Defense (3...d6) as a refutation. FM Graham Burgess, in his book &quot;The Mammoth Book of Chess&quot;, noted the discrepancy between the King&#x27;s Gambit and Wilhelm Steinitz&#x27;s accumulation theory. Steinitz had argued that an attack is only justified when a player has an advantage, and an advantage is only obtainable after the opponent makes a mistake. Since 1...e5 does not look like a blunder, White should therefore not be launching an attack.

While the King&#x27;s Gambit Accepted was a staple of Romantic era chess, the opening began to decline with the development of opening theory and improvements in defensive technique in the late 19th century. By the 1920s, 1.e4 openings declined in popularity with the rise of the hypermodern school, with many players switching to 1.d4 and 1.c4 openings and . After World War II, 1.e4 openings became more popular again, with David Bronstein being the first grandmaster in decades to use the King&#x27;s Gambit in serious play. He inspired Boris Spassky to also take up the King&#x27;s Gambit, although Spassky was not willing to risk using the opening in any of his World Championship matches. Spassky did beat many strong players with it, however, including Bobby Fischer, Zsuzsa Polgar, and a famous against Bronstein himself.

In 2012, an April Fools&#x27; Day prank by Chessbase in association with Vasik Rajlich—author of chess engine Rybka—claimed to have proven to a 99.99999999% certainty that the King&#x27;s Gambit is at best a draw for White, but only after 3.Be2. Revealing the prank, Rajlich admitted that current computer technology is nowhere near solving such a task.

The King&#x27;s Gambit is rare in modern high-level play. The main reason is that it is hard to gain an opening advantage with White against strong opponents, with GM Matthew Sadler once joking that the dream of every King&#x27;s Gambit player is a &quot;worse but holdable ending&quot;. A handful of grandmasters have continued to use it, including Joseph Gallagher, Hikaru Nakamura, Baskaran Adhiban, Nigel Short, and Alexei Fedorov, albeit never as a main weapon.

== King&#x27;s Gambit Accepted: 2...exf4 ==
Although Black usually accepts the gambit pawn, two methods of declining the gambit—the Classical Defense (2...Bc5) and the Falkbeer Countergambit (2...d5)—are also popular. After , the two main continuations for White are 3.Nf3 (King&#x27;s Knight&#x27;s Gambit) and 3.Bc4 (Bishop&#x27;s Gambit).

=== King&#x27;s Knight&#x27;s Gambit: 3.Nf3 ===

This is the most popular move. It develops the knight and prevents 3...Qh4+. Black&#x27;s two main approaches are to attempt to hold on to the pawn with ...g5, or to return the pawn in order to facilitate .

==== Classical Variation: 3...g5 ====
The Classical Variation arises after 3.Nf3 g5. Black defends the f4-pawn, and threatens to kick the f3-knight with ...g4, or else to consolidate with ...Bg7 and ...h6. The main continuations traditionally have been 4.h4 and 4.Bc4. More recently, 4.Nc3 (the Quaade Gambit or Quaade Attack) has been recommended by Scottish grandmaster (GM) John Shaw as a less explored alternative to 4.h4 and superior to 4.Bc4.

===== 4.h4: Kieseritzky Gambit and Allgaier Gambit =====
With 4.h4 White practically forces 4...g4, thereby undermining any attempt by Black to set up a stable pawn chain with ...h6 and ...Bg7.

The Kieseritzky Gambit, 4.h4 g4 5.Ne5, is considered by modern writers such as Shaw and Gallagher to be the main line after 3...g5. It was popularized by Lionel Kieseritzky in the 1840s and used successfully by Wilhelm Steinitz. Boris Spassky used it to beat Bobby Fischer in a famous game at Mar del Plata in 1960. The main line of the Kieseritzky Gambit is considered to be 5...Nf6 (Berlin Defense) 6.Bc4 d5 7.exd5 Bd6 8.d4 Nh5 9.0-0 Qxh4 10.Qe1 Qxe1 11.Rxe1 0-0 12.Bb3 Bf5. The Long Whip Variation, 5...h5?! 6.Bc4 Rh7 (or 6...Nh6) is considered old-fashioned and risky, as Black loses a lot of time attempting to hold on to the pawn.

4.h4 g4 5.Ng5 is the Allgaier Gambit, intending 5...h6 6.Nxf7. This knight sacrifice is considered unsound.

===== 4.Bc4 g4: Muzio Gambit and others =====
The extremely Muzio Gambit arises after 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0 gxf3 6.Qxf3, where White has sacrificed a knight but has three pieces bearing down on f7. Such wild play is rare in modern chess, but Black must defend accurately. Perhaps the sharpest continuation is the Double Muzio after 6...Qf6 7.e5 Qxe5 8.Bxf7+, leaving White two pieces down in eight moves, but with a position that some masters consider to be equal. In practice White&#x27;s play seems to be easier, especially when the opponent is surprised by such daring tactics.

Similar lines are the Ghulam Kassim Gambit, 4.Bc4 g4 5.d4, and the McDonnell Gambit, 4.Bc4 g4 5.Nc3. These are generally considered inferior to the Muzio, which has the advantage of reinforcing White&#x27;s attack along the f-file. Also inferior is the Lolli Gambit 4.Bc4 g4 5.Bxf7+, which leaves White with insufficient compensation for the piece after 5...Kxf7 6.Ne5+ Ke8 7.Qxg4 Nf6 8.Qxf4 d6.

The Salvio Gambit, 4.Bc4 g4 5.Ne5 Qh4+ 6.Kf1, is considered better for Black due to the insecurity of White&#x27;s king. Black may play safely with 6...Nh6 (Silberschmidt Variation), or counter-sacrifice with 6...f3 (Cochrane Gambit) or 6...Nc6 (Viennese Variation).

===== 4.Bc4 Bg7: Hanstein Gambit and Philidor Gambit =====
A safer alternative to 4...g4 is 4...Bg7, which usually leads to the Hanstein Gambit after 5.d4 d6 6.0-0 h6 or the Philidor Gambit after 5.h4 h6 6.d4 d6 (other move orders are possible in both cases).

===== 4.Nc3: Quaade Gambit =====
The Quaade Gambit (3.Nf3 g5 4.Nc3) is named after a Danish amateur who discussed it in correspondence with the &quot;Deutsche Schachzeitung&quot; in the 1880s. The move has received renewed attention following its recommendation by John Shaw in his 2013 book on the King&#x27;s Gambit. A well-known trap here is 4...g4 5.Ne5 Qh4+ 6.g3 fxg3 7.Qxg4 g2+ (7...Qxg4 8.Nxg4 d5 is about equal) 8.Qxh4 gxh1=Q 9.Qh5 and White is close to winning. (Black&#x27;s best defense is considered 9...Nh6 10.d4 d6 11.Bxh6 dxe5 12.Qxe5+ Be6 13.Qxh8 Nd7 14.Bxf8 0-0-0 and White will emerge a clear pawn ahead.) Instead, 4...Bg7 has been recommended. 4...d6 and 4...h6 transpose to Fischer&#x27;s Defense and Becker&#x27;s Defense, respectively. Also possible is 4...Nc6, recommended by Konstantin Sakaev.

After 4...Bg7 5.d4 g4, Simon Williams advocates 6.Bxf4 gxf3 in his DVD and Chess.com video series. White is down a knight, but has a strong attack. The Quaade Gambit has recently been advocated by Daniel King in his PowerPlay series for Chessbase.

===== 4.d4: Rosentreter Gambit =====
This is likely to lead to similar positions to the Quaade Gambit; however, 4...g4 5.Ne5 Qh4+ 6.g3 fxg3 7.Qxg4 g2+!? (7...Qxg4=) is now viable due to the threat against the pawn on e4. After 8.Qxh4 gxh1=Q Shaw recommends 9.Nc3 for White, with a complicated position.

==== Becker Defense: 3...h6 ====
The Becker Defense (3.Nf3 h6), has the idea of creating a on h6, g5, f4 to defend the f4 pawn while avoiding the Kieseritzky Gambit, so Black will not be forced to play ...g4 when White plays to undermine the chain with h4. White has the option of 4.b3, although the main line continues with 4.d4 g5 (&quot;ECO&quot; C37) and usually transposes to lines of the Classical Variation after 5.Bc4 Bg7 6.0-0 (&quot;ECO&quot; C38).

==== Bonch-Osmolovsky Defense: 3...Ne7 ====
The rarely seen Bonch-Osmolovsky Defense (3.Nf3 Ne7) aims to defend the f4-pawn with ...Ng6, a relatively safe square for the knight compared to the Schallopp Defense. It was played by Mark Bluvshtein to defeat former world title finalist Nigel Short at Montreal 2007, even though it has never been highly regarded by theory.

==== Cunningham Defense: 3...Be7 ====

The Cunningham Defense (3.Nf3 Be7) threatens a check on h4 that can permanently prevent White from castling; furthermore, if White does not immediately develop the king&#x27;s bishop, Ke2 would be forced, which hems the bishop in. A sample line is 4.Nc3 Bh4+ 5.Ke2 d5 6.Nxd5 Nf6 7.Nxf6+ Qxf6 8.d4 Bg4 9.Qd2 (). White has strong central control with pawns on d4 and e4, while Black is relying on the white king&#x27;s discomfort to compensate.

To avoid having to play Ke2, 4.Bc4 is White&#x27;s most popular response. Black can play 4...Bh4+ anyway, forcing 5.Kf1 (or else the wild Bertin Gambit or Three Pawns&#x27; Gambit, 5.g3 fxg3 6.0-0 gxh2+ 7.Kh1, played in the nineteenth century). In modern practice, it is more common for Black to simply develop instead with 4...Nf6 5.e5 Ng4, known as the Modern Cunningham. An under-explored but seemingly playable line here is 5...Ne4!?, the Euwe Variation, which has a number of trappy ideas.

==== Schallopp Defense: 3...Nf6 ====
The Schallopp Defense (3.Nf3 Nf6) is usually played with the intention of holding on to the pawn after 4.e5 Nh5. While it is not Black&#x27;s most popular option, it attracted some attention in 2020 when Ding Liren used it to beat Magnus Carlsen in the online Magnus Carlsen Invitational tournament. The undefended knight on h5 means Black must be careful: for example 4.e5 Nh5 5.d4 d6 6.Qe2 Be7? (correct is 6...d5!=) 7.exd6 Qxd6 8.Qb5+ wins the h5-knight.

==== Modern Defense: 3...d5 ====
The Modern Defense, or Abbazia Defense, (3.Nf3 d5) has much the same idea as the Falkbeer Countergambit, and can in fact be reached via transposition, i.e. 2...d5 3.exd5 exf4 4.Nf3. Black concentrates on gaining piece play and fighting for the initiative rather than keeping the extra pawn. It has been recommended by several publications as an easy way to equalize, although White&#x27;s extra central pawn and piece activity gives a slight advantage. If White captures (4.exd5) then Black may play 4...Nf6 or recapture with 4...Qxd5, at which point it becomes the Scandinavian Variation of . This variation was considered most critical in the past, but recent trends seem to indicate a slight advantage for White.

==== Fischer Defense: 3...d6 ====

&quot;The refutation of any gambit begins with accepting it. In my opinion the King&#x27;s Gambit is busted. It loses by force.&quot; — R. Fischer, &quot;A Bust to the King&#x27;s Gambit&quot;

The Fischer Defense (3.Nf3 d6), although previously known, was advocated by Bobby Fischer after he was defeated by Boris Spassky in a Kieseritzky Gambit at the 1960 Mar del Plata tournament. Fischer then decided to refute the King&#x27;s Gambit, and the next year the &quot;American Chess Quarterly&quot; published his analysis of 3...d6, which he called &quot;a high-class waiting move&quot;.
The point is that after 4.d4 g5 5.h4 g4 White cannot continue with 6.Ne5 as in the Kieseritzky Gambit, 6.Ng5 is unsound because of 6...f6 trapping the knight, and 6.Nfd2 blocks the bishop on c1. This leaves the move 6.Ng1 as the only option, when after six moves neither side has developed a piece. The resulting slightly odd position () offers White good attacking chances. A typical continuation is 6.Ng1 Bh6 7.Ne2 Qf6 8.Nbc3 c6 9.g3 f3 10.Nf4 Qe7 with an unclear position (Korchnoi/Zak).

The main alternative to 4.d4 is 4.Bc4. Play usually continues 4...h6 5.d4 g5 6.0-0 Bg7, transposing into the Hanstein Gambit, which can also be reached via 3...g5 or 3...h6.

==== MacLeod Defense: 3...Nc6 ====
The MacLeod Defense, 3...Nc6, is named after Nicholas MacLeod. Joe Gallagher writes that 3.Nf3 Nc6 &quot;has never really caught on, probably because it does nothing to address Black&#x27;s immediate problems.&quot; Like Fischer&#x27;s Defense, it is a . An obvious drawback is that the knight on c6 may prove a target for the d-pawn later in the opening.

==== Wagenbach Defense: 3...h5 ====
An invention of the Hungarian/English player, János Wagenbach. John Shaw writes: &quot;If given the time, Black intends to seal up the kingside with ...h4 followed by ...g5, securing the extra pawn on f4 without allowing an undermining h2–h4. The drawback is of course the amount of time required&quot;.

=== Bishop&#x27;s Gambit: 3.Bc4 ===
Of the alternatives to 3.Nf3, the most important is the Bishop&#x27;s Gambit, 3.Bc4. White allows 3...Qh4+ 4.Kf1, losing the right to castle, but this loses time for Black after the inevitable Nf3 and White will develop rapidly. White also has the option of delaying Nf3, however, and can instead play g3, after which the game becomes quite sharp, with White having the option of Qf3 with an attack on f7, or Kg2 threatening hxg3. This idea is advocated, among others, by GM Simon Williams.

Korchnoi and Zak recommend as best for Black 3...Nf6 4.Nc3 c6, or the alternative move order 3...c6 4.Nc3 Nf6. After 5.Bb3 d5 6.exd5 cxd5 7.d4 Bd6 8.Nge2 0-0 9.0-0 g5 10.Nxd5 Nc6, Black was somewhat better in Spielmann–Bogoljubow, Märisch Ostrau 1923.

Black&#x27;s other main option is 3...d5, returning the pawn immediately. Play might continue 3...d5 4.Bxd5 Nf6 5.Nc3 Bb4 6.Nf3 Bxc3 7.dxc3 c6 8.Bc4 Qxd1+ 9.Kxd1 0-0 10.Bxf4 Nxe4 with an equal position (Bilguer Handbuch, Korchnoi/Zak).

3...Nc6!?, Maurian Defense, is relatively untested, but if White plays 4.Nf3 Black can transpose into the Hanstein Gambit after 4...g5 5.d4 Bg7 6.c3 d6 7.0-0 h6 (Neil McDonald, 1998). John Shaw wrote that 3...Nc6 is a &quot;refutation&quot; of the Bishop&#x27;s Gambit, as he says that Black is better in all variations.

Steinitz&#x27;s 3...Ne7 and the 3...f5 (best met by 4.Qe2!) are generally considered inferior.

=== Other 3rd moves for White ===
Other 3rd moves for White are rarely played. Some of these are:
* 3.Nc3 (Mason Gambit or Keres Gambit)
* 3.d4 (Villemson Gambit or Steinitz Gambit)
* 3.Be2 (Lesser Bishop&#x27;s Gambit or Tartakower Gambit)
* 3.Qf3 (Breyer Gambit or Hungarian Gambit)
* 3.Qe2 (Basman Gambit)
* 3.g3 (Gama Gambit)
* 3.h4 (Stamma Gambit)
* 3.Nh3 (Eisenberg Gambit)
* 3.Kf2?! (The Tumbleweed)

== King&#x27;s Gambit Declined ==
Black can decline the offered pawn, or offer a .

=== Falkbeer Countergambit: 2...d5 ===

The Falkbeer Countergambit is named after the 19th-century Austrian master Ernst Falkbeer. It runs 1.e4 e5 2.f4 d5 3.exd5 e4, in which Black sacrifices a pawn in return for quick and easy development. It was once considered good for Black and scored well, but White obtains some advantage with the response 4.d3!, and the line fell out of favor after the 1930s.

A more modern interpretation of the Falkbeer is 2...d5 3.exd5 c6!?, as advocated by Aron Nimzowitsch. Black is not concerned about pawns and aims for early piece activity. White has a better pawn structure and prospects of a better endgame. The main line continues 4.Nc3 exf4 5.Nf3 Bd6 6.d4 Ne7 7.dxc6 Nbxc6, giving positions analogous to the Modern Variation of the gambit accepted.

=== Classical Defense: 2...Bc5 ===
A common way to decline the gambit is with 2...Bc5, the &quot;classical&quot; . The bishop prevents White from castling and is such a nuisance that White often expends two tempi to eliminate it by means of Nc3–a4, to exchange on c5 or b6, after which White may castle without worry. It also contains an opening trap for novices: if White continues with 3.fxe5 Black continues 3...Qh4+, in which either the rook is lost (4.g3 Qxe4+, forking the rook and king) or White is checkmated (4.Ke2 Qxe4#). This line often comes about by transposition from lines of the Vienna Game or Bishop&#x27;s Opening, when White plays f2–f4 before Nf3.

One rarely seen line is the Rotlewi Countergambit: 3.Nf3 d6 4.b4. The idea of the gambit is similar to that seen in the Evans Gambit of the Italian Game. White sacrifices a pawn to try to build a strong center with 4...Bxb4 5.c3 Bc5 (or 5...Ba5) 6.fxe5 dxe5 7.d4. This line is considered slightly dubious, however.

=== Other 2nd moves for Black ===
Other options in the KGD are possible, though unusual, such as the Adelaide Countergambit 2...Nc6 3.Nf3 f5, advocated by Tony Miles; 2...d6, which is the way the King’s Gambit was declined the first known time it was played, when after 3.Nf3, best is 3...exf4 transposing to the Fischer Defense (though 2...d6 invites White to play 3.d4 instead); and 2...Nf6 3.fxe5 Nxe4 4.Nf3 Ng5! 5.d4 Nxf3+ 6.Qxf3 Qh4+ 7.Qf2 Qxf2+ 8.Kxf2 with a small endgame advantage, as played in the 1968 game between Bobby Fischer and Bob Wade in Vinkovci. The greedy 2...Qf6 (known as the Nordwalde Variation), intending 3...Qxf4, is considered dubious. Also dubious are the Keene Defense: 2...Qh4+ 3.g3 Qe7 and the Mafia Defense: 1.e4 e5 2.f4 c5.

2...f5 is among the oldest countergambits in KGD, known from a game published in 1625 by Gioachino Greco. Vincenz Hruby also played it against Mikhail Chigorin in 1882. It is nonetheless considered dubious because 3.exf5 with the threat of Qh5+ gives White a good game. The variation is sometimes named the Pantelidakis Countergambit because GM Larry Evans answered a question from Peter Pantelidakis of Chicago about it in one of his columns in &quot;Chess Life and Review&quot;.

In several lines of the Vienna Game White offers a sort of delayed King&#x27;s Gambit. In the Vienna Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.f4), Black should reply 3...d5, since 3...exf4 4.e5 forces the knight to retreat. 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4 exf4 may lead to the Hamppe–Muzio Gambit after 4.Nf3 g5 5.Bc4 g4 6.0-0 gxf3 7.Qxf3, or to the Steinitz Gambit after 4.d4 Qh4+ 5.Ke2. Both of these lines may be reached via the King&#x27;s Gambit proper, but the Vienna move order is more common.

White may also offer the gambit in the Bishop&#x27;s Opening, e.g. 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Nc6 3.f4, though this is uncommon.

<doc id="497994" wikidata="Q188566" url="?curid=497994" title="Sicilian Defence">
<text>The Sicilian Defence is a chess opening that begins with the following moves:
:1. 

The Sicilian is the most popular and best-scoring response to White&#x27;s first move 1.e4. The opening 1.d4 is a statistically more successful opening for White because of the high success rate of the Sicilian defence against 1.e4. &quot;New In Chess&quot; stated in its 2000 Yearbook that, of the games in its database, White scored 56.1% in 296,200 games beginning 1.d4, but 54.1% in 349,855 games beginning 1.e4, mainly because the Sicilian held White to a 52.3% score in 145,996 games.

17% of all games between grandmasters, and 25% of the games in the Chess Informant database, begin with the Sicilian.

Grandmaster John Nunn attributes the Sicilian Defence&#x27;s popularity to its &quot;combative nature&quot;: &quot;in many lines Black is playing not just for equality, but for the advantage. The drawback is that White often obtains an early initiative, so Black has to take care not to fall victim to a quick attack.&quot; Grandmaster Jonathan Rowson considered why the Sicilian is the most successful response to 1.e4, even though 1...c5 develops no pieces and the pawn on c5 controls only d4 and b4. Rowson writes:

The earliest recorded notes on the Sicilian Defence date back to the late 16th century by the Italian chess players Giulio Polerio and Gioachino Greco.
== General concepts ==
By advancing the c-pawn two squares, Black asserts control over the d4-square and begins the fight for the . The move resembles 1…e5, the next most common response to 1.e4, in that respect. Unlike 1...e5, however, 1...c5 breaks the of the position, which strongly influences both players&#x27; future actions. White, having pushed a pawn, tends to hold the initiative on that side of the board. However, 1...c5 does little for Black&#x27;s , unlike moves such as 1...e5, 1...g6, or 1...Nc6, which either develop a minor piece or prepare to do so. In many variations of the Sicilian, Black makes a number of further pawn moves in the opening (for example, ...d6, ...e6, ...a6, and ...b5). Consequently, White often obtains a substantial lead in development and dangerous attacking chances.

Meanwhile, advancing a pawn has given Black a there and provides a basis for future operations on that flank. Often, Black&#x27;s c5-pawn is traded for White&#x27;s d4-pawn in the early stages of the game, granting Black a central . The pawn trade also opens the c- for Black, who can place a rook or queen on that file to support the queenside . In many variations, White castles queenside to exploit attacking chances on the kingside at the cost of moving his king to the flank where Black has a spatial advantage.

== History ==
The Sicilian Defence was analysed by Giulio Polerio in his 1594 manuscript on chess, though he did not use the term &#x27;Sicilian Defence&#x27;. It was later the subject of analyses by leading players of the day Alessandro Salvio (1604), Don Pietro Carrera (c. 1617), and Gioachino Greco (1623), and later Conte Carlo Francesco Cozio (c. 1740). The great French player and theoretician André Danican Philidor opined of the Sicilian in 1777, &quot;This way of opening the game ... is absolutely defensive, and very far from being the best ... but it is a very good one to try the strength of an adversary with whose skill you are unacquainted.&quot;

In 1813, the English master Jacob Henry Sarratt effectively standardised his English translation of the name of this opening as &#x27;the Sicilian Defence&#x27;, referring to an old Italian manuscript that used the phrase (&#x27;the Sicilian game&#x27;). The Sicilian was fairly popular for much of the nineteenth century; Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais, Adolf Anderssen, Howard Staunton, Louis Paulsen, and Carl Jaenisch all played it with some consistency. In the ninth edition of &quot;Modern Chess Openings&quot;, Walter Korn noted that the Sicilian &quot;received three of its earliest practical tests, and a big boost in popularity, in the 1834 La Bourdonnais – McDonnell chess matches, 1843 Staunton–St. Amant match, and the London 1851 chess tournament.&quot; Staunton wrote of the Sicilian, &quot;In the opinion of Jaenisch and the German &quot;Handbuch&quot;, with which I coincide, this is the best possible reply to 1.P-K4, [1.e4 in algebraic notation] &#x27;as it renders the formation of a centre impracticable for White and prevents every attack&#x27;.&quot;

The opening fell out of favour in the later part of the nineteenth century, when some of the world&#x27;s leading players rejected it. Paul Morphy, the world&#x27;s best player in the late 1850s, decried &quot;that pernicious fondness for the Sicilian Defense ... extending from about 1843 to some time after 1851&quot;. Wilhelm Steinitz, the first World Champion, also disliked the Sicilian and rejected it in favour of 1...e5. The death of the opening&#x27;s two greatest proponents, Staunton and Anderssen, in 1874 and 1879 respectively, also contributed to its decline. It has been said that &quot;these losses almost dealt a knockout blow to the Sicilian because it took a long time to find such important figures to carry the Sicilian&#x27;s standard.&quot; George H. D. Gossip, in &quot;The Chess Player&#x27;s Manual&quot;, first published in 1874, wrote, &quot;Of late years ... discoveries have been made which have the effect of considerably strengthening White&#x27;s attack, and the &#x27;Sicilian&#x27; is now considered by most modern authorities to be a comparatively weak mode of play.&quot; Freeborough and Ranken, in their treatise &quot;Chess Openings: Ancient and Modern&quot; (1889, 1896), wrote that the Sicilian &quot;had at one time the reputation of being the best reply to 1.P-K4 [1. e4], but this has not been confirmed by popular practice. Several eminent players have, however, held to the opinion that it is quite trustworthy.&quot;

The Sicilian continued to be shunned by most leading players at the start of the twentieth century, as 1...e5 held centre stage. José Raúl Capablanca, the World Champion from 1921 to 1927, famously denounced it as an opening where &quot;Black&#x27;s game is full of holes&quot;. Similarly, James Mason wrote, &quot;Fairly tried and found wanting, the Sicilian has now scarcely any standing as a first-class defence. ... [It] is too defensive. There are too many holes created in the Pawn line. Command of the field, especially in the centre, is too readily given over to the invading force.&quot; Siegbert Tarrasch wrote that 1...c5 &quot;is certainly not strictly correct, for it does nothing toward development and merely attempts to render difficult the building up of a centre by the first player. ... The Sicilian Defence is excellent for a strong player who is prepared to take risks to force a win against an inferior opponent. Against best play, however, it is bound to fail.&quot; The Sicilian was not seen even once in the 75 games played at the great St. Petersburg 1914 tournament.

Nonetheless, some leading players, such as Emanuel Lasker (World Champion from 1894 to 1921), Frank Marshall, Savielly Tartakower, and Aron Nimzowitsch, and later Max Euwe (World Champion from 1935 to 1937) played the Sicilian. Even Capablanca and Tarrasch, despite their critical comments, occasionally played the opening. It was played six times (out of 110 games) at New York 1924. The following year, the authors of &quot;Modern Chess Openings&quot; (4th edition) wrote, &quot;The Sicilian has claims to be considered as the best of the irregular defences to 1.P-K4 at Black&#x27;s disposal, and has been practised with satisfactory results by the leading players of the day.&quot; In this period Black&#x27;s approach was usually slow and positional, and the all-out attacks by White that became common after World War II had not yet been developed.

The fortunes of the Sicilian were further revived in the 1940s and 1950s by players such as Isaac Boleslavsky, Alexander Kotov, and Miguel Najdorf. Reuben Fine, one of the world&#x27;s leading players during this time period, wrote of the Sicilian in 1948, &quot;Black gives up control of the centre, neglects his development, and often submits to horribly cramped positions. How can it be good? Yet, the brilliant wins by White are matched by equally brilliant wins by Black; time and again the Black structure has been able to take everything and come back for more.&quot;
Later, Bent Larsen, Ljubomir Ljubojević, Lev Polugaevsky, Leonid Stein, Mark Taimanov, and Mikhail Tal all made extensive contributions to the theory and practice of the defence. Through the efforts of world champions Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov, the Sicilian Defence became recognised as the defence that offered Black the most winning chances against 1.e4. Both players favoured sharp, aggressive play and employed the Sicilian almost exclusively throughout their careers, burnishing the defence&#x27;s present reputation. Today, most leading grandmasters include the Sicilian in their opening repertoire. In 1990, the authors of &quot;Modern Chess Openings&quot; (13th edition) noted that &quot;in the twentieth century the Sicilian has become the most played and most analysed opening at both the club and master levels.&quot; In 1965, in the tenth edition of that book, grandmaster Larry Evans observed that &quot;The Sicilian is Black&#x27;s most dynamic, asymmetrical reply to 1.P-K4. It produces the psychological and tension factors which denote the best in modern play and gives notice of a fierce fight on the very first move.&quot;

== Open Sicilian: 2.Nf3 and 3.d4 ==
About 80% of Master-level games beginning 1.e4 c5 continue with 2.Nf3, after which there are three main options for Black: 2...d6, 2...Nc6, and 2...e6. Lines where White then plays 3.d4 are collectively known as the Open Sicilian, and result in , extremely complex positions. White has a lead in development and extra kingside space, which White can use to begin a kingside attack. This is counterbalanced by Black&#x27;s central pawn majority, created by the trade of White&#x27;s d-pawn for Black&#x27;s c-pawn, and the open c-file, which Black uses to generate queenside counterplay and even a queenside attack if White decides to castle there.



=== 2...d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 ===

Black&#x27;s most common move after 2.Nf3 is 2...d6 which prepares ...Nf6 to attack the e-pawn without letting White push it to e5. The game usually continues 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3. Black can then choose between four major variations: the Najdorf (5...a6), Dragon (5...g6), Classical (5...Nc6), and Scheveningen (5...e6). The rare Kupreichik Variation (5...Bd7) may transpose to one of the more common variations such as the Classical or Dragon, but it may also lead to a number of independent lines.

There are a few ways for either side to deviate from the sequence in the heading. After 3...cxd4, White occasionally plays 4.Qxd4, the Chekhover Variation, intending to meet 4...Nc6 with 5.Bb5 Bd7 6.Bxc6, when White hopes that the lead in development compensates for Black&#x27;s bishop pair. Another unusual sideline is 3...cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.f3!?, the Prins Variation, which by delaying Nc3 maintains the option of setting up a Maróczy Bind formation with a later c2-c4. Black can avoid the Prins Variation by playing 3...Nf6, when 4.Nc3 cxd4 5.Nxd4 transposes to main lines. However, 3...Nf6 gives White an extra option in 4.dxc5!?, when Black can play either 4...Nxe4 or 4...Qa5+. White could also protect the pawn on e4 with 5.Bd3 which also allows the option of setting up a Maróczy Bind formation with a later c2-c4, or interpose a check with 5.Bb5+ Nbd7 6.Bd3 or 5.Bb5+ Bd7 6.Bxd7+ Nbxd7.

==== Najdorf Variation: 5...a6 ====
The Najdorf Variation is Black&#x27;s most popular system in the Sicilian Defence. Najdorf&#x27;s intention with 5...a6 was to prepare ...e5 on the next move to gain space in the centre. The immediate 5...e5?! is met by 6.Bb5+!, when Black must either play 6...Bd7 or 6...Nbd7. The former allows White to exchange off Black&#x27;s light-squared bishop, after which the d5-square becomes very weak; but the latter allows 7.Nf5, when Black can only save the d-pawn by playing the awkward 7...a6 8.Bxd7+ Qxd7. In both cases, White&#x27;s game is preferable.

Thus, by playing 5...a6, Black deprives White of the check on b5, so that ...e5 might be possible next move. In general, 5...a6 also prevents White&#x27;s knights from using the b5-square, and helps Black create queenside play by preparing the ...b5 pawn push. This plan of 5...a6 followed by ...e5 represents Black&#x27;s traditional approach in the Najdorf Variation. Later, Garry Kasparov also adopted the 5...a6 move order, but with the idea of playing ...e6 rather than ...e5. Kasparov&#x27;s point is that the immediate 5...e6 (the Scheveningen Variation, discussed below) allows 6.g4, which is White&#x27;s most dangerous line against the Scheveningen. By playing 5...a6 first, Black temporarily prevents White&#x27;s g4 thrust and waits to see what White plays instead. Often, play will eventually transpose to the Scheveningen Variation.

Currently, White&#x27;s most popular weapon against the Najdorf is 6.Be3. This is called the English Attack, because it was popularized by English grandmasters Murray Chandler, John Nunn and Nigel Short in the 1980s. White&#x27;s idea is to play f3, Qd2, 0-0-0 and g4 in some order. Black can respond with 6...e6, 6...e5 or 6...Ng4. A related attacking idea for White is 6.Be3 e6 7.g4, known as the Hungarian Attack or Perenyi Attack.

The most popular response from Black after 6.Be3 is 6...e5, seizing quick initiative by threatening the d4-knight. From here, the white knight has two sensible retreats:
a) 7.Nb3, the more popular approach, is met with 7...Be6, and Black develops normally (...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...Rc8, ...Qc7, ...0-0, ...b5). 
b) 7.Nf3 is less common as it delays the possibility of a kingside pawn storm, via f4 and f3 (supporting the advance of g4). Black meets 7.Nf3 with 7...Be7 8.Bc4 0-0 9.0-0 Be6 10.Bb3 Qc7, where he has achieved a comfortable position.

Formerly, 6.Bg5 e6 7.f4 was the main line of the Najdorf, when White threatens to attack the knight with 8.e5. Black can simply break the pin with 7...Be7, when White usually plays 8.Qf3 and 9.0-0-0. Some of Black&#x27;s alternatives are 7...Qb6, the Poisoned Pawn Variation popularized by Fischer, Gelfand&#x27;s 7...Nbd7, and 7...b5, the Polugaevsky Variation, which has the tactical point 8.e5 dxe5 9.fxe5 Qc7! 10.exf6 Qe5+ winning the bishop in return for the knight. A modern alternative to 6...e6 is 6...Nbd7.

White has other choices on the sixth move. 6.Be2 prepares to castle kingside and is a quieter alternative compared to 6.Be3 and 6.Bg5. Efim Geller was an early proponent of this move, after which Black can stay in &quot;pure&quot; Najdorf territory with 6...e5 or transpose to the Scheveningen with 6...e6. Other possibilities for White include 6.Bc4 (the Fischer–Sozin Attack), 6.f4, 6.f3, 6.g3, and 6.h3 (the Adams Attack, named after Weaver Adams), which was used several times by Bobby Fischer.

==== Dragon Variation: 5...g6 ====
In the Dragon Variation, Black fianchettoes a bishop on the h8–a1 diagonal. It was named by Fyodor Dus-Chotimirsky in 1901, who noticed a resemblance between Black&#x27;s kingside pawn structure (pawns on d6, e7, f7, g6 and h7) and the stars of the Draco constellation. White&#x27;s most dangerous try against the Dragon is the Yugoslav Attack, characterised by 6.Be3 Bg7 7.f3 0-0 8.Qd2 Nc6, when 9.0-0-0, 9.Bc4 and 9.g4 are White&#x27;s most common moves. This variation leads to extremely sharp play and is ferociously complicated, since the players castle on opposite wings and the game becomes a race between White&#x27;s kingside attack and Black&#x27;s queenside counterattack. White&#x27;s most important alternative to the Yugoslav Attack is 6.Be2, the Classical Variation of the Dragon which leads to a less ferocious game.
==== Classical Variation: 5...Nc6 ====

This variation can arise from two different move orders: 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6, or 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 d6. Unlike the other major variations considered in this section, Black defers the development of the king&#x27;s bishop in favour of bringing out the queen&#x27;s knight.

White&#x27;s most common reply is 6.Bg5, the Richter–Rauzer Attack (&quot;ECO&quot; codes B60–B69). The move 6.Bg5 was Kurt Richter&#x27;s invention, threatening to double Black&#x27;s pawns after Bxf6 and forestalling the Dragon by rendering 6...g6 unplayable. After 6...e6, Vsevolod Rauzer introduced the modern plan of Qd2 and 0-0-0 in the 1930s. White&#x27;s pressure on the d6-pawn often compels Black to respond to Bxf6 with ...gxf6, rather than recapturing with a piece (e.g. the queen on d8) that also has to defend the d-pawn. This weakens Black&#x27;s kingside pawn structure, but in return Black gains the two bishops and a central pawn majority.

Another variation is 6.Bc4, the Sozin Variation (&quot;ECO&quot; code B57). It brings the bishop to an aggressive square. Black usually plays 6...e6 (&quot;ECO&quot; B88 transposed) to limit the range of White&#x27;s bishop, but White can eventually put pressure on the e6-pawn by pushing the f-pawn to f5 (pawn-based attack beginning with f4). White can either castle kingside with 7.Bb3 a6 8.0-0 (the Fischer–Sozin Attack, named after Bobby Fischer and Russian master Veniamin Sozin, who originated it in the 1930s), or queenside with 7.Be3 Be7 (or 7...a6) 8.Qe2 and 9.0-0-0 (the Velimirović Attack). Instead of 6...e6, Black can also try Benko&#x27;s move 6...Qb6, which forces White to make a decision over the d4-knight. This typically leads into more positional lines than the razor-sharp, highly theoretical Sozin and Velimirović variations.

White&#x27;s third most common move is 6.Be2, (&quot;ECO&quot; codes B58–B59), after which Black can remain in independent variations with the Boleslavsky Variation 6...e5, named after Isaac Boleslavsky. The old main line 7.Nb3 is now less popular than the modern 7.Nf3, after which the game usually continues 7...h6 8.0-0 Be7 9.Re1 0-0 10.h3. Black can also transpose to the Scheveningen Variation with 6...e6; or to the Classical Variation of the Dragon with 6...g6. Other responses by White to the Classical include 6.Be3, 6.f3, and 6.g3.

==== Scheveningen Variation: 5...e6 ====
In the Scheveningen Variation, Black is content to place the e-pawn on e6, where it guards the d5-square, rather than play the space-gaining ...e5. Moving the e-pawn also prepares ...Be7 followed by kingside castling. In view of this, Paul Keres introduced 6.g4, the Keres Attack, in 1943. White intends to drive away the black knight with g5. If Black prevents this with 6...h6, which is the most common answer, White has gained kingside space and discouraged Black from castling on that side, and may later play Bg2. If the complications after 6.g4 are not to White&#x27;s taste, a major alternative is 6.Be2, a typical line being 6...a6 (this position can be reached from the Najdorf via 5...a6 6.Be2 e6) 7.0-0 Be7 8.f4 0-0. 6.Be3 and 6.f4 are also common.

While theory indicates that Black can hold the balance in the Keres Attack, players today often prefer to avoid it by playing 5...a6 first, an idea popularized by Kasparov. However, if determined to play the g4 thrust, White can prepare it by responding to 5...a6 with 6.h3 or 6.Rg1.
=== 2...Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 ===

2...Nc6 is a natural developing move and also prepares ...Nf6 (like 2...d6, Black stops White from replying e5). After 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4, Black&#x27;s most common move is 4...Nf6. Other important moves are 4...e6 (transposing to the Taimanov Variation), 4...g6 (the Accelerated Dragon) and 4...e5 (the Kalashnikov Variation). Less common choices include 4...Qc7, which may later transpose to the Taimanov Variation, 4...Qb6, the Grivas Variation, and 4...d6.

After 4...Nf6, White usually replies 5.Nc3. Black can play 5...d6, transposing to the Classical Variation; 5...e5, the Sveshnikov Variation; or 5...e6, transposing to the Four Knights Variation.

==== Sveshnikov Variation: 4...Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 ====

The Sveshnikov Variation was pioneered by Evgeny Sveshnikov and in the 1970s. Before their efforts, the variation was called the Lasker–Pelikan Variation. Emanuel Lasker played it once in his world championship match against Carl Schlechter, and Jorge Pelikan played it a few times in the 1950s, but Sveshnikov&#x27;s treatment of the variation was the key to its revitalization. The move 5...e5 seems anti-positional as it leaves Black with a backwards d-pawn and a weakness on d5. Also, Black would have to accept the doubled f-pawns in the main line of the opening. The opening was popularised when Sveshnikov saw its dynamic potential for Black in the 1970s and 80s. Today, it is extremely popular among grandmasters and amateurs alike. Though some lines still give Black trouble, it has been established as a first-rate defence. The main line after 5...e5 runs as follows:

6. Ndb5
:The theoretically critical move, threatening Nd6+. All other moves are considered to allow Black easy equality. 6.Nxc6?! is usually met by 6...bxc6, when Black&#x27;s extra pawn in the centre gives good play; alternatively, even 6...dxc6 7.Qxd8+ Kxd8 is sufficient for equality. 6.Nb3 and 6.Nf3 can be well met by 6...Bb4, threatening to win White&#x27;s pawn on e4. 6.Nf5 allows 6...d5! 7.exd5 Bxf5 8.dxc6 bxc6 9.Qf3 Qd7. 6.Nde2 can be met by either 6...Bc5 or 6...Bb4.

6...d6
:Black does not allow 7.Nd6+ Bxd6 8.Qxd6, when White&#x27;s pair of bishops give them the advantage.

7. Bg5
:White gets ready to eliminate the knight on f6, further weakening Black&#x27;s control over the d5-square. A less common alternative is 7.Nd5 Nxd5 8.exd5 Nb8 (or 8...Ne7), when White will try to exploit the queenside pawn majority, while Black will seek counterplay on the kingside.

7...a6
:Black forces White&#x27;s knight back to a3.

8. Na3
:The immediate 8.Bxf6 forces 8...gxf6, when after 9.Na3, Black can transpose into the main line with 9...b5 or deviate with 9...f5!?

8...b5!
:8...b5 was Sveshnikov&#x27;s innovation, controlling c4 and threatening ...b4 forking White&#x27;s knights. Previously, Black played 8...Be6 (the Bird Variation), which allowed the a3-knight to return to life with 9.Nc4. The entire variation up to 8...b5 is referred to as the Chelyabinsk Variation. It can also be reached from the alternate move order 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Ndb5 d6 7.Bf4 e5 8.Bg5 a6 9.Na3 b5, which is one move longer. (That alternative move order gives White other alternatives, including 6.Nxc6 bxc6 7.e5 Nd5 8.Ne4, intending c4, and the gambit 6.Be2 Bb4 7.0-0!?, allowing ...Bxc3 8.bxc3 Nxe4.) The move numbers in the following discussion are based on the move order given in bold.

The Sveshnikov Variation has become very popular in master level chess. Black&#x27;s ...e5 push seems anti-positional: it has made the d6-pawn backward and the d5-square weak. However, in return, Black gets a foothold in the centre and gains time on White&#x27;s knight, which has been driven to the edge of the board on a3. Top players who have used this variation include Magnus Carlsen, Vladimir Kramnik, Veselin Topalov, Teimour Radjabov, Boris Gelfand, Michael Adams and Alexander Khalifman, among many others.

In the diagrammed position after 8...b5, White usually parries the threat of ...b4 by playing 9.Bxf6 or 9.Nd5. After 9.Bxf6, 9...Qxf6?! 10.Nd5 Qd8 fails to 11.c4 b4 (11...bxc4 12.Nxc4 is good for White, who threatens 13.Qa4) 12.Qa4 Bd7 13.Nb5! axb5 14.Qxa8 Qxa8 15.Nc7+ Kd8 16.Nxa8 and the knight escapes via b6. Thus 9...gxf6 is forced, and White continues 10.Nd5. White&#x27;s powerful knight on d5 and Black&#x27;s shattered kingside pawn structure are compensated by Black&#x27;s bishop pair and White&#x27;s offside knight on a3. Also, Black has the plan of playing 10...f5, followed by ...fxe4 and ...f5 with the second f-pawn, which would give them good control of the centre. An alternative plan is to play 10...Bg7 followed by ...Ne7 to immediately trade off White&#x27;s powerful knight; this line is known as the Novosibirsk Variation.

Instead of 9.Bxf6, White can also play 9.Nd5, which usually leads to quieter play. White decides not to double Black&#x27;s f-pawns and the game often continues 9...Be7 10.Bxf6 Bxf6 11.c3. This allows White to maintain the knight on d5 by trading off Black&#x27;s knight on f6, and prepares to bring the knight on a3 back into play with the manoeuvre Na3–c2–e3. Another line is 10.Nxe7 Nxe7! (fighting for control of d5 and not fearing the doubled pawns) 11.Bxf6 gxf6. However, a recent development in the Sveshnikov has been 11.c4 (instead of c3), which often leads to positions where White is pressing for the win at no risk. A quick draw is possible after 9.Nd5 Qa5+!? 10.Bd2 (in order to prevent 10...Nxe4) 10...Qd8 11.Bg5 Qa5+ etc. In order to avoid this, White can play 11.Nxf6+ or 11.c4.

==== Accelerated Dragon: 4...g6 ====
Like the standard Dragon Variation, Black develops the bishop to g7 in the Accelerated Dragon. The difference is that Black avoids playing ...d7–d6 and can later play ...d7–d5 in one move if possible. For example, if White tries to play in the style of the Yugoslav Attack with 5.Nc3 Bg7 6.Be3 Nf6 7.f3 0-0 8.Qd2, 8...d5! equalises immediately. When White does play 5.Nc3, it is usually with the idea of continuing 5...Bg7 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Bc4 0-0 8.Bb3 (forestalling any tricks involving ...Nxe4 and ...d5), followed by kingside castling.

The critical test of Black&#x27;s move order is 5.c4, the Maróczy Bind. White hopes to cramp Black&#x27;s position by impeding the ...d7–d5 and ...b7–b5 pawn thrusts. Generally, this line is less tactical than many of the other Sicilian variations, and play involves much strategic maneuvering on both sides. After 5.c4, the main line runs 5...Bg7 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Nc3 and now 7...0-0 or 7...Ng4 is most frequently played.
==== Kalashnikov Variation: 4...e5 5.Nb5 d6 ====

The Kalashnikov Variation (&quot;ECO&quot; code B32) is a close relative of the Sveshnikov Variation, and is sometimes known as the Neo-Sveshnikov. The move 4...e5 has had a long history; Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais used it in his matches against Alexander McDonnell in 1834, and it was also popular for a short time in the 1940s. These earlier games focused on the Löwenthal Variation (similar to the Kalashnikov but the reply to 5.Nb5 is 5...a6) with 4...e5 5.Nb5 a6 6.Nd6+ Bxd6 7.Qxd6 Qf6, where Black gives up the two bishops to achieve a lead in development. The move fell out of use, however, once it was determined that White kept the advantage in these lines. Another fifth move alternative for Black is 5...Nf6, which can transpose into the Sveshnikov Variation after 6.N1c3 or 6.Bg5 d6 7.N1c3.

Only in the late 1980s did Black players revive 4...e5 with the intention of meeting 5.Nb5 with 5...d6: this is the Kalashnikov Variation. The ideas in this line are similar to those in the Sveshnikov – Black accepts a backward pawn on d6 and weakens the d5-square but gains time by chasing the knight. The difference between the two variations is that Black has not developed the knight to f6 and White has not brought the knight to c3, so both players have extra options. Black may forego ...Nf6 in favour of ...Ne7, e.g. after 6.N1c3 a6 7.Na3 b5 8.Nd5 Nge7, which avoids White&#x27;s plan of Bg5 and Bxf6 to inflict doubled f-pawns on Black. Or, Black can delay bringing out the knight in favour of playing ...Be7–g5 or a quick ...f5. On the other hand, White has the option of 6.c4—the Maróczy Bind—which solidifies control of d5 and clamps down on ...b5, but leaves the d4-square slightly weak.

=== 2...e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 ===
Black&#x27;s move 2...e6 gives priority to developing the dark-squared bishop. After 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4, Black has three main moves: 4...Nc6 (the Taimanov Variation), 4...a6 (the Kan Variation) and 4...Nf6. After 4...Nf6 5.Nc3 (not 5.e5? Qa5+), Black can transpose to the Scheveningen Variation with 5...d6, play 5...Nc6, the Four Knights Variation or 5...Bb4, the Pin Variation.

==== Taimanov Variation: 4...Nc6 ====

Named after Mark Taimanov, the Taimanov Variation can be reached through 2...e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nc6 or 2...Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 e6. Black develops the knight to a natural square and keeps options open regarding the placement of the other pieces. One of the ideas of this system is to develop the king&#x27;s bishop to b4 or c5. White can prevent this by 5.Nb5 d6, when 6.c4 leads to a version of the Maróczy Bind favoured by Karpov. The resulting position after 6.c4 Nf6 7.N1c3 a6 8.Na3 b6 is a type of Hedgehog.

The Kasparov Gambit 8...d5 was played twice in the World Chess Championship 1985, but virtually disappeared from master praxis after the game Karpov–Van der Wiel, Brussels (SWIFT) 1986.

5.Nc3 is more common nowadays than 5.Nb5, when 5...d6 normally transposes to the Scheveningen Variation and 5...Nf6 is the Four Knights Variation (see below). Independent moves for Black are 5...Qc7 and 5...a6, with the former being the more usual move order seen in recent years, as after 5...a6, the continuation 6.Nxc6 bxc6 7.Bd3, despite its apparent simplicity, has given Black difficulties in reaching equality. Taimanov&#x27;s idea was to play 5...a6 (preventing Nb5) followed by ...Nge7 and ...Nxd4; however, the modern treatment of the line is to play ...Nf6, for example 5.Nc3 Qc7 6.Be2 a6 7.Be3 Nf6.
==== Kan (Paulsen) Variation: 4...a6 ====

Named after Ilya Kan. By playing 4...a6, Black prevents Nb5 and prepares an eventual ...b5 advance.

The most popular fifth move for White is 5.Bd3, when after 5...Bc5 6.Nb3 Black can either retreat 6...Be7 where 7.Qg4 makes Black&#x27;s kingside problematic, or 6...Ba7. Also possible is 5.c4 to create a Maróczy Bind setup.

White&#x27;s second most popular reply is 5.Nc3, when Black&#x27;s development of the kingside knight often takes focus, since playing ...Nf6 can be met with e5 which both creates a Black weakness on the d6-square and causes the Black knight a disadvantageous move. So Black normally plays a move to control the e5-square and prevent the pawn from advancing. The main Kan move is 5...Qc7, although 5...Nc6 transposing into a Taimanov or 5...d6 transposing into a Scheveningen can occur. An alternative idea is the immediate 5...b5 to create pressure from the queenside with the idea of playing ...b4 attacking the c3-knight, or ...Bb7 to build pressure along the long white-squared diagonal. White generally answers with 6.Bd3, supporting the e4-pawn.
==== Four Knights Variation: 4...Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 ====

The Four Knights Variation is mainly used as a way of getting into the main line Sveshnikov Variation, reached after 6.Ndb5 d6 7.Bf4 e5 8.Bg5 a6 9.Na3 b5 or 6.Bf4 d6 7.Ndb5 e5 8.Bg5 a6 9.Na3 b5. The point of this move order is to avoid lines such as the Rossolimo Variation (1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5), or 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 6.Ndb5 d6 7.Nd5, which are possible in the standard Sveshnikov move order. On the other hand, in the Four Knights move order, White acquires the extra option of 6.Nxc6 bxc6 7.e5 Nd5 8.Ne4, so White is not obliged to enter the Sveshnikov.

If Black is not aiming for the Sveshnikov, the main alternative is to play 6...Bb4 in reply to 6.Ndb5. Then 7.a3 Bxc3+ 8.Nxc3 d5 9.exd5 exd5 leads to a position where Black has given up the two bishops but has active pieces and the possibility of playing ...d5–d4.
==== Pin Variation: 4...Nf6 5.Nc3 Bb4 ====

The Pin Variation (also called the Sicilian Counter-Attack) is considered theoretically suspect, but if White is unprepared the tactics can be difficult to calculate at the board. After 6.e5! (6.Bd3 is less challenging) Black has: 
*6...Ne4?! 7.Qg4! Nxc3 8.Qxg7 Rf8 9.a3 Nb5+ 10.axb4 Nxd4 11.Bg5 Qb6 12.Bh6 Qxb4+ 13.c3 Nf5 14.cxb4 Nxg7 15.Bxg7 with a clear advantage to White, Szabo-Mikenas, Kemeri 1939 
*6...Nd5 7.Bd2 Nxc3 8.bxc3 Be7 9.Qg4 and Black must either weaken the kingside with 9 ... g6 or give up the exchange after 9 ... 0-0 10.Bh6 g6. White need not take the exchange, and attacking with 11.h4 may in fact be stronger.

Also intriguing is 6. Nb5!, with 6...Nxe4?! met with 7. Qg4, with strong compensation for the pawn.
== 2.Nf3 without 3.d4: White&#x27;s third move alternatives ==
White can play 2.Nf3 without intending to follow up with 3.d4. The systems given below are usually classified along with White&#x27;s second move alternatives as .

=== 2...d6 without 3.d4 ===

==== Moscow Variation: 3.Bb5+ ====

After 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6, White&#x27;s most important alternative to 3.d4 is 3.Bb5+, known as the Moscow Variation or Canal–Sokolsky Attack. Grandmasters sometimes choose this variation when they wish to avoid theory; for instance, it was played by Garry Kasparov in the online game Kasparov–The World. Experts in this line include GMs Sergei Rublevsky and Tomáš Oral. Former World Champion Magnus Carlsen has also played this variation extensively. Black can block the check with 3...Bd7, 3...Nc6 or 3...Nd7. The position after 3...Nc6 can also be reached via the Rossolimo Variation after 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 d6.

Most common is 3...Bd7, when after 4.Bxd7+ Qxd7, White can either play 5.0-0 followed by c3 and d4, or 5.c4 in the style of the Maróczy Bind.

====Others====
Another possibility for White is 3.c3, a delayed variation of the Sicilian Defence, Alapin Variation intending to establish a pawn centre with d4 next move. The most frequent continuation is 3...Nf6 4.Be2, when 4...Nxe4? loses to 5.Qa4+ and likewise 4...Nc6 5 d4 Nxe4? loses to 6 d5 and 7 Qa4+

=== 2...Nc6 without 3.d4 ===

==== Rossolimo Variation: 3.Bb5 ====

The Rossolimo Variation, 3.Bb5, is a well-respected alternative to 3.d4. It is named after Nicolas Rossolimo and is related to the Moscow Variation. White&#x27;s usual intention is to play Bxc6, giving Black doubled pawns. Black&#x27;s major responses are 3...g6 preparing ...Bg7, 3...d6 preparing ...Bd7 (a hybrid line that also arises from the Moscow Variation after 2...d6 3.Bb5+ Nc6), and 3...e6 preparing 4...Nge7. Sergei Rublevsky and Tomáš Oral both play this line as well as the Moscow Variation. The Italian American Grandmaster Fabiano Caruana is perhaps the biggest proponent of this line at the top level, and has played this variation in Games 1, 3 and 5 of his World Championship Match against Magnus Carlsen.

==== Others ====
3.Nc3 is a common transpositional device for White, who can play 4.d4 or 4.Bb5 next move depending on Black&#x27;s response. Black sometimes plays 3...e5 to avoid both moves; then 4.Bc4 is considered White&#x27;s best move. 3.c3 transposes to lines of the Alapin Variation after 3...Nf6 or 3...d5, while 3.c4 transposes into the Symmetrical English.

=== 2...e6 without 3.d4 ===
White sometimes plays 3.Nc3 as a waiting move, though it has little independent significance. With 3.d3, White plans to develop in King&#x27;s Indian Attack style with g3 and Bg2; this line was used by Fischer to crush Oscar Panno in a famous game (Fischer–Panno, Buenos Aires 1970). 3.c3 will transpose to lines of the Alapin Variation after 3...Nf6, or the French Defence after 3...d5 4.e5 Nc6 5.d4, though 4...d4 is stronger, as after 5.cxd4 cxd4 6.Qa4+ Nc6 7.Bb5 Bd7 8.Bxc6 Bxc6 9.Qxd4 Bxf3 is a strong pawn sacrifice, giving Black excellent compensation. 3.c4 transposes into the Symmetrical English. 3.b3, intending Bb2, is a rare independent try, occasionally essayed by Heikki Westerinen in the 1970s.

=== 3.Bd3 ===
Danny Kopec has suggested the move 3.Bd3 against any of Black&#x27;s common responses, intending to follow up with c3 and Bc2.

== 2.Nf3: Black&#x27;s second move alternatives ==
After 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3, Black has some less commonly played options apart from 2...d6, 2...Nc6 and 2...e6.

=== Hyper-Accelerated Dragon: 2...g6 ===

After 2...g6, White commonly plays 3.d4, which may transpose to the Accelerated Dragon after 3...cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nc6, although White may deviate by playing 4.Qxd4, and Black can also avoid the transposition with 3.d4 Bg7 4.dxc5 Qa5+. Other third move options for White are 3.c3 transposing to a variation of the Alapin, and 3.c4 (Maróczy Bind).

=== O&#x27;Kelly Variation: 2...a6 ===

2...a6 is the O&#x27;Kelly Variation. Black&#x27;s idea is to meet 3.d4 with 3...cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 when 6.Ndb5 is prevented, and after 6.Nb3 or 6.Nf3 Black will equalize by playing 6...Bb4 and possibly ...d5. However, White may avoid this by instead playing 3.c3 or 3.c4.

=== Nimzowitsch–Rubinstein Variation: 2...Nf6 ===

2...Nf6 is the Nimzowitsch Variation. It bears some similarity to Alekhine&#x27;s Defence. White&#x27;s strongest reply is to chase the knight by 3.e5 Nd5 4.Nc3 and now (a) 4...Nxc3 5.dxc3, when 5...b6?, as Nimzowitsch played and recommended, loses to 6.e6! f6 7.Ne5! or (b) 4...e6 (the main line) 5.Nxd5 exd5 6.d4 Nc6 7.dxc5 Bxc5 8.Qxd5 Qb6 (8...d6 9.exd6 Qb6 is also played) 9.Bc4! Bxf2+ 10.Ke2 0-0 11.Rf1 Bc5 12.Ng5 Nd4+ 13.Kd1 with sharp play favouring White.

=== Others ===
Other moves include:
*2...b6 is the Katalymov Variation, after the Kazakh/Russian master Boris Katalymov. It is generally considered better for White, though it has frequently been played by the French GM Christian Bauer. Other GMs, including Gata Kamsky, have occasionally used it as a surprise weapon.
*2...Qc7 is the Quinteros Variation. It will frequently transpose into a standard line such as the Taimanov Variation or Kan Variation, or else White can play 3.c3 in the style of the Alapin Variation, where Black&#x27;s queen may not be so well placed on c7.

== Closed Sicilian: 2.Nc3 ==

2.Nc3 is White&#x27;s second most common move responding to 1.e4 c5. Black&#x27;s options are similar to those for 2.Nf3, the most common being ...Nc6, along with ...e6 and ...d6, and less commonly ...a6 and ...g6. 2...e5 transposes into a variant of the Vienna Game. In all cases, White can then play 3.Nf3, as if White had played 2.Nf3 then 3.Nc3 (e.g. 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 (&quot;ECO&quot; code B30)).

For the most part, other moves are the Closed Sicilian. Possible moves are 3.g3 and 3.f4 in general, also 3.Nge2, and less commonly 3.d3 and 3.Bc4. Many lines transpose to the Open Sicilian, the Moscow Variation, or the Rossolimo Variation, but there are many that do not.

Also of some interest is 3.Bb5 to ...Nc6.

A typical line is 2...Nc6 3.g3 (&quot;ECO&quot; code B24). Also, 2...Nc6 3.f4 is the Closed Sicilian, Grand Prix Attack (part of B23).

White can also keep options open with 3.Nge2. Andrew Soltis has dubbed that the &quot;Chameleon System&quot;, since White maintains the option of playing a Closed Sicilian with 4.g3 or transposing to a standard Open Sicilian with 4.d4 cxd4 5.Nxd4. Two drawbacks are that (a) the Closed Sicilian lines with an early Nge2 are not very challenging for Black, and (b) if Black plays 2...Nc6 3.Nge2 g6, 4.d4 reaches an Accelerated Dragon where White has lost the option of playing c4, the Maróczy Bind, often considered White&#x27;s best line. In view of possible transpositions to the main Sicilian variations, Black has various replies to 2.Nc3 in the Open Sicilian. 2...Nc6 is the most common choice, but 2...e6 and 2...d6 are often played. The Main line of the Closed Sicilian is 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.d3 d6 (diagram), when White&#x27;s main options are 6.Be3 followed by Qd2 and possibly 0-0-0, and 6.f4 followed by Nf3 and 0-0.

== White&#x27;s second move alternatives ==
After 1.e4 c5, other moves besides 2.Nf3 and 2.Nc3 are popular.

=== Alapin Variation: 2.c3 ===
2.c3 is the Alapin Variation or c3 Sicilian. Originally championed by Semyon Alapin at the end of the 19th century, it was revived in the late 1960s by Evgeny Sveshnikov and Evgeny Vasiukov. More recently, Deep Blue played it in game 1 of its 1996 match against then-world champion Garry Kasparov. Nowadays its strongest practitioners include grandmasters Sergei Tiviakov and Eduardas Rozentalis.

White aims to set up a classical pawn centre with 3.d4, so Black should counter immediately in the centre by 2...Nf6 or 2...d5.

The line 2...Nf6 3.e5 Nd5 resembles Alekhine&#x27;s Defence, but the inclusion of the moves c3 and ...c5 is definitely in Black&#x27;s favour. Now White can play 4.d4 cxd4 5.Nf3, when Black has a choice between 5...e6 and 5...Nc6. Another idea for White is 5.Bc4, which is met by 5...Qc7.

The other main line is 2...d5 3.exd5 Qxd5 4.d4 Nf6 5.Nf3, when Black&#x27;s main options are 5...e6 and 5...Bg4. In this line, White usually ends up with an isolated queen&#x27;s pawn after pawns are exchanged on d4.

A rarer option on Black&#x27;s second move is 2...e6, with the aim of transposing to the Advance Variation of the French Defence after 3.d4 d5 4.e5.

=== Grand Prix Attack: 2.f4 ===

2.f4 is the Grand Prix Attack or McDonnell Attack: the latter name stems from the 14th match game played in London in 1834 between Alexander McDonnell and Charles Louis Mahé de La Bourdonnais, won by Black. According to Jeremy Silman and others, Black&#x27;s best reply is 2...d5 3.exd5 Nf6!, the Tal Gambit, which has caused the immediate 2.f4 to decline in popularity. White may decline the gambit with 3.Nc3, called the &quot;Toilet Variation&quot;, so named after its reputed place of invention. A less common option is 2...e6, as La Bourdonnais played against McDonnell. Players usually enter the Grand Prix Attack nowadays by playing 2.Nc3 first before continuing 3.f4. The modern main line runs 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4 g6 4.Nf3 Bg7. Here White can play the positional 5.Bb5, threatening to double Black&#x27;s pawns with Bxc6, or the more aggressive 5.Bc4, aiming for a kingside attack.

=== Smith–Morra Gambit: 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 ===
2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 is the Smith–Morra Gambit. Declining it by either 3...Nf6 or 3...d5, transposing to the c3 line, is possible, but accepting it by 3...dxc3 is critical. After 4.Nxc3, White is considered not to have enough compensation for the pawn; however, it can be dangerous for Black if they are unprepared, as there are many pitfalls for the unwary.

=== Other moves ===
Other reasonable moves include:
*2.Ne2 is the Keres Variation, a favourite of Paul Keres, and has similar ideas to the Chameleon System discussed under 2.Nc3 – White can follow up with 3.d4 with an Open Sicilian, 3.g3 with a Closed Sicilian, or 3.Nbc3, continuing to defer the choice between the two.
*2.g3 is known as the Lasker–Dunne Attack. It was played between Steinitz and Anderssen in their 1866 match. It was also sometimes played by Taimanov. It can transpose to the Closed Sicilian but offers other options such as 2...d5 3.exd5 Qxd5, with Black&#x27;s queen threatening to capture White&#x27;s exposed rook, and an incipient central buildup with c3 and d4 for White.
*2.c4 occasionally leads to positions that resemble lines in the English Opening. Palliser and Keres recommend avoiding mainline English theory with 2...Nc6 3.Nc3 e5!, which prevents White from playing d4.
*2.d3 signals White&#x27;s intention to develop along King&#x27;s Indian Attack lines, and usually transposes to the Closed Sicilian.
*2.e5, which gains space and prevents Black playing ...Nf6. White often supports the e5-pawn with 3.f4 or 3.Nf3. The drawback of 2.e5 is that no additional pressure is brought to the centre, allowing Black various options.
*2.Na3 is an eccentric move recently returned to prominence by GM Vadim Zvjaginsev at the 2005 Russian Chess Championship Superfinal. He used it three times during the tournament, drawing twice and beating Alexander Khalifman.
*2.Qh5, threatening the c-pawn as in the Wayward Queen Attack, was played twice in 2005 by Hikaru Nakamura, but the move is considered dubious. Simply 2...Nf6 gives Black a comfortable position after 3.Qxc5 Nxe4, while 3.Qh4 displaces the queen and loses time. Nakamura lost in 23 moves to Andrei Volokitin in 2005, and Neil McDonald criticised the opening experiment as &quot;rather foolish&quot;.
*2.a3, the Mengarini Variation, is similar to the Wing Gambit, the idea being to play 3.b4 next move.
*2.b3 followed by 3.Bb2 is the Snyder Variation, named for USCF master Robert M. Snyder. It has been used occasionally by Nigel Short and is a favourite of Georgian GM Tamaz Gelashvili.
*2.Bc4 is the Bowdler Attack, and though once played at the highest level, is popular today only among club players or beginners who are unfamiliar with the Sicilian and are looking either to attack the weak f7 pawn or to prepare for a quick kingside castle. However, after a move such as 2...e6, Black will soon play ...d5 and open up the centre while gaining time by attacking the bishop. Anderssen–Wyvill, London 1851, continued 2...e6 3.Nc3 a6 4.a4 Nc6 5.d3 g6 6.Nge2 Bg7 7.0-0 Nge7 8.f4 0-0 9.Bd2 d5 10.Bb3 Nd4 11.Nxd4, and now Soltis recommends 11...cxd4! 12.Ne2 Bd7!
*2.b4 is the Wing Gambit. White&#x27;s idea is 2.b4 cxb4 3.a3, hoping to deflect Black&#x27;s c-pawn, then dominate the centre with an early d4. However, chess theory has proven in the past that this idea is dubious at best. The Wing Gambit is thus generally considered too reckless, and rarely seen in grandmaster praxis. GM Joe Gallagher calls it &quot;a forgotten relic, hardly having set foot in a tournament hall since the days of Frank Marshall and Rudolph Spielmann. White sacrifices a pawn for ... well, not a lot.&quot;

== &quot;ECO&quot; codes ==
The &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; classifies the Sicilian Defence under the codes B20 through B99, giving it more codes than any other opening. In general these guidelines apply:
*Codes B20 through B29 cover lines after 1.e4 c5 where White does not play 2.Nf3, and lines where White plays 2.Nf3 and Black responds with a move other than 2...d6, 2...Nc6 or 2...e6.
*Codes B30 through B39 cover the lines beginning 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 that do not transpose into lines that can also begin with 2...d6. The most important variations included here are the Rossolimo, Kalashnikov, Sveshnikov and Accelerated Dragon.
*Codes B40 through B49 cover the lines beginning 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6, most importantly the Taimanov and Kan variations.
*Codes B50 through B59 cover the lines after 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 not covered in codes B60–B99. This includes the Moscow Variation (3.Bb5+), 3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4, and lines in the Classical Variation except for the Richter–Rauzer Attack, including the Sozin Attack and the Boleslavsky Variation.
*Codes B60 through B69 cover the Richter–Rauzer Attack of the Classical Variation.
*Codes B70 through B79 cover the normal (unaccelerated) Dragon Variation.
*Codes B80 through B89 cover the Scheveningen Variation.
*Codes B90 through B99 cover the Najdorf Variation.

<text>The Kyūshū J7W &quot;Shinden&quot; (震電, &quot;Magnificent Lightning&quot;) is a World War II Japanese prototype, propeller-driven fighter plane with wings at the rear of the fuselage, a nose-mounted canard, and a pusher engine.

Developed by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) as a short-range, land-based interceptor, the J7W was a response to Boeing B-29 Superfortress raids on the Japanese Home Islands. For interception missions, the J7W was to be armed with four, forward-firing 30 mm type 5 cannons in the nose.

The &quot;Shinden&quot; was expected to be a highly maneuverable interceptor, but only two prototypes were finished before the end of the War. A jet engine–powered version was considered but never reached the drawing board.

==Design and development==
In the IJN designation system, &quot;J&quot; referred to land-based fighters and &quot;W&quot; to Watanabe Tekkōjo, the company that oversaw the initial design.

The idea of a canard-based design originated with Lieutenant Commander Masayoshi Tsuruno of the technical staff of the IJN in early 1943. Tsuruno believed the design could easily be retrofitted with a turbojet, when suitable engines became available. His ideas were worked out by the First Naval Air Technical Arsenal (&quot;Dai-Ichi Kaigun Koku Gijitsusho&quot;), which designed three gliders, designated Yokosuka MXY6, featuring canards. These were built by Chigasaki Seizo K. K., and one was later fitted with a 22 hp Semi 11 (Ha-90) 4-cylinder air-cooled engine.

The feasibility of the canard design was proven by both the powered and unpowered versions of the MXY6 by the end of 1943, and the Navy were so impressed by the flight testing, they instructed the Kyushu Aircraft Company to design a canard interceptor around Tsuruno&#x27;s concept. Kyushu was chosen because both its design team and production facilities were relatively unburdened, and Tsuruno was chosen to lead a team from &quot;Dai-Ichi Kaigun Koku Gijitsusho&quot; to aid Kyushu&#x27;s design works.

The construction of the first two prototypes started in earnest by June 1944, stress calculations were finished by January 1945, and the first prototype was completed in April 1945. The 2,130 hp Mitsubishi MK9D (Ha-43) radial engine and its supercharger were installed behind the cockpit and drove a six-bladed propeller via an extension shaft. Engine cooling was to be provided by long, narrow, obliquely-mounted intakes on the side of the fuselage. It was this configuration that caused cooling problems while running the engine while it was still on the ground. This, together with the unavailability of some equipment parts, postponed the first flight of the &quot;Shinden&quot;.

Even before the first prototype took to the air, the Navy ordered the J7W1 into production, with a quota of thirty &quot;Shinden&quot; a month given to Kyushu&#x27;s Zasshonokuma factory and 120 from Nakajima&#x27;s Handa plant. It was estimated some 1,086 &quot;Shinden&quot; could be produced between April 1946 and March 1947.

On 3 August 1945, the prototype first flew, with Tsuruno at the controls, from Mushiroda Airfield. Two more short flights were made, a total of 45 minutes airborne, one each on the same days as the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki occurred, before the War&#x27;s end. Flights were successful but showed a marked torque pull to starboard (due to the powerful engine), some flutter of the propeller blades, and vibration in the extended drive shaft.

==Surviving aircraft==
The two prototypes were the only examples of the &quot;Shinden&quot; ever completed. After the end of the war, one was scrapped; the other was claimed by a U.S. Navy Technical Air Intelligence Unit in late 1945, dismantled, and shipped to the United States.

The sole surviving J7W1 was reassembled, but has never been flown in the United States; the USN transferred it to the Smithsonian Institution in 1960. Its forward fuselage is currently on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center annex (at Dulles Airport) of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC. According to the NASM, &#x27;miscellaneous parts&#x27; are stored at Building 7C at the older storage/annex facility, the Garber Facility in Suitland, Maryland.
A 1:1 scale model of the J7W1, built by a then-unknown production company, was unveiled at the Tachiarai Peace Memorial Museum in July 2022. The company was later revealed to be Toho Studios, with the scale model being made for the production of &quot;Godzilla Minus One&quot; (2023).

Another full scale model with the fictional serial number &quot;53-102&quot; is known to exist, having been placed on display at the Yoichi Space Museum in Yoichi, Hokkaido as part of a temporary exhibit in 2016.

==In popular culture==
The &quot;Shinden&quot; was featured prominently in &quot;Godzilla Minus One&quot;, where one was used against the titular monster.

A modified version of the plane, designated the Sanka Mk.B, was featured heavily in the film &quot;The Sky Crawlers&quot;.

The &quot;Shinden&quot; was also featured in Ted Nomura&#x27;s six issue &quot;Kamikaze: 1946&quot; comic of 2000/2001.

<doc id="498009" wikidata="Q678245" url="?curid=498009" title="Pirc Defence">
<text>The Pirc Defence ( ) is a chess opening characterised by the response of Black to 1.e4 with 1...d6 and 2...Nf6, followed by ...g6 and ...Bg7, while allowing White to establish a with pawns on d4 and e4. It is named after the Slovenian grandmaster Vasja Pirc.

The Pirc Defence is usually defined by the opening sequence 
:1. 
:2. 
:3. 

This is the most commonly played line after Black responds to 1.e4 with 1...d6. It has been claimed to give rise to somewhat interesting and exciting games, where Black will have but has to be cautious about playing too passively. According to Garry Kasparov, the Pirc Defence is &quot;hardly worth using in the tournaments of the highest category&quot;, as it gives White &quot;too many opportunities for anybody&#x27;s liking&quot;.
==Description==
The Pirc Defence, named after Slovenian grandmaster Vasja Pirc, is a relatively new opening; while it was seen on occasion in the late nineteenth century, it was considered irregular, thus remaining a sideline. The opening began gaining some popularity only after World War II, and by the 1960s it was regarded as , owing in large part to the efforts of Canadian grandmaster Duncan Suttles. Black, in hypermodern fashion, does not immediately stake a claim in the centre with pawns; rather, Black works to undermine White&#x27;s centre from the . Its first appearance in a World Championship match was in 1972, when it was played by Bobby Fischer against Boris Spassky at Reykjavík (game 17); the game ended in a draw.

Hooper and Whyld gave a distinct formal definition, 1.d4 d6 2.e4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6, permuting White&#x27;s first two moves, although they qualified the definition by remarking that 1.e4 d6 could also transpose to the Pirc. The presence or absence of Black&#x27;s third move in the Pirc is reported differently, according to the source; with the pawn move 3...g6, Black prepares to fianchetto the king&#x27;s bishop to g7. Paul van der Sterren therefore described 3...g6 as &quot;the defining move of the Pirc Defence&quot; because the development of the bishop to g7 &quot;creates the same sort of positional tension as the King&#x27;s Indian Defence&quot;.

A distinction is usually drawn between the Pirc and lines where Black delays the development of his knight to f6, or omits it altogether; this is known as the Modern or Robatsch Defence. The tenth edition of &quot;Modern Chess Openings&quot; (1965) grouped the Pirc and Robatsch together as the &quot;Pirc–Robatsch Defense&quot;.

==Main line: 3...g6==

===Austrian Attack: 4.f4 ===
 
The Austrian Attack begins 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.f4 Bg7 5.Nf3, and was a favourite of Fischer. It is also well respected by Nick de Firmian, the author of &quot;Modern Chess Openings&quot; (). In placing pawns on d4, e4 and f4, White establishes a powerful centre, intending to push in the centre and/or attack on the ; in the main line, Black will usually counter with ...e5, aiming for play against the dark squares and weaknesses created by White&#x27;s central advance. This direct, aggressive line is one of the most ambitious systems against the Pirc. Jan Timman has played the Austrian successfully with both colours. Yuri Balashov does well with the white pieces, and Valery Beim has an impressive score on the black side.

====5...0-0====
The most frequently played move after 5...0-0 is 6.Bd3 (the Weiss Variation), with 6...Nc6 the most common response, though 6...Na6, with the idea of ...Nc7, ...Rb8 and ...b5 became popular in the 1980s after 6...Nc6 was found to offer Black few winning chances. 6.e5 is a try, with unclear consequences, which was much played in the 1960s, though it has never attained popularity at the highest levels. 6.Be2 is another move which was often seen in the 1950s and early 1960s, although the defeat sustained by Fischer in the game given in the example games spurred White players, including Fischer, to turn to 6.Bd3. In the 1980s, 6.Be2 c5 7.dxc5 Qa5 8.0-0 Qxc5+ 9.Kh1 was revived with more favourable results. 6.Be3 is another possibility, first extensively explored in the 1970s and played by Bojan Kurajica, Yuri Balashov and Alexander Beliavsky, which leads to sharp play.

====5...c5====
Black&#x27;s chief alternative to 5...0-0 lies in an immediate strike against the white centre with 5...c5, to which the usual response is either 6.dxc5 or 6.Bb5+. The former allows 6...Qa5. The latter promises a tactical melee, with a common line being 6.Bb5+ Bd7 7.e5 Ng4 8.e6 (8.h3 or 8.Bxd7+ are other possibilities) 8...fxe6, which was thought bad, until Yasser Seirawan played the move against Gyula Sax in 1988 (8...Bxb5 is the alternative, if Black does not want the forced draw in the main line), continuing 9.Ng5 Bxb5 Now if White tries 10.Nxe6, Black has 10...Bxd4!, ignoring the threat to his queen, in view of 11.Nxd8 Bf2+ 12.Kd2 Be3+ with a draw by perpetual check. White can instead try 11.Nxb5, with complicated play.

White can also essay the sharp 6.e5 against 5...c5, after which 6...Nfd7 7.exd6 0-0 is considered to offer good play for Black.

===Classical (Two Knights) System: 4.Nf3 ===
The Classical (Two Knights) System begins 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.Be2 0-0 6.0-0. White contents themselves with the &#x27;classical&#x27; with pawns at e4 and d4, forgoing the committal move f2–f4 as Black castles and builds a compact structure. Efim Geller, Anatoly Karpov and Evgeni Vasiukov have all successfully used this system for White; Zurab Azmaiparashvili has scored well as Black. This transposes into the Sicilian Dragon after 6...c5 7.Be3 cxd4 8.Nxd4.

===The 150 and Argentine Attacks===
The setup f2–f3, Be3 and Qd2 is commonly used against the King&#x27;s Indian Defence and Dragon Sicilian, and can also be used against the Pirc; indeed, this system is as old as the Pirc itself.

The system 4.f3 was introduced by Argentine players c. 1930 and again in 1950. It was never considered dangerous for Black because of 4.f3 Bg7 5.Be3 c6 6.Qd2 b5. It received a severe blow in about 1985, when Gennady Zaichik showed that Black could castle anyway and play a dangerous gambit with 5...0-0 6.Qd2 e5.

The Argentines feared the sally ...Ng4, though some British players (especially Mark Hebden, Paul Motwani, Gary Lane, later also Michael Adams) came to realise that this was mainly dangerous for Black, therefore playing Be3 and Qd2 in all sorts of move orders, while omitting f2–f3. They called this the &quot;150 Attack&quot;, because players of this strength (150 ECF) can easily play this position and get strong play without any theory.

The original Argentine idea probably is only viable after 4.Be3 Bg7 5.Qd2 0-0 6.0-0-0 c6 (or Nc6) 7.f3 b5 8.h4. Black usually does not castle, though, and prefers 5...c6 or even 4...c6. The question of whether and when to insert Nf3 remains unclear.

===Other systems===
* 4.Bg5 was introduced by Robert Byrne in the 1960s, after which Black has often played the natural 4...Bg7, though 4...c6 is considered more flexible, as Black may wish to save a tempo in anticipation of White&#x27;s plan of Qd2, followed by Bh6, by deferring ...Bg7 as long as possible, playing for activity with ...b7–b5 and ...Qa5. White&#x27;s idea of Qd2 and Bh6 may give a transposition to the lines with Be3 and Qd2. A less common method of playing this system is 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.Bg5.
* 4.Bf4. This formerly rare move has become more popular lately, in large part because the position can come about via a fashionable line of the London System: 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bf4 g6 3.Nc3 d6 4.e4. 
* 4.Bc4 Bg7 5.Qe2 is a sharp try for advantage; 5...Nc6 can lead to hair-raising complications after 6.e5, when Black&#x27;s best line may be 6...Ng4 7.e6 Nxd4 8.Qxg4 Nxc2+, avoiding the more frequently played 6...Nxd4 7.exf6 Nxe2 8.fxg7 Rg8 9.Ngxe2 Rxg7, which has been generally considered to lead to an equal or unclear position, though White has scored heavily in practice. 6...Nd7 is now considered fine for Black, in view of 7.e6 fxe6 8.Qxe6 Nde5! 9.Qd5 e6 with advantage to Black. If White instead plays the better 7.Nf3, Black has multiple choices, including 7...0-0 and 7...Nb6 (followed by ...Na5), which is considered to equalise. Another possibility for Black is 5...c6, though 6.e5 dxe5 7.dxe5 Nd5 8.Bd2, followed by long castling, gives White the advantage, as Black&#x27;s position is cramped and he lacks active counterplay. 
* 4.g3 and 5.Bg2, followed by Nge2, is a solid line, which was sometimes adopted by Karpov.
* 4.Be3 is another alternative. Considered relatively passive in earlier times, today&#x27;s practice uses this move as a flexible entry into lines which may feature h3/Nf3 or even h3/g4/Bg2 – while still maintaining the option of returning to 150-like plans or the Austrian if Black commits to moves that do not help in this type of position.
* 4.Be2 may transpose into the Classical System after 4...Bg7 5.Nf3, or White may try one of two highly aggressive lines, the Bayonet Attack (5.h4) or the Chinese Variation (5.g4).

==Early deviations==

After 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3, Black has an alternative to 3...g6 (Main line) known as the Pribyl System or Czech Defence, beginning 3...c6. The lines often transpose to the Pirc if Black later plays ...g6; alternatively, Black can play ...Qa5 and ...e5 to challenge White&#x27;s centre, or expand on the with ...b5.

A common deviation by Black in recent practice is 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 e5. This has been tried by many GMs over the years, including Zurab Azmaiparashvili and Christian Bauer. White&#x27;s 4.dxe5 is known to be equal, and play normally continues 4...dxe5 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8 6.Bc4 Be6 7.Bxe6 fxe6. Instead, White normally transposes to the Philidor Defence with 4.Nf3.

An unusual deviation for Black is 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 e6, which can transpose to the Scheveningen Variation of the Sicilian Defence after 4.Nf3 Be7 5.Bb5+ c6 6.Be2 0-0 7.Be3 c5 8.0-0 cxd4 9.Nxd4.

An unusual but quite reasonable deviation for White is 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.f3. At the 1989 Barcelona World Cup event, former world champion Garry Kasparov surprised American grandmaster Yasser Seirawan with this move. After 3...g6 4.c4, an unhappy Seirawan found himself defending the King&#x27;s Indian Defence for the first time in his life, though he managed to draw the game. Black can avoid a King&#x27;s Indian with 3...e5, which may lead to an Old Indian type of position after 4.d5, with 3...c5, which may lead to a Benoni type of position after 4.d5 or transpose to Prins Variation of the Sicilian Defence after 4.Ne2 cxd4 5.Nxd4, or with 3...d5. This can transpose to the Classical Variation of the French Defence after 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 e6 6.Nf3, to the Tarrasch Variation of the French Defence after 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 e6 6.c3 c5 7.Nd2 Nc6 8.Ndf3, or even to the Blackmar–Diemer Gambit with an extra tempo for White after 4.Nc3 dxe4 5.Bg5 exf3 6.Nxf3.

<doc id="498014" wikidata="Q1132401" url="?curid=498014" title="Modern Defense">
<text>The Modern Defense (also known as the Robatsch Defence after Karl Robatsch) is a hypermodern chess opening in which Black allows White to occupy the with pawns on d4 and e4, then proceeds to attack and undermine this &quot;ideal&quot; center without attempting to occupy it. 

The Modern Defense usually starts with the opening moves:
:1. 

The opening has been most notably used by British grandmasters Nigel Davies and Colin McNab.

The Modern Defense is closely related to the Pirc Defence, the primary difference being that in the Modern, Black delays developing the knight to f6. The delay of ...Nf6 attacking White&#x27;s pawn on e4 gives White the option of blunting the g7-bishop with c2–c3. There are numerous transpositional possibilities between the two openings.

The &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; (&quot;ECO&quot;) classifies the Modern Defense as code B06, while codes B07 to B09 are assigned to the Pirc. The tenth edition of &quot;Modern Chess Openings&quot; (1965) grouped the Pirc and Robatsch together as the &quot;Pirc–Robatsch Defense&quot;.
==2.d4==

===Main line: 2.d4 Bg7===
White&#x27;s strongest response to the Modern Defense is 2.d4, to which Black typically responds 2...Bg7. The main continuations are:
* 3. Nc3 d6 4. f4 c6 5. Nf3 Bg4 (the Standard Line, &quot;ECO&quot; B06)
* 3. c4 (&quot;ECO&quot; A40) d6 4. Nc3 Nc6 5. Be3 e5 6. d5 Nce7 (7.g4 will be answered by 7...f5 8.gxf5 gxf5 9.Qh5+ Ng6 10.exf5 Qh4 11.Qxh4 Nxh4 12.Nb5 Kd8)
Other possibilities include:
* 3.Bc4 (Bishop Attack)
* 3.Bd2 (Westermann Gambit)
* 3.Bd3 (Wind Gambit)
* 3.f4 (Three Pawns Attack)
* 3.g3
* 3.Nf3

===Fischer&#x27;s 3.h4!?===
Bobby Fischer suggested the move 3.h4!? as an unorthodox try against 1...g6 2.d4 Bg7, in his annotation to a game against Pal Benko. (Fischer played 3.Nc3 in the actual game.) The idea is to pry open Black&#x27;s by h4–h5 followed by hxg6, as ...gxh5 would greatly weaken the cover to Black&#x27;s king.

===Averbakh System===

The &quot;Modern Defense, Averbakh System&quot; (&quot;ECO&quot; A42) can be reached by the lines:

* 1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.c4 d6 4.Nc3 (diagram)
* 1.d4 g6 2.c4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.e4 (diagram)

Possible moves for Black at this point include 4...Nf6, 4...Nc6, 4...e5, and 4...Nd7. The move 4...Nf6 
leads to a position of the King&#x27;s Indian Defence, where White has options 5.Nf3, 5.f3, 5.Be2, 5.f4, and so on. 
==Unusual White responses==
The flexibility and toughness of the Modern Defense have provoked some very aggressive responses by White, including the crudely named Monkey&#x27;s Bum, a typical sequence being 1.e4 g6 2.Bc4 Bg7 3.Qf3. (A more refined version is the Monkey&#x27;s Bum Deferred, where White plays Bc4 and Qf3 only after developing the .)

== Unusual Black responses ==
Other unusual openings can be reached after 1.e4 g6. The Hippopotamus Defence is one such system. Another is the Norwegian Defence (also known as the North Sea Defence) which begins 1.e4 g6 2.d4 Nf6 3.e5 Nh5. (If White plays 4.g4, Black retreats the knight with 4...Ng7. On 4.Be2, Black can retreat the knight or gambit a pawn with 4...d6!? If White plays 3.Nc3 instead of 3.e5, Black can transpose to the Pirc Defence with 3...d6 or continue in unconventional fashion with 3...d5!?)

== Transpositions ==
Transpositions are possible after 2.c4, for example a Maróczy Bind results after 2...c5 3.Nf3 Bg7 (or Nc6) 4.d4 cxd4 5.Nxd4 and the Averbakh system is reached after 2...Bg7 3.d4 d6 4.Nc3.
After 2.Nf3, Black can play 2...c5, transposing to the Sicilian Defense, or 2...Bg7. Following 2.Nc3, Black can transpose to a closed Sicilian with 2...c5 or play 2...Bg7.

==Kavalek vs. Suttles==
In the following game played at the Nice Olympiad in 1974, Canadian GM Duncan Suttles, one of the Modern&#x27;s leading exponents, defeats Czech-American GM Lubomir Kavalek:&lt;br&gt;
:1. e4 g6 2. d4 d6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. Be2 Nf6 5. Nc3 (Pirc Defence by transposition) 5... a6 6. a4 0-0 7. 0-0 b6 8. Re1 Bb7 9. Bc4 e6 10. Bf4 Nbd7 11. Qd2 b5! (initiating a deep combination; Suttles later remarked that Kavalek has occupied the center and developed his pieces in the manner advocated by Fred Reinfeld, yet now stands worse) 12. axb5 axb5 13. Rxa8 Qxa8 14. Bxb5 Bxe4 15. Nxe4 Nxe4 16. Rxe4 Qxe4 17. Bxd7 Ra8 18. h4 Qb7! (despite his advantage, White is in trouble; note that his bishop on d7 is nearly trapped) 19. d5 e5 20. Bh6 Qxb2 21. h5 Ra1+ 22. Kh2 Qb1 23. Bxg7 Qh1+ 24. Kg3 Kxg7 25. Bh3 Qc1 26. h6+ Kf6 27. c4 Qxd2 28. Nxd2 Kg5 29. Ne4+ Kxh6 30. Bd7 f5 31. Nf6 Ra7 32. Bb5 g5 33. Ng8+ Kg7 34. Ne7 Kf6 35. Nc6 Ra3+ 36. Kh2 h5 37. Nb8 h4 38. Na6 g4 39. Nxc7 Ra2 40. Kg1 g3 41. fxg3 hxg3 42. Kf1 e4 0–1

<text>The Queen&#x27;s Gambit is the chess opening that starts with the moves:
:1. 
:2. 

It is one of the oldest openings and is still commonly played today. It is traditionally described as a &quot;gambit&quot; because White appears to sacrifice the c-pawn; however, this could be considered a misnomer as Black cannot retain the pawn without incurring a disadvantage.
==History==
The Queen&#x27;s Gambit is one of the oldest known openings in chess. It was mentioned in the Göttingen manuscript of 1490 and was later analyzed by Gioachino Greco in the 17th century. In the 18th century, it was recommended by Philipp Stamma of Aleppo and is sometimes known as the Aleppo Gambit in his honor. During the early period of modern chess, queen pawn openings were not in fashion, and the Queen&#x27;s Gambit did not become commonplace until the 1873 tournament in Vienna.

As Wilhelm Steinitz and Siegbert Tarrasch developed chess theory and increased the appreciation of , the Queen&#x27;s Gambit grew more popular, reaching its zenith in the 1920s and 1930s, and it was played in all but 2 of 34 games in the 1927 World Championship match between José Raúl Capablanca and Alexander Alekhine.

After the resumption of international chess activity following World War II, it was less frequently seen as many players moved away from symmetrical openings, tending to use an Indian Defence to combat queen pawn openings; however, it is still frequently played.

==Overview==
With 2.c4, White threatens to exchange a wing pawn (the c-pawn) for a center pawn (Black&#x27;s d-pawn) in order to dominate the with e2–e4. Black cannot hold the pawn, for example: 1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 3.e3 b5 (Black tries to guard their pawn but should pursue with 3...Nf6 or 3...e5) 4.a4 c6? 5.axb5 cxb5 6.Qf3 winning a piece.

The Queen&#x27;s Gambit is divided into two major categories based on Black&#x27;s response: the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted (QGA) and the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined (QGD). In the QGA, Black plays 2...dxc4, temporarily giving up the center to obtain freer development. In the QGD, Black usually plays to hold d5. Frequently Black will be cramped, but Black aims to exchange pieces and use at c5 and e5 to free Black&#x27;s game.

== Variations ==
Technically, any Black response other than 2...dxc4 (or another line with an early ...dxc4 that transposes into the QGA) is a Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined, but the Slav, Albin Countergambit, and Chigorin Defense are generally treated separately. There are so many QGD lines after 2...e6 that many of them are distinctive enough to warrant separate treatment. The Orthodox Defense and the Tarrasch Defense are two important examples. (See Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined for more.)

After 1.d4 d5 2.c4:
* 2...e6 – Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined or QGD (&quot;ECO&quot; D30–D69). This is the main line, with many variations.
* 2...dxc4 – Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted or QGA (D20–D29). Less popular than the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined, it nevertheless has a solid reputation.
* 2...c6 – Slav Defense (D10–D19). This is a solid response, although many variations are very tactical. If Black plays both ...c6 and ...e6 (in either order), the opening takes characteristics of both the Slav and the Orthodox Defense and is classified as a Semi-Slav Defense.
* 2...e5 – Albin Countergambit (D08–D09), a sharp attempt by Black to gain the initiative. It is uncommon in top-level chess but can be a dangerous weapon in club play.
* 2...Nc6 – Chigorin Defense (D07) The Chigorin Defense takes the game away from the normal positional channels of the QGD and has been favored by Alexander Morozevich at the top level; it appears to be for Black.
* 2...Bf5 – Baltic Defense (D06), an offbeat but playable line.
* 2...c5 – Symmetrical Defense (D06). This is rarely played; although it has not been definitely refuted, the play seems to favor White.
* 2...Nf6 – Marshall Defense (D06), named after Frank Marshall, who first devised the move, he briefly played it in the 1920s before abandoning it. 
* 2...g6?! – Alekhine idea (D06). White can gain the advantage by 3.cxd5 Qxd5 (3...Nf6 4.Qa4 ) 4.Nc3 Qa5 5.Nf3 Bg7 6.Bd2 c6 7.e4 Qb6 8.Bc4 Bxd4 9.Nxd4 Qxd4 10.Qb3 Qg7 11.0-0 +/− (Minev).

If White chooses to fianchetto the , the game transposes into the Catalan Opening.

<text>The King&#x27;s Indian Defence (or KID) is a common chess opening. It is defined by the following moves:
: 1. 
: 2. 

Black intends to follow up with 3...Bg7 and 4...d6 (the Grünfeld Defence arises when Black plays 3...d5 instead and is considered a separate opening). White&#x27;s major third move options are 3.Nc3, 3.Nf3, or 3.g3, with both the King&#x27;s Indian and Grünfeld playable against these moves. 

The King&#x27;s Indian is a hypermodern opening, where Black deliberately allows White control of the with pawns, with the view to subsequently challenge it. In the most critical lines of the King&#x27;s Indian, White erects an imposing pawn centre with Nc3 followed by e4. Black stakes out their own claim to the centre with the Benoni-style ...c5, or ...e5. If White resolves the central pawn tension with d5, then Black follows with either ...b5 and play, or ...f5 and an eventual attack. Meanwhile, White attempts to expand on the opposite wing. The resulting unbalanced positions offer scope for both sides to play for a win.

The &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; classifies the King&#x27;s Indian Defence under the codes E60 through E99.
==History==
The earliest known use of the term &quot;Indian Defence&quot; was in 1884. The modern names &quot;King&#x27;s Indian Defence&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s Indian Attack&quot;, etc. arose in the mid-twentieth century and are attributed to Hans Kmoch. Until the mid-1930s, the King&#x27;s Indian Defence was generally regarded as highly suspect, but the analysis and play of three strong Soviet players in particular—Alexander Konstantinopolsky, Isaac Boleslavsky, and David Bronstein—helped to make the defence much more respected and popular. It is a dynamic opening, exceptionally complex, and a favourite of former world champions Garry Kasparov, Bobby Fischer, and Mikhail Tal, with prominent grandmasters (GMs) Viktor Korchnoi, Miguel Najdorf, Efim Geller, John Nunn, Svetozar Gligorić, Wolfgang Uhlmann, and Ilya Smirin having also contributed much to the theory and practice of this opening. 

In the early 2000s the opening&#x27;s popularity suffered after Vladimir Kramnik began scoring excellently against it, so much so that Kasparov gave up the opening after several critical losses to Kramnik. However, Kramnik himself won a game on the black side of the KID in 2012, and current top players including Hikaru Nakamura, Teimour Radjabov, and Ding Liren play the opening.

==Variations==
The main variations of the King&#x27;s Indian are:

=== 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 ===

====Classical Variation: 5.Nf3 0-0 6.Be2 e5 ====

The Classical Variation is 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Nf3 0-0 6.Be2 e5.
* The Main Line or Mar del Plata Variation continues 7.0-0 Nc6 8.d5 Ne7. Now White has a wide variety of moves, including 9.b4, 9.Ne1, and 9.Nd2, among others. Typically, White will try to attack on the queenside by preparing the pawn break c4–c5, while Black will attack on the kingside by transferring their knight from f6 to d7 (usually better placed than at e8, as it helps slow White&#x27;s queenside play with c4–c5), and starting a kingside pawn storm with f7–f5–f4 and g6–g5. 9.b4, the Bayonet Attack, introduced by Korchnoi in the 1970s, used to put top players off playing this line, but it has recently been revived by Radjabov.
* 7.0-0 Nbd7 is the Old Main Line, and is , though less common nowadays than 7...Nc6. 
* 7.0-0 exd4 8.Nxd4 is also possible, although White&#x27;s extra space usually is of greater value than Black&#x27;s counterplay against White&#x27;s centre. Made popular in the mid-1990s by the Russian GM Igor Glek, new ideas were found for White yet some of the best lines for White were later refuted. White still has an advantage in most lines. 
* 7.0-0 Na6 has seen some popularity recently. The purpose of this awkward-looking move is to transfer the knight to c5 after White&#x27;s eventual d5, while guarding c7 if Black should play ...Qe8. Play commonly continues 8.Be3 Ng4 9.Bg5 Qe8 but White has also tried:
** 8.dxe5 dxe5 9.Qxd8 Rxd8 with even chances;
** 8.d5 Nc5 9.Qc2 a5 may transpose into the Petrosian Variation (see below);
** 8.Bg5 h6 9.Bh4 Qe8 10.Bxf6 Bxf6 11.c5!, which is not totally reliable for Black.
* 7.d5 is the Petrosian Variation, so named for the 1963–1969 world champion Tigran Petrosian, who often essayed the line in the 1960s, with Vladimir Kramnik playing this variation extensively in the 1990s. The plans for both sides are roughly the same as in the main variation. After 7...a5 White plays 8.Bg5 to pin the knight, making it harder for Black to achieve the ...f7–f5 break. In the early days of the system, Black would drive the bishop back with ...h6 and ...g5, though players subsequently switched to ideas involving ...Na6, ...Qe8 and ...Bd7, making White&#x27;s c4–c5 break more difficult, only then playing for kingside activity. Joe Gallagher has recommended the flexible 7...Na6 which has similar ideas to 7...a5.
* 7.Be3 is often known as the Gligorić System, after the World Championship Candidate Svetozar Gligorić, who has contributed much to King&#x27;s Indian theory and practice with both colours. More recently, other strong players such as Korchnoi, Anatoly Karpov, and Kasparov have played this line. The main idea behind this move is to avoid the theoretical lines that arise after 7.0-0 Nc6. This move allows White to maintain, for the moment, the tension in the centre. If Black plays mechanically with 7...Nc6, 8.d5 Ne7 9.Nd2! is a favourable setup, so Black most often responds by crossing their opponent&#x27;s plans with 7...Ng4 8.Bg5 f6 9.Bh4 Nc6, but other moves are also seen, such as:
** 7...Na6 8.0-0 transposing into the Modern.
** 7...h6 is a favourite of John Nunn. The main line runs 8.0-0 Ng4 9.Bc1 Nc6 10.d5 Ne7 11.Ne1 f5 12.Bxg4 fxg4. In this subvariation, Black&#x27;s kingside play is of a different type than normal KID lines, as it lacks the standard pawn breaks, so they will now play g6–g5 and Ng6–f4, often investing in a piece attack on the f-file against the white king, while White plays for the usual queenside breakthrough with c4–c5. 
** 7...exd4 immediately surrenders the centre, with a view to playing a quick c7–c6 and d6–d5. For example, 8.Nxd4 Re8 9.f3 c6 10.Qd2 (10.Bf2!?) 10...d5 11.exd5 cxd5 12.0-0 Nc6 13.c5 and 13...Rxe3!? (which was first seen in game 11 of the 1990 World Chess Championship between Kasparov and Karpov).
* In the Exchange Variation (7.dxe5 dxe5 8.Qxd8 Rxd8), White exchanges queens and is content to play for a small, safe advantage in the relatively quiet positions which will ensue in this queenless middlegame. The line is often played by White players hoping for an early draw, but there is still a lot of play left in the position. White tries to exploit d6 with moves such as b4, c5, Nf3–d2–c4–d6, etc., while Black will play to control the hole on d4. In practice, it is easier to exploit d4, and chances are balanced. If Black is able to play ...Nd4, they will often have at least an position, even when this involves the sacrifice of a pawn to eliminate White&#x27;s dark-squared bishop.

=====Sidelines=====
A minor but still significant sideline occurs for White on move 6, with 6.Bg5, the Zinnowitz Variation, instead of 6.Be2 e5. The line was played several times by German GM Burkhard Malich in the 1960s and 1970s. It is currently unfashionable at master level; Black gets a good game with either 6...h6 or 6...Nbd7. This line is distinct from the much more popular Averbakh Variation, described below, since in the Zinnowitz, White has played 5.Nf3 instead of 5.Be2, as in the Averbakh, and then follows with 6.Bg5.

Another, more significant and quite popular sideline occurs for Black on move 6, with 6...Bg4, in place of the mainline 6...e5. One idea for Black here is to relieve their somewhat cramped position by exchanging their light-squared bishop, which is often relegated to a passive role in the King&#x27;s Indian. White&#x27;s most popular response is 7.Be3, similar to the Gligorić System (see above); White seems to retain a small edge in every variation. Top players who have used this line for Black include two former World Champions: GMs Mikhail Tal and Boris Spassky. 

After 6...c5 7.0-0 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Nc6, the game transposes into the Accelerated Dragon variation of the Sicilian Defence.

====Sämisch Variation: 5.f3 ====
The Sämisch Variation is 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f3. It is named after Friedrich Sämisch, who developed the system in the 1920s. This often leads to very sharp play with the players castling on opposite wings and attacking each other&#x27;s kings, as in the Bagirov–Gufeld game given below, though it may also give rise to heavyweight positional struggles. Black has a variety of pawn breaks, such as ...e5, ...c5 and ...b5 (prepared by ...c6 and/or ...a6). This can transpose to the Modern Benoni after 5...0-0 6.Bg5 c5 7.d5 e6. World champions Mikhail Botvinnik, Mikhail Tal, Tigran Petrosian, Boris Spassky, Anatoly Karpov, and Garry Kasparov have all played this variation. This line defends the e4-pawn to create a secure centre and enables White to begin an attack kingside with Be3, Qd2, Bh6, g2–g4, and h2–h4. It allows placement of a bishop on e3 without allowing ...Ng4; its drawback, however, is that it deprives the knight on g1 of its most natural square, thus impeding of the kingside. Black can strike for the centre as previously mentioned or delay with 6...Nc6, 7...a6, and 8...Rb8 so that Black can play ...b7–b5 to open lines on the queenside.
The Classical Defence to the Sämisch is 5...0-0 6.Be3 e5, when White has a choice between closing the centre with 7.d5, or maintaining the tension with 7.Nge2. Kasparov was a major proponent of this defence.

The Sämisch Gambit arises after 5...0-0 6.Be3 c5. This is a pawn sacrifice, and was once considered dubious. As Black&#x27;s play has been worked out, this evaluation has changed, and the gambit now enjoys a good reputation. A practical drawback, however, is that a well-prepared but unambitious White player can often enter lines leading to a forced draw. The line where White accepts the gambit runs 5...0-0 6.Be3 c5 7.dxc5 dxc5 8.Qxd8 (8.e5 Nfd7 9.f4 f6 10.exf6 is also possible here, though less often seen) Rxd8 9.Bxc5 Nc6. Black&#x27;s activity is believed to give sufficient compensation. White&#x27;s most frequent play is to decline the gambit, and instead play 7.Nge2, and head for Benoni type positions after a d4–d5 advance. However, after 7...cxd4 (preventing the d4-d5 advance) 8.Nxd4 Nc6, the game transposes into the Accelerated Dragon variation of the Sicilian Defence.

5...0-0 6.Be3 Nc6 7.Nge2 a6 8.Qd2 Rb8 leads to the Panno Variation of the Sämisch. Black prepares to respond appropriately depending on White&#x27;s choice of plan. If White plays 0-0-0 and goes for a kingside attack, then 7...a6 prepares ...b7–b5 with a counterattack against White&#x27;s castled position. If instead White plays more cautiously, then Black challenges White&#x27;s centre with ...e5.
====Averbakh Variation: 5.Be2 0-0 6.Bg5 ====

The Averbakh Variation is 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Be2 0-0 6.Bg5 (named for Yuri Averbakh), which prevents the immediate 6...e5 (6...e5 7.dxe5 dxe5 8.Qxd8 Rxd8 9.Nd5 Nxd5 [if Black does not play Nxd5, Black loses the f6-knight] 10.Bxd8 Nb6 11.Bxc7 White is up an exchange and a pawn, the endgame should be winning for White).

Black often repels the bishop with 6...h6 giving them the option of a later ...g5, though in practice this is a weakening move. White has various ways to develop, such as Qd2, Nf3, f4, or even h4. Black obtains good play, however, against all of these development schemes. 

The old main line in this begins with 6...c5 (which keeps the long diagonal open). Also seen are 6...Nbd7 and 6...Na6 (Judit Polgár&#x27;s move).

It is possible that the Averbakh System (of the Modern Defence) can transition to the Averbakh Variation of the King&#x27;s Indian Defence.
====Four Pawns Attack: 5.f4 ====
The Four Pawns Attack continues with 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f4 0-0 6.Nf3. This is the most aggressive method for White, and was often seen in the 1920s. With their fifth move, White erects a massive centre at the price of falling behind in development. If Black can open the position, White may well find themselves overextended. From this 6...c5 is the main line.
* 6...c5 7.d5 e6 8.Be2 exd5 9.cxd5
** 9...Bg4 has been a solid line for Black.
** 9...Re8 can be justified with solid play.
** 9...b5 is known to lead to sharp, dangerous play.
* 6...Na6 is known as the Modern Variation. This is a move anticipating playing ...Nc5 with counterplay. If White makes neutral moves such as 7.Bd3, this has had success. On the other hand, 7.e5 is the most aggressive plan.
===Fianchetto Variation: 3.Nf3 Bg7 4.g3 ===

The Fianchetto Variation 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nf3 Bg7 4.g3 0-0 5.Bg2 d6 6.0-0, is named for White&#x27;s development of light-squared bishop to g2, and is one of the most popular lines at the grandmaster level, Korchnoi once its most notable practitioner. This method of development is on completely different lines than other King&#x27;s Indian variations. Here, Black&#x27;s normal plan of attack can hardly succeed, as White&#x27;s kingside is more solidly defended than in most KID variations. The most common responses are:
* 6...Nbd7 with 8...exd4. Black intends to claim the centre with ...e7–e5. 7.Nc3 e5 8.e4 exd4 9.Nxd4 Re8 10.h3 a6. Preparation has been made for 11...Rb8, with ...c7–c5 and ...b7–b5, and sometimes with ...Ne5 first. This is known as the Gallagher Variation of the Fianchetto Variation.
** 8...c6 and 8...a6 are alternatives.
* 6...Nc6 7.Nc3 a6 8.d5 Na5. This variation goes against ancient dogma which states that knights are not well placed on the rim; however, extra pressure is brought to bear against the Achilles Heel of the fianchetto lines—the weakness at c4. Hundreds of master games have continued with 9.Nd2 c5 10.Qc2 Rb8 11.b3 b5 12.Bb2 bxc4 13.bxc4 Bh6 14.f4 (14.e3 Bf5 is a that numbers Mark Taimanov among its victims; White must now lose material, as he has no good interposition) 14...e5!
==Sidelines==
Finally, White has other setups, such as Nf3 and h3 and Nge2 (with or without Bd3), but these are currently not as popular at the grandmaster level. 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Nge2 followed by 6.Ng3 is called the Hungarian Attack. 3.f3 is the Anti-Grünfeld.

<text>Price stability is a goal of monetary and fiscal policy aiming to support sustainable rates of economic activity. Policy is set to maintain a very low rate of inflation or deflation. For example, the European Central Bank (ECB) describes price stability as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the Euro area of below 2%. However, by referring to &quot;an increase in the HICP of below 2%&quot; the ECB makes clear that not only persistent inflation above 2% but also deflation (i.e. a persistent decrease of the general price level) are inconsistent with the goal of price stability.

In the United States, the Federal Reserve Act (as amended in 1977) directs the Federal Reserve to pursue policies promoting &quot;maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates&quot;. The Fed long ago determined that the best way to meet those mandates is to target a rate of inflation of around 2%; in 2011 it officially adopted a 2% annual increase in the personal consumption expenditures price index (often called PCE inflation) as the target. Since the mid-trend 1990s, the Federal Reserve&#x27;s measure of the inflation trend averaged 1.7%, a mere 0.3% shy of the Federal Open Market Committee’s 2% target for overall PCE inflation. Trend inflation as measured by the price index of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) – that is, excluding food and energy – has fluctuated between 1.2% and 2.3% over the past 20 years.

In managing the rate of inflation or deflation, information and expectations play an important role, as explained by Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond: &quot;If people expect inflation to erode the future value of money, they will rationally place a lower value on money today. This principle applies equally well to the price-setting behavior of firms. If a firm expects the general level of prices to rise by 3 percent over the coming year, it will take into account the expected increase in the costs of inputs and the prices of substitutes when setting its own prices today.&quot;

<text>The Bogo-Indian Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:
:1. 
:2. 
:3. 

The position after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 is common. The traditional move for White here is 3.Nc3, threatening to set up a big pawn centre with 4.e4. However, 3.Nf3 is often played instead as a way of avoiding the Nimzo-Indian Defence (which would follow after 3.Nc3 Bb4). After 3.Nf3, Black usually plays 3...b6 (the Queen&#x27;s Indian Defence) or 3...d5 (transposing to the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined), but can instead play 3...Bb4+, the Bogo-Indian Defence. Databases suggest that the Bogo-Indian is played approximately half as often as the Queen&#x27;s Indian.

The Bogo-Indian Defence can also arise via the move order 1.d4 e6 2.c4 Bb4+, the Keres Defence. 

The Bogo-Indian is classified as E11 by the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; (ECO).
==History==
The Bogo-Indian Defence is named after the Russian-born German master Efim Bogoljubow who is believed to have originated the opening and played it regularly in the 1920s. Subsequent prominent players to have adopted the Bogo-Indian include Aron Nimzowitsch, Paul Keres, Tigran Petrosian, Bent Larsen, Vasily Smyslov, Viktor Korchnoi, Ulf Andersson, Michael Adams and Nikita Vitiugov. 

==Variations==
White has three viable moves to meet the check. 4.Nc3 is a transposition to the Kasparov Variation of the Nimzo-Indian, therefore the main independent variations are 4.Bd2 and 4.Nbd2.

===4.Bd2===
4.Bd2 is the most common line; the bishop on b4 is now threatened and Black must decide how to meet this threat.

*4...Qe7 is now the most frequently played option. After 5. g3 Nc6, the main line continues 6. Nc3 Bxc3 7. Bxc3 Ne4 8. Rc1 0-0 9. Bg2 d6 10. d5 Nd8 11. dxe6 Nxe6 and the position is equal (see diagram). An alternative line is 6. Bg2 Bxd2+ 7. Nbxd2 d6 8. 0-0 a5 9. e4 e5 10. d5 Nb8 11. Ne1 0-0 12. Nd3 Na6 and the position is again equal.

*David Bronstein tried the sharper alternative 4...a5, grabbing space on the queenside at the cost of structural weaknesses.
*The simplest is to trade off the bishop by means of 4...Bxd2+; this line is not particularly popular, but has been played frequently by the Swedish grandmaster Ulf Andersson, often as a drawing line.

*A more modern line is 4...c5, after 5.Bxb4 cxb4, Black&#x27;s pawns are doubled, and a pawn has been pulled away from the centre, but the b4 pawn can also be annoying for White since it takes the c3-square away from the knight. In fact, one of White&#x27;s major alternatives is 6.a3, trading off this pawn at once.
*Simply retreating the bishop by means of 4...Be7 is also possible; Black benefits from losing a tempo since White&#x27;s dark-square bishop is misplaced at d2. The line is somewhat passive, but solid.

===4.Nbd2===
4.Nbd2 is an alternative aiming to acquire the bishop for the knight or forcing Black&#x27;s bishop to retreat. The downside is that the knight is developed to a square where it blocks the bishop, and d2 is a less active square than c3. The line is described in the &quot;Gambit Guide&quot; as &quot;ambitious&quot;. Black&#x27;s most common replies are 4...b6, 4...0-0, and 4...d5.

===Monticelli Trap===
This opening can sometimes give rise to the Monticelli Trap.

<doc id="498029" wikidata="Q200727" url="?curid=498029" title="Queen's Indian Defense">
<text>The Queen&#x27;s Indian Defense (QID) is a chess opening defined by the moves:
: 1. 
: 2. 
: 3. 

The opening is a solid defense to the Queen&#x27;s Pawn Game. 3...b6 increases Black&#x27;s control over the central light squares e4 and d5 by preparing to fianchetto the , with the opening deriving its name from this maneuver. As in the other Indian defenses, Black attempts to control the with pieces in hypermodern style, instead of occupying it with pawns in classical style.

By playing 3.Nf3, White sidesteps the Nimzo-Indian Defense that arises after 3.Nc3 Bb4. The Queen&#x27;s Indian is regarded as the sister opening of the Nimzo-Indian, since both openings aim to impede White&#x27;s efforts to gain full control of the center by playing e2–e4. Together, they are a well-respected response to 1.d4.
==Main line: 4.g3 ==
4. g3 (&quot;ECO&quot; E15–E19) has long been White&#x27;s most popular line against the Queen&#x27;s Indian. It contests the by preparing to fianchetto the light-squared bishop. The standard response for Black through the 1970s was 4...Bb7, but 4...Ba6 has since become the topical line. A rarer third option is 4...Bb4+, which aims to exchange the less useful dark-squared bishop, though this line tends to leave Black with a slightly passive position.

===Modern main line: 4...Ba6 ===
White can defend the pawn at c4 with a piece by playing 5.Nbd2, 5.Qa4, 5.Qc2 or 5.Qb3, but these moves all diminish control of d4, making ...c7–c5 an effective reply for Black; therefore 5. b3 is White&#x27;s most common response. However, it weakens the dark squares slightly, which Black can take advantage of by playing 5... Bb4+. Now 6.Nbd2 loses material after 6...Bc3 7.Rb1 Bb7 threatening 8...Be4, an opening trap which has ensnared players such as Kamran Shirazi. White&#x27;s best move is therefore 6. Bd2. However, after 6... Be7 7. Bg2 c6 Black is ready to play ...d7–d5, again attacking the c-pawn. If White plays cxd5 then ...cxd5 is considered to for Black. Thus White usually plays 8. Bc3 to clear the d2-square, and after 8... d5 White can play in two ways. After 9. Nbd2 Nbd7 10. 0-0 0-0 11. Re1 c5 Black has achieved his thematic before White and the resulting position after 12. e4 dxe4 13. Nxe4 is equal. Therefore, the main line continues 9. Ne5 and since Black does not want White to maintain this knight on a strong central outpost, play continues 9... Nfd7 10. Nxd7 Nxd7 11. Nd2 0-0 12. 0-0 Rc8 13. e4. By diverting the black knight on move 9 it is now White who has achieved his central pawn break first. The effect of Black&#x27;s check 5...Bb4+ has been to lure White&#x27;s bishop to c3 where it blocks the c-file. This, the current main line of the Queen&#x27;s Indian, is considered equal by theory and became a frequent guest in grandmaster praxis in the 1980s.

After 5. b3, Black also has several playable alternatives to 5...Bb4+, the most common of which is 5... Bb7 6. Bg2 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 a5. When White plays Nc3, Black will exchange bishop for knight in order to enhance his control over the central light squares, and play on the with moves such as ...a5–a4 and ...b5. Other possibilities for Black include 5...d5 and 5...b5.

More recently, several grandmasters, including Alexander Beliavsky, Ni Hua, Veselin Topalov, and Magnus Carlsen, have played 5. Qc2. The idea is to allow Black&#x27;s counterthrust ...c5, the main line running 5... Bb7 6. Bg2 c5. The fashion is for White to sacrifice a pawn with 7. d5, gaining active play. This idea has scored well for White, and new ideas have been cropping up since 2008. The 5.Qc2 lines had previously scored poorly for White according to Emms.

===Old main line: 4...Bb7 ===
The classical main line of the Queen&#x27;s Indian, the most frequently played line from the 1950s until 4...Ba6 became popular in the 1980s, usually continues: 5. Bg2 Be7 6. 0-0 0-0 7. Nc3 Ne4 8. Qc2 Nxc3 9. Qxc3. White has a , but Black has no weaknesses and can choose from a variety of ways to create counterplay, such as 9... c5, 9... f5 or 9... Be4. These lines are well known for their drawish tendencies and 4... Bb7 is nowadays often employed by Black as a drawing weapon. White has tried various deviations from the main line in an attempt to unbalance the play. These include:
*8. Bd2, which defends the knight on c3 and threatens a d4–d5 push.
*7. d5, introduced by Arturo Pomar, and rejuvenated by Lev Polugaevsky&#x27;s continuation 7... exd5 8. Nh4 threatening to regain the pawn on d5 or to play Nf5.
*6. Nc3, which postpones castling in favor of preparing action in the center with the d4–d5 and e2–e4 thrusts.

==Other lines==

===4.a3===
The Petrosian Variation, prepares 5.Nc3 by stopping ...Bb4 pinning the knight. White intends to follow up with Nc3 and e4, building a large pawn center. Black usually responds by contesting the e4-square with ...Bb7 and ...d5. (See Gurevich, 1992, for an extensive analysis.) This variation was often used by Garry Kasparov early in his career.

===4.Nc3===
Black can choose between 4...Bb7 and 4...Bb4.
*4... Bb7
**5. a3 became the more common move order to reach the Petrosian system by the mid-1980s, where White has avoided 4.a3 c5 5.d5 Ba6 and 4.a3 Ba6.
**5. Bg5 is an older line which gives Black good equalizing chances after 5...h6 6.Bh4 g5 7.Bg3 Nh5 8.e3 Nxg3 9.hxg3 Bg7. After 5...Be7, White can play 6.e3 or 6.Qc2.
*4... Bb4 (or the 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Nf3 b6) is a Queen&#x27;s Indian/Nimzo-Indian line. Moves for White include 5.Bg5, 5.e3, and 5.Qb3. 
**After 5. Bg5, Black may play 5...Bb7 or 5...h6.
***5...Bb7 6.e3 h6, White can play 7.Bh4.
***5...h6 6.Bh4 Bb7 (or by transposition 4...Bb7 5.Bg5 h6 6.Bh4 Bb4), White can play 7.e3. The position after 6...g5 7.Bg3 Ne4 8.Qc2 was heavily played and analyzed in the 1980s. 
**After 5. e3, Black usually plays 5...Bb7. White usually plays 6.Bd3 for the Fischer Variation of the Nimzo-Indian (or by transposition 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 b6 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3). White can play 6.e3, then Black usually plays 6...h6, although 6.Nd2 or 6.Qc2 may be better. 
**After 5. Qb3, Black usually plays 5...c5.

===4.e3===
Preparing to develop the and castle , was also a favorite of Tigran Petrosian. This apparently quiet development may lead to complex middlegame play. Black usually replies 4...Bb7, then play may continue 5.Bd3 d5 6.0-0 or 5.Nc3 Bb4, transposing into the Nimzo-Indian Defence.

===4.Bf4===
The Miles Variation, which simply develops the bishop to a good square. Despite some success by its originator, this idea has never been popular.

<text>The Dutch Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:
: 1. 

Black&#x27;s 1...f5 stakes a claim to the e4-square and envisions an attack in the middlegame on White&#x27;s ; however, it also weakens Black&#x27;s kingside to some extent, especially on the e8–h5 diagonal. Like its 1.e4 counterpart, the Sicilian Defence, the Dutch is an aggressive and unbalancing opening, resulting in the lowest percentage of draws among the most common replies to 1.d4. Historically, White has tried many methods to exploit the kingside weaknesses, such as the Staunton Gambit (2.e4) and Korchnoi Attack (2.h3 and 3.g4).

The Dutch has never been a main line against 1.d4 and is rarely seen today in high-level competition, although a number of top players, including Alexander Alekhine, Bent Larsen, Paul Morphy, Miguel Najdorf, Simon Williams, and Hikaru Nakamura have used it with success. Its most notable use may have been in 1951, when both World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik and his challenger, David Bronstein, played it in their 1951 World Championship match.
==History==
Elias Stein (1748–1812), an Alsatian who settled in The Hague, recommended the defence as the best reply to 1.d4 in his 1789 book &quot;Nouvel essai sur le Jeu des échecs, avec des réflexions militaires relatives à ce jeu&quot;.

Siegbert Tarrasch rejected the opening as in his 1931 work &quot;The Game of Chess&quot;, arguing that White should reply with the Staunton Gambit, with White being better after 2.e4 fxe4 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 c6 5.f3 exf3.

==Practitioners==
The Stonewall Dutch enjoyed a resurgence of interest in the 1980s and 1990s, when leading grandmasters (GMs) Artur Yusupov, Sergey Dolmatov, Nigel Short, and Simen Agdestein helped develop the system where Black plays an earlier ...d5 and places his dark-squared bishop on d6. This setup, termed the Modern Stonewall, has remained more popular than the traditional early ...Be7.

Magnus Carlsen has used the Stonewall to score wins against Viswanathan Anand and Fabiano Caruana.

Simon Williams is one of the leading practitioners of the classical Dutch and wrote more than one book on the opening.

==Theory==
White most often fianchettoes the king&#x27;s bishop with g3 and Bg2. Black also sometimes fianchettoes the king&#x27;s bishop with ...g6 and ...Bg7 (the Leningrad Dutch), but may instead the bishop to e7, d6 (after ...d5), or b4 (the latter is most often seen if White plays c4 before castling). Play often runs 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 e6 4.Nf3 (4.Nh3 is also possible, intending Nf4–d3 to control the e5-square) 4...Be7 5.0-0 0-0 6.c4 and now Black chooses between 6...d5 (the characteristic move of the Stonewall), 6...d6, the Ilyin–Zhenevsky Variation (less popular today), or Alekhine&#x27;s move 6...Ne4!? retaining the option of moving the d-pawn either one or two squares.

The opening&#x27;s attacking potential is shown in the Polish Immortal, in which Miguel Najdorf, using the Stonewall Variation, sacrificed all of his to win by checkmate.

==Main variations==
There are many variations and lines, but the following three are considered part of the main theory of the Dutch Defence.

===Leningrad Variation===
In the Leningrad Variation of the Dutch Defence, Black fianchettos the dark-squared bishop. From g7, this bishop will not only be a good defender of the king, but also an active piece on the .

The game may proceed 1.d4 f5 2.c4 Nf6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.Nc3 0-0 6.Nf3 d6 7.0-0 Qe8. The g2-bishop helps protect White&#x27;s king against Black&#x27;s possible kingside aggression, and this bishop would possibly be blunted by the f5-pawn if it were instead to develop to d3.

The opening code for the Leningrad Variation in the Dutch Defence is A87 to A89 in the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; (&quot;ECO&quot;) classification system:
* A87: Leningrad System
* A88: Leningrad System with ...d6 and ...c6
* A89: Leningrad System with ...d6 and ...Nc6

===Stonewall Variation===
In the Stonewall Dutch, Black plays ...d5 in the opening and secures a tight grip of the e4-square. A possible example is 1.d4 f5 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 e6 4.Nf3 d5 5.c4 c6.

The &quot;ECO&quot; codes for the Stonewall Variation of the Dutch Defence are A90 to A92:
* A90: Stonewall Variation
* A91: Stonewall Variation with Nc3
* A92: Stonewall Variation with c4 and Nc3

===Staunton Gambit===

An aggressive attempt by White to sacrifice a pawn with 2.e4 in exchange for rapid development and attacking chances against Black&#x27;s Dutch setup. Named after Howard Staunton, who introduced it in his match against Bernhard Horwitz. The Staunton Gambit was once a feared attacking line, but it has been out of favour for over 80 years. GM Larry Christiansen and International Master Jeremy Silman have opined that it &quot;offers White equality at best&quot;. 

The &quot;ECO&quot; code for the Staunton Gambit in the Dutch Defence is A83.

==White continuations==

The traditional involves White playing 2.c4. More commonly, White will start with 2.g3. Some common variations are: c4 is played after g3 and Bg2; c4 is played after Nf3; and c4 is played after 0-0.

Examples:
* traditional: 2.c4 Nf6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.Nf3 0-0 6.0-0 d6
* common: 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 g6 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.0-0 0-0 6.c4 d6 ()

===Other second moves===
White has various more aggressive alternatives to the standard moves, including: 
* 2.Nc3 Nf6 (or 2...d5) 3.Bg5, the Raphael Variation 
* 2.Bg5, the Hopton Attack; e.g. 2...Nf6 (2...g6 is the most popular move) 3.Bxf6 exf6 4.e3 or e4
* 2.Bf4 or 2.Nf3 and 3.Bf4, the London System
* 2.g4, the Krejcik Gambit
* 2.e4!?, the Staunton Gambit
* 2.h3 followed by 3.g4, Carl Mayet introduced this completely different gambit approach to the Dutch in 1839 against von der Lasa. Von der Lasa later published analysis of this line in the first edition of the &quot;Handbuch des Schachspiels&quot;. Viktor Korchnoi, one of the world&#x27;s leading players, reintroduced the line into tournament practice in Korchnoi–Känel, Biel 1979. GM Christiansen later concluded, as von der Lasa and Staunton had done over 140 years earlier, that Black could get a good game by declining the gambit with 2...Nf6 3.g4 d5!
* 2.Qd3, the Alapin Variation

Black sometimes starts with the move order 1...e6 to avoid these lines, although Black must then be ready to play the French Defence if White continues 2.e4, rendering the Dutch no longer an option. The Staunton Gambit remains a good choice of opening for White in blitz tournaments where Black has little time to ponder the most accurate defence.

<text>The English Opening is a chess opening that begins with the move:
: 1. 

A flank opening, it is the fourth most popular and, according to various databases, one of the four most successful of White&#x27;s twenty possible first moves. White begins the fight for the by staking a claim to the d5-square from the wing, in hypermodern style. Although many lines of the English have a distinct character, the opening is often used as a transpositional device in much the same way as 1.Nf3 – to avoid such highly regarded responses to 1.d4 as the Nimzo-Indian and Grünfeld Defences – and is considered reliable and flexible.
== History of the opening ==
The English derives its name from the leading 19th-century English master Howard Staunton, who played it during his 1843 match with Saint-Amant and at London 1851, the first international tournament. It did not inspire Staunton&#x27;s contemporaries and caught on only in the twentieth century. It is now recognised as a opening that may be used to reach both classical and hypermodern chess positions. Mikhail Botvinnik, Tigran Petrosian, Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov, Magnus Carlsen, and Ding Liren have employed it during their world championship matches. Bobby Fischer created a stir when he switched to it from his customary 1.e4 late in his career, employing it against Lev Polugaevsky and Oscar Panno at the Palma de Mallorca Interzonal in 1970, and in his world championship match against Boris Spassky.

==Taxonomy==
Opening theoreticians who write on the English Opening divide it into three broad categories, generally determined by Black&#x27;s choice of defensive setup.

===Symmetrical Defence: 1...c5 ===

The Symmetrical Defence (classified A30–39 in &quot;ECO&quot;) is 1...c5, and is so named because both of the c-pawns are advanced two squares, maintaining symmetry. Note that Black can reach the Symmetrical Defence through many move orders by deferring ...c5, and often does. For example, 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 (or 2.Nf3) c5.

Either player may make an early break in the centre with the d-pawn.
Similar to the Open Sicilian, an early d2–d4 for White can arise on the third move in the Symmetrical Defence with 2.Nf3, where Black has chosen one of 2...Nc6, 2...e6, 2...d6, or 2...g6. 

After 3.d4, the game usually continues with 3...cxd4 4.Nxd4. The games can give a large variety of positional and tactical ideas, and can transpose into variants of the Open Sicilian involving the Maróczy Bind, such as the Accelerated Dragon, Taimanov, Kan, or Kalashnikov Variations, if White plays e4 in a later move. If Black manages to play d5 before White plays e4, then the game could transpose into variants of the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined.

When Black plays 2...Nf6, these lines are often called the Anti-Benoni, since these positions are often reached after the transposition 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.Nf3, where White avoided the Benoni Defense that would arise after 3.d5. After 3...cxd4 4.Nxd4, Black could follow up with 4...e5 forcing White&#x27;s knight to go to the queenside and avoiding the transpositions to the Sicilian or the QGD; however, White could avoid the line by first playing 3.Nc3 and then play 4.d4, if Black doesn&#x27;t play 3...d5 (see below). Same as above, the position could transpose into a Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined or an Open Sicilian involving the Maróczy Bind. 
*With 2.e3 Nf6, the position transposes into a Panov–Botvinnik Attack after 3.d4 cxd4 4.exd4 d5. Alternatively, the position could transpose into a Tarrasch Defense in the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined. 
*A typical line of play where Black plays an early ...d5 is 1.c4 c5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Nf3 d5, when White usually trades off in the centre 4.cxd5 Nxd5. White can either challenge the centre with 5.d4 or 5.e4 or allow Black a advantage in the centre with 5.g3. In the latter case, Black can play 5...Nc6 6.Bg2 Nc7 followed by 7...e5, reaching a reversed Maróczy Bind position called the Rubinstein System.

There are several types of positions that can arise from the Symmetrical Defence. Among the ideas are:
*The Hedgehog system involves a solid but flexible defence in which Black develops by b6, e6, Bb7, and Be7, before controlling the fifth rank with moves such as a6 and d6. The game typically involves extended maneuvering, but both players need to be on the lookout for favourable pawn advances and .
*The double fianchetto defence involves Black developing both bishops by fianchetto to g7 and b7. The line is fairly solid and difficult to defeat at the grandmaster level. Some lines are considered highly drawish, for instance if White&#x27;s bishops are also fianchettoed to g2 and b2 there may be many piece exchanges leading to a simplified and equal position.

===Reversed Sicilian: 1...e5 ===

The Reversed Sicilian (classified A20–29 in ) is another broad category of defence, introduced by the response 1...e5. Note again, that Black can delay playing ...e5, for example 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.Nf3 e5 whereupon even though ...e5 has been delayed, once it is played the defence is classified as a Reversed Sicilian.

After 1...e5, White has Black&#x27;s position in the Sicilian but with an extra tempo. This is often called the Reversed Sicilian, though others call it the King&#x27;s English. Bruce Leverett, writing the English chapter in &quot;MCO-14&quot;, stated, &quot;It is natural to treat the English as a Sicilian reversed, but the results are often surprising—main lines in the Sicilian Defence correspond to obscure side variations in the English, and vice versa.&quot;

===Other lines===
The third broad category consists of the non-...e5 and non-...c5 responses, classified A10–19 in &quot;ECO&quot;. Most often these defences consist of Nf6, e6, and d5 or Bb4 systemic responses by Black, or a Slav-like system consisting of c6 and d5, a direct King&#x27;s Indian Defence setup with Nf6, g6, Bg7, 0-0, after which c5 and e5 are eschewed, or 1...f5, which usually transposes to a Dutch Defence once White plays d4. All irregular responses such as 1...b6 and 1...g5 are also lumped into this third broad category.
*1...Nf6 is the most common response to 1.c4, often played to arrive at an Indian Defence. More than half the time, however, Black subsequently elects to transpose into either a Symmetrical Defence with ...c5, or a Reversed Sicilian with ...e5.
*1...e6 (the Agincourt Defense) can lead to a Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined after 2.Nc3 d5 3.d4, but White often prefers 2.Nf3, which may lead to a variety of openings.
*1...f5 leads to a Dutch Defence when White follows up with d4. Other choices for White are 2.Nc3, 2.Nf3, and 2.g3, where Black usually plays ...Nf6.
*1...g6 may lead to a Modern Defense, or after Nf6 and d6 or d5 to the King&#x27;s Indian Defence or the Grünfeld Defence, respectively, or stay within English lines. Often dubbed the Great Snake Variation.
*1...c6 can lead to a Slav Defense after 2.d4 d5, but White will often prefer a Caro–Kann Defence with 2.e4 d5, or a Réti Opening after 2.Nf3 d5 3.b3. 1.c4 c6 2.d4 d6 is the Anglo-Slav Opening.
*1...b6 is the English Defence. This setup involves the fianchetto of the queenside bishop and 2...e6. Often Black will defer the move Nf6, choosing to attack the centre with f5 and/or Qh4. The English grandmasters Tony Miles and Jonathan Speelman have successfully used this opening.
*1...d5 is the Anglo-Scandinavian Defense. Thought of as inferior to the Scandinavian Defense due to exchanging the c-pawn for a center pawn, in addition to the Scandinavian already having a somewhat suspect reputation. 
*1...g5 is an eccentric response known as Myers&#x27; Defense after Hugh Myers&#x27;s advocacy of it in print and actual play. It is intended as an improved Grob&#x27;s Attack; after 2.d4, Black will put pressure on the d4-square with moves such as ...Bg7, ...c5, and ...Qb6. According to &quot;Nunn&#x27;s Chess Openings&quot;, White obtains a small advantage after 2.d4 Bg7 (offering a Grob-like : 3.Bxg5 c5) 3.Nc3 h6 4.e4. Myers recommended 3...c5 (instead of 3...h6); in response, Joel Benjamin advocates 4.dxc5
*1...b5 is called the Jaenisch Gambit after Carl Jaenisch. Black obtains no immediate compensation for the sacrificed pawn.

==Transposition potential==
If White plays an early d4, the game will usually transpose into either the Queen&#x27;s Gambit or an Indian Defence.
For example, after 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 g6 3.d4 d5 the game has transposed into the Grünfeld Defence, usually reached by the move order 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5.

White can, however, also play 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 g6 3.e4, making it impossible for Black to reach a Grünfeld, instead more or less forcing them into lines of the King&#x27;s Indian Defence with 3...d6. Black also cannot force a Grünfeld with 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 d5, since White can deviate with 3.cxd5 Nxd5 4.g3, a line played several times by Mikhail Botvinnik in 1958, in his final match for the world championship with Vasily Smyslov.

Instead of playing an early d4, White can also play Nf3 and fianchetto the (g3 and Bg2), transposing into a Réti Opening.

Also, after 1.c4 c6, White can transpose into the Polish Opening, Outflank Variation, by playing 2.b4, which can be used as a surprise weapon if Black does not know very much about the Polish Opening.

The many different transpositional possibilities available to White make the English a slippery opening for Black to defend against, and make it necessary for them to consider carefully what move order to employ. For instance, if Black would like to play a Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined (QGD), the most accurate move order to do so is 1...e6 2.d4 d5. (Of course, White can again play the Réti instead with 2.Nf3 d5 3.b3.) If Black plays instead 1...Nf6 2.Nc3 e6, White can avoid the QGD by playing 3.e4, the Flohr–Mikenas Attack.

==Depiction in cinema==
The English Opening is used by Professor Moriarty in the film &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot; as he and Holmes discuss their competing plans over a game of chess. Both Holmes and Moriarty eventually play the final moves blindfolded by citing out the last moves in descriptive notation (rather than algebraic, as the former was contemporary in the late 19th century), ending in Holmes checkmating Moriarty, just as Watson foils Moriarty&#x27;s plans.

1.c4 is also used in &quot;Pawn Sacrifice&quot; by Bobby Fischer in the climactic game six of the 1972 World Chess Championship versus Boris Spassky.

<doc id="498041" wikidata="Q965731" url="?curid=498041" title="California Academy of Sciences">
<text>The California Academy of Sciences is a research institute and natural history museum in San Francisco, California, that is among the largest museums of natural history in the world, housing over 46 million specimens. The academy began in 1853 as a learned society and still carries out a large amount of original research. The institution is located at the Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.

Completely rebuilt in 2008, the academy&#x27;s primary building in Golden Gate Park covers . In early 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic, the California Academy of Sciences had around 500 employees and an annual revenue of about $33 million.

The museum is accessible via public transit on the N Judah Metro line. The westbound 9th Avenue and Irving station is located about 0.5 miles from the Academy of Sciences. Three Muni bus lines also serve the museum, the 44, 5, and 7 lines.

==Governance==
The California Academy of Sciences, California&#x27;s oldest operating museum and research institution for the natural sciences, is governed by a 41-member board of trustees who are nominated and chosen by the California Academy of Sciences Fellows. The Academy Fellows are, in turn, &quot;[n]ominated by their colleagues and appointed by the Board of Trustees...the Fellows remain members of the Fellowship for life.&quot; The board of trustees is then responsible for appointing the executive management of the academy, who in turn are responsible for overseeing the academy&#x27;s overall operation and the hiring of its other managers and employees.

===Institute for Biodiversity Science and Sustainability (IBSS)===
Besides its function as a source of public science education through its museum, the California Academy of Sciences also operates the Institute for Biodiversity Science and Sustainability (IBSS) as its research arm, conducting research in the fields of taxonomy, phylogenetics, and biodiversity studies. Although one aspect of the IBSS is available for viewing by museum patrons at the science &quot;project lab&quot; exhibit, most of the research happens in laboratories and facilities, &quot;behind the scenes&quot;, and not observable by the public. In fact, unbeknownst to most patrons, research and administrative facilities occupy nearly 50% of the Academy&#x27;s physical structure.

==Exhibits==
The main thrust of the exhibits is natural history. The venues of the museum include the following:
*Kimball Natural History Museum – generally encompasses the entire museum outside the planetarium, rainforest, and aquarium, and includes Africa Hall (the Academy&#x27;s oldest running exhibit), the East Wing (includes a Foucault pendulum, also a carry-over exhibit from the older, pre-2008 renovation of the Academy), the West Wing (which housed several geophysical exhibits), as well as several smaller exhibits distributed throughout the remainder of the Academy building.

==Research==
Academy scientists, under the Academy&#x27;s Institute for Biodiversity Science and Sustainability, conduct systematic and conservation research in several different fields, including anthropology, marine biology, botany, entomology, herpetology, ichthyology, invertebrate zoology, mammalogy, ornithology, geology, and paleontology. There also is a strong emphasis on environmental concerns, with all the various departments collaborating closely to focus on systematic biology and biodiversity. Academy researchers study life around the world: a 2011 expedition to the Philippines discovered an estimated 300 species new to science. There is also research pertaining to new technology being used by the general public. Mushroom identification applications were being used which may have caused an increase of poisonings. To combat this Academy researchers studied the accuracies of three of the most popular applications. The Academy publishes the peer-reviewed journal &quot;Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences&quot;, as well as &quot;Occasional Papers&quot;, &quot;Memoirs&quot;, and &quot;Special Publications&quot;.

==History==
===Early years===
The &quot;California Academy of Natural Sciences&quot; was founded in 1853, only three years after California joined the United States, becoming the first society of its kind in the Western US. Its stated aim was to undertake &quot;a thorough systematic survey of every portion of the State and the collection of a cabinet of her rare and rich productions.&quot; It was renamed as the more inclusive &quot;California Academy of Sciences&quot; in 1868.

The academy had a forward-thinking view towards women in science, passing a resolution in its first year that the members &quot;highly approve of the aid of females in every department of natural science, and invite their cooperation.&quot; This policy led to several women being hired into professional positions as botanists, entomologists, and other occupations during the 19th century, when opportunities for women in the sciences were limited, and often, those that existed were restricted to menial cataloging and calculation work. In 1892, Alice Eastwood, a botanist, was hired by the academy and worked there until she retired in 1949. She created the collection of rare plants, which was saved when the academy was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake

The academy&#x27;s first official museum opened in 1874 at the corner of California and Dupont Streets (now Grant Avenue) in what is now Chinatown, and drew up to 80,000 visitors a year. To accommodate its increasing popularity, the academy moved to a new and larger building on Market Street in 1891, funded by the legacy of James Lick, a 19th-century San Francisco real estate mogul, entrepreneur, and philanthropist.

However, only fifteen years later, the Market Street facility fell victim to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and three days of fire, which also wiped out all but a wheelbarrow full of the academy&#x27;s library and specimen collections. In the widespread destruction occurring in the aftermath of the quake, academy curators and staffers only were able to retrieve a single cart of materials, including academy minute books, membership records, and 2,000 type specimens. The 1905–1906 scientific collecting expedition to the Galápagos Islands (the first of several sponsored by the academy to the archipelago) already was underway, and it returned seven months later, providing replacement collections for those lost.

===Golden Gate Park site===
In 1916, the Academy moved to the North American Hall of Birds and Mammals in Golden Gate Park, the first building on the site that was to become its permanent home. In 1923, the Steinhart Aquarium was added, followed in 1934 by the Simson African Hall.

During World War II, the Academy contributed to the American war effort by using its workshop facilities to repair optical and navigational equipment for United States Navy ships; San Francisco was a major port for the Pacific War arena.

The post-war years saw a flurry of new construction on the site; the Science Hall was added in 1951, followed by the Morrison Planetarium in 1952. The Morrison Planetarium was the seventh major planetarium to open in the United States and featured a one-of-a-kind star projector, built by Academy staff members (in part using the expertise gained doing the optical work for the US Navy during World War II). The Academy Projector projected irregularly shaped stars, rather than the circular stars projected by many optical star projectors. The irregular shapes were created by placing variously sized grains of silicon carbide onto the glass star plates by hand, then aluminizing the plates, and brushing away the silicon carbide grains.

In 1959, the Malliard Library, Eastwood Hall of Botany, and Livermore Room all were added. Throughout the 1960s, universities concentrating on the new field of molecular biology divested themselves of their traditional specimen collections, entrusting them to the academy and leading to a rapid growth of the Academy&#x27;s holdings.

In 1969, another new building, Cowell Hall, was added to the site. In 1976, several new galleries were opened, and the following year, in 1977, the &quot;fish roundabout&quot; was constructed.

Before the old building being torn down in 2005, there was a &quot;Life through Time&quot; gallery, housing a large display on evolution and paleontology. There was a Gem and Mineral Hall, a section on Earthquakes, and a Gary Larson exhibit.

===Earthquake damage and new building===

The academy buildings were damaged significantly in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Subsequently, the Bird Hall building was closed to ensure public safety. The inadequately engineered Steinhart Aquarium suffered dramatic seismic damage from the 1989 earthquake, as well.

As plans were made to repair the damage and make the buildings seismically stable, it was realized that a considerable amount of work would be needed to bring the buildings up to modern standards. This led to the idea of giving the academy a complete overhaul, thus motivating the closing of the main site.

Construction began on the new $500 million building on September 12, 2005, while the exhibits were moved to 875 Howard Street for a temporary museum.

The academy reopened with a free day on September 27, 2008. For most of the day, the line for admittance was over a mile (nearly two kilometers) long, and although over 15,000 people were admitted, several thousands more had to be turned away.

In May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Academy announced that it would lay off 105 of its then 504 employees, furlough 96 others, and enact pay cuts among part of the rest. Due to the COVID-19 lockdown&#x27;s effect on ticket sales, the organization was expecting its revenue to decrease by around $12 million (36%) in the next fiscal year.

==Environmental design of new building==
The design architect for the museum replacement project was Renzo Piano. His design was awarded the Urban Land Institute (ULI) Award for Excellence for the Americas region in 2008, as well as the Holcim Award Silver for sustainable construction projects in the North America region in 2005. One critic praised the building as a &quot;blazingly uncynical embrace of the Enlightenment values of truth and reason&quot;, and a &quot;comforting reminder of the civilizing function of great art in a barbaric age&quot;.

The new building emphasizes environmentally friendly design, in keeping with the academy&#x27;s focus on ecological concerns and environmental sustainability. It received Platinum certification under the LEED program. This project was featured on the Discovery Channel &quot;Extreme Engineering&quot; series in 2006, the National Geographic Channel &quot;Man-Made&quot; series in July 2008, and Smithsonian Channel&#x27;s &quot;How Do They Build That?&quot; in August 2022.

The new building includes an array of environmentally friendly features:
*Produces 50 percent less waste water than previously
*Recycles rainwater for irrigation
*Uses 60,000 photovoltaic cells
*Supports a green roof with an area of 
*Uses natural lighting in 90 percent of occupied spaces
*Was constructed of over of recycled concrete
*Construction includes 11 million pounds (5,000 t) of recycled steel
*Wall insulation made from scraps of recycled denim

===Green roof===

The California Academy of Sciences green roof has several environmentally friendly features and a sustainable design. Renzo Piano was inspired by seven major hills of San Francisco, which typically refers to: Telegraph Hill, Nob Hill, Russian Hill, Rincon Hill, Mount Sutro, Twin Peaks and Mount Davidson. The living green roof was planted with 1.7 million California native plants. The museum&#x27;s central piazza lies beneath a massive glass ceiling on the roof, which opens to allow cool night air to flow into the building below; by using this kind of natural ventilation instead of air conditioning to regulate interior temperature, the building becomes more energy efficient. Renzo Piano and SWA Group won the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) Award in design in 2009.

<doc id="498053" wikidata="Q547649" url="?curid=498053" title="Genoa (sail)">
<text>A genoa sail is a type of large jib or staysail that extends past the mast and so overlaps the main sail when viewed from the side, sometimes eliminating it.
It was originally called an &quot;overlapping jib&quot; and later a genoa jib. It is used on single-masted sloops and twin-masted boats such as yawls and ketches. Its larger surface area increases the speed of the craft in light to moderate winds; in high wind, a smaller jib is usually substituted, and downwind a spinnaker may be used.

==Definition==

The term &quot;jib&quot; is the generic term for any of an assortment of &quot;headsails&quot;. The term &quot;genoa&quot; (or genny) refers to a type of jib that is larger than 100% of the foretriangle, which is the triangular area formed by the point at which the stay intersects the mast, and deck or bowsprit, and the line where the mast intersects deck at the rail. Colloquially the term is sometimes used interchangeably with &quot;jib&quot;. A working jib is no larger than 100% of the foretriangle. A genoa is larger, with the leech going past the mast and overlapping the mainsail. To maximize sail area, the foot of the sail is generally parallel and very close to the deck when close hauled. 

Genoas are categorized by a percentage representing their area relative to 100% of the foretriangle. Sail racing classes often specify a limit to genoa size. Genoas are classified by their size; a modern number 1 genoa would typically be approximately 155%, but historically number 1 genoas have been as large as 180%. Number 2 genoas are generally in the range of 125–140%. Working jibs are also defined by the same measure, typically 100% or less of the foretriangle. Under Performance Handicap Racing Fleet rules, most boats are allowed 155% genoas without a penalty.

==Handling issues==
Maximizing the sail area can cause more difficult handling. It may be harder to tack a genoa than a jib, since the overlapping area can become fouled among the shrouds and/or mast unless carefully tended during the tack. Genoas are very popular in some racing classes, since they count only the foretriangle area when calculating foresail size; a genoa allows a significant increase in actual sail area within the calculated sail area. In boats where sail restrictions do not apply, genoas of 180% overlap can be found, although those over 150% are rare because the additional area is shadowed by the mainsail when close hauled and generates diminishing returns in terms of power per actual sail area.

==The gennaker==
The gennaker has been around for several decades now, and as the name suggests, it is a hybrid between a genoa and a symmetrical spinnaker. A brand name of North Sails, the gennaker started as a cruising sail based on the &quot;Code 0&quot; spinnakers used on racing boats. Gennakers and similar code 0 variants offered by other makers are even larger than genoas (200% overlaps are not uncommon), and they have a much greater camber for generating larger amounts of lift when reaching. Flat-cut gennakers can be effective for angles as low as 60–70 degrees. Spinnakers perform much better when running because the main sail blocks the wind of gennaker above 135–150 degrees.

== History ==

The famous Swedish sailor and shipowner Sven Salén (1890–1969) first used the genoa on his 6 m R-yacht &quot;May-Be&quot; by the 1926 in Coppa del Tirreno in Genoa, hence the name. He successfully used it during the Scandinavian Gold Cup&#x27;s races of 1927 in Oyster Bay (US). Sven Salén also pioneered the parachute spinnacre. 

A similar type of jib was in use for centuries by the fishermen in the Netherlands with their Botter type ships. The fishermen relied on the combination of a large jib while fishing so the mainsail could remain unused. After fishing the fisherman&#x27;s jib helped to get the fish to markets fast.

A correct explanation of the interaction between jib and mainsail was published by aerodynamicist and yachtsman Arvel Gentry in 1981, and &quot;is much more complicated than the old theories imply&quot;. This states that the widely believed explanation of the slot effect is &quot;completely wrong&quot; and shows that this is not due to the venturi effect (or &quot;valve effect&quot; to use Curry&#x27;s term) accelerating the air in the slot. Instead it is shown that the air in the slot is slowed and its pressure increased reducing the tendency of the mainsail to stall, that the mainsail reduces the air pressure on the lee side of the jib accelerating that airflow, and that the mainsail increases the angle at which the air meets the luff of the jib, allowing the boat to point higher. Gentry points out that proper understanding of sail interaction allows better sail trimming.

<text>Susan Tyrrell (born Susan Jillian Creamer; March 18, 1945 – June 16, 2012) was an American character actress. Tyrrell&#x27;s career began in theater in New York City in the 1960s in Broadway and off Broadway productions. Her first film was &quot;Shoot Out&quot; (1971). She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Oma in John Huston&#x27;s &quot;Fat City&quot; (1972). In 1978, Tyrrell received the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in &quot;Andy Warhol&#x27;s Bad&quot; (1977). Her &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary described her as &quot;a whiskey-voiced character actress (with) talent for playing the downtrodden, outré, and grotesque.&quot;

==Early life==
Tyrrell was born in San Francisco, California, to a British mother, Gillian (née Tyrrell; 1913–2012), and an American father, John Belding Creamer. Her mother was a socialite and member of the diplomatic corps in China and the Philippines during the 1930s and 1940s. Her father John was an agent with the William Morris Agency who represented Leo Carrillo, Loretta Young, Ed Wynn, and Carole Lombard. 

Tyrrell spent her childhood in New Canaan, Connecticut. She was a poor student and as a teenager became estranged from her mother. Through her father&#x27;s connections, Tyrrell was employed in the theatrical production of &quot;Time Out for Ginger&quot; (1963) starring Art Carney in New York City. Her father also persuaded &quot;Look&quot; magazine to follow her as she toured with the show, but he died shortly afterwards.

==Career==

Tyrrell made her Broadway debut in 1965 as a replacement performer in the comedy &quot;Cactus Flower&quot;. In 1968, as a member of the Repertory Theatre of Lincoln Center, she was in the cast of &quot;King Lear&quot; and revivals of &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot; (1969) and &quot;Camino Real&quot; (1970). Off-Broadway, Tyrrell appeared in the 1967 premiere of Lanford Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Rimers of Eldritch&quot; and a 1979 production of &quot;Father&#x27;s Day (play)&quot; at The American Place Theatre.

Tyrrell&#x27;s television debut was in &quot;Mr. Novak&quot; (1964) and her film debut was in &quot;Shoot Out&quot; (1971). Tyrrell was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Oma in John Huston&#x27;s &quot;Fat City&quot; (1972). In 1976, she played a psychotic character in &quot;I Never Promised You A Rose Garden&quot;. In 1978, she won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in &quot;Bad. 

Later, Tyrrell starred as Queen Doris in the indie &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; (1980). She sang the film&#x27;s song, &quot;Witch&#x27;s Egg&quot;. A year later, she portrayed Vera in &quot;Tales of Ordinary Madness&quot; (1981). From 1981 to 1982, Tyrrell starred as Gretchen Feester, in the ABC&#x27;s short-lived situation comedy series &quot;Open All Night&quot;. She then had a starring role in the exploitation horror film &quot;Butcher, Baker, Nightmare Maker&quot; (1981).

In 1983, Tyrrell played Solly in the sexploitation film &quot;Angel&quot; and its 1984 sequel, &quot;Avenging Angel&quot;. Then followed roles in the adventure film &quot;Flesh+Blood&quot;, the Vincent Price anthology horror film &quot;From a Whisper to a Scream&quot; (1987), the animated feature film &quot;The Chipmunk Adventure&quot; (1987), and &quot;Big Top Pee-wee&quot; (the 1988 sequel to 1985&#x27;s &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;). Tyrrell took a supporting role in John Waters&#x27; &quot;Cry-Baby&quot; (1990).

In 1992, she guest starred on an episode of Wings &quot;Marriage Italian Style&quot; and she performed her own one-woman show, &quot;Susan Tyrrell: My Rotten Life, a Bitter Operetta&quot;. In the late 1990s, Tyrrell had roles in the &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; episode &quot;Comes the Dawn&quot; (1995), the animated series &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot; (1997), and the psychological thriller film &quot;Buddy Boy&quot; (1999).

In the 2000s, Tyrrell appeared in Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Masked and Anonymous&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Due at Midnight&quot; (2004). Her final appearance was in the 2012 independent film &quot;Kid-Thing&quot;.

==Personal life==
Tyrrell moved to New York City in the early 1960s to focus on theater work, for the first time meeting and socializing with openly LGBT people. The artistic crowd of &quot;New York freaks&quot; she associated with included &quot;Andy Warhol people&quot;, among them Candy Darling, with whom Tyrrell had a relationship and shared an apartment.

In the mid-1970s, Tyrrell had a two-year relationship with actor Hervé Villechaize and shared a home with him in the Laurel Canyon area of Los Angeles.

Tyrrell had two brief marriages and no children. In 1981 she told an interviewer that she had decided on tubal ligation surgery, &quot;to ensure that no actors come out of me.&quot;

Tyrrell suffered from essential thrombocytosis, a disease of the blood. In early 2000, her disease necessitated bilateral below-knee amputations. That year, Johnny Depp hosted a benefit at the Viper Room to help defray Tyrrell&#x27;s medical bills. Megan Mullally, Jack Black, and Chloe Webb attended.

In 2008, Tyrrell moved to Austin, Texas, to be closer to her niece. In January 2012, Tyrrell wrote in her journal, &quot;I demand my death be joyful and I never return again.&quot; She died on June 16, 2012, in Austin. She was cremated and her ashes scattered.

<text>The flag of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic was adopted by the Georgian SSR on April 11, 1951.

It was the only Union Republic flag in which the hammer and sickle was not gold in colour, instead being red.

==History==
Before 1937 the flag was red with the Georgian characters სსსრ (&quot;SSSR&quot;) in gold in the top-left corner.

Between 1922 and 1937, the flag was red, with the Cyrillic characters &quot;ССРГ&quot; (&quot;SSRG&quot;) in the top left-hand corner.

Between 1937 and the adoption of the above flag in the 1940s, the flag was red, with the Georgian characters საქართველოს სსრ (&quot;Sakartvelos SSR&quot;) in gold in the top-left corner.

The 1951 flag fell into disuse in November 1990 when the flag based on the Democratic Republic of Georgia was introduced until the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which was replaced again in 2004 by the current flag.

<text>Henry Warington Smyth Baden-Powell KC (3 February 1847 – 24 April 1921), known as Warington, was a British admiralty lawyer, master mariner and canoeist. He wrote a book on Sea Scouting and held positions in The Boy Scouts Association, formed by his brother, Robert Baden-Powell.

== Life ==

He was born Henry Warington Powell in New College Lane, Oxford; the son of Reverend Professor Baden Powell, who held the Savilian Chair of Geometry at the University of Oxford from 1827 to 1860.

His mother, a gifted musician and artist, was Henrietta Grace Smyth, the third wife of Baden Powell (the previous two having died). She was the elder daughter of William Henry Smyth and his wife Annarella.

Warington was the eldest child of the marriage, his siblings were George Baden-Powell, Robert Baden-Powell, Frank Baden-Powell, Agnes Baden-Powell, and Baden Baden-Powell. Warington was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, London, which he entered in 1857. In 1860, his father died, following which his mother changed the family surname from Powell to Baden-Powell in his memory.

In 1861, aged 14, Warington joined the training ship HMS &quot;Conway&quot; as a cadet. He completed his training there in 1864 with a creditable Double Extra Certificate, and then accompanied his uncle, Captain Henry Toynbee, on a voyage on the East Indiaman, &quot;Hotspur&quot;. Following that, he joined the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company as a 4th officer. Early in his career he qualified as a Master Mariner and was commissioned a Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve. Being the eldest son made Warington financially responsible for maintaining his mother&#x27;s household, which was probably his motivation for leaving the sea in 1873 and starting legal training. He was called to the Bar in Trinity Term 1876, being admitted as a barrister of the Inner Temple. He was later admitted to the Admiralty Bar and became a member of several important organizations focused on the sea. He was appointed a King&#x27;s Counsel (KC) on 24 December 1897. On 13 September 1913, Warington married New Zealand-born Cicely Hilda Farmer (known as Hilda) at All Saints, Knightsbridge. He had been secretly engaged to Hilda for nearly twenty years.

He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society (FRGS). He also held membership in The Shipwrights&#x27; Company, the Yacht Racing Association and the Athenaeum Club. He was elected an Associate of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects in 1889.
Warington died from tuberculosis, in Chelsea on 4 April 1921 but is buried in the Eastern Cemetery at St Andrews in Fife on the upper terrace, in his wife&#x27;s family plot. A portrait can be found on the Internet.

== Canoe sailing ==
From his childhood, Warington Baden-Powell had been an enthusiastic sailor of small boats and later became a pioneer of sailing canoes, which he designed himself based on the &quot;Rob-Roy&quot; type of hybrid canoe-kayaks which had been built by John &quot;Rob Roy&quot; MacGregor. In July 1869, accompanied by a companion known only as &quot;H&quot;, possibly his brother Baden Henry, Warington undertook a canoeing expedition in the Baltic Sea, and published an account of his adventures in 1871. He was an early member and promoter of the Royal Canoe Club which he had joined in 1874. By the late 1870s, sailing canoes were taking part in organised racing, and providing keen amateur sport at reasonable cost at a time when yachting was an activity for the wealthy.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition mentions him in the &#x27;Canoe&#x27; entry:
In 1872, Warington took his brothers, including the 15 year-old Robert, on an expedition by canoe up the Thames to its source and then on to the River Severn and the River Wye. There followed several other family expeditions in southern England which made a deep impression on Robert, who later recalled that Warington had &quot;infused so much jollity and romance into that early sea-training that it gripped me from the first&quot;.

In 1886, the American Canoe Association challenged the Royal Canoe Club to a sailing race and accordingly, Warington travelled to the United States with Walter Stewart and their canoes for the ACA annual meet at the Thousand Islands in the Saint Lawrence River. However, the heavy British general-purpose cruising canoes were beaten by the Americans who had developed specialised racing boats.

== Sea Scouts ==

His brother, Robert, asked him to write a manual for Sea Scouts. He devised a training scheme with The Boy Scouts Association&#x27;s Chief Sea Scout, Lord Charles Beresford and, in June 1912, his book, &quot;Sea Scouting and Seamanship for Boys&quot; was published. Warington admitted, in his book&#x27;s preface, that the book could provide only an overview of boating skills required. His book remained in print until 1949.

In 2011, a Sea Scout Group of the Portuguese &quot;Corpo Nacional de Escutas&quot; based in The Azores, named their 16-metre sailing yacht &quot; Almirante Warrington Baden-Powell&quot; in his honour. In 2012, a bronze bust of Warington was unveiled by Edward Baden-Powell, the great-grandson of Sir George Baden-Powell, at The Scout Association&#x27;s national headquarters at Gilwell Park in Essex.

<doc id="498075" wikidata="Q7077574" url="?curid=498075" title="Ode on Indolence">
<text>The &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot; is one of five odes composed by English poet John Keats in the spring of 1819. The others were &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;, &quot;Ode on Melancholy&quot;, &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; and &quot;Ode to Psyche&quot;. The poem describes the state of indolence, a word which is synonymous with &quot;avoidance&quot; or &quot;laziness&quot;. The work was written during a time when Keats was presumably more than usually occupied with his material prospects. After finishing the spring poems, Keats wrote in June 1819 that its composition brought him more pleasure than anything else he had written that year. Unlike the other odes he wrote that year, &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot; was not published until 1848, 27 years after his death.

The poem is an example of Keats&#x27;s break from the structure of the classical form. It follows the poet&#x27;s contemplation of a morning spent in idleness. Three figures are presented—Ambition, Love and Poesy—dressed in &quot;placid sandals&quot; and &quot;white robes&quot;. The narrator examines each using a series of questions and statements on life and art. The poem concludes with the narrator giving up on having all three of the figures as part of his life. Some critics regard &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot; as inferior to the other four 1819 odes. Others suggest that the poem exemplifies a continuity of themes and imagery characteristic of his more widely read works, and provides valuable biographical insight into his poetic career.

==Background==
By the spring of 1819, Keats had left his poorly paid position as a surgeon at Guy&#x27;s Hospital, Southwark, London, to devote himself to poetry. On 12 May 1819, he abandoned this plan after receiving a request for financial assistance from his brother, George. Unable to help, Keats was torn by guilt and despair and sought projects more lucrative than poetry. It was under these circumstances that he wrote &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot;.

In a letter to his brother dated 19 March 1819, Keats discussed indolence as a subject. He may have written the ode as early as March, but the themes and stanza forms suggest May or June 1819; when it is known he was working on &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;, &quot;Ode on Melancholy&quot;, &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; and &quot;Ode to Psyche&quot;. During this period, Keats&#x27;s friend Charles Armitage Brown transcribed copies of the spring odes and submitted them to publisher Richard Woodhouse. Keats wrote to his friend Sarah Jeffrey: &quot;[T]he thing I have most enjoyed this year has been writing an ode to Indolence.&quot; Despite this enjoyment, however, he was not entirely satisfied with &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot;, and it remained unpublished until 1848.

Keats&#x27;s notes and papers do not reveal the precise dating of the 1819 odes. Literary scholars have proposed several different orders of composition, arguing that the poems form a sequence within their structures. In &quot;The Consecrated Urn&quot;, Bernard Blackstone observes that &quot;Indolence&quot; has been variously thought the first, second, and final of the five 1819 odes. Biographer Robert Gittings suggests &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot; was written on 4 May 1819, based upon Keats&#x27;s report about the weather during the ode&#x27;s creation; Douglas Bush insists it was written after &quot;Nightingale&quot;, &quot;Grecian Urn&quot;, and &quot;Melancholy&quot;. Based on his examination of the stanza forms, Keats biographer Andrew Motion thinks &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot; was written after &quot;Ode to Psyche&quot; and &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;, although he admits there is no way to be precise about the dates. Nevertheless, he argues that &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot; was probably composed last.

==Structure==
&quot;Ode on Indolence&quot; relies on ten line stanzas with a rhyme scheme that begins with a Shakespearian quatrain (ABAB) and ends with a Miltonic sestet (CDECDE). This pattern is used in &quot;Ode on Melancholy&quot;, &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; and &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;, which further unifies the poems in their structure in addition to their themes.

The poem contains a complicated use of assonance (the repetition of vowel sounds), as evident in line 19, &quot;O why did ye not melt, and leave my sense&quot;, where the pairs &quot;ye&quot;/&quot;leave&quot; and &quot;melt&quot;/&quot;sense&quot; share vowel sounds. A more disorganized use of assonance appears in line 31, &quot;A third time pass&#x27;d they by, and, passing, turn&#x27;d&quot;, in which the pairs &quot;third&quot;/&quot;turn&#x27;d&quot;, &quot;time&quot;/&quot;by&quot;, and &quot;pass&#x27;d&quot;/&quot;passing&quot; share vowel sounds. The third line exemplifies the poem&#x27;s consistent iambic pentameter scansion:

Keats occasionally inverts the accent of the first two syllables of each line or a set of syllables within the middle of a line. 2.3% of the internal syllables are inverted in the &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot;, whereas only 0.4% of the internal syllables of his other poems contain such inversions.

==Poem==
The poem relies on a first-person narration style similar to &quot;Ode to Psyche&quot;. It begins with a classical scene from an urn in a similar manner to &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;, but the scene in &quot;Indolence&quot; is allegorical. The opening describes three figures that operate as three fates:
The figures remain mysterious as they circle around the narrator. Eventually they turn towards him and it is revealed that they are Ambition, Love, and Poesy, the themes of the poem:
The poet wishes to be with the three figures, but he is unable to join them. The poem transitions into the narrator providing reasons why he would not need the three figures and does so with ambition and love, but he cannot find a reason to dismiss poesy:
Concluding the poem, the narrator argues that the figures should be treated as figures, and that he would not be misled by them:
==Themes==
The poem centres on humanity and human nature. When the poet sees the figures, he wants to know their names and laments his ignorance. Eventually, he realizes that they are representative of Love, Ambition, and Poetry. While he longs, he fears they are out of reach and therefore tries to reject them. He argues that love is what he needs least and dismisses it by questioning what &quot;love&quot; actually means (&quot;What is Love? and where is it?&quot;). He rejects ambition, but it requires more work (&quot;And for that poor Ambition—it springs / From a man&#x27;s little heart&#x27;s short fever-fit;&quot;). Unlike the personas of Love and Ambition, the narrator is unable to find a reason to banish Poesy (Poetry), which reflects the poets&#x27; inner conflict: should he abandon poetry to focus on a career in which he can earn a decent living? Keats sought to write great poetry but feared his pursuit of literary prominence was based on a delusional view of his own merit as a poet. Further, he was incapable of completing his epic, &quot;Hyperion&quot;. As Walter Jackson Bate explains, to Keats &quot;Neither a finished &#x27;grand Poem&#x27; nor even the semblance of a modest financial return seemed nearer.&quot;

Keats realized that he could never have Love, could not fulfil his Ambition, and could not spend his time with Poesy. The conclusion of &quot;Ode to Indolence&quot; is a dismissal of both the images and his poetry as figures that would only mislead him. Even indolence itself seems unattainable; Andrew Motion writes that the figures force Keats to regard indolence as &quot;the privilege of the leisured class to which he did not belong.&quot; If the poem is read as the final poem in the 1819 ode series, &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot; suggests that Keats is resigned to giving up his career as a poet because poetry cannot give him the immortality he wanted from it. Ironically, the poem provided Keats with such immortality. Besides the biographical component, the poem also describes Keats&#x27;s belief that his works should capture the beauty of art while acknowledging the harshness of life. In this way, the poems as a group capture Keats&#x27;s philosophy of negative capability, the concept of living with unreconciled contradictory views, by trying to reconcile Keats&#x27;s desire to write poetry and his inability to do so by abandoning poetry altogether and accepting life as it is.

Within the many poems that explore this idea—among them Keats&#x27;s and the works by his contemporaries—Keats begins by questioning suffering, breaks it down to its most basic elements of cause and effect, and draws conclusions about the world. His own process is filled with doubt, but his poems end with a hopeful message that the narrator (himself) is finally free of desires for Love, Ambition, and Poesy. The hope contained within &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot; is found within the vision he expresses in the last stanza: &quot;I yet have visions for the night/And for the day faint visions there is store.&quot; Consequently, in her analysis of Keats&#x27; Odes, Helen Vendler suggests that &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot; is a seminal poem constructed with themes and images that appeared more influential in his other, sometimes later, poems. The ode is an early and entirely original work that establishes the basis of Keats&#x27;s notion of soul making, a method by which the individual builds his or her soul through a form of education consisting of suffering and personal experience. This is a fundamental preoccupation of the Romantics, who believed the way to reconcile man and nature was through this soul development, education—the combination of experience and contemplation—and that only this process, not the rationality of the previous century, would bring about true Enlightenment.

The classical influences Keats invoked affected other Romantic poets, but his odes contain a higher degree of allusion than most of his contemporaries&#x27; works. As for the main theme, indolence and poetry, the poem reflects the emotional state of being Keats describes in an early 1819 letter to his brother George:
[I]ndolent and supremely careless ... from my having slumbered till nearly eleven ... please has no show of enticement and pain no unbearable frown. Neither Poetry, nor Ambition, nor Love have any alertness of countenance as they pass by me: they seem rather like three figures on a greek vase—a Man and two women—whom no one but myself could distinguish in their disguisement.
Willard Spiegelman, in his study of Romantic poetry, suggests that the indolence of the poem arises from the narrator&#x27;s reluctance to apply himself to the labour associated with poetic creation. Some critics provide other explanations, and William Ober claims that Keats&#x27;s description of indolence may have arisen from the use of opium.

==Critical response==
Literary critics regard &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot; as inferior to Keats&#x27;s other 1819 odes. Walter Evert wrote that &quot;it is unlikely that the &#x27;Ode on Indolence&#x27; has ever been anyone&#x27;s favorite poem, and it is certain that it was not Keats&#x27;s. Why he excluded it from the 1820 volume we do not know, but it is repetitious and declamatory and structurally infirm, and these would be reasons enough.&quot; Bate indicated that the poem&#x27;s value is &quot;primarily biographical and not poetic&quot;.

&quot;Ode on Indolence&quot; is sometimes called upon as a point of comparison when discussing Keats&#x27;s other poems. Charles Wentworth Dilke observed that while the poem can be read as a supplemental text to assist the study of &quot;Grecian Urn&quot;, it remains a much inferior work. In 2000, Thomas McFarland wrote in consideration of Dilke&#x27;s comparison: &quot;Far more important than the similarity, which might seem to arise from the urns in Keats&#x27;s purview in both Ode on Indolence and Ode on a Grecian Urn ... is the enormous dissimilarity in the two poems. Ode on Indolence ... is a flaccid enterprise that hardly bears mention alongside that other achievement.&quot;

Sidney Colvin, in his 1917 biography on Keats, grouped &quot;Indolence&quot; with the other 1819 odes in categorizing Keats&#x27;s &quot;class of achievements&quot;. In 1948, Lord Gorell described the fifth stanza as, &quot;lacking the magic of what the world agrees are the great Odes&quot; but describes the language as &quot;[d]elicate, charming even&quot;. Later, in a 1968 biography of Keats, Gittings describes the importance of the poem: &quot;The whole ode, in fact, has a borrowed air, and he acknowledged its lack of success by not printing it with the others ... Yet with its acceptance of the numb, dull and indolent mood as something creative, it set the scene for all the odes that followed.&quot;

In 1973, Stuart Sperry described it as &quot;a rich and nourishing immersion in the rush of pure sensation and its flow of stirring shadows and &#x27;dim dreams&#x27;. In many ways the ode marks both a beginning and an end. It is both the feeblest and potentially the most ambitious of the sequence. Yet its failure, if we choose to consider it that, is more the result of deliberate disinclination than any inability of means.&quot; Andrew Motion, in 1997, argued, &quot;Like &#x27;Melancholy&#x27;, the poem is too articulate for its own poetic good ... In two of his May odes, &#x27;Melancholy&#x27; and &#x27;Indolence&#x27;, Keats defined themes common to the whole group with such fierce candour that he restricted their imaginative power. His identity had prevailed.&quot;

<doc id="498076" wikidata="Q6608016" url="?curid=498076" title="Bondage positions and methods">
<text>Bondage in BDSM is the activity of tying or restraining people using equipment such as chains, cuffs, or collars for mutual erotic pleasure. According to the Kinsey Institute, 12% of females and 22% of males respond erotically to BDSM.

A number of bondage positions and methods are used in rope bondage and other BDSM activities. Ropes are a common element of these positions, although straps, webbing, chains, hooks, manacles, spreader bars, collars, common furniture, purpose-built frames, various gags and monogloves may also be used. The ties and frictions often are variants of Japanese bondage, &quot;shibari&quot; and &quot;kinbaku&quot; from where they derived.

== Whole body ties ==
=== Ball tie ===
The ball tie is a bondage position in which a person is bound into a ball position with the knees against the shoulders. A ball position (also called a fetal position) can be tightly bound so that the legs are also bent double so the heels press against the buttocks; the legs must be brought up so that the thighs are pressed against the chest. Pressing the thighs tightly against the abdomen may restrict breathing.

The hands may be tied either in front or behind the back, however behind the back is more typical. If behind, there may also be elbow bondage, or the arms may be in a reverse prayer position, with ropes round the arms and torso (or arms and legs) to hold the arms firmly against the back. If in front, the arms may be tied hugging the legs, or possibly with each wrist bound to the opposite elbow. The ankles may also be tied together, as well as the knees. Typically, the ankles are tied to the thighs in a frogtie.

Sometimes the submissive wears high-heeled shoes and has ropes wrapped round the heels and fixed to the wrists. This adds to the visual impact, and should be used as a supplement to other secure bondage. Under strain, the shoes may come off or the heels may break off. When tied this way, the shoes cannot be removed.

The head may be pulled back in some way, such as in head bondage. However, s argue that this goes against the idea of binding into a ball. Alternatively, the head can be pulled forward to force the chin to press against the chest.

The position can be stringent while stimulating. At the same time, it is comfortable and the subject may remain in it for quite some time.

The ball tie is one of the positions possible in self-bondage. The mobility is limited so extra independent escape mechanisms should be used over and above the usual bondage precautions.

===Hogtie bondage===
Hogtie bondage requires all four limbs to be tied together behind the back. It typically involves connecting a person&#x27;s wrists and ankles behind the back using some form of physical restraints such as rope or cuffs, but may in some BDSM contexts also refer to the binding of arms and legs behind the back. The binding may be loose with the ankles and wrists some distance apart, or more stringent with all four bound together even with the wrists and ankles crossing and being cinched to the knee or shoulder harness.

A classic western hogtie would be made more stringent by binding together the elbows and binding together the knees.

A variation of the hogtie involves tying bound wrists to frogtied legs, providing the dominant easier access to the submissive&#x27;s crotch for sexual play.

====Safety====
The hogtie position places pressure on the abdomen of the tied person, which may create difficulty in breathing known as postural asphyxia. Care should be taken to ensure the person being bound can breathe easily throughout all stages of play. This is particularly important if gags, collars or rope are used to create a more stringent tie.

===Crab tie===

The submissive&#x27;s wrists are tied to the ankles, and the elbows attached to the knees. It is restrictive, allowing only the opening and closing of the legs and some rolling.

===Shrimp tie (ebi)===

A (also known as an or a ) is a type of Kinbaku bondage. A chest tie, such as a box tie, is constructed. The participant sits cross-legged, and the ankles are tied together using a single column tie. The rope is looped over the participants neck (or chest harness), and back to the ankles; this is then progressively tightened, bringing the ankles up to the head.

Due to the forced bent-down position of the upper body, this position sends a burning sensation through the body if the subject remains in it for a long time. As the knees are widely spread, the position resembles the legs of a prawn or shrimp.

The shrimp tie originated over 300 years ago in 1742 in Japan as a torture and interrogation technique.

==== Variations ====
* Knees are bound inward to further restrict movement
* The ankles are tied to the neck instead of the chest harness

All variations have the crossed position of the ankles in common.
===Reverse shrimp tie===
A &quot;Gyaku ebi&quot;: A chest tie, such as a box tie, is constructed. The participant sits cross-legged, and the ankles are tied together using a single column tie. The participant is moved onto their stomach, and the rope is passed from ankles along the back, pulling them and securing them to the buttocks. This is also called the Japanese hog-tie.

===Rope harness===

A bondage rope harness (sometimes referred to as a bondage web, rope web, rope dress, or karada) is a binding which involves the tying of an intricate structure of rope around the body in a complex web-like fashion.

A rope harness is similar in effect to a leather bondage harness, in that both are not in themselves normally used to bind a person, but are used to apply pressure over the area bound and can provide securing points for other bondage techniques, including suspension bondage.

A rope harness uses around 10–15 m of rope to tie, and involves multiple passes of rope from front to back around the body to build up the characteristic diamond-shaped rope pattern. It typically starts from a rope halter, the double rope with four specifically placed overhand knots falls down the body, and is pulled loosely beneath the crotch and up to the back of the neck halter. The single strands are then passed from back to front, looping into the stem or using Munter hitches. In some cases, a rope harness may extend beyond the torso, into diamond-patterned webs that extend down the length of the arms or legs.

Though a rope harness is not normally used to bind the limbs, it can be used for that purpose by simply going around the arms rather than under. A rope harness can be used with a crotch rope or a shinju (&quot;pearl&quot;) breast harness.

====Japanese karada====
The Japanese term &quot;shibari&quot; means simply &quot;a tie&quot;, while &quot;kinbaku&quot; is a decorative tie; where the aim is to produce a beautiful rope pattern around the body.
The Japanese term &quot;karada&quot; means simply &quot;body&quot;. Traditionally, a distinction was made between &quot;kikkou&quot; (&quot;turtle-shell&quot; pattern; hexagonal) and &quot;hishi&quot; (diamond) patterned ties, although many modern sources just use the term &quot;kikkou&quot; to refer to any rope body harness.

== Ties of the lower body ==
===Crotch rope===

A crotch rope (known in Japanese bondage as &quot;Matanawa&quot;, &quot;Sakura&quot;  or Sukaranbo ) is a rope that passes between the labia to apply painful or pleasurable pressure to the vulva. The rope is anchored by being tied around the waist. A crotch rope is most commonly made of hemp or jute, but webbing, straps or a harness are also used. It is sometimes combined with other bondage techniques including predicament bondage.

A crotch rope may be tied over clothing or directly onto the skin; it can be worn under clothing or in full view. While crotch ropes are most commonly used on women, variations exist for use on men.
A crotch rope can also be used as an unsophisticated type of chastity belt.

===Technique===
A crotch rope may consist of either a single line running between the legs to stimulate the genitals, or two lines running either side of them to leave them exposed. In the former case, the rope may pass between the labia majora or deeper through the pudendal cleft of the vulva. Knots can be tied in the rope to apply specific pressure to the anus or clitoris. A crotch rope is usually fixed in place by tying it to a rope around the waist just above the hips or by tying the two ends to a fixture. Crotch ropes are sometimes used in BDSM activities, especially on female submissives, most commonly as a part of tease and denial. A crotch rope is sometimes combined with the damsel in distress pose used in silent films, where the arms are tied together behind the back at the elbows and wrists, and the legs are tied together at the knees and ankles.

====Variations====
For abrasion play if the rope is not tied to the waist it can be moved forward and backward between the labia or the subject can be made to walk across it.

The ropes may be wrapped tightly around the waist and tied off in front, fed down across the genitals, then pulled back up behind and tied to other cords wrapped around the wrists, doubling as a cinch to tighten them further. This allows the rope bound person some ability to vary pressure on the genitals (often causing sexual stimulation) at the cost of reduced freedom of movement. If such a cord is pulled extremely tight the wrists and arms will have very little freedom of movement particularly when combined with elbow bondage and the hands will be firmly forced in contact with the buttocks.

===Frogtie===

The frogtie is a lower-body bondage position in which a person&#x27;s legs are bent fully at the knees. They are bound separately ankle-to-thigh, and also just behind the knee, in the likeness of a crouched frog. The knees may be left free, closely together or widely spread. This is the starting point of many other ties.

This tie places the person in a position where they are vulnerable but not completely immobilized and can still move about, albeit in an awkward crawling motion. The frogtie, with the person restrained so, can also be used as a restrictive sex position or as a basis for more restrictive bondage. The bound person&#x27;s wrist tie can also be tethered to some sort of immovable ring by an arbitrary length of cord, allowing some limited freedom of movement while preventing escape. Kinbaku enthusiasts could use a futumomo tie.

The wrists on each side are often then tied to the ankle/thigh combination on their respective sides, although it is possible to tie each wrist to the opposite ankle and make the position noticeably more strict.

In a similar position, the person&#x27;s wrists are simply bound to their corresponding ankles. However, that position cannot be fully considered as a frogtie, because it does not match the &quot;bound ankle-to-thigh&quot; condition.

===Positions of the legs===
The legs may be tied together, sometimes described as the &quot;virgin position&quot;, or apart, known as the &quot;slut position&quot;. The submissive can be standing, kneeling, sitting, or have the knees drawn up to the chest. The standing position may be relaxed, on tiptoe, or, at the most extreme, en pointe. A common technique in Japanese bondage is for the bound person to stand on one leg while the ankle of the other leg is bound to the standing thigh. This is a form of asymmetric bondage and the lack of balance is disorientating for the subject.

===Lotus position===
Some more flexible submissives are comfortable sitting in the yoga lotus position.

==Ties of the upper body==
=== Box tie ===
The box tie is a tie of the chest and upper arms, and is combined to create with ties of the lower limbs as a component or variation of other ties. Both arms are supported in parallel behind the back by a core and made immobile by a tensioned rope connecting the midpoint of the upper arms.
The TK wrap or shibari box tie, &quot;gote shibari&quot;, is a single column tie of the upper body. It is also called a &quot;takate kote&quot;. The forearms are placed in parallel high behind the back. This forms the starting point for the tie that has a top rope that encircles the torso and arms just below the shoulder, tying back to a central point, creating a &quot;stem&quot; down to the forearms. This is the distinguishing feature of the box-tie. A lower rope encircles the arms and torso at a midpoint between the upper rope and elbow, tying back to the stem.

TK wraps are used in suspension bondage, and if the ropes are misplaced the body weight can crush the radial nerve leading to the serious and possibly irreversible condition known as wrist drop. There is no absolutely safe position for the top wrap; the mid-point gap between the triceps and the deltoid muscles is the most problematic.

====Variants====
The cross-chest boxtie replaces the top rope by one that passes over the shoulder and back under the opposite arm, reverses tension and then repeats over the other shoulder.

A more strenuous alternative is the elbows together tie, which can lead to a strappado, or the reverse-prayer ties the over-arm (&quot;Hasenohren&quot;) or bunny ears ties, method is another way of restraining the hands.

The Star Harness restrains the arms. There is also the Pentagram (Star Harness).

=== Breast bondage ===

Breast bondage is a bondage technique which involves the tying of rope around a woman&#x27;s breasts in a visually intricate and decorative pattern. Breast bondage most commonly uses rope, but webbing, straps, a bondage harness or bondage tape may also be used.

Breast bondage often focuses on the decorative, aesthetic and erotic aspects of the result, and not on immobilization of the female subject. However, breast bondage can be combined with other techniques which restrict the subject&#x27;s mobility and can provide securing points for other bondage plays, such as crotch rope and breast torture. Hence it can be used as an expression of dominance and submission as well as an aesthetic kink.

====Technique====
Breast bondage can be applied over clothing or directly to the skin, and can be worn under clothing or in full view. rope, ribbon, or leather straps can be used.

The basic breast bondage technique, sometimes known as &quot;circling&quot;, involves tying ropes around the base of the breasts, causing them to bulge outwards. Usually, a single length of rope is used to tie both breasts so that the rope harness is automatically held together at the front. The rope may then also be fixed behind the back, to make a sort of bra. The technique is most suitable for breasts that are C cup or larger.

Another technique is to put a rope around the torso just above the breasts, and another one just below them, then push the ropes together to squeeze the breasts from the top and bottom. This can be done instead of, or as well as, the other method. A rope can also be passed over the shoulders and between the breasts, drawing the rope above and below the breasts together, then pass back over the shoulders to the knots at the back. The primary rope can be used to place cinches between the arms and the body.

====Shinju====
Shinju is a traditional Japanese breast bondage technique in which a rope is tied above, below and between the breasts, and also forms a halter over the shoulders and around the neck. The term &quot;Shinju&quot; (from the Japanese 真珠 meaning pearl) is a euphemism to refer to the binding of female breasts. It has been popularly claimed that &quot;shinju&quot; is an authentic Japanese term for a &quot;bikini harness&quot;. However, no such tie called a &quot;shinju&quot; is found in historic or present kinbaku.

The basic or foundational kinbaku form of binding the arms and breasts is known as the Ushiro Takatekote, which is to bind the arms behind (ushiro) the back in a box arm position (takate kote). This basic box arm tie, originally found in the samurai martial art of hojōjutsu (捕縄術) or Nawajutsu, (縄術) evolved into its erotic usage at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century, and is the foundation of most other kinbaku ties.

====Combination with other techniques====
Sometimes, breast bondage is combined with other bondage techniques. For example, the woman&#x27;s arms can be tied behind her back, in an elbow or box tie or in a reverse prayer position. When combined with breast bondage, bound arms force the woman&#x27;s chest and breasts to protrude further. When combining breast and arm bondage, the ropes can draw the ropes above and below the breasts together at the sides of the breasts as they pass under the shoulders and behind the neck, thus resulting in rope effectively surrounding the breasts.

Breast bondage can play an integral part in suspension bondage. If the subject is being suspended, particularly in a horizontal position such as a suspended hogtie, breast bondage is used as the main supporting area under the chest.

===Positions of the arms===
To describe a rig, a whole vocabulary has evolved. When the arms are crossed over the chest like a mummy: this is Egyptian, if they touch the opposite shoulders: this is a double-V. When both wrists are secured together behind the waist: this is a strappado. When a wrist is pulled behind the back and up to the opposing shoulder we have a hammerlock. When the wrists are in front of the body and the elbows tied with a spreader bar behind: this is a waitress. This hands may be on the head, or behind the neck or in an over-arm tie. They may be on the soles of the feet, on the ankles, on the opposite ankles on the knees, to the side crossed in front or holding the opposite elbow.

===Captive tie===
A captive tie or over-arm tie (Kotobu Ryo-tekubi), is a bondage position in which a person&#x27;s wrists are fastened behind the person&#x27;s head using some form of physical restraints, such as rope or cuffs to which is attached a length of rope, chain or strap the other end of which is attached to a belt at the waist or other anchoring point.
People who practice rope bondage see this as a short term or temporary tie, to be used to restrain the submissive while moving to another room, or a warm up introductory tie. It is not inescapeable. This simple over-arm tie is sometimes used in sexual foreplay and in tickling games where it prevents the submissive from protecting their ticklish spots.

The wrists are tied together in front with a double column tie. They are taken over the head and the rope falls down the centre of the back. It is passed around the lower chest and looped around itself, it is reversed and the fall is tightened and centred, the rope passes back in front of the chest and is locked off at the centre back. Spare rope can be passed up to wrists tightening the tie. To use this as a permanent tie, the tension is reduced and a further rope is passed between the upperarms, closing the space under the elbows.
The over-arm tie may be used as a part of more complicated bondage. For example, the back rope can be passed between the legs and fastened in front, forming a crotch rope. The wrists may be tied to the upper arms with any desired tension, from a loose tie to a strict tie where the wrists are almost touching the upper arms. The over-arm tie can be combined with other techniques which restrict the subject&#x27;s mobility further, such as hogtie bondage, frogtie or the shrimp tie for the legs, or by securing the tied wrists to a fixed frame. In this position, the elbows stick out on each side, level with the head, with the hands tied behind the head.

===Shouldering the rifle===

Teppō shibari (Japanese: 鉄砲縛り)

This is an asymmetric arm tie, where one arm is taken behind the back, and the other arm is taken over the shoulder.

===Reverse prayer===

The reverse prayer position, a technique used in BDSM play, involves restraint of a person&#x27;s arms by binding them behind the person&#x27;s back, with the hands placed between the shoulders, with the fingers of both hands straight, extended, and the palms of the hands touching each other. The wrists are bound together. It is similar to the traditional prayer position, but with the arms behind, rather than in front of, the bound person, thus preventing use of the arms. Someone bound in the position may need careful monitoring. Many people find the position painful after a time, and cramps may set in.

To immobilize the arms further, ropes or a strap are often placed round the arms and torso, pressing the arms against the back. On a woman, this can conveniently be linked to ropes for breast bondage. Another technique is to fix ropes from the elbows to a belt or other ropes round the body.

In bondage fiction, people in this position are sometimes forced to have their elbows touching, turning this into a form of elbow bondage. Very few people can adopt this position without dislocation of the shoulders. However, with many people, it is possible to press the elbows together slightly and tie them in that position.

The reverse prayer position (without any bondage) is also used in some yoga exercises.

===Head bondage===

Head bondage, in BDSM play, includes all techniques used to apply control to the head of the subject. It may refer to one of several techniques:

*It may refer to the use of rope or other material to achieve control of the head. In particular, it may refer to pulling the head backwards by hair bondage or a rope attached to the back or top of a hood or head harness. It is also possible to use a rope attached to a blindfold or gag, but this is usually less secure and may cause excessive pressure on a small part of the face; in particular, with a gag, the corners of the mouth may be injured.
*It may refer to encasing the head in a bondage hood, a head harness (a device made of interconnected straps designed to encircle the human head), a box, or the use of a device such as a Scold&#x27;s bridle (also referred to as a branks). A head harness may include a blindfold and/or gag. The encasement may include or be supplemented by a wide, stiff posture collar round the neck to restrict movement of the head.

The straps of a head harness are generally secured by buckles that fasten at the back of the head. Head harnesses are most commonly used to provide points of attachments to secure various kinds of gags, such as ball gags, bit gags, muzzle gags and ring gags, although they also have other uses, such as providing attachment points for other forms of bondage, or may be used simply for their psychological effect. Head harnesses may also function as a gag by themselves, by restricting the ability to open the mouth, or have a mouth cover as an integral part.

Head harnesses, like many other forms of bondage, also have the effect of creating a sense of objectification and erotic helplessness in the wearer, which can be erotic for the wearer, or for those observing them. Many head harnesses are designed with straps that pass in front of the wearer&#x27;s eyes, restricting their vision, and further increasing the sense of objectification and erotic subjugation. Some have full blindfolds.

==Ties to anchor points==
===Spread eagle===

The spread eagle position is also employed as a bondage position in BDSM play, sometimes horizontally otherwise vertically and even upside down. This is a comfortable position, the submissive lies face up on their back with all four limbs secured to the furniture. Face down would be called prone. The ties can be slack allowing movement or more severe. The position allows for total front access, but none to the rear, so it excludes spanking games. Penetration is limited by the low angle.

===X-cross===
A standing or hanging spread eagle position can be achieved using equipment such as an X-cross (also referred to as Saint Andrew&#x27;s cross) or spreader bars or with ropes or chains attached to different endpoints. As an erotic humiliation technique, it forces the subjects to display their genitals and to provide access to the crotch, groin or anal region.

=== Bondage furniture===

Specialist bondage furniture with anchor points is manufactured. It encompasses cages, frames, stocks, chairs and tables. Standard household furniture can be discretely adapted. For instance, a bed can be adapted using a restraints kit; webbing attached to leather cuffs is placed under the mattress. A ladder back chair offers anchor points for binding the legs high in the air, or behind.

==Strappado==
Strappado bondage is a term describing a position and technique used in BDSM play. A person&#x27;s arms are bound behind their back, then by use of some method of attachment such as a rope or chain that runs from their wrists to a securing point above, their arms are lifted behind them until the person is forced to bend forward. While the strappado bondage position is considered to be a form of BDSM play, it shares its basic principles of restraint with the method of torture and therefore can very easily become just that if not practiced safely.

===Techniques===
The different styles of the strappado bind can be summarized as follows and these can be combined with crotch ropes and breast bondage, gags or blindfolds. The exact technique used is very much related to the purpose of using this particular position in BDSM play:
*legs apart – spreader bar or attachment points
*legs together
*knees bound together and ankles spread apart
*elbows bound / not bound (see also armbinder)
*rope around neck/collar pulling down to force increased bend (in the interests of safety, it is important to ensure that there is no pressure on the front of the neck)
*hair bondage or other head bondage to pull head back

It intentionally reduces the subject&#x27;s ability to struggle, as the body is placed in an awkward position such and any struggling on their part, could result in their losing balance. As a result, the subject chooses not to move for fear of falling over.
It creates a sense of vulnerability in the subject&#x27;s mind by exposing their buttocks and genital area.
When the elbows are bound together, even for very flexible subject it is rarely possible to bind them to touch, for as arms are lifted towards a horizontal position, the shoulder joints shift into a different position preventing the usual movement that should occur when the elbows are drawn together. Irrespective of this any elbow bondage, even minor, applied in this manner may severely increase tension and pain.

The use of head bondage allows the subject&#x27;s head to be pulled back to a front-facing position as opposed to hanging towards the floor and is often used to make the subject perform oral sex. In addition to the restrictiveness that this causes, if a suitable ring gag is used the subject may feel increasingly exposed to penetration and because the subject&#x27;s head is facing down drooling may also occur.

The normal reaction of the subject is to increase the forward bending as the arms are lifted. By further lifting the arms beyond a critical point this may become too difficult or even physically impossible to continue without lifting themselves off the floor and force them to stand more upright and increase the strain on the shoulder joints. The subject can also be secured to e.g. a frame and ropes or chains substituted for other bondage devices. By completely immobilizing the subject&#x27;s body the person in the dominant position can have complete and precise control over the tension and pain experienced.

A form of predicament bondage is to tie one foot of the subject to the opposite thigh or another body part so they have to concentrate on not causing more pain. Their arms are raised to the point where they have to stand on their toes. To relieve pain in their foot they must lower their body and cause more pain in their shoulders. To relieve pain in their shoulders they must stand on tip-toes and cause more pain in their foot and leg. Another variation is to tie the subject&#x27;s foot to a body part of another subject so they can relieve their own pain but increase it for the other subject.

With the breasts pointing towards the floor, the use of nipple clamps, possibly with weights attached, can be used to stimulate the subject with more pain.

Strappado bondage is most commonly used with the subject&#x27;s feet on the ground. Very rarely will someone use this technique with their feet off the ground, because of the pain and possibly severe injury this can cause.

Due to the difficulty of maintaining this position, this type of BDSM play does not allow for long periods of being bound. Its major use is for sexual play with the bound subject. While bound like this, the subject is open to the use of various tools such as floggers, whips, etc., as well as general spanking. This position can also be used for sexual intercourse, or the use of vibrators and/or dildos to stimulate the bound person.

===Precautions and safety===
This bondage position is also used as a form of torture, therefore measures are usually taken to ensure that the subject bound in this position is not pushed beyond their physical capabilities. Any position that moves limbs into an extreme position and holds them there for an extended period of time can result in damage—sometimes permanent—to even the most flexible of people. It is possible, though very rare, for extreme iterations of this position to cause asphyxiation, as being suspended in this way can constrict the lungs and cause respiratory distress. Therefore, it is a technique to be performed with safety foremost in mind.

==Suspension==


Suspension bondage is a form of sexual bondage where a bound person is hung from one or more overhead suspension points. Suspension bondage is considered to carry a higher risk than other forms of sexual bondage and there is much attention to safety.

In &quot;partial suspension&quot; the person is bound in a way that part of their body weight is held by suspension ropes, cables or chains. The classic partial suspension position is to have the person balancing on one foot with part of their weight supported through a chest harness and the other leg pulled up in some direction. A person lying on their upper back with legs tied upwards to a suspension point to pull their lower back off the ground would also qualify as partial suspension.

In &quot;full suspension&quot; the person is completely supported by suspension ropes, cables or chains, and they have no contact with the ground. The position of the person&#x27;s body in a full suspension may be horizontal, vertical or inverted; it is only limited by their endurance and the skill of the binder.

A small group practise &quot;self-suspension&quot;.

==Rope and knots==

Metal can be used for bondage ties with handcuffs, metal hobbles and spreader bars. The rope used for Japanese bondage is made from natural fibres such as hemp, it is prepared by boiling to make it soft, but it is coarse and binds to itself: there is a lot of friction, so the knots hold fast.

The two basic ties are the single-column tie, where the &#x27;column&#x27; could be the end of a limb or an attachment point, and the double column tie which could be used to bind two limbs. They all start with a basic knot, and finish with securing the loose ends.

==Danger and safety precautions==
There is basic advice on precautions to take at a BDSM session. This includes never leaving the bound subject alone, never performing under the influence of alcohol or drugs and always having shears available to cut the rope in case there is an emergency.
*Restricting the blood flow. The symptoms are numbness, temperature drop and color change. This happens gradually and tissue damage takes place slowly; if noticed and acted upon quickly, permanent damage is unlikely.
::Most common is impaired venous return, as the veins are closest to the surface. The skin becomes red, then purple. This is avoided by the two finger rule; where the tie is loose enough for two fingers to be placed under the rope. This becomes dangerous around the head and around the male genitals.
::Impaired arterial flow, which is difficult to achieve, is more dangerous and results in the limb going white.
*Nerve damage is more serious, happens very quickly, is cumulative and often irreversible. Bondage practitioners should know the position of the nerves and place their rope to avoid them. Symptoms are pain, numbness or loss of feeling.
::The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve in the leg and the radial nerve in the mid-upper arm area are common sites of nerve injury. The knees, elbows, groin, and armpits are places where major arteries, veins, and nerves are near the surface and should be subjected to only moderate pressure.
* Asphyxiation is caused by restricting the airways round the neck and by compression of the lungs.
* Suspension trauma leading to dizziness, nausea or fainting
* Impact injuries due to falling.

<text>Kim Jae-gyu (, April 9, 1924 – May 24, 1980) was a South Korean politician, army lieutenant general and the director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. He assassinated South Korean President Park Chung Hee—who had been one of his closest friends—on October 26, 1979, and was subsequently executed by hanging on May 24, 1980.

He remains a controversial figure with many contradictions: he is regarded by some as a patriot who ended Park&#x27;s 18-year military dictatorship, and by others as a traitor who killed his long-time benefactor out of personal grievance. For many years, the latter was the prevailing view, but later revelations in the early 2000s about Kim&#x27;s relationship with some leaders of the democracy movement prompted a re-evaluation in some circles.

==Early life==
Kim was born in Gumi, North Gyeongsang Province, Korea. He is the 27th generation descendant of Kim Moon-gi (김문기;金文起) who was the civil minister (문신;文臣), the loyalist (충신;忠臣) of King Danjong, and the one of Samjungsin (삼중신;三重臣) during the Joseon period. He graduated from Gyeongbuk University in 1945 and became a middle school teacher until the newly independent South Korean government established its military and created the Korea Military Academy, then called Joseon Defense Academy. He graduated from the Joseon Defense Academy in December 1946, the same year as Park Chung Hee, and from Army College in 1952. He served as a regimental commander in 1954 and as vice-president of the Army College in 1957, where was the president at the time. Later Kim Gye-won became Chief Presidential Secretary to President Park and was present at the scene of assassination. In 1961, when Park Chung Hee staged a military coup to seize power, Kim did not participate in the coup and was suspected of being a counterrevolutionary. He was temporarily detained until he was released on Park&#x27;s order. He served Park&#x27;s military dictatorship from then until his assassination of Park in 1979.

==Park&#x27;s dictatorship==
During Park&#x27;s dictatorship, Kim was appointed as the commander of 6th Division in 1963. When there was a widespread demonstration against the Korean-Japanese treaty in 1964, which Park pursued in secret and was widely regarded to be disadvantageous to Korean fishermen, Kim&#x27;s Division was dispatched to Seoul to subdue student demonstrations. Kim&#x27;s handling of the situation was said to have earned Park&#x27;s trust and favor. On the other hand, it is also said that Kim refused to involve the Army in the arrest of civilians and left that task to the police; instead ordering his troops to occupy themselves with the clean-up of streets and the university campus. Afterward, he commanded the Sixth Military District in 1966, the Army Security Command in 1968 and the Third Army Group in 1971. While he was the commander of Army Security Command, a military organ whose chief function was to safeguard the dictatorship, Park ran for a third term in the 1971 presidential election. Kim persuaded Park to promise to voters that it would be his last term. He also opposed the formation of Hanahoe, a secret organization formed by Chun Doo-hwan and other young officers who took personal oaths of loyalty to Park and the group itself above all else, and criticized it as a private army. Eventually, Hanahoe staged a military coup under Chun&#x27;s leadership after Park&#x27;s assassination to seize power and drove out the older generation of military generals.

While Kim was the commander of the Third Army Group in Kang-won Province, Park declared national emergency and martial law, dismissed the National Assembly and prohibited all political activities in October 1972. The purpose was to ratify the Yushin Constitution of 1972, which (a) abolished direct vote for presidential election and replaced it with an indirect voting system involving delegates, (b) allotted one third of the National Assembly seats to the president, (c) gave the president the authority to issue emergency decrees and suspend the Constitution, (d) gave the president the authority to appoint all judges and dismiss the National Assembly and (e) repealed a term limit to presidency. In the 1971 election, Park had nearly lost to opposition leader Kim Dae-jung despite spending ten percent of the national budget on his reelection campaign. The Yushin Constitution was designed to guarantee his dictatorship for life. Indeed, Park was later re-elected as the president by a unanimous vote of approximately 2,000 delegates, who all became delegates themselves with Park&#x27;s approval. According to Kim&#x27;s subordinate officers at Third Army Group, Kim did not hide his displeasure at learning of the Yushin Constitution.

==Yushin Constitution==
After his arrest, Kim wrote in Chinese calligraphy that it took seven years to accomplish his resolution, suggesting that the Yushin Constitution turned him against Park. In his trial, he claimed that he planned to detain Park if he were to visit the Third Army Group base on his annual tour of army groups and force his resignation. According to Third Army Group operations chief of staff Oh Soo-choon, who was also Kim&#x27;s brother-in-law, Kim installed fences around a small building in the base and set it up so that it would prevent exit from within rather than entry from outside. 
More significantly, Kim appears to have had a close relationship with Jang Jun-ha, widely respected leader of the democracy movement as a former Liberation Army officer, opposition lawmaker, and publisher of the monthly journal &quot;World of Ideology&quot;. According to Jang Ho-kweon, Jang&#x27;s eldest son and current publisher of the journal, Jang told him that Kim was a patriotic soldier whom he would one day work together with for democracy. In 1979, Kim claimed to his lawyer that his first attempt to assassinate Park was on September 14, 1974, when he was appointed to be Construction Minister. A newsreel of this event shows something protruding in Kim&#x27;s pocket when he shook hands with Park. According to the Reverend Yi Hae-hak, who was imprisoned with Jang Jun-ha when Jang was sentenced to fifteen years for creating a petition campaign against the Yushin Constitution, Jang knew of Kim&#x27;s plan to assassinate Park and was very disappointed when it did not take place, uttering to himself, &quot;Is it that great to be a minister?&quot;. After Jang died under suspicious circumstances while climbing a mountain in 1975, Kim secretly provided financial assistance to Jang&#x27;s family. When Kim later became KCIA director in 1976, he told Jang&#x27;s son with deep regret that Jang&#x27;s death was not accidental as officially announced, but that the regime was involved.

According to Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan, another leading figure in democracy movement, Kim (then KCIA deputy director) came to see him whenever there was political crisis. In 1975, he asked Cardinal Kim to speak with President Park to come up with the &quot;third way,&quot; that is, to somehow amend the Yushin Constitution in a way that was acceptable to Park. According to Cardinal Kim, Kim compared President Park to &quot;a sick patient&quot; who needed weak medicine initially. Kim believed that the Catholic cardinal was the only person who could speak frankly to Park without repercussion and was disappointed when the talk was essentially fruitless. Kim&#x27;s association with two key figures of democracy movement - Jang Jun-ha and Cardinal Kim Sou-hwan - led some to reconsider Kim&#x27;s motive in assassinating Park.

As Construction Minister (1974–1976), Kim promoted the entry of Korean construction companies into Saudi Arabia, increasing South Korean exports to the Middle East twenty-fold, from $45 million in 1973 to $900 million in 1976, making Saudi Arabia the fourth most important overseas market, and helping South Korea weather the 1973 oil crisis.

==KCIA Director==
On February 4, 1976, Kim was summoned by Park and was appointed as the director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA), one of the most powerful and feared positions under Park&#x27;s dictatorship. The KCIA was created in 1961 to coordinate both international and domestic intelligence activities including those of the military with primary aim of combating communism and North Korea. Since then, it was also used to suppress any domestic opposition to Park&#x27;s regime using its broad powers to wiretap, arrest, and detain suspects without a court order. The KCIA was responsible for widespread violations of human rights in South Korea, engaging in torture, political murder, and kidnapping. It was also heavily involved in behind-the-scene political maneuverings to weaken the opposition parties using bribery, blackmail, threats, arrest, and/or torture of opposition lawmakers. Later Kim claimed that he did not want the position but thought that it would give him the best chance to persuade President Park and reform the Yushin system.

Kim&#x27;s tenure as the KCIA director has many contradictions. On one hand, Kim asked Park to lift the Ninth Emergency Decree at least three times, which punished any criticism of the Yushin Constitution with a prison term of at least one year, until it was finally replaced with the Tenth Emergency Decree, which relaxed many restrictions of the Ninth Decree. He also released many activists and students who had been arrested under the Ninth Decree. Declassified U.S. diplomatic cables revealed that Kim was considered an unusual KCIA director who often spoke of democracy, and one of the more approachable figures who often carried Washington&#x27;s messages on human rights to Park.

On the other hand, Kim was responsible for KCIA activities that took place during his tenure including the assassination of former KCIA director Kim Hyong-uk, political sabotage of the opposing New Democratic Party (NDP)&#x27;s internal election and the violent arrest of female workers of a wig company YH Trade. Nearly 200 women who worked for YH Trade held a sit-in demonstrations at the NDP headquarters when 2,000 policemen stormed the NDP headquarters on August 11, 1979. In the process, one female worker fell to her death and 52 people including 10 workers, 30 NDP members, and 12 journalists were injured, some requiring hospitalization. Furthermore, KCIA Deputy Director Kim Jeong-Seop and Kim Gye-won testified in their trial after Park&#x27;s assassination that Kim pursued firm action in the YH case, over the objection of subordinates, and that Kim wanted stronger measures than the Ninth Decree allowed. However, their claims are not thought to be credible since some other testimonies are demonstrably untrue and they needed to distance themselves from Kim.

==1979 regime troubles==
The last year of Park&#x27;s rule was particularly turbulent with increasing opposition from the NDP, which was emboldened after winning the 1978 election by 1.1%, despite Park&#x27;s complete control of media, money, and all institutions of the government. Because of the Yushin Constitution, which allowed Park to appoint one third of National Assembly seats, Park&#x27;s Democratic Republican Party (DRP) remained in power. In May 1979, Kim Young-sam was elected as the chairman of the NDP, despite intense behind-the-scene maneuverings by KCIA to back Yi Chul-seung, a more pliable candidate. Under Kim Young-sam&#x27;s leadership, the NDP took the hardline policy of never compromising or cooperating with Park until the repeal of Yushin Constitution, and took on direct confrontation in many issues, especially the aforementioned YH Trade case. After a violent arrest, Kim Young-sam warned that Park&#x27;s murderous regime would soon collapse in the most wretched manner. Park was determined to remove Kim from the political scene like imprisoned Kim Dae-joong. In September 1979, the KCIA worked behind the scene to entice three NDP members to challenge Kim&#x27;s election as NDP chairmanship in the court on technicality, and the court obliged by ordering the suspension of Kim&#x27;s NDP chairmanship. 
The political tension intensified further when Kim Young-sam gave an interview with &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Henry Stokes, in which he called on the United States to make a choice between the military dictatorship and the Korean people and stop supporting Park&#x27;s regime. Park ordered Kim Young-sam&#x27;s expulsion from the National Assembly, which Kim Jae-gyu feared to be a disastrous path. On October 3, 1979, Kim Jae-gyu met Kim Young-sam, hoping to find a way to avoid such development. Having asked a reluctant Kim Young-sam to come to the KCIA &quot;for the sake of the country&quot;, Kim Jae-gyu warned that Park&#x27;s hostility toward him reached the point where it might not end with just expulsion or arrest and literally begged Kim Young-sam to just say that there was miscommunication with the interview. According to Kim Young-sam, when he refused, Kim Jae-gyu appealed that it would bring misfortune to the country, to Kim Young-sam and to Park. Indeed, Kim Young-sam&#x27;s expulsion from the National Assembly the next day led all 66 NDP lawmakers to submit their resignation to the National Assembly en masse and the United States to recall its ambassador to South Korea in protest. Uprisings broke out in Kim Young-sam&#x27;s hometown in Busan on October 16, the second largest city in South Korea, resulting in arson of 30 police stations over several days. It was the largest demonstration since the days of President Syngman Rhee and spread to nearby Masan on October 19 and other cities, with students and citizens calling for repeal of the Yushin Constitution. Kim Jae-gyu went to Busan to investigate the situation and found that the demonstrations were not riots by some college students, but more like a &quot;popular uprising joined by regular citizens&quot; to resist the regime. He warned Park that the uprisings would spread to five other largest cities including Seoul. Park said that he himself would give an order to fire upon demonstrators if the situation got worse.

===Rivalry between Kim and Cha===
Kim&#x27;s position, already under stress of the series of political crises of 1979, was further complicated by his rivalry with Cha Ji-cheol, chief of the Presidential Security Service, as well as a worsening relationship with Park. The rivalry stemmed largely from Cha&#x27;s increasing encroachment into KCIA turf and arrogant behavior that belittled Kim Jae-gyu in public. Almost universally disliked and feared, Cha served Park in close proximity since 1974 and became his favorite and most trusted adviser in the process. Cha appropriated tanks, helicopters and troops from the Army so that the presidential security apparatus had a division-level firepower under Cha&#x27;s direct command. Furthermore, he began to engage in political maneuverings with Park&#x27;s blessing, which resulted in frequent clash with the KCIA. In the NDP&#x27;s election for its chairman in 1979, KCIA backed Yi Chul-seung to prevent the election of hardliner Kim Young-sam, but Cha Ji-chul interfered in KCIA&#x27;s political sabotage with his own behind-scene maneuverings. When Kim Young-sam was elected as the NDP chairman, Cha laid the blame on KCIA, which infuriated Kim. Later Cha pushed for Kim Young-sam&#x27;s expulsion from the National Assembly, which Kim Jae-gyu feared to be a disastrous development. Cha easily bested his opponent as his hardline approach was favored by Park, and he blamed worsening development on Kim Jae-gyu&#x27;s weak leadership of KCIA at every opportunity. As Cha came to control the scheduling of Park&#x27;s meetings and briefings and thus access to the president, KCIA briefings, which were usually the first business in the morning, were pushed down to afternoons. By October, there were wide rumors that Kim Jae-gyu would be soon replaced as KCIA director.

==Assassination of Park Chung-hee==

On the day of assassination, Park and his entourage visited ribbon-cutting ceremonies for a dam in Sap-gyeo-cheon and a KBS TV transmitting station in Dang-jin. Kim Jae-gyu was expected to accompany him since the TV station was under KCIA jurisdiction, but Cha blocked him from riding in the same helicopter with President Park. Kim angrily excused himself from the trip.

After the trip, Park instructed the KCIA to prepare for one of his numerous banquets—on average there were ten per month according to KCIA Chief Agent Park Seon-ho, one of the conspirators—at a KCIA safe house in Gungjeong-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul. It was to be attended by Park, Kim Jae-gyu, Cha, Chief Presidential Secretary Kim Gye-won, and two young women—rising singer Shim Soo-bong and a college student named Shin Jae-soon. When Kim Jae-gyu was notified of the banquet, he called Korean Army Chief of Staff Jeong Seung-hwa 15 minutes later to invite him to the KCIA safe house and arranged to have him dine with KCIA Deputy Director Kim Jeong-seop in a nearby KCIA building in the same compound. Just before the dinner, Kim Jae-gyu told Chief Presidential Secretary Kim Gye-won that he would get rid of Cha. It is not clear whether Kim Gye-won misheard or misunderstood Kim Jae-gyu, or if he ignored his words.

During the dinner, volatile political issues including demonstrations in Busan and the opposition leader Kim Young-sam were discussed with Park, with Chief Cha taking a hardline and Kim Jae-gyu calling for moderate measures, while Chief Presidential Secretary Kim was trying to steer the topic of discussion to small talk. Park rebuked Kim Jae-gyu for not being repressive enough in dealing with protesters and Kim Young-sam, whom Park said should be arrested. Each time the discussion drifted to other subjects, Cha continued to bring up the inability of KCIA to end the crisis and suggested that demonstrators and opposition lawmakers should be &quot;mowed down with tanks.&quot; The rebukes from Park and especially Cha riled up Kim Jae-gyu. Kim Jae-gyu left the dining room to convene with his closest subordinates—former Marine colonel and KCIA Chief Agent Park Seon-ho and Army colonel and Kim Jae-gyu&#x27;s secretary Park Heung-ju (no relations)—and said to them: &quot;The chief of staff and deputy director are here as well. Today is the day.&quot; When asked if Park was included as a target, Kim Jae-gyu said yes. Kim Jae-gyu reentered the room with a semi-automatic Walther PPK pistol, shot Cha in the arm and then Park in the left chest. He attempted to fire again on Cha, but the gun jammed. Cha fled to a bathroom adjacent to the dining room. Kim Jae-gyu came back with his subordinate&#x27;s gun and again shot Cha, this time in the abdomen, and Park in the head, even though he was already dead. Upon hearing the initial shots, Park Seon-ho held two bodyguards in the waiting room at gunpoint and ordered them to put their hands up in hope of preventing further bloodshed, especially since he was a friend of one of the bodyguards. When the other bodyguard attempted to reach for a gun, Park fatally shot them both. At the same time, Colonel Park Heung-ju and two other KCIA agents stormed the kitchen and killed the remaining bodyguards. In the end, Park, Cha, three presidential bodyguards and a presidential chauffeur all died.

===Aftermath===
After killing Park, Kim Jae-gyu asked Chief Presidential Secretary Kim to secure the safe house, and ran to the nearby KCIA building where Army Chief of Staff Jeong Seung-hwa was waiting. Jeong heard the shootings and was discussing them with KCIA Deputy Director Kim Jeong-seop when Kim Jae-gyu came in breathless to tell them that an emergency situation had occurred. In the car, Kim Jae-gyu advised Jeong that Park had died, but without explaining how. Kim Jae-gyu hoped that Jeong and Chief Presidential Secretary Kim would support him in the coup as both were appointed to their positions on his recommendation, and Chief Presidential Secretary Kim was especially close with him. The car initially headed to KCIA Headquarters in Namsan district but eventually went to Army Headquarters in Yongsan district, since the Army would have to be involved in declaring emergency martial law. Many historians believe that Kim Jae-gyu made a critical mistake in not going to KCIA Headquarters, where he would have been in control. However, his failure to gain Jeong&#x27;s support sealed the fate of the conspirators.

Meanwhile, Chief Presidential Secretary Kim took Park&#x27;s body to the Army hospital and ordered doctors to save him at all costs (without revealing Park&#x27;s identity), and went to Prime Minister Choi Kyu-hah to reveal what happened that night. When Chief of Staff Jeong learned of what happened from Chief Presidential Secretary Kim, he ordered Major General Chun Doo-hwan, commander of Security Command to arrest Kim Jae-gyu and investigate the incident. Kim Jae-gyu was arrested after he was lured to a secluded area outside Army HQ on the pretext of meeting with Army Chief of Staff. Eventually, everyone involved in the assassination was arrested, tortured and later executed. Kim himself was hanged on May 24. In the process, Chun Doo-hwan emerged as a new political force by investigating and subordinating KCIA under his Security Command and later by arresting Jeong Seung-hwa, who had become the chief martial law administrator and Chief Secretary Kim on suspicion of conspiring with Director Kim, when Chun Doo-hwan seized power in the Coup d&#x27;état of December Twelfth 1979.

Kim is buried in a hillside cemetery in Neungpyeong-dong, Gwangju, Gyeonggi. On May 26, 2020, Kim&#x27;s family filed a retrial request with the Seoul High Court seeking a retrial for Kim on the basis that the original investigation and trial were illegal and that Kim had been tortured. On February 19, 2025, the court approved the retrial following a review.

<text>Panikkassery Keshavan &quot;P.K.&quot; Balakrishnan (March 2, 1925 – April 3, 1991) was an Indian novelist and critic. A doyen of Malayalam literature, he is best known for his novel, &quot;Ini Njan Urangatte&quot; (&quot;And now, Let me Sleep&quot;), a novel based on Mahabharata as well as a number of critical studies which include &quot;Chandu Menon Oru Padanam&quot;, &quot;Novel Siddhiyum Sadhanayum&quot;, &quot;Kavyakala Kumaranasaniloode&quot;, and &quot;Ezhuthachante Kala: Chila Vyasabharatha Patanangalum&quot;. His &quot;Jathivyavasthayum Kerala Charitravum&quot; is a work in social history.

Kerala Sahitya Akademi awarded him their annual award for novel in 1974. He was also a recipient of the Vayalar Award and other honours.

== Biography ==
P. K. Balakrishnan was born on March 2, 1925, at Edavanakad at Vypin island in Kerala to Keshavan and Mani Amma. After early schooling in Edavanakkad, he joined Maharaja&#x27;s College, Ernakulam but his studies were disrupted after four years when he participated in Quit India Movement and was jailed.

Although he was released from jail in 1944 and resumed his studies, he could not complete it as he joined Kochi rajya prajamandalam to enter politics only to move to Kerala Socialist Party (KSP) soon. His association with KSP brought him into contact with Mathai Manjooran, a noted Indian independence activist and KSP leader as well as Vaikom Muhammad Basheer and M. K. Sanu, among others.

Later, he took up the editorship of &quot;Dinaparabha&quot; but he had to quit following a public speech he made at a temple in Kozhikode. Later, he became associated with such publications as Kerala Bhooshanam, Kerala Kaumudi and Madhyamam.

Balakrishnan died on April 3, 1991, at the age of 66.

== Legacy ==
The first of Balakrishnan&#x27;s published works was a book on Narayana Guru, which was a compilation of writings on Guru, including biographical sketches, narratives on Guru&#x27;s activities and his literary contributions. This was followed by critiques Chandu Menon, Kumaran Asan and Ezhuthachan.

In his writings, he first dealt with Kerala history in the anthology on Narayana Guru, the great social reformer of Kerala who changed the face of its caste-ridden society. He brushes with Kerala history again to study why Tipu Sultan, an able ruler and administrator is perceived as an aggressor and a religious fanatic. The culmination of these studies over 3 decades was his work on the social history which departed from the established narration, titled &quot;Jaathivyavasthayum Kerala Charitravum&quot; (&quot;The Caste System and History of Kerala&quot;).

&quot;Pluto, Priyapetta Plutto&quot;, was his first novel, was a real life story about his own dog. His next novel, &quot;Ini Njan Urangatte&quot;, a Mahabharata inspired work, is considered by many to be his magnum opus. This novel, has been translated into English by K.C. Sarsamma under the title &quot;And Now Let Me Sleep&quot;. Two decades after P. K. Balakrishnan&#x27;s death, his daughter P. K. Jayalekshmy has been made another English translation under the title &quot;Battle beyond Kurukshetra&quot;. Balakrishnan also wrote a number of articles, of which only four collections have been published; two of them were published after his lifetime.

== Awards and honours ==
P. K. balakrishnan received the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for Novel in 1974 for his work, &quot;Ini Njan Urangatte&quot;. Four years later, the same novel fetched him another major award in the form of Vayalar Award of 1978. He received the Kerala History Association Award for the book, &quot;Jaathivyavasthithium Keralacharithravum&quot;. He was also a recipient of SPBF Award, Prof. Velayudhan Endowment Award and Kesari Award.

<text>Vadakkke Koottala Narayanankutty Nair, commonly known as V.K.N. (7 April 1929 – 25 January 2004), was a prominent Malayalam writer, noted mainly for his satire. He wrote novels, short stories and political commentaries. His works are noted for their multi-layered humour, trenchant criticism of the socio-political classes and ability to twist the meanings of words contextually and lend a touch of magic to his language.

==Biography==
A native of Kerala in south India, V.K.N. was born on 7 April 1929 in Thiruvilwamala in Trichur district (now Thrissur). (C. P. Nair, one of his close friends, tells that V.K.N&#x27;s correct date of birth is 7 April 1929.) After completing his matriculation, he joined the Malabar Devaswom Board and worked there for 9 years. Like a number of modern Malayalam writers such as O. V. Vijayan, V.K.N. spent many years in New Delhi (from 1959 to 1969) as an English journalist. The experiences he gained during these years, which coincided with the nascent post-independent India, are reflected in his book, &quot;Pitamahan&quot; (The Great Grandfather). V.K.N.&#x27;s first story &quot;Parajithan&quot; was published in the October 1953 issue of &quot;Mathrubhumi Weekly&quot;.

==Personal life==
V.K.N was married to Vedavathi Amma. They had a son Balachandran &amp; a daughter Ranjana.

==Literary life==
VKN&#x27;s entry into Malayalam literature was in 1950s. Like for many others, his first love had been poetry. Though, before long, he gave it up, he kept up this adolescent infatuation all through his life. And he could quote from the Megasandesha or the Ramayanam chambu as quickly and effortlessly as he could from a new generation poet. This textual proficiency did not confine to poetry or literature alone. It was generic. Anything from under the sun, from contemporary politics to primitive occultism, from modern astrophysics to Chanakya&#x27;s Arthashastra, or from Das Kapital to Kamasutra, was a narrative device for him, which he brought into play in his stories and novels.

It was in the 1960s that VKN came to prominence as a writer. But, by then he had left Kerala for New Delhi, where he spent about 10 years as a journalist. The New Delhi of the 1960s had a defining role in modern Malayalam literature. It was the group of young writers who happened to come together on various professional engagements in the country&#x27;s capital that made Malayalam literature, fiction in particular, what it is today. Prominent among whom were O.V. Vijayan, M. Mukundan, George Varghese Kakkanadan and M. P. Narayana Pillai. VKN &quot;landed&quot; in this circle. These writers used to meet regularly to thrash out literature, politics or whatever else was the topic of the day – a preparation that capacitated them to accomplish new heights in writing.

As might be expected, VKN became an unfailing member of that collective. Those interactions, evidently, helped him be conversant with the latest developments in literature and consummate his style that is full of vim and vigour. Also, it could be that it was from those gatherings that he picked out many of his prototypical characters, especially the quick-witted, but hard-up &quot;hero&quot;, Payyan (The Guy) of his seminal work, Payyan Kathakal (The Stories of Payyan), who made inroads into the higher echelons of power and wealth using nothing but his sharp intelligence and winning demeanour.

The Delhi life in 1960s had significantly contributed to framing VKN&#x27;s social outlook as well. The institutionalisation of unscrupulous political manipulations, power brokerage, corruption and the murky dealings in the corridors of power; all that to which he became a silent, nonetheless alert, head-on witness deepened his distrust of the entire social and political order. And, what he did was to make them materials for a laugh that begot another laugh, which finally spread across our body, mind and intellect. For that reason, he was labelled &quot;humorist&quot;.
He called his novels &quot;Pennpada&quot;, &quot;Manchal&quot; and &quot;Pithamahan&quot; &quot;historical satires&quot;, a new genre he created.

VKN&#x27;s important works are Pithamahan (The Great Grandfather), Arohanam, which literally means &quot;The Ascend&quot; but &quot;Bovine Bugles&quot; in the author&#x27;s own translation, Adhikaram (The Power), Payyan Kathakal (The Stories of Payyan), Sir Chathuleecock, Kavi (The Saffron), Chathans, and Chitrakeralam (Kerala Pictures). &quot;Humour&quot;, in none of these works, did mean just a laugh. Certainly, he made use of all that is available in the repertoire of humour: irony, satire, parody and burlesque. But, be it about the misuse of power, the abuse of female body, the libertinism of the affluent, or about the fate of the poor of the day; his narration was historically and politically many-voiced. Nothing escaped his keen-eyed scrutiny by which he puzzled readers as to how they should take it; laugh, cry or get agitated. His humour, in substance, was a lamentation on human fallacies. And, just like that, a resistance to authoritarianism of all sorts. He dispassionately chronicled the transition of society from one phase to another. And &quot;laughed&quot; because, like his favourite character Payyan, &quot;he could not cry&quot;.
