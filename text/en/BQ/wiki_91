<text>U.S. Route 371 is a north–south United States highway in the U.S. states of Arkansas and Louisiana. The highway&#x27;s northern terminus is in De Queen, Arkansas at an intersection with U.S. Highway 70. It is co-signed for its last between Lockesburg, Arkansas and DeQueen with U.S. Highway 59 and U.S. Highway 71. Its southern terminus is west of Coushatta, Louisiana at an intersection with Interstate 49.

==Route description==

===Louisiana===

U.S. 371 is an afterthought in the federal highway system. Within Louisiana it was merely the 1990s renumbering and re-signing of the post-1955 Louisiana Highway 7 north of US 71, which after the 1990s change ceased to exist as a number for a state highway in Louisiana. The section south of US 71 was the post-1955 Louisiana Highway 179, which after the 1990s change ceased to exist as a number for a state highway in Louisiana. It also replaced a section of Louisiana Highway 177. Although signage is on I-49, US 371 begins just north of Coushatta, Louisiana at an intersection with US 71. Intersecting I-20 and US 80 at Minden, it then crosses the Arkansas Line at Springhill, Louisiana. Louisiana Highway 371, on the other hand, was renumbered to Louisiana Highway 3277 because of the creation of US 371.

===Arkansas===

US 371 contains about in South Arkansas.

US 371 enters Arkansas in Columbia County. The route runs north to intersect AR 160 in Taylor and winds east to Magnolia. A concurrency with US 82 begins in Magnolia, and continues north to the city limits. US 371 continues west to meet AR 98 in Waldo, before heading north to enter Nevada County. The route next meets AR 32 and AR 76 before entering Rosston, where a short concurrency with US 278 forms. US 371 meets AR 372 before entering Prescott, where the route meets AR 24 and is intersected by Interstate 30 before entering Hempstead County.

US 371 winds through Hempstead County west and north, concurring briefly with AR 195 and eventually entering Howard County. The route passes through Nashville, again meeting US 278, and runs west through rural land and into Sevier County. In Sevier County, US 371 meets US 59/US 71, which form a northern concurrency, eventually adding US 70 as well. These four routes run together west to De Queen, at which US 371 terminates.

==History==

Initially referenced as the Bi-State Corridor, the Arkansas State Highway Commission designated several state highways as a proposed corridor to seek AASHTO approval as a US highway in January 1994. Upon receiving approval, the route was officially commissioned in Arkansas as Highway 371 on 24 August 1994.

===Minnesota===

A prior, unrelated US 371 was decommissioned in Minnesota in 1971. The route still bears the designation of MN 371.

<text>William Markowitz (February 8, 1907 – October 10, 1998) was an American astronomer known for his work on the standardization of time.

==Early life and education==
William Markowitz was born Melč in Austrian Silesia (now in the Czech Republic) on February 8, 1907. His mother had been visiting from her native Poland. The family emigrated to the United States in 1910, settling in Chicago. 

Markowitz obtained his doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1931 under the supervision of William Duncan MacMillan with a thesis on the statistics of binary stars. 

==Career==
He taught at Pennsylvania State College before joining the United States Naval Observatory in 1936, working under Paul Sollenberger and Gerald Clemence in the time service department.

Markowitz eventually became director of the department. He developed the ephemeris time scale, which had been adopted by the IAU in 1952 on a proposal formulated by Clemence in 1948, as an international time standard. He subsequently worked with Louis Essen in England to calibrate the newly developed atomic clocks in terms of the ephemeris second. The fundamental frequency of caesium atomic clocks, which they determined as 9,192,631,770 ± 20 Hz, was used to define the second internationally since 1967. At the International Astronomical Union (IAU) meeting in Dublin in 1955, he had proposed the system of distinguishing between variants of Universal Time, as UT0 (UT as directly observed), UT1 (reduced to invariable meridian by correcting to remove effect of polar motion) and UT2 (further corrected to remove (extrapolated) seasonal variation in Earth rotation rate), a system which remains in some use today.

He served as President of the IAU commission on time from 1955 to 1961, and was active in the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics, the American Geophysical Union, and the International Consultative Committee for the Definition of the Second.

After retiring from USNO in 1966, Markowitz served as professor of physics at Marquette University until 1972, and also held a post at Nova Southeastern University.

==Personal life==
Markowitz married Rosalyn Shulemson in 1943. Markowitz died on October 10, 1998 at the age of 91.

<text>Cecil James Sharp (22 November 1859 – 23 June 1924) was an English collector of folk songs, folk dances and instrumental music, as well as a lecturer, teacher, composer and musician. He was a key figure in the folk-song revival in England during the Edwardian period. According to Roud&#x27;s &quot;Folk Song in England&quot;, Sharp was the country&#x27;s &quot;single most important figure in the study of folk song and music&quot;.

Sharp collected over four thousand folk songs, both in South-West England and the Southern Appalachian region of the United States. He published an extensive series of songbooks based on his fieldwork, often with piano arrangements, and wrote an influential theoretical work, &quot;English Folk Song: Some Conclusions&quot;. He notated examples of English Morris dancing, and played an important role in the revival both of the Morris and English country dance. In 1911, he co-founded the English Folk Dance Society, which was later merged with the Folk-Song Society to form the English Folk Dance and Song Society.

Cecil Sharp&#x27;s musical legacy extends into English orchestral music, and the classroom singing experienced by generations of schoolchildren. Many of the most popular musicians of the British Folk Revival from the 1960s to the present day have used songs collected by Sharp in their work. Scores of Morris dance teams throughout England, and also abroad, demonstrate the resilience of the revival he played a large part in sustaining. In the US, the Country Dance and Song Society was founded with Sharp&#x27;s support, and dancers there continue to participate in styles he developed.

Over the last four decades, Sharp&#x27;s work has attracted heated debate, with claims and counter-claims regarding selectivity, nationalism, appropriation, bowdlerisation and racism.

==Early life==
Sharp was born in Camberwell, Surrey, the eldest son of James Sharp (a slate merchant who was interested in archaeology, architecture, old furniture and music) and his wife, Jane &quot;née &quot;Bloyd, who was also a music lover. They named him after the patron saint of music, on whose feast he was born. Sharp was educated at Uppingham, but left at 15 and was privately coached for the University of Cambridge, where he rowed in the Clare College boat and graduated B.A. in 1882.

==In Australia==
Sharp decided to emigrate to Australia on his father&#x27;s suggestion. He arrived in Adelaide in November 1882 and early in 1883 obtained a position as a clerk in the Commercial Bank of South Australia. He read some law, and in April 1884 became associate to the Chief Justice, Sir Samuel James Way. He held this position until 1889 when he resigned and gave his whole time to music. He had become assistant organist at St Peter&#x27;s Cathedral soon after he arrived, and had been conductor of the Government House Choral Society and the Cathedral Choral Society. Later he became conductor of the Adelaide Philharmonic, and in 1889 entered into partnership with I. G. Reimann as joint director of the Adelaide College of Music.

He was very successful as a lecturer but around the middle of 1891 the partnership was dissolved. The school continued under Reimann and in 1898 developed into the Elder Conservatorium of Music in connexion with the university. Sharp had made many friends and an address with over 300 signatures asked him to continue his work at Adelaide, but he decided to return to England and arrived there in January 1892. During his stay in Adelaide he composed the music for an operetta &quot;Dimple&#x27;s Lovers&quot; performed by the Adelaide Garrick Club at the Albert Hall on 9 September 1890, and two light operas, &quot;Sylvia&quot;, which was produced at the Theatre Royal on 4 December 1890, and &quot;The Jonquil&quot;. The libretto in each case was written by Guy Boothby. Sharp also wrote the music for some nursery rhymes which were sung by the Cathedral Choral Society.

==Return to England==
In 1892 Sharp returned to England and on 22 August 1893 at East Clevedon, Somerset, he married Constance Dorothea Birch, also a music lover. They had three daughters and a son. Also in 1893 he was taken on as a music teacher by Ludgrove School, a preparatory school then in North London. During his seventeen years in the post, he took on a number of other musical jobs. After his marriage in 1893, Sharp became a vegetarian for health reasons and took interest in spiritualism and theosophy.

From 1896 Sharp was Principal of the Hampstead Conservatoire of Music, a half-time post which provided a house. In July 1905 he resigned from this post after a prolonged dispute about payment and his right to take on students for extra tuition. He had to leave the Principal&#x27;s house, and apart from his position at Ludgrove his income was henceforth derived largely from lecturing and publishing on folk music.

===English folk song and dance===

Sharp was not the first to research folk songs in England, which had already been studied by late-19th century collectors like Lucy Broadwood, Frank Kidson and Sabine Baring-Gould. He became aware of English folk music in 1899, when he witnessed a display by the Headington Quarry Morris dancers just outside Oxford. He approached their musician William Kimber, an expert player of the Anglo-concertina and a skilled dancer, and asked permission to notate some of the dances. Kimber went on to become Sharp&#x27;s main source for the notation of Cotswold Morris Dancing, gave demonstrations his lectures, and became a lifelong friend.

In August 1903, Sharp visited the home of his friend Charles Marson, a Christian Socialist he had met in Adelaide, and by then a vicar in Hambridge, Somerset. There he heard the gardener John England sing the traditional song &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot;. Although Sharp had already joined the Folk-Song Society in 1901, this was his first experience of folk song in the field, and it set him on a new career path. Between 1904 and 1914 he collected more than 1,600 songs in rural Somerset and over 700 songs from elsewhere in England. He published five volumes of Folk Songs from Somerset and numerous other books, including collections of sea shanties and folk carols, and became a passionate advocate for folk song, giving numerous lectures, and setting out his manifesto in &quot;English Folk Song: Some Conclusions&quot; in 1907.

In the years between 1907 and the First World War, Sharp became more focussed on traditional dance. In 1905 he met Mary Neal, the organiser of the Espérance Girls&#x27; Club, a philanthropic organisation for working-class young women in London, who was seeking suitable dances for them to perform. This initiated a partnership which, though initially cordial and successful, soured over an ideological disagreement, Sharp&#x27;s insistence on correct traditional practice coming up against Neal&#x27;s preference for flamboyance and energy. This developed into a power struggle over control of the Morris dance movement, and finally into a public feud. Sharp pursued his interest in dance through a teaching post at the new School of Morris Dancing under the auspices of the South West Polytechnic in Chelsea, set up by the Principal, Dorette Wilkie, and stepped up his field collecting efforts, resulting in the publication of his notations over five volumes of &quot;The Morris Book&quot; (1907–1913). It has been argued that Sharp emphasised the Cotswold tradition of Morris dancing at the expense of other regional styles, although he did collect dances in Derbyshire.

Sharp also developed an interest in sword dancing, and between 1911 and 1913 published three volumes of &quot;The Sword Dances of Northern England&quot;, which described the obscure and near-extinct Rapper sword dances of Northumbria and Long Sword dances of North Yorkshire. This led to the revival of both traditions in their home areas, and later elsewhere.

===Sharp as fieldworker===
Sharp, assisted initially by Marson, worked by asking around in rural Somerset communities for people who might sing old songs and located many informants, the sisters Louisa Hooper and Lucy White of Langport amongst the most prolific. Sharp was able to relate well to people of a different social class, and established friendships with several singers; after his death Louisa Hooper wrote of his generosity in terms of payments, gifts and outings. He also collected a significant number of songs from Gypsies. In the Appalachians Sharp and Maud Karpeles similarly used local knowledge and their own initiative to find singers, and again made lasting friendships.

Sharp notated songs mostly by ear. He experimented with the new technology of the phonograph, but rejected it on account of a lack of portability and potential intimidatory effect. He had assistance in taking down lyrics from Marson in Somerset, and Karpeles in the Appalachians, while making the musical notations himself. His transcriptions, which included melodic variations, were generally accurate, although some nuances were missed. Sharp was meticulous in noting singers’ names, locations and dates, enabling subsequent biographical research. He made many photographic portraits of singers at their homes or workplaces, providing a valuable record of life amongst rural working people in both South-West England and the Appalachian Mountains.

===Folk song in schools===
In 1902, at a time when state-sponsored mass public schooling was in its infancy, Sharp, then a music teacher, compiled a song book for use in schools. This contained a mixture of patriotic ‘National Songs’ (&quot;The British Grenadiers&quot;, &quot;Rule Britannia&quot;, etc.) and folk material. As his knowledge of folk song grew, he rejected the ‘National Songs’, which were absent from the 1906 collection &quot;English Folk Songs for Schools&quot;, co-written with Baring-Gould and using Sharp&#x27;s piano arrangements. Sharp was determined that folk song should be at the heart of the curriculum, and fought the Board of Education in 1905 over their list of songs recommended for schools, which included many ‘National Songs’. His colleagues Frank Kidson and Lucy Broadwood, did not share his view, however, and the committee of the Folk-Song Society voted to approve the Board&#x27;s list, causing a rift with Sharp.

===Sharp&#x27;s theories===
After his struggle with the Board of Education, Sharp published &quot;English Folk Song: Some Conclusions&quot;, in which he pursued his ideas about folk songs in schools. His main aim was to expound a theory for the development of folk song, based on Darwinian evolution and oral transmission - the passage of songs down the generations by word of mouth. Sharp put forward three principles: &quot;Continuity&quot; – individual songs had survived recognisably over centuries; &quot;Variation&quot; – songs existed in multiple versions as singers altered them; and &quot;Selection&quot; – a community would choose the most pleasing version. This implied that songs had no individual composer, since they had evolved to their present form &quot;as the pebble on the sea shore is rounded and polished by the action of the waves&quot;. However, some in the folk song movement, such as Kidson, were sceptical of this theory.

Sharp argued that folk songs expressed Englishness, and it was vital that they should be taught in schools to inculcate a sense of national identity. He also suggested that their melodies should form the basis of a new English movement in art music, in competition with the musical hegemony of Germany, a belief shared by Vaughan Williams and other composers.

===Bowdlerisation===
Sharp and Marson bowdlerised some of their song texts, especially those containing references to sexual intercourse. Given the prudery of the Edwardian era, these could never have been published in full (especially in a school textbook), but Sharp did note such lyrics accurately in his field notebooks, thus preserving them for posterity. A good example of the transformation of a formerly erotic song into one suitable for all audiences is &quot;Gently Johnny My Jingalo&quot;. The immediate goal of Sharp&#x27;s project – disseminating the distinctive, and hitherto little known &quot;melodies&quot; of these songs through music education – might also explain why he considered the song texts less important.

===English Folk Dance Society, afterwards English Folk Dance and Song Society===
In 1911 Sharp co-founded the English Folk Dance Society, which promoted the traditional dances through workshops held nationwide, and which later merged with the Folk-Song Society in 1932 to form the English Folk Dance and Song Society (EFDSS). The current London headquarters of the EFDSS is named Cecil Sharp House in his honour.

===Influence on English classical music===
Sharp&#x27;s work coincided with a period of nationalism in classical music, the idea being to reinvigorate and give distinctiveness to English classical composition by grounding it in the characteristic melodic patterns and recognisable tone intervals and ornaments of its national folk music. Among the composers who took up this goal was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who incorporated many melodies from Sharp&#x27;s collections into his compositions, as well as a number from his own fieldwork in England.

==In America==
 During the years of the First World War, Sharp found it difficult to support himself through his customary work in England, and decided to try to earn his living in the United States. He was invited to act as dance consultant for a 1915 New York production of &quot;A Midsummer Night’s Dream&quot; and went on to give successful lectures and classes across the country on English folk song and especially folk dance. He met the wealthy philanthropist Helen Storrow in Boston, and with her and other colleagues was instrumental in setting up the Country Dance and Song Society. He also met Olive Dame Campbell, who brought with her a portfolio of British-origin ballads she had collected in the Southern Appalachian mountains. The quality of her collection convinced Sharp to make several song collecting expeditions into the remote mountain backcountry with his collaborator Maud Karpeles during the years 1916–1918, following in the footsteps of Olive Campbell and other collectors such as Lorraine Wyman and Katherine Jackson French. Travelling through the Appalachian Mountains in Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee, often covering many miles on foot over rough terrain, Sharp and Karpeles recorded a treasure trove of folk songs, many of British origin, though in versions quite different from those Sharp had collected in rural England, and some altogether extinct in the old country. In remote log cabins Sharp would notate the tunes by ear, while Karpeles took down the words, and they collected songs from singers including Jane Hicks Gentry, Mary Sands and young members of the Ritchie family of Kentucky. Sharp was particularly interested in the tunes, which he found very beautiful and often set in ‘gapped scales’. 
Sharp wrote the following words a few weeks after his arrival in Appalachia:

 The people are just English of the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century.  They speak English, look English, and their manners are old-fashioned English.  Heaps of words and expressions they use habitually in ordinary conversation are obsolete, and have been in England a long time.  I find them very easy to get on with, and have no difficulty in making them sing and show their enthusiasm for their songs.  I have taken down very nearly one hundred already, and many of these are quite unknown to me and aesthetically of the very highest value.  Indeed, it is the greatest discovery I have made since the original one I made in England sixteen years ago.

This strong focus on &#x27;Englishness&#x27; is evident in Sharp&#x27;s work, and he has been criticised for failing to recognise that many of the songs he collected were derived from the Scottish rather than the English ballad tradition.

Olive Dame Campbell and her husband John had led Sharp and Karpeles to areas with a high concentration of white people of English or Scots-Irish ancestry, so the collectors had little sense of the cultural mosaic of White, Black, Indigenous and multiracial Americans that existed across Appalachia, or of the interactions between these groups that had resulted in a dynamic, hybridised folk tradition. For instance, having witnessed in white communities a form of square dancing that he christened the “Kentucky Running Set”, Sharp interpreted it inaccurately as the survival of a 17th-century English style, whereas in fact it contained significant African-American and European elements.

In their search for communities rich in British-origin songs, Sharp and Karpeles avoided German-American communities, and on one occasion turned back from a village when they realised it was an African-American settlement. Using an offensive term then in common usage, Sharp wrote: &quot;We tramped – mainly uphill. When we reached the cove we found it peopled by n----s ... All our troubles and spent energy for nought.&quot; However, unlike other mountain collectors of the time he did take down ballads from two Black singers, one of whom he described in his field notes thus: “Aunt Maria [Tomes] is an old coloured woman who was a slave belonging to Mrs Coleman... she sang very beautifully in a wonderfully musical way and with clear and perfect intonation... rather a nice old lady&quot;.

Sharp and Karpeles noted down a huge number of songs, many of which would otherwise have been lost, and contributed to the continuing tradition of balladry in the Appalachian Mountains. Their collection was described by ballad expert Bertrand Bronson as “without question the foremost contribution to the study of British-American folk-song”, and by Archie Green as a “monumental contribution… an unending scroll in cultural understanding”. However, it can be argued that a fascination with Child Ballads and other old British material led him and the other fieldworkers of his era to misrepresent Appalachian folk music as an overwhelmingly Anglo-Saxon or Celtic tradition, and overlook its cultural diversity.

Elizabeth DiSavino, in her 2020 biography of Katherine Jackson French, has claimed that Sharp had neglected to give proper acknowledgement to female and Scottish-diaspora sources, although in fact he mentioned both in his Introduction to &quot;English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians&quot;.

==Political views==

Sharp identified with the political left of his day. He joined the Fabian Society, a Socialist organisation, in 1900, and in later years became a supporter of the Labour Party. In his younger days he was considered a radical and, according to a teaching colleague, liked to “pull the legs off the Tories”. While at Cambridge, Sharp heard the lectures of William Morris, which probably influenced his later self-description as a ‘conservative socialist’, since his opposition to capitalism went alongside a suspicion of the Industrial Revolution and modernity in general, and a belief in the virtues of rural over urban life. He wrote of his anger about the ‘injustice of class distinctions’, believed in collectivism over private enterprise, and in later life wrote of his sympathy with striking coal miners. He also believed in democracy over totalitarianism, holding that “any form of collectivist government must also be democratic if it is to function properly”, and expressing scepticism about the Bolshevik revolution in Russia.

Sharp was an opponent of capital punishment. He was not, however, a supporter of the Suffragette movement, although according to his colleague and biographer Maud Karpeles this probably reflected a disapproval of their methods rather than the principle. Despite this, he maintained a friendly relationship with his sister Evelyn, an avid suffragist who was imprisoned for her activities; after her release from Holloway she wrote to Sharp stating that she had no wish to quarrel over the matter, and that she did not believe he was a “confirmed ‘anti’”. Sharp was a nationalist, and believed that exposure to English folk song would engender a spirit of patriotism.

==Death==

Sharp died of cancer of the upper respiratory system at Hampstead on 23 June 1924.

==Criticism==

Sharp’s ideas held sway for half a century after his death, thanks in part to an uncritical and rose-tinted biography co-authored by his disciple Maud Karpeles, who also enshrined his thinking in the 1954 definition of folk song drawn up by the International Folk Music Council. A. L. Lloyd, a Marxist and the chief theoretician of the second folk song revival during the 1960s, affected to repudiate Sharp’s ideas but in fact followed much of his thinking. He rejected Sharp’s claim that folk song could be found only in isolated rural communities as “primitive romanticism”, and described his piano arrangements as “false and unrepresentative”, but praised his ability as a collector, admired his analysis of modal tunes, and used numerous examples from his manuscripts as illustrations.

A more radical Marxist analysis was offered in the 1970s by David Harker, questioning the motivations and methods of folk revivalists, and accusing Sharp of having manipulated his research for ideological reasons. According to Harker:
&quot;&#x27;[F]olk song&#x27; as mediated by Cecil Sharp, [is] to be used as &#x27;raw material&#x27; or &#x27;instrument&#x27;, being extracted from a tiny fraction of the rural proletariat and... imposed upon town and country alike for the people&#x27;s own good, not in its original form, but, suitably integrated into the Conservatoire curriculum, made the basis of nationalistic sentiments and bourgeois values.&quot;
Harker expanded this thesis in the influential &quot;Fakesong&quot; in 1985, dismissing the concept of folk song as &quot;intellectual rubble which needs to be shifted so that building can begin again&quot;, and attacking scholars from Francis James Child to A. L. Lloyd. Folk song collecting, scholarship, and revival were viewed as forms of appropriation and exploitation by the bourgeoisie of the working class, and Sharp in particular was strongly criticised. An expert on printed broadsides, Harker argued against the oral tradition and maintained that most of what Sharp had termed &quot;folk song&quot; in fact originated from commercially produced print copies. He also claimed that Sharp and Marson had bowdlerised or otherwise tampered with the songs, making &quot;hundreds of alterations, additions and omissions&quot; in their published material.

&quot;Fakesong&quot; led to a widespread reappraisal of the work of Sharp and his colleagues. Michael Pickering concluded that: &quot;Harker has provided a firm foundation for future work&quot;, while Vic Gammon commented that &quot;Fakesong&quot; had taken on &quot;the status of an orthodoxy in some quarters of the British left&quot;, and represented &quot;the beginning of critical work&quot; on the early folk music movement - although he stated later that, &quot;this does not mean that Harker got it all right.&quot;

A more critical analysis was offered by C. J. Bearman, who noted numerous statistical discrepancies in Harker&#x27;s claims that Sharp and Marson&#x27;s choices of songs for publication were unrepresentative: &quot;It is an interesting variety of mistake which so consistently produces errors in favour of the argument being presented.” Bearman also disputed Harker&#x27;s claims of mass bowdlerisation, on grounds firstly of factual misrepresentation and exaggeration, secondly for ignoring constraints on publishing erotic material in the Edwardian era, and thirdly for omitting the fact that Sharp had been open about his edits and preserved the original texts. In another paper, Bearman disputed statistics from Somerset communities that had been employed by Harker to challenge the notion of a rural peasantry.

Harker&#x27;s contention that much of the material collected by Sharp and others had its origins in commercial print is now widely accepted, however, and Sharp&#x27;s narrow definition of what constituted &quot;folk song&quot; has been broadened considerably in more recent scholarship.

In 1993 Georgina Boyes produced her book &quot;The Imagined Village – Culture, ideology and the English Folk Revival&quot;, which critiqued the Victorian and Edwardian folk song revival for having invented a culturally anachronistic rural community – &quot;The Folk&quot; - and making unrepresentative collections of songs to support the idea. The book was also critical of Sharp&#x27;s controlling tendencies, which some of his contemporaries complained about, and interpreted the power struggle with Mary Neal over control of the Morris dance movement in terms of a patriarchal refusal to share power with a woman. Roy Judge&#x27;s accounts, however, apportion blame more even-handedly and stress their ideological disagreement. There has also been criticism of Sharp&#x27;s attitude towards the social dance activist Elizabeth Burchenal in the USA.

Sharp&#x27;s song collecting in the USA has also been the subject of controversy amongst American scholars of cultural politics. Henry Shapiro held him responsible in part for the perception of Appalachian mountain culture as &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot;, while Benjamin Filene and Daniel Walkowitz claimed that Sharp had neglected to collect fiddle tunes, hymns, recent compositions, and songs of African-American origin. David Whisnant made similar claims about his selectivity, but praised him for being &quot;serious, industrious and uniformly gracious to and respectful of local people&quot;. More recently, Phil Jamison has stated that Sharp &quot;was interested only in English music and dances. He ignored the rest&quot;. However, Brian Peters’ detailed analysis of Sharp&#x27;s collection identified a large number of American-made songs, plus hymns, fiddle tunes, and songs which Sharp himself described as having &quot;negro&quot; origins.

<text>A film recorder is a graphical output device for transferring images to photographic film from a digital source. In a typical film recorder, an image is passed from a host computer to a mechanism to expose film through a variety of methods, historically by direct photography of a high-resolution cathode-ray tube (CRT) display. The exposed film can then be developed using conventional developing techniques, and displayed with a slide or motion picture projector. The use of film recorders predates the current use of digital projectors, which eliminate the time and cost involved in the intermediate step of transferring computer images to film stock, instead directly displaying the image signal from a computer. Motion picture film scanners are the opposite of film recorders, copying content from film stock to a computer system. Film recorders can be thought of as modern versions of kinescopes.

==Design==
===Operation===
All film recorders typically work in the same manner. The image is fed from a host computer as a raster stream over a digital interface. A film recorder exposes film through various mechanisms; flying spot (early recorders); photographing a high resolution video monitor; electron beam recorder (Sony HDVS); a CRT scanning dot (Celco); focused beam of light from a light valve technology (LVT) recorder; a scanning laser beam (Arrilaser); or recently, full-frame LCD array chips.

For color image recording on a CRT film recorder, the red, green, and blue channels are sequentially displayed on a single gray scale CRT, and exposed to the same piece of film as a multiple exposure through a filter of the appropriate color. This approach yields better resolution and color quality than possible with a tri-phosphor color CRT. The three filters are usually mounted on a motor-driven wheel. The filter wheel, as well as the camera&#x27;s shutter, aperture, and film motion mechanism are usually controlled by the recorder&#x27;s electronics and/or the driving software. CRT film recorders are further divided into analog and digital types. The analog film recorder uses the native video signal from the computer, while the digital type uses a separate display board in the computer to produce a digital signal for a display in the recorder. Digital CRT recorders provide a higher resolution at a higher cost compared to analog recorders due to the additional specialized hardware. Typical resolutions for digital recorders were quoted as 2K and 4K, referring to 2048×1366 and 4096×2732 pixels, respectively, while analog recorders provided a resolution of 640×428 pixels in comparison.

Higher-quality LVT film recorders use a focused beam of light to write the image directly onto a film loaded spinning drum, one pixel at a time. In one example, the light valve was a liquid-crystal shutter, the light beam was steered with a lens, and text was printed using a pre-cut optical mask. The LVT will record pixel beyond grain. Some machines can burn 120-res or 120 lines per millimeter. The LVT is basically a reverse drum scanner. The exposed film is developed and printed by regular photographic chemical processing.

===Formats===

Film recorders are available for a variety of film types and formats. The 35 mm negative film and transparencies are popular because they can be processed by any photo shop. Single-image 4×5 film and 8×10 are often used for high-quality, large format printing.

Some models have detachable film holders to handle multiple formats with the same camera or with Polaroid backs to provide on-site review of output before exposing film.

==Uses==

Film recorders are used in digital printing to generate master negatives for offset and other bulk printing processes. For preview, archiving, and small-volume reproduction, film recorders have been rendered obsolete by modern printers that produce photographic-quality hardcopies directly on plain paper.

They are also used to produce the master copies of movies that use computer animation or other special effects based on digital image processing. However, most cinemas nowadays use Digital Cinema Packages on hard drives instead of film stock. 

===Computer graphics===
Film recorders were among the earliest computer graphics output devices; for example, the IBM 740 CRT Recorder was announced in 1954.

Film recorders were also commonly used to produce slides for slide projectors; but this need is now largely met by video projectors that project images directly from a computer to a screen. The terms &quot;slide&quot; and &quot;slide deck&quot; are still commonly used in presentation programs.

===Current uses===
Currently, film recorders are primarily used in the motion picture film-out process for the ever increasing amount of digital intermediate work being done. Although significant advances in large venue video projection alleviates the need to output to film, there remains a deadlock between the motion picture studios and theater owners over who should pay for the cost of these very costly projection systems. This, combined with the increase in international and independent film production, will keep the demand for film recording steady for at least a decade.

==Key manufacturers==

Traditional film recorder manufacturers have all but vanished from the scene or have evolved their product lines to cater to the motion picture industry. Dicomed was one such early provider of digital color film recorders. 
Polaroid, Management Graphics, Inc, MacDonald-Detwiler, Information International, Inc., and Agfa were other producers of film recorders. Arri is the only current major manufacturer of film recorders.

*Kodak Lightning I film recorder. One of the first laser recorders. Needed an engineering staff to set up.
*Kodak Lightning II film recorder used both gas and diode laser to record on to film.
*The last LVT machines produced by Kodak / Durst-Dice stopped production in 2002. There are no LVT film recorders currently being produced. LVT Saturn 1010 uses a LED exposure (RGB) to 8&quot;x10&quot; film at 1000-3000ppi.
* LUX Laser Cinema Recorder from Autologic/Information International in Thousand Oaks, California. Sales end in March 2000. Used on the 1997 film “Titanic”.
*Arri produces the Arrilaser line of laser-based motion picture film recorders.
*MGI produced the &quot;Solitaire&quot; line of CRT-based motion picture film recorders.
*Matrix, originally ImaPRO, a branch of Agfa Division, produced the &quot;QCR&quot; line of CRT-based motion picture film recorders.
*CCG, formerly Agfa film recorders, has been a steady manufacturer of film recorders based in Germany.
*In 2004 CCG introduced Definity, a motion picture film recorder utilizing LCD technology. In 2010 CCG introduced the first full LED LCD film recorder as a new step in film recording.
*Cinevator was made by Cinevation AS, in Drammen, Norway. The Cinevator was a real-time digital film recorder. It could record IN, IP and prints with and without sound
*Oxberry produced the Model 3100 film recorder camera system, with interchangeable pin-registered movements (shuttles) for 35 mm (full frame/Silent, 1.33:1) and 16 mm (regular 16, &quot;2R&quot;), and others have adapted the Oxberry movements for CinemaScope, 1.85:1, 1.75:1, 1.66:1, as well as Academy/Sound (1.37:1) in 35 mm and Super-16 in 16 mm (&quot;1R&quot;). For instance, the &quot;Solitaire&quot; and numerous others employed the Oxberry 3100 camera system.

==History==

Before video tape recorders or VTRs were invented, TV shows were either broadcast live or recorded to film for later showing, using the kinescope process. In 1967, CBS Laboratories introduced the Electronic Video Recording format, which used video and telecined-to-video film sources, which were then recorded with an electron-beam recorder at CBS&#x27; EVR mastering plant at the time to 35mm film stock in a rank of 4 strips on the film, which was then slit down to 4 film copies, for playback in an EVR player.

All types of CRT recorders were (and still are) used for film recording. Some early examples used for computer-output recording were the 1954 IBM 740 CRT Recorder, and the 1962 Stromberg-Carlson SC-4020, the latter using a Charactron CRT for text and vector graphic output to either 16 mm motion picture film, 16 mm microfilm, or hard-copy paper output. 

Later 1970 and 80s-era recording to B&amp;W (and color, with 3 separate exposures for red, green, and blue)) 16 mm film was done with an EBR (Electron Beam Recorder), the most prominent examples made by 3M), for both video and COM (Computer Output Microfilm) applications. Image Transform in Universal City, California used specially modified 3M EBR film recorders that could perform color film-out recording on 16 mm by exposing three 16 mm frames in a row (one red, one green and one blue). The film was then printed to color 16 mm or 35 mm film. The video fed to the recorder could either be NTSC, PAL or SECAM. Later, Image Transform used specially modified VTRs to record 24 frame for their &quot;Image Vision&quot; system. The modified 1 inch type B videotape VTRs would record and play back 24frame video at 10 MHz bandwidth, at about twice the normal NTSC resolution. Modified 24fps 10 MHz Bosch Fernseh KCK-40 cameras were used on the set. This was a custom pre-HDTV video system. Image Transform had modified other gear for this process. At its peak, this system was used in the production of the film &quot;Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot; in 1982. This was the first major pre-digital intermediate post production using a film recorder for film-out production.

In 1980 film recorder was made in LIKI in USSR.

In 1988, companies in the United States collectively produced 715 million slides at a cost of $8.3 billion.

===Awards===
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded an Oscar to the makers of the Arrilaser film recorder. The Award of Merit Oscar from the Academy Scientific and Technical Award ceremony was given on 11 February 2012 to Franz Kraus, Johannes Steurer and Wolfgang Riedel. Steurer was awarded the Oskar Messter Memorial Medal two years later in 2014 for his role in the development of the Arrilaser.

<text>The Texas A&amp;M University Corps of Cadets (often The Corps of Cadets, or simply the Corps) is a student military organization at Texas A&amp;M University. Established with the university in 1876, it is the oldest student organization on campus.

Students who elect to join the Corps must participate in mandatory Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) courses and training for the first three semesters, but they are optional after that. All cadets are required to attend leadership classes in the School of Military Science coordinated by the Commandant&#x27;s Office. Approximately 45 percent of the members of the Cadet Corps continue with the ROTC curriculum, contract with the military, and receive commissions as officers in the United States armed forces upon graduation. Juniors and seniors who do not have military contracts to receive commissions but wish to remain members of the Cadet Corps are classified as &quot;Drill &amp; Ceremonies&quot; (D&amp;C) cadets. As established under federal law, Texas A&amp;M is one of six U.S. colleges classified as senior military colleges and is the largest.

==History==
===Early years===
The Corps of Cadets was founded in 1876 with the creation of the all-male, military-focused Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas under the Morrill Act of 1862. The Morrill Act did not specify the extent of military training, leading many land-grant schools to provide only minimal training, Texas A&amp;M was an exception. The only mention of military training is in Section 4:
&quot;...the leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies, and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts...&quot;

In 1876, Robert Page Waller Morris, a 1872 graduate of Virginia Military Institute, joined the university staff and was assigned as the first Commandant of the Corps. In this role, he drafted the first set of Corps regulations and designed the first cadet uniform. Prior to joining Texas A&amp;M, Morris served as a professor at the Texas Military Institute alongside John Garland James and Hardaway Hunt Dinwiddie, who were also VMI cadets. James and Dinwiddie both became future presidents of Texas A&amp;M. Morris&#x27; experience at VMI and TMI influenced the foundation he laid for Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s interpretation of the Morrill Act of 1862. P. L. Downs, Class of 1879 and private secretary to Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s 1st president, Thomas S. Gathright, was quoted on the president&#x27;s stance regarding military discipline at the university. &quot;Gathright was wholly opposed to any military discipline. He believed in putting the boys on their honor and trusting them implicitly, and yet Major Morris, as Commandant, insisted upon carrying out the governmental requirements as to military training and that did not altogether suit the president.&quot;In November 1879 the first administration was dismissed, including Morris. The board was not happy with the direction of the college and a great rift had developed in the faculty due to an event known as the &quot;Crisp Affair.&quot; The four-day proceedings are well documented in the Galveston Daily News. 

The board quickly restaffed the faculty, largely with members from the Texas Military Institute. John Garland James, then president of TMI, was named as the 2nd president of the university. One of James&#x27; first hires was John Waller Clark, a recent VMI graduate, to serve as the Assistant Commandant. During his tenure, James strongly advocated for the military training aspect of A&amp;M&#x27;s curriculum. The following is a quote from John Garland James regarding his beliefs about military training in an academic setting.&quot;The military system of school government... tends to develop in the student a high sense of personal honor and moral responsibility, and to give him those habits of regularity, promptness, self-reliance, and respect for proper authority, which go far to make the good citizen and the successful man of business. It thus becomes a potent factor in the formation of true character.&quot;

In 1883, out of frustration, James resigned, and James Reid Cole was named 3rd president of the university. Cole served as president for only a few months when the board made a surprise move removing Cole from the office of president naming Hardaway Hunt Dinwiddie in the new position of Chairman of the Faculty. Dinwiddie was also VMI alumnus and a strong believer in military training. By the time of Dinwiddie&#x27;s unfortunate passing in 1887, Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s military tradition was strongly instituted.

Through the first four administrations there were overtures to reduce the military aspect of Texas A&amp;M. The first president, Thomas S. Gathright, was not a strong advocate and often had differences with Morris. James faced criticisms of the regimen from the state legislature, and Dinwiddie faced the pressures of strong competition from the newly formed University of Texas at Austin.

For the school&#x27;s first thirty-one years, through the 1907–08 academic year, the Cadet Corps was organized into one battalion consisting of two to four companies, designated companies &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot;. Early on, these were designated &quot;Infantry&quot; companies, but the Commandant ensured that Artillery training was included in the military instruction. The Aggie Band was organized in 1894 as a permanent institution within the Corps. In 1908, with enrollment over 570, a second battalion was added. As enrollment climbed, the Cadet Corps continued to grow to multiple battalions, each with two to four companies, and the Corps became divided into multiple regiments.

The academic year 1916–17 saw the division of the Corps into two regiments. The following year, the two regiments had a total of six battalions composed of eighteen companies and a battery of field artillery. In 1918, enrollment surged to 1,284, almost a fifty percent increase over the previous year. In the 1919–20 school year, a Signal Corps battalion and a Mounted Cavalry battalion (later called a &quot;cavalry squadron&quot;) with one cavalry troop were added. An Air Service squadron with one company-sized &quot;flight&quot; was added in the 1920–21 school year.

In the fall of 1923, the Cadet Corps, with a total of 2,091 cadets in twenty-three individual units, became divided between the Infantry Regiment and the Composite Regiment. The Composite Regiment included the Cavalry, Field Artillery, Air Service and Signal Corps units. The Air Corps Squadron (formerly Air Service Squadron) was phased out at the end of the 1927–28 school year. In the fall of 1928, with enrollment at 2,770 cadets, an Engineer Battalion was added, and the following year a third regiment was formed out of the expanded Field Artillery Battalion. A fourth battalion, the Coast Artillery, was added to the Composite Regiment in the fall of 1933.

The Cadet Corps enrollment hit a peak of 2,770 in 1928, but the Great Depression took its toll, and by the fall of 1932 enrollment had fallen to 2,001. But as the Depression waned and the U.S. involvement in the war became imminent, enrollment climbed back to a pre-War total of over 6,500 in the fall of 1941. In 1935, swelling enrollment forced the formation of an Engineer Regiment and a Cavalry Regiment. With these two new regiments, added to the Infantry, Field Artillery and Composite regiments, the Cadet Corps, for the first time in its history, now had a total of 5 regiments, encompassing thirty-two individual units (companies, batteries and troops). That same year, a Chemical Warfare Service Company was added to the Composite Regiment, and the following year a second company warranted the formation of a Chemical Warfare Service Battalion. A sixth regiment, the Coast Artillery Regiment, was added in 1937. In 1939, the Band had grown to the point that it was now divided into two units, the Infantry and Artillery Bands.

In the fall of 1942, as citizens of Texas responded to America&#x27;s need for military officers, the number of individual military units in the Cadet Corps hit an all-time high with a total of seven regiments of seventeen battalions comprising sixty companies, batteries, and troops, including the Band. The Cadet Corps at Texas A&amp;M sent over 20,229 former cadets into World War II, 14,123 of them as commissioned officers, more than the combined totals of both military academies. By February 1943 enrollment dropped to less than 4,000 as Cadets left school to serve in the U.S. military. The 1944–45 school year saw enrollment drop to as low as 1,600 and the depletion of cadets forced the reorganization of the Corps down to only two regiments (Infantry and Composite) consisting of a total of only 17 companies, batteries and troops, including the two Band units. In 1943, the U.S. Army declared the Mounted Cavalry obsolete, although Cavalry units continued at Texas A&amp;M as mechanized units until the end of the 1949–50 academic year.

===Post-World War II===
World War II and the demands of the U.S. military took their toll on enrollment. But, with the end of the war, as enrollment surged in the fall of 1946, Texas A&amp;M gained the use of Bryan Air Force Base, which was being closed, and converted a number of its buildings into dormitories. In 1947, all entering freshmen, approximately 1,500, were assigned to the Bryan Air Force Base &quot;Annex&quot; which became essentially a freshman campus. The Cadet Corps reorganized again to accommodate these unusual conditions. The 1947–48 Cadet Corps consisted of five regiments, a Headquarters Group, and the Band during that academic year. The five regiments (a combined Infantry and Veterans regiment, an Artillery regiment, a combined Air Force and Cavalry regiment, a combined Engineer and Composite regiment, and the &quot;Training Regiment&quot; consisting of nine companies of freshmen), the Headquarters Group and the Band were composed of a total of 35 individual military units. The 1951–52 academic year saw the organization of the Cadet Corps at is largest in number of individual units. Sixty-six units (companies, batteries and squadrons) were divided among 8 regiments (Infantry, Artillery, Armor/Engineers, First Air Force Wing, 2nd Air Force Wing, Composite Regiment, Seventh Regiment and the Eighth Freshman Training Regiment) consisting of 21 battalions and the Band.

During this post-war era and into the 1950s, the various units of the Corps continued to be identified by their military branch. The traditional branches (Infantry, Field Artillery, Cavalry, Engineers, Coast Artillery, Quartermaster, Ordinance, Signal Corps, Armor, Chemical Corps, Transportation, Army Security, and Army Air Force) continued to be represented. But the strength of air power and the rise of the importance of the U.S. Air Force during this era was evident in the organization of the Cadet Corps as Army Air Corps units became Air Force flights (later squadrons). Veterans companies and flights were formed to separate these older veterans from younger cadets. Beginning in 1948 athletes were organized into their own batteries (later companies) to accommodate special team practice schedules. That same year, 1948, the Freshman Regiment added a Band Company and four Air Force flights for a total of 12 units. The Eighth Freshman Training Regiment was moved to the main campus in the fall of 1950, and by 1951, it consisted of a total of 15 freshman companies, batteries and squadrons, each with a branch designation, attached to which was a Senior Battalion of four companies of cadet Seniors. During the 1953–54 school year, over one-third of the 57 Corps units, a total of 21, consisted of Freshmen. The following year, freshmen were incorporated back into the other Corps units. The 1954–55 school year, saw the Cadet Corps begin to take on the organization (two Army regiments and two Air Force wings, and the Band) that is familiar to most former cadets today. The Band, which in 1939 had divided itself into an Infantry company and an Artillery Battery (Field Artillery Band in 1940), dropped those branch designations in 1947 in favor of the two designations Maroon Band and White Band.

The first unit logos, which later evolved into the now common unit names, began to appear among the Air Force units in the 1955–56 &quot;Aggieland&quot; yearbook. A few of the Army units began to follow suit in the 1957-58 &quot;Aggieland&quot;. But, in the 1959–60 academic year, with the complete reorganization of the First and Second Brigades and the official abandonment of the Army Branch designations, the units in the two Army Brigades began to adopt unit nicknames and mascots, or &quot;outfit logos,&quot; in earnest.
During the Vietnam War era, the Cadet Corps was composed of two to three Army Brigades, two to three Air Force Wings, and the Band. Each brigade was composed of two or three battalions of three to five companies each, and each Wing was composed of two groups of three to six squadrons each. During this period the Corps was composed of as many as 40 individual companies and squadrons, including the Band.

Texas A&amp;M remained a primarily all-male military institution with mandatory membership in the Cadet Corps until 1964, when the school began admitting women. In 1965 Corps membership became voluntary for students.

The Corps first incorporated female members in the fall of 1974. At the time, the women were placed into a special unit, known as W-1. Harassment from their male counterparts was commonplace. Women were initially prohibited from serving in leadership positions or in the more elite Corps units such as the Band and the Ross Volunteers. These groups were opened to female participation in fall of 1985, following a federal court decision in a class-action lawsuit filed by a female cadet; five years later, female-only units were eliminated.

In 1977, Freshman Orientation Week was introduced for incoming fish, culminating in the tradition of the &quot;Fish Review&quot;, which has occurred since 1988.

In 2007, the corps consisted of 3 Brigades, 2 Regiments, 2 Wings, the Aggie Band, and a task force of special units and veterans outfits.

===Historical Service===
Members of the Cadet Corps have served in every major conflict fought by the United States since the Spanish–American War. During World War II, Texas A.M.C. produced 20,229 Aggies who served in combat. Of those, 14,123 were commissioned as officers, more than the combined total of the United States Naval Academy and the United States Military Academy during the same timeframe. Over 250 Aggies have served as generals or flag officers, and eight alumni have been awarded the highest United States military award, the Medal of Honor:

* Horace S. Carswell, Jr., class of 1938
* Thomas W. Fowler, class of 1943
* William G. Harrell, class of 1943
* Lloyd H. Hughes, class of 1943
* George D. Keathley, class of 1937
* Turney W. Leonard, class of 1942
* Eli L. Whiteley, class of 1941
* Clarence E. Sasser, class of 1973*

*Sasser was not in the Corps and joined A&amp;M after receiving his Medal of Honor

=== Modern corps ===
Today, the Cadet Corps is a coeducational institution, and all but eight of its units are gender-integrated. Over 2,500 students, including over 300 women are members of the Corps, and, although this is only a small percentage of the overall student population, the Corps remains a highly visible presence on campus, a reminder of the school&#x27;s origins as an all-male military college. Cadets are active in many campus organizations and are renowned for their school spirit and have the moniker &quot;Keepers of the Spirit&quot;.

All military branches are represented in the organization of the Cadet Corps and is composed of an Air Force/Space Force Wing, an Army Brigade, a Navy/Marine Regiment, as well as The Fightin&#x27; Texas Aggie Band whose members may be affiliated with any military branch.

In December 2018, the Corps of Cadets had the honor, and distinction, of saying their final farewell and salute to George H. W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States of America, as he was laid to rest alongside the late First Lady Barbara Bush and their daughter Robin at the George Bush Presidential Library on the Texas A&amp;M campus.

In April 2022, the campaign &quot;March to 3,000&quot; was launched to grow the Corps of Cadets to 3,000 members from around 2,143 in the fall 2021.

==Organization==
===Office of the Commandant===
The Commandant is the Head of the School of Military Science. Along with his Chief of Staff and Assistant Commandants, they provide administrative and professional leadership for the Corps. Organizationally, the ROTC units are organized under the Commandant led by a representative of each of the military branches: the Professor of Military Science (Army ROTC), the Professor of Naval Science (Navy and Marine Corps ROTC), and the Professor of Aerospace Studies (Air Force and Space Force ROTC).

==== Corps Commandants ====
===Corps Structure===

The Corps of Cadets has its own cadet commander, a Cadet Colonel, the Deputy Corps Commander, the Chief of Staff, the Corps Sergeant Major and 21 other cadet officers and sergeants. The Corps of Cadets is organized and modeled after an army corps including Continental Staff positions in both the Corps leadership and the individual units.

====Corps Organization (2024-2025)====
Key: * male-only unit, # historically STEM unit, ** Pre-professional unit. Note that &quot;Company A-1&quot; or &quot;Squadron 2&quot; are the official designations of the outfits in the Corps. The nicknames of the outfits are included as they are an integral part of the tradition and heritage of the Corps. Squadron 18, K-1, and D-1 are the (transfer) outfits for out-of-cycle cadets who will be completing their freshman year in one semester.

===Special Units===
The following are special units within the Corps of which cadets can additionally be members (for example a cadet in D-2 could be a member of the Ross Volunteers, but not the Band).

====Ross Volunteers====

The Ross Volunteer Company is the official Honor Guard for the Governor of the state of Texas, and, aside from the Cadet Corps itself, is the oldest student organization in the state of Texas. Started in 1887 during the tenure of President H. H. Dinwiddie, the organization was originally named the Scott Volunteers after Col. Thomas M. Scott, the college&#x27;s business manager. In 1898, the company was renamed for Texas A&amp;M President Lawrence Sullivan Ross.

The company is composed of junior and senior cadets. Cadets are chosen on a basis of honor, humility, and character. Each fall, approximately 72 junior cadets are selected into the company by the RV seniors. A critical voting process, undisclosed to outside sources, is conducted to select the new junior inductees. Once the juniors are inducted into the company, it is composed of those newly selected juniors and 35 seniors holding leadership positions. Seniors not selected for leadership positions retain their membership.

Today, the RV uniform is a distinctive white uniform, with yellow trim. Officers in the RV Company (Commanding Officer, Executive Officer, Administrative Officer, Operations Officer, and three Platoon Leaders) as well as one Non-Commissioned Officer (1st Sergeant) wear a silk red sash around the waist of the white uniform. The RV Company performs a 3-volley, 21-gun salute at the traditional Silver Taps ceremony and at the annual campus Muster event. In addition, the RV Company marches in several parades each year including the Rex Parade on Mardi Gras in New Orleans, Louisiana. The RVs serve as the honor guard of Rex, the king of Mardi Gras. Other duties include Texas Gubernatorial events, funerals, weddings, and campus events.

====Fish Drill Team====

This all-freshman precision rifle drill team represents Texas A&amp;M and its Corps of Cadets in competition with other colleges at military drill meets around the nation. The team began when the freshmen were moved from the main campus to deal with the overcrowding and hazing issues that followed World War II and the return of war veterans to the A&amp;M campus. The freshmen were moved to the Riverside Campus Annex and lived in the dorms of the retired Bryan Air Force Base twelve miles from campus. They were bussed to class each day, but primarily lived in isolation from the rest of the Corps. In order to &quot;promote unity and focus on military precision&quot;, the freshmen organized themselves into the Freshman Drill Team in the fall of 1947

Over the following 75 years, the team earned dozens of national championships including every national title since 2004, except 2009, when the team placed 2nd. They were selected to portrayed the United States Marine Corps Silent Drill Platoon during the opening segment of the 1992 film &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; and served as army soldiers in training in &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot;.

Despite a successful record in drill competitions nationwide, in 1997 the Fish Drill Team was put on hiatus for four years due to leadership concerns and issues, most notably hazing of students. The team was reinstated in the spring of 2002.

====Parsons Mounted Cavalry====

Parsons Mounted Cavalry serves as the only mounted ROTC cavalry unit in the country. They were formed in the spring of 1973 to preserve the traditions of the Texas A&amp;M cavalry through the 1930s. The unit represents the university at football games, parades, agricultural, and equestrian events throughout Texas. It is named after Colonel Thomas R. Parsons who oversaw the creation of the unit, former Commandant from 1972 to 1978 and the only active-duty Commandant at Texas A&amp;M.

Within this special unit, Half Section (responsible for Field Artillery and Mule Team elements) maintains the &quot;Spirit of &#x27;02&quot;, a field gun found in the fall of 1974 at a Aggie Bonfire cut site near Easterwood Airport. The cannon is driven by a 4 horse team and a restored caisson to Kyle Field and fired during all home football games, midnight yell practice, and other special events. While Aggie lore states the gun was the runaway that tumbled over a ridge in the film &quot;We&#x27;ve Never Been Licked&quot;, there is no conclusive evidence.

====ROTC special units====
There are many special units under the different ROTC programs and their cadet-led units: The Warrior Training Battalion, the Midshipmen Battalion and Air Force Detachment 805.
==== Other corps organizations ====
*AMC Honor Guard
*Arnold Air Society (Major Horace S. Carswell Jr. Squadron)
*C.A.D.E.T (Cultural Awareness and Diversity Expansion Team)
*Color Guard
*Corps Center Guard
*Corps Cybersecurity Special Unit
*Gen. O.R. Simpson Honor Society
*Major General T. G. Darling Recruiting Company
**Summer Recruiting Company
*Aggie Eagle Post. Cadets who have earned the Boy Scouts of America, Eagle Scout rank, or the Girl Scouts of the USA, Gold Award, are eligible to join. Members conduct community-wide and scout related service as well as participate in/lead various scouting events at both the state and local level. While the unit has held an active status with the university, the unit was formally reactivated/recognized by the Corps in the fall of 2015.

== Class system ==

As a member of the Corps, a cadet climbs through four classes of seniority. The current Corps of Cadets uniform is unique among military schools, bearing a close resemblance to the US Army uniforms from after World War I to World War II known as Pinks and greens. There are slight differences in the uniform worn by each class year, noted below, including the Senior Boots, calf-skin riding boots harkening back to the US Army cavalry officer&#x27;s uniform of World War I. All cadets wear the same basic Corps uniform regardless of service affiliation.

=== Freshmen ===

Freshman cadets are called fish. The first year, is analogous to the experiences of the Rooks at Norwich University, Knobs at The Citadel, Rats of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets and the Virginia Military Institute, Frogs at University of North Georgia, Doolies at the United States Air Force Academy, or Plebes at any of the other U.S. Federal Service Academies.

Both freshmen and sophomore cadets are required to wear metal taps on the heels of their shoes. In addition, male fish must maintain an extremely short hairstyle known colloquially as a &quot;fish cut&quot;. Corps freshmen are not addressed by their first name; a freshman named John Smith would become fish Smith his freshman year in the Corps. A freshman whose last name is not known to the speaker is referred to by the generic name &quot;fish Jones.&quot; Cadets who started in the same class year are known as buddies.

In addition to standardized answers, every fish is required to know the answers to a wide number of questions including, &quot;What&#x27;s for chow?&quot;, &quot;How many days until Final Review?&quot;, and a long list of university history questions. Upon meeting an upperclassman fish must introduce themselves and learn the upperclassman&#x27;s name. As the academic year progresses, some upperclassmen will begin to grant the fish permission to use his or her first name and speak more informally.

=== Sophomores ===
 in the Corps are known as pissheads, often bowdlerized as &quot;head&quot;. A sophomore&#x27;s duty in the Corps is to train and drill the freshmen through all their necessary duties and responsibilities through Final Review in May. They are graded by the performance of their freshmen. Much like drill sergeants, the pissheads are responsible for seeing that the fish adapt and excel in Corps life through rigorous, diligent, and sometimes intense instruction. Sophomores are expected to be the best example of cadets for their fish. It is generally considered bad form for a junior or senior to correct a sophomore in view of freshmen.

=== Juniors ===

As a , the cadet is called a &quot;sergebutt&quot; or more commonly just butt. The nickname is a result of a junior privilege to purchase tailor made the serge uniforms which were easier to maintain and required less ironing. The Corps juniors, wearing a white braid on their garrison caps and white cotton belts, run the daily operations of the Corps. They hold the rank of cadet sergeant through cadet sergeant major, depending on the position attained.

=== Seniors ===
Senior cadets are often referred to as &quot;zips&quot; (short for &quot;zipperheads&quot;), referring to the black and gold &quot;zipper&quot; braid on the garrison cap. A senior may also be referred to as an &quot;elephant,&quot; which derives from the senior class Elephant Walk tradition held the week before the last regularly scheduled football game of the year. Seniors hold cadet officer rank, from Cadet 2nd Lieutenant to Cadet Colonel of the Corps.

Senior cadets, like all seniors at Texas A&amp;M, may also order an Aggie Ring, the symbol of the university and one&#x27;s graduating class.

A senior cadet is easily recognized by the distinctive brown calf-skin leather boots, known as senior boots, sabre, and gold braid on the garrison cap. Seniors are the only class allowed to wear their bider without a break or fold in the top seam.

==Corps Life==
Today, cadets no longer occupy all of the student housing on campus. The Corps is housed only in the dorms located in what is now called &quot; the Quadrangle, a.k.a. &quot;the Quad&quot;. They are divided into companies, batteries, and squadrons, and serve as the basic units of the Corps of Cadets. These units are aligned by ROTC affiliation under a Navy/Marine Regiment, an Air Force Wing, an Army Brigade, a veteran&#x27;s company, and the Combined Band.

There are normally two Corps formations each day—one in the morning and one in the evening to observe the raising and lowering of the American Flag before marching to Duncan Dining Hall for chow. In addition to college classes, cadets participate in daily Corps activities. These can range from intramural sport events, helping the local community, and unit physical fitness to school football games, trips to military bases, and marksmanship instruction at the rifle range. 
=== Corps Brass ===
Following the Corps reorganization and dropping of Army branch designations, cadets required a new symbol to be used. The solution to this was the Corps Brass, the class gift from the Class of 1960. Created by cadets from Company F-1, it is used as the symbol for earning full membership in the Corps. All cadets go through the process of earning it during their first year. It is a shield with knight&#x27;s helm on it with a sword and fasces crossed behind it and scrollwork over the top that says &quot;Per Unitatem Vis,&quot; translating to &quot;Through Unity, Strength.&quot; These elements represent how one of the first presidents of the university, Lawrence Sullivan Ross, was described: Soldier (sword), Statesman (fasces), and Knightly Gentleman (knight&#x27;s helm). To distinguish themselves, cadets in the band do not wear Corps Brass, instead wearing a small brass lyre device. In recent years, bandsmen often combine the lyre insignia with those of the U.S. Army infantry and field artillery branches (crossed rifles and crossed cannons, respectively) on some uniforms to reflect their affiliation with the Infantry or Artillery Bands (these designations having been reintroduced in 1976).

=== Corps Athletics ===
Corps athletic teams compete against university club teams across the nation in baseball, basketball, golf, lacrosse, marathon, soccer, tennis, and triathlon. Additionally, the Corps of Cadets Marksmanship Unit (CCMU) is the Corps competitive shooting team, partaking in competitions throughout the state of Texas and across the country. They compete in a wide variety of shooting fields, including the following: SASP, 3gun, Trap and Skeet, and USPSA. The selection process for new freshmen is very strenuous, with over 200 applicants and less than 15 are selected (some with no shooting experience). That being said, in the team&#x27;s 8 years of being active, they have accumulated over 8 national titles against colleges across the country, including West Point.

=== Unit awards ===
The following major awards are given annually in connection with the Corps Awards Program:

* Lieutenant General Ormond R. Simpson Award for Most Outstanding Color Guard
* United Services Automobile Association Award for Most Outstanding Major Unit Staff
* Commandant&#x27;s Award and Flag for University Activity
* Robert M. Gates Public Service Award
* J.J. Sanchez Award and Flag for Recruiting and Retention
* George P. F. Jouine Award and Flag for Scholastic Achievement
* Major General Bruno A. Hochmuth Award and Flag for Military Achievement
* Taylor A. Gillespie Award and Flag for Most Improved Unit
* President&#x27;s Award and Flag for the Most Outstanding Major Unit
* General George F. Moore Award, Plaque, and Flag for the Outstanding Unit

All awards are presented at the annually in the spring semester. Units awarded these honors are allowed to wear a citation cord and carry a flag to all events. At graduation, cadets may choose to wear any citation cord earned during their matriculation.

=== Senior boots ===

Within the Texas A&amp;M Corps of Cadets, seniors are given the privilege to wear distinctive brown leather boots, known as &quot;senior boots.&quot; These boots are one of the most visible and recognizable institutions of the Aggie Corps, and remain one of the lasting images of Texas A&amp;M University.

The tradition of senior boots came about in 1914, when the Corps of Cadets changed uniforms from the West Point style. The seniors wanted a way to differentiate themselves from the other classes, so they began wearing officer boots, which evolved into the senior boots worn today. By 1925, the boot style was integrated into the official cadet uniform, as a &quot;knee-height officer boot, of a light brown or tan.&quot; Lucchese&#x27;s bootery in San Antonio became the main supplier of boots.

By 1932, competition closer to campus sprang up. Joseph Holick, founder of the Fightin&#x27; Texas Aggie Band, opened Holick&#x27;s that year, and his competition soon included Victor&#x27;s, Russell&#x27;s, and others. The average price for a pair of boots in 1932 was $32.50. During World War II, due to the leather diversion to the war effort, Aggie seniors had to buy or inherit their boots from former cadets. By 1977, the price had risen to $200. Today, senior boots are normally ordered during freshman year and cost $700 to $1,900, but 85% of seniors in the Corps still purchase them. Seniors also have the option to apply to borrow a donated pair of boots through prior-worn boots donations from former cadets.

To assist in removing their boots, seniors are allowed to yell &quot;I need a fish!&quot; at which point all available freshmen in the senior&#x27;s outfit will race—and sometimes fight—to assist.

== Uniforms ==

A variety of uniforms are issued to a cadet, including summer and winter versions of daily uniforms, dress uniforms and field uniforms. The &quot;Uniform of the Day&quot; depends on the weather. For special occasions and events, the uniform is specified in the Field Order or invitation for the event. Special Corps units have special uniforms, such as the Ross Volunteers, the Fish Drill Team and Parsons Mounted Cavalry.

===Uniform components===
===Uniform combinations===
==Rank==

The rank structure of the Cadet Corps is generally based on the Army ROTC cadet rank structure. Today, the ranks are divided by class and, unlike at some other military schools, at Texas A&amp;M a cadet can never be demoted such that a person of a lower class outranks him/her, although this has not always been true. Up through the early 1950s many senior and junior cadets held private rank, although they were accorded privileges and respect commensurate with their class rather than by their rank. Unlike most of the personnel in the U.S. Armed Forces, the rank is always a piece of metal approximately 1 square inch in size affixed to the uniform much like a tie tack, but is never cloth rank sewn onto the fabric.

Freshmen are considered Cadet Privates and, as such, wear no rank, just a brass &quot;A.M.U.&quot; symbolizing their affiliation with Texas A&amp;M University. Sophomores hold the ranks of Cadet Private First Class, Cadet Corporal or Cadet Sergeant. Juniors are given cadet NCO rank (Sergeant through Sergeant Major of the Corps) and seniors are Cadet Officers (from Cadet 2nd Lieutenant through Cadet Colonel of the Corps).

The highest-ranking member of the Corps is the school&#x27;s official mascot, Reveille X. By decree from the US Army after World War II, Reveille holds the honorary rank of Cadet General. The female American collie is the &quot;First Lady&quot; of Texas A&amp;M and is present at all Texas A&amp;M football games and also attends other A&amp;M functions.

== Texas Aggie Corps of Cadets Association ==
The Corps of Cadets Association is designed to provide funds to maintain its programs. The Ross Volunteer Association, and the Fish Drill Team Association. The Corps Recruiting Program was established in 1988 by order of Major General Thomas Darling as the first organized and professional recruiting for the Corps. Four years later, funds were raised to create the Corps Leadership Outreach Program which would support for the program. On 21 April 1993, the CLO was converted to the Corps of Cadets Association (CCA), receiving its state charter from the State of Texas and being established as a non-profit organization in 1995.

== Texas Aggie Band Association (TABA) ==
The Texas Aggie Band Association was formed in the 1970s for the primary purpose of supporting the FTAB with private money. It is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, membership-based and led by volunteers. Intensely focused on supporting the Band, the TABA funds Texas A&amp;M Foundation scholarships for bandsmen, sponsors certain Band-unique events, and provides direct financial aid to the Office of the Director of Bands. 

In the past year the TABA has funded: $120,000 endowment for Bugles &amp; Banners, almost $40k in scholarships, tutoring, band sweaters, senior awards, &amp; dinner, fish practice t-shirts &amp; travel polos, BQ Ball, drum major&#x27;s brass plating, and more.

<text>The 70th Academy Awards ceremony, organized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), took place on March 23, 1998, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles beginning at 6:00 p.m. PST / 9:00 p.m. EST. During the show, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 24 categories honoring films released in 1997. The ceremony, which was televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Gil Cates and directed by Louis J. Horvitz. Actor Billy Crystal hosted the show for the sixth time. He had first hosted the 62nd ceremony held in 1990, and most recently the previous year&#x27;s awards. Nearly a month earlier in an event held at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California on February 28, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Ashley Judd.

&quot;Titanic&quot; won 11 awards, including Best Picture, a number that is tied with &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;. Other winners included &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot;, &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, and &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; with two awards, and &quot;Character&quot;, &quot;The Full Monty&quot;, &quot;Geri&#x27;s Game&quot;, &quot;The Long Way Home&quot;, &quot;Men in Black&quot;, &quot;A Story of Healing&quot;, and &quot;Visas and Virtue&quot; with one. The telecast garnered more than 57 million viewers in the United States, making it the most-watched Oscars broadcast in history.

==Winners and nominees==
The nominees for the 70th Academy Awards were announced on February 10, 1998, at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Robert Rehme, president of the academy, and actress Geena Davis. &quot;Titanic&quot; received the most nominations with a record-tying 14 (with 1950&#x27;s &quot;All About Eve&quot; and 2016&#x27;s &quot;La La Land&quot;); &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; and &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; came in second with nine apiece.

The winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 23, 1998. With eleven awards, &quot;Titanic&quot; tied with &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; for the most Academy Awards in Oscar history. It also became the first film to win Best Picture without a screenwriting nomination since 1965&#x27;s &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. Jack Nicholson became the fourth performer to win at least three acting Oscars. Both Nicholson and Helen Hunt won for their roles in &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot;, making it the seventh film to win both lead acting awards. Nominated for their performances as Rose DeWitt Bukater in &quot;Titanic&quot;, Best Actress nominee Kate Winslet and Best Supporting Actress nominee Gloria Stuart became the first pair of actresses nominated for portraying the same character in the same film. At age 87, Stuart also became the oldest performer nominated for a competitive Oscar.

==Ceremony information==
In December 1997, the academy hired veteran Oscar telecast producer Gil Cates to oversee the 1998 ceremony. &quot;Gil has become the consummate Oscar show producer, consistently garnering top television ratings for the telecast,&quot; said AMPAS President Robert Rehme in a press release announcing the selection. &quot;His shows are full of wit, charm and surprise.&quot; A few days later, actor and comedian Billy Crystal was chosen to emcee the upcoming telecast. Cates explained his reason to bring back the veteran comedian saying, &quot;Billy&#x27;s performance last year was spectacular. There is nobody like him.&quot; In an article published in &quot;USA Today&quot; he initially requested to Cates and AMPAS five months after the previous year&#x27;s ceremony that he would like to take a break from hosting duties. However, pressure from the academy, Cates, and several friends and family members made him reconsider his decision. His sixth stint would make him second only to Bob Hope in number of ceremonies hosted.

To commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the Academy Awards, 70 actors who have received both competitive and honorary awards appeared seated onstage together during a segment called Oscar&#x27;s Family Album. Each former winner was acknowledged by announcer Norman Rose with the films he or she won for. At the end of the segment newly minted winners Kim Bassinger, Helen Hunt, and Robin Williams joined them. This marked the largest gathering of former winners since the 50th ceremony held in 1978.

Several others participated in the production of the ceremony. Bill Conti served as musical director for the telecast. Dancer Daniel Ezralow choreographed a dance number showcasing the nominees for Best Original Comedy or Musical Score. Bart the Bear made a surprise appearance during the presentation of the Best Sound Effects Editing award with Mike Myers.

===Box office performance of nominees===
At the time of the nominations announcement on February 10, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees was $579 million with an average of $116 million per film. &quot;Titanic&quot; was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $338.7 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot; ($92.6 million), &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; ($68.9 million), &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; ($39.7 million), and finally &quot;The Full Monty&quot; ($38.7 million).

Of the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 40 nominations went to 15 films on the list. Only &quot;Titanic&quot; (1st), &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot; (16th), &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (20th), and &quot;In &amp; Out&quot; (24th) were nominated for directing, acting, screenwriting, or Best Picture. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were &quot;Men in Black&quot; (2nd), &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; (3rd), &quot;Air Force One&quot; (5th), &quot;My Best Friends Wedding&quot; (7th), &quot;Face/Off&quot; (9th), &quot;Con Air&quot; (12th), &quot;Contact&quot; (13th), &quot;Hercules&quot; (14th), &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (25th), &quot;Anastasia&quot; (30th), and &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; (34th).

===Critical response===
The show received a positive reception from most media publications. Television critic Howard Rosenberg of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; lauded Crystal&#x27;s performance writing that he &quot;would earn top billing as that unusual comedian as artful at doing musical comedy as jokes.&quot; &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; columnist John Carman raved,&quot;It was the best Oscar show in two decades.&quot; He also gave high marks for the host, commenting, &quot;But last night, Crystal was back in razor form.&quot; &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; television editor Kay McFadden praised Crystal commenting that &quot;he possesses nearly impeccable timing and judgment.&quot; In addition, she noted that while the ceremony dragged on, &quot;Last night was one of television&#x27;s smartest live ceremonies in recent memory.&quot;

Some media outlets were more critical of the show. Ray Richmond of &quot;Variety&quot; complained that the ceremony proved to be a &quot;Yawner of an Oscarcast.&quot; He added that Crystal&#x27;s &quot;off-the-cuff one-liners sank faster than the great ship herself.&quot; &quot;Boston Globe&quot; television critic Matthew Gilbert bemoaned,&quot;There was hardly a spontaneous moment during last night&#x27;s Oscarcast.&quot; Film critic Carrie Rickey from &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; lamented that the inevitable &quot;Titanic&quot; sweep &quot;sank a telecast loaded with montages of previous years&#x27; Oscar highlights.&quot;

===Ratings and reception===
The popularity of &quot;Titanic&quot; greatly increased television ratings for the ceremony. The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 57.25 million people over its length, which was a 29% increase from the previous year&#x27;s ceremony. An estimated 87.50 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards. The show also earned higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 35.32% of households watching over a 55.77 share. In addition, it garnered a higher 1849 demo rating with a 24.90 rating over a 44.30 share among viewers in that demographic. It overtook the network&#x27;s own telecast of the 1983 Academy Awards to become, as it remains to date, the highest viewership for both an Academy Award telecast (since figures were compiled beginning with the 46th ceremony in 1974) and any live awards show airing in U.S. television history.

In July 1998, the ceremony presentation received eight nominations at the 50th Primetime Emmys. Two months later, the ceremony won five of those nominations for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program (Billy Crystal), Outstanding Directing for a Variety or Music Program (Louis J Horvitz), Outstanding Lighting Direction (Electronic) for a Drama Series, Variety Series, Miniseries, or Movie (Bob Barnhart, Robert Dickinson, Matt Ford, Andy O&#x27;Reilly), Outstanding Music Direction (Bill Conti), and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Variety Series or Special (Patrick Baltzell, Robert Douglass, Edward J. Greene, Tommy Vicari).

<doc id="507431" wikidata="Q735670" url="?curid=507431" title="Production I.G">
<text>is a Japanese animation studio.

Headquartered in Musashino, Tokyo Production I.G was founded on December 15, 1987, by producer Mitsuhisa Ishikawa and character designer Takayuki Goto as I.G Tatsunoko, a branch studio of the animation giant Tatsunoko Production, changing its name to the current Production I.G in September 1993.
The letters I and G derive from the names of the company founders.
Since 2007, Production I.G is a subsidiary of the IG Port holding company, causing a restructuring which led to the second incarnation of the studio being formed.
Ishikawa was president and CEO of the studio until August 2022 when that position was given to George Wada with Ishikawa remaining as chairman of the company.

Production I.G went through a number of structural changes, not only stepping up from subcontractor to prime contractor to financier of animation production, but also changing the very scheme of the animation business in Japan.
The studio has implemented a series of measures that break with industry norms, such as investing in productions that are unprecedented for an animation studio, entering the copyright business, establishing a finance company, establishing overseas subsidiaries, and negotiating directly with major Hollywood movie studios.
The studio established a holding company, IG Port, which owns Production I.G itself as well as animation studios Wit Studio and Signal.MD. And the studio has continued to change and expand its business format, merging with publisher Mag Garden, establishing electronic content distribution company Lingua Franca, and forming a comprehensive business alliance with Netflix.
While other major studios are being acquired one after another by large companies and placed under their umbrella, The studio has remained independent (as of 2024).

Since its inception, Production I.G has produced many of Japan&#x27;s leading creators, including Mamoru Oshii and Kenji Kamiyama.
It has also produced a number of acclaimed feature films, television series, OVAs (Original Video Animations), ONAs (Original Net Animations), and video games.
Its representative works include the &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; series, the &quot;Psycho-Pass&quot; series, &quot;&quot; and its derivative works such as &quot;Blood+&quot;, the animation sequences of &quot;Kill Bill Vol. 1&quot;, &quot;Eden of the East&quot;, &quot;Guilty Crown&quot;, &quot;Kuroko&#x27;s Basketball&quot;, and &quot;Haikyu!!&quot;
It is also known in the video game industry for developing intros, cut-scenes and artwork for games such as Bandai Namco&#x27;s &quot;Tales&quot; series.
Furthermore, it has also spawned such influential animation studios as Wit Studio and Signal.MD, and its influence on the Japanese animation industry is immeasurable.

Production I.G&#x27;s works have received critical acclaim outside of Japan, with Mamoru Oshii&#x27;s &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; reaching #1 on the U.S. Billboard Top Video Sales Charts in 1996, and &quot;Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence&quot; was the first Japanese animation film to be nominated in Competition at the Cannes Film Festival.
Hiroyuki Okiura&#x27;s &quot;Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade&quot; and Hiroyuki Kitakubo&#x27;s &quot;Blood: The Last Vampire&quot; have also been highly acclaimed.
Those works have also influenced famous Hollywood creators. As a result, it was decided that The Matrix, directed by Lana and Lilly Wachowski, would be produced, and Production I.G produced the animation sequences for Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Kill Bill Vol. 1&quot;.
When pitching the idea for &quot;The Matrix&quot; to producer Joel Silver, The Wachowskis showed him &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; anime film and told him they wanted to make a similar movie.
Quentin Tarantino liked &quot;Blood: The Last Vampire&quot; so much that he himself visited the studio and asked Production I.G to participate in the production of the film.
However, Production I.G was very busy at the time and was in no condition to accept the request, so Ishikawa initially declined the request. Then Tarantino began sending drafts of screenplays to the studio one after another without asking. As Ishikawa read them, he gradually became interested in the film and eventually accepted the request.

==History==
On December 15, 1987, Mitsuhisa Ishikawa, a producer at Tatsunoko Production, established IG Tatsunoko Ltd., the predecessor of Production IG, with Takayuki Goto, who had organized Studio Chime.
It was in the form of an independent Tatsunoko production branch led by the staff who participated in the Tatsunoko-produced TV series &quot;Zillion&quot;.
Japan was experiencing a booming economy at that time thanks to the economic bubble, but it was a difficult time for the animation industry to create new anime. Original animation projects that may or may not be successful were particularly difficult to pass, and there were few opportunities for young talent to demonstrate their abilities. Ishikawa therefore planned &quot;Zillion&quot; to provide them with a place to play an active role.
Ishikawa, already a freelancer, was entrusted with the work as a Tatsunoko Production branch separated from the company.
Takashi Nakamura, Kōichi Mashimo, Takayuki Goto (later Production I.G board member), Hiroyuki Okiura and Kazuchika Kise (later Production I.G board member) who were at Anime R and Mu in Osaka at the time, as well as Mizuho Nishikubo and Mamoru Oshii helped in the production. Kyoto Animation also participated in the production.
After &quot;Zillion&quot;, he could have disbanded the team, but he sensed that everyone wanted to continue working together with this group, so he started I.G Tatsunoko.
The company was formed by merging the &quot;Zillion&quot; production team and Studio Chime, which was run by Takayuki Goto, who designed its characters, with the cooperation of Kyoto Animation.
Animator Kazuchika Kise also joined the studio early on.
Hideaki Hatta, President and CEO of Kyoto Animation, who encouraged Ishikawa to become president, supported him in establishing the company and even invested in it.
The company name &quot;I.G&quot; was named by Takayuki Goto, after the initials &quot;I&quot; of Ishikawa, the head of the production team, and &quot;G&quot; of Goto, the head of the animation studio. It was Ishikawa&#x27;s idea to put Tatsunoko in the company name because he thought it would make it easier to get work and out of consideration for Tatsunoko, which had trained him.
The company name was changed to Production I.G in 1993.

After becoming independent, I.G&#x27;s work was mainly subcontracted to other studios for a while.
Soon after becoming independent, I.G received an offer from Studio Deen to subcontract the production of Mamoru Oshii&#x27;s &quot;Patlabor&quot; OVA and the movie, and with these hits, I.G solidified its position in the industry.
However, Ishikawa began to feel dissatisfied with the fact that even though his company, a subcontractor, actually produced the works, it was only credited as a production partner in the end credits, while the name of the main contractor came to the forefront, and he also began to think that the studio would not be able to survive on low-budget subcontract work in the future.
Ishikawa therefore founded Ing Co., Ltd. in 1990, a planning and production company that handles copyright business.
In the anime industry, studios cannot make a profit if they only subcontract production. Ishikawa therefore established Ing with the idea of earning income not only from anime production but also from copyrights, and the studio invested in its works.
During his time at Tatsunoko Productions, Ishikawa had seen how the company generate revenue through the operation of the copyrights for original works, so he decided to follow suit.
However, he chose a name that was as unobtrusive as possible and not reminiscent of I.G, so as not to alarm the large companies that were already in the copyright business.
For &quot;Patlabor&quot;, Production I.G was a subcontractor for the first film in 1989, but was promoted to prime company for the second film in 1993, and even invested in the film.
After that, Ishikawa continued to use Ing as a company responsible for matters related to contracts and funding, and invested in I.G works under the Ing name.
&quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; was the only non-I.G studio&#x27;s work that Ing invested in, and Ishikawa said that investing in this blockbuster work turned out to be a very good result for the studio.

Production I.G produced the film &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, which was released in Japan in 1995. When this video was released in the U.S., it was ranked No. 1 in the U.S. Billboard magazine&#x27;s Sell Video category in 1996, and the studio became known as one of the top animation studios in the world, both in name and reality.
The film would go on to spawn a &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; franchise that includes sequel and reboot films, television series, original video animation, and original net animation. Ishikawa says this work was the biggest turning point for the studio.
In Japanese anime production, manufacturers which are involved in the manufacturing, sale and distribution of video software, television stations, publishers and advertising agencies form a production committee, and animation studios generally join after the committee is formed. Since this would not be profitable enough for the studio, Ishikawa decided that the studio needed to move from being the one who was given permission to produce works to being the one who had the right to grant permission. He approached Kodansha, the publisher of the original &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; manga, and obtained permission to produce three forms of production: an anime TV series, a movie, and a video game. Since Production I.G has a direct contract with Kodansha for the rights to produce anime adaptations from the original manga, it is able to take the initiative when forming the production committee, including the ability to issue usage licenses to each of the participating companies.
This allows Production I.G to develop a wide range of &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; anime franchises, including animation TV series, games, and movies.
Ishikawa&#x27;s decision was successful and brought in a fairly large amount of money for Production I.G, and the studio subsequently expanded its activities.
After that, Production I.G began to get involved in the copyright business and grew into a company that was not just a production company, but also an investor.
In the 2004 film &quot;Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence&quot;, Ishikawa took a major risk to change the scheme of the Japanese animation business.
He planned to make Production I.G, which had become a prime contractor and could invest somewhat, but was still just an animation production company, cut into a client position previously dominated by TV stations, publishing companies, and advertising agencies.
Traditionally, it has been common knowledge that once an animation studio produces and delivers a work and receives payment for it, its relationship with the work ends, and any further profits are monopolized by the publishing company, television station, or advertising agency that has invested in the work and holds the copyrights.
Anime studios need a lot of money to continue to produce high-quality works and to pay their animators, directors, and other staff appropriately, but it was impossible to do so under such conditions. Therefore, Ishikawa decided to become an investor.
Ishikawa decided to produce &quot;Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence&quot; on the studio&#x27;s own , rather than relying on the publisher or other companies in Japan. In order to obtain production financing from major Hollywood film companies, he and Director Oshii traveled to the U.S. with a screenplay and negotiated directly with them without going through a major Japanese advertising agency.
Ishikawa narrowed down the list of negotiating partners to DreamWorks, Warner Bros., and 20th century Fox, and finally signed a contract with DreamWorks, founded by Steven Spielberg, and succeeded in raising a huge amount of money and securing a promise of worldwide distribution.
On the other hand, advertising and publicity in Japan was entrusted to Toshio Suzuki, a producer at Studio Ghibli.
Suzuki&#x27;s power made possible a large-scale advertising campaign that I.G. would not have been able to carry out alone, but it also created some difficulties.
Ishikawa&#x27;s strategy was to first work with a major global distributor to make &quot;Ghost in the Shell 2&quot; a hit in the U.S., where the first &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; video sold well, and then import it back to Japan, but Suzuki rejected this.
He suggested that the film be a hit in Japan before the rest of the world and that the studio forget about the success of the previous film and make it not as a sequel but as a completely new film. As a result, the Japanese title was changed from &quot;Ghost in the Shell 2&quot; to &quot;Innocence&quot;.
Furthermore, most of the investors have changed from the original lineup.
This was an unthinkable situation, and the project could have been scrapped, but Ishikawa was able to renegotiate the contract with his remarkable negotiating skills.

In May 1995, Production I.G established a subsidiary studio, Xebec.
In 1997, Production I.G invested in Bee Train, a studio founded by Kōichi Mashimo, and also established Production I.G.,LLC, an overseas subsidiary based in Los Angeles.
The company co-developed and co-produced the television series IGPX, directed by Mitsuru Hongo, with Cartoon Network in 2005. This was the first collaboration between an American cable network and a Japanese anime studio.

Production I.G was recapitalized and became a joint-stock company from a limited company in April 1998, and merged with Ing in September 2000.

In 2000, Production I.G produced the movie &quot;Blood: The Last Vampire&quot;, the first full-digital animation in Japan.
This was the first time for Production I.G to acquire the original rights to a work.

In the 2000s, Production I.G began to produce more TV series, especially those based on popular manga series published in magazines such as Shōnen Jump.
This was the result of Ishikawa&#x27;s focus on creating a business scheme and leaving the animation production site to younger staff and producers, giving priority to their wishes.

In 2004, Bee Train acquired the shares held by Production I.G and ceased to be an equity method affiliate of Production I.G. Mitsuhisa Ishikawa also resigned from Bee Train&#x27;s board.

In 2005, Production I.G. Inc. went public on the JASDAQ stock exchange.
With the funds raised through the IPO, Production I.G founded a new studio capable of producing the latest 3DCG animation at the time, and co-founded FILM LIP, a studio capable of digital editing, with Fuji Television.

In 2007, Production I.G, Inc. changed its trade name to IG Port Inc. and at the same time established a new subsidiary under the name Production I.G. Inc.
The company name and its function as an anime studio were taken over by the subsidiary, and the listing was maintained under the name IG Port.
Mitsuhisa Ishikawa was also the representative director of Production I.G and IG Port.
In the same year, IG Port acquired Mag Garden, a publisher specializing in comics, which publishes the monthly Comic Blade, as a subsidiary. 
The norm in the animation industry is for anime studios to obtain permission from major publishers such as Shueisha, Kodansha, Shogakukan, and Kadokawa to adapt popular manga into anime, and then produce anime adaptations based on the original manga.
Because of this, none of the animation studios wanted to have a publishing division, but Mag Garden was the perfect publisher for Production I.G to add to its group because it was not large enough to make those major publishers wary or hostile.

In September 2010, Production I.G moved its headquarters to Musashino, Tokyo.

In 2010, IG Port acquired an 11.2% stake in Tatsunoko Production and Mitsuhisa Ishikawa became a non-executive director of the company.

On June 1, 2012, Wit Studio, I.G&#x27;s subsidiary animation studio, was founded, with the studio&#x27;s first project being &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;, which I.G assisted in producing.
IG Port invested 66.6%, while George Wada and Tetsuya Nakatake who were in the planning section of Production I.G invested 21.6% and 10.0%, respectively.

In 2017, IG Port created Lingua Franca, an electronic distribution service company, as a wholly owned subsidiary, with Kyohei Shinpuku as its president.

On June 5, 2017, Production I.G launched Tate Anime (vertical anime), an anime distribution app optimized for viewing on smartphones.
It was completely renewed in 2018 and replaced with a new app, Anime Beans, with expanded functions, including the ability to deliver Yoko anime (horizontal anime), and more content available for viewing.
The service was launched on December 18 worldwide except for China.
The app ended service on March 31, 2023.

In 2018, Production I.G and Wit Studio entered into a comprehensive business partnership with Netflix for anime productions.

On November 20, 2018, IG Port sold Xebec to Sunrise. Prior to that, Xebeczwei, a subsidiary of Xebec, was transferred to Production I.G on January 12, 2018, becoming a subsidiary and changing its name to IGzwei accordingly.

On August 30, 2022, George Wada, who founded Wit Studio, was promoted from Executive Vice President of Production I.G to CEO, while Ishikawa resigned as CEO to become Chairman.
Wada also continued to serve as president of Wit Studio.

<text>Iker Casillas Fernández (; born 20 May 1981) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper and currently works as a football commentator. Popularly dubbed &quot;San Iker&quot; (&quot;Saint Iker&quot;) for his ability to produce miraculous saves, Casillas is considered to be one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time. He is known for his athleticism, quick reactions and outstanding shot-stopping ability. Having spent the majority of his career at Real Madrid, Casillas is one of the few players to achieve over 1,000 professional career matches, and also holds the record for the most clean sheets for the Spain national team. Currently, he works for RTVE, Movistar Plus+ and Azteca Deportes.

At club level, Casillas started his career with the Real Madrid youth team, eventually gaining promotion to the main team in 1999, where he became the youngest goalkeeper to play in the final of the Champions League, and to win the title, at 19 years and four days. Casillas became the first choice goalkeeper at Real Madrid, winning two Champions Leagues and La Liga titles in his first three seasons, establishing himself as one of the best goalkeepers in the world. During his highly successful career in Madrid, Casillas won all major club titles, including five La Liga titles, four Supercopa de España titles, two Copa del Rey titles, three UEFA Champions Leagues, two UEFA Super Cups, two Intercontinental Cups and the FIFA Club World Cup. After 25 years with Real Madrid, Casillas joined FC Porto in 2015 on a free transfer, where he won the Primeira Liga and a Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira title. While at Porto, he broke the record for most consecutive seasons played in the UEFA Champions League (20) and amassed the most appearances in the competition (177). He ended his playing career in February 2020, after almost a year on the sidelines following a heart attack he suffered during a training session with Porto in May 2019.

With 167 international caps, Casillas has the second most appearances for the Spain national team, making him the eighteenth-most capped footballer of all time. An unused substitute at UEFA Euro 2000, Casillas became the nation&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper at the 2002 World Cup, and went on to play at UEFA Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup. In 2008, he was made captain, and went on to lead the team to the European Championship title that year. Casillas also led Spain to their first World Cup win in 2010, where he kept a joint–record five clean sheets, winning the Yashin Award for the best goalkeeper of the tournament. Spain became the first nation to retain the European Championship, winning the title again in 2012, where he set the record for most consecutive minutes without conceding a goal in the competition (509). In 2014, Casillas became one of six players to represent Spain at four World Cups.

In 2008, Casillas placed fourth overall in the Ballon d&#x27;Or, and has been selected for the UEFA Team of the Year six consecutive times from 2007 to 2012, a record for a goalkeeper. Casillas was also selected in the FIFPro World XI a record five times for a goalkeeper, and was named as the IFFHS World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper a record five times, alongside Gianluigi Buffon and Manuel Neuer. He was named as the second-best goalkeeper of the 21st century, behind Gigi Buffon, and the second-best goalkeeper of the past 25 years by the same organisation.

==Early life==
Casillas was born on 20 May 1981 in Móstoles, province of Madrid, to José Luis Casillas, a civil servant in the Ministry of Education, and María del Carmen Fernández González, a hairdresser. Both his parents had moved from their home of Navalacruz, Ávila.

Casillas has a brother, seven years younger, named Unai, who used to play as a central midfielder for CD Móstoles. The brothers&#x27; forenames are of Basque origin due to a family connection to the region: their paternal grandfather – an officer in the Civil Guard – was posted to Bilbao and settled in the city, their father grew up there as a result and Iker also lived in the area as a small child before the family relocated to Madrid.

On one occasion as a young child, when he was seven or eight, Casillas forgot to post his father&#x27;s football predictions for the weekend; his father had correctly predicted all 15 results, and the family lost out on an estimated €1.2 million (£1 million).

==Club career==
===Real Madrid===
====Early years====
Casillas began his career in Real Madrid&#x27;s youth system, known as La Fábrica, during the 1990–91 season. On 27 November 1997, at age 16 and still a junior, he was first called up to the senior team squad to face Rosenborg in the UEFA Champions League, although he remained on the bench throughout. After spending a season with the C-team in the fourth tier, during which they won their regional group, he came into contention as the club&#x27;s first-choice between the posts. In starting the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League group stage fixture against Olympiakos on 15 September 1999, he became the youngest goalkeeper ever to feature in the competition at the time, aged 18 years and 177 days; a record which was only broken in October 2017 by Mile Svilar. Three days earlier, Casillas had made his La Liga debut in a 2–2 draw against Athletic Bilbao at San Mamés Stadium. In May 2000, he became the youngest ever goalkeeper to play in and win a Champions League final when Real Madrid defeated Valencia 3–0, just four days after his 19th birthday.

====2001–2010====
Casillas lost his place in the side to backup César Sánchez after poor performances in the 2001–02 campaign, but redeemed himself when Sánchez suffered an injury in the final minutes of the 2002 Champions League Final. Casillas came on and pulled off several key saves to deny a rampant Bayer Leverkusen the Champions League crown. Real Madrid won 2–1.
The 2007–08 season was a fruitful season for Casillas, as he helped Real Madrid reclaim their 31st La Liga title and conceded only 32 goals in 36 matches to claim the Zamora Trophy. On 14 February 2008, he and club captain Raúl were awarded contracts for life; Casillas signed a contract extension that would keep him at the club until 2017, with an automatic extension if he played 30 competitive matches during the final season of the contract and a buy-out clause of £113 million. His performances earned him a spot in the UEFA Team of the Year for the second time.

In February 2009, Casillas equalled Paco Buyo&#x27;s record of 454 matches played for a goalkeeper and has since surpassed it to become Real Madrid&#x27;s most-capped goalkeeper of all time at only 27 years old. During the 2009 summer transfer window, some Spanish media reported that Manchester City had launched a record £129 million bid for the goalkeeper. The club denied the rumours, however, saying that no such offer had been made. Manchester United had been rumoured to have enquired about him, but no price was announced. He had been linked with other Premier League clubs before but Casillas himself stated that he &quot;had no intention of leaving&quot; his boyhood club.

During the 2009–10 season on 4 October in a game against Sevilla, Casillas made an extraordinary save, running from one side of his goal to the other to deny Diego Perotti in a one-on-one, close-range encounter. After the match, he received praise from fellow Spanish goalkeepers and England goalkeeper Gordon Banks, who stated, &quot;Casillas&#x27; reflexes are incredible. If he continues to play this well he will become one of the best goalkeepers in the history of the game.&quot; &quot;Europa Press&quot; reported that Casillas was the second-most popular Spanish sportsman on the Internet in 2010. The study performed by company Vipnet360 examined the web presence on platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

====2010–2015====

During the 2010–11 season, after the departure of first and second captains of Real Madrid, Raúl and Guti respectively, Casillas was selected as first captain with new vice-captains Sergio Ramos, Marcelo and Gonzalo Higuaín.

During the 2011–12 season, Casillas won the IFFHS Best Goalkeeper award, making him only the second goalkeeper behind Gianluigi Buffon to win it four times and the only goalkeeper to win the award four times in a row. Casillas played his 600th match for Real Madrid on 22 January 2012 in a 4–1 win against Athletic Bilbao. On 2 May 2012, Casillas clinched his fifth La Liga title and his first as a captain of Real Madrid, with a 3–0 win in Bilbao.
On 22 December 2012, Casillas was dropped by José Mourinho for a Liga match against Málaga in favour of Antonio Adán. This was the beginning of a series of sour disagreements between the Portuguese coach and the player, some of which, along with other internal affairs, were allegedly aired to the press by Casillas himself. This generated a shift in the opinion of certain sectors of Real Madrid&#x27;s fans, who gave Casillas the nickname &quot;&quot;topor&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;topo&quot;, and &quot;portero&quot;&quot;, Spanish for &quot;mole&quot; and &quot;goalkeeper&quot;, respectively). During the 2012–13 season, Casillas won the IFFHS Best Goalkeeper Award for the fifth consecutive time, making him the only goalkeeper in history to have ever won that award five times (in a row).

In January 2013, after a serious injury to Casillas, Mourinho signed Diego López from Sevilla. López was named first-choice goalkeeper ahead of Adán and kept his place in the team even after Casillas had returned from injury. After the 2012–13 season, Mourinho left Madrid and soon after his departure, Spanish midfielder Andrés Iniesta criticised him for benching Casillas.

In the middle of 2013, it was announced that Carlo Ancelotti would be Real Madrid&#x27;s head coach for the 2013–14 season. Real Madrid started the season with a 2–1 victory over Real Betis in which Casillas was benched once again. He made his first start in 238 days in the Champions League group stage match against Galatasaray, but was injured in the 14th minute after Sergio Ramos caught him with an accidental elbow as the goalkeeper came from his line to make a routine catch. Despite being the club&#x27;s second-choice keeper in La Liga, behind Diego López, Casillas continued to be Madrid&#x27;s first choice keeper in the Champions League and Copa del Rey, setting a new record of 962 minutes without conceding a goal in the latter competition. In February 2014, he became the first goalkeeper to play in every round of the Copa del Rey prior to the final without conceding a goal. On 16 April, he captained Madrid in the final as they beat rivals Barcelona 2–1 at Valencia&#x27;s Mestalla Stadium. On 24 May 2014, Casillas captained Real Madrid in the 2014 Champions League final, winning the title for the third time in his career with a 4–1 win over Atlético Madrid in Lisbon; this was the tenth time Real Madrid had won the trophy. Although Diego Godín&#x27;s opening goal resulted from an error by Casillas, Sergio Ramos tied the match for Real Madrid in injury time; the club went on to win the title in extra-time. In 2013–14 season Casillas kept 6 clean sheets, third most in a single season of Champions League.

Following the Champions League win, the 2014–15 season saw Casillas return to being the club&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper, despite competition from new arrival Keylor Navas, as he then went on to win the UEFA Super Cup, with Real Madrid defeating Sevilla 2–0 on 12 August 2014. He then also won the FIFA Club World Cup later that year, making his 700th appearance for Madrid on 20 December 2014, in the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final, as Real Madrid defeated San Lorenzo 2–0. In May 2015, Casillas played in the Champions League semi-finals against Juventus, in which his team lost 3–2 on aggregate.

===Porto===

====2015–2019====
After much speculation about his future, on 11 July 2015 Casillas signed with Portuguese Primeira Liga side Porto on a two-year deal with the option of a one-year extension. Real Madrid&#x27;s conduct in his exit was criticised, with Casillas&#x27; parents claiming that he was being forced out of the club by president Florentino Pérez, who received calls to quit from fans. Former international teammate Xavi, who earlier that summer left Barcelona after a similarly long and successful career, claimed that Real Madrid were ungrateful of Casillas&#x27; service to the club.

Casillas made his Primeira Liga debut on 15 August, keeping a clean sheet in a 3–0 win over Vitória de Guimarães at the Estádio do Dragão. On 29 September 2015, he overtook Xavi to become the player with the most appearances in the Champions League, making his record 152nd Champions League appearance in a 2–1 home win over Chelsea. That season, Casillas also broke Edwin van der Sar&#x27;s record for the most clean sheets in Champions League history, keeping his 51st clean sheet in the competition on 20 October 2015, in a 2–0 win over Maccabi Tel Aviv, as his team climbed top of Champions League Group G. In January 2016, he was blamed for the away loss at Vitória de Guimarães (1–0) in the league, following a high-profile error.

On 11 March 2017, Casillas set a new personal record for clean sheets in a single season with his sixteenth clean sheet in a 4–0 away win over Arouca. On 14 March, Casillas made his 175th appearance in UEFA club competitions in a 1–0 away defeat to Juventus in the second leg of the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League, overtaking Paolo Maldini as the player with the most appearances in European club matches.

On 13 September, Casillas equalled Ryan Giggs&#x27;s record of playing in 19 consecutive UEFA Champions League campaigns when he appeared in Porto&#x27;s 3–1 home defeat to Beşiktaş in the 2017–18 edition of the tournament. On 2 April 2018, Casillas played his 1,000th match as a professional in Porto&#x27;s 2–0 loss at Belenenses. In May, he won his first trophy with the club as they won the league title for the first time since 2013. The 2017–18 Primeira Liga title was confirmed after Sporting CP and Benfica tied their respective match. On 17 May 2018, he renewed his contract with Porto for another year.

On 4 August, Casillas started in Porto&#x27;s 3–1 victory over Desportivo das Aves in the 2018 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira. He surpassed Giggs&#x27; record during the 2018–19 season, appearing in his 20th consecutive UEFA Champions League campaign. On 11 December, Casillas, in a 3–2 away win over Galatasaray, became the first player to reach the knock-out stage 19 times, and become only the second player after Cristiano Ronaldo to win 100 Champions League matches. He made 31 league appearances throughout the season as Porto finished in second place, but his season was cut short after he suffered &quot;an acute myocardial infarction&quot; during training on 1 May 2019. He was discharged from hospital on 6 May, but commented that he was uncertain about his future.

====2019–2020====

In July 2019, following his heart attack two months earlier, Casillas returned for pre-season training. Later that month, Porto announced that he had been given a role with the club&#x27;s coaching staff as he continued his recovery. In August, he was named in Porto&#x27;s squad for the 2019–20 season. In September, he shared the results of his medical tests on social media; at the end of the month, he stated that he would wait until March of the following year to see how he is progressing with his recovery before deciding whether to return to playing or retire. In October, he posted a photo of himself working out in the club&#x27;s gym on Instagram. He resumed training on 4 November.

====Retirement====
On 4 August 2020, Casillas officially announced his retirement from professional football. In July, he was reported to have returned to Real Madrid to work as an advisor for Florentino Pérez. In December 2020, he was appointed as the deputy to the Real Madrid Foundation CEO.

==International career==
===Youth career===
Casillas debuted for Spain at the under-17 level. At age 16, he was the youngest player in the Spanish squad that placed third at the 1997 FIFA U-17 World Championship in Egypt. He was later made captain of the U17s. Two years later, he went on to win the FIFA World Youth Championship and the UEFA–CAF Meridian Cup that same year. Initially second-choice, he soon worked his way up to first-choice and eventually earned his first senior cap following some brilliant performances at club level.

===Senior debut, Euro 2000 and 2002 World Cup===
Casillas is currently the second most capped player in the history of the Spain national team. Following his full international debut at the senior level on 3 June 2000 against Sweden (at 19 years and 14 days), Casillas was an unused substitute at UEFA Euro 2000. He was part of the roster for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, initially as the understudy to Santiago Cañizares. Coincidentally, he became first-choice when Cañizares had to withdraw from the tournament due to injury from a freak accident. At 21, Casillas was one of the youngest first-choice goalkeepers in the tournament. He played an instrumental role in Spanish progression when he saved a penalty in regulation time and two more in the 3–2 shoot-out victory during the round of 16 match against the Republic of Ireland (1–1 after 120 minutes), earning him the nickname &quot;The Saint&quot;. One of his saves during the quarter-final against co-hosts South Korea during the 2002 World Cup was rated by FIFA as one of the top ten saves of all time; however, Spain were eliminated following a 5–3 penalty shoot-out defeat to the Koreans (0–0 after 120 minutes).

===Euro 2004 and 2006 World Cup===
Casillas played in all eight Group six fixtures during Euro 2004 qualifying, conceding just four goals. He kept a clean sheet in the second leg victory of the playoff against Norway which ended 3–0 in Oslo, and started all of Spain&#x27;s Euro 2004 matches. He was the first choice for the 2006 World Cup, captaining the team twice, but could not prevent &quot;La Roja&quot; from losing 3–1 to a Zinedine Zidane-inspired France in the Round of 16.

===Euro 2008===
With the exclusion of his Real Madrid teammate Raúl from the squad for Euro 2008, Casillas was given the captain&#x27;s armband. He started the first two Group D games against Russia and Sweden before being rested in place of second-choice goalkeeper Pepe Reina for Spain&#x27;s group stage elimination of Greece. Casillas saved two penalties from Antonio Di Natale and Daniele De Rossi as Spain eliminated Italy in the quarter-finals with a 4–2 shootout win following a goalless draw on 22 June. Spain later went on to win the competition with a 1–0 win over Germany in the final on 29 June. Casillas kept clean sheets in all of the quarter-final, semi-final and final matches, with Sweden&#x27;s first round goal by Zlatan Ibrahimović being the last one scored against him. On 29 June 2008, Casillas became the first goalkeeper-captain to lift the UEFA European Championship trophy when Spain beat Germany in the final.

In October 2008, Casillas and back-up Pepe Reina broke the national record for the longest time spent without conceding a goal. The pair went unbeaten for 710 minutes, longer than Spain&#x27;s longest-serving goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta and Paco Buyo. Wesley Sonck of Belgium ended their goalless streak when he scored against them a 2010 World Cup qualifying match.

Casillas was the highest-ranked goalkeeper (fourth place) in the 2008 Ballon d&#x27;Or, behind Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and national teammate Fernando Torres. Also in 2008, Casillas was named the world&#x27;s best goalkeeper by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics (IFFHS). He also came in third place in the best goalkeepers of all time ranking, beating Oliver Kahn.

===2009 Confederations Cup and 2010 World Cup===

Casillas was Spain&#x27;s starting goalkeeper during the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in South Africa, making four appearances as Spain finished the tournament in third place. On 5 September 2009, after a 5–0 win over Belgium in a qualifying match for the World Cup, Casillas equalled Andoni Zubizarreta&#x27;s national record of 56 clean sheets, and during the team&#x27;s next match, against Estonia on 9 September 2009, he surpassed Zubizarreta as the record holder for the most Spanish international clean sheets (this being achieved in Casillas&#x27; 98th appearance for the national team, while Zubizarreta made 126 before his retirement). Two months later, Casillas made his 100th appearance for Spain in its friendly win over Argentina, making him only the third player in history of Spanish football to ever reach this far internationally.

Although Casillas committed an error which led to a goal in Spain&#x27;s 1–0 defeat to Switzerland in their opening match of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, on 11 July 2010, Casillas captained Spain to their first ever World Cup title with a 1–0 win against the Netherlands in extra-time. In so doing, he became the third ever goalkeeper to captain a World Cup winning side (along with Gianpiero Combi in 1934 and Dino Zoff in 1982; the feat was later also achieved by Hugo Lloris in 2018). He was voted the tournament&#x27;s best goalkeeper, being named to the 2010 World Cup Dream Team, and was also awarded the Golden Glove. In the course of the finals in South Africa, he kept a joint–record five clean sheets – including in all four games in the knock-out stages –, only conceded a joint–record two goals, and saved a penalty in regulation time in the quarter-final victory against Paraguay. In the final, he made two crucial stops from Netherlands&#x27; Arjen Robben with the score at 0–0 after the Dutchman had passed all the defenders. Before he went to pick up the World Cup trophy, Casillas would later state that images of the past captains doing the same was in his head, reeling them off in perfect order going back to the first World Cup he saw as a youngster:

On 15 November 2011, Casillas became Spain&#x27;s most capped player, breaking Andoni Zubizarreta&#x27;s record after starting for Spain in their 2–2 draw against Costa Rica. On 29 February 2012, in Spain&#x27;s 5–0 win over Venezuela, Casillas equalled Edwin van der Sar&#x27;s record of 72 international clean sheets. On 30 May, in Spain&#x27;s 4–1 win over South Korea, Casillas came on for Pepe Reina on the 82nd minute mark. This set the record for most international victories with 95 giving Casillas yet another record to his name. On 6 June, In Spain&#x27;s 1–0 win over China PR, Casillas set the record for most international clean sheets with 74.

===Euro 2012===

Prior to Euro 2012, there had been growing tensions in the dressing room among Spain&#x27;s players who played for rival clubs Barcelona and Real Madrid; this led manager Vicente del Bosque to declare that any player who carried this hostility with them at international level would be dropped from the team. As such, Casillas, Carles Puyol, and Xavi called a summit with the manager and the team&#x27;s players, in order to ease tensions; Casillas was praised in the media for his role in successfully uniting the dressing room. On 1 July 2012, Casillas became the first player to reach 100 international wins for his country as Spain defeated Italy 4–0 in the Euro 2012 final, as Spain successfully defended their title to win their third consecutive major international trophy. He also set another record with his 509 minutes without conceding a goal in that year&#x27;s European Championship, keeping five consecutive clean sheets and breaking the longstanding tally of 494 minutes set by Italian goalkeeper Dino Zoff. The only goal he conceded, scored by Antonio Di Natale, came in Spain&#x27;s opening match of the tournament, a 1–1 draw against eventual runners-up Italy. Casillas then continued his new record unbeaten streak with Spain to 817 minutes, until it was finally broken by Olivier Giroud&#x27;s injury-time goal on 16 October of that year, which came in a 1–1 home draw against France in a 2014 World Cup qualifying match.

===2013 Confederations Cup and 2014 World Cup===
In June 2013, Casillas represented Spain at the 2013 Confederations Cup in Brazil, making three appearances as Spain reached the final, only to be defeated 3–0 by the hosts Brazil on 30 June, at the Maracanã Stadium.

In June 2014, Casillas was selected to represent Spain in his fourth World Cup. In the team&#x27;s opening match, he made two mistakes leading to goals from Stefan de Vrij and Robin van Persie as the champions were defeated 5–1 by the Netherlands. After the match, Casillas apologised for the defeat and called his performance the worst of his career. He also started in Spain&#x27;s second group game against Chile, which they lost 2–0 and were subsequently eliminated from the World Cup. He received criticism for his role in Chile&#x27;s second goal, where he punched Alexis Sánchez&#x27;s free kick into the path of the goalscorer Charles Aránguiz. On 23 June, Casillas was left on the bench for Spain&#x27;s final game against Australia, with Pepe Reina playing instead.

===Euro 2016===
On 5 September 2015, Casillas kept a clean sheet in his 100th game as Spain&#x27;s captain, a 2–0 Euro 2016 qualifying win over Slovakia at the Estadio Carlos Tartiere in Oviedo. On 13 November, Casillas kept his 100th international clean sheet with Spain in a 2–0 friendly win over England, in Alicante, becoming the first goalkeeper ever – male or female – to reach this landmark. He equalled the Latvian Vitālijs Astafjevs&#x27; European record of 166 caps on 27 March 2016 by playing in a friendly against Romania.

On 31 May, Casillas was named to Vicente del Bosque&#x27;s final 23-man Spain squad for Euro 2016. The following day, he became the most-capped European player by earning his 167th cap in a 6–1 friendly win over South Korea in Salzburg in a pre-tournament warm-up match; he was later replaced by debutant Sergio Rico in the second half. This was his final international appearance. During the tournament, he was the second-choice goalkeeper behind David de Gea; Casillas did not make an appearance during the tournament as Spain was eliminated in the Round of 16 following a 2–0 defeat to Italy.

===2018 World Cup===
On 21 May 2018, Casillas was left out of Julen Lopetegui&#x27;s final 23-man Spain squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. In November, he hinted a return to the Spain football team and Real Madrid.

==Style of play and recognition==

Widely considered by pundits, as well as both former and current goalkeeping colleagues, as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, Casillas was given the nickname &quot;San Iker&quot; (&quot;Saint Iker&quot;) throughout his career, for his precocious performances as a youngster, and due to his ability to produce acrobatic and decisive saves. In his prime, he was a spectacular, well-rounded, and athletic keeper, who was known in particular for his outstanding agility, reflexes, consistency and shot-stopping, as well as his foot-work, positioning between the posts, concentration, and speed when rushing off his line in one on one situations; he has also stood out for his penalty-saving abilities. In spite of his reserved character, he has been highly regarded for his strong personality, calm composure under pressure, ability to organise his defence, and leadership from the back throughout his career, as well as his reading of the game. Gianluigi Buffon described Casillas as the best goalkeeper of his era with his hands. He was also known for his ability to save the ball with his feet, with former goalkeeper Manuel Almunia likening him to compatriot Luis Arconada, who also served as an inspiration to Casillas, and to whom he was often compared throughout his career, due to his quick reactions, movement, and excellent footwork. Regarding Casillas&#x27;s playing style and goalkeeping ability, Almunia commented in 2017: &quot;Iker&#x27;s a strong goalkeeper, leaps well, good diving in either direction... between the posts he moves like a cat.&quot; In 2016, Casillas was named the fourth greatest goalkeeper in history by France Football.

A precocious talent in his youth, Casillas has drawn praise for his longevity and consistency at the top level, as well as his discipline in training; despite his reputation and goalkeeping ability, however, due to his lack of notable height and strong physical attributes, he has been criticised at times by pundits for struggling to command his area, in particular against aerial threats, and for his unsteady handling and indecisiveness when coming out to claim crosses, as he often preferred to punch the ball away. He also received criticism in the media for a series of errors and less consistent performances in his later career, as he lost some of his speed and mobility with age due to his physical decline. Although he has occasionally been criticised by pundits for his limited skills with the ball at his feet in comparison to other Spanish goalkeepers, Casillas&#x27;s distribution with both his hands and feet has generally been reliable throughout his career, and he is capable of sending the ball into deep areas of the pitch with his long throws and kicks with his left foot.

==Sponsorship==
In January 2012, Casillas agreed a sponsorship deal with Adidas to wear their Response goalkeeping gloves and Predator football boots. The move to Adidas ended a long running association for Casillas with Reebok, which started in 2004. In February 2005, Casillas was the football face of Reebok&#x27;s &quot;I Am What I Am&quot; global integrated advertising campaign that linked all the brand&#x27;s marketing efforts under one umbrella. Adidas has been the parent company of Reebok since 2005.

===Personal life===

Between 2004 and 2008, Casillas dated beauty pageant winner Eva González.

Casillas was in a relationship with sports journalist Sara Carbonero from 2009 to 2021. Their son Martín was born on 3 January 2014 in Madrid. In November 2015, the couple announced they were expecting their second child. On 20 March 2016, the couple married. On 2 June 2016, Sara gave birth to the couple&#x27;s second child, Lucas.

On 1 May 2019, during Porto&#x27;s morning training session, Casillas was rushed to hospital after suffering a heart attack at the club&#x27;s training ground, where his situation was stabilized. Later that evening, Casillas, whose situation had improved, published a statement on Twitter with a picture of himself giving the thumbs up signal in which he thanked the people for the moral support they gave him. Later that month, it was announced that his wife was suffering from cancer. On 12 March 2021, Casillas and Carbonero announced their decision to separate.

In 2013, a street in the Móstoles municipality of Madrid was renamed &quot;Avenida de Iker Casillas&quot; in his honour.

On 17 February 2020, Casillas confirmed his intention to stand as a candidate in the RFEF presidential elections.

===Charity===
In 2011, Casillas was appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme&#x27;s Millennium Development Goals.

He has his own charitable foundation, the &quot;Fundación Iker Casillas&quot;.

In 2018, he attended the international social Football for Friendship forum in Moscow.

<text>Gerasim Grigoryevich Izmaylov (; &quot;circa&quot; 1745 – &quot;after&quot; 1795) was a Russian navigator involved in the Russian colonization of the Americas and in the establishment of the colonies of Russian America in Alaska. He was responsible for the first detailed maps of the Aleutian Islands.

A native of Yakutsk, Izmaylov attended a navigation school in Okhotsk with Dmitry Bocharov, who became his lifelong business companion. In 1771, both were caught up in the Benyovszky mutiny at Bolsheretsk on Kamchatka. Izmaylov attempted to break away from the mutineers but, after being flogged, was marooned on the isle of Simushir, one of the uninhabited Kuril Islands. For a year he subsisted on &quot;scallops, grass, and roots&quot; before being rescued by yasak gatherers. He was investigated in Irkutsk on account of his association with Benyovszky, but was eventually cleared of all charges in 1774.

In 1775, Izmaylov assumed command of the boat St. Paul and set to work mapping the shores of the Aleutian Islands. In October 1778, while visiting Unalaska, he made the acquaintance of Captain James Cook who presented him with an octant in exchange for a letter of introduction to the Kamchatka authorities. Cook also handed over to Izmaylov a recently drawn map of the western coast of North America, which was to be delivered by the Russians to the British Admiralty.

In 1783–1785, Izmaylov and Grigory Shelikhov made their historic voyage from Okhotsk to Kodiak Island, where they founded the first Russian settlement in America. In 1789, Izmaylov became the first to explore and map the Kenai Peninsula. Three years later, he took up employment under Alexander Baranov, helping him withstand a sea attack by the Tlingit.

Having wintered in Unalaska, Izmaylov visited Saint Paul Island, where he discovered the crew of a Russian ship that had been missing since 1791. He brought them back to Okhotsk in June 1794. He is mentioned for the last time in 1795, when he accompanied to Alaska a group of Orthodox missionaries under Father Joasaph.

<text>Lama, Lamma, or Lamassu (Cuneiform: , ; Sumerian: lammař; later in Akkadian: &quot;lamassu&quot;; sometimes called a lamassus) is an Assyrian protective deity. 
Initially depicted as a goddess in Sumerian times, when it was called &quot;Lamma&quot;, it was later depicted from Assyrian times as a hybrid of a human, bird, and either a bull or lion—specifically having a human head, the body of a bull or a lion, and bird wings, under the name &quot;Lamassu&quot;. In some writings, it is portrayed to represent a goddess. A less frequently used name is shedu (Cuneiform: , ; Sumerian: alad; Akkadian, &quot;šēdu&quot;), which refers to the male counterpart of a &quot;lamassu&quot;. &quot;Lamassu&quot; represent the zodiacs, parent-stars or constellations.

==Goddess Lama==

The goddess Lama appears initially as a mediating goddess who precedes the orans and presents them to the deities. The protective deity is clearly labelled as Lam(m)a in a Kassite stele unearthed at Uruk, in the temple of Ishtar, goddess to which she had been dedicated by king Nazi-Maruttash (1307–1282 BC). It is a goddess wearing a ruffled dress and wearing a horned tiara symbolizing the deity, with two hands raised, in sign of prayer. Agnès Spycket proposed that similar female figures appearing in particular in glyptics and statuary from the Akkadian period, and in particular in the presentation scenes (common especially in the Paleo-Babylonian era) were to be considered as Lam(m)a. This opinion is commonly followed and in artistic terminology these female figures are generally referred to as Lam(m)a. From Assyrian times, Lamma becomes a hybrid deity, half-animal, half-human.

==Iconography==

From Assyrian times, &quot;lamassu&quot; were depicted as hybrids, with bodies of either winged bulls or lions and heads of human males. The motif of a winged animal with a human head is common to the Near East, first recorded in Ebla around 3000 BC. The first distinct &quot;lamassu&quot; motif appeared in Assyria during the reign of Tiglath-Pileser II as a symbol of power.

Assyrian sculpture typically placed prominent pairs of &quot;lamassu&quot; at entrances in palaces, facing the street and also internal courtyards. They were represented as &quot;double-aspect&quot; figures on corners, in high relief. From the front they appear to stand, and from the side, walk, and in earlier versions have five legs, as is apparent when viewed obliquely. Lumasi do not generally appear as large figures in the low-relief schemes running round palace rooms, where winged genie figures are common, but they sometimes appear within narrative reliefs, apparently protecting the Assyrians.

The colossal entrance figures were often followed by a hero grasping a wriggling lion, also colossal in scale and in high relief. In the palace of Sargon II at Dur-Sharrukin, a group of at least seven &quot;lamassu&quot; and two such heroes with lions surrounded the entrance to the &quot;throne room&quot;, &quot;a concentration of figures which produced an overwhelming impression of power.&quot; They also appear on cylinder seals. Notable examples include those at the Gate of All Nations at Persepolis in Iran, the British Museum in London, the Louvre in Paris, the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the University of Chicago Oriental Institute. Several examples left &quot;in situ&quot; in northern Iraq were destroyed in the 2010s by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant when they occupied the area, as were those in the Mosul Museum.

==Terminology==
&quot;Lamassu&quot; represent the zodiacs, parent-stars, or constellations. They are depicted as protective deities because they encompass all life within them. In the Sumerian &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, they are depicted as physical deities as well, which is where the lamassu iconography originates, physical representations or embodiments of divine higher principles associated with specific celestial origins. Although &quot;lamassu&quot; had a different iconography and portrayal in the culture of Sumer, the terms &quot;&quot;lamassu&quot;, &quot;alad&quot;, and &quot;shedu&quot; evolved throughout the Assyro-Akkadian culture from the Sumerian culture to denote the Assyrian-winged-man-bull symbol and statues during the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Eventually, female &quot;lamassu&quot; were identified as &quot;apsasû&quot;&quot;. 
The motif of the Assyrian-winged-man-bull called &quot;Aladlammu&quot; and &quot;Lamassu&quot; interchangeably is not the &quot;lamassu&quot; or alad of Sumerian origin, which were depicted with different iconography. These monumental statues were called aladlammû or &quot;lamassu&quot; which meant &quot;protective spirit&quot;. In Hittite, the Sumerian form is used both as a name for the so-called &quot;tutelary deity&quot;, identified in certain later texts with the goddess Inara, and a title given to similar protective deities.

==Mythology==

The &quot;lamassu&quot; is a celestial being from ancient Mesopotamian religion bearing a human head, symbolising intelligence; a bull&#x27;s body, symbolizing strength; and an eagle&#x27;s wings, symbolizing freedom. Sometimes it had the horns and the ears of a bull. It appears frequently in Mesopotamian art. The &quot;lamassu&quot; and shedu were household protective spirits of the common Assyrian people, becoming associated later as royal protectors, and were placed as sentinels at entrances. The Akkadians associated the god Papsukkal with a &quot;lamassu&quot; and the god Išum with &quot;shedu&quot;.

To protect houses, the &quot;lamassu&quot; were engraved in clay tablets, which were then buried under the door&#x27;s threshold. They were often placed as a pair at the entrance of palaces. At the entrance of cities, they were sculpted in colossal size, and placed as a pair, one at each side of the door of the city, that generally had doors in the surrounding wall, each one looking toward one of the cardinal points.

==In modern culture==

The British 10th Army, which operated in Iraq and Iran in 1942–1943, adopted the &quot;lamassu&quot; as its insignia. A bearded man with a winged bull body appears on the logo of the United States Forces – Iraq.

A man with a bull&#x27;s body is found among the creatures that make up Aslan&#x27;s army in &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot; by C. S. Lewis. He appears at the Stone Table, challenging the White Witch &quot;with a great bellowing voice&quot;. In the film &quot;Alexander&quot; (2004), &quot;lamassu&quot; are seen at the Ishtar Gate in Babylon. In the Disney film &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992), a gold &quot;lamassu&quot; can be found in the scene where Aladdin and Abu enter the cave in the desert to find the lamp.

Michael Rakowitz, a Northwestern University professor of Art Theory &amp; Practice, won a Fourth Plinth commission to recreate the &quot;Lamassu&quot; that stood in Nineveh, Iraq, from 700 BC until it was destroyed by ISIS in 2015. Rakowitz&#x27;s sculpture was displayed in London&#x27;s Trafalgar Square from 2018 to 2020.

===Games===
Lammasu [&quot;sic&quot;] and shedu are two distinct types of good-aligned creatures in the role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, with lammasu having the bodies of winged lions and shedu depicted as human-headed winged bulls.

Lammasu appear in the &quot;&quot; trading card game as the Hunted Lammasu in the &quot;Ravnica&quot; expansion, as well as the Venerable Lammasu found in the Khans of Tarkir expansion.

In the Games Workshop miniatures wargame, &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battle&quot;, the Lamasu was a mount for the Chaos Dwarf army. It has since returned as part of the &quot;Storm of Magic&quot; expansion release.

In the video game &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic VI&quot;, the lamasu [&quot;sic&quot;] is a recruitable elite creature of the necropolis faction (undead).

A Lamassu appears in &quot;Prince of Persia 3D&quot; at the end of the Floating Ruins level, where the prince rides on it to the Cliffs. It is also appears in the ending of the game, where the Prince and Princess ride it to an unknown destination.

<text>Henry Menasco Wade (November 11, 1914 – March 1, 2001) was an American lawyer who served as district attorney of Dallas County from 1951 to 1987. He participated in two notable U.S. court cases of the 20th century: the prosecution of Jack Ruby for killing Lee Harvey Oswald, and the U.S. Supreme Court case that held abortion was a constitutional right, &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. In addition, Wade was district attorney when Randall Dale Adams, the subject of the 1988 documentary film &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot;, was wrongfully convicted in the murder of Robert Wood, a Dallas police officer. After his term and death, he was criticised for his corruption, ranging from wrongful convictions, to altitudes and certain comments on race, in addition to some decisions such as execution of innocent men. 

==Early life==
Wade, one of 11 children, was born in Rockwall County, Texas, outside Dallas. Wade, along with five of his seven brothers, entered the legal profession. Shortly after graduating from the University of Texas at Austin, in 1939, Wade joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation, headed by J. Edgar Hoover. Wade&#x27;s assignment as special agent was to investigate espionage cases along the US East Coast and in South America. Wade served in the US Navy during World War II, participating in the invasions of the Philippines and Okinawa.

==Career==
He was first elected Rockwall County Attorney. In 1947, Wade joined the Dallas County District Attorney&#x27;s Office. He won election to the top job four years later, a position he held for 36 years, until his retirement in 1987.

===John F. Kennedy assassination ===
On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in downtown Dallas, just blocks from Wade&#x27;s office in the Dallas County Courthouse.

Wade lost the opportunity to try Lee Harvey Oswald for the killing of Kennedy and the murder of Officer J.D. Tippit when Dallas nightclub operator Jack Ruby murdered Oswald two days later; Wade became known nationally for prosecuting Ruby for Oswald&#x27;s murder. Wade closely supervised the Ruby trial, but he appointed his assistant, William Alexander, to conduct the courtroom proceedings.

Wade and Alexander confronted Ruby&#x27;s lawyers, famed trial lawyer Melvin Belli and Texas counsellor Joe Tonahill, in a lengthy trial that concluded on March 14, 1964, with a verdict for Ruby of &quot;guilty of murder with malice.&quot; The jury had deliberated for less than three hours before arriving at its decision, and it recommended a death penalty.

===&quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;===

Wade, as Dallas County district attorney, was the named defendant when attorneys Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee mounted a 1970 constitutional challenge to the Texas criminal statutes prohibiting doctors from performing abortions. Norma McCorvey (&quot;Jane Roe&quot;), a single woman, was signed up as the representative plaintiff. The challenge sought both a declaratory judgment that the Texas criminal abortion statutes were unconstitutional on their face, and an injunction restraining the defendant from enforcing the statutes. The lower court refused to grant Roe&#x27;s desired injunction, but declared the criminal abortion statutes were void.

Both sides cross-appealed. The case worked its way through the appellate process, culminating in the Supreme Court&#x27;s landmark 1973 &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision that made all first trimester abortions legal throughout the United States.

==Later life==
Despite the loss of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and its unpopularity with conservative voters, Wade himself was not blamed, and his political career did not suffer. He continued to serve in office for an additional 14 years, and he remained a fixture around the new Crowley Courts Building, where members of the Dallas Bar called him &quot;the Chief&quot;. In 1995, the Henry Wade Juvenile Justice Center was named in his honor, and in 2000, shortly before his death from Parkinson&#x27;s disease, &quot;Texas Lawyer&quot; magazine named him as one of the 102 most influential lawyers of the 20th century.

==Legacy==
Wade once again gained national attention in 1988 with the release of Errol Morris&#x27;s documentary film &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot;. The documentary tells the story of Randall Dale Adams&#x27; 1977 conviction for the murder of Robert Wood, a Dallas police officer. Adams was sentenced to death for the crime. The execution was scheduled for May 8, 1979, but US Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., ordered a stay only three days before the scheduled date. Instead of conducting a new trial, Governor Bill Clements commuted Adams&#x27;s sentence to life in prison. Adams was exonerated in 1988, after serving 12 years in prison. Similar cases of exonerated men have recently arisen, putting the legality of Wade&#x27;s practices in question.

In a January 1964 Dallas Times Herald, Wade&#x27;s wife was quoted: &quot;I’d be afraid to drink a glass of light wine and then drive to the drugstore...If the police stopped me, I know what Henry would do.&quot; Several articles later noted that a 1963 internal memo in Wade&#x27;s office advised against &quot;Jews, Negroes, Dagos, Mexicans or a member of any minority race&quot; from serving on a jury. In 1969, Jon Sparling, one of Wade&#x27;s top assistants, wrote a training manual warning against picking, among others, &quot;free-thinkers&quot; and &quot;extremely overweight people,&quot; and said, &quot;You are not looking for a fair juror but rather a strong, biased and sometimes hypocritical individual who believes that defendants are different from them.&quot;

As of July 2008, 15 persons convicted during Wade&#x27;s term as Dallas County district attorney have been exonerated of the crimes of which they were convicted in light of new DNA evidence. Because of the culture of the department to &quot;convict at all costs,&quot; more innocent people are suspected to have been falsely imprisoned. Project Innocence Texas has more than 250 cases under examination.

Craig Watkins, the first black American DA for Dallas Country, described Wade&#x27;s tenure as having &quot;a cowboy kind of mentality and the reality is that kind of approach is archaic, racist, elitist and arrogant.&quot; In Wade’s final year in office, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the death sentence of a black man, Thomas Miller-El, ruling that blacks were excluded from the jury. Cited in Miller-El’s appeal was a manual for prosecutors that Wade wrote in 1969 and was used for more than a decade. It gave instructions on how to keep minorities off juries. Before Wade&#x27;s death, DNA evidence was used for the first time to reverse a Dallas County conviction; David Shawn Pope, found guilty of rape in 1986, who had spent 15 years in prison. Watkins said in a 2010 interview in The Guardian that officers from his own jurisdiction &quot;were taken aback because we were calling in to question the work they had done for all these years. It was the same among some folks in this office. They were afraid of the consequences of this Pandora&#x27;s box being opened.&quot; Lenell Geter, a black engineer, was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to life in prison. After Geter had spent more than a year behind bars, Wade agreed to a new trial, then dropped the charges in 1983 amid reports of shoddy evidence and allegations Geter was singled out because of his race. According to a 2016, article, Wade was responsible for the conviction and execution of a black man called Tommy Lee Walker. Former Dallas assistant district attorney Edward Gray wrote the 2010 book &quot;Henry Wade&#x27;s Tough Justice&quot; which discussed the miscarriages of justice during Wade&#x27;s tenure, noting that Wade&#x27;s office conviction rate of innocent defendants was ten times the national average. Gray stated that &quot;Henry Wade wouldn&#x27;t intentionally try to convict someone he knew to be innocent...but even in cases where evidence was weak, he would go all out, go for broke, be super-competitive.&quot;

<text>Alain Émile Louis Marie Poher (; 17 April 1909 – 9 December 1996) was a French politician who served as President of the Senate from 1968 to 1992. Under this capacity, he was twice briefly acting President of France, in 1969 and 1974 following the resignation of Charles de Gaulle and the death of Georges Pompidou respectively. Poher was affiliated with the Popular Republican Movement (MRP) until 1966 and later with the Democratic Centre (CD) and Centre of Social Democrats (CSD), which he joined in 1976.

A native of Ablon-sur-Seine south of Paris, Poher was a longtime member of the Senate (1946–1948; 1952–1995), where he sat first for Seine-et-Oise until 1968 and then Val-de-Marne. He also served as President of the European Parliament from 1966 to 1969. As the longest-serving President of the Senate and the sole unelected President of France under the Fifth Republic, Poher remained an influential figure in 20th-century French politics. He ran in the 1969 presidential election but was defeated by Pompidou in the second round.

Poher died at the age of 87 in December 1996, a year after his retirement from the Senate.

==Early career==
Poher was born in Ablon-sur-Seine, current-day Val-de-Marne, to a family from Brittany.

He graduated from the Lycée Louis-le-Grand and the Lycée Saint-Louis in Paris and later studied law. On 19 August 1938 he married Henriette Tugler (1907–2004) in La Baule-Escoublac, with whom he had two daughters, Marie-Agnès (born 1940) and Marie-Thérèse (1944–2002).

His administrative career began in 1938 when he became a junior executive officer at the Ministry of Finance. In World War II, he was wounded in combat after being sent to the front lines to defend against the German invasion. Later, he became a member of the French Resistance against Nazi Germany.

In the aftermath of the Liberation of France, he served in several political positions prior to entering the Senate: chairman at the Ministry of Finance&#x27;s Liberation Committee (from 20 July 1944); head of Social Services, Ministry of Finance (from 1 January 1945); and Mayor of Ablon-sur-Seine (from 18 May 1945).
He was also General Commissioner for German and Austrian Affairs (1948–1950); Secretary of State for the Budget in the second government of Prime Minister Robert Schuman and first government of Prime Minister Henri Queuille (1948); Secretary of State for the Armed Forces (Navy) in the government of Prime Minister Félix Gaillard (1957–1958); and president of the &quot;Association des maires de France&quot; or AMF (1974–1983).

A longtime ally and political protégé of Schuman, Poher was reelected to the Senate in 1952, where he remained for over 40 years, until 1995. As a Senator, he continued to serve in government (as Secretary of State for the Armed Forces, tasked with the Navy, in the government of Prime Minister Félix Gaillard in the late 1950s), in addition to his duties as mayor of his home town, Ablon-sur-Seine. Like Schuman, he was known for strongly pro-European integration positions; he served as President of the European Parliament from 1966 to 1969.

==President of the Senate==

During his tenure, Poher served with the Gaullist government of Prime Minister Maurice Couve de Murville, Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s close ally. Some even referred to this period as the first cohabitation. Despite sharp political differences, Poher was widely credited for model cooperation with the government.

===Acting President of France===
According to the order of succession established by the Constitution of the Fifth Republic, the President of the Senate assumes the nation&#x27;s presidential powers and duties following the president&#x27;s death or resignation; the officeholder thus becomes &quot;ad interim&quot; head of state until the next early presidential election.

Poher&#x27;s first service as interim president came on 29 April 1969, when Charles de Gaulle resigned. Previously he was one of Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s most notable political opponents and played a key role in the successful &quot;no&quot; campaign in the final referendum of his presidency.

During his interim presidency, Poher continued to serve as Senate President. However, he resided during this time in the Élysée Palace as acting president.

Initially, Poher tried to recruit General Marie-Pierre Kœnig as a candidate for the presidency and offered him his full support. Kœnig, however, declined to run, citing his poor health and stating that one general should not replace another general as the head of state. After Kœnig&#x27;s refusal, Poher himself announced his candidacy.

Due to favourable polls, he was viewed as the strongest opponent of Georges Pompidou and the only non-Gaullist candidate who had a real opportunity to win the election. The lack of a longstanding party machine nevertheless hurt his chances.

During his short term in office Poher&#x27;s main task was overseeing the incoming election, in which he himself participated. However, during his tenure he took some major initiatives; notably, he fired longtime Charles de Gaulle confidant Jacques Foccart, a Secretary-General for African Affairs as well as, unofficially, the chief of the Gaullist secret services, who returned to the Élysée after Pompidou&#x27;s election.

Poher also ordered the directors of France&#x27;s state-controlled radio and television networks to keep public media politically neutral and refrain from acting in the interest of any particular party. His successors followed this precedent. He also ordered the redeployment of a large police force in Paris in the wake of the May 68 events.

His accomplishments helped Poher, previously largely unknown to the public, develop significant popularity during his interim presidency, despite his defeat in the election.

He served again as &quot;ad interim&quot; head of state in 1974 after Pompidou died in office. This time, however, he did not run for his own term and stepped down after Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing was elected against François Mitterrand.

<doc id="507468" wikidata="Q4692219" url="?curid=507468" title="Aggie Yell Leaders">
<text>The Aggie Yell Leaders are a group of Texas A&amp;M University students that lead Aggie fans in a series of &quot;yells&quot; during athletic events or other school events. The Yell Leaders are composed of five students (three seniors and two juniors) who are elected annually by popular vote of the student body.

The Yell Leaders use a variety of hand signals, called &quot;pass-backs,&quot; to direct and intensify the crowds. Notable former Aggie Yell Leaders include former Texas Governor and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, trauma surgeon Dr. Red Duke and Texas State Representative Trent Ashby.

==History==
The Yell Leader tradition dates to 1907. According to A&amp;M lore, the Aggies were being soundly defeated and a large number of women who had taken the train from Texas Woman&#x27;s University in Denton were threatening to leave. The upperclassmen ordered the freshmen to find a way to keep the women entertained. Several freshmen sneaked into a maintenance closet and changed into white coveralls. They then began leading the crowd in yells and telling jokes from the track in front of the stands. It was an instant hit and was quickly incorporated into the gameday repertoire for the Aggies. However, the freshmen became so popular with the ladies that it was becoming a problem, and &quot;it was decided that only upperclassmen would be allowed to participate in this entertainment in the future.&quot; While usually a position held by members of the Corps of Cadets, non-Corps students have been elected to the position. Bill Beck, Class of 1942, was the first non-corps yell leader elected in 1946 and Ricky Wood, Class of 2001, became the first non-corps Head Yell Leader in 2000–2001. Since the tradition began there have been 32 non-Corps yell leaders. 

In the early 1990s, the student body elected its first African American yell leader, Ronnie McDonald, Class of 1993. In 1999, McDonald became the youngest African American to become a county judge in the history of Texas.

==Current tradition==

===Personnel===
The Aggie Yell Leaders are composed of three seniors and two juniors, with one senior designated as &quot;Head Yell Leader.&quot; They are elected annually, making A&amp;M one of the few schools that still elects spirit leaders. Sometimes, more than twice as many students vote for yell leader candidates than vote in the Student Body President elections. Traditionally, the Yell Leaders are members of the Texas A&amp;M University Corps of Cadets in keeping with A&amp;M&#x27;s military history, though &quot;non-reg&quot; students have occasionally earned election. The first &quot;non-reg&quot; elected as Yell Leader was Garry Mauro, class of 1970. Although women have campaigned for Yell Leader at the main Texas A&amp;M campus in College Station, none have ever been elected. In 2005, however, Amanda Filkins &#x27;07 was elected as Junior Yell Leader at Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston, which is the marine and maritime branch campus of Texas A&amp;M University.

NCAA rules prevent the Yell Leaders from participating in athletic practices, but the Head Yell Leader can usually be found during two-a-days, running and lifting alongside the football team. The Yell Leaders, along with junior and senior cadets of the Fightin&#x27; Texas Aggie Band, and Seniors of the Fightin&#x27; Texas Aggie Singing Cadets are the only students on campus who receive a varsity letter without playing a sport.

The Yell Leaders attend all home and away football games, all home men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball games, post-season basketball games, all home soccer games, all home volleyball games, and selected home and away games for other sporting events. The 2024-2025 yell leaders are Head Yell Leader Jake Carter &#x27;25, Senior Yell Leaders Grayson Poage &#x27;25 and Josiah Brantley &#x27;25 and Junior Yell Leaders Kyler Fife &#x27;26 and Luke Widener &#x27;26.

===Football-specific traditions===

Besides their game-day duties, the Aggie Yell leaders are the Masters of Ceremonies at the Aggie pep-rally-type event known as Midnight Yell Practice. This event is held the night before a football game, at midnight, at Kyle Field for home games and at a designated location in the opposing team&#x27;s city for away games. During these events, the Aggie Yell Leaders tell stories about ways in which &quot;Ol&#x27; Rock&quot; the prototypical Aggie defeats the upcoming opponents&#x27; mascots and lead the crowds in yells, so that all attendees know what to do in the coming game. They lead an additional, smaller, Yell Practice on the Thursday night before all away games (even bowl games), called Arch Yell, which is held in front of the 12 arches at the entryway to the Corps of Cadets quad area.

At the various yell practices, the Aggie Yell Leaders wear either maroon (seniors) or white (juniors) T-shirts and denim overalls that are embroidered by a seamstress, often featuring their graduation year and various depictions of the A&amp;M traditions. During sporting events, they always wear a white button-down shirt and white pants.
During a game, the Yell Leaders signal the crowd to start a yell by flashing pass backs. Once the signal is passed throughout the crowd, the Yell Leaders give the signal for the crowd to &quot;hump it,&quot; or lean forward with hands just above their knees, and the yell begins. The theory behind &quot;humpin&#x27; it&quot; is that it aligns the back, neck and throat in the proper position to maximize the noise. They also use pass backs to signal when to sing the various school songs, in much the same way as cheerleaders lead songs at other schools.

When the Aggie football team is defeated at home, the crowd remains in the stands at the end of the game while the Aggie Yell Leaders conduct a short yell practice, including the singing of the song 12th Man, in preparation for the next week&#x27;s game. If the Aggies win a home football game, the freshmen in the Corps of Cadets chase them around Kyle Field behind the 20 yard line, and, once they are captured, carry them across campus and toss them into Rudder Pond, a fountain full of cold water. After the last Yell Leader has been thrown into Rudder Pond, the soaking-wet Yell Leaders lead the fans in a yell practice against the following week&#x27;s opponent.

<text>Midnight Yell Practice, known locally as Midnight Yell or Yell Practice, is a tradition at Texas A&amp;M University. Midnight Yell is similar to a pep rally. On the night before each home football game, Midnight Yell takes place in Kyle Field at midnight; two nights before each away game, a Yell Practice (not at midnight) is held near the Quadrangle on the south side of campus. At midnight on the night before an away game Midnight Yell is held in or near the opponent&#x27;s city.

Besides exciting the crowd, Midnight Yell introduces the student body to any new yells and to practice changes to existing yells. All yell practices are led by the Yell Leaders, a set of five students who are elected to one-year terms by the student body.

==History==
Yell Practice began in 1913, while A&amp;M was still an all-male military school. Several companies would gather together to &quot;learn heartily the old time pep.&quot;

The first Midnight Yell was held in 1932. Two freshmen asked the senior Yell Leaders to hold a midnight practice so that students would be motivated for the upcoming football game against archrival Texas Longhorns. The Yell Leaders said that while they liked the idea, they couldn&#x27;t authorize a Yell Practice at that hour. However, they said that they just might &quot;show up&quot; at the campus YMCA Building that evening around midnight. The Fightin&#x27; Texas Aggie Band met them at the YMCA, and soon the bulk of the student body had gathered. The cadets used railroad flares to light the event, and a tradition was born.

In September 2022, the tradition received national media coverage after the Aggies&#x27; football loss to App State Mountaineers. The yell practice video shot before Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s 17-14 loss to App State was called &quot;embarrassing&quot; and &quot;cringeworthy&quot;. The clips appeared to vanish from the internet after Texas A&amp;M took down video clips on Twitter claiming copyright, but were soon reposted.

==Modern tradition==

===Home games===

Since that first Midnight Yell, the event has been held on the night before each home football game. The Fightin&#x27; Texas Aggie Band and the five Yell Leaders lead a parade from the Quadrangle, where the Corps dorms are located. Students and alumni line the route from the Quadrangle to Kyle Field, falling into line once those in front of them have passed. Students and alumni gather in the student section of the stands. At midnight, the yell practice begins. The Corps Juniors used to guard Kyle Field all night against students from other schools who may try to pull pranks the night before the game. This job has since been taken over by University Police but only the Corps Juniors are allowed to stand on the track around the Field in recognition of this tradition.

In a departure from their starched white game-day uniforms, at Midnight Yell the Yell Leaders typically wear painted denim overalls and T-shirts. With the senior Yell Leaders looking on, the junior Yell Leaders assemble at midfield and begin doing pushups. The pushups last for approximately nine minutes (3 songs played by the Aggie Band about 3 minutes each). When the juniors are finished, Reveille, the Texas A&amp;M mascot, is escorted onto the field.

The five Yell Leaders then arrange themselves in front of the stands and begin leading the yells. All yells are coordinated using hand signals. When the yell is ready to begin, the head Yell Leader gives a signal and the crowd &quot;humps it,&quot; with every person leaning forward to maximize the volume of their voices.

During the Yell Practice the crowd, which generally numbers 20,000 to 25,000 people, is led in the yells. The school songs &quot;Aggie War Hymn&quot; and &quot;Spirit of Aggieland&quot; are sung, the Yell Leaders will also tell two fables about how the Aggies are going to beat their opponent the next day.

At one point during the night the stadium lights are turned off and, traditionally, Aggies are supposed to kiss their dates (called &quot;mugging down&quot;). This relates to another student tradition: &quot;When One Aggie Scores, All Aggies Score.&quot; When the Aggies score a touch down, safety, or field goal, everyone in the student body who has brought a date to the game kisses his/her date.

If no date is present, single students light their cigarette lighters, commonly referred to as &quot;flicking your Bic,&quot; to make it easier for two dateless people to find each other in the dark.

===Away games===
If the game is an away game, a yell called an Arch (or Grove) Yell is held on campus the Thursday before the game, and a Midnight yell is held in a location in the away city. For example, if the annual game against the University of Texas is held in Austin the Midnight Yell is held on the steps of the Texas State Capitol. Grove yells were held at The Grove, an outdoor theater near the MSC which was torn down in 2003. Since then, they have been held in front of the twelve arches that mark the entrance to the Corps of Cadets quad area. Arch yells are usually at 7 PM, the attendance is much smaller (usually only the Corps of Cadets) but the tradition of &quot;mugging down&quot; is still followed.

===After-game Yell Practices===

After a victorious home football game, the Yell Leaders are tackled by the freshmen in the Corps and thrown into Fish Pond. Afterwards, the Aggie Band meets up with them and an informal yell practice ensues on the steps of the YMCA building. Should the Aggies run out of time (that is, lose) in a football game, a yell practice is held in the stands &quot;to display the continuing support for the Aggie team and to prepare for the next game.&quot;

<text>Esmerelda &quot;Esme&quot; Weatherwax (also Granny Weatherwax or Mistress Weatherwax) is a fictional character from Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; series. She is a witch and member of the Lancre coven. She is the self-appointed guardian of her small country, and frequently defends it against supernatural powers. She is one of the &quot;Discworld&quot; series&#x27;s main protagonists, having major roles in seven novels.

She is a very powerful witch, and is reckoned to be more powerful than the most well-known witch on the Discworld, Black Aliss. Granny says in &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot; that she &quot;learned my craft from Nanny Gripes, who learned it from Goody Heggety, who got it from Nanna Plumb, who was taught it by Black Aliss&quot;. The witches of the Lancre coven reflect the roles of &quot;Maiden, Mother, and Crone&quot;, with Granny, being most associated with the &quot;Crone&quot; — tactfully referred to as &quot;the other one&quot; — though meeting the criterion for the &quot;Maiden&quot; too.

Due to her prowess, Granny Weatherwax is first among equals of the Ramtops witches: &quot;Witches are not by nature gregarious, at least with other witches, and they certainly don&#x27;t have leaders. Granny Weatherwax was the most highly-regarded of the leaders they didn&#x27;t have.&quot; In &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;, the ghost of the King of Lancre addresses her as &quot;&quot; of Witches&quot; (&quot;Senior Lady of Witches&quot;). Granny Weatherwax&#x27;s reputation extends to other species: the Trolls of the Ramtops call her &quot;Aaoograha hoa&quot; (&quot;She Who Must Be Avoided&quot;; mentioned in &quot;Maskerade&quot;), the Dwarf call her &quot;K&#x27;ez&#x27;rek d&#x27;b&#x27;duz&quot; (&quot;Go Around the Other Side of the Mountain&quot;; also mentioned in &quot;Maskerade&quot;), and the Nac Mac Feegle call her &quot;The Hag O&#x27; Hags&quot; (&quot;The High Witch&quot;&quot;).

==Family and background==
According to &quot;Witches Abroad&quot;, Esmerelda &quot;Esme&quot; (later &quot;Granny&quot;) Weatherwax is the younger of two daughters. Her father was a hunter who taught her that &quot;a bad hunter chases, a good hunter waits&quot; (&quot;Lords and Ladies&quot;). Little is revealed about her mother except that she had a long illness and Esme nursed her until her death.

Magical ability runs in the Weatherwax family; a distant cousin, the wizard Galder Weatherwax, is Archchancellor of Unseen University at the time of &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;. When Esme was a child, her older sister Lily began misusing magic and behaving in a &quot;wanton&quot; and &quot;wilful&quot; manner. Lily left home as a teenager and never returned to Lancre.

By the time Esme reached her teens, she was determined to become a witch. She occasionally struggles with temptation to become a &quot;wicked witch&quot;, but also feels obligated to be &quot;the good one&quot; to balance her sister. In &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot; she reveals that she was not chosen as an apprentice by an established witch, but &quot;camped on old Nanny Gripes&#x27; garden until she promised to tell me everything she knew. Hah. That took her a week I had the afternoons free... No chose...&quot;). As a young woman, Esme was involved in a summer-long romance with student wizard Mustrum Ridcully, but ultimately they were both committed to their respective paths of witchcraft and wizardry. She was also acquainted with Gytha Ogg, who is about the same age, although their friendship does not develop until they are older. Esme eventually became the witch for village of Bad Ass and the Kingdom of Lancre as a whole. 

Granny, as she comes to be known, is in her 70s or 80s during the events of &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;, &quot;Witches Abroad&quot;, &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot;, &quot;Maskerade&quot; and &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot;. She dies quietly at home at the beginning of the final Discworld novel, &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;. When Death comes for her, he tells her that her candle will continue to flicker long after her passing and that she has left the world in a better condition than it was when she entered it. Author Neil Gaiman, a friend of Pratchett&#x27;s, has said that Pratchett died before writing a scene he had intended for the ending of &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;. According to Gaiman, this would have revealed that Granny&#x27;s spirit had lingered to watch over her young successor Tiffany Aching, and that when she did finally depart with Death it was on her own terms.

==Appearance==
Granny Weatherwax has striking blue eyes and a penetrating gaze, a hooked nose, and a determined set to her jaw. In &quot;Equal Rites&quot; she is described as &quot;handsome&quot;, having an excellent complexion, no warts, and all her teeth, although it is implied she finds this a bit inappropriate for a witch. Granny is thin, mentioning in &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot; that she weighs , and is described as being taller than Nanny Ogg and Magrat.

She typically wears a plain black dress, a somewhat battered black cloak (occasionally lined with dark red) and a tall, pointed witch&#x27;s hat, skewered to her &quot;iron-hard grey bun&quot; hairstyle with multiple hatpins. Her broom is a hand-me-down from another witch, Hilta (&quot;Equal Rites&quot;), and has been repaired many times. Due to its age, it requires the user to pick up speed by running along the ground before taking off.

==Personality==
Granny Weatherwax has a near-unshakeable, and usually accurate, belief in her own abilities. She believes in doing what is right rather than what is easy or even what seems &quot;nice&quot;; she is quietly aware of her social weaknesses and easily leans into the stereotype of an imposing, frightening witch if it suits her purposes. Granny appreciates practicality and hard work, and distrusts fiction and theater (up to and including many books) because of their powerful influence on people&#x27;s minds and ability to openly mislead them.

The journal &quot;Gender Forum&quot; has posited that Granny Weatherwax bears some similarity to Sam Vimes and Death. All three are effectively &#x27;good&#x27; characters who exert a rigid control over the darkness inside themselves, which they secretly fear but (crucially to their characters) are able to conquer.

According to &quot;The Pratchett Portfolio&quot; Granny&#x27;s typical saying is: &quot;I can&#x27;t be having with that kind of thing&quot;.

==Powers==
Granny is adept at &#x27;Borrowing&#x27;, the art of overlaying her mind on the mind of another creature so that she can see through its eyes and steer its actions. She can sense the moods of plants, animals, and even places such as the Kingdom of Lancre and Unseen University. While Borrowing, her body falls into a deathlike trance. It is revealed in &quot;Lords And Ladies&quot; that in order to prevent embarrassing accidents, she has taken to wearing a placard reading &quot;I ATE&#x27;NT DEAD&quot; when she does so. When her body finally dies, she edits this placard to state &quot;I IS PROBLY DEAD&quot;, with &#x27;ATE&#x27;NT&#x27; scratched out.

Although capable of powerful magic, Granny Weatherwax prefers to avoid using it. She often relies on &quot;headology&quot;, a sort of folk-psychology that makes use of the placebo and nocebo effects. For instance, although Granny is capable of placing curses upon people who anger her, she will instead simply allow them to &quot;believe&quot; that she has cursed them. This causes the &quot;cursed&quot; person to worry and attribute any misfortune they experience to the &quot;curse&quot;. Nanny Ogg has implied that this avoidance of magic specifically prevents Granny from being tempted into becoming a very successful &quot;bad&quot; witch, who seemingly tend to meet with embarrassing, ignoble ends. In &quot;The Sea and Little Fishes&quot;, Nanny Ogg attributes Granny&#x27;s magical abilities more to hard work than innate talent.

Because of her reluctance to openly use magic, Granny Weatherwax is sometimes accused by others of &quot;working by trickery alone&quot;, and of &quot;having little or no real power&quot;. Yet when the need arises, Granny Weatherwax has demonstrated skills such as psychokinesis (&quot;Lords and Ladies&quot;) and pyrokinesis (&quot;The Sea and Little Fishes&quot;). In &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot; she sends the entire nation of Lancre forward in time fifteen years to allow the lost heir to come of age. Much like wizards in the same setting, she also warns about the extreme use of magic potentially attracting unwanted supernatural attention.

==Bibliography==
Granny Weatherwax is one of Terry Pratchett&#x27;s most prolific recurring characters. She is a major character in six Discworld novels (&quot;Equal Rites&quot;, &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;, &quot;Witches Abroad&quot;, &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot;, &quot;Maskerade&quot; and &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot;) and the short story &quot;The Sea and Little Fishes&quot;, and a supporting character in the five Tiffany Aching books (&quot;Wee Free Men&quot;, &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot;, &quot;Wintersmith&quot;, &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot;, and &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;). She is referred to in three other &quot;Discworld&quot; novels, &quot;Mort&quot;, &quot;Thief of Time&quot;, and &quot;Going Postal&quot;, and appears in &quot;The Science of Discworld II: The Globe&quot;.

A. S. Byatt considered that Granny &quot;became more and more complex&quot; as she appeared in more novels, while &quot;National Public Radio&quot; considered her an &quot;iconic&quot; character and &quot;one of [Pratchett]&#x27;s clear favorites&quot;.

In the &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot; animated adaptation, Granny Weatherwax was voiced by Annette Crosbie and in the BBC Radio 4 dramatisation she was played by Sheila Hancock.

==Reception and legacy==
A fossil species of Mesozoic ginkgo has been named &quot;Ginkgoites weatherwaxiae&quot; in Granny Weatherwax&#x27;s honour.

<text>Gytha Ogg (usually called Nanny Ogg) is a character from Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; series. She is a witch and a member of the Lancre Coven. Gytha is known for her practical approach to magic and her no-nonsense attitude. She is also renowned for her culinary skills and is an excellent cook. Gytha Ogg is often depicted as a strong, capable, and independent character, with a sharp sense of humor. She frequently appears in the Discworld series, particularly in the books featuring the Lancre witches.

== Personality ==
The character of Nanny Ogg is based on someone Pratchett knew in real life, &quot;an old lady who liked a drink and a laugh, but...I suspect you could find someone like her on any street.&quot; Discworld illustrator Paul Kidby expressed a similar view of the character, writing, &quot;I like to think we all know someone like Nanny Ogg, a person who enjoys a drink and has led a happy and full life.&quot;

Nanny Ogg has been married three times, and is the mother of fifteen children and has many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She has a talent for getting along with others. As described in &quot;Maskerade&quot;, after knowing her for fifteen minutes, people feel as if they have known her all of their lives.

=== Comparison with Granny ===
Nanny Ogg is a more down-to-earth character than Esme Weatherwax. Granny Weatherwax comes across as judgmental, whereas Nanny is broadminded. She appears to be kinder than Granny but is prepared to make tough decisions if necessary. Incurring Nanny&#x27;s wrath is suggested to be dangerous of her kind personality. In Pratchett&#x27;s short story &quot;The Sea and Little Fishes&quot; Nanny Ogg also identifies herself, and the Ogg family as a whole, as having immense natural magical talent, but less willing to work hard as do the Weatherwaxes.

Unlike Granny Weatherwax, and the stereotype of witches in general, Nanny Ogg does not live in an isolated cottage but in a well-looked-after townhouse in the capital of Lancre with her eldest and youngest sons living to either side. Her house is called Tir Nani Ogg (&quot;Nanny Ogg&#x27;s place&quot;, and a pun on the Tír na nÓg, the Gaelic name for the Land of the Ever-Young). She shares this home with Greebo, a tomcat of evil aura and aroma and astonishing viciousness, whom she still sees as a sweet kitten.

=== Exploits ===
Nanny enjoys food and drink, despite only having one remaining tooth. Within the Discworld universe, Nanny has written several books: &quot;The Joye of Snacks&quot; (a cookbook of aphrodisiac recipes, the publication of which plays a role in the plot of &quot;Maskerade&quot;), &quot;Mother Ogg&#x27;s Tales For Tiny Folk&quot; and &quot;Nanny Ogg&#x27;s Cookbook&quot;.

When she is drunk and/or bathing, Nanny sings bawdy songs such as &quot;The Hedgehog Can Never Be Buggered At All&quot; or &quot;The Hedgehog Song.&quot; Only a few lines appear in the Discworld books, but many readers have written their versions. Another Nanny Ogg song is &quot;A Wizard&#x27;s Staff has a Knob on the End,&quot; a version of which has been written by Heather Wood, with music by Dave Greenslade. It is also notable that Nanny Ogg once gave Agnes Nitt lessons on how to sing, including how to sing in harmony with herself (using her alter ego, Perdita).

Nanny Ogg is known for her romantic exploits. She has a very cheerful, practical attitude regarding sexuality and frequently offers unsolicited advice and anecdotes. As a young woman, she was the muse and subject of Leonard of Quirm&#x27;s masterpiece, the &quot;Mona Ogg&quot;. While she had numerous sexual partners as an unmarried woman and later as a widow, she claims that she was never unfaithful to any of her husbands while married.

Nanny Ogg is very funny and has a tremendous laugh. She has also been credited with a grin &quot;that should have been locked up for the sake of public decency&quot; and her face has been described as looking like &quot;a friendly pumpkin.&quot;

== Role and power ==
The witches of the Lancre coven reflect the roles of Maiden, Mother, and Crone, with Nanny Ogg as the Mother. Nuttall observes that, while some of the Discworld witch characters progress through these roles, Nanny is associated &quot;purely with the role of the Mother.&quot; In addition to being the matriarch of a large family, Nanny also fulfills a Mother role in the community; &quot;she is a talented midwife, and takes a maternal attitude to the majority of people she meets&quot;. In &quot;Thief of Time&quot;, Nanny Ogg is acknowledged as the best midwife in the world, and has experience with non-human species like trolls. She briefly takes on young Tiffany Aching as an apprentice after the death of Tiffany&#x27;s previous mentor, Miss Treason.

While Nanny Ogg&#x27;s bawdy sense of humor and sexually active past &quot;would seem to contradict her association with the role of Mother&quot;, Nuttall points to this as evidence that Nanny &quot;never truly fitted the role of Maiden&quot; and that the character &quot;represents female sexuality as powerful, natural, and something to be celebrated&quot;. Even in old age, she enjoys flirting and male attention, such as with the dwarf Casanunda.

Nanny Ogg has impressive social skills, and often relies upon these rather than witchcraft to gather information or persuade others. Throughout the series she demonstrates the ability to socialize with all kinds of people, which sometimes leaves Granny wondering &#x27;if Gytha has some sort of special magic&#x27;. In &quot;The Art of Discworld&quot;, Pratchett writes, &quot;I&#x27;ve always suspected that Nanny is, deep down, the most powerful of the witches, and part of her charm lies in the way she prevents people from finding this out.&quot;

== Family ==
Nanny Ogg is the matriarch of her vast extended family. Although she is an affectionate mother and grandmother, Nanny is a tyrant to her daughters-in-law and orders them to perform household chores.

Nanny Ogg claims in &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot; that her ancestors invented the ancient language of Oggham, the Discworld equivalent of the ancient Irish alphabet Ogham.

Several of Nanny&#x27;s relatives play supporting roles in the Discworld books. Many others are mentioned briefly.

===Jason Ogg===
Eldest son of Nanny Ogg, first mentioned in &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;. Like his father before him, he is the Lancre blacksmith. He is also the leader of the Lancre Morris Men, who treat Morris dancing as something between a contact sport and a martial art.

Jason is something of a gentle giant (somewhat like Constable Bluejohn), and very deferring and respectful to his mother and other witches.

===Shawn Ogg===
Youngest son of Nanny Ogg. First appears in &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot; as a guard at Lancre Castle. He later becomes Lancre&#x27;s entire army, as well as the civil service and most of the palace staff. According to &quot;Nanny Ogg&#x27;s Cookbook,&quot; he has been granted the Order of the Lancrastian Empire. He is also notable for inventing the Lancrastian Army Knife.

===Shane Ogg===
Nanny&#x27;s grandson, Shane is a sailor and has taught her some &#x27;basic foreign language&#x27;, mostly made up of mangled words from French and other European languages.

===Neville Ogg===
Neville is a thief and (prior to the events of &quot;Maskerade&quot;) stole all the lead from the roof of the Ankh-Morpork Opera House. Afterward he hid at Mrs. Palm&#x27;s establishment. When Nanny Ogg and Granny Weatherwax visit Ankh-Morpork in &quot;Maskerade&quot;, they also seek lodging with Mrs. Palm, and are surprised to learn that this is a brothel rather than a boarding house.

==Adaptations==
In the &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot; animated adaptation, Nanny Ogg was voiced by June Whitfield. In the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of &quot;Wyrd Sisters,&quot; she was played by Lynda Baron.

==Reception and legacy==
Nanny Ogg, along with Rincewind, was pictured on first-class Royal Mail stamps in March 2011.

In &quot;The Art of Discworld&quot;, Pratchett mentions a fossil species of Mesozoic ginkgo known as &quot;Ginkgoites nannyoggiae&quot;.

<doc id="507507" wikidata="Q348449" url="?curid=507507" title="Keith Rowe">
<text>Keith Rowe (born 16 March 1940 in Plymouth, England) is an English free improvisation tabletop guitarist and painter. Rowe is a founding member of both AMM in the mid-1960s and M.I.M.E.O. Having trained as a visual artist, his paintings have appeared on most of his albums. He is seen as a godfather of EAI (electroacoustic improvisation), with many of his recordings having been released by Erstwhile.

==Biography==
Rowe began his career playing jazz in the early 1960s with Mike Westbrook and Lou Gare. His early influences were guitarists Wes Montgomery, Charlie Christian, and Barney Kessel. But he grew tired of what he considered the genre&#x27;s limitations. He began experimenting. An important step was a New Year&#x27;s resolution to stop tuning his guitar—much to Westbrook&#x27;s displeasure. He began playing free jazz and free improvisation, abandoning conventional guitar technique. He was featured in &#x27;Crossing Bridges&#x27;, a 1985 music programme based around jazz guitar improvisation, and broadcast by Channel 4

His change was partially inspired by a teacher in a painting class who told him, &quot;Rowe, you cannot paint a Caravaggio. Only Caravaggio can paint Caravaggio.&quot; Rowe said that after considering this idea from a musical perspective, &quot;trying to play guitar like Jim Hall seemed quite wrong.&quot; For several years he contemplated how to reinvent his approach to the guitar, again finding inspiration in visual art, specifically American painter Jackson Pollock, who abandoned traditional painting methods to forge his style. &quot;How could I abandon the technique? Lay the guitar flat!&quot;

Rowe developed prepared guitar techniques: placing the guitar flat on a table and manipulating the strings, body, and pick-ups in unorthodox ways. He has used needles, electric motors, violin bows, iron bars, a library card, rubber eraser, springs, hand-held electric fans, alligator clips, and common office supplies in playing the guitar. Rowe sometimes incorporates live radio broadcasts into his performances, including shortwave radio and number stations (the guitar&#x27;s pick-ups will also pick up radio signals, and broadcast them through the amplifier).

Percussionist Eddie Prévost of AMM said Rowe finds radio broadcasts which seem to blend ideally with, or offer startling commentary on, the music. (Prévost, 18). On &quot;AMMMusic&quot;, towards the end of the cacophonous &quot;Ailantus Glandolusa&quot;, a speaker announces via radio that &quot;We cannot preserve the normal music.&quot; Prevost writes that during an AMM performance in Istanbul, Rowe located and integrated a radio broadcast of &quot;the pious intonation of a male Turkish voice. AMM of course, had absolutely no idea what the material was. Later, it was complimented upon the judicious way that verses from &quot;The Koran&quot; had been introduced into the performance, and the respectful way they had been treated!&quot;

In reviewing &quot;World Turned Upside Down&quot;, critic Dan Hill writes, &quot;Rowe has tuned his shortwave radio to some dramatically exotic gameshow and human voices spatter the mix, though at such low volume, they&#x27;re unintelligible and abstracted. Rowe never overplays this device, a clear temptation with such a seductive technology – the awesome possibility of sonically reaching out across a world of voices requires experienced hands to avoid simple but ultimately short-term pleasure. This he does masterfully, mixing in random operatics and chance encounters with talk show hosts to anchor the sound in humanity, amidst the abstraction.&quot;

Rowe has worked with Oren Ambarchi, Burkhard Beins, Cornelius Cardew, Christian Fennesz, Kurt Liedwart, Jeffrey Morgan, Toshimaru Nakamura, Evan Parker, Michael Pisaro, Peter Rehberg, Sachiko M, Howard Skempton, Taku Sugimoto, David Sylvian, John Tilbury, Christian Wolff, and Otomo Yoshihide.

In 2008 at Tate Modern, London, Rowe performed a live collaborative work &quot;The Room&quot; with film makers, Jarman award winner Luke Fowler, and Peter Todd as a part of the programme accompanying the major retrospective of the painter Mark Rothko. &quot;The Room&quot; featured films by Fowler and Todd and live guitar improvisation by Rowe with subsequent iterations being presented in France and Spain and the Netmage festival in Bologna Italy. &quot;The Room&quot; is also the title of a work by Rowe issued on CD in 2007 followed by &quot;The Room Extended&quot; in 2016 on a four CD set both from erstwhile records.

<text>The Aggie Bonfire was a long-standing annual tradition at Texas A&amp;M University as part of the college rivalry with the University of Texas at Austin. For 90 years, Texas A&amp;M students—known as Aggies—built a bonfire on campus each autumn, known to the Aggie community simply as &quot;Bonfire&quot;. The event symbolized Aggie students&#x27; &quot;burning desire to beat the hell outta t.u.&quot;, a derogatory nickname for the University of Texas.

The bonfire was traditionally lit around Thanksgiving in conjunction with festivities surrounding the annual football game. Early bonfires were little more than piles of trash, but the event gradually became more organized and eventually grew to an immense size, setting the world record in 1969. In 1999, the Bonfire collapsed during construction, killing 12 and injuring 27 others. The accident led Texas A&amp;M to declare a hiatus on an official Bonfire. However, since 2002, a student-sponsored coalition has constructed an annual unsanctioned, off-campus &quot;Student Bonfire&quot; in the spirit of its predecessor.

==Early years==

The students of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, known as Aggies, burned their first bonfire on November 18, 1907, to congratulate the football team on a recent win. The first on-campus Aggie Bonfire, a heap of trash and debris, was burned in 1909 to generate enthusiasm for a variety of sporting events. A decade later, the focus of the event narrowed to the annual rivalry game between Texas A&amp;M and the University of Texas, held near Thanksgiving Day. Little information was recorded about the early Bonfires; the 1921 Texas A&amp;M yearbook mentioned the &quot;final rally&quot; of the students before the game against Texas, but did not refer to a bonfire. Six years later, the school yearbook published a photograph of the event.

Freshmen were expected to build the early Bonfires to help prove their worth. For almost two decades, the students constructed Bonfire from debris and wood acquired through various, sometimes illicit, means, including appropriating lumber intended for a dormitory in 1912. In 1935, a farmer reported that students carried off his entire barn as fuel for Bonfire. To prevent future incidents, the university made Bonfire a school-sanctioned event. The following year, for the first time, the school provided axes, saws, and trucks for the students and pointed them toward a grove of dead trees on the edge of town.

During the 1940s, the school paper described Bonfire as &quot;the greatest event of the football season&quot;. The 1947 Corps handbook stated that &quot;bonfire symbolizes two things: a burning desire to beat the team from the University of Texas, and the undying flame of love that every loyal Aggie carries in his heart for the school&quot;; this was often shortened to &quot;the burning desire to beat the hell out of t.u.&quot;
The Bonfire design changed in 1942. Universal Studios, filming the movie &quot;We&#x27;ve Never Been Licked&quot; on the Texas A&amp;M Campus, built a bonfire as a prop for the movie. Their structure used a design similar to a teepee, where all the logs rested against each other in a conical shape. The logs were placed at an angle between 23 and 30 degrees, giving it &quot;a tremendous vertical and horizontal resistance&quot;. This allowed Bonfire to grow from tall to over tall. Subsequent Aggies adopted the new idea, and the teepee design became standard for Bonfires for the next 25 years.
Beginning in 1952, the bonfires were constructed entirely from fresh-cut logs. The event suffered its first fatality in 1955, when a student was struck by a swerving car. For unrelated reasons, that same year the Bonfire was moved from Simpson Drill Field in front of the Memorial Student Center to Duncan Field, near the dorms of the Corps of Cadets (whose leaders oversaw construction). In 1957, the structure collapsed two days before Bonfire was to be held, but students worked around-the-clock to rebuild it, and the bonfire burned as scheduled.

During this period, University of Texas students attempted several stunts, trying to light the stack early, but to no avail. In both 1933 and 1948, students from UT rented an airplane and tried to drop fire bombs onto the stack. In one of these instances, the plane ran low on fuel, and was forced to land at Easterwood Airport in College Station—the wooden portions of the plane found themselves part of Bonfire that year. In 1956, there was an unsuccessful attempt to plant explosives at the Bonfire site, and, in the late 1970s, a College Station police officer was fired after trying to ignite the bonfire several days ahead of schedule. Students spotted the officer before he could succeed and chased him across campus. In 1999, a Longhorn fan hired someone to build a six-foot model airplane designed to carry a bomb into the wood stack to ignite it prematurely. &quot;He was actually in the process of building that plane when they had the tragedy at bonfire&quot;, Mel Stekoll said. &quot;At that point, we scrapped the plan. It would have been the next year that we planned to try it.&quot;

==Organizational change and expansion==

In 1965, membership in the Corps of Cadets became voluntary for students at Texas A&amp;M. Before, Corps leaders directed construction of Bonfire. However, because the Corps had no authority over the &quot;non-regs&quot;, or civilian students, a separate Bonfire leadership structure was instituted. The new leaders were designated with colored hard hats, or pots, with the overall leaders known as redpots.

The first Bonfire built with both Corps and non-reg participation was in 1963. The stack was scheduled to burn only days after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Out of respect, the students dismantled the stack. As Head Yell Leader Mike Marlowe explained, &quot;It is the most we have and the least we can give.&quot;

In the following years the structure became more elaborate, and in 1967 the flames could be seen away. In 1969, the stack of logs set the world record for the height of a bonfire at tall. Out of concern for the safety of participants and the community, the university limited the size to tall and in diameter. As an added precaution, nearby campus buildings were equipped with rooftop sprinkler systems. Despite the new height restrictions, in the 1970s, the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; listed Aggie Bonfire as the largest bonfire in the world.

==Design change==

In 1978, Bonfire shifted from its previous teepee design to a wedding cake style, in which upper stacks of logs were wedged on top of lower stacks. The structure was built around a fortified center pole, made from two telephone poles spliced together by cutting matching notches, approximately long, and with of glue. Four steel plates were bolted to the two poles, and a cable wrapped around the joint and secured to the pole with steel staples. Four perimeter poles were placed away and ropes were stretched between the perimeter poles to center poles and tension placed on them to hold the center pole together. After the center pole was erected, logs were placed vertically around it in a multi-tiered wedding cake design composed of thousands of logs. By 1984, the logs were sloping only 14 degrees. The spiral arrangement of the logs was designed to make Bonfire collapse into itself in a twisting motion, thus protecting spectators. Although the tradition stated that if Bonfire burned through midnight then A&amp;M would win the following day&#x27;s football game, the introduction of the wedding cake design drastically reduced the time it took for Bonfire to fall, sometimes burning for only 30 or 45 minutes.

Despite the complexity of the design, there were no formal written instructions or architectural blueprints for the construction of Bonfire. Knowledge on how to build the structure was passed verbally from one redpot to the next. By 1999, the only written documentation on the building of Bonfire was the rough schematic printed on the back of the official Bonfire T-shirt worn by participants from the freshman honors dormitory, Lechner.

While the Bonfires of the 1960s were constructed in five to ten days, working primarily in daylight, by the late 1970s, changes in the school led to a more elaborate and lengthy construction schedule. Construction began in late October with &quot;Cut&quot;, obtaining wood by cutting down trees with axes, which took several weekends. After Cut, students brought the logs to campus during &quot;Load&quot;, a process by which the logs were loaded by hand onto flatbed trucks and brought to campus. In early November, crews began &quot;Stack&quot;, a three-week period in which the logs were wired together and Bonfire took shape. Near the end of stack, known as &quot;Push&quot;, students worked around the clock in rotating shifts. The first four of the six stacks were built with the efforts of all safety-trained participants. The day before Bonfire was scheduled to burn, junior redpots would build the fifth stack, and then senior redpots would build the sixth.
During Cut, all logs were felled by hand, with students working in teams to chop down each tree with their axes. The manual labor ensured that participants were invested in each log that went into the Bonfire. Once the trees had fallen, brownpots, the &quot;executive lumberjacks&quot;, used chainsaws to cut limbs and prepare the logs.

To ensure safety during the Stack period, the organizers maintained a perimeter around the working area, and allowed only safety-trained students through. Cranes, donated by local construction companies, assisted in getting logs onto the upper tiers, and volunteers from those companies were on-hand at all times to offer advice. Emergency medical technicians were also required to be on site at all times and no more than 70 students at a time were allowed on the stack. Once the stack was finished, a burnt-orange outhouse with &quot;t.u frat house&quot; painted on the front was placed on top of the stack.

Although between two and five thousand students participated in the construction of Bonfire each year, most worked only part-time, and many worked only one or two shifts. Student workers were organized by dormitories or Corps units, with a separate off-campus student team. Many former students participated with teams they belonged to as students. Each team had assigned shifts, although individuals were not limited to working only the assigned shifts. Students working on Bonfire wore &quot;grodes&quot;—old T-shirts, jeans, and boots. By tradition, grodes were either not washed until after Bonfire burned or not washed at all.

In 1983, the city of College Station began manufacturing Austin city limits signs for students to place at the summit of the Bonfire so that students would stop stealing signs from Austin. The Fightin&#x27; Texas Aggie Band began building the outhouse, ending the tradition of stealing Bonfire&#x27;s components.
==Controversy==

Although women were allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was partially rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them as they tried to take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.

Injuries plagued the construction process. In 1981, student Wiley Keith Jopling died after being run over by a tractor at the Cut site. At the 1985 Cut site, one student broke his hip, and, in 1989, another student lost two fingers when logs crushed his hand. Fractures and amputations were rare, but many students suffered cuts, scrapes, or exposure to poison ivy. Hazing, including beatings with ax handles, was common.

The 1980s also saw increased alcohol consumption during the Bonfire ceremony. In 1988, police issued 140 Minor in Possession (of alcohol) citations and arrested six people. The following year, the local police department brought a paddywagon to the site for the first time, as they anticipated mass arrests for alcohol violations. As many as 150 police officers were on duty during the Bonfire burning from the Texas A&amp;M and College Station police departments and the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission.

In 1989, the Campus Ministry Association, representing 17 religious denominations, unanimously approved a resolution asking the university to change Bonfire because of concerns about safety, participant academic performance, humanitarian considerations, and the environment. Shortly afterwards, the Faculty Senate&#x27;s Committee of the Whole approved a resolution asking for a panel to explore alternatives to Bonfire.

Although students protested Bonfire&#x27;s environmental impact since 1970, no changes were made for decades. In 1990, student Scott Hantman asked the Bonfire leadership to help him address the problem. The group solicited volunteers, and in the spring of 1991, they planted 400 trees. The tradition, Aggie Replant, has been repeated annually. The Replant organization became independent of Bonfire in 1994 when it gained its own Student Government Committee.

==Later years==

After being held at the Duncan Intramural Fields on the south side of A&amp;M&#x27;s campus for 27 years, in 1992, Bonfire was relocated to the Polo Fields on the northeast corner of campus. This more isolated site, with a larger area for people to gather, made it a safer location. After heavy rains in 1994, the partially completed Bonfire began to slowly lean to the side as the soil underneath shifted. Student officials had enough warning to clear the area and tear down the Bonfire one week before its scheduled burn date. Nine tractors, two bulldozers, and two forklifts dismantled the stack on October 26, 1994 (three weeks earlier than usual; the Aggies&#x27; game vs. Texas was moved from Thanksgiving weekend to the first weekend of November due to the NCAA&#x27;s ban against Texas A&amp;M from appearing on television that season), which, at 70% completed, stood tall and wide.
Students and alumni flocked to the Polo Fields, working around the clock, to rebuild the Bonfire in time for the game. It was completed only hours before it was scheduled to burn. After the 1994 Bonfire was burned, two tons of lime were spread on the Polo Fields to stabilize the ground. This layer hardened to a consistency similar to concrete.

In 1996 a student, Greg White, died in a car accident on his way home from Cut. The student and several companions were riding in the bed of a pickup truck when the driver lost control and the truck rolled. Nine other students were injured.

In its later years, students building Bonfire used logs donated by local landowners who wanted their land cleared for construction or farming. Over 8000 logs were used each year in the late 1990s, taking about 5000 students a combined 125,000 man-hours to construct. After being doused in 700 lb (318 kg) of jet fuel, applied by staff members at A&amp;M&#x27;s Fire Training School, the Redpots and Yell Leaders then lit the stack with torches the night before the annual football game against the University of Texas when at home and two nights before the game when it was played in Austin.

This event was popular among current and former students and people traveled from all over the state and the nation to observe the burning of Bonfire. Hotel rooms within of College Station were booked weeks or months in advance of the date Bonfire burned. Crowds ranged from 30,000 to 70,000 people, depending on the weather and the strength of the Aggie football team. The 1998 Bonfire was broadcast live on Fox Sports Southwest.

==1999 collapse==
At approximately 2:42 a.m. on November 18, 1999, the 59-foot-high stack, consisting of about 5000 logs, collapsed during construction. Of the 58 students and former students working on the stack, 12 were killed and 27 were injured. Immediately after the collapse, Emergency Medical Technicians and trained First Responders of the Texas A&amp;M Emergency Care Team (TAMECT), a student-run, volunteer service, who staffed each stage of construction, administered first aid. TAMECT alerted the University Police and University EMS (also a student-run service), who dispatched all remaining university medics, and requested mutual aid from the surrounding agencies. In addition to the mutual aid received from the College Station and Bryan, Texas EMS, Fire, and Police Departments, members of Texas Task Force 1, the state&#x27;s elite emergency response team, arrived to assist the rescue efforts.

==Bonfire Memorial==

A memorial was constructed on the university polo fields, the site of the accident. Construction began in October 2003 and was completed by November 2004. On November 18, 2004, five years following the incident, the Bonfire Memorial was officially dedicated. The memorial is composed of three design elements:
* Tradition Plaza – Marks the entrance to the memorial and reflects on Aggie traditions.
* History Walk – Consists of 89 stones representing the 89 previous years of Bonfire. A gap in the timeline signifies the 1963 Bonfire, which did not burn due to the John F. Kennedy assassination. The three previous Bonfire-related deaths are also memorialized on this timeline.
* Spirit Ring – The ring surrounds the site of the collapse and represents the spirit that brought the students together. Twelve portals are placed around the ring, oriented toward each student&#x27;s hometown. Twenty-seven stones complete the ring, representing the 27 students injured in the collapse.

The memorial design has been recognized by several organizations as an outstanding architectural design and masonry accomplishment. The American Institute of Architects, San Antonio Chapter, recognized the memorial as a winner of the 2005 AIA San Antonio Design Award. The memorial also was recognized as a winner of the 2005 MCAA International Excellence in Masonry Awards.

To further honor the victims, in 2000, the Aggie Replant Committee planted 12 live oak trees at the Polo Grounds.

==Student Bonfire==

Shortly after the university officially cancelled Bonfire, students began planning an unofficial bonfire for November 2002. Known as the &quot;Unity Project&quot;, it became the first unofficial Bonfire since the 1930s. This fire consisted of three piles of wood, with the center stack being high. Despite a lack of official advertisement, over one thousand spectators attended.

The following year, the unofficial event was rebranded Student Bonfire. Now a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, Student Bonfire has official bylaws and a Board of Directors comprising former students. The bylaws specify the design that must be used each year, and no changes have been permitted since the first burn in 2003. This design, based on the recommendation of the 2002 university task force and approved by a structural engineer, results in a Bonfire less than half the size of those from the 1960s. In a departure from previous practice, every log in the stack touches the ground. To maintain the traditional wedding-cake design, the logs are cut to different heights, with the tallest set reaching high. The lowered height eliminates the need for a spliced center pole. Instead, a single utility pole, sunk into the ground, serves as the center pole. As in the pre-1999 versions of Bonfire, each log is tied to the log next to it with baling wire. To further fortify the structure, aircraft-grade steel cable is wrapped around each tier. For added support, four poles are spaced evenly around the stack and then bolted to the center pole, each with a steel pipe. These poles are known as Windle-sticks, after Levi Windle, a staunch supporter of Student Bonfire who died in an unrelated accident in 2003.

The Board changed or eliminated many of the minor traditions that had proliferated during Aggie Bonfire, primarily for safety reasons. Alcohol is prohibited, and hazing has been banned. The Bonfire leadership structure has remained in place, although in 2014 only 10 of the 26 dorms were represented by Bonfire crews. Attendance for Student Bonfire ranges from 8,000 to 15,000 people and the event is held in Brazos County or one of the surrounding counties. 

The 2013 Student Bonfire attracted 12,000 people, despite being postponed until January due to flooding. There was a virtual Burn in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the only persons allowed to attend in-person were those that built it. In 2022, the stack site was moved up the road, but the new site was located on a flood plain. Frequent rain during Stack season causing deep mud at the site, and forecasted rain for Burn night, forced Burn to be delayed to January 2023.

<doc id="507525" wikidata="Q332980" url="?curid=507525" title="Air Europa">
<text>Air Europa Líneas Aéreas, S.A.U., branded as Air Europa, is the third-largest Spanish airline after Iberia and Vueling. The airline is headquartered in Llucmajor, Mallorca, Spain; it has its main hub at Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport with focus city operations at Palma de Mallorca Airport and Tenerife North Airport. Air Europa flies to over 44 destinations in Spain, the rest of Europe, South America, North America, the Caribbean, Morocco and Tunisia. Since September 2007, Air Europa has been member of the SkyTeam alliance.

==History==
===Early years===
Air Europa started in 1986 (registered in Spain as Air España SA and previously known as such) as part of the British ILG-Air Europe Group and 75% owned by Spanish banks. It originally had a similar livery to Air Europe but with Air Europa titles and its aircraft were registered in Spain. It flew holiday charters from Mediterranean resorts and European cities using Boeing 737-300s and Boeing 757s. It was the first Spanish private company to operate national scheduled flights (besides charter flights which used to be its main business).

When parent company ILG ceased trading in 1991 Air Europa continued profitably with a larger fleet of Boeing 737s and 757s. It signed a franchise agreement with Iberia in January 1998, but this has since been dissolved. It is now owned by Globalia Corporación Empresarial S.A.

At the end of the 1990s, Boeing 737-800 jets were introduced along with a new livery. In June 2005, it was announced Air Europa was among four future associate members of the SkyTeam alliance, due to join by 2006. However, the joining date was postponed, and it did not become a member until 1 September 2007. Air Europa was the parent company for Air Dominicana, the new flag carrier of the Dominican Republic, until bankruptcy was declared for the Dominican Republic carrier on September 21, 2009.

===Developments since 2010===
Air Europa retired its last Boeing 767 on April 13, 2012.

On May 22, 2019, the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil (ANAC) granted Air Europa permission to operate domestic flights in the country. This was the first time a foreign company was granted such authorisation, after Brazilian laws were changed to allow full foreign ownership of domestic airlines. As of June 2019, no details were available about Air Europa&#x27;s future domestic operations in Brazil, a market which the airline already serves with international flights from Madrid to Salvador and Recife.

===Proposed acquisition by International Airlines Group===
On November 4, 2019, International Airlines Group (IAG) announced plans to acquire Air Europa from Globalia for €1 billion ($1.1 billion) with the deal expected to close in the first half of 2020. At the time, Air Europa operated a fleet of 66 aircraft and had generated an operating profit of €100 million in 2018. IAG stated its intention to integrate Air Europa into Iberia while indefinitely retaining the brand. IAG expected to see an ROI by the fourth year with full synergy by 2025 including inter-group codeshares, bank timing adjustments at Madrid Airport, and sales and loyalty program alignment. In January 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the parties agreed to cut the transaction price in half to €500 million. Plans for a merger were scrapped in November 2021, with both parties seeking ways to revive it, with a deadline set for the end of January 2022. However, in August 2022, IAG converted a loan to Air Europa into a 20% shareholding.

In February 2023, IAG agreed to buy Air Europa for €400 million, with the brand to remain intact despite IAG&#x27;s plans to make it part of Iberia. The decision followed interventions by the Spanish government, a key proponent of the merger. According to IAG, the merger would allow for the launch of Asia flights from the Madrid hub, which the Spanish government had advocated for. If the deal were to be approved by regulators, then once the merger would be complete, Air Europa was expected to exit SkyTeam and join other IAG members as part of Oneworld. In January 2024, the European Commission said the deal could reduce competition on domestic routes in Spain and short-haul routes from Madrid to other major cities in Europe and the Mediterranean. The EU competition enforcer also cited concerns over long-haul routes between Madrid and the Americas. In February 2024, Reuters reported that IAG was likely to be hit with an EU antitrust warning, suggesting that regulators found IAG&#x27;s proposed remedies to be insufficient to alleviate competition concerns.

In August 2024, IAG announced that it would abandon the deal after deeming additional remedies to address EU antitrust conditions too onerous to make the deal viable. IAG said it would instead seek to grow its position in Madrid to develop it into a rival to Europe&#x27;s major aviation hubs.

===Developments since 2025===
On 18 December 2024, it was announced that Air Europa will be launching a new service to Turkey. Flights between the route Istanbul and Madrid will commence beginning 12 May 2025, with initial four weekly flights and subsequently five weekly, operated on its Boeing 787-9 aircraft.

<doc id="507526" wikidata="Q6167985" url="?curid=507526" title="Winslow, Bainbridge Island, Washington">
<text>Winslow is the name of the downtown area of the city of Bainbridge Island, Washington, and is the original name of the city, named for shipbuilder Winslow Hall. It encompasses the area around the main street, Winslow Way, and is made up of approximately overlooking Eagle Harbor.

The city has occupied the entire space of Bainbridge Island since February 28, 1991, when the city of Winslow (incorporated on August 9, 1947), annexed the rest of the island after a narrowly passed November 1990 referendum. It officially remained the city of Winslow for several months, until November 7, 1991, at which time the city of Winslow was renamed the city of Bainbridge Island.

Winslow Way runs about ten city blocks, and is grounded on both sides by local businesses, including a bookstore, several galleries, and multiple restaurants and bakeries. A ferry terminal, with service to Seattle&#x27;s Colman Dock, boards at the east end of Winslow Way.

In 2010, the census block group in which Winslow is located had a median household income of $42,000, less than half of the Island&#x27;s median household income of $94,000 and one-third of several of the Island&#x27;s wealthiest block groups, and also $10,000 less than national and statewide averages. More than half of Winslow households live in rental units, compared to 20% of households across the Island. These differences have in some cases created tension between Winslow and the remainder of the Island, which were highlighted during the successful initiative to annex Winslow and the remainder of the Island into a new jurisdiction noted above.

<doc id="507532" wikidata="Q1402059" url="?curid=507532" title="Relative clause">
<text>A relative clause is a clause that modifies a noun or noun phrase and uses some grammatical device to indicate that one of the arguments in the relative clause refers to the noun or noun phrase. For example, in the sentence &quot;I met a man who wasn&#x27;t too sure of himself&quot;, the subordinate clause &quot;who wasn&#x27;t too sure of himself&quot; is a relative clause since it modifies the noun &quot;man&quot; and uses the pronoun &quot;who&quot; to indicate that the same &quot;man&quot; is referred to in the subordinate clause (in this case as its subject).

In many languages, relative clauses are introduced by a special class of pronouns called &quot;relative pronouns&quot;, such as &quot;who&quot; in the example just given. In other languages, relative clauses may be marked in different ways: they may be introduced by a special class of conjunctions called &quot;relativizers&quot;, the main verb of the relative clause may appear in a special morphological variant, or a relative clause may be indicated by word order alone. In some languages, more than one of these mechanisms may be possible.

==Types==

===Bound and free===
A bound relative clause, the type most often considered, qualifies an explicit element (usually a noun or noun phrase) appearing in the main clause, and refers back to that element by means of some explicit or implicit device within the relative clause.

The relative clause may also function as an &quot;embedded clause&quot; within a main (or higher-level) clause, thereby forming a &quot;matrix sentence&quot;. The noun in the main clause that the relative clause modifies is called the &quot;head noun&quot;, or (particularly when referred back to by a relative pronoun) the &quot;antecedent&quot;.

For example, in the English sentence &quot;The person whom I saw yesterday went home&quot;, the relative clause &quot;whom I saw yesterday&quot; modifies the head noun &quot;person&quot;, and the relative pronoun &quot;whom&quot; refers back to the referent of that noun. The sentence is equivalent to the following two sentences: &quot;I saw a person yesterday. The person went home&quot;. The shared argument need not fulfill the same role in both clauses; in this example the same person is referred to by the subject of the matrix clause, but the direct object of the relative clause.

A free relative clause (or fused relative), on the other hand, does not have an explicit antecedent external to itself. Instead, the relative clause itself takes the place of an argument in the matrix clause. For example, in the English sentence &quot;I like what I see&quot;, the clause &quot;what I see&quot; is a free relative clause, because it has no antecedent, but itself serves as the object of the verb &quot;like&quot; in the main clause. Alternatively, one could argue that the free relative clause has a zero as its antecedent. 

===Restrictive and non-restrictive===
Bound relative clauses may or may not be restrictive. A restrictive relative clause is a relative clause that functions as a restrictive modifier. A non-restrictive relative clause is a relative clause that is not a restrictive relative clause. Whereas a &quot;non-restrictive&quot; or &quot;non-defining&quot; relative clause merely provides supplementary information, a &quot;restrictive&quot; or &quot;defining&quot; relative clause modifies the meaning of its head word (restricts its possible referent). For example:
*&quot;The person who lives in this house has not been seen for days.&quot; This contains the restrictive relative clause &quot;who lives in this house&quot;, which modifies the meaning of &quot;person&quot; and is essential to the sentence. If this clause were omitted, it would no longer be known which person is being referred to, and the remaining part would not really make sense.
*&quot;The mayor, who lives in this house, has not been seen for days.&quot; This contains a non-restrictive relative clause since this provides supplementary information about the mayor but is not essential to the sentence. If this clause were omitted, it would still be known who is meant (the mayor), and the remaining part would still make sense.

In speaking, it is natural to make slight pauses around non-restrictive clauses, and in English this is shown in writing by commas (as in the examples). However, many languages distinguish the two types of relative clauses in this way only in speaking, not in writing. Another difference in English is that only restrictive relative clauses may be introduced with &quot;that&quot; or use the &quot;zero&quot; relative pronoun (see English relative clauses for details).

A non-restrictive relative clause may have a whole sentence as its antecedent rather than a specific noun phrase; for example:
*&quot;The cat was allowed on the bed, which annoyed the dog.&quot;
Here, &quot;which&quot; refers not to the bed or the cat but to the entire proposition expressed in the main clause, namely the situation of the cat being allowed on the bed.

==Formation methods==
Languages differ in many ways in how relative clauses are expressed:
#How the role of the shared noun phrase is indicated in the embedded clause.
#How the two clauses are joined together.
#Where the embedded clause is placed relative to the head noun (in the process indicating which noun phrase in the main clause is modified).

For example, the English sentence &quot;The person that I saw yesterday went home&quot; can be described as follows:
#The role of the shared noun in the embedded clause is indicated by &quot;gapping&quot;; that is, a gap is left in the object position after &quot;saw&quot;, implying that the shared noun phrase (&quot;the person&quot;) is to be understood to fill that gap and to serve as the object of the verb &quot;saw&quot;.
#The clauses are joined by the &quot;complementizer&quot; &quot;that&quot;.
#The embedded clause is placed &quot;after&quot; the head noun &quot;the person&quot;.

The following sentences indicate various possibilities (only some of which are grammatical in English):
*&quot;The person [that I saw yesterday] went home&quot;. (A &quot;complementizer&quot; linking the two clauses with a &quot;gapping&quot; strategy indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause. One possibility in English. Very common cross-linguistically.)
*&quot;The person [I saw yesterday] went home&quot;. (Gapping strategy, with no word joining the clauses—also known as a reduced relative clause. One possibility in English. Used in Arabic when the head noun is indefinite, as in &quot;a person&quot; instead of &quot;the person&quot;.)
*&quot;The person [whom I saw yesterday] went home&quot;. (A relative pronoun indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause—in this case, the direct object. Used in formal English, as in Latin, German or Russian.)
*&quot;The person [seen by me yesterday] went home&quot;. (A reduced relative clause, in this case passivized. One possibility in English.)
*&quot;The person [that I saw him yesterday] went home&quot;. (A complementizer linking the two sentences with a resumptive pronoun indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause, as in Arabic, Hebrew or Persian.)
*&quot;The person [that him I saw yesterday] went home&quot;. (Similar to the previous, but with the resumptive pronoun fronted. This occurs in modern Greek and as one possibility in modern Hebrew; the combination &quot;that him&quot; of complementizer and resumptive pronoun behaves similarly to a unitary relative pronoun.)
*&quot;The [I saw yesterday]&#x27;s person went home&quot;. (Preceding relative clause with gapping and use of a possessive particle—as normally used in a genitive construction—to link the relative clause to the head noun, as in Chinese.)
*&quot;The [yesterday I seeing]&#x27;s person went home&quot;. (Preceding relative clause with gapping, and Nominalized the final verb, then use of a possessive particle—as normally used in a genitive construction—to link the relative clause to the head noun. This occurs in many Sino-Tibetan languages and possibly developed from &quot;relative clause + noun&quot; &gt; &quot;nominalized clause + noun&quot; &gt; &quot;genitive construction&quot;., as in Tibetan.)
*&quot;The [I saw yesterday] person went home&quot;. (Preceding relative clause with gapping and no linking word, as in Japanese or Mongolian.)
*&quot;The person [of my seeing yesterday] went home&quot;. (Nominalized relative clause, as in Turkish.)
*&quot;[Which person I saw yesterday], that person went home&quot;. (A &quot;correlative&quot; structure, as in Hindi.)
*&quot;[I saw the person yesterday] went home.&quot; (An &quot;unreduced, internally headed&quot; relative clause, as in Navajo.)

===Strategies for indicating the role of the shared noun in the relative clause===
There are four main strategies for indicating the role of the shared noun phrase in the embedded clause. These are typically listed in order of the degree to which the noun in the relative clause has been reduced, from most to least:

# Gap strategy or gapped relative clause
# Relative pronoun
# Pronoun retention
# Nonreduction

====Gapped relative clause====
In this strategy, there is simply a gap in the relative clause where the shared noun would go. This is normal in English, for example, and also in Chinese and Japanese. This is the most common type of relative clause, especially in verb-final languages with prenominal relative clauses, but is also widespread among languages with postnominal externally headed relative clauses.

There may or may not be any marker used to join the relative and main clauses. (Languages with a case-marked relative pronoun are technically not considered to employ the gapping strategy even though they do in fact have a gap, since the case of the relative pronoun indicates the role of the shared noun.) Often the form of the verb is different from that in main clauses and is to some degree nominalized, as in Turkish and in English reduced relative clauses.

In non-verb-final languages, apart from languages like Thai and Vietnamese with very strong politeness distinctions in their grammars, gapped relative clauses tend, however, to be restricted to positions high up in the accessibility hierarchy. With obliques and genitives, non-verb-final languages that do not have politeness restrictions on pronoun use tend to use pronoun retention. English is unusual in that &quot;all&quot; roles in the embedded clause can be indicated by gapping: e.g. &quot;I saw the person who is my friend&quot;, but also (in progressively less accessible positions cross-linguistically, according to the &quot;accessibility hierarchy&quot; described below) &quot;... who I know&quot;, &quot;... who I gave a book to&quot;, &quot;... who I spoke with&quot;, &quot;... who I run slower than&quot;. Usually, languages with gapping disallow it beyond a certain level in the accessibility hierarchy, and switch to a different strategy at this point. Classical Arabic, for example, only allows gapping in the subject and sometimes the direct object; beyond that, a resumptive pronoun must be used. Some languages have no allowed strategies at all past a certain point—e.g. in many Austronesian languages, such as Tagalog, all relative clauses must have the shared noun serving the subject role in the embedded clause. In these languages, relative clauses with shared nouns serving &quot;disallowed&quot; roles can be expressed by passivizing the embedded sentence, thereby moving the noun in the embedded sentence into the subject position. This, for example, would transform &quot;The person who I gave a book to&quot; into &quot;The person who was given a book by me&quot;. Generally, languages such as this &quot;conspire&quot; to implement general relativization by allowing passivization from &quot;all&quot; positions — hence a sentence equivalent to &quot;The person who is run slower than by me&quot; is grammatical. Gapping is often used in conjunction with case-marked relative pronouns (since the relative pronoun indicates the case role in the embedded clause), but this is not necessary (e.g. Chinese and Japanese both using gapping in conjunction with an indeclinable complementizer).

====Relative pronoun type====
This is a type of gapped relative clause, but is distinguished by the fact that the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause is indicated indirectly by the case marking of the marker (the relative pronoun) used to join the main and embedded clauses. All languages which use relative pronouns have them in clause-initial position: though one could conceivably imagine a clause-final relative pronoun analogous to an adverbial subordinator in that position, they are unknown.

Some languages have what are described as &quot;relative pronouns&quot; (in that they agree with some properties of the head noun, such as number and gender) but which do not actually indicate the case role of the shared noun in the embedded clause. Classical Arabic has &quot;relative pronouns&quot; which are case-marked, but which agree in case with the &quot;head&quot; noun. Case-marked relative pronouns in the strict sense are almost entirely confined to European languages, where they are widespread except among the Celtic family and Indo-Aryan family. The influence of Spanish has led to their adaption by a very small number of Native American languages, of which the best known are the Keresan languages.

====Pronoun retention type====
In this type, the position relativized is indicated by means of a personal pronoun in the same syntactic position as would ordinarily be occupied by a noun phrase of that type in the main clause—known as a &quot;resumptive pronoun&quot;. It is equivalent to saying &quot;The woman who I saw her yesterday went home&quot;. Pronoun retention is very frequently used for relativization of inaccessible positions on the accessibility hierarchy. In Persian and Classical Arabic, for example, resumptive pronouns are required when the embedded role is other than the subject or direct object, and optional in the case of the direct object. Resumptive pronouns are common in non-verb-final languages of Africa and Asia, and also used by the Celtic languages of northwest Europe and Romanian (&quot;Omul pe care l-am văzut ieri a mers acasă&quot;/&quot;The man who I saw him yesterday went home&quot;). They also occur in deeply embedded positions in English, as in &quot;That&#x27;s the girl that I don&#x27;t know what she did&quot;, although this is sometimes considered non-standard.

Only a very small number of languages, of which the best known is Yoruba, have pronoun retention as their sole grammatical type of relative clause.

====Nonreduction type====
In the nonreduction type, unlike the other three, the shared noun occurs as a &quot;full-fledged noun phrase&quot; in the embedded clause, which has the form of a full independent clause. Typically, it is the head noun in the main clause that is reduced or missing. Some languages use relative clauses of this type with the normal strategy of embedding the relative clause next to the head noun. These languages are said to have &quot;internally headed&quot; relative clauses, which would be similar to the (ungrammatical) English structure &quot;[You see the girl over there] is my friend&quot; or &quot;I took [you see the girl over there] out on a date&quot;. This is used, for example, in Navajo, which uses a special relative verb (as with some other Native American languages).

A second strategy is the &quot;correlative&quot;-clause strategy used by Hindi and other Indo-Aryan languages, as well as Bambara. This strategy is equivalent to saying &quot;Which girl you see over there, she is my daughter&quot; or &quot;Which knife I killed my friend with, the police found that knife&quot;. It is &quot;correlative&quot; because of the corresponding &quot;which ... that ...&quot; demonstratives or &quot;which ... she/he/it ...&quot; pronouns, which indicate the respective nouns being equated. The shared noun can either be repeated entirely in the main clause or reduced to a pronoun. There is no need to front the shared noun in such a sentence. For example, in the second example above, Hindi would actually say something equivalent to &quot;I killed my friend with which knife, the police found that knife&quot;.

Dialects of some European languages, such as Italian, do use the nonreduction type in forms that could be glossed in English as &quot;The person just passed us by, she introduced me to the chancellor here.&quot;

In general, however, nonreduction is restricted to verb-final languages, though it is more common among those that are head-marking.

===Strategies for joining the relative clause to the main clause===
The following are some of the common strategies for joining the two clauses:
*Use of an indeclinable particle (specifically, a relativizer) inserted into the sentence, placed next to the modified noun; the embedded clause is likewise inserted into the appropriate position, typically placed on the other side of the complementizer. This strategy is very common and arguably occurs in English with the word &quot;that&quot; (&quot;the woman that I saw&quot;), though this interpretation of &quot;that&quot; as something other than a relative pronoun is controversial (see below). In the modern varieties of Arabic (using &quot;illi&quot; placed after the modified noun); in Chinese (using &quot;de&quot; placed before the modified noun).
*Use of a relative pronoun. Prototypically, a relative pronoun agrees with the head noun in gender, number, definiteness, animacy, etc., but adopts the case that the shared noun assumes in the &quot;embedded&quot;, not matrix, clause. This is the case in a number of conservative European languages, such as Latin, German and Russian. Many languages also have similar linking words commonly termed &quot;relative pronouns&quot; that agree in some way with the head noun, but do not adopt the case role of the embedded clause. In English, for example, the use of &quot;who&quot; vs. &quot;which&quot; agrees with the animacy of the head noun, but there is no case agreement except in the formal English contrast &quot;who&quot; vs. &quot;whom&quot;. Similarly, in Classical Arabic, there is a relative pronoun that agrees in number, gender, definiteness &quot;and&quot; case with the head noun (rather than taking the case role of the noun in the embedded clause). Languages with prototypical relative pronouns typically use the gapping strategy for indicating the role in the embedded clause, since the relative pronoun itself indicates the role by its case. (Classical Arabic, where the case marking indicates something else, uses a resumptive pronoun.) Some linguists prefer to use the term &quot;relative pronoun&quot; only for the prototypical cases (but in this case it is unclear what to call the non-prototypical cases).
*Directly inserting the embedded clause in the matrix clause at the appropriate position, with no word used to join them. This is common, for example, in English (cf. &quot;The person I saw yesterday went home&quot;), and is used in Classical Arabic in relative clauses that modify indefinite nouns.
*By nominalizing the relative clause (e.g. converting it to a participial construction). Generally, no relative pronoun or complementizer is used. This occurs, for example, in reduced relative clauses in English (e.g. &quot;The person seen by me yesterday went home&quot; or &quot;The person planning to go home soon is my friend&quot;). Formal German makes common use of such participial relative clauses, which can become extremely long. This is also the normal strategy in Turkish, which has sentences equivalent to &quot;I ate the potato of Hasan&#x27;s giving to Sina&quot; (in place of &quot;I ate the potato that Hasan gave to Sina&quot;). This can be viewed as a situation in which the &quot;complementizer&quot; is attached to the verb of the embedded clause (e.g. in English, &quot;-ing&quot; or &quot;-ed&quot; can be viewed as a type of complementizer).

===Position of the head noun with respect to the relative clause===
The positioning of a relative clause before or after a head noun is related to the more general concept of branching in linguistics. Languages that place relative clauses after their head noun (so-called &quot;head-initial&quot; or &quot;VO&quot; languages) generally also have adjectives and genitive modifiers following the head noun, as well as verbs preceding their objects. French, Spanish and Arabic are prototypical languages of this sort. Languages that place relative clauses before their head noun (so-called &quot;head-final&quot; or &quot;OV&quot; languages) generally also have adjectives and genitive modifiers preceding the head noun, as well as verbs following their objects. Turkish and Japanese are prototypical languages of this sort. Not all languages fit so easily into these categories. English, for example, is generally head-first, but has adjectives preceding their head nouns, and genitive constructions with both preceding and following modifiers (&quot;the friend of my father&quot; vs. &quot;my father&#x27;s friend&quot;). Chinese has the &quot;VO&quot; order, with verb preceding object, but otherwise is generally head-final.

Various possibilities for ordering are:
*Relative clause following the head noun, as in English, French or Arabic.
*Relative clause preceding the head noun, as in Turkish, Japanese, or Chinese.
*Head noun &quot;within&quot; the relative clause (an &quot;internally headed&quot; relative clause). An example of such a language is Navajo. These languages are said to have nonreduced relative clauses. These languages have a structure equivalent to &quot;[I saw the person yesterday] went home&quot;.
*Adjoined relative clause. These languages have the relative clause completely outside the main clause, and use a correlative structure to link the two. These languages also have nonreduced relative clauses. Hindi, the most well-known such language, has a structure similar to &quot;Which person I saw yesterday, that person went home&quot; or (without fronting of the relativized noun in the relative clause) &quot;I saw which person yesterday, that person went home&quot;. Another example is Warlpiri, which constructs relative clauses of a form similar to &quot;I saw the man yesterday, which he was going home&quot;. However, it is sometimes said these languages have no relative clauses at all, since the sentences of this form can equally well translate as &quot;I saw the man who was going home yesterday&quot; or &quot;I saw the man yesterday when/while he was going home&quot;.

==Accessibility hierarchy==
The antecedent of the relative clause (that is, the noun that is modified by it) can in theory be the subject of the main clause, or its object, or any other verb argument. In many languages, however, especially rigidly left-branching, dependent-marking languages with prenominal relative clauses, there are major restrictions on the role the antecedent may have &quot;in the relative clause&quot;.

Edward Keenan and Bernard Comrie noted that these roles can be ranked cross-linguistically in the following order from most accessible to least accessible:

:Subject &gt; Direct Object &gt; Indirect Object &gt; Oblique &gt; Genitive &gt; Object of comparative

Ergative–absolutive languages have a similar hierarchy:

:Absolutive &gt; Ergative &gt; Indirect Object &gt; etc. (same as above)

This order is called the accessibility hierarchy. If a language can relativize positions lower in the accessibility hierarchy, it can always relativize positions higher up, but not vice versa. For example, Malagasy can relativize only subject and Chukchi only absolutive arguments, whilst Basque can relativize absolutives, ergatives and indirect objects, but not obliques or genitives or objects of comparatives. Similar hierarchies have been proposed in other circumstances, e.g. for pronominal reflexes.

English can relativize all positions in the hierarchy. Here are some examples of the NP and relative clause usage from English:

Some other examples:

Languages that cannot relativize directly on noun phrases low in the accessibility hierarchy can sometimes use alternative voices to &quot;raise&quot; the relevant noun phrase so that it can be relativized. The most common example is the use of applicative voices to relativize obliques, but in such languages as Chukchi antipassives are used to raise ergative arguments to absolutive.

For example, a language that can relativize only subjects could say this:
*The girl [who likes me] came to visit.
But not:
*The girl [whom I like] came to visit.
*The girl [whom I gave a rose to] came to visit.
*The girl [whom I watched a movie with] came to visit.
*The girl [whose father I know] came to visit.
*The girl [whom I know the father of] came to visit. (&quot;equivalent to previous&quot;)
*The girl [whom I am taller than] came to visit.
These languages might form an equivalent sentence by passivization:
*The girl [who was liked by me] came to visit.
*The girl [who was given a rose by me] came to visit.
*The girl [who was watched a movie with by me] came to visit.
*The girl [who was known the father of by me] came to visit.
*The girl [who was been taller than by me] came to visit.
These passivized sentences get progressively more ungrammatical in English as they move down the accessibility hierarchy; the last two, in particular, are so ungrammatical as to be almost unparsable by English speakers. But languages with severe restrictions on which roles can be relativized are precisely those that can passivize almost any position, and hence the last two sentences would be normal in those languages.

A further example is languages that can relativize only subjects and direct objects. Hence the following would be possible:
*The girl [who I like] came to visit.
The other ungrammatical examples above would still be ungrammatical. These languages often allow an oblique object to be moved to the direct object slot by the use of the so-called &quot;applicative voice&quot;, much as the passive voice moves an oblique object to the subject position. The above examples expressed in an applicative voice might be similar to the following (in not necessarily grammatical English):
*The girl [who I gave a rose] came to visit.
*The girl [who I with-watched a movie] came to visit.
*The girl [who I (of-)know the father] came to visit.
*The girl [who I out-tall] came to visit.

Modern grammars may use the accessibility hierarchy to order productions—e.g. in Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar the hierarchy corresponds to the order of elements on the &quot;subcat&quot; list, and interacts with other principles in explanations of binding facts. The hierarchy also figures in
Lexical Functional Grammar, where it is known as Syntactic Rank or the Relational Hierarchy.

==Examples==

===Indo-European languages===

====English====

In English, a relative clause follows the noun it modifies. It is generally indicated by a relative pronoun at the start of the clause, although sometimes simply by word order. If the relative pronoun is the object of the verb in the relative clause, it comes at the beginning of the clause even though it would come at the end of an independent clause (&quot;She is the woman &quot;whom&quot; I saw&quot;, not &quot;She is the woman I saw &quot;whom&quot;&quot;).

The choice of relative pronoun can be affected by whether the clause modifies a human or non-human noun, by whether the clause is restrictive or not, and by the role (subject, direct object, or the like) of the relative pronoun in the relative clause.

*For a human antecedent, &quot;who&quot;, &quot;whom&quot;, or &quot;that&quot; is usually used (&quot;She is the person &quot;who&quot; saw me&quot;, &quot;He is the person &quot;whom&quot; I saw&quot;, &quot;He is the person &quot;that&quot; I saw&quot;). For a non-human antecedent, only &quot;that&quot; or &quot;which&quot; is used.
*For a non-human antecedent in a non-restrictive clause, only &quot;which&quot; is used (&quot;The tree, &quot;which&quot; fell, is over there&quot;); while either &quot;which&quot; or &quot;that&quot; may be used in a restrictive clause (&quot;The tree &quot;which&quot; fell is over there&quot;, &quot;The tree &quot;that&quot; fell is over there&quot;)but some styles and prescriptive grammars require the use of &quot;that&quot; in the restrictive context.
*Of the relative pronoun pair &quot;who&quot; and &quot;whom&quot;, the &quot;subjective&quot; case form (&quot;who&quot;) is used if it is the subject of the relative clause (&quot;She is the police officer who saw me&quot;); and, in formal usage, the &quot;objective&quot; case form (&quot;whom&quot;) if it is the object of the verb or preposition in the relative clause (&quot;She is the police officer whom I saw&quot;, &quot;She is the police officer whom I talked to&quot;, &quot;She is the officer to whom I talked&quot;); but in informal usage &quot;whom&quot; is often replaced by &quot;who&quot;.

In English, as in some other languages (such as French; see below), non-restrictive relative clauses are set off with commas, but restrictive ones are not:

*&quot;I met a woman and a man yesterday. The woman, &quot;who had a thick French accent&quot;, was very tall.&quot; (non-restrictive—does not narrow down who is being talked about)
*&quot;I met two women yesterday, one with a thick French accent and one with a mild Italian one. The woman &quot;who had the thick French accent&quot; was very tall.&quot; (restrictive—adds information about who is being referred to)

The status of &quot;that&quot; as a relative pronoun is not universally agreed. Traditional grammars treat &quot;that&quot; as a relative pronoun, but not all contemporary grammars do: e.g. the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language (pp. 1056–7) makes a case for treating &quot;that&quot; as a subordinator instead of a relative pronoun; and the British National Corpus treats &quot;that&quot; as a subordinating conjunction even when it introduces relative clauses. One motivation for the different treatment of &quot;that&quot; is that there are differences between &quot;that&quot; and &quot;which&quot; (e.g., one can say &quot;in which&quot; but not &quot;in that&quot;, etc.).

====French====
The system of relative pronouns in French is as complicated as, but similar in many ways to, the system in English.

When the pronoun is to act as the direct object of the relative clause, &#x27; is generally used, although &#x27;, which is inflected for grammatical gender and number, is sometimes used in order to give more precision. For example, any of the following is correct and would translate to &quot;I talked to his/her father and mother, whom I already knew&quot;:
:&quot;

However, in the first sentence, &quot;whom I already knew&quot; refers only to the mother; in the second, it refers to both parents; and in the third, as in the English sentence, it could refer either only to the mother, or to both parents.

When the pronoun is to act as the subject of the relative clause, &#x27; is generally used, though as before, &#x27; may be used instead for greater precision. (This is less common than the use of &quot;&quot; with direct objects, however, since verbs in French often reflect the grammatical number of their subjects.)

Contrary to English, the relative pronoun can never be omitted in French, not even when the relative clause is embedded in another relative clause.
:Here is what I think Ø happened.
:&#x27; (literally: &quot;Here is what I think that happened.&quot;)

When the pronoun is to act in a possessive sense, where the preposition &quot;de&quot; (of/from) would normally be used, the pronoun &quot;&quot; (&quot;whose&quot;) is used, but does not act as a determiner for the noun &quot;possessed&quot;:

:&quot;&quot; (&quot;I spoke with a woman whose son I work with.&quot; - &quot;lit.&quot;, &quot;I spoke with a woman &quot;of whom&quot; the son is my colleague.&quot;)

This construction is also used in non-possessive cases where the pronoun replaces an object marked by &quot;&quot;:

:&#x27; (&quot;That&#x27;s the man of whom I spoke.&quot;)

More generally, in modern French, &quot;&quot; can signal the topic of the following clause, without replacing anything in this clause:

:&#x27; (&quot;That&#x27;s a man about whom I believe that he must make a lot of money.&quot;)

When the pronoun is to act as the object of a preposition (other than when &#x27; is used), &#x27; is generally used, though &quot;&quot; can be used if the antecedent is human.

:&#x27; (&quot;These are people that can be depended on.&quot;) [literally: &quot;on whom one can depend&quot;]

:&#x27; (&quot;This is a table on which you can put a lot of things&quot;.)
:*&quot;C&#x27;est une table sur qui on peut mettre beaucoup de choses.&quot;

There exists a further complication when the antecedent is a non-human indefinite pronoun. In that case, &#x27; cannot be used because it must agree in gender with its head, and an indefinite pronoun has no gender. Instead, &#x27;, which usually means &quot;what&quot;, is used.
:&#x27; (&quot;This is obviously something that he has thought a lot about .&quot;)
:*&quot;C&#x27;est manifestement quelque chose à laquelle il a beaucoup réfléchi.&quot;

The same happens when the antecedent is an entire clause, also lacking gender.
:&#x27; (&quot;He told me to get lost, to which I replied that ...&quot;)

The preposition always appears before the pronoun, and the prepositions &#x27; and &#x27; (at/to) contract with &#x27; to form &#x27; and &#x27;, or with &#x27; to form &#x27; and &#x27;.

====German====
Aside from their highly inflected forms, German relative pronouns are less complicated than English. There are two varieties. The more common one is based on the definite article &quot;der&quot;, &quot;die&quot;, &quot;das&quot;, but with distinctive forms in the genitive (&quot;dessen&quot;, &quot;deren&quot;) and in the dative plural (&quot;denen&quot;). Historically this is related to English &quot;that&quot;. The second, which is more literary and used for emphasis, is the relative use of &quot;welcher&quot;, &quot;welche&quot;, &quot;welches&quot;, comparable with English &quot;which&quot;. As in most Germanic languages, including Old English, both of these varieties inflect according to gender, case and number. They take their gender and number from the noun which they modify, but the case from their function in their own clause.

:&quot;Das Haus, in dem ich wohne, ist sehr alt.&quot;
::The house in which I live is very old.

The relative pronoun &quot;dem&quot; is neuter singular to agree with &quot;Haus&quot;, but dative because it follows a preposition in its own clause. On the same basis, it would be possible to substitute the pronoun &quot;welchem&quot;.

However, German uses the uninflecting &quot;was&quot; (&#x27;what&#x27;) as a relative pronoun when the antecedent is &quot;alles&quot;, &quot;etwas&quot; or &quot;nichts&quot; (&#x27;everything&#x27;, &#x27;something&#x27;, &#x27;nothing&#x27;).

:&quot;Alles, was Jack macht, gelingt ihm.&quot;
::Everything that Jack does is a success.

In German, all relative clauses are marked with commas.

Alternatively, particularly in formal registers, participles (both active and passive) can be used to embed relative clauses in adjectival phrases:

:&quot;Die von ihm in jenem Stil gemalten Bilder sind sehr begehrt&quot;
::The pictures he painted in that style are highly sought after
:&quot;Die Regierung möchte diese im letzten Jahr eher langsam wachsende Industrie weiter fördern&quot;
::The government would like to further promote this industry, which has grown rather slowly over the last year.

Unlike English, which only permits relatively small participle phrases in adjectival positions (typically just the participle and adverbs), and disallows the use of direct objects for active participles, German sentences of this sort can embed clauses of arbitrary complexity.

====Spanish====
====Latin====
In Latin, relative clauses follow the noun phrases they modify, and are always introduced using relative pronouns. Relative pronouns, like other pronouns in Latin, agree with their antecedents in gender and number, but not in case: a relative pronoun&#x27;s case reflects its role in the relative clause it introduces, while its antecedent&#x27;s case reflects the antecedent&#x27;s role in the clause that contains the relative clause. (Nonetheless, it is possible for the pronoun and antecedent to be in the same case.) For example:

:&quot;Urbēs, quae sunt magnae, videntur. (&quot;The cities, which are large, are being seen.&quot;)
:&quot;Urbēs, quās vīdī, erant magnae.&quot; (&quot;The cities, which I saw, were large.&quot;)

In the former example, &quot;urbēs&quot; and &quot;quae&quot; both function as subjects in their respective clauses, so both are in the nominative case; and due to gender and number agreement, both are feminine and plural. In the latter example, both are still feminine and plural, and &quot;urbēs&quot; is still in the nominative case, but &quot;quae&quot; has been replaced by &quot;quās&quot;, its accusative-case counterpart, to reflect its role as the direct object of &quot;vīdī&quot;.

For more information on the forms of Latin relative pronouns, &quot;see&quot; the section on relative pronouns in the article on Latin declension.

====Ancient Greek====
Ancient Greek follows (almost) the same rules as Latin.

However, there is a phenomenon in Ancient Greek called &quot;case attraction&quot;, where the case of the relative pronoun can be &quot;attracted&quot; to the case of its antecedent.

In this example, although the relative pronoun should be in the accusative case, as the object of &quot;obtain&quot;, it is attracted to the genitive case of its antecedent (&quot;of the freedom...&quot;).

The Ancient Greek relative pronoun ὅς, ἥ, ὅ (&quot;hós, hḗ, hó&quot;) is unrelated to the Latin word, since it derives from Proto-Indo-European : in Proto-Greek, &quot;y&quot; before a vowel usually changed to &quot;h&quot; (debuccalization). Cognates include Sanskrit relative pronouns &quot;yas, yā, yad&quot; (where &quot;o&quot; changed to short &quot;a&quot;).

The Greek definite article ὁ, ἡ, τό (&quot;ho, hē, tó&quot;) has a different origin, since it is related to the Sanskrit demonstrative &quot;sa, sā&quot; and Latin &quot;is-tud&quot;.

Information that in English would be encoded with relative clauses could be represented with complex participles in Ancient Greek. This was made particularly expressive by the rich suite of participles available, with active and passive participles in present, past and future tenses. This is called the attributive participle.

====Serbo-Croatian====
Serbo-Croatian uses exactly the same principle as Latin does. The following sentences are the Latin examples translated to Serbo-Croatian (the same sentences apply to the Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin standard variants of the pluricentric language):

In the first sentence, &quot;koji&quot; is in the nominative, and in the second &quot;koje&quot; is in the accusative. Both words are two case forms of the same relative pronoun, that is inflicted for gender (here: masculine), number (here: plural), and case.

An alternative relativizing strategy is the use of the non-declinable word &quot;što&quot; &#x27;that&#x27; to introduce a relative clause. This word is used together with a resumptive pronoun, i.e. a personal pronoun that agrees in gender and number with the antecedent, while its case form depends on its function in the relative clause. The resumptive pronoun never appears in subject function.

Relative clauses are relatively frequent in modern Serbo-Croatian since they have expanded as attributes at the expense of the participles performing that function. The most frequently used relative pronoun is &quot;koji&quot;. There are several ongoing changes concerning &quot;koji&quot;. One of them is the spread of the genitive-accusative syncretism to the masculine inanimate of the pronoun. The cause lies in the necessity to disambiguate the subject and the object by morphological means. The nominative-accusative syncretism of the form &quot;koji&quot; is inadequate, so the genitive form &quot;kojeg&quot; is preferred:

====Celtic languages====

The Celtic languages (at least the modern Insular Celtic languages) distinguish two types of relative clause: direct relative clauses and indirect relative clauses. A direct relative clause is used where the relativized element is the subject or the direct object of its clause (e.g. &quot;the man &quot;who&quot; saw me&quot;, &quot;the man &quot;whom&quot; I saw&quot;), while an indirect relative clause is used where the relativized element is a genitival (e.g. &quot;the man &quot;whose&quot; daughter is in the hospital&quot;) or is the object of a preposition (e.g. &quot;the man &quot;to whom&quot; I gave the book&quot;). Direct relative clauses are formed with a relative pronoun (unmarked for case) at the beginning; a gap (in terms of syntactic theory, a trace, indicated by (&quot;t)&quot; in the examples below) is left in the relative clause at the pronoun&#x27;s expected position.

;Irish
;Welsh
The direct relative particle &quot;a&quot; is not used with &quot;mae&quot; (&quot;is&quot;) in Welsh; instead the form &quot;sydd&quot; or &quot;sy&#x27;&quot; is used:

There is also a defective verb &quot;piau&quot; (usually lenited to &quot;biau&quot;), corresponding to &quot;who own(s)&quot;:

Indirect relative clauses are formed with a relativizer at the beginning; the relativized element remains &quot;in situ&quot; in the relative clause.

;Irish

;Welsh
Although both the Irish relative pronoun and the relativizer are &#x27;a&#x27;, the relative pronoun triggers lenition of a following consonant, while the relativizer triggers eclipsis (see Irish initial mutations).

Both direct and indirect relative particles can be used simply for emphasis, often in answer to a question or as a way of disagreeing with a statement. For instance, the Welsh example above, &quot;y dyn a welais&quot; means not only &quot;the man whom I saw&quot;, but also &quot;it was the man (and not anyone else) I saw&quot;; and &quot;y dyn y rhois y llyfr iddo&quot; can likewise mean &quot;it was the man (and not anyone else) to whom I gave the book&quot;.

===Semitic languages===

====Hebrew====
In Biblical Hebrew, relative clauses were headed with the word &quot;asher&quot;, which could be either a relative pronoun or a relativizer. In later times, &quot;asher&quot; became interchangeable with the prefix &quot;she-&quot; (which is also used as a conjunction, with the sense of English &quot;that&quot;), and in Modern Hebrew, this use of &quot;she-&quot; is much more common than &quot;asher&quot;, except in some formal, archaic, or poetic writing. In meaning, the two are interchangeable; they are used regardless of whether the clause is modifying a human, regardless of their grammatical case in the relative clause, and regardless of whether the clause is restrictive.

Further, because Hebrew does not generally use its word for &quot;is&quot;, &quot;she-&quot; is used to distinguish adjective phrases used in epithet from adjective phrases used in attribution:

:&quot;Ha-kise l&#x27;-yad-ekh.&quot; (&quot;The chair is next to you.&quot; - &quot;lit.&quot;, &quot;The-chair [is] next-to-you.&quot;)
:&quot;Ha-kise she-l&#x27;-yad-ekh shavur.&quot; (&quot;The chair next to you is broken.&quot;—&quot;lit.&quot;, &quot;The-chair that-[is]-next-to-you [is] broken.&quot;)

(This use of &quot;she-&quot; does not occur with simple adjectives, as Hebrew has a different way of making that distinction. For example, &quot;Ha-kise adom&quot; means &quot;The chair [is] red&quot;, while &quot;Ha-kis&#x27;e ha-adom shavur&quot; means &quot;The red chair is broken&quot;—literally, &quot;The chair the red [is] broken.&quot;)

Since 1994, the official rules of Modern Hebrew (as determined by the Academy of the Hebrew Language) have stated that relative clauses are to be punctuated in Hebrew the same way as in English (described above). That is, non-restrictive clauses are to be set off with commas, while restrictive clauses are not:

:&quot;Ha-kise, she-at yoshevet alav, shavur.&quot; (&quot;The chair, which you are sitting on, is broken.&quot;)
:&quot;Ha-kise she-at yoshevet alav shavur.&quot; (&quot;The chair that you are sitting on is broken.&quot;)

Nonetheless, many speakers of Modern Hebrew still use the pre-1994 rules, which were based on the German rules (described above). Except for the simple adjective-phrase clauses described above, these speakers set off all relative clauses, restrictive or not, with commas:

:&quot;Ha-kise, she-at yoshevet alav, shavur.&quot; (&quot;The chair that you are sitting on is broken,&quot; &quot;or&quot; &quot;The chair, which you are sitting on, is broken.&quot;)

One major difference between relative clauses in Hebrew and those in (for example) English is that in Hebrew, what might be called the &quot;regular&quot; pronoun is not always suppressed in the relative clause. To reuse the prior example:

:&quot;Ha-kise, she-at yoshevet alav, shavur.&quot; (&quot;lit.&quot;, &quot;The chair, which you are sitting on it, [is] broken.&quot;)

More specifically, if this pronoun is the subject of the relative clause, it is always suppressed. If it is the direct object, then it is usually suppressed, though it is also correct to leave it in. (If it is suppressed, then the special preposition &quot;et&quot;, used to mark the direct object, is suppressed as well.) If it is the object of a preposition, it must be left in, because in Hebrew—unlike in English—a preposition cannot appear without its object. When the pronoun is left in, &quot;she-&quot; might more properly be called a relativizer than a relative pronoun.

The Hebrew relativizer &quot;she-&quot; &#x27;that&#x27; &quot;might be a shortened form of the Hebrew relativizer &quot;‘asher&quot; &#x27;that&#x27;, which is related to Akkadian &quot;‘ashru&quot; &#x27;place&#x27; (cf. Semitic *&quot;‘athar&quot;). Alternatively, Hebrew &quot;‘asher&quot; derived from &quot;she-&quot;, or it was a convergence of Proto-Semitic &quot;dhu&quot; (cf. Aramaic &quot;dī&quot;) and &quot;‘asher&quot; [...] Whereas Israeli &quot;she-&quot; functions both as complementizer and relativizer, &quot;ashér&quot; can only function as a relativize.&quot;

====Arabic====

=====Literary Arabic=====
In Modern Standard and Classical Arabic there is a relative pronoun (in Arabic: ) &quot;allaḏī&quot; (masculine singular), feminine singular &quot;allatī&quot;, masculine plural &quot;allaḏīna&quot;, feminine plural &quot;allawātī&quot;, masculine dual &quot;allaḏānī&quot; (nominative) / &quot;allaḏayni&quot; (accusative and genitive), feminine dual &quot;allatānī&quot; (nom.) / &quot;allataynī&quot; (acc. and gen.).

Its usage has two specific rules: it agrees with the antecedent in gender, number and case, and it is used only if the antecedent is definite. If the antecedent is indefinite, no relative pronoun is used. The former is called &quot;jumlat sila&quot; (conjunctive sentence) while the latter is called &quot;jumlat sifa&quot; (descriptive sentence).

=====Colloquial Arabic=====
In Colloquial Arabic the multiple forms of the relative pronoun have been levelled in favour of a single form, a simple conjunction, which in most dialects is &quot;illi&quot;, and is never omitted. So in Palestinian Arabic the above sentences would be:

* &quot;alwalad illi shuftō fi (a)ssaff embārih ghāyeb alyōm&quot;
* &quot;hāda walad illi shuftō fi (a)ssaff embārih&quot;

As in Hebrew, the regular pronoun referring to the antecedent is repeated in the relative clause - literally, &quot;the boy whom I saw him in class...&quot; (the &quot;-hu&quot; in &quot;ra&#x27;aituhu&quot; and the &quot;-ō&quot; in &quot;shuftō&quot;). The rules of suppression in Arabic are identical to those of Hebrew: obligatory suppression in the case that the pronoun is the subject of the relative clause, obligatory retention in the case that the pronoun is the object of a preposition, and at the discretion of the speaker if the pronoun is the direct object. The only difference from Hebrew is that, in the case of the direct object, it is preferable to retain the pronoun rather than suppress it.

===Japonic languages===

====Japanese====
Japanese does not employ relative pronouns to relate relative clauses to their antecedents. Instead, the relative clause directly modifies the noun phrase as an attributive verb, occupying the same syntactic space as an attributive adjective (before the noun phrase).



In fact, since so-called &quot;i-adjectives&quot; in Japanese can be analyzed as intransitive stative verbs, it can be argued that the structure of the first example (with an adjective) is the same as the others. A number of &quot;adjectival&quot; meanings, in Japanese, are customarily shown with relative clauses consisting solely of a verb or a verb complex:

Often confusing to speakers of languages which use relative pronouns are relative clauses which would in their own languages require a preposition with the pronoun to indicate the semantic relationship among the constituent parts of the phrase.

Here, the preposition &quot;in&quot; is missing from the Japanese (&quot;missing&quot; in the sense that the corresponding postposition would be used with the main clause verb in Japanese). Common sense indicates what the meaning is in this case, but the &quot;missing preposition&quot; can sometimes create ambiguity.

In this case, (1) is the context-free interpretation of choice, but (2) is possible with the proper context.

Without more context, both (1) and (2) are equally viable interpretations of the Japanese sentence.

===Caucasian languages===

====Georgian====
In Georgian, there are two strategies for forming relative clauses. The first is similar to that of English or Latin: the modified noun is followed by a relativizer that inflects for its embedded case and may take a postposition. The relativized noun may be preceded by a determiner.



A second, more colloquial, strategy is marked by the invariant particle რომ &quot;rom&quot;. This particle is generally the second word of the clause, and since it does not decline, is often followed by the appropriately cased third-person pronoun to show the relativized noun&#x27;s role in the embedded clause. A determiner precedes the relativized noun, which is also usually preceded by the clause as a whole.

Such relative clauses may be internally headed. In such cases, the modified noun moves into the clause, taking the appropriate declension for its role therein (thus eliminating the need for the third person pronouns in the above examples), and leaves behind the determiner (which now functions as a pronoun) in the matrix clause.

===Austronesian languages===

====Indonesian====
Indonesian, a zero-copula language that does not mark verb tense, allows a variety of types of relative clause, normally restrictive. They are usually introduced by the relative pronoun &quot;yang&quot;, which stands for &quot;who&quot;/&quot;which&quot;/&quot;what&quot;/&quot;that&quot;.

&quot;Yang&quot; is not allowed as the object of a relative clause, so that Indonesian cannot exactly reproduce structures such as &quot;the house that Jack built&quot;. Instead, a passive form of construction must be used:

Relative clauses with no antecedent to &quot;yang&quot; are possible:

====Tagalog====
Tagalog uses the gapping strategy to form relative clauses, with the complementizer, &quot;na&quot; / &quot;=ng&quot; &#x27;that&#x27;, separating the head, which is the noun being modified, from the actual relative clause. In (1a) below, &quot;lalaki&quot; &#x27;man&#x27; serves as the head, while &quot;nagbigay ng bigas sa bata&quot; &#x27;gave rice to the child&#x27; is the relative clause.

The gap inside the relative clause corresponds to the position that the noun acting as the head would have normally taken, had it been in a declarative sentence. In (1a), the gap is in subject position within the relative clause. This corresponds to the subject position occupied by &quot;ang lalaki&quot; &#x27;the man&#x27; in the declarative sentence in (1b).

There is a constraint in Tagalog on the position from which a noun can be relativized and in which a gap can appear: A noun has to be the subject within the relative clause in order for it to be relativized. The phrases in (2) are ungrammatical because the nouns that have been relativized are not the subjects of their respective relative clauses. In (2a), the gap is in direct object position, while in (2b), the gap is in indirect object position.

The correct Tagalog translations for the intended meanings in (2) are found in (3), where the verbs have been passivized in order to raise the logical direct object in (3a) and the logical indirect object in (3b) to subject position. (Tagalog can have more than one passive voice form for any given verb.)

Tagalog relative clauses can be left-headed, as in (1a) and (3), right-headed, as in (4), or internally headed, as in (5).



In (4), the head, &quot;lalaki&quot; &#x27;man&#x27;, is found after or to the right of the relative clause, &quot;nagbigay ng bigas sa bata&quot; &#x27;gave rice to the child&#x27;. In (5), the head is found in some position inside the relative clause. When the head appears to the right of or internally to the relative clause, the complementizer appears to the left of the head. When the head surfaces to the left of the relative clause, the complementizer surfaces to the right of the head.

There are exceptions to the subjects-only constraint to relativization mentioned above. The first involves relativizing the possessor of a noun phrase within the relative clause.

In (6), the head, &quot;bata&quot; &#x27;child&#x27;, is the owner of the injured finger. The phrase &quot;ang daliri&quot; &#x27;the finger&#x27; is the subject of the verb, &quot;nasugatan&quot; &#x27;was injured&#x27;.

Another exception involves relativizing the oblique noun phrase.



When an oblique noun phrase is relativized, as in (7a), &quot;na&quot; &#x27;that&#x27;, the complementizer that separates the head from the relative clause, is optional. The relative clause itself is also composed differently. In the examples in (1a), and in (3) to (6), the relative clauses are simple declaratives that contain a gap. However, the relative clause in (7a) looks more like an indirect question, complete with the interrogative complementizer, &quot;kung&quot; &#x27;if&#x27;, and a pre-verbally positioned WH-word like &quot;saan&quot; &#x27;where&#x27;, as in (7b). The sentence in (7c) is the declarative version of the relative clause in (7a), illustrating where the head, &quot;ospital&quot; &#x27;hospital&#x27;, would have been &quot;before&quot; relativization. The question in (7d) shows the direct question version of the subordinate indirect question in (7b).

====Hawaiian====

Relative clauses in Hawaiian are avoided unless they are short.

If in English a relative clause would have a copula and an adjective, in Hawaiian the antecedent is simply modified by the adjective: &quot;The honest man&quot; instead of &quot;the man who is honest&quot;. If the English relative clause would have a copula and a noun, in Hawaiian an appositive is used instead: &quot;Paul, an apostle&quot; instead of &quot;Paul, who was an apostle&quot;.

If the English relative pronoun would be the subject of an intransitive or passive verb, in Hawaiian a participle is used instead of a full relative clause: &quot;the people fallen&quot; instead of &quot;the people who fell&quot;; &quot;the thing given&quot; instead of &quot;the thing that was given&quot;. But when the relative clause&#x27;s antecedent is a person, the English relative pronoun would be the subject of the relative clause, and the relative clause&#x27;s verb is active and transitive, a relative clause is used and it begins with the relative pronoun &quot;nana&quot;: &quot;The one who me (past) sent&quot; = &quot;the one who sent me&quot;.

If in English a relative pronoun would be the object of a relative clause, in Hawaiian the possessive form is used so as to treat the antecedent as something possessed: &quot;the things of me to have seen&quot; = &quot;the things that I saw&quot;; &quot;Here is theirs to have seen&quot; = This is what they saw&quot;.

===Andean languages===

====Aymara====
===Chinese===

====Mandarin====

In Mandarin Chinese, the relative clause is similar to other adjectival phrases in that it precedes the noun that it modifies, and ends with the relative particle &quot;de&quot; (的). If the relative clause is missing a subject but contains an object (in other words, if the verb is transitive), the main-clause noun is the implied subject of the relative clause:

If the object but not the subject is missing from the relative clause, the main-clause noun is the implied object of the relative clause:

If both the subject and the object are missing from the relative clause, then the main-clause noun could either be the implied subject or the implied object of the relative clause; sometimes which is intended is clear from the context, especially when the subject or object of the verb must be human and the other must be non-human:

But sometimes ambiguity arises when it is not clear from the context whether the main-clause noun is intended as the subject or the object of the relative clause:

However, the first meaning (in which the main-clause noun is the subject) is usually intended, as the second can be unambiguously stated using a passive voice marker:

Sometimes a relative clause has both a subject and an object specified, in which case the main-clause noun is the implied object of an implied preposition in the relative clause:

It is also possible to include the preposition explicitly in the relative clause, but in that case it takes a pronoun object (a personal pronoun with the function of a relative pronoun):

Free relative clauses are formed in the same way, omitting the modified noun after the particle &quot;de&quot;. As with bound relative clauses, ambiguity may arise; for example, &quot;eat (particle)&quot; may mean &quot;that which is eaten&quot;, i.e. &quot;food&quot;, or &quot;those who eat&quot;.

===Creoles===

====Hawaiian Creole English====

In Hawaiian Creole English, an English-based creole also called Hawaiian Pidgin or simply Pidgin, relative clauses work in a way that is similar to, but not identical to, the way they work in English. As in English, a relative pronoun that serves as the object of the verb in the relative clause can optionally be omitted: For example,

can also be expressed with the relative pronoun omitted, as

However, relative pronouns serving as the subject of a relative clause show more flexibility than in English; they can be included, as is mandatory in English, they can be omitted, or they can be replaced by another pronoun. For example, all of the following can occur and all mean the same thing:



====Gullah====

In Gullah, an English-based creole spoken along the southeastern coast of the United States, no relative pronoun is normally used for the subject of a relative clause. For example:

<text>The Grumman TBF Avenger (designated TBM for aircraft manufactured by General Motors) is an American World War II-era torpedo bomber developed initially for the United States Navy and Marine Corps, and eventually used by several air and naval aviation services around the world.

The Avenger entered U.S. service in 1942, and first saw action during the Battle of Midway. Despite the loss of five of the six Avengers on its combat debut, it survived in service to become the most effective submarine killer and most widely-used torpedo bomber of World War II, sharing credit for sinking the super-battleships and and being credited for sinking 30 submarines. Greatly modified after the war, it remained in use until the 1960s.

From 1942-on, production of the Avenger (in fact nearly three quarters of its the total production) was subcontracted to a purposely established division of General Motors : the Eastern Aircraft Division.

==Design and development==


The Douglas TBD Devastator, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s main torpedo bomber introduced in 1935, was obsolete by 1939. Bids were accepted from several companies, but Grumman&#x27;s TBF design was selected as the replacement for the TBD and in April 1940 two prototypes were ordered by the Navy. Designed by Leroy Grumman, the first prototype was called the &quot;XTBF-1&quot;. It was first flown on 7 August 1941. Although one of the first two prototypes crashed near Brentwood, New York, rapid production continued.

To ease carrier storage concerns, simultaneously with the F4F-4 model of its Wildcat carrier fighter, Grumman designed the Avenger to also use the new Sto-Wing patented &quot;compound angle&quot; wing-folding mechanism, intended to maximize storage space on an aircraft carrier; the Wildcat&#x27;s replacement, the F6F Hellcat, also employed this mechanism. The engine used was the twin-row Wright R-2600-20 Twin Cyclone fourteen-cylinder radial engine, which produced .

There were three crew members: pilot, turret gunner and radioman/bombardier/ventral gunner. A single synchronized .30 caliber (7.62 mm) machine gun was mounted in the nose, a .50 caliber (12.7 mm) gun was mounted right next to the turret gunner&#x27;s head in a rear-facing electrically powered turret, and a single 0.30 caliber (7.62 mm) hand-fired machine gun flexibly-mounted ventrally (under the tail), which was used to defend against enemy fighters attacking from below and to the rear. This gun was fired by the radioman/bombardier while standing up and bending over in the belly of the tail section, though he usually sat on a folding bench facing forward to operate the radio and to sight in bombing runs. 

Later models of the TBF/TBM omitted the cowl-mount synchronized 0.30 caliber (7.62 mm) gun, and replaced it with twin Browning AN/M2 0.50 caliber (12.7 mm) light-barrel guns, one in each wing outboard of the propeller arc, per pilots&#x27; requests for better forward firepower and increased strafing ability. There was only one set of controls on the aircraft, and no direct access to the pilot&#x27;s position existed from the rest of the aircraft&#x27;s interior. The radio equipment was massive, especially by today&#x27;s standards, and filled the length of the well-framed &quot;greenhouse&quot; canopy to the rear of the pilot. The radios were accessible for repair through a &quot;tunnel&quot; along the right hand side. Any Avengers that are still flying today usually have an additional rear-mounted seat in place of the radios, allowing for a fourth passenger.

The Avenger had a large bomb bay, allowing for one Bliss-Leavitt Mark 13 torpedo, a single bomb, or up to four bombs. The aircraft had overall ruggedness and stability, and pilots say it flew like a truck, for better or worse. With its good radio facilities, docile handling, and long range, the Grumman Avenger also made an ideal command aircraft for Commanders, Air Group (CAGs). With a ceiling and a fully loaded range of , it was better than any previous American torpedo bomber, and better than its Japanese counterpart, the obsolete Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot;. Later Avenger models carried radar equipment for the ASW and AEW roles.

Escort carrier sailors referred to the TBF as the &quot;turkey&quot; because of its size and maneuverability in comparison to the F4F Wildcat fighters in the same airgroups.

==Operational history==
===U.S. Navy===


On the afternoon of 7 December 1941, Grumman held a ceremony to open a new manufacturing plant and display the new TBF to the public. Coincidentally, on that day, the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor, as Grumman soon found out. After the ceremony was over, the plant was quickly sealed off to guard against possible sabotage. By early June 1942, a shipment of more than 100 aircraft was sent to the Navy, arriving only a few hours after the three carriers quickly departed from Pearl Harbor, so most of them were too late to participate in the pivotal Battle of Midway.

Six TBF-1s were present on Midway Islandas part of VT-8 (Torpedo Squadron 8)while the rest of the squadron flew Devastators from the aircraft carrier . Both types of torpedo bombers suffered heavy casualties. Out of the six Avengers, five were shot down and the other returned heavily damaged with one of its gunners killed, and the other gunner and the pilot wounded.

Author Gordon Prange posited in &quot;Miracle at Midway&quot; that the outdated Devastators (and lack of new aircraft) contributed somewhat to the lack of a complete victory at Midway (the four Japanese fleet carriers were sunk directly by dive bombers instead). Others pointed out that the inexperienced American pilots and lack of fighter cover were responsible for poor showing of US torpedo bombers, regardless of type. Later in the war, with growing American air superiority, better attack coordination and more veteran pilots, Avengers were able to play vital roles in the subsequent battles against Japanese surface forces.

On 24 August 1942, the next major naval aircraft carrier battle occurred at the Eastern Solomons. Based on the carriers and , the 24 TBFs present were able to sink the Japanese light carrier and claim one dive bomber, at the cost of seven aircraft.

The first major &quot;prize&quot; for the TBFs (which had been assigned the name &quot;Avenger&quot; in October 1941, before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor) was at the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in November 1942, when Marine Corps and Navy Avengers helped sink the Japanese battleship , which had already been crippled the night before.

After hundreds of the original &quot;TBF-1&quot; models were built, the &quot;TBF-1C&quot; began production. The allotment of space for specialized internal and wing-mounted fuel tanks doubled the Avenger&#x27;s range. By 1943, Grumman began to slowly phase out production of the Avenger to produce F6F Hellcat fighters, and the Eastern Aircraft Division of General Motors took over production, with these aircraft being designated &quot;TBM&quot;. The Eastern Aircraft plant was located in Ewing, New Jersey. Grumman delivered a TBF-1, held together with sheet metal screws, so that the automotive engineers could disassemble it, one part at a time, and redesign the aircraft for automotive-style production. This aircraft was known as the &quot;P-K Avenger&quot; (&quot;P-K&quot; being an abbreviation for Parker-Kalon, manufacturer of sheet metal screws). Starting in mid-1944, the &quot;TBM-3&quot; began production (with a more powerful powerplant and wing hardpoints for drop tanks and rockets). The dash-3 was the most numerous of the Avengers (with about 4,600 produced). However, most of the Avengers in service were dash-1s until near the end of the war in 1945.

Besides the traditional surface role (torpedoing surface ships), Avengers claimed about 30 submarine kills, including the cargo submarine . They were one of the most effective sub-killers in the Pacific theater, as well as in the Atlantic, when escort carriers were finally available to escort Allied convoys. There, the Avengers contributed to the warding off of German U-boats while providing air cover for the convoys.

After the &quot;Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;, in which more than 250 Japanese aircraft were downed, Admiral Marc Mitscher ordered a 220-aircraft mission to find the Japanese task force. Fighting away from the fleet at the extreme end of their range, the group of Hellcats, TBF/TBMs, and dive bombers took many casualties. However, Avengers from the sank the light carrier as their only major prize. Mitscher&#x27;s gamble did not pay off as well as he had hoped.

In June 1943, shortly before his 19th birthday, future-president, George H. W. Bush, was commissioned as the youngest naval aviator at the time. Later, while flying a TBM with VT-51 (from ), his Avenger was shot down on 2 September 1944 over the Pacific island of Chichi Jima. However, he released his payload and hit the radio tower target before being forced to bail out over water. Both of his crewmates died. He was rescued at sea by the American submarine . He later received the Distinguished Flying Cross.

Another famous Avenger aviator was Paul Newman, who flew as a rear gunner. He had hoped to be accepted for pilot training, but did not qualify because he was color blind. Newman was on board the escort carrier roughly from Japan when the Enola Gay dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima.

The Avenger was the type of torpedo bomber used during the sinking of the two Japanese &quot;super battleships&quot;, with the US Navy having complete air superiority in both engagements: and .

The postwar disappearance on 5 December 1945 of a flight of five American Avengers, known as Flight 19, was later added to the Bermuda Triangle legend, first written about by Edward Van Winkle Jones in an Associated Press article published in September 1950.

During World War II, the US aeronautical research arm NACA used a complete Avenger in a comprehensive drag-reduction study in their large Langley wind tunnel.

===Royal Navy===
The Avenger was also used by the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm, where it was initially known as the &quot;Tarpon&quot;. Initial test flights were carried out by British Admiralty test pilot Roy Sydney Baker-Falkner at RAF Boscombe Down. However, this name was later discontinued and the Avenger name used instead, as part of the process of the Fleet Air Arm universally adopting the U.S. Navy&#x27;s names for American naval aircraft. The first 402 aircraft were known as Avenger Mk I, 334 TBM-1s from Grumman were called the Avenger Mk II, and 334 TBM-3 were designated the Mk III. An interesting kill by a Royal Navy Avenger was the destruction of a V-1 flying bomb on 9 July 1944. The much faster V-1 was overtaking the Avenger when the Telegraphist Air Gunner in the dorsal turret, Leading Airman Fred Shirmer, fired at it from . For this achievement, Shirmer was Mentioned in Dispatches, later being awarded the DSM for the 1945 Operation Meridian action at Palembang. In the January 1945 British carrier raid on the Soengei Gerong oil refinery during Operation Meridian, a Fleet Air Arm Avenger shot down a Nakajima Ki-44 &quot;Tojo&quot; in low level combat over the jungle. Three Avengers were modified to carry the Highball &quot;bouncing bomb&quot; (given the new codename Tammany Hall), but when trials were unsuccessful, they were returned to standard configuration and passed to the Royal Navy.

One hundred USN TBM-3Es were supplied to the Fleet Air Arm in 1953 under the US Mutual Defense Assistance Program. The aircraft were shipped from Norfolk, Virginia, many aboard the Royal Navy aircraft carrier . The Avengers were fitted with British equipment by Scottish Aviation and delivered as the Avenger AS.4 to several FAA squadrons including No. 767, 814, 815, 820 and 824. The aircraft were replaced from 1954 by Fairey Gannets and were passed to squadrons of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve including Nos. 1841 and 1844 until the RNVR Air Branch was disbanded in 1957. The survivors were transferred to the French Navy in 1957–1958.

===Royal New Zealand Air Force===
The only other operator in World War II was the Royal New Zealand Air Force which used the type primarily as a bomber, equipping Nos. 30 and 31 Squadrons, with both operating from South Pacific island bases during 1944 in support of the Bougainville campaign. Some of the Avengers were later transferred to the British Pacific Fleet.

In 1945, Avengers were involved in pioneering trials of aerial topdressing in New Zealand that led to the establishment of an industry which markedly increased food production and efficiency in farming worldwide. Pilots of the Royal New Zealand Air Force&#x27;s No. 42 Squadron spread fertilizer from Avengers beside runways at Ohakea Air Base and provided a demonstration for farmers at Hood Aerodrome, Masterton, New Zealand.

===Royal Canadian Navy===
One of the primary postwar users of the Avenger was the Royal Canadian Navy, which obtained 125 former US Navy TBM-3E Avengers from 1950 to 1952 to replace their venerable Fairey Fireflies. By the time the Avengers were delivered, the RCN was shifting its primary focus to anti-submarine warfare (ASW), and the aircraft was rapidly becoming obsolete as an attack platform. Consequently, 98 of the RCN Avengers were fitted with an extensive number of novel ASW modifications, including radar, electronic countermeasures (ECM) equipment, and sonobuoys, and the upper ball turret was replaced with a sloping glass canopy that was better suited for observation duties. The modified Avengers were designated &quot;AS 3&quot;. A number of these aircraft were later fitted with a large magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) boom on the rear left side of the fuselage and were redesignated &quot;AS 3M&quot;. However, RCN leaders soon realized the Avenger&#x27;s shortcomings as an ASW aircraft, and in 1954 they elected to replace the AS 3 with the Grumman S-2 Tracker, which offered longer range, greater load-carrying capacity for electronics and armament, and a second engine, a great safety benefit when flying long-range ASW patrols over frigid North Atlantic waters. As delivery of the new license-built CS2F Trackers began in 1957, the Avengers were shifted to training duties, and were officially retired in July 1960.

===Camouflage research===
TBM Avengers were used in wartime research into counter-illumination camouflage. The torpedo bombers were fitted with Yehudi lights, a set of forward-pointing lights automatically adjusted to match the brightness of the sky. The planes therefore appeared as bright as the sky, rather than as dark shapes. The technology, a development of the Canadian navy&#x27;s diffused lighting camouflage research, allowed an Avenger to advance to within before being seen.

===Civilian use===

Many Avengers have survived into the 21st century working as spray-applicators and water-bombers throughout North America, particularly in the Canadian province of New Brunswick.

Forest Protection Limited (FPL) of Fredericton, New Brunswick, once owned and operated the largest civilian fleet of Avengers in the world. FPL began operating Avengers in 1958 after purchasing 12 surplus TBM-3E aircraft from the Royal Canadian Navy. Use of the Avenger fleet at FPL peaked in 1971 when 43 aircraft were in use as both water bombers and spray aircraft. The company sold three Avengers in 2004 (C-GFPS, C-GFPM, and C-GLEJ) to museums or private collectors. The Central New Brunswick Woodsmen&#x27;s Museum has a former FPL Avenger on static display. An FPL Avenger that crashed in 1975 in southwestern New Brunswick was recovered and restored by a group of interested aviation enthusiasts and is currently on display at the Atlantic Canada Aviation Museum. FPL was still operating three Avengers in 2010 configured as water-bombers, and stationed at Miramichi Airport. One of these crashed just after takeoff on 23 April 2010, killing the pilot. The last FPL Avenger was retired on 26 July 2012 and sold to the Shearwater Aviation Museum in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.

There are several other Avengers, usually flying as warbirds in private collections around the world today. They are a popular airshow fixture in both flying and static displays.

In 2020 the Commemorative Air Force (CAF) were flying three TBM Avengers with one based with the Rocky Mountain Wing in Grand Junction, Colorado; another with the Missouri Wing at St Charles Smartt Field; and their newest with the Capital Wing in Culpeper, Virginia. Each of these allow non-CAF members to ride in the aircraft for a Living History Flight Experience.

*Uruguayan Navy operated 16 TBF Avengers in the 1949 to 1963.

==Notable incidents==
* A famous incident involving the TBM / TBF Avenger aircraft was the disappearance of Flight 19, a training flight of five Avengers that originated from Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale and was lost in December 1945 over the Bermuda Triangle.
* During an airshow on 17 April 2021, TBM #91188 made a successful forced-landing south of Cocoa Beach, Florida near Patrick Space Force Base, in shallow surf. Valiant Air Command, the group that owns the plane, recovered the TBM for transport to Titusville, Florida, for extensive repairs.

<doc id="507553" wikidata="Q1422682" url="?curid=507553" title="Hadamard matrix">
<text>In mathematics, a Hadamard matrix, named after the French mathematician Jacques Hadamard, is a square matrix whose entries are either +1 or −1 and whose rows are mutually orthogonal. In geometric terms, this means that each pair of rows in a Hadamard matrix represents two perpendicular vectors, while in combinatorial terms, it means that each pair of rows has matching entries in exactly half of their columns and mismatched entries in the remaining columns. It is a consequence of this definition that the corresponding properties hold for columns as well as rows. 

The &quot;n&quot;-dimensional parallelotope spanned by the rows of an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; Hadamard matrix has the maximum possible volume among parallelotopes spanned by vectors whose entries are bounded in absolute value by 1. Equivalently, a Hadamard matrix has maximal determinant among matrices with entries of absolute value less than or equal to 1 and so is an extremal solution of Hadamard&#x27;s maximal determinant problem.

Certain Hadamard matrices can almost directly be used as an error-correcting code using a Hadamard code (generalized in Reed–Muller codes), and are also used in balanced repeated replication (BRR), used by statisticians to estimate the variance of a parameter estimator.

==Properties==
Let &quot;H&quot; be a Hadamard matrix of order &quot;n&quot;. The transpose of &quot;H&quot; is closely related to its inverse. In fact:

: formula_1

where &quot;In&quot; is the &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; identity matrix and &quot;H&quot;T is the transpose of &quot;H&quot;. To see that this is true, notice that the rows of &quot;H&quot; are all orthogonal vectors over the field of real numbers and each have length formula_2 Dividing &quot;H&quot; through by this length gives an orthogonal matrix whose transpose is thus its inverse. Multiplying by the length again gives the equality above. As a result,

: formula_3

where det(&quot;H&quot;) is the determinant of &quot;H&quot;.

Suppose that &quot;M&quot; is a complex matrix of order &quot;n&quot;, whose entries are bounded by |&quot;Mij&quot;&amp;hairsp;| ≤ 1, for each &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot; between 1 and &quot;n&quot;. Then Hadamard&#x27;s determinant bound states that

: formula_4

Equality in this bound is attained for a real matrix &quot;M&quot; if and only if &quot;M&quot; is a Hadamard matrix.

The order of a Hadamard matrix must be 1, 2, or a multiple of 4.

===Proof===
The proof of the nonexistence of Hadamard matrices with dimensions other than 1, 2, or a multiple of 4 follows:

If formula_5, then there is at least one scalar product of 2 rows which has to be 0. The scalar product is a sum of &quot;n&quot; values each of which is either 1 or −1, therefore the sum is odd for odd &quot;n&quot;, so &quot;n&quot; must be even.

If formula_6 with formula_7, and there exists an formula_8 Hadamard matrix formula_9, then it has the property that for any formula_10:
:formula_11

Now we define the matrix formula_12 by setting formula_13.
Note that formula_14 has all 1s in row 0.
We check that formula_14 is also a Hadamard matrix:
:formula_16

Row 1 and row 2, like all other rows except row 0, must have formula_17 entries of 1 and formula_17 entries of −1 each. (*)

Let formula_19 denote the number of 1s of row 2 beneath 1s in row 1.
Let formula_20 denote the number of −1s of row 2 beneath 1s in row 1.
Let formula_21 denote the number of 1s of row 2 beneath −1s in row 1.
Let formula_22 denote the number of −1s of row 2 beneath −1s in row 1.

Row 2 has to be orthogonal to row 1, so the number of products of entries of the rows resulting in 1, formula_23, has to match those resulting in −1, formula_24.
Due to (*), we also have formula_25, from which we can express formula_26 and formula_27 and substitute:

:formula_28
:formula_29
:formula_30
:formula_31

But we have as the number of 1s in row 1 the odd number formula_32, contradiction.

==Sylvester&#x27;s construction==
Examples of Hadamard matrices were actually first constructed by James Joseph Sylvester in 1867. Let &quot;H&quot; be a Hadamard matrix of order &quot;n&quot;. Then the partitioned matrix
:formula_33

is a Hadamard matrix of order 2&quot;n&quot;. This observation can be applied repeatedly and leads to the following sequence of matrices, also called Walsh matrices.

:formula_34

and

:formula_35

for formula_36, where formula_37 denotes the Kronecker product.

In this manner, Sylvester constructed Hadamard matrices of order 2&quot;k&quot; for every non-negative integer &quot;k&quot;.

Sylvester&#x27;s matrices have a number of special properties. They are symmetric and, when &quot;k&quot; ≥ 1 (2&quot;k&quot;  &gt; 1), have trace zero. The elements in the first column and the first row are all positive. The elements in all the other rows and columns are evenly divided between positive and negative. Sylvester matrices are closely connected with Walsh functions.
===Alternative construction===
If we map the elements of the Hadamard matrix using the group homomorphism formula_38, we can describe an alternative construction of Sylvester&#x27;s Hadamard matrix. First consider the matrix formula_39, the formula_40 matrix whose columns consist of all &quot;n&quot;-bit numbers arranged in ascending counting order. We may define formula_39 recursively by

:formula_42

It can be shown by induction that the image of the Hadamard matrix under the above homomorphism is given by

: formula_43

This construction demonstrates that the rows of the Hadamard matrix formula_44 can be viewed as a length formula_45 linear error-correcting code of rank &quot;n&quot;, and minimum distance formula_46 with generating matrix formula_47

This code is also referred to as a Walsh code. The Hadamard code, by contrast, is constructed from the Hadamard matrix formula_44 by a slightly different procedure.

==Hadamard conjecture==

The most important open question in the theory of Hadamard matrices is one of existence. Specifically, the Hadamard conjecture proposes that a Hadamard matrix of order 4&quot;k&quot; exists for every positive integer &quot;k&quot;. The Hadamard conjecture has also been attributed to Paley, although it was considered implicitly by others prior to Paley&#x27;s work.

A generalization of Sylvester&#x27;s construction proves that if formula_49 and formula_50 are Hadamard matrices of orders &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; respectively, then formula_51 is a Hadamard matrix of order &quot;nm&quot;. This result is used to produce Hadamard matrices of higher order once those of smaller orders are known.

Sylvester&#x27;s 1867 construction yields Hadamard matrices of order 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. Hadamard matrices of orders 12 and 20 were subsequently constructed by Hadamard (in 1893). In 1933, Raymond Paley discovered the Paley construction, which produces a Hadamard matrix of order &quot;q&quot; + 1 when &quot;q&quot; is any prime power that is congruent to 3 modulo 4 and that produces a Hadamard matrix of order 2(&quot;q&quot; + 1) when &quot;q&quot; is a prime power that is congruent to 1 modulo 4. His method uses finite fields.

The smallest order that cannot be constructed by a combination of Sylvester&#x27;s and Paley&#x27;s methods is 92. A Hadamard matrix of this order was found using a computer by Baumert, Golomb, and Hall in 1962 at JPL. They used a construction, due to Williamson, that has yielded many additional orders. Many other methods for constructing Hadamard matrices are now known.

In 2005, Hadi Kharaghani and Behruz Tayfeh-Rezaie published their construction of a Hadamard matrix of order 428. As a result, the smallest order for which no Hadamard matrix is presently known is 668. 

By 2014, there were 12 multiples of 4 less than 2000 for which no Hadamard matrix of that order was known. They are:
668, 716, 892, 1132, 1244, 1388, 1436, 1676, 1772, 1916, 1948, and 1964.

==Equivalence and uniqueness==
Two Hadamard matrices are considered equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by negating rows or columns, or by interchanging rows or columns. Up to equivalence, there is a unique Hadamard matrix of orders 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. There are 5 inequivalent matrices of order 16, 3 of order 20, 60 of order 24, and 487 of order 28. Millions of inequivalent matrices are known for orders 32, 36, and 40. Using a coarser notion of equivalence that also allows transposition, there are 4 inequivalent matrices of order 16, 3 of order 20, 36 of order 24, and 294 of order 28.

Hadamard matrices are also uniquely recoverable, in the following sense: If an Hadamard matrix formula_52 of order formula_53 has formula_54 entries randomly deleted, then with overwhelming likelihood, one can perfectly recover the original matrix formula_52 from the damaged one. The algorithm of recovery has the same computational cost as matrix inversion.

==Special cases==
Many special cases of Hadamard matrices have been investigated in the mathematical literature.

===Skew Hadamard matrices===
A Hadamard matrix &quot;H&quot; is &quot;skew&quot; if formula_56 A skew Hadamard matrix remains a skew Hadamard matrix after multiplication of any row and its corresponding column by −1. This makes it possible, for example, to normalize a skew Hadamard matrix so that all elements in the first row equal 1.

Reid and Brown in 1972 showed that there exists a doubly regular tournament of order &quot;n&quot; if and only if there exists a skew Hadamard matrix of order &quot;n&quot; + 1. In a mathematical tournament of order &quot;n&quot;, each of &quot;n&quot; players plays one match against each of the other players, each match resulting in a win for one of the players and a loss for the other. A tournament is regular if each player wins the same number of matches. A regular tournament is doubly regular if the number of opponents beaten by both of two distinct players is the same for all pairs of distinct players. Since each of the &quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot; − 1)/2 matches played results in a win for one of the players, each player wins (&quot;n&quot; − 1)/2 matches (and loses the same number). Since each of the (&quot;n&quot; − 1)/2 players defeated by a given player also loses to (&quot;n&quot; − 3)/2 other players, the number of player pairs (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;&amp;hairsp;) such that &quot;j&quot; loses both to &quot;i&quot; and to the given player is (&quot;n&quot; − 1)(&quot;n&quot; − 3)/4. The same result should be obtained if the pairs are counted differently: the given player and any of the &quot;n&quot; − 1 other players together defeat the same number of common opponents. This common number of defeated opponents must therefore be (&quot;n&quot; − 3)/4. A skew Hadamard matrix is obtained by introducing an additional player who defeats all of the original players and then forming a matrix with rows and columns labeled by players according to the rule that row &quot;i&quot;, column &quot;j&quot; contains 1 if &quot;i&quot; = &quot;j&quot; or &quot;i&quot; defeats &quot;j&quot; and −1 if &quot;j&quot; defeats &quot;i&quot;. This correspondence in reverse produces a doubly regular tournament from a skew Hadamard matrix, assuming the skew Hadamard matrix is normalized so that all elements of the first row equal 1.

===Regular Hadamard matrices===
Regular Hadamard matrices are real Hadamard matrices whose row and column sums are all equal. A necessary condition on the existence of a regular &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; Hadamard matrix is that &quot;n&quot; be a square number. A circulant matrix is manifestly regular, and therefore a circulant Hadamard matrix would have to be of square order. Moreover, if an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; circulant Hadamard
matrix existed with &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1 then &quot;n&quot; would necessarily have to be of the form 4&quot;u&quot;&amp;hairsp;2 with &quot;u&quot; odd.

===Circulant Hadamard matrices===
The circulant Hadamard matrix conjecture, however, asserts that, apart from the known 1 × 1 and 4 × 4 examples, no such matrices exist. This was verified for all but 26 values of &quot;u&quot; less than 104.

==Generalizations==
One basic generalization is a weighing matrix. A weighing matrix is a square matrix in which entries may also be zero and which satisfies formula_57 for some w, its weight. A weighing matrix with its weight equal to its order is a Hadamard matrix.

Another generalization defines a complex Hadamard matrix to be a matrix in which the entries are complex numbers of unit modulus and which satisfies &quot;H H* = n In&quot; where &quot;H*&quot; is the conjugate transpose of &quot;H&quot;. Complex Hadamard matrices arise in the study of operator algebras and the theory of quantum computation.
Butson-type Hadamard matrices are complex Hadamard matrices in which the entries are taken to be &quot;q&quot;th roots of unity. The term &quot;complex Hadamard matrix&quot; has been used by some authors to refer specifically to the case &quot;q&quot; = 4.

==Practical applications==
* Olivia MFSK – an amateur-radio digital protocol designed to work in difficult (low signal-to-noise ratio plus multipath propagation) conditions on shortwave bands.
* Balanced repeated replication (BRR) – a technique used by statisticians to estimate the variance of a statistical estimator.
* Coded aperture spectrometry – an instrument for measuring the spectrum of light. The mask element used in coded aperture spectrometers is often a variant of a Hadamard matrix.
* Feedback delay networks – Digital reverberation devices which use Hadamard matrices to blend sample values
* Plackett–Burman design of experiments for investigating the dependence of some measured quantity on a number of independent variables.
* Robust parameter designs for investigating noise factor impacts on responses
* Compressed sensing for signal processing and under-determined linear systems (inverse problems)
* Quantum Hadamard gate for quantum computing and the Hadamard transform for quantum algorithms.

<doc id="507555" wikidata="Q835143" url="?curid=507555" title="Jannah">
<text>In Islam, Jannah (, &quot;jannāt&quot;, ) is the final and permanent abode of the righteous. According to one count, the word appears 147 times in the Qur&#x27;an. Belief in the afterlife is one of the six articles of faith in Sunni and is a place in which &quot;Sunni believers&quot; (&quot;Sunni Muminin and Sunni Muminat&quot;) will enjoy pleasure, while the unbelievers (&quot;Kafir&quot;) will suffer in &quot;Jahannam&quot;. Both &quot;Jannah&quot; and &quot;Jahannam&quot; are believed to have several levels. In the case of Jannah, the higher levels are more desirable, and in the case of Jahannam, the lower levels have a higher level of punishments — in &quot;Jannah&quot; the higher the prestige and pleasure, in &quot;Jahannam&quot; the severity of the suffering. The afterlife experiences are described as physical, psychic and spiritual.

Jannah is described with physical pleasures such as gardens, beautiful houris, wine that has no aftereffects, and &quot;divine pleasure&quot;. Their reward of pleasure will vary according to the righteousness of the person. The characteristics of &quot;Jannah&quot; often have direct parallels with those of &quot;Jahannam&quot;. The pleasure and delights of &quot;Jannah&quot; described in the Qu&#x27;ran, are matched by the excruciating pain and horror of &quot;Jahannam&quot;.

Jannah is also referred to as the abode of Adam and Eve before their expulsion. Most Muslims hold that &quot;Jannah&quot; and &quot;Jahannam&quot; co-exist with the temporal world, rather than being created after Judgement Day. Humans may not pass the boundaries to the afterlife, but it may interact with the temporal world of humans.

According to some Islamic teachings, there are two categories of the people of heaven: those who go directly to it and those who enter it after enduring some torment in hell; Also, the people of hell are of two categories: those who stay there temporarily and those who stay there forever.

==Terminology==
&quot;Jannah&quot; is found frequently in the Qur&#x27;an (2:30, 78:12) and often translated as &quot;Heaven&quot; in the sense of an abode in which believers are rewarded in afterlife. Another word, &quot;samāʾ&quot; (usually pl. &quot;samāwāt&quot;) is also found frequently in the Quran and translated as &quot;heaven&quot; but in the sense of the sky above or the celestial sphere. (It is often used in the phrase &quot;as-samawat wal-ard&quot; &quot;the heavens and the earth&quot;, an example being Qu&#x27;ran 38:10.) The Qu&#x27;ran describes both &quot;samāʾ&quot; and &quot;jannah&quot; as being above this world.

&quot;Jannah&quot; is also frequently translated as &quot;paradise&quot;, but another term with a more direct connection to that term is also found, &#x27; (Arabic: ), the literal term meaning paradise, which was borrowed from the Persian word &#x27; (), which is also the source of the English word &quot;paradise&quot;. &quot;&quot; is used in Qu&#x27;ran 18:107 and 23:11 and also designates the highest level of heaven.

In contrast to &quot;Jannah&quot;, the words &quot;&quot;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &quot;&quot;, and other terms are used to refer to the concept of hell. There are many Arabic words for both Heaven and Hell that also appear in the Qu&#x27;ran and in the Hadith. Most of them have become part of Islamic beliefs.

&quot;Jannah&quot; is also used as the name of the Garden of Eden in which Adam and Hawa (Eve) dwelt.

==Salvation/inhabitants==

Scholars do not all agree on who will end up in Jannah, and the criteria for whether or not they will. Issues include whether all Muslims, even those who&#x27;ve committed major sins, will end up in Jannah; whether any non-Muslims will go there or all go to Jahannam.

===Inhabitants according to Quran===
The Quran specifies the qualities for those allowed to inhabit Jannah (according to Smith and Haddad) as: &quot;those who refrain from doing evil, keep their duty, have faith in God&#x27;s revelations, do good works, are truthful, penitent, heedful, and contrite of heart, those who feed the needy and orphans and who are prisoners for God&#x27;s sake.&quot;
Another source (Sebastian Günther and Todd Lawson) gives as the basic criterion for salvation in the afterlife more detail on articles of faith: the belief in the oneness of God (), angels, revealed books, messengers, as well as repentance to God, and doing good deeds (&quot;amal salih&quot;). All these qualities are qualified by the doctrine that ultimately salvation can only be attained through God&#x27;s judgment.

==== Jinn, angels, and devils ====
The idea that jinn as well as humans could find salvation was widely accepted, based on the Quran (Q.55:74) where the saved are promised maidens &quot;untouched before by either men or jinn&quot; – suggesting to classical scholars al-Suyūṭī and al-Majlisī that jinn also are provided their own kind of houri maidens in paradise. Like humans, their destiny in the hereafter depends on whether they accept God&#x27;s guidance. Angels, on the other hand, because they are not subject to desire and so are not subject to temptation, work in paradise serving the &quot;blessed&quot; (humans and jinn) guiding them, officiating marriages, conveying messages, praising them, etc. The devils cannot return to paradise, because Islamic scripture states that their father, the fallen angel Iblis, was banished, but never suggests that he or his offspring were forgiven or promised to return.

The eschatological destiny of these creatures is summarized in the prophetic tradition: &quot;One kind of beings will dwell in Paradise, and they are the angels; one kind will dwell in Hell, and they are the demons; and another kind will dwell some in Paradise and some in Hell, and those are the jinn and the humans.&quot;

==== Salvation of non-Muslims ====
Muslim scholars disagree about exact criteria for salvation of Muslim and non-Muslim. Although most agree that Muslims will be finally saved – &quot;shahids&quot; (martyrs) who die in battle, are expected to enter paradise immediately after death – non-Muslims are another matter.

Muslim scholars arguing in favor of non-Muslims&#x27; being able to enter paradise cite the verse:

Those arguing against non-Muslim salvation regard this verse to have applied only until the arrival of Muhammad, after which it was abrogated by another verse:

Historically, the Ash&#x27;ari school of theology was known for having an optimistic perspective on salvation for Muslims, but a very pessimistic view of those who heard about Muhammad and his character, yet rejected him. The Maturidi school also generally agreed that even sinners among Muslims would eventually enter paradise, but its unclear whether they thought only Muslim would go to Jannah, or if non-Muslims who understood and obeyed &quot;God&#x27;s universal law&quot; would be saved also. The Muʿtazila school held that free will and individual accountability was necessary for Divine justice, thus rejecting the idea of intercession (&quot;Shafa&#x27;a&quot;) by Muhammad on behalf of sinners. Unlike other schools it believed Jannah and Jahannam would be created only after Judgement Day. Like most Sunni, Shia Islam hold that all Muslims will eventually go to Jannah, and like the Ash&#x27;ari school, believe heedless and stubborn unbelievers will go to hell, while those ignorant of the truth of Islam but &quot;truthful to their own religion&quot;, will not. Modernist scholars Muhammad Abduh and Rashid Rida rejected the notion that the People of the Book are excluded from Jannah, referring to another verse.
* ˹Divine grace is˺ neither by your wishes nor those of the People of the Book! Whoever commits evil will be rewarded accordingly, and they will find no protector or helper besides Allah. But those who do good—whether male or female—and have faith will enter Paradise and will never be wronged ˹even as much as˺ the speck on a date stone. (Q.4:123–124)

==Descriptions, details, and organization==
=== Sources ===
Sources on Jannah include the Quran, Islamic traditions, creeds, Quranic commentaries (&quot;tafsir&quot;) and &quot;other theological writing&quot;.
&quot;Third Islamic century traditionalists amplified the eschatological material enormously particularly in areas on where &quot;the Quran is relatively silent&quot; about the nature of Jannah. Some of the more popular Sunni manuals of eschatology are &quot;Kitāb al-rūḥ&quot; of Ibn Qayyim al-Jawzīya and &quot;al-Durra al-fākhira ft kashf &#x27;ulūm al-ākhira&quot; of Abǖ Ḥāmid al-Ghazālī.

===Delights===
Inside Jannah, the Quran says the saved &quot;will have whatever they wish for, forever&quot;; (Q.25:16). Other verses give more specific descriptions of the delights of paradise:

&#x27;And whoever is in awe of standing before their Lord will have two Gardens&lt;br&gt;
... ˹Both will be˺ with lush branches.&lt;br&gt;
... In each ˹Garden˺ will be two flowing springs.&lt;br&gt;
... In each will be two types of every fruit.&lt;br&gt;
... Those ˹believers˺ will recline on furnishings lined with rich brocade. And the fruit of both Gardens will hang within reach.&lt;br&gt;
... In both ˹Gardens˺ will be maidens of modest gaze, who no human or jinn has ever touched before.&lt;br&gt;
... Those ˹maidens˺ will be ˹as elegant˺ as rubies and coral.&lt;br&gt;
... Is there any reward for goodness except goodness?&lt;br&gt;
... And below these two ˹Gardens˺ will be two others.&lt;br&gt;
... Both will be dark green.&lt;br&gt;
... In each will be two gushing springs.&lt;br&gt;
... In them are fruits, palm trees, and pomegranates.&lt;br&gt;
... In all Gardens will be noble, pleasant mates&lt;br&gt;
...˹They will be˺ maidens [houris] with gorgeous eyes, reserved in pavilions.&lt;br&gt;
... No human or jinn has ever touched these ˹maidens˺ before.&lt;br&gt;
... All ˹believers˺ will be reclining on green cushions and splendid carpets.&lt;br&gt;
Then which of your Lord&#x27;s favours will you both deny? (Q.55:46–76, Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran)
Smith and Haddad summarize some of the Quranic pleasures:
Choirs of angels will sing in Arabic (the only language used in paradise), the streets will be as familiar as those of the dwellers&#x27; own countries, inhabitants will eat and drink 100 times more than earthly bodies could hold and will enjoy it 100 times more, their rooms will have thick carpets and brocade sofas, on Fridays they will go to a market to receive new clothing to enhance their beauty, they will not suffer bodily ailments or be subject to functions such as sleeping, spitting, or excreting; they will be forever young.

As the gates of Jannah are opened for the arrival of the saved into Jannah they will be greeted (Q.39:73) by angels announcing, &quot;Peace be upon you, because ye have endured with patience; how excellent a reward is paradise!&quot; (Q13:24).

Inside there will be neither too much heat nor bitter cold; there will be fountains (Q.88:10), abundant shade from spreading tree branches green with foliage (Q.53:14–16, also Q.36:56–57). They will be passed a cup (Q.88:10–16) full of wine &quot;wherefrom they will get [no] aching of the head” (hangovers) [Q.56:19], and &quot;which leads to no idle talk or sinfulness&quot; (Q.52:23),
and every meat (Q.52:22) and trees from which an unceasing supply of fruits grow (Q.36:56–57), &quot;that looks similar ˹but tastes different˺&quot;; (Q.2:25) adornment with golden and pearl bracelets (Q.35:33) and green garments of fine silk and brocade (Q.18:31); attended upon by [ghulman] (Q.52:24), servant-boys (eternal youths (56:17, 76:19)) like spotless pearls (Q.52:24).

While the Quran never mentions God being in the Garden, the faithful are promised the opportunity to gaze upon His face, something the inhabitants of the Fire will be deprived of.

Inhabitants will rejoice in the company of any parents, spouses, and children who were admitted to paradise (Q52:21) —conversing and recalling the past.
;Non-physical pleasures
While the Quran is full of &quot;graphic&quot; descriptions of the &quot;physical pleasures&quot; for the inhabitants of the Garden, it also states that the &quot;acceptance
[&quot;riḍwān&quot;] from God&quot; felt by the inhabitants &quot;is greater&quot; than the pleasure of the Gardens (Q.9:72), the true beauty of paradise, the greatest of all rewards, surpassing all other joys. On the day on which God brings the elect near to his throne (&quot;&quot;), &quot;some faces shall be shining in contemplating their Lord&quot;.

The visit is described as Muhammad leading the men and Fatimah leading the women to approach the Throne, &quot;which is described as a huge esplanade of musk&quot;. As &quot;the veil of light before the Throne lifts, God appears with the radiance of the full moon, and His voice can be heard saying, &#x27;Peace be upon you.&#x27;&quot;

Hadith include stories of the saved being served an enormous feast where &quot;God Himself is present to offer to His faithful ones delicacies kneaded into a kind of pancake&quot;. In another series of narratives, God personally invites the inhabitants of Jannah &quot;to visit with Him every Friday&quot;.

;Houri
&quot;Perhaps no aspect of Islamic eschatology has so captured the imagination&quot; of both &quot;Muslims and non-Muslims&quot; as houri (&quot;ḥūr&quot;). Men will get untouched Houri in paradise (Q55:56), virgin companions of equal age (56:35–38) and have large, beautiful eyes (37:48). Houri have occasioned &quot;spectacular elaborations&quot; by later Islamic eschatological writers, but also &quot;some derision by insensitive Western observers and critics of Islam&quot;.

The Quran also states the saved &quot;will have pure spouses,&quot; (without indicating gender) (Q2:25, Q4:57), accompanied by any children that did not go to Jahannam (Q52:21), and attended to by servant-boys with the spotless appearance similar to a protected pearls (Q52:24).

Despite the Quranic description above, Houris have been described as women who will accompany faithful Muslims in Paradise. Muslim scholars differ as to whether they refer to the believing women of this world or a separate creation, with the majority opting for the latter.

===Size, geography and structure===
The Qur&#x27;an describes paradise as a &quot;great kingdom&quot; (Q.76:20) stretching out over and above the entire world, and &quot;lofty&quot; (Q.69:22).

Paradise is &quot;as vast as the heavens and the earth&quot; (Q.3:133). There are four rivers: one each of water, milk, honey, and wine (47:15). (They were later identified as &quot;Kawthar&quot;, &quot;Kafur&quot;, &quot;Tasnim&quot;, and &quot;Salsabil&quot;.)
Despite the details given in the Quran about Jannah/Garden, &quot;nowhere&quot; is there found &quot;an ordered picture of the structure&quot; of the abode. &quot;For the most part Islamic theology has not concerned itself with questions about the location and structure of the Garden and the Fire on the understanding that only God knows these particulars.&quot;

====Layers/levels====
Many sources agree that paradise has &quot;various degrees and levels&quot;. One conservative Salafi source, quotes as evidence a sahih hadith where Muhammad reassures the mother of a martyr, &quot;O Umm Haarithah, there are gardens in Paradise ... and your son has attained the highest &quot;Firdaws&quot;”, indicating a hierarchy of levels, but does not how many there are.
On the basis of &quot;several scriptural suggestions&quot;, scholars have created &quot;a very detailed structure&quot; of paradise, but there is more than one, and not all of the traditions on location of paradise and hell &quot;are easily pictured or indeed mutually reconcilable&quot;.

For example, Qu&#x27;ran 23:17 states &quot;We created above you seven paths [Ṭarā&#x27;iq]&quot; from which is drawn a heaven of seven tiers (which is also &quot;a structure familiar to Middle Eastern cosmogony since the early Babylonian days&quot;). Another school of thought insists Jannah actually has &quot;eight layers or realms&quot; as the Quran gives &quot;eight different names ... for the abode of the blessed&quot;. 

Some descriptions of Jannah/the Garden indicate that the most spacious and highest part of the Garden, Firdaws, which is directly under the Throne and the place from which the four rivers of Paradise flow. Others say the uppermost portion is either the Garden of Eden or &#x27;Iliyi and that is the second level from the top.

Another possibility is that there are four separate realms of the blessed, of which either Firdaws or Eden is the uppermost. This is based on Surah 55,
which talks about two Gardens: (&quot;As for him who fears standing before his Lord there are two Gardens [Jannatan]&quot;) [S 55:46). All descriptions following
this verse are of things in pairs, (i.e. in the Arabic dual form) – two fountains flowing, fruit of every kind
in pairs, beside these two other gardens with two springs (Q.55:62,66).

Still others have proposed that the seven levels suggested by the Qur&#x27;an are the seven heavens, above which is the Garden or final abode of felicity, while many see paradise as only one entity with many names. (According to one source – a member of the fatwa team at Islamweb.net – only God knows the exact number of the levels of Paradise, but reliable hadith say the number of levels of Jannah may be the same as the number of verses in the Quran, i.e. over 6000 verses.)

One version of the layered Garden conceptualization describes
the highest level of heaven (&quot;al-firdaws&quot;) as being said to be so close that its inhabitants could hear the sound of God&#x27;s throne above. This exclusive location is where the messengers, prophets, Imams, and martyrs (&quot;shahids&quot;) dwell. Al-Suyuti and &quot;Kitāb aḥwāl al-qiyāma&quot; each gives names to the levels that do not always coincide (see table to right).

====Gates/doors====
Two verses of the Quran (Qu&#x27;ran 7:40, 39:73) mention &quot;gates&quot; or &quot;doors&quot; (using the plural form) as the entrance of paradise, but say nothing about their number, names or any other characteristics.
* &quot;To those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance, no opening will there be of the gates of heaven ...&quot; (Qu&#x27;ran 7:40)
* &quot;And those who kept their duty to their Lord (Al-Muttaqoon – the pious) will be led to Paradise in groups till when they reach it, and its gates will be opened&quot; (Qu&#x27;ran 39:73)
As in the case of the levels of Jannah, later sources elaborate, giving names and functions but don&#x27;t agree on all details (see table to right).

In traditions, each level of the eight principal gates of Paradise is described as generally being divided into a hundred degrees guarded by angels (in some traditions Ridwan). The highest level is known as &quot;&quot; (sometimes called Eden) or Illiyin. Entrants will be greeted by angels with salutations of peace or As-Salamu Alaykum.

Jannah is accessible vertically through its gates (Qu&#x27;ran 7:40), by ladders (&quot;ma&#x27;arij&quot;) (Qu&#x27;ran 70:3), or sky-ropes (&quot;asbab&quot;). However, only select beings such as angels and prophets can enter. Iblis (Satan) and devils are kept at bay by angels who throw stars at them, whenever they try to climb back to heaven (Q.37:6–10). Notably and contrary to many Christian ideas on heaven, God (Allah) does not reside in paradise. 

====Rivers====
A few hadith name four rivers in paradise, or coming from paradise, as: Saihan (Syr Darya), Jaihan (Amu Darya), Furat (Euphrates) and Nil (Nile). Salsabil is the name of a spring that is the source of the rivers of Rahma (mercy) and Al-Kawthar (abundance). Sidrat al-Muntaha is a Lote tree that marks the end of the seventh heaven, the boundary where no angel or human can pass. Muhammad is supposed to have taken a pomegranate from jannah, and shared it with Ali, as recorded by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi. However, some scholars, like Ghazali, reject that Muhammad took the fruit, argued he had only a vision instead.

===Literal or allegorical===
According to scholars Jane I. Smith, Yvonne Y. Haddad, while there are Muslims of a &quot;philosophical or mystical&quot;
bent who interpret descriptions of heaven and hell &quot;metaphorically&quot;, &quot;the vast majority of believers&quot;, understand verses of the Quran on Jannah (and hellfire) &quot;to be real and specific, anticipating them&quot; with joy or terror, although this view &quot;has generally not insisted that the realities of the next world will be identical with those of this world&quot;.
Besides the material notion of the paradise, descriptions of it are also interpreted as allegories, whose meaning is the state of joy believers will experience in the afterlife. For some theologians, seeing God is not a question of sight, but of awareness of God&#x27;s presence. Although early Sufis, such as Hallaj, took the descriptions of Paradise literal, later Sufi traditions usually stressed out the allegorical meaning.

===Eternal, not temporal===
While some Quranic verses suggest hellfire is eternal and some that its punishment will not necessarily be forever for Muslims who committed grave sins, verses on Jannah are less ambiguous. Eternality assured in verses about paradise such as Qu&#x27;ran 3:198, 4:57, and 57:12, which say that the righteous will be &quot;khālidūn fīhā&quot; (eternally in it), and Qu&#x27;ran 35:35, which describes the reward of &quot;dār al-maqāma&quot; [the abode of everlastingness]. Consequently, neither &quot;theologians nor the traditionalists&quot; have had any doubts about the eternal nature of paradise or the residence of the righteous in it.

===Other characteristics===
To classical scholars on the afterlife al-Suyūṭī and al-Majlisī, one of the characteristics of Jannah (like hellfire) is that events are not &quot;frozen in one eternal moment&quot;, but form cycles of &quot;endless repetition&quot; and &quot;unceasing self renewing clockwork&quot;. For example, when a fruit is plucked from a tree, a new fruit immediately appears to takes its place; when a hungry inhabitant sees a bird whose meat they would like to eat it falls already roasted into their hands, and after they are done eating, the bird &quot;regains its form shape and flies away&quot;; houri regain their virginity after being deflowered by one of the saved, but they also grow like fruit on trees or plants on the land and &quot;whenever one of them is taken&quot; by one of the saved in paradise one for his pleasure, &quot;a new one springs forth in her place&quot;. (So too in hellfire are the skin of the damned replaced each time that they are burned off by the fire to be burned again, and drowning sinners driven back into the sea by giant snakes and scorpions whernever they reach the safety of shore.)

== Garden of Eden and Paradise ==

Muslim scholars differ on whether the Garden of Eden (), in which Adam and Eve (Adam and &quot;Hawwa&quot;) dwelled before being expelled by God, is the same as the afterlife abode of the righteous believers: paradise. Most scholars in the early centuries of Islamic theology and the centuries onwards thought it was and that indicated that paradise was located on earth. It was argued that when God commanded Adam to &quot;go down&quot; (&quot;ihbit&quot;) from the garden, that did not indicate a vertical movement (such as &quot;falling&quot; from a heaven above to earth), but instead was used in the same sense as Moses telling Israelites to &quot;go down to Egypt&quot;.

However, as paradise came over the centuries to be thought of more and more as &quot;a transcendent, otherworldy realm&quot;, the idea of it being located somewhere on earth fell out of favor. The Garden of Eden, on the other hand lacked many transcendent, otherworldy characteristics. Al-Balluti (887–966) reasoned that the Garden of Eden lacked the perfection and eternal character of a final paradise: Adam and Eve lost the primordial paradise, while the paradisical afterlife lasts forever; if Adam and Eve were in the otherworldly paradise, the devil (&quot;Shaiṭān&quot;) could not have entered and deceive them since there is no evil or idle talk in paradise; Adam slept in his garden, but there is no sleep in paradise.

Many adherences of the Muʿtazila, also refused to identify Adam&#x27;s abode with paradise, because they argued that paradise and hell would not be created until after Day of Judgement, an idea proposed by Dirar b. Amr. Most Muslim scholars, however, assert that paradise and hell have been created already and coexists with the contemporary world, taking evidence from the Quran, Muhammad&#x27;s heavenly journey, and the life in the graves.

Islamic exegesis regards Adam and Eve&#x27;s expulsion from paradise not as punishment for disobedience or a result from abused free will on their part, but as part of God&#x27;s wisdom (&quot;ḥikma&quot;) and plan for humanity to experience the full range of his attributes, his love, forgiveness, and his creation&#x27;s power. By experiencing hardship, they better appreciate paradise and its delights. Khwaja Abdullah Ansari (1006–1088) describes Adam and Eve&#x27;s expulsion as ultimately caused by God, since man has no choice but to comply to God&#x27;s will. However, that does not mean that complying is not a &quot;sin&quot; and that humans should not blame themselves for it. That is exemplified by Adam and Eve in the Quran (Qu&#x27;ran 7:23 &quot;Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we will certainly be losers&quot;.)

==Comparison with other religions==
===Comparison with Judaism===
Jannah shares the name &quot;Garden of the Righteous&quot; with the Jewish concept of paradise. In addition, paradise in Judaism is described as a garden, much like the Garden of Eden, in which people live and walk and dance, wear garments of light and eat the fruit of the tree of life. Like the feast of Jannah, Jewish eschatology describes the Messiah holding a Seudat nissuin, called the Seudat Chiyat HaMatim, with the righteous of every nation at the end time.

===Comparison with Christianity===
Jesus in the Gospels uses various images for heaven that are similarly found in Jannah: feast, mansion, throne, and paradise. In Jannah, humans stay as humans, but the Book of Revelation describes that in heaven Christ &quot;will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body&quot; (Philippians 3:21). God (Allah) does not reside in paradise or heaven. However, in Christianity, the new heavens and the new earth will be where God dwells with humans.

<doc id="507562" wikidata="Q1753543" url="?curid=507562" title="To Record Only Water for Ten Days">
<text>To Record Only Water for Ten Days is the third studio album by American musician John Frusciante, released in 2001 through Warner Music Group. Unlike his previous two solo albums, &quot;Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T Shirt&quot; and &quot;Smile from the Streets You Hold&quot;, the record differs significantly in that Frusciante explores elements of electronica, synthpop and new wave.

==Background==
Following a month in rehab for his heroin addiction and his rejoining the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante felt deeply connected to the spiritual plane and was inspired by the many visions he had of spirits; the ideology of recording water for ten days refers to ten separate periods of time in which an album is conceived. In an interview he explained that the title comes from a symbolic picture of his body being a tape recorder that records the water for ten days as a way to take his &quot;chemical makeup&quot; off, in order to make a possible representation of the feelings and places he wanted to represent through music. Frusciante was encouraged to record the album by producer Jimmy Boyle who had helped him overcome his addiction. The lyrics express this theme and deal mostly with philosophical and spiritual matters as well as delving into his usual brand of psychedelia-tinged personalism.

Frusciante&#x27;s main influences for this album were 1980s synthpop, post-punk and electronica bands that did their own programming, including bands such as Depeche Mode and New Order.

==Recording and release==
Frusciante recorded the album after kicking his addiction to heroin. As with his first two albums, &quot;Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt&quot; and &quot;Smile from the Streets You Hold,&quot; Frusciante recorded this album at home. But while he had taken a conspicuously lo-fi approach on the earlier albums, using a 4-track cassette recorder and even a boombox, he produced &quot;To Record Only Water for Ten Days&quot; in much higher fidelity. Frusciante switched to a Yamaha MD8 – a digital 8-track recorder that used Minidisc technology – to record the raw tracks, which he later transferred to analog tape for further individual track equalization. All guitars were recorded direct-in without amplification.

Contrary to the title of the album, it took longer than ten days to record: according to Frusciante, he spent up to three days on each song.

Frusciante admitted his frustration with digital recording during the making of the album and has since felt inclined towards recording his albums with analog equipment. &quot;When we came to mix that record, I realized how bad it sounded. After that album, I vowed that I wasn&#x27;t going to record anything on digital anymore.&quot;

WMG released the album on February 13, 2001. It charted at #30 on Heatseekers. Vincent Gallo directed a video for every track on the record.

&quot;Murderers&quot; is featured in the &quot;Invisible Boards&quot; segment of the skateboarding home video &quot;Yeah Right!&quot;. The track &quot;Remain&quot; features on episode 18 of the hit Fox series &quot;24.&quot;

In 2017, the Australian label Twelve Suns rereleased the album on vinyl in a limited edition of 1500 copies.

==Track listing==


==Non-album tracks==
Dozens of songs were recorded for the album but left off. The following have been released in some form. Many of these tracks have been released on Frusciante&#x27;s first internet album, &quot;From The Sounds Inside&quot;.

<text>Bryant &amp; Stratton College (informally Bryant &amp; Stratton or simply BSC) is a private college with campuses in New York, Ohio, Virginia, and Wisconsin, as well as an online education division. Founded in 1854, the college offers associate degree and bachelor&#x27;s degree programs. The college is approved by the New York State Board of Regents and accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

==History==
John Collins Bryant, Henry Beadman Bryant, and Henry Dwight Stratton were early graduates of Folsom Business College in Cleveland, Ohio, which they later purchased from the owner of the school, Ezekiel G. Folsom, who founded his school in 1848. Folsom was a former student of Platt Rogers Spencer who developed a standardized style of writing useful in business transactions before the invention of the typewriter.

Platt Spencer also played a role in the formation of Bryant &amp; Stratton College, serving as a partner and teacher at the school which originally focused on bookkeeping and Spencerian penmanship. Bryant &amp; Stratton College was organized in 1854 to provide practical workplace education, and was formerly known as Bryant &amp; Stratton Business Institute.

In addition to purchasing the Cleveland school, Bryant and Stratton established a number of business schools that operated under the name of Bryant &amp; Stratton Chain of Business Schools in most major US cities. By 1864, as many as 50 schools existed and tuition was $40 for an entire program of study. Today, there are schools across four states.

In 2015, Bryant &amp; Stratton was put on a Heightened Cash Monitoring list by the federal government, to allow for a closer monitoring of their financial practices.

In 2020, Bryant and Stratton College began pursuing a non-profit designation, as the college was previously a for-profit institution. Bryant H. Prentice III, the college&#x27;s former owner and a descendant of the college&#x27;s founders, transferred his ownership of the college to a New York-based nonprofit corporation.

== Campuses ==
==Academics==

Bryant &amp; Stratton College offers diplomas, associate degrees, and bachelor&#x27;s degrees in business, technology, hospitality, human and legal services, healthcare, nursing, education, and design.

==Athletics==
Bryant &amp; Stratton College offers multiple sports programs including: soccer, football, basketball, baseball, volleyball, and tennis. The school&#x27;s sports team are the Bobcats.

<doc id="507570" wikidata="Q1754170" url="?curid=507570" title="Shadows Collide with People">
<text>Shadows Collide with People is the fourth studio album by American musician John Frusciante, released February 24, 2004. The album was written during the recording of &quot;By the Way&quot; (2002) by Frusciante&#x27;s group Red Hot Chili Peppers and is widely regarded as his most accessible work, featuring a mix of guitar-driven alternative rock, folk ballads, and electronica. Frusciante has stated that this was his most expensive solo album to date, costing around $150,000 to produce, a significant departure from his earlier albums, which had been low-budget and recorded at his home. Frusciante noted, &quot;I was sick and tired of people dismissing my records as being fucked-up and unprofessional.&quot;

Flea plays a double bass on &quot;The Slaughter&quot;, the closing track of the album. All songs were written by John Frusciante, except &quot;Omission&quot; and &quot;-00Ghost27&quot; which were co-written with Josh Klinghoffer who would later replace Frusciante in Red Hot Chili Peppers. Klinghoffer and Frusciante share the album credits for &quot;Vocal, Guitar, Bass, Synthesizers, Keyboards &amp; Percussion&quot;. &quot;Shadows Collide with People&quot; is the only Frusciante solo album to feature Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; drummer Chad Smith.

Frusciante also made acoustic and demo versions of these tracks available to fans through his official site as an alternative to the highly-produced sound of the record. The demo tracks feature Josh Klinghoffer on drums. A promo version of the album was also made, with the tracks &quot;Omission&quot;, &quot;Song to Sing When I&#x27;m Lonely&quot;, and &quot;Failure33Object&quot;.

The album reached number 191 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and #11 on Heatseekers.

On the vinyl release of the album the words &quot;One step away&quot; were inscribed on side A, &quot;There&#x27;s riddles in the shadows&quot; on side B, &quot;A hint of sadness&quot; on side C, and &#x27;&quot;What they least suspect is coming next&quot; on side D. All of these were hints to lyrics on John&#x27;s next solo album &quot;The Will to Death&quot;, specifically the songs &quot;The Will to Death&quot; (side A), &quot;The Days Have Turned&quot; (sides B and D), and &quot;Loss&quot; (side C).

<text>BPS CS31082-0001, named Cayrel&#x27;s Star , is an old Population II star located in a distance of 2.1 kpc in the galactic halo. It belongs to the class of ultra-metal-poor stars (metallicity Fe/H] = -2.9), specifically the very rare subclass of neutron-capture enhanced stars. It was discovered by Tim C. Beers and collaborators with the Curtis Schmidt telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile and analyzed by Roger Cayrel and collaborators. They used the Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the European Southern Observatory in Paranal, Chile for high-resolution optical spectroscopy to determine elemental abundances. The thorium-232 to uranium-238 ratio was used to determine the age. It is estimated to be about 12.5 billion years old, making it one of the oldest known.

Compared to other ultra-metal-poor, r-process enriched stars (as CS22892-052, BD +17° 3248, HE 1523-0901) CS31082-001 has higher abundances of the actinides (Th, U), but a surprisingly low Pb abundance.

<text>STS-112 (ISS assembly flight 9A) was an 11-day Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station (ISS) flown by . Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; was launched on 7 October 2002 at 19:45 UTC from the Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s launch pad 39B to deliver the 28,000 pound Starboard 1 (S1) truss segment to the Space Station. Ending a 4.5-million-mile journey, &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed at 15:44 UTC on 18 October 2002 on runway 33 at the Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Shuttle Landing Facility.

During the launch, the ET bipod ramp shed a chunk of foam that caused a dent ~4&quot; wide and 3&quot; deep into the metal SRB-ET Attach Ring near the bottom of the left Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster. Prior to the next mission (STS-113), an upper-level decision was made at NASA to continue with launches as scheduled. The launch subsequent to that was the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, the ill-fated STS-107.

Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; had been scheduled to visit the International Space Station (ISS) again on the STS-114 mission in March 2003; however, due to the loss of &quot;Columbia&quot;, all Space Shuttles, including &quot;Atlantis&quot;, were temporarily grounded. Due to rescheduling of missions, &quot;Atlantis&quot; did not fly again until STS-115 on 9 September 2006.

==Crew==
==Mission payload==
===Starboard 1 (S1) truss segment===
The S1 truss segment, which provides structural support for the Space Station radiators was the main payload of STS-112 mission.

The Boeing Company (along with Lockheed Martin) started manufacturing the truss in May 1998 at Michoud. The work was completed in March 1999. The S1 was shipped by aircraft to the KSC Operations and Checkout Building in October 1999 for flight processing. In June 2002, the truss was handed over to NASA for final preparations and pre-flight checks at the Space Station Processing Facility.

===Crew Equipment Translation Aid ===
&quot;Atlantis&quot; also delivered the Crew Equipment Translation Aid (CETA) Cart to the Space Station. The CETA cart was attached to the Mobile Transporter (launched on STS-110) to be used by assembly crews on later missions.

==Mission experiments ==
STS-112 carried several science experiments to the space station including the Plant Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (PGBA), Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA), the Protein Crystal Growth Single-locker Thermal Enclosure System housing the Protein Crystallization Apparatus for Microgravity (PCG-STES-PCAM) and samples for the Zeolite Crystal Growth Furnace (ZCG) experiment.

==Shuttle processing==
Launch preparations for STS-112 mission were sightly delayed due to tiny cracks found within the plumbing of &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; propulsion system on 17 June 2002 by an inspector. The cracks were in metal flow liners inside the main liquid hydrogen fuel lines that feed the shuttle&#x27;s three main engines. Although there were no cracks in the actual fuel pipes themselves, the concern was that metal pieces from the flow liners might break off and fly into the engines. In such a worst-case scenario, the debris can potentially trigger a catastrophic engine shutdown, which in turn could lead to the loss of the crew and the shuttle.

==Mission timeline==

===7 October (Flight Day 1 – Launch)===

Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; lifted off from Launch Pad 39B of the Kennedy Space Center at 19:45:51 GMT through mostly clear blue skies. There were no problems reported during the countdown, and the ascent conformed to the standard timeline (see Space Shuttle – Mission Profile – Launch). For the first time in Space Shuttle history, a &quot;rocketcam&quot; video camera mounted to the upper part of &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; external tank returned live video of the flight to NASA flight controllers. The video was near perfect until the two solid rocket boosters were jettisoned. At that point, the exhaust from the separation motors fogged the camera lens and made the rest of the video difficult to see.&lt;ref name=&quot;Debris/Ice/TPS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, NASA announced that it was looking into a problem with explosive bolts that failed to fire properly during the launch. Immediately before the twin solid rocket boosters fired into life, only one set of pyrotechnics in ten explosive bolts exploded when commanded to do so. All 10 nuts exploded as planned, but NASA was interested in finding out an explanation for the unexpected anomaly.

Arguably the most significant event from this launch was the ET bipod ramp shedding a chunk of foam, estimated to be ~4&quot;x5&quot;x12&quot;, that broke away and hit the lower left SRB-ET Attach Ring near the Integrated Electronics Assembly (IEA) box causing a dent ~4&quot; wide and 3&quot; deep into the solid metal. Prior to approval for the next mission, the situation was analyzed and NASA decided to press ahead under the justification that &quot;The ET is safe to fly with no new concerns (and no added risk)&quot; of further foam strikes. This fateful decision set the stage for the STS-107 tragedy just two launches later. The CAIB report did not highlight the significance of video data from this being the first flight with the ET Camera.

===8 October (Flight Day 2 – Rendezvous and docking preparations) ===

On Flight Day 2, the STS-112 crew settled into preparations for the next day&#x27;s rendezvous and docking with the International Space Station. After the wake up call went at 4:46 am CDT, the crew began its first full day on orbit. Pilot Pamela Melroy assisted Mission Specialists David Wolf and Piers Sellers in a checkout of spacewalk suits and equipment. Commander Jeff Ashby worked with the prime robotic arm operator, Mission Specialist Sandy Magnus, to verify the arm&#x27;s readiness. Ashby and Magnus powered up the arm for a video survey of Atlantis&#x27; payload bay. The crew also completed the setting up of the orbiter docking system&#x27;s centerline camera, extended the orbiter&#x27;s spring-loaded ring that will make first contact, and checked out rendezvous tools.

During the day, the STS-112 crew successfully completed three Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) burns to boost the shuttle into the station&#x27;s orbit and refine its approach path to the station.

Astronaut Wolf also checked-out the Spatial Heterodyne Imager for Mesospheric Radicals or the SHIMMER experiment sponsored by the Naval Research Lab. The SHIMMER experiment uses an ultraviolet sensing camera to observe the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere at 40–90 kilometers looking for possible ozone loss. The experiment proved balky, but with help from Mission Control the crew worked out steps to ready the gear for observations during the mission.

===9 October (Flight Day 3 – Docking) ===

Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; docked to the Space Station at 15:17 GMT to begin a week of joint operations for the STS-112 and Expedition 5 crews. With commander Jeffrey Ashby at the controls, &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; docking system engaged the Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 (Destiny Laboratory&#x27;s forward docking port) in the front of the space station as the two spacecraft sailed 245 miles above central Asia at five miles per second. Crew members of &quot;Atlantis&quot; were the first visitors for the Expedition 5 station crew who arrived at the outpost the first week of June 2002.

Following pressure checks, station science officer Peggy Whitson asked Commander Ashby if he had brought the salsa that she had asked for. When Ashby replied that he had, Whitson said &quot;OK, we&#x27;ll let you in&quot;. The hatches between &quot;Atlantis&quot; and the Space Station were opened at 16:51 GMT and astronaut Ashby floated into the Destiny Module and immediately embraced Whitson. Mission Specialist Sandra Magnus followed next, followed by the rest of &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; STS-112 crew members. They were greeted by the three member station crew.

After a safety briefing from station commander Valery Korzun, the combined crews split up and began preparing for a busy day of work. Astronaut Pamela Melroy, cosmonaut Korzun, and Mission Specialists Dave Wolf, Piers Sellers, and Fyodor Yurchikhin configured the spacesuits for EVA 1. Magnus and Whitson reviewed robotic arm operations for moving the new truss segment into place.

===10 October (Flight Day 4 – EVA 1) ===

The workday began at 3 am CDT with a musical wakeup call to &quot;Atlantis&quot;″ crew from Mission Control, Houston. Earlier on Flight Day 4 astronauts Whitson and Magnus used the station&#x27;s Canadarm2 robotic arm to grapple the S1 truss structure, remove it from &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; payload bay, and move it to the starboard end the S0 section. Four remotely operated motorized bolts locked the two truss segments together at 8:36 am CDT.

Simultaneously, Astronauts Dave Wolf and Piers Sellers prepared for the mission&#x27;s first spacewalk. EVA 1 was the 44th spacewalk staged to support the space station assembly and maintenance. The two astronauts exited the Quest Airlock at about 11:21 am EDT. Wolf&#x27;s spacesuit had solid red stripes for identification, while Sellers donned an all white spacesuit. As Wolf worked to accomplish to connect power, data and fluid lines between the S0 and the S1 trusses, Sellers, on his first spacewalk, released the locks on three folded-up radiators mounted to the S1, allowing S1&#x27;s radiators to be oriented for optimal cooling.

The spacewalking astronauts worked for seven hours and one minute outside the space station, 31 minutes longer than expected due to a problem with the Canadarm2. The glitch forced Wolf to complete installation of a television camera system on the far end of the truss without the assistance of the robot arm. The only other problem of EVA 1 came near the end of the spacewalk when Wolf reported his helmet earphones appeared to be losing power.

Throughout the spacewalk, astronaut Melroy offered guidance and advice to the spacewalkers and keeping them on schedule. Shuttle Commander Jeff Ashby operated the shuttle robotic arm, providing camera views for documentation. Following a tool inventory check and cleanup activities, Wolf and Sellers re-entered Quest. The Airlock was re-pressurized at 5:22 pm CDT to end EVA 1.

===11 October (Flight Day 5 – Off duty and transfers) ===

On Flight Day 5, the combined shuttle and space station crew took several hours of off-duty time. Then they began transfer operations between the vehicles and prepared for mission&#x27;s second spacewalk. The crew moved a number of scientific experiments back and forth between the shuttle and the ISS to return completed experiments to Earth and deploy new experiments at the ISS. Transfer items included a set of liver cell tissue samples from an experiment studying the function of human liver cells in microgravity, moved from the station onto the shuttle for return to Earth.

Payload experiments such as Marshall Space Flight Center&#x27;s protein crystal growth thermal enclosures for growing high-quality protein crystals in micro-gravity experiments were moved to and from the station. Seven water containers were transferred to the station. Commander Jeff Ashby initiated a Nitrogen transfer process that moved about 15 pounds of the gas from &quot;Atlantis&quot; to the station by the end of the day.

STS-112 spacewalkers David Wolf and Piers Sellers, assisted by Pilot Pamela Melroy, readied the EVA equipment They recharged water on the extravehicular mobility unit (EMU), configured their tools and prepared the Quest airlock.

The crew also participated in several live media interviews. Astronauts Magnus, Wolf and Sellers discussed about EVA 1 and the first-time experiences in space with CBS Radio Network and Cable News Network (CNN). Speaking to CBS News, Wolf told that manual work Piers and himself did at the end of EVA 1 to install the S1&#x27;s outboard nadir external camera got their heart rates up to over 170 per minute. The spacewalkers were not able to use the Station&#x27;s Canadarm 2 as a result of a software glitch.

Russian cosmonauts Valery Korzun, Sergei Treschev and Fyodor Yurchikhin participated in several interviews with the Russian press. Shortly before sleep, the crew reviewed procedures for EVA 2.

===12 October (Flight Day 6 – EVA 2) ===

===13 October (Flight Day 7) ===

===14 October (Flight Day 8 – EVA 3) ===

===15 October (Flight Day 9) ===

===16 October (Flight Day 10 – Undocking) ===

===17 October (Flight Day 11 – Landing preparations) ===

===18 October (Flight Day 12 – Landing) ===
.

=== Crew seat assignments ===
==Spacewalks==
==Shuttlecam==
A camera mounted to the shuttle&#x27;s external tank captured &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; ascent to orbit. This was the first time such footage was recorded. However, after solid rocket booster separation, the camera was fogged with the propellant, and was rendered unusable. The camera was moved downward after STS-112.

In the response to the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster (STS-107), the camera was also used on all subsequent missions to capture images of the falling debris from the external tank.

==Wake-up calls==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Gemini program, which was first used to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15.
Each track is specially chosen, often by their families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<text>The Munda languages are a group of closely related languages spoken by about eleven million people in India, Bangladesh and Nepal. Historically, they have been called the Kolarian languages. They constitute a branch of the Austroasiatic language family, which means they are more distantly related to languages such as the Mon and Khmer languages, to Vietnamese, as well as to minority languages in Thailand and Laos and the minority Mangic languages of South China. Bhumij, Ho, Mundari, and Santali are notable Munda languages.

The family is generally divided into two branches: North Munda, spoken in the Chota Nagpur Plateau of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Odisha and West Bengal, as well as in parts of Bangladesh and Nepal, and South Munda, spoken in central Odisha and along the border between Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.

North Munda, of which Santali is the most widely spoken and recognised as an official language in India, has twice as many speakers as South Munda. After Santali, the Mundari and Ho languages rank next in number of speakers, followed by Korku and Sora. The remaining Munda languages are spoken by small, isolated groups, and are poorly described.

Characteristics of the Munda languages include three grammatical numbers (singular, dual and plural), two genders (animate and inanimate), a distinction between inclusive and exclusive first person plural pronouns, the use of suffixes or auxiliaries to indicate tense, and partial, total, and complex reduplication, as well as switch-reference. The Munda languages are also polysynthetic and agglutinating. In Munda sound systems, consonant sequences are infrequent except in the middle of a word. The Munda languages are often interpreted as prime examples of father tongues, that the languages were passed down through generations from the paternal side, rather than the mother.

==Origin==
Many linguists suggest that the Proto-Munda language probably split from proto-Austroasiatic somewhere in Indochina. Studies by Chaubey et al. (2011), Arunkumaret al. (2015), Metspalu
et al. (2018), and Tätte et al. (2019) all show that the Munda branch of the Austroasiatic family was created as the result of a male-biased linguistic intrusion into the Indian subcontinent from South-east Asia during the Late Neolithic period (Sidwell &amp; Rau 2019 cited Tätte et al. (2019), estimate a date of formation between 3,800 and 2,000 YBPs), which carried the paternal lineage O1b1a1a into India, either from Meghalaya or from the sea. These studies and analyses confirm George van Driem&#x27;s Munda Father tongue hypothesis. Paul Sidwell (2018) suggests they arrived on the coast of modern-day Odisha about 4000–3500 years ago ( BCE) and spread after the Indo-Aryan migration to the region.

Rau and Sidwell (2019), along with Blench (2019), suggest that pre-Proto-Munda had arrived in the Mahanadi River Delta around 1,500 BCE from Southeast Asia via a maritime route, rather than overland. The Munda languages then subsequently spread up the Mahanadi watershed. 2021 studies suggest that Munda languages impacted Eastern Indo-Aryan languages.

==Classification==
Munda consists of five uncontroversial branches (Korku as an isolate, Remo, Savara, Kherwar, and Kharia-Juang). However, their interrelationship is debated.

===Diffloth (1974)===
The bipartite Diffloth (1974) classification is widely cited:
*Munda
**North Munda
*** Korku
***Kherwarian
****Kherwari branch: Birjia, Koraku
****Mundari branch: Mundari, Bhumij, Asuri, Koda, Ho, Birhor, Kol, Turi
****Santal branch: Santali, Mahali
**South Munda
***Kharia–Juang: Kharia, Juang
***Koraput Munda
**** Remo branch: Gata (Gta), Bondo (Remo), Bodo Gadaba (Gutob)
****Savara branch [Sora–Juray–Gorum] : Parengi (Gorum), Sora (Savara), Juray, Lodhi
===Diffloth (2005)===
Diffloth (2005) retains Koraput (rejected by Anderson, below) but abandons South Munda and places Kharia–Juang with the northern languages:

===Anderson (1999)===
Gregory Anderson&#x27;s 1999 proposal is as follows.
*Munda
**North Munda
***Korku
***Kherwarian: Santali, Mundari
**South Munda (3 branches)
***Kharia–Juang: Juang, Kharia
***Sora–Gorum: Sora, Gorum
***Gutob–Remo–Gtaʔ
****Gutob–Remo: Gutob, Remo
****Gtaʼ: Plains Gtaʔ, Hill Gtaʔ
However, in 2001, Anderson split Juang and Kharia apart from the Juang-Kharia branch and also excluded Gtaʔ from his former Gutob–Remo–Gtaʔ branch. Thus, his 2001 proposal includes 5 branches for South Munda.

===Anderson (2001)===
Anderson (2001) follows Diffloth (1974) apart from rejecting the validity of Koraput. He proposes instead, on the basis of morphological comparisons, that Proto-South Munda split directly into Diffloth&#x27;s three daughter groups, Kharia–Juang, Sora–Gorum (Savara), and Gutob–Remo–Gtaʼ (Remo).

His South Munda branch contains the following five branches, while the North Munda branch is the same as those of Diffloth (1974) and Anderson (1999).

*&quot;Note&quot;: &quot;↔&quot; = shares certain innovative isoglosses (structural, lexical). In Austronesian and Papuan linguistics, this has been called a &quot;linkage&quot; by Malcolm Ross.

===Sidwell (2015)===
Paul Sidwell (2015:197) considers Munda to consist of 6 coordinate branches, and does not accept South Munda as a unified subgroup.
*Munda
**North Munda
***Korku
***Kherwarian (Santali, Munda)
**Sora–Gorum
**Juang
**Kharia
**Gutob–Remo
**Gtaʼ
==Phonology==
===Consonants, vowels, and syllable===
The Munda languages share a similar set of consonants with the Eastern Austroasiatic languages. Inherited Austroasiatic glottalized stop and nasalized release of Munda are noteworthy unique phonotactic features in South Asia. Munda generally have fewer vowels (between 5 and 10, not include long vowels) than comparatively the Eastern Austroasiatics, still more than that of Indo-Aryan and Dravidian. Like any other Austroasiatic languages, the Munda languages make extensive uses of diphthongs, triphthongs. Larger vowel sequences can be found, with an extreme example of Santali &quot;kɔeaeae&quot; meaning ‘he will ask for him’. Most Munda languages have registers but lack tones with an exception of Korku who has acquired two tones from South Asian: an unmarked high and a marked low. The general syllable shape is (C)V(C), and the preferred structure for disyllables is CVCV. South Munda displays tendency toward initial clusters, CCVC word shape, with best examples are manifested in the Gtaʔ case. Munda word shape is dictated by a general phonotactical phenomenon called bimoraic constraint: it requires free-standing nominal stems to stay either disyllabic or obtain weight at the stressed syllable, that is, monosyllabic free forms of nouns have to be expanded in order to remain heavy (Anderson &amp; Zide 2001). See ##Vocabulary for comparison.

===Word prominence===
 posited overarching assumptions that all Munda languages have completely redesigned their word prosodic structure from proto-Austroasiatic rising, iambic and reduced vowel sesquisyllabic to Indic norms of trochaic, falling rhythm, stable or assimilationist consonants and harmonised vowels, making them oppose to Eastern Austroasiatic languages at almost every level. criticized Donegan &amp; Stampe, pointing out that the overall picture appears much more complicated and diverse, and that generalizations of Donegan &amp; Stampe are not supported by the instrumental data of the various Munda languages. describes word-rising in monosyllables and second syllable prominence in Kharia content words. The presence of clitics and affixes even does not drive Kharia word prosodic structure to that of a trochaic and falling system. reports final syllable stress in all but CVC.CV stems in Mundari. , Horo (2017) and found that the Sora disyllables are always iambic, reduced first syllable vowel space, and second syllable prominence. Even CV.CCə words show final syllable prominence. note that the Sora vowels of the first syllables are “centralized” while vowels in the second syllables are more representative of the canonical vowel space. Ghosh (2008) describes the Santali prosody that “stress is always released in the second syllable of the word regardless of whether it is an open or a closed syllable.” His analysis was confirmed by , whose acoustic data clearly shows that the Santali second syllable is always the prominent syllable with greater intensity of stress and a rising contour. reports that in Korku, the final syllable is heavier than the initial syllable, and within a disyllable, stress is preferentially released at the final syllable. Munda overall appears to have LH pitch accent and bi-moraic word constraint patterns that they inherited from proto-Austroasiatic. Again, claim on rhythmic holism does not conform with data presented by individual Munda languages.

==Morphology==
Morphologically, both North and South Munda subgroups mainly focus on the head or the verb, thus they are primarily head-marking, in contrast to dependent-marking Indo-European and Dravidian families. As a result, nominal morphology is less complex than verbal morphology. Case markers on nominals to show syntactic alignments, i.e. nominative-accusative, ergative-absolutive, are largely absent or not systematically developed among the Munda languages except Korku. Relation between subject and object in clause is mainly conveyed through verbal referent indexation and word order. At clause/sentence level, Munda languages are head-final, but internally head-first in referent indexation, compounds, and noun incorporation verb complexes. Munda head-first, bimoraic constraint-free noun incorporation is also found in Khasian, Nicobaric, and other Mon-Khmer languages. In word derivation, besides their own innovative methods, the Munda languages maintain Austroasiatic methods in forms of reduplication, compounding, and derivational infixation and prefixation. Some languages retain a dative-oblique prefix &quot;a-&quot;.

===North Munda===
The North Munda subgroup is split between Korku and the fourteen Kherwarian languages.

====Kherwarian languages====
Kherwarian is a large language continuum with speakers extending west to east from the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh to Assam, north to south from Nepal to Odisha. They include fourteen languages: Asuri, Birhor, Bhumij, Koda, Ho, Korwa (Korowa), Mundari, Mahali, Santali, Turi, Agariya, Bijori, Koraku, and Karmali, with the total number of speakers surpassing ten million (2011 census). The Kherwarian languages are often highlighted due to their elaborate and complex templatic and pronominalized predicate structures are so pervasive that it is obligatory for the verb to encode TAM, valency, voices, possessive, transitivity, clear distinction between exclusive and inclusive first persons, and index with all arguments, including non-arguments like possessors.

Noun incorporation is often described as an ancestral Munda morphological feature and is essential to the grammar of other South Munda languages such as Sora, but the Kherwarian languages appear to have lost noun incorporation altogether. Nevertheless, rare surviving examples of noun incorporation could be found in some Kherwarian archaic registers and oral literature.

====Korku====
Unlike the Kherwarian languages with their complex verbal morphology, the Korku verb is moderately simple with modest amount of synthesis. Korku lacks person/number indexing of subject(s)/actor (except third persons of locative copulas and nominal predicates in the locative case) and independent present/future tense markers. Korku present/future tenses rely on the finitizer suffix &quot;-bà&quot;. Present/Future tense negation can be located in either preverbal or post-verbal, but past tense negation is marked by suffix &quot;-ᶑùn&quot;.

Many Korku auxiliary verbs are borrowed from Indo-Aryan. The auxiliary predicate will take TAM, voice, finiteness suffixes for the verb. Such an example would be &quot;ghaʈa-&quot; meaning &#x27;to manage to, to find a way to&#x27; serves as the acquisitive.

===South Munda===
Compared to North Munda, the South Munda languages are even more divergent with fewer shared morphological traits. Even the classification of Munda languages figures out that South Munda does not seem to exist as a valid taxon. However, South Munda languages retain many notable characteristics of the original proto-Munda such as prefix slots, scope-ordering of referent indexation, thus they represent the less restructured morphology of Munda, reflecting the older proto-Munda as well as proto-Austroasiatic structures.

====Kharia====
In Kharia, subject markers index not only dual/plural exclusive/inclusive but also honorific status. Objects are not marked in the verb in per se. They are marked, instead, by oblique case &quot;=te&quot;.

There is a reduplicated free-standing form of each finite verb that behaves differently from simple verb stem. In the predicate, reduplicated free-standing form never marks TAM and person. Because of this, the free-standing form is used in subordination, an attributive function corresponding more or less to relative clauses. The infinitive verb form is marked by &quot;=na&quot;. The infinitive can serve as nominalizer, too: &quot;jib=na=te&quot; ‘touching’.

Similar to Hindi and Sadani, Kharia has made a calque to form sequential converbs (conjunctive participles) &quot;kon&quot; (derived from &quot;ikon&quot;, ‘do’). They denote the completion of an action before another begins.

The negation particle &quot;um&quot; attaches or fuses person/number/honorific of the subject argument.

====Juang====
Juang exhibits nominative-accusative alignment with unmarked subject/agents and marked objects or patients.

Being a pro-drop language, Juang has a tendency or obligatory of indexing both two core arguments in a transitive predicate. If the arguments are not omitted, referent indexation is largely optional. Juang has a fairly complex TAM system that is often divided into two sets: I for transitive verbs and II for intransitive verbs. The verb ‘be’ usually does not show up in the present tense and with the presence of a predicate adjective in sentences.

There are two types of negation markers: Pronominal negation markers are specific for person/number of subject or object arguments. General negation markers, such as -jena, supplant lack of first person singular negative. Negatives are ambifixative but prefer to precede the verb stem. There are double negations, i.e. combinations of two negatives. The negated verb may reduplicate itself.

Noun incorporation is fossilized in lexical compounds and words like body parts being combined with the verb ‘wash’. Notice that the head precedes the incorporated object, as opposed to head-final position in normal clauses.

====Gtaʔ-Remo-Gutob====
The Southernmost Gtaʔ and Remo-Gutob subgroups of South Munda exhibit significant morphological convergence towards Dravidian languages. Auxiliary verb constructions are heavily employed. Doubly inflected AVCs are common in Gutob as well Gorum, reflecting Dravidian influence. Gtaʔ-Remo-Gutob apparently have lost or not developed object indexation altogether. Negation in Gutob is the most complex among the Munda languages. Like other Munda languages, Gtaʔ-Remo-Gutob have lexical noun incorporation; Gtaʔ retains some instances of unproductive incorporation of body parts to the verb ‘wash’ like Juang which may fit Mithun (1984)&#x27;s type II of incorporation.

====Sora-Gorum====
The Sora-Gorum languages consist of Sora, Gorum, and the lesser known Juray. Sora-Gorum languages display many features that are considered to be archaic that can be dated to proto-Munda. For mainstream South Asian languages like Indo-Aryan and Dravidian, the latter are exclusively suffixing, prefixes and infixes are unusual but pretty common in Austroasiatic languages, and Sora-Gorum whose prefix domain can host several pre-stem markers. The indexation paradigm in Sora and Gorum renders the fullest form of proto-Munda predicate structure as well as syntax. In practice, Sora is inclined to index only one argument. Within a transitive predicate, the object argument is ranked higher than subject; pronouns are required.

Gorum: 

Sora: 

In Sora, noun incorporation is a valency-reducing effort, close to what described by Mithun&#x27;s type III incorporation. Each noun has a combined form (CF), which is a compact, compressed monosyllabic form of free-standing noun that has been stripped of its functional morphology (weak suppletion) and does not adhere to bimoraic constraint. Only CFs are allowed to be in compounds with the verb stem. The resulted verb-noun incorporated compound is syntactically distinct from phrases. Unlike North Munda where it is restricted to oral literature, Sora noun incorporation is in fact pervasive in daily conversations, with every noun except loan words has a possible CF to create sequences of complex verb phrases.



While the most salient effect of object noun incorporation in most polysynthetic languages is lowering the scope of the verb and turning transitive verbs into intransitive, incorporation of transitive subject/agent is considered atypical and occupies at the lowest position of the hierarchy. Because of this, the incorporation of transitive subjects had been once surmised as theoretically impossible by some linguists. Among all languages, there are few exceptional attested cases that permit such type of incorporation including some Athabaskan languages like Koyukon and South Slavey, and indeed, Sora.

==Munda lexicon and lexical relation with other Indian language families==
Despite some influence from neighboring languages, the Munda languages generally maintain a solid Austroasiatic and Munda base vocabulary. The most extreme case is Sora which has zero foreign phonemes. Agricultural-related words from proto-Austroasiatic are widely shared (Zide &amp; Zide 1976). Words for domesticated animal and plant species like dog, millet, chicken, goat, pig, rice are shared or semantically alternated. There are even specific terms for husked uncooked rice vs cooked rice vs rice (tree), as well as shared words used in rice production and processing like &#x27;mortar&#x27;, &#x27;pestle&#x27;, &#x27;paddy&#x27;, &#x27;sow&#x27;, &#x27;grind/ground&#x27;. The majority of loan words from Indo-Aryan to Munda are quite recent and mostly came from Hindi. The Southern languages like Gutob have received considerable Dradivian lexical influence. A very small number of lexemes seem to be shared between Munda and Tibeto-Burman, probably reflecting earlier contact between two groups.

It is clear that hundreds of non-Indo-European words in Vedic Sanskrit that Kuiper (1948) attributed to Munda has been rejected through careful analysis. Except for words like ‘cotton’, there is a surprising absence of Ancient Sanskrit and Medieval Indian borrowings of animal &amp; plant names from Munda. Scholars believe that the Munda tribes typically occupied a marginalized and lowly socioeconomic position in the Hinduized society of Vedic South Asia, or did not participate in the Hindu caste system and had barely any contacts with Hindus at all. and Southworth (2005) proposed that the early non-Indo-European words with prefixes &quot;k-, ka-, ku-, cər-&quot; in Vedic Sanskrit belonged to a hypothetical &#x27;Para-Munda substratum&#x27; that they believed to be part of the Harappan language. This would imply that Austroasiatic speakers might have penetrated as far as the Panjab and Afghanistan in the early second millennium BC, whereas Osada (2009) refuted Witzel that those words might have been, in fact, Dravidian compounds.

Thomas Jarvis started his political career in 1672 as a member of the executive council under Governor Peter Carteret and continued to play an active role in colonial politics for two decades. He ventured south to the Albemarle Region with George Durant, John Jenkins, Thomas Harvey and others, mainly from Isle of Wight and Nansemond Counties, Virginia in 1658. From 1683 to 1689, Jarvis was the acting chief executive during the tenures of governors Seth Sothel and John Gibbs. In 1691 he was appointed Deputy Governor of North and South Carolina where he served under Governor Philip Ludwell. With this appointment, Thomas became the first deputy governor of the entire colony, including the area north-east of Cape Fear.

Very little is known about his private life or his origin (neither his birthplace nor his parents are known). Jarvis married Dorcas Foster. They had a son, Foster, and a daughter, Dorcas, who married Charles Neal. He purchased a piece of land located between the Perquimans River and Carolina Sound (at that time known as the Albemarle county). This land was purchased in conjunction with a Native American tribe. Jarvis was also granted 2600 acres (jointly with Col. Lemuel Mason and Thomas Willoughby) known as &quot;White&#x27;s Island&quot;, then stated to be &quot;at&quot; Currituck within Lower Norfolk County, Virginia, in 1688 (now known as &quot;Church Island&quot;) It was here that he made his primary residence. Sometime before his appointment to deputy governor in 1691, Jarvis was a ship captain. In addition, Jarvis owned at least seven slaves (three were African Americans, two were Native Americans, and two were of biracial descent). He died in White&#x27;s Island, Currituck County, North Carolina in 1694.

<doc id="507628" wikidata="Q501768" url="?curid=507628" title="Barbary Coast">
<text>The Barbary Coast (also Barbary, Berbery, or Berber Coast) was the name given to the coastal regions of central and western North Africa or more specifically the Maghreb and the Ottoman borderlands consisting of the regencies in Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, as well as the Sultanate of Morocco from the 16th to 19th centuries. The term originates from an exonym for the Berbers.

==History==
Barbary was not always a unified political entity. From the 16th century onward, it was divided into four political entities—from west to east—the Alawi Sultanate, the Regency of Algiers, the Regency of Tunis, and the Regency of Tripoli. Major rulers and petty monarchs during the times of the Barbary states&#x27; plundering parties included the sultan of Morocco, the dey of Algiers, bey of Tunis, and pasha of Tripoli, respectively.

In 1625, the pirate fleet of Algiers, by far the largest, numbered 100 ships of various sizes, carrying 8,000 to 10,000 men. The corsair industry alone accounted for 25 percent of the workforce of the city, not counting other activities of the port. The fleet only averaged 25 ships in the 1680s, but these were larger vessels than had been used since the 1620s, so the fleet still employed some 7,000 men. In addition, 2,500 men manned the pirate fleet of Tripoli, 3,000 in Tunis, and several thousand more in the various minor pirate bases such as Bona, Susa, Bizerta, and Salé. The corsairs were not solely natives of the cities where they were based; while many were Arabs and Berbers, there were also Turks, Greeks, Albanians, Syrians, and renegade Italians, especially Corsicans, among their number.

The establishment of the U.S. Constitution in 1789 empowered the federal government to levy taxes and maintain a military, authorities previously absent under the Articles of Confederation. The nascent nation&#x27;s first naval vessels were commissioned in 1794 to counter Algerian piracy. Subsequently, in 1801, the Pasha of Tripoli declared war on the United States, citing unpaid tribute.

The first overseas military land action of the United States was executed by the US Marines and the US Navy in April 1805 at the Battle of Derna, at Tripoli, a coastal city now in eastern Libya. It was part of an effort to destroy the Barbary pirates and end piracy between warring tribes by the Barbary states, which were themselves member states of the Ottoman Empire. The opening line of the &quot;Marines&#x27; Hymn&quot; refers to this action: &quot;From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli...&quot;.

<text>Daniel Abdal-Hayy Moore (July 30, 1940, Oakland, California – April 18, 2016, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) was a U.S. poet, essayist and librettist. In 1970 he converted to the Sufi tradition of Islam and changed his name to Abdal-Hayy (eventually merging it with his birth-name).

<text>James Murphy (born 25 February 1973) is an English physiotherapist and former professional footballer. He played as a left-back.

Manchester-born Murphy began his career at Blackpool in 1990, where he was mainly a deputy to Mitch Cook. In five years at Bloomfield Road, the defender made 77 league appearances and scored four goals. He appeared as a substitute for Mike Davies in Blackpool&#x27;s Division Four play-off final victory against Scunthorpe United on 23 May 1992 at Wembley.

In 1995, Murphy was released by &quot;Seasiders&quot;&#x27; manager Sam Allardyce. He joined Doncaster Rovers, with whom he remained for two years.

His next stop was Cambridge United. He signed a rolling contract with the U&#x27;s, but left the club after only three months.

In November 1997 Murphy signed for Halifax Town. He made 83 appearances and scored four goals for &quot;the Shaymen&quot; in three years.

Murphy returned to Lancashire in 2000 to join Morecambe, where he played alongside ex-Blackpool teammate Steve McIlhargey. He left &quot;the Shrimps&quot; in 2004 and finished his career with neighbours Lancaster City.

Murphy then went on to do his physiotherapy degree and gained a First class honours at the University of Salford and worked for Bolton Wanderers from 2004 until 2007. He then joined Newcastle United, where he worked as a fitness coach and/or physio.

Murphy was later to return to his hometown of Manchester. He became a Manchester City physio during the time of Mark Hughes&#x27; management and later became head physio; however, during the second season of Roberto Mancini&#x27;s management he stopped being seen acting on match days with the first-team players, although the club later denied he had been demoted or forced to work with the club&#x27;s Academy players. The club confirmed that he was never asked or took any duties within the academy. On 17 February he left the club by mutual consent. It was reported that he received a £250,000 pay-off from the club.

After resigning from his post as head of sports medicine and sports science at Manchester City, he joined Major League Soccer team New York Red Bulls. He currently works as the team&#x27;s performance director.

<text>The general prohibition sign, also known informally as the no symbol, &#x27;do not&#x27; sign, circle-backslash symbol, nay, interdictory circle, prohibited symbol, don&#x27;t do it symbol, or universal no, is a red circle with a 45-degree diagonal line inside the circle from upper-left to lower-right. It is typically overlaid on a pictogram to warn that an activity is not permitted, or has accompanying text to describe what is prohibited. It is a mechanism in graphical form to assert &#x27;drawn norms&#x27;, i.e. to qualify behaviour without the use of words.

==Appearance==
According to the ISO standard (and also under a UK Statutory Instrument), the red area must take up at least 35 percent of the total area of the sign within the outer circumference of the &quot;prohibition sign&quot;. Under the UK rules the width of a &quot;no symbol&quot; is 80 percent the height of the printed area.

For computer display and printing, the symbol is supported in Unicode by combining elements rather than with individual code points (see below).

==Uses==

=== Motor vehicle traffic signage ===
The &quot;prohibition&quot; symbol is used on traffic signs, so that drivers can interpret traffic laws quickly while driving. For example:

* No left turn or No right turn
* No U-turn
* No parking (English) or &quot;No estacionarse&quot; (Spanish)
* Road closed to vehicles (Japan), Road closed to vehicles (Germany, but typical in Europe)

=== Non-motor traffic ===
The symbol&#x27;s use is not limited to informing drivers of motorized vehicles, and is commonly used for other forms of traffic:
* , , No horse-riding
* , , No bicycles
* , , No pedestrians
* , , No animal-drawn vehicles

=== General prohibitions and warnings ===
The symbol is used for non-traffic purposes to warn or prohibit certain activities:

* No smoking (with symbol of a lit cigarette).
* or No littering (with symbol of person littering or of litter)
* No swimming (with symbol of swimmer in water underneath)

=== Packaging and products ===
It is also used on packages sent through the mail and sealed boxes of merchandise that are sold in stores. Using a graphical symbol is useful to convey important warnings regardless of language. For example:

* Breakable; do not drop
* Keep away from magnetic fields

In product documentation, the symbol may be accompanied by drawings of the product being threatened by the prohibited items: for instance, a cartoon of a floppy disk being menaced by horseshoe magnets.

It is also used on clothing, linens, and other household products to indicate the care, treatment or cleaning of the item. For example:

* Do not iron

=== Promotional and advertising ===
Some companies use the &quot;prohibition sign&quot; when describing the services they offer, e.g. an insect deterrent spray brand symbol showing the &quot;prohibition sign&quot; over a mosquito. The &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; logo is a fictional example of this, although it uses a mirror image of the symbol with the slash going from upper right down to lower left.

===Other uses===
It can also be used as a symbol of opposition, to strike out the unwanted item, as in &quot;no airport here!&quot; with a No symbol superimposed on an aeroplane symbol.

==International standards==
The official prohibition sign design characteristics are governed by regional and international standards. The symbol&#x27;s canonical definition comes from the International Organization for Standardization which published ISO 3864-1 in 2002, a revision of a standard first published in 1984. The current version was published in 2011.

ISO 3864-1 sets the rules for the color, shape, and dimensions of safety signage. The regulations include the incorporation of text and pictograms, with reference to materials used, sign size, and viewing conditions. The introduction includes language on the need for using as few words as possible to convey information.

===Design specifics===

The 3864 standard defines the color and design for the prohibition symbol. The verbal definition reads &quot;circle with diagonal bar&quot; with a red safety color, a white contrast color, and black for the graphical symbol (i.e. the pictogram).

====Dimensions per 3864-1====
The symbol is defined as a circle, with the circular band having a thickness of 10% of the outer diameter of the circle. The inner diagonal line has a thickness of 8% of the outer diameter of the circle (i.e. 80% of the circle&#x27;s line width). The diagonal is centered in the circle and at a 45-degree angle going from upper left to lower right. It is recommended to have a white outside border that is 2.5% to 5% of the outer diameter of the circle.

The circle and line are red, the background is white, and the pictogram or descriptive text is black.

====Color red per 3864-1====
The standard defines the range of CIE x,y chromacity coordinates for the color red to be used, relative to the CIE 1931 2° standard observer. They also list equivalent colors for various common color systems such as Munsell, defining red as Munsell 7,5R 4/14.

Relative to CSS colors for the web and sRGB, and assuming a white background of codice_1, the red color should be no lighter than codice_2, and no darker than codice_3, with codice_4 being a useful choice in terms of good contrast and color.

==Variations==

===Non-conforming designs===
Despite the fact that the ISO standard is freely available, it is not uncommon for graphic artists to improvise on the particular color and dimensions. As a result, there is a wide variation of the symbol in common use, for instance using a lower-contrast red than specified in the standard or using the same width for the diagonal line as the circle (the standard specifies the diagonal width is 80% as wide as the circle).

For example, compare (a non-conforming example) with (drawn using the ISO standard).

===Alternate or regional design differences===

Circles with red borders and no slanted or diagonal line are used under the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals to indicate &quot;No entry to vehicles with the following characteristics&quot; (often defined on a plate beneath) such as height, width, mass, or speed. The European Vienna Convention prohibits a diagonal line in the symbol for any sign other than no turning signs. An alternative use for red bordered circles is as a Mandatory Action Symbol type B.

In many jurisdictions (such as Germany), &#x27;no entry&#x27; is indicated by a solid red disc with white horizontal bar. See the general article on Prohibitory traffic signs.

A blue filled circle with an illustration or legend means that a lane is restricted to a particular class of users (such as buses, cyclists, pedestrians) as shown, and no other traffic may use it. In contrast, a blue filled circle without a diagonal line through it is used as a Mandatory Action Symbol, indicating that the activity represented inside the circle is mandatory and must be executed.

==Unicode and fonts==
===Unicode combining character===
The Unicode code point for the prohibition sign is .

There is also , which also represents prohibition. It is a combining character, which means that it appears on top of the character immediately before it.

Example: Putting codice_5 in html will display the letter W inside the prohibition sign: W⃠ (if the user&#x27;s system handles it correctly, which is not always the case).

===Emoji and other unicode versions===
There are also several prohibition sign emojis and related unicode characters:
* 
* &quot;(Japanese sign meaning &quot;prohibited&quot;)&quot;
* 
* 
* 
* 

=== In fonts ===
The symbol appears in a number of different computer fonts, such as Arial Unicode MS, and in dingbat fonts such Webdings and Wingdings 2. These are not necessarily &quot;combining characters.&quot; In the case of Webdings and Wingdings 2, the character encoding does not match the Unicode standard, so if these fonts are not present on the user&#x27;s system, the symbol may not render correctly. This is particularly an issue in webpages. If the page designer wishes to use Webdings for instance, it is important to provide the font resource via the CSS @import font-face command.

==== Similar-appearing symbols ====
There are Unicode code points for other glyphs that look very similar to the &#x27;prohibited&#x27; symbol, but which may be available in more font repertoires: 
* , which is difficult to distinguish from the &#x27;prohibited&#x27; symbol. 

Other glyphs exist but are incorrectly oriented, for example
* 
* 

All of these are spacing characters, which means that they cannot readily be used in combination with a symbol for the action to be prohibited.

<text>The Cairo Trilogy ( &quot;ath-thulathia&quot; (&#x27;The Trilogy&#x27;) or &quot;thulathia al-Qahra&quot;) is a trilogy of novels written by the Egyptian novelist and Nobel Prize in Literature winner Naguib Mahfouz, and one of the major works of his literary career.

The three novels are &quot;Palace Walk&quot; (, &quot;Bayn al-Qasrayn&quot;), first Arabic publication 1956; &quot;Palace of Desire&quot; (, &quot;Qasr al-Shawq&quot;), 1957; and &quot;Sugar Street&quot; (, &quot;Al-Sukkariyya&quot;), 1957.

==Titles==
The three novels&#x27; Arabic titles are taken from the names of actual streets in Cairo, the city of Mahfouz&#x27;s childhood and youth. The first novel, &quot;Bayn al-Qasrayn&quot;, is named after the medieval Cairo street in the Gamaliya district where the strict socially conservative protagonist, Ahmad &#x27;Abd al-Jawad, and his family live. The second novel, &quot;Qasr al-Shawq&quot;, is named after the street where his eldest son Yasin and his family live, and the third, &quot;Al-Sukkariyya&quot;, is named after the street where his daughter Khadijah and her family live.

==Narrative==
The trilogy follows the life of the Cairene patriarch Al-Sayyid (Mr.) Ahmad &#x27;Abd al-Jawad and his family across three generations, from 1919 – the year of Egyptian Revolution against the British colonizers ruling Egypt – to almost the end of the Second World War in 1944. The three novels represent three eras of Cairene socio-political life, a microcosm of early 20th century Egypt, through the life of one well-off Cairo merchant, his children and his grandchildren.

To Kamal, &#x27;Abd al-Jawad&#x27;s youngest son, Mahfouz admits that he gives him some features of himself, as they both got a BA in philosophy from what is now the University of Cairo and have problems with profound contradictions they discern between religious principles and the scientific discoveries of the West.

Seen as a child in the first novel, a university student in the second, and a teacher, not married, in the third, Kamal loses his faith in religion, in love, and in traditions and lives in the second and third novels as an outsider in his own society. He keeps searching for meaning of his life until the last scene, in which Kamal&#x27;s attitude to life changes to the positive as he starts to see himself as &#x27;idealistic&#x27; teacher, future husband and revolutionary man.

Mahfouz sees the development of society as an important influence on the role of women. He represents the traditional, obedient women who do not go to school such as Amina, &#x27;Abd al-Jawad&#x27;s wife, and her daughters in the first novel; women as students in the university such as Aida, Kamal&#x27;s beloved, in the second novel; and women as students in the university, members of the Marxist party and editors of the journal of the party in the third novel.

Throughout the trilogy, Mahfouz develops his theme: social progress will be the inevitable result of the evolutionary spirit of humankind. Time is the major leitmotif in all three books, and its passage is marked in literal and symbolic ways, from the daily pounding of bread dough in the morning, which serves as an alarm clock for the family, to the hourly calls for prayers that ring out from the minarets of Cairo. In the first novel time moves slowly; this story belongs to Kamal, still a child. The permanence of childhood is pronounced, and the minutes often tick by like hours. And yet inevitable changes occur: sisters get married, babies are born, grandparents die, life goes on. The passage of time quickens in the following book, and doubles yet again in the third. By the time the trilogy concludes whole years seem to fly by to the middle-aged Kamal.

==Translations==

The &quot;Cairo Trilogy&quot; was first translated into Hebrew between 1981 and 1987. Mahfouz was very satisfied by this and saw it as another proof that the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty of 1979 should be supported. The English translation was published by Doubleday in the early 1990s. The translators were:
* &quot;Palace Walk&quot; - William M. Hutchins and Olive Kenny
* &quot;Palace of Desire&quot; - Hutchins, Olive Kenny and Lorne Kenny
* &quot;Sugar Street&quot; - Hutchins, Olive Kenny and Angele Botros Samaan

The translation was overseen by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, an editor at Doubleday at the time, and Martha Levin.

<doc id="507655" wikidata="Q4851655" url="?curid=507655" title="Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon">
<text>&quot;Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon&quot; , also known as &quot;The Ballet&quot; and &quot;Make Me Smile Medley&quot;, is a nearly thirteen-minute mini-rock opera/song cycle/suite from Chicago&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;Chicago&quot; (also called &quot;Chicago II&quot;). It was the group&#x27;s first attempt at a long-format multi-part work.

It was composed by James Pankow, who got the inspiration to write the &quot;Ballet&quot; from his love of long classical music song cycles. According to a May 2018 interview with the &quot;Charleston Gazette-Mail&quot;, the songs were written in an attempt to win back his ex-fiancee, Terrie Heisler, who was at the time attending West Virginia Wesleyan College in Buckhannon, West Virginia.

&quot;Ballet&quot; takes up most of side two of &quot;Chicago&quot; and consists of seven tracks, three of which are instrumentals:
:# &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; (Lead vocal by Terry Kath)
:# &quot;So Much to Say, So Much to Give&quot; (Lead vocal by Robert Lamm)
:# &quot;Anxiety&#x27;s Moment&quot; (Instrumental)
:# &quot;West Virginia Fantasies&quot; (Instrumental)
:# &quot;Colour My World&quot; (Lead vocal by Terry Kath)
:# &quot;To Be Free&quot; (Instrumental)
:# &quot;Now More Than Ever&quot; (Lead vocal by Terry Kath)
The final track, &quot;Now More Than Ever,&quot; is a single-verse reprise of the suite&#x27;s opening song, &quot;Make Me Smile.&quot; The vocal songs within the suite can be viewed as telling the story of a man searching for a far away lost love and attempting to rekindle the love they had shared. Two of these songs reached the top ten on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100: a single edit of &quot;Make Me Smile (/Now More Than Ever)&quot; (#9, 1970) and &quot;Colour My World&quot; (#7, 1971).

The instrumental movement &quot;West Virginia Fantasies&quot; incorporates instrumental counterpoint extensively between the horns, guitar, and keyboards, exemplifying Chicago&#x27;s skill at composing and arranging complex pieces.

The suite was recorded as a single track, titled &quot;The Ballet,&quot; on their album &quot;Chicago XXVI: Live in Concert&quot; in 1999. The version on the 2005 DVD &quot;Chicago &amp; Earth, Wind &amp; Fire — Live at the Greek Theatre&quot; is called &quot;Make Me Smile Medley,&quot; named after the suite&#x27;s opening song.

<text>Carl Diem (24 June 1882 – 17 December 1962) was a German sports administrator, and as a Secretary General of the Organizing Committee of the Berlin Olympic Games, he was also the chief organizer of the 1936 Olympic Summer Games.

He created the tradition of the Olympic torch relay when he organised the 1936 build-up event, and was an influential historian of sport, particularly the Olympic games.

== Biography ==
Born into an upper-middle-class family, Diem was a middle- and long-distance runner as a teenager – unusual in a country where gymnastic-style athletics was fashionable, rather than what were known as &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; athletics. He showed an early gift for organizing, founding his first athletic club, called &quot;Marcomannia&quot;, in 1899. As a young man, Diem originally pursued a career in sales, but also began to write articles for sporting newspapers. At the age of twenty, he was hired by the German Sports Authority for Athletics (the &quot;Deutsche Sportbehörde für Athletik&quot;, or DSBfA), and a year later was elected to its board of directors. Diem was an ardent believer in the heroic Olympian ideal, and in the contributions that international sport could foster harmony between nations. In this regard (and others) he was a fervent disciple of Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the International Olympic Committee and father of the modern international Olympiad.

In 1906, Diem began his Olympic career, leading the German contingent of athletes to the Athens games (for reasons that are not entirely clear, the German delegation entered the stadium first in the parade of athletes). In 1909, the games for the summer of 1912 were awarded to Stockholm, but the IOC made it clear that Diem and his fellow organizers could expect to hold the 1916 games in Berlin. In 1912 he initiated the award of the German Sports Badge, following the example of a Swedish award encountered during the Stockholm Olympics.

Diem threw himself into preparations for the 1916 games. His principal partner in this and most of his Olympic endeavors was Theodor Lewald, who was for many years chairman of the German Olympic Committee. In the summer of 1914, Diem and Lewald were planning their spectacular 1916 Olympiad when World War I erupted, and the Berlin games were subsequently cancelled. Diem enlisted in the German army and served in Belgium and France. He was wounded at Saint-Quentin, recovered, and fought at both Champagne and the Argonne.

After the war, Olympic officials penalized Germany by excluding them from the 1920 and 1924 games. Diem and Lewald, who had returned to their sports-organizing duties, lobbied successfully to win permission for a German team to compete in the 1928 games in Amsterdam. With support from the state, Diem also founded the &quot;Deutsche Hochschule für Leibesübungen&quot;, a school dedicated to the study of the science of sport. He was a great admirer of American athletic programs, and in 1929 toured the US for five weeks with Lewald. During this trip he formed a friendship with Avery Brundage, an American Olympic official who would play a major role in the controversy over the 1936 Olympics (and in Olympic history for decades to come). In 1938, Diem was elected as a Corresponding Fellow in the prestigious American Academy of Physical Education (now known as the National Academy of Kinesiology). In 1955, his wife, Liselott Diem, was also elected into the Academy as a Corresponding Fellow.

==Olympics in Berlin==

Carl Diem became the secretary of the all-German sports organization (DRL), the forerunner of the Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund für Leibesübungen (NSRL), the Sports Organ of the Third Reich.

In April 1931, again largely due to the reputation and lobbying efforts of Diem and Lewald, Berlin was selected to host the 1936 summer games, and Diem was named Secretary General of the Organizing Committee. He attended the 1932 games in Los Angeles, carefully observing the host city&#x27;s preparations and facilities, committed to meeting or outdoing the American accomplishment in Berlin four years later.

Dr. Theodor Lewald, Diem&#x27;s boss as President of the Olympic Committee and IOC Member, set up an Organizing Committee for the Olympic games, five days before the elections that resulted in Hitler being elected the new chancellor. The rise of Adolf Hitler to power in 1933 once again threatened Diem&#x27;s dream of a Berlin Olympiad: Nazism did not embrace international sport, and Hitler himself had dismissed the Olympics as a project of &quot;Jews and Freemasons.&quot;

Five days after the swearing-in of the new Ministers, Theodor Lewald had an appointment with Joseph Goebbels, the new Minister of Propaganda. Lewald, a former Under-secretary of state was well connected inside the whole administration and able to get an appointment. He convinced Goebbels that this was a once in a lifetime propaganda opportunity. Goebbels convinced Hitler, who informed Diem and Lewald that he would support the Games. Six months later, after touring the construction sites for the sporting arenas, he told Diem that the German state would pay the bills.

Instead of a balanced budget, which Diem had proposed in late 1932, new sporting facilities were built, the underground train extended to the stadium site. The amount of money provided by the government was about twenty times higher than the original budget. Diem used the opportunity to quadruple his own salary.

The Nazis embraced the Olympic Games not only because they promised to be a unique opportunity to extol the virtues of their &quot;reborn&quot; state; as a celebration of physical prowess, the games also dovetailed neatly with the Nazi idealization of youth, fitness and athleticism. Further, according to Nazi racial theories, their own Aryan &quot;superiorities&quot; were descended from the great achievements of ancient Greece.

Despite the official Nazi support for the games, Diem&#x27;s position as organizer was at risk, mostly because his &quot;Hochschule&quot; employed Jewish teachers and because Diem&#x27;s wife, Liselott, came from a Jewish family. He himself was classified, for these reasons, as a &quot;white Jew&quot;, but even so, Diem managed to hold on to his job and solidify his position with his Nazi patrons. His boss Theodor Lewald, who had given up his post as President of the German Sports Body in 1933 before the Nazis could remove him, clung to the newly created position of President of the Organizing Committee. (Lewald&#x27;s father was a prominent lawyer who was Jewish. Lewald had to arrange himself with Hans von Tschammer und Osten, the new President of the National Olympic Committee, but even more so with Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick (whose Ministry had been in charge of elite sport since 1914.)

American IOC Member Gen. Charles Sherrill had a one-hour interview with Hitler in which Sherrill not only asked Hitler for an autograph, but demanded the participation of at least one token Jew on the German teams for the Winter and Summer Games – or the Games would be cancelled. Hitler strongly rejected this &quot;friendly&quot; advice, shouting that if the worst came to the worst, the Olympic games would be staged for Germans only. The Nazi establishment went out of their way to assure the world that &quot;non-Aryan&quot; participants were being allowed to compete – and kept Jewish Olympic hopefuls in national training camps.

The American Olympic Association remained sceptical about the Nazis&#x27; openness to non-Aryan competitors, and a movement to boycott the Berlin games began to gather steam among U.S. Olympic officials. Diem&#x27;s old friend Avery Brundage, president of the American Olympic Committee, was dispatched to appraise the facts; in Berlin, Diem convinced Brundage that Jews were not being excluded, though he likely knew otherwise. Brundage returned to the U.S. and, defeating the boycott&#x27;s supporters, helped to ensure that a full American athletic delegation would attend the games in Berlin. With the first edition of the Nuremberg Laws (September 1935), excluding Jews from public life, &quot;Half-Jews&quot; (no more than two of the four grandparents racially of Jewish descent) were still permitted in public life but not in the civil service. This gave Lewald the opportunity to preside over the Opening Ceremony next to Hitler, allowed Rudi Ball to play hockey in the Winter games, and permitted Helene Mayer to fence (and win a silver medal) in the Summer Games. Jewish Germans were, however, excluded.

Diem held high posts in the Third Reich&#x27;s sports organization even after the Olympics, becoming the leader of the Foreign Department of the National Socialist Sports Office (the aforementioned NSRL) in 1939. As such he was responsible for the management of German athletes in foreign countries, as well as for the international affairs of the NSRL. With his good relations with the IOC, Diem succeeded in having the 1940 Winter Olympics scheduled for Garmisch-Partenkirchen, despite the fact that the previous Winter Olympics had been held there, and that Germany had already invaded Czechoslovakia at the time the decision was made. The 1940 Winter Olympics were cancelled following Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland.

== Torch Relay ==
There is a controversy as to who invented the Olympic torch relay. According to the &quot;Official Report&quot;, a Mr Haeggert, administrator of the Propaganda Minister on the Propaganda Committee of the Summer Games, invented the propaganda stunt to raise public awareness in the last weeks prior to the games, and Diem was merely told to work out the details. On the other hand, Diem himself claimed that it was his idea all along. On a visit to Greece for an Olympic conference in 1934, Diem and Lewald imagined a new symbolic pageant that would cloak the German games with the ancient Greek mantle: the transit of a lit Olympic flame from Greece to Berlin by a relay of torch-bearing runners. While the relay is sometimes believed to be an ancient tradition, it was in fact the wholly modern creation of Lewald and Diem; the ancient games included a ritual flame commemorating the theft of fire from the gods by Prometheus, but not a torch relay. Diem had been organizing long-distance road relays ever since 1910.

On 30 June 1936, the first torch-flame was kindled in Olympia, Greece, in the ruins of the Temple of Hera, by 15 robed &quot;virgins,&quot; using a concave mirror focusing the sun&#x27;s rays, all under the supervision of a &quot;high priestess.&quot; It was carried to the Acropolis in Athens for a special invocation, and then relayed along the 3,422-kilometer distance to the Olympic stadium in Berlin by an equal number of young Aryan-looking runners, each of whom took the flame a single kilometer.

On its way, the flame passed through Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austria and Czechoslovakia; those countries, and Greece itself, would all be under Nazi domination within ten years. The event was filmed by Hitler&#x27;s favorite director, Leni Riefenstahl, and branded with the giants of German industry: the lighting-mirrors were made by the Zeiss corporation, and the torches themselves, fueled with magnesium to prevent them from going out in bad weather, were constructed by Krupp, the huge steel and munitions conglomerate that armed Germany for both world wars.

The final leg of the relay was completed on 1 August by Fritz Schilgen, a German electrical engineer and national champion runner, who ran into the stadium and lit the Olympic cauldron to open the games. Schilgen was not actually competing; he was selected by officials, including Riefenstahl, for the grace and aesthetic appeal of his running style. Diem was in Hitler&#x27;s party as the Fuehrer presided over the ceremony; when Hitler strode across the stadium to his official box, a five-year-old girl presented him with a bouquet of flowers. The child was Diem&#x27;s daughter, Gudrun.

The tradition of a torch relay from Greece to the host country of the Olympic games has been continued at every Olympiad since then. Even the ritual kindling of the flame with a mirror on the grounds of the Temple of Hera remains virtually intact as the official method of starting the relay.

== Legacy ==
In March 1945, as the Red Army was closing in on Berlin in the final weeks of the Second World War, Diem staged another event in the city&#x27;s Olympic stadium. Addressing a rally of thousands of teenage Hitler Youth, Diem exhorted them to defend the capital to the death, in the spirit of the ancient Spartans. Some two thousand of the young men assembled there did exactly that, sacrificing themselves before Berlin finally fell in May.

After the conclusion of the war, Diem was quickly rehabilitated into the mainstream of the newly democratic Federal Republic of Germany. He was acting Director of the Berlin University Physical Education Department. When Bernhard Zimmermann, who had emigrated to Scotland in 1938, declined to become the Rector of a new National Sport College in the British Zone (Cologne), Diem received the job. He returned to his career as a historian of German sport and the Olympic games. In 1960, he published an authoritative general history of sport. At his death in 1962 in Cologne, he was once again a respected national figure. The Carl Diem Institute at the German Sports University was created in his honor, and run by his wife, Liselott, until 1989. After her death in 1992, the institute was renamed the Carl and Liselott Diem Archive. Diem remains the most influential historian of sports in Germany.

The full nature of Diem&#x27;s relations with the Nazi apparatus is complex. His career in national sport preceded the Nazi regime by decades, and he was appointed to organize the 1936 games years before Hitler decided to put his own indelible mark on the Berlin competition. But like many career professionals who chose to accept Nazi patronage, Diem&#x27;s legacy was irreversibly tarnished by proximity to his masters. His earlier writings did occasionally embrace popular ideas about racial superiority; he clung to his prominent national positions during the Nazi period, and he took part in war propaganda, including the Berlin rally near the war&#x27;s end. Richard Mandell, author of the 1971 book &quot;The Nazi Olympics&quot;, was critical of Diem; in a reprint of the book, he defended his position, writing: &quot;Recently, some careful German researchers have uncovered documents showing that Carl Diem&#x27;s complicity with the Nazis went beyond his confessed use of them to promote sport. With his Nazi connections he settled brutally some old scores, and he stayed with the Nazis on ideological grounds long after their savagery was exposed and after their coming defeat was apparent to all.&quot; And yet even Mandell did not dispute that Diem was &quot;the greatest sports historian and most profound theorist of sport education&quot; of the 20th century.

During Diem&#x27;s final years, there was open controversy about his Nazi connections. For example, in 1954 the French ministry of Education postponed a display of gymnastics before a delegation headed by Diem (then head of the Sportschule at Cologne), after students claimed that Diem had been a &quot;Nazi general.&quot; Two days later, the students recanted, and admitted that there was no &quot;formal proof&quot; of the allegation. In the 1990s, a public debate erupted in Germany over his legacy, and whether streets named in his honor should be renamed because of the taint of the Nazi years. In 1948, when Diem attempted to become an IOC Member (Lewald had died in 1947), the IOC rejected him. By the IOC standards of the time he was not considered a &quot;gentleman&quot;; he had worked only for hire and never in an honorary function.

<doc id="507659" wikidata="Q1851926" url="?curid=507659" title="Alley Cat (video game)">
<text>Alley Cat is a video game created by Bill Williams and published by Synapse Software for Atari 8-bit computers in 1983. The player controls Freddy the Cat, who enters people&#x27;s homes through open windows to perform various tasks in order to reach his love, Felicia. A port for the IBM PC as a self-booting disk and the IBM PCjr were published in 1984 by IBM. These use four-color CGA graphics.

&quot;Alley Cat&quot; was based on a one-screen prototype by John Harris. Harris had become unhappy with the direction of the game and handed it over to Williams who expanded the concept into a finished game.

==Gameplay==

In the main screen, which is the alley, the player is presented with a tall fence in front of an apartment building with several windows. Each window periodically opens to throw out random objects (a phone, shoe, etc.). Every once in a while a dog may come running along the bottom edge of the screen. If the cat touches this dog, they get into a fight and one life is taken away.

By jumping and climbing trash cans, the fence, and clotheslines, the cat can enter various rooms through the open windows. Each room contains one of several challenges:

* In one room there&#x27;s a table with a birdcage on it in the middle of the room. Here the objective is to push the birdcage off the table and then catch the bird which escapes from the broken cage.
* In another room, there&#x27;s a fishbowl which the cat can enter and must eat all the fish while dodging electric eels and repeatedly coming up for air to avoid drowning.
* Another room contains a huge chunk of cheese with a number of holes. In each hole mice appear randomly, which the cat must catch.
* The cat may also find itself in a room with a number of sleeping dogs, some of which have feeding dishes in front of them. The cat must empty each dish without waking up any of the dogs.
* In another challenge, the cat must collect three ferns from the top of a bookshelf while avoiding a disproportionately large spider that may lower itself upon the cat from above.


Most rooms have a broomstick that constantly moves around the screen. The cat can keep the broom busy by making footprints on the ground (at the bottom edge of the screen). When there are no footprints, the broom will constantly chase after the cat.

The broom is harmless in the sense that it never kills the cat, but it pushes the cat around, enough to make it more difficult if it is not kept busy. In particular, the broom might often throw the cat right at the above-mentioned dog or spider, or throw it right back out of the window.

Successful completion of the challenge is awarded with a number of points proportional to the time taken to complete it. The player then returns to the alley where open windows now show a female cat calling him.

Upon entering such a window, the player encounters a room in which there are several platforms (a bit like shelves) made out of valentine hearts on which other cats walk left and right. The object is to reach the cat at the top while maneuvering around the other cats, which cause the player to fall a level if touched.

Each platform has areas the player can stand on as well as areas where they fall through (the other cats, however, never fall through). These areas are hearts which switch between normal and broken as they are touched by heart-shaped arrows that are constantly shot diagonally across the screen by cherubs on either side of the screen. These arrows also cause the player to fall down a level.

There are also gifts on the bottom row that can be used to eliminate an unfriendly cat for a short period of time. If the player falls from the bottom row, they fail and must return to the alley and complete another task.

If the cat manages to kiss the female cat in the special room, the level advances by one and the player gains an extra life. The game&#x27;s difficulty level continues to increase until the multiplier reaches level 30, at which point it stays the same. Gameplay at this level can continue indefinitely, but running out of lives means game over.

==Reception==
Describing &quot;Alley Cat&quot; as &quot;a challenging and interesting game with something of a storybook quality to it&quot;, &quot;Antic&quot; in 1985 praised its &quot;really superb&quot; graphics. The magazine concluded that it &quot;is simply a lot of fun to play!&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 2006, the first fan remake &quot;Alley Cat 2&quot; made its debut. An unofficial fan remake entitled &quot;Alley Cat Remeow Edition&quot; was freely released in 2018.

<text>Playdium is a family entertainment centre chain owned by Cineplex Entertainment. It currently consists of four locations. 

==History==
Playdium first launched on September 7, 1996, opening its first location in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada as Sega City @ Playdium. It was located near the Square One Shopping Centre and served as the chain&#x27;s flagship location. The centre cost CA$17 million to build and included an arcade, batting cages, go-karts and mini-golf. A partnership with Sega GameWorks, it featured many arcade games from that company such as Daytona USA, and eight-player racing setups for &quot;Indy 500&quot; (as &quot;Virtua Indy&quot;) and &quot;Manx TT Super Bike&quot;. In 1999, the centre was renamed to Playdium. 

At its peak, the chain operated four Playdium locations: Mississauga (next to the Square One Shopping Centre), Toronto (next to Scotiabank Theatre Toronto), Edmonton (inside the West Edmonton Mall) and Burnaby (inside Metropolis at Metrotown and host of official &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; tournaments in 2000 and 2001). Though the Playdium brand did exist in smaller arcades that are now known as Cinescape or Xscape. The Rec Room is a spiritual successor to Playdium near the former Toronto location and at the former West Edmonton Mall location. A new Rec Room location took over the former Target at Square One Shopping Centre in 2019. Despite this, future plans regarding the nearby Playdium location have yet to be announced. The company also operates The Playdium Store, which retails arcade games and various other home entertainment solutions. 

In October 2017, Cineplex announced the relaunch of the Playdium brand, with plans to open 10 to 15 locations nationwide. The first location under the relaunch opened in Brampton in September 2019, followed by a location in Whitby in November 2019. On October 15, 2020, it was announced that Playdium would permanently close its original location in Mississauga on November 1 due to redevelopment of the area however its locations in Brampton and Whitby would remain open. On February 20, 2021, Playdium opened its third location at Dartmouth Crossing in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. In December 2024 Playdium opened its fourth location at Fairview Mall in Toronto.

==Operations==
The original main building in Mississauga was and included over 200 attractions. Some arcade games include &quot;Mario Kart Arcade GP DX&quot;, &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion Arcade&quot;, &quot;Pac-Man&#x27;s Arcade Party&quot; and two &quot;Pump It Up&quot; machines (&quot;Pump It Up 2017 Prime 2&quot; and &quot;Pump It Up 2015 Prime&quot;). The arcade was previously curated into themed &quot;communities&quot; such as Contact, Music, Speed and Sports, but this is no longer the case. Play credit and tickets for games are loaded on a digital game card and can be purchased in units to use at any time or in time blocks of two hours. While all games require credit, redemption games cannot use time blocks and may also award digital tickets to successful players. A few other machines also cannot use time blocks. Cards from Player One brands are not interchangeable. For example, a Playdium card cannot be used at Xscape, or vice versa.

A baseball dome, formerly with a Toronto Blue Jays partnership, operated year-round and had nine variable-speed batting cages. There was also a Megabytes fast food restaurant on the gaming floor and a full-service mezzanine diner. Megabytes featured marketing similar to Cineplex concession stands and OutTakes restaurants, though at lower prices, while also incorporating a selection of Pizza Pizza and Starbucks menu items. Past cross-promotional partners included HMV Canada, the Toronto Blue Jays (indoor batting cages, baseball camps, and coupons on Blue Jays tickets), the Molson Indy Toronto (the outdoor go-kart track was formerly known as the Mario Andretti Racetrack), and Roots (the lounge was formerly known as the &quot;Roots Treehouse&quot;). The outdoors also include an 18-hole miniature golf, and &quot;Water Wars&quot;.

===Playdium Movie Magic===
Playdium Movie Magic was a DVD video rental shop that operated using automated retail kiosks. It launched in early 2011 and closed in late 2016. Competitors included Le SuperClub Vidéotron, Redbox and Zip.ca kiosks. Contrary to these, Playdium rentals were location-specific and could only be returned at the original kiosk where the DVD was rented.

<text>Brigg Town Football Club CIC is a football club based in Brigg, Lincolnshire, England. They are currently members of the and play at the Hawthorns. Established in 1864, they are one of the oldest football clubs in the world.

==History==
The club was established in 1864. In 1881–82 they entered the inaugural Lincolnshire Senior Cup, reaching the final where they lost to Spilsby. They reached the final again the following season, again losing to Spilsby. They joined the Lindsey League and in 1948 became founder members of the Lincolnshire League. They won the league in 1949–50, 1953–54, 1968–69, 1969–70, 1970–71, 1971–72, 1973–74 and 1975–76 and were runners-up in 1950–51, 1961–62, 1963–64, 1965–66, 1974–75.

After their eighth title in 1976, Brigg moved up to the Midland League and were placed in the Premier Division. After finishing third in their first season in the league, they were champions in 1977–78. When the league merged with the Yorkshire League to form the Northern Counties East League in 1982, Brigg were placed in Division One South. They were relegated to Division Two South at the end of the league&#x27;s first season, but finished as runners-up the following season, earning promotion to Division One Central. League reorganisation in 1985 saw them placed in Division One, and they were promoted to the Premier Division at the end of the 1985–86 season despite only finishing twelfth.

In 1995–96 Brigg reached the final of the FA Vase, beating Clitheroe 3–0 at Wembley Stadium to lift the trophy. After finishing as Premier Division runners-up in 1999–2000, Brigg were champions in 2000–01, but were unable to take promotion due to the Hawthorns not being up to the required standard. They were runners-up again for the next two seasons, and in 2001–02 they reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 4–1 at Tranmere Rovers. In 2002–03 they reached the FA Vase final again and won the trophy for a second time with a 2–1 win against AFC Sudbury in a match played at Upton Park. A third-place finish in 2003–04 saw them promoted to Division One of the Northern Premier League. When the league was reorganised in 2007 they were placed in Division One South

Brigg were relegated back to the Premier Division of the Northern Counties East League at the end of the 2014–15 season after finishing bottom of Division One South. The 2015–16 season saw them relegated again, this time to Division One of the Northern Counties East League. In 2017–18 they finished second-from-bottom of Division One and were relegated to the Lincolnshire League. In 2018–19 the club won the Lincolnshire Junior Cup, defeating Horncastle Town 3–1 in the final, and were runners-up in the Lincolnshire League, resulting in promotion back to Division One of the Northern Counties East League. The 2021–22 season saw them win the Lincolnshire Senior Trophy with a 1–0 win over Winterton Rangers.

==Ground==
The club played at the Old Manor House Convent playing fields on Station Road until 1939. They then moved to Brocklesby Ox, where the club&#x27;s record attendance of 2,000 against Boston United was set in 1953. In 1959 they moved to the Hawthorns.

<text>Fantasia 2000 is a 1999 American animated musical anthology film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation. Produced by Roy E. Disney and Donald W. Ernst, it is the sequel to Disney&#x27;s 1940 animated feature film &quot;Fantasia&quot;. Like its predecessor, &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; consists of animated segments set to pieces of classical music. Segments are introduced by celebrities including Steve Martin, Itzhak Perlman, Quincy Jones, Bette Midler, James Earl Jones, Penn &amp; Teller, James Levine, and Angela Lansbury in live action scenes directed by Don Hahn.

After numerous unsuccessful attempts to develop a &quot;Fantasia&quot; sequel, The Walt Disney Company revived the idea shortly after Michael Eisner became chief executive officer in 1984. Development paused until the commercial success of the 1991 home video release of &quot;Fantasia&quot; convinced Eisner that there was enough public interest and funds for a sequel, to which he assigned Disney as executive producer. The music for six of the film&#x27;s eight segments is performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by James Levine. The film includes &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; from the 1940 original. Each new segment was produced by combining traditional animation with computer-generated imagery. &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; is part of the Disney Renaissance, and also commemorates Walt Disney&#x27;s third animated feature film.

&quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; premiered on December 17, 1999, at Carnegie Hall in New York City as part of a concert tour that also visited London, Paris, Tokyo, and Pasadena, California. The film was then released in 75 IMAX theaters worldwide from January 1 to April 30, 2000, marking the first major Hollywood motion picture to be released in IMAX and also the first feature-length animated film to be released in the format. Its general release in regular theaters followed on June 16, 2000. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised several of its sequences, while also deeming its overall quality uneven in comparison to its predecessor. However, budgeted at about $80–$85 million, the film only grossed $90.9 million worldwide, making it a box office flop.

==Program==

# &quot;Symphony No. 5&quot; by Ludwig van Beethoven. The film begins with the sound of an orchestra tuning and Deems Taylor&#x27;s introduction from &quot;Fantasia&quot;. Panels showing various segments from &quot;Fantasia&quot; fly in outer space and form the set and stage for an orchestra. Musicians take their seats and tune up as animators and artists draw at their desks before James Levine approaches the conductor&#x27;s podium and signals the beginning of the piece. In the segment proper, abstract patterns and shapes that resemble hundreds of colorful triangle-shaped butterflies in dozens of magentas, reds, oranges, yellows, greens, cyans, turquoises, blues, indigos, violets, purples, pinks, grays, whites, and browns in various shades, tints, tones, and hues explore a world of light and darkness whilst being pursued by a swarm of dark black pentagon or hexagon-shaped bats. The world is ultimately conquered by light and color.
# &quot;Pines of Rome&quot; by Ottorino Respighi. A family of humpback whales are able to fly. The calf is separated from his parents, and becomes trapped in an iceberg. Eventually, he finds his way out with his mother&#x27;s help. The family join a larger pod of whales, who fly and frolic through the clouds to emerge into outer space. Introduced by Steve Martin, who gives a brief history on &quot;Fantasia&quot;″s original purpose, after which Itzhak Perlman introduces the segment proper.
# &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; by George Gershwin. Set in New York City in the 1930s, and designed in the style of Al Hirschfeld&#x27;s known caricatures of the time, the story follows four individuals who wish for a better life. Duke is a construction worker who dreams of becoming a jazz drummer; Joe is a down-on-his-luck unemployed man who wishes he could get a job; Rachel is a little girl who wants to spend time with her busy parents instead of being shuttled around by her governess; and John is a harried rich husband who longs for a simpler, more fun life. The segment ends with all four getting their wish, though their stories interact with each other&#x27;s without any of them knowing. Introduced by Quincy Jones with pianist Ralph Grierson.
# &quot;Piano Concerto No. 2, Allegro, Opus 102&quot; by Dmitri Shostakovich. Based on the fairy tale &quot;The Steadfast Tin Soldier&quot; by Hans Christian Andersen, a broken toy soldier with one leg falls in love with a toy ballerina and protects her from an evil jack-in-the-box. Unlike the original story, this version has a happy ending. Introduced by Bette Midler featuring pianist Yefim Bronfman.
# &quot;The Carnival of the Animals (Le Carnival des Animaux), Finale&quot; by Camille Saint-Saëns. A flock of flamingoes tries to force a slapstick member, who enjoys playing with a yo-yo, to engage in the flock&#x27;s &quot;dull&quot; routines. Introduced by James Earl Jones with animator Eric Goldberg.
# &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice (Reprise)&quot; by Paul Dukas. Based on the 1797 poem &quot;Der Zauberlehrling&quot; by Goethe, the segment is the only one featured in both &quot;Fantasia&quot; and &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;. It tells the story of Mickey Mouse, an apprentice of sorcerer Yen Sid who attempts some of his master&#x27;s magic tricks before knowing how to control them. Introduced by Penn &amp; Teller rather than using an archived recording of Deems Taylor introducing the segment as in the original film. The scene where Mickey shakes hands with Levine&#x27;s predecessor Leopold Stokowski is like that in the original film but Mickey is now voiced by Wayne Allwine instead of Walt Disney. This outro leads directly to the intro for &quot;Pomp and Circumstance&quot;, with Donald Duck and Daisy Duck voiced by Tony Anselmo and Russi Taylor, respectively.
# &quot;Pomp and Circumstance – Marches 1, 2, 3 and 4&quot; by Sir Edward Elgar. Based on the story of Noah&#x27;s Ark from the Book of Genesis, Donald Duck is Noah&#x27;s assistant and Daisy Duck is Donald&#x27;s girlfriend. Donald is given the task of gathering the animals to the Ark, and misses, loses, and reunites with Daisy in the process. Introduced by James Levine.
# &quot;Firebird Suite—1919 Version&quot; by Igor Stravinsky. A Sprite is awoken by her companion, an elk, and accidentally wakes a fiery spirit of destruction in a nearby volcano who destroys the forest and seemingly the Sprite. The Sprite survives and the elk encourages her to restore the forest to its normal state. Introduced by Angela Lansbury.

==Production==
===Development===

In 1940, Walt Disney released &quot;Fantasia&quot;, his third animated feature film, consisting of eight animated segments set to pieces of classical music. Initially he planned to have the film on continual release with new segments replacing older ones so audiences would never see the same film twice. The idea was dropped following the film&#x27;s initial low box office receipts and a mixed response from critics. Following preliminary work on new segments, the idea was shelved by 1942 and was not revisited for the remainder of Disney&#x27;s life. In 1980, animators Wolfgang Reitherman and Mel Shaw started preliminary work on &quot;Musicana&quot;, a feature film &quot;mixing jazz, classical music, myths, modern art ... following the old &quot;Fantasia&quot; format&quot; that was to present &quot;ethnic tales from around the world with the music of the various countries&quot;. The project was cancelled in favor of &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (1983).
The idea of a &quot;Fantasia&quot; sequel was revived shortly after Michael Eisner became chief executive officer of The Walt Disney Company in 1984, when Walt&#x27;s nephew, vice chairman Roy E. Disney, suggested it to him at a lunch. The idea had first entered Disney&#x27;s mind ten years earlier, and he recalled Eisner&#x27;s reaction: &quot;It was as if a big light bulb went on over his head. The idea was enticing, but we didn&#x27;t have the resources to carry it out&quot;. However, Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg showed a lack of interest in the film. He had once asked André Previn to work on a &quot;Fantasia&quot; film but Previn declined after he learned it was to feature songs by the Beatles rather than classical music. Eisner approached Leonard Bernstein with the same idea, but while he seemed enthusiastic, Bernstein died before production began. It took a further seven years before the film was reconsidered, after the 1990 reissue of &quot;Fantasia&quot; grossed $25 million domestically and the announcement of its limited availability on home video in 1991 prompted 9.25 million pre-orders. Disney saw its commercial success as a sign that there was enough public interest in the &quot;Fantasia&quot; franchise to make a sequel. Eisner finally gave the green-light to the film in 1991, and had Disney serve as executive producer on the basis that its production was funded by the proceeds from the video sales. Disney assigned Donald W. Ernst as producer and Hendel Butoy as supervisory director, having liked his work on &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; (1990).

During the search for a suitable conductor, Disney and Walt Disney Feature Animation president Thomas Schumacher invited Metropolitan Opera conductor James Levine and manager Peter Gelb to a meeting in September 1991. Disney recalled: &quot;I asked James what his thought was on a three minute version of Beethoven&#x27;s fifth symphony. He paused and went &#x27;I think the right three minutes would be beautiful&#x27;&quot;. In November 1992, Disney, Schumacher, Levine, Gelb, and Butoy met in Vienna to discuss a collection of story reels developed, one of them being &quot;Pines of Rome&quot;, which Levine took an immediate liking to. Butoy described Levine&#x27;s enthusiasm toward the film as &quot;like a kid in a candy store&quot;. Because Katzenberg continued to express some hostility towards the film, Disney held development meetings without him and reported directly to Eisner instead, something that author James B. Stewart wrote &quot;would have been unthinkable on any other future animation project.&quot;

Production began under the working title of &quot;Fantasia Continued&quot; with a release in 1997. The title was changed to &quot;Fantasia 1999&quot;, followed by &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; to coincide with its theatrical release in 2000. Disney formed its initial running order with half of the &quot;Fantasia&quot; program and only &quot;three or four new numbers&quot; with the aim of releasing a &quot;semi-new movie&quot;. Realizing the idea would not work, he kept three &quot;Fantasia&quot; segments—&quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, &quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot;, and &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot;—in the program for &quot;quite a while&quot;. &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; was the most difficult segment for him to remove from his original running order because it was one of his favorites. He had placed it in the middle of the film without &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, but felt it did not work and scrapped the idea. Later on, &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot; was dropped and &quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot; was replaced by &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; during the last few months of production following the response from numerous test screenings. Disney kept &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; in the final program as a homage to &quot;Fantasia&quot;. The segment underwent digital restoration by Cinesite in Los Angeles. Disney considered using &quot;Clair de Lune&quot;, a piece originally made for &quot;Fantasia&quot; that followed two Great white herons flying through the Everglades at night, but thought it was &quot;pretty boring&quot;. An idea to have &quot;a nightmare and a dream struggling for a sleeping child&#x27;s soul&quot; to &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot; by Sergei Rachmaninoff was fully storyboarded, but fell through.

===Segments===
====&quot;Symphony No. 5&quot;====
&quot;Symphony No. 5&quot; is an abstract segment created by Pixote Hunt with story development by Kelvin Yasuda. In December 1997, after rejecting pitches from four other animators, Disney and Ernst asked Hunt for his ideas. Hunt first thought of the story on a morning walk in Pasadena, California, one depicting a battle of &quot;good&quot; against &quot;evil&quot; and how the conflict resolves itself. It took Hunt approximately two years, from start to finish, to complete the segment. Disney and Ernst decided to go with Hunt&#x27;s idea; Hunt avoided producing an entirely abstract work because &quot;you can get something abstract on every computer screen&quot; with ease. Hunt divided the segment into 31 mini-scenes, noting down points in which he would employ vivid color when the music was bright and fluid, and then switch to darker hues when the music felt darker and denser. To gain inspiration in how the shapes would move, Hunt and his associates visited San Diego Zoo, a butterfly farm, and observed slow motion footage of bats. The segment combines hand drawn backgrounds using pastels and paint that were scanned into the Computer Animation Production System (CAPS), and computer-generated imagery (CGI) of abstract shapes and effects, which were layered on top. Hunt explained that scanning each drawing &quot;was a one-shot deal&quot; as the platen that pressed onto it would alter the pastel once it had been scanned. At one point during production, Hunt and Yasuda completed 68 pastel drawings in eight days. The segment was produced using Houdini animation software.

====&quot;Pines of Rome&quot;====
&quot;Pines of Rome&quot; was the first piece Disney suggested for the film, as well as the first to be animated; designs appeared in the studio&#x27;s dailies as early as October 1993. Butoy served as director with James Fujii handling the story. The opening to the piece gave Disney the idea of &quot;something flying&quot;. Butoy sketched the sequence on yellow Post-it notes. The story originally involved the whales flying around from the perspective of a group of penguins, but the idea was scrapped to make the baby whale a central character. The whales were also set to return to Earth but Butoy said it &quot;never felt quite right&quot;, leading to the decision to have them break through a cloud ceiling and enter a different world by the supernova. Butoy created a &quot;musical intensity chart&quot; for the animators to follow which &quot;tracked the ups and downs of the music ... as the music brightens so does the color&quot;, and vice versa. He explained that because CGI was in its infancy during development, the first third of the segment was hand drawn using pencil to get a feel of how the whales would move. When the drawings were scanned into the CAPS system, Butoy found the whales were either moving too fast or had less weight to them. The drawings were altered to make the whales slow down and &quot;more believable&quot;. The eyes of the whales were drawn by hand, as the desired looks and glances were not fully achievable using CGI. Butoy recalled the challenge of having the water appear and move as naturally as possible; the team decided to write computer code from scratch as traditional animation would have been too time-consuming and would have produced undesired results. The code handling the pod of whales was written so the whales would move away if they were to collide and not bump into, overlap, or go through each other. The same technique was used for the stampede scene in &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), which was produced at the same time.

====&quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;====

&quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; is the first &quot;Fantasia&quot; segment with music from an American composer. It originated in 1995 when director and animator Eric Goldberg approached Al Hirschfeld about the idea of an animated short set to Gershwin&#x27;s composition in the style of Hirschfeld&#x27;s illustrations. In December 1998, Goldberg pitched &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; to Thomas Schumacher and received the green-light to produce it, and Hirschfeld agreed to serve as artistic consultant and allowed the animators to adapt his works. Duke is named after jazz musician Duke Ellington. The bottom of his toothpaste tube reads &quot;NINA&quot;, an Easter egg referencing Hirschfeld&#x27;s daughter Nina, whose name Hirschfeld inscribed in several of his drawings since her birth in 1945. Another easter egg references artist Emily Jiuliano, whose name is shown as &quot;E. Jiuliano&quot;. Rachel was designed after the Goldbergs&#x27; daughter; John, or &quot;Flying John&quot;, is based on animation historian and author John Culhane and Hirschfeld&#x27;s caricature of Alexander Woollcott. Goldberg took Hirschfeld&#x27;s original illustration of Gershwin and animated it to make him play part of the &quot;rhapsody&quot; on the piano. The most difficult part of this particular scene to animate was the turning of Gershwin&#x27;s head, as the original drawing depicted one angle of his head. The illustration also featured Ira Gershwin alongside his brother George, but Ira is not shown in the scene nor anywhere else in the film. Featured in the crowd emerging from the hotel are depictions of Brooks Atkinson and Hirschfeld, along with his wife Dolly Haas. The sequence was so chromatically complex that the rendering process using the CAPS system delayed work on &quot;Tarzan&quot;.

====&quot;Piano Concerto No. 2&quot;====
&quot;Piano Concerto No. 2&quot; was directed by Butoy with art director Michael Humphries. It originated in the 1930s when Walt Disney wished to adapt a collection of Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales into an animated film. The artists completed a series of preliminary designs based on the stories, including ones for &quot;The Steadfast Tin Soldier&quot; from 1938 by Bianca Majolie that were stored in the studio&#x27;s animation research library and used for a 1991 Disney book that retold the story accompanied with the storyboard sketches. When Disney suggested using the Shostakovich piece, Butoy flipped through the book and found the story&#x27;s structure fit to the music. When Humphries saw the sketches he designed the segment with works by Caravaggio and Rembrandt in mind to give the segment a &quot;timeless&quot; feel, while keeping the colors &quot;as romantic as possible&quot; during the scenes when the soldier and ballerina are first getting acquainted. Live action footage of a real ballerina was used as a guide for the toy ballerina&#x27;s movements. Butoy found the Jack-in-a-box a difficult character to design and animate with its spring base and how he moved with the box. His appearance went through numerous changes, partly due to the lack of reference material available to the team.

The segment marked the first time the Disney studio created a film&#x27;s main characters entirely from CGI; only backgrounds, secondary, or tertiary characters had been produced using CGI beforehand. Initially Butoy asked Pixar Animation Studios to handle the computer graphics, but CGI artist Steve Goldberg convinced him to let Disney&#x27;s own team produce it. The backgrounds were completed by hand. Originally the drain sequence included friendly rats who performed comical gags, but the team found it did not fit the mood of the rest of the segment. The drains became a more scary environment, something that Butoy said was &quot;what the music was telling us to do&quot;. Rain animation from &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942) was scanned into the CAPS system and digitally altered to fit into the segment. The ending was to feature the original ending with the soldier and ballerina melting in the fire, but the music was too upbeat to animate it and was changed. An excerpt of the segment was shown at the 1998 SIGGRAPH conference.

====&quot;The Carnival of the Animals, Finale&quot;====
&quot;The Carnival of the Animals, Finale&quot; was directed and animated by Goldberg; his wife Susan was its art director. The idea originated from animator Joe Grant, one of the two story directors on &quot;Fantasia&quot; who loved the ostriches in &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot;. When development for &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; began, Grant suggested the idea of having one of the ostriches play with a yo-yo to the last movement of &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot;. The ostriches were later changed to flamingos as Disney wished to avoid reintroducing characters from the original film and thought flamingos would look more colorful on the screen. Goldberg was partly inspired by co-director Mike Gabriel, who would play with a yo-yo as he took a break from working on &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995); Gabriel is given a credit for &quot;yo-yo tricks&quot; in the end credits. The segment was produced with CGI and 6,000 watercolor paintings on heavy bond paper. Susan chose a distinct colour palette for the segment which she compared to the style of a Hawaiian shirt. The Goldbergs and their team visited the zoo in Los Angeles and San Diego to study the anatomy and movement of flamingos.

====&quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;====
====&quot;Pomp and Circumstance (Land of Hope and Glory)&quot;====
Mostly known as Britain&#x27;s most loved patriotic song (thanks its choral counterpart &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot;) the original march was created for royal and solemn events, but Eisner suggested his use as a stand-alone piece after he attended a graduation and thought its familiarity would be suitable for a &quot;Fantasia&quot; segment. His idea involved a selection of Disney princesses and heroes in a wedding procession carrying their future children who would then be presented in a ceremony. The animators&#x27; preliminary designs depicted a Greco-Roman setting; one of the staff members described the artwork as &quot;an appalling abuse&quot; of the characters. Eisner agreed to drop the story, but insisted that the music be used. After numerous ideas were scrapped due to the difficulty in writing a clear plot, animator and director Francis Glebas came up with the Noah&#x27;s Ark idea that he titled &quot;Donald&#x27;s Last Roundup!&quot;, later retitled as &quot;Noah&#x27;s Duck&quot;, and pitched it thinking it was &quot;laden with comic possibilities&quot;.

====&quot;The Firebird&quot;====

To close the film, Disney wanted a piece that was &quot;emotionally equivalent&quot; to the &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; and &quot;Ave Maria&quot; segments that closed &quot;Fantasia&quot;. Disney chose &quot;The Firebird&quot; as the piece to use after &quot;half a dozen&quot; others were scrapped, including Symphony No. 9 by Beethoven and the &quot;Hallelujah Chorus&quot; from &quot;Messiah&quot; by Handel. Disney thought of the idea of the Earth&#x27;s destruction and renewal after passing Mount St. Helens following its eruption in 1980. French twins Paul and Gaëtan Brizzi from Disney&#x27;s Paris studio were hired to direct the segment. The Sprite is a Dryad-like creature from Greek mythology. Her form changes six times; she is introduced as a Water Sprite who plants flowers as a Flower Sprite. She becomes a Neutral Sprite where her growth trail stops and an Ash Sprite when the forest has been destroyed. The segment ends with her as a Rain-Wave Sprite, followed by the Grass Sprite. The segment originally ended with the Sprite in the form of a flowing river that rises up into the sky and transforms into a Sun Sprite, but this was abandoned. The elk&#x27;s antlers were produced by CGI and placed on top of its body that was drawn traditionally. The segment was produced using Houdini animation software.

===Music===
The music to &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; was already recorded on January 9, 1938, for the first film at Culver Studios, California with Leopold Stokowski conducting a group of session musicians. The recording of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; used in the film is an edited version of Ferde Grofé&#x27;s orchestration of the piece performed by the Philharmonia Orchestra with conductor Bruce Broughton. The shortened version was made by cutting 125 bars of piano solo in three different places. A recording of James Levine conducting both pieces with the Philharmonia appears on the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

The remaining six pieces were recorded at the Medinah Temple in Chicago, performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Levine. &quot;Pines of Rome&quot; was re-arranged in 1993 by Bruce Coughlin, who reduced the four-movement piece by cutting the second movement and trimming sections of the third and fourth movements. The piece was recorded on March 28, 1994. The second recording involved &quot;Symphony No. 5&quot;, &quot;Carnival of the Animals&quot;, and &quot;Pomp and Circumstance&quot;, on April 25, 1994. &quot;Carnival of the Animals, Finale&quot; uses two pianos played by Gail Niwa and Philip Sabransky. &quot;Pomp and Circumstance&quot; was arranged by Peter Schickele and features the Chicago Symphony Chorus and soprano soloist Kathleen Battle. The next recording took place on April 24, 1995, for &quot;Piano Concerto No. 2&quot; with pianist Yefim Bronfman. On September 28, 1996, &quot;The Firebird&quot; was the final piece to be recorded; its session lasted for three hours. The piece was arranged using four sections from Stravinsky&#x27;s 1919 revision of the score.

===Interstitials===
Disney felt the need to keep interstitials (bridges) as used in &quot;Fantasia&quot; in order to give audiences a chance to &quot;cleanse their emotional palate&quot; from the previous segment while also providing some information about the next one. Don Hahn directed the live action scenes which were designed by Pixote Hunt. Hahn came up with the set and backgrounds while eating lunch; he proceeded to sketch a rough idea of what he imagined on a napkin. He &quot;wanted to show images on shapes like big sails of a clipper ship. They fly in on the wind and form a sort of Stonehenge concert hall in the middle of a vast, empty, imaginary plain&quot;.

Hahn recalled some difficulty in finding someone to host the film, so the studio decided to use a group of artists and musicians from various fields of entertainment. The interstitials were filmed in various locations; the orchestra, Jones, Lansbury, and Bronfman were shot in Los Angeles, Perlman and Midler in New York City, and others in Boston, Massachusetts. Each scene was filmed in front of a green screen to allow shots of the orchestra or the set to be placed behind them. The shots of Levine, the artists, and the orchestra were filmed on October 31, 1998. The piano Grierson plays in his scene with Jones is the same one on which he played &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; for the soundtrack.

==Release==

&quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; was officially announced on February 9, 1999, during a Disney presentation at the New Amsterdam Theater in New York City which featured a screening of &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot;. The film premiered at Carnegie Hall in New York City on December 17, 1999, for three nights as part of a five-city concert tour. The animation was presented on a screen above the stage while Levine conducted the Philharmonia Orchestra with a video auto-cue to time the music to the images. Performances followed at the Royal Albert Hall in London on December 21; the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris on December 22; the Orchard Hall in Tokyo on December 27; and the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Pasadena, California on December 31, where Derrick Inouye conducted as part of a black tie $2,000-per-head New Year&#x27;s Eve event. Each of the seven performances cost over $1 million.

===Home media===
&quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; was first released on VHS and DVD on November 14, 2000, with both featuring a specially made introduction in which Roy gives a history of key innovations brought by various Disney productions (specifically &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;, &quot;Flowers and Trees&quot;, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;Fantasia&quot;, &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; and &quot;Dinosaur&quot;). While it was available as a single-disc DVD, a three-disc set titled &quot;The Fantasia Anthology&quot; was released, including a digital copy of the film, a restored print of &quot;Fantasia&quot; to commemorate its 60th anniversary, and a third disc containing bonus features. The DVD releases of both films were also THX certified on this set.

On November 30, 2010, the film was issued for DVD and Blu-ray in a single and two-disc set with &quot;Fantasia&quot; and a four-disc DVD and Blu-ray combo pack. The Blu-ray transfer presents the film in 1080p high-definition video with DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround sound. The film was withdrawn from release after its return to the &quot;Disney Vault&quot; moratorium on April 30, 2011.

The film, along with &quot;Fantasia&quot; and the 2018 compilation &quot;Celebrating Mickey&quot; (containing 13 Mickey Mouse shorts from &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; to &quot;Get a Horse!&quot;), was reissued in 2021 as part of the U.S. Disney Movie Club exclusive &quot;The Best of Mickey Collection&quot; (Blu-ray/DVD/Digital). Both films were also broadly released for the first time in 2021 on multiple U.S. purchased streaming platforms, including Movies Anywhere and its retailers.

===Soundtrack===

Walt Disney Records released 60,000 copies of a limited edition of the film&#x27;s soundtrack on November 30, 1999, in the United States and internationally under the Sony Classical label. With a running time of 60 minutes, the album features Levine conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra on &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; and &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; at AIR Studios in London, and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for the remaining six tracks using the recordings from the Medinah Temple. The soundtrack went on to reach the number one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Classical Albums chart in July 2000. A &quot;Fantasia 2000 Deluxe Read-Along&quot; cassette and CD followed which contains two tracks telling the stories of &quot;Pomp and Circumstance&quot; and &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, with narration by Pat Carroll. Included in the set is a 44-page book containing some of the film&#x27;s artwork.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; first opened in IMAX theatres for a four-month run from January 1 to April 30, 2000, becoming the first animated feature-length film shown in the format. The idea to release it in IMAX first originated from Dick Cook during meetings the studio had about the best way to create &quot;a sense of event&quot; for the film. Roy Disney believed its uniqueness from typical feature films gave it a psychological advantage. A temporary 622-seat theatre costing almost was built in four weeks for its Los Angeles run as Disney was unable to reach an agreement to only have the film shown during the four months at the city&#x27;s sole IMAX theater at the time at the California Science Center. Disney enforced the exclusive screening rule on the other IMAX cinemas that showed the film which limited its release. Each theater was decorated with a museum-like exhibit with educational material and large displays.

After opening at 75 theaters worldwide, the film grossed over in 54 cinemas in North America in its opening weekend, averaging $41,481 per theater, and $842,000 from 21 screens in 14 markets. It set new records for the highest gross for any IMAX engagement and surpassed the highest weekly total for any previously released IMAX film. Its three-day worldwide gross surpassed , setting further records at 18 venues worldwide. &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; grossed a worldwide total of in 30 days, and at the end of its IMAX run.

Following its release in 1,313 regular theatres in the United States on June 16, 2000, the film grossed an additional in its opening weekend that ranked eleventh at the box office. This followed nearly half a year of release in the IMAX format, possibly blunting the amount earned in the weekends of wide release. &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; has earned a total worldwide gross of over since its release, with $60.7 million of that total from the U.S. market, and the rest through foreign box office sales. The film had cost around $90 million and was viewed by Eisner as Roy Disney&#x27;s &quot;folly&quot;.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . Its consensus reads: &quot;It provides an entertaining experience for adults and children alike.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave a &quot;B−&quot; rating; its reviewer, Bruce Fretts, called &quot;Symphony No. 5&quot; &quot;maddeningly abstract&quot;, &quot;Piano Concerto No. 2&quot; &quot;charmingly traditional&quot; and thought &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; fit well to the music, but &quot;Pomp and Circumstance&quot; &quot;inexplicably inspires biblical kitsch&quot;. The review ends with a criticism of the inadequate quality of &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; on the IMAX screen. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; pointed out that while the original &quot;Fantasia&quot; felt too long and formal, its &quot;enjoyable follow-up is, at 75 minutes, simply too breezy and lightweight&quot;. He summarized the film &quot;like a light buffet of tasty morsels rather than a full and satisfying meal&quot;.

In his December 1999 review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave the film a rating of three stars out of four. He described some of the animation (such as &quot;Firebird Suite&quot;, his favorite segment) as &quot;powerful&quot;, though he thought others, like the dance of the abstract triangles in &quot;Symphony No. 5&quot;, to be &quot;a little pedestrian&quot;. He admired &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; and its interlocking stories, pointing out its style was reminiscent of the &quot;Madeline&quot; picture books by Ludwig Bemelmans. He thought &quot;Pines of Rome&quot; presented itself well in the IMAX format and found the &quot;Piano Concerto No. 2&quot; played &quot;wonderfully as a self-contained film&quot;, while he found &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; to be &quot;not as visually sharp as the rest of the film&quot;. He nonetheless described the film overall as &quot;splendid entertainment&quot;. Film critic Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;often has the feel of a giant corporate promotion whose stars are there simply to hawk the company&#x27;s wares&quot; while noting the film &quot;is not especially innovative in its look or subject matter.&quot; &quot;Firebird Suite&quot; was his favorite segment which left &quot;a lasting impression of the beauty, terror, and unpredictability of the natural world&quot;. He found &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; fit well with the rest of the film and the battle in &quot;Symphony No. 5&quot; too abbreviated to amount to much. He found the segment with the whales failed in that the images &quot;quickly become redundant&quot;. He found &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; to be the second-best in the film with its witty, hyper-kinetic evocation of the melting pot with sharply defined characters. He found the segment with the flamingos cute and the one with the tin soldier to be romantic. James Berardinelli found the film to be of uneven quality. He felt &quot;Symphony No. 5&quot; was &quot;dull and uninspired&quot;, the yo-yoing flamingos &quot;wasteful&quot;, and the New York City-based story of Rhapsody in Blue interesting but out of place in this particular movie. He found the story of the tin soldier to successfully mix its music with &quot;top-notch animation&quot; and &quot;an emotionally rewarding story&quot;. He felt the Firebird section was &quot;visually ingenious&quot;, and &quot;Pomp and Circumstance&quot; the most light-hearted episode and the one with the most appeal to children, in an otherwise adult-oriented film. To him &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; was an enduring classic.

David Parkinson of British film magazine &quot;Empire&quot; rates the film three stars out of five, calling it a &quot;curate&#x27;s egg, with moments of hilarity and beauty alternating with the pompous and the banal&quot;. Moments of &quot;Symphony No. 5&quot; and &quot;The Firebird&quot; he thought lacked the &quot;abstract grace&quot; from &quot;Toccata and Fugue&quot; from the original, and &quot;Pines of Rome&quot; was &quot;even less successful&quot; due to the computer imagery which affected its quality. He claims &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; is &quot;guilty of some dubious racial and sexual caricaturing&quot;, but hailed the film&#x27;s IMAX presentation as &quot;a breathtaking spectacle&quot;. He summarized the film as &quot;slightly more successful&quot; than the original &quot;Fantasia&quot;, more child-friendly and a &quot;mixed bag of delights&quot;. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote a positive review of the film, citing &quot;Pines of Rome&quot; as &quot;a superb, uplifting flight of the spirit&quot; and &quot;Piano Concerto No. 2&quot; &quot;a gorgeous blend of traditional and computer animation&quot;. He drew a comparison to &quot;The Firebird&quot; with the 1997 Japanese animated film &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;. Brian Sibley wrote a mostly negative review in &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;, a monthly magazine published by the British Film Institute, in June 2000. He pointed out that though the film includes moments of comedy and pastoral, &quot;the themes running through the old &#x27;Fantasia&#x27; – the struggle between light and dark, the war between chaos and order, the ultimate triumph of goodness – find only a pale equivalent in this new version&quot;. He compared the film&#x27;s orchestra set to scenes from &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (1946) and thought the CGI in &quot;Symphony No. 5&quot; lacked the technical qualities of &quot;Toy Story&quot;. Sibley argued the film lacked an even quality, highlighting &quot;Pines of Rome&quot; with its &quot;breathtaking&quot; opening before &quot;its magic has been overtaken by chronic boredom&quot; when the baby whale reunites with his parents. &quot;Pomp and Circumstance&quot;, he thought, contained &quot;shamefully sloppy animation&quot; but is saved by Donald&#x27;s comical gags, but pointed out &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, with its &quot;strong lines and vivid, flat colours that are fashionably retro&quot;, and the &quot;classic Disneyesque ... exquisite beauty and raw natural violence&quot; in &quot;Firebird Suite&quot;, as the film&#x27;s most successful segments as they &quot;ironically, hark back to older times&quot;.

===Accolades ===

==Credits==
Note: All segments performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra with conductor James Levine, except where noted.

==Short films and cancelled sequel==
Development on a third film began in 2002 under the working title &quot;Fantasia 2006&quot;. Plans were made to include &quot;One by One&quot; by Pixote Hunt and &quot;The Little Matchgirl&quot; by Roger Allers in the film before the project was cancelled in 2004 for unknown reasons, with the proposed segments instead being released as standalone short films.

&quot;Destino&quot; is an animated short film released in 2003 by The Walt Disney Company. &quot;Destino&quot; is unique in that its production began in 1945, 58 years before its eventual completion. The project was originally a collaboration between Walt Disney and Spanish surrealist painter Salvador Dalí, and features music written by Mexican songwriter Armando Domínguez and performed by Dora Luz. In 1999, Walt Disney&#x27;s nephew, Roy E. Disney, while working on &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;, unearthed the dormant project and decided to bring it back to life. It was later released as a bonus short on the special edition DVD and Blu-ray of &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;.

&quot;Lorenzo&quot; is a 2004 American animated short film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation about a cat named Lorenzo who is &quot;dismayed to discover that his tail has developed a personality of its own&quot;. The short was directed by Mike Gabriel and produced by Baker Bloodworth. It premiered at the Florida Film Festival on March 6, 2004, and later appeared as a feature before the film &quot;Raising Helen&quot;; however, it did not appear on the DVD release of the film. Work on the film began in 1943, but was shelved. It was later found along with &quot;Destino&quot;.

&quot;One by One&quot; is a traditionally animated short film directed by Pixote Hunt and released by Walt Disney Pictures on August 31, 2004, as an extra feature on the DVD release of &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot; Special Edition.

&quot;The Little Matchgirl&quot; is a 2006 animated short film directed by Roger Allers and produced by Don Hahn. It is based on an original story by Hans Christian Andersen entitled &quot;The Little Girl with the Matches&quot; or &quot;The Little Match Girl&quot;, published in 1845.

<text>The Golden Gate Yacht Club (GGYC) is a San Francisco, California, U.S. based yacht club founded in 1939.

==History==
In 1939 the first members built a clubhouse on a barge in the San Francisco Marina. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake severely damaged the club, members pulled together and rebuilt it.

GGYC is a popular cruise and regatta venue on the San Francisco waterfront. The club is located on the jetty directly east of the St. Francis Yacht Club and north of the Marina Green, at the end of Yacht Road in San Francisco. The most well-known of current members is Oracle Corporation founder Larry Ellison.

The Club entered the 2007 Louis Vuitton Cup, the America&#x27;s Cup challenger selection series, represented by the &quot;BMW Oracle Racing&quot; team. &quot;BMW Oracle Racing&quot; were eliminated in the semi-finals. They challenged for the America&#x27;s Cup in 2010 represented by the BMW Oracle Racing team and won a Deed of Gift match 2–0 against the Alinghi team representing Société Nautique de Genève becoming the first American yacht club to hold the cup since 1995.

&quot;America&#x27;s Cup Management&quot; announced on July 5, 2007, that the protocol for the 33rd America&#x27;s Cup had been agreed between the Defending yacht club, the Société Nautique de Genève (SNG) of Switzerland and its Challenger of Record, the Club Náutico Español de Vela of Spain. Golden Gate Yacht Club sued, successfully arguing that Club Náutico Español de Vela was not a valid challenger. The challenge was upheld, and Golden Gate Yacht Club&#x27;s team, BMW Oracle Racing, sailed against SNG, represented by the Alinghi team, in February 2010 in Valencia, Spain. The competing boats, Alinghi 5 and USA 17 were both 90-foot multihulls. The rigid wing sail of USA 17 provided a decisive advantage and Golden Gate Yacht Club won the 2010 America&#x27;s Cup by a considerable margin.

They successfully defended the America&#x27;s Cup at the 34th America&#x27;s Cup in San Francisco in 2013, but finally lost the trophy in the 35th edition against the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron.

==Commodores==
To date there have been 65 commodores of the Golden Gate Yacht Club.

<doc id="507688" wikidata="Q1192398" url="?curid=507688" title="Musket Wars">
<text>The Musket Wars were a series of as many as 3,000 battles and raids fought throughout New Zealand (including the Chatham Islands) among Māori between 1806 and 1845, after Māori first obtained muskets and then engaged in an intertribal arms race in order to gain territory or seek revenge for past defeats. The battles resulted in the deaths of between 20,000 and 40,000 people and the enslavement of tens of thousands of Māori and significantly altered the &quot;rohe&quot;, or tribal territorial boundaries, before the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. The Musket Wars reached their peak in the 1830s, with smaller conflicts between iwi continuing until the mid-1840s; some historians argue the New Zealand Wars were (commencing with the Wairau Affray in 1843 and Flagstaff War in 1845) a continuation of the Musket Wars. The increased use of muskets in intertribal warfare led to changes in the design of pā fortifications, which later benefited Māori when engaged in battles with colonial forces during the New Zealand Wars.

Ngāpuhi chief Hongi Hika in 1818 used newly acquired muskets to launch devastating raids from his Northland base into the Bay of Plenty, where local Māori were still relying on traditional weapons of wood and stone. In the following years he launched equally successful raids on &quot;iwi&quot; in Auckland, Thames, Waikato and Lake Rotorua, taking large numbers of his enemies as slaves, who were put to work cultivating and dressing flax to trade with Europeans for more muskets. His success prompted other &quot;iwi&quot; to procure firearms in order to mount effective methods of defence and deterrence and the spiral of violence peaked in 1832 and 1833, by which time it had spread to all parts of the country except the inland area of the North Island later known as the King Country and remote bays and valleys of Fiordland in the South Island. In 1835, the fighting went offshore as members of Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama invaded and murdered the Moriori of Rēkohu in a genocide.

With as many as 40,000 killed over a 40-year period, the death toll of the Musket Wars was absolutely unprecedented. Historian Michael King suggested the term &quot;holocaust&quot; could be applied to the period; another historian, Angela Ballara, has questioned the validity of the term &quot;musket wars&quot;, suggesting the conflict was no more than a continuation of Māori &quot;tikanga&quot; (custom), but more destructive because of the widespread use of firearms. The wars have been described as an example of the &quot;fatal impact&quot; of indigenous contact with Europeans.

==Origin and escalation of warfare==

Māori began acquiring European muskets in the early 19th century from Sydney-based flax and timber merchants. Because they had never had projectile weapons, they initially sought guns for hunting. Their first known use in intertribal fighting was in the 1807 battle of Moremonui between Ngāpuhi and Ngāti Whātua in Northland near present-day Dargaville. Although they had some muskets, Ngāpuhi warriors struggled to load and reload them quickly enough and were defeated by an enemy armed only with traditional weapons—the clubs and blades known as &quot;patu&quot; and &quot;taiaha&quot;. However, soon after, members of the Ngāti Korokoro hapū of Ngāpuhi suffered severe losses in a raid on the Kai Tutae &quot;hapu&quot; despite outnumbering their foe ten to one, because the Kai Tutae were equipped with muskets.

Under Hongi Hika&#x27;s command, Ngāpuhi began amassing muskets and from about 1818 began launching effective raids on &quot;hapu&quot; throughout the North Island against whom they had grievances. Rather than occupy territory in areas where they defeated their enemy, they seized &quot;taonga&quot; (treasures) and slaves, whom they put to work to grow and prepare more crops—chiefly flax and potatoes—as well as raise pigs to trade for even more weapons. A flourishing trade in the smoked heads of slain enemies and slaves also developed. The custom of &quot;utu&quot;, or reciprocation, led to a growing series of reprisals as other &quot;iwi&quot; realised the benefits of muskets for warfare, prompting an arms race among warring groups. In 1821, Hongi Hika travelled to England with missionary Thomas Kendall and in Sydney on his return voyage traded the gifts which he had obtained in England for between 300 and 500 muskets, which he then used to launch even more devastating raids, with even bigger armies, against &quot;iwi&quot; from the Auckland region to Rotorua.

==Use of the musket by Māori==
The last of the non-musket wars, the 1807 Battle of Hingakaka, was fought between two opposing Māori alliances near modern Te Awamutu, with an estimated 16,000 warriors involved, although as late as about 1815, some conflicts were still being fought with traditional weapons. The musket slowly put an end to the traditional combat of Māori warfare using mainly hand weapons and increased the importance of coordinated group manoeuvre. One-on-one fights such as Pōtatau Te Wherowhero&#x27;s at the battle of Okoki in 1821 became rare.

Initially, the musket was used as a shock weapon, enabling traditional and iron weapons to be used effectively against a demoralised foe. But by the 1830s equally well-armed taua engaged each other with varying degrees of success. Māori learnt most of their musket technology from the various Pākehā Māori who lived in the Bay of Islands and Hokianga area. Some of these men were skilled sailors who were well-experienced in using muskets in battles at sea. Māori customised their muskets; for example, some enlarged the touch holes, which, while reducing muzzle velocity, increased the rate of fire.

=== Quality of muskets ===
Most muskets sold were low quality, short barrel trade muskets made cheaply in Birmingham with inferior steel and less precision in the action. Māori often favoured the &quot;tupara&quot; (two-barrel) shotguns loaded with musket balls, as they could fire twice before reloading. In some battles, women were used to reload muskets while the men kept shooting. Later this presented a problem for the British and colonial forces during the New Zealand Wars when &quot;iwi&quot; would keep women in the &quot;pā&quot;.

Māori found it very hard to obtain muskets as the missionaries refused to trade them or sell powder or shot. The Ngāpuhi put missionaries under intense pressure to repair muskets even at times threatening them with violence. Most muskets were initially obtained while in Australia. Pākehā Māori such as Jacky Marmon were instrumental in obtaining muskets from trading ships in return for flax, timber and smoked heads.

==Conflicts and consequences==

The violence brought devastation for many tribes, with some wiped out as the vanquished were killed or enslaved, and tribal boundaries were completely redrawn as large swathes of territory were conquered and evacuated. Those changes greatly complicated later dealings with European settlers wishing to gain land.

Between 1821 and 1823 Hongi Hika attacked Ngāti Pāoa in Auckland, Ngāti Maru in Thames, Waikato tribes at Matakitaki, and Te Arawa at Lake Rotorua, heavily defeating them all. In 1825 he gained a major military victory over Ngāti Whātua at Kaipara north of Auckland, then pursued survivors into Waikato territory to gain revenge for Ngāpuhi&#x27;s 1807 defeat. Ngāpuhi chiefs Pōmare and Te Wera Hauraki also led attacks on the East Coast, and in Hawke&#x27;s Bay and the Bay of Plenty. Ngāpuhi&#x27;s involvement in the musket wars began to recede in the early 1830s.

Waikato tribes expelled Ngāti Toa chief Te Rauparaha from Kāwhia in 1821, defeated Ngāti Kahungunu at Napier in 1824 and invaded Taranaki in 1826, forcing a number of tribal groups to migrate south. Waikato launched another major incursion into Taranaki in 1831–32. 

Te Rauparaha, meanwhile, had moved first to Taranaki and then to the Kāpiti coast and Kapiti Island, which Ngāti Toa chief Te Pēhi Kupe captured from the Muaupoko people. About 1827 Te Rauparaha began leading raids into the north of the South Island; by 1830 he had expanded his territory to include Kaikōura and Akaroa and much of the rest of the South Island. 

The final South Island battles took place in Southland in 1836–37 between forces of Ngāi Tahu leader Tūhawaiki and those of Ngāti Tama chief Te Puoho, who had followed a route from Golden Bay down the West Coast and across the Southern Alps.

=== Chatham Islands ===

In 1835 Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama hijacked a ship to take them to the Chatham Islands where they slaughtered about 10 per cent of the Moriori people and enslaved the survivors, before waging war among themselves.

===Te Ihupuku Pā===
The final conflict of the Musket Wars occurred in 1845. A Ngāti Tūwharetoa war party was stopped en route to an attack on the Ngā Rauru Te Ihupuku Pā in South Taranaki by British and church officials. The Anglican Bishop of New Zealand and a Major managed to talk both sides out of fighting. Ngāti Tūwharetoa fired the final shots of the Musket Wars symbolically into the air before returning to Taupō.

== Historiography ==
Historian James Belich has suggested &quot;Potato Wars&quot; as a more accurate name for these battles, due to the revolution the potato brought to the Māori economy. Historian Angela Ballara says that new foods made some aspects of the wars different. Potatoes were introduced in New Zealand in 1769 and they became a key staple with better food-value for weight than kūmara (sweet-potato), and easier cultivation and storage. Unlike the kūmara with their associated ritual requirements, potatoes were tillable by slaves and women and this freed up men to go to war.

Belich saw this as a logistical revolution, with potatoes effectively fueling the long-range &quot;taua&quot; that made the musket wars different from any fighting that had come before. Slaves captured in the raids were put to work tending potato patches, freeing up labour to create even larger &quot;taua&quot;. The duration of the raids was also longer by the 1820s; it became common for warriors to be away for up to a year because it was easier to grow a series of potato crops.

==In popular culture==
The music video of &quot;Kai Tangata&quot; from New Zealand thrash metal band Alien Weaponry dramatically portrays part of the conflict that ensued with introduction of the muskets.

&quot;The Convert&quot; is a film set amid the conflict.

<text>A PC speaker is a loudspeaker built into some IBM PC compatible computers. The first IBM Personal Computer, model 5150, employed a standard 2.25 inch magnetic driven (dynamic) speaker. More recent computers use a tiny moving-iron or piezo speaker instead. The speaker allows software and firmware to provide auditory feedback to a user, such as to report a hardware fault. A PC speaker generates waveforms using the programmable interval timer, an Intel 8253 or 8254 chip.

== Use cases ==

=== BIOS/UEFI error codes ===

The PC speaker is used during the power-on self-test (POST) sequence to indicate errors during the boot process. Since it is active before the graphics card, it can be used to communicate &quot;beep codes&quot; related to problems that prevent the much more complex initialization of the graphics card to take place. For example, the Video BIOS usually cannot activate a graphics card unless working RAM is present in the system while beeping the speaker is possible with just ROM and the CPU registers. Usually, different error codes will be signalled by specific beeping patterns, such as e.g. &quot;one beep; pause; three beeps; pause; repeat&quot;. These patterns are specific to the BIOS/UEFI manufacturer and are usually documented in the technical manual of the motherboard.

=== Software ===
Several programs, including music software, operating systems or games, could play pulse-code modulation (PCM) sound through the PC speaker using special &quot;Pulse-width Modulation&quot; techniques explained later in this article.

==== Games ====

The PC speaker was often used in very innovative ways to create the impression of polyphonic music or sound effects within computer games of its era, such as the LucasArts series of adventure games from the mid-1980s, using swift arpeggios. Several games such as &quot;Space Hulk&quot; and &quot;Pinball Fantasies&quot; were noted for their elaborate sound effects; &quot;Space Hulk&quot;, in particular, even had full speech.

However, because the method used to reproduce PCM was very sensitive to timing issues, these effects either caused noticeable sluggishness on slower PCs or sometimes failed on faster PCs (that is, significantly faster than the program was originally developed for). Also, it was difficult for programs to do much else, even update the display, during the playing of such sounds. Thus, when sound cards (which can output complex sounds independent from the CPU once initiated) became mainstream in the PC market after 1990, they quickly replaced the PC speaker as the preferred output device for sound effects. Most newly-released PC games stopped supporting the speaker during the second half of the 1990s.

==== Other programs ====
Several programs, including MP (Module Player, 1989), Scream Tracker, Fast Tracker, Impulse Tracker, and even device drivers for Linux and Microsoft Windows, could play PCM sound through the PC speaker.

Modern Microsoft Windows systems have PC speaker support as a separate device with special capabilities – that is, it cannot be configured as a normal audio output device. Some software uses this special sound channel to produce sounds. For example, Skype can use it as a reserve calling signal device for the case where the primary audio output device cannot be heard (for example because the volume is set to the minimum level, the amplifier is turned off or headphones are plugged in).

In the 1990s, a computer virus for Microsoft DOS named &quot;Techno&quot; appeared, playing a melody through the PC speaker while printing the word &quot;TECHNO&quot; on the screen until filled.

==Pinouts==
In some applications, the PC speaker is affixed directly to the computer&#x27;s motherboard; in others, including the first IBM Personal Computer, the speaker is attached by wire to a connector on the motherboard. Some PC cases come with a PC speaker preinstalled. A wired PC speaker connector may have a two-, three-, or four-pin configuration, and either two or three wires. The female connector of the speaker connects to pin headers on the motherboard, which are sometimes labeled or .

==Pulse-width modulation==
The PC speaker is normally meant to reproduce a square wave via only 2 levels of output (two voltage levels, typically 0 V and 5 V), driven by channel 2 of the Intel 8253 (PC, XT) or 8254 (AT and later) Programmable Interval Timer operating in mode three (square wave signal). The speaker hardware itself is directly accessible via PC I/O port 61H (61 hexadecimal) via bit 1 and can be physically manipulated for 2 levels of output (i.e. 1-bit sound). However, by carefully timing a short pulse (i.e. going from one output level to the other and then back to the first), and by relying on the speaker&#x27;s physical filtering properties (limited frequency response, self-inductance, etc.), it is possible to drive the speaker to various intermediate output levels, functioning as a crude digital-to-analog converter. This technique is called pulse-width modulation (PWM) and allows approximate playback of PCM audio. (A more refined version of this technique is used in class D audio amplifiers.)

With the PC speaker this method achieves limited quality playback, but a commercial solution named RealSound used it to provide improved sound on several games.

Obtaining a high fidelity sound output using this technique requires a switching frequency much higher than the audio frequencies meant to be reproduced (typically with a ratio of 10:1 or more), and the output voltage to be bipolar, in order to make better use of the output devices&#x27; dynamic range and power. On the PC speaker, however, the output voltage is either zero or at a Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL) level (unipolar).

The quality depends on a trade-off between the PWM carrier frequency (effective sample rate) and the number of output levels (effective bit depth). The clock rate of the PC&#x27;s programmable interval timer which drives the speaker is fixed at 1,193,180 Hz, and the product of the audio sample rate times the maximum DAC value must equal this. 
Typically, a 6-bit DAC with a maximum value of 63 is used at a sample rate of 18,939.4 Hz, producing poor but recognizable audio.

The audio fidelity of this technique is further decreased by the lack of a properly sized dynamic loudspeaker, specially in modern machines and particularly laptops that use a tiny moving-iron speaker (often confused with piezoelectric). The reason for this is that PWM-produced audio requires a low-pass filter before the final output in order to suppress switching noise and high harmonics. A normal dynamic loudspeaker does this naturally, but the tiny metal diaphragm of the moving-iron speaker will let much switching noise pass, as will many direct couplings (though there are exceptions to this, e.g. filtered &quot;speaker in&quot; ports on some motherboards and sound cards).

This use of the PC speaker for complex audio output became less common with the introduction of Sound Blaster and other sound cards.

<text>The Waltz in D-flat major, Op. 64, No. 1, sometimes known as &quot;&quot; (French for &quot;Waltz of the puppy&quot;), and popularly known in English as the Minute Waltz, is a piano waltz by Polish composer and virtuoso Frédéric Chopin. It is dedicated to the Countess Delfina Potocka.

==History==
Chopin composed the waltz in 1847 and had it published by Breitkopf &amp; Härtel in Leipzig the same year, as the first of the &quot;Trois Valses&quot;, Op. 64. The second waltz is in the enharmonic parallel minor key of C-sharp minor.

A fast version of the waltz, played by Arthur Rubinstein, has served as the theme music for the BBC Radio 4 show &quot;Just a Minute&quot; since the programme’s inception.

==Structure==

The waltz is in the key of D-flat major and has a tempo marking of (very lively). Chopin indicates that the waltz is to be played with the sustain pedal used, and makes frequent use of crescendi and diminuendi. It is in a simple ternary form, as are many of Chopin&#x27;s compositions. The A section is marked , and the B section . The A section itself can be divided into two themes, separated by a double barline. The first consists of the familiar opening melody over standard waltz accompaniment, frequently rising an octave only to drop back down. The second theme is similar, but not identical, and features several broken scales over several octaves between a repeated quarter note and triplet motive. The B section is somewhat calmer, using alternating half and quarter notes over waltz accompaniment. Following a lengthy trill, the A section is repeated, modified only in the ending, which features a three-octave descent instead of a two-octave one.

==Tempo==
The piece is given the tempo marking . Although it has long been known as the &quot;Minute&quot; Waltz, its nickname was intended to mean &quot;small&quot; in the sense of a &quot;miniature&quot; waltz, given by its publisher. Chopin did not intend for this waltz to be played in one minute. A typical performance of the work will last between and minutes. The waltz is 140 measures long with one fifteen-measure repeat included, and thus it would have to be played at almost 420 quarter notes per minute in order to play it completely within a single minute. Playing the piece as fast as possible is still a feat some pianists attempt. Camille Bourniquel, one of Chopin&#x27;s biographers, reminds the reader that Chopin got the inspiration for this waltz as he was watching a small dog chase its tail, which prompted the composer to name the piece , meaning &quot;The Little Dog Waltz&quot;.

==Derivative works==
A vocal version of the piece, with lyrics by screenwriter Lan O&#x27;Kun, has been performed by multiple artists, including Barbra Streisand on her 1966 album &quot;Color Me Barbra&quot;, her version peaked at #23 in the &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Easy Listening chart. O&#x27;Kun&#x27;s lyrics perpetuate the notion that the tune should be performed in one minute, although Streisand&#x27;s performance clocks in at just under two minutes. Because the lower notes were hard to reach, Streisand finished up the ending phrases in a spoken voice. This version was also performed by a female Muppet on the 1969–70 premiere season of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. That same version was also used for a skit on &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; in the 1970s.

New Orleans rhythm and blues pianist James Booker included an instrumental version on his album &quot;Junco Partner&quot; (1976).

The composers Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji, Rafael Joseffy, Max Reger, Leopold Godowsky, , Moriz Rosenthal, Giuseppe Ferrata, Sam Raphling, Marc-André Hamelin, and Bertold Hummel created paraphrases of the &quot;Minute Waltz&quot;.

<text>La venganza será terrible (Revenge will be terrible) is a popular radio program in Argentina, also broadcast in Uruguay. It is hosted by Alejandro Dolina.

The program began on Radio El Mundo with the title &quot;Demasiado tarde para lágrimas&quot; (&quot;Too late for tears&quot;). It later moved to Radio Rivadavia under the same name, and then briefly to FM under the name &quot;El Ombligo del Mundo&quot; (&quot;The Navel of the World&quot;). It moved to Radio Continental until recently. On January 4, 2007, it moved to Radio 10. In 2010 the program moved to Radio Nacional. Internet broadcasts are available from &quot;Radio Nacional&quot; from Argentina, and &quot;Espectador&quot;, a Uruguayan radio station in Montevideo.

The show is free of charge and broadcasts Tuesdays to Saturdays from midnight to 2:00 AM, live from the auditorium of Radio Nacional. The show has three parts. In the first one, Dolina discusses a cultural subject (mostly European, Ancient Greek, or South American culture). The second part is humorous: Dolina usually goes through &quot;lifestyle&quot; magazines and, while reading the articles, he starts improvising stories that can go quite far from the original article. In the third part he sings songs that the audience asks for. Dolina is known for his vast knowledge of the tango music.

<text>Azolla (common called mosquito fern, water fern, and fairy moss) is a genus of seven species of aquatic ferns in the family Salviniaceae. They are extremely reduced in form and specialized, looking nothing like other typical ferns but more resembling the form of some mosses or even duckweeds. &quot;Azolla filiculoides&quot; is one of two fern species for which a reference genome has been published. It is believed that this genus grew so prolifically during the Eocene (and thus absorbed such a large amount of carbon) that it triggered a global cooling event that has lasted to the present.

&quot;Azolla&quot; may establish as an invasive plant in areas where it is not native . In such a situation it can alter aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity substantially.

==Phylogeny==
Phylogeny of &quot;Azolla&quot;
Other species include:

At least six extinct species are known from the fossil record:
*&quot;Azolla intertrappea&quot; (Eocene, India)
*&quot;Azolla berryi&quot; (Eocene, Green River Formation, Wyoming)
*&quot;Azolla prisca&quot; (Oligocene, London Clay, Isle of Wight)
*&quot;Azolla tertiaria&quot; (Pliocene, Esmeralda Formation, Nevada)
*&quot;Azolla primaeva&quot; (Eocene, Allenby Formation, British Columbia)
*&quot;Azolla boliviensis&quot; (Maastrichtian – Paleocene, Eslaboacuten Formation and Flora Formation Bolivia)

==Ecology==

&quot;Azolla&quot; is a highly productive plant that can double its biomass in 1.9 days, depending on growing conditions. The plant can yield can reach 8–10 tonnes fresh matter per hectare in Asian paddy fields. 37.8 tonnes fresh weight/ha (2.78 t/ha dry weight) has been reported for &quot;A. pinnata&quot; in India.

&quot;Azolla&quot; floats on the surface of water by means of numerous small, closely overlapping scale-like leaves, with their roots hanging in the water. They form a symbiotic relationship with the cyanobacterium &quot;Anabaena azollae&quot;, which lives outside the cells of its host and which fixes atmospheric nitrogen. The typical limiting factor on its growth is phosphorus; thus, an abundance of phosphorus—due for example to eutrophication or chemical runoff—often leads to &quot;Azolla&quot; blooms. Unlike all other known plants, its symbiotic microorganism transfers directly from one generation to the next. &quot;A. azollae&quot; is completely dependent on its host, as several of its genes have either been lost or transferred to the nucleus in Azolla&#x27;s cells.

The nitrogen-fixing capability of &quot;Azolla&quot; has led to widespread use as a biofertiliser, especially in parts of southeast Asia. The plant has been used to bolster agricultural productivity in China for over a thousand years. When rice paddies are flooded in the spring, they can be planted with &quot;Azolla&quot;, which then quickly multiplies to cover the water, suppressing weeds. The rotting plant material resulting from the die-off of this &quot;Azolla&quot; releases nitrogen into the water for the rice plants, providing up to nine tonnes of protein per hectare per year.

&quot;Azolla&quot; are weeds in many parts of the world, entirely covering some bodies of water. The myth that no mosquito can penetrate the coating of fern to lay its eggs in the water gives the plant its common name &quot;mosquito fern&quot;; however, &quot;Azolla&quot; may deter the survival of some of mosquito larvae.

Most species can produce large amounts of deoxyanthocyanins in response to various stresses, including bright sunlight and extreme temperatures, causing the water surface to appear to be covered with an intensely red carpet. Herbivore feeding induces accumulation of deoxyanthocyanins and leads to a reduction in the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the fronds, thus lowering their palatability and nutritive value.

&quot;Azolla&quot; cannot survive winters with prolonged freezing, so is often grown as an ornamental plant at high latitudes where it cannot establish itself firmly enough to become a weed. It is also not tolerant of salinity; normal plants cannot survive in greater than 1–1.6‰, and even conditioned organisms die if grown in water with a salinity above 5.5‰.

===&quot;Azolla filiculoides&quot;===
&quot;Azolla filiculoides&quot; (red azolla) is the only member of the family Azollaceae found in Tasmania, where it is a common native aquatic plant. It is often found behind farm dams and other still waterbodies. The plants are small (usually only a few cm across) and float, but they are fast growing, and can be abundant and form large mats. The plants are typically red, and have small, water repellent leaves.

==Reproduction==
&quot;Azolla&quot; reproduces sexually, and asexually by splitting.

Like all ferns, sexual reproduction leads to spore formation, but unlike other members of this group, &quot;Azolla&quot; is heterosporous, producing spores of two kinds. During the summer months, numerous spherical structures called sporocarps form on the undersides of the branches. The male sporocarp is greenish or reddish and looks like the egg mass of an insect or spider. It is two millimeters in diameter, and bears numerous male sporangia. Male spores (microspores) are extremely small and are produced inside each microsporangium. Microspores tend to adhere in clumps called massulae.

Female sporocarps are much smaller, containing one sporangium and one functional spore. Since an individual female spore is considerably larger than a male spore, it is termed a megaspore.

&quot;Azolla&quot; has microscopic male and female gametophytes that develop inside the male and female spores. The female gametophyte protrudes from the megaspore and bears a small number of archegonia, each containing a single egg. The microspore forms a male gametophyte with a single antheridium which produces eight swimming sperm. The barbed glochidia on the male spore clusters cause them to cling to the female megaspores, thus facilitating fertilization.

==Applications==

===Food and animal feed===
In addition to its traditional cultivation as a bio-fertilizer for wetland paddies, &quot;Azolla&quot; is finding increasing use for sustainable production of livestock feed. &quot;Azolla&quot; is rich in protein, essential amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. Studies describe feeding &quot;Azolla&quot; to dairy cattle, pigs, ducks, and chickens, with reported increases in milk production, weight of broiler chickens and egg production of layers, as compared to conventional feed. One FAO study describes how &quot;Azolla&quot; integrates into a tropical biomass agricultural system, reducing the need for food supplements. 

==== Concerns related to BMAA ====
Concerns about biomagnification exist because the plant may contain the neurotoxin BMAA that remains present in the bodies of animals consuming it, and BMAA has been documented as passing along the food chain. &quot;Azolla&quot; may contain this substance that is a possible cause of neurodegenerative diseases, including causing ALS, Alzheimer&#x27;s, and Parkinson&#x27;s. &quot;Azolla&quot; has been suggested as a foodstuff for human consumption; however, no long-term studies of the safety of eating &quot;Azolla&quot; have been made on humans. Previous studies attributed neurotoxin production to &quot;Anabaena flos-aquae&quot; species, which is also a type of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. Studies published in 2024 have found that “the Azolla–Nostoc azollae superorganism does not contain BMAA or their isomers DAB and AEG and that Azolla and N. azollae do not synthesize other common cyanotoxins.” Further research may be needed to ascertain whether &quot;A. azollae&quot; is a healthy foodstuff for humans. 

====Companion plant====
&quot;Azolla&quot; has been used for at least one thousand years in rice paddies as a companion plant, to fix nitrogen and to block out light to prevent competition from other plants. Rice is planted when tall enough to poke through the &quot;Azolla&quot; layer. Mats of mature &quot;Azolla&quot; can also be used as a weed-suppressing mulch.

Rice farmers used &quot;Azolla&quot; as a rice biofertilizer 1500 years ago. The earliest known written record of this practice is in a book written by Jia Ssu Hsieh (Jia Si Xue) in 540 AD on &quot;The Art of Feeding the People&quot; (Chih Min Tao Shu). By the end of the Ming dynasty in the early 17th century, &quot;Azolla&quot;&#x27;s use as a green compost was documented in local records.

===Larvicide===
The myth that no mosquito can penetrate the coating of fern to lay its eggs in the water gives the plant its common name &quot;mosquito fern&quot;. &quot;Azolla&quot; have been used to control mosquito larvae in rice fields. The plant grows in a thick mat on the surface of the water, making it more difficult for the larvae to reach the surface to breathe, effectively choking the larvae.

=== Paleoclimatology and climate change ===
Azolla has been proposed as a carbon sequestration modality. The proposal draws upon the hypothesized &quot;Azolla&quot; event that asserts that 55 million years ago, &quot;Azolla&quot; covered the Arctic – at the time a hot, tropical, freshwater environment – and then sank, permanently sequestering teratons of carbon that would otherwise have contributed to the planet&#x27;s greenhouse effect. This ended a warming event that reached warmer than present-day averages, eventually causing the formation of ice sheets in Antarctica and the current &quot;icehouse period&quot;.

They contribute significantly to decreasing the atmospheric CO2 levels.

==Invasive species==
This fern has been introduced to other parts of the world, including the United Kingdom, where it has become a pest in some areas. A nominally tropical plant, it has adapted to the colder climate. It can form mats up to thick and cover 100% of a water surface, preventing local insects and amphibians from reaching the surface.

==Bioremediation==

&quot;Azolla&quot; can remove chromium, nickel, copper, zinc, and lead from effluent. It can also remove lead from solutions containing 1–1000 ppm.

<doc id="507715" wikidata="Q2321067" url="?curid=507715" title="A Crow Left of the Murder...">
<text>A Crow Left of the Murder... is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Incubus, released on February 3, 2004. The album marks the first appearance of bassist Ben Kenney, following the departure of founding member Dirk Lance. The singles from the album are &quot;Megalomaniac&quot; and &quot;Talk Shows on Mute&quot;. &quot;Agoraphobia&quot; was released as a promo single.

==Music ==
The music of &quot;A Crow Left of the Murder...&quot; has been considered to have elements of art rock, alternative rock, alternative metal, jazz, pop and progressive rock. The work of guitarist Mike Einziger takes equal prominence in focus to that of vocalist Brandon Boyd, in contrast to previous albums which focused more prominently on Boyd&#x27;s vocalization. MTV reviewer Joe D&#x27;Angelo claimed that on the album Einziger&#x27;s &quot;funk and metal roots haven&#x27;t completely disappeared; they&#x27;re now just the foundation on which a repertoire of jazz, blues and progressive rock is built.&quot; Some critics believed that the band were allowed to take more musical risks on the album following the commercial success of 2001&#x27;s &quot;Morning View&quot;, although Einziger said in a 2004 interview that, &quot;we&#x27;ve never felt we didn&#x27;t have that freedom. We&#x27;ve always done what we wanted. It&#x27;s kind of self-serving, but that&#x27;s how we do it. We try not to pay attention to anything but each other.&quot;

===Songs===
Einziger has said that &quot;Megalomaniac&quot; was originally written on an acoustic guitar, despite being one of the heavier songs on the album. Boyd remarked that &quot;&#x27;Megalomaniac&#x27; means self-exaltation, and to be crazy for big things. The song is about power crazed people and their destructive behavior.&quot; He adds, &quot;lyrically speaking I know that there were a lot of things going on in and around the world and there were some very specific people in my mind coming dangerously close to having megalomaniacal tendencies and so I did my best to write those thoughts down.&quot; While it was written around the time George W. Bush ordered the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Boyd claimed the person in the song was a composite of several people, and primarily inspired by a character in the 1986 movie &quot;Three Amigos&quot;. The music video for the song was handled by Italian-Canadian director Floria Sigismondi, and had allusions to both Adolf Hitler and Bush. Sigismondi came up with the concept for the video, with Boyd reflecting in 2004 that &quot;when we did the video for &#x27;Megalomaniac,&#x27; it was a really rewarding experience. Not only the outcome, the process was very rewarding as well. She&#x27;s a great person. She knew exactly what she wanted to see and wasn&#x27;t afraid to ask for it. She wasn&#x27;t a screamer — some directors are screamers, they just yell at people. She didn&#x27;t do that, which was nice.&quot; 

Due to the political references, MTV initially refused to show the &quot;Megalomaniac&quot; video except for late at night, as it was under pressure from conservative groups following the 2004 Janet Jackson Super Bowl controversy, where one of the singer&#x27;s breasts was exposed at a halftime show they produced. In response to the Super Bowl controversy, MTV moved six potentially offensive videos to late night rotation, with &quot;Megalomaniac&quot; being the only one without any explicit sexual content. At the time, Einziger commented &quot;it&#x27;s ironic that this MTV scrutiny comes from an incident where someone bared their chest in public, while for the first time, our singer has his shirt on for an entire video.&quot;

&quot;Talk Shows on Mute&quot; was written as an examination of the effects of television on people. It was inspired by a flight where Boyd began narrating to his fellow passengers a talk show playing on the plane&#x27;s television. Boyd said that after this, &quot;I realized a time will probably come when television will watch us if we&#x27;re watching it, if that hasn&#x27;t already happened, figuratively or literally. It sounded like some sort of pseudo-Big Brother nightmare, so I wrote it down.&quot; The line, &quot;Come one, Come all into 1984&quot; does not refer to the year, where all the band members were still children, but rather George Orwell&#x27;s 1949 book &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

The song &quot;Priceless&quot; features rapping-style vocals which recall the band&#x27;s earlier work from the 1990s. Boyd said that &quot;Priceless&quot; and a few of the other songs on the album &quot;started as letters to myself&quot;, adding that &quot;I wrote a couple of the songs on the record from someone close to me&#x27;s point of view, stepping into their sight and speaking for them.&quot;

Early pressings of the album list track 12 &quot;Smile Lines&quot; as &quot;Suite Lines&quot; on the back cover. The Japanese pressing of the album comes with a bonus track, &quot;Monuments &amp; Melodies&quot; which is also available on the &quot;Alive at Red Rocks&quot; bonus CD.

==Touring and promotion==
Incubus began their world tour for the album in March 2004 with shows in Japan and South Korea. On March 12, 2004, the band played their first show in the Philippines, a country where they had attracted a large following. The band played further shows in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Europe before beginning a tour of North America in June 2004, which would continue for the rest of the year. To further promote the album in 2004, Incubus performed on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in the United Kingdom and the &quot;Rove Live&quot; talk show in Australia. At a June 2004 show in London, the band notably performed the song &quot;Take Me to Your Leader&quot; for the first time since 1998, and went on to play it eight more times that year. These 2004 performances are to date the last time a &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot;/&quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot; song has been played live.

In 2005, the band contributed the songs &quot;Admiration&quot;, &quot;Neither of Us Can See&quot; and &quot;Make a Move&quot; to the soundtrack of the action film &quot;Stealth&quot;, with &quot;Make a Move&quot; being released as a single that year. The song &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; from &quot;Morning View&quot; also appeared on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album, in addition to being used within the film itself.

==Commercial response==
&quot;A Crow Left of the Murder...&quot; debuted at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling about 332,000 copies in its first week on the chart. It has since been certified platinum by the RIAA.

==Reception==

The album was generally well received by critics upon release. Stuart Green of Canadian publication &quot;Exclaim!&quot; gave it a positive review in March 2004, he wrote &quot;with the addition of soulful Roots bassist Ben Kenney and a tasty fusion of everything from Faith No More-style rap metal to the prog-noodling of Rush (most notably on &#x27;Sick Sad Little World&#x27;, the album&#x27;s standout track) to the earnest songwriting of, say, the Beatles or the Dave Matthews Band, this disc should establish them as the leaders of the new rock pack... at least in artistry if not sales.&quot;

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic awarded the album four-and-a-half out of five stars, claiming that, &quot;at the beginning of their career, Incubus was rightly lumped in with the legions of post-Korn alt metal/rap-rock bands swarming America in the latter days of the 20th century&quot;, and that, &quot;&quot;A Crow Left of the Murder...&quot; is far more interesting than any of their other records, or their peers.&quot; Mikael Wood of the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; reflected in his review that, &quot;Southern California&#x27;s Incubus emerged from the rap-rock pack in 2001 when its hit single &#x27;Drive&#x27; revealed front man Brandon Boyd to be the kind of guy who might come back to his high school nine years after he graduated to give a motivational speech and award one lucky essay-writing girl an unforgettable dance at the senior prom. Before that the band played warmed-over funk-metal and made CDs with really awful covers.&quot; He adds, &quot;Boyd freaks his falsetto a lot, giving &#x27;Smile Lines&#x27; and &#x27;Beware! Criminal&#x27; a supple, sensual curvature that&#x27;s anathema to most rap-rockers; there&#x27;s a defanged Tori Amos/Trent Reznor pulse to &#x27;Sick Sad Little World&#x27;; &#x27;Pistola&#x27; is almost post-punk in its compact fury&#x27;.&quot; Joshua Klein of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated, &quot;&quot;A Crow Left of the Murder&quot; shows success has gone to the band&#x27;s head, but only in the best sense. Here Incubus reverts to its weirder, wilder roots without abandoning its newfound pop appeal.&quot;

Eric R. Danton of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; wrote in his February 2004 review, &quot;alternative-metal bands have tended to embody self-absorption far more than self-awareness, and we&#x27;ve all seen how that has turned out: It&#x27;s made Fred Durst wealthy in inverse proportion to his talent. Incubus, at least, has avoided many of the petulant excesses that fuel Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park. With a few pop-savvy ballads and a hottie front man in Brandon Boyd, Incubus has even attracted an audience that encompasses more than surly teen-age boys.&quot; He added, &quot;the alt-metal sound is mostly played out, but Incubus&#x27; determination to continue developing is clear here, and it will help to keep the band relevant in an increasingly splintered music scene.&quot;

In their March 2004 review, &quot;The Oklahoman&quot; wrote that, &quot;its finest moments recalls the more adventurous musical explorations of their major label debut &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;&quot;, noting that &quot;Megalomaniac&quot;, &quot;Pistola&quot;, &quot;Priceless&quot; and &quot;Leech&quot; possess a &quot;caffeine-fueled drive.&quot; They additionally observed that, &quot;of course, there had to be a couple of idealistic love ballads for the young women who really are only interested in singer Brandon Boyd. To fill that slot, the album&#x27;s &#x27;Southern Girl&#x27; and the piano-driven &#x27;Here in My Room&#x27; feature a harmony at their conclusion reminiscent of something off The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.&quot; Scott Shetler of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; gave it four out of five stars, writing &quot;like it or not, Incubus is the prototypical rock band for the 21st century, appealing equally to both sexes — they’re likable guys who write memorable songs and it doesn’t hurt that they’ve got a model for a lead singer.&quot; Shetler adds, &quot;Incubus have never made any huge leaps in terms of their sound, but they’ve always managed to change it just enough to stay slightly ahead of the pack, and with &quot;Crow&quot; they’ve simply done it again.&quot;

===Legacy===
In 2017, Dan Weiss of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; had a negative view of the band&#x27;s direction on &quot;A Crow Left of the Murder...&quot;, writing that it was &quot;their most strident record to date, and by then their eclecticism was so pared down you couldn&#x27;t hear much Faith No More or hip-hop or quirky distinctions.&quot; In his review for the &quot;Alive at Red Rocks&quot; CD/DVD, Alex Henderson of AllMusic claimed that &quot;some fans of their early rap-metal/funk metal work see 2001&#x27;s &quot;Morning View&quot; and 2004&#x27;s &quot;A Crow Left of the Murder&quot; as a sellout.&quot; In a 2006 interview with &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;, Brandon Boyd reflected, &quot;it&#x27;s funny because the way it&#x27;s perceived around the world is vastly different. For some people &quot;Crow&quot; was the best record we&#x27;ve ever done, but some people look at that record as a pause in our talent as a band.&quot;

&quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked it as the second best Incubus album in 2020, and stated it &quot;[was] the sound of Incubus maturing; finding ever-subtler applications for their melting pot of styles.&quot; Boyd also ranked it as his second favorite Incubus record in a 2022 &quot;Louder Sound&quot; article.
