<text>Pinus contorta, with the common names lodgepole pine and shore pine, and also known as twisted pine, and contorta pine, is a common tree in western North America. It is common near the ocean shore and in dry montane forests to the subalpine, but is rare in lowland rain forests. Like all pines (member species of the genus &quot;Pinus&quot;), it is an evergreen conifer.

== Description ==
Depending on subspecies, &quot;Pinus contorta&quot; grows as an evergreen shrub or tree. The shrub form is krummholz and is approximately high. The thin and narrow-crowned tree can grow high and achieve up to in diameter at chest height. The &quot;murrayana&quot; subspecies is the tallest. The crown is rounded and the top of the tree is flattened. In dense forests, the tree has a slim, conical crown. The formation of twin trees is common in some populations in British Columbia. The elastic branches stand upright or overhang and are difficult to break. The branches are covered with short shoots that are easy to remove.

The species name is &quot;contorta&quot; because of the twisted, bent pines (shore pine) found at coastal areas and the tree&#x27;s twisted needles. &quot;Pinus contorta&quot; is occasionally known under several English names: black pine, scrub pine, and coast pine. &quot;P. contorta&quot; subsp. &quot;latifolia&quot; will hybridise with the closely related jack pine (&quot;P. banksiana&quot;).

The bark of lodgepole pine is thin, scaly and grayish brown. Shore pine bark is somewhat thick and corky, fissuring into a checkered pattern. Some lodgepole pines have been reported in low elevations with features closer to those of the shore pine, including the bark.

Tamarack pine can grow up to centuries old and lodgepole pines in Yellowstone Park have survived over 300 years.

=== Foliage ===

The egg-shaped growth buds are reddish-brown and between long. They are short pointed, slightly rotated, and very resinous. Spring growth starts in beginning of April and the annual growth is completed by early July. The dark and mostly shiny needles are pointed and long and wide. The needle edge is weakly to strongly serrated. The needles are in pairs on short shoots and rotated about the shoots&#x27; longitudinal axes. In Alberta above , 1 to 5 needles occur per short shoot. A population with a high proportion of three-needled short shoots occurs in the Yukon. Needles live an average of four to six years, with a maximum of 13 years. The foliage of lodgepole pine is yellow-green as compared to shore pine, which is dark green.

=== Cones ===
The cones of lodgepole and shore pine begin to be produced when the trees are about ten years old. The cones are long, with prickles on the scales.

Many populations of the Rocky Mountain subspecies, &quot;P. contorta&quot; subsp. &quot;latifolia&quot;, have serotinous cones. This means that the cones are closed and must be exposed to high temperatures, such as from forest fires, in order to open and release their seeds. The variation in their serotiny has been correlated with wildfires and mountain pine beetle attacks. The cones of the coastal Pacific subspecies, &quot;P. contorta&quot; subsp. &quot;contorta&quot;, are typically non-serotinous, and those of the inland Pacific subspecies, &quot;P. contorta&quot; subsp. &quot;murrayana&quot;, are completely non-serotinous. Sometimes cones will become buried by the continued growth of a branch. If the seeds are collected, they have germinated as much as 150 years after confinement.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Pinus contorta&quot; occurs from upper, dry montane forests to the subalpine region of western North America. It can be found on the western side of the Cascades, in inland British Columbia, and on the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, except where it is too high and dry. Lodgepole pine can tolerate relatively hostile environments such as high-elevation volcanic rock in Central Oregon (e.g. Crater Lake) and thin soils on the eastern slope of the Cascades. Further south, the species can be found in higher elevations up to above sea level, particularly in southern Colorado. It is rare in lowland rain forests. Shore pine can be found in very infertile soils in coastal regions from Southeast Alaska to Northern California.

Lodgepole and shore pine can be found intermingled (and apparently hybridized) north of Puget Sound. Less dependent on fire, tamarack pine can be found in California&#x27;s upper mountains and mingled with lodgepole in Oregon. &quot;Pinus contorta&quot; can be found in the closed-cone pine forest of coastal California.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Pinus contorta&quot; is a fire-dependent species, requiring wildfires to maintain healthy populations of diverse ages. The thin bark of the lodgepole pine minimizes its defense to fire, although the heat of fire opens the cones to release the seeds. This allows the species to regenerate and maintain its place in the forest habitat. It otherwise fares poorly in crowds as other species are more shade tolerant, although some (e.g. firs) are more susceptible to fire.
The natural fire regime for this species is primarily driven by climate. The fires occur most often after years of drought. Forests in the upper montane to subalpine region experience much moisture in the winter via snow. The density of tree stands with the species inhibit the establishment of an understory (allowing ladder fuel to form), and surface fire is rare regardless. Thus, infrequent but severe fires dominate this species.

An example of the climate that plays a huge role in the fire regime of the species is quite complex. There are three different oscillations that play a major role in droughts. These are the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and El Niño (ENSO). A combination of these oscillations being in effect (+) or not in effect (−) have a global effect on the water available to these forests. The combination of AMO +, ENSO − and PDO − means there is going to be a drought and likely a severe subalpine fire.
&quot;Suillus tomentosus&quot;, a fungus, produces specialized structures called tuberculate ectomycorrhizae with the roots of lodgepole pine (&quot;Pinus contorta&quot; var. &quot;latifolia&quot;). These structures have been shown to be the location of concentrations of nitrogen-fixing bacteria which contribute a significant amount of nitrogen to tree growth and allow the pines to colonize nutrient-poor sites.

Porcupines consume the inner bark of lodgepole pine.

=== Threats ===
Larger members of the species are attacked by mountain pine beetles, which it fights with pitch but can be overwhelmed. It is also affected by blue stain fungus (&quot;Grosmannia clavigera&quot;), which the mountain pine beetle carries in its mouth. Dwarf mistletoe also leeches off the species. Both the threat of pine beetles and dwarf mistletoe are curbed by wildfires, which occurred less in the 20th century due to firefighting. More recently, unthreatening lightning-sparked fires have been allowed to burn in wilderness areas in Idaho and Montana. Exceptional cold can kill some of the beetles.

A study released in 2011 concluded that &quot;Pinus contorta&quot; could experience significant reductions in distribution due to climate change by the late 21st century.

=== As an invasive species ===
&quot;Pinus contorta&quot; is considered a serious invasive species of wilding conifer in New Zealand, along with several other western North American pine species. It is listed on the National Pest Plant Accord and is prohibited from sale, commercial propagation, and distribution.

== Subspecies ==
There are four subspecies of &quot;Pinus contorta&quot;, and one of them is sometimes considered to have two varieties. The subspecies are sometimes treated at the rank of variety.

== Uses ==

=== Construction ===
The common name &quot;lodgepole pine&quot; comes from the custom of Native Americans using the tall, straight trees to construct lodges (tepees) in the Rocky Mountain area. Lodgepole pine was used by European settlers to build log cabins. Logs are still used in rural areas as posts, fences, lumber, and firewood. Shore pine pitch has historically been used as glue.

Tree plantations of &quot;Pinus contorta&quot; have been planted extensively in Norway, Sweden, Ireland and the UK for forestry, such as timber uses. In Iceland it is used for reforestation and afforestation purposes. It is also commonly used for pressure-treated lumber throughout North America.

=== Food ===
Native Americans consumed the inner bark of lodgepole pine to prevent starvation for themselves and their horses. The lodgepole pine cambium layer&#x27;s edibility is dependent on thickness, consistency, and sweetness.

=== Medicinal ===
The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest and of California used different parts of the plant internally and externally as a traditional medicine for various ailments. The gum of shore pine was used medicinally as well as for chewing.

=== Cultivation ===
&quot;Pinus contorta&quot; is cultivated as an ornamental tree by the horticulture industry. Plant nurseries grow &quot;Pinus contorta&quot; subsp. &quot;contorta&quot; and &quot;Pinus contorta&quot; subsp. &quot;murrayana&quot; for use in traditional and wildlife gardens, and as smaller selections of the native plant for natural landscaping. The shore pine&#x27;s smaller varieties and cultivars are also used in container gardening, including as large bonsai specimens.

Cultivars of this species include:
* &quot;Chief Joseph&quot;, a dwarf variety of &quot;Pinus contorta &quot;var&quot;. latifolia&quot; grown for its yellow winter needles
* &quot;Spaan&#x27;s Dwarf&quot;, a dwarf variety of &quot;Pinus contorta &quot;var&quot;. contorta&quot; that grows wider than it grows tall

The cultivar &quot;Chief Joseph&quot; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

=== Emblem ===
Lodgepole pine is the provincial tree of Alberta, Canada.

<text>The Manistee National Forest is a national forest located in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. It has a total area of . It was established in 1938, and combined with the Huron National Forest in 1945 for administrative purposes, creating the Huron-Manistee National Forests. However, they are two separate forest units, as they are not connected. The area is popular for hiking, fishing, camping, boating, snowmobiling, cross-country skiing and hunting. The North Country Trail passes through it, and connects with the 11-mile Manistee River Trail to form a 23-mile loop. The highest point in the lower peninsula, Briar Hill (1,706 ft), is located here. The Manistee National Forest is not one continuous mass, but is a &quot;mosaic&quot; broken by private property and towns. The headquarters for the forest is in Cadillac, Michigan.

==History==
Unique among National Forests in its creation, the Manistee National Forest was created from tax-forfeited lands and purchases after the logging era had ended. The large areas of cutover timber were not very suitable for farming, and much of the burned over forest land had still not yet regenerated to trees by the 1930s.

Around the 1920s when reforestation and conservation was taking off in Michigan, there was a movement across the United States for the conservation of the remaining forests and wildlife, including on the federal level under the leadership of President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Manistee National Forest. One of his primary goals was to replant the cutover areas, which was done by his recently created Civilian Conservation Corps, which employed young men during the Great Depression and was responsible for replanting most of Michigan&#x27;s barren lands.

==Geography==
The terrain is mostly forest underlain by sedimentary rocks, covered by a mantle of glacial drift as much as 1,000 feet thick. Glacial moraines, outwash plains, deltas, lacustrine deposits, and old shorelines are common. Soils originating from these landscapes are predominately sand. Aquifers within glacial deposits are common and feed thousands of miles of cold water streams at a relatively constant rate throughout the year. 

The forest consists of a mix of hardwoods and pines, with red pine &quot;(pinus resinosa)&quot; as the most dominant species. A common feature of all Michigan National Forests are the large straight rows of planted red pines, which were planted by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Today many are over 75 ft tall and constitute a significant source of revenue from timber sales. The largest contiguous red pine plantation in North America is in the Manistee National Forest, called the Kellog Plantation.

In descending order of land area the Manistee National Forest lies in parts of Lake, Newaygo, Wexford, Manistee, Mason, Oceana, Muskegon, Mecosta, and Montcalm counties. There are local ranger district offices located in Baldwin and Manistee.

The Lumberjack 100, a 100-mile ultra-endurance mountain bike race is held annually within its bounds.

Dispersed camping is free on National Forest lands, as long as you follow the guidelines found on the USFS website. However, some rustic campgrounds do require a reservation or camping fee. A wood permit is required to cut firewood. Wood permits are valid for the Manistee National Forest only, and exclude the Huron National Forest.

==Features==
The Nordhouse Dunes Wilderness is a unique feature of the Manistee National Forest. This relatively small area of , situated on the east shore of Lake Michigan is one of the few wilderness areas in the U.S. with an extensive lake shore dunes ecosystem. Most of the dunes are 3500 to 4000 years old and some stand about higher than the lake. The Nordhouse Dunes are interspersed with woody vegetation such as juniper, jack pine and hemlock. There are many small water holes and marshes dotting the landscape and dune grass covers many of the dunes. The beach is wide and sandy.

Briar Hill is the second highest point in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, at 1,706 ft. It is of glacial origin and consists of mostly second growth hardwoods. There are no marked trails to the summit, which provides limited views of the surrounding area. The footings of the old steel firetower still remain, as well as a USGS survey marker, in which it misspells the hill as &quot;Brier Hill&quot;.

Caberfae Peaks Ski &amp; Golf Resort is located in the Manistee National Forest, in the Caberfae Hills region that receives large amounts of lake-effect snow. The official opening was in January 1938, making it one of the oldest ski resorts in the US.

Several rivers flow through its boundaries, most notably the Manistee, Pere-Marquette, Pine, Muskegon, and the Little Manistee. These were important for transporting logs to the mills during the lumber boom, and now serve as popular destinations for canoeing, fishing, hunting, and hiking.

Among the many areas to hike is a 23-mile loop trail, which is formed with the Manistee River Trail and the North Country Scenic Trail. This loop can be accessed from the Red Bridge and Seaton Creek accesses (Manistee River Trail) and the Marilla and Upper River Road Trailheads (North Country Scenic Trail). Many backpackers plan 2–3 days to hike the complete loop, setting up backcountry campsites overnight.

<text>HMCS &quot;Haida&quot; is a that served in the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) from 1943 to 1963, participating in World War II and the Korean War. She was named after the Haida people Haida was inspected by commissioner for Canada Vincent Massey shortly after her commissioning in 1943.

The only surviving Tribal-class destroyer out of 27 vessels constructed for the RCN, the Royal Navy, and the Royal Australian Navy between 1937 and 1945, &quot;Haida&quot; sank more enemy surface tonnage than any other Canadian warship and as such is commonly referred to as the &quot;Fightingest Ship in the Royal Canadian Navy&quot;.

Designated a national historic site of Canada in 1984, she now serves as a museum ship berthed next to , an active Royal Canadian Naval Reserve Division, in Hamilton, Ontario. In 2018, &quot;Haida&quot; was designated the ceremonial flagship of the RCN.

==Design and description==
The Tribals were designed to fight heavily armed destroyers of other navies, such as the Japanese . Canada chose the design based on its armament, with the size and power of the Tribal class allowing them to act more like small cruisers than as fleet destroyers. &quot;Haida&quot; was among the first batch of Tribal-class destroyers ordered by the RCN in 1940–1941. They were ordered with modified ventilation and heating systems for North Atlantic winter service. &quot;Haida&quot;″s design was modified after deficiencies were noted in the lead ship of the Canadian Tribals, .

&quot;Haida&quot;, as one of the British-built Tribal-class destroyers, was long between perpendiculars and long overall with a beam of and a draught of . As built, the destroyer displaced standard and at deep load. &quot;Haida&quot; had a complement of 14 officers and 245 ratings.

The destroyer was propelled by two shafts driven by two Parsons geared turbines powered by steam created by three Admiralty-type three-drum boilers. This created and gave the ship a maximum speed of . The destroyers could carry of fuel oil.

As built, &quot;Haida&quot; was fitted with six quick-firing Mk XII guns placed in three twin turrets, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from bow to stern. The turrets were placed on 40° mountings with open-backed shields. The ship also had one twin turret of QF Mk XVI guns in the &#x27;X&#x27; position. For secondary anti-aircraft armament, the destroyer was equipped with four single-mounted 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; guns. The vessel was also fitted with four torpedo tubes for Mk IX torpedoes.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Haida&quot;″s keel was laid down by Vickers-Armstrongs, Ltd. at their shipyard in Newcastle-upon-Tyne on 29 September 1941 with the yard number 41. The destroyer was launched on 25 August 1942 and commissioned into RCN service on 30 August 1943. She underwent workups under her first commanding officer, H.G. DeWolf before reporting to the British Home Fleet at Scapa Flow in October 1943.
After commissioning &quot;Haida&quot; was assigned to the Royal Navy&#x27;s Home Fleet. On 15 November the convoy JW 54A sailed from Loch Ewe. &quot;Haida&quot; was among the destroyers that joined the escort from 18 to 24 November 1943. On 28 November &quot;Haida&quot; was among the destroyer escort for the Russian convoy RA 54B, protecting it until it reached Loch Ewe on 9 December without loss. The convoy JW 55B sailed from Loch Ewe for Russia on 20 December. &quot;Haida&quot; was a member of its ocean escort. The was deployed to intercept the convoy. While the cruisers escorting the convoy kept the German vessel at bay, &quot;Haida&quot; and the other escorting destroyers shepherded the convoy away from danger until the German battleship was sunk by a British force. On 23 December the convoy was attacked by Junkers Ju 88 bombers, but escaped unscathed. &quot;Haida&quot; joined the escort of RA 55B on the return journey to the UK which sailed from Kola Inlet on 31 December and arrived on 8 January 1944.

=== Operations along the French coast ===
On 10 January 1944, she was reassigned to the 10th Destroyer Flotilla at Plymouth and took part in the Operation Tunnel and Operation Hostile sweeps in the Bay of Biscay and along the French coast of the English Channel. The 10th Flotilla, with the cruisers and , formed Force 26. By April, &quot;Haida&quot; had sailed on nineteen of the Operation Tunnel/Hostile missions.

During the night of 25/26 April, &quot;Haida&quot;, with &quot;Black Prince&quot; and the destroyers , , and engaged the German 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla comprising the German s &quot;T29&quot;, &quot;T24&quot; and &quot;T27&quot;. Despite the German designation as &#x27;torpedo boat&#x27;, the Elbings were essentially on a par with mid-sized Allied destroyers, having just slightly smaller armament. &quot;T27&quot; was hit early and retired to Morlaix, &quot;Haida&quot; sank &quot;T29&quot;, and &quot;T24&quot; was damaged before making St. Malo.
On the night of 28/29 April &quot;T24&quot; and &quot;T27&quot; attempted to move from St. Malo to Brest and encountered the destroyers &quot;Athabaskan&quot; and &quot;Haida&quot; off St. Brieux, which were performing a covering sweep as part of Operation Hostile. &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was torpedoed and sunk in the engagement. &quot;T24&quot; is credited with the sinking the ship. &quot;Haida&quot; ran &quot;T27&quot; aground and set the vessel afire with shelling, to be later destroyed by &quot;MTB 673&quot;. Of the &quot;Athabaskan&quot;″s crew 128 were lost, 44 survivors were recovered by &quot;Haida&quot;, and 83 survivors became prisoners of war of the Germans in France.

&quot;Haida&quot; continued the Operation Hostile sorties in company of sister ship &quot;Huron&quot; during the weeks leading up to Operation Overlord. The 10th Destroyer Flotilla were part of the covering force for surface attacks at the western entrance of the English Channel during the invasion of Normandy. On 8–9 June, &quot;Haida&quot; was part of Task Force 26 which engaged the German 8th Destroyer Flotilla, comprising &quot;Z32&quot;, &quot;Z24&quot;, and &quot;T24&quot; northwest of the Île de Bas. &quot;Haida&quot; and &quot;Huron&quot; combined to sink &quot;Z32&quot; in the Battle of Ushant. Following the fall of Cherbourg to the Allies, the German E-boats were transferred to Le Havre, freeing up the 10th Flotilla. The flotilla was then given the dual role of covering Allied motor torpedo boat flotillas, and search and sink missions against German shipping along the French coast.

On 24 June, while on patrol in the English Channel off Land&#x27;s End, investigated a 311 Squadron&#x27;s Liberator bomber dropping depth charges on a target. &quot;Haida&quot; and the British destroyer began their own depth charge attacks after being informed that a submarine had been spotted. After several attacks, the submarine surfaced and attempted to run. &quot;Haida&quot; and &quot;Eskimo&quot; fired all their guns and sank ;&quot;Haida&quot; rescued six survivors. On 14/15 July 1944, &quot;Haida&quot; and intercepted a group of German ships in the Île de Groix area near Lorient. The battle saw two submarine chasers, &quot;UJ 1420&quot; and &quot;UJ 1421&quot;, destroyed, one German merchant ship sunk, and two others set afire. On 5–6 August, &quot;Haida&quot; was part of a force engaged in an Operation Kinetic sweep. The force attacked a German convoy north of the Île de Yeu and sank the minesweepers &quot;M 263&quot; and &quot;M 486&quot;, the patrol boat &quot;V 414&quot; and the coastal launch &quot;Otto&quot;. During the battle a shell exploded in one of &quot;Haida&quot;″s turrets and started a fire, killing two and injuring eight, knocking the turret out of action. Staying in the line of battle, the destroyers were engaged by shore batteries when they attempted to take on a second convoy and were forced to withdraw without doing much damage to the German merchant vessels.

=== Refit and northern operations ===
&quot;Haida&quot; departed Western Europe on 22 September for Halifax, Nova Scotia, arriving on 29 September. The destroyer returned to Scapa Flow in mid-January 1945 after refitting to receive new radar. On 19 March &quot;Haida&quot; escorted aircraft carriers in minelaying operations off Granesund, Norway and assisted in attacks on shipping off Trondheim from 24 to 28 March. On 7 April, &quot;Haida&quot; escorted seven anti-submarine warfare vessels from Greenock, Scotland destined for Soviet use at Vaenga, on the Kola Inlet.
The destroyer was among the escort for convoy JW 66 that set out from the River Clyde on 16 April. &quot;Haida&quot; experienced one of the last RCN engagements of the Second World War when she escorted convoy RA 66 from Vaenga from 29 April to 2 May. The convoy was attacked in transit, and &quot;Haida&quot; and &quot;Huron&quot; were attacked by torpedoes fired by U-boats, which narrowly missed. In the skirmish, two German U-boats and the British frigate were sunk, and the convoy escaped in a snowstorm. &quot;Haida&quot; and &quot;Huron&quot; returned to Scapa Flow on 6 May and were assigned to relief operations at Trondheimsfjord, Norway on 17 May. From 29 to 31 May, &quot;Haida&quot;, &quot;Huron&quot;, the cruiser and the 5th Escort Group were sent to Trondheim to take over custody of surrendered U-boats.

&quot;Haida&quot;, &quot;Huron&quot; and &quot;Iroquois&quot;, left for Halifax on 4 June to refit as part of Canada&#x27;s contribution to Operation Downfall. They arrived on 10 June and &quot;Haida&quot; started a tropicalization refit, that was suspended after the surrender of Japan later that summer. &quot;Haida&quot; was paid off on 20 March 1946.

=== Cold War operations ===

&quot;Haida&quot; was in inactive reserve for approximately one year but was prepared for reactivation in 1947 and underwent a refit for updated armament and sensors. This involved replacing the main armament, with the 4.7-inch guns removed and two twin Mk XVI 4-inch gun mounts installed forward and a twin /50 calibre gun mount installed aft. The ship was given a Mk 63 fire control director for its guns. One turret was completely removed and replaced by two Squid anti-submarine mortars placed on the quarterdeck. A short aluminum mast was installed and the funnels were fitted with caps.

&quot;Haida&quot; was equipped with Type 275, SPS-10, SPS-6, Type 293 and 262 radars and Type 140 and 174 sonars. While in refit, fire gutted the wheelhouse and boiler tubes burst later during speed trials. She returned to the fleet, still carrying the pennant number G63, in May 1947.

&quot;Haida&quot; and her sister ship participated in exercises between the RCN&#x27;s Atlantic Fleet and the United States Navy and Royal Navy over the next several years and were the first RCN ships to penetrate Hudson Bay in Fall 1948. &quot;Haida&quot; was involved in assisting during the grounding of the aircraft carrier off Port Mouton, Nova Scotia on 4 June 1949. In November 1949, &quot;Haida&quot; rescued the 18 members of the crew of a United States Air Force B-29 bomber that crashed in the Atlantic Ocean. That December, &quot;Haida&quot; was downgraded to a depot and accommodation ship in Halifax.

When the Korean War started on 25 June 1950, &quot;Haida&quot; was once again activated for war duty. She was converted to a destroyer escort and began refit in July 1950, with various new armaments, sensors and communications systems. She was recommissioned on 15 March 1952 and carried the pennant DDE 215. She departed Halifax on 27 September for Sasebo, Japan, arriving there on 6 November after passing through the Panama Canal.

&quot;Haida&quot; relieved &quot;Nootka&quot; on 18 November off the west coast of Korea, and had an uneventful patrol, performing aircraft carrier screening and inshore patrol missions, returning to Sasebo to replenish on 29 November. She patrolled off the east coast of Korea beginning on 4 December and took part with the destroyer escort in shelling of a railway yard in Songjin, a coastal battery, and North Korean troops. On 18–19 December, &quot;Haida&quot; failed to join the exclusive &quot;Trainbusters Club&quot; when an enemy train she attacked managed to hide in a nearby tunnel. &quot;Haida&quot; returned to patrol on 3 January 1953, escorting aircraft carriers and bombarding the coast. On 29 January, &quot;Haida&quot; entered the &quot;Trainbusters Club&quot;, destroying a train north of Riwon. The destroyer eliminated a second train on 26 May, and detonated a drifting anti-ship mine on her return to Paengyang-do. She departed Sasebo on 12 June, heading west through the Suez Canal and arrived in Halifax on 22 July 1953.

&quot;Haida&quot; departed Halifax for a second Korean tour on 14 December 1953, passing through the Panama Canal and arriving in theatre on 5 February 1954. North Korea and China were not respecting the cease fire; infractions necessitated a naval presence around South Korea. The destroyer departed the Korean theatre on 12 September 1954 and headed for Halifax via the Suez Canal once again, arriving on 1 November.

Following the Korean operations, &quot;Haida&quot; embarked on Cold War anti-submarine warfare duties with other NATO units in the North Atlantic and West Indies. In May 1956, &quot;Haida&quot;, accompanied by &quot;Iroquois&quot; and &quot;Huron&quot; made port visits to cities and towns along the Saint Lawrence River.

&quot;Haida&quot;″s aging hull and infrastructure was becoming troublesome, and in January 1958 she went into refit for hull repairs and protection for electronic equipment. Further refits in 1959 corrected various problems, and she sailed for the West Indies in January 1960; however, further equipment failures culminating in the failure of her steering gear on 3 April forced her to return to Halifax. A hull survey in May found extensive corrosion and cracking, forcing her into drydock for the remainder of the year. She undertook further repairs in June and July 1961 after further cracking was found during operations in heavy seas that March. More cracks were detected in March 1962, which forced a refit through February 1963.

== Preservation ==
With the writing on the wall, &quot;Haida&quot; undertook her last assignment, a summer tour of the Great Lakes. She departed Halifax on 25 April 1963 with a mobile television studio on board. She undertook various public tours and weapons training during the tour; one of the individuals to tour her was a former RCN rating named Neil Bruce. Bruce foresaw that she was destined for scrapping and formed HAIDA Inc. with four others as a means of attempting to acquire her for preservation. On 30 April 1963, the ship was paid off for the last time.

&quot;Haida&quot; returned to Halifax and was placed in Category C reserve at the navy base in Sydney. Crown Assets announced &quot;Haida&quot; would be scrapped in 1964 as part of cutbacks to the RCN. HAIDA Inc. placed a bid of $20,000 and won possession on the grounds of restoration. After preparing the ship, the RCN towed the vessel to Marine Industries Limited shipyard at Sorel, Quebec where she became civilian property.

The Naval Reserve Division provided a skeleton crew for &quot;Haida&quot; as she was towed to Toronto by two tugboats. She arrived on 25 August 1964 with guest of honour, retired Vice-Admiral Harry DeWolf, who was the destroyer&#x27;s first commanding officer. &quot;Haida&quot; was restored and reacquired the pennant G63 while docked at the foot of York Street.

She opened as an attraction in August 1965 at the pier on York Street. Initially the city of Toronto had planned to build a &quot;Serviceman&#x27;s Memorial Park&quot; near the Princes&#x27; Gates at nearby Exhibition Place to link with the &quot;Haida&quot; preservation efforts. The organization HAIDA Inc. ran into financial difficulties during the late 1960s and title to the ship was transferred to the provincial government for $1. In 1970, &quot;Haida&quot; was moved to Ontario Place at the west end of the Toronto waterfront, where it was turned into an attraction until 2002. The guns on the vessel were fired whenever the Toronto Symphony played Tchaikovsky&#x27;s 1812 Overture at the nearby Forum, the outdoor in-the-round concert stage at Ontario Place. The vessel was also used as a Royal Canadian Sea Cadets training facility.

==HMCS &quot;Haida&quot; National Historic Site==

In 2002, at the urging of Hamilton, Ontario MP Sheila Copps, Parks Canada purchased &quot;Haida&quot; from the provincial government and towed her (with great difficulty) from her Ontario Place dock to a shipyard at Port Weller for a $5 million refit to her hull. She was taken to a new home on the Hamilton waterfront and arrived to an 11-gun salute from 31 Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps &quot;Lion&quot; and her 12-pounder naval field gun on 30 August 2003, the 60th anniversary of her commissioning into the RCN. The destroyer is now a National Historic Site and is a museum ship on the Hamilton waterfront in front of Hamilton&#x27;s Naval Reserve Division, .

In July 2006 &quot;Haida&quot; was &quot;twinned&quot; with the Polish destroyer &quot;Błyskawica&quot; in a ceremony in Gdynia, Poland. Both ships served in the 10th Destroyer Flotilla during the Second World War. The ceremony was attended by former crew members of both ships and the general public. The ship was visited in 2009 by Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and, on June 29, 2010, at Government House in Nova Scotia, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, presented to representatives of HMCS &quot;Haida&quot; the World Ship Trust Certificate. In September 2016, the ship was towed to Heddle Marine to undergo repairs and upgrades. The repairs took until December 2016 to complete. In February 2018, &quot;Haida&quot; was designated the ceremonial flagship of the Canadian Navy, now marked by the hoisting of a Haida tribal flag.

===Affiliations and organizations===
There is also a Sea Cadet Corps named after the ship, located in Streetsville, Mississauga. 186 Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps Haida, was established on 9 January 1963. The museum is affiliated with the Canadian Museums Association, Canadian Heritage Information Network, Organization of Military Museums of Canada and the Virtual Museum of Canada.

<text>In photography and cinematography, a filter is a camera accessory consisting of an optical filter that can be inserted into the optical path. The filter can be of a square or oblong shape and mounted in a holder accessory, or, more commonly, a glass or plastic disk in a metal or plastic ring frame, which can be screwed into the front of or clipped onto the camera lens.

Filters modify the images recorded. Sometimes they are used to make only subtle changes to images; other times the image would simply not be possible without them. In monochrome photography, coloured filters affect the relative brightness of different colours; red lipstick may be rendered as anything from almost white to almost black with different filters. Others change the colour balance of images, so that photographs under incandescent lighting show colours as they are perceived, rather than with a reddish tinge. There are filters that distort the image in a desired way, diffusing an otherwise sharp image, adding a starry effect, etc. Linear and circular polarising filters reduce oblique reflections from non-metallic surfaces.

==Overview==
Many filters absorb part of the light available, necessitating longer exposure. As the filter is in the optical path, any imperfections – non-flat or non-parallel surfaces, reflections (minimised by optical coating), scratches, dirt – affect the image.

In digital photography the majority of filters used with film cameras have been rendered redundant by digital filters applied either in-camera or during post processing. Exceptions include the ultraviolet (UV) filter typically used to protect the front surface of the lens, the neutral density (ND) filter, the polarising filter, color-enhancing filters, and the infra red (IR) filter. The neutral density filter permits effects requiring wide apertures or long exposures to be applied to brightly lit scenes, while the graduated neutral density filter is useful in situations where the scene&#x27;s dynamic range exceeds the capability of the sensor. Not using optical filters in front of the lens has the advantage of avoiding the reduction of image quality caused by the presence of an extra optical element in the light path and may be necessary to avoid vignetting when using wide-angle lenses.

===Nomenclature===

There is no universal or reliably standard naming or labelling system for filters. The Wratten numbers adopted in the early twentieth century by Kodak, then a dominant force in film photography, are used by several manufacturers, including B+W, but the actual spectral characteristics of a filter may vary by manufacturer, despite having the same Wratten number. In addition, the Wratten numbers are sometimes used interchangeably with alternative names; for example, the Wratten filter number 6 is also named K1, while #11 is also named X1.
Some manufacturers use a combination of Wratten numbers and wavelengths to identify filters. For example, Nikon offers four UV / skylight filters: L1A, L1B, L37, and L39; the L1A and L1B correspond to Wratten numbers 1A and 1B, while L37 and L39 include the wavelength cutoffs of 370 nm and 390 nm, respectively. Colored filters used to enhance contrast for black and white photography include a letter (Y, O, or R) and a similar wavelength cutoff: for example, R60 is a red filter with a step-like transmission function at 600 nm. For other filters, the alternate Wratten name is used (for example, X0 and X1 for green filters).

Many colour correction filters are identified by a code of the form CC&quot;b&quot;, for example, CC50Y:
* CC = type (for colour correction)
* = strength or density of the filter (50 = 50%)
* &quot;b&quot; = color (in this case, Y for yellow)

While the same information may be present, the specific sequence of colour and density may vary by manufacturer.

==Scientific uses==

&quot;Optical filters&quot; are used in various areas of science, including in particular astronomy; photographic filters are roughly the same as &quot;optical&quot; filters, but in practice optical filters often need far more accurately controlled optical properties and precisely defined transmission curves than filters only made for general photography. Photographic filters sell in larger quantities, at correspondingly lower prices, than many laboratory filters. The article on optical filters has information relevant to photographic filters, particularly special-purpose photographic filters like &quot;color enhancing&quot; filters and high-quality photographic filters, like sharp cut-off UV filters.

==Photographic uses==

Filters in photography can be classified according to their visible color and use:
* Colorless / Neutral
** Clear and ultraviolet
** Infrared
** Polarizing
** Neutral density, including the graduated neutral density filter and solar filter
* Color
** Color conversion (or color balance)
** Color correction
** Color separation, also called color subtraction
** Contrast enhancement
* Special effects of various kinds, including
** Graduated color, called color grads
** Cross screen and star diffractors
** Diffusion and contrast reduction
** Close-up or macro diopters, and split diopters or split focus
** Multi-image
** Spot

===Colorless / Neutral===
====Clear and ultraviolet====
Clear filters, also known as window glass filters or optical flats, are transparent and (ideally) perform no filtering of incoming light. The only use of a clear filter is to protect the front of a lens.

Clear glass will absorb some UV.

UV filters are used to block invisible ultraviolet light, to which most photographic sensors and film are at least slightly sensitive. The UV is typically recorded as if it were blue light, so this non-human UV sensitivity can result in an unwanted exaggeration of the bluish tint of atmospheric haze or, even more unnaturally, of subjects in open shade lit by the ultraviolet-rich sky.

Normally, the glass or plastic of a camera lens is practically opaque to short-wavelength UV, but transparent to long-wavelength (near-visible) UV. A UV filter passes all or nearly all of the visible spectrum but blocks virtually all ultraviolet radiation. (Most spectral manipulation filters are named for the radiation they pass; green and infrared filters &quot;pass&quot; their named colors, but a UV filter &quot;blocks&quot; UV.) It can be left on the lens for nearly all shots: UV filters are often used mainly for lens protection in the same way as clear filters. A strong UV filter, such as a Haze-2A or UV17, cuts off some visible light in the violet part of the spectrum, and has a pale yellow color; these strong filters are more effective at cutting haze, reduce purple fringing in digital cameras, and can subtly darken pale blue skies – which improves contrast between sky and clouds. Strong UV filters are also sometimes used for warming color photos taken in shade with daylight-type film. They were originally developed to increase contrast in airborne surveillance photography, and were adopted by mountaineering photographers to remedy the strong UV at high altitude.

While in certain cases, such as harsh environments, a protection filter may be necessary, there are also downsides to this practice. Arguments for the use of protection filters include:
* If the lens is dropped, the filter may well suffer scratches or breakage instead of the front lens element.
* The filter can be cleaned frequently without damage to the lens surface or coatings; a filter scratched by cleaning is much less expensive to replace than a lens.
* If there is blowing sand the filter will protect the front of the lens from abrasion and nicks.
* A few lenses, such as some of Canon&#x27;s L series lenses, require the use of a filter to complete their weather sealing.

Arguments against their use include:
* Adding another element may degrade image quality if its surfaces are less than perfectly flat and parallel. Filters from reputable makers are very unlikely to cause any problems, but some &quot;bargain&quot; products are optically inferior.
* The two additional reflections at air-glass interfaces inevitably result in some light loss – at least four percent at each interface, if the surfaces are uncoated; they also increase the potential for lens flare problems.
* Low-quality filters may cause problems with autofocus.
* A filter may be incompatible with the use of a lens hood, since not all filters have the required threading for a screw-in hood or will allow a clip-on hood to be attached. Adding a lens hood on top of one or more filters may space the hood away from the lens enough to cause some vignetting.

There is a wide variation in the spectral UV blocking by filters described as ultraviolet.

====Infrared====
Unlike ultraviolet filters, which are suitable for general photography as they are designed to attenuate shorter ultraviolet wavelengths and pass visible wavelengths, filters for infrared photography are designed to block portions of the visible spectrum while passing longer wavelengths of light in the infrared spectrum, and hence they may appear dark red to black in color.

Historically, the Wratten number has been used to describe the spectral absorption characteristics of filters used with infrared photography. Common types include filters in the Wratten #87, 88, and 89 series; since Wratten numbers were assigned sequentially, there is no consistent logic (for instance, the #89B filter has a transition wavelength where the filter achieves 50% transmittance at approximately 720 nm, while #87 has its transition wavelength at approximately 795 nm. Because black-and-white infrared film retains significant sensitivity to blue wavelengths, sometimes red and orange filters are used to decrease contrast.

Other manufacturers may embed the transition wavelength in the name of the filter. For example, the Hoya R72 (720 nm) and RM90 (900 nm) are intended for infrared photography, corresponding to Wratten No. 89B and 87B, respectively. For use with color infrared film, some manufacturers advise filters which restrict blue and green visible wavelengths, but pass most of the red spectrum, with a transition wavelength around 550 nm.

====Polarizer====
A polarizing filter, used for both color and black-and-white photography, is colourless and does not affect colour balance, but filters out light with a particular direction of polarisation. This reduces oblique reflections from non-metallic surfaces, can darken the sky in colour photography (in monochrome photography colour filters are more effective), and can saturate the image more by eliminating unwanted reflections.

Linear polarising filters, while effective, can interfere with metering and auto-focus mechanisms when mirrors or beam-splitters are in the light path, as in the digital single lens reflex camera; a circular polarizer is also effective, and does not affect metering or auto-focus.

====Neutral density====

A neutral density filter (ND filter) is a filter of uniform density which attenuates light of all colors equally. It is used to allow a longer exposure (to create blur) or larger aperture (for selective focus) than otherwise required for correct exposure in the prevailing light conditions, without changing the tonal balance of the photograph.

A graduated neutral density filter is a neutral density filter with different attenuation at different points, typically clear in one half shading into a higher density in the other. It can be used, for example, to photograph a scene with part in deep shadow and part brightly lit, where otherwise either the shadows would have no detail or the highlights would be burnt out.

===Color filters===
====Color conversion====

Appropriate color conversion filters are used to compensate for colour casts caused by lighting not balanced for the film stock&#x27;s rated color temperature, which is usually 3200–3400 K for use with professional incandescent light sources and 5500–5700 K for daylight. Color conversion filters attenuate a range of visible wavelengths to shift the perceived color temperature. The need for these filters has been greatly reduced by the widespread adoption of digital photography, since color balance may be corrected with camera settings as the image is captured, or by software manipulation afterwards.

These color conversion filters are identified by non-standardised numbers which vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. Many filter manufacturers use the Wratten number or make reference to it. The Wratten numbers were assigned sequentially as applications were created (80&quot;x&quot; and 82&quot;x&quot; for blue cooling filters, 81&quot;x&quot; and 85&quot;x&quot; for amber warming filters), so there is no systematic logic that ties the number to its effect: for example, the 80A filter has the strongest &quot;cooling&quot; effect, followed by the 80B, and both are stronger than the 82C, which is stronger in turn than the 82B. The 80/85 series are regarded as &quot;color conversion&quot; filters, while the corresponding 82/81 series are &quot;light balancing filters&quot; which generally have a weaker effect than the 80/85 series. Typically, the 80A blue filter used with film for daylight use corrects the perceived orange/reddish cast of incandescent photographic photoflood lights, and significantly improves the stronger cast produced by lower-temperature household incandescent lighting, while the 85B amber filter will correct the bluish cast of daylight photographs on tungsten film.
To avoid confusion and to assist photographers in selecting the appropriate filter, some manufacturers, including B+W, Rodenstock, and Hoya, include or use the mired shift to name their filters, which quantifies the effect of a color conversion filter. The mired value associated with a given color temperature is computed as the reciprocal of the color temperature, in Kelvin, multiplied by formula_1:

formula_2

The shift is the difference in the mired values of the film and light source. Sometimes the decamired is used, where 10 mired = 1 decamired, as the smallest perceptible color temperature change is from a 10 mired shift.

formula_3


From the equation, when the film has a higher color temperature than the light source, a negative mired shift is required, which calls for a &quot;cooling&quot; filter; these have a perceptible blue color, and the more saturated the color, the stronger the cooling effect. Likewise, when the film has a lower color temperature than the light source, a positive mired shift is required, which calls for an amber &quot;warming&quot; filter.

Stacking color conversion filters creates an additive mired shift: for example, stacking a Wratten 80A (-130 mired) with a Wratten 82C (-60 mired) results in a total mired shift of -190. A typical set of color conversion filters has a geometric sequence, e.g. ±15, ±30, ±60, and ±120 mired, which corresponds approximately to the pattern of the Wratten filters, and allows intermediate values to be obtained by stacking.

====Color correction====
Color conversion and light balancing (LB) filters must be distinguished from color correction filters (CC filters), which filter out a particular color cast that may have various causes, including reflections from colored surfaces, fluorescent lighting (which has an unbalanced spectrum), underwater photography, or the Schwarzschild effect (also known as reciprocity failure).

In general, CC filters are supplied in densities varying between 5 and 50% in primary colors, both additive (red, green, and blue) and subtractive (cyan, magenta, and yellow). They may be used for graphic effect or to compensate for differences in color balance between film batches for critical work. Fluorescent filters generally have a magenta hue, selectively absorbing excessive green light, and have a name which includes the letters FL, such as FL-D for use with daylight balanced film.

====Color subtraction====
Color subtraction filters work by absorbing certain colors of light, letting the remaining colors through. They can be used to demonstrate the primary colors that make up an image. They are perhaps most frequently used in the printing industry for color separations, and again, use has diminished as digital solutions have become more advanced and abundant.

Didymium filters, sold as &quot;color enhancement&quot; or &quot;fall color&quot; filters act similarly: They remove a narrow (or broad) band of color in the yellow part of the spectrum (589 nm). Some astronomical filters similarly use didymium in heavier concentration. Even astronomical filters which don&#x27;t use didymium typically are some kind of narrow pass-band color filter.

==== Contrast enhancement ====

Colored filters are commonly used in black and white photography to alter the effect of different colors in the scene, changing contrast recorded in black and white of the different colours. The standard rule-of-thumb is a colored filter will selectively lighten its color, while darkening other colors, especially the complementary color, as the filter passes that color while attenuating others.

For example, a yellow filter or, more dramatically, an orange or red filter, will enhance the contrast between clouds and sky by darkening the blue sky while leaving the clouds bright (after exposure compensation). A deep green filter will also darken the sky, and additionally lighten green foliage, making it stand out against the sky. Light yellowish-green filters were used as standard portrait filters for panchromatic film, since they render skin-tones as light to dark grey, while darkening deep reds and blues to nearly black.
A sky-blue filter (cyan) mimics the effect of older orthochromatic film – or with a &quot;true blue&quot; filter, even older film only sensitive to blue light – rendering blue as light and red and green as dark, showing blue skies the same as overcast, with no contrast between sky and clouds, darkening blond hair, making blue eyes nearly white, and red lips nearly black.

Diffusion filters have the opposite, contrast-reducing effect; in addition they &quot;soften&quot; focus, making small blemishes invisible.

===Special effects===
====Cross ====
A cross screen filter, also known as a star filter, creates a star pattern, in which lines radiate outward from bright objects. The star pattern is generated by a very fine diffraction grating embedded in the filter, or sometimes by the use of prisms in the filter. The number of stars varies by the construction of the filter, as does the number of points each star has. The pattern of the diffraction grating can affect the shape of the resulting highlights as well.

====Diffusion====
A diffusion filter (also called a softening filter) softens subjects and generates a dreamy haze (&quot;see photon diffusion&quot;). This is most often used for portraits, providing an effect similar to that of a dedicated soft focus lens. It also has the effect of reducing contrast, and the filters are designed, labeled, sold, and used for that purpose too. There are many ways of accomplishing this effect, and thus filters from different manufacturers vary significantly. The two primary approaches are to use some form of grid or netting in the filter, or to use something which is transparent but not optically sharp.

Both effects can be achieved in software, which can in principle provide a very precise degree of control of the level of effect, however the &quot;look&quot; may be noticeably different. If there is too much contrast in a scene, the dynamic range of the digital image sensor or film may be exceeded, which post-processing cannot compensate for, so contrast reduction at the time of image capture may be called for.

====Close-up and split diopter lenses====
A close-up lens is not technically a filter but accessory lens which attaches to a lens like a filter, hence the alternative but misleading term &quot;close-up filter&quot;. They are often sold by filter manufacturers as part of their product lines, using the same holders and attachment systems. A close-up lens is a single or two-element converging lens used for close-up and macro photography, and works in the same way as spectacles used for reading. The insertion of a converging lens in front of the taking lens reduces the focal length of the combination.

Close-up lenses are usually specified by their optical power, the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. Several close-up lenses may be used in combination; the optical power of the combination is the sum of the optical powers of the component lenses; a set of lenses of +1, +2, and +4 diopters can be combined to provide a range from +1 to +7 in steps of one.

A split diopter has just a semicircular half of a close-up lens in a normal filter holder. It can be used to photograph a close object and a much more distant background, with everything in sharp focus; with any non-split lens the depth of field would be far too shallow.

====Multi-image====

A multi-image filter, sometimes called multiple image or kaleidoscopic, uses a faceted lens which generally repeats the central subject one or more times in the periphery; the images may be repeated with a radial or parallel layout.

==Physical design==
===Materials and construction===
Photo filters are commonly made from glass, resin plastics similar to those used for eyeglasses (such as CR-39), polyester and polycarbonate; sometimes acetate is used. Historically, filters were often made from gelatin, and color gels. While some filters are still described as gelatin or gel filters, they are no longer actually made from gelatin but from one of the plastics mentioned above.

Sometimes the filter is dyed in the mass, in other cases the filter is a thin sheet of material sandwiched between two pieces of clear glass or plastic.

Certain kinds of filters use other materials inside a glass sandwich; for example, polarizers often use various special films, netting filters have nylon netting, and so forth.
The rings on screw-on filters are often made of aluminum, though in more expensive filters brass is used. Aluminum filter rings are much lighter in weight, but can &quot;bind&quot; to the aluminum lens threads they are screwed in to, requiring the use of a filter wrench to get the filter off of the lens. Aluminum also dents or deforms more easily.

High quality filters are multi-coated, with multiple-layer optical coatings to reduce reflections. Uncoated filters can reflect up to 12% of the light, single-coated filter can reduce this considerably, and multi-coated filters can allow up to 99.8% of the light to pass through (0.2% unwanted reflection); the loss of light is not important, but part of the light is reflected inside the camera, producing flare and reducing the contrast of the image.

===Filter sizes and mountings===
Manufacturers of lenses and filters have standardized on several different sets of sizes over the years.

====Threaded round filters====

The most common standard filter sizes for circular filters include 30.5 mm, 35.5 mm, 37 mm, 39 mm, 40.5 mm, 43 mm, 46 mm, 49 mm, 52 mm, 55 mm, 58 mm, 62 mm, 67 mm, 72 mm, 77 mm, 82 mm, 86 mm, 95 mm, 105 mm, 112 mm 122 mm, 127 mm. The filter diameter has a steady increase from 43 to 58 mm every 3 mm and from 62 to 82 mm every 5 mm. Other filter sizes within this range may be hard to find since the filter size may be non-standard or may be rarely used on camera lenses. The specified diameter of the filter in millimeters indicates the diameter of the male threads on the filter housing. The thread pitch is 0.5 mm, 0.75 mm or 1.0 mm, depending on the ring size. A few sizes (e.g. 30.5 mm) come in more than one pitch. Most filters have a 0.75 mm pitch thread, some manufacturers use a 1.0 mm pitch thread; filters with thread pitches are incompatible with lenses with a different thread pitch.

The filter diameter for a particular lens is commonly identified on the lens face by the ⌀ symbol. For example, a lens marking may indicate: “⌀55 mm” or “55⌀” meaning it would accept a 55 mm filter or lens hood.

====Square filters====

For square filters, 2&quot; × 2&quot;, 3&quot; × 3&quot; and 4&quot; × 4&quot; were historically very common and are still made by some manufacturers. 100 mm × 100 mm is very close to 4&quot; × 4&quot;, allowing use of many of the same holders, and is one of the more popular sizes currently (2006) in use; it is virtually a standard in the motion picture industry. 75 mm x 75 mm is very close to 3&quot; × 3&quot; and while less common today, was much in vogue in the 1990s.

The French manufacturer Cokin makes a wide range of filters and holders in three sizes which is collectively known as the Cokin System. &quot;A&quot; (amateur) size is 67 mm wide, &quot;P&quot; (professional) size is 84 mm wide, and &quot;X Pro&quot; is 130 mm wide. Many other manufacturers make filters to fit Cokin holders. Cokin also makes a filter holder for 100 mm filters, which they call the &quot;Z&quot; size. Most of Cokin&#x27;s filters are made of optical resins such as CR-39. A few round filter elements may be attached to the square/rectangular filter holders, usually polarizers and gradient filters which both need to be rotated and are more expensive to manufacture.

Cokin formerly (1980s through mid-1990s) had competition from Hoya&#x27;s &#x27;Hoyarex&#x27; system (75 mm x 75 mm filters mostly made from resin) and also a range made by Ambico, but both have withdrawn from the market. A small (84 mm) &quot;system&quot; range is still made (as of 2012) by Formatt Hitech. In general, square (and sometimes rectangular) filters from one system could be used in another system&#x27;s holders if the size was correct, but each made a different system of filter holder which could not be used together. Lee, Tiffen, Formatt Hitech and Singh Ray also make square / rectangular filters in the 100 × 100 mm and Cokin &quot;P&quot; sizes.
Gel filters are very common in square form, rarely being used in circular form. These are thin flexible sheets of gelatin or plastic which must be held in rigid frames to prevent them from sagging. Gels are made not only for use as photo filters, but also in a wide range of colors for use in lighting applications, particularly for theatrical lighting. Gel holders are available from all of the square “system” makers, but are additionally provided by many camera manufacturers, by manufacturers of gel filters, and by makers of expensive professional camera accessories (particularly those manufacturers which target the movie and television camera markets.

Square filter systems often have lens shades available to attach to the filter holders.

====Rectangular filters====
Graduated filters of a given width (67 mm, 84 mm, 100 mm, etc.) are often made oblong, rather than square, in order to allow the position of the gradation to be moved up or down in the picture. This allows, for example, the red part of a sunset filter to be placed at the horizon. These are used with the &quot;system&quot; holders described above.

====Bayonet round filters====
Certain manufacturers, most notably Rollei and Hasselblad, have created their own systems of bayonet mount for filters. Each design comes in several sizes, such as Bay I through Bay VIII for Rollei, and Bay 50 through Bay 104 for Hasselblad.

====Series filters====

Starting in the 1930s, filters were also made in a sizing system known as a series mount. The filters themselves were round pieces of glass (or occasionally other materials) with no threads. Very early filters had no rims around the glass, but the more common later production filters had the glass mounted in metal rims. To mount the filters on a camera, the filter was placed between two rings; the mount ring either screwed into the lens threads or was slipped over the lens barrel and the retaining ring screws into the mounting ring to hold the filter in place. The series designations are generally written as Roman numerals, I to IX, though there are a few sizes not written that way, such as Series 4.5 and Series 5.5. Most Series filter sizes are now obsolete, production having ceased by the late 1970s. However, Series 9 became a standard of the motion picture industry and Series 9 filters are still produced and sold today, particularly for professional motion picture cinematography.

<text>Aix is a bird genus that contains two species of ducks: the wood duck (&quot;Aix sponsa&quot;), and the mandarin duck (&quot;Aix galericulata&quot;). &quot;Aix&quot; is an Ancient Greek word used by Aristotle to refer to an unknown diving bird.

==Taxonomy==
The genus belongs to the family Anatidae in the waterfowl order Anseriformes. They were formerly placed in the &quot;perching ducks&quot;, a paraphyletic group somewhat intermediate between shelducks and dabbling ducks, and it is not quite clear whether they should be placed in the Anatinae (dabbling duck) or Tadorninae (shelduck) subfamily.

==Extant species==


==Habitat==
Both species migrate from the northern parts of their respective ranges to winter in the south of the range. They inhabit quiet wooded streams and ponds.

==Description==
The two species are generally considered to be very attractive, particularly the multi-coloured drakes. The genus shows marked sexual dimorphism (differences between the sexes), with the females being smaller and less colorful.

==Diet==
Wood ducks will consume small crustaceans, insects, and plant matter. Mandarin ducks are mainly vegetarian.

==Breeding==
Wood ducks are reproductively capable around the age of one year. They are monogamous for the season. Mating occurs between February and April, depending on latitude. The clutch size is between 6 and 15, and the incubation period is about 30 days. The young are precocial. They venture from the cavity nest at one day old and are cared for by the mother for about 60 days. The young have a very high mortality rate. Wood ducks normally live 3 to 4 years.

Mandarin ducks are also monogamous. The courtship ritual, like the plumage, is rather showy. The female lays between 9 and 12 eggs in a cavity nest, then incubates them for about 30 days. Parental care by the mother is a little shorter in this species, lasting about 40 days.

==Conservation==
Both species are affected by loss of habitat. As human development continues to expand, the woodland areas preferred by these ducks continues to shrink. As of 2016, both species had been evaluated for the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and given a &quot;least concern&quot; rating.

<doc id="507744" wikidata="Q367242" url="?curid=507744" title="Elaeagnus umbellata">
<text>Elaeagnus umbellata is known as Japanese silverberry, umbellata oleaster, autumn olive, autumn elaeagnus, spreading oleaster, autumnberry, or autumn berry. The species is indigenous to eastern Asia and ranges from the Himalayas eastwards to Japan. It is a hardy, aggressive invasive species able to readily colonize barren land, becoming a troublesome plant in the central and northeastern United States and Europe.

==Description==
&quot;Elaeagnus umbellata&quot; grows as a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically up to tall, with a dense crown. It commonly bears sharp thorns in the form of spur branches. Flowers are fragrant, occur in clusters of white to yellow, are 8–9 mm in length and 7 mm in diameter, and have four lobes.

The leaves are alternate, 4–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with wavy margins. The leaves are covered with minute silvery scales when they emerge early in the spring but turn greener above as the scales wear off during the summer. The underside is more intensely covered in the silvery scales, differing from the related &quot;E. angustifolia,&quot; which remains silvery until it sheds its leaves in the fall.

=== Flowers ===
The flowers are borne in the leaf axils in clusters of 1–7. They are pale yellowish-white, fragrant, (often heavily fragrant) and have a four-lobed corolla 1 cm long. They are an important source of nectar for pollinators such as bees.

=== Fruit ===
The fruit is a small round drupe in diameter. The unripe fruit is silvery-scaled and yellow. It ripens to red, dotted with silver or brown. The ripe fruits are pulpy, juicy and sweet, 3–9 mm in length, 5 mm in diameter, and average 137 milligrams in weight, with a thin skin covering the whole fruit. Having a sweet and tart flavor, the berries can be eaten fresh or processed for jam, condiments, flavoring, or used as a substitute for tomato. When mature, the red berries contain carotenoids, including considerable amounts of lycopene.

==Naturalization==
In its origin regions of tropical and temperate Asia, &quot;E. umbellata&quot; is not considered to be an invasive species, but in many world regions, it has become invasive across wild and cultivated areas, particularly in the eastern United States. In the early 19th century, &quot;E. umbellata&quot; was purposely introduced to the U.S. and the United Kingdom for shelter belts, erosion control, wasteland reclamation, wildlife habitat, and for gardens as an ornamental. By the late 20th century, the shrub became a noxious weed and invasive species in many U.S. states from the east coast to the central prairies, and spread widely across Europe.

Due to its substantial seed production and avid germination potential, &quot;E. umbellata&quot; rapidly invades new areas where it can resprout readily after burning or cutting. Because &quot;E. umbellata&quot; stands are habitats for wildlife, such as providing forage and shelter for deer, nesting sites for birds, and berries as food for several species, it has been planted for wildlife management in parts of the U.S.

In Europe, &quot;E. umbellata&quot; has spread to the UK, Belgium, France, and Italy, but has been cultivated in the Netherlands and Scotland. In some parts of North America where it has become naturalized, &quot;E. umbellata&quot; is considered a noxious weed, particularly in the central and northeastern U.S. In Canada, it is a &quot;prohibited noxious weed&quot; under the &quot;Alberta Weed Control Act 2010&quot;.

Because it fixes atmospheric nitrogen in its roots, &quot;E. umbellata&quot; may grow vigorously and sometimes competitively in infertile soils. It can increase available nitrogen in soils and benefit some nearby plants, and when grown in orchards, it can increase yields of adjacent fruit trees up to 10%. However, its ability to change soil chemistry can severely alter or destroy native plant communities.

<doc id="507754" wikidata="Q456736" url="?curid=507754" title="Georges Vézina">
<text>Joseph Georges Gonzague Vézina (; ; , 1887 – , 1926) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender who played seven seasons in the National Hockey Association (NHA) and nine in the National Hockey League (NHL), all with the Montreal Canadiens. After being signed by the Canadiens in 1910, Vézina played in 327 consecutive regular season games and a further 39 playoff games, before leaving early during a game in 1925 due to illness. Vézina was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and died on , 1926.

The only goaltender to play for the Canadiens between 1910 and 1925, Vézina helped the team win the Stanley Cup in 1916 and 1924, while reaching the Stanley Cup Finals three more times. Nicknamed the &quot;Chicoutimi Cucumber&quot; for his calm composure while in goal, Vézina allowed the fewest goals in the league seven times in his career: four times in the NHA and three times in the NHL. In 1918, Vézina became the first NHL goaltender to both record a shutout and earn an assist on a goal. At the start of the 1926–27 NHL season, the Canadiens donated the Vezina Trophy to the NHL as an award to the goaltender who allowed the fewest goals during the season. Since 1981, the award has been given to the most outstanding goaltender as determined by a vote of NHL general managers. In Vézina&#x27;s hometown of Chicoutimi, the sports arena is named the Centre Georges-Vézina in his honour. When the Hockey Hall of Fame opened in 1945, Vézina was one of the original nine inductees, and in 2017 the NHL included him on their list of the 100 greatest players in league history.

==Personal life==
Georges, the fifth of eight children, was born on , 1887, in Chicoutimi, Quebec, to Georges-Henri Vézina, a local baker and his wife Clara Belley. Georges attended school at the Petit Séminaire de Chicoutimi from 1898 until the age of fourteen, when he left the school to help at his father&#x27;s bakery. He played hockey from a young age, participating in informal street hockey matches with others his own age. Vézina partook in these matches in his shoes, and used skates for the first time at age 16 when he joined the local team in Chicoutimi. As Chicoutimi was in a remote area of Quebec, more than 200 kilometres from Quebec City, the hockey club was not in any organised league. Rather the club, known as the Saguenéens (&quot;People from the Saguenay&quot;, the region where Chicoutimi is located), toured the province, playing exhibition games against a variety of clubs.

Vézina married Marie-Adélaïde-Stella Morin on , 1908, in Chicoutimi. After Vézina&#x27;s death, it was reported that he had fathered 22 children. This rumour was started when the Canadiens&#x27; manager, Léo Dandurand, told reporters that Vézina &quot;speaks no English and has twenty-two children, including three sets of triplets, and they were all born in the space of nine years.&quot; In actuality the Vézinas only had two children and Georges spoke broken English. In 1912 they had their first child, a son named Jean-Jules. A second son was born the night of the Montreal Canadiens&#x27; first Stanley Cup win in 1916. To honour the event, Georges named the child Marcel Stanley. When not playing hockey, Vézina operated a tannery in Chicoutimi, living a quiet life.

==Playing career==

===NHA===

On February 17, 1910, the Chicoutimi Hockey Club played an exhibition match against the Montreal Canadiens. Though playing an inferior team the Canadiens failed to score a goal, losing the game. This prompted Joseph Cattarinich, goaltender for the Canadiens, to convince his team to offer a tryout to Georges Vézina, who was Chicoutimi&#x27;s goaltender. Vézina initially refused the offer, staying in Chicoutimi until the Canadiens returned in December of that year. This time they convinced Georges, along with his brother Pierre, to come to Montreal. The two Vézina brothers arrived on , 1910. While Pierre failed to make the team, Georges impressed the Canadiens, especially with the use of his stick to block shots. Vézina was signed to a contract for C$800 per season, and made his professional debut , 1910, against the Ottawa Senators. He would play all 16 games for the Canadiens in the 1910–11 season, finishing with a record of eight wins and eight losses, while allowing the fewest goals in the league.
The following season Vézina again led the league in goals against, as well as winning eight games, along with 10 losses. Vézina recorded his first career shutout during the 1912–13 season, defeating Ottawa 6–0 on , 1913, for one of his nine wins in the season. The Canadiens finished first in the NHA for the first time in 1913–14, in a tie with the Toronto Blueshirts. Once again, Vézina led the league with the fewest goals against, while posting 13 victories and seven losses. Under the NHA rules, the first place team would play in the Stanley Cup Finals, but due to the tie for first, the Canadiens had to play a two-game, total-goals series against Toronto. Vézina shut out the Blueshirts in the first game, a 2–0 win for Montreal, but let in six goals in the second game, allowing the Blueshirts to play for the Stanley Cup, which they won.

After losing 14 games and finishing last in the NHA in 1914–15, Vézina and the Canadiens won 16 games during the 1915–16 season, placing the team first in the league. As league leaders, the Canadiens earned the right to play in the 1916 Stanley Cup Finals, where they faced off against the Portland Rosebuds, champions of the rival Pacific Coast Hockey Association. The Canadiens defeated the Rosebuds three games to two in the best-of-five-games series, winning the Stanley Cup for the first time in team history. Vézina&#x27;s second son was born the night of the fifth game, which coupled with a bonus of $238 each member of the Canadiens received for the championship, led to him considering the series as the pinnacle of his career. The following season Vézina again led the NHA with the fewest goals against, the fourth time in seven years he did so, helping the Canadiens to again reach the Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost to the Seattle Metropolitans.

===NHL===
The NHA gave way to the National Hockey League (NHL) in , with Vézina and the Canadiens joining the new league. On , 1918, he became the first goaltender in NHL history to record a shutout, by blanking the Torontos 9–0. He finished the season with 12 wins, allowing the fewest goals against. Vézina also set a record, which was shared with Clint Benedict of the Ottawa Senators, for the fewest shutouts needed to lead the league, with one.

During the 1918–19 Vézina became the first goaltender to be credited with an assist: during a December 28, 1918 game against Toronto Vézina made a save and gave the puck to Newsy Lalonde, who immediately scored. Vézina won 10 games during the season and helped the Canadiens defeat the Ottawa Senators in the NHL playoffs for the right to play for the Stanley Cup against the PCHA champion, the Seattle Metropolitans. Held in Seattle, the two teams were tied in the best-of-five series when it was cancelled due to the Spanish flu epidemic, the first time the Stanley Cup was not awarded. In the 10 playoff games prior to the cancellation, Vézina had won six games, lost three and tied one, with one shutout. Vézina recorded nearly identical records the next two seasons, with 13 wins, 11 losses and a goals against average above four in both 1919–20 and 1920–21. He won 12 games the following season, as the Canadiens again failed to qualify for the Stanley Cup.
After winning 13 games in 1922–23, Vézina led the Canadiens into the NHL playoffs, where they lost the two-game, total-goal series to the Senators, who would win the Stanley Cup. The following season saw Vézina return to leading the league in fewest goals against. His average of 1.97 goals per game was the first time a goaltender had averaged fewer than two goals against per game. With another 13-win season in 1923–24, the Canadiens reached the NHL playoffs, where they again faced the Ottawa Senators. This time the Canadiens won the series, then defeated the Vancouver Maroons of the PCHA before reaching the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in five years. Playing the Calgary Tigers of the Western Canada Hockey League, Vézina and the Canadiens won the best-of-three series two games to none, as Vézina recorded a shutout in the second game. The championship was the Canadiens&#x27; first as a member of the NHL and second title as a club. After a 17-win season in 1924–25 where Vézina recorded a goals-against average of 1.81 to again lead the league, the Canadiens reached the Stanley Cup Finals. The Canadiens only qualified after the Hamilton Tigers, the regular season champions, were suspended for refusing to play in the playoffs unless they were paid more. Facing the Victoria Cougars, the Canadiens lost the series three games to one.

Returning to Montreal for training camp for the 1925–26 season, Vézina was noticeably ill, though he said nothing about it. By the time of the Canadiens&#x27; first game on against the Pittsburgh Pirates, he had lost 35 pounds in a span of six weeks, and had a fever of . Regardless, he took to the ice, and completed the first period without allowing a goal. Vézina began vomiting blood in the intermission before returning for the start of the second period. He then collapsed in his goal area, and left the game, with former U.S. Olympic team goaltender Alphonse Lacroix taking his place. Pittsburgh won the game, 1–0.

The day after the game, Vézina was diagnosed with tuberculosis and advised to return home. He made a last trip into the Canadiens&#x27; dressing room on to say a final goodbye to his teammates. Dandurand would later describe Vézina as sitting in his corner of the dressing room with &quot;tears rolling down his cheeks. He was looking at his old pads and skates that Eddie Dufour [the Canadiens trainer] had arranged in Georges&#x27; corner. Then, he asked one little favour—the sweater he had worn in the last world series.&quot; Vézina returned to his hometown of Chicoutimi with his wife Marie, where he died in the early hours on Saturday, March 27, 1926, at l&#x27;Hôtel-Dieu hospital. Though he played only one period for the Canadiens during the entire season, the team honoured his entire $6,000 salary, a testament to how important Vézina had been to the team. The Canadiens finished in last place in 1925–26.

==Legacy==
One of the dominant goaltenders in the NHA and early NHL, Vézina led the Canadiens to five Stanley Cup Finals appearances, where they won the title twice. Seven times in his career, Vézina had the lowest goals-against average in the league he played, and he had the second-best average another five times. From when he joined the Canadiens in 1910, until being forced to retire in 1925, Vézina never missed a game nor allowed a substitute, playing in 328 consecutive regular season games and an additional 39 playoff games. For the first several years of his career goaltenders could not leave their feet to make a save, and while this rule was changed in 1918 Vézina continued to play in this conservative style throughout his career. Even so, Vézina is regarded as one of the greatest goaltenders in the early days of hockey; the &quot;Montreal Standard&quot; referred to him as the &quot;greatest goaltender of the last two decades&quot; in their obituary.

Well liked in Montreal, Vézina was often seen as the best player on the ice for the Canadiens, and was respected by his teammates, who considered him the spiritual leader of the team. Referred to as &quot;le Concombre de Chicoutimi&quot; (the &quot;Chicoutimi Cucumber&quot;) for his cool demeanour on the ice, he was also known as &quot;l&#x27;Habitant silencieux&quot; (the &quot;silent Habitant&quot;, Habitant being a nickname for the Canadiens), a reference to his reserved personality. He often sat in a corner of the team&#x27;s dressing room alone, smoking a pipe and reading the newspaper. When news of Vézina&#x27;s death was announced, newspapers across Quebec paid tribute to the goalie with articles about his life and career. Hundreds of Catholic masses were held in honour of the devout Vézina, and more than 1,500 people filled the Chicoutimi cathedral for his funeral. He was buried in le Cimetière Saint-Francois Xavier in Chicoutimi.

A lasting legacy of Vézina was the trophy named after him. At the start of the 1926–27 season, Léo Dandurand, Leo Letourneau and Joseph Cattarinich, owners of the Montreal Canadiens, donated the Vezina Trophy to the NHL in honour of Vézina. The first trophy named after an NHL player, it was to be awarded to the goaltender of the team who allowed the fewest goals during the regular season. The inaugural winner of the trophy was Vézina&#x27;s successor in goal for the Canadiens, George Hainsworth. He went on to win the trophy the next two seasons as well. In 1981, the NHL changed the format of awarding the trophy, instead giving it to the goaltender deemed best in the league based on a poll of NHL general managers. The Hockey Hall of Fame was established in 1945 and among the first nine inductees was Vézina. In 1998 Vézina was ranked number 75 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players. In honour of the first professional athlete to come from Chicoutimi, the city renamed their hockey arena the Centre Georges-Vézina in 1965. When the NHL announced its 100 greatest players in conjunction with the league&#x27;s centennial 2017, Vézina was included on the list.

<text> (), usually translated as &quot;parish&quot; or &quot;civil parish&quot;, is the third-level administrative subdivision of Portugal, as defined by the 1976 Constitution. It is also the designation for local government jurisdictions in the former Portuguese overseas territories of Cape Verde and Macau (until 2001). In the past, it was also an administrative division of the other Portuguese overseas territories. The civil parishes and communities in England and Wales and in the Spanish autonomous communities of Galicia and Asturias is similar to a in Portugal. The average land area of a Portuguese parish is about and an average population of about 3,386 people. The largest parish by area is Alcácer do Sal (Santa Maria do Castelo e Santiago) e Santa Susana, with a land area of , and the smallest parish by area is São Bartolomeu (Borba), with a land area of . The most populous parish is Algueirão - Mem Martins, with a population of 68,649 people and the least populous is Mosteiro, with a population of just nineteen people.

A is a subdivision of a &quot;município&quot; (municipality), which is a cluster of , like a US county. Most often, a parish takes the name of its seat, which is usually the most important (or the single) human agglomeration within its area, which can be a neighbourhood or city district, a group of hamlets, a village, a town or an entire city. In cases where the seat is itself divided into more than one parish, each one takes the name of a landmark within its area or of the patron saint from the usually coterminous Catholic parish ( in Portuguese). Be it a city district or village, the civil parish is often based on an ecclesiastical parish.

Since the creation of a democratic local administration, in 1976, the Portuguese parishes have been ruled by a system composed by an executive body (the &quot;junta de freguesia&quot;, &quot;parish board/council&quot;) and a deliberative body (the &quot;assembleia de freguesia&quot;, &quot;parish assembly&quot;). The members of the &quot;assembleia de freguesia&quot; are publicly elected every four years. The presidents of the parish boards are also members of the municipal assembly.

==History==
The parish, in contrast with the municipalities, had their base in the ecclesiastical divisions that &quot;had its origin in the fact that neighbours professed the same religion and professed their faith and divinity in the same temple&quot;. , the traditional Portuguese word for parish, had its beginning in the &quot;filius ecclesiae&quot; (child of the church) and &quot;filius gregis&quot; (child of the shepherds&#x27;s flock), the collectivity of the religious faithful, with similar aspirations and interests. Between 1216 and 1223, Afonso II of Portugal began a process of legitimizing the Portuguese territory by conferring charters to nobles, clergy and municipal chambers (which would not be completed until after 1249, under Afonso III of Portugal), making the parish the smallest division. But, the power of the clergy built these areas, accumulating immense wealth and power. The liberal government of Mouzinho da Silveira abolished the parishes in 1832, but the government of Manuel da Silva Passos restored them in 1836. The began to refer to the civil/administrative entity, while the &quot;paróquia&quot; () became affiliated with the religious entity.

== Present situation ==
=== Portugal ===

Before the 2013 local government reforms, the 308 municipalities were subdivided into 4,259 civil parishes. In 2011, after more than two weeks of bailout negotiations in light of the sovereign debt crisis with the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission, the Portuguese government was obliged to reduce the number of municipal and parish local governments after July 2012. The government of Pedro Passos Coelho introduced a plan to reform the administrative divisions, claiming it would create efficiencies and save money. The plan envisioned the reform of the management, territorial geography and political form of how Portugal functioned at the local level, including specifically at the and &quot;concelho&quot; levels. It was determined that these changes would then be formalized before the 2013 local government elections, as part of a process to reduce expenditures, a condition of the $110 billion accord. In addition to the reduction of the number of representatives in the local boards, the plan also established criteria for the reduction, amalgamation or extinction of various civil parishes.

The reform was implemented according to Law 11-A/2013 of 28 January 2013, which defined the reorganization of the civil parishes. This way, the number of parishes was reduced from 4,259 to 3,091.

Municipalities in Portugal are usually divided into multiple &quot;freguesias&quot;, but seven municipalities are not: Alpiarça, Barrancos, Castanheira de Pera, Porto Santo, São Brás de Alportel and São João da Madeira all consist of a single civil parish, and Corvo is a special case of a municipality without civil parishes, where all usual parish duties and functions are performed by the municipality directly. Barcelos is the municipality with the most civil parishes (61, since 2013).

Portugal has no unincorporated areas; all the national territory (apart from the above-mentioned example of Corvo) belongs to a civil parish, including uninhabited islands: Selvagens Islands to Sé, and Berlengas to Peniche, Desertas Islands to Santa Cruz, and Formigas Islets to Vila do Porto, in the municipalities with the same name (except for Sé, which belongs to Funchal).

=== Cape Verde ===
Of Cape Verde&#x27;s 22 municipalities, which form the highest level of sub-national government in the small African state, some but not all are subdivided into parishes. There are 32 parishes in the country.

=== Macau ===
Macau is an autonomous special administrative region in Southern China that was historically a part of the Portuguese Empire until its handover to China in 1999. During the period of Portuguese rule it was divided into two municipalities which were subdivided into a total of seven parishes. In 2001 the municipalities were dissolved and their administrative functions transferred to the Municipal Affairs Bureau. The parishes were legally retained but no longer serve an administrative function.

<text>Concelho () is the Portuguese-language term for municipality, referring to the territorial subdivision in local government. In comparison, the word município () refers to the organs of State. This differentiation is still in use in Portugal and some of its former overseas provinces, but is no longer in use in Brazil following the abolition of these organs, in favour of the French prefecture system. It is similar to borough and council.

==History==
After the civil parish (), the Portuguese &quot;concelho&quot; is the most stable territorial subdivision within the country, with over 900 years of history. Founded in the royal charters attributed to parcels and territorial enclaves, in order to establish a presence by the Crown, rather than personal fiefdoms of the nobility and aristocracy. This municipal institution changed throughout history: many were abolished and reconstituted based on the political necessity; first they were subject to the specifics of each charter (which varied based on conditions and circumstances), and then based on national laws established during the Liberal era.

Today, the municipalities are governed by the &quot;municípios&quot;, constituted by the &quot;Câmara Municipal&quot; (&quot;Municipal Chamber&quot;), its executive organ and by the &quot;Assembleia Municipal&quot; (&quot;Municipal Assembly&quot;), its deliberative body. The &quot;Câmara&quot; is the executive body that is charged with governing the territory and policies of the region. Owing to population, the municipal chamber can comprise a number of alderman (normally between 5 and 17) elected by lists, using direct, universal suffragan vote, based with or without political parties. The municipal assembly, sometimes &quot;parliament&quot;, is responsible principally for auditing the activities of the executive branch. Its members are elected by population and proportionally by civil parishes, using the same schema as the executive (by universal direct suffrage with or without political parties), but also represented by the presidents of the &quot;juntas de freguesia&quot; (&quot;civil parish council presidents&quot;).

Though a unitary state, the Portuguese model governance has undergone periods of centralized and decentralized tendencies:

:&quot;One of the interesting and innovative aspects of the 1976 Constitution, occurs in the consideration of decentralized democracy, particularly in the ambient of territorial decentralization...The Portuguese State continues to be unitary (Article 6, Paragraph 1), with the ability to be also decentralized...or basically, capable of distribute functions and powers to community authorities, other entities and centres of existing interest.&quot;

<text>Elaeagnus angustifolia, commonly called Russian olive, silver berry, oleaster, or wild olive, is a species of &quot;Elaeagnus&quot;, native to Asia and limited areas of eastern Europe. It is widely established in North America as an introduced species.

== Description ==
&quot;Elaeagnus angustifolia&quot; is a thorny tree growing to in height. Its stems, buds, and leaves have a dense covering of silvery to rusty scales. The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, long and broad, with a smooth margin. The plants begin to flower and fruit from 3 years old. The highly aromatic flowers, produced in clusters of one to three, are 1 cm long with a four-lobed creamy yellow calyx; they appear in early summer and are followed by clusters of fruit, a small cherry-like drupe long, orange-red covered in silvery scales. The fruits are about 1 cm wide and sweet, though with a dryish, mealy texture.

The species is established and reproduced primarily by seed, with some vegetative propagation also occurring. The branches have thorns that can be long.

==Taxonomy and distribution==
The first scientific description of &quot;Elaeagnus angustifolia&quot; was by Carl Linnaeus under its present name in 1753. Its common name comes from its similarity in appearance to the olive (&quot;Olea europaea&quot;), in a different botanical family, the Oleaceae.

According to Sudnik et al. (2009), &quot;Most authors suggest that Elaeagnus angustifolia originated from the Irano-Turanian region.The species is widely distributed in south-west Asia. In the East its range extends from Kashmir and north-west India to eastern Kazakhstan. The western limit of the species distribution is unclear; the natural character of the tree stands in the lower Volga region(Golub et al. 2002) and Anatolia (Brow ic z1996) is questioned.&quot;

Further east in Asia, the native range stretches into Afghanistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and the nations of the Caucasus. In India they are found in the western Himalayas. There is a disjunct population in Myanmar and Assam in eastern India. They grow natively in Mongolia and in China they are found in the north-central, southeast, Inner Mongolia, Manchuria, Qinghai, and Xinjiang.

== Ecology ==
The shrub possesses a high level of salinity tolerance enabling it to grow on bare mineral substrates and poor, eroded soils and environments.

The caterpillars of the high altitude alpine moth &quot;Lachana alpherakii&quot; use it as a host plant. The fruit is readily eaten and the seeds disseminated by many species of birds.

=== Invasive behavior ===
The species was introduced into North America by the late 19th century, and was both planted and spread through the consumption of its fruits (which seldom ripen in England), by birds, which disperse the seeds. Russian olive is considered to be an invasive species in many places in the United States because it thrives on poor soil, has high seedling survival rates, matures in a few years, and out-competes the native vegetation. It often invades riparian habitats where the canopy of cottonwood trees has died. Its quick-spreading root system can make it pest-like.

== Uses ==
It is widely grown across southern and central Europe as a drought and cold-resistant ornamental plant for its scented flowers, edible fruit, attractive yellow foliage and black bark. It was grown in England by John Parkinson no later than 1633.

In Iran, the dried powder of the fruit is used mixed with milk for rheumatoid arthritis and joint pains. There is evidence supporting beneficial effects of aqueous extract of Persian olive in reducing the symptoms of osteoarthritis with an efficacy comparable to that of acetaminophen and ibuprofen.

It is one of the seven items used in Haft-sin, a traditional table setting of Nowruz, the traditional Persian spring celebration. The dried fruit, known locally as &quot;senjed&quot;, is one of seven served in its own syrup in a fruit salad called &quot;haft mēwa&quot; eaten during Nowruz in Afghanistan.

In folk herbalism Russian olive has a wide variety of uses. The leaves, fruit, flowers, and bark are all employed. The leaves are known to help in the gastrointestinal system, assist in wound healing and are used as an antibacterial. The fruit has a wide range of traditional applications, including use as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. The flowers are a traditional remedy for fevers, made as an herbal infusion. 

In urban settings, landscapers use plantings of Russian olive to discourage the homeless from resting or sleeping in the location.

== Chemistry ==
&quot;E. angustifolia&quot; contains the alkaloids harmine, harmane, and harmol in the roots and shoot, as well as calligonine in the bark.

<doc id="507776" wikidata="Q49737" url="?curid=507776" title="Cotton candy">
<text>Cotton candy, also known as candy floss (candyfloss) and fairy floss, is a spun sugar confection that resembles cotton. It is made by heating and liquefying sugar, and spinning it centrifugally through minute holes, causing it to rapidly cool and re-solidify into fine strands. It usually contains small amounts of flavoring or food coloring.

It is often sold at fairs, circuses, carnivals, and festivals, served in a plastic bag, on a stick, or on a paper cone.

It is made and sold globally, as &quot;candy floss&quot; in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and South Africa, as &quot;fairy floss&quot; in Australia, as &quot;barbe à papa&quot; &quot;daddy&#x27;s beard&quot; in France, as شعر البنات &quot;girl&#x27;s hair&quot; in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, as غزل البنات &quot;girl’s yarn&quot; in Egypt. Similar confections include Korean and Iranian .

== History ==
Several sources track the origin of cotton candy to a form of spun sugar found in Europe in the 19th century. At that time, spun sugar was an expensive, labor-intensive endeavor and was not generally available to the average person. Others suggest versions of spun sugar originated in Italy as early as the 15th century.

Machine-spun cotton candy was invented in 1897 by dentist William Morrison and confectioner John C. Wharton, and first introduced to a wide audience at the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair as Fairy Floss with great success, selling 68,655 boxes at 25¢ ($ today) per box. On September 6, 1905, Albert D. Robinson of Lynn, Massachusetts submitted his patent for an electric candy-spinning machine, a combination of an electronic starter and motor-driven rotatable bowl that maintained heating efficiently. By May 1907, he transferred the rights to the General Electric Company of New York. His patent remains today as the basic cotton candy machine.

In 1915, food writer Julia Davis Chandler described &quot;Candy Cotton&quot; being sold at the Panama%E2%80%93Pacific International Exposition.

Joseph Lascaux, a dentist from New Orleans, Louisiana, invented a similar cotton candy machine in 1921. His patent named the sweet confection &quot;cotton candy&quot;, eventually overtaking the name &quot;fairy floss&quot;, although it retains this name in Australia. In the 1970s, an automatic cotton candy machine was created which made the product and packaged it, making it easier to produce at carnivals, stalls and other events requiring more portable production.

Tootsie Roll Industries, the world&#x27;s largest cotton candy manufacturer, produces a bagged, fruit-flavored version called Fluffy Stuff.

In the United States, National Cotton Candy Day is celebrated on December 7.

== Production ==


Typical machines used to make cotton candy include a spinning head enclosing a small &quot;sugar reserve&quot; bowl into which a charge of granulated, colored sugar (or separate sugar and food coloring) is poured. Heaters near the rim of the head melt the sugar, which is squeezed out through tiny holes by centrifugal force. Colored sugar packaged specially for the process is milled with melting characteristics and a crystal size optimized for the head and heated holes; granulated sugar used in baking contains fine crystals which spin out unmelted, while rock sugar crystals are too large to properly contact the heater, slowing the production of cotton candy.

The molten sugar solidifies in the air and is caught in a larger bowl which totally surrounds the spinning head. Left to operate for a period, the cotton-like product builds up on the inside walls of the larger bowl, at which point machine operators twirl a stick or cone around the rim of the large catching bowl, gathering the sugar strands into portions which are served on stick or cone, or in plastic bags. As the sugar reserve bowl empties, the operator recharges it with more feedstock. The product is sensitive to humidity, and in humid summer locales, the process can be messy and sticky.

== Flavoring ==

The source material for candy mesh is usually both colored and flavored. When spun, cotton candy is white because it is made from sugar, but adding dye or coloring transforms the color. Originally, cotton candy was just white. In the US, cotton candy is available in a wide variety of flavors, but two flavor-blend colors predominate—blue raspberry and pink vanilla, both originally formulated by the Gold Medal brand (which uses the names &quot;Boo Blue&quot; and &quot;Silly Nilly&quot;). Cotton candy may come out purple when mixed. Cotton candy machines were notoriously unreliable until Gold Medal&#x27;s invention of a sprung base in 1949—since then, they have manufactured nearly all commercial cotton candy machines and much of the cotton candy in the US.

Typically, once spun, cotton candy is only marketed by color. Absent a clear name other than &quot;blue&quot;, the distinctive taste of the blue raspberry flavor mix has gone on to become a compound flavor that some other foods (gum, ice cream, rock candy, fluoride toothpaste) occasionally borrow (&quot;cotton-candy flavored ice cream&quot;) to invoke the nostalgia of cotton candy. The sale of blue cotton candy at fairgrounds in the 1950s is one of the first documented instances of blue-raspberry flavoring in America. Pink bubble gum went through a similar transition from specific branded product to a generic flavor that transcended the original confection, and &quot;bubble gum flavor&quot; often shows up in the same product categories as &quot;cotton candy flavor&quot;.

== Machines ==
In 1978, the first automated machine was used for the production of cotton candy. Since then, many variants have appeared, ranging in size from counter-top to party- and carnival-size. Modern machines for commercial use can hold up to of sugar, have storage for extra flavors, and have bowls that spin at 3,450 revolutions per minute.

== Bans ==

In February 2024, the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and the union territory of Puducherry implemented a ban after lab tests confirmed the presence of a cancer-causing substance, rhodamine-B, in samples sent for testing. Andhra Pradesh reportedly started testing samples of the candy while food safety officials in Delhi were pushing for a ban.

Studies have shown that the chemical can increase the risk of cancer and Europe and California have made its use as a food dye illegal.

<text>The Nyongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center (녕변원자력연구소) is North Korea&#x27;s major nuclear facility, operating its first nuclear reactors. It is located in Nyongbyon County in North Pyongan Province, about 100 km north of Pyongyang. The center produced the fissile material for North Korea&#x27;s six nuclear weapon tests from 2006 to 2017, and since 2009 is developing indigenous light water reactor nuclear power station technology.

==Facilities==
The major installations include all aspects of a Magnox nuclear reactor fuel cycle, based on the use of natural uranium fuel:
* a fuel fabrication plant,
* a 5 MWe experimental reactor producing power and district heating,
* a short-term spent fuel storage facility,
* a fuel reprocessing facility that recovers uranium and plutonium from spent fuel using the PUREX process.

Magnox spent fuel is not designed for long-term storage as both the casing and uranium metal core react with water; it is designed to be reprocessed within a few years of removal from a reactor. As a carbon dioxide cooled, graphite moderated Magnox reactor does not require difficult-to-produce enriched uranium fuel or a heavy water moderator it is an attractive choice for a wholly indigenous nuclear reactor development.

The Magnox facilities were disabled in 2007 in accord with the six-party talks agreement, but following the breakdown of that agreement were partially re-enabled in 2009 to reprocess existing stocks of spent fuel. On 15 September 2015, North Korea announced that the reactor had resumed operation.

The center also has an IRT-2000 pool-type research reactor, supplied by the Soviet Union in 1963, operational since 1965. The reactor fuel is IRT-2M type assemblies of 10%, 36% and 80% enriched uranium. As the center has not received fresh fuel since Soviet times, this reactor is now (February 2007) only run occasionally for experiments or to produce isotopes, particularly iodine-131 for thyroid cancer radiation therapy.

In 2009, the building of a small indigenous experimental light water reactor started. In 2010, a uranium enrichment plant began operating.

The Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center site occupies . It has two sections, the nuclear research section and a larger residential district (sometimes named Bungang or Pun’gangni), separated and surrounded by fencing.

==History==

Construction of the 5 MWe experimental reactor began in 1980, and the reactor first went critical in 1986. This reactor was an initial small technology proving reactor for a following development program of larger Magnox reactors. The spent nuclear fuel reprocessing facility appeared to still be under construction in 1992. The 5 MWe experimental reactor operated intermittently until 1994 when it was shut down in accordance with the U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework. Following the breakdown of the Agreed Framework in 2002, operation restarted in February 2003, creating plutonium within its fuel load at a rate of about 6 kg per year. The reactor fuel was replaced between April and June 2005. The spent nuclear fuel has been reprocessed with an estimated yield of about 24 to 42 kg of plutonium metal, some of which was used for the nuclear weapons involved in the 2006 and 2009 North Korean nuclear tests.

Nyongbyon is also the site of a 50 MWe Magnox prototype power reactor, but construction was halted in 1994 about a year from completion in accord with the Agreed Framework, and by 2004 the structures and pipework had deteriorated badly. This construction was being dismantled in 2010.

Another 200 MWe Magnox full-scale power reactor was being constructed at Taechon, 20 km north-west of Nyongbyon, () until construction was also halted in 1994 in accord with the Agreed Framework. By 2005 reconstruction of this reactor was uneconomic.

The reactor designs were based on declassified information about the British Magnox design at Calder Hall and elsewhere, and the spent fuel reprocessing plant on the multi-national &quot;European Company for the Chemical Processing of Irradiated Fuels&quot; (EUROCHEMIC) plant at Mol-Dessel in Belgium.

===2007 shutdown===

On 13 February 2007, an agreement was reached at the Six party talks that North Korea will shut down and seal the Magnox nuclear reactor and associated facilities and invite back International Atomic Energy Agency personnel to conduct all necessary monitoring and verifications.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAEA-GOV/2007/45-GC(51)/19&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In return for this North Korea will receive emergency energy assistance from the other five parties in the form of 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil.

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors arrived at the site on 28 June to discuss verification and monitoring arrangements for the shutdown. This had been delayed from April due to a dispute with the United States over Banco Delta Asia. On 3 June an anonymous South Korean government official indicated that the shutdown may start following the first oil shipment later in the month. On 14 July, Sean McCormack stated that North Korea had told the US that the reactor had been shut down. He added that the US welcomed the news, and was awaiting verification from the IAEA team. The next day, IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei announced the UN&#x27;s confirmation that the reactor had been shut down. On 18 July 2007, the IAEA confirmed that all five nuclear facilities at Nyongbyon had been shut down.

In his Introductory Statement to the IAEA Board of Governors on 2008-03-03, the Director General stated that he could not provide an update on the disabling of the facilities, as it was not undertaken by the IAEA. All fuel rods from the 5 MWe Experimental Nuclear Power Plant and nuclear material generated by the disabling of the Nuclear Fuel Fabrication Plant were under IAEA containment and surveillance.

===2008 cooling tower demolition===

On 27 June 2008 North Korea destroyed the most visible symbol of its nuclear weapons program – the cooling tower at its main atomic reactor in the complex. The implosion was witnessed by a number of international journalists and diplomats.

The demolition of the -tall cooling tower, which carried off waste heat to the atmosphere, is a response to U.S. concessions after the North delivered a declaration of its nuclear programs to be dismantled. The United States paid the US$2.5 million demolition fee.

===Possible reactivation===

During 2008 tensions resurfaced between North Korea and the U.S. due to disagreements over the six-party talks disarmament process. On 8 October 2008, IAEA inspectors were forbidden by the North Korean government to conduct further inspections of the site. However two days later the U.S. removed North Korea from the U.S. State Sponsors of Terrorism list and the Nyongbyon deactivation process resumed.

===2009 resumption of reprocessing===

According to the state-run North Korean news agency KCNA website, the DPRK resumed the reprocessing of spent fuel to recover plutonium on 25 April 2009 in response to the UN&#x27;s condemnation of its recent rocket launch. This material supplemented that used for nuclear weapons testing.

===Light water reactor development===

In 2009, North Korea announced its intention to build an indigenous experimental light water reactor (LWR) and the uranium enrichment technology to provide its nuclear fuel. In 2010, a 2,000 gas centrifuge uranium enrichment plant to produce low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel began operating, and construction started on the experimental 25 to 30 MWe LWR, with a target operation date for the reactor of 2012.

In November 2011, satellite imagery indicated that the LWR construction was progressing rapidly, with the concrete structures largely completed. The LWR is being built on the site of the demolished cooling tower of the experimental Magnox reactor. Following the building of this experimental LWR, North Korea intends to build larger LWRs for electricity generation. Initial estimates were that the reactor would be put into operation in 2013, but the reactor was not externally complete until 2016.

In 2017, several activities were noted involving construction, a dam was built to provide sufficient amount of water for cooling system, a switchyard and connections to transmission line were made along with facilities presumably used for maintenance and repair. Activity that suggests components were being transferred to the building were noted too. In 2018, it was believed that the preliminary testing of the reactor had started and that the reactor would begin to operate 2018 or 2019. The reactor is linked to power grid with an expected output is 25 to 30 megawatts, which is enough to supply electricity for about 50,000 inhabitants.

As of May 2024, intermittent cooling water flows indicate pre-operational tests are probably being conducted.

===Suspension of uranium enrichment===

In February 2012, North Korea announced that it would suspend uranium enrichment at Nyongbyon, and not conduct any further tests of nuclear weapons while productive negotiations involving the United States continue. Additionally, North Korea would allow IAEA inspectors to monitor operations at Nyongbyon. The U.S. reaffirmed that it does not have hostile intent toward the DPRK, and is prepared to improve bilateral relationships. Nuclear enrichment was presumably resumed following the collapse of the Leap Day Deal.

===2013 planned restart of operation===

In March 2013, North Korea announced that they would be restarting operation of the 5 MWe experimental reactor. In order to do so, the disabled secondary cooling system will have to be restored.

On 15 September 2015, North Korea announced that the Yongbyon nuclear site is in full operation, including the 5 MWe experimental reactor. However, satellite imagery in April 2016 suggested it was not operating at a high power level.

Infra-red imagery analysis covering from September 2016 to June 2017 showed that the 5 MWe experimental reactor had either not been operated, or operated at a low-level. The Radiochemical Laboratory had operated intermittently.

===2018 Pyongyang Agreement===
During the September 2018 inter-Korean summit, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-In signed the &quot;Pyongyang Joint Declaration of September 2018&quot; The agreement states, among other things, that the North Korean government will only dismantle Nyongbyon if the US would engage in correlative action.

As of January 2019, Nyongbyon&#x27;s main facilities did not appear to be operating. However, in August 2021, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that North Korea appeared to have restarted the 5 MW reactor.

<text>The &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Published by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, the data are compiled by Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single&#x27;s weekly physical sales and airplays. The year started out with &quot;One Sweet Day&quot; by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men and ended with &quot;Un-Break My Heart&quot; by Toni Braxton. There were nine singles that peaked atop the charts, but if &quot;One Sweet Day&quot; is excluded from the count (as the song had its peak in the previous year), the total would be eight, the second lowest for a single year, along with 2005 and 2015. The longest running number-one single of 1996 is &quot;Macarena&quot; (Bayside Boys Mix), which stayed at the top for 14 weeks.

That year, 8 acts earned their first number one song, such as Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, 2Pac, K-Ci &amp; JoJo, Dr. Dre, Roger Troutman, Toni Braxton, Los del Río, and Blackstreet. Mariah Carey, Dr. Dre and Toni Braxton were the only acts to hit number one more than once, with each of them hitting number one twice.

<text>Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) is one of the most important regulatory enzymes () of glycolysis. It is an allosteric enzyme made of 4 subunits and controlled by many activators and inhibitors. PFK-1 catalyzes the important &quot;committed&quot; step of glycolysis, the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate and ATP to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and ADP. Glycolysis is the foundation for respiration, both anaerobic and aerobic. Because phosphofructokinase (PFK) catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation to convert fructose-6-phosphate into fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and ADP, it is one of the key regulatory steps of glycolysis. PFK is able to regulate glycolysis through allosteric inhibition, and in this way, the cell can increase or decrease the rate of glycolysis in response to the cell&#x27;s energy requirements. For example, a high ratio of ATP to ADP will inhibit PFK and glycolysis. The key difference between the regulation of PFK in eukaryotes and prokaryotes is that in eukaryotes PFK is activated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. The purpose of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is to supersede ATP inhibition, thus allowing eukaryotes to have greater sensitivity to regulation by hormones like glucagon and insulin.
== Structure ==
Mammalian PFK1 is a 340kd tetramer composed of different combinations of three types of subunits: muscle (M), liver (L), and platelet (P). The composition of the PFK1 tetramer differs according to the tissue type it is present in. For example, mature muscle expresses only the M isozyme, therefore, the muscle PFK1 is composed solely of homotetramers of M4. The liver and kidneys express predominantly the L isoform. In erythrocytes, both M and L subunits randomly tetramerize to form M4, L4 and the three hybrid forms of the enzyme (ML3, M2L2, M3L). As a result, the kinetic and regulatory properties of the various isoenzymes pools are dependent on subunit composition. Tissue-specific changes in PFK activity and isoenzymic content contribute significantly to the diversities of glycolytic and gluconeogenic rates which have been observed for different tissues.

PFK1 is an allosteric enzyme and has a structure similar to that of hemoglobin in so far as it is a dimer of a dimer. One half of each dimer contains the ATP binding site whereas the other half the substrate (fructose-6-phosphate or (F6P)) binding site as well as a separate allosteric binding site.

Each subunit of the tetramer is 319 amino acids and consists of two domains: one that binds the substrate ATP, and the other that binds fructose-6-phosphate. Each domain is a beta barrel, and has a cylindrical beta sheet surrounded by alpha helices.

On the opposite side of the each subunit from each active site is the allosteric site, at the interface between subunits in the dimer. ATP and AMP compete for this site. The N-terminal domain has a catalytic role binding the ATP, and the C-terminal has a regulatory role 

== Mechanism ==
PFK1 is an allosteric enzyme whose activity can be described using the symmetry model of allosterism whereby there is a concerted transition from an enzymatically inactive T-state to the active R-state. F6P binds with a high affinity to the R state but not the T state enzyme. For every molecule of F6P that binds to PFK1, the enzyme progressively shifts from T state to the R state. Thus a graph plotting PFK1 activity against increasing F6P concentrations would adopt the sigmoidal curve shape traditionally associated with allosteric enzymes.

PFK1 belongs to the family of phosphotransferases and it catalyzes the transfer of γ-phosphate from ATP to fructose-6-phosphate. The PFK1 active site comprises both the ATP-Mg2+ and the F6P binding sites. Some proposed residues involved with substrate binding in &quot;E. coli&quot; PFK1 include Asp127 and Arg171. In B. stearothermophilus PFK1, the positively charged side chain of Arg162 residue forms a hydrogen-bonded salt bridge with the negatively charged phosphate group of F6P, an interaction which stabilizes the R state relative to the T state and is partly responsible for the homotropic effect of F6P binding. In the T state, enzyme conformation shifts slightly such that the space previously taken up by the Arg162 is replaced with Glu161. This swap in positions between adjacent amino acid residues inhibits the ability of F6P to bind the enzyme.

Allosteric activators such as AMP and ADP bind to the allosteric site as to facilitate the formation of the R state by inducing structural changes in the enzyme. Similarly, inhibitors such as ATP and PEP bind to the same allosteric site and facilitate the formation of the T state, thereby inhibiting enzyme activity.

The hydroxyl oxygen of carbon 1 does a nucleophilic attack on the beta phosphate of ATP. These electrons are pushed to the anhydride oxygen between the beta and gamma phosphates of ATP.

== Regulation ==
PFK1 is the most important control site in the mammalian glycolytic pathway. This step is subject to extensive regulation since it is not only highly exergonic under physiological conditions, but also because it is a committed step – the first irreversible reaction unique to the glycolytic pathway. This leads to a precise control of glucose and the other monosaccharides galactose and fructose going down the glycolytic pathway. Before this enzyme&#x27;s reaction, glucose-6-phosphate can potentially travel down the pentose phosphate pathway, or be converted to glucose-1-phosphate for glycogenesis.

PFK1 is allosterically inhibited by high levels of ATP but AMP reverses the inhibitory action of ATP. Therefore, the activity of the enzyme increases when the cellular ATP/AMP ratio is lowered. Glycolysis is thus stimulated when energy charge falls. PFK1 has two sites with different affinities for ATP which is both a substrate and an inhibitor.

PFK1 is also inhibited by low pH levels which augment the inhibitory effect of ATP. The pH falls when muscle is functioning anaerobically and producing excessive quantities of lactic acid (although lactic acid is not itself the cause of the decrease in pH). This inhibitory effect serves to protect the muscle from damage that would result from the accumulation of too much acid.

Finally, PFK1 is allosterically inhibited by PEP, citrate, and ATP. Phosphoenolpyruvic acid is a product further downstream the glycolytic pathway. Although citrate does build up when the Krebs Cycle enzymes approach their maximum velocity, it is questionable whether citrate accumulates to a sufficient concentration to inhibit PFK-1 under normal physiological conditions. ATP concentration build up indicates an excess of energy and does have an allosteric modulation site on PFK1 where it decreases the affinity of PFK1 for its substrate.

PFK1 is allosterically activated by a high concentration of AMP, but the most potent activator is fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, which is also produced from fructose-6-phosphate by PFK2. Hence, an abundance of F6P results in a higher concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP). The binding of F-2,6-BP increases the affinity of PFK1 for F6P and diminishes the inhibitory effect of ATP. This is an example of feedforward stimulation as glycolysis is accelerated when glucose is abundant.

PFK activity is reduced through repression of synthesis by glucagon. Glucagon activates protein kinase A which, in turn, shuts off the kinase activity of PFK2. This reverses any synthesis of F-2,6-BP from F6P and thus de-activates PFK1.

The precise regulation of PFK1 prevents glycolysis and gluconeogenesis from occurring simultaneously. However, there is substrate cycling between F6P and F-1,6-BP. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of F-1,6-BP back to F6P, the reverse reaction catalyzed by PFK1. There is a small amount of FBPase activity during glycolysis and some PFK1 activity during gluconeogenesis. This cycle allows for the amplification of metabolic signals as well as the generation of heat by ATP hydrolysis.

Serotonin (5-HT) increases PFK by binding to the 5-HT(2A) receptor, causing the tyrosine residue of PFK to be phosphorylated via phospholipase C. This in turn redistributes PFK within the skeletal muscle cells. Because PFK regulates glycolytic flux, serotonin plays a regulatory role in glycolysis 

==Genes==
There are three phosphofructokinase genes in humans:
* PFKL – liver
* PFKM – muscle
* PFKP – platelet

==Clinical significance ==
A genetic mutation in the PFKM gene results in Tarui&#x27;s disease, which is a glycogen storage disease where the ability of certain cell types to utilize carbohydrates as a source of energy is impaired.

Tarui disease is a glycogen storage disease with symptoms including muscle weakness (myopathy) and exercise induced cramping and spasms, myoglobinuria (presence of myoglobin in urine, indicating muscle destruction) and compensated hemolysis. ATP is a natural allosteric inhibitor of PFK, in order to prevent unnecessary production of ATP through glycolysis. However, a mutation in Asp(543)Ala can result in ATP having a stronger inhibitory effect (due to increased binding to PFK&#x27;s inhibitory allosteric binding site).

Phosphofructokinase mutation and cancer: In order for cancer cells to meet their energy requirements due to their rapid cell growth and division, they survive more effectively when they have a hyperactive phosphofructokinase 1 enzyme. When cancer cells grow and divide quickly, they initially do not have as much blood supply, and can thus have hypoxia (oxygen deprivation), and this triggers O-GlcNAcylation at serine 529 of PFK. This modification inhibits PFK1 activity and supports cancer proliferation, in contrast with the view that high PFK1 activity is necessary for cancer. This may be due to redirecting glucose flux towards the pentose phosphate pathway to generate NADPH to detoxify reactive oxygen species.

Herpes simplex type 1 and phosphofructokinase: Some viruses, including HIV, HCMV and Mayaro affect cellular metabolic pathways such as glycolysis by a MOI-dependent increase in the activity of PFK. The mechanism that Herpes increases PFK activity is by phosphorylating the enzyme at the serine residues. The HSV-1 induced glycolysis increases ATP content, which is critical for the virus&#x27;s replication.

<doc id="507788" wikidata="Q837410" url="?curid=507788" title="Pinus rigida">
<text>Pinus rigida, the pitch pine, is a small-to-medium-sized pine. It is native to eastern North America, primarily from central Maine south to Georgia and as far west as Kentucky. It is found in environments which other species would find unsuitable for growth, such as acidic, sandy, and low-nutrient soils.

==Description==
The pitch pine is irregular in shape, but grows to ). Branches are usually twisted, and it does a poor job at self-pruning. The needles are in fascicles (bundles) of three, about in length, and are stout (over broad) and often slightly twisted. The cones are long and oval, with prickles on the scales. Trunks are usually straight with a slight curve, covered in large, thick, irregular plates of bark. Pitch pine has an exceptionally high regenerative ability; if the main trunk is cut or damaged by fire, it can re-sprout using epicormic shoots. This is one of its many adaptations to fire, which also include a thick bark to protect the sensitive cambium layer from heat. Burnt pitch pines often form stunted, twisted trees with multiple trunks as a result of the resprouting. This characteristic makes it a popular species for bonsai.

Pitch pine is rapid-growing when young, gaining around one foot of height per year under optimal conditions, until growth slows at 50–60 years. By 90 years of age, the amount of annual height gain is minimal. Open-growth trees begin bearing cones in as little as three years, with shade-inhabiting pines taking a few years longer. Cones take two years to mature. Seed dispersal occurs over the fall and winter, and trees cannot self-pollinate. The lifespan of a pitch pine is about 200 years or longer.
== Taxonomy ==
It was given its scientific name, &quot;Pinus rigida&quot;, by British botanist Philip Miller. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and the subgenus &quot;Pinus&quot; (formerly &quot;Diploxylon&quot;), along with other hard pines.

==Distribution and habitat==
Pitch pine is found mainly in the southern areas of the northeastern United States, from coastal Maine and Ohio to Kentucky and northern Georgia. A few stands occur in southern Quebec and Ontario, mostly in two pockets along the St. Lawrence River. It is known as a pioneer species and is often the first tree to vegetate a site after it has been cleared away. It is a climax vegetation type in extreme conditions, but in most cases it is replaced by oaks and other hardwoods. This pine occupies a variety of habitats, from dry, acidic sandy uplands to swampy lowlands, and can survive in very poor conditions. It is the primary tree of the Atlantic coastal pine barrens ecoregion.

== Ecology ==
Pitch pines provide habitat and food for many wildlife species. They are used for cover and nesting by birds such as the pine warbler, wild turkey, red-cockaded woodpecker, great-crested flycatcher, blue jay, black-capped chickadee, black-and-white warbler, Nashville warbler, and chestnut-sided warbler. Deer consume seedlings and new sprouts, and small mammals and birds eat the seeds.

This species occasionally hybridizes with other pine species, such as loblolly pine (&quot;Pinus taeda&quot;), shortleaf pine (&quot;Pinus echinata&quot;), and pond pine (&quot;Pinus serotina&quot;); the last is treated as a subspecies of pitch pine by some botanists.

==Uses==
Because it frequently grows multiple or crooked trunks, pitch pine is not a major timber tree, nor is it as fast-growing as other eastern American pines. However, it grows well on unfavorable sites. In the past, it was a major source of pitch and timber for ship building, mine timbers, and railroad ties because the wood&#x27;s high resin content preserves it from decay. As such, it has also been used for elaborate wood constructions, e. g. radio towers.

Pitch pine is currently used mainly for rough construction, pulp, crating, and fuel. However, due to its uneven growth, quantities of high quality can be difficult to obtain, and large lengths of pitch pine can be very costly.

Archaeology indicates that the Iroquois, Shinnecock, and Cherokee all utilized pitch pine. The Iroquois used the pitch to treat rheumatism, burns, cuts, and boils. Pitch also worked as a laxative. A pitch pine poultice was used by both the Iroquois and the Shinnecock to open boils and to treat abscesses. The Cherokee used pitch pine wood in canoe construction and for decorative carvings.

Pitch pine is known to cross with pond loblolly and shortleaf pines. One of those crosses is the pitlolly pine (pinus x rigitaeda), a natural hybrid between the loblolly pine and the pitch pine. This hybrid combines the tall size of the loblolly pine and the cold-hardiness of the pitch pine. This hybrid was used as substitute of loblolly pine and has been extensively planted in South Korea.

<text>Dale Evans Rogers (born Frances Octavia Smith; October 31, 1912 – February 7, 2001) was an American actress, singer, and songwriter. She was the second wife of singing cowboy film star Roy Rogers.

==Early life and career==

Evans was born Frances Octavia Smith on October 31, 1912, in Uvalde, Texas, to Bettie Sue Wood and T. Hillman Smith. She was raised in Italy, Texas. She started singing at the community&#x27;s Baptist church whe she was 3. She had a tumultuous early life. She spent a lot of time living with her uncle, Dr. L.D. Massey MD FACP, an internal medicine physician, in Osceola, Arkansas. At age 14, she eloped with and married Thomas F. Fox, with whom she had one son, Thomas F. Fox Jr., when she was 15. A year later, abandoned by her husband, she found herself in Memphis, Tennessee, a single parent pursuing a career in music. She took courses in business and landed a job at a bus company and later an insurance agency. After her boss overheard her singing, she landed jobs with Memphis radio stations (WMC and WREC), singing and playing piano. In 1930, she moved to Chicago, Illinois to expand her career. She was diagnosed with malnutrition shortly after. Divorced in 1929, she took the name Dale Evans while working at radio station WHAS (Louisville, Kentucky) in the early 1930s under the names Frances Fox and Marian Lee. after the station manager suggested it because he believed she could promote her singing career with a short pleasant sounding name that announcers and disc jockeys could easily pronounce.

==Early career==
After beginning her career singing at the radio station where she was employed as a secretary, Evans had a productive career as a jazz, swing, and big band singer that led to a screen test and contract with 20th Century Fox studios. She gained exposure on radio as the featured singer for a time on the Edgar Bergen/Charlie McCarthy show. From 1936 to 1938, she landed a job as a singer for Dallas, Texas radio station WFAA.

Throughout this early period, Evans went through two additional failed marriages, first with August Wayne Johns from 1929 to 1935; then with accompanist and arranger Robert Dale Butts from 1937 to 1946. Neither marriage produced children. During her time at 20th Century Fox, the studio promoted her as the unmarried supporter of her teenage &quot;brother&quot; Tommy (actually her son Tom Fox, Jr.), a deception that continued through her divorce from Butts in 1946 and her development as a cowgirl co-star to Roy Rogers at Republic Studios.

==Joint efforts==
Evans married Roy Rogers on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1947 at the Flying L Ranch in Davis, Oklahoma, where they had earlier filmed the movie &quot;Home in Oklahoma&quot;. The successful marriage was Rogers&#x27; third and Evans&#x27; fourth; the two were a team on- and off-screen from 1946 until Rogers&#x27; death in 1998. Shortly after the wedding, Evans ended the deception regarding her son Tommy. Roy had an adopted daughter, Cheryl, and two biological children, Linda and Roy Jr. (Dusty), from his second marriage. Together they had one child, Robin Elizabeth, who died of complications of Down syndrome shortly before her second birthday. Her life inspired Evans to write her bestseller &quot;Angel Unaware&quot;. Evans was very influential in changing public perceptions of children with developmental disabilities and served as a role model for many parents. After she wrote &quot;Angel Unaware&quot;, a group then known as the “Oklahoma County Council for Mentally Retarded Children” adopted its better-known name Dale Rogers Training Center in her honor. She went on to write a number of religious and inspirational books, and she and Roy appeared many times with Billy Graham in Crusades all over the country, singing gospel songs and giving their testimony. Evans and Rogers adopted four other children: Mimi, Dodie, Sandy, and Debbie.

From 1951 to 1957, Evans and Rogers starred in the highly-successful television series &quot;The Roy Rogers Show&quot;, in which they continued their cowboy and cowgirl roles, with her riding her trusty buckskin horse, Buttermilk. In addition to her successful TV shows, more than 30 films and some 200 songs, Evans wrote the song &quot;Happy Trails&quot;. In later episodes of the program, she was outspoken in her Christianity, telling people that God would assist them with their troubles and imploring adults and children to turn to Him for guidance. In late 1962, the couple co-hosted a comedy-western-variety program, &quot;The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show&quot;.

In 1964, Evans spoke at a &quot;Project Prayer&quot; rally attended by 2,500 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. The gathering, which was hosted by actor Anthony Eisley, star of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; series, sought to flood the United States Congress with letters in support of mandatory school prayer, following two decisions in 1962 and 1963 of the United States Supreme Court which struck down mandatory prayer as conflicting with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Evans supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election.

Joining Evans and Eisley at the Project Prayer rally were Walter Brennan, Lloyd Nolan, Rhonda Fleming, Pat Boone, and Gloria Swanson. Evans declared, &quot;It&#x27;s high time that all America stood up to be counted. Let our children learn of the Lord and be free.&quot; Eisley and Fleming added that Rogers, John Wayne, Ronald Reagan, Mary Pickford, Jane Russell, Ginger Rogers, and Pat Buttram would have attended the rally had their schedules permitted. In the 1970s, Evans recorded several solo albums of religious music. During the 1980s, the couple introduced their films weekly on the former The Nashville Network. In the 1990s, Evans hosted her own religious television program.
==Death==
Evans died of congestive heart failure on February 7, 2001, at the age of 88, in Apple Valley, California. She is interred at Sunset Hills Memorial Park in Apple Valley, next to Rogers.

==Legacy==
For her contribution to radio, Evans has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6638 Hollywood Blvd. She received a second star at 1737 Vine St. for her contribution to the television industry. In 1976, she was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In 1995, she was inducted into the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas. In 1997, she was inducted into the Texas Trail of Fame. She ranked No. 34 on &quot;CMT&#x27;s 40 Greatest Women in Country Music&quot; in 2002.

Cheryl Rogers-Barnett, a daughter of Roy Rogers and step-daughter of Evans, co-authored &quot;Cowboy Princess: Life with My Parents, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans&quot; with Frank Thompson.

In 2001, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to her and Roy Rogers. In 2018, she was inducted into the National Multicultural Western Heritage Museum.

<text>Persicaria perfoliata (basionym Polygonum perfoliatum) is a species of flowering plant in the buckwheat family. Common names include mile-a-minute, devil&#x27;s tail, giant climbing tearthumb, and Asiatic tearthumb. It is a trailing herbaceous annual vine with barbed stems and triangular leaves. It is native to most of temperate and tropical eastern Asia, occurring from eastern Russia and Japan in the north, and the range extending to the Philippines and India in the south.

&quot;P. perfoliata&quot; is an aggressive, highly invasive weed. In Europe, &quot;Persicaria perfoliata&quot; is included since 2016 in the list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern (the Union list). This implies that this species cannot be imported, cultivated, transported, commercialized, planted, or intentionally released into the environment in the whole of the European Union.

== Description ==

&quot;Persicaria perfoliata&quot; has a reddish stem that is armed with downward pointing hooks or barbs which are also present on the underside of the leaf blades. The light green leaves are shaped like an equilateral (equal-sided) triangle and alternate along the narrow, delicate stems. Distinctive circular, cup-shaped leafy structures, called ochreas, surround the stem at intervals. 

Flower buds, and later flowers and fruits, emerge from within the ocreas. Flowers are small, white and generally inconspicuous. The edible fruits are attractive, metallic blue and segmented, each segment containing a single glossy, black or reddish-black seed.

== Habitat ==
&quot;Persicaria perfoliata&quot; prefers warm open areas, along the edges of woods, wetlands, stream banks, and roadsides, and uncultivated open fields, resulting from both natural and human causes, dense wooded areas where the overstory has opened up increasing the sunlight to the forest floor. Natural areas such as stream banks, parks, open space, road shoulders, forest edges and fence lines are all typical areas to find &quot;P. perfoliata&quot;. It also occurs in environments that are extremely wet with poor soil structure.

Available light and soil moisture are both integral to the successful colonization of this species. It will tolerate shade for a part of the day, but needs a good percentage, 63-100% of the available light. The ability of &quot;P. perfoliata&quot; to attach to other plants with its recurved barbs and climb over the plants to reach an area of high light intensity is a key to its survival. It can survive in areas with relatively low soil moisture, but demonstrates a preference for high soil moisture.

== Uses ==
In traditional Chinese medicine, &quot;Persicaria perfoliata&quot; is known as &quot;gangbangui&quot; (), and is thought to be useful for various remedies in herbal medicine. It can also be used as a fiber or used in rope making.
=== Edibility ===
&quot;Persicaria perfoliata&quot; is an edible species. Its tender leaves and shoots can be eaten raw or cooked as a salad green or vegetable and its fruit is sweet and can be eaten fresh.

== Introduction in the United States ==

The first records of &quot;Persicaria perfoliata&quot; in North America are from Portland, Oregon (1890), and Beltsville, Maryland (1937). Both of these sites were eliminated or did not establish permanent populations of the species. 

However, the introduction of &quot;P. perfoliata&quot; somewhere between the late 1930s and 1946 to a nursery site in Stewartstown, York County, Pennsylvania, produced a population of this plant that did become established in the wild. It is speculated that the seed was spread with &quot;Rhododendron&quot; stock. Starting in 2004, the weevil &quot;Rhinoncomimus latipes&quot; has been introduced in eastern US to control this plant, with certain amount of success.

== Reproduction and propagation ==
&quot;Persicaria perfoliata&quot; is primarily a self-pollinating plant (supported by its inconspicuous, closed flowers with little scent), with occasional outcrossing. Fruits and viable seeds are produced without assistance from pollinators. Vegetative propagation from roots has not been successful for this plant. It is a very tender annual, withering with a slight frost, and reproduces successfully until the first frost. &quot;P. perfoliata&quot; is a prolific seeder, producing many seeds on a single plant over a long season, from June until October in Virginia, and a slightly shorter season in more northern geographic areas. It can cover as much as in a single season, maybe even more in the southern United States.

Birds are probably the primary long-distance dispersal agents of &quot;P. perfoliata&quot;. Transport of seeds short distances by native ant species has been observed. This activity is probably encouraged by the presence of a tiny white food body (elaiosome) on the tip of the seed that may be attractive to the ants. These seed-carrying ants may play an important role in the survival and germination of the seeds of &quot;P. perfoliata&quot;. Local bird populations are important for dispersal under utility lines, bird feeders, fence lines and other perching locations. Other animals observed eating its fruits are chipmunks, squirrel and deer.

Water is also an important mode of dispersal. Its fruits can remain buoyant for 7–9 days, an important advantage for dispersing seed long distances in stream and river environments. The long vines frequently hang over waterways, allowing fruits that detach to be carried away in the water current.

== Chemistry ==
&quot;Persicaria perfoliata&quot; contains phenylpropanoid esters such as 6&#x27;-acetyl-3,6-diferuloylsucrose (helonioside B), 2&#x27;,4&#x27;,6&#x27;-triacetyl-3,6-diferuloylsucrose, 1, 2&#x27;,4&#x27;,6&#x27;-tetraacetyl-3,6-diferuloylsucrose, 1,2&#x27;,6&#x27;-triacetyl-3, 6-diferuloylsucrose, 2&#x27;,6&#x27;-diacetyl-3,6-diferuloylsucrose, 1,3,6-tri-p-coumaroyl-6&#x27;-feruloylsucroses, vanicoside A and vanicoside B.

<text>A video projector is an image projector that receives a video signal and projects the corresponding image onto a projection screen using a lens system. Video projectors use a very bright ultra-high-performance lamp (a special mercury arc lamp), Xenon arc lamp, metal halide lamp, LED or solid state blue, RB, RGB or fiber-optic lasers to provide the illumination required to project the image. Most modern projectors can correct any curves, blurriness and other inconsistencies through manual settings.

Video projectors are used for many applications such as conference room presentations, classroom training, home cinema, movie theaters, and concerts, having mostly replaced overhead, slide and conventional film projectors. In schools and other educational settings, they are sometimes connected to an interactive whiteboard. In the late 20th century, they became commonplace in home cinema. Although large LCD television screens became quite popular, video projectors are still common among many home theater enthusiasts. In some applications, video projectors have been replaced with large monitors or LED screens, or their replacement has been explored.

==Overview==
A video projector, also known as a digital projector, may project onto a traditional reflective projection screen, or it may be built into a cabinet with a translucent rear-projection screen to form a single unified display device.

Common display resolutions include SVGA (800×600 pixels), XGA (1024×768 pixels), SXGA+ (1400×1050 pixels), 720p (1280×720 pixels), and 1080p (1920×1080 pixels), 4K UHD (3840×2160), as well as 16:10 aspect ratio resolutions including WXGA+ (1280×800 pixels) and WUXGA (1920×1200 pixels).

If a blue laser is used, a phosphor wheel is used to turn blue light into white light, which is also the case with white LEDs. (White LEDs do not use lasers.) A wheel is used in order to prolong the lifespan of the phosphor, as it is degraded by the heat generated by the laser diode. Remote fiber-optic RGB laser racks can be placed far away from the projector, and several racks can be housed in a single, central room. Each projector can use up to two racks, and several monochrome lasers are mounted on each rack, the light of which is mixed and transmitted to the projector booth using optical fibers. Projectors using RB lasers use a blue laser with a phosphor wheel in conjunction with a conventional solid-state red laser.

The cost of a projector is typically driven by its base technology, features, resolution and light output. A projector with a higher light output (measured in lumens) is required for a larger screen or for a room with more ambient light. For example, a light output of approximately 1500 to 2500 ANSI lumens is suitable for small screens viewed in rooms with low ambient light; approximately 2500 to 4000 lm is suitable for medium-sized screens with some ambient light; over 4000 lm is needed for very large screens or use in rooms with no lighting control such as conference rooms. High brightness large-venue models are increasingly common in boardrooms, auditoriums and other high-profile spaces, and models up to 75,000 lm are used in large staging applications such as concerts, keynote addresses and displays projected on buildings. Video projectors can have a mechanism similar to local backlight dimming to achieve higher contrast ratios by using 6 DLP chips: 3 for display, and 3 for local dimming.

A few camcorders have a built-in projector suitable to make a small projection; a few more powerful &quot;pico projectors&quot; are pocket-sized, and many projectors are portable.

==Projection technologies==

*LCD projector using LCD light gates. This is the simplest system, making it one of the most common and affordable for home theaters and business use. Common problems include a visible screen-door or pixelation effect, and the LCD panels deteriorating from heat and from UV degradation, leading to discolored spots or holes in the image, although recent advances have reduced the severity of these issues in some models.
*DLP projector using Texas Instruments’ Digital Light Processing (DLP) technology. This uses one to three microfabricated light valves called digital micromirror devices (DMDs). The single- and double-DMD versions use rotating color wheels in time with the mirror refreshes to modulate color. The most common problem with the single- or two-DMD varieties is a visible rainbow which some people perceive when moving their eyes. More recent projectors with higher speed (2× or 4×) and otherwise optimized color wheels have lessened this effect. 3-chip DLP projectors do not have this problem, as they display each primary color simultaneously, and offer higher light output and more accurate color reproduction, however the cost is significantly higher and thus 3-chip DLP technology is typically used in large venue, high brightness models, as well as Digital Cinema projectors.
*liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) projectors. Such projectors often process light in the wavelength domain, which enables correction of optical aberrations using Zernike polynomials. Some commercially available technologies include:
**D-ILA JVC’s Direct-drive Image Light Amplifier based on LCoS technology.
**SXRD Sony’s proprietary variant of LCoS technology.
*LED projectors use one of the above-mentioned technologies for image creation, with an array of light-emitting diodes (LEDs)as the light source, negating the need for lamp replacement.
*Hybrid LED and laser diode system developed by Casio. Uses a combination of LEDs and 445 nm laser diodes as the light source, while image is processed with DLP chip.
*Laser diode projectors have been developed by Microvision and Aaxa Technologies. Microvision projectors use Microvision&#x27;s patented MEMS laser beam-steering technology, whereas Aaxa Technologies uses LCoS with laser diodes as the light source.
*Laser projectors use a monochrome blue laser light source to excite a yellow phosphor medium creating a broad spectrum light. This broadband spectrum light is then split into the primaries with a color wheel and are used with most common projection technologies, including single and 3-chip DLP, LCD and LCoS. Typical laser light sources used in projectors are rated for 20,000 hours before the light output is reduced to 50%, whereas lamps lose brightness quickly and need to be replaced after as little as 1000–2000 hours.

===Obsolete technologies===
*CRT projector using cathode-ray tubes. Once dominated the video projection market, but given their limited light output, size, weight and need for complex alignment, they have since been displaced by digital projectors and are no longer being made.
*Eidophor oil-film projectors.
*LIA (light image amplifier) light valves.
*ILA, marketed by Hughes-JVC. It is the predecessor to JVC&#x27;s D-ILA offering.
*Schmidt-CRT, developed by Kloss Video.
*Talaria oil-film projectors.

== Do-it-yourself video projectors ==
Some hobbyists build do-it-yourself (DIY) projectors at low costs. They build their projectors from kits, sourced components, or from scratch, using a television set, cellphone screen, or LED lighting as a light source. DIY construction plans can be obtained through the internet for domestic and classroom use.

<text>HMS &quot;Uganda was a [[Second World War]]-era [[light cruiser]] launched in 1941. She served in the [[Royal Navy]] during 1943 and 1944, including operations in the Mediterranean, and was transferred to the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] asHMCS &quot;Uganda in October 1944. She served in the Pacific theatre in 1945 and was put into reserve in 1947. When she was reactivated for the Korean War in 1952 she was renamed HMCS &quot;Quebec&quot;. She was decommissioned for the last time in 1956 and scrapped in Japan in 1961.

==Construction and career==

HMS &quot;Uganda&quot; was one of the &quot;Ceylon&quot; sub-class (the second group of three ships built in 1939) of the &quot;Fiji&quot;-class cruisers, and built by Vickers-Armstrong at their Walker yard. She was launched on 7 August 1941 and commissioned on 3 January 1943.

===Home Fleet operations===
In March 1943 after training at Scapa Flow, &quot;Uganda&quot; sailed as convoy escort to protect a Sierra Leone-bound convoy from the German s operating from the Bay of Biscay. After two such convoy duties, she was sent as escort for the ocean liner carrying Winston Churchill and his staff to Washington. The journey was made at , and the ship sailed into Naval Station Argentia, in Newfoundland, low on fuel. Upon return from that duty &quot;Uganda&quot; returned to Plymouth for a refit.

=== Mediterranean Fleet operations ===
With her refit completed, she was sent to the Mediterranean Sea as escort to one of the largest troop convoys of the war heading to Sicily. In July the ship joined the 15th Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet. &quot;Uganda&quot; was part of the bombardment fleet for Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily, on 10 July 1943. She was then assigned to close support for major bombardments throughout Sicily. &quot;Uganda&quot; sailed as part of the support force for Operation Husky from Alexandria along with three cruisers and six destroyers. &quot;Uganda&quot; was part of Support Force East during the Operation Husky landings. Within the British bridgehead, &quot;Uganda&quot;, with the cruisers and and the monitor supported the British Eighth Army. On 10 August, again in support of the Eighth Army, &quot;Uganda&quot; and the Dutch gunboat bombarded positions north of Reposto. On 12 August, &quot;Uganda&quot;, the monitor and the Dutch gunboats and shelled the east coast of Sicily.

On the opening of Operation Avalanche, 9 September 1943, she was part of the fleet bombardment covering the invasion of Italy at Salerno. As part of Operation Avalanche, &quot;Uganda&quot; was a member of the Northern Attack Force, which landed the British X Corps. The cruiser was a member of the support and escort group for the force. The landings are successful, however the Germans counterattacked and created a serious situation on the beachhead. &quot;Uganda&quot; was among the ships forced to lie inshore to provide direct naval gunfire support. The fleet then suffered air attacks using FX 1400 radio-controlled and Hs 293 glider bombs. While serving off Salerno at 1440 on 13 September 1943 she took a direct hit from a new German radio controlled 1.4 tonne glide bomb Fritz X dropped by a KG 100 bomber. The Fritz X passed through seven decks and straight through her keel, exploding underwater just under the keel. The concussive shock of the Fritz X&#x27;s underwater detonation close to &quot;Uganda&quot;″s hull extinguished all her boiler fires, and resulted in sixteen men being killed, with &quot;Uganda&quot; taking on 1,300 tons of water. Damage control under Lieutenant Leslie Reed managed to get the ship moving with one engine. She was towed to Malta by , where temporary repairs were made.

There being no dry dock available in the European Theatre that could handle the repairs, &quot;Uganda&quot; was sent to the US shipyard at Charleston, South Carolina. The heavily damaged ship, with only one of her four propellers working, proceeded across the Atlantic Ocean to Charleston, arriving on 27 November 1943. During the repairs, &quot;Uganda&quot; had two hangars designed for carrying Supermarine Walrus reconnaissance aircraft removed. These hangars were used for radio and radar equipment as well as crew amenities.

===Transfer to Canada===
While under repair the Government of Canada negotiated with Britain to obtain &quot;Uganda&quot; for the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). The official transfer took place on Trafalgar Day, 21 October 1944, at Charleston and she was renamed HMCS &quot;Uganda&quot;, out of respect for the British colony. &quot;Uganda&quot;s first crew in RCN service was notable. The commanding officer was Captain Rollo Mainguy, OBE, who later became chief of the Naval Staff. The first officer (executive officer) was Commander Hugh Pullen, and other officers including Lieutenant Commanders William Landymore and Littler were all eventually promoted to flag rank following the war. Lieutenant John Robarts, Aircraft Recognition Officer, went on to become Premier of Ontario. The other members of her crew of 907 comprised a carefully selected group; additional training on cruisers was provided through personnel exchanges with the RN. The first crew for &quot;Uganda&quot; was drawn from every province in Canada as well as the Dominion of Newfoundland. Eighty-seven per cent were reservists (RCNVR and RCNR) while the balance were regular members of the Royal Canadian Navy.

&quot;Uganda&quot;s first assignment came shortly after her recommissioning. She was tasked to join the British Pacific Fleet&#x27;s operational area south of Sakishima Gunto. She joined the 4th Cruiser Squadron and spent the rest of the month working up. The conditions for the crew were arduous since the ship had not been modified for tropical conditions, which would have provided better air circulation throughout the ship and more fresh water capacity. &quot;Uganda&quot; left Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 31 October 1944 and steamed via the United Kingdom where following her reconstruction at Charleston, the cruiser underwent further modification. She departed the United Kingdom in January 1945 and sailed to the Pacific, stopping at Gibraltar, Alexandria, Egypt, the Suez Canal, and on via Aden and Colombo, Ceylon, to the fleet base at Fremantle, Western Australia, where she arrived on 4 March 1945.

As the flagship for the RCN, &quot;Uganda&quot; served in the Pacific War with the British Pacific Fleet, joining it at Sydney, Australia, in February 1945. Assigned to Task Force 57, British Pacific Fleet, because her radar and aircraft identification capabilities were amongst the best in the fleet, owing to her 1944 refit in Charleston. On 10 April 1945, the strike against Sakishima Gunto was cancelled and the task force was ordered to attack Formosa instead. From 11 to 13 April 1945, &quot;Uganda&quot;, as part of Task Force 57 in the Pacific, she attacked airfields and installations in northern Formosa, before being redirected back to Sakishima Gunto. The cruiser took part in the bombardment of the Japanese airbases on Sakishima Gunto between 15–20 April before the fleet was tasked to Leyte Gulf. During her time with Task Force 57, &quot;Uganda&quot; came under kamikaze attack. She received battle honours for operations during the Battle of Okinawa and was involved in attacking Truk, Formosa and Sakishima Gunto.

At Leyte she joined the United States Third Fleet, east of Japan and became the only Royal Canadian Navy warship to fight in the Pacific Theatre against the Imperial Japanese Navy. In May 1945, Task Force 57 sailed from Leyte to attack Sakishima Gunto for nearly the entire month. &quot;Uganda&quot; was among the ships ordered to bombard the island group. The task force suffered kamikaze attacks, forcing two of the aircraft carriers to retire and damaging another.

In the aftermath of the Conscription Crisis of 1944, on 4 April 1945, the Canadian government changed the manning policy for all ships deploying to the Pacific theatre. All those heading to the Pacific would have to re-volunteer. Upon volunteering again, the serviceman would be eligible for 30 days leave in Canada before deployment. Controversially this policy change was applied to those already there and &quot;Uganda&quot; RCN crew were polled by the Canadian government on 7 May 1945 to determine whether they would volunteer for further duties in the Pacific War. Widespread discontent had grown amongst the crew, due to poor living conditions, &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks and the lack of a Canadian identity for the ship (for instance, the Canadian Red Ensign was not flown and no maple leaf was painted on the funnel, which many crewmen saw as an insult to Canada). The crew of &quot;Uganda&quot; felt that they had enlisted for &quot;hostilities only&quot; (i.e., hostilities against Nazi Germany), but now found themselves fighting a different enemy in a quite different part of the world. The policy also signalled the Canadian government&#x27;s lack of commitment to the Pacific War. Captain Mainguy later acknowledged that: &quot;The next signal we got fairly shortly was: &#x27;Do you volunteer to fight against the Japanese?&#x27; It seemed pretty stupid. [There] were those incentives just to be annoyed and say, &#x27;Well, if we&#x27;re not wanted, of course, we don&#x27;t want to fight the Japs if it&#x27;s not necessary. In addition, when the &quot;volunteers only&quot; policy became public knowledge in Canada, family obligations became an increasing burden, as this left the crew with a difficult decision to prioritize their families or their sense of duty that had driven them to volunteer in the first place. 

As a result, the vote on 7 May was held onboard &quot;Uganda&quot; and 605 crew out of 907 refused to re-volunteer for continuing operations against Japan. The British Admiralty was furious and said it could not replace the ship until 27 July at the earliest. However, the cruiser continued her deployment in the Pacific throughout June and July while the Naval Staff sought an answer to the problem. An embarrassed Royal Canadian Navy offered to replace &quot;Uganda&quot; with , an anti-aircraft flak ship that was being refitted in Vancouver.

&quot;Uganda&quot; took part in Operation Inmate, a carrier raid on Japanese installations at Truk. Sailing on 12 June from Manus Island, the cruiser was among the ships detailed to bombard the island of Dublon. The force returned to Manus Island on 17 June. In July, &quot;Uganda&quot;, now part of Task Force 37, sailed to join up with the Americans performing carrier air strikes on the Tokyo area, arriving on 16 July. On 27 July, &quot;Uganda&quot; was relieved by .

HMCS &quot;Uganda&quot; was detached from the US Navy&#x27;s Third Fleet on 27 July when &quot;Argonaut&quot; arrived. &quot;Uganda&quot; proceeded to Eniwetok, and then to Pearl Harbor for refuelling before heading for Esquimalt. En route to Pearl Harbor, one boiler suffered a liner collapse which would have resulted in the ship&#x27;s withdrawal from active combat at any rate. &quot;Uganda&quot; limped into Pearl Harbor on 4 August but was not welcomed because of the resentment that her crew was &quot;quitting&quot; the war. &quot;Uganda&quot; departed after refuelling and proceeded for Esquimalt. En route to Canada, the crew heard news about the atomic bombs being dropped on Japan. They arrived in Esquimalt on 10 August, the day that Japan announced its acceptance of the Instrument of Surrender.

HMCS &quot;Uganda&quot; remained on the Pacific coast following the war serving in a training capacity. The cruiser was paid off on 1 August 1947 into the RCN reserve.

===Return to service===

Canada&#x27;s entry into the Korean War and commitment of Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Air Force and Royal Canadian Navy units to the British Commonwealth Forces Korea necessitated the reactivation of HMCS &quot;Uganda&quot;. Beginning in August 1951, the cruiser was refitted and modernized at Esquimalt. The vessel was recommissioned on 14 January 1952 as HMCS &quot;Quebec&quot; (C31) and moved immediately from Esquimalt to her new station at Halifax to replace units which had departed for Korea. On 14 June 1952, &quot;Quebec&quot; visited her namesake province for the first time during a port visit to Sorel, Quebec. From 13–25 September, &quot;Quebec&quot; and the aircraft carrier participated in the major NATO naval exercise Mainbrace in northern European waters.

In February 1953, &quot;Quebec&quot;, with and sailed to Bermuda for training with the Royal Navy submarine . On 15 June 1953, HMCS &quot;Quebec&quot; was the flagship for Rear Admiral Bidwell and led the RCN ships to Spithead for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The Royal Canadian Navy group consisted of an aircraft carrier, two cruisers, one destroyer, and two frigates. In October 1954, &quot;Quebec&quot; sailed on a seven-week training cruise to the Caribbean Sea and South America, making several port visits. Returning in mid-April 1955, &quot;Quebec&quot; became the first Canadian naval ship to circumnavigate Africa. As part of a post–Korean War realignment within the navy, HMCS &quot;Quebec&quot; was paid off on 13 June 1956 and placed in reserve at Sydney, Nova Scotia. The ship was sold in 1960 with the partially dismantled &quot;Ontario&quot; to Mitsui and Co. of Japan for scrap. The ship was broken up in Japan in 1961.

Her unit name lived on in the form of HMCS &quot;Quebec&quot;, a cadet summer training centre for the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets. The training centre closed permanently after its summer 2012 operating season.

<text>Ernest Joseph &quot;Dutch&quot; Harrison (March 29, 1910 – June 19, 1982) was an American professional golfer whose career spanned over four decades—one of the longest in the history of the PGA Tour.

== Early life ==
Harrison was born in Conway, Arkansas. He was nicknamed &quot;The Arkansas Traveler.&quot;

== Professional career ==
In 1930, Harrison turned pro at the start of the Great Depression. Although he played in what tournaments existed in those days, the mainstay of his income was the many exhibitions and private &quot;money&quot; matches in which he, as well as many of his fellow professionals, played.

Harrison had a total of 18 career PGA Tour victories spanning from the 1939 Bing Crosby Pro-Am to the 1958 Tijuana Open Invitational. However, as late as 1969, Harrison had a top-25 finish in the Canadian Open at the age of 59. He played on three Ryder Cup teams: 1947, 1949, and 1951.

Harrison finished nine times in the top-10 at major championships, including third place finishes at the 1939 PGA Championship and the 1960 U.S. Open. He won the Vardon Trophy for lowest scoring average in 1954 and ranks fifth on the list of players with the most PGA Tour victories without a major championship on his resume.

In 1954, Harrison became the Old Warson Country Club&#x27;s first golf professional. 

== Personal life ==
Harrison was married to the well-known public health advocate and politician Thelma Akana Harrison.

In 1982, Harrison died of heart failure at the age of 72 in St. Louis, Missouri.

<text>Pinus resinosa, known as red pine (also Norway pine in Minnesota), is a pine native to Eastern North America.

==Description==
Red pine is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by tall, straight growth. It usually ranges from in height and in trunk diameter, exceptionally reaching tall. The crown is conical, becoming a narrow rounded dome with age. The bark is thick and gray-brown at the base of the tree, but thin, flaky and bright orange-red in the upper crown; the tree&#x27;s name derives from this distinctive character. Some red color may be seen in the fissures of the bark. The species is self pruning; there tend not to be dead branches on the trees, and older trees may have very long lengths of branchless trunk below the canopy.

The leaves are needle-like, dark yellow-green, in fascicles of two, long, and brittle. The leaves snap cleanly when bent; this character, stated as diagnostic for red pine in some texts, is however shared by several other pine species. The cones are symmetrical ovoid, long by broad, and purple before maturity, ripening to nut-blue and opening to broad, the scales without a prickle and almost stalkless.

The pine grows well in sandy soils and on soils which are too poor for white pine.

=== Phylogeny ===
Red pine is notable for its very constant morphology and low genetic variation throughout its range, suggesting it has been through a near extinction in its recent evolutionary history. A genetic study of nuclear microsatellite polymorphisms among populations distributed throughout its natural range found that red pine populations from Newfoundland are genetically distinct from most mainland populations, consistent with dispersal from different glacial refugia in this highly self-pollinating species.

==Distribution and habitat==
It occurs from Newfoundland west to Manitoba, and south to Pennsylvania, with several smaller, disjunct populations occurring in the Appalachian Mountains in Virginia and West Virginia, as well as a few small pockets in extreme northern New Jersey and northern Illinois.

It can be found in a variety of habitats.

==Ecology==
It is intolerant of shade, but does well in windy sites; it grows best in well-drained soil. It is a long-lived tree, reaching a maximum age of about 500 years.

== Uses ==
The wood is commercially valuable in forestry for timber and paper pulp, and the tree is also used for landscaping.

The wood is light, hard, and very close grained. It is not durable in contact with soil without chemical treatment. It is used in construction for piling, masts, spars, boxes, and crates.

== In culture ==
The red pine is Minnesota&#x27;s state tree. In Minnesota the use of the name &quot;Norway&quot; may stem from early Scandinavian immigrants who likened the American red pines to the Scots pines back home.

<doc id="507805" wikidata="Q952618" url="?curid=507805" title="Eternal September">
<text>Eternal September or the September that never ended was a cultural phenomenon during a period beginning around late 1993 and early 1994, when Internet service providers began offering Usenet access to many new users. Prior to this, the only sudden changes in the volume of new users of Usenet occurred each September, when cohorts of university students would gain access to it for the first time. The periodic flood of new users overwhelmed the existing culture for online forums and the ability to enforce existing norms. AOL began their Usenet gateway service in March 1994, leading to a constant stream of new users. Hence, from the early Usenet hobbyist point of view, the influx of new users that began in September 1993 appeared to be endless.

==History==

During the 1980s and early 1990s, Usenet and the Internet were generally the domain of dedicated computer professionals and hobbyists; new users joined slowly, in small numbers, and observed and learned the social conventions of online interaction without having much of an impact on the experienced users. The only exception to this was September of every year, when large numbers of first-year college students gained access to the Internet and Usenet through their universities. These large groups of new users who had not yet learned online etiquette created a nuisance for the experienced users, who came to dread September every year. Once ISPs like AOL made affordable Internet access widely available for home users, a continuous influx of new users began, making it feel like it was always &quot;September&quot; to the more experienced users.

The full phrase appears to have evolved over a series of months on two separate alt.folklore newsgroups where a number of threads exist lamenting what they saw as an increase in low-quality posts across various newsgroups. Several members of the newsgroups referenced aspects of the &quot;September&quot; issue, typically in a joking manner. 

In a thread on January 8, 1994, Joel Furr cross-posted asking &quot;Is it just me, or has Delphi unleashed a staggering amount of weirdos on the net?&quot;, which garnered a reply from Karl Reinsch &quot;Of course it&#x27;s perpetually September for Delphi users, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; The day before, Furr had also posted the same message to alt.folklore.urban, where David Fischer responded with a joke call-to-action where he referred to the increasing numbers of Delphi users as the &quot;Never-Ending-September&quot;. Fischer also replied to a different thread on January 25, 1994, in alt.folklore.computers saying, &quot;It&#x27;s moot now. September 1993 will go down in net history as the September that never ended.&quot; This quote has been suggested to have been the first reference.

Possibly the first use of the &quot;Eternal September&quot; phrase was a newsgroup post by John William Chambless in February 1994. He posted a rant including some excerpts of low-quality articles he found in one of his newsgroups that day, but titled the post &quot;The Eternal September&quot;.

==Legacy==

A tongue-in-cheek program called &quot;sdate&quot; outputs the current date, formatted using the Eternal September calendar (September &quot;X&quot;, 1993, where &quot;X&quot; is an unbounded counter for days since that epoch). This is not the identically named &quot;sdate&quot;, one of the sixty commands that comes with the First Edition of Unix, that is used to set the system clock. Named with similar humour is one of the free public Usenet servers, Eternal-September.org.

<doc id="507806" wikidata="Q148882" url="?curid=507806" title="Euphorbia esula">
<text>Euphorbia esula, commonly known as green spurge or leafy spurge, is a species of spurge native to central and southern Europe (north to England, the Netherlands, and Germany), and eastward through most of Asia north of the Himalaya to Korea and eastern Siberia. It can also be found in some parts of Alaska.

==Description==

It is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to 1-1.2 m tall, with several stems branched from the base. The stems are smooth, hairless, or slightly hairy. The leaves are small, lanceolate, 4-8.5 cm long and up to 1 cm broad, with a slightly wavy margin. The flowers are small, produced in umbels with a basal pair of bright yellow-green petal-like bracts. Clusters of the bracts appear in late spring, while the actual flowers do not develop until early summer. All parts of the plant contain a toxic white milky sap.

It reproduces readily like by seeds that have a high germination rate and may remain viable in the soil for at least eight years. The seed capsules open explosively, dispersing seed up to 5 m from the parent plant, and may be carried further by water and wildlife. Leafy spurge also spreads vegetatively from the root system, which is complex, reported to reach 8 m into the ground and 5 m across, and may have numerous buds.

There are two subspecies and a hybrid subspecies:
*&quot;Euphorbia esula&quot; subsp. &quot;esula&quot;. Leaves broadest near apex; umbel bracts 5–15 mm. Throughout the range of the species.
*&quot;Euphorbia esula&quot; subsp. &quot;tommasiniana&quot; (Bertol.) Kuzmanov (syn. &quot;E. waldsteinii&quot; (Sojak) A.R.Smith; &quot;E. virgata&quot; Waldst. &amp; Kit.). Leaves broadest at the middle; umbel bracts 12–35 mm. Eastern Europe, western Asia.
*&quot;Euphorbia esula&quot; nothosubsp. &quot;pseudovirgata&quot; (Schur) Govaerts. Hybrid between the above two subspecies.

==Confusion with &quot;Euphorbia virgata&quot;==
It has commonly been confused with &quot;Euphorbia virgata&quot;. &quot;E. esula&quot; is no longer considered a permanent component of the North American flora. &quot;E. esula&quot; is restricted to certain parts of Europe and not considered a weedy species, while &quot;E. virgata&quot; is found throughout the United States and Canada and has caused significant economic and ecological impacts. &quot;E. virgata&quot; is best distinguished from &quot;E. esula&quot; by its leaves, which are 6-15 times longer than wide with margins that are (near-)parallel at the middle of the blade, while &quot;E. esula&quot; leaves are wider toward the tip, usually 3-8 times longer than wide, with margins that are not parallel at the middle of the leaf. In addition, the apex of &quot;E. virgata&quot; is usually acute and the base is truncate to attenuate, while the apex of &quot;E. esula&quot; is rounded or subacute and the base is more gradually attenuate or cuneate. Mentions of &quot;E. esula&quot; in the North American flora and invasive species literature are now referred to &quot;E. virgata&quot;.

<text>The &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Published by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, the data are compiled by Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single&#x27;s weekly physical sales and airplays.

Twelve singles topped the chart during the year. &quot;On Bended Knee&quot; by Boyz II Men began its peak at the top in 1994. The longest running number-one single of 1995 is &quot;Fantasy&quot; by Mariah Carey, which logged eight weeks atop the chart. The second longest-reigning number one single is a three-way tie between &quot;Take a Bow&quot; by Madonna, &quot;This Is How We Do It&quot; by Montell Jordan, and &quot;Waterfalls&quot; by TLC, with seven weeks each.

&quot;One Sweet Day&quot; by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men held the record for the longest running song at number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with 16 weeks. It also broke the 14-week record held by Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; and Boyz II Men&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Make Love to You&quot;. Five of those weeks were logged in 1995 and the other 11 weeks were logged in 1996. Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; became the first single to debut at number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and holds the &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; as the first song in the 37-year history of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 to debut at number one. In addition, &quot;Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Exhale (Shoop Shoop)&quot; by Whitney Houston, and &quot;One Sweet Day&quot; also debuted at number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

That year, 5 acts earned their first number one song: TLC, Montell Jordan, Seal, Coolio, and L.V. Mariah Carey and TLC were the only acts to hit number one more than once, with two songs each.

<doc id="507817" wikidata="Q2703233" url="?curid=507817" title="Pinus serotina">
<text>Pinus serotina, the pond pine, black bark pine, bay pine, marsh pine, or pocosin pine, is a pine tree found along the Southeastern portion of the Atlantic coastal plain of the United States, from southern New Jersey south to Florida and west to southern Alabama. Pond pine distribution may be starting to spread west towards Mississippi and Tennessee.

== Description ==
This pine often has a crooked growth pattern and an irregular top and grows up to high, rarely to . The needles are in bundles of three or four, and long. &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot; will grow needles and little branches directly from the trunk, similar to the &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;rigida&quot; (pitch pine), but the pitch pines will only grow in drier areas. The &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot; is very similar to the common &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;taeda&quot; (loblolly pine), but the key differences are they have direct needle growth from the trunk, are smaller in size, and tend not to grow straight. The bark of the pond pine forms rough plates. They are a brownish-red color. The pond pines are not as cold hardy as the loblolly and pitch pines. It takes 18 years for the pond pine to reach full maturity. The almost round cones are long with small prickles on the scales. Its cones are usually serotinous, requiring fire to open. The pollen cones are cylinder-shaped with a yellow, brownish color, and are up to 1.8 inches long. Seed cones need two years to mature after pollination. In some cases, they will drop their seeds, but in most &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot;, they will persist and hold their seeds. The color of the seed cones and seed scales is red-brown in color. The foliar sheaths measure 0.4 to 0.8 with long bases. The seeds are ovule in shape, being 0.2 and 0.24 in length, and have an angled tip colored a pale brown. For seeds to be used for regeneration, seed trees that are 23 to 25 cm (9 - 10 inches) in DBH and 30 years old are expected to produce 5,000 seeds.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot; was described in 1803 by Andre Michaux. &quot;Pinus&quot; is a large genus of evergreen conifer trees. The species name &quot;serotina&quot; is derived from the persistently serotinous cones that may remain closed for several years before they release their seeds. Historically this species has been viewed as a subspecies of &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;taeda&quot;. Similarly &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot; has also been considered a subspecies of &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;rigida&quot; (&quot;Pinus rigida&quot; subsp. &quot;serotina&quot; (1880)).

== Habitat ==
&quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot; is primarily found in wet and poorly drained sites, most commonly in or near swamps, ponds, bays, marshes, and pocosins. This species is often associated with long leaf pine, &quot;Pinus palustris&quot;, due to similar requirements for frequent fire and pond pines needs fire to germinate. &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot; is commonly found in wet and poorly drained sites, but it will grow very well in mineral soils. Pond pines are very useful in preventing erosion and improving water quality. &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot;, thrive in flatwoods, flatwoods bogs, savannas, and barrens. At the north end of its range, pond pine intergrades and hybridizes with pitch pine (&quot;P. rigida&quot;); it is distinguished from that species by longer needles and on average slightly larger cones. Some botanists treat pond pine as a subspecies of pitch pine. &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot; habitat include mild and humid climates. The average temperature ranges from 45 degrees F to 80 degrees F. The more extreme temperature ranges recorded for &quot;Pinus&quot; serotina are -10 degrees F and 110 degrees F. The average annual precipitation for &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot; is between 44 and 55 inches.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot; stands provide habitat and support for many wildlife species, particularly for birds and mammals in wetlands and flatland environments. The pond pine is intolerant of shade. In order for reproduction to occur, &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot; needs fire in the form of intense scorching or defoliation. The buds are dormant and protected by the tree&#x27;s thick bark. When parts of the tree are top killed by fire, epicortical buds can resume growth. 15 to 20 seed trees are needed per hectare (6 to 8 acres) for the sufficient seed set after fire. Without the heat from a fire the seed fall is limited by the serotinous cones of pond pine. Pond pine seedling growth is often limited by the moisture in the soil, lack of nutrients, and competition. Under poor growing conditions pond pine seedlings grow can as little as 30 cm (12 inches) or less per year.

== Uses ==
Even though the &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot; has poor form and relatively slow growth, it can produce economically valuable tree stands of for pulpwood and saw timber where other trees will not grow. Tan or green dyes can be obtained from the needles of the &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot;. A vanillin flavoring is obtained from the byproducts of the pulpwood&#x27;s resins. It is suggested that &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot; might be a valuable remedy to treat the kidney, and can be administered as a rub or in a steam bath. &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot; may be useful in treating diseases of the mucous membrane and respiratory complaints.

== Diseases and other issues ==
Several species of bark beetles attack southern pines including pond pine, the beetles include the Southern pine beetle, three species of the Ips engraver beetles, and the black turpentine beetle. These beetle species grind through conducting tissues of their hosts. Phloem damage leads pine needles fading from green, to light green, and death of the tree. These trees also face the eastern pine weevil and are susceptible to wind damage. &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot; also faces red heart disease (&quot;Phellinus&quot; &quot;pini&quot;), a fungal disease of pines.

== Conservation statues ==
The primary threat to the &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot; is habitat loss of wet flatlands, peat-rich soils, sandy wet flatlands, and pocosins. &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot;, allows for trees to regenerate by coppicing. Thus disturbances (e.g. fire) are required for this species to persist and recruit. &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;serotina&quot;, is listed by the IUCN Red List as a species of least concern (LC) for extinction.

<text>Holland McTyeire &quot;Howlin&#x27; Mad&quot; Smith, KCB (April 20, 1882 – January 12, 1967) was a general in the United States Marine Corps during World War II. He is sometimes called the &quot;father&quot; of modern U.S. amphibious warfare. His nickname, &quot;Howlin&#x27; Mad&quot; Smith, had been given to him by his troops in the Dominican Republic in 1916.

On the eve of World War II, General Smith directed extensive Army, Navy, and Marine amphibious training, which was a major factor in successful U.S. landings in both the Atlantic and Pacific. He subsequently helped prepare U.S. Army and Canadian troops for the Kiska and Attu landings, then led the V Amphibious Corps in the assaults on the Gilbert Islands, the Marshall Islands, the island of Saipan, and Tinian in the Marianas.

During the Marianas operation, besides the V Amphibious Corps, he commanded all Expeditionary Troops, including those that recaptured Guam. He then served as the first commanding general of Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, and headed Task Force 56 (Expeditionary Troops) at Iwo Jima, which included all the assault troops in that battle.

==Early life==
Holland Smith was born on April 20, 1882, in Hatchechubbee, Alabama, to John V. Smith and his wife Cornelia Caroline McTyeire, both strict Methodists. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from Auburn University (then known as Alabama Polytechnic Institute) in 1901. He had already decided on a military career and had become first sergeant of a cavalry company in the Alabama National Guard. However, he obtained his Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Alabama in 1903 and practiced law in Montgomery, Alabama, for a year. He then sought a commission in the Army, but as none were then open he was appointed a Marine second lieutenant on March 20, 1905. (He was later awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by Alabama Polytechnic Institute.)

In April 1906, after completing the School of Application at Annapolis, Maryland, Smith sailed for the Philippines, where he served on expeditionary duty with the 1st Marine Brigade until September, 1908. He returned to the United States the following month and was stationed at the Marine Barracks, Annapolis, until December 1909, when he embarked for expeditionary duty in Panama. Returning from Panama in April 1910, he served at Annapolis, Puget Sound, Washington, San Diego, California, and the Recruiting Station, Seattle, Washington, before sailing in September 1912, to rejoin the 1st Marine Brigade in the Philippines.

He remained with the 1st Brigade until April 1914, when he took command of the Marine Detachment aboard . He served in that capacity in Asiatic waters until July 1915. He returned to the United States the following month for duty at the Navy Yard, New Orleans, Louisiana. From there, he was ordered to the Dominican Republic in June 1916, as a member of the 4th Marine Regiment. During that unit&#x27;s operations against native insurgents, he saw action in the march to Santiago and engagements at La Pena and Kilometer 29. Returning to the United States on May 30, 1917, he sailed for France and World War I just two weeks later as commander of the 8th Machine Gun Company, 5th Marines.

==World War I==
Smith&#x27;s 8th Machine Gun company was assigned to the French Chasseurs Alpins to learn the tactics of the war from experienced French troops. After this time the 8th was assigned to a camp to offload arriving American vessels, where Smith became second in command of the camp.

Smith was detached from the 5th Marines and sent to the Army General Staff College of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) at Langres, from which he graduated in February 1918. He was the first of only six Marines ever to complete this course. He was then named adjutant of the 4th Marine Brigade, which was a part of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 2nd Division, serving in a relatively quiet sector, southeast of Verdun. During the fighting in and around Belleau Wood, he played &quot;a vital though undramatic&quot; role as brigade liaison officer, overseeing internal communications within the brigade. Transferred to the I Corps, First Army, in July 1918, he served as assistant operations officer in charge of liaison during the Aisne-Marne, Oisne-Aisne Offensive, St. Mihiel and Meuse–Argonne offensives. On 25 November 1918, two weeks after the Armistice with Germany, Smith was promoted to the temporary rank of major.

After the Armistice, he participated in the March to the Rhine through Belgium and Luxembourg as an assistant operations officer with the U.S. Third Army; during the occupation of the Rhineland, he served with the General Staff, U.S. Army.

For his service at Belleau Wood, Smith was awarded the Croix de Guerre with palm by the French government. He also received a Meritorious Service Citation from General John J. Pershing, commander-in-chief of the AEF, for which he was later awarded (in 1932) the Purple Heart, one of the first awarded for merit.

==Post-World War I==
Smith returned to the United States in April 1919. His next four years included duty at Norfolk, Virginia; study at the Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island; and service in Washington, D.C., with the War Plans Section of the Office of Naval Operations, where he was the first Marine officer to serve on the Joint Army-Navy Planning Committee. Leaving Washington in May 1923, he served aboard the battleships and as Fleet Marine Officer, U.S. Scouting Fleet, until September of that year.

In February 1924, after serving at Marine Corps Headquarters and in the West Indies in connection with joint Army-Navy maneuvers, Smith joined the Marine Brigade on expeditionary duty in Haiti, serving as that unit&#x27;s chief of staff and officer in charge of operations and training. He returned in August 1925 to serve as chief of staff of the 1st Marine Brigade at Quantico, Virginia. From September 1926 to June 1927, he was a student in the Marine Corps School, Quantico, then served as post quartermaster of the Marine Barracks, Philadelphia Navy Yard, from July 1927 to March 1931.

In April 1931, Smith began another tour of sea duty, this time aboard the as aide to the commander and Force Marine Officer of the Battle Force, U.S. Fleet. From June 1933 to January 1935, he commanded the Marine barracks at the Washington Navy Yard, then and served the following two years at San Francisco, California, as chief of staff, Department of the Pacific. He was ordered to Marine Corps Headquarters in March 1937 to serve two years as director of the Division of Operations and Training.

Smith served as assistant commandant of the Marine Corps under Major General Thomas Holcomb from April to September 1939, during which he was promoted to brigadier general.

==World War II==

General Smith then assumed command of the 1st Marine Brigade at Quantico, taking that unit to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for extended amphibious training in October 1940. In February 1941, when the brigade was redesignated the U.S. 1st Marine Division, he became that organization&#x27;s first commander. He returned with the division to Quantico in April 1941, and in June of that year he was detached from it to take command of the organization that eventually became the Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet. Under this command, the 1st Marine Division and the 1st and 9th Army Divisions received their initial training in amphibious warfare. Smith was promoted to major general in October 1941.

Moving to San Diego in August 1942, the general took command of the Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet, under which he completed the amphibious indoctrination of the 2d and 3d Marine Divisions before they went overseas, and the 7th Army Division and other units involved in the Aleutians operation. The Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet, was later redesignated the V Amphibious Corps, and in September 1943, as commander of that unit, Smith arrived at Pearl Harbor to begin planning for the Gilbert Islands campaign. Promoted to lieutenant general in February 1944, he continued to lead the V Amphibious Corps until August 1944, when he was named commanding general, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, at Pearl Harbor. Subsequently, he commanded the Fleet Marine Force. In addition to that post, he commanded Task Force 56 in the Battle of Iwo Jima before returning to the United States in July 1945 to head the Marine Training and Replacement Command at Camp Pendleton, California. Holland was known for the quote &quot;In our corps without responsibility and discipline we would not have won the Battle of Iwo Jima.&quot;

While planning for the 1945 assault on Okinawa, U.S. Navy Admirals Raymond Spruance and Richmond Turner wanted Smith to command the invasion forces. They were overruled by Admiral Chester Nimitz, commander in chief of Pacific Forces, because Smith had sacked a U.S. Army general, Ralph Smith, during the Saipan campaign, and justifiable animosity between senior U.S. Army staff existed towards Smith due to his service chauvinism. U.S. Army General Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr. was appointed to command the Okinawa invasion.

==Retirement==
When Smith retired from the Marine Corps on May 15, 1946, he was promoted to general on the retired list for having been especially commended in combat. The 64-year-old took up residence in La Jolla, California, where he pursued his hobby, gardening.

Smith&#x27;s wife, the former Ada B. Wilkinson, died in 1962. Following a long illness, Smith died on January 12, 1967, at the U.S. Naval Hospital in San Diego, California, aged 84. Funeral services were held on January 14 at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot Chapel. He was interred with full military honors in Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery overlooking San Diego harbor and North Island. Smith was survived by a son, Rear Admiral John V. Smith.

==Military awards==
Smith was awarded the following military decorations and awards: 


==Honors and recognitions==

<text>The Andrew Project was a distributed computing environment developed at Carnegie Mellon University beginning in 1982. It was an ambitious project for its time and resulted in an unprecedentedly vast and accessible university computing infrastructure. The project was named after Andrew Carnegie and Andrew Mellon, the founders of the institutions that eventually became Carnegie Mellon University. 

==History==
The &quot;Information Technology Center&quot;, a partnership of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), began work on the Andrew Project in 1982. In its initial phase, the project involved both software and hardware, including wiring the campus for data and developing workstations to be distributed to students and faculty at CMU and elsewhere. The proposed &quot;3M computer&quot; workstations included a million pixel display and a megabyte of memory, running at a million instructions per second. Unfortunately, a cost on the order of US made the computers beyond the reach of students&#x27; budgets. The initial hardware deployment in 1985 established a number of university-owned &quot;clusters&quot; of public workstations in various academic buildings and dormitories. The campus was fully wired and ready for the eventual availability of inexpensive personal computers.

Early development within the Information Technology Center, originally called VICE (Vast Integrated Computing Environment) and VIRTUE (Virtue Is Reached Through Unix and Emacs), focused on centralized tools, such as a file server, and workstation tools including a window manager, editor, email, and file system client code.

Initially the system was prototyped on Sun Microsystems machines, and then to IBM RT PC series computers running a special IBM Academic Operating System. People involved in the project included James H. Morris, Nathaniel Borenstein, James Gosling, and David S. H. Rosenthal.

The project was extended several times after 1985 in order to complete the software, and was renamed &quot;Andrew&quot; for Andrew Carnegie and Andrew Mellon, the founders of the institutions that eventually became Carnegie Mellon University. Mostly rewritten as a result of experience from early deployments, Andrew had four major software components:

* The Andrew Toolkit (ATK), a set of tools that allows users to create and distribute documents containing a variety of formatted and embedded objects,
* The Andrew Messaging System (AMS), an email and bulletin board system based on ATK, and
* The Andrew File System (AFS), a distributed file system emphasizing scalability for an academic and research environment.
* The Andrew Window Manager (WM), a tiled (non-overlapping windows) window system that allowed remote display of windows on a workstation display. It was one of the first network-oriented window managers to run on Unix as a graphical display. As part of the CMU&#x27;s partnership with IBM, IBM retained the licensing rights to WM. WM was meant to be licensed under reasonable terms, which CMU thought would resemble a relatively cheap UNIX license, while IBM sought a more lucrative licensing scheme. WM was later replaced by X11 from Project Athena at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Its developers, Gosling and Rosenthal, would next develop the NeWS (Network extensible Window System).
AFS moved out of the Information Technology Center to Transarc in 1988. AMS was fully decommissioned and replaced with the Cyrus IMAP server in 2002.

==The Andrew User Interface System==
After IBM&#x27;s funding ended, Andrew continued as an open source project named the Andrew User Interface System. AUIS is a set of tools that allows users to create and distribute documents containing a variety of formatted and embedded objects. It is an open-source project run at the Department of Computer Science at CMU. The Andrew Consortium governs and maintains the development and distribution of the Andrew User Interface System.

The Andrew User Interface System encompasses three primary components. The Andrew User Environment (AUE) contains the main editor, help system, user interface, and tools for rendering multimedia and embedded objects. The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) contains all of the formattable and embeddable objects, and allows a method for developers to design their own objects. ATK allows for multi-level object embedding, in which objects can be embedded in one another. For example, a raster image object can be embedded into a spreadsheet object. The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a mail and bulletin board access, which allows the user to send, receive, and organize mail as well as post and read from message boards.

As of version 6.3, the following were components of AUIS:

===Applications===
* Word processor (EZ)
* Drawing Editor (Figure)
* Mail and News Reader (Messages)
* Mail and News Sender (SendMessage)
* Font Editor (BDFfont)
* Documentation Browser (Help)
* Directory Browser (Bush)
* Schedule Maintainer (Chump)
* Shell Interface/Terminal (Console, TypeScript)
* AUIS Application Menu (Launch)
* Standard Output Viewer (PipeScript)
* Preferences Editor (PrefEd)

===Graphical and interactive editors===
* Equation Insert (EQ)
* Animation Editor (Fad)
* Drawing Editor (Figure)
* Insert Layout Insert (Layout)
* Display Two Adjacent Inserts (LSet)
* Extension and String Processing Language (Ness)
* Display and Edit Hierarchies (Org)
* Page Flipper (Page)
* Monochrome BMP Image Editor (Raster)
* Spreadsheet Insert (Table)
* Text, Document, and Program Editor (Text)

==Wireless Andrew==

Wireless Andrew was the first campus-wide wireless Internet network. It was built in 1993, predating Wi-Fi branding.

Wireless Andrew is a 2-megabit-per-second wireless local area network connected through access points to the wired Andrew network, a high-speed Ethernet backbone linking buildings across the CMU campus. Wireless Andrew consists of 100 access points covering six buildings on the campus. The university tested the setup with over 40 mobile units before allowing general use by researchers and students in February 1997.

<doc id="507827" wikidata="Q188887" url="?curid=507827" title="List of cities in Portugal">
<text>This is a list of cities in Portugal. In Portugal, a city () is an honorific term given to locations that meet several criteria, such as having a minimum number of inhabitants good infrastructure (schools, medical care, cultural and sports facilities), or have a major historical importance. The country&#x27;s demographic expansion of the 1980s prompted the elevation of several towns to city status and, as of 2018, 159 locations in Portugal are considered a city.
==Overview==
In Portugal, the city is not an administrative division, therefore a city generally does not necessarily correspond to a municipality, which is the second-level local government in the country. Some entirely urban municipalities do coincide with cities, such as Lisbon, Porto, Funchal, Amadora, Entroncamento, and São João da Madeira.

The municipality with the most cities is Paredes Municipality, which contains four cities.

Until 1910, a location was proclaimed city by royal charter (&quot;carta régia&quot;), which happened 25 times to current Portuguese cities (royal charters were also granted to cities of the Portuguese Empire; for example, São Paulo in 1711). During the Portuguese First Republic, the process was transferred to the parliament, which elevated three towns to the category of city. The dictatorial &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime proclaimed seven cities on the Portuguese mainland (as well as some more in the colonies), this time by government decree. After the 1974 Carnation Revolution, proclamation of cities returned to parliament and now, Portugal has 156 cities, one of the consequences being that the title no longer holds the prestige it once had.

Eight locations have been always considered cities since Portugal became an independent kingdom (&quot;de facto&quot; 1128): Braga, Coimbra, Lamego, Porto and Viseu, as well as Évora, Lisbon and Silves, which were annexed at a later date.
Guarda was the first city proclaimed as part of the independent kingdom, in 1199.

== City designation ==
In Portugal, a locality can only be called a city if more than 8,000 inhabitants live in the city&#x27;s urban area. In addition, at least half of the following infrastructure must be present:

* Hospital
* Pharmacy
* Fire department
* Event center and cultural center
* Museum and library
* Hotel
* Primary and secondary school
* Pre-school and kindergarten
* Public transportation
* Garden or public park

=== Cities being towns ===
In Portugal there are localities with more than 8,000 inhabitants and with the required infrastructure installed, but not having the designation of &quot;city&quot;, but rather as &quot;town&quot;, for example:

* Algueirão-Mem Martins
* Corroios
* Rio de Mouro
* Cascais
* Sintra

=== Towns being cities ===
Just as there are &quot;cities&quot; being &quot;towns&quot;, there are also &quot;towns&quot; being &quot;cities&quot;, because they have the required infrastructure in place, but have no more than 8,000 inhabitants or because since the locality received the designation &quot;city&quot; it has lost over the years the 8,000 inhabitants, for example:

* Miranda do Douro
* Santana
* Sabugal
* Peso da Régua
* Reguengos de Monsaraz

== Metropolitan areas ==
Portugal&#x27;s two metropolitan areas, Lisbon with over 2.8 million inhabitants and Porto with over 1.7 million inhabitants, are the largest agglomerations in the country. In the two metropolitan areas, in addition to the large cities of Lisbon and Porto, there are other cities that together form the metropolitan area.

The Lisbon Metropolitan Area consists of the large city of Lisbon, but also the cities of Amadora, Queluz, Agualva-Cacém, etc.

The Porto Metropolitan Area is made up of the large city of Porto, but also the cities of Vila Nova de Gaia, Gondomar, Rio Tinto, Póvoa de Varzim, Matosinhos, etc.

== Large cities outside metropolitan areas ==
There are also large cities in Portugal that do not belong to any metropolitan area. These cities are mostly capitals of sub-regions that are not considered metropolitan areas because the population is mainly located in the capital of the sub-region.

The city of Braga is the capital of the sub-region of Cávado.

The city of Funchal is the capital of the autonomous region of Madeira.

The city of Coimbra is the capital of the sub-region Região de Coimbra.

== Urban areas ==
The following list shows the number of inhabitants and the population density of each respective city. Only the inhabitants living in the urban area are counted, not the inhabitants living in the entire municipality.

In the case of large cities like Vila Nova de Gaia, Braga, Coimbra and Setubal, the inhabitants of the entire municipality are not listed, because the municipality does not only include the city, but also other towns and villages around the city, which nevertheless belong to the municipality, but form a separate parish and therefore do not belong to the respective city.

In the case of large cities like Lisbon, Porto, Amadora and Funchal, the inhabitants of the entire municipality are listed because the city spreads over the entire municipality and the respective parishes within the municipality are seen as &quot;neighborhoods&quot;.

Cities with an &quot;italic&quot; font are capitals of subregions, cities with a bold font are capitals of regions.

<text>The shortleaf pine or Pinus echinata is a species of coniferous tree endemic to the United States. The shortleaf pine is sometimes referred to as the &quot;old field&quot;, &quot;spruce&quot;, &quot;rosemary&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;two-leaf&quot; and &quot;heart&quot; pine. The common name &quot;shortleaf pine&quot; may refer to other species like loblolly pine (&quot;Pinus taeda&quot;), based on a custom in the Southeastern United States to only refer to pines as either &quot;long-leaf&quot; or &quot;short-leaf&quot;. However, &quot;P. echinata&quot; can be distinguished from other pines by examining its short leaves and small cones.

==Description==
The tree is variable in form, sometimes straight, sometimes crooked, with an irregular crown. The tree reaches heights of . In areas that have optimal growing conditions, the height reached is between . The trunk diameter ranges between and averages between .

The leaves are needle-like, in fascicles (bundles) of two and three mixed together, and from long. The cones are long, with thin scales with a transverse keel and a short prickle. They open at maturity but are persistent. Shortleaf pine seedlings develop a persistent J-shaped crook near the ground surface. Axillary and other buds form near the crook and initiate growth if the upper stem is killed by fire or is severed.

The bark has resin pockets (sometimes called pitch patches), which form small depressions, less than in diameter. This feature can be used to distinguish &quot;P. echinata&quot; from all other &quot;Pinus&quot; species within its native range. For example, the bark of a loblolly tree is slightly darker, thicker, and more furrowed and rigged in comparison to the shortleaf pine at the beginning of its lifespan, but when it starts maturing these differences fade; however, the resin pockets are still visible on shortleaf pine and can used for identification.

The crown is a pyramidal head that contains several small branches. It does not change much throughout the tree&#x27;s lifetime.

The tree has very strong roots, and thus it is able to withstand high winds; additionally, the tree can survive in very dry conditions. The roots are able to reach great depths to search for water. It is believed the roots are this long due to the wide range of the species that consequently experiences varying climate.

Shortleaf pine can be found in a variety of soils including, stiff clay, gravel, and sand. Although the species is not soil-specific, they do not thrive in wet or very poorly drained conditions.

== Taxonomy ==
The shortleaf pine is in the &quot;Pinus&quot; subgenus. The epithet of &quot;echinata&quot; means &quot;spiny&quot; and refers to &quot;hedgehog&quot;, from &quot;echinus&quot;. It naturally hybridizes with &quot;Pinus taeda;&quot; the hybrid typically has a closer resemblance to &quot;P. echinata&quot;. It was named by Phillip Miller, and the date of publication was April 16, 1768.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Shortleaf pine has the largest range of the southern US yellow pines. It is found from southernmost New York, south to northern Florida, west to eastern Texas and Oklahoma. This pine occupies a variety of habitats from rocky uplands to wet flood plains.

Since the shortleaf pine has such a large range, it can use many different soils. Most shortleaf pines grow in soils that have low organic matter in subsurface horizons and are relatively moist. The shortleaf pine grows in altitudes of up to 3,000 feet in the Southern Appalachians.

There are 85 different forest types that the shortleaf pine is a component, spanning 22 states in the U.S. Generally speaking, the volume of shortleaf pines has decreased over time across the U.S.

== Ecology ==
The shortleaf pine occurs in various habitats such as hardwood forests and open woodlands. The soils, geology, hydrology, and interaction with fire all influence the community structure of the species. It is able to grow in several different hydrological gradients, including sand hills, sandstone hills, and slopes. It occurs in rolling uplands and mesic lowlands. It also occurs in several different forest types; these forest types depend on the classification scheme. According to the Society of American Foresters, the shortleaf pine is found in eighteen different forest cover types and sixty NatureServe plant communities.

Fire plays a key role in shortleaf pines ecology, fire influences their maintenance, structure, composition, regeneration, and establishment. Fire reduces competition with different tree species which increases shortleaf pine survival, and it also prepares the soil for regeneration. Shortleaf pine typically respond well to prescribed fire. With frequent fire, the species can occur in savanna environments, with a very diverse understory and prime habitat for the red-cockaded woodpecker.

The tree frequently hybridizes naturally with loblolly pine and pitch pine where their ranges intersect. Hybridization with loblolly pine has become increasingly frequent in recent decades and results in hybrids with lower fire tolerance.

== Uses ==
Shortleaf pine is a source of wood pulp, plywood veneer, and lumber for a variety of uses. The shortleaf pine is one of the southern US &quot;southern yellow pines&quot;; it is also occasionally called southern yellow pine or the shortstraw pine. The wood from the shortleaf pine is used commercially for creating flooring and beams. In the past, it was used in building ship masts, and during the Revolutionary War and into the 1800s, it was a major timber source for homes. The shortleaf pine is famous for lightwood, also known as fat wood: a resinous wood that is well known for lighting fires. A strong fire with this wood only requires a kitchen match.

The turpentine that is found in the resin of the tree can be used for treatment of the kidney and bladder. It can be used for treating rheumatic infections as a rub or steam bath; it can also be used internally. It has proven useful for treating respiratory illnesses, such as influenza, coughs, colds, and TB. It can also be used dermally for burns, sores, wounds, and boils.

== Conservation ==
There has been a 53% decline of the shortleaf pine since 1980 due to a lack of disturbance required for regeneration of the species, and impacts of farming and extensive logging. Fire exclusion, land conversion, and land development have negative impacts on shortleaf pine.

The Shortleaf Pine Initiative (SPI) was launched in the spring of 2013 to help combat this issue. SPI is composed of state and federal agencies, as well as public and private organizations. There was a range-wide conservation plan released in June 2016 that aimed to increase coordination with shortleaf proponents and maximize current conservation strategies to optimize restoration strategies. This plan has a primary focus on restoring woodlands that were either dominated or co-dominated by shortleaf pines in the past. It is intended to be utilized by natural resource managers, wildlife and conservation biologists, and foresters, as well as policymakers and landowners.

According to NatureServe, the &quot;Pinus echinata&quot; conservation status is &quot;critically imperiled&quot; in New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois. Conversely, it is &quot;secure&quot; in North Carolina and Virginia.

== Genetics ==
The shortleaf pine is a diploid organism that has twelve pairs of chromosomes. The genome of the shortleaf is comparatively similar to that of other pine species. The C value of the shortleaf pine, or the amount of DNA of a species chromosome, is 21.73 pg when measured utilizing laser flow cytometry.

The genome of the shortleaf pine is not sequenced; however, loblolly pine genomic information can be used in comparative genetic studies regarding the shortleaf pine.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) launched a genetic improvement program in the 1960s that aimed to increase the genetic diversity of the species, which is crucial for effective restoration of the species, by breeding trees and conducting progeny tests. This program posed inadvertent effects, as it opened the opportunity of crossbreeding with the loblolly pine. Fast growth is a desirable trait among trees, and this is usually a characteristic of hybrid trees; in turn, breeders are inclined to select these traits. Shortleaf pine orchards are also often adjacent to loblolly pine orchards, which could cause hybrid breeding to occur as well.

<text>Wilhelm Fried Fuchs (; January 1, 1879 – May 8, 1952), commonly known as William Fox, was a Hungarian-American film industry executive who founded the Fox Film Corporation in 1915 and the Fox West Coast Theatres chain in the 1920s. Although he lost control of his film businesses in 1930, his name was used by 20th Century Fox (now part of the Walt Disney Company) and continues to be used in the trademarks of the present-day Fox Corporation, including the Fox Broadcasting Company, Fox News, Fox Sports and Foxtel.

==Early life==
Wilhelm Fried Fuchs (later William Fox) was born in Tolcsva, Hungary. His parents, Michael Fuchs and Anna Fried, were both Hungarian Jews. The family immigrated to the United States when William was nine months old and settled in New York City, where they had twelve more children, of whom only six survived. To help the family financially William found a job selling candy and newspapers in Central Park. At the age of eight, he fell off the back of an ice truck, breaking his left arm. This accident left him with a permanent impairment. He also found employment in the garment industry.

==Film career==
In 1900, Fox started his own company, which he sold in 1904 to purchase his first nickelodeon. Always more of an entrepreneur than a showman, he concentrated on acquiring and building theaters. Following the purchase of his first nickelodeon, Fox would then use it to create a chain of movie theaters and purchase film prints from major film companies at the time such as Biograph, Essanay, Kalem, Lubin, Pathé, Selig, and Vitagraph. In 1910, Fox managed to successfully lease the New York Academy of Music and convert it into a movie theater. He also continued to focus his concentration in New York and New Jersey. Beginning in 1914, New Jersey–based Fox bought films outright from the Balboa Amusement Producing Company in Long Beach, California, for distribution to his own theaters and then for rental to other theaters across the country. He formed the Fox Film Corporation on February 1, 1915, with insurance and banking money provided by the McCarter, Kuser and Usar families of Newark, New Jersey, and the small New Jersey investment house of Eisele and King. The company&#x27;s first film studio was leased in Fort Lee, New Jersey, where many other early film studios were based at the beginning of the 20th century. He now had the capital to acquire facilities and expand his production capacity. Between 1915 and 1919, Fox would rake in millions of dollars through films which featured Fox Film&#x27;s first breakout star Theda Bara, known as &quot;The Vamp&quot;, for her performance in &quot;A Fool There Was&quot; (1915), based on the 1909 Broadway production &quot;A Fool There Was&quot; by Porter Emerson Browne, in turn based on Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem &quot;The Vampire&quot;, in turn inspired by Philip Burne-Jones&#x27;s painting, &quot;The Vampire&quot; (1897), modelled by Mrs Patrick Campbell, Burne-Jones&#x27; lover and George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;second famed platonic love affair&quot;. He would also sign lead Western actor Tom Mix to his company in 1917, with the move significantly boosting Mix&#x27;s popularity.

In 1925–1926, Fox purchased the rights to the work of Freeman Harrison Owens, the U.S. rights to the Tri-Ergon system invented by three German inventors (Josef Engl (1893–1942), Hans Vogt (1890–1979), and Joseph Massolle (1889–1957)), and the work of Theodore Case to create the Fox Movietone sound-on-film system, introduced in 1927 with the release of F. W. Murnau&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Sound-on-film systems such as Movietone and RCA Photophone soon became the standard, and competing sound-on-disc technologies, such as Warner Bros.&#x27; Vitaphone, became obsolete. From 1928 to 1964, Fox Movietone News was one of the major newsreel series in the U.S., along with &quot;The March of Time&quot; (1935–1951) and Universal Newsreel (1929–1967). Despite the fact that his film studio was based in Hollywood, Fox opted to instead remain in New York and was more familiar with his financiers than with either his movie makers or movie stars. Prominent Fox Film Corporation actress Janet Gaynor even acknowledged that she barely knew William Fox, stating &quot;I only met him to say how do you do.&quot; Gaynor also stated that Fox would rarely visit the Fox studio in Hollywood she frequently worked in when she worked with Fox&#x27;s company and that his movies were mainly managed by his movie makers.

Following the 1927 death of Marcus Loew, head of Loews Incorporated, the parent company of rival studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, control of MGM passed to his longtime associate, Nicholas Schenck. Fox saw an opportunity to expand his empire, and in 1929, with Schenck&#x27;s assent, bought the Loew family&#x27;s MGM holdings, unbeknownst to MGM studio bosses Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg. Mayer and Thalberg were outraged; despite their high posts at MGM, they were not shareholders. Mayer used his strong political connections to persuade the Justice Department to sue Fox for violating federal antitrust laws. In July 1929, Fox was severely injured in an automobile accident. By the time he recovered, the stock market crash in October 1929 had wiped out virtually his entire fortune, ending any chance of the Loews-Fox merger going through even if the Justice Department had approved it.

Fox lost control of his organization in 1930 during a hostile takeover. In 1935, Fox Film Corporation would merge with 20th Century Pictures, becoming 20th Century-Fox. William Fox was never connected with the ownership, production or management of the movie studio that famously bore his name. A combination of the stock market crash, Fox&#x27;s car accident injuries, and government antitrust action, forced him into a protracted seven-year legal battle to stave off bankruptcy. At his bankruptcy hearing in 1936, he attempted to bribe judge John Warren Davis and committed perjury. In 1943, Fox served a five-month and seventeen day prison sentence on charges of conspiring to obstruct justice and defraud the United States, in connection with his bankruptcy. Years after his prison release, U.S. President Harry Truman would grant Fox a Presidential pardon.

For many years, Fox resented the way that Wall Street had forced him from control of his company. In 1933, he collaborated with the writer Upton Sinclair on a book &quot;Upton Sinclair Presents William Fox&quot; in which Fox recounted his life, and stating his views on what he considered to be a large Wall Street conspiracy against him.

Fox died in 1952 at the age of 73. His death went largely unnoticed by the film industry; no one from Hollywood attended his funeral. He is interred at Salem Fields Cemetery, Brooklyn.

Fox personally oversaw the construction of many Fox Theatres in American cities including Atlanta, St Louis, Detroit, Portland, Oakland, San Francisco and San Diego.

His companies had an estimated value of $300,000,000 and he personally owned 53 percent of Fox Film and 93 percent of the Fox Theaters.

==Personal life==
Fox was married to Eva Leo (1881–1962) and had two daughters.

<text>Repton School is a 13–18 co-educational, private, boarding and day school in the public school tradition, in Repton, Derbyshire, England.

Sir John Port of Etwall, on his death in 1557, left funds to create a grammar school which was then established at the Repton Priory. For its first 400 years, the school accepted only boys; girls were admitted from the 1970s, and the school was fully co-educational by the 1990s.

Notable alumni, also known as &quot;Old Reptonians&quot;, include C. B. Fry, Harold Abrahams,Christopher Isherwood, Jeremy Clarkson, Andy Wilman, Roald Dahl, Adrian Newey and Archbishop Lord Ramsey of Canterbury.

== History ==

The school was founded by a 1557 legacy in the will of Sir John Port of Etwall, leaving funds for a grammar school at Etwall or Repton, conditional on the students praying daily for the souls of his family: 
Through this private endowment, Repton School was set up as a charity, with early boarding pupils coming from Repton and the neighbouring villages.

The social mix of the early school was very broad. Among the first twenty-two names on the register of Repton there are five gentlemen, four husbandmen, nine yeomen, two websters, or weavers, a carpenter and a tanner. During the 17th century, the school educated the sons of Earl of Chesterfield and Earl of Ardglass, Samuel Shaw and John Woodward, who was apprenticed as a linen draper before he took up medicine, eventually being appointed Gresham Professor of Physic.

Buildings at the site of Repton Priory were granted for the school in 1559 by Gilbert Thacker. Not long after this, relations between the school and the Thacker family began to deteriorate due to a conflict of interest in accessibility. In 1642, the school commenced an action against the Thacker family, and, in 1670, a wall was built to keep the two parties apart. 

Within the first hundred years, student body numbers rose to 200, but they had fallen by 1681 to twenty-eight boys.

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
In a letter from George Denman in the 1830s, there was a pupil-conferred role called &quot;Cock of the School&quot;. A boy would be identified as the holder of this office after competing against likely candidates; once a boy was incumbent in this role, the younger boys deferred to him to do his work; writing in 1907, G. S. Messiter described the practice as an &quot;ancient custom.&quot;

In 1858, a chapel was constructed on campus and later opened in 1859.

In 1865, a commission presided over by Henry Labouchere, 1st Baron Taunton investigated all endowed secondary schools in England, including Repton. The Schools Inquiry Commission published its findings in 1868. The research compiled helped aid the Endowed Schools Act 1869.

When public schools were attempting to reform, Repton&#x27;s headmaster at the time lamented the shared tensions from all schools between local boys and boarders, stating that despite a sincere attempt to break down the barriers between them, he had had little success, and a substantial number of applications from &quot;persons of good standing... and good fortune&quot; had been withdrawn when told the boys were &quot;of all classes down to the sons of blacksmiths and washerwomen&quot;. Due to this conflict, local village boys stopped attending Repton, which the headmaster at the time said was &quot;mainly for the sake of the village boys... [to mitigate a] constant fear of their being ill-treated.&quot;
The first Committee of the Headmasters&#x27; Conference, appointed in December 1870, included the headmaster of Repton.

=== 20th century ===

In 1907, a gymnasium was added, which is now grade II listed. In this decade, the chapel was enlarged, the Science Block, Armoury, Shooting Range and Swimming Bath were built, and the Priory &#x27;Tithe&#x27; Barn turned into the Art School.

Geoffrey Fisher (later to become Archbishop of Canterbury) became headmaster in 1914. In the early 1900s, a reforming master, Victor Gollancz, established classes in political education for the boys. The classes were open to Upper School members and enlistment was voluntary. Gollancz and D. C. Somervell conducted the lessons on “topics of parliamentary reform, the position of women, the future of the Empire, trade unions, individualism and co-operation in industry, the organisation of peace and a League of Nations, conservatism, liberalism, modern Ireland, Alsace-Lorraine and the Russian Revolution.” Repton was considered one of the first schools to offer civics classes in its curriculum. However, certain staff members opposed these classes, considering them as being radical. When H. J. Snape was invited to address the Civics Class on conservatism, the tension between Gollancz and Snape&#x27;s opposing beliefs led to a “flaming row between them.” As a result of the affair, the War Office considered withdrawing its recognition of Repton&#x27;s school Corps. This led to Fisher dismissing Gollancz and retaining Snape; yet, Fisher blamed Snape&#x27;s misconduct as “a very discreditable campaign of personal abuse and violent language…against Mr. Gollancz.”

1,912 former pupils of the school served in the First World War, of whom 355 died in service. A war memorial was unveiled on major general Sir John Burnett-Stuart, director of military operations and intelligence, and dedicated by Edwyn Hoskyns, Bishop of Southwell on 1 November 1922.

 Harold Abrahams, winner of the 100m sprint in the 1924 Paris Olympics, joined the school in 1914. Recalling his time at the school, Abrahams said he encountered antisemitism from other boys, often feeling bullied and alone.

In 1917, the writers Christopher Isherwood and Edward Upward began their time at Repton. They formed a friendship which continued when they both attended Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Around the same time, Arnold Cooke, Bunny Austin and David Cochrane also attended Repton.

In September 1920, the poet Vernon Watkins was sent to Repton. His gentle character initially provoked bullying in his early years; yet, in a 1923 letter sent from Watkins to Eric Falk, he expressed his fondness for Repton as well as a school crush on poet Rupert Brooke: “I can’t think of anyone except Rupert Brooke.” Upward reflected that “everyone was homosexual, up to a point, at Repton.” While at the school, Watkins was granted the Howe Verse Prize, the Lancelot Sayes Prizes for French &amp; German, and the Schreiber Prize for his writing. Upon his departure, Watkins stated: “Leaving Repton was what I had expected it to be; - a ghastly affair which left me in tears.” The school has claimed him as &quot;perhaps the best poet Repton has had&quot;.

In 1924, George Gilbert Stocks, a director of music at the school, set the hymn &quot;Dear Lord and Father of Mankind&quot; to the tune &quot;Repton&quot; for use in the school&#x27;s chapel. He took the melody from Hubert Parry&#x27;s 1888 contralto aria &quot;Long since in Egypt&#x27;s plenteous land&quot; in his oratorio &quot;Judith&quot;.

The writer Roald Dahl attended in the 1930s.He later stated that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t get over it&quot; and has &quot;never got over it.&quot; His semi-autobiographical &quot;Boy&quot; describes his negative experience with physical altercations between students, and of a pupil by headmaster Fisher. But Dahl&#x27;s biographer, Jeremy Treglown, has pointed out he was mistaken: the beating was in May 1933, a year after Fisher had left Repton, and the headmaster concerned was John Christie, Fisher&#x27;s successor. In his 1984 autobiography, Dahl states that when he was a young fag, he was instructed to warm toilet seats for older boys at the school. He was also, along with other boys at the school, used as a product tester for Cadbury chocolate bars. Dahl claims that this was the inspiration for his book, &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;.
==== Second World War and after ====
The headmaster from 1937 to 1943 was H. G. Michael Clarke, who left the school to pursue an ecclesiastical career and became Provost of Birmingham Cathedral. He led the school during one of the most difficult periods of its history, when mounting debts and falling numbers, together with the effects of the war, led to questions as to the continuing viability of the institution; Clarke was obliged to close departments and two houses (The Cross and Latham). The school owed £50,000 (around £3.5 million at today&#x27;s prices) and, in 1941, the Board of Education said its &quot;future is doubtful&quot;.

In the Second World War, 188 former members of the school died serving in the armed forces. Airmen were billeted in Mitre House during the war. In 1948, a tablet extension was commissioned for the Derbyshire WWI Memorial in order to include WWII casualties. The extension was inaugurated in a ceremony led on 10 July 1949, unveiled by lieutenant general Sir Charles Gairdner and dedicated by former Geoffrey Fisher, by then Archbishop of Canterbury.

Numbers attending the school recovered in the late 1940s, such that The Cross was able to reopen in 1945 and Latham House in 1947. By 1957, the school was in better health: full with 470 pupils.

1957 saw the 400 year centenary of the school, celebrated with a royal visit from Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. A new chemistry block and workshops were added within the precinct, as well as extensive alterations to the science block. John Gammell took office as headmaster in 1968 and during his tenure girls began to be educated at Repton. It started with the arrival of two girls in 1970. By 1979, the first purpose-built girls&#x27; boarding house was opened.

Hazing is recorded as having taken place at Repton into the late 20th century. Jeremy Clarkson attended the school, later noting that he had suffered extreme hazing by other students, including being plunged into an ice pool and having his trousers cut in half. He was later expelled for &quot;drinking, smoking and generally making a nuisance&quot; of himself. He has stated that this conduct included doing car stunts on the sports pitches, smoking in the chapel, filling all the locks on the premises with Polyfilla, and attending lessons naked from the waist down.

Likewise, fagging continued in the 1980s when cricketer Chris Adams was at the school; he subsequently observed, &quot;The ingrained hierarchy whereby the older boys would subject the younger pupils to a lot of misery through the system of fagging. It was basically a system of slavery and I hated seeing the young lads literally trembling with fear&quot;.

In the early 1980s, the old Sanatorium was converted into a Music School. Due to increasing numbers of female pupils in the 1990s, headmaster Graham Jones spearheaded the construction of girls&#x27; houses. Two boys boarding houses (Brook House and The Hall) were closed and their occupants were reconfigured into a single new house, School House.

=== 21st century ===

The school marked its 450th anniversary in 2007 with a royal visit from Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. Celebrations also included concerts featuring Michael Ball and Bryan Ferry.

In 2011, the 400 Hall theatre (originally built in 1957) was remodelled by Avery Associates Architects, following a £3.3 million upgrade. In 2013, a £9 million science block was built. During the preparations for the building work, archaeological digs were undertaken which indicated the site had been occupied in the Roman period. Around this time, the old Squash Courts were made into a new gallery and textiles studio for the Art department.

A new teaching block, the Lynam Thomas Building, in the precinct and a major refurbishment programme was being undertaken. In November 2019, Adam Peaty opened a newly redeveloped £6 million sports centre at the school. The sport centre building has since been nominated for Excellence in Design by the East Midlands Bricks Awards.

Alastair Land was headmaster from 2016 to 2019 and was succeeded as headmaster by Mark Semmence.

In September 2019, the school began using an AI service called AS Tracking in order to monitor students&#x27; mental health. The software was also used in 150 schools, assessing over 50,000 students&#x27; wellbeing. In November 2019, Libby Lane, Lord Bishop of Derby was appointed visitor of Repton School.

== Co-curricular ==
The school has a Combined Cadet Force and a music school, as well as various after-school clubs. All pupils are enrolled in CCF for one year; involvement thereafter is voluntary. Pupils can also choose to participate in the Duke of Edinburgh Award.

=== Sports ===
The school competes in various sports. Main sports are: men&#x27;s football, hockey and cricket; women&#x27;s hockey, netball and tennis. Repton School has produced more than 150 first-class cricketers, 11 internationals, and three Test captains. Notable sporting former pupils include the 1932 Wimbledon tennis finalist, Bunny Austin, and several first-class cricketers. The Olympic gold medalist and world record holder Adam Peaty used Repton&#x27;s swimming pool as a training facility. His coach, Melanie Marshall, taught swimming at the school.

In 2013, six former pupils played together in an international hockey match.

In October 2018, Repton announced a complete £6 million renovation of the school&#x27;s sporting facilities, including a new sports hall and a new strength and conditioning gymnasium. Repton&#x27;s football team also won The 2018 ISFA Barry Burns Northern Eights Competition.

In January 2019, Repton announced Chris Read, former England cricketer, as the school&#x27;s director of cricket. In 2019, the first all-girls Lord&#x27;s Taverners &quot;Wicketz Festival&quot;, three days of celebration, education and cricket was held at the school. The U18 girls (outdoor), U16 girls (outdoor and indoor), U16 boys (outdoor) and U14 girls (outdoor) won national titles that same year.

In February 2020, Repton announced Scott Talbot, former Olympian and coach for the New Zealand and Australian national swim squads, as the school&#x27;s director of swimming.

=== Fine arts ===
Repton&#x27;s art programme currently features two artists-in-residence: visual artist Louisa Chambers and fine art media specialist Maria Georgoula.

Repton opened their 400 Hall theatre in 1957. In 2011, the theatre reopened after a £3.3 million renovation. A studio theatre was added in 2003 and the complex extended and fully refurbished in 2011 by architect Bryan Avery.

The school has been hosting a literary festival in October for some years. There is an annual Plowright lecture, with the 2020 lecture being on serial killers. One of the students won Ayn Rand Essay Competition prizes in consecutive years. In 2022, this event was branded &quot;a flop&quot;, with organisers stating &quot;audience for many of the speakers were woefully small...Everywhere was completely thin. It was such a shame&quot;.

The school&#x27;s theatre was used for various performances during a time of closure of a theatre space in the Derby Guildhall, operated by the local authority in Derby.

== Houses and pastoral arrangements ==
Repton School offers traditional boarding only, with no flexi or weekly options available. Approximately 70 per cent of pupils are boarders.

The school also has an on-site tuck shop called &#x27;The Grubber&#x27;.

== Fees and inspection ==
In 2019/2020, fees were £36,783 for boarders and £27,207 for day pupils per year.

There are scholarships available for drama, sport, art, music, academic capacity and &quot;all-rounder talent&quot;; these do not exceed 20% of the school&#x27;s fees. There is also some bursary assistance.

The school is inspected by the Independent Schools Inspectorate. An integrated inspection took place in March 2014, finding the school to be &quot;exceptionally successful in achieving its aims... the quality of the pupils&#x27; achievements is excellent&quot;.

An emergency inspection in January 2015 was ordered by the Department for Education reviewing welfare and safeguarding compliance under the Independent School Standard Regulations (ISSRs) and the National Minimum Standards for Boarding (NMSB). The school failed to meet a number of the regulations, namely those dealing with pupil safeguarding; the promotion of good behaviour; suitability of staff and governance, leadership and management of the school.

A regulatory compliance inspection took place in 2018 which found that the school met all of the minimums and associated requirements. The subsequent integrated regulatory compliance and educational quality inspection in 2020 found that Repton met all regulatory compliance standards and was awarded the highest rating in each area.

== The old priory ==
Repton Priory was a 12th-century Augustinian foundation. It was dissolved in 1538. After dissolution, the Thacker family lived at the priory until 1553. One of this family, Gilbert Thacker, destroyed the church, almost entirely in a day; he did this during the time of Queen Mary, fearing the priory would be recommissioned as part of the Counter-Reformation.Only parts of the original buildings remained when the school was established. These comprised: the footings of areas of the priory remain in some areas, uncovered during construction work in 1922; the bases of a cluster of columns of the former chancel and chapels; fragments of an arch belonging to the former pulpitum, moved to their current position in 1906; fragments of the door surrounds of both the chapter house and warming room. and largest surviving portion of the priory known as &quot;Prior Overton&#x27;s Tower&quot;, which is post-1437; largely altered, it has been incorporated into a 19th-century building.

== Affiliate schools ==
The school set up Repton International Schools Ltd (RISL) in 2013 to establish, develop and maintain British international schools. The overseas schools are owned and funded by local investors, which can be education businesses, real estate corporates, private equity firms or wealthy philanthropists. They are licensed to use the Repton School &quot;brand&quot; and enter into a services agreement with RISL, which provides a full range of educational services and academic oversight. RISL remits its profits to Repton School Trust in the UK, which helps fund capital projects and bursaries. Repton has partnerships with John Port Spencer Academy, Etwall, and Repton Primary School.

The portfolio of overseas schools comprises:
*Repton School Dubai (opened in September 2007), situated on a site in Nad al Sheba
* Repton School Abu Dhabi, which has two campuses on Al Reem Island, Abu Dhabi (2013 and 2017)
* Foremarke Dubai (2013), located in Al Barsha South and recently re-branded as Repton Al Barsha
* Repton International School (Malaysia) (2020)
* Chiway-Repton School, located in Xiamen, Fujian Province, PRC (2020)
* Repton Cairo opened in September 2020 as part of the Mivida development in New Cairo 
* Repton Doha will open in 2021, with Repton New Giza and Repton Sofia to follow in 2023

=== Preparatory school ===
Repton has a junior school, named Repton Prep, which was founded in 1940.

In early 2020, it was announced that Repton School would be merging with Foremarke Hall School from September 2020 into a single school called Repton Prep. Shortly after, St Wystan&#x27;s School joined the Repton group of schools.

== Culture and cultural references ==
Alexander Wilson, novelist, a spy and serial bigamist with four wives, lied about being an alumnus of Repton School, which he was not; Fred Perry also lied about having attended Repton School, which he did not do either.

The &quot;Stig&quot; character in Top Gear is said to have been named after the school&#x27;s pejorative slang term for new boys, a private reference with the producer Andy Wilman, who attended Repton with Clarkson.There is also a steam locomotive called &quot;Repton&quot; named after the school in 1934: Southern Rail, class V, Schools No 926, today based at the North Yorkshire Moors Railway.

The school&#x27;s motto, (&quot;the gate is free from blame&quot;), is a quotation from Ovid&#x27;s . &quot;The gate&quot; () refers to the school&#x27;s arch and, by a synecdoche of , the school itself, whilst also being a pun on the name of the school&#x27;s founder, Sir John Port.

The school has twice, in the 1930s and 1980s respectively, represented the fictional Brookfield School in a 1939 film and a 1984 BBC version of &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips.&quot; One of the screenwriters of the 1939 film, Eric Maschwitz, attended Repton. Around 200 pupils were extras in the 1939 film. Similarly, pupils appeared as extras in the 1984 BBC version.

=== Royal visits ===
The school has had the following royal visits:

* The Queen and Prince Philip made an official visit to the school on 28 March 1957, to mark the 400 year anniversary of the school&#x27;s establishment. The welcome was led by former headmaster Geoffrey Fisher and the Queen planted a mulberry tree.
* The Duchess of Kent visited the school in June 1985.

== Controversies ==
=== Fee fixing and gender pay gap ===
See also: Gender inequality in the United Kingdom and Gender pay gap

In September 2005, the school was one of fifty schools operating independent school fee-fixing, in breach of the Competition Act, 1998. All of the schools involved were ordered to abandon this practice, pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 each and to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information had been shared. The Bursar at the time was Carl Bilson.

Female staff members were paid 56–57% less than their male coworkers at the school in 2018, and 50% less in 2019.

=== Incidents ===
In 2014, Southern Derbyshire Magistrates&#x27; Court fined the school £10,000 following a guilty plea to a health and safety charge after an incident of negligence. In April 2019, a teacher tested positive for drink-driving after police saw his vehicle mount a kerb and then enter the school grounds. He was subsequently convicted and banned from driving for 20 months. Two months later a chemical spillage at the school&#x27;s sports centre resulted in nine individuals needing precautionary treatment, as a result of a chlorine leak.

In the summer of 2023, a 14-year-old girl died on the school campus at an event organised by Christians in Sport, a third-party religious group.

=== Sexual abuse ===
The Charity Commission expressed &quot;serious concerns&quot; about safeguarding in 2018 after it received a sequence of serious incident reports from Repton School early in that year, specifically:

* In December 2014, a former head of physics, John Mitchell, was found to have abused a position of trust contrary to s.16(1)(a) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 when he engaged in sexual activity with a female between the age of 13 and 17, not believing that she was 18 or over. He also communicated in a sexual way and with sexual motivations to this same pupil. He was disqualified from teaching indefinitely by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, following a finding that this was unacceptable professional conduct.
* In October 2017, a former pupil began proceedings against the school, claiming negligence on the school&#x27;s part, in connection with an alleged rape of that pupil by another pupil in 2014. A 17-year-old pupil was arrested on suspicion of carrying out two rapes at the school; it was claimed that the school failed to supervise or discipline its pupil. The claimant made a request of the Derbyshire Constabulary for the papers from its investigation, which the police refused to provide without a court order.
* In 2018, four members of the school&#x27;s staff were subject to police investigation for inappropriate sexual conduct towards children. In August 2018, one of these individuals, Jeremy Woodside, a 28-year-old former organist at the school, was placed on the Sex Offender&#x27;s Register. The chronology of those issues emerging in early 2018 was as follows:
** On 29 January 2018, police arrested a member of staff on suspicion of attempting sexual contact with a child
** On 14 March 2018, a second police investigation into a staff member, relating to safeguarding concerns, was launched
** On 26 March 2018, allegations against a further two members of staff were reported
* In February 2022, a former teacher at the school, Simon Clague, pleaded guilty to multiple indictments for indecent assault and gross indecency with three pupils. All of the victims were under 16 at the time of the offending, which took place at the school in the 1990s; his trial was repeatedly delayed because of COVID-19. He was later, in July 2023, banned from teaching. In September 2023, three former pupils of the school sued following the criminal conviction of Clague. Victim Impact statements in this civil action highlighted &#x27;irreversable damage&#x27; caused by his crimes, referring to &#x27;stolen innocence&#x27;; one victim said they were manipulated into having a sexual relationship with Clague – and that the school &#x27;knew and brushed it under the carpet&#x27;.

=== Resignation of three governors over safeguarding ===
In September 2022, 3 governors resigned &quot;en bloc&quot; over safeguarding issues at the school; these were additional safeguarding issues to those set out above that came to light after the jailing of Simon Clague.

Criminal barrister of the Queen&#x27;s Counsel Tim Hannam, Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone, and former Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire Susannah Fish (Order of the British Empire, Queen&#x27;s Police Medal) were identified in press reports as the three governors who quit their roles. Ms Fish&#x27;s resignation letter to the chairman of the governors, Mark Shires, said the decision to allow the teacher to remain in post means the school had not taken seriously:&quot;an appalling catalogue [of alleged past misconduct and it was therefore the case that]... safeguarding of pupils past, present and future is now in jeopardy and lacks credibility’.

== Partnerships ==

In May 2016, the school made defibrillators on its site available to the local community. Some of the staff at the school have been vocal about the issue of speeding traffic in the village of Repton and have participated in public speed gun enforcement.

During the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic the school&#x27;s DT department made PPE for key NHS workers.

Repton School and Repton village combine every year for a charity event known as Sale of Work. Funds raised are distributed to a range of local and national charities chosen by representatives of both communities.

<text>Robert Michael Gainey (born December 13, 1953) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played for the Montreal Canadiens from 1973 until 1989. After retiring from active play, he became a hockey coach and later an executive with the Minnesota North Stars/Dallas Stars organization before returning to Montreal as general manager from 2003 to 2010. Currently, Gainey serves as a team consultant for the St. Louis Blues as well as a volunteer senior advisor for the Peterborough Petes of the Ontario Hockey League. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1992. In 2017 Gainey was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

==Early years==
Bob Gainey began his hockey career in 1972 with his hometown team, the Peterborough Petes of the Ontario Hockey League. His lack of scoring was made up for by his impressive ability to shut down opposing players. This impressed many scouts in the NHL and in 1973, he was drafted eighth overall by the Montreal Canadiens. He was also drafted seventh overall by the Minnesota Fighting Saints of the WHA although he never joined the WHA.

==Professional years==
As a rookie, Gainey was committed to a defensive style of play. In his second year, he was paired up with stars Yvan Cournoyer and Jacques Lemaire on the second line. In 1976, Gainey was chosen to represent Team Canada at the Canada Cup tournament where he helped Team Canada win the Cup against the Czechoslovakians.
A defensive specialist, Gainey played with the Montreal Canadiens from 1973–74 to 1988–89, winning four consecutive Frank J. Selke Trophies, awarded to the league&#x27;s best defensive forward, and four consecutive Stanley Cups from 1976 to 1979.

In 1982, Canadiens captain Serge Savard retired from hockey and Gainey was named as his successor. The Canadiens remained successful in the regular season but in the playoffs, they were defeated in the first round three consecutive times from 1981 to 1983. Next season, the Canadiens earned a disappointing record finishing with 75 points only. Despite that, they embarked on a surprising playoff run before being eliminated in the semifinals by the New York Islanders.

Gainey lifted his last Stanley Cup as a player in 1986 against the Calgary Flames, and scored a playoff total of 5 goals and 10 points. Under Gainey&#x27;s leadership, the Canadiens posted back to back 100 point seasons in 1988 and 1989. In 1989, the Canadiens reached the finals again against the Calgary Flames, a rematch from 1986. This time, the Flames won the Stanley Cup in 6 games. Following the loss, Gainey announced his retirement.

In total, Bob Gainey played in 1160 regular season games, scored 239 goals, and registered 263 assists. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1992. In 1998, Gainey was ranked number 86 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.

==Post hockey playing years==
After his retirement, Gainey moved to France where he was player-coach for the Epinal Écureuils (Squirrels) of the French Nationale 1B division. His unexpected appearance on the French hockey scene created quite a stir as curious fans attended games to see the famous star in action for Epinal. He finished second in scoring for Epinal during the regular season and 18th overall in the Nationale 1B division.

Gainey returned to North America a year later and became head coach of the Minnesota North Stars in 1990–91, guiding his team to the sixth game of the Stanley Cup finals in his first season. In January 1992, Gainey also was named general manager. In 1996, a few seasons after the franchise relocated to Dallas and became the Dallas Stars, he stepped down as head coach to focus solely on his general manager duties. Gainey turned the franchise into a powerhouse by acquiring players such as Joe Nieuwendyk, Brett Hull, Ed Belfour and Sergei Zubov. The team won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy in 1998 and 1999. Dallas won the Stanley Cup in 1999.

In 1997, as Stars general manager, Gainey drafted his son Steve Gainey 77th overall in the annual NHL Entry Draft. Gainey won the Stanley Cup a sixth time in 1999 with Dallas.

Along with Bobby Clarke and Pierre Gauthier, Gainey was given the responsibility of selecting Canada&#x27;s men&#x27;s ice hockey squad for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.

Gainey became general manager of the Montreal Canadiens in May 2003. On January 13, 2006, Gainey fired Canadiens&#x27; head coach Claude Julien and stepped in as head coach on an interim basis. At the same time, he hired Guy Carbonneau to work as an associate coach, handing the coaching reins over to him for the 2006–07 season. On July 24, 2006, Montreal Canadiens president Pierre Boivin extended Gainey&#x27;s contract to 2009–10.

On February 23, 2008, the Canadiens retired Gainey&#x27;s #23 jersey.

On March 9, 2009, Gainey named himself the interim coach of the Montreal Canadiens after firing Guy Carbonneau. On June 1, 2009, he signed Jacques Martin as the new head coach. On February 8, 2010, he resigned as the Canadiens general manager for personal reasons, and was succeeded by Gauthier. The Canadiens were 28-26-6 at the time of his resignation. He remained on as a consultant to the team until the end of the 2011–12 season, following the firing of Pierre Gauthier, when it was mutually agreed, between Gainey and team President Geoff Molson, that he step down.

On May 9, 2012, the Dallas Stars announced Gainey&#x27;s hiring as a team consultant.

On October 1, 2014, the St. Louis Blues announced Gainey&#x27;s hiring as a team consultant.

==Personal life==
Bob Gainey, with his wife Cathy, were parents to one son and three daughters: Steve (whom he drafted in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft), Colleen, Anna (the former president of the Liberal Party of Canada and Canadian member of parliament (MP) for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Westmount), and Laura.

Gainey&#x27;s wife Cathy died in June 1995 at age 39 of brain cancer. Gainey&#x27;s daughter, Laura, died at age 25 in December 2006, when she was swept overboard while sailing in the North Atlantic on the barque &quot;Picton Castle&quot;, a sail-training tall ship based out of Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, registered in the Cook Islands and destined for Grenada. Laura&#x27;s body was never recovered, and the U.S. Coast Guard called off the search on December 11, three days after she was swept overboard. During this time, Gainey temporarily passed his general manager duties on to Montreal Canadiens assistant manager (and eventual successor) Pierre Gauthier for four weeks. On January 3, 2007, officials in the Cook Islands named Captain Andrew Scheer to head an investigation into Laura&#x27;s death. Captain Scheer interviewed the 30-strong crew and examined the ship&#x27;s logs, emergency equipment and crew qualifications. Laura&#x27;s death and the subsequent investigations received considerable press attention in Canada, including a documentary produced by the CBC News program &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot;, which was highly critical of safety standards on the &quot;Picton Castle&quot;.

<doc id="507834" wikidata="Q317824" url="?curid=507834" title="Kim Jong-nam">
<text>Kim Jong-nam (, ; 10 May 1971 – 13 February 2017) was the eldest son of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. From roughly 1994 to 2001, he was considered the heir apparent to his father. He was thought to have fallen out of favor after embarrassing the regime in 2001 with a failed attempt to visit Tokyo Disneyland with a false passport, although Kim himself said his loss of favor had been due to advocating reform.

Kim Jong-nam was exiled from North Korea 2003, becoming an occasional critic of his family&#x27;s regime. His younger paternal half-brother, Kim Jong Un, was named heir apparent in September 2010. On 13 February 2017, the North Korean government assassinated Kim Jong-nam with the nerve agent VX in Malaysia after previous failed attempts to kill him. 

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; on 10 June 2019 reported that former US officials stated that Kim Jong-nam had been a CIA source.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life (1971–1998)===

Kim Jong-nam was born on 10 May 1971 in Pyongyang, North Korea, to Song Hye-rim, one of four women known to have had children with Kim Jong Il. Because Kim Jong Il aimed to keep his affair with Song a secret due to the disapproval of his father Kim Il Sung, he initially kept Jong-nam out of school, instead sending him to live with Song&#x27;s older sister Song Hye-rang, who tutored him at home. North Korea Leadership Watch says he left North Korea to visit his grandmother in Moscow, Soviet Union, and spent his childhood at international schools in both Russia and Switzerland until returning to his home country in 1988.

Kim Jong-nam was reported to have had a personality similar to that of his father, and was described by his aunt as being &quot;hot-tempered, sensitive, and gifted in the arts&quot;. His aunt also said in 2000 that he &quot;[did] not wish to succeed his father&quot;. Like Kim Jong Il, he was interested in film: he wrote scripts and short films from a young age. His father also created a small movie set for him to use.

Kim Jong-nam made several clandestine visits to Japan, starting as early as 1995.

=== 1998–2001: Heir apparent ===

In 1998, Kim Jong-nam was appointed to a senior position in the Ministry of Public Security of North Korea, as a future leader. He was also reported to have been appointed head of the North Korean Computer Committee, in charge of developing an information technology (IT) industry. In January 2001, he accompanied his father to Shanghai, where he had talks with Chinese officials on the IT industry.

=== 2001–2005: Tokyo Disneyland incident &amp; loss of favor ===

In May 2001, Kim Jong-nam was arrested in Japan on arrival at Narita International Airport, accompanied by two women and a four-year-old boy identified as his son. He was traveling on a forged Dominican Republic passport using a Chinese alias, Pang Xiong (). After being detained, he was deported to China, where he said he was traveling to Japan to visit Tokyo Disneyland. The incident caused his father to cancel a planned visit to China due to the embarrassment it caused him.

Until the Tokyo incident, Kim Jong-nam was expected to become leader of the country after his father. In February 2003, the Korean People&#x27;s Army began a propaganda campaign under the slogan &quot;The respected Mother is the most-faithful and loyal Subject to the Dear Leader Comrade Supreme Commander&quot;. This was interpreted as praise of Ko Yong Hui, and likely part of a campaign designed to promote Kim Jong-chul or Kim Jong Un, her sons.

Since the loyalty of the army is the foundation of the Kim family&#x27;s continuing hold on power in North Korea, this was a serious detriment for Kim Jong-nam&#x27;s prospects. In late 2003, it was reported that Kim Jong-nam was living in Macau, lending strength to this belief.

Kim Jong Un was left in charge while his father was on a state-visit to China. Outsider observers also believed North Korea&#x27;s sinking of a South Korean ship in March 2010 was part of Kim Jong Il&#x27;s attempt to secure succession for the youngest Kim: provoking a security crisis he could use to rally military support behind Kim Jong Un.

Kim Jong-nam&#x27;s loss of favor was thought to have been caused by the Tokyo incident. However, Kim Jong-nam himself claimed that he had fallen out of favor due to advocating for reform. In an email to the editor of the &quot;Tokyo Shimbun&quot;, Kim Jong-nam wrote that after being educated in Switzerland, he &quot;insisted on reform and market-opening&quot;, leading his father to decide that he had &quot;turned into a capitalist&quot;. Kim Jong-nam at this time has also been described as &quot;the closest North Korean ever to have been an international playboy&quot;, and gained a reputation for &quot;gambling and drinking and arranging the occasional business deal&quot;. He used to be the only member of the Kim family to ever speak directly to media outside of North Korea, until Kim Jong Un took a question from a foreign journalist during the 2019 North Korea - United States Hanoi Summit.

It was believed that Kim Jong-nam had friendly ties to China. Outside analysts considered him as a possible candidate to replace Kim Jong Un if the North Korean leadership imploded and China, traditionally an ally, sought a replacement leader.

=== 2005–2017: Rise of Kim Jong Un ===

The &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; reported that Kim Jong-nam, while traveling to see his brother Kim Jong-chul in Munich, survived an assassination attempt at the Budapest Ferihegy International Airport in July 2006. According to South Korean reports, the Hungarian government protested against the incident to the North Korean embassy in Vienna, requesting there be no recurrence. It was reported in the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;, on 1 February 2007, that Kim Jong-nam had been living incognito with his family in Macau for some three years.

South Korean television and the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; reported in 2007 that Kim Jong-nam had a Portuguese passport. However, Portuguese authorities and the Portuguese consul in Macau, Pedro Moitinho de Almeida, stated that if Kim had such a document, it would be a forgery.

In January 2009, Kim Jong-nam said that he had &quot;no interest&quot; in taking power in North Korea after his father, stating that it is only for his father to decide.

In June 2010, Kim Jong-nam gave a brief interview to the Associated Press in Macau while waiting for a hotel elevator. He said that he had &quot;no plans&quot; to defect to Europe, as the press had recently rumored. He lived in an apartment on the southern tip of Macau&#x27;s Coloane Island until 2007. An anonymous South Korean official reported in October 2010 that Kim Jong-nam had not lived in Macau for &quot;months&quot;, and shuttled between China and &quot;another country&quot;.

In late September 2010, his younger half-brother Kim Jong Un was made heir apparent. Kim Jong Un was declared Supreme Leader of North Korea on 24 December 2011 after the death of Kim Jong Il. The two half-brothers had never met because of the ancient practice of raising potential successors separately.

On 1 January 2012, it was reported that Kim Jong-nam secretly flew to Pyongyang from Macau on 17 December 2011, after learning about his father&#x27;s death that day and was presumed to have accompanied Kim Jong Un when paying his last respects to their father. He left after a few days to return to Macau and was not in attendance at the funeral to avoid speculation about the succession.

On 14 January 2012, Kim Jong-nam was seen in Beijing waiting for an Air China flight to Macau. He confirmed his identity to a group of South Koreans, which included a professor at Incheon University and told them that he usually travels alone.

In a book released in 2012 titled &quot;My Father, Kim Jong Il, and me&quot; by Japanese journalist Gomi Yōji who had interviewed him on numerous occasions, Kim Jong-nam said that he expected the leadership of Kim Jong Un to fail, citing that he was too inexperienced and young. He also stated, &quot;Without reforms, North Korea will collapse, and when such changes take place, the regime will collapse&quot;.

According to South Korean intelligence sources, Kim Jong Un had issued a standing order to have his half-brother killed. In 2012, there was another assassination attempt on Kim Jong-nam, who later that year sent a letter to his half-brother begging for his life. In late 2012, he appeared in Singapore one year after leaving Macau. He left Macau on suspicions that he was being targeted for assassination by Kim Jong Un; South Korean authorities had formerly indicted a North Korean agent, Kim Yong-su, who confessed to planning an attack on Kim Jong-nam in July 2010.

On 10 June 2019, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, citing former US officials, stated that Kim Jong-nam had been a CIA source. A book by Anna Fifield, &quot;Washington Post&quot; bureau chief in Beijing, had earlier reported this, stating that he had been previously filmed abroad with a US intelligence agent, and had carried a backpack containing $120,000 in cash.

== Assassination ==

On 13 February 2017, Kim Jong-nam died after being exposed to VX nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia. It is widely believed that he was killed on the orders of his half-brother Kim Jong Un. Four North Korean suspects left the airport shortly after the attack, traveling back to Pyongyang.

An Indonesian woman, Siti Aisyah, and a Vietnamese woman, Đoàn Thị Hương, were charged with murder but said they thought they were taking part in a TV prank. In March 2019, Siti Aisyah was freed after the charge against her was dropped. In April, the murder charge against Hương was also dropped, and she pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of &quot;voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means&quot;. She was sentenced to three years and four months in prison, but received a one-third reduction in her term, and was released on 3 May 2019.

== Personal life ==

It has been reported that Kim Jong-nam had two wives, and one mistress, and had at least six children. His first wife, Shin Jong-hui (born ), lives at a home called Dragon Villa on the northern outskirts of Beijing. His second wife, Lee Hye-kyong (born ), their son Han-sol (born 1995), and their daughter Sol-hui (born ) lived in a modest 12-story apartment building in Macau; his mistress, former Air Koryo flight attendant So Yong-la (born ), also lives in Macau. He had several tattoos, including two of dragons.

<doc id="507836" wikidata="Q3312916" url="?curid=507836" title="Federal Duck Stamp">
<text>The Federal Duck Stamp, formally known as the Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp, is an adhesive stamp issued by the United States federal government that must be purchased prior to hunting for migratory waterfowl such as ducks and geese. It is also used to gain entrance to National Wildlife Refuges that normally charge for admission. It is widely seen as a collectable and a means to raise funds for wetland conservation, with 98% of the proceeds of each sale going to the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund.

President Herbert Hoover signed the Migratory Bird Conservation Act in 1929 to authorize the acquisition and preservation of wetlands as waterfowl habitat. The law, however, did not provide a permanent source of money to buy and preserve the wetlands. On March 16, 1934, Congress passed, and President Roosevelt signed, the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act, popularly known as the Duck Stamp Act.

==Overview==

Duck stamps are issued once a year. In most states, hunters are required to purchase both a federal and state stamp before hunting waterfowl. Waterfowl hunting seasons vary, but most begin in September or October, so naturally, stamps are needed prior to opening day of the hunting season. Currently, the federal stamp and more than half of the state stamps are issued by July. Many are issued on the first day of the new year, and a few at the last minute in September or early October.

The annual federal duck stamp had a face value of $1 in 1934, jumped to $2 in 1949, and to $3 in 1959. In 1972 the price increased to $5, then up to $7.50 in 1979, $10 in 1987, $12.50 in 1989 and to $15 in 1991. In 2015 the price of federal duck stamp rose to $25. For every $15 stamp sold, the federal government retained $14.70 for wetlands acquisition and conservation, with just 30 cents to overhead. Most state conservation stamps have a face value of $5. New Hampshire has the lowest price at $4; North Carolina is the highest at $27. Funds generated from state stamps are designated for wetlands restoration and preservation, much like the federal funds, but with a more localized purpose. Most state agencies sell their stamps at face value. However, some also charge a premium to collectors buying single stamps, to help cover overhead costs. Some states also produce limited editions for collectors.

== Types ==
About 10 states issue two types of stamps, one for collectors and another for hunter use. Collector stamps are usually in panes of 10 or 30 without tabs. Hunter type stamps are usually issued in panes of five or 10, many with tabs attached. Hunters use the tabs to list their name, address, age and other data. Some states use only serial numbers to designate their hunter type stamp. State stamps are therefore referred to as either collector stamps or hunter type stamps. Most dealers will distinguish between these types on their price lists. Separate albums exist for both types and are available from most dealers.

Plate blocks or control number blocks are designations given to a block of stamps, usually four, with a plate or control number present on the selvage. Such a block is usually located in one or all four corners of a pane. Federal stamps prior to 1959 plus the 1964 issue are collected in blocks of six and must have the selvage on two sides. The Federal Junior Duck Stamp Program is a non-profit program sponsored by the Federal Government and designed to promote interest in conservation and wetlands preservation among students in grades K to 12. The program includes a conservation and education curriculum that helps students of all ages. It focuses on wildlife conservation and management, wildlife art and philately. All proceeds from sales support conservation education.

Governor&#x27;s editions have been issued by several state agencies as a means of raising additional income. These stamps are printed in small quantities, most fewer than 1,000. They have a face value of approximately $50, and are imprinted with the name of the state governor. Governors also hand-sign a limited number of stamps. These are usually available at a premium, generally twice the price of normal singles. Hand-signed or autographed stamps are issued in very small quantities and are scarce to rare. Governor&#x27;s editions are valid for hunting by all issuing states, but none would be used for that purpose, however, as it would destroy the mint condition and lower the value of the stamp.

== Federal Duck Stamp contest ==

The first Federal Duck Stamp, designed by Jay Norwood Darling in 1934 at President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s request, depicts two mallards about to land on a marsh pond. In subsequent years, other noted wildlife artists were asked to submit designs.

In 1949, the first duck stamp contest was opened to the public. The first contest in 1949 was open to any U.S. artist who wished to enter. Sixty-five artists submitted 88 design entries that first year. The number of entries rose to 2,099 in 1981. Maynard Reece from Arnolds Park, Iowa, won the competition a record five times, winning in 1948, 1951, 1959, 1969 and 1971. Brothers, Joe and Jim Hautman have individually surpassed Reece&#x27;s record with six wins respectively.

The contest remains the only art competition of its kind sponsored by the U.S. Government. A panel of noted art, waterfowl, and philatelic authorities is appointed by the Secretary of the Interior to judge each competition. Winners receive no compensation for their work, other than a pane of stamps carrying their design. Winning artists may sell prints of their designs, which are sought after by hunters, conservationists, and art collectors.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service mails contest regulations to interested artists each spring. Artists may choose their own medium and designs may be in black-and-white or full color and must measure 10 inches wide by 7 inches high.

Each year prospective contestants are provided with a list of eligible species to choose as their subject. The eligible species for the 2024 contest were Brant, Northern Shoveler, Greater Scaup, Spectacled Eider, and Hooded Merganser.

=== List of Federal Duck Stamps ===
== Issuance ==
Duck stamps are now issued by the United States government and all state governments. Many foreign countries, including Canada, Australia, Mexico, Russia and the United Kingdom have also issued duck stamps.

The issuing authorities within the various governments that release duck stamps are usually conservation and wildlife departments. These programs must be created by some form of legislation for the resulting stamps to be accepted as a valid governmental issue. Labels featuring ducks also are issued by various special interest groups, such as Ducks Unlimited and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. Their issues are referred to as &quot;society stamps.&quot; These items technically are not duck stamps because the fee structure and disposition of funds are not legislated. However, society stamps are very collectible and often appreciated. Funds raised by these organizations are also used for waterfowl and conservation efforts. Valid organizations and societies of this type perform a major service to conservation by their donations and efforts, and they merit public support.

== In popular culture ==

In September 2021 comedian John Oliver said on &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot; that he had commissioned and submitted five humorous entries into the contest. These were later auctioned off, fetching nearly $100,000 which was donated to the Federal Duck Stamp program. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service released a statement in response, saying &quot;The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is excited &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot; with John Oliver is supportive of wildlife and wetland conservation.&quot;

A 2016 documentary, The Million Dollar Duck, tells the story about the contest and some of the contestants.

<text>The New Reasoner was a British journal of dissident Communism published from 1957 to 1959 by John Saville and E. P. Thompson. The publication is best remembered as an antecedent of the long-running journal &quot;New Left Review&quot;.

==&quot;The Reasoner&quot;==

&quot;The New Reasoner&quot; was preceded by a journal entitled &quot;The Reasoner&quot;, first published in July 1956 by John Saville and E. P. Thompson. The editors proposed the use of the journal as a forum for the discussion of &quot;questions of fundamental principle, aim, and strategy,&quot; critiquing Stalinism as well as the dogmatic politics of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB).

&quot;The Reasoner&quot; took its name from an early 19th-century publication which had attempted to renew and reinvigorate a flagging Jacobin Radicalism.

Over its five months of existence, the journal angered many within the leadership of the CPGB. Thompson and Saville were ordered to cease publication of their dissident journal, an order they chose to defy. Because of their refusal, Thompson and Saville were suspended from the CPGB.

==&quot;The New Reasoner&quot;==
In 1957, following their resignation from the CPGB over its support of the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion of Hungary, Thompson and Saville began the publication of a new journal, named the &quot;New Reasoner&quot;, with the purpose of contributing to &quot;the re-discovery of our traditions, the affirmation of socialist values, and the undogmatic perception of social reality.&quot; The opening editorial was a reaffirmation of their commitment to the British Marxist and Communist tradition, despite their departure from the Party. They allied themselves with European workers who were fighting for &quot;de-stalinisation&quot; and called for the rebirth of principles within the movement. 

In 1960 the &quot;New Reasoner&quot; merged with the &quot;Universities and Left Review&quot; journal to become &quot;New Left Review&quot;.

<text>Danilo Medina Sánchez (; born 10 November 1951) is a Dominican politician who was President of the Dominican Republic from 2012 to 2020.
Medina previously served as Chief of Staff to the President of the Dominican Republic from 1996 to 1999 and from 2004 to 2006, and is a member of the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD). He won the May 2012 Dominican presidential election, defeating Hipòlito Mejía with 51% of the votes. On 15 May 2016, Danilo Medina leading a coalition of parties won the 2016 Dominican presidential election, defeating the leader of the opposition and PRM candidate Luis Abinader with 61.8% of the votes, the highest percentage received by a president elected in free elections since 1924 when Horacio Vásquez won the presidency with 69.8% of the ballots—surpassing Juan Bosch&#x27;s record of 59.5% obtained in 1962, and Leonel Fernández&#x27;s 57.1% of the votes obtained in 2004.

Medina&#x27;s second term has been characterized as humane, transparent and goal-driven by its supporters. With a penchant for performing weekly visits to impoverished rural sections of the country, President Medina finished his second term with a 65% approval rate. However, during his second term there were attempts to seek a third term which was frustrated after a call from the US Department of State secretary Mike Pompeo.

Medina&#x27;s family, including two of his brothers, are currently being investigated under allegations of corruption, involving traffic of influence by which they benefited under Medina presidency, obtaining multiple contracts and business with the State. , the investigation process had entered a new phase following the arrests of two of Medina&#x27;s brothers.

==Early years==
Medina was born in Arroyo Cano, San Juan Province, in the southwest of the Dominican Republic. He is the oldest of eight brothers born to Juan Pablo Medina de los Santos (1918–2019) and Amelia Sánchez Abreu (1931–2004). Since he was 18 years old he was a student leader, founding the San Juan de la Maguana branch of the Frente Revolucionario Estudiantil Nacionalista at the UASD. When Professor Juan Bosch founded the Partido de la Liberación Dominicana in 1973. Medina joined him. He studied economics at Instituto Tecnológico Santo Domingo (INTEC), and graduated magna cum laude in 1984. He has been a member of the Central Committee of the PLD since 1983. In 1986 election he was elected a deputy in Congress. In 1987, he married psychologist Cándida Montilla and has three daughters, Sibeli, Vanessa and Ana Paula.

==Career during the 1990s and 2000s==

In 1990, Medina was elected member of the Political Committee of the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD) together with Leonel Fernández and Juan Temístocles Montás. He was selected by his political organization to be the President of the Chamber of Deputies in the Dominican Republic.

He was President of the Chamber of Deputies of the Dominican Republic from 1994 to 1995, and subsequently served as Secretary of State of the Presidency from 1996 to 1999 and again from 2004 to 2006.

As president of the Chamber of Deputies in the National Congress (1990–94), he was a key figure in congressional negotiations that led to the resolving of the 1994 political impasse. In that year, a close finish between Joaquín Balaguer and José Francisco Peña Gómez brought about a major conflict, as one side accused the other of fraud. The conflict was resolved with a pact that instituted separate presidential and congressional elections, the need for a candidate to receive 50%+1 of the vote to win in a first round, and prohibited presidential re-election. The agreement eventually worked in favor of the PLD, which won the presidential in the 1996 election, with Leonel Fernández defeating José Francisco Peña Gómez in a second round.

Medina is considered the PLD&#x27;s leading political strategist and negotiator. As such, he was one of the leaders of the presidential campaign of President Fernández. He was appointed Secretary of the Presidency in 1996 and was one of the President&#x27;s closest aides. In 2000, with Fernández barred from reelection (at the time, Dominican presidents could not immediately succeed themselves), Medina was the presidential candidate of the PLD. He finished a distant second behind opposition candidate Hipólito Mejía of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD), taking only 24.9 percent of the vote to Mejía&#x27;s 49.87 percent. However, Medina concluded he had no chance of overcoming Mejía&#x27;s nearly 25-point first-round lead, especially after third-place finisher Balaguer hinted some of his supporters would vote for the PRD in the runoff. Medina would have needed nearly all of Balaguer&#x27;s supporters in order to overcome his massive first-round deficit. Realizing that he would be lucky to get half of them in the runoff, Medina conceded the presidency to Mejía. In his concession speech, Medina said that a runoff would not be in the country&#x27;s best interest.

As President Fernández acceded to a second term in 2004, Medina was once again appointed Secretary of the Presidency (Equivalent to Chief of Staff) and considered second in command on internal corridors of Government. As a new election approached in 2008, Medina was considered the main competition for President Fernández, as he was considered by some to have complete political control of the ruling party, the PLD. He resigned from the post on 8 November 2006 in order to launch his bid for the PLD presidential nomination against President Fernández.

After running a campaign under the slogans &quot;Ahora Es&quot; and &quot;Lo Mejor Para Todos&quot; (&quot;Now Is the Time&quot; and &quot;The Best for Everybody&quot;) Medina was eventually defeated by President Fernández in the 6 May 2007 PLD internal election to choose the party&#x27;s candidate for the 2008 presidential election. Since its foundation the PLD had maintained an implicit non re-election policy, but President Fernández changed that allowing him to campaign against Medina from the Presidential Palace and opt for a second consecutive term in power (his third).

In the internal PLD vote Medina obtained 28.45% of the votes against President Fernández&#x27; 71.55%. Minor irregularities were confirmed during the election process. In the evening of 6 May 2007, Medina made a brief public appearance saying he had been &quot;beaten by the state&quot; (in reference to the fact that government resources had been used to suppress his candidacy and to promote that of Fernández).

Subsequently, Medina and his supporters maintained a low profile. During this period he was considered the most likely contender for the PLD candidacy in the 2012 Dominican presidential election.

==President of the Dominican Republic==
Medina ran for and was elected President of the Dominican Republic in the 2012 Dominican presidential election, that ended on the morning of 21 May, with 51.24% of the votes defeating Hipólito Mejía, his 2000 election rival. While running for office Medina&#x27;s thesis was criticized for suspected plagiarism by Génove Gneco, the professor coordinating the Office against plagiarism in the thesis, of the Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo. Gneco also investigated the thesis of senator Félix Bautista and Minister of Economic Affairs Juan Temístocles Montás. He was later removed from his position for overstepping his limits and not being able to prove his claims.
Medina vowed to fight corruption, create jobs and invest in education in the Caribbean nation. In the 2016 Dominican presidential election, Medina was re-elected for a second term, defeating the leader of the opposition and PRM candidate Luis Abinader with 61.8% of the votes.
His government aligned itself with that of the United States in international relations. On Venezuela, he refused to recognise President Nicolas Maduro and supported Juan Guaido, an opposition leader. He and other pro-US Caribbean leaders were summoned to a meeting with Donald Trump in March 2019 to define a common policy on the situation in Venezuela and China&#x27;s &quot;predatory economic practices&quot;.

Following his term in office, Medina&#x27;s family is currently being investigated for using political and family ties to accumulate wealth during his term as president. The process is being overseen by PEPCA (Government anti-corruption prosecution) and the Deputy Attorney General of the Dominican Republic. , the investigation moved into a new stage with the arrest of two of Medina&#x27;s brothers.

==Ancestry==
According to genealogist Sinecio Ramírez Suazo, Danilo Medina is allegedly descended from Francisco del Rosario Sánchez, founding father of the Dominican Republic. If true, Medina would be the first Dominican President descended from one of the Founding Fathers; however, genealogist Edwin Espinal argues that Medina&#x27;s great-great-great-grandfather Dionisio Sánchez Herrera could not be the son of Juan Francisco Sánchez de Peña (Francisco del Rosario Sánchez&#x27;s son) since Sánchez Herrera was born in 1840 and Sánchez de Peña in 1852.

<doc id="507843" wikidata="Q1849105" url="?curid=507843" title="List of Billboard Hot 100 number ones of 1997">
<text>The &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Published by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, the data are compiled by Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single&#x27;s weekly physical sales and airplay. There were ten singles that peaked atop the charts, but if &quot;Un-Break My Heart&quot; is excluded from the count (for the song started its peak in the previous year), the total would be nine. The longest running number-one single of 1997 is &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot;/&quot;Something About the Way You Look Tonight&quot;, which logged 14 weeks at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Two of those weeks were logged in 1998 while the remaining 12 were attained in 1997.

With &quot;Honey&quot; becoming her 12th #1 single, Mariah Carey broke the record for most #1 songs by a female artist, surpassing Madonna and Whitney Houston with 11 each.

That year, 7 acts earned their first number one song, such as Spice Girls, Puff Daddy, Mase, The Notorious B.I.G., Hanson, Faith Evans, and 112. The Notorious B.I.G. became the fifth artist to hit number one posthumously, after his death in March 1997. Puff Daddy, Mase, and The Notorious B.I.G. were the only artists to hit number one more than once, with Puff Daddy hitting the most with three, while Mase and The Notorious B.I.G. hit twice.

<doc id="507848" wikidata="Q206249" url="?curid=507848" title="New Left Review">
<text>The New Left Review is a British bimonthly journal, established in 1960, which analyzes international politics, the global economy, social theory, and cultural topics from a leftist perspective.

== History ==
=== Background ===
As part of the emerging British &quot;New Left&quot; in the late 1950s, a number of journals were launched to carry commentary on matters of Marxist theory. One of these was &quot;The Reasoner&quot;, founded by historians E. P. Thompson and John Saville in July 1956. Three quarterly issues were produced. The publication was expanded and further developed from 1957 to 1959 as &quot;The New Reasoner&quot;, with an additional ten issues produced. &quot;The New Reasoner&quot; distanced itself from the British Communist Party and USSR in the wake of Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s February 1956 &quot;Secret Speech&quot; on the Stalinist cult of personality, and the Soviet repression of the Hungarian Uprising in November 1956.

Another radical journal of the period was the &quot;Universities and Left Review&quot;, a publication started in 1957 with less allegiance to the British communist tradition. This journal was youth-oriented and pacifist in nature, expressing opposition to the militaristic rhetoric of the Cold War, voicing strong disagreement with the 1956 Suez War, and supporting the burgeoning Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND).

=== Establishment ===
&quot;New Left Review&quot; was established in January 1960 when &quot;The New Reasoner&quot; and &quot;Universities and Left Review&quot; merged their Boards. The first editor-in-chief of the merged publication was Stuart Hall. The early &quot;New Left Review&quot; style, featuring illustrations on the cover and in the interior layout, was more irreverent and free-flowing than the publication&#x27;s later issues, which tended to be more somber and academic. Hall was succeeded as editor in 1962 by Perry Anderson.

In 1993, nineteen of the members of the editorial committee resigned, citing a loss of control over content by the Editorial Board/Committee in favour of a Shareholders&#x27; Trust, which they argued was undemocratic. The Trust—composed of Perry Anderson, his brother Benedict Anderson, and Ronald Fraser—said that a change was necessary for the financial sustainability of &quot;New Left Review&quot;. The journal was relaunched in 2000, and Perry Anderson returned as editor until 2003.

===Since 2008===
&quot;New Left Review&quot; closely followed the financial crisis of 2007–2008 as well as its aftermath and its global political repercussions. A 2011 essay by Wolfgang Streeck, titled &quot;The Crises of Democratic Capitalism&quot;, was called &quot;the most powerful description of what has gone wrong in western societies&quot; by the &quot;Financial Times&quot;″s contributor Christopher Caldwell.

In recent years, writer Benjamin Kunkel has served as a member of the &quot;New Left Review&quot; editorial committee, while Oliver Eagleton is on the editorial staff.

== Abstracting and indexing ==
In 2003, &quot;New Left Review&quot; was ranked 12th by impact factor on a list of the top 20 political science journals in the world. By 2018, however, the &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot; rated it 51st out of 176 journals in the category &quot;Political Science&quot;, with an impact factor of 1.967. In 2023, the citation database Scopus placed &quot;New Left Review&quot; in the 69th percentile, 214th out of 706 &quot;Political Science and International Relations&quot; journals, with a citation score of 2.2.

<text>A misnomer is a name that is incorrectly or unsuitably applied. Misnomers often arise because something was named long before its correct nature was known, or because an earlier form of something has been replaced by a later form to which the name no longer suitably applies. A misnomer may also be a word that is used incorrectly or misleadingly. The word &quot;misnomer&quot; does not mean &quot;misunderstanding&quot; or &quot;popular misconception&quot;, and a number of misnomers remain in common usage — which is to say that a word being a misnomer does not necessarily make &quot;usage&quot; of the word incorrect.

== Sources of misnomers ==
* An older name being retained after the thing itself has changed (e.g., tin can, mince meat pie, steamroller, tin foil, clothes iron, digital darkroom). This is essentially a metaphorical extension with the name of the older item standing for anything filling the same role.
* Transference of a well-known product brand name into a genericized trademark (e.g., Xerox for photocopy, Kleenex for tissues, or Jell-O for gelatin dessert).
* &quot;Pars pro toto&quot; (i.e., the name of a part being applied to the whole). &quot;Holland&quot; is often used to refer to the Netherlands, while it is actually only a part of that country.
* Referring to the suburbs of a metropolis by the name of the biggest city in the metropolis.
* A name based on a similarity in a particular aspect (e.g., &quot;shooting stars&quot; look like falling stars but are actually meteors).
* A difference between popular and technical meanings of a term. A koala &quot;bear&quot; (see below) superficially looks and acts like a bear, but is quite distinct and unrelated. Fireflies fly like flies, and ladybugs are like bugs. Botanically, peanuts are not nuts. The technical sense is often cited as &quot;correct&quot;, but this is a matter of context.
* Ambiguity. A parkway is generally a road with park-like landscaping, not a place to park. Such a term may confuse those unfamiliar with the language.
* Association of a thing with a place other than its origin. Panama hats originate from Ecuador, but came to be associated with the building of the Panama Canal.
* Naming particular to the originator&#x27;s world view.
* An unfamiliar name – perhaps foreign – or technical term re-analyzed as something more familiar (see folk etymology).
* Anachronisms, juxtaposed terms from different time periods, creating chronological inconsistency. 

==Examples==
=== Older name retained ===

* The &quot;lead&quot; in pencils is made of graphite and clay, not lead; graphite was once believed to be lead ore. The graphite and clay mix is known as &quot;plumbago&quot;, meaning &quot;lead ore&quot; in Latin.
* Blackboards can be black, green, red, blue, or brown. 
* Sticks of chalk are no longer made of chalk, but of gypsum.
* Tin foil is almost always made of aluminium, whereas &quot;tin cans&quot; made for the storage of food products are made from steel with a thin tin plating. In both cases, tin was the original metal.
* Telephone numbers are referred to as being &quot;dialed&quot; although rotary phones are now rare.
* In golf, the clubs referred to as woods were once made of wood but are now usually made of metal.

The term &quot;anachronym&quot; refers to this type of misnomer. &quot;Anachronym&quot; should not be confused with &quot;anacronyms&quot;, which refers to words (such as &quot;laser&quot;, &quot;sonar&quot; and &quot;scuba&quot;) with acronymic origin but which are now used syntactically as words in their own right.

===Similarity of appearance===

*Head cheese is a meat product.
*A horned toad is a lizard.
*A velvet ant is a wasp.
=== Difference between common and technical meanings ===

* Koala &quot;bears&quot; are marsupials not closely related to the bear family, Ursidae. The term &quot;koala&quot; is preferred in their native Australia.
* Jellyfish and starfish are only very distantly related to fish, being in separate phyla. The gelatinous structure of jellyfish is similar to gelatin dessert.
* A peanut is not a nut in the botanical sense, but a legume. A coconut is not a botanical nut but a drupe.
* Fruits that are not botanically considered berries include strawberries, bayberries, raspberries, and blackberries.
=== Association with place other than that which one may assume ===

* The guinea pig (&quot;Cavia porcellus&quot;) originated in the Andes, not Guinea, and is a rodent unrelated to pigs.
* French horns originated in Germany, not France.
* Chinese checkers originated in Germany.
=== Other ===
* Although dry cleaning does not involve water, it does involve the use of liquid solvents.
* The &quot;funny bone&quot; is not a bone—the phrase refers to the ulnar nerve.
* A quantum leap is properly an instantaneous change that may be large or small. In physics, it is a change of an electron from one energy level to another. In common usage the term is often used to mean a large, abrupt change.
* &quot;Tennis elbow&quot; (formally &quot;lateral epicondylitis&quot;) does not necessarily result from playing tennis.

<doc id="507854" wikidata="Q865098" url="?curid=507854" title="Helium flash">
<text>A helium flash is a very brief thermal runaway nuclear fusion of large quantities of helium into carbon through the triple-alpha process in the core of low-mass stars (between 0.8 solar masses () and 2.0 ) during their red giant phase. The Sun is predicted to experience a flash 1.2 billion years after it leaves the main sequence. A much rarer runaway helium fusion process can also occur on the surface of accreting white dwarf stars.

Low-mass stars do not produce enough gravitational pressure to initiate normal helium fusion. As the hydrogen in the core is exhausted, some of the helium left behind is instead compacted into degenerate matter, supported against gravitational collapse by quantum mechanical pressure rather than thermal pressure. Subsequent hydrogen shell fusion further increases the mass of the core until it reaches temperature of approximately 100 million kelvin, which is hot enough to initiate helium fusion (or &quot;helium burning&quot;) in the core.

However, a quality of degenerate matter is that increases in temperature do not produce an increase in the pressure of the matter until the thermal pressure becomes so very high that it exceeds degeneracy pressure. In main sequence stars, thermal expansion regulates the core temperature, but in degenerate cores, this does not occur. Helium fusion increases the temperature, which increases the fusion rate, which further increases the temperature in a runaway reaction which quickly spans the entire core. This produces a flash of very intense helium fusion that lasts only a few minutes, but during that time, produces energy at a rate comparable to the entire Milky Way galaxy.

In the case of normal low-mass stars, the vast energy release causes much of the core to come out of degeneracy, allowing it to thermally expand. This consumes most of the total energy released by the helium flash, and any left-over energy is absorbed into the star&#x27;s upper layers. Thus the helium flash is mostly undetectable by observation, and is described solely by astrophysical models. After the core&#x27;s expansion and cooling, the star&#x27;s surface rapidly cools and contracts in as little as 10,000 years until it is roughly 2% of its former radius and luminosity. It is estimated that the electron-degenerate helium core weighs about 40% of the star mass and that 6% of the core is converted into carbon.

==Subflashes==
Subflashes are pulsational instabilities that occur after the main helium flash. They are driven by stars that do not have good convective or radiative boundaries. Subflashes can last several hours to days and can occur for many years with each subsequent flash generally being weaker. Subflashes can be detected by applying fourier transforms to the light curve data.

==Red giants==

During the red giant phase of stellar evolution in stars with less than 2.0 the nuclear fusion of hydrogen ceases in the core as it is depleted, leaving a helium-rich core. While fusion of hydrogen continues in the star&#x27;s shell causing a continuation of the accumulation of helium in the core, making the core denser, the temperature is still unable to reach the level required for helium fusion, as happens in more massive stars. Thus the thermal pressure from fusion is no longer sufficient to counter the gravitational collapse and create the hydrostatic equilibrium found in most stars. This causes the star to start contracting and increasing in temperature until it eventually becomes compressed enough for the helium core to become degenerate matter. This degeneracy pressure is finally sufficient to stop further collapse of the most central material but the rest of the core continues to contract and the temperature continues to rise until it reaches a point () at which the helium can ignite and start to fuse.

The explosive nature of the helium flash arises from its taking place in degenerate matter. Once the temperature reaches 100 million–200 million kelvin and helium fusion begins using the triple-alpha process, the temperature rapidly increases, further raising the helium fusion rate and, because degenerate matter is a good conductor of heat, widening the reaction region.

However, since degeneracy pressure (which is purely a function of density) is dominating thermal pressure (proportional to the product of density and temperature), the total pressure is only weakly dependent on temperature. Thus, the dramatic increase in temperature only causes a slight increase in pressure, so there is no stabilizing cooling expansion of the core.

This runaway reaction quickly climbs to about 100 billion times the star&#x27;s normal energy production (for a few seconds) until the temperature increases to the point that thermal pressure again becomes dominant, eliminating the degeneracy. The core can then expand and cool down and a stable burning of helium will continue.

A star with mass greater than about 2.25 starts to burn helium without its core becoming degenerate, and so does not exhibit this type of helium flash. In a very low-mass star (less than about 0.5 ), the core is never hot enough to ignite helium. The degenerate helium core will keep on contracting, and finally becomes a helium white dwarf.

The helium flash is not directly observable on the surface by electromagnetic radiation. The flash occurs in the core deep inside the star, and the net effect will be that all released energy is absorbed by the entire core, causing the degenerate state to become nondegenerate. Earlier computations indicated that a nondisruptive mass loss would be possible in some cases, but later star modeling taking neutrino energy loss into account indicates no such mass loss.

In a one solar mass star, the helium flash is estimated to release about , or about 0.3% of the energy release of a type Ia supernova, which is triggered by an analogous ignition of carbon fusion in a carbon–oxygen white dwarf.

==Binary white dwarfs==

When hydrogen gas is accreted onto a &quot;white dwarf&quot; from a binary companion star, the hydrogen can fuse to form helium for a narrow range of accretion rates, but most systems develop a layer of hydrogen over the degenerate white dwarf interior. This hydrogen can build up to form a shell near the surface of the star. When the mass of hydrogen becomes sufficiently large, runaway fusion causes a nova. In a few binary systems where the hydrogen fuses on the surface, the mass of helium built up can burn in an unstable helium flash. In certain binary systems the companion star may have lost most of its hydrogen and donate helium-rich material to the compact star. Note that similar flashes occur on neutron stars.

==Helium shell flash==
Helium shell flashes are a somewhat analogous but much less violent, nonrunaway helium ignition event, taking place in the absence of degenerate matter. They occur periodically in asymptotic giant branch stars in a shell outside the core. This is late in the life of a star in its giant phase. The star has burnt most of the helium available in the core, which is now composed of carbon and oxygen. Helium fusion continues in a thin shell around this core, but then turns off as helium becomes depleted. This allows hydrogen fusion to start in a layer above the helium layer. After enough additional helium accumulates, helium fusion is reignited, leading to a thermal pulse which eventually causes the star to expand and brighten temporarily (the pulse in luminosity is delayed because it takes a number of years for the energy from restarted helium fusion to reach the surface). Such pulses may last a few hundred years, and are thought to occur periodically every 10,000 to 100,000 years. 
After the flash, helium fusion continues at an exponentially decaying rate for about 40% of the cycle as the helium shell is consumed. Thermal pulses may cause a star to shed circumstellar shells of gas and dust.

<text>The Mercedes-Benz CLS (initially called the CLS-Class) is a series of executive cars produced by Mercedes-Benz from December 2003 to August 2023.

The original model was a four-door sedan based on the Mercedes E-Class platform, marketed as a four door coupé. An estate (shooting brake) model was later added to the model range with the second generation CLS. All models are available as a high performance AMG variant, although it wasn&#x27;t until the second generation CLS that 4MATIC all-wheel drive was offered.

The CLS range is positioned between the E-Class and the S-Class within the Mercedes model range, and models tend to be less practical than the E-Class it is based on. It primarily competes with other fastback sedans like the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe, Porsche Panamera and Audi A7. Production of the CLS ended on 31 August 2023 to prepare for the launch of the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W214).

== First generation (C219; 2004)==
Marketed from Mercedes as a four-door coupé, the CLS was designed by Michael Fink in 2001 who also styled the first generation CLK, the C-SportCoupé, and Maybach 57 and 62. In Europe, the CLS is recognized as a four-seat coupé and justly named the C219, while in the US, it is commonly referred to as the W219. The C219 CLS is based on the W211 E-Class platform, and shares major components including the engines, transmissions, and has an identical wheelbase of . IVM Automotive, a subsidiary of German roof system specialist Edscha, developed the entire vehicle from the Vision CLS concept on which the CLS is based, to the production version which debuted at the 2004 New York International Auto Show.
== Second generation (C218; 2010)==
The C218 CLS is the second generation model, and was sold from 2011 to 2018. The body styles of the range are a 4-door coupé (C218 model code for Europe/ W218 for US market), and a 5-door estate (X218 model code, marketed as &#x27;Shooting Brake&#x27;). The design of the CLS was based on the Mercedes F800 concept and featured design cues from other models including the Mercedes SLS AMG. Unlike its predecessor, the C218 CLS is available with all-wheel drive and can be optionally configured on CLS 63 AMG models as well. In 2014, the CLS underwent a facelift and featured design changes, engine enhancements, and the adoption of the Mercedes 9G-Tronic automatic transmission.

== Third generation (C257; 2018)==

The C257 CLS is the third model and was previously available only as a four-door coupe and in rear-wheel or all-wheel drive (4MATIC) configuration. The Shooting Brake body style was in development for the C257 CLS, but was shortly discontinued due to poor and declining demand overseas for the last generation model. The range of engines consist of a 2.9-litre straight six turbocharged diesel engine and a 3.0-litre straight six turbocharged petrol engine. The latter equips the CLS 53 AMG with features such as a mild hybrid system and an Panamericana radiator grille, which pays tribute to 300 SL model. The CLS is also now a five-seater car, instead of being a four-seater as with the previous two generations.

<doc id="507859" wikidata="Q380171" url="?curid=507859" title="Louis Slotin">
<text>Louis Alexander Slotin ( ; 1 December 1910 – 30 May 1946) was a Canadian physicist and chemist who took part in the Manhattan Project. Born and raised in the North End of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Slotin earned both his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees from the University of Manitoba, before obtaining his doctorate in physical chemistry at King&#x27;s College London in 1936. Afterwards, he joined the University of Chicago as a research associate to help design a cyclotron.

In 1942, Slotin was invited to participate in the Manhattan Project, and subsequently performed experiments with uranium and plutonium cores to determine their critical mass values. After World War II he continued his research at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. On 21 May 1946, he accidentally triggered a fission reaction which released a burst of hard radiation. He was rushed to the hospital and died nine days later on 30 May. Slotin had become the second fatal victim of a criticality accident in history, following Harry Daghlian, who had died of a related accident with the same plutonium &quot;demon core&quot; the previous year.

Slotin was hailed as a hero by the United States government for reacting quickly enough to prevent the deaths of his colleagues. However, some physicists argue that Slotin&#x27;s behavior preceding the accident was reckless and that his death was preventable. The accident and its aftermath have been dramatized in several fictional and non-fiction accounts.

== Early life ==
Louis Slotin was the first of three children born to Israel and Sonia Slotin, Yiddish-speaking Jewish refugees who had fled the pogroms of Russia to Winnipeg, Manitoba. He grew up in the North End neighborhood of Winnipeg, an area with a large concentration of Eastern European immigrants. From his early days at Machray Elementary School through his teenage years at St. John&#x27;s High School, Slotin was academically exceptional. His younger brother, Sam, later remarked that his brother &quot;had an extreme intensity that enabled him to study long hours.&quot;

At age 16, Slotin entered the University of Manitoba to pursue a degree in science. During his undergraduate years, he received a University Gold Medal in both physics and chemistry. Slotin received a B.Sc. degree in geology from the university in 1932 and a M.Sc. degree in 1933. With the assistance of one of his mentors, he obtained a fellowship to study at King&#x27;s College London under the supervision of Arthur John Allmand, the chair of the chemistry department, who specialized in the field of applied electrochemistry and photochemistry.

=== King&#x27;s College London ===
While at King&#x27;s College London, Slotin distinguished himself as an amateur boxer by winning the college&#x27;s amateur bantamweight boxing championship. Later, he gave the impression that he had fought for the Spanish Republic and trained to fly a fighter with the Royal Air Force. Author Robert Jungk recounted in his book &quot;Brighter than a Thousand Suns: A Personal History of the Atomic Scientists&quot;, an early history of the Manhattan Project, that Slotin &quot;had volunteered for service in the Spanish Civil War, more for the sake of the thrill of it than on political grounds. He had often been in extreme danger as an anti-aircraft gunner.&quot; During an interview years later, Sam stated that his brother had gone &quot;on a walking tour in Spain&quot; and he &quot;did not take part in the war&quot; as previously thought.

Slotin earned a Ph.D. degree in physical chemistry from King&#x27;s College London in 1936. He won a prize for his thesis entitled &quot;An Investigation into the Intermediate Formation of Unstable Molecules During some Chemical Reactions.&quot; Afterwards, he spent six months working as a special investigator for Dublin&#x27;s Great Southern Railways, testing the Drumm nickel-zinc rechargeable batteries used on the Dublin–Bray line.

== Career ==
=== University of Chicago ===
In 1937, after he unsuccessfully applied for a job with Canada&#x27;s National Research Council, the University of Chicago accepted Slotin as a research associate. There, he gained his first experience with nuclear chemistry, helping to build the first cyclotron in the midwestern United States. The job paid poorly and Slotin&#x27;s father had to support him for two years. From 1939 to 1940, Slotin collaborated with Earl Evans, the head of the university&#x27;s biochemistry department, to produce radiocarbon (carbon-14 and carbon-11) from the cyclotron. While working together, the two men also used carbon11 to demonstrate that plant cells had the capacity to use carbon dioxide for carbohydrate synthesis, through carbon fixation.

Slotin might have been present at the start-up of Enrico Fermi&#x27;s &quot;Chicago Pile-1&quot;, the first nuclear reactor, on 2 December 1942; the accounts of the event do not agree on this point. During this time, he also contributed to several papers in the field of radiobiology. His expertise on the subject garnered the attention of the United States government, and as a result he was invited to join the Manhattan Project, an effort to develop an atomic bomb. Slotin worked on the production of plutonium under future Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner at the university and later at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. He moved to the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico in December 1944 to work in the bomb physics group of Robert Bacher.

== Work at Los Alamos ==
At Los Alamos, Slotin&#x27;s duties consisted of dangerous criticality testing, first with uranium in Otto Robert Frisch&#x27;s experiments, and later with plutonium cores. Criticality testing involved bringing masses of fissile materials to near-critical levels to establish their critical mass values. Scientists referred to this flirting with the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction as &quot;tickling the dragon&#x27;s tail&quot;, based on a remark by physicist Richard Feynman, who compared the experiments to &quot;tickling the tail of a sleeping dragon&quot;. On 16 July 1945, Slotin assembled the core for Trinity, the first detonated atomic device, and became known as the &quot;chief armorer of the United States&quot; for his expertise in assembling nuclear weapons. Slotin received two small circular lead and silver commemorative pins for his work on the project.
In the winter of 1945–1946, Slotin shocked some of his colleagues with a bold action by repairing an instrument under water inside the Clinton Pile while it was operating, rather than wait an extra day for the reactor to be shut down. He did not wear his dosimetry badge, but his dose was estimated to be at least 100 roentgen. A dose of 1 Gy (≈100 roentgen) can cause nausea and vomiting in 10% of cases, but is generally survivable.

=== Harry Daghlian&#x27;s death ===
On 21 August 1945, laboratory assistant Harry Daghlian, one of Slotin&#x27;s close colleagues, was performing a criticality experiment when he accidentally dropped a heavy tungsten carbide brick onto a plutonium–gallium alloy bomb core, later nicknamed demon core, which would later also kill Slotin. The 24-year-old Daghlian was irradiated with a large dose of neutron radiation. Later estimates suggested that this dose might not have been fatal on its own, but he then received additional delayed gamma radiation and beta burns while disassembling his experiment. He quickly collapsed with acute radiation poisoning and died 25 days later in the Los Alamos base hospital.

=== Planned return to teaching ===
After World War II, Slotin expressed growing disdain for his personal involvement in the project. He remarked, &quot;I have become involved in the Navy tests, much to my disgust.&quot; Unfortunately for Slotin, his participation at Los Alamos was still required because, as he said, &quot;I am one of the few people left here who are experienced bomb putter-togetherers.&quot; He looked forward to resuming teaching and research into biophysics and radiobiology at the University of Chicago. He began training a replacement, Alvin C. Graves, to take over his role at Los Alamos.

=== Criticality accident ===

On 21 May 1946, with seven colleagues watching, Slotin performed an experiment that involved the creation of one of the first steps of a fission reaction by placing two half-spheres of beryllium (a neutron reflector) around a plutonium core. The experiment used the same plutonium core that had irradiated Daghlian, later called the &quot;demon core&quot; for its role in the two accidents. Slotin grasped the upper 228.6 mm (9-inch) beryllium hemisphere with his left hand through a thumb hole at the top while he maintained the separation of the half-spheres using the blade of a screwdriver with his right hand, having removed the shims normally used. Using a screwdriver was not a normal part of the experimental protocol.

At 3:20 p.m., the screwdriver slipped and the upper beryllium hemisphere fell, causing a &quot;prompt critical&quot; reaction and a burst of hard radiation. Scientists observed the blue glow of air ionization and felt a heat wave. Slotin experienced a sour taste in his mouth and an intense burning sensation in his left hand. He jerked his left hand upward, lifting the upper beryllium hemisphere, and dropped it to the floor, ending the reaction. He had already been exposed to a lethal dose of neutron radiation. At the time of the accident, dosimetry badges were in a locked box about from where the reaction occurred. Realizing that no one in the room had their film badges on, &quot;immediately after the accident Dr. Slotin asked Dr. Raemer E. Schreiber to have the badges taken from the lead box and placed on the critical assembly&quot;. This peculiar response was of no value for determining the actual doses received by the men in the room and put Schreiber at &quot;great personal risk&quot; of additional exposure. A report later concluded that a heavy dose of radiation may produce vertigo and can leave a person &quot;in no condition for rational behavior.&quot; As soon as Slotin left the building he vomited, a common reaction from exposure to extremely intense ionizing radiation. Slotin&#x27;s colleagues rushed him to the hospital, but the radiation damage was irreversible.

The six other men present at the time of the reaction included Alvin Cushman Graves, Samuel Allan Kline, Marion Edward Cieslicki, Dwight Smith Young, Theodore P. Perlman, and Pvt. Patrick J. Cleary. By 25 May 1946, four of these seven men had been discharged from hospital. The United States Army physician responsible for the Los Alamos base hospital, Captain Paul Hageman, said that Slotin&#x27;s, Graves&#x27;, Kline&#x27;s and Young&#x27;s &quot;immediate condition is satisfactory.&quot;

==== Slotin&#x27;s death ====
Despite intensive medical care and offers from numerous volunteers to donate blood for transfusions, Slotin&#x27;s condition was incurable. He called his parents and they were flown at Army expense from Winnipeg to be with him. They arrived on the fourth day after the incident, and by the fifth day his condition started to deteriorate rapidly.

Over the next four days, Slotin suffered an &quot;agonizing sequence of radiation-induced traumas&quot;, including severe diarrhea, reduced urine output, swollen hands, erythema, &quot;massive blisters on his hands and forearms&quot;, intestinal paralysis and gangrene. He had internal radiation burns throughout his body, which one medical expert described as a &quot;three-dimensional sunburn.&quot; By the seventh day, he was experiencing periods of &quot;mental confusion.&quot; His lips turned blue and he was put in an oxygen tent. He ultimately experienced &quot;a total disintegration of bodily functions&quot; and slipped into a coma. Slotin died at 11 a.m. on 30 May, in the presence of his parents. He was buried in the Shaarey Zedek Cemetery in Winnipeg on 2 June 1946.

==== Other injuries and death ====
Graves, Kline and Young remained hospitalized after Slotin&#x27;s death. Graves, who was standing the closest to Slotin, also developed acute radiation sickness and was hospitalized for several weeks. He survived, although he lived with chronic neurological and vision problems. Young also suffered from acute radiation syndrome, but recovered. By 28 January 1948 Graves, Kline and Perlman sought compensation for damages suffered during the incident. Graves settled his claim for $3,500 (or about $ today, adjusted for inflation).

Three of the observers eventually died of conditions that are known to be promoted by radiation: Graves of a heart attack twenty years later at age 55, Cieslicki of acute myeloid leukemia nineteen years later at age 42, and Young of aplastic anemia and bacterial infection of the heart lining, twenty-nine years later, at age 83. Some of the deaths may have been a consequence of the incident. Louis Hempelman, M.D., a consultant to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, believed that it is not possible to establish a causal relation between the incident and the specifics of the death from such a small sample. He stated this opinion in a publicly available report that included personal medical information which he had previously declined to release to Cieslicki during the final stages of his illness.

==== Disposal of core ====
The core involved was intended to be used in the Able detonation, during the Crossroads series of nuclear weapons testing. Slotin&#x27;s experiment was said to be the last conducted before the core&#x27;s detonation and was intended to be the final demonstration of its ability to go critical. After the accident, it needed time to cool. It was therefore rescheduled for the third test of the series, provisionally named &quot;Charlie&quot;, but this was cancelled due to the unexpected level of radioactivity after the underwater &quot;Baker&quot; test and the inability to decontaminate the target warships. The core was eventually melted down and its material reused in a later core.

=== Radiation dosage ===
The radiation doses received in these two accidents are not known with any accuracy. A large part of the dose was due to neutron radiation, which could not be measured by dosimetry equipment of the day. The available film badges were not worn by personnel during the accident, and badges that were supposed to be planted under tables in case of disasters like these were not found. Disaster badges hung on the walls provided some useful data about gamma radiation.

A &quot;tentative&quot; estimate of the doses involved was made in 1948, based on dozens of assumptions, some of which are now known to be incorrect. In the absence of personal dosimetry badges, the study authors relied on measurements of sodium activation in the victims&#x27; blood and urine samples as their primary source of data. This activation would have been caused by neutron radiation, but they converted all doses to equivalent doses of gamma or X-ray radiation. They concluded that Daghlian and Slotin had probably received doses equivalent to and , respectively, of gamma rays. Minimum and maximum estimates varied from about 50% to 200% of these values. The authors also calculated doses equivalent to a mix of soft 80 keV X-rays and gamma rays, which they believed gave a more realistic picture of the exposure than the gamma equivalent. In this model, the equivalent X-ray doses were much higher, but would be concentrated in the tissues facing the source, whereas the gamma component penetrated the whole body. Slotin&#x27;s equivalent dose was estimated to be 1930 R (roentgen) of X-ray with 114 R of gamma, while Daghlian&#x27;s equivalent dose was estimated to be 480 R of X-ray with 110 R of gamma. Five hundred roentgen equivalent man (rem) is usually a fatal exposure for humans.

In modern times, dosimetry is done very differently. Equivalent doses would not be reported in roentgen; they would be calculated with different weighting factors, and they are not considered as relevant to acute radiation syndrome as absorbed doses. Recent documents have made various interpretations of Slotin&#x27;s dose, ranging from to . Based on citations and supporting reasoning, the most reliable estimate may be a 1978 Los Alamos memo which suggested 10 Gy(n) + 1.14 Gy(γ) for Slotin and 2 Gy(n) + 1.1 Gy(γ) for Daghlian. These doses are consistent with the symptoms they experienced.

== Legacy ==
After the accident, Los Alamos ended all hands-on critical assembly work. Subsequent criticality testing of fissile cores was done with remotely controlled machines, such as the &quot;Godiva&quot; series, with the operator located a safe distance away to prevent harm in case of accidents.

On 14 June 1946, the associate editor of the &quot;Los Alamos Times&quot;, Thomas P. Ashlock, penned a poem entitled &quot;Slotin – A Tribute&quot;:

The official story released at the time was that Slotin, by quickly removing the upper hemisphere, was a hero for ending the reaction and protecting seven other observers in the room: &quot;Dr. Slotin&#x27;s quick reaction at the immediate risk of his own life prevented a more serious development of the experiment which would certainly have resulted in the death of the seven men working with him, as well as serious injury to others in the general vicinity.&quot; This interpretation of events was endorsed at the time by Graves, who stood closest to Slotin when the accident occurred. Graves, like Slotin, had previously displayed a low concern for nuclear safety and later alleged that fallout risks were &quot;concocted in the minds of weak malingerers.&quot; Schreiber, another witness to the accident, spoke out publicly decades later, arguing that Slotin was using improper and unsafe procedures, endangering the others in the lab along with himself. Robert B. Brode had reported hearsay to that effect back in 1946.

Slotin&#x27;s accident is echoed in the 1947 film &quot;The Beginning or the End&quot;, in which a scientist assembling the bomb destined for Hiroshima dies after coming into contact with radioactive material.
It was recounted in Dexter Masters&#x27; 1955 novel &quot;The Accident&quot;, a fictional account of the last few days of the life of a nuclear scientist suffering from radiation poisoning. Depictions of the criticality incident include the 1989 film &quot;Fat Man and Little Boy&quot;, in which John Cusack plays a fictional character named Michael Merriman based on Slotin, and the &quot;Louis Slotin Sonata&quot;, a 2001 off-Broadway play directed by David P. Moore.

In 1948, Slotin&#x27;s colleagues at Los Alamos and the University of Chicago initiated the &quot;Louis A. Slotin Memorial Fund&quot; for lectures on physics given by distinguished scientists such as Robert Oppenheimer, Luis Walter Alvarez, Hans Bethe. The memorial fund lasted until 1962. In 2002, an asteroid discovered in 1995 was named 12423 Slotin in his honour.

=== Dollar unit of reactivity ===
According to Weinberg and Wigner, Slotin was the first to propose the name dollar for the interval of reactivity between delayed and prompt criticality; 0 is the point of self-sustaining chain reaction, a dollar is the point at which slowly released, delayed neutrons are no longer required to support chain reaction, and enters the domain called &quot;prompt critical&quot;. Stable nuclear reactors operate between 0 and a dollar; excursions and nuclear explosives operate above a dollar. The hundredth part of a dollar is called a cent. When speaking of purely prompt critical events, some users refer to cents &quot;over critical&quot; as a relative unit.

<text>John James &quot;Jolly Jack&quot; Adams (June 14, 1894 – May 1, 1968) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player, coach, and general manager in the National Hockey League and Pacific Coast Hockey Association. He played for the Toronto Arenas, Vancouver Millionaires, Toronto St. Patricks and Ottawa Senators between 1917 and 1927. He won the Stanley Cup twice as a player, with Toronto in 1918 and Ottawa in 1927, and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.

After retiring Adams began a 36-year association with the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League as head coach and as a general manager. He held the record of the winningest coach in Red Wings history until 2014. He later became the first president of the Central Professional Hockey League. Adams won the Stanley Cup a further seven times with the Red Wings and is the only person to have won the Stanley Cup as a player, coach, and general manager.

==Playing career==
Born in Fort William, Ontario, Jack Adams began his career with the Fort William Maple Leafs in 1914 of the NMHL and then played for the Calumet Miners a year later. In 1916, he joined the intermediate Peterborough 247th Battalion of the Ontario Hockey Association and the next season moved up to the senior Sarnia Sailors. His younger brother Bill also was a professional hockey player, with the Regina Capitals and the Vancouver Millionaires.

Adams turned pro in 1917 upon joining the Toronto Arenas of the NHL for the 1917–18, earning the reputation as a physical, bruising player. Although he participated in the NHL playoffs, he did not play in any games in the 1918 Stanley Cup Finals against the Vancouver Millionaires when the Torontos won the trophy.

In March 1918 he was drafted into the Canadian military as part of the First World War, and was sent to the United Kingdom in April. He was discharged that November as the war ended and returned to Canada shortly after.

In December 1919 he was moved west alongside his brother Bill to join the Vancouver Millionaires, where he flourished as a player, leading the league in scoring in 1921–22, when he centred a line with Alf Skinner and Smokey Harris. The February 26, 1922 issue of the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;, commenting on Adams&#x27; playing style, complimented him on his strong hands and his ability to shield and hold onto the puck against several checking opponents, as well as his ability to &quot;bore through&quot; the opposing defense. He played in two Stanley Cup series for Vancouver, and was the star of the 1922 series, scoring 6 goals in 5 games.

Coming off that 1921–22 season, he returned east to rejoin the Toronto Arenas, now renamed the Toronto St. Patricks, and played four seasons on a line with right-winger Babe Dye. Adams was the team&#x27;s leading scorer in 1925–26.

The next season, he joined the Ottawa Senators, finishing his playing career as it began, with a second Stanley Cup championship. His NHL stats included 83 goals, 32 assists in 173 games played.

Adams was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1959 as a player.

==Coaching and managing career==
Soon after his retirement, he became coach and general manager of the second-year Detroit Cougars at the suggestion of NHL president Frank Calder.

At first, the team struggled under his leadership, making the playoffs only two times in his first five years at the helm. A name change to the Detroit Falcons in 1930 did not improve the team&#x27;s performance. Detroit&#x27;s fortunes changed in 1932, when Chicago grain merchant James E. Norris bought the Falcons and renamed them the Detroit Red Wings. Norris gave the Red Wings the financing they needed to become an NHL power. Adams led the team to three Stanley Cups before stepping down in 1947 to concentrate on his duties as general manager. His coaching career tallied 413 wins, 390 losses, and 161 ties, including a 52–52–1 coaching record in the playoffs. Most of those wins came without a contract; when Norris bought the team he&#x27;d torn up Adams&#x27; contract and given him a year on his job on probation and a handshake. As it turned out, one year became 15 years. He was the winningest coach in Red Wings history until Mike Babcock passed him late in the 2013-14 season.

By 1947, Adams had built a farm system that produced Alex Delvecchio, Terry Sawchuk, Ted Lindsay, Red Kelly, Sid Abel, and most notably Gordie Howe. It was this core group of players that led the Red Wings to seven straight regular-season first-place finishes from 1948 to 1955, along with four more Cups—making Adams the only man to have his name on the Stanley Cup as a player, coach, and general manager.

Adams was known for being wary of letting his teams get complacent, and was not shy about orchestrating blockbuster trades to keep them on their toes—a philosophy which won him the nickname &quot;Trader Jack.&quot; His impulse was slightly restrained after Norris died in 1952 and was succeeded by his daughter, Marguerite Norris. She and Adams never got along very well. While she could have summarily fired Adams since he was still without a contract, she did not do so.

However, Marguerite was forced to turn over control of the team to her younger brother, Bruce Norris, in 1955 after losing an intrafamily struggle. Bruce voiced full confidence in Adams, and the trading resumed anew. During their seven-season run in first place, many thought the Red Wings would rule the league for years to come. However, just days after Bruce took over the presidency, Adams traded away eight players from the 1955 champions. Years later, Howe wrote that Adams&#x27; reasoning for the trades still &quot;def(ied) explanation,&quot; and argued that the trades opened the door for the Montreal Canadiens to win five Cups in a row (and nine in 14 years). Although the Red Wings remained competitive until the late 1960s, Howe believed the trades &quot;sapped us of the firepower we needed to win another championship.&quot;

In 1957, Adams traded Ted Lindsay to Chicago because of union-organizing efforts and had other players affiliated with the effort sent to the minors. As part of the union busting efforts, Adams spread fake rumours attributing Lindsay as criticizing his former teammates. Adams also showed a fake contract to Detroit reporters, claiming Lindsay was being paid $25,000 per year, when he was being paid $12,000.

The efforts resulted in most of the core of this team leaving town and eventually led to Adams being fired in 1963. His 36-year tenure as general manager is the longest in NHL history. He served 31 of those years while still on probation; after 1932 he never signed a contract with the Wings. His ouster from the Red Wings also ended 46 consecutive years at the major league level in hockey.

Adams had also been involved in an incident in 1942, when he had an outburst due to his belief of biased penalty calling, which led to a fit of rage and ultimately a referee getting punched in game three of the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals, thus becoming the first coach to be suspended in a Final.

In 1963, Adams became founding president of the Central Hockey League, a post he held until his death at his desk in 1968.

<text>Gary Michael Karr (born November 20, 1941, in Los Angeles) is an American classical double bass virtuoso and teacher; he is considered one of the best bassists of the 20th and 21st centuries.

== Biography ==
Although he comes from several generations of bassists, he was not encouraged by them to go into music. In an interview with &quot;ActiveBass&quot; magazine he said that he has no contact with the professional bassists in his family.

After attending Fairfax High School and USC, Karr studied at the Aspen Music Festival and the Juilliard School, where his major teachers included Herman Reinshagen and Stuart Sankey. Karr&#x27;s breakthrough came in 1962, when he was featured as a soloist in a nationally televised New York Philharmonic Young People&#x27;s Concert, conducted by Leonard Bernstein. On that famous telecast, Karr performed &quot;The Swan&quot; from &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot; by Camille Saint-Saëns. Karr also recorded the piece with Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic.

He has since appeared as a soloist with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, London Philharmonic Orchestra, Montreal Symphony Orchestra, Hong Kong Philharmonic, Simon Bolivar Orchestra, Jerusalem Symphony, Oslo Philharmonic, Zurich Chamber Orchestra, and with all the major orchestras of Australia.

He has premiered new works written for him by Vittorio Giannini (Psalm CXX), Alec Wilder (Sonata for Double Bass and Piano and Suite for Double Bass and Guitar), Robert Xavier Rodriguez (Ursa, Four Seasons for Double Bass and Orchestra), and the concertos for double bass and orchestra by Gunther Schuller, Hans Werner Henze, John Downey and Ketil Hvoslef. He has recorded the Serge Koussevitzky concerto with Oslo Philharmonic.

He has taught double bass on the faculties of the Juilliard School, New England Conservatory of Music, The Hartt School, Yale University, Indiana University, University of North Carolina School of the Arts, and the Halifax (Nova Scotia) Schools Music Program and has published a number of instructional books for the double bass. He focuses on finding one&#x27;s unique sound on the double bass and approaching playing with the lyrical emphasis of a singer.

After 40 years as a concert artist he retired in 2001 to Victoria, British Columbia, where he lives with his dog Shin-Ju, and his dear friend and companion, fellow musician Harmon Lewis. Lewis died on January 11, 2013. 

== Foundations ==
In 1967 Karr founded the International Society of Bassists (ISB), an organization devoted to the study, promotion, and advancement of double bass playing around the world. The ISB, with a membership of more than 3,000 double bass performers, teachers, students, and aficionados in more than 40 countries, hosts an international conference biannually to further these goals.

Karr was featured in two BBC documentaries; The Great Double Bass Race in 1978, and Amazing Bass in 1984.

In 2005, Karr donated his primary instrument, the &quot;Karr-Koussevitzky&quot; bass, to the ISB. This instrument was given to Karr by Olga Koussevitzky, widow of Serge Koussevitzky, in 1961. It is the intention of the ISB to make this valuable instrument available for use by double bassists worldwide. The Karr-Koussevitzky bass was once believed to have been made by the Amati family and hence it is also referred to as the &quot;Amati&quot; bass.

The non-profit Karr Double Bass Foundation, which loans instruments to promising young double bassists to assist in their professional development, was established by Karr in 1984.

<doc id="507864" wikidata="Q207472" url="?curid=507864" title="Toto (band)">
<text>Toto is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1977. Toto combines elements of pop, rock, soul, funk, hard rock, R&amp;B, blues, and jazz. Having released 14 studio albums and sold over 50 million records worldwide, the group has received several Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2009.

David Paich (keyboards, vocals) and Jeff Porcaro (drums) had played together as session musicians on several albums and formed the band; David Hungate (bass), Steve Lukather (guitar, vocals), Steve Porcaro (keyboards, vocals), and Bobby Kimball (vocals) were recruited before the release of the band&#x27;s eponymous debut album in 1978. Led by the Top 5 single &quot;Hold the Line&quot;, the album brought the band to mainstream attention, though it was their fourth album &quot;Toto IV&quot; (1982) which brought them global attention. &quot;Africa&quot; topped the Billboard Hot 100, while &quot;Rosanna&quot; reached number 2, helping Toto become one of the best-selling music groups of their era.

Following &quot;Toto IV&quot;, two of the original members, Hungate and Kimball, departed the band. Hungate was replaced on bass by Mike Porcaro, while Kimball was replaced by a number of different short-term vocalists, the longest serving of which was Joseph Williams. After Jeff Porcaro&#x27;s death in 1992, he was replaced by Simon Phillips. While the band has not repeated the U.S. radio successes of their heyday in the late 1970s and early 1980s, they have continued to produce albums and tour more-or-less continuously to the current day, minus a few hiatuses, and have had many more top-ten albums and singles in places like Japan and Scandinavia. Steve Lukather remains the only original member who still records and tours with the band. Paich remains an official member of the band, though he has mostly retired from touring. Since the 2010s, the band has increasingly relied on contracted touring musicians to continue to perform. As of 2023, they have released fourteen studio albums, eight live albums, one movie soundtrack, 1984&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;, and a number of compilation albums. Their final release was 2018&#x27;s &quot;Old Is New&quot; before the band decided against recording any further studio albums. In 2024, Toto launched its &quot;Dogz of Oz&quot; Tour with its first date in Red Bank, New Jersey.

==History==
===1977–1979: Formation and debut album===

The members of Toto were regulars on albums by Steely Dan, Seals and Crofts, Boz Scaggs, Sonny and Cher, and many others, contributing to many of the most popular records of the 1970s. Keyboardist David Paich, son of musician and session player/arranger Marty Paich, rose to fame after having co-written much of Scaggs&#x27;s &quot;Silk Degrees&quot; album. David met drummer Jeff Porcaro, the son of session percussionist Joe Porcaro, while attending Grant High School, where they formed the band Rural Still Life. Years later, having played on many sessions together, the two began to seriously discuss the possibility of forming their own band.

They brought in bassist and fellow session veteran David Hungate, with whom they had played in the backing band for Scaggs. The duo asked fellow Grant High School students, guitarist Steve Lukather (who also played in Scaggs&#x27;s band as a replacement for Les Dudek) and Jeff Porcaro&#x27;s brother Steve Porcaro (keyboards) to join the team. Lukather and Steve Porcaro were in the same year at Grant and continued the band Rural Still Life (the name shortened to Still Life) after Paich and Jeff graduated. With the addition of former S.S. Fools singer Bobby Kimball, the group began to work on their first album in 1977 after signing with Columbia Records.

Once the band came together, David Paich began composing what would become the eponymous debut album, &quot;Toto&quot;. According to popular myth, at the first recording sessions, in order to distinguish their own demo tapes from other bands&#x27; in the studio, Jeff Porcaro wrote the word &quot;Toto&quot; on them. In the early 1980s, band members told the press that the band was named after Toto the dog from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. After the completion of the first album, the band and record were still unnamed. David Hungate, after viewing the name on the demo tapes, explained to the group that the Latin words &quot;in toto&quot; translated to &quot;all-encompassing&quot;. Because the band members played on so many records and so many musical genres, they adopted the name &quot;Toto&quot; as their own.

&quot;Toto&quot; climbed the charts quickly, earning popularity with the hit single &quot;Hold the Line&quot;, as well as the charting &quot;I&#x27;ll Supply the Love&quot; and &quot;Georgy Porgy&quot;, featuring Cheryl Lynn. Though the band was largely dismissed by music critics, it was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist. Shortly thereafter, in early 1979, Toto embarked on their first American tour in support of the debut album. For the tour, Toto brought along two additional musicians, Tom Kelly (guitar, backup vocals) and Lenny Castro (percussion), to increase the depth of the sound. Castro had appeared with the group on their first album as a session musician and continued to play on every one of their albums for the next 40 years in varying capacities, with the exception of &quot;Turn Back&quot;. The band continued to hire additional touring musicians for all subsequent tours. (See the &quot;Tour Musicians&quot; section below.)

===1979–1981: &quot;Hydra&quot; and &quot;Turn Back&quot;===
At the close of the first tour, the band began work on their next album, &quot;Hydra&quot;, which was released later that year and featured the single &quot;99&quot;, inspired by George Lucas&#x27; cult film&quot; THX 1138&quot;. Nearly 30 years later, Steve Lukather confessed that, despite the song&#x27;s popularity, he hated &quot;99&quot; and that it&#x27;s one of his least favorite Toto songs, which is why it was rarely performed after &quot;Hydra&quot;&#x27;s tour. The band also released four promotional music videos for the album, including the title track, &quot;99&quot;, &quot;St George and The Dragon&quot; and &quot;All Us Boys&quot;. They were directed by Bruce Gowers and produced by Paul Flattery for Jon Roseman Productions International. Although the album &quot;Hydra&quot; failed to achieve the commercial success of Toto&#x27;s first release, it still went gold. Following the album&#x27;s release, the band set out on the &quot;Hydra Tour&quot;, which featured both American and international dates. The tour lasted from February until June 1980.

In early 1981, Toto released their third album, &quot;Turn Back.&quot; The album was a venture into arena rock and featured heavier guitar and fewer keyboards than the previous two albums. Its disappointing chart performance and sales in almost every country except Japan and Norway put the band&#x27;s career into further jeopardy, as they had not had a hit single in North America in almost two years at that point. The unexpected success of the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Goodbye Elenore&quot; in Japan proved to be the band&#x27;s breakthrough there, and Japan has become a permanent staple of their touring schedule since.

===1982–1985: &quot;Toto IV&quot; and &quot;Isolation&quot;===


1982 marked the beginning of Toto&#x27;s most successful era. After the poor sales of &quot;Turn Back&quot;, the band was under a great deal of pressure from the record company to produce a new hit record, akin to their first. With the Triple Platinum-certified &quot;Toto IV&quot;, the band delivered one of the most commercially successful records of the year. The album featured three singles that reached the Top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart: &quot;Rosanna&quot;, &quot;Africa&quot; and &quot;I Won&#x27;t Hold You Back&quot;. The album appeared on several worldwide charts, introducing the band to new audiences around the globe. &quot;Africa&quot; topped the charts in February 1983 and was a constant presence on radios around the world, but it was &quot;Rosanna&quot; that earned the band multiple Grammy nominations. &quot;Toto IV&quot; earned six Grammy Awards, including &quot;Record of the Year&quot; for &quot;Rosanna&quot;, &quot;Album of the Year&quot; for &quot;Toto IV&quot; and &quot;Producer of the Year&quot;. At the time Steve Porcaro was dating actress Rosanna Arquette, but the song is not about her, according to writer David Paich.

In the music video for the song, Cynthia Rhodes plays the title character. In addition to &quot;Africa&quot; and &quot;Rosanna&quot;, &quot;Toto IV&quot; continued its successful run with the release of another single, &quot;Make Believe&quot;. Toto toured throughout 1982 in support of &quot;Toto IV&quot;. During this time, Steve Porcaro co-wrote and co-composed &quot;Human Nature&quot;, which Michael Jackson recorded for his best-selling album &quot;Thriller&quot; (1982), turning the song into a smash hit. Jeff Porcaro and Steve Lukather also appeared on &quot;Thriller&quot; on multiple tracks, most notably on Beat It and the Jackson/Paul McCartney duet &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;.

Directly after the release of &quot;Toto IV&quot;, bassist David Hungate left the band. Hungate, who had relocated to Nashville in 1980 to pursue a session/production career, felt that the fame surrounding &quot;Toto IV&quot; would prevent him from spending time with his family. A third Porcaro brother, Mike Porcaro, who had performed cello on a track from &quot;Toto IV&quot;, replaced Hungate on bass, while lead singer Bobby Kimball spent the early part of 1983 facing prosecution for drug-related charges. Kimball was ordered to stand trial, but pled not guilty. The charges were dismissed on May 28 of that year. However, Kimball was fired from the band in 1984 due to difficulty recording vocals and numerous missed sessions. Later that year, Toto composed most of the music for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Dune&quot;.

At one point, Richard Page of the band Mr. Mister was offered the lead singer spot, but turned it down to continue with his band. Fergie Frederiksen (formerly of bands Angel, Trillion and LeRoux) was brought in as the new vocalist and the band recorded &quot;Isolation&quot;, released in November 1984. While &quot;Isolation&quot; did not achieve the acclaim or sales of &quot;Toto IV&quot;, it did achieve Gold status, largely on the strength of the single &quot;Stranger in Town&quot;. &quot;Isolation&quot;″s tour began in February 1985 and concluded three months later.

===1985–1988: &quot;Fahrenheit&quot; and &quot;The Seventh One&quot; with Joseph Williams===
At the close of the &quot;Isolation&quot; tour in 1985, Fergie Frederiksen was let go. Lukather stated that the band was not meshing well with Frederiksen because he had a difficult time recording with them in the studio. The band held an audition and Joseph Williams, son of film composer John Williams and 1950s singer/actress Barbara Ruick, was chosen to take over lead vocals in early 1986.

With Joseph Williams now onboard officially, Toto wrote and recorded &quot;Fahrenheit&quot;, released in August 1986. While Williams performs lead vocals, Frederiksen had begun recording a few tracks before leaving the band, and he is featured as a background vocalist on the track &quot;Could This Be Love&quot;.

&quot;Fahrenheit&quot; brought the band back from the heavier sound of &quot;Isolation&quot; to their pop/rock roots. &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Over You&quot; and &quot;Without Your Love&quot;, which were both ballads sung by Lukather, were the two hit singles. The band recruited several guest musicians for the album. They recorded an instrumental piece entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot; with legendary jazz trumpeter Miles Davis. In addition, a then-unknown Paula Abdul appeared as a dancer in their &quot;Till the End&quot; music video. Michael McDonald provided backup vocals on the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Over You&quot; (and appeared in the accompanying music video), while Eagles founder and songwriting giant Don Henley appeared on the Steve Porcaro penned track &quot;Lea&quot;.

After the release of &quot;Fahrenheit&quot;, the band embarked on another world tour. Upon its conclusion in 1987, Steve Porcaro left the band to pursue a career in film and television scoring. &quot;Fahrenheit&quot; eventually went Gold on October 3, 1994. Steve Porcaro was never replaced and Toto decided to continue with only five members. Although Porcaro occasionally assisted the band on synthesizers for their subsequent studio albums and appeared on their 1988 tour, David Paich handled most of the live keyboard work, with keyboard technician John Jessel assisting on certain dates from 1989 onward.

In 1988 Toto released their next album &quot;The Seventh One&quot;, featuring Jon Anderson of Yes on backup vocals on the single &quot;Stop Loving You&quot;. The album&#x27;s other single, &quot;Pamela&quot;, became very popular and would be the band&#x27;s last to hit the US Top 40. &quot;The Seventh One&quot; became the band&#x27;s most successful release since &quot;Toto IV&quot;. The band toured from February through July 1988.

===1988–1990: &quot;Past to Present&quot; and Jean-Michel Byron===

Although &quot;The Seventh One Tour&quot; was very successful, after it was finished the band decided to replace lead singer Joseph Williams. Originally, the band wanted to reunite with original vocalist Bobby Kimball to record new songs for a greatest hits record, but the record company instead insisted they hire South African singer Jean-Michel Byron. Before Byron was brought in, the band recorded &quot;Goin&#x27; Home&quot; with Kimball. This song was later featured on the &quot;Toto XX&quot; album as an &quot;unreleased song&quot;. When Byron was brought in (in 1989) he and Toto recorded four new songs which were included on their greatest hits album &quot;Past to Present 1977–1990&quot;, released in 1990.

Toto then embarked upon the &quot;Planet Earth&quot; tour that lasted from September until December 1990. The band didn&#x27;t get along with Byron, whose diva-like behavior and flamboyant stage presence caused friction during the tour. He was demoted to background vocals before ultimately being fired at the conclusion of the tour. During this time, the band also found that former singer Bobby Kimball was booking shows and billing himself and his backing band as &quot;Toto&quot;. In April, mirroring the situation that had happened with Kimball seven years previously, former singer Joseph Williams was arrested on drug-related charges.

Lukather&#x27;s first solo album was released in 1989, named &quot;Lukather&quot;, and featured musicians such as Eddie Van Halen and Richard Marx.

===1991–1992: &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; and Jeff Porcaro&#x27;s death===
With Toto once again without a lead vocalist, guitarist Steve Lukather stepped in to sing lead vocals and became the band&#x27;s new front man. Toto played at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1991 and the band recorded &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot;, which was released on Columbia Records in most parts of the world and on Clive Davis&#x27; label Relativity Records in the United States.

Jeff Porcaro died unexpectedly on August 5, 1992, at the age of 38 while working in his garden. According to the Los Angeles Times Report, the Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s office lists the cause of death to be a heart attack from the hardening of the arteries caused by cocaine use. Facing the prospect of a tour without Jeff, Toto almost broke up. However, Jeff Porcaro&#x27;s family insisted the band continue. The band contacted Los Angeles-based Englishman Simon Phillips to replace Jeff Porcaro as they knew that Porcaro liked Phillips alongside Vinnie Colaiuta and Gregg Bissonette and because Lukather worked with Phillips on a previous tour with Santana and Jeff Beck in Japan in 1986.

Phillips joined the band and they went on the tour, which they dedicated to Jeff&#x27;s memory. In 1993 they released a live album called &quot;Absolutely Live.&quot; From 1991 on, Steve Lukather would handle a majority of the vocals (until Bobby Kimball&#x27;s return in 1998), but some older songs originally sung by Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams were put in the set list and sung by new backup singers Fred White (who was replaced by John James in 1992), Jackie McGee, who had joined for the 1990 tour and was replaced by Donna McDaniel in 1992, and Jenny Douglas-McRae, who came aboard in 1990. Douglas-McRae formerly served as an actress as the librarian in the band&#x27;s 1982 &quot;Africa&quot; music video. James sang &quot;Stop Loving You&quot; and Kimball&#x27;s part on &quot;Rosanna&quot;, McDaniel sang &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; and &quot;Angel Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, and Douglas-McRae sang &quot;Hold the Line&quot;.

On December 14, 1992, the Tribute to Jeff Porcaro Concert was held at Universal City&#x27;s Universal Amphitheatre. Performers including Don Henley, Eddie Van Halen, Donald Fagen, Walter Becker, Boz Scaggs, James Newton Howard, Michael McDonald, David Crosby and special guest George Harrison performed various Toto songs along with the four remaining Toto members. At the close of the tour, the band then took a break to pursue individual projects as well as to keep up their session schedules.

From March to November 1993, Lukather and Phillips teamed up with friends David Garfield and John Pena on the side project Los Lobotomys and recorded the album &quot;Candyman&quot;.

===1995–1997: Addition of Simon Phillips and &quot;Tambu&quot;===
In 1995 Toto recorded &quot;Tambu&quot;, their first album with Simon Phillips, which saw the band back with CBS (now Sony). A departure from Toto&#x27;s sound of the late 1970s and 1980s, &quot;Tambu&quot; was a very organic release and featured the single &quot;I Will Remember&quot;, which received moderate radio play. Other singles released were &quot;Drag Him To The Roof&quot; and &quot;The Turning Point&quot;. &quot;Tambu&quot; also featured John James and Jenny Douglas-McRae as backup singers on some of the tracks. Douglas-McRae even sang lead on the album&#x27;s bonus track, &quot;Blackeye&quot;, and also in a duet with Steve Lukather on &quot;Baby He&#x27;s Your Man&quot;. &quot;Tambu&quot; sold 600,000 copies worldwide.

The &quot;Tambu Tour&quot; proved to be another success, although there were no North American dates. Simon Phillips suffered from a back problem, so Gregg Bissonette had to fill in for him during the first leg of the tour in late 1995. The tour concluded in 1996. The rest of the tour personnel remained the same, with the exception of Donna McDaniel who had left in 1994 shortly after the &quot;Night of the Proms&quot; performances (which Douglas-McRae had missed since she was out touring with Joe Cocker). The song &quot;Hold the Line&quot; was now sung as a duet between James and Douglas-McRae.
Both James and Douglas-McRae were dropped from the band at the conclusion of the 1997 tour.

Lukather released his second solo album, &quot;Luke&quot;, which was a more &quot;introspective&quot; album than his previous solo album.

===1997–2001: &quot;Toto XX&quot;, Bobby Kimball&#x27;s return and &quot;Mindfields&quot;===
1997 marked the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary, and in order to commemorate it, David Paich and Steve Lukather started to go through several old tapes and demos for a special record of unreleased songs. In 1998 they released &quot;Toto XX&quot; with the single &quot;Goin&#x27; Home&quot;. Toto went on a small promotional tour with former members Bobby Kimball, Steve Porcaro and Joseph Williams.

After the &quot;Toto XX&quot; tour, Bobby Kimball rejoined the band as lead singer after 14 years. The band released &quot;Mindfields&quot; in early 1999 and embarked on the &quot;Reunion&quot; tour, touring worldwide and returning to the United States for the first time in six years. The new album featured three singles, &quot;Melanie&quot;, &quot;Cruel&quot; and &quot;Mad About You&quot;, a song co-written by David Paich and former vocalist Joseph Williams. Later that year, a live album titled &quot;Livefields&quot; was released. The tour officially concluded in 2000, but the band played a few shows throughout 2001. David Paich briefly took a break from touring in 2000, so Jeff Babko filled in on keyboards. Paich then resumed touring with Toto in 2001.

===2002–2003: &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; and Toto&#x27;s 25th anniversary===
In 2002, in celebration of Toto&#x27;s 25th anniversary, the band released &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;, a covers album that paid tribute to the band&#x27;s musical influences, such as Bob Marley, Steely Dan, The Beatles, and Elton John. Two singles were released: &quot;Could You Be Loved&quot;, a Bob Marley cover, and &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, a Beatles cover. The album was not a commercial success and many fans were upset about the release, thinking that the band should have written new material instead. However, the record gave the band material to promote their &quot;25th Anniversary Tour&quot;, which started in 2002 and concluded in 2003. After the tour, Toto released a live album and DVD of the show titled &quot;Live in Amsterdam&quot;. Both the live album and the DVD were released in late 2003.

===2003–2005: Greg Phillinganes joins and David Paich&#x27;s semi-retirement===

Beginning in June 2003, near the end of their &quot;25th Anniversary Tour&quot;, keyboardist David Paich took a leave of absence from touring to spend time with a sick family member. Veteran keyboardist Greg Phillinganes filled in for Paich for the rest of the tour.

In late 2003, Toto headlined Night of the Proms for two months straight. Paich returned but was only able to play for a few weeks before he had to leave again, so Phillinganes once again filled in for the remainder of the shows. After Simon Phillips announced he would be unable to play due to illness, Jon Fariss and Ricky Lawson joined the band for the Night of the Proms. In early 2004, the band embarked on a world tour that went throughout 2004 and 2005. Paich only occasionally appeared, with Phillinganes playing at most of the shows. In 2005, Phillinganes was asked to become a regular member of the band and Paich retired from touring. Paich was still a member of Toto, as he continued to record and produce on all of Toto&#x27;s releases.

In October 2003, Steve Lukather released a Christmas album named &quot;Santamental&quot;, featuring musicians such as Eddie Van Halen, Slash, Steve Vai, and Gregg Bissonette.

===2006–2008: &quot;Falling in Between&quot; and the subsequent tour and live album===


In early 2006, Toto released &quot;Falling in Between&quot; on the Italian label Frontiers, their first album of new material since 1999. The release featured extensive keyboard work from Steve Porcaro and a duet with Joseph Williams on the first single, &quot;Bottom of Your Soul&quot;. Following the record&#x27;s release, Toto embarked on a worldwide tour in 2006, which continued into 2007 for a second leg. The 2007 leg featured Leland Sklar filling in on bass for Mike Porcaro due to an, at the time, undisclosed illness. Mike Porcaro&#x27;s last show with the band was on November 16, 2006, in Medina, Minnesota.

The 2007 leg featured extensive dates in both Europe and the United States, including an appearance at Moondance Jam in Walker, Minnesota. Former lead singer Fergie Frederiksen made a guest appearance at the Minneapolis date on May 5, 2007 and Joseph Williams also made a few guest appearances with the band in June 2007. The tour continued into 2008 and began in Mexico City, Mexico on January 31, 2008. They toured Japan with Boz Scaggs, which tour featured Joseph Williams singing lead and background vocals with Kimball, and featured the return of David Paich.

Toto released a two-CD set &quot;Falling in Between Live&quot; on Eagle Records to commemorate the tour. This live set marked the fourth for the band, following 1993&#x27;s &quot;Absolutely Live&quot;, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Livefields&quot;, and 2003&#x27;s &quot;Live In Amsterdam&quot;.

In 2008, a companion DVD of the show, recorded at Le Zenith in Paris on March 26, 2007, was released.

===2008-2010: First hiatus and subsequent reformation===
On June 5, 2008, after a period of rumors about the band&#x27;s future, Lukather posted a message on his official website, stating, &quot;The fact is yes I have left Toto. There is no more Toto. I just can&#x27;t do it anymore and at 50 years old I wanted to start over and give it one last try on my own.&quot;

As the main motivation for his decision, Lukather said: When Dave [Paich] retired that was REAL hard for me &#x27;cause we started the band together. Hell, it&#x27;s 35 years if you count High School where the core all met. When Mike [Porcaro] fell ill and had to leave that was it for me. If there isn&#x27;t Paich or at least one Porcaro how can we even call it Toto? ... Honestly, I have just had enough. This is NOT a break. It is over. I really can&#x27;t go out and play Hold The Line with a straight face anymore.Steve Lukather released his next solo album on February 22, 2008, titled &quot;Ever Changing Times&quot;.

On February 26, 2010, the band reformed and reunited for a brief tour of Europe in the summer to benefit Mike Porcaro, who had been diagnosed with ALS. The lineup featured David Paich, Steve Lukather, Steve Porcaro, Simon Phillips, Joseph Williams, and special guest Nathan East.

Steve Lukather stated that the band still existed: 

On October 11, 2010, Steve Lukather released his next solo album, &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;.

Another tour in the summer of 2011 took place with former backup singer Jenny Douglas once again joining. Their show on July 17, 2011, in Verona, Italy was recorded for a live DVD but has yet to be released because of a contractual issue with their former label. They once again toured Europe in 2012.

===2013–2014: 35th anniversary, Simon Phillips&#x27;s departure, and David Hungate&#x27;s return===
In 2013, celebrating their 35th anniversary, the band embarked on tour across Europe and North America, along with Japanese dates to follow in 2014. Their show on June 25, 2013, in Łódź, Poland was recorded for a live release and was released on April 29, 2014. On November 5, it was confirmed both on Toto&#x27;s and David Paich&#x27;s official Facebook pages that a new studio album was in the works and that the band planned to go into the studio early 2014.

On January 21, 2013, Steve Lukather released a solo album, &quot;Transition&quot;, featuring former Toto touring bassist Leland Sklar, as well as Gregg Bissonette and Chad Smith.

On January 18, 2014, former vocalist Fergie Frederiksen died after a long battle with liver cancer. After the 2013 leg of the 35th anniversary tour, it was revealed via the band&#x27;s official website on January 23, 2014, that Simon Phillips had departed the band to pursue a solo career. Phillips was then replaced by Steely Dan drummer Keith Carlock.

While Carlock was on the Japanese tour from April to May 2014, he did not join them for the North American tour and his role was filled by Shannon Forrest. Bass player Nathan East, who had been touring with them since 2010, left after the Japanese tour to pursue his own projects. In his stead, original bass player David Hungate rejoined the band. They once again toured the United States in spring 2014 as co-headliners with Michael McDonald. It was their most comprehensive tour on the continent in years.

===2015–2017: &quot;Toto XIV&quot; and Mike Porcaro&#x27;s death===
Toto released their fourteenth studio album and their first in nine years titled &quot;Toto XIV&quot; on March 20 (Europe), March 23 (UK and Oceania), and March 24, 2015 (North America). To promote the newly finished project, the band started a world tour running with an extensive European headline arena tour including appearances at key festivals, along with a North American tour to follow in the summer of 2015 and Asia later that year.

On March 15, 2015, former bassist Mike Porcaro died in his sleep at his home in Los Angeles, due to complications from his battle with ALS.

On April 6, 2015, Toto announced that they would embark on August 7, 2015, in Mashantucket, Connecticut, with the band Yes, on a joint summer tour of North America, due to end on September 12 in Coquitlam, British Columbia. Dave Santos took over bass from Dave Hungate for the final three dates of the tour and Shannon Forrest continued to perform as the band&#x27;s drummer.

On September 29, 2015, Toto announced the first leg of their 2016 Tour in support of &quot;Toto XIV&quot; consisting of European and Japanese dates. Leland Sklar, who joined them on their 2007 and 2008 tours, replaced founding member Hungate. Sklar stopped touring with Toto in early 2017 and was replaced by Shem von Schroeck.

In June 2016, keyboardist Steve Porcaro released his first solo album, titled &quot;Someday/Somehow&quot; featuring Michael McDonald and Toto touring backing singer Mabvuto Carpenter.

===2018–2019: 40th anniversary albums, &quot;Old Is New&quot;, and second hiatus===
On February 9, 2018, Toto released their anniversary album &quot;40 Trips Around the Sun&quot;. They then embarked on a world tour promoting the album and celebrating 40 years of music. The band&#x27;s lineup consisted of Joseph Williams, Steve Lukather, David Paich, and Steve Porcaro, and their touring musicians: Lenny Castro, Shannon Forrest, Warren Ham, and Shem von Schroeck.

On July 20, 2018, Toto announced: &quot;David Paich will not be performing on the band&#x27;s planned North American tour. He plans on focusing on his health and looks forward to returning to the road when ready to do so. In the absence of the founding keyboardist&#x27;s presence on the tour, Dominique &#x27;Xavier&#x27; Taplin (formerly with Prince) will be sitting in for David performing with Toto.&quot;

After the European leg of the tour, Toto covered Weezer&#x27;s song &quot;Hash Pipe&quot; in response to their cover of Toto&#x27;s 1981 number 1 single, &quot;Africa&quot;. The band added the cover to their setlist as the encore for the 2018 North American leg of the tour.

On September 18, 2018, guitarist Steve Lukather released his autobiography &quot;The Gospel According to Luke&quot;, a humorous review on his life in music. An Audiobook was released shortly after on Audible.

On November 6, 2018, the band released the box set &quot;All In&quot; which contained their fourteenth studio album &quot;Old Is New&quot;. This contained the three new tracks already released on &quot;40 Trips Around the Sun&quot; plus completed recordings of four other older tracks featuring Jeff Porcaro on drums and either Mike Porcaro or David Hungate on bass plus other new recordings.

On January 2, 2019, Toto kicked off their 2019 leg of the 40 Trips Around The Sun tour in Byron Bay at the Falls Festival. Xavier Taplin remained in place of Paich through that tour. Toto embarked upon a brief tour of North America on September 20, 2019. Steve Lukather stated that the tour would be the band&#x27;s last for &quot;a while&quot;, and that tensions within the band and its management had increased due to legal troubles, such as an ongoing lawsuit with the widow of founding member and drummer Jeff Porcaro, Susan Porcaro-Goings (current wife of Rick Goings). David Paich made a special appearance with the group at the tour opener in Los Angeles, singing and playing on “Africa” and “Home of the Brave”.

On October 16, 2019, Steve Lukather stated that after the final show in Philadelphia on October 20, 2019, it would mark the &quot;end of this configuration of Toto&quot;. Steve Lukather had also announced that there is a film about Toto in the works, and hinted that he would be writing a new book, titled &quot;The New Testament According to Luke&quot;. David Paich made another special appearance at the final show in Philadelphia to again perform &quot;Africa&quot; and &quot;Home of the Brave&quot;.

===2020–present: Second reformation and &quot;Dogz of Oz&quot; Tour===
On October 19, 2020, it was announced that Steve Lukather and Joseph Williams would return to touring under the band name, in a proposed worldwide tour in 2021, known as the &quot;Dogz of Oz Tour&quot;. The new band lineup would feature bassist John Pierce (Huey Lewis and the News, Pablo Cruise, and a long-time session player), drummer Robert &quot;Sput&quot; Searight (Ghost-Note, Snarky Puppy), and keyboardists Dominique &quot;Xavier&quot; Taplin (Prince, Ghost-Note) and Steve Maggiora (Robert Jon &amp; the Wreck), as well as multi-instrumentalist Warren Ham. The tour began with a soft-opening: a worldwide live-streamed performance on November 21, 2020, during which David Paich appeared with the band for the final two songs. On April 12, 2021, the band announced that the &quot;Dogz of Oz World Tour&quot; would be pushed to 2022.

On April 14, 2021, the band announced that they would release a new live album, &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;, through Mascot Label Group/The Players Club. Released on June 25, the album contains the streamed performance of November 2020, and was preceded by the release of two singles, live renditions of &quot;Til The End&quot; and &quot;You Are The Flower&quot;. On June 28, 2021, Lukather stated that the group has no plans to record any future studio albums, though he was open to working with Williams on solo projects.

Toto began 2022 with a 40-city tour through major U.S. basketball and hockey arenas, serving as the opening act for Journey. David Paich joined Toto for the final four songs (Home of the Brave, With a Little Help From My Friends, Rosanna and Africa) in several shows. He also joined the band for the European leg of the tour at the Amsterdam show on July 15, 2022. On August 16, 2022, Greg Phillinganes returned to the Toto lineup for the first time since the Falling In Between tour in 2008, filling in for regular touring keyboardist, Dominique Xavier Taplin, who was forced to return home shortly before the end of the European leg of the tour, citing family reasons. Phillinganes&#x27;s stay with the band was only temporary though, as Taplin returned to the band on August 23, 2022, for their show in Luxembourg.

Toto toured with Journey again in early 2023, before performing several concerts on its own in Japan during the summer. The band performed in November and December in Belgium and Germany for the Night of the Proms 2023, beginning in Antwerp.

It was announced on September 25, 2023, that Toto and Journey would tour North America together for the third straight year, with concerts scheduled from February–April 2024.

In January 2024, Toto announced on Facebook the return of keyboardist Greg Phillinganes and drummer Shannon Forrest ahead of their &quot;Dogz of Oz&quot; tour in 2024, replacing Taplin and Searight. On June 15, 2024, it was announced that Dennis Atlas was the new 2nd keyboardist for their upcoming tours, replacing keyboardist and vocalist Steve Maggiora.

In the second half of 2024, Toto toured Europe from late June-late July, returned to perform in its hometown of Los Angeles at the Hollywood Bowl on September 1, 2024, and then played a series of concerts in Latin American countries such as Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia.

Toto announced additional European appearances for February-March 2025. Christopher Cross, who opened for Toto at the Hollywood Bowl, will also serve as the opening act in Europe. Following that, Toto also announced tour dates in Australia and New Zealand, again with Christopher Cross as the opener.

==Session work (1970s to early 1990s)==
Before and during Toto, members of the band did session work for a slew of notable musicians. The first such session, which also led to the birth of the band, was with Boz Scaggs, in which Jeff Porcaro, David Paich, David Hungate, and Joe Porcaro (regular Toto guest contributor and father of Jeff, Steve, and Mike) played on Scaggs&#x27;s album &quot;Silk Degrees&quot;. The members had done smaller scale work together before this, including with Steely Dan, Seals and Crofts, and Sonny &amp; Cher. Steve Lukather provided the main guitar work on Michael Jackson&#x27;s hit &quot;Beat It&quot;, although Eddie Van Halen played the guitar solo in the bridge. Jeff Porcaro played drums on that track, while Steve Porcaro programmed synthesizer for the &quot;Thriller&quot; album and also wrote and composed &quot;Human Nature&quot;.

In 1982, the rock band Chicago brought in David Foster to produce their album &quot;Chicago 16&quot;. Under his direction, the band adopted more of a soft rock sound, shed most of its jazz fusion/horn section sound, and brought in many session musicians, including Steve Lukather, David Paich, and Steve Porcaro, the three core members of Toto.

In 1978, David Foster brought David Hungate, Steve Lukather, Steve Porcaro, and Toto vocalist Bobby Kimball to play on Alice Cooper&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;From the Inside&quot;. They have also played with legendary jazz player Miles Davis. Members of Toto have also collaborated with Larry Carlton, Pink Floyd, Quincy Jones, Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, James Newton Howard, Michael McDonald, the Eagles, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Yes, Eddie Van Halen, Los Lobotomys, Yoso, Richard Page (of Mr. Mister, who was proposed to replace Bobby Kimball), and Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band (also featuring Richard Page).

<text>Édouard Nanny (March 24, 1872 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye – October 12, 1942 in Paris) was an important French double bass player, teacher, and composer. He was a longtime professor of double bass at the Paris Conservatory.

==Career==
Nanny was part of &quot;la Société de concerts des Instruments anciens&quot;. He gained some international exposure as a composer during his lifetime, although he never enjoyed the respect he received in France worldwide. Among his most famous works are his Concerto in E minor and his &quot;Enseignement Complet&quot; (a collection of pedagogical works including the 2-part &quot;Méthode complète pour la contrebasse à quatre et cinq cordes&quot;, the &quot;Vingt études de virtuosité&quot; (Paris, 1920), and his &quot;Dix étude-caprices&quot;). 

Although his two concertos (his own and the musical hoax under Dragonetti&#x27;s name) are important repertory items, Nanny&#x27;s most lasting contribution was in the field of pedagogy (instructional method). Edouard Nanny taught at the Paris Conservatory until 1940. In his principle work, &quot;Enseignement Complet&quot; considered his most lasting accomplishment, Nanny passed to others the method he used to become a virtuoso during his lifetime. This is his from-basic-to-virtuoso, ‘A-to-Z’ repertoire of studies for the double bassist, originally for bowing but also for pizzicato (plucked). Quite naturally it can be applied to the bass guitar and cello - same clef and similar range as the double bass. For the cello, although the notes are read identically they will however, sound an octave higher. This does not detract from this method advancing the artistry of cellists as well as bassists.

The initial exercises are simple, using scale phrases introduced slowly in simple keys: C Maj., G Maj., then D Maj. and so on. The studies progress to simple jumps together with partial scale phrases then to complex jumps and intricate rhythms in progressively more difficult keys and at faster tempos. From the easy beginning to the difficult finale of this book; a beginner or intermediate bassist can finish in two to five years of study. A more advanced player - one to two or perhaps three years to complete. The scope of this method is vast, graduated, intricate and all-encompassing. Once finished, this book alone can bring a student to an expertise, a mastery of any of the stringed basses; elementary to virtuosity in fifty-two pages perhaps in as little as three to five years.

Nanny&#x27;s Concerto in A major that was attributed to classical Italian virtuoso Domenico Dragonetti was, in fact, penned by Nanny.

Nanny&#x27;s study method, &quot;Enseignement Complet&quot; his études and caprices have been studied and played for close to a century by double bassists, performers, teachers and students alike.

<text>Tillsonburg is a town in Oxford County, Ontario, Canada with a population of 18,615 located about 50 kilometres southeast of London, on Highway 3 at the junction of Highway 19.

==History==
Prior to European settlement, the present site of Tillsonburg was home to Indigenous tribes. The Tillsonburg Village Site, a 14th century Iroquoian village, was excavated in 2001 and 2008, in the northwest corner of the town, and contained 15 longhouses. 

The area was settled in 1825 by George Tillson and other immigrants from Enfield, Massachusetts. A forge and sawmill were erected and roads built which led to the establishment of this small community, originally called Dereham Forge. The settlement was on the Big Otter Creek.

In 1836 the village was renamed Tillsonburg in honour of its founder. It was also in this year that the main street, Broadway, was laid out to its full width. Because the village was predominantly a logging and wood product centre, the street was built to accommodate the turning of three-team logging wagons. This width is now unique to Ontario and has become a benefit toward handling the pressures of modern-day traffic by providing angled parking. The extension of Broadway north was called Plank Line and is now known as Highway 19.

The mid-19th century proved to be the first step in the industrialization of this municipality. A water system was devised to not only supply pure water for domestic use, but also to provide water power to such industries as a sawmill, planing mill, gristmill, spinning mill, pottery and a tannery. Many of these new establishments were either owned, started, or financed by George Tillson.
In 1872 the village was incorporated as the Town of Tillsonburg, with Edwin Delevan Tillson elected as its first mayor. The Town of Tillsonburg reached a population of 2,000 in 1885, experienced its first church dedication, and had its first telephone installation established. Electric power was first used in 1912 and automobiles began to appear on the market.

In 1915, a public library was built with funds provided by the Carnegie Foundation, and the town&#x27;s Memorial Hospital opened in 1925.

In the 1920s, major enterprises included milk production, manufacture of shoes, tractors, textiles and an increased production of tobacco. The Tillsonburg Livingstons basketball team (representative of Tillsonburg&#x27;s largest industry) won the Canadian Championships in 1952 and represented Canada in the 1952 Summer Olympics at Helsinki, Finland. CKOT Radio began broadcasting operations in 1955 and the Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Marketing Board opened its new auction exchange three years later.

==Government==
Tillsonburg is one of eight municipalities that make up the County of Oxford. The mayor also represents the town as a County Councillor. The county administers social programs, ambulance and paramedic services, planning, water and wastewater services, garbage and landfill operations and the County road system.

Tillsonburg is governed by an elected mayor, deputy mayor and five councillors. Council meets on the 2nd and 4th Mondays of each month in the Council Chambers in the Corporate Municipal Office. They oversee staff and set policy for the various operations and services provided by the town.

The town also owns and operates:
*Tillsonburg Municipal Airport
*Lake Lisgar Water Park

Oxford County now owns and operates:
*Tillsonburg Public Library

==Healthcare==

The town has one hospital accredited through the Ontario Ministry of Health. Tillsonburg District Memorial Hospital is in the downtown area on Rolph Street. The TDMH serves the town and region.

==Development==
In the Town&#x27;s Centennial Year (1972), the new $1,000,000 Community Recreation Complex was opened by the Governor-General of Canada. The Tillsonburg Museum was also opened in the old community centre on the shores of Lake Lisgar. A new library was completed in 1975, and a second indoor skating rink was built in 1977, funded completely by donations from industry, commerce, service clubs, citizens and the Wintario lottery. In 1979, the hospital built a $7,000,000 addition for offices, improved x-ray and emergency departments, and an expanded Intensive Care Unit. A fire hall was constructed in 1979, replacing the old building which was demolished to make way for a downtown mall.
The controversial Tillsonburg Town Centre Mall opened in 1980, where the former Town Hall once stood. The mall, a joint effort of the town and Trottier Investments, was built primarily to meet competition from out-of-town malls and keep more of the shopping dollar in town.
In 1983, two important buildings - Annandale House (built by the founding Tillson family) and the Hale Street railway station became public buildings. The former would be restored as a house museum, while the latter became The Station Arts Centre.

A residential development geared for seniors, named Hickory Hills, began selling homes in 1986. The development significantly added to the town&#x27;s population and increased the pool of volunteers for local non-profit agencies.

In 1991, a food bank was established for the community&#x27;s needy and continues to be operated on a volunteer basis.

Throughout the early 1990s, volunteers were also busy on the Lake Lisgar Renaissance Project, which sought to revitalize the lake, and make the park around the lake more attractive with the construction of a gazebo, water fountain and walkways into the lake.

In that period two major entertainment outlets closed: the Skylark Drive-In and the Strand movie theatre, victims of the video store arrival. The original angled marquee architecture of the Strand Theatre is still intact but the building is again unoccupied after brief stints as businesses. To the relief of many, big screen movies came back in Tillsonburg in 1996 with the opening of Broadway Cinemas.

In 1994, the downtown area was significantly enhanced with the construction of the Rotary Club Clock Tower, which incorporated a clock from the town&#x27;s former Post Office, and a bell from the demolished Town Hall. Soon, it became a community tradition (sponsored by the Rotary Club) for local residents to gather at the Clock Tower to ring in the New Year with fireworks, hot apple cider and the dropping of a ball.

Further development of residential senior&#x27;s focused development began in 2001 with the Baldwin Place subdivision located on the western periphery of the town. This development which is in Phase 8 will have approximately 300 homes when completed.

The Tillsonburg Community Centre was refurbished in 2004 with renovations and enlargement of the main ice surface to NHL size. The project&#x27;s scope of work included keeping the whale-back roof as a key architectural feature as well as to increase seating and provide for new recreation and health club facilities.

Residential development includes the re-urbanization of the former railway lands on Bridge Street East which is the site of Tillson Landing condominium, the first such highrise construction in more than a decade.

==Industry and economy==
Tillsonburg serves a regional tri-county area of 65,000 people at the convergence of Oxford, Elgin and Norfolk counties. The industrial base has become quite diverse during the decline of the once prominent tobacco industry. The area is home to several branch plants of major US and internationally based automotive suppliers including Autoneum Canada Ltd, THK-TRW, Marwood Metal Fabrication Ltd and a new site for Armtec. There are many service-related industries including Future Transfer Co. Inc, Inovata Foods, E &amp; E McLaughlin, J/E Bearing Ltd., Fleetwood Metal Products, and MIL-SIM-FX International Inc.

The town has a very active and developing downtown core area which includes the Tillsonburg Town Centre mall, built in 1980 and has several big box stores.

All of the major Canadian banks have branches in the town and there is also a credit union.

Tillsonburg is served by three radio stations; the New Country 107.3 (107.3 CJDL FM), Country 1510 (1510 CKOT AM), Easy 101 (101.3 CKOT FM) and two newspapers: The Norfolk &amp; Tillsonburg News, and The Tillsonburg Post.

The town has been positively impacted by the CAMI plant in Ingersoll, 22 kilometres north of the town, which opened in 1986. The CAMI plant, owned by General Motors of Detroit, Michigan, has been retooled to produce the BrightDrop series of all-electric delivery vans.

The area also has a strong agricultural community with cash crops, hog farming, milk production, tobacco, ginseng and various tertiary crops (including watermelons).

The town has recently become a hub for regional operations of the Ontario Provincial Police including Oxford County Division Headquarters and also the Southwestern Ontario Forensics laboratory which opened in April 2008.

==Tourism==
In January 2006 the &quot;National Post&quot; listed Tillsonburg as number 75 on the top 100 places to visit in Canada.
Annandale House was designated a Canadian National Historic Site in 1997.

Tillsonburg is home to three barn quilts. One is on the north end of town on the side of a furniture store, shaped as a barn. Another one is on the grounds of Station Arts in front of the caboose and the third quilt is on the original Pea &amp; Barley Mill, built in 1878 by E.D. Tillson, son of the town&#x27;s founder and opened in 2009 as the Mill Tales Inn beside the Otter Creek featuring a restaurant and inn. These barn quilts make up part of the Barn Quilt Trail in Southwest Ontario.

Another attraction is the Station Arts Centre, a multi-use facility which was created from two historic train stations that were joined together by a central gallery. It has been home to artistic, cultural and technical groups since its founding in 1983. It is also home to the Saturday morning Tillsonburg Farmers&#x27; Market which operates from May to November.

A number of organizations across Tillsonburg collaborate in putting together events such as Turtlefest, the Week of Remembrance and the Tillsonburg Country Christmas Festival.

Camping is available north of town at Casey&#x27;s Park on Highway #19 north of Mount Elgin, which is the home of weekly Country Music Jamborees between Victoria Day and Labour Day, where audience members are encouraged to participate on stage.

<doc id="507872" wikidata="Q429976" url="?curid=507872" title="Phytochorion">
<text>A phytochorion, in phytogeography, is a geographic area with a relatively uniform composition of plant species. Adjacent phytochoria do not usually have a sharp boundary, but rather a soft one, a transitional area in which many species from both regions overlap. The region of overlap is called a [[Ecotone|vegetation tension zone]].

In traditional schemes, areas in phytogeography are classified hierarchically, according to the presence of endemic families, genera or species, e.g., in floral (or floristic, phytogeographic) zones and regions, or also in kingdoms, regions and provinces, sometimes including the categories empire and domain. However, some authors prefer not to rank areas, referring to them simply as &quot;areas&quot;, &quot;regions&quot; (in a non hierarchical sense) or &quot;phytochoria&quot;.

Systems used to classify vegetation can be divided in two major groups: those that use physiognomic-environmental parameters and characteristics and those that are based on floristic (i.e. shared genera and species) relationships. Phytochoria are defined by their plant taxonomic composition, while other schemes of regionalization (e.g., vegetation type, physiognomy, plant formations, biomes) may variably take in account, depending on the author, the apparent characteristics of a community (the dominant life-form), environment characteristics, the fauna associated, anthropic factors or political-conservationist issues.

== Explanation ==

Several systems of classifying geographic areas where plants grow have been devised. Most systems are organized hierarchically, with the largest units subdivided into smaller geographic areas, which are made up of smaller floristic communities, and so on. Phytochoria are defined as areas possessing a large number of endemic taxa. Floristic kingdoms are characterized by a high degree of family endemism, floristic regions by a high degree of generic endemism, and floristic provinces by a high degree of species endemism. Systems of phytochoria have both significant similarities and differences with zoogeographic provinces, which follow the composition of mammal families, and with biogeographical provinces or terrestrial ecoregions, which take into account both plant and animal species.

The term &quot;phytochorion&quot; (Werger &amp; van Gils, 1976) is especially associated with the classifications according to the methodology of Josias Braun-Blanquet, which is tied to the presence or absence of particular species, mainly in Africa.

Taxonomic databases tend to be organized in ways which approximate floristic provinces, but which are more closely aligned to political boundaries, for example according to the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions.

== Early schemes ==
In the late 19th century, Adolf Engler (1844-1930) was the first to make a world map with the limits of distribution of floras, with four major floral regions (realms). His &quot;Syllabus der Pflanzenfamilien&quot;, from the third edition (1903) onwards, also included a sketch of the division of the earth into floral regions.

Other important early works on floristics includes Augustin de Candolle (1820), Schouw (1823), Alphonse de Candolle (1855), Drude (1890), Diels (1908), and Rikli (1913).

== Good (1947) regionalization==

Botanist Ronald Good (1947) identified six floristic kingdoms (Boreal or Holarctic, Neotropical, Paleotropical, South African, Australian, and Antarctic), the largest natural units he determined for flowering plants. Good&#x27;s six kingdoms are subdivided into smaller units, called regions and provinces. The Paleotropical kingdom is divided into three subkingdoms, which are each subdivided into floristic regions. Each of the other five kingdoms are subdivided directly into regions. There are a total of 37 floristic regions. Almost all regions are further subdivided into floristic provinces.

==Takhtajan (1978, 1986) regionalization==
Armen Takhtajan (1978, 1986), in a widely used scheme that builds on Good&#x27;s work, identified thirty-five floristic regions, each of which is subdivided into floristic provinces, of which there are 152 in all.

== Regionalization according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer Lösch (2004, 2010) ==

;Notes:(with focus on Europe, matching the image on the right)
* The central European region and the central Russian region are sister regions.
* The border between them is similar to the &quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot; limit (January, day-time temperature average: above -2 °C).
* The border between the central Russian region and the boreal region is similar to the &quot;Quercus&quot; spp. limit (Day-time temperature average: above 10 °C, 4 months per year).
* The border between the boreal region and the arctic region is similar to the tree line, taiga/arctic tundra limit (July, day-time temperature average: above 10 °C).
* The border of the Atlantic region is the limit of no frost (average), Gulf Stream influence.
* The warm islands in the Atlantic Ocean are in the Macaronesia region: isolated populations in a more humid environment.
* The Mediterranean region is similar to the occurrence of wild &quot;Olea europea&quot; and wild &quot;Cistus salviifolius&quot; (&quot;Olea europea&quot; is grown very North in Italy).
* The border between the submediterranean region and the central European region is similar to the alpine arc (upper Rhone, upper Rhine, lower Danube), a weather barrier.
* The Pontic region border is similar to the tree line/ steppe limit (less than 450 mm precipitation per year).
* The Turanian region has a semi-arid climate.

== Liu &quot;et al.&quot; (2023, 2024) Regionalization ==

Critiquing previous attempts for their lack of phylogenetic relationships in the construction of their regions, Liu &quot;et al.&quot; incorporated distribution data alongside phylogenetic relationships to configure their realms. This led to the classification of eight realms organized into two super-realms and each composed of a number of sub-realms.
* Gondwanan super-realm
:1 African
:2 Indo-Malesian
:3 Australian
:4 Novozealandic
:5 Neotropical
:6 Chile–Patagonian
* Laurasian super-realm
:7 Holarctic
:8 Saharo-Arabian

Differences from Takhtajan&#x27;s floristic kingdoms mainly focus on emphasizing the uniqueness of certain realms that he had as subdivisions within kingdoms. Two examples are separating some kingdoms into two separate realms, as happened to the Paleotropical and Antarctic kingdoms, reasoning that they have been separated form each other for long enough time to constitute a different phylogenetic trajectory. The merging of the Cape floristic kingdom with the African realm was based by the low endemism of higher taxonomic ranks, which could be found outside the cape region in the rest of Africa. The final major change is the separation of the Saharo-Arabian realm from the Holarctic kingdom, though they admit the northern boundary is not clear, with flora from the Holarctic being found within this area.

After publishing their regions, Dr. Hong Qian criticized Liu &quot;et al.&quot; for the inclusion of nonnative distributions in their analyses. In response to this, the group cleaned their data to remove nonnative ranges and reassessed their regions. They suggest that the previous inclusion of exotic species did not significantly affect their mapping and found that the cleaned data revealed the same floristic realms.

<text>Franz Simandl (August 1, 1840 – December 15, 1912) was a double-bassist and pedagogue from Austria-Hungary most remembered for his book &quot;New Method for String Bass&quot;, known as the &quot;Simandl book&quot;, which is to this day used as a standard study of double bass technique and hand positions.

His approach uses the first, second, and fourth fingers of the left hand (the third and fourth operating together as one digit) to stop the strings in the lower register of the instrument and divide the fingerboard into various positions.

The second volume of the method looks at the use of thumb position using the thumb, first, second and third fingers, to play solo, high register work and again dividing the fingerboard up into a concept of positions. The second volume also delves extensively into the playing of harmonics.

Simandl&#x27;s &quot;New Method&quot; of playing, originally published in 1881, is still common among classical double bassists, &quot;American String Teacher&quot; 46:4 pp59-60&lt;/ref&gt; Modern adaptations of, extensions to, and challenges to Simandl doctrines are acknowledged.

Simandl studied at the Prague Conservatory with before becoming the principal bassist in the Vienna Court Opera Orchestra. He was a Professor of double-bass at the Vienna Conservatory from 1869 to 1910. His pupils include many of the leading bassists of his time such as Ludwig Manoly, who moved to New York City to become principal bass of the New York Philharmonic and was an influential teacher.

The Simandl &quot;family tree&quot; of bass pedagogues extends for many generations. Prominent bassist/educators who can trace their lineage directly back to Simandl include Adolf Mišek, Richard Davis, Mark Dresser, Joseph Guastafeste, Greg Sarchet, Gary Karr, Hermann Reinshagen, Karl E. H. Seigfried, Ludwig Streicher, Bertram Turetzky, and Frederick Zimmermann.

<doc id="507878" wikidata="Q6869237" url="?curid=507878" title="Minority-serving institution">
<text>In the higher education system of the United States, minority-serving institution (MSI) is a descriptive term for universities and colleges that enroll a significant percentage of students from minority groups.

== Definition ==
The term MSI is defined in US federal statute under the Higher Education Act (HEA), and several federal agencies maintain a listing of eligible institutions that receive HEA funding designated for MSIs, such as the U.S. Department of Education and the National Science Foundation. Most MSIs qualify for federal funding based on annual undergraduate or graduate enrollment and graduation criteria (enrollment-driven MSIs, such as Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs), Native American Serving NonTribal Institutions (NASNTIs), Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions (ANNHIs), and Asian American and Pacific Islander Serving Institutions (AANAPISIs)), while two types are statutorily defined, such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs). For example, a report from the U.S. Department of Education on the characteristics of MSIs defined MSI based on either of two separate criteria; 1) legislation (e.g. HBCU, TCU, or 2) percentage of minority undergraduate enrollment based on IPEDS data (i.e. &quot;institutions that enroll at least 25 percent of a specific minority group are designated as “minority-serving” for that group&quot;).

== Disambiguation ==
The similar term “minority institutions” (MIs) is defined by § 365(3) of the Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965 (20 U.S.C. § 1067k(3)).

== Background ==
Many MSIs, such as Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), began in response to a history of inequality and a lack of access for people of color to majority institutions. MSIs overall now occupy a unique place in the nation, serving primarily, but not exclusively, low-income students, first generation students, and students of color. These institutions have highly diverse faculties and staffs, enhance student learning and promote leadership skills, and provide programs of study address deficiencies that originated at the primary and secondary level. MSIs play an important role in the nation’s economy by preparing a diverse workforce and prepare underrepresented students for graduate and professional school.

Until 2007, no federal legislation existed concerning institutions serving Asian American and Pacific Islanders. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 made history, because it granted federal recognition to these institutions, making them eligible to be designated as minority serving institutions.

MSIs serve a large number of financially-challenged students: 98 percent of African Americans and Native Americans who enroll at HBCUs or TCUs receive or qualify for federal financial aid, and over 50% of all students enrolled at MSIs receive Pell Grant support. As a point of comparison, only 31 percent of all college students receive Pell Grant support. Moreover, nearly half of MSI students are first generation college students. In comparison, only 35 percent of students attending Predominantly White Institutions.

==Federal funding==
MSIs are eligible for federal and private funding based on specific eligibility requirements, as determined by the funding agency.

Federal funding is provided directly to some MSIs under Title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965:

# Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) – institutions founded prior to the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that were created primarily to educate African Americans (e.g., Alabama State University, Morgan State University, and Texas Southern University)
# Predominantly Black Institutions (PBI) – institutions that do not meet the legal definition of HBCUs, but primarily serve African Americans. Eligibility is based on serving an undergraduate population that is both low income (at least 50% receiving Title IV needs-based assistance) and in which African American students constitute at least 40% (e.g., Georgia State University, Trinity Washington University, Community College of Philadelphia).
# Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) – institutions that serve an undergraduate population that is both low income (at least 50% receiving Title IV needs-based assistance) and in which Hispanic students constitute at least 25% (e.g., University of Texas at El Paso, Fresno Pacific University, and University of Texas Rio Grande Valley).
#Tribal Colleges or Universities (TCU) – institutions of higher education which are formally controlled, or have been formally sanctioned, or chartered, by the governing body of a Native American tribe (e.g., Diné College).
#Native American Non-Tribal Institutions (NANTI) – institutions other than TCUs that serve an undergraduate population that is both low income (at least 50% receiving Title IV needs-based assistance) and in which American Indian students constitute at least 10% (e.g., Southeastern Oklahoma State University).
#Alaskan Native or Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions (ANNH or ANNHSI) – institutions that serve an undergraduate population that is both low income (at least 50% receiving Title IV needs-based assistance) and in which Alaska Native students constitute at least 20% or Hawaiian Native students constitute at least 10% (e.g., University of Alaska Fairbanks and University of Hawaii at Manoa).
#Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions (AANAPISI) – institutions that serve an undergraduate population that is both low income (at least 50% receiving Title IV needs-based assistance) and in which Asian American or Native American Pacific Islander students constitute at least 10% (e.g., California State University, Los Angeles, NJIT and University of Guam).

Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP) institutions serve a low income undergraduate population (at least 50% receiving Title IV needs-based assistance) and are eligible for federal funding under Title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965. However, as there are no requirements for minority enrollment under Title III Part A, in some cases these institutions may or may not be considered MSIs.

==Executive Orders==
Specific Executive Orders currently referencing MSIs include:
* E.O. 13779; White House Initiative To Promote Excellence and Innovation at Historically Black Colleges and Universities
* E.O. 13230; White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans
* E.O. 13270; Tribal colleges and universities
* E.O. 13336; American Indian and Alaska Native Education
* E.O. 13515; Increasing Federal Programs for Asian American Pacific Islanders
* E.O. 13078; Increasing Employment of Adults with Disabilities.

<text>Dellys (, Berber: Delles) is a small Mediterranean town in northern Algeria&#x27;s coastal Boumerdès Province, almost due north of Tizi-Ouzou and just east of the Sebaou River. It is the district seat of the daïra of Dellys. The town is 45 km from Tizi Ouzou, 50 km from Boumerdes (the provincial capital), and about 100 km from the capital Algiers.

It is notable for its Ottoman-era Casbah, two colonial-era lighthouses (marking Cape Bengut), and some beaches; the principal activities of the area are fishing and farming.

As of 2008, the population of the municipality is 32,954.

==Geography==

The Dellys area presents a natural harbour in the form of a small bay sheltered on the west and northwest by the peninsula of Sidi Abdelkader (largely occupied by the town cemetery, along with a small lighthouse). This peninsula is the seaward extension of the mountain of Assouaf, looming over the town. Around this harbour grew the Casbah of Dellys. During the colonial period the town grew southwards, as the port was expanded; a technical school, the &quot;École des arts et métiers&quot;, was also built to the north, near the cemetery. Expansion further up the mountain was prevented by the preservation of the Bou-Arbi forest; instead, the town&#x27;s growth after independence in 1962 was mainly concentrated in two &quot;wings&quot; on each side of it.

To the south, former agricultural areas on the mountain slopes were built up with apartment buildings to form the new suburb Nouvelle-Ville, still surrounded by farmland on both sides. To the west, the relatively level Ladjenna (or &quot;Les Jardins&quot;) area, with rocky coasts, consisted mainly of family gardens and small farms until the mid-twentieth century, but is now largely built up. It includes the tiny fishing port of El-Kouss; Cape Bengut, the northernmost land in the region, marked by a larger lighthouse; and the rock promontory of Sid El-Medjni. Further west, the village of Takdempt, at the mouth of the Sebaou river, remains marginally separated from Dellys proper.

The municipality has a total of 678 hectares of forest, most of it accounted for by Bou-Arbi above the old town (74 hectares, Aleppo pine), Assouaf above the Ladjennna suburb (50 hectares, thuya and degraded maquis), Achtoub (290 hectares, brush), and an area around Takdempt (250 hectares, brush).

==Locations, districts and hamlets==
In addition to its seat, Dellys proper, the Dellys District is composed of the following localities: Ain Salem, Takdempt, Sidi El Medjni, Ladjenna, Bordj Fnar, Beni Azeroual, L&#x27;Assouaf, Lemchachka, Thouabet, Boukmach, Bouafia, Brarat, Dar El Melh (Les Salines), Boumedas, Ouled Mahdjoub, Beni Amara, Tizeghouine, Dar Rabah, Ouled Sabeur, Chegga, Mezoudj, Houasna, Azrou, Afir, Amadhi, Thissira, Ifri Tamarth, Ivehlal (Bhalil), Thala Ayache, Thala Arousse, El Marssa Tofaha.

These are divided among three municipalities: Dellys itself, Aafir to the east, and Ben Choud to the south.

==Demographics==
==Postcode==

From independence in 1962 to 1984, Dellys was part of the Wilaya of Tizi Ouzou, and each wilaya had a single postcode, in this case 15000.

After the administrative division of Algeria in 1984, Dellys was attached to the newly created wilaya of Boumerdès, whose postcodes started with 35; the Daïra of Dellys was indicated by a following 1 (351xx), its chief town (Dellys) with the number 0 (3510x), and its town centre with a further 0, giving the town centre of Dellys the complete postal code 35100.

In 2008, Dellys was given the new postcode 350043 as part of the restructuring undertaken by Algérie Poste.

==History==

===Prehistoric===

The Dellys area has been inhabited since prehistoric times; archeological finds in the area include Iberomaurusian remains, a Neolithic polished axe, and (at Takdempt) some dolmens and covered alleys.

===Antiquity===

Dellys first entered written history as the Phoenician colony of Rusucurru or Rusuccuru, known to the Greeks as &quot;Rhousoukkórrou&quot; ().
(A few authorities instead identify the ancient Rusucurru with Tigzirt.)

Rusuccuru became part of the Roman Empire about 42 CE with Claudius&#x27; annexation of the Kingdom of Mauretania, and was subsequently promoted to the rank of &quot;municipium&quot; after the suppression of Aedemon&#x27;s revolt. The town&#x27;s regional importance in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis was sufficient that inscriptions in the nearest towns, Iomnium to the east (modern Tigzirt) and Cissi to the west (modern Djinet), were dedicated to Rusucurru&#x27;s &quot;genius loci&quot;.

With the advent of Christianity, Rusucurru became a suffragan bishopric, variously known as Rusucurium, Rusucurrum, and Rhusuncorae; it was the birthplace of the Christian martyr Marciana (d. 303). The town survived Firmus&#x27; revolt in 373–375, as witnessed by attestations of the names of its later bishops:
* Fortunatus (mentioned in 411)
* Optatus (a Donatist mentioned in 411)
* Ninellus (mentioned in 419)
* Metcum (mentioned in 484, exiled by Huneric)

However, it disappears from written sources during later centuries.

===Medieval===

Under the name of Tedelles, the town reappears in the 12th century as the final refuge of the last Banu Sumadih emir of Almeria in Spain, Mu&#x27;izz ud-Dawla ibn Sumadih, who was granted land there by the Hammadid dynasty after fleeing the advance of the Almoravids.

After a period of prosperity, it was hard hit by the wars of the 14th century between the Hafsid, Merinid, and Zayyanid kingdoms, changing hands no less than 12 times between 1285 and 1373. The town (then in Zayyanid hands) was also sacked by a Valencian and Majorcan fleet in 1398, following a raid on Torreblanca.

After 1438, Dellys came under the rule of the Thaaliba family of Algiers.

===Early Modern===
With the arrival of Oruç and Hayreddin Barbarossa in the 16th century, Dellys became part of the Ottoman Empire; they initially made the town their eastern headquarters. The Casbah of Dellys in its current form dates back in large part to this period, while also reflecting earlier periods with its urbanistic styles.

===French colonization===
In 1830, France decided to invade. On 15 May that year, as their fleet prepared to attack, one French brig was shipwrecked near Dellys (main article: Shipwreck of Dellys). Within a couple of months France had occupied Algiers, beginning the process of French colonization of Algeria.

Dellys, however, would remain independent for a few years longer. The first French attack on the town came in 1837, in the wake of the First Battle of the Issers. In the same year, French expansion was temporarily put on hold by the Treaty of Tafna, in which France recognized Emir Abdelkader&#x27;s authority over most of western Algeria. Areas east of Algiers, including Dellys, soon swore allegiance to Emir Abdelkader, who appointed Ahmed bin Salem to lead the district. In 1839 Emir Abdelkader visited Dellys in person as part of a tour of his eastern frontiers, urging the inhabitants to prepare themselves for war rather than to place their trust in saints&#x27; tombs. The war did indeed resume that very year, following a French violation of the treaty further south at the Iron Gates.

On 12 May 1844, French troops under the command of Bugeaud made a second assault on Dellys, finally occupying the town. A European quarter was then built immediately south of the Casbah. The town was bisected by the road which would eventually become the RN24. The troops turned the town&#x27;s principal mosque into a military hospital on arrival, replacing it with a new one nearby which they completed in 1847.

In 1871, Cheikh Mokrani led much of eastern Algeria in an attempt to end French rule. The tribes surrounding the town of Dellys, the Beni-Thour and Beni-Slyem, joined in this revolt. On 22 April they laid siege to Dellys proper, where the French garrison managed to retain control with help from passing warships. On 18 May, a column led by Lallemand arrived from the west and broke the siege. In the wake of the revolt&#x27;s failure, much of the agricultural land surrounding Dellys was confiscated and given to French settlers, notably at Sidi Daoud and Baghlia. Mokrani&#x27;s defeat, and the hardships that followed it, marked the end of organized military resistance to French rule in the region for almost three generations.

During the Second World War, Dellys hosted a wireless communication training school for the French air force, where female volunteers were trained in radio operation and maintenance.

===Algerian Revolution===
Like the rest of Algeria, Dellys was engulfed in the Algerian War of Independence from 1954 to 1962.

This commune saw the creation of several clandestine torture centers during the Algerian revolution: 
* Camp Gualota in the commune of Dellys.

===Independence===
Algeria became independent in 1962; during the following decades, the town grew substantially.

The 2003 Boumerdès earthquake caused significant damage, notably to the Casbah and Nouvelle-Ville.

On 8 September 2007, a suicide car bomb attack on the naval barracks in the port, claimed by AQIM, took at least 30 lives.

==Health==
The Dellys hospital is the main health structure in the municipality of Dellys.
This public hospital establishment (E.P.H.) of Dellys has a technical capacity of 150 beds as well as an organized capacity of 162 beds distributed as follows:

* Internal medicine (male/female): 67 beds.
* Maternity/gynecology: 32 beds.
* Pediatrics: 32 beds.
* General surgery: 31 beds.

==Transport and roads==
Dellys is connected to the rest of the country through two main roads: 
* RN 24, a coastal road leading to Algiers in the west (via Djinet) and Bejaia in the east (via Aafir and Tigzirt)
* RN 25, providing a southward connection via Baghlia to Tizi-Ouzou.

From 1894 to ca. 1935, a railway line connected Dellys to Mirabeau (modern Draâ Ben Khedda).

At present there are three long-distance bus destinations: Dellys-Algiers; Dellys-Boumerdes; and Dellys-Tizi Ouzou.

== Economy ==
Dellys has an agricultural land and mixed port (fisheries and trade).

The port of Dellys, built in 1925, is now almost completely saturated with ships docking at its level. To remedy this situation, those in charge of the sector have decided to redevelop it.

In fact, in addition to the reinforcement work carried out after the 2003 earthquake, a dredging operation to correct its water level has been launched.

Its fleet is made up of 11 trawlers, 32 sardine boats and 150 small crafts.

==Sports==
As elsewhere in Algeria, football (soccer) is popular; Dellys-born footballers include Abderrahman Ibrir, former manager of the Algerian national team, and Rachid Nadji, a striker for MC Oran. The local team is the &quot;Union sportive de Dellys&quot; (USD); before independence, it was called the &quot;Association sportive de Dellys&quot; (ASD), founded in 1921. The town is equipped with a stadium capable of holding up to 7,000 people.

== Ecclesiastical titles ==
Although no bishop has resided in Dellys for well over a millennium, and no church currently exists in the town, the Catholic Church nevertheless added the bishopric of Rusuccuru (the town&#x27;s Latin name) to its list of titular sees in 1933.
In Latin the titular bishopric is known as &quot;Rusuccurrensis&quot;.

The Ancient diocese has had the following incumbents, all Latin Church and of the lowest episcopal rank:
* Dennis Walter Hickey (1968.01.05 – 1999.10.06)
* Kevin Joseph Farrell (2001.12.28 – 2007.03.06)
* Marek Mendyk, Auxiliary Bishop of Legnica (2008.12.24 – ...)

==Notable people==

* Habib Ayyoub, writer
* Abderrahmane Benhamida, former Minister of Education
* Abderrahmane Hammad, athlete
* Mokhtar Hasbellaoui, doctor
* Abderrahman Ibrir, footballer
* Marciana of Mauretania, Christian martyr
* Rachid Nadji, footballer
* Sidi Yahya al-Tadallisi al-Thaalibi, imam

<text>The Saddle Club is an Australian-Canadian children&#x27;s television series developed by Sarah Dodd, based on the books written by Bonnie Bryant. Like the book series, the scripted live action series follows the lives of three best friends in training to compete in equestrian competitions at the fictional Pine Hollow Stables, while dealing with problems in their personal lives. This series debuted in 2001 and ended in 2009.

==Premise==
The series follows the experiences of three girls, who establish a club called &quot;The Saddle Club&quot; after recognizing their mutual passion for horseback riding. Their rival is another young rider at the stables named Veronica DiAngelo.

Throughout the series, The Saddle Club navigates their rivalry with Veronica, training for competitions, horse shows, and the quotidian dramas that arise between friends and staff in the fictional Pine Hollow Stables. In each show, The Saddle Club prevails over its adversities, usually sending a message emphasizing the importance of friendship and teamwork.

==Episodes==

==Cast==


==Production==
The original series was filmed in Yarra Valley, Victoria in Australia, but involved a cast of mixed nationalities.

In 2007, a news release announced a casting call and the production of a third series, which was filmed from late 2007 to early 2008. The third series was filmed in Daylesford, Victoria.

==Broadcast==
The show was broadcast from 2001 until 2009, with 78 episodes over three series. The third series broadcast from 7 September 2008 to 10 April 2009. Regionally, the cast of the television series released a series of music albums such as &quot;Friends Forever&quot;, &quot;On Top of the World&quot;, &quot;Secrets &amp; Dreams&quot; and &quot;Hello World – The Best of the Saddle Club&quot;, and appeared in live performances such as the 2004 Sydney Royal Easter Show. A new Saddle Club CD, &quot;Best Friends&quot;, was sold in Australia in stores and on The Saddle Club&#x27;s website and in the US and Canada as a digital download.

The popularity of the series soon after its premiere on YTV and the ABC promoted international syndication and it made its American debut in January 2002 on Discovery Kids.

In the United States, the series later aired on Horse Racing TV and was distributed independently by Connecticut Public Television and American Public Television through public television stations nationwide, most notably PBS. The series also briefly aired in reruns on The Hub.

In Canada, it aired on YTV, and in the United Kingdom on CITV, Horse &amp; Country and Pop Girl. It was broadcast by the French children&#x27;s specialty channel Gulli, dubbed into French.

Series 3 was broadcast on Discovery Kids in the United States starting on February 22, 2009, while sneak views has been shown on &quot;Saddle Club Sundays&quot; in December 2008. In Australia, the new series commenced on Channel Nine and WIN TV on March 7, 2009.

WIN Television airs a compilation movie of &quot;Horse Shy&quot;, &quot;Mystery Weekend&quot; and &quot;School Horse&quot; (episode 6-8 of series 1) every Christmas Day since 2017.

<doc id="507893" wikidata="Q317667" url="?curid=507893" title="Viktor Khristenko">
<text>Viktor Borisovich Khristenko (; born 28 August 1957) is a Russian politician who was chairman of the board of the Eurasian Economic Commission from 1 February 2012 to 1 February 2016. He was First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia from 31 May 1999 to 10 January 2000 and Minister of Industry from 9 March 2004 to 31 January 2012.

==Early life and education==
Khristenko was born in Chelyabinsk on 28 August 1957. Kristenko graduated in 1979 from Chelyabinsk Mechanical Engineering Institute with a specialization in construction management and Economics. In 1983, he completed his Candidate of Sciences in Management at the Moscow Institute of Management. Khristenko has acknowledged the influence of Georgy Shchedrovitsky in his approach to management. He contributed three chapters to &quot;Methodological School of Management&quot;, a book based on the work of Shchedrovitsky&#x27;s Moscow Methodological Circle and its successors.

==Career==

===Ministerial posts in the Yeltsin Presidency===
In 1998, Viktor Khristenko was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister for Economy and Finance in Sergei Kiriyenko&#x27;s Cabinet. Described as a &quot;little-known reformist&quot;, his appointment drew quite some attention as it was seen as a sign towards economic reform under the Yeltsin Presidency. He however didn&#x27;t survive the government reshuffling under the following Prime Minister Primakov. From 1999 until early 2000, he was however appointed to Vladimir Putin&#x27;s First Cabinet serving as First Deputy Prime Minister.

===Ministerial posts in the Putin Presidency===
In February 2004, Khristenko briefly served as the acting Prime Minister of Russia, when President Vladimir Putin fired Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov on 24 February 2004.

Khristenko was described as a &quot;broadly reformist technocrat,&quot; who had shown &quot;loyalty mixed with extreme caution,&quot; unlike the outgoing prime minister who had &quot;openly disagreed with Mr Putin several times, criticizing the criminal investigations into the owners of Yukos. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called Kasyanov &quot;the most powerful ally of big business remaining in the Russian government.&quot; Khristenko, 46 at the time, was promoted from deputy prime minister to acting prime minister. Putin commented that Kasyanov&#x27;s ousting was not related to the results of the government&#x27;s activities, which he characterized as positive, but rather was caused by a necessity to once again confirm his position, which would guide the development of the country after 14 March 2004.

Two weeks ahead of the 2004 presidential election, Putin however nominated Mikhail Fradkov to become the next prime minister, four days later to be confirmed by the State Duma. On 9 March 2004, Kristenko was appointed Minister of Industry and Trade instead, a post which he held until 31 January 2012.

===Chairman of the Eurasian Economic Commission===
Khristenko became the first Chairman of the Eurasian Economic Commission, which started operations in February 2012. He resigned on 1 February 2016.

==Personal life==
Khristenko&#x27;s second wife, Tatyana Golikova, was Minister of Health and Social Development from 2007 to 2012. They married in 2003.

==Honours and awards==
* Order of Merit for the Fatherland;
**3rd class (3 October 2007) - for his great personal contribution to the economic policy of the state and many years of fruitful activity
**4th class (28 August 2006) - for his great personal contribution to the development of technical and economic cooperation between the states
* Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (2009)
* Gratitude of the President of the Russian Federation
* Diploma of the Russian Federation Government
* Order of the Holy Prince Daniel of Moscow, 1st class (Russian Orthodox Church, 2010)

<doc id="507899" wikidata="Q5602737" url="?curid=507899" title="Green Lake, Seattle">
<text>Green Lake is a neighborhood in north central Seattle, Washington. Its centerpiece is the lake and park after which it is named.

Its generally accepted boundaries are Interstate 5 to the east, beyond which lie Roosevelt and Maple Leaf; N 85th Street to the north, beyond which lies the neighborhood North College Park/Licton Springs; Aurora Avenue N (State Route 99) to the west, beyond which lies Phinney Ridge and Greenwood, and N 60th Street and Woodland Park to the south, beyond which lies Wallingford.

Its main thoroughfares are the circumferential road around the lake, known at different points as East Green Lake Way N, East Green Lake Drive N, West Green Lake Drive N, Aurora Avenue N, and West Green Lake Way N; N 65th, N 71st, and N 80th Streets (east- and westbound); Wallingford Avenue N and 1st, 5th, Latona, and Woodlawn Avenues NE (generally north- and southbound but following the contours of the shoreline at some points); Green Lake Drive N and NE Ravenna Boulevard (northwest- and southeast-bound); and Winona Avenue N (northeast- and southwest-bound).

David Phillips surveyed the Green Lake area in September 1855 for the United States Surveyor General. The first settler was Erhart Seifried with a homestead on the northeast shore of the lake in 1869. In 1891 a trolley line was extended from Fremont along the eastern shore and around the northern end of Green Lake. Also in 1891, Green Lake was annexed to Seattle.

There is an extensive variety of housing types in Green Lake. Since 1995, the neighborhood has undergone significant redevelopment. Many houses have been completely remodeled and enlarged, often with the addition of another floor. This is a consequence of Green Lake&#x27;s easy access to Downtown via both Interstate 5 and Aurora Avenue N.

The Green Lake Library, a Carnegie library that occupies and cost $35,000 to build, was opened in 1910. In 1999 the library held 54,000 catalogued items. It is part of the Seattle Public Library system.

Prior to the 1991 redistricting, Green Lake formed the center of Washington&#x27;s 32nd Legislative District. The well-organized and rather left-leaning Democratic Party organization of that district was widely known both to friend and foe alike as &quot;the Soviet of Green Lake&quot;, possibly an allusion to James Farley&#x27;s legendary (though possibly apocryphal) 1930s remark &quot;there are 47 States in the Union, and the Soviet of Washington&quot;.

Green Lake is home to Green Lake Elementary School, Daniel Bagley Elementary School, Bishop Blanchet High School, and Seattle Parks and Recreation Department&#x27;s Green Lake Small Craft Center (GLSCC). GLSCC is the site of both Green Lake Crew, a public rowing program, and the Seattle Canoe and Kayak Club.

There is also a 2.8-mile path around the lake for runners, bikers, skaters and walkers. Many others use the athletic fields or visit the park for boating, picnics and swimming.

==Landmarks==
Green Lake Library is an officially designated Seattle landmark. Other, unofficial landmarks include:
*Beth&#x27;s Cafe a notable restaurant in the Green Lake neighborhood since 1954
*Colson House is a historic house constructed in 1904 by Charles and Sophie Colson.

<text>François Rabbath (born 1931) is a contemporary French double-bass virtuoso, soloist, and composer.

==Career==
Rabbath was born into a Syrian family of musicians but his only instruction came from a book written by a Parisian bassist Edouard Nanny. In 1955 he went to Paris, hoping to meet Nanny, who had died nearly ten years prior to his arrival, but he continued to study, and in 1964 recorded for the first time.

In 1977 Rabbath began a collaboration with American composer Frank Proto. Proto has written five major works for double bass and orchestra especially for Rabbath who has premiered and recorded them all. Included are two of the most often-performed works in the double bass repertoire: &quot;A Carmen Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Nine Variants on Paganini.&quot; both for double bass and orchestra.

Rabbath&#x27;s major contribution to the field of bass pedagogy is represented in the three-volume &quot;Nouvelle technique de la contrebasse.&quot; The main differences in Rabbath&#x27;s approach from that of the double bass method of Franz Simandl is Rabbath&#x27;s use of the left hand and his detailed attention to the bow arm. In Simandl&#x27;s system, first position (below thumb position) encompasses only a whole step. In Rabbath&#x27;s method, the entire fingerboard is divided into only six positions, defined by the location of natural harmonics on the strings. Playing the bass with six positions is possible by using a technique called pivoting.

Pivots are often mistakenly called extensions or shifts. An extension is a widening of the hand to reach a new note (as outlined by Zimmermann). A pivot is a rocking of the hand to reach a new note where the thumb remains stationary but all fingers gain the technical freedom to move anywhere else possible/required. Pivots thus enable the fusing of several different positions at once.

By placing the thumb in an appropriate place and just rocking the hand back and forth the player can use for example Simandl&#x27;s half, 1st, and 2nd positions without the need for shifts. Usually, the thumb should be relatively behind the index finger or closer to the middle finger (when not in thumb position) so the bassist can fully utilize the weight of the left arm and have a very free pivot. The reason a pivot is not a shift is because the thumb does not move either on the string or behind the neck. A shift requires that the whole hand moves and results in a change of position.

Another technique used by Francois Rabbath is the crab technique, named for the way the hand movement resembles a crab&#x27;s sideways walking. The technique is outlined in the third volume of the rabbath method and allows for part of the hand to move while the other part remains and vice versa – in this way the hand can move up and down the string in certain passages without ever fully shifting. Rabbath is not the first person to use the Crab Technique but he is the first double bassist to name it and give it a thorough full technical exploration.

For example, similar exercises are found on the first page of Franco Petracchi&#x27;s &quot;Simplifed Higher Technique&quot;. Some small examples can be found in method books such as Simandl, but it is a point of contention whether these were intended as crabs or shifts as they do not contain textual explanations.

<text>[[Body horror]], biological horror, organic horror or visceral horror is horror fiction in which the horror is principally derived from the unnatural graphic transformation, degeneration or destruction of the physical body. Such works may deal with decay, disease, deformity, parasitism, mutation or mutilation. Other types of body horror include unnatural movements or the anatomically incorrect placement of limbs to create &quot;monsters&quot; from human body parts. David Cronenberg, Frank Henenlotter, Brian Yuzna, Stuart Gordon, Lloyd Kaufman, and Clive Barker are notable directors of this genre. The term &quot;body horror&quot; was coined with the &quot;Body Horror&quot; theme issue of the University of Glasgow film journal &quot;Screen&quot; (vol. 27, no. 1, January–February 1986), which contains several essays on the subject.

==Notable films and television series==

<doc id="507909" wikidata="Q6488840" url="?curid=507909" title="Larder Lake, Ontario">
<text>Larder Lake is an incorporated municipal township and eponymous constituent dispersed rural community in Timiskaming District in Northeastern Ontario, Canada. It is located along Ontario Highway 66 and Ontario Highway 624 at the north-western part of the lake bearing the same name. The area of the township is and includes the geographic townships of Hearst, McVittie and Skead.

Located within the &quot;Larder Lake-Cadillac Fault Zone&quot;, a geologic region rich in precious metals, the town was the site of the first gold rush in northeastern Ontario.

==History==
Gold in the area was originally reported in the late 1800’s by Chief Ignace Tonené of the Temagami First Nation. He staked a claim near the north arm of Larder Lake but claimed it was stolen. He reported it, but Indian Affairs was unable to help. Chief Tonenè Lake was named in his honour.

The discovery of silver in Cobalt, Ontario in 1903 led prospectors to search across northern Ontario for new finds. The discovery of gold led to 4,000 claims by the winter of 1906 and the eventual development of the Omega (1936-1947), Chesterville gold mine (1938-1952), and Kerr Addison gold mines (started in 1936).

H.L. Kerr explored the Larder Lake area in 1904, but did not find gold. He returned with his partner Bill Addison in 1906, and discovered traces of gold near the north arm of Larder Lake, next to Robert Reddick&#x27;s claims. Within months, 40 gold mining companies were established, and there was tremendous optimism and financial speculation. A mining investment company published an advertisement in the Ottawa Citizen in 1907 stating: &quot;The Larder Lake district is believed to be the richest gold country ever known, and it is just now being opened up. Soon will commence the most tremendous outpouring of gold known to civilization.&quot; Three-thousand men made their way to the area via canoe and portage to look for work, settling in a camp known as &quot;Larder City&quot;. Excitement led to disappointment, as no large deposits of gold were found, and most of the town was abandoned by 1911. The Kerr-Addison Gold Mine, between 1907 and 1911, was able to produce just $314 worth of gold, though that small output was used to mint Canada&#x27;s first $5 gold pieces.

In 1936, a large gold deposit was discovered in Larder Lake, leading to the establishment of several productive mines. In total 13 million ounces of gold were produced in the area.

Ontario Highway 66 was built in the 1930s to connect the various mining towns in the region. The highway connected Larder Lake to Kirkland Lake in the west, and to other mining communities to the east. The section between Kirkland Lake and Larder Lake was paved in 1944.

In 1937, a boat traveling across Larder Lake to Miller Island on a fishing expedition capsized, killing all 7 on board. Searchers discovered the boat filled with water, and slowly began to recover bodies. The boat&#x27;s captain, John C. Skinner, Chief Engineer of the Lake Shore Mining Company, had been warned by a forest ranger that the weather conditions were too dangerous for the journey.

The Lakeshore Hotel was destroyed by fire in 1938. Guests lost all their belongings, though no injuries were reported.

By 1941, labourers at Larder Lake&#x27;s Omega Gold Mine were earning $4.64 per day, and the mine captain was earning $8.70 per day. Omega was awarded the John T. Ryan Trophy in 1943 by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum for having the lowest accident frequency in Canada during the previous year.

The Catholic church in Larder Lake caught fire in 1947, just moments after Sunday mass. No injuries were reported, though all sacred vessels, organ drapes, vestments and pews were destroyed.

In 1952, the Larder Lake Fire Department took first place in a regional competition of the Timiskaming Firemen&#x27;s Association, beating 22 other fire brigades.

Larder Lake&#x27;s train station, located north-east of the town, was the site of a large robbery in 1965. Five gold bars worth $165,000 were awaiting shipment to the mint in Ottawa, when 4 armed men broke in. A float plane in Larder Lake was believed used in the getaway.

A damaging storm moved through northeastern Ontario on July 17, 2006, bringing with it winds of to . Approximately of forest southwest of Larder Lake suffered blowdown.

The 2010 Winter Olympics torch relay passed through Larder Lake on January 1, 2010.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Larder Lake had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<text>The DECstation was a brand of computers used by DEC, and refers to three distinct lines of computer systems—the first released in 1978 as a word processing system, and the latter (more widely known) two both released in 1989. These comprised a range of computer workstations based on the MIPS architecture and a range of PC compatibles. The MIPS-based workstations ran ULTRIX, a DEC-proprietary version of UNIX, and early releases of OSF/1.

== DECstation 78 ==
The first line of computer systems given the DECstation name were word processing systems based on the PDP-8. These
systems, built into a VT52 terminal, were also known as the VT78.

== DECstation RISC workstations ==

=== History ===
The second (and completely unrelated) line of DECstations began with the DECstation 3100, which was released on 11 January 1989. The DECstation 3100 was the first commercially available RISC-based machine built by DEC.

This line of DECstations was the fruit of an advanced development skunkworks project carried out in DEC&#x27;s Palo Alto Hamilton Ave facility. Known as the PMAX project, its focus was to produce a computer systems family with the economics and performance to compete against the likes of Sun Microsystems and other RISC-based UNIX platforms of the day. The brainchild of James Billmaier, Mario Pagliaro, Armando Stettner and Joseph DiNucci, the systems family was to also employ a truly RISC-based architecture when compared to the heavier and very CISC VAX or the then still under development PRISM architectures. At the time DEC was mostly known for their CISC systems including the successful PDP-11 and VAX lines.

Several architectures were considered from Intel, Motorola and others but the group quickly selected the MIPS line of microprocessors. The (early) MIPS microprocessors supported both big- and little-endian modes (configured during hardware reset). Little-endian mode was chosen both to match the byte ordering of VAX-based systems and the growing number of Intel-based PCs and computers.

In contrast to the VAX and the later DEC Alpha architectures, the DECstation 3100 and family were specifically designed and built to run a UNIX system, ULTRIX, and no version of the VMS operating system was ever released for DECstations. One of the issues being debated at the project&#x27;s inception was whether or not DEC could sustain, grow, and compete with an architecture it did not invent or own (manage). As the core advocates later left the company, the MIPS-based line of computers was shut down in favor of the Alpha-based computers, a DEC invented and owned architecture, descended from the PRISM development work.

The first generation of commercially marketed DEC Alpha systems, the DEC 3000 AXP series, were similar in some respects to contemporaneous MIPS-based DECstations, which were sold alongside the Alpha systems as the DECstation line was gradually phased out. Both used the TURBOchannel expansion bus for video and network cards, as well as being sold with the same TURBOchannel option modules, mice, monitors, and keyboards.

Later DECstations planned to be based on the ECL-based R6000 were canceled on 14 August 1990 after Bipolar Integrated Technology failed to deliver sufficient volumes of the microprocessor, which was difficult to fabricate. Yields of the R6000 were further reduced as DEC required the little-endian mode used from the beginning to continue to be available.

The MIPS-based DECstations were used as the first target system and development platform for the Mach microkernel, as well as early development of the Windows NT operating system. More recently, various free operating systems such as NetBSD and Linux/MIPS have been ported to the MIPS-based DECstations, extending their useful life by providing a modern operating system.

DEC originally planned to introduce OSF/1 as its chosen Unix product, starting with a 1.0 version in March 1992 that promised to offer several enhancements over ULTRIX, albeit with some deficiencies that were meant to be fixed in a 2.0 version scheduled for the summer of that year. However, during a period of strategic uncertainty only weeks later in 1992, DEC appeared to abandon plans to officially provide OSF/1 on MIPS-based DECstations, instead re-emphasising ULTRIX for these models whilst intending to offer OSF/1 for the company&#x27;s impending Alpha-based product lines. At this time, the DECstation 2100, 3100, 3100S, 5000/120, 5000/125 and 5000/200 models were stated as being able to run OSF/1, along with certain DECsystem models.

User dissatisfaction with the decision, driven by uncertainty about the future of the MIPS-based DECstations and ULTRIX, led to a revision of the company&#x27;s strategy, with DEC promising &quot;a production-quality version of OSF/1&quot; with support for all of the company&#x27;s Unix-based workstations and servers. Following on from the &quot;advanced developer&#x27;s kit&quot; - this being the version offering support for only certain models - the intention was to produce an &quot;end-user release&quot; of OSF/1 during 1993 for R2000-, R3000- and R4000-based models, offering compatibility with OSF/1 on Alpha. Alongside such plans, DEC would also continue to support ULTRIX on its R4000-based systems. The strategic confusion was blamed on power struggles within DEC, with the decision made to abandon further OSF/1 work on DECstations being attributed to an executive having gained control over the Unix workstation group, thus reportedly causing &quot;as much of an internal uproar as it did an external one&quot;.

At the end of 1992, company representatives were once again less certain about the prospects of delivering OSF/1 on the DECstation range, with the projected release in the first half of 1993 &quot;up in the air&quot; and under threat of being cancelled if sufficient interest were not forthcoming from software vendors. Internally, the marketing group for the DECstation had been able to convince DEC&#x27;s product strategy group that the loss in sales in failing to offer OSF/1 on the hardware would exceed the research and development costs involved in making it available, but company-wide spending cuts threatened such projects. Subsequent indications from DEC confirmed, without further elaboration, the cancellation of the product alongside increasing uncertainty around further hardware upgrades to the DECstation range beyond the planned R4400-based products. Shortly prior to the release of the DEC Alpha systems, a port of OSF/1 to the DECstation was completed, but it was not commercially released. As the previously announced strategy had &quot;fizzled&quot;, DEC representatives had reportedly &quot;informed ULTRIX customers that they should start planning to move to Alpha workstations running OSF/1 in 1993&quot;, having the effect of undermining customer confidence in both the DECstation line and in ULTRIX, but also raising more serious concerns about the company&#x27;s broader Unix strategy.

Although introduced before DEC started to pursue a strategy based on the Advanced Computing Environment platform, the company&#x27;s stated intention was that DECstation users could potentially migrate to an OSF/1-based product, potentially delivered in the form of SCO Open Desktop for the platform, offering binary compatibility with the existing ULTRIX system. DEC even suggested that Windows NT would be available for DECstation models, and Microsoft demonstrated NT running on Personal DECstation models. However, throughout the lifespan of the Alpha design activity, it had long been envisaged that VAX and MIPS binaries would be made to run on Alpha systems, leading to the development of the mx binary translator to run ULTRIX MIPS program images on Alpha-based DEC OSF/1 systems.

The GXemul project emulates several of these DECstation models.

=== Models ===

The original MIPS-based DECstation 3100 was followed by a cost reduced 2100. The DECstation 3100 was claimed to be the world&#x27;s fastest UNIX workstation at the time. When it was introduced it was about three times as fast as the VAXstation 3100 which was introduced at about the same time. Server configurations of DECstation models, distributed without a framebuffer or a graphics accelerator, both Turbochannel and Q-bus based, were called &quot;DECsystem&quot; but should not be confused with some PDP-10 machines of the same name.

Early models of the DECstation were heavily integrated systems with little expansion capability and do not even possess expansion buses. The DECstation 5000 systems, introduced later, improved on the lack of expansion capabilities by providing the TURBOchannel Interconnect. The DECstation 5000 systems are also ARC (Advanced RISC Computing) compatible. The last DECstation models focused on increased component integration by using more custom ASICs to reduce the number of discrete components. This began with the DECstation 5000 Model 240, which replaced discrete components with LSI ASICs and ended with the last model, the DECstation 5000 Model 260, which used a single VLSI ASIC for much of the control logic.

Packaged DECstation 5000 systems were sometimes suffixed with two or three letters. These letters refer to what graphics option the system has.

==== DECstation 3100 and DECstation 2100 ====

===== Processor =====

The DECstation 3100 and 2100 uses a R2000 processor, a R2010 floating point coprocessor and four R2020 write buffers. The R2000 uses an external 64 KB direct-mapped instruction cache and a 64 KB direct-mapped write-through data cache with a cache line size of four bytes. Four R2020 implement a four-stage write buffer to improve performance by permitting the R2000 to write to its write-through data cache without stalling.

The R2000 microprocessor could be configured to run either in big-endian or little-endian mode. In the DECstation family, the decision was made to run little-endian to maintain compatibility with both the VAX family and the growing population of Intel-based PC&#x27;s.

===== Memory =====
The DECstation 3100 and 2100&#x27;s memory system contains both the DRAM-based system memory and VRAM-based framebuffers. The amount of system memory supported is 4 to 24 MB, organized into six physical memory banks. These systems has 12 SIMM slots that use 2 MB SIMMs, with each SIMM containing 1,048,576 word × 18-bit DRAMs. The SIMMs are installed in pairs (in increments of 4 MB) and the memory system is byte-parity protected. The monochrome framebuffer are implemented with a 256 KB VFB01 SIMM and the color framebuffer, a 1 MB VBF02 SIMM. If one of these framebuffer SIMMs are not present, the framebuffer cannot be used. The SIMM slots were rated for 25 removal and insertion cycles, with five being the recommended limit.

===== Graphics =====

Graphics capability was provided by two frame buffer modules, the monochrome and color frame buffer. The monochrome frame buffer supports 1-bit color and a resolution of 1024 × 864 pixels, while the color frame buffer supports 8-bit color and the same resolution as the monochrome frame buffer. Both frame buffers use the Brooktree Bt478 RAMDAC with three 256-entry, 8-bit color maps. The hardware cursor is generated by DC503 PCC (Programmable Cursor Chip), which can provide a 16 × 16 pixel, 2-bit color cursor. The color frame buffer has an 8-bit write mask, also known as a &quot;planemask&quot;, used to select which pixels are to be updated. None of the framebuffers use all the memory provided by the frame buffer module, this being organized as 1024 × 1024 pixels, and thus only the uppermost 864 pixels are used for the display. Unused areas of the frame buffer memory may be used to store graphical structures such as fonts, although this was considered to offer &quot;no performance advantage over main memory&quot; and, in the context of the X server implemented by Digital, would have complicated the memory management involved. The frame buffers are not parity-protected, unlike the rest of the system memory. A DB15 male connector is used for video. The connector uses RS343A/RS170 compatible signals.

===== Ethernet and SCSI =====

These DECstations have onboard 10 Mbit/s Ethernet provided by an AMD 7990 LANCE (Local Area Network Controller for Ethernet) and an AMD 7992 SIA (Serial Interface Adapter), which implements the interface, a BNC ThinWire Ethernet connector. A 32 768 word × 16-bit (64 KB) network buffer constructed out of SRAMs is provided to improve performance. A 32 word by 8-bit Ethernet Station Address ROM (ESAR) provides the MAC address. It is mounted in a DIP socket and is removable.

The 5 MB/s single-ended SCSI interface is provided by a DC7061 SII gate array with a 64 K by 16-bit (128 KB) SCSI buffer used to improve performance. The SCSI interface is connected to the internal 3.5 drive bays and an external port (HONDA68 male connector) to be connected to drive expansion boxes.

===== Other =====

These systems have four asynchronous serial lines that are provided by a DC7085 gate array. Of the four serial lines, only the third line has the required modem control signals to support a modem. A 4-pin MMJ connector is provided for the keyboard line, a 7-pin DIN connector for mouse line, and two 6-pin MMJ connectors for printer and modem lines. The real time clock is a Motorola MC146818, which also has 50 bytes of RAM for storing console configuration information, and the 256 KB of ROM for storing boot-strap and self-test software is provided by two 128 KB ROMs in DIP sockets.

===== Enclosure =====

The enclosure used by the DECstation 3100 and 2100 is identical to the enclosure used by the VAXstation 3100 as these systems use a mechanically identical system module. The enclosure can accommodate two 3.5-inch drives, which are mounted on trays above the system module. The system module is located on the left of the enclosure and the power supply, which takes up a fourth of the space inside the enclosure, is located on the left.

==== Personal DECstation 5000 Series ====

The Personal DECstation 5000 Series are entry-level workstations, code named &quot;MAXine&quot;. The Personal DECstation uses a low-profile desktop case, which contained a power supply on the left and two mounts for two fixed drives, or one fixed drive and one diskette drive, at the front. The system logic was contained on two printed circuit boards, the base system module, which contained the majority of the logic, and the CPU module, which contained the processor.

Initial pricing for these 5000 series models started at $3,995 for a diskless 5000/20 with 8 MB of RAM and 17-inch greyscale display.

===== CPU module =====

There were three models of the CPU module, which contains the CPU subsystem. The first model contains a chipset consisting of a 20, 25 or 33 MHz R3000A CPU and R3010 FPU accompanied by a 64 KB instruction cache and a 64 KB data cache. Both caches are direct-mapped and have a 4-byte cache line. The data cache is write through. All components on the CPU module operate at the same clock frequency as the R300A.

A CPUCTL ASIC is also present, its purpose to provide interfacing and buffering between the faster CPU module and the slower 12.5 MHz system module. The CPUCTL ASIC also implements a 12.5 MHz TURBOchannel that serves as the system interconnect.

The second model is a revised version of the first module with a 20 or 25 MHz R3000A and R3010 that used plastic packaging, whereas the previous model used ceramic packaging. The third model contains a R4000 microprocessor with internal instruction and data caches complemented by a 1 MB secondary cache.

===== Memory =====

These systems have 8 MB of onboard memory and four SIMM slots that can be used to expand the amount of memory by 32 MB, for a total of 40 MB of memory. These SIMM slots accept 2 and 8 MB SIMMs in pairs. All SIMMs in the system must be of the same size. The memory bus is 40 bits wide, with 32 bits used for data and four bits used to for byte-parity. The Memory Control ASIC controls the memory and communicates with the CPU subsystem via the TURBOchannel bus.

===== Expansion =====

Expansion is provided by two TURBOchannel slots, each with 64 MB of physical address space.

===== Graphics =====

The Personal DECstation features an integrated 8-bit color frame buffer capable of a resolution of 1024 × 768 at a refresh rate of 72 Hz. The frame buffer consists of 1 MB of VRAM organized as 262,144 32-bit words, with each 32-bit word containing four 8-bit pixels. The frame buffer uses an INMOS IMS G332 RAMDAC with a 256-entry 24-bit color look up table, which selects 256 colors for display out of a palette of 16,777,216. The frame buffer is treated as part of the memory subsystem.

===== I/O subsystem =====

The I/O subsystem provides the system with an 8-bit single-ended SCSI bus, 10 Mbit/s Ethernet, serial line, the Serial Desktop Bus and analog audio. SCSI is provided by a NCR 53C94 ASC (Advanced SCSI Controller). Ethernet is provided by an AMD Am7990 LANCE (Local Area Network Controller for Ethernet) and an AMD Am7992 SIA (Serial Interface Adapter) that implements the AUI interface. A single serial port capable of 50 to 19,200 baud with full modem control capability is provided by a Zilog Z85C30 SCC (Serial Communications Controller). Analog audio and ISDN support is provided by an AMD 79C30A DSC (Digital Subscriber Controller). These devices are connected to IOCTL ASIC via two 8-bit buses or one 16-bit bus. The ASIC interfaces the subsystem to the TURBOchannel interconnect.

====DECstation 5000 Model 100 Series====

The DECstation 5000 Model 100 Series, code named &quot;3MIN&quot;, are mid-range workstations. Early models used a chipset consisting of a R3000A CPU and a R3010 CPU on 3- by 5-inch daughter card that plugs into a connector on the system module. The Model 150 replaces the R3000A and R3010 with a single R4000 with an integrated FPU. The Model 120 and 125 have two external caches, a 64 KB instruction cache and a 64 KB data cache. The Model 133 has a 128 KB instruction cache.

These systems support 16 to 128 MB of memory through 16 SIMM slots that accept 2 or 8 MB SIMMs. Only one type of SIMM may be used, 2 and 8 MB SIMMs cannot be mixed in the same system. The 2 MB SIMM is identical to the SIMM used in the DECstation 2100 and 3100, allowing upgrades from these older systems to the Model 100 Series to reuse the old memory.

Three TURBOchannel option slots are provided. The Model 100 Series introduces the I/O Controller ASIC (later known as the IOCTL ASIC), which interfaces the two 8-bit I/O buses to the 12.5 MHz TURBOchannel.

==== DECstation 5000 Model 200 Series ====

The DECstation 200 Series are high-end workstations. Server configurations of the DECstation 500 Model 200, 240 and 260 were known as the DECsystem 5000 Model 200, 240 and 260 respectively. These systems only contain a CPU module, a system module and a power supply located on left side of the enclosure. They do not have any internal storage capability. Drives were intended to be installed in external single- or multiple-drive enclosures. These enclosures were connected to system via a SCSI connector located at the rear of the system. Alternatively, storage was to be provided by a file server accessed over a network.

===== CPU subsystem =====

Each member of the Model 200 Series had a unique CPU subsystem. The Model 200&#x27;s CPU subsystem is located on the KN02 system module and contains a chipset composed of the R3000 CPU, R3010 FPU and R3220 MB (six-stage write/memory buffer). Also part of the subsystem is the processor&#x27;s external 64 KB instruction cache and 64 KB write-through data cache. In contrast, the Model 240&#x27;s CPU subsystem is located on a daughter card, the CPU module, and does not use a processor chipset, featuring a single 40 MHz R3400 instead. The R3400 integrates the R3000A CPU and the R3010 FPU in a single die and package. The processor&#x27;s external 64 KB instruction cache and 64 KB data cache is connected to the R3400 by a 40 MHz bus that also serves as the datapath to the MB ASIC. The Model 260&#x27;s CPU subsystem is also located on a CPU module daughter card, but it features a 120 MHz (60 MHz external) R4000 with internal instruction and data caches and an external secondary cache. The Model 260&#x27;s CPU subsystem is unique in the Model 200 Series as it contains the boot ROM firmware, unlike the other members, which have their boot ROM located in the system module. This difference is due to the R4000 requiring different firmware that could not be replaced when upgrading a Model 240 to a Model 260.

Differences in the provision of the CPU subsystem had an impact on the design of CPU upgrades to the DECstation range. &quot;Snap-in&quot; upgrades providing the R4000 CPU, designed as replacement CPU modules, were announced for &quot;all current DECstations&quot; in 1992. However, a CPU upgrade for the Model 200 required a replacement motherboard.

===== Memory subsystem =====

The Model 200 Series has 15 SIMM slots located on the system module that can hold 8 to 480 MB of memory. Proprietary 128-pin memory array modules (SIMMs) with capacities of 8 MB (39 1 Mbit DRAM chips) or 32 MB (39 4 Mbit DRAM chips) are used. All SIMMs installed in a system must be of the same size. If 8 MB SIMMs are used, the system may contain 8 to 120 MB of memory. If 32 MB SIMMs are used, the system may contain 32 to 480 MB of memory. The memory subsystem operates at 25 MHz and is 32 bits wide to match the native word length of the R3000. The memory subsystem is protected by an ECC scheme with seven bits of check for every 32-bit transaction.

The SIMMs are two-way interleaved using the low-order method, where even and odd memory addresses are treated as separate banks of memory. Interleaving the memory subsystem doubles the bandwidth of a non-interleaved memory subsystem using the same DRAMs, allowing the Model 200 Series to achieve an effective maximum bandwidth of 100 MB/s.

An optional 1 MB NVRAM module that provides a disk cache to improve performance can be installed in one of the SIMM slots (slot 14, the SIMM slot closest to the front edge of the system module). The module uses a battery to prevent data from being lost in case of power failure. The module is useful only when optional software is installed.

The Model 200 uses discrete components to implement the memory subsystem logic. In the Model 240, these discrete components are replaced by three ASICs, the MB ASIC, the MT ASIC and the MS ASIC. The MB (Memory Buffer) ASIC serves as an interface between the 40 MHz CPU module domain and the 25 MHz system module domain. It is connected to the MT ASIC, which serves as the memory controller. The MT ASIC provides memory control and refresh, handles memory DMA and transactions, and ECC checking. The MS (Memory Strobe) ASIC provides 15 sets of memory control lines and routes memory control signals from the MT ASIC to the destination SIMM. The MS ASIC replaces 16 discrete components used in the Model 200 and also generates the 25 MHz system clock signal, replacing a further three discrete components used in the Model 200.

===== Expansion =====

The Model 200 Series uses the TURBOchannel Interconnect for expansion and all models have three TURBOchannel option slots. The Model 200 provides 4 MB of physical address space for each TURBOchannel option, while the Model 240 and 260 provides 8 MB. TURBOchannel in the Model 240 and 260 is clocked at 25 MHz. In the Model 240 and 260, the MT ASIC implements TURBOchannel and serves as the controller.

===== I/O subsystem =====

The Model 200&#x27;s I/O subsystem is significantly different from the Model 240 and 260&#x27;s I/O subsystem. In the Model 200, Ethernet and SCSI capabilities are provided by two integrated TURBOchannel option modules, PMAD-AA for Ethernet and PMAZ-AA for SCSI. The PMAD-AA uses an AMD 7990 LANCE (Local Area Network Controller for Ethernet), which provides 10BASE-T Ethernet. The interface is implemented by an AMD 7992 SIA (Serial Interface Adapter) and a BNC ThinWire connector. The 8-bit, single-ended SCSI bus is provided by an NCR 53C94 ASC (Advanced SCSI Controller). Both integrated option modules have 128 KB of SRAM each serving as a buffer to improve performance. Four serial lines are also provided for the keyboard, mouse, communications port and printer. These lines are implemented by two DC7085s. A Dallas Semiconductor DS1287 real time clock with 50 bytes of NVRAM is also featured, as is a 256 KB system boot-strap and diagnostic ROM in a socket.

In contrast, the Model 240&#x27;s and 260&#x27;s I/O subsystem is based around an I/O Controller ASIC that serves as a bridge between TURBOchannel and the two I/O buses it implements. I/O devices such as the two Zilog Z85C30 SCCs (Serial Communications Controller), a NCR 53C94 ASC, an AMD 7990 LANCE, Dallas Semiconductor DS1287 real time clock and system ROM are connected to the I/O buses. The I/O Controller ASIC was not introduced by the Model 240, it was first featured in the Model 100 series, but the ASIC used in the Model 240 differs by being clocked twice as high, at 25 MHz instead of 12.5 MHz. The Model 240&#x27;s I/O subsystem would later be used in the DEC 3000 AXP in a modified form.

=== Graphics ===

DECstation systems with TURBOchannel slots could use TURBOchannel-based framebuffers, 2D graphics accelerators and 3D graphics accelerators.

==== Framebuffers ====

*CX &quot;Color Frame-Buffer Graphics Module&quot;, model PMAG-BA. It was capable of 8-bit color at a resolution of 1024 × 864.
*HX &quot;Smart Frame-Buffer Graphics Module&quot;, models PMAGB-BA/BC/BE. The HX is a framebuffer with a custom ASIC with limited, but very fast, 2D acceleration capabilities.
*MX &quot;Monochrome Frame-Buffer Graphics Module&quot;, model PMAG-AA. The MX is capable of 1-bit color at a resolution of 1280 × 1024 with a refresh rate of 72 Hz.
*TX &quot;True Color Frame-Buffer Graphics Module&quot;, models PMAG-JA, PMAGB-JA. Both models were capable of 24-bit color at a resolution of 1280 × 1024. The two models differ only in refresh rate, the PMAG-JA had a 66 Hz refresh rate and the PMAGB-JA, 72 Hz.

====2D graphics accelerators====
*PX &quot;2D Graphics Accelerator&quot;. The PX was based on the PixelStamp architecture, but without the geometry engine, meaning that it could only accelerate 2D graphics. It was superseded by the HX at some point in most applications.

==== 3D graphics accelerators ====

These options were:

* The PXG, also known as the &quot;Lo 3D Graphics Accelerator&quot; or the &quot;Mid 3D Graphics Accelerator&quot; depending on configuration
* The PXG+, also known as the &quot;Lo 3D Plus Graphics Accelerator&quot; or the &quot;Mid 3D Plus Graphics Accelerator&quot; depending on configuration
* The PXG Turbo, also known as the &quot;Hi 3D Graphics Accelerator&quot;
* The PXG Turbo+, also known as the &quot;Hi 3D Plus Graphics Accelerator&quot;

All PXG variants are capable of either 8-bit or 24-bit color, a resolution of 1280 × 1024 and a refresh rate of either 66 or 72 Hz. The PXG also has an 8-bit or 24-bit Z-buffer and is double buffered. The color depth and the depth of Z-buffer can be extended by installing additional VSIMMs or Z-buffer modules on the module. The PXG Turbo variants are capable of 24-bit color, a resolution of 1280 × 1024 and a refresh rate of either 66 or 72 Hz. They differ by featuring a 24-bit buffer for storing off-screen pixmaps in addition to the 24-bit Z-buffer and double buffer.

These 3D graphics accelerators implemented Digital&#x27;s proprietary PixelStamp architecture, which is derived from two research projects, &quot;Pixel Planes&quot; from the University of North Carolina and &quot;The 8 by 8 Display&quot; from the Carnegie Mellon University.

The PixelStamp architecture is a geometry pipeline that consists of a DMA engine, a geometry engine and a PixelStamp. The DMA engine interfaces the pipeline to the system via TURBOchannel, receiving packets from the CPU and sending them to the geometry engine. The geometry engine consists of an amount of SRAM and an Intel i860. Packets from the DMA engine are stored in the SRAM, where they are processed by the i860, which writes the results to a FIFO.

The PixelStamp consists of a STIC (STamp Interface Chip) ASIC and one or two STAMP ASICs. The STIC fetches the results in the FIFO and passes them on to the STAMP ASIC(s), which performs scan conversion and other graphical functions. Once the data has been processed by the STAMP ASICs, the result, which consists of RGB data, is written into the framebuffer built from VSIMMs (a SIMM with VRAMs) that are located on the graphics accelerator option module to be displayed.

These graphics accelerators can be grouped into two distinct categories, the double-width options and the triple-width options. The PXG and PXG+ are double-width TURBOchannel option modules and the PXG Turbo and PXG Turbo+ are triple-width TURBOchannel option modules. Models suffixed with a &quot;+&quot; are higher performance models of the base model, with a 44 MHz i860 instead of a 40 MHz i860 and STIC and STAMP ASICs that operate at clock frequencies 33% higher. Models suffixed with &quot;Turbo&quot; differ by featuring 256 KB of SRAM and two STAMP ASICs instead of 128 KB of SRAM and one STAMP ASIC. Models known as a &quot;Lo 3D Graphics Accelerator&quot; or a &quot;Lo 3D Plus Graphics Accelerator&quot; can be upgraded to a &quot;Mid 3D Graphics Accelerator&quot; or a &quot;Mid 3D Plus Graphics Accelerator&quot; by installing more VSIMMs and Z-buffer modules.

===Multimedia===

Depending on the model of DECstation, some systems were capable of performing video conferencing, high-quality audio output and video input. These were achieved through the use of TURBOchannel option modules and external peripherals. Video input was achieved by using the DECvideo (also known as the PIP (Picture-in-Picture) live-video-in) option, a daughterboard that plugs into the TX framebuffer to provide NTSC, PAL and SECAM input. When this option was used in conjunction with a video camera, a microphone and the required software, the DECstation can be used for video conferencing.

Audio capabilities were provided by the DECaudio TURBOchannel option module, which contained two AMD 79C30A DSC (Digital Subscriber Controller) devices and a Motorola 56001 DSP. The two AMD 79C30A DSCs were used for voice-quality audio input and output, while the Motorola 56001 was used for high-quality audio. The DSP was initially not used, due to the firmware being incomplete, although the capability was provided later in an update.

The DECspin software, introduced for the DECstation 5000 and Personal DECstation 5000 models, utilised DECmedia, DECvideo and DECaudio cards to provide videoconferencing capabilities to up to six users over a local area network and, via a DECnet router, over a dedicated long distance communications link. Pricing for this software at its introduction in 1992 started at $2,995 per workstation.

== DECstation PCs ==
Confusingly, simultaneous with the launch of the DECstation workstation line, Digital also announced a range of DECstation-branded PC compatibles with Intel x86 processors that ran MS-DOS. These were identified by three-digit model numbers; the DECstation 2xx, 3xx and 4xx series using the Intel 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors respectively. These computers were not built by Digital, but by Tandy Corporation in the United States and Olivetti in Europe. At the time of introduction, Digital offered a trade-in program for owners of its earlier x86, but PC incompatible, computer, the Rainbow 100.

Systems based on the 80286 are:

* DECstation 210
* DECstation 220
* DECstation 212
* DECstation 212LP

Systems based on the 80386 are:

* DECstation 316
* DECstation 316+
* DECstation 316sx
* DECstation 320
* DECstation 320+
* DECstation 320sx
* DECstation 325c
* DECstation 333c

Systems based on the 80486 are:

* DECstation 420sx
* DECstation 425c
* DECstation 433T
* DECstation 433W
* DECstation 450dx2
