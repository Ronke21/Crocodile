<text>Manchester Town Hall is a Victorian, Neo-gothic municipal building in Manchester, England. It is the ceremonial headquarters of Manchester City Council and houses a number of local government departments. The building faces Albert Square to the north and St Peter&#x27;s Square to the south, with Manchester Cenotaph facing its southern entrance. 

Designed by architect Alfred Waterhouse, the town hall was completed in 1877. The building contains offices and grand ceremonial rooms such as the Great Hall which is decorated with Ford Madox Brown&#x27;s imposing &quot;Manchester Murals&quot; illustrating the history of the city. The entrance and Sculpture Hall contain busts and statues of influential figures including Dalton, Joule and Barbirolli. The exterior is dominated by the clock tower which rises to and houses Great Abel, the clock bell. 

In 1938, a detached Town Hall Extension was completed and is connected by two covered bridges over Lloyd Street. The town hall was designated as a Grade I listed building on 25 February 1952. Both the building and the adjacent Albert Square have been closed since 2018 for refurbishment and are scheduled to be reopened in summer 2026. 

==History==

===Old Town Hall===
Manchester&#x27;s original civic administration was housed in the Police Office in King Street. It was replaced by the first Town Hall, to accommodate the growing local government and its civic assembly rooms. The Town Hall, also located in King Street at the corner of Cross Street, was designed by Francis Goodwin and constructed between 1822 and 1825, much of it by David Bellhouse. The building was designed with a screen of Ionic columns across a recessed centre, in a classicising manner strongly influenced by John Soane. The building was long and deep, the ground floor housed committee rooms and offices for the Chief Constable, Surveyor, Treasurer, other officers and clerks. The first floor held the Assembly Rooms. The building and land cost £39,587.

As the size and wealth of the city grew, largely as a result of the textile industry, its administration outstripped the existing facilities, and a new building was proposed. The King Street building was subsequently occupied by a lending library and then Lloyds Bank. The façade was removed to Heaton Park in 1912, when a bank, 53 King Street was erected on the site.

===New Town Hall===
Planning for the new town hall began in 1863. Manchester Corporation demanded it be, &#x27;equal if not superior, to any similar building in the country at any cost which may be reasonably required&#x27;. The choice of location was influenced by a desire to provide a central, accessible, but relatively quiet site in a respectable district, close to Manchester&#x27;s banks and municipal offices, next to a large open area, suitable for the display of a fine building. After investigating suitable sites, including Piccadilly, an oddly shaped plot facing Albert Square was chosen. The Albert Square frontage measures , Lloyd Street is , Princess Street the longest at and Cooper Street measures . On this tight site, the corporation built a grand hall, a suite of reception rooms, quarters for the lord mayor, offices and a council chamber.

The second stage of a competition to design the town hall which attracted 137 entries was judged by Thomas Leverton Donaldson, a classicist, and gothicist George Edmund Street. The eight finalists were Waterhouse, William Lee, Speakman &amp; Charlesworth, Cuthbert Brodrick, Thomas Worthington, John Oldrid Scott, Thomas Henry Wyatt and Edward Salomons. In terms of design and aesthetics, Waterhouse&#x27;s proposal was placed fourth behind those of Speakman &amp; Charlesworth, Oldrid Scott and Worthington but his design was considered far superior in architectural quality, layout and use of light and he was appointed architect on 1 April 1868.

The foundation stone was laid on 26 October 1868 by the Mayor, Robert Neill. Construction took nine years and used 14 million bricks. Estimates for the cost of construction vary from £775,000 to around £1 million, translating to between £ and £ in 2025. When Queen Victoria refused to attend, Manchester Town Hall was opened on 13 September 1877 by the mayor, Abel Heywood, who had championed the project.

===Town Hall Extension===
In 1927, a competition to design the Town Hall Extension was won by Emanuel Vincent Harris, the architect who also won a competition to design the city&#x27;s Central Library. Work began on the extension in 1934 and was completed by 1938. Charles Herbert Reilly, a contemporary architecture critic, thought the extension was &#x27;dull&#x27; and &#x27;drab&#x27; while Nikolaus Pevsner considered it was Harris&#x27;s best work. It is linked to the town hall by glazed pedestrian bridges at first-floor level.

===21st-century refurbishment===
By late 2014, the Town Hall was being described as &quot;being in urgent need of essential repair&quot; and modernisation. In a 2014 report, Manchester City Council highlighted the need to replace the building&#x27;s heating and electrical systems, refurbish windows and high-level stonework and repair parts of the roofing. Over 500 timber windows will be restored as part of this renovation project. The building temporarily closed to visitors in 2018 to undergo a £330 million renovation project. The refurbishment has been both over-budget and late, with the building now scheduled to be re-opened in summer 2026.

==Architecture==

The rapid growth and accompanying pollution in Victorian cities caused great problems for architects including denial of light, overcrowding, awkward sites, noise, accessibility and visibility of buildings, and air pollution. Provision for &quot;the sufficiency of window light supplied throughout the building&quot; was addressed by the use of architectural devices: suspended first floor rooms, made possible by the use of iron-framed construction, skylights, extra windows and dormers, &quot;borrowed lights&quot; for interior spaces and glazed white bricks in conjunction with mosaic marble paving in areas where the light was &quot;less strong&quot;. Clear glass was used in important rooms, with light-coloured tints for coloured glazing, as &quot;the sky of Manchester does not favour the employment of deeply stained glass.&quot;

The building exemplifies the Victorian Gothic revival style of architecture, using themes and elements from 13th-century Early English Gothic architecture. Gothic features most prominent in the Manchester Town Hall are low rib vault ceilings and tall arched windows. The choice of the Gothic was influenced by the wish for a spiritual acknowledgement of Manchester&#x27;s late medieval heritage in the textile trade of the Hanseatic league and an affirmation of modernity in the fashionable neo-Gothic style favoured over the Neoclassical architecture of Liverpool.

Despite its medieval styling, the building was designed to support the practical technologies of the 19th century. It had gas lighting, and a warm-air heating system, which provided fresh air drawn through ornamental stone air inlets below the windows and admitted behind the hot water pipes and &#x27;coils&#x27; into the rooms. Warmed, fresh air was fed into the stairwells and through hollow shafts within the spiral staircases to ventilate the corridors. Pipes supplying gas for lighting were ingeniously concealed underneath the banister rails of the spiral staircases. Waterhouse designed the building structure to be fireproof, using a combination of concrete and wrought-iron beams.

===Exterior===

In mid-19th-century Manchester, many important Georgian buildings were blackened by atmospheric pollution. By the 1870s the local soft red Collyhurst sandstone was deemed to be unsuitable for public buildings, and tough Pennine sandstones were preferred. The architectural competition entries were judged in part on their suitability for the &quot;climate of the district&quot;, and sample stone types were investigated. Waterhouse believed it was a matter of great difficulty to find a stone &quot;proof against the evil influences of the peculiar climate of Manchester&quot; but decided that the Bradford Dale-quarried Spinkwell Stone and Bolton Woods Stone/Gaisby Rock/Elland Flags stone would resist &quot;the deleterious influences of Manchester atmosphere&quot;. The interior decoration was chosen with a view to providing permanent colour and cleanable surfaces. Public corridors were faced with terracotta rather than plaster, and extensive use was made of stone vaulted ceilings, tiled dados and washable mosaic floors.

Waterhouse&#x27;s design used a Gothic style with limited carved decoration and a uniform colour, a departure from the high Victorian heaviness and colour used in contemporary Ruskinian Gothic buildings, and was criticised by some Manchester inhabitants for not being Gothic enough. The decision to spend large amounts of money on a building &quot;when most of its architectural effect would be lost because ruined by soot and made nearly invisible by smoke&quot; was criticised. Waterhouse avoided using a polychrome scheme as seen in High Victorian Gothic buildings such as St Pancras railway station believing it to be impractical as Manchester&#x27;s industrial atmosphere would quickly ruin the effect and decided a uniform stone exterior was the better solution. Statues of notable figures in the city&#x27;s history decorate its exterior, that of Agricola, founder of the Roman fort is over the main door and over its gable is a statue of St George. Statues of Thomas Grelley, first lord of the manor, Humphrey Chetham and Thomas de la Warre are among six at the corner of Albert Square and Princess Street. Waterhouse&#x27;s design proved successful and although its exterior was blackened by the late 1890s, the stonework was in a suitable condition to be cleaned and restored to its original appearance in the late 1960s.

===Clock tower===

The tall bell tower, the 19th tallest building in Manchester as of February 2023, houses a carillon of 23 bells: 12 are hung for full circle change ringing and were manufactured by John Taylor Bellfounders. The clock bell, &quot;Great Abel&quot;, named after Abel Heywood, weighs 8 tons 2.5 cwt and four of 12 ringing bells are used for the Westminster Clock Chime. Its clock, made by Gillett and Bland (predecessor of Gillett and Johnston), was originally wound using hydraulic power supplied by Manchester Hydraulic Power. The clock bell first rang on New Year&#x27;s Day 1879, but cracked, was replaced in 1882, and then recast with all the bells in 1937. Its clock face bears the inscription &quot;Teach us to number our Days&quot;, from Psalm 90:12. The clock bell is inscribed with the initials AH for Abel Heywood and the line &quot;Ring out the false, ring in the true&quot; from Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Ring Out, Wild Bells&quot;.

As of 2017, Change-Ringing is not currently permitted on the bells, due to the necessity of a restoration to the building. 
===Interior===
Waterhouse&#x27;s plan for the town hall bridged the gap between office and ceremonial requirements and maximised space on its triangular site. His design for a six-storey building filled the asymmetrical site. Set around its perimeter is a cloister of corridors linking offices and everyday workings. Its grandiose, ceremonial features are centrally located. By the main entrance on Albert Square are two grand staircases leading to the landing outside its Great Hall. The stairs have low risers allowing access for women in Victorian dress. The walls of the staircases have tall, arched windows admitting daylight. Three spiral staircases accessing the first floor from entrances on Princess Street, Lloyd Street and Cooper Street are constructed in English, Scottish and Irish granite.

====Sculpture Hall====
The ground-floor Sculpture Hall contains statues and busts of people who made significant contributions to Manchester, the Anti-Corn Law campaigners, Richard Cobden and John Bright, and scientists John Dalton and James Joule among many others. The room measures 53 feet by 33 feet and has a groin vaulted ceiling, constructed out of Bath stone. The Sculpture Hall Café is now located here.

====Great Hall====

The landing has a glazed skylight on which the names of mayors, lord mayors and chairs of the council since Manchester received its Charter of Corporation in 1838 are inscribed on glass panes. The landing has a mosaic floor with a pattern of bees and cotton flowers, both symbols of Manchester. Influential Victorian critic John Ruskin described the Great Hall as &quot;The most truly magnificent Gothic apartment in Europe.&quot;

The rectangular hall measures by . Natural light permeates from seven high windows on either side of the hall from the courtyards outside. It has a wagon roof, its ceiling divided into panels bearing the arms of countries and towns with which Manchester traded at the zenith of its mercantile power. &quot;The Manchester Murals&quot; by Ford Madox Brown, a sequence of 12 paintings depicting the history of Manchester decorate its walls. They are not true frescoes but use the Gambier Parry process.

The organ installed by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll in 1877 stands tall and had more than 5,000 pipes, five manuals and 65 speaking stops. Cavaillé-Coll cleaned it and added the solo organ in 1893. In 1912, T.C. Lewis of Brixton rebuilt it and added the echo division. Jardine of Manchester&#x27;s minor rebuild in 1970 added the mobile five-manual console.

===Reception===
The town hall is a Grade I listed building, one of fifteen Grade I listed buildings in Manchester; it is regarded as one of the finest interpretations of Gothic revival architecture in the world.

F. A. Bruton wrote that &quot;The Town Hall ... is best viewed when the Square is empty and silent, as, for example, on Saturday afternoon or Sunday, and it is then that we may realise what a splendid &quot;ruin&quot; it will make, to excite the wonder of the South Sea Islander of the future&quot;.

James Stevens Curl described it as &quot;a High-Victorian Gothic secular masterpiece that combines eclectic elements to form a style that can only be Victorian&quot;. It was voted Greater Manchester&#x27;s favourite building by readers of the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; in 2012, and in the same year featured in a series of Royal Mail stamps commemorating British landmarks.

==Current use==
Council meetings are no longer regularly held in the town hall, but in the Town Hall Extension. The hall now has a number of other uses. It is licensed for weddings and civil partnerships and is available to hire for conferences and other events. Tours of the clock tower are available through external tour companies at a cost.

As the town hall bears some resemblance to the Palace of Westminster, it has been used as a location for television and films. The original version of the political thriller &quot;House of Cards&quot; (1990) and the 2003 BBC drama series &quot;State of Play&quot; both used the town hall to represent Westminster. The films &quot;Ali G Indahouse&quot; (2001), &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2008), &quot;The Iron Lady&quot; (2011), &quot;Victor Frankenstein&quot; (2014), and &quot;A Very English Scandal&quot; (2018) also all used the town hall as a stand-in for the interiors of the Palace of Westminster.

In 2014, a 24-hour police station reopened in the town hall, having been closed since 1937. Unlike the original, the new station does not include custody cells, but officers are able to conduct interviews there. Chief Superintendent Nick Adderley described the location as &quot;perfectly placed in the hub of the city&quot; and suitable to &quot;serve the needs of the public 24 hours a day&quot;.

Overnight on 23 June and into 24 June 2016, the venue was used to announce the official result of the EU Referendum by the chair of the Electoral Commission acting as Chief Counting Officer (CSO) Jenny Watson.

<text>Glen Iris railway station is a commuter railway station in Glen Iris, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The station opened on 24 March 1890 as part of the branch line from Burnley to Waverley Road station. The station consists of one island platform accessed by a pedestrian underpass. There is one principal station building located towards the Down end of the platform. The single-story building, constructed in 1975 as part of the station&#x27;s rebuild, acts as a shelter and has toilet facilities. The station is only partially accessible due to steep access ramps.

Glen Iris railway station is served by the Glen Waverley line, part of the Melbourne railway network. The station also connects to the route 6 tram service and the routes 612 and 734 bus services as well. The journey to Southern Cross railway station is approximately 11.52 kilometres (7.16 mi) and takes 25 minutes.

==Description==

Glen Iris railway station is located in the suburb of Glen Iris, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. The station is located nearby to the High Street shopping precinct and the Glen Iris Wetlands. The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency, and the station is operated by Metro Trains. The station is approximately 11.52 kilometres (7.16 mi), or a 25-minute train journey, from Southern Cross station. The adjacent stations are Gardiner station, up towards Melbourne, and Darling station, down towards Glen Waverley.

The station consists of one island platform with a total of two platform edges. Standard in Melbourne, the platform has an asphalt surface with concrete on the edges. The platforms are approximately long, enough for a Metro Trains 7 car HCMT. The station features a pedestrian underpass, accessed from the centre of the platforms by a ramp. The station features one principal station building present on the island platform, built in 1975. These buildings act as shelter and toilet facilities, and are constructed with painted wood, metal sheeting, and ribbed roofing panels.

The station building and platform are largely the same as when it was rebuilt in 1975, with the main change being updated signage and technology. The station features 50 car-parks on the north side of the station, with no secure bike parking available onsite. The station is listed as partially accessible due to steep access ramps.&quot;&quot;

==History==
Glen Iris railway station was opened on 24 March 1890, with the line through the station originally built to link Burnley to the Outer Circle line at Waverley Road, before continuing onto Oakleigh. The station was named after a residence that was built by solicitor J.C. Turner. The land on which the residence was built was acquired by a local settler, who travelled to Victoria on a ship named &quot;Iris&quot;. The line underwent numerous extensions over its life, with extensions to East Malvern in 1929 and to Glen Waverley in 1930. In December 1922, the line through the station was electrified, with duplication of the line to Darling occurring in 1956.&quot;&quot; The line was fully duplicated to Glen Waverley by 1964.

In 1970, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the High Street level crossing, located at the down end of the station, with the signal box abolished also around this time. The station was rebuilt in 1975 to coincide with the construction of the South Eastern Arterial link, with parcel facilities abolished at this time. In 1992, pedestrian gates were provided at High Street—located just down from the station platforms. Minor upgrades have occurred at the station since 1975, primarily technological and signage upgrades.

On 3 March 2022, a serious incident occurred at the level crossing down from the station, with a car being stuck and causing the train to be damaged. Despite the lack of injuries, debate was reignited regarding the removal of the level crossing, with the creation of a community petition to campaign for the removal of the crossing. The Liberal Party promised to remove the crossing alongside others on the Glen Waverley line if elected in 2022, however, they weren&#x27;t successful in their election bid.

==Platforms and services==
Glen Iris has one island platform with two faces. The station is currently served by the Glen Waverley line — a service on the metropolitan rail network. The Glen Waverley line runs from Glen Waverley station south east of Melbourne, joining the Belgrave, Lilydale, and Alamein lines at Burnley station, before travelling through the City Loop.

<doc id="506201" wikidata="Q388443" url="?curid=506201" title="Major Oak">
<text>The Major Oak is a large English oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;) near the village of Edwinstowe in the midst of Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire, England. According to local folklore, it was Robin Hood&#x27;s shelter where he and his merry men slept. It weighs an estimated 23 tons, has a girth of 33 feet (10 metres), a canopy of 92 feet (28 metres), and is about 800–1,000 years old. In 2014, it was voted &#x27;England&#x27;s Tree of the Year&#x27; by a public poll by the Woodland Trust, receiving 18% of the votes. Its name originates from Major Hayman Rooke&#x27;s description of it in 1790.

==Shape==
There are several theories as to how it became so huge and oddly shaped. The Major Oak may be several trees that fused together as saplings, or the tree could have been pollarded. (Pollarding is a system of tree management that enabled foresters to grow more than one crop of timber from a tree, causing the trunk to grow large and thick.) However, there is only limited evidence for this theory as none of the other trees in the surrounding area were pollarded.

This enormous tree is commonly thought to be the UK&#x27;s second-largest oak tree, only truly surpassed by the gigantic Majesty Oak in Fredville Park, in the village of Nonington, near Dover, Kent.

==History==
Support chains were first fitted to the tree in 1908, and its massive limbs have been partially supported by an elaborate system of scaffolding since the 1970s. In 1974, fences were installed around the tree to protect it from root damage, since the number of visitors to the tree was compacting the soil around it.

The formation sign of the 46th Infantry Division of the British Army in the Second World War was the Major Oak. Among the units of the division were battalions of the Sherwood Foresters regiment.

In a 2002 survey, it was voted &quot;Britain&#x27;s favourite tree&quot;.

Also in 2002, a person illegally attempted to sell acorns claimed to be from the Major Oak on an internet-based auction website.

In 2003, in Dorset a plantation was started of 260 saplings grown from acorns of the Major Oak. The purpose was to provide publicity for an internet-based study of the Major Oak, its history, photographic record, variation in size and leafing of the saplings, comparison of their DNA, and an eventual public amenity.

The Major Oak was featured on the 2005 television programme &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot; as one of the wonders of the Midlands.

It was voted &#x27;England&#x27;s Tree of the Year&#x27; in 2014, and came sixth in the European Tree of the Year finals in 2015.

The threat to the Major Oak from fracking is the subject of a song by English musician Beans on Toast on his 2017 album &quot;Cushty&quot;.

In July 2020 the tree was reported as vandalised, with a three-foot section of bark fallen off.

<doc id="506202" wikidata="Q4917973" url="?curid=506202" title="Bishop of Sheffield">
<text>The Bishop of Sheffield is the Ordinary of the Church of England Diocese of Sheffield in the Province of York.

A similar title was first created as a suffragan see in the Diocese of York in 1901. John Quirk, the only Bishop suffragan of Sheffield assisted the Archbishop of York in overseeing that diocese. Under George V, the Diocese of Sheffield was created out of the south-western part of the Diocese of York in 1914. The bishop&#x27;s residence is Bishopscroft, Ranmoor — west-south-west of the city centre.

On 31 January 2017, it was announced that Philip North had been nominated to translate to Sheffield before June 2017, but North withdrew his acceptance of the nomination in March officially citing &quot;personal reasons&quot;. Since his nomination, there had been a number of public articles challenging the appropriateness of his appointment, based on his rejection of the ordination of priests who are women and the number of priests in Sheffield diocese who are women.

On 7 April 2017, it was announced that Pete Wilcox was to be consecrated Bishop of Sheffield on 22 June 2017. He was elected to the See by the college of canons of Sheffield Cathedral on 5 May 2017; and his election was confirmed on 5 June 2017 at York Minster.

==List of bishops==

==Assistant bishops==
Among those who have served the diocese as assistant bishops have been:
*1947–1971: Vincent Gerard, Vicar of Rotherham (until 1960), then Canon Residentiary of Sheffield Cathedral (until 1969) and former Bishop of Waiapu
*19631966 (ret.): Michael Hollis, Rector of Todwick (until 1964) and former Bishop in Madras
*1943 (ret.)1947 (d.): Samuel Heaslett, retired Bishop of South Tokyo and Presiding Bishop, Nippon Sei Ko Kai

<text>Ödön Beöthy (1796–1854), Hungarian deputy and orator, was born in Nagyvárad, Hungary (today Oradea, Romania), his father being a retired officer and deputy lord-lieutenant of Bihar County.

At the age of sixteen he served in the war against Napoleon, and was present at the great battle of Leipzig. Like so many others of his compatriots, he picked up Liberal ideas abroad. He was sent to parliament by his county in 1826 and again in 1830, but did not become generally known until the session of 1832–1836, when along with Ferenc Deák he, as a liberal Catholic, defended the Protestant point of view in the mixed marriages question. He was also an energetic advocate of freedom of speech. After parliament rose he carried his principles to their logical conclusion by marrying a Protestant lady and, being denied a blessing on the occasion by an indignant bishop, publicly declared that he could very well dispense with such blessings.

In 1841 he was elected deputy lord-lieutenant of his county to counteract the influence of the lord-lieutenant, Lajos Tisza, and powerfully promoted the popular cause by his eloquence and agitation. After 1843 the conservatives succeeded in excluding him both from parliament and from his official position in the county; but during the famous March Days (1848) he regained all his authority, becoming at the same time a commander of militia, a deputy and lord-lieutenant. At the first session of the Upper House (5 July 1848), he moved that it should be radically reformed, and during the war of Independence he energetically served the Hungarian government as a civil commissioner and lord justice.

Towards the end of the war he reappeared as a deputy at the Szeged diet, and on the flight of the government took refuge first with Richard Cobden in London and subsequently in Jersey, where he made the acquaintance of Victor Hugo. Thence he went to Hamburg, to meet his wife, and died there on 7 December 1854. Beöthy was a man of extraordinary ability and character, and an excellent debater. He also exercised as much influence socially over his contemporaries as politically, owing to his unfailing tact and pleasant wit.

<text>Traunstein is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the southeastern part of Bavaria, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) Mühldorf, Altötting, the Austrian states Upper Austria and Salzburg, the district Berchtesgadener Land, the Austrian states of Salzburg and Tyrol, and the district Rosenheim.

==Geography==
The district is located in the northern foothills of the Alps. The Chiemsee is located in the west of the district.

==History==
In 1972 the district was merged with parts of the former district of Laufen, and the previously independent urban district Traunstein.
==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms shows a blue panther to the left, the symbol of the Spanheim dynasty of the Counts of Krainburg-Ortenburg, who owned part of the area in medieval times. The eagle in the top-right derives from the diocese of Chiemsee. At the bottom right there are the Canting Arms of Baumburg Abbey (&quot;Baumburg&quot; translates to &quot;tree-castle&quot;), which ruled most of the northern part of the district.

<text>Skierbieszów is a village in Zamość County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Skierbieszów. It lies on the river Wolica, approximately north-east of Zamość and south-east of the regional capital Lublin. There is a castle in the village.

In 1428 the village was given to the bishop Jan Zborowski of Clan of Ostoja and 1453 the village was given rights by the King as a town. Skierbieszow was a town until 1822 and the coat of arms of the town/village is of Ostoja.

In November 1942 during the Nazi occupation of Poland, the Polish inhabitants of Skierbieszów were expelled to make room for German settlers. Former German President Horst Köhler was born in the village during the occupation. The village was briefly renamed &quot;Heidenstein&quot; until the arrival of Soviet forces in 1944. In 1945-46 the Polish residents began returning to their homes.

<text>Thomas Douglas Selkirk Duff (born December 8, 1952) is a Canadian computer programmer.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Duff was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and was named for his putative ancestor, the fifth Earl of Selkirk. He grew up in Toronto and Leaside. In 1974 he graduated from the University of Waterloo with a B.Math and, two years later, was awarded an M.Sc. from the University of Toronto.

=== Programming career ===
Duff worked at the New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab and the Mark Williams Company in Chicago before moving to Lucasfilm&#x27;s Computer Research and Development Division. He and Thomas Porter, another Lucasfilm employee, developed a new approach to compositing images; their 1984 paper, &quot;Compositing Digital Images&quot;, is &quot;[t]he seminal work on an algebra for image compositing&quot;, according to Keith Packard, and &quot;Porter-Duff compositing&quot; is now a key technique in computer graphics. (See, for example, XRender and Glitz.)

Duff later worked for 12 years at Bell Labs Computing Science Research Center, where he worked on computer graphics, wireless networking, and Plan 9; in the course of his work there, he authored the well known &quot;rc&quot; shell for the Version 10 Unix operating system.

Duff worked at Pixar Animation Studios from 1996 until his retirement in 2021.

== Achievements ==
* In 1995, he was awarded (with others) the Academy Scientific and Engineering Award for his work on digital image compositing. With Bill Reeves he designed the first version of Pixar&#x27;s Marionette 3-D animation system, which won the same award in 1997.
* While working at Lucasfilm, he created Duff&#x27;s device, a loop unrolling mechanism in C.
* On August 22, 2006, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued to Pixar for a &quot;Shot shading method and apparatus&quot; invented by Tom Duff and Robert L. Cook.
*On October 31, 2006, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued to Pixar for a &quot;Shot rendering method and apparatus&quot; invented by Tom Duff and Robert L. Cook.
* In 2015 he became the 21st awardee of the J.W. Graham Medal, named in honor of Wes Graham an early influential Professor of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, and annually awarded to an influential alumnus of the University&#x27;s Faculty of Mathematics.

== In the media ==
* Tom Duff makes a cameo appearance in the Niven/Pournelle science fiction novel &quot;Footfall&quot; as a co-discoverer of the invading spaceship: &quot;Chap named Tom Duff, a computer type, spotted it.&quot;
* Tom Duff appears briefly in the documentary film &quot;Noisy People&quot; (dir Tim Perkis, 2006) playing the banjo.

<doc id="506222" wikidata="Q6530241" url="?curid=506222" title="Lesbian Avengers">
<text>The Lesbian Avengers was an American direct action group. The group was founded in 1992 in New York City by six individuals: Ana Maria Simo, Anne Maguire, Anne-Christine D&#x27;Adesky, Marie Honan, Maxine Wolfe, and Sarah Schulman.

The organization was formed to address lesbian issues and visibility through humorous and untraditional activism. The founding members of the Avengers, who had already been involved with women’s and gay rights activism, expressed frustration with the lack of diversity and the focus on white men in the gay rights movement and decided to create a movement for lesbians.

At the organization’s peak, there were over 60 chapters of the Lesbian Avengers in the United States, including New York, San Francisco, and Denver. Different chapters of the Lesbian Avengers also expanded their missions to focus on issues of race, class, and gender. 

One of their most notable accomplishments was the formation of the annual Dyke March, which began in 1993. Other notable forms of activism included fire-breathing and protests against Proposition 8.

The Lesbian Avengers disbanded in 1997, though some groups continue to hold demonstrations, including the still-ongoing annual Dyke March.

==Origins==
===Founding===
The Lesbian Avengers was founded by six women: Ana Maria Simo, Anne Maguire, Anne-Christine D&#x27;askey, Marie Honan, Maxine Wolfe, and Sarah Schulman. Each of these women had experience in advocating for gay rights and equality under different organizations such as ACT-UP and the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization (ILGO). The co-founders sought to create an inclusive movement that focused on lesbian issues, something they felt was not properly addressed in other organizations.

Their first recruiting flyer, handed out at New York&#x27;s Pride March, invited &quot;LESBIANS! DYKES! GAY WOMEN!&quot; to get involved. &quot;We&#x27;re wasting our lives being careful. Imagine what your life could be. Aren&#x27;t you ready to make it happen?&quot;

The Lesbian Avenger handbook was an important foundation that gave the Avengers their ability to organize meetings, fundraise, and responses to media. The handbook &quot;made it possible for lesbians across the world to start Avenger chapters without having a huge pool of experienced activists.&quot; The handbook played an essential role in the organization and was a tool used by the experienced and newcomers of the group.

===Growth===
The New York chapter started with an estimated 50 members. Eventually new chapters were introduced in multiple locations, over 35 chapters emerged worldwide. A handful chapters were present internationally. The Avengers garnered attention through their use of demonstrations, which were combined with flyers and memorable catchphrases. The Lesbian Avengers designated members to focus on different tasks such as event organizing and designing flyers for events. A notable artist within the group was Carrie Moyer, an American painter who designed some the posters and logos used by the group.

In 1993, the documentary film &quot;The Lesbian Avengers Eat Fire, Too&quot; was released. The film documents the first year of activity within the group and includes interviews with the members of the New York chapter.

==Actions==
The &quot;&quot; encouraged particular attention to the visual elements of the demonstration. &quot;It should let people know clearly and quickly who we are and why we are there. NY Avengers have used a wide range of visuals such as fire eating, a twelve-foot shrine, a huge bomb, a ten-foot plaster statue, flaming torches, etc. The more fabulous, witty, and original, the better.&quot;

Sometimes their positions seem to change, as well. In the early years, the group opposed attempts to legitimize gay marriage, protesting the notion at an Andrew Sullivan book signing in 1995.

The New York Lesbian Avengers also developed a Lesbian Avenger Civil Rights Organizing Project.

===First action: rainbow curriculum===
On their first action (September 9, 1992), the Lesbian Avengers targeted right-wing attempts to suppress a multicultural &quot;Children of the Rainbow&quot; curriculum for elementary schoolchildren. Ostensibly under attack for including lesbians and gay men in its lessons about diversity, some activists like Ana Maria Simo charged that opponents, besides being homophobic, also had a racist agenda in battling the multicultural curriculum.

Meeting in Queens School District 24 where the opposition to the &quot;Rainbow Curriculum&quot; was strongest, they paraded through the neighborhood with an all-lesbian marching band to a local elementary school where they gave out lavender balloons to children and their parents saying &quot;Ask About Lesbian Lives&quot;. They also wore tee-shirts reading, &quot;I was a lesbian child&quot;.

This first action exemplified the Avenger approach.

They also demonstrated without permits, refusing to ask for permission to express themselves. Organizer Kelly Cogswell later elaborated on this principle during the 1994 International Dyke March, &quot;We ask for a permit; they can say no.&quot;

Above all, their choice of action reflected their commitment to challenging homophobic stereotypes. In this case, some members objected to going anywhere near children since lesbians and gay men had so often been portrayed as child molesters. Other members thought that was precisely why their presence was essential. And that was the eventual consensus of the group.

===Role of media: love and hate===
Press played an important role in the Lesbian Avengers. One article characterized them as &quot;a protest outfit formed to attract media attention to lesbian causes.&quot; Besides shaping actions for visual impact, there were committees dedicated to outreach and &quot;propaganda&quot;. The handbook offered a step by step guide on the processes necessary to attract press attention from mainstream and lesbian and gay media, even examples of press releases.

Conflicts over the handling of the press coverage of the Dyke March also occurred within the New York gay and lesbian political community. In an interview, Simo said that a press release sent out by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) after Stonewall 25 initially did not have anything in it about the Dyke March. After the Avengers brought this issue to GLAAD&#x27;s attention, one line was added to the end of the press release about the lack of mainstream press coverage about the Dyke March.

Aware of the power of the press, the Lesbian Avengers sometimes didn&#x27;t court it, but attacked it. They invaded the offices of Self magazine when that publication planned a trip to Colorado despite a lesbian and gay boycott of the state for hate legislation, and in the resulting media coverage were misnamed &quot;The Lesbian Agenda.&quot;

The Avengers also collaborated with Las Buenas Amigas and African Ancestral Lesbians United for Societal Change in a series of actions against homophobic and racist radio programs at La Mega 97.9 in New York, and its parent company, the Spanish Broadcasting System, informing advertisers, staging demonstration, and briefly taking over the radio station and broadcasting their own message.

===Fire-eating===
Use of fire and fire-eating became something of a symbol for the Lesbian Avengers, and spread from the New York group to many others. The first time the Avengers engaged in fire-breathing was on October 30, 1992, in New York. This was done in honor of Hattie Mae Cohens and Brian Mock, to &quot;...transform the image of their deaths by learning to eat fire.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in one of its few articles on the Avengers, explained:

[It] grew out of tragedy. Last year, a lesbian and a gay man, Hattie Mae Cohens and Brian Mock, burned to death in Salem, Ore., after a Molotov cocktail was tossed into the apartment they shared. A month later, on Halloween, at a memorial to the victims in New York City, the Avengers (then newly organized) gave their response to the deaths. They ate fire, chanting, as they still do: &quot;The fire will not consume us. We take it and make it our own.

At the Washington Dyke March held during the anniversary celebrations of the Lesbian and Gay March on Washington in 1993, the Lesbian Avengers ate fire in front of the White House surrounded by a crowd of an estimated 20,000 lesbians.

===The Dyke March===
According to co-founder Sarah Schulman, &quot;It was at the 1993 March on Washington that the Avengers and ACT-UP Women&#x27;s Network created the first Dyke March -- with 20,000 women, marching together with no permit. These participants brought the marches home to their cities and countries and created a new tradition.&quot;

The first Dyke March was initiated by the San Francisco Lesbian Avengers chapter in 1993, it was done during the 1993 March on Washington. Around 20,000 lesbians attended the first march. Eventually, the New York chapter followed and began holding their own Dyke march. The march was held in Washington, the success of the initial march led to marches across other cities such as: New York, West Hollywood, Chicago, and many more locations nationally and internationally. Currently, the marches still exist and are held in June and are done in honor of the Stonewall riots and other notable events in LGBT history.

==Chapters==

=== New York chapter ===
The New York Chapter was the beginning of the Lesbian Avengers. The Avengers in New York worked from 1992 to 1995, their last action involved protesting comments Joseph Bruno made toward the LGBT community. The first official action of the New York Lesbian Avenger Chapter was a protest against right-wing opposition to New York&#x27;s Rainbow Curriculum. The Avengers marched on the first day of classes in opposition to those who refused to implement the curriculum. Many of the actions taken by the New York Chapter were in relation to politicians who made homophobic remarks, actions to increase lesbian visibility, and volunteer work across different organizations.

The New York Chapter partnered with The New York City Anti-Violence Project (AVP) to protest the violence that queer people were faced with during Halloween Celebrations. Additionally, much of the activism the Avengers engaged in addressed the murders of gay people. Their first protest was in regard to the murders of two gay people, Hattie Mae Cohens and Brian Mock. The avengers held a press conference in Manhattan City Hall to bring awareness to the situation.

=== San Francisco chapter ===
The San Francisco Chapter of the Lesbian Avengers was founded in 1993 and actively engaged in different forms of activism until 1997. The San Francisco chapter is responsible for creating the biggest avenger event, The Dyke March. According to Kelly Cogswell, the march mobilized approximately 20,000 lesbians and the success of the event led to the opening of around 60 new chapters.

Another major action the Avengers took was in response to Exodus International and their use of conversion therapy. On February 9, 1995, a group of five avengers entered the headquarters and proceeded to demonstrate against the organization. The Avengers came with posters and began chanting in the building. The Avengers brought 1,000 crickets, which they released into the headquarters, causing alarm among from members of Exodus International.

The issues that this chapter targeted varied. They held protests, brought awareness to the AIDS crisis, and organized events to mobilize lesbians.

=== International chapters ===
The Lesbian Avengers grew outside of the borders within the United States. There were chapters located within different cities in Canada, Europe, and Australia. The most well-known international chapter was located in London, England. Members of the London chapter were also ex members of the group OutRage! Members of the London chapter would focus on different issues, many of their actions aimed to increase lesbian visibility. Members re-created Romeo and Juliet will a full lesbian cast and protested homophobic groups and organizations across London. Despite the presence of international chapters, the documented activities of these chapters are limited.

<text>Vaccines for the New Millennium Act was introduced by Senator John Kerry (D-MA) and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) in the 107th Congress 2001. The bill would have provided tax credits to private sector companies working on vaccines for some of the world&#x27;s most deadly infectious agents. The tax credits took the form of a 30 percent credit on qualified research and development expenditures related to diseases, including HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. This legislation&#x27;s chief Congressional staff assistants were James Matthew Jones for Senator Kerry and Chris Collins for Representative Pelosi. On April 25, 2001, the bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Health, and no further action was taken.

<doc id="506226" wikidata="Q2738248" url="?curid=506226" title="Uganda National Liberation Front">
<text>The Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF) was a political group formed by exiled Ugandans opposed to the rule of military dictator Idi Amin. The UNLF had an accompanying military wing, the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA). UNLA fought alongside Tanzanian forces in the Uganda–Tanzania War that led to the overthrow of Amin&#x27;s regime. The group ruled Uganda from the overthrow of Amin in April 1979 until the disputed national elections in December 1980.

== Creation ==
The UNLF was formed as an outcome of a meeting of Ugandan exiles from 24 to 26 March 1979 in the northern Tanzanian town of Moshi. In the meeting, known as the Moshi Conference, 28 groups were represented. The most important groups that united to form UNLA included Kikosi Maalum led by Milton Obote (with Tito Okello and David Oyite Ojok as commanders); FRONASA led by Yoweri Museveni; and the Save Uganda Movement.

== Governance ==
The UNLF was governed by an 11-member Executive Council originally chaired by Yusuf Lule who was the Uganda President at that time, with the vice-chairman being Akena P&#x27; Ojok, who was Uganda&#x27;s then vice president. The UNLF was accompanied by a National Consultative Council (NCC) with one member for each of the 28 groups represented at the meeting. Its military arm, UNLA, fought side by side with the Tanzania People&#x27;s Defence Force (TPDF) in the Uganda-Tanzania War and invaded Uganda, taking Kampala in April 1979 and sending Amin to exile. There were other party members of UNLF across the country and in the regions formed to coordinate the activities of UNLF.

== Overthrowing of Idi Amin ==
Following the overthrow of Amin on 11 April 1979, a new UNLF government was formed under Yusuf Lule with the UNLA becoming the new national army. The leadership of the UNLF was unstable, with infighting leading to the ousting of Lule in June 1979. His replacement, Godfrey Binaisa, ruled for less than twelve months before being placed under house arrest in May 1980 following an effective coup by Paulo Muwanga. A Presidential Commission was installed with elections planned for December 1980. The exiles who formed the UNLF needed to put aside their political differences to do so. They were only united by one thing: an opposition to Amin. For this reason, the UNLF did not contest the elections with its members supporting various parties.

Following a widely disputed victory for the Uganda People&#x27;s Congress (UPC) led by former president Milton Obote, many of the UNLF founding members would go on to fight against the now UPC-controlled UNLA. The UNLA was defeated on January 25, 1986 by the guerrillas of the National Resistance Army (NRA) led by Yoweri Museveni, a former member of the UNLF executive council and a minister in the UNLF government. There was a tribal conflict between the Acholi and Langi, that led to the coup d&#x27;état making Tito Okello Lutwa president of the republic.

<text>The woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) is an extinct species of rhinoceros that inhabited northern Eurasia during the Pleistocene epoch. The woolly rhinoceros was a member of the Pleistocene megafauna. The woolly rhinoceros was large, comparable in size to the largest living rhinoceros species, the white rhinoceros (&quot;Ceratotherium simum&quot;), and covered with long, thick hair that allowed it to survive in the extremely cold, harsh mammoth steppe. It had a massive hump reaching from its shoulder and fed mainly on herbaceous plants that grew in the steppe. Mummified carcasses preserved in permafrost and many bone remains of woolly rhinoceroses have been found. Images of woolly rhinoceroses are found among cave paintings in Europe and Asia, and evidence has been found suggesting that the species was hunted by humans. The range of the woolly rhinoceros contracted towards Siberia beginning around 17,000 years ago, with the youngest known records being around 14,000 years old in northeast Siberia, coinciding with the Bølling–Allerød warming, which likely disrupted its habitat, with environmental DNA records possibly extending the range of the species around 9,800 years ago. Its closest living relative is the Sumatran rhinoceros (&quot;Dicerorhinus sumatrensis&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
Woolly rhinoceros remains have been known long before the species was described and were the basis for some mythical creatures. Native peoples of Siberia believed their horns were the claws of giant birds. A rhinoceros skull was found in Klagenfurt, Austria, in 1335, and was believed to be that of a dragon. In 1590, it was used as the basis for the head on a statue of a lindworm. Gotthilf Heinrich von Schubert maintained the belief that the horns were the claws of giant birds, and classified the animal under the name &quot;Gryphus antiquitatis&quot;, meaning &quot;griffin of antiquity&quot;.

One of the earliest scientific descriptions of an ancient rhinoceros species was made in 1769, when the naturalist Peter Simon Pallas wrote a report on his expeditions to Siberia where he found a skull and two horns in the permafrost. In 1772, Pallas acquired a head and two legs of a rhinoceros from the locals in Irkutsk, and named the species &quot;Rhinoceros lenenesis&quot; (after the Lena River). In 1799, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach studied rhinoceros bones from the collection of the University of Göttingen, and proposed the scientific name &quot;Rhinoceros antiquitatis&quot;. The geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn moved the species to &quot;Coelodonta&quot; in 1831 because of its differences in dental formation with members of the &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; genus. This name comes from the Greek words κοιλος (&quot;koilos&quot;, &quot;hollow&quot;) and ὀδούς (&quot;odoús&quot; &quot;tooth&quot;), from the depression in the rhino&#x27;s molar structure, giving the scientific name &quot;Coelodonta antiquitatis&quot;, &quot;hollow-tooth of antiquity&quot;.

===Evolution===
The woolly rhinoceros was the most recent species of the genus &quot;Coelodonta&quot;. The closest living relative of &quot;Coelodonta&quot; is the Sumatran rhinoceros, and the genus is also closely related to the extinct genus &quot;Stephanorhinus&quot;. A cladogram showing the relationships of &quot;C. antiquitatis&quot; to other Late Pleistocene-recent rhinoceros species based on genomic data is given below.

Relationships of the woolly rhinoceros based on morphology, excluding African rhinoceros species:The ancestors of &quot;Coelodonta&quot; are suggested to have diverged from those of the Sumatran rhinoceros around 9.4 million years ago, with &quot;Coelodonta&quot; diverging from &quot;Stephanorhinus&quot; around 5.5 million years ago. The oldest known species of &quot;Coelodonta, Coelodonta thibetana&quot; is known from the Pliocene of Tibet dating to approximately 3.7 million years ago, with the genus being present in Siberia, Mongolia, and China during the Early Pleistocene. The woolly rhinoceros first appeared during the early Middle Pleistocene in China, and the oldest remains of the species in Europe, which represents the only species of &quot;Coelodonta&quot; to have been present in the region, date to approximately 450,000 years ago. The woolly rhinoceros is divided into two chrono-subspecies, with &quot;C. a. praecursor&quot; from the middle Pleistocene and &quot;C. a. antiquitatis&quot; from the late Pleistocene. Mitochondrial genomes suggest that the last mitochondrial ancestor of Late Pleistocene woolly rhinoceroses lived around 570,000 years ago.

==Description==
===Structure and appearance===

An adult woolly rhinoceros typically measured from head to tail, stood tall at the shoulder, and weighed up to (with some sources placing the body mass of the species as high as ) making it comparable in size to the largest living rhinoceros species, the white rhinoceros (&quot;Ceratotherium simum&quot;). Both males and females had two horns which were made of keratin, with one long horn reaching forward and a smaller horn between the eyes. The front horn would have measured long for individuals at 25 to 35 years of age, while the second horn would have measured up to long. Unlike in modern rhinos, the large nasal horn was often flattened in cross-section, and abrasion patterns on the horn indicate its possible use in brushing away snow when grazing. Compared to other rhinoceroses, the woolly rhinoceros had a longer head and body, and shorter legs. Its shoulder was raised with a powerful hump, used to support the animal&#x27;s massive front horn. The hump also contained a fat reserve to aid survival through the desolate winters of the mammoth steppe.

Frozen specimens indicate that the rhino&#x27;s long fur coat was reddish-brown, with a thick undercoat that lay under a layer of long, coarse guard hair thickest on the withers and neck. Shorter hair covered the limbs, keeping snow from attaching. The body&#x27;s length ended with a tail with a brush of coarse hair at the end. Females had two nipples on the udders.

The woolly rhinoceros had several features which reduced the body&#x27;s surface area and minimized heat loss. Its ears were no longer than , while those of rhinos in hot climates are about . Their tails were also relatively shorter. It also had thick skin, ranging from , heaviest on the chest and shoulders.

===Skull and dentition===

The skull had a length between . It was longer than those of other rhinoceros, giving the head a deep, downward-facing slanting position, similar to its fossil relative &quot;Stephanorhinus hemitoechus&quot; and &quot;Elasmotherium&quot; as well as the white rhinoceros. Strong muscles on its long occipital bone formed its neck hock and held the massive skull. Its massive lower jaw measured up to long and high. The teeth of the woolly rhinoceros had thickened enamel and an open internal cavity. Like other rhinos, adults did not have incisors. It had 3 premolars and 3 molars in both jaws. The molars were high-crowned and had a thick coat of cementum.

The nasal septum of the woolly rhinoceros was ossified, unlike modern rhinos. This was most common in adult males. This adaptation probably evolved as a result of the heavy pressure on the horn and face when the rhinoceros grazed underneath the thick snow. Unique to this rhino, the nasal bones were fused to the premaxillae, which is not the case in older &quot;Coelodonta&quot; types or today&#x27;s rhinoceroses. This ossification inspired the junior synonym specific name &quot;tichorhinus&quot;, from Greek τειχος (teikhos) &quot;wall&quot;, ῥις (ῥιν-) (rhis (rhin-)) &quot;nose&quot;.

==Paleobiology and palaeoecology==

The woolly rhinoceros had a similar life history to modern rhinos. Studies on milk teeth show that individuals developed similarly to both the white and black rhinoceros. The two teats in the female suggest that she raised one calf, or more rarely two, every two to three years.

With their massive horns and size, adults had few predators, but young individuals could have been attacked by cave hyenas and cave lions. A skull was found with trauma indicating an attack from a feline, but the animal survived to adulthood. Remains of woolly rhinoceros are frequently found in cave hyena dens with gnaw marks indicating that their remains were consumed by them, which to a large degree likely reflects scavenging of the carcasses of already dead rhinoceroses.

Woolly rhinos may have used their horns for combat, probably including intraspecific combat as recorded in cave paintings, as well as for moving snow to uncover vegetation during winter. They may have also been used to attract mates. Bull woolly rhinos were probably territorial like their modern counterparts, defending themselves from competitors, particularly during the rutting season. Fossil skulls indicate damage from the front horns of other rhinos,  and lower jaws and back ribs show signs of being broken and re-formed, which may have also come from fighting. The apparent frequency of intraspecific combat, compared to recent rhinos, was likely a result of rapid climatic change during the last glacial period, when the animal faced increased stress from competition with other large herbivores.

===Diet===
Woolly rhinoceroses mostly fed on grasses and sedges that grew in the mammoth steppe. Its long, slanted head with a downward-facing posture, and tooth structure all helped it graze on vegetation. It had a wide upper lip like that of the white rhinoceros, which allowed it to easily pluck vegetation directly from the ground. A strain vector biomechanical investigation of the skull, mandible and teeth of a well-preserved last cold stage individual recovered from Whitemoor Haye, Staffordshire, revealed musculature and dental characteristics that support a grazing feeding preference. In particular, the enlargement of the temporalis and neck muscles is consistent with that required to resist the large tugging forces generated when taking large mouthfuls of fodder from the ground. The presence of a large diastema supports this theory. Comparisons with living perissodactyls confirm that the woolly rhinoceros was a hindgut fermentor with a single stomach, consuming cellulose-rich, protein-poor fodder. It had to consume a heavy amount of food to account for the low nutritive content of its diet. Woolly rhinos living in the Arctic during the Last Glacial Maximum consumed approximately equal volumes of forbs, such as &quot;Artemisia&quot;, and graminoids. Pollen analysis shows it also ate woody plants (including conifers, willows and alders), along with flowers, forbs and mosses. Isotope studies on horns show that the woolly rhinoceros had a seasonal diet; different areas of horn growth suggest that it mainly grazed in summer, while it browsed for shrubs and branches in the winter. Dental mesowear measurements further show that the woolly rhinoceros&#x27;s diet was heavily composed on abrasive grasses.

===Growth and pathologies===
It is estimated that woolly rhinoceroses could reach around 40 years of age, like their modern relatives. In 2014, Shpansky analysed the growth of woolly rhinoceros from its early life stages based on several lower jaw fragments and limb bones. A one-month-old calf was about in length and tall at the shoulder. The most intensive growth in woolly rhinos occurred during the juvenile stage around 3 to 4 years of age with a shoulder height of . At 7 to 10 years of age, woolly rhinos became young adults with a shoulder height of . By more than 14 years of age, woolly rhinos became fully mature, old adults with a shoulder height of .

&quot;C. antiquitatis&quot; individuals of old age display extensive wear and loss of their anterior premolars as a result of tooth abrasion from their intensive grazing lifestyle.

===Habitat and distribution===

The woolly rhinoceros lived mainly in lowlands, plateaus and river valleys, with dry to arid climates, and migrated to higher elevations in favourable climate phases. It avoided mountain ranges, due to heavy snow and steep terrain that the animal could not easily cross. The rhino&#x27;s main habitat was the mammoth steppe, a large, open landscape covered with wide ranges of grass and bushes. The woolly rhinoceros lived alongside other large herbivores, such as the woolly mammoth, giant deer, reindeer, saiga antelope and bison – an assortment of animals known as the &quot;Mammuthus&quot;-&quot;Coelodonta&quot; Faunal Complex. With its wide distribution, the woolly rhinoceros lived in some areas alongside the other rhinoceroses &quot;Stephanorhinus&quot; and &quot;Elasmotherium&quot;.

By the end of the Riss glaciation about 130,000 years ago, the woolly rhinoceros lived throughout northern Eurasia, spanning most of Europe, the Russian Plain, Siberia, and the Mongolian Plateau, ranging to extremes of 72° to 33°N. Fossils have been found as far north as the New Siberian Islands. Even during the very warm Eemian interglacial, the range of the woolly rhinoceros extended into temperate regions such as Poland. It had the widest range of any rhinoceros species.

It seemingly did not cross the Bering land bridge during the last ice age (which connected Asia to North America), with its easterly-most occurrence at the Chukotka Peninsula, probably due to the low grass density and lack of suitable habitat in the Yukon combined with competition from other large herbivores on the frigid land bridge.

==Relationship with humans==
===Hunting===
Woolly rhinoceroses shared their habitat with humans, but direct evidence that they interacted is relatively rare. Only 11% of the known sites of prehistoric Siberian tribes have remains or images of the animal. Many rhinoceros remains are found in caves (such as the Kůlna Cave in Central Europe), which were not the natural habitat of either rhinos or humans, and large predators such as hyenas may have carried rhinoceros parts there. Sometimes, only individual teeth or bone fragments are uncovered, which usually came from only one animal. Most rhinoceros remains in Western Europe are found in the same places where human remains or artifacts were found, but this may have occurred naturally.

Signs that early humans hunted or scavenged the rhinoceros come from markings on the animal&#x27;s bones. One specimen had injuries caused by human weaponry, with traces of a wound from a sharp object marking the shoulder and thigh, and a preserved spear was found near the carcass. A few sites from the early phase of the Last Glacial Period in the late Middle Paleolithic, such as the Gudenus Cave (Austria) and the open air site of Königsaue (Saxony-Anhalt, Germany), have heavily beaten rhinoceros bones lined with slash marks. This action was done partly to extract the nutritious bone marrow.

Both horns and bones of the rhinoceros were used as raw materials for tools and weapons, as were remains from other animals. In what is now Zwoleń, Poland, a device was made from a battered woolly rhinoceros pelvis. Half-meter spear throwers, made from a woolly rhinoceros horn about 27,000 years ago, came from the Yana Rhinoceros Horn Site on the banks of the Yana River. A 13,300-year-old spear found on Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island has a tip made of rhinoceros horn, the furthest north a human artifact has ever been found.

The Pinhole Cave Man is a late Paleolithic figure of a man engraved on a rib bone of a woolly rhinoceros, found at Creswell Crags in England.

===Ancient art===

Many cave paintings from the Upper Paleolithic depict woolly rhinoceroses. The animal&#x27;s defining features are prominently drawn, complete with the raised back and hump, contrasting with its low-lying head. Two curved lines represent the ears. The animal&#x27;s horns are drawn with their long curvature, and in some cases, the coat is also indicated. Many paintings show a black band dividing the body.

About 20 Paleolithic drawings of woolly rhinos were known before the discovery of the Chauvet Cave in France. They are dated at over 31,000 years old, probably from the Aurignacian, engraved on cave walls or drawn in red or black. One scene depicts two rhinos fighting each other with their horns. Other illustrations are found in the Rouffignac and Lascaux caves. One drawing from Font-de-Gaume shows a noticeably higher head posture, and others were drawn in red pigments in the Kapova Cave in the Ural Mountains. Some images show rhinoceroses struck with spears or arrows, signifying human hunting.

The site of Dolní Věstonice in Moravia, Czech Republic, was found with more than seven hundred statuettes of animals, many of woolly rhinoceroses.

==Extinction==
Analysis of the nuclear genome suggests that the woolly rhinoceros experienced a population expansion beginning around 30,000 years ago. The end of the last glacial period shows a progressive contraction of the range of the woolly rhinoceros, with the species disappearing from Europe during the interval between 17 and 15,000 years ago, with its youngest confirmed records being from the Urals, dating to 14,200 years ago, and northeast Siberia, dating to around 14,000 years ago. The youngest records of the species coincide with the onset of the Bølling–Allerød warming, which likely resulted in increased precipitation (including snowfall), which transformed the woolly rhinoceros&#x27; preferred low-growing grass and herb habitat into one dominated by shrubs and trees. The woolly rhinoceros was likely intolerant of deep snow, which its short limbs were inefficient in moving through. Population fragmentation is likely to have played a role in its extinction. The presence of large numbers of cervical ribs in specimens from the Netherlands may have been due to inbreeding or harsh environmental conditions. A genetic study of the woolly rhinoceros remains in northeast Siberia, dating to around 18,500 years ago, a few thousand years before its extinction, found that the population size was stable and relatively large, despite long-term co-existence with humans in the region. A Holocene survival of the species has been suggested by the finding of environmental DNA of the woolly rhinoceros in sediments of the Kolyma region of Northeast Siberia dating to 9,800 ± 200 years ago. However, it has been demonstrated that ancient DNA in permafrost can be reworked into sediment layers dating to well after the extinction of the originating species, though other authors have argued that this specific environmental DNA record is unlikely to have been reworked. Low level human hunting may have played a decisive role in the extinction by reducing the ability of woolly rhinoceros populations to colonise newly suitable habitat, thereby exacerbating the population fragmentation brought on by environmental change.

== Frozen specimens ==
Many rhinoceros remains have been found preserved in the permafrost region. In 1771, a head, two legs and hide were found in the Vilyuy River in eastern Siberia and sent to the Kunstkamera in Saint Petersburg. Later in 1877, a Siberian trader recovered a head and one leg from a tributary of the Yana River.

In October 1907, miners in Starunia, Russian Empire, found a mammoth carcass buried in an ozokerite pit. A month later, a rhinoceros was found underneath. Both were sent to the Dzieduszycki Museum, where a detailed description was published in the museum&#x27;s monograph. Photographs were published in paleontological journals and textbooks, and the first modern paintings of the species were based on the mounted specimen. The rhino is now located in the Lviv National Museum along with the mammoth. Later, in 1929, the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences sent an expedition to Starunia, finding the mummified remains of three rhinos. One specimen, missing only its horns and fur, was taken to the Aquarium and Natural History Museum in Kraków. A plaster cast was made soon afterwards, which is now held in the Natural History Museum in London.

Skull and rib fragments of a rhinoceros were found in 1972 in Churapcha, between the Lena and Amga rivers. A whole skeleton was found soon afterwards, with preserved skin, fur, and stomach contents. In 1976, schoolchildren on a class trip found a 20,000-year-old rhinoceros skeleton on the Aldan River&#x27;s left bank, uncovering a skull with both horns, a spine, ribs and limb bones.

In 2007, a partial rhinoceros carcass was found in the lower reaches of the Kolyma river. Its upward-facing position indicates that the animal probably fell into mud and sank. Next year in 2008, a nearly complete skeleton came from the Chukochya River. That same year, locals near the Amga discovered mummified rhinoceros remains, and over the next two years, pelvic bones, tail vertebrae and ribs were excavated along with forelimbs and hind limbs with toes intact.

In September 2014, a mummified young rhinoceros was discovered by two hunters, Alexander “Sasha” Banderov and Simeon Ivanov, at a tributary of the Semyulyakh River in the Abyysky District in Yakutia, Russia. Its head and horns, fur, and soft tissues were recovered. Some parts had been thawed and eaten since they were not covered by permafrost. The body was handed over to the Yakutia Academy of Sciences, where it was named “Sasha” after one of its discoverers. Dental analysis shows that the calf was about seven months old at the time of its death. With its well-intact preservation, scientists proceeded to undergo DNA analysis.

In August 2020, a rhinoceros was found, after being revealed by melting permafrost, close to the site of the 2014 discovery. The rhino was between three and four years old and it is thought that the cause of death was drowning. It is one of the best-preserved animals recovered from the region, having most of its internal organs intact. The discovery was also notable for the preservation of a small nasal horn, a rarity as these normally decompose quickly.

<text>The Gambier Parry process is a development of the classical technique of fresco for painting murals, named for Thomas Gambier Parry.

True fresco is the technique of painting on fresh lime plaster whereby the pigments are fixed by the carbonatation of the lime (calcium hydroxide). The technique requires no other binding medium and the fixing process produces a durable crystalline paint layer. However, only a limited range of pigments are suitable for true frescoes and the technique requires careful application under controlled conditions, and relatively low humidity thereafter. In some environments, conventional fresco colours can rapidly accumulate dirt and grime. The decoration of the new Houses of Parliament in the mid-nineteenth century saw an embarrassing failure of true fresco in England but had generated a revival in mural painting. 

Gambier Parry developed a spirit medium for use on a specially prepared plaster or canvas ground and in 1862 he published his recipe. Originally it used beeswax, oil of spike lavender, spirits of turpentine, elemi resin and copal varnish, and was complex both in preparing the wall surface and applying the paint. With commercialisation the process was simplified and became widely known.

The system was used by Frederic Leighton for &quot;The Arts of Industry as Applied to War&quot; and &quot;The Arts of Industry as Applied to Peace&quot; at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (1870-72) and by Ford Madox Brown on the &quot;Manchester Murals&quot; in Manchester Town Hall (1879-93). One of the most complete examples of the Gambier Parry process may be seen at St Leonard&#x27;s Church, Newland, Worcestershire where frescoes cover the interior of the church; St Leonard&#x27;s is the private chapel of the Beauchamp Almshouses.

<text>General elections were held in Sweden on 15 September 2002, alongside municipal and county council elections. The Swedish Social Democratic Party remained the largest party in the Riksdag, winning 144 of the 349 seats.

After securing a confidence and supply agreement with the Left Party and the Green Party, Prime Minister Göran Persson was able to remain in his position for a third consecutive term as a minority government.

Although the bloc compositions were similar to 1998, the complexions of the centre-right bloc shifted radically. Under new party leader Bo Lundgren, the Moderates lost more than seven percentage points and barely held on as the largest party in its coalition. Only eight municipalities in all of Sweden had the Moderates as the largest party, six of which were in the Stockholm area. The Peoples&#x27; Party led by Lars Leijonborg, instead more than doubled its parliamentary delegation and received above 13% of the vote. Lundgren resigned in the wake of the election, leading to the selection of future Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt as the Moderate leader.

Among the four other Riksdag parties, the Christian Democrats and the Left Party both lost ground, whereas the Centre and Green parties managed to reach the parliamentary threshold of four percentage points.

Among minor parties, the Norrbotten Party reached 9.4% of the vote in its county, polling above 20% in some inland areas. However, this was not enough to gain a Riksdag seat. The Sweden Democrats became the eight largest party for the first time, making sizeable gains and winning more council seats than ever before.

<text>General elections were held in Sweden on 20 September 1998. The Swedish Social Democratic Party remained the largest party in the Riksdag, winning 131 of the 349 seats.

The incumbent Social Democratic minority government, led by Göran Persson, was returned to power despite losing seats and receiving fewer votes than in their 1991 defeat. They remained in power with support from the Left Party and the Green Party. While the three left-wing parties saw a net loss of 11 seats, the Left Party nearly doubled its representation in the Riksdag. This reflected how many Social Democratic voters were dissatisfied with the policies of the government, which had implemented austerity measures to reduce the budget deficit.

The Social Democrats were able to form a government in spite of the sizeable decline of the vote, since the centre-right parties failed to recover more than a net share of 11 seats out of the required 27. The most notable gain was that the capital Stockholm going blue in spite of a stable nationwide left-leaning majority, something that previously had been unlikely. In suburban areas around the two largest cities several municipalities also flipped blue. Other gains were in the blue heartlands of Southern Sweden, with Jönköping and Linköping being major pickups. Even so, 23 out of 29 constituencies voted for the leftist parties. Gothenburg remained in the red column in spite of a large net swing towards the opposition.

Even so, smaller municipalities away from the bigger cities gave the red-green bloc a sizeable edge, with the Left Party getting into double-digits nationwide. Even though there was a drop of support in major cities, many areas that had previously voted blue remained with the red-green bloc. For the Social Democrats, the steep drop of the party&#x27;s nationwide vote share was still felt in many of its historically strong industrial areas. The party&#x27;s vote share had dropped to a 70-year low and many absolute majorities from 1994 election were lost.

Besides from the Left Party, the other party that made major gains were the Christian Democrats. The party had been on the verge of falling out of the Riksdag in 1994, yet almost tripled its vote share to end up at 11.8%, even being the largest centre-right party in its stronghold of Jönköping County. The former heads of government, the Centre Party, continued its decline and recorded 5.1% of the vote, more than a million fewer overall votes than in the 1970s elections. The People&#x27;s Party fared even worse at 4.7%.

==Results==

There were 5,261,109 valid ballots cast, a sizeable decrease in turnout from the 1994 election, with turnout dropping from 86.8% to 81.4%.

<text>Kevin &quot;Al&quot; Archer (born 21 December 1958) is an English guitarist and songwriter.

==Career==
Archer played with Kevin Rowland in the punk rock group the Killjoys. In 1978, Rowland and Archer formed Dexys Midnight Runners. Archer co-wrote some of the songs on the group&#x27;s debut album &quot;Searching for the Young Soul Rebels&quot;. 

He used the name &quot;Al&quot; because Kevin Rowland decided that the group was not big enough to accommodate two Kevins. After the first album, Archer, exhausted by Dexys&#x27; touring schedule, left the group in early 1981. In a 2009 interview, with Joanne Malin on her BBC Radio WM morning show, Archer said he enjoyed the musical side of the group, but did not enjoy the culture of the band under Rowland&#x27;s direction. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Too-Rye-Ay&quot; (1982), featured his significant influence on the hit single &quot;Come On Eileen&quot;, though Rowland did not acknowledge this until years later.

He then formed the Blue Ox Babes. The band finally signed to Go! Discs Records for three singles and an aborted album, &quot;Apples &amp; Oranges&quot;, which belatedly saw release in 200920 years after it was recorded.

<text>Patrick Hepburn, 3rd Earl of Bothwell (1512 – September 1556) was the son of Adam Hepburn, Lord Hailes, who died at the Battle of Flodden the year after Patrick&#x27;s birth.

Hepburn was known as the &quot;Fair Earl&quot;. He owed this more to his looks than his character, being described as &quot;fair and white&quot; while a young boy.

He was imprisoned in 1529 for two years for harbouring robbers. Once released he decided to exact revenge by beginning a treasonable correspondence with England. He then spent much of the next years in England, and after James V died following the Battle of Solway Moss, Hepburn signed a pact with Henry VIII promising to serve him and aid the commitment of the then infant Mary, Queen of Scots, into Henry&#x27;s custody.

Despite having sworn loyalty to Henry VIII, Hepburn was awarded an annual pension of £1,000 from Mary of Guise (Mary, Queen of Scots&#x27; mother) in return for his patriotic fidelity. It was said that Hepburn believed there was the possibility of marrying into royalty and that was his reason for divorcing his wife. However, the prospects for royal marriage were thin and despite Henry VIII engaging in another bloody invasion of Scotland, Hepburn resumed correspondence with the English Court. In the intervening years, Hepburn apprehended George Wishart in January 1546, who was put on trial for heresy and executed at St Andrews on 1 March 1546.

In 1548, Hepburn renounced his loyalty to the Scottish crown, and became a pensioner of England, earning £3,000 annually. He went into England in July 1549, staying two nights at Naworth Castle. However, in 1554 he returned to Scotland after his formal pardon by Mary of Guise. He died at Dumfries.

The Earl of Bothwell married in 1534 Agnes (d. 1572), daughter of Henry Sinclair, 4th Lord Sinclair (who also fell at Flodden). They were divorced before 16 October 1543, whereafter she was styled Lady Morham until her death. They had three children:
*James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, his son and heir, who eventually became the third and last husband of Mary, Queen of Scots.
* Jean (Janet) Hepburn (d. before 27 July 1599) whose first husband was John Sinclair, Master of Caithness (d.1578, v.p.), with issue; her second husband was John Stewart, Commendator of Coldingham, by whom she had Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell; her third husband the notorious Archibald Douglas, Parson of Douglas, a Senator of the College of Justice, and brother of William Douglas of Whittinghame.

<doc id="506254" wikidata="Q319603" url="?curid=506254" title="George Gaylord Simpson">
<text>George Gaylord Simpson (June 16, 1902 – October 6, 1984) was an American paleontologist. Simpson was perhaps the most influential paleontologist of the twentieth century, and a major participant in the modern synthesis, contributing &quot;Tempo and Mode in Evolution&quot; (1944), &quot;The Meaning of Evolution&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Major Features of Evolution&quot; (1953). He was an expert on extinct mammals and their intercontinental migrations. Simpson was extraordinarily knowledgeable about Mesozoic fossil mammals and fossil mammals of North and South America. He anticipated such concepts as punctuated equilibrium (in &quot;Tempo and Mode&quot;) and dispelled the myth that the evolution of the horse was a linear process culminating in the modern &quot;Equus caballus&quot;. He coined the word &quot;&quot; in 1940, and published extensively on the taxonomy of fossil and extant mammals. Simpson was influentially, and incorrectly, opposed to Alfred Wegener&#x27;s theory of continental drift, but accepted the theory of plate tectonics (and continental drift) when the evidence became conclusive.

He was Professor of Zoology at Columbia University, and Curator of the Department of Geology and Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History from 1945 to 1959. He was Curator of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University from 1959 to 1970, and a Professor of Geosciences at the University of Arizona from 1968 until his retirement in 1982.

==Awards and honors==
Simpson was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1936 and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1941. In 1943 Simpson was awarded the Mary Clark Thompson Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. For his work, &quot;Tempo and mode in evolution&quot;, he was awarded the academy&#x27;s Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal in 1944. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1948. He was awarded the Linnean Society of London&#x27;s prestigious Darwin-Wallace Medal in 1958. Simpson also received the Royal Society&#x27;s Darwin Medal &#x27;In recognition of his distinguished contributions to general evolutionary theory, based on a profound study of palaeontology, particularly of vertebrates,&#x27; in 1962. In 1966, Simpson received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

At the University of Arizona, Tucson, the Gould-Simpson Building was named in honor of Simpson and Minnesota geologist and polar explorer Lawrence M. Gould, who, like Simpson, also accepted an appointment as Professor of Geosciences at the University of Arizona after his formal retirement. Simpson was noted for his work in the fields of paleobiogeography and animal evolution.

==Views==
In the 1960s, Simpson &quot;rubbished the then-nascent science of exobiology, which concerned
itself with life on places other than Earth, as a science without a subject&quot;.

He was raised as a Christian but in his early teens became an agnostic, nontheist, and philosophical naturalist.

<text>Eva Ulrika Jonsson (born 16 August 1967) is a Swedish-British television presenter and model. She became known as a TV-am weather presenter, and moved on to present the ITV show &quot;Gladiators&quot;, and later featured as a team captain on the BBC Two show &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;.

==Career==
After working as a secretary, Jonsson began her television career on TV-am in 1989, as a weather presenter on &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;. From 12 September 1989, she was also the weather presenter for Swedish TV3, broadcasting from London. In 1991, she co-presented BBC One&#x27;s short-lived daytime quiz show &quot;Who&#x27;s Bluffing Who?&quot; with Richard Cartridge, and starred in the French film, &quot;The Annunciation of Marie&quot; (1991).

In 1992, she moved into mainstream presenting and played host to numerous shows including ITV&#x27;s &quot;Gladiators&quot;, &quot;The National Lottery Draws&quot; – plus two major international broadcasts, the Eurovision Song Contest in 1998 and Miss World in 1999. She also modelled for Playtex Lingerie during this period and was a team captain on the BBC TV quiz show &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;. On the strength of her appearances in &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;, Jonsson starred in a BBC TV special of her own in 1997. Entitled &quot;It&#x27;s Ulrika!&quot;, the show featured Jonsson singing and acting in comedy sketches written specially for her by &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; hosts Vic Reeves (under his real name of Jim Moir) and Bob Mortimer, who both appeared in various supporting roles. The show was intended to act as a pilot for a possible future series, but ratings were only moderate and the show was not picked up for a series.

In 1997, Jonsson interviewed the then British Prime Minister John Major for the BBC2 programme &quot;The Enormous Election&quot;. In 1998, she interviewed the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, for her programme &quot;Ulrika in Euroland&quot;.

She presented &quot;Eurovision Song Contest&quot; in 1998 when it was hosted in Birmingham, alongside Sir Terry Wogan; later that year she co-hosted the Royal Variety Performance alongside Ronan Keating at the Lyceum Theatre in London. Following this, she co-hosted Miss World 1999 with Melanie Sykes at the Olympia Hall in London. Jonsson was booked to host Channel 5&#x27;s reality game show &quot;Jailbreak&quot; in Autumn 2000 but had to pull out of the project due to health concerns over her newborn child. She was replaced as main host by Craig Charles. Jonsson later presented BBC One game show &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;, broadcast from April 2001 to November 2002, and &quot;The Joy of Text&quot; in June 2001 alongside Terry Alderton.

In 2002, Jonsson presented the first series of ITV makeover show &quot;Home On Their Own&quot;, a show where children made alterations to their house (how they wanted the house to be) during the course of a weekend, while their parents went on holiday. Some of the home improvements included an Austin Powers room, individual doorbells for the children and a cinema living room. Jonsson did not return for the second series, which was hosted by Tess Daly the following year.

In 2002, she was the subject of a Channel 4 documentary, &quot;Ulrika Jonsson: the Truth About Men&quot;. The programme featured a candid interview with Jonsson, received heavy press attention and attracted 2.8 million viewers.

After intense media attention relating to events in her private life, Jonsson decided to return to Sweden. The Swedish television network TV3 offered her the role as hostess of the Miss Sweden beauty pageant. She accepted the invitation. In March 2003, Jonsson was a contestant on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Comic Relief Does Fame Academy&quot;. In 2005, she appeared with four celebrities on Channel 4&#x27;s daytime show &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot;. On 20 January 2007, she joined 10 celebrities to take part in the ITV reality TV show &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, where she was partnered with Pavel Aubrecht. With previous skating experience in her native Sweden, Jonsson was expected to go far in the event but finished 9th after being beaten in the skate-off by Kay Burley during week 3.

On 20 March 2007, she appeared in the confessional TV show, &quot;Ulrika: Am I a Sex Addict?&quot;, broadcast on Channel 4. The show charted Jonsson&#x27;s personal journey to uncover the truth about sex addiction. She has appeared on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot; (2007). In March 2009, she appeared in the new ITV series &quot;Piers Morgan&#x27;s Life Stories&quot;, each episode of which included a celebrity figure and a one-to-one interview with Morgan about their lives.

In April 2009, it was confirmed that Jonsson would return to &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; as team captain for a full series airing later that year. She presented the new series of &quot;BingoLotto&quot;, on Virgin 1 every Sunday night at 7 pm which started on 13 September 2009.

Her debut novel, &quot;The Importance of Being Myrtle&quot;, which focuses on relationships was published by the Penguin Group on 1 September 2011.

In 2017, she reached the final of &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot;.

In 2021, she took part in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins&quot;. She was the second contestant to leave the series but on medical grounds not as the weakest participant.

On 27 October 2021, Channel 4 announced Jonsson would be taking part in the tenth series of &quot;Celebs Go Dating&quot;, alongside Abz Love, Ryan-Mark Parsons, Miles Nazaire, Chloe Brockett, Nikita Jasmine, Marty McKenna and Jessika Power. The series began airing in January 2022.

===&quot;Big Brother&quot;===
In January 2009, Jonsson took part in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;. She eventually won with 57% of the final vote during the final on 23 January. As results were announced to the contestants, Jonsson said &quot;Oh my god, that&#x27;s bonkers.&quot;

She had been nominated by housemates for eviction on each occasion, firstly by &#x27;head of house&#x27; Terry Christian and then by other housemates, but survived the public vote on five occasions. Jonsson eventually progressed to the finals night, as the only woman left, after La Toya Jackson was evicted by public vote on Day 20. Before her entry into the house, various newspapers had reported that Jonsson had negotiated a £175,000 payment, nearly eight times as much as some of the other celebrities. Jonsson commented &quot;It is singularly the weirdest experience of my entire life and I&#x27;ve had quite a weird life.&quot;

Jonsson once again entered the Big Brother house on 24 August 2010 for &quot;Ultimate Big Brother&quot;, reaching the final and finishing seventh.

==Autobiography and John Leslie scandal==
Jonsson wrote in her autobiography that an unnamed television presenter had raped her earlier in her television career. Matthew Wright named (apparently accidentally) John Leslie as the alleged perpetrator on his television show &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot;. Jonsson made no public comment on Leslie&#x27;s naming and did not cooperate with police over the matter. Police investigated Leslie but never charged him with the alleged offence.

==Personal life==
Jonsson has been married three times and has four children. She is a Manchester United fan.

She married cameraman John Turnbull in 1990. They moved to Cookham Dean in Berkshire the following year. They have one son (born 1994). They divorced in 1995.

Jonsson subsequently dated footballer Stan Collymore. In June 1998, during the 1998 World Cup, Collymore issued a public apology after he was violent towards Jonsson during an argument in a Paris bar. Soon after the end of her relationship with Collymore, she began dating German hotel manager Marcus Kempen. They have one daughter (b. 2000). Jonsson&#x27;s relationship with Kempen ended soon after the birth.

In April 2002, Jonsson confirmed reports that she had had an affair with Sven-Göran Eriksson, then-manager of England&#x27;s football team, who had a long-time girlfriend. She stated that her relationship with Eriksson had recently ended. She was given the job as a columnist for the &quot;News of the World&quot; newspaper in 2003, in which she regularly commented on Eriksson&#x27;s private life. Her column was dropped in 2007, a year after Eriksson resigned as England manager. It was announced in 2011 that she had taken legal proceedings against the newspaper alleging that an investigator had hacked into her mobile phone.

While presenting &quot;Mr. Right&quot; in 2002, Jonsson met Lance Gerrard-Wright, a contestant on the show. They subsequently began a relationship. They married in August 2003. They have one daughter (born 2004). They divorced in October 2006.

Jonsson married her third husband, American advertising executive Brian Monet, in March 2008. They have one son (born 2008). In April 2019, it was announced that they had divorced. She told &quot;Best&quot; magazine that they had tried to salvage their relationship with counselling but failed.

In 2019, she went on the dating show &quot;First Dates Hotel&quot; and began dating her match on the show, Paul.

In 2021, Jonsson was announced as a cast member in E4&#x27;s &quot;Celebs Go Dating&quot; which began airing in January 2022.

In 2022, Jonsson stated that she had had a number of same sex experiences, &quot;most certainly borne out of sexual desire.&quot;

<doc id="506266" wikidata="Q7789907" url="?curid=506266" title="Thomas Gambier Parry">
<text>Thomas Gambier Parry, J.P., D.L., (22 February 1816 – 28 September 1888) was a British artist and art collector. He is best remembered for his development of the Gambier Parry process of fresco painting, and for forming the significant collection of early Italian paintings and objects that his heirs gave to the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, where many are displayed in the Courtauld Gallery.

Thomas Gambier Parry is the father of composer Hubert Parry.

==Life==
Gambier Parry&#x27;s parents, Richard and Mary Parry of Banstead, Surrey, died when he was young and he was raised by his maternal aunts and uncles, the Gambiers, among them James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier. His grandparents were Admiral Samuel Gambier, 1752-1813 and Jane Mathew, 1759-.

He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. He moved to Highnam Court, Gloucestershire when he was 21 and, in 1839, he married, firstly, Anna Maria Isabella Fynes-Clinton, daughter of Henry Fynes Clinton. Only two of their six children survived to adulthood, Clinton Charles Parry and Charles Hubert Hastings Parry (the composer); Isabella survived the birth of Hubert in 1848 by only twelve days. In 1851, Gambier Parry married, secondly, Ethelinda Lear, daughter of Francis Lear, Dean of Salisbury, by whom he had six more children.

Thomas Gambier Parry&#x27;s father and grandfather were both directors of the British East India Company, and Gambier Parry devoted his inherited wealth to good works. He adopted the principles of the Tractarian Movement, and was a prominent member of the Ecclesiological Society. Thomas Gambier Parry was a notable collector of medieval and Renaissance art; the Courtauld Institute was bequeathed his collection in 1966.

After studying the technique of the Italian fresco painters, Thomas Gambier Parry developed his own spirit fresco method and executed grand-scale mural projects at Ely Cathedral, Gloucester Cathedral and the parish church at Highnam.

He gained the reputation of a philanthropist, founding a children&#x27;s hospital, orphanage, and college of science and art at Gloucester, and providing a church and school for his tenants at Highnam. He constructed the Church of the Holy Innocents, Highnam between 1849 and 1851 in memory of his first wife and those of his children who had died at early ages. Gambier-Parry adorned the whole of the chancel, including the roof, and much of the nave with frescoes using the new Gambier Parry process he adapted from his study of Italian fresco painters. He is buried there in a tomb designed by his son Sidney. He started to lay out the Highnam Court gardens in 1840 and was one of the first to make a pinetum; by 1874 the gardens rivalled any in the UK.

==Art collection==
Gambier Parry was a keen and versatile collector for most of his adult life. Many of his purchases were made on trips to the Continent, especially in Italy, but he also bought from dealers and auctions in England, and sometimes sold items. His most important collections were of late medieval and Early Renaissance paintings, small sculpted reliefs, ivories, and maiolica, but he also had a significant early collection of Islamic metalwork, and a variety of other types of objects, for example Hispano-Moresque ware, glass and three small post-Byzantine wooden crosses from Mount Athos, elaborately carved with miniature scenes. The Courtauld Gallery website shows images and descriptions of 324 objects from the 1966 bequest, which included the bulk of the collection.

Some items, including two Van Dyck portraits and &quot;The Gamblers&quot; by the Le Nain Brothers, as well as a collection of stoneware ceramics, were excluded from the bequest and remained at Highnam. Earlier a few important items, mainly medieval ivories, had been sold to pay death duties on the deaths of Thomas&#x27; sons Hubert and Ernest (see below). The most significant of these are three ivories in the Victoria and Albert Museum (who also have four 16th-century Limoges enamels sold in 1871) and a chasse reliquary that reached the National Gallery of Art in Washington via the Widener collection. All the objects mentioned below are included in the Courtauld bequest.

Gambier Parry began by collecting mostly 16th- and 17th-century works, but his focus gradually moved to 14th- and 15th-century works, still relatively little collected, although Prince Albert was among British collectors of &quot;Italian Primitives&quot;, as Trecento paintings were then known. Among his most important paintings were a &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot; by Lorenzo Monaco, one of the larger works in the collection, three predella panels with roundels of Christ and saints by Fra Angelico, and a small but important diptych of the Annunciation by Pesellino. There are two further predella panels by Lorenzo Monaco, and many other small panels by lesser-known masters. Later Renaissance works include ones by Il Garofalo and Sassoferrato, and there is a Baroque &quot;Assumption&quot; by Francesco Solimena. There are a number of illuminated manuscript pages from the workshop of the Boucicaut Master.

The sculptures include three fine 15th-century marble reliefs of the Virgin and Child, the most significant of them one by Mino da Fiesole. There is a Limoges enamel book cover panel, a number of Renaissance Limoges items, and several small Gothic ivories.

==Descendants==

===Sons===
Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry, 1st Baronet (1848–1918) was a leading English composer, teacher and historian of music. As a composer he is best known for the choral song &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, the coronation anthem &quot;I was glad&quot;, the choral and orchestral ode &quot;Blest Pair of Sirens&quot;, and the hymn tune &quot;Repton&quot;, which sets the words &quot;Dear Lord and Father of Mankind&quot;. His orchestral works include five symphonies and a set of Symphonic Variations. He was head of the Royal College of Music, and concurrently professor of music at the University of Oxford from 1900 to 1908.

On the death of Hubert Parry in 1918, his half-brother Ernest Gambier-Parry (1853–1936) succeeded to the family estate at Highnam. Major Gambier-Parry, in addition to his military service, was an artist, author, and musician. He was at Eton from 1866 to 1871, and served in the Volunteers and Militia, The Royal Welch Fusiliers from 1874 and the Devon Yeomanry 10 years later. In the Eastern Sudan Expedition of 1885 as a special service officer, he was seriously injured and was promoted major for services in the field. For services in World War One, when he was commandant of No. 6 Red Cross Hospital, Oxfordshire, he was made an O.B.E. in 1918. He was a frequent exhibitor at the Royal Academy and other exhibitions, and served on the Gloucester Committee of the Three Choirs Festival. He married in 1882, Evelyn Elizabeth, R.R.C., daughter of the first Lord Haldon.

Sidney Gambier-Parry (9 January 1859 – 17 November 1948) was another son of Thomas&#x27; second marriage, and an architect, especially of churches.

<text>The Dornbirner Ach (also called &quot;Dornbirner Ache&quot;) is a long stream in Vorarlberg, Austria, and a tributary of Lake Constance () and the Rhine, respectively. It flows through two gorges in its upper part, the Alploch Gorge and the Rappenloch Gorge.

==Course==

The river&#x27;s source is located in the mountains near the alpine village of (Dornbirn). Downstream, the river flows through one of the largest and most gorgeous gorges in Central Europe, the () and (), which are separated by a small reservoir lake (). Further downstream, the river cuts through the town of Dornbirn and then meanders off over a broad meadow landscape, the in the Alpine Rhine Valley, finally flowing into Upper Lake Constance.

The mouth of the river was originally near Fussach, but since the straightening of the Alpine Rhine, it flows parallel and quite close to the latter into Lake Constance near Hard. Its mouth lies west of the Bregenzer Ach.

Some of its tributaries are the Kugelbach, Bruderbach, Spätenbach, Gunzenach/Kobelach and Schwarzach.

<doc id="506276" wikidata="Q256106" url="?curid=506276" title="Equivalent dose">
<text>Equivalent dose is a dose quantity &quot; H &quot; representing the stochastic health effects of low levels of ionizing radiation on the human body which represents the probability of radiation-induced cancer and genetic damage. It is derived from the physical quantity absorbed dose, but also takes into account the biological effectiveness of the radiation, which is dependent on the radiation type and energy. In the SI system of units, the unit of measure is the sievert (Sv).

==Application==

To enable consideration of stochastic health risk, calculations are performed to convert the physical quantity absorbed dose into equivalent dose, the details of which depend on the radiation type. For applications in radiation protection and dosimetry assessment, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) have published recommendations and data on how to calculate equivalent dose from absorbed dose.

Equivalent dose is designated by the ICRP as a &quot;limiting quantity&quot;; to specify exposure limits to ensure that &quot;the occurrence of stochastic health effects is kept below unacceptable levels and that tissue reactions are avoided&quot;. This is a calculated value, as equivalent dose cannot be practically measured, and the purpose of the calculation is to generate a value of equivalent dose for comparison with observed health effects.

==Calculation==

Equivalent dose &quot;H&quot;T is calculated using the mean absorbed dose deposited in body tissue or organ T, multiplied by the radiation weighting factor &quot;W&quot;R which is dependent on the type and energy of the radiation R.

The radiation weighting factor represents the relative biological effectiveness of the radiation and modifies the absorbed dose to take account of the different biological effects of various types and energies of radiation.

The ICRP has assigned radiation weighting factors to specified radiation types dependent on their relative biological effectiveness, which are shown in accompanying table.

Calculating equivalent dose from absorbed dose;

:formula_1
where
:&quot;HT&quot;  is the equivalent dose in sieverts (Sv) absorbed by tissue T,
:&quot;DT,R&quot;  is the absorbed dose in grays (Gy) in tissue T by radiation type R and
:&quot;WR&quot;  is the radiation weighting factor defined by regulation.
Thus for example, an absorbed dose of 1 Gy by alpha particles will lead to an equivalent dose of 20 Sv, and an equivalent dose of radiation is estimated to have the same biological effect as an equal amount of absorbed dose of gamma rays, which is given a weighting factor of 1.

To obtain the equivalent dose for a mix of radiation types and energies, a sum is taken over all types of radiation energy doses. This takes into account the contributions of the varying biological effect of different radiation types.

==History==
The concept of equivalent dose was developed in the 1950s. In its 1990 recommendations, the ICRP revised the definitions of some radiation protection quantities, and provided new names for the revised quantities. Some regulators, notably the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission continue to use the old terminology of quality factors and dose equivalent, even though the underlying calculations have changed.

==Future use ==
At the ICRP 3rd International Symposium on the System of Radiological Protection in October 2015, ICRP Task Group 79 reported on the &quot;Use of Effective Dose as a Risk-related Radiological Protection Quantity&quot;.

This included a proposal to discontinue use of equivalent dose as a separate protection quantity. This would avoid confusion between equivalent dose, effective dose and dose equivalent, and to use absorbed dose in Gy as a more appropriate quantity for limiting deterministic effects to the eye lens, skin, hands &amp; feet.

These proposals will need to go through the following stages:

* Discussion within ICRP Committees
* Revision of report by Task Group
* Reconsideration by Committees and Main Commission
* Public Consultation

==Units==
The SI unit of measure for equivalent dose is the sievert, defined as one Joule per kg. In the United States the roentgen equivalent man (rem), equal to 0.01 sievert, is still in common use, although regulatory and advisory bodies are encouraging transition to sievert.

==Related quantities==

===Limitation of equivalent dose calculation===
Equivalent dose &quot;H&quot;T is used for assessing stochastic health risk due to external radiation fields that &quot;penetrate uniformly&quot; through the &quot;whole body&quot;. However it needs further corrections when the field is applied only to part(s) of the body, or non-uniformly to measure the overall stochastic health risk to the body. To enable this a further dose quantity called effective dose must be used to take into account the varying sensitivity of different organs and tissues to radiation.

===Relationship to committed dose===
Whilst equivalent dose is used for the stochastic effects of external radiation, a similar approach is used for internal, or committed dose. The ICRP defines an equivalent dose quantity for individual committed dose, which is used to measure the effect of inhaled or ingested radioactive materials. A committed dose from an internal source represents the same effective risk as the same amount of equivalent dose applied uniformly to the whole body from an external source.

Committed equivalent dose, H T(&quot;t&quot;) is the time integral of the equivalent dose rate in a particular tissue or organ that will be received by an individual following intake of radioactive material into the body by a Reference Person, where s is the integration time in years.
This refers specifically to the dose in a specific tissue or organ, in the similar way to external equivalent dose.

The ICRP states &quot;Radionuclides incorporated in the human body irradiate the tissues over time periods determined by their physical half-life and their biological retention within the body. Thus they may give rise to doses to body tissues for many months or years after the intake. The need to regulate exposures to radionuclides and the accumulation of radiation dose over extended periods of time has led to the definition of committed dose quantities&quot;.

===Equivalent dose V dose equivalent===
There is no confusion between &quot;equivalent dose&quot; and &quot;dose equivalent&quot;. Indeed, they are same concepts. Although the CIPM definition states that the linear energy transfer function of the ICRU is used in calculating the biological effect, the ICRP in 1990 developed the &quot;protection&quot; dose quantities named &quot;effective&quot; and &quot;equivalent&quot; dose, which are calculated from more complex computational models and are distinguished by not having the phrase &quot;dose equivalent&quot; in their name.

Prior to 1990, the ICRP used the term &quot;dose equivalent&quot; to refer to the absorbed dose at a point multiplied by the quality factor at that point, where the quality factor was a function of linear energy transfer (LET). Currently, the ICRP&#x27;s definition of &quot;equivalent dose&quot; represents an average dose over an organ or tissue, and radiation weighting factors are used instead of quality factors.

The phrase &quot;dose equivalent&quot; is only used for which use Q for calculation, and the following are defined as such by the ICRU and ICRP:

* ambient dose equivalent
* directional dose equivalent
* personal dose equivalent

In the US there are further differently named dose quantities which are not part of the ICRP system of quantities.

===Use of old factors===

The International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission continue to use the old terminology of quality factors and dose equivalent. The NRC quality factors are independent of linear energy transfer, though not always equal to the ICRP radiation weighting factors. The NRC&#x27;s definition of dose equivalent is &quot;the product of the absorbed dose in tissue, quality factor, and all other necessary modifying factors at the location of interest.&quot; However, it is apparent from their definition of effective dose equivalent that &quot;all other necessary modifying factors&quot; excludes the tissue weighting factor.
The radiation weighting factors for neutrons are also different between US NRC and the ICRP - see accompanying diagram.

===Dosimetry reports===
Cumulative equivalent dose due to external whole-body exposure is normally reported to nuclear energy workers in regular dosimetry reports.

In the US, three different equivalent doses are typically reported: 
*deep-dose equivalent, (DDE)
* shallow dose equivalent, (SDE)
* eye dose equivalent

<text>Friedrich Dürrenmatt&#x27;s play Romulus der Große (&quot;Romulus the Great&quot;, 1950) shows the demise of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century – taking place during the day of (and the day following) the Ides of March, 476.

The ruin of the Empire is calmly expected by the Emperor Romulus Augustulus. Despite the attempts of his ministers and courtiers to force the emperor to take decisive steps against the increasing peril of the Germanic invasion, Romulus prefers to stay at home breeding domesticated chickens and not taking action in response to the threat.

==Plot==

;Act one
The soldier Spurius Titus Mamma arrives at Romulus&#x27;s run-down country residence, bleeding and exhausted, having ridden day and night to inform the Emperor of the fall of Pavia. Romulus is eventually to be found bartering over the sale of the busts of some of Rome&#x27;s greatest historical figures. Romulus refuses to receive the news brought to him, instead insisting that Spurius Titus Mamma go to sleep whilst he himself breakfasts. Meanwhile, the Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire Zeno arrives, whose Byzantine Empire has been flooded with German ranks. His initiative is that both sides of Rome unite to fight, yet on seeing Romulus&#x27;s complacence soon decides he would rather set his resistance campaign in motion from Alexandria, whence he resolves to sail the following day. At this point the rich German trouser manufacturer Caesar Rupf arrives, offering to pay the Germanic forces 10 Million sestertii in return for a retreat, yet only if he can take the Princess Rea as his bride. Romulus refuses this, stating he would readily sell the Empire for a handful of sestertii, but he will not sell his daughter.

;Act two
The remaining secretaries of the Empire gather in the Villa&#x27;s Park, musing on the impending destruction of the Empire and contemplate begging Romulus to resume reigning and defeat the Germanic people.
Meanwhile, tortured, scalped, thin and pale, Emilian, fiancé of Rea, arrives after spending three years in German captivity. Patriotic to the core, he is disgusted at the Emperor&#x27;s &quot;dirty henhouse&quot;. On meeting, the Princess does not recognise him. He eventually reveals his identity, but speaks only of his former self, as if he were now a ghost. Rea, of course, still loves the man to whom she was engaged three years ago, which Emilian sees and takes advantage of, demanding her to &quot;take a knife&quot; and herself struggle against the Germans. Hearing of Caesar Rupf&#x27;s offer, Emilian tells Rea that she must marry the trouser manufacturer; it is because she loves him that he is able to demand this of her. The assembled, thinking the Empire has been rescued, break out into joy. However, Romulus will not grant permission for the marriage to take place.

The first signs of Romulus&#x27;s darker purpose emerge here:

&quot;My daughter will comply with the will of the Emperor. The Emperor knows what he does when he throws his realm into the fire, when he lets fall what must be destroyed, and grinds with his foot what belongs to the earth.&quot;

;Act three
The night of the Ides of March. Romulus is visited in his bedchamber by the Empress Julia, who informs him of her plan to flee to Sicily. Romulus refuses to accompany her or to reconsider his decision to forbid Rea&#x27;s marriage to Rupf. It becomes clear here that Julia and Romulus never loved one another, instead, each used the marriage for his own purpose. Julia wished to attain the status of Empress, and so married the well-descended Romulus. Romulus, however, married into the ruling bloodline with the sole purpose of liquidating a nation whose nature had become too bloody and violent to justify defence. Later that night, Rea also visits her father, whom he persuades to pursue her engagement to Emilian, for

&quot;it is much greater and harder to be faithful to a person than to the State.&quot;

Meanwhile, a cloaked figure slips in through the window and lies in wait in the darkness. Romulus sees this in the reflection on his wineglass and once Rea has gone, calls out to the figure, Emilian, to reveal himself. From here, further conspirators are discovered concealed in absurd places in Romulus&#x27;s bedchamber: the Home Secretary under the divan, Zeno in the cupboard, Spurius Titus Mamma in the wardrobe, all cloaked in black and bearing daggers.

Yet even this last try for revolution against Romulus goes awry. Romulus is unmoved; he is only surprised to learn that his Cook is one amongst the sworn traitors. The group flees as soon as news is shouted at them that a Germanic army has arrived, abandoning their plot and leaving Romulus to await his death at the hands of the German Prince Odoacer.

;Act four
Romulus awakes on the morning following the Ides of March. News is brought to him that his two butlers have been offered positions serving Caesar Rupf, with excellent pay, and that the raft carrying Rea, Julia, Emilian, the Home Secretary, the War Minister and the Cook capsized, drowning all those aboard except Zeno. Romulus receives this news stoically, declining to mourn, in anticipation of his own impending death. As Odoacer enters the Villa, Romulus has to see he is tragically mistaken - his adversary is as world-weary as himself, having been forced into a bloody streak of conquest by his people and especially his bloodthirsty nephew Theoderic. Instead of coming to kill Romulus, Odoacer begs him for help. Each tries to surrender to the other.

Both eventually conclude that they have been trying to preside over the world, when in fact the only control they truly have is over the present. Odoacer admits that if he continued to rule, Theoderic will one day depose him. Nonetheless, he yields to the title &quot;King of Italy&quot;, bestowing upon Romulus a pension of 6,000 gold coins per year and a countryside villa, in which he must live with his folly for the rest of his life.

==Historical accuracy==

Dürrenmatt took some rather great liberties in describing the historical story - in reality, Romulus Augustulus was just a child who spent only a few months in power and depended heavily upon his father, Orestes. Poultry-rearing was a habit not of Romulus, but of an earlier emperor, Honorius. Odoacer and Theoderic, on the other hand, were not family but rather leaders of two quarreling Germanic tribes. Dürrenmatt of course did not seek historical accuracy and even gave the play the following subheading: “Ungeschichtliche historische Komödie” (&quot;Unhistorical historical comedy&quot;).

==Adaptations==
*The play was televised in 1965, in black &amp; white, by Helmut Käutner for a West-German audience. Romuald Pekny starred as Romulus.
*American novelist and essayist Gore Vidal adapted the play as &quot;Romulus&quot; in 1962.</text><links>

<text>Barlonyo (also Bar Lonyo, meaning &quot;field of wealth&quot; in Luo) is a village in northern Uganda near Lira town, where a number of internally displaced people (IDPs) from parts of northern Uganda lived, as a result of a 20-year LRA insurgency. It is located in Orit Parish, at the North -eastern end of Ogur sub-county in Lira District. It is a 45-minute drive from Lira town.

At the center of this conflict is the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army (LRA) led by Joseph Kony. The LRA is a rebel group that had bases in Acholi sub Region of northern Uganda. It was formed in 1987. The rebels have been accused of many atrocities in the area, including kidnapping children to train as soldiers or use as sex slaves. The Ugandan government blamed the LRA for a massacre of over 200 civilians at the IDP camp in Barlonyo on February 21, 2004. Unofficial reports indicate that somewhere between 300 and 500 people were either massacred or went missing that day (according to locals, the government has allegedly tried to abbreviate the toll). The camp has since been disbanded by the government. Plans are in high gear to open a polytechnic school in the area in memory of the killings.

<doc id="506289" wikidata="Q4338245" url="?curid=506289" title="Singular solution">
<text>A singular solution &quot;ys&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) of an ordinary differential equation is a solution that is singular or one for which the initial value problem (also called the Cauchy problem by some authors) fails to have a unique solution at some point on the solution. The set on which a solution is singular may be as small as a single point or as large as the full real line. Solutions which are singular in the sense that the initial value problem fails to have a unique solution need not be singular functions.

In some cases, the term &quot;singular solution&quot; is used to mean a solution at which there is a failure of uniqueness to the initial value problem at every point on the curve. A singular solution in this stronger sense is often given as tangent to every solution from a family of solutions. By &quot;tangent&quot; we mean that there is a point &quot;x&quot; where &quot;ys&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;yc&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;y&#x27;s&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;y&#x27;c&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) where &quot;yc&quot; is a solution in a family of solutions parameterized by &quot;c&quot;. This means that the singular solution is the envelope of the family of solutions.

Usually, singular solutions appear in differential equations when there is a need to divide in a term that might be equal to zero. Therefore, when one is solving a differential equation and using division one must check what happens if the term is equal to zero, and whether it leads to a singular solution. The Picard–Lindelöf theorem, which gives sufficient conditions for unique solutions to exist, can be used to rule out the existence of singular solutions. Other theorems, such as the Peano existence theorem, give sufficient conditions for solutions to exist without necessarily being unique, which can allow for the existence of singular solutions.

==A divergent solution==
Consider the homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation

:formula_1

where primes denote derivatives with respect to &quot;x&quot;. The general solution to this equation is 
:formula_2

For a given formula_3, this solution is smooth except at formula_4 where the solution is divergent. Furthermore, for a given formula_5, this is the unique solution going through formula_6.

==Failure of uniqueness==
Consider the differential equation

:formula_7

A one-parameter family of solutions to this equation is given by

:formula_8

Another solution is given by

:formula_9

Since the equation being studied is a first-order equation, the initial conditions are the initial &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; values. By considering the two sets of solutions above, one can see that the solution fails to be unique when formula_10. (It can be shown that for formula_11 if a single branch of the square root is chosen, then there is a local solution which is unique using the Picard–Lindelöf theorem.) Thus, the solutions above are all singular solutions, in the sense that solution fails to be unique in a neighbourhood of one or more points. (Commonly, we say &quot;uniqueness fails&quot; at these points.) For the first set of solutions, uniqueness fails at one point, formula_12, and for the second solution, uniqueness fails at every value of formula_13. Thus, the solution formula_14 is a singular solution in the stronger sense that uniqueness fails at every value of &quot;x&quot;. However, it is not a singular function since it and all its derivatives are continuous.

In this example, the solution formula_15 is the envelope of the family of solutions formula_16. The solution formula_14 is tangent to every curve formula_18 at the point formula_19.

The failure of uniqueness can be used to construct more solutions. These can be found by taking two constant formula_20 and defining a solution formula_21 to be formula_22 when formula_23, to be formula_24 when formula_25, and to be formula_26 when formula_27. Direct calculation shows that this is a solution of the differential equation at every point, including formula_28 and formula_29. Uniqueness fails for these solutions on the interval formula_25, and the solutions are singular, in the sense that the second derivative fails to exist, at formula_28 and formula_29.

==Further example of failure of uniqueness==
The previous example might give the erroneous impression that failure of uniqueness is directly related to formula_33. Failure of uniqueness can also be seen in the following example of a Clairaut&#x27;s equation:

:formula_34

We write &quot;y&#x27; = p&quot; and then

:formula_35

Now, we shall take the differential according to &quot;x&quot;:
:formula_36
which by simple algebra yields
:formula_37

This condition is solved if 2&quot;p&quot;+&quot;x&quot;=0 or if &quot;p&quot;′=0.

If &quot;p&#x27; &quot; = 0 it means that &quot;y&#x27; = p = c&quot; = constant, and the general solution of this new equation is:
:formula_38
where &quot;c&quot; is determined by the initial value.

If &quot;x&quot; + 2&quot;p&quot; = 0 then we get that &quot;p&quot; = −½&quot;x&quot; and substituting in the ODE gives
:formula_39

Now we shall check when these solutions are singular solutions. If two solutions intersect each other, that is, they both go through the same point (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;), then there is a failure of uniqueness for a first-order ordinary differential equation. Thus, there will be a failure of uniqueness if a solution of the first form intersects the second solution.

The condition of intersection is : &quot;ys&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;yc&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). We solve
:formula_40
to find the intersection point, which is formula_41.

We can verify that the curves are tangent at this point &quot;y&#x27;s&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;y&#x27;c&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). We calculate the derivatives:

:formula_42
:formula_43

Hence,

:formula_44

is tangent to every member of the one-parameter family of solutions

:formula_45

of this Clairaut equation:

:formula_46

<text>dnaQ is the gene encoding the ε subunit of DNA polymerase III in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. The ε subunit is one of three core proteins in the DNA polymerase complex. It functions as a 3’→5’ DNA directed proofreading exonuclease that removes incorrectly incorporated bases during replication. &quot;dnaQ&quot; may also be referred to as &quot;mutD&quot;.

==Biological role==

Missense mutations in the &quot;dnaQ&quot; gene lead to the induction of the SOS DNA repair mechanism. Mutating the essential amino acid in the catalytic center of the ε subunit leads to complete loss of function.

Overexpression of the ε subunit decreases the incidence of mutations with exposure to UV, proving that the epsilon subunit has an essential function in DNA editing and preventing the initiation of SOS DNA repair.

The ε subunit has also been proven to have some impact on the growth rate of E. coli. Silencing of the &quot;dnaQ&quot; gene is correlated to significantly reduced growth.

== Interactions ==

The ε subunit is stabilized by the θ subunit within the complete polymerase complex.

The gene encodes two functional domains: the N-terminus of the gene product binds the θ subunit and carries out the exonuclease function and the C-terminus binds the α subunit responsible for polymerase activity.

A Q-linker peptide of 22 residues has been identified that links the α subunit to the ε subunit, conferring flexibility that sets the α:ε complex apart from other more restricted multi-domain proofreading polymerases.

There is interaction between the missense suppressor glycine tRNA encoded by the &quot;mutA&quot; gene that is correlated to significantly increased mutation rate in cells that express the gene. The uncharged MutA tRNA possesses complementarity to a region in the 5&#x27; end of the &quot;dnaQ&quot; mRNA. This allows it to act as an antisense mRNA that directs the degradation of the dnaQ transcript and thus, a lower abundance of the subunit and increased frequency of mutation. More recently, it was suggested that the tRNA directs replacement of essential glutamate residues with glycine, leading to aberrant ε subunits and resulting in an increase in mutations. Studies with T4 bacteriophage and &quot;E. coli&quot; with defective &quot;dnaQ&quot; genes give evidence that the mutA tRNA may not have any effect on the transcription of the &quot;dnaQ&quot; gene but may affect the translation of the gene product.

==Related sequences==
Sequences have been found in other organisms that encode gene products with a similar function to &quot;dnaQ&quot;:

In &quot;Mycobaterium tuberculosis&quot;, the gene &quot;dnaE1&quot; encodes a polymerase and histidinol-phosphatase (PHP) domain that carries out the 3’→5’ exonuclease and proofreading function.

&quot;TREX1&quot;, the major 3&#x27;→5&#x27; exonuclease in humans, was initially called DNase III because it showed sequence homology with &quot;dnaQ&quot; in E. coli and with eukaryotic DNA polymerase epsilon and to possess biochemical characteristics that associate with the capability of DNA proofreading. It is responsible for metabolizing both single stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double stranded DNA (dsDNA) with mismatched 3&#x27; ends and is directed by endogenous retroelements.

==Evolution of dnaQ==

During DNA replication in bacteria two key functions are expressed. The first is a DNA polymerizing function of DNA polymerase, and the second is a 3’ to 5’ exonuclease editing function. Both of these functions may be encoded within one gene, or alternatively the two functions may be encoded by separate genes. Two bacterial species that had diverged early in the course of evolution showing each of the alternative patterns were studied. In the Gram-negative bacteria &quot;Salmonella typhimurium&quot; the 3’ to 5’ editing function employed during DNA replication is encoded by gene &quot;dnaQ&quot; which specifies a 3’ to 5’ exonuclease subunit, one of the three separately encoded core proteins of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The complete nucleotide sequence of &quot;dnaQ&quot; of &quot;S. typhimurium&quot; was determined. The DNA polymerase from the early diverging bacterial species, &quot;Buchnera aphidicola&quot;, was also sequenced. In this case, the DNA polymerase encoded by the DNA III (polC) gene contains both DNA polymerase and 3’ to 5’ exonuclease domains. This arrangement is in contrast to &quot;S. typhimurium&quot; in which these domains are encoded in separate genes. Based on the sequence homologies found between the DNA regions encoding the 3’ to 5’ editing functions in these bacteria, it was proposed that a last common ancestor of &quot;S. typhimurium&quot; and &quot;B. aphidicola&quot; had a single gene containing both 3’ to 5’ exonuclease and DNA polymerase domains. The evolutionary divergence of these bacteria (about 0.25 to 1.2 billion years ago), appears to have been associated with the separation of the DNA polymerase gene function from the 3’ to 5’ exonuclease editing gene function in the lineage containing &quot;S. typhimurium&quot;.

When it was introduced in the French newspaper in June 1833, the term &#x27;phénakisticope&#x27; was explained to be from the root Greek word &quot;phenakistikos&quot; (or rather from &quot;phenakizein&quot;), meaning &quot;deceiving&quot; or &quot;cheating&quot;, and &quot;óps&quot;, meaning &quot;eye&quot; or &quot;face&quot;, so it was probably intended loosely as &#x27;optical deception&#x27; or &#x27;optical illusion&#x27;.

The term phénakisticope was first used by the French company Alphonse Giroux et Compagnie in their application for an import license (29 May 1833) and this name was used on their box sets. Fellow Parisian publisher Junin also used the term &#x27;phenakisticope&#x27; (both with and without the accent).

Inventor Joseph Plateau did not give a name for the device when he first published about it in January 1833. Later in 1833 he used &#x27;phénakisticope&#x27; in an article to refer to the published versions that he was not involved with. By then, he had an authorized set published first as &quot;Phantasmascope&quot; (by Ackermann in London), which some months later was changed into &quot;Fantascope&quot; for a new edition and sets by other animators. In many writings and presentations Plateau used both the terms &quot;phénakisticope&quot; and &quot;fantascope&quot;, seemingly accepting &quot;phénakisticope&quot; as the better-known name and holding on to &quot;fantascope&quot; as the name he preferred.

The spelling &#x27;phenakistiscope&#x27; was possibly introduced by lithographers Forrester &amp; Nichol in collaboration with optician John Dunn; they used the title &quot;The Phenakistiscope, or, Magic Disc&quot; for their box sets, as advertised in September 1833. The corrupted part &#x27;scope&#x27; was understood to be derived from Greek &#x27;skopos&#x27;, meaning &quot;aim&quot;, &quot;target&quot;, &quot;object of attention&quot; or &quot;watcher&quot;, &quot;one who watches&quot; (or rather from &quot;skopein&quot;) and was quite common in the naming of optical devices (e.g. Telescope, Microscope, Kaleidoscope, Fantascope, Bioscope).

The misspelling &#x27;phenakistoscope&#x27; can already be found in 1835 in &quot;The American Journal of Science and Arts&quot; and later ended up as a standard name through encyclopedias, for instance in &quot;A Dictionary of Science, Literature, &amp; Art&quot; (London, 1842)&quot;Iconographic Encyclopaedia of Science, Literature, and Art&quot; (New York, 1852).

==Technology==
The phénakistiscope usually comes in the form of a spinning cardboard disc attached vertically to a handle. Arrayed radially around the disc&#x27;s center is a series of pictures showing sequential phases of the animation. Small rectangular apertures are spaced evenly around the rim of the disc. The user would spin the disc and look through the moving slits at the images reflected in a mirror. The scanning of the slits across the reflected images keeps them from simply blurring together so that the user can see a rapid succession of images that appear to be a single moving picture.

When there is the same number of images as slots, the images will animate in a fixed position, but will not drift across the disc. Fewer images than slots and the images will drift in the opposite direction to that of the spinning disc. More images than slots and the images will drift in the same direction as the spinning disc.

Unlike the zoetrope and other successors, common versions of the phénakisticope could only practically be viewed by one person at a time.

The pictures of the phénakisticope became distorted when spun fast enough to produce the illusion of movement; they appeared a bit slimmer and were slightly curved. Sometimes animators drew an opposite distortion in their pictures to compensate for this. However, most animations were not intended to give a realistic representation and the distortion isn&#x27;t very obvious in cartoonish pictures.

The distortion and the flicker caused by the rotating slits are not seen in most phénakisticope animations now found online (for instance the GIF animation on this page). These are usually animations created with software. These do not replicate the actual viewing experience of a phénakisticope, but they can present the work of the animators in an optimized fashion. Some miscalculated modern re-animations also have the slits rotating (which would appear motionless when viewed through an actual phénakisticope) and the figures moving across the discs where they were supposed to stand still (or standing still when they were supposed to move around).

Most commercially produced discs are lithographic prints that were colored by hand, but also multi-color lithography and other printing techniques have been used by some manufacturers.

==Invention==
The phenakisticope was invented almost simultaneously around December 1832 by the Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau and the Austrian professor of practical geometry Simon Stampfer.

As a university student Plateau noticed in some early experiments that when looking from a small distance at two concentric cogwheels that turned fast in opposite directions, it produced the optical illusion of a motionless wheel. He later read Peter Mark Roget&#x27;s 1824 article &quot;Explanation of an optical deception in the appearance of the spokes of a wheel when seen through vertical apertures&quot; which addressed the same illusion. Plateau decided to investigate the phenomenon further and later published his findings in &quot;Correspondance Mathématique et Physique&quot; in 1828. In a letter to the same scientific periodical dated December 5, 1829 he presented his (still nameless) Anorthoscope, a disc that turns an anamorphic picture into a normal picture when it is spun fast and seen through the four radial slits of a counter-rotating black disc. This invention was later marketed, for instance by Newton &amp; Co in London.

On 10 December 1830 Michael Faraday presented a paper at the Royal Institution of Great Britain called &quot;On a Peculiar Class of Optical Deceptions&quot; about the optical illusions that could be found in rotating wheels. He referred to Roget&#x27;s paper and described his associated new findings. Much was similar to what Plateau had published and Faraday not only acknowledged this publicly but also corresponded with Plateau personally and sent him his paper. Some of Faraday&#x27;s experiments were new to Plateau and especially the one with a fixed image produced by a turning wheel in front of the mirror inspired Plateau with the idea for new illusions. In July 1832 Plateau sent a letter to Faraday and added an experimental disc with some &quot;anamorphoses&quot; that produced a &quot;completely immobile image of a little perfectly regular horse&quot; when rotated in front of a mirror. After several attempts and many difficulties he constructed a working model of the phénakisticope in November or December 1832. Plateau published his invention in a 20 January 1833 letter to &quot;Correspondance Mathématique et Physique&quot;. He believed that if the manner of producing the illusions could be somehow modified, they could be put to other uses, &quot;for example, in phantasmagoria&quot;.

Stampfer read about Faraday&#x27;s findings in December 1832 and was inspired to do similar experiments, which soon led to his invention of what he called &quot;Stroboscopischen Scheiben oder optischen Zauberscheiben&quot; (stroboscope discs or optical magic discs). Stampfer had thought of placing the sequence of images on either a disc, a cylinder (like the later zoetrope) or, for a greater number of images, on a long, looped strip of paper or canvas stretched around two parallel rollers (much like film reels). He also suggests covering up most of the disc or the mirror with a cut-out sheet of cardboard so that one sees only one of the moving figures and painting theatrical coulisses and backdrops around the cut-out part (somewhat similar to the later Praxinoscope-Theatre). 
Stampfer also mentioned a version which has a disc with pictures on one end and a slotted disc on the other side of an axis, but he found spinning the disc in front of a mirror more simple. By February 1833 he had prepared six double-sided discs, which were later published by Trentsensky &amp; Vieweg. Matthias Trentsensky and Stampfer were granted an Austrian patent (Kaiserlichen königlichen Privilegium) for the discs on 7 May 1833.

Publisher and Plateau&#x27;s doctoral adviser Adolphe Quetelet claimed to have received a working model to present to Faraday as early as November 1832. Plateau mentioned in 1836 that he thought it difficult to state the exact time when he got the idea, but he believed he was first able to successfully assemble his invention in December. He stated to trust the assertion of Stampfer to have invented his version at the same time.

Peter Mark Roget claimed in 1834 to have constructed several phénakisticopes and showed them to many friends as early as in the spring of 1831, but as a consequence of more serious occupations he did not get around to publishing any account of his invention.

==Commercial production==

According to Mathias Trentsensky, of art dealer and publishing company Trentsensky &amp; Vieweg, Stampfer had prepared six double-sided discs as early as February 1833 and had repeatedly demonstrated these to many friends. In April 1833 Trentsensky applied for an Austrian patent (k.k. Privilegium) together with Stampfer, which was granted on 7 May 1833. A first edition of four double-sided discs was soon published, but it sold out within four weeks and left them unable to ship orders. These discs probably had round holes as illustrated in an 1868 article and a 1922 reconstruction by William Day, but no original copies are known to still exist.
Trentsensky &amp; Vieweg published an improved and expanded set of eight double-sided discs with vertical slits in July 1833. English editions were published not much later with James Black and Joseph Myers &amp; Co. A total of 28 different disc designs have been credited to Professor Stampfer.

Joseph Plateau never patented his invention, but he did design his own set of six discs for Ackermann &amp; Co in London. The series was published in July 1833 as &quot;Phantasmascope&quot;. In October 1833, Ackermann &amp; Co changed the name of the series to &quot;Fantascope&quot; and released two more sets of six discs each, one designed by Thomas Talbot Bury and one by Thomas Mann Baynes.

In the meantime some other publishers had apparently been inspired by the first edition of Professor Stampfer&#x27;s Stroboscopische Scheiben: 
Alphonse Giroux et Compagnie applied for a French import license on 28 May 1833 for &#x27;Le Phénakisticope&#x27; and were granted one on 5 August 1833. They had a first set of 12 single sided discs available before the end of June 1833. Before the end of December 1833 they released two more sets.

By 16 June 1833, Joh. Val. Albert published &quot;Die belebte Wunderscheibe&quot; in Frankfurt and soon marketed internationally. This version had uncut discs with pictures and a separate larger disc with round holes. The set of &quot;Die Belebte Wunderscheibe&quot; in Dick Balzer&#x27;s collection shows several discs with designs that are very similar to those of Stampfer and about half of them are also very similar to those of Giroux&#x27;s first set. 
It is unclear where these early designs (other than Stampfer&#x27;s) originated, but many of them would be repeated on many discs of many other publishers. It is unlikely that much of this copying was done with any licensing between companies or artists.

Joseph Plateau and Simon Stampfer both complained around July 1833 that the designs of the discs they had seen around (besides their own) were poorly executed and they did not want to be associated with them.

The phénakisticope became very popular and soon there were very many other publishers releasing discs with numerous names, including:

After its commercial introduction by the Milton Bradley Company, the Zoetrope (patented in 1867) soon became the more popular animation device and consequently fewer phénakisticopes were produced.

==Variations==
Many versions of the phénakisticope used smaller illustrated uncut cardboard discs that had to be placed on a larger slotted disc. A common variant had the illustrated disc on one end of a brass axis and the slotted disc on the other end; this was slightly more unwieldy but needed no mirror and was claimed to produce clearer images.

Fores offered an &quot;Exhibitor&quot;: a handle for two slotted discs with the pictures facing each other which allowed two viewers to look at the animations at the same time, without a mirror.

A few discs had a shaped edge on the cardboard to allow for the illusion of figures crawling over the edge. Ackermann &amp; Co published three of those discs in 1833, including one by inventor Joseph Plateau.

Some versions added a wooden stand with a hand-cranked mechanism to spin the disc.

Several phénakisticope projectors with glass discs were produced and marketed since the 1850s.

Joseph Plateau created a combination of his phénakisticope and his Anorthoscope sometime between 1844 and 1849, resulting in a back-lit transparent disc with a sequence of figures that are animated when it is rotated behind a counter-rotating black disc with four illuminated slits, spinning four times as fast. Unlike the phénakisticope several persons could view the animation at the same time. This system has not been commercialised; the only known two handmade discs are in the Joseph Plateau Collection of the Ghent University. Belgian painter Jean Baptiste Madou created the first images on these discs and Plateau painted the successive parts.

In 1849 Joseph Plateau discussed the possibilities of combining the phénakisticope with the stereoscope as suggested to him by its inventor Charles Wheatstone. In 1852 Duboscq patented such a &quot;Stéréoscope-fantascope, stéréofantscope ou Bïoscope&quot;. Of three planned variations only one was actually produced but without much success. Only one extant disc is known, which is in the Plateau collection of Ghent University.

== Projection ==
The first known plan for a phénakisticope projector with a transparent disc was made by Englishman T.W. Naylor in 1843 in the &quot;Mechanical&#x27;s Magazine – Volume 38&quot;. His letter was illustrated with a detailed side view of the device. Naylor suggested tracing the pictures of available phenakisticopes onto glass with transparent paint and painting the rest black. Nothing else is known of Naylor or his machine.

Franz von Uchatius possibly read about Naylor&#x27;s idea in German or Austrian technical journals and started to develop his own version around 1851. Instrument maker Wenzel Prokesch made a first model for him which could only project images of a few inches in diameter. A more successful second model by Prokesch had a stationary disc with transparent pictures with a separate lens for each picture focused on the same spot on a screen. A limelight revolved rapidly behind the disc to project the sequential images one by one in succession. This model was demonstrated to the Austrian Academy of Sciences in 1853. Prokesch marketed the machine and sold one to magician Ludwig Döbler who used it in his shows that also included other magic lantern techniques, like dissolving views.

From around 1853 until the 1890s J. Duboscq in Paris marketed different models of a projection phénakisticope. It had a glass disc with a diameter of 34 centimeters for the pictures and a separate disc with four lenses. The discs rotated at different speeds.

An &quot;Optical Instrument&quot; was patented in the U.S. in 1869 by O.B. Brown, using a phenakistiscope-like disc with a technique very close to the later cinematograph; with Maltese Cross motion; a star-wheel and pin being used for intermittent motion, and a two-sector shutter.

Thomas Ross developed a small transparent phénakisticope system, called &quot;Wheel of life&quot;, which fitted inside a standard magic lantern slide. A first version, patented in 1869, had a glass disc with eight phases of a movement and a counter-rotating glass shutter disc with eight apertures. The discs depicted Ice Skaters, Fishes, Giant&#x27;s Ladder, Bottle Imp and other subjects. An improved version had 13 images and a single slot shutter disc and received British Patent 2685 on 10 October 1871.

Henry Renno Heyl presented his &quot;Phasmatrope&quot; on 5 February 1870 at the Philadelphia Academy of Music. This modified magic lantern had a wheel that could hold 16 photographic slides and a shutter. The wheel was rotated in front of the light source by an intermittent mechanism to project the slides successively (probably with a speed of 3 fps). The program contained three subjects: All Right (a popular Japanese acrobat), Brother Jonathan and a waltzing couple. Brother Jonathan addressed the audience with a voice actor behind the screen and professed that &quot;this art will rapidly develop into one of the greatest merit for instruction and enjoyment.&quot; The pictures of the waltzing couple survived and consist of four shots of costumed dancers (Heyl and a female dancing partner) that were repeated four times in the wheel. The pictures were posed. Capturing movement with &quot;instantaneous photography&quot; would first be established by Eadward Muybridge in 1878.

Eadward Muybridge created his &quot;Zoopraxiscope&quot; in 1879 and lectured until 1894 with this projector for glass discs on which pictures in transparent paint were derived from his chronophotographic plates.

== Scientific use ==
The phénakisticope was invented through scientific research into optical illusions and published as such, but soon the device was marketed very successfully as an entertaining novelty toy. After the novelty wore off, it was mostly seen as a toy for children. Nonetheless, some scientists still regard it as a useful demonstration tool.

The Czech physiologist Jan Purkyně used his version, called Phorolyt, in lectures since 1837. In 1861 one of the subjects he illustrated was the beating of a heart.

German physicist Johann Heinrich Jakob Müller published a set of 8 discs depicting several wave motions (waves of sound, air, water, etcetera) with J.V. Albert in Frankfurt in 1846.

The famous English pioneer of photographic motion studies Eadweard Muybridge built a phenakisticope projector for which he had his photographs rendered as contours on glass discs. The results were not always very scientific; he often edited his photographic sequences for aesthetic reasons and for the glass discs he sometimes even reworked images from multiple photographs into new combinations. An entertaining example is the sequence of a man somersaulting over a bull chased by a dog. For only one disc he chose a photographic representation; the sequence of a running horse skeleton, which was probably too detailed to be painted on glass. This disc was most likely the very first time a stop motion technique was successfully applied. Muybridge first called his apparatus Zoogyroscope, but soon settled on the name Zoöpraxiscope. He used it in countless lectures on human and animal locomotion between 1880 and 1895.

==20th and 21st centuries==
The Joseph Plateau Award, a trophy resembling a phénakisticope, was a Belgian movie award given yearly between 1985 and 2006.

Several vinyl music releases have phénakistiscope-like animations on the labels or on the vinyl itself. In 1956 Red Raven Movie Records started a series of 78 RPM 8&quot; singles with animations to be viewed with a device with small mirrors similar to a praxinoscope to be placed on the center of the disc. Since 2010 audio-visual duo Sculpture has released several picture discs with very elaborate animations to be viewed under a stroboscope flashing exactly 25 times per second, or filmed with a video camera shooting progressively at a very high shutter speed with a frame rate of 25fps.

<doc id="506293" wikidata="Q2031164" url="?curid=506293" title="Processivity">
<text>In molecular biology and biochemistry, processivity is an enzyme&#x27;s ability to catalyze &quot;consecutive reactions without releasing its substrate&quot;.

For example, processivity is the average number of nucleotides added by a polymerase enzyme, such as DNA polymerase, per association event with the template strand. Because the binding of the polymerase to the template is the rate-limiting step in DNA synthesis, the overall rate of DNA replication during S phase of the cell cycle is dependent on the processivity of the DNA polymerases performing the replication. DNA clamp proteins are integral components of the DNA replication machinery and serve to increase the processivity of their associated polymerases. Some polymerases add over 50,000 nucleotides to a growing DNA strand before dissociating from the template strand, giving a replication rate of up to 1,000 nucleotides per second.

==DNA binding interactions==
Polymerases interact with the phosphate backbone and the minor groove of the DNA, so their interactions do not depend on the specific nucleotide sequence. The binding is largely mediated by electrostatic interactions between the DNA and the &quot;thumb&quot; and &quot;palm&quot; domains of the metaphorically hand-shaped DNA polymerase molecule. When the polymerase advances along the DNA sequence after adding a nucleotide, the interactions with the minor groove dissociate but those with the phosphate backbone remain more stable, allowing rapid re-binding to the minor groove at the next nucleotide.

Interactions with the DNA are also facilitated by DNA clamp proteins, which are multimeric proteins that completely encircle the DNA, with which they associate at replication forks. Their central pore is sufficiently large to admit the DNA strands and some surrounding water molecules, which allows the clamp to slide along the DNA without dissociating from it and without loosening the protein–protein interactions that maintain the toroid shape. When associated with a DNA clamp, DNA polymerase is dramatically more processive; without the clamp most polymerases have a processivity of only about 100 nucleotides. The interactions between the polymerase and the clamp are more persistent than those between the polymerase and the DNA. Thus, when the polymerase dissociates from the DNA, it is still bound to the clamp and can rapidly reassociate with the DNA. An example of such a DNA clamp is PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) found in &quot;S. cervesiae&quot;.

==Polymerase processivities==
Multiple DNA polymerases have specialized roles in the DNA replication process. In &quot;E. coli&quot;, which replicates its entire genome from a single replication fork, the polymerase DNA Pol III is the enzyme primarily responsible for DNA replication and forms a replication complex with extremely high processivity. The related DNA Pol I has exonuclease activity and serves to degrade the RNA primers used to initiate DNA synthesis. Pol I then synthesizes the short DNA fragments in place of the former RNA fragments. Thus Pol I is much less processive than Pol III because its primary function in DNA replication is to create many short DNA regions rather than a few very long regions.

In eukaryotes, which have a much higher diversity of DNA polymerases, the low-processivity initiating enzyme is called Pol α, and the high-processivity extension enzymes are Pol δ and Pol ε. Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes must &quot;trade&quot; bound polymerases to make the transition from initiation to elongation. This process is called polymerase switching.

<text>A center-fire (or centerfire) is a type of metallic cartridge used in firearms, where the primer is located at the center of the base of its casing (i.e. &quot;case head&quot;). Unlike rimfire cartridges, the centerfire primer is typically a separate component seated into a recessed cavity (known as the &quot;primer pocket&quot;) in the case head and is replaceable by reloading the cartridge.

Centerfire cartridges have supplanted the rimfire cartridge, with the exception of a few small calibers. The majority of today&#x27;s handguns, rifles, and shotguns use centerfire ammunition, with the exception of some .17 caliber, .20 caliber, and .22 caliber rimfire handgun and rifle cartridges, a few small-bore/gauge shotgun shells (intended mainly for use in pest control), and a handful of antiquated rimfire and pinfire cartridges for various firearm actions.

==History==
An early form of centerfire ammunition, without a percussion cap, was invented between 1808 and 1812 by Jean Samuel Pauly. This was also the first fully integrated cartridge and used a form of obturation employing the cartridge itself. Another form of centerfire ammunition was invented by the Frenchman Clement Pottet in 1829; however, Pottet would not perfect his design until 1855. U.S. General Stephen Vincent Benét developed an internally primed center-fire cartridge that was adopted by the U.S. Army Ordnance Department starting in 1868, ultimately being phased out in the mid 1880s.

The centerfire cartridge was improved by Béatus Beringer, Benjamin Houllier, Gastinne Renette, Smith &amp; Wesson, Charles Lancaster, Jules-Félix Gévelot, George Morse, Francois Schneider, Hiram Berdan and Edward Mounier Boxer.

==Advantages==
Centerfire cartridges are more reliable for military purposes because the thicker metal cartridge cases can withstand rougher handling without damage, and is safer to handle because explosive priming compound in a protruding rim is more likely to be triggered by impact if a rimfire cartridge is dropped or pinched. The stronger base of a centerfire cartridge is able to withstand higher chamber pressures which in turn gives bullets greater velocity and energy. While centerfire cartridge cases require a complex and expensive manufacturing process, explosive handling is simplified by avoiding the spinning process required to uniformly distribute priming explosive into the rim because of uncertainty about which angular segment of a rimfire cartridge rim will be struck by the firing pin. Larger caliber rimfire cartridges require greater volumes of priming explosive than centerfire cartridges, and the required volume may cause undesirably higher pressure spikes during the ignition process. Reducing the amount of priming explosive will greatly diminish the ignition reliability of rimfire cartridges, and increase the probability of a malfunction such as a misfire or hang fire.

Economies of scale are achieved through interchangeable primers for a wide variety of centerfire cartridge calibers. The expensive individual brass cases can be reused after replacing the primer, gunpowder and projectile. Handloading reuse is an advantage for rifles using obsolete or hard-to-find centerfire cartridges such as the 6.5×54mm Mannlicher–Schönauer, or larger calibers such as the .458 Lott, for which ammunition can be expensive. The forward portion of some empty cases can be reformed for use as obsolete or wildcat cartridges with similar base configuration. Modern cartridges larger than .22 caliber are mainly centerfire. Actions suitable for larger caliber rimfire cartridges declined in popularity until the demand for them no longer exceeded manufacturing costs, and they became obsolete.

==Primers==

The identifying feature of centerfire ammunition is the primer which is a metal cup containing a primary explosive inserted into a recess in the center of the base of the cartridge. The firearm firing pin crushes this explosive between the cup and an anvil to produce hot gas and a shower of incandescent particles to ignite the powder charge. Berdan and Boxer cartridge primers are both considered &quot;centerfire&quot; and are not interchangeable at the primer level; however, the same weapon can fire either Berdan- or Boxer-primed cartridges if the overall dimensions are the same.

The two primer types are almost impossible to distinguish by looking at the loaded cartridge, though the two (or more) flash-holes can be seen or felt inside a fired Berdan case and the larger single hole seen or felt inside a fired Boxer case. Berdan priming is less expensive to manufacture and is more commonly found in military-surplus ammunition made outside of the United States.

===Benét primer===
Invented by Stephen Vincent Benét in 1868, this is placed and hidden internally within the base of the cartridge.

===Berdan primer===
Berdan primers are named after their American inventor, Hiram Berdan of New York who invented his first variation of the Berdan primer and patented it on March 20, 1866, in . A small copper cylinder formed the shell of the cartridge, and the primer cap was pressed into a recess in the outside of the closed end of the cartridge opposite the bullet. In the end of the cartridge beneath the primer cap was a small vent-hole, as well as a small teat-like projection or point (this was to be known as an anvil later on) fashioned from the case, such that the firing pin could crush the primer against the anvil and ignite the propellant. This system worked well, allowing the option of installing a cap just before use of the propellant-loaded cartridge, as well as permitting reloading the cartridge for reuse.

Difficulties arose in practice because pressing in the cap from the outside tended to cause a swelling of the copper cartridge shell, preventing reliable seating of the cartridge in the chamber of the firearm. Berdan&#x27;s solution was to change to brass shells, and to further modify the process of installing the primer cap into the cartridge, as noted in his second Berdan Primer patent of September 29, 1868, in . Berdan primers have remained essentially the same functionally to the present day.

Berdan primers are similar to the caps used in the caplock system, being small metal cups with pressure-sensitive explosive in them. Modern Berdan primers are pressed into the &quot;primer pocket&quot; of a Berdan-type cartridge case, where they fit slightly below flush with the base of the case. Inside the primer pocket is a small bump, the &quot;anvil&quot;, that rests against the center of the cup, and usually two (or more) small holes by the sides of the anvil, which allow the flash from the primer to reach the interior of the case. Berdan cases are reusable, although the process is rather involved. The used primer must be removed, usually by hydraulic pressure, pincer, or lever that pulls the primer out of the bottom. A new primer is carefully seated against the anvil, and then the powder and a bullet are added.

====Centered single-hole primer====
From the 1880s to the 1940s, many smaller European armies were reloading their ammo for economical reasons, and for that reason they adopted the system known as either Austrian or after the George Roth factory in Vienna which patented it in 1902 even though it was known from the early-to-mid 1880s, where the anvil had a single fire hole right at its center.

===Boxer primer===

Meanwhile, Colonel Edward Mounier Boxer, of the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, England, was working on a primer cap design for cartridges, patenting it in England on October 13, 1866, and subsequently received a U.S. patent for his design on June 29, 1869, in .

Boxer primers are similar to Berdan primers with one major difference, the location of the anvil. In a Boxer primer, the anvil is a separate stirrup piece that sits inverted in the primer cup and provides sufficient resistance to the impact of the firing pin as it indents the cup and crushes the pressure-sensitive ignition compound. The primer pocket in the case head has a single flash-hole in its center. This positioning makes little or no difference to the performance of the cartridge, but it makes fired primers vastly easier to remove for reloading, as a single, centered rod pushed through the flash hole from the open end of the case will eject the two-piece primer from the primer cup. A new primer, anvil included, is then pressed into the case using a reloading press or hand-tool. Boxer priming is universal for US-manufactured civilian factory ammunition.

Boxer-primed ammunition is slightly more complex to manufacture, since the primer is in two parts in addition to the pressure-sensitive compound, but automated machinery producing the more complex primers by the hundreds of millions has eliminated that as a practical problem. And while the primer has one additional step needed during the manufacturing process, the cartridge case is simpler to make, use, and reload.

Early primers were manufactured with various dimensions and performance. Some standardization has occurred where economies of scale benefit ammunition manufacturers. Boxer primers for the United States market come in different sizes, based on the application. The types/sizes of primers are:

* 0.175&quot; (4.45 mm) diameter &quot;small pistol&quot; primers, and a thicker or stronger metal cup &quot;small rifle&quot; version for use with higher pressure loadings in weapons with heavy firing pin impact.
* 0.209&quot; (5.31 mm) diameter primers for shotgun shells and modern inline muzzleloaders, using a Boxer-type primer factory-assembled inside a tapered, flanged brass cup.
* 0.210&quot; (5.33 mm) diameter &quot;large rifle&quot; primers, and a thinner or softer metal cup &quot;large pistol&quot; version for use with lower pressure loadings in weapons with light firing pin impact. Large rifle primers are also 0.008&quot; taller than large pistol primers.
* 0.315&quot; (8.00 mm) diameter .50 BMG primers, used for the .50 Browning Machine Gun cartridge and derivatives
Examples of uses:
* .38 Special, small pistol standard
* .357 Magnum, small pistol magnum
* .45 Colt, large pistol standard
* .50 Action Express, large pistol magnum
* .223 Remington, small rifle standard
* .357 Remington Maximum, small rifle magnum
* .308 Winchester, large rifle standard
* .338 Lapua Magnum, large rifle magnum

Primer size is based on the primer pocket of the cartridge, with standard types available in large or small diameters. The primer&#x27;s explosive charge is based on the amount of ignition energy required by the cartridge design; a standard primer would be used for smaller charges or faster-burning powders, while a magnum primer would be used for the larger charges or slower-burning powders used with large cartridges or heavy charges. Rifle, large and magnum primers increase the ignition energy delivered to the powder, by supplying a hotter, stronger and/or longer-lasting flame. Pistol cartridges often are smaller than modern rifle cartridges, so they may need less primer flame than rifles require. A physical difference between pistol and rifle primers is the thickness of the primer&#x27;s case; since pistol cartridges usually operate at lower pressure levels than most rifles, their primer cups are thinner, softer, and easier to ignite, while rifle primers are thicker and stronger, requiring a harder impact from the firing pin. Despite the names &quot;pistol&quot; and &quot;rifle&quot;, the primer used depends on the cartridge, not the firearm; a few high-pressure pistol cartridges like the .221 Fireball and .454 Casull use rifle primers, while lower-pressure pistol and revolver cartridges like the .32 ACP, .380 ACP, 9mm Parabellum, .38 Special, .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum, and .45 ACP, and traditional revolver cartridges like the .32-20, .44-40, and .45 Colt, also used in lever-action rifles, these cartridges would still be loaded with pistol primers. Virtually all cartridges used solely in rifles do, however, use rifle primers. Notable exceptions to this include .458 SOCOM and .50 Beowulf, which use large pistol standard and large pistol magnum primers, respectively.

===Shotgun primers===
All modern shotgun shells (excluding specialized .22 caliber rimfire &quot;snake loads&quot; or birdshot cartridges) are centerfire. They use a large, specific shotgun primer that is based on the Boxer system, in that the primer contains the anvil against which the primary explosive is compressed by the firing pin and deformation of the primer cup.

Shotgun primers are also used as a replacement to the percussion cap ignition system in some modern black-powder firearms, and in some cases as the actual cartridge, notably the 6mm Pipet.

===Cartridge primers===
Primer actuated or piston primer cartridges use a primer in the form of a blank to contain the propellant within an empty cartridge, or in some cases as a piston to unlock the bolt and operate the weapon. These types of rounds are rarely used and are mostly found on spotting rifles.

==Primer chemistry==
Primer manufacture and insertion is the most dangerous part of small arms ammunition production. Sensitive priming compounds have claimed many lives including the founder of the famous British Eley ammunition firm. Modern commercial operations use protective shielding between operators and manufacturing equipment.

Early primers used the same mercury fulminate used in 19th century percussion caps. Black powder could be effectively ignited by hot mercury released upon decomposition. Disadvantages of mercuric primers became evident with smokeless powder loadings. Mercury fulminate slowly decomposed in storage until the remaining energy was insufficient for reliable ignition. Decreased ignition energy with age had not been recognized as a problem with black-powder loadings because black powder could be ignited by as little energy as a static electricity discharge. Smokeless powder often required more thermal energy for ignition. Misfires and hang fires became common as the remaining priming compound sputtered in old primers. A misfire would result if the priming compound either failed to react to the firing pin fall or extinguished prior to igniting the powder charge. A hang fire is a perceptible delay between the fall of the firing pin and discharge of the firearm. In extreme cases, the delay might be sufficient to be interpreted as a misfire, and the cartridge could fire as the action was being opened or the firearm pointed in an inappropriate direction.

Incandescent particles were found most effective for igniting smokeless powder after the primary explosive gases had heated the powder grains. Artillery charges frequently included a smaller quantity of black powder to be ignited by the primer, so incandescent potassium carbonate would spread fire through the smokeless powder. Potassium chlorate was added to mercury fulminate priming mixtures so incandescent potassium chloride would have a similar effect in small arms cartridges.

Priming mixtures containing mercury fulminate leave metallic mercury in the bore and empty cartridge case after firing. The mercury was largely absorbed in the smokey fouling with black-powder loads. Mercury coated the interior of brass cases with smokeless powder loads, and the higher pressures of smokeless powder charges forced the mercury into grain boundaries between brass crystals where it formed zinc and copper amalgams weakening the case so it became unsuitable for reloading. The United States Army discontinued use of mercuric priming mixtures in 1898 to allow arsenal reloading of fired cases during peacetime. Frankford Arsenal FA-70 primers used potassium chlorate as an oxidizer for lead(II) thiocyanate, to increase the sensitivity of potassium chlorate, and antimony trisulfide, as an abrasive, with minor amounts of trinitrotoluene. These corrosive primers leave a residue of potassium chloride salt in the bore after a cartridge is fired. These hygroscopic salt crystals will hold moisture from a humid atmosphere and cause rusting. These corrosive primers can cause serious damage to the gun unless the barrel and action are cleaned carefully after firing.

Civilian ammunition manufacturers began offering non-corrosive primers in the 1920s, but most military ammunition continued to use corrosive priming mixtures of established reliability. The various proprietary priming formulations used by different manufacturers produced some significantly different ignition properties until the United States issued military specifications for non-corrosive primers for 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge production. The PA-101 primers developed at Picatinny Arsenal used about 50% lead styphnate with lesser amounts of barium nitrate, antimony trisulfide, powdered aluminum and a tetrazine compound. Most United States manufacturers adopted the PA-101 military standard for their civilian production of Boxer primers. Manufacturers subsequently offered more powerful magnum primers for uniform ignition of civilian long-range or big-game cartridges with significantly greater powder capacity than required for standard infantry weapons.

Other explosives used in primers can include lead azide, potassium perchlorate, or diazodinitrophenol (DDNP). New on the market in the late 1990s are lead-free primers (see green bullet), to address concerns over the lead and other heavy-metal compounds found in older primers. The heavy metals, while small in quantity, are released in the form of a very fine soot. Some indoor firing ranges are moving to ban primers containing heavy metals due to their toxicity. Lead-free primers were originally less sensitive and had a greater moisture sensitivity and correspondingly shorter shelf life than normal noncorrosive primers. Since their introduction, lead-free primers have become better in their performance compared to early lead free primers. 

European and eastern military or surplus ammunition often uses corrosive or slightly-corrosive Berdan primers because they work reliably even under severe conditions, and have a longer storage life than the non-corrosive type primers currently in use. Modern Boxer primers are almost always non-corrosive and non-mercuric. Determination of corrosive or non-corrosive characteristics based on the primer type should consider these final headstamp dates of corrosive ammunition production:

* .45 ACP: FA 54, FCC 53, RA 52, TW 53, WCC 52, WRA 54
* .30-06 Springfield: FA 56, LC 52, RA 51, SL 52, TW 52, WCC 51, WRA 54
* FN 57

<text>Catherine Roseanne Dennis (born 25 March 1969) is a British singer, songwriter and record producer. She was discovered as a teenager by music manager Simon Fuller, which led to her featuring on the hit dance single &quot;C&#x27;mon and Get My Love&quot; with D Mob in 1989. 

In the early 1990s, Dennis saw international solo success with her debut album &quot;Move to This&quot; (1990), which included three US top-ten singles including &quot;Just Another Dream&quot; and &quot;Touch Me (All Night Long)&quot;; the latter peaked at number two and remains her signature song. It was followed by the albums &quot;Into the Skyline&quot; (1992) and &quot;Am I the Kinda Girl?&quot; (1996), her final release, which included a cover of the Kinks&#x27; &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; that reached number 11 in the UK. 

Dennis pivoted to songwriting in the 2000s and became renowned for her work, scoring eight UK number ones, winning six Ivor Novello Awards and two Grammys. Her co-credits include the multi-platinum singles &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; by Kylie Minogue, &quot;Toxic&quot; by Britney Spears, and &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot; by Katy Perry. In 2004, Dennis was listed 66th in the &quot;Q&quot; list of the 100 most influential people in music. In 2006, she won the UK music industry&#x27;s Woman of the Year Award.

==Early life==
Educated at Taverham High School, as a teenager she was spotted recording Stevie Wonder-influenced demos at The Kitchen in Norwich with her father (himself an experienced musician and local restaurateur) on piano. At the time she was working for Norwich Union. In 1986, Simon Fuller signed Dennis when she was 17 to his company 19 Management and his label Polydor, and this began a career-long association that has seen Dennis provide songs for many Fuller-related artists and projects.

==Performing career==

Dennis achieved her first success as a vocalist with D Mob, when their single &quot;C&#x27;mon and Get My Love&quot; (which was credited as &quot;introducing&quot; Dennis) reached No. 15 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 10 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1989. It is regarded as an underground classic in the dance music field, and a second collaboration with D Mob, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way of the World&quot;, was also a hit. It was followed by Dennis&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Move to This&quot;. She subsequently scored three solo hits, all of which reached the UK Top 20 and the US Top 10. She enjoyed considerable success in Japan in the early 1990s. The three solo hits were: &quot;Just Another Dream&quot; (UK No. 13, US No. 9, Australia No. 14), which featured D Mob on backing vocals; a cover of the Wish and Fonda Rae 1984 club hit &quot;Touch Me (All Night Long)&quot; (UK No. 5, US No. 2, Australia No. 16), which is probably her most remembered hit to date; and &quot;Too Many Walls&quot; (UK No. 17, US No. 8, Australia No. 57).

&quot;Touch Me (All Night Long)&quot; stayed at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for two weeks, and was kept out of the No. 1 spot by Hi-Five&#x27;s &quot;I Like The Way (The Kissing Game)&quot; in the first week, and Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Cry&quot; in the second week. The song was a cover and lyrical reworking of a 1984 single by Wish featuring Fonda Rae, which had peaked at No. 70 on the US R&amp;B chart that year. &quot;Touch Me (All Night Long)&quot; reached No. 1 on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart, and its follow-up, &quot;Too Many Walls&quot;, which Dennis co-wrote with Anne Dudley of Art of Noise (who also co-wrote the ABC track &quot;All of My Heart&quot;), was a No. 1 Adult Contemporary hit in the United States. It was around this time Dennis agreed to join &quot;Club MTV&quot;″s first tour, booked for six weeks. In an interview on the late night show &quot;Into the Night Starring Rick Dees&quot;, she explained she dropped out after three days, accusing one of Milli Vanilli&#x27;s members (the tour&#x27;s headline act) of sexual harassment. During this period, she recorded a song called &quot;Find the Key to Your Life&quot; with David Morales, for the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze&quot;. Subsequent releases were only minor hits.

Dennis released her second album, &quot;Into the Skyline&quot;, in September 1992, written with a focus toward the US market. The album featured the singles &quot;You Lied to Me&quot;, &quot;Irresistible&quot;, &quot;Moments of Love&quot;, &quot;Falling&quot;, and &quot;Why&quot; – the latter was credited to D Mob with Dennis. The album got to No. 8 in the UK Albums Chart, whilst in the US Billboard Hot 100, &quot;You Lied to Me&quot; was a Top 40 hit - her final American Top 40 single as a performer - and &quot;Irresistible&quot; made the Adult Contemporary Top 10; however, the album never charted. Dennis experienced a brief peak of fame, making a cameo in &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; singing the songs &quot;Moments of Love&quot; (a minor US Adult Contemporary chart hit), &quot;Why&quot; (in the episode, not to feature D Mob) and &quot;Touch Me (All Night Long)&quot;. In Japan, the album was called &quot;Into the Skyline +1&quot;, and featured three extra tracks: &quot;Nothing Moves Me&quot;, a previous B-side, and two tracks that were both released as singles, &quot;It&#x27;s My Style&quot;, and &quot;Love&#x27;s a Cradle&quot;. She also provided background vocals on PM Dawn&#x27;s US Top 10 and UK Top 20 hit &quot;Looking through Patient Eyes&quot;, released in 1993. In that same year, she sang a duet with Lance Ellington on the soundtrack of &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot;

Dennis began to record a third album, &quot;Inspiration&quot;. The title track was recorded with Todd Terry, along with another song &quot;Is There Life After You&quot;. Only one song from the recording sessions was ever released, &quot;S.O.S.&quot;, which can be found on the &quot;Beverly Hills 90210: The College Years&quot; soundtrack. She wrote her first song for another artist by writing a song for Dannii Minogue called &quot;Love&#x27;s on Every Corner&quot;.

In 1996, Dennis changed her musical style: away from the dance-pop sound of previous releases, to a more traditional singer-songwriter approach. The resulting album, &quot;Am I the Kinda Girl?&quot;, was more in keeping with the Britpop sound of bands such as Blur and performers such as Stephen Duffy, and featured collaborations with Guy Chambers of The Lemon Trees and Andy Partridge of XTC. Three singles from the album were released: &quot;West End Pad&quot; (UK No. 25), &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; - a cover of The Kinks&#x27; song (UK No. 11), and her last solo single, &quot;When Your Dreams Turn to Dust&quot; (UK No. 43).

In 2001, Kylie Minogue had a worldwide hit with the Dennis and Rob Davis penned song &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;. The following year Dennis won the Best Dance Recording Grammy for writing &quot;Come into My World&quot;. She followed that up with Britney Spears&#x27;s hit song &quot;Toxic&quot; which also won the Grammy for Best Dance Recording. Dennis had a string of hits with S Club 7; she wrote almost all their hit singles such as &quot;Never Had a Dream Come True&quot;, and also worked on the singles for the spin-off group S Club Juniors which was a younger version of S Club 7. Dennis wrote hit songs for Céline Dion, Delta Goodrem, and for Hear’Say and Bardot. She also wrote the fastest selling debut single in UK history for recording artist Will Young, the winner of the British music competition reality show &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, and his runner-up Gareth Gates. Dennis wrote the theme song to the television series &quot;American Idol&quot;. She wrote several songs for former S Club 7 member Rachel Stevens including &quot;Sweet Dreams My LA Ex&quot;, and also two songs for Phil Roy, one of which was on the soundtrack for the film &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot; starring Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt.

According to news reports, Dennis was working on a new album under the name Sexcassettes, which she planned to release in 2008. She has collaborated with Mark Ronson on his album, &quot;The Business&quot;. As of 2015, Dennis became a vocal affiliate with Galantis by first performing, uncredited, on their debut album &quot;Pharmacy&quot; on the tracks &quot;Runaway (U &amp; I)&quot; and &quot;Louder, Harder, Better&quot;. She later co-wrote their song &quot;Love on Me&quot; from their second album &quot;The Aviary&quot; and sang on five songs from their 2019 album &quot;Church&quot;. In 2019, Dennis returned to performing. She celebrated her 30th anniversary in the music business with a performance at London&#x27;s Mighty Hoopla Festival. In 2020 and 2021, Dennis wrote for Now United and collaborated with composer Will Gregory on the soundtrack for the BBC/Discovery Channel docuseries, &quot;Serengeti&quot;.

==Songwriting career==
Dennis has written a number of award-winning songs and international hit singles. Her first success was with &quot;Bumper to Bumper&quot;, the B-side to the Spice Girls&#x27; hit &quot;Wannabe&quot;.

Dennis continued this success by co-writing the &quot;Pop Idol&quot; theme (re-used for numerous international remakes of the show, including &quot;American Idol&quot;), and writing for Idol contestants, including Kelly Clarkson, Will Young, Gareth Gates, and Clay Aiken. Clarkson&#x27;s single &quot;Before Your Love&quot; (a double a-side with &quot;A Moment Like This&quot;) was Dennis&#x27;s first US No. 1. 

Dennis&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; (recorded by Kylie Minogue) spent four weeks at number one in Britain, while also rekindling interest in Minogue in America, where it hit no. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. With over three million copies sold worldwide, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; became the second highest selling single in 2001.

Dennis also co-wrote the international hit &quot;Toxic&quot; by Britney Spears, which went to number one in the UK and worldwide.

Dennis&#x27;s biggest success came in 2008 with Katy Perry&#x27;s smash hit &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot; co-written alongside Katy Perry, Max Martin and Dr Luke, which ranks among the best-selling digital singles in history.

Dennis co-wrote three tracks on the Galantis album &quot;Pharmacy&quot;, one of which, &quot;Runaway (U &amp; I)&quot;, reached No. 1 in the UK Dance Chart, No. 9 in the US Dance Chart, and was nominated for a Grammy Award. Dennis has written with KT Tunstall, Black Honey, and Sigala. More recently, Dennis co-wrote three tracks on the new Galantis album out in 2024 and the Laura White single &quot;Nobody&quot;.

==Personal life==
Dennis briefly dated Noel Fitzpatrick, veterinary surgeon and host of &quot;The Supervet&quot;. The relationship ended in 2003.

<text>Carlton Earl &quot;Carl&quot; Anderson (February 27, 1945 – February 23, 2004) was an American singer, film and theater actor best known for his portrayal of Judas Iscariot in the Broadway and film versions of the rock opera &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. Anderson and singer-actress Gloria Loring performed the duet &quot;Friends and Lovers&quot;, which reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1986.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Born in Lynchburg, Virginia, Anderson was one of 12 children of James and Alberta Anderson. During his junior year of high school, Anderson enlisted in the U.S. Air Force, where he served as a communications technician for two years. He returned to Lynchburg to complete high school and graduated in 1965. With his honorable discharge, following high school, Anderson sang at military bases across the United States as part of the World Wide Air Force Talent Contest.

Anderson moved to Washington, D.C., in 1969, where he studied psychology at Howard University. He and some friends also formed a group called &quot;The Second Eagle&quot;, with Anderson as lead singer. Among the many jazz and rock tunes that the Second Eagle covered were some from the album &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, which had not been released in the United States yet.

In 1971, Anderson and his band performed some songs from the album at a Palm Sunday service; this performance was covered by the &quot;Today&quot; show. A producer for the American production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; saw the performance and offered him an audition.

===Early career===
Anderson played the role of Judas in the pre-Broadway touring company&#x27;s production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; but was passed over for the initial 1971 Broadway production when producers opted for the more well-known Ben Vereen for the part, and was cast as an understudy. He took over the role performed it on Broadway and in Los Angeles when Vereen fell ill. After Vereen recovered, both actors took turns playing the role. Castmate and future close friend Ted Neeley was performing in the tour as well, but had also been cast in the chorus and as a Jesus understudy. Yvonne Elliman was also in the tour as Mary Magdalene. While performing in Los Angeles, Anderson was flown to London for a screen test for the film adaptation of the rock opera. Two weeks later, he left that production to begin filming in Israel alongside Neeley and Elliman, who were cast for the main roles as Jesus and Magdalene, respectively. The film, released in 1973 by director Norman Jewison, earned Anderson two Golden Globe nominations as &quot;Most Promising Newcomer&quot; and &quot;Best Musical Actor&quot;, as well as an NAACP Image Award.

In the late 1970s, he reprised his role as Judas for two regional productions in California, both under the auspices of the California Youth Theatre organization. The first reunited him with his Broadway and film co-stars Ted Neeley and Yvonne Elliman, and the second reunited him again with Neeley (Jesus).

Other movie appearances by Anderson include: &quot;The Black Pearl&quot; (1978) and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (1985). Television appearances include &quot;The Eddie Capra Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Cop Rock&quot;, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, Rockford Files, and &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;.

As a recording artist, Anderson was equally prolific. He signed with Motown Records in 1972. Several of the most recognizable albums to be released in the 1970s would bear the mark of Anderson, including his work with Stevie Wonder on his &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot; double album.

Anderson also made numerous appearances at several notable clubs in Los Angeles during the 1970s and, with Columbia Records&#x27; talent scout Larkin Arnold, signed a record deal for which Anderson would release four albums on the Epic label beginning in 1982. In total, Anderson released nine jazz and Soul albums as a solo artist, including moderate successes &quot;How Deep Does It Go&quot; and &quot;My Love Will&quot;, as well as the hit from his self-titled 1986 album, &quot;Friends and Lovers&quot;, a duet with Gloria Loring. The song reached the number-two spot on the charts that year and endeared Anderson to soap opera fans, after he and Loring performed the song on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. In 1989, Anderson recorded the song &quot;Between You and Me&quot;, which was used as the title theme for the film &quot;Her Alibi&quot;. He also recorded on albums with other leading artists.

===Later career===
In 1992, Anderson reprised his role as Judas in &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; for a &quot;20th Anniversary of the Movie&quot; tour, alongside Neeley who also reprised his role as Jesus. Both men had agreed to do the tour only if they got to work together. Initially planned for three months, the production lasted five years and grossed over $100 million, visiting over 50 North American cities, including the Paramount Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York City, the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles, the Fox Theaters in Detroit, St. Louis and Atlanta, the Morris Mechanic Theatre in Baltimore, The Orpheum in San Francisco, Providence Performing Arts Center in Providence, Rhode Island, the Wang Center and Shubert Theater during multiple returns to Boston as well as dates in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Miami, Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. All these showings allowed Anderson to reprise his role over 1,700 times.

In 1994, Anderson released an album titled &quot;Heavy Weather Sunlight Again&quot; which is full of soulful songs such as &quot;Love&#x27;ll Hold My Baby Tonight&quot;.

In 1997, Anderson performed on Broadway in an adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; called &quot;Play On!&quot; Beginning in 1998, and in later years of his life, he reprised his role as Judas in &quot;Superstar&quot; to sold-out auditoriums around the world.

One of his later albums, &quot;Why We Are Here!&quot;, was recorded at the Agape International Spiritual Center, then located in Santa Monica, California. He continued to perform, with Linda Eder, in a show called &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; produced by Eder&#x27;s then-husband, Frank Wildhorn.

In 2002, Anderson reprised his role as Judas in another national tour of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; with ex-Skid Row singer Sebastian Bach playing Jesus. Bach received good reviews and Anderson was again praised. In April 2003, following a disagreement with the director, Bach walked out on the tour and was replaced with Broadway actor Eric Kunze. Bach considered Anderson a father-figure and good friend. Anderson stayed on the tour for three more months, but eventually left the show after being diagnosed with leukemia. The tour closed a year after his death.

===Personal life and death===
In 1992, Anderson married Veronica Porché, former wife of boxing legend Muhammad Ali.

In 2003, while performing with the national tour of &quot;Superstar&quot; that had started the previous year, Anderson was diagnosed with leukemia. According to a page on his memorial website, Anderson was involved in a minor car accident on his way to perform and, while being treated for his injuries, doctors discovered that he had leukemia. Anderson died from the illness on February 23, 2004, four days before his 59th birthday, in Los Angeles. The Leonard Cohen / Anjani song &quot;Nightingale&quot; (2004) was recorded in his memory.

<doc id="506305" wikidata="Q1501341" url="?curid=506305" title="Praxinoscope">
<text>The praxinoscope was an animation device, the successor to the zoetrope. It was invented in France in 1877 by Charles-Émile Reynaud. Like the zoetrope, it used a strip of pictures placed around the inner surface of a spinning cylinder. The praxinoscope improved on the zoetrope by replacing its narrow viewing slits with an inner circle of mirrors, placed so that the reflections of the pictures appeared more or less stationary in position as the wheel turned. Someone looking in the mirrors would therefore see a rapid succession of images producing the illusion of motion, with a brighter and less distorted picture than the zoetrope offered.

==Variations==
Reynaud introduced the Praxinoscope-Théâtre in 1879. This was basically the same device, but it was hidden inside a box to show only the moving figures within added theatrical scenery. When the set was assembled inside the unfolded box, the viewer looked through a rectangular slot in the front, onto a plate with a transparent mirror surrounded by a printed proscenium. The mirror reflected a background and a floor that were printed on interchangeable cards placed on the inside of the folded lid of the box, below the viewing slot. The animated figures were printed on black strips, so they were all that was visible through the transparent mirror and appeared to be moving within the suggested space that was reflected from the background and floor cards. The set appeared with 20 strips (all based on previous standard praxinoscope strips), 12 backgrounds and a mirror intended for background effects for the swimming figure. This set also sold very well and appeared in slight variations, including a deluxe version made of thuja-wood with ebony inlays.

Reynaud mentioned the possibility of projecting the images in his 1877 patent. He presented a praxinoscope projection device at the Société française de photographie on 4 June 1880, but did not market his &quot;praxinoscope a projection&quot; before 1882. Only a handful of examples are known to still exist.

In 1888 Reynaud developed the Théâtre Optique, an improved version capable of projecting images on a screen from a longer roll of pictures. From 1892 he used the system for his &quot;Pantomimes lumineuses&quot;: a show with hand-drawn animated stories for larger audiences. It was very successful for several years, until it was eclipsed in popularity by the photographic film projector of the Lumière brothers.
The praxinoscope was copied by several other companies. Ernst Plank offered several variations, including one that was automated by a small hot air engine.

==20th century revival==
The Red Raven Magic Mirror and its special children&#x27;s phonograph records, introduced in the US in 1956, was a 20th-century adaptation of the praxinoscope. The Magic Mirror was a sixteen-sided praxinoscopic reflector with angled facets. It was placed over the record player&#x27;s spindle and rotated along with the 78 rpm record, which had a very large label with a sequence of sixteen interwoven animation frames arrayed around its center. As the record played, the user gazed into the Magic Mirror and saw an endlessly repeating animated scene that illustrated the recorded song. In the 1960s, versions of the Red Raven system were introduced in Europe and Japan under various names—Teddy in France and the Netherlands, Mamil Moviton in Italy, etc.

==Etymology==
The word praxinoscope translates roughly as &quot;action viewer&quot;, from the Greek roots πραξι- (confer &quot;action&quot;) and scop- (confer &quot;watcher&quot;).

<doc id="506315" wikidata="Q845661" url="?curid=506315" title="Okazaki fragments">
<text>Okazaki fragments are short sequences of DNA nucleotides (approximately 150 to 200 base pairs long in eukaryotes) which are synthesized discontinuously and later linked together by the enzyme DNA ligase to create the lagging strand during DNA replication. They were discovered in the 1960s by the Japanese molecular biologists Reiji and Tsuneko Okazaki, along with the help of some of their colleagues.

During DNA replication, the double helix is unwound and the complementary strands are separated by the enzyme DNA helicase, creating what is known as the DNA replication fork. Following this fork, DNA primase and DNA polymerase begin to act in order to create a new complementary strand. Because these enzymes can only work in the 5’ to 3’ direction, the two unwound template strands are replicated in different ways. One strand, the leading strand, undergoes a continuous replication process since its template strand has 3’ to 5’ directionality, allowing the polymerase assembling the leading strand to follow the replication fork without interruption. The lagging strand, however, cannot be created in a continuous fashion because its template strand has 5’ to 3’ directionality, which means the polymerase must work backwards from the replication fork. This causes periodic breaks in the process of creating the lagging strand. The primase and polymerase move in the opposite direction of the fork, so the enzymes must repeatedly stop and start again while the DNA helicase breaks the strands apart. Once the fragments are made, DNA ligase connects them into a single, continuous strand. The entire replication process is considered &quot;semi-discontinuous&quot; since one of the new strands is formed continuously and the other is not.

 During the 1960s, Reiji and Tsuneko Okazaki conducted experiments involving DNA replication in the bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. Before this time, it was commonly thought that replication was a continuous process for both strands, but the discoveries involving &quot;E. coli&quot; led to a new model of replication. The scientists found there was a discontinuous replication process by pulse-labeling DNA and observing changes that pointed to non-contiguous replication.

==Experiments==

The work of Kiwako Sakabe, Reiji Okazaki and Tsuneko Okazaki provided experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis that DNA replication is a discontinuous process. Previously, it was commonly accepted that replication was continuous in both the 3&#x27; to 5&#x27; and 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; directions. 3&#x27; and 5&#x27; are specifically numbered carbons on the deoxyribose ring in nucleic acids, and refer to the orientation or directionality of a strand. In 1967, Tsuneko Okazaki and Toru Ogawa suggested that there is no found mechanism that showed continuous replication in the 3&#x27; to 5&#x27; direction, only 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; using DNA polymerase, a replication enzyme. The team hypothesized that if discontinuous replication was used, short strands of DNA, synthesized at the replicating point, could be attached in the 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; direction to the older strand.

To distinguish the method of replication used by DNA experimentally, the team pulse-labeled newly replicated areas of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; chromosomes, denatured, and extracted the DNA. A large number of radioactive short units meant that the replication method was likely discontinuous. The hypothesis was further supported by the discovery of polynucleotide ligase, an enzyme that links short DNA strands together.

In 1968, Reiji and Tsuneko Okazaki gathered additional evidence of nascent DNA strands. They hypothesized that if discontinuous replication, involving short DNA chains linked together by polynucleotide ligase, is the mechanism used in DNA synthesis, then &quot;newly synthesized short DNA chains would accumulate in the cell under conditions where the function of ligase is temporarily impaired.&quot; &quot;E. coli&quot; were infected with bacteriophage T4 that produce temperature-sensitive polynucleotide ligase. The cells infected with the T4 phages accumulated a large number of short, newly synthesized DNA chains, as predicted in the hypothesis, when exposed to high temperatures. This experiment further supported the Okazakis&#x27; hypothesis of discontinuous replication and linkage by polynucleotide ligase. It disproved the notion that short chains were produced during the extraction process as well.

The Okazakis&#x27; experiments provided extensive information on the replication process of DNA and the existence of short, newly synthesized DNA chains that later became known as Okazaki fragments.

== Pathways ==

Two pathways have been proposed to process Okazaki fragments: the short flap pathway and the long flap pathway.

===Short Flap Pathway===

In the short flap pathway in eukaryotes the lagging strand of DNA is primed in short intervals. In the short pathway only, the nuclease FEN1 is involved. Pol δ frequently encounters the downstream primed Okazaki fragment and displaces the RNA/DNA initiator primer into a 5′ flap. The FEN1 5’-3’ endonuclease recognizes that the 5’ flap is displaced, and it cleaves, creating a substrate for ligation. In this method the Pol a-synthesized primer is removed. Studies show that in the FEN1 suggest a ‘tracking; model where the nuclease moves from the 5’ flap to its base to preform cleavage. The Pol δ does not process a nuclease activity to cleave the displaced flap. The FEN1 cleaves the short flap immediately after they form. The cleavage is inhibited when the 5’ end of the DNA flap is blocked either with a complementary primer or a biotin-conjugated streptavidin moiety. DNA ligase seals the nick made by the FEN1 and it creates a functional continuous double strand of DNA. PCNA simulates enzymatic functions of proteins for both FEN1 and DNA ligase. The interaction is crucial in creating proper ligation of the lagging DNA strand. Sequential strand displacement and cleavage by Pol δ and FEN1, respectively, helps to remove the entire initiator RNA before ligation. Many displacements need to take place and cleavage reactions are required to remove the initiator primer. The flap that is created and processes and it is matured by the short flap pathway.

===Long Flap Pathway===

In some cases, the FEN1 lasts for only a short period of time and disengages from the replication complex. This causes a delay in the cleavage that the flaps displaced by Pol δ become long. When the RPA reaches a long enough length, it can bind stably. When the RPA bound flaps are refactorized to FEN1 cleavage the require another nuclease for processing, this has been identified as an alternate nuclease, DNA2. DNA2 has defects in the DEN1 overexpression. The DNA2 showed to work with FEN1 to process long flaps. DNA2 can dissociate the RPA from a long flap, it does this by using a mechanism like the FEN1. It binds the flap and threads the 5’ end of the flap. The nuclease cleaves the flap making it too short to bind to the RPA, the flap being too short means it is available for FEN1 and ligation. This is known as the long flap method. DNA2 can act as FEN1 as a backup for nuclease activity but it is not an efficient process.

===Alternate pathway===

Until recently, there were only two known pathways to process Okazaki fragments. However, current investigations have concluded that a new pathway for Okazaki fragmentation and DNA replication exists. This alternate pathway involves the enzymes Pol δ with Pif1 which perform the same flap removal process as Pol δ and FEN1.

==Enzymes involved in fragment formation==
===Primase===
Primase adds RNA primers onto the lagging strand, which allows synthesis of Okazaki fragments from 5&#x27; to 3&#x27;. However, primase creates RNA primers at a much lower rate than that at which DNA polymerase synthesizes DNA on the leading strand. DNA polymerase on the lagging strand also has to be continually recycled to construct Okazaki fragments following RNA primers. This makes the speed of lagging strand synthesis much lower than that of the leading strand. To solve this, primase acts as a temporary stop signal, briefly halting the progression of the replication fork during DNA replication. This molecular process prevents the leading strand from overtaking the lagging strand.

===DNA polymerase δ===

New DNA is made during this phase by enzymes which synthesize DNA in the 5’ to 3’ direction. DNA polymerase is essential for both the leading strand which is made as a continuous strand and lagging strand which is made in small pieces in DNA Synthesis.  This process happens for extension of the newly synthesized fragment and expulsion of the RNA and DNA segment. Synthesis occurs in 3 phases with two different polymerases, DNA polymerase α-primase and DNA polymerase δ. This process starts with polymerase α-primase displacing from the RNA and DNA primer by the clamp loader replication Effect, this Effect leads the sliding clamp onto the DNA. After this, DNA polymerase δ begins to go into its holoenzyme form which then synthesis begins. The synthesis process will continue until the 5’end of the previous Okazaki fragment has arrived. Once arrived, Okazaki fragment processing proceeds to join the newly synthesized fragment to the lagging strand. Last function of DNA polymerase δ is to serve as a supplement to FEN1/RAD27 5’ Flap Endonuclease activity. The rad27-p allele is lethal in most combinations but was viable with the rad27-p polymerase and exo1. Both rad27-p polymerase and exo1 portray strong synergistic increases in CAN 1 duplication mutations. The only reason this mutation is viable is due to the double-strand break repair genes RAD50, RAD51 and RAD52. The RAD27/FEN1 creates nicks between adjacent Okazaki fragments by minimizing the amount of strand-expulsion in the lagging strand.

===DNA ligase I===
During lagging strand synthesis, DNA ligase I connects the Okazaki fragments, following replacement of the RNA primers with DNA nucleotides by DNA polymerase δ. Okazaki fragments that are not ligated could cause double-strand-breaks, which cleaves the DNA. Since only a small number of double-strand breaks are tolerated, and only a small number can be repaired, enough ligation failures could be lethal to the cell.

Further research implicates the supplementary role of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to DNA ligase I&#x27;s function of joining Okazaki fragments. When the PCNA binding site on DNA ligase I is inactive, DNA ligase I&#x27;s ability to connect Okazaki fragments is severely impaired. Thus, a proposed mechanism follows: after a PCNA-DNA polymerase δ complex synthesizes Okazaki fragments, the DNA polymerase δ is released. Then, DNA ligase I binds to the PCNA, which is clamped to the nicks of the lagging strand, and catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds.

===Flap endonuclease 1===
Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is responsible for processing Okazaki fragments. It works with DNA polymerase to remove the RNA primer of an Okazaki fragment and can remove the 5&#x27; ribonucleotide and 5&#x27; flaps when DNA polymerase displaces the strands during lagging strand synthesis. The removal of these flaps involves a process called nick translation and creates a nick for ligation. Thus, FEN1&#x27;s function is necessary to Okazaki fragment maturation in forming a long continuous DNA strand. Likewise, during DNA base repair, the damaged nucleotide is displaced into a flap and subsequently removed by FEN1.

===Dna2 endonuclease===

Dna2 endonuclease does not have a specific structure and their properties are not well characterized, but could be referred as single-stranded DNA with free ends (ssDNA). Dna2 endonuclease is essential to cleave long DNA flaps that leave FEN1 during the Okazaki Process. Dna2 endonuclease is responsible for the removal of the initiator RNA segment on Okazaki Fragments. Also, Dna2 endonuclease has a pivotal role in the intermediates created during diverse DNA metabolisms and is functional in telomere maintenance.

Dna2 endonuclease becomes active when a terminal RNA segment attaches at the 5’ end, because it translocates in the 5’ to 3’ direction. In the presence of a single stranded DNA-binding protein RPA, the DNA 5&#x27; flaps become too long, and the nicks no longer fit as substrate for FEN1. This prevents the FEN1 from removing the 5′-flaps. Thus, Dna2&#x27;s role is to reduce the 3′ end of these fragments, making it possible for FEN1 to cut the flaps, and the Okazaki fragment maturation more efficient. During the Okazaki Process, Dna2 helicase and endonuclease are inseparable. Dna2 Endonuclease does not depend on the 5’-tailed fork structure of its activity. Unproductive binding has been known to create blocks to FEN1 cleavage and tracking. It is known that ATP reduces activity, but promotes the release of the 3’-end label. Studies have suggested that a new model of Dna2 Endonuclease and FEN1 are partially responsible in Okazaki fragment maturation.

==Biological function==

Newly synthesized DNA, otherwise known as Okazaki fragments, are bound by DNA ligase, which forms a new strand of DNA. There are two strands that are created when DNA is synthesized. The leading strand is continuously synthesized and is elongated during this process to expose the template that is used for the lagging strand (Okazaki fragments). During the process of DNA replication, DNA and RNA primers are removed from the lagging strand of DNA to allow Okazaki fragments to bind to. Since this process is so common, Okazaki maturation will take place around a million times during one completion of DNA replication. For Okazaki maturation to occur, RNA primers must create segments on the fragments to be ligated. This is used as a building block for the synthesis of DNA in the lagging strand. On the template strand, polymerase will synthesize in the opposite direction from the replication fork. Once the template becomes discontinuous, it will create an Okazaki fragment. Defects in the maturation of Okazaki fragments can potentially cause strands in the DNA to break and cause different forms of chromosome abnormality. These mutations in the chromosomes can affect the appearance, the number of sets, or the number of individual chromosomes. Since chromosomes are fixed for each specific species, it can also change the DNA and cause defects in the genepool of that species.

==Differences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes==

Okazaki fragments are present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. DNA molecules in eukaryotes differ from the circular molecules of prokaryotes in that they are larger and usually have multiple origins of replication. This means that each eukaryotic chromosome is composed of many replicating units of DNA with multiple origins of replication. In comparison, prokaryotic DNA has only a single origin of replication. In eukaryotes, these replicating forks, which are numerous all along the DNA, form &quot;bubbles&quot; in the DNA during replication. The replication fork forms at a specific point called autonomously replicating sequences (ARS). Eukaryotes have a clamp loader complex and a six-unit clamp called the proliferating cell nuclear antigen. The efficient movement of the replication fork also relies critically on the rapid placement of sliding clamps at newly primed sites on the lagging DNA strand by ATP-dependent clamp loader complexes. This means that the piecewise generation of Okazaki fragments can keep up with the continuous synthesis of DNA on the leading strand. These clamp loader complexes are characteristic of all eukaryotes and separate some of the minor differences in the synthesis of Okazaki fragments in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
The lengths of Okazaki fragments in prokaryotes and eukaryotes are different as well. Prokaryotes have Okazaki fragments that are quite longer than those of eukaryotes. Eukaryotes typically have Okazaki fragments that are 100 to 200 nucleotides long, whereas fragments in prokaryotic &quot;E. coli&quot; can be 2,000 nucleotides long. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown.

Each eukaryotic chromosome is composed of many replicating units of DNA with multiple origins of replication. In comparison, the prokaryotic E. coli chromosome has only a single origin of replication. Replication in prokaryotes occurs inside of the cytoplasm, and this all begins the replication that is formed of about 100 to 200 or more nucleotides. Eukaryotic DNA molecules have a significantly larger number of replicons, about 50,000 or more; however, replication does not occur at the same time on all of the replicons. In eukaryotes, DNA replication takes place in the nucleus. A plethora replication form in just one replicating DNA molecule, the start of DNA replication is moved away by the multi-subunit protein. This replication is slow, and sometimes about 100 nucleotides per second are added.

We take from this that prokaryotic cells are simpler in structure, they have no nucleus, organelles, and very little of DNA, in the form of a single chromosome. Eukaryotic cells have nucleus with multiple organelles and more DNA arranged in linear chromosomes. We also see that the size is another difference between these prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The average eukaryotic cell has about 25 times more DNA than a prokaryotic cell does. Replication occurs much faster in prokaryotic cells than in eukaryotic cells; bacteria sometimes only take 40 minutes, while animal cells can take up to 400 hours. Eukaryotes also have a distinct operation for replicating the telomeres at the end of their last chromosomes. Prokaryotes have circular chromosomes, causing no ends to synthesize. Prokaryotes have a short replication process that occurs continuously; eukaryotic cells, on the other hand, only undertake DNA replication during the S-phase of the cell cycle.

The similarities are the steps for the DNA replication. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, replication is accomplished by unwinding the DNA by an enzyme called the DNA helicase. New strands are created by enzymes called DNA polymerases. Both of these follow a similar pattern, called semi-conservative replication, in which individual strands of DNA are produced in different directions, which makes a leading and lagging strand. These lagging strands are synthesized by the production of Okazaki fragments that are soon joined. Both of these organisms begin new DNA strands which also include small strands of RNA.

==Uses in technology==

===Medical concepts associated with Okazaki fragments===
Although cells undergo multiple steps in order to ensure there are no mutations in the genetic sequence, sometimes specific deletions and other genetic changes during Okazaki fragment maturation go unnoticed. Because Okazaki fragments are the set of nucleotides for the lagging strand, any alteration including deletions, insertions, or duplications from the original strand can cause a mutation if it is not detected and fixed. Other causes of mutations include problems with the proteins that aid in DNA replication. For example, a mutation related to primase affects RNA primer removal and can make the DNA strand more fragile and susceptible to breaks. Another mutation concerns polymerase α, which impairs the editing of the Okazaki fragment sequence and incorporation of the protein into the genetic material. Both alterations can lead to chromosomal aberrations, unintentional genetic rearrangement, and a variety of cancers later in life.

In order to test the effects of the protein mutations on living organisms, researchers genetically altered lab mice to be homozygous for another mutation in protein related to DNA replication, flap endonuclease 1, or FEN1. The results varied based on the specific gene alterations. The homozygous knockout mutant mice experienced a &quot;failure of cell proliferation&quot; and &quot;early embryonic lethality&quot; (27). The mice with the mutation F343A and F344A (also known as FFAA) died directly after birth due to complications in birth including pancytopenia and pulmonary hypoplasia. This is because the FFAA mutation prevents the FEN1 from interacting with PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), consequently not allowing it to complete its purpose during Okazaki fragment maturation. The interaction with this protein is considered to be the key molecular function in the FEN1&#x27;s biological function. The FFAA mutation causes defects in RNA primer removal and long-base pair repair, of which cause many breaks in the DNA. Under careful observation, cells homozygous for FFAA FEN1 mutations seem to display only partial defects in maturation, meaning mice heterozygous for the mutation would be able to survive into adulthood, despite sustaining multiple small nicks in their genomes. Inevitably however, these nicks prevent future DNA replication because the break causes the replication fork to collapse and causes double strand breaks in the actual DNA sequence. In time, these nicks also cause full chromosome breaks, which could lead to severe mutations and cancers. Other mutations have been implemented with altered versions of Polymerase α, leading to similar results.

<text>Fluororichterite is a rare amphibole with formula Na(NaCa)Mg5Si8O22F2.

==Occurrence==
Fluororichterite was first reported from the Ilmen Nature Reserve, Ilmen Mountains, Chelyabinsk Oblast&#x27;, Southern Urals, Russia. It was recognized by the International Mineralogical Association in 1994. Its name is derived from its fluorine content and relation to richterite.

At the type locality in the Ilmen Mountains fluororichterite occurs in carbonate veins in amphibolites and ultramafic rocks. In the Essonville occurrence in Wilberforce, Ontario it occurs in a limestone lens within a gneiss and is associated with phlogopite and calcite. It has also been reported from Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain and China. At Coyote Peak in the Coastal Range, Humboldt County, California, it occurs with a variety of rare minerals in an alkaline mafic diatreme.

<doc id="506318" wikidata="Q337104" url="?curid=506318" title="Belgae">
<text>The Belgae () were a large confederation of tribes living in northern Gaul, between the English Channel, the west bank of the Rhine, and the northern bank of the river Seine, from at least the third century BC. They were discussed in depth by Julius Caesar in his account of his wars in Gaul. Some peoples in southern Britain were also called Belgae and had apparently moved from the continent. T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly believed that some had moved further west and he equated them with the Fir Bolg in Ireland. The Roman province of Gallia Belgica was named after the continental Belgae. The term continued to be used in the region until the present day and is reflected in the name of the modern country of Belgium.

==Etymology==
The consensus among linguists is that the ethnic name &quot;Belgae&quot; probably comes from the Proto-Celtic root &quot;*belg-&quot; or &quot;*bolg-&quot; meaning &quot;to swell (particularly with anger/battle fury/etc.)&quot;, cognate with the Dutch adjective &quot;gebelgd&quot; &quot;very angry&quot; (weak perfect participle of the verb &quot;belgen&quot; &quot;to become angry&quot;) and &quot;verbolgen&quot; &quot;being angry&quot; (strong perfect participle of obsolete &quot;verbelgen&quot; &quot;to make angry&quot;), as well as the Old English verb &quot;belgan&quot;, &quot;to be angry&quot; (from Proto-Germanic &quot;*balgiz&quot;), derived ultimately from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*bhelgh-&quot; (&quot;to swell, bulge, billow&quot;). Thus, a Proto-Celtic ethnic name &quot;*Bolgoi&quot; could be interpreted as &quot;the people who swell (particularly with anger/battle fury)&quot;.

==Origins of the Belgae==
In Caesar&#x27;s usage, &quot;Belgium&quot; is a geographical subregion comprising the Bellovaci, Ambiani, Atrebates, and Veromandui. These four communities are widely thought to have been the original Belgae in Gaul.

Julius Caesar describes Gaul at the time of his conquests (58–51 BC) as divided into three parts, inhabited by the Aquitani in the southwest, the Gauls in the biggest central part, who in their own language were called Celtae, and the Belgae in the north. Each of these three parts, he says, differed in terms of customs, laws and language. He noted that the Belgae, were &quot;the bravest, because they are furthest from the civilization and refinement of [our] Province, and merchants least frequently resort to them, and import those things which tend to effeminate the mind; and they are the nearest to the Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war&quot;. Ancient sources such as Caesar are not always clear about the things used to define ethnicity today. While Caesar or his sources described the Belgae as distinctly different from the Gauls, Strabo stated that the differences between the Celts (Gauls) and Belgae in countenance, language, politics and way of life was a small one, unlike the difference between the Aquitanians and Celts. The fact that the Belgae were living in Gaul means that in one sense they were Gauls. This may be Caesar&#x27;s meaning when he says &quot;The Belgae have the same method of attacking a fortress as the rest of the Gauls&quot;.

Inconsistently, Caesar in &quot;Bello Gallico&quot;, II.4 also contrasted them with Gauls:
:When Caesar inquired of them what states were in arms, how powerful they were, and what they could do, in war, he received the following information: that the greater part of the Belgae were sprung, from the Germans, and that having crossed the Rhine at an early period, they had settled there, on account of the fertility of the country, and had driven out the Gauls who inhabited those regions; and that they were the only people who, in the memory of our fathers [i.e. as far as we can remember], when all Gaul was overrun, had prevented the Teutones and the Cimbri from entering their territories; the effect of which was, that, from the recollection of those events, they assumed to themselves great authority and haughtiness in military matters.

So Caesar used the word &quot;Germani&quot; in two ways. He described a group of tribes within the Belgic alliance as the &quot;Germani&quot;, distinguishing them from their neighbours. The most important of these tribes in relation to Caesar&#x27;s campaigns were the Eburones. The other way he used the term was to refer to those related tribes east of the Rhine, who were not Celtic. So the Germani among the Belgae are called, based on Caesar&#x27;s account, the &quot;Germani cisrhenani&quot;, to distinguish them from other Germani living east of the Rhine in what he understood to be their homeland. However, the later historian Tacitus was informed that the name Germania was known to have changed in meaning:
:The first people to cross the Rhine and oust the Gauls, those now called Tungri, were then called Germani. It was the name of this nation, not a race, that gradually came into general use. And so, to begin with, they were all called Germani after the conquerors because of the terror these inspired, and then, once the name had been devised, they adopted it themselves.

In other words, Tacitus understood that the collective name Germani had first been used in Gaul, for a specific people there with connections beyond the Rhine, the Tungri being the name of the people living where the Eburones had lived in later imperial times, and was later adopted as a collective name for the non-Celtic peoples beyond the Rhine, the other, better-known way that Caesar used the term.

==Culture==
The cultural cohesion of &quot;Belgium&quot; as Caesar sketched it is suggested by the maintaining of these borders, more or less, in administrative divisions (&quot;pagi&quot;) mapped out later by the Romans and still evident in the parishes of the Carolingian era. Archaeology suggests cultural continuities from the third through the first centuries BC within this subregion, inhabited in the time of Caesar by Bellovaci, Ambiani, Atrebates, and Veromandui.

From 250 BC onward, the disposal of the dead was primarily through cremation, with some inhumation practiced. Ceramics and brooches are typical grave goods, while items of feasting appear in wealthier graves. The absence of weapons distinguishes these burials from the funerary practice of communities to the north and south.

Around this same time, a characteristic form of enclosed sanctuary began to be built, and from the late 2nd through the mid 1st centuries BC, fortifications with a high earthen rampart and a wide, flat-bottomed ditch are concentrated there.

The coinage of the Belgae in Gaul shows commonalities in design and distribution patterns from the 4th through the 1st centuries BC.

The Belgae of this period do not appear to have drunk beer.

==Language==

Caesar&#x27;s book &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot; begins: &quot;All Gaul is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another, those who in their own language are called Celts, in ours Gauls, the third. All these differ from each other in language, customs and laws.&quot; However, many modern scholars believe that the Belgae were a Celtic-speaking group. On the other hand, at least part of the Belgae may also have had significant cultural and historical connections to peoples east of the Rhine, including Germanic peoples, judging from archaeological, placename and textual evidence. It has also been argued based on placename studies that the older language of the area, though apparently Indo-European, was not Celtic (see Nordwestblock) and that Celtic, though influential amongst the elite, might never have been the main language of the part of the Belgic area north of the Ardennes. For example, Maurits Gysseling suggested that prior to Celtic and Germanic influences the Belgae may have comprised a distinct Indo-European branch, termed Belgian.

However, most of the Belgic tribal and personal names recorded are identifiably Gaulish, including those of the &quot;Germani cisrhenani&quot;, and this is indeed also true of the tribes immediately over the Rhine at this time, such as the Tencteri and Usipetes. Surviving inscriptions also indicate that Gaulish was spoken in at least part of Belgic territory.

The Romans were not precise in their ethnography of northern barbarians: by &quot;Germanic&quot;, Caesar may simply have meant &quot;originating east of the Rhine&quot; (the homeland of the &quot;Germani cisrhenani&quot;) with no distinction of language intended. The east of the Rhine was not necessarily inhabited by Germanic speakers at this time. It has been remarked that Germanic speakers might have been no closer than the river Elbe in the time of Caesar. However, studies of place names, such as those of Maurits Gysseling, have been argued to show evidence of the pre-Roman presence of early Germanic languages throughout the Belgic area north of the Ardennes, where the &quot;Germani cisrhenani&quot; lived. The sound changes described by &quot;Grimm&#x27;s law&quot; appear to have affected names with older forms, apparently already in the second century BC. Strong evidence for old Celtic placenames, though, is found in the Ardennes and to the south of them. According to Strabo, the country of the Belgae extended along the coast where 15 tribes were living from the Rhenus (Rhine) to the Liger (Loire). Strabo also says that &quot;Augustus Caesar, when dividing the country into four parts, united the Keltae to the Narbonnaise; the Aquitani he preserved the same as Julius Caesar, but added thereto fourteen other nations of those who dwelt between the Garonne and the river Loire, and dividing the rest into two parts, the one extending to the upper districts of the Rhine (Gallia Lugdunensis) he made dependent upon Lugdunum, the other [he assigned] to the Belgae (Gallia Belgica).&quot;

Apart from the Germani, the report of Caesar seems to indicate that more of the Belgae had some Germanic ethnicity, but this is not necessarily what defines a tribe as Belgic. Edith Wightman proposed that Caesar can be read as treating only the southwestern Belgic tribes, the Suessiones, Viromandui and Ambiani and perhaps some of their neighbours, as the true ethnic Belgae, as opposed to those in a political and military alliance with them. She reads Caesar as implying a &quot;transition zone&quot; of mixed ethnicity and ancestry for the Menapii, Nervii and Morini, all living in the northwest of the Belgic region, neighbours to the &quot;Germani cisrhenani&quot; in the northeast. (Caesar also mentions his allies the Remi being closest to the Celts amongst the Belgae.)

It seems that, whatever their ancestry, at least some of the Belgic tribes spoke a variety of Gaulish as their main language by Caesar&#x27;s time, and all of them used such languages in at least some contexts. Luc van Durme summarizes competing evidence of Celtic and Germanic influence at the time of Caesar by saying that &quot;one has to accept the rather remarkable conclusion that Caesar must have witnessed a situation opposing Celtic and Germanic in Belgium, in a territory slightly more to the south than the early medieval Romance-Germanic language border&quot;, but van Durme accepts that Germanic did not block &quot;Celticisation coming from the south&quot; so &quot;both phenomena were simultaneous and interfering&quot;.

The medieval &quot;Gesta Treverorum&quot; compiled by monks of Trier claims that the Belgae were descendants of Trebeta, an otherwise unattested legendary founder of Trier, the Roman &quot;Augusta Treverorum&quot;, &quot;Augusta of the Treveri&quot;.

==Tribes of the Belgae==
Caesar names the following as Belgic tribes, which can be related to later Roman provinces:
Later, Tacitus mentioned a tribe called the Tungri living where the &quot;Germani cisrhenani&quot; had lived, and he also stated that they had once been called the Germani (although Caesar had claimed to have wiped out the name of the main tribe, the Eburones). Other tribes that may have been included among the Belgae in some contexts were the Leuci, Treveri and Mediomatrici. Posidonius includes the Armoricani, as well.

==Conquest of the Belgae==
Caesar conquered the Belgae, beginning in 57 BC. He writes that the Belgae were conspiring and arming themselves in response to his earlier conquests; to counter this threat, he raised two new legions and ordered his Gallic allies, the Aedui, to invade the territory of the Bellovaci, the largest and fiercest of the Belgae tribes. Wary of the numbers and bravery of the Belgae, Caesar initially avoided a pitched battle, resorting mainly to cavalry skirmishes to probe their strengths and weaknesses. Once he was satisfied his troops were a match for them, he made camp on a low hill protected by a marsh at the front and the river Aisne behind, near Bibrax (between modern Laon and Reims) in the territory of the Remi.

The Belgae attacked over the river, but were repulsed after a fierce battle. Realising they could not dislodge the Romans and aware of the approach of the Aedui into the lands of the Bellovaci, the Belgae decided to disband their combined force and return to their own lands. Caesar&#x27;s informants advised him that whichever tribe Caesar attacked first, the others would come to their defence. They broke camp shortly before midnight. At daybreak, satisfied the retreat was not a trap, Caesar sent cavalry to harass the rear guard, followed by three legions. Many of the Belgae were killed in battle.

Caesar next marched into the territory of the Suessiones and besieged the town of Noviodunum (Soissons). Seeing the Romans&#x27; siege engines, the Suessiones surrendered, whereupon Caesar turned his attention to the Bellovaci, who had retreated into the fortress of Bratuspantium (between modern Amiens and Beauvais). They quickly surrendered, as did the Ambiani.

The Nervii, along with the Atrebates and Viromandui, decided to fight (the Atuatuci had also agreed to join them, but had not yet arrived). They concealed themselves in the forests and attacked the approaching Roman column at the river Sabis (previously thought to be the Sambre, but recently the Selle is thought to be more probable). Their attack was quick and unexpected. The element of surprise briefly left the Romans exposed. Some of the Romans did not have time to take the covers off their shields or to even put on their helmets. However, Caesar grabbed a shield, made his way to the front line, and quickly organised his forces. The two Roman legions guarding the baggage train at the rear finally arrived and helped to turn the tide of the battle. Caesar says the Nervii were almost annihilated in the battle, and is effusive in his tribute to their bravery, calling them &quot;heroes&quot; (for more details see Battle of the Sabis).

The Atuatuci, who were marching to their aid, turned back on hearing of the defeat and retreated to one stronghold, were put under siege, and soon surrendered and handed over their arms. However, the surrender was a ploy, and the Atuatuci, armed with weapons they had hidden, tried to break out during the night. The Romans had the advantage of position and killed 4,000. The rest, about 53,000, were sold into slavery.

In 53 BC, the Eburones, led by Ambiorix, along with the Nervii, Menapii and Morini, revolted again and wiped out fifteen cohorts, only to be put down by Caesar. The Belgae fought in the uprising of Vercingetorix in 52 BC.

After their final subjugation, Caesar combined the three parts of Gaul, the territory of the Belgae, Celtae and Aquitani, into a single unwieldy province (&quot;Gallia Comata&quot;, &quot;long-haired Gaul&quot;) that was reorganized by the emperor Augustus into its traditional cultural divisions. The province of Gallia Belgica was bounded on its east by the Rhine and extended all the way from the North Sea to Lake Constance (&quot;Lacus Brigantinus&quot;), including parts of what is now western Switzerland, with its capital at the city of the Remi (Reims). Under Diocletian, &quot;Belgica Prima&quot; (capital Augusta Trevirorum, Trier) and &quot;Belgica Secunda&quot; (capital Reims) formed part of the diocese of Gaul.

==Belgae outside Gaul==
===Great Britain===
The Belgae had made their way across the English Channel into southern Britain in Caesar&#x27;s time. Caesar asserts they had first crossed the channel as raiders, only later establishing themselves on the island. The precise extent of their conquests is unknown. After the Roman conquest of Great Britain, the civitas of the Belgae was bordered to the north by the British Atrebates, who were also a Belgic tribe, and to the east by the Regni, who were probably linked to the Belgae as well. The arrival and spread of Aylesford-Swarling pottery across the southeastern corner of Britain has been related to the Belgic invasion since Arthur Evans published his excavation of Aylesford in 1890, which was then thought to show &quot;the demonstrable reality of a Belgic invasion&quot;, according to Sir Barry Cunliffe, although more recent studies tend to downplay the role of migration in favour of increasing trade links; the question remains unclear.

A large number of coins of the Ambiani dating to the mid-second century BC have been found in southern Britain and the remains of a possible Belgic fort have been unearthed in Kent. Within memory of Caesar&#x27;s time, a king of the Suessiones (also referred to as Suaeuconi) called Diviciacus was not only the most powerful king of Belgic Gaul, but also ruled territory in Britain. Commius of the Atrebates, Caesar&#x27;s former ally, fled to Britain after participating in Vercingetorix&#x27;s rebellion and either joined or established a British branch of his tribe. Based on the development of imagery on coins, by the time of the Roman conquest, some of the tribes of south-eastern Britain likely were ruled by a Belgic nobility and were culturally influenced by them. The later &quot;civitas&quot; (administrative division) of Roman Britain had towns including &quot;Portus Adurni&quot; (Portchester) and &quot;Clausentum&quot; (Southampton). The &quot;civitas&quot; capital was at &quot;Venta Belgarum&quot; (Winchester), which was built on top of an Iron Age &quot;oppidum&quot; (this was itself built on the site of two earlier abandoned hillforts); Winchester remains Hampshire&#x27;s county town to this day. In addition to Venta Belgarum, the ancient geographer Ptolemy lists &quot;Aquae Calidae&quot; (Bath) and &quot;Iscalis&quot; as &quot;poleis&quot; of the Belgae.

===Ireland===
In his theory of Ireland&#x27;s prehistory, T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly suggested in 1946 that a branch of the Belgae settled in Ireland around the 5th century BC, later becoming the historical Iverni (Érainn) and their offshoots. He believes the memory of Belgae settlers was preserved in medieval Irish legend as the Fir Bolg. O&#x27;Rahilly&#x27;s theory has been challenged by historians and archaeologists, and is no longer accepted.

Fintan O&#x27;Toole suggested the Keshcarrigan Bowl is evidence for the movement of people into Ireland following upheaval and displacement, triggered by the Belgae arriving into Britain as refugees.

<text>Saltcoats (; Scots: &quot;Saulcuts&quot;) is a town on the west coast of North Ayrshire, Scotland. The name is derived from the town&#x27;s earliest industry when salt was harvested from the sea water of the Firth of Clyde, carried out in small cottages along the shore. It is part of the &#x27;Three Towns&#x27; conurbation along with Ardrossan and Stevenston and is the third largest town in North Ayrshire.

==History==
===Origins, 1200s===
The history of Saltcoats can be traced back to when the monks of Kilwinning Abbey discovered easily accessible coastal coal seams at Saltcoats in the 1200s, it expanded from small scattering of buildings. The coal proved an efficient source of heat for evaporating saltwater for the manufacturing of salt, and by the 1500s, King James V-funded sheds along the shoreline, leading to a successful salt pans industry. This sector of the economy is where Saltcoats gets its name.

===Burgh status, 1528===

In 1528, Saltcoats was granted status as a burgh leading to the creation of a market. By the middle of the 1600s, Saltcoats&#x27; primary sources of income were the import of corn and butter, as well as the sale of cattle and fish (mostly herring) to Ireland. Local farmers produced cheese, butter, wheat, oats, and potatoes. Cottage labourers in the town were given access to hand looms so they could weave muslins for the Glasgow and Paisley markets. On the outskirts of the town, chemical operations that produce magnesium and Epsom salts ran on waste materials from the salt-panning business.

In the late 18th century, several shipyards operated at Saltcoats, producing some 60 to 70 ships. The leading shipbuilder was William Ritchie, but in 1790 he moved his business to Belfast. In 1793, it was recorded that Saltcoats had around 400 houses, with 3 operational shipyards remaining. By 1820, this had climbed to 600 houses, with a population of 3,413 being noted.

===Recent history===

By the early 19th century, the town had stopped producing ships. Saltcoats Town Hall, which dates back to 1826, is a Category B listed building.

Saltcoats had various amenities, lodging, and entertainment required to develop into a prosperous seaside resort as a result of the vast, protected bay known as &quot;South Beach&quot; between Saltcoats and Ardrossan and a Beach Pavilion built in the 1920s. Its importance as a holiday destination declined with the onset of cheap air travel and mass summer migrations to the Mediterranean.

==Governance==
Saltcoats is part of the North Ayrshire and Arran constituency in the House of Commons. From 2005, the seat was represented by Scottish Labour however, more recently in 2015, the seat was won by Patricia Gibson of the Scottish National Party. She was returned in 2017 albeit a smaller majority, but in 2019 her majority increased.

Historically, Saltcoats has been part of the UK parliament constituencies North Ayrshire (1868–1918), Bute and Northern Ayrshire (1918–1983) and Cunninghame North (1983–2005). These constituencies historically returned Conservative or Unionist MPs until 1987, when the constituency was won by the Labour Party. 

For the devolved Scottish Parliament, the town is a part of the Cunninghame North constituency. This seat has been represented by Kenneth Gibson since the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, where it was the seat with the smallest majority at only 48 votes. It was previously represented by Scottish Labour since its creation in 1999.

==Transport==
The harbour was designed by James Jardine in 1811, however no cargo or passenger services run from the harbour any more.

Saltcoats is served by regular bus and railway services. Primary bus services are provided by Stagecoach West Scotland, while rail services are operated by ScotRail. These rail services are frequent and serve nearby Glasgow, as well as Largs, Ardrossan and Kilwinning.

Although Saltcoats currently only has a single railway station, the town was once served by a second railway station located in the north of the town, originally as part of the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway. This station ceased regular passenger services on 4 July 1932, and there is no trace of the station today bar a nearby bridge.

<doc id="506330" wikidata="Q4636407" url="?curid=506330" title="3SUM">
<text>In computational complexity theory, the 3SUM problem asks if a given set of formula_1 real numbers contains three elements that sum to zero. A generalized version, &quot;k&quot;-SUM, asks the same question on &quot;k&quot; elements, rather than simply 3. 3SUM can be easily solved in formula_2 time, and matching formula_3 lower bounds are known in some specialized models of computation .

It was conjectured that any deterministic algorithm for the 3SUM requires formula_4 time.
In 2014, the original 3SUM conjecture was refuted by Allan Grønlund and Seth Pettie who gave a deterministic algorithm that solves 3SUM in formula_5 time.
Additionally, Grønlund and Pettie showed that the 4-linear decision tree complexity of 3SUM is formula_6.
These bounds were subsequently improved.
The current best known algorithm for 3SUM runs in formula_7 time.
Kane, Lovett, and Moran showed that the 6-linear decision tree complexity of 3SUM is formula_8. The latter bound is tight (up to a logarithmic factor). 
It is still conjectured that 3SUM is unsolvable in formula_9 expected time.

When the elements are integers in the range formula_10, 3SUM can be solved in formula_11 time by representing the input set formula_12 as a bit vector, computing the set formula_13 of all pairwise sums as a discrete convolution using the fast Fourier transform, and finally comparing this set to formula_12.

== Quadratic algorithm ==
Suppose the input array is formula_15. In integer (word RAM) models of computing, 3SUM can be solved in formula_2 time on average by inserting each number formula_17 into a hash table, and then, for each index formula_18 and formula_19, checking whether the hash table contains the integer formula_20.

It is also possible to solve the problem in the same time in a comparison-based model of computing or real RAM, for which hashing is not allowed. The algorithm below first sorts the input array and then tests all possible pairs in a careful order that avoids the need to binary search for the pairs in the sorted list, achieving worst-case formula_2 time, as follows.
 sort(S);
 for i = 0 to n - 2 do
 a = S[i];
 start = i + 1;
 end = n - 1;
 while (start &lt; end) do
 b = S[start]
 c = S[end];
 if (a + b + c == 0) then
 output a, b, c;
 // Continue search for all triplet combinations summing to zero.
 // We need to update both end and start together since the array values are distinct.
 start = start + 1;
 end = end - 1;
 else if (a + b + c &gt; 0) then
 end = end - 1;
 else
 start = start + 1;
 end
 end

The following example shows this algorithm&#x27;s execution on a small sorted array. Current values of a are shown in red, values of b and c are shown in magenta.
 -25 -10 -7 -3 2 4 8 10 (a+b+c==-25)
 -25 -10 -7 -3 2 4 8 10 (a+b+c==-22)
 -25 -10 -7 -3 2 4 8 10 (a+b+c==-7)
 -25 -10 -7 -3 2 4 8 10 (a+b+c==-7)
 -25 -10 -7 -3 2 4 8 10 (a+b+c==-3)
 -25 -10 -7 -3 2 4 8 10 (a+b+c==2)
 -25 -10 -7 -3 2 4 8 10 (a+b+c==0)

The correctness of the algorithm can be seen as follows. Suppose we have a solution a + b + c = 0. Since the pointers only move in one direction, we can run the algorithm until the leftmost pointer points to a. Run the algorithm until either one of the remaining pointers points to b or c, whichever occurs first. Then the algorithm will run until the last pointer points to the remaining term, giving the affirmative solution.

== Variants ==

=== Non-zero sum ===
Instead of looking for numbers whose sum is 0, it is possible to look for numbers whose sum is any constant &quot;C&quot;. The simplest way would be to modify the original algorithm to search the hash table for the integer .

Another method:
* Subtract &quot;C&quot;/3 from all elements of the input array.
* In the modified array, find 3 elements whose sum is 0.

For example, if A=[1,2,3,4] and if you are asked to find 3SUM for &quot;C&quot;=4, then subtract 4/3 from all the elements of A, and solve it in the usual 3sum way, i.e., .

=== Three different arrays ===
Instead of searching for the 3 numbers in a single array, we can search for them in 3 different arrays. I.e., given three arrays X, Y and Z, find three numbers , such that . Call the 1-array variant 3SUM×1 and the 3-array variant 3SUM×3.

Given a solver for 3SUM×1, the 3SUM×3 problem can be solved in the following way (assuming all elements are integers): 
* For every element in &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot;, set: , , .
* Let &quot;S&quot; be a concatenation of the arrays &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot;.
* Use the 3SUM×1 oracle to find three elements such that .
* Return . 
By the way we transformed the arrays, it is guaranteed that .

=== Convolution sum ===
Instead of looking for arbitrary elements of the array such that:
:formula_22
the &quot;convolution 3sum&quot; problem (Conv3SUM) looks for elements in specific locations:
:formula_23

==== Reduction from Conv3SUM to 3SUM ====
Given a solver for 3SUM, the Conv3SUM problem can be solved in the following way.
* Define a new array &quot;T&quot;, such that for every index &quot;i&quot;: formula_24 (where &quot;n&quot; is the number of elements in the array, and the indices run from 0 to &quot;n&quot;-1).
* Solve 3SUM on the array &quot;T&quot;.

Correctness proof:
* If in the original array there is a triple with formula_23, then formula_26, so this solution will be found by 3SUM on &quot;T&quot;.
* Conversely, if in the new array there is a triple with formula_27, then formula_28. Because formula_29, necessarily formula_30 and formula_31, so this is a valid solution for Conv3SUM on &quot;S&quot;.

==== Reduction from 3SUM to Conv3SUM ====
Given a solver for Conv3SUM, the 3SUM problem can be solved in the following way.

The reduction uses a hash function. As a first approximation, assume that we have a linear hash function, i.e. a function &quot;h&quot; such that:
:formula_32
Suppose that all elements are integers in the range: 0...&quot;N&quot;-1, and that the function &quot;h&quot; maps each element to an element in the smaller range of indices: 0...&quot;n&quot;-1. Create a new array &quot;T&quot; and send each element of &quot;S&quot; to its hash value in &quot;T&quot;, i.e., for every &quot;x&quot; in &quot;S&quot;():
:formula_33
Initially, suppose that the mappings are unique (i.e. each cell in &quot;T&quot; accepts only a single element from &quot;S&quot;). Solve Conv3SUM on &quot;T&quot;. Now:
* If there is a solution for 3SUM: formula_34, then: formula_35 and formula_36, so this solution will be found by the Conv3SUM solver on &quot;T&quot;.
* Conversely, if a Conv3SUM is found on &quot;T&quot;, then obviously it corresponds to a 3SUM solution on &quot;S&quot; since &quot;T&quot; is just a permutation of &quot;S&quot;.

This idealized solution doesn&#x27;t work, because any hash function might map several distinct elements of &quot;S&quot; to the same cell of &quot;T&quot;. The trick is to create an array by selecting a single random element from each cell of &quot;T&quot;, and run Conv3SUM on . If a solution is found, then it is a correct solution for 3SUM on &quot;S&quot;. If no solution is found, then create a different random and try again. Suppose there are at most &quot;R&quot; elements in each cell of &quot;T&quot;. Then the probability of finding a solution (if a solution exists) is the probability that the random selection will select the correct element from each cell, which is formula_37. By running Conv3SUM formula_38 times, the solution will be found with a high probability.

Unfortunately, we do not have linear perfect hashing, so we have to use an almost linear hash function, i.e. a function &quot;h&quot; such that:
:formula_32 or
:formula_40
This requires to duplicate the elements of &quot;S&quot; when copying them into &quot;T&quot;, i.e., put every element formula_41 both in formula_42 (as before) and in formula_43. So each cell will have 2&quot;R&quot; elements, and we will have to run Conv3SUM formula_44 times.

== 3SUM-hardness ==
A problem is called 3SUM-hard if solving it in subquadratic time implies a subquadratic-time algorithm for 3SUM. The concept of 3SUM-hardness was introduced by . They proved that a large class of problems in computational geometry are 3SUM-hard, including the following ones. (The authors acknowledge that many of these problems are contributed by other researchers.)

* Given a set of lines in the plane, are there three that meet in a point?
* Given a set of non-intersecting axis-parallel line segments, is there a line that separates them into two non-empty subsets?
* Given a set of infinite strips in the plane, do they fully cover a given rectangle?
* Given a set of triangles in the plane, compute their measure.
* Given a set of triangles in the plane, does their union have a hole?
* A number of visibility and motion planning problems, e.g.,
** Given a set of horizontal triangles in space, can a particular triangle be seen from a particular point?
** Given a set of non-intersecting axis-parallel line segment obstacles in the plane, can a given rod be moved by translations and rotations between a start and finish positions without colliding with the obstacles?

By now there are a multitude of other problems that fall into this category. An example is the decision version of X + Y sorting: given sets of numbers and of elements each, are there distinct for ?

<text>The Ford Transit is a family of light commercial vehicles manufactured by the Ford Motor Company since 1965, primarily as a cargo van, but also available in other configurations including a large passenger van (marketed as the Ford Tourneo in some markets since 1995), cutaway van chassis, and a pickup truck. The vehicle is also known as the Ford T-Series (T-150, T-250, T-350), a nomenclature shared with Ford&#x27;s other light commercial vehicles, the Ford F-Series trucks, and the Ford E-Series chassis. , 8 million Transit vans have been sold, making it the third best-selling van of all time and has been produced across four basic platform generations (debuting in 1965, 1986, 2000, and 2013 respectively), with various &quot;facelift&quot; versions of each.

The first product of the merged Ford of Europe, the Transit was originally marketed in Western Europe and Australia. By the end of the twentieth century, it was marketed nearly globally with the exception of North America until 2015 when it replaced the Ford E-Series van. Upon its introduction in North America, the Transit quickly became the best-selling van of any type in the United States, minivan sales included.

That mirrors the success the Transit has achieved in Europe, where it has been the best-selling light commercial vehicle for forty years, and in some countries the term &quot;Transit&quot; has passed into common usage as a generic trademark applying to any light commercial van in the Transit&#x27;s size bracket.


== Taunus Transit (1953) ==

Predecessor of the British and German-built Transit, the first production Ford to wear the &quot;Transit&quot; badge was a van built in Ford&#x27;s Cologne plant in Germany. It was introduced in 1953 as FK 1000 (carrying 1,000 kg) with the 1.2-litre Ford sidevalve engine from the contemporary Taunus. In 1955 the engine capacity was enlarged to 1.5 litres. From 1961, this vehicle was called the Ford Taunus Transit. Production of this model ceased in 1965.

=== Brief historical view ===

On May 9, 1945, the day after the unconditional surrender of the German Wehrmacht in the Second World War, production at Ford Germany in Cologne resumed. Because the production of civilian cars in the British occupied zone was restricted, Ford-Werke AG was limited to the production of trucks until 1948. Those trucks based on the slightly modified war models V 3000 S, B 3000 S and V 3000 A as they were already produced before and during the Second World War in the Ford production facilities in the Third Reich. Those trucks were now called &quot;Rhein&quot; (V8-engined) and &quot;Ruhr&quot; (four-cylinder).

At that time neither Ford of Britain nor Ford Werke AG were 100% subsidiaries of Ford Motor Company in Detroit; before the Second World War each company had its own more or less protected market. After the war, several economical boundaries were abolished and local markets did not exist anymore in the same way that they existed before. With this, Ford of Britain and Ford-Werke AG suddenly became more competitive on the whole European Continent than local market subsidiaries of their parent company in Detroit.

Production of light commercial vehicles began in late 1948, when 148 half-ton delivery vehicles were built. In 1951 Ford Werke AG launched the commercial vehicle series FK, standing for Ford Köln, with different-sized vehicles (FK2000 with 2 tons payload, FK3000 with 3 tons payload, FK3500 with 3.5 tons payload, etc.). The FK series was successor of the &quot;Rhein&quot; and &quot;Ruhr&quot; trucks. In 1953, the FK series were rounded off with the light delivery van FK1000/FK1250 (1ton/1.25tons payload), in competition to the Volkswagen Type 2 VW Bus, the DKW Type F89L &quot;Schnellaster&quot; or the Tempo Matador.

As usual in the Anglo-Saxon countries in those days, Ford&#x27;s marketing experts attached more importance to the model/series designation than to the &quot;Ford&quot; label as a brand. Most British Ford products carried no Ford emblem. The commercial vehicles produced at Ford-Werke AG were marketed with the FK logo, while the passenger cars produced from 1948 onwards were offered under the name Taunus referring to the re-produced pre-war model Ford Taunus G93A.

Due to continental European habits, the original series and model designations &quot;FK&quot; and Taunus mutated into real brands, each with its own emblem and different models, comparable with Daimler Benz Mercedes models or General Motors Opel models. The FK emblem consists of two slightly overlapping ovals with the &quot;F&quot; from the well-known Ford emblem in the first and a &quot;K&quot; in the same font in the second oval. The Taunus emblem first depicted the Cologne Cathedral; from 1953 on until its discontinuation in 1967, Cologne&#x27;s city flag inspired the Taunus emblem.

In 1961, Ford discontinued the entire truck production in Germany and took the FK brand off the market, due to serious defects and therefore strongly decreasing demand. The unrelated FK1000/FK1250 van, unaffected by these defects, continued to sell well and was now offered under the successful Taunus brand with the model name Transit in addition to the cars Taunus 12M/15M and the Taunus 17M. A comparable program to Volkswagen, that offered its vehicles VW Beetle, VW 1500 and VW Bus the same way on the continental European market. The &quot;new&quot; Transit Taunus van was now labelled with the Transit model name (instead of the FK logo) in big chrome letters and a big &quot;Taunus&quot; emblem as well as a small Taunus lettering which was also mounted on the back of the vehicle. New, however, was a small Ford logo underneath the right B-pillar.

From 1957 onwards, with the launch of the Ford Thames 400E by Ford of Britain, the situation arose that Ford, together with the FK1000/FK1250 by Ford Werke AG, was now present on the continental European markets with two competing products. For example, the British Ford Thames 400E was also assembled and improved as a left-hand drive version in the Ford assembly plants in Copenhagen, Denmark, as well as the German FK1000 was assembled in Azambuja, Portugal, too. In the French, Spanish, Italian, Swiss, Benelux and Scandinavian markets, both products were found. This turned out to be disadvantageous and cost-intensive especially after the fall of various trade barriers within the newly founded EEC.

For this reason, such a situation with internal competition and parallel developments was very unsatisfactory for the Ford headquarters in Detroit. The aim was to not only standardize the vehicle production (world car), but also merge the company structures in Europe.
Under parent&#x27;s dictate, Ford of Britain and Ford-Werke AG started the &quot;Redcap-Project&quot; in the commercial vehicle sector in 1963, from which the Ford Transit was launched in 1965, based on a new unified platform.

Two years later in 1967, Ford of Britain and Ford-Werke AG merged to Ford of Europe with the headquarters in Cologne, Germany. The brand Taunus was taken off the market. Ford forced the standardization of platforms and even model-names overall European market under the Ford brand and logo. After the Ford Transit in 1965, a second unified platform (Ford Escort) was launched in 1967. With the discontinuation of the Ford Zephyr (British) and Ford P7 (German) in 1972 all Ford platforms for the European market are unified. Since 1994 (discontinuation of the Ford Granada name) even the Ford model-names are the same for the European market.

=== Naming system ===
The German vehicle was not widely exported, and the &quot;Mark 1&quot; tag has commonly been applied, retrospectively, to the 1965 to 1978 pan-European model (see below). Whilst there have only been four basic platforms since 1965, the various facelifts and upgrades over the years have been referred to using a conflicting range of &quot;Mark&quot; numbers, with some sources counting a facelift as a new &quot;Mark&quot;, some not. Ford&#x27;s own historical look back at Transit production, published for the launch of the 1994 model, avoids the issue by referring to generations of Transit by years produced. This article attempts to make mention of all the common naming systems.
== First generation (1965) ==


The first generation Transit, or the Transit Mark I in the United Kingdom, was introduced in October 1965, taking over directly from the Thames 400E. This generation had the longest production run of any Transit to date, staying largely unaltered for 12 years until the major update of 1977, with only one minor facelift for the 1971 model year, which saw updated front end styling on the V4 engined models (the &#x27;pig snout&#x27; diesel/V6 models remained unchanged), and the introduction of a safety padded dashboard.

Overall production of this platform therefore lasted for over 20 years before finally being replaced by the all-new VE6 platform in 1986.

The van was produced initially at Ford&#x27;s Langley facility in Berkshire, England (a former Second World War aircraft factory which had produced Hawker Hurricane fighters), but demand outstripped the capability of the plant, and production was moved to Southampton until closure in 2013 in favour of the factory at İzmit, Turkey.

Transits were also produced in Ford&#x27;s Genk factory in Belgium and also Turkey. Transits were produced in Amsterdam for the local market from the mid-1970s until the end of 1981. This factory had ample capacity, since the Ford Transcontinental produced there had little success (total production 8000 in 6 years). Although the Transit sold well in the Netherlands, it was not enough to save the factory, which closed in December 1981.

The Transit was introduced to replace the Ford Thames 400E, a small mid-engined forward control van noted for its narrow track which was in competition with similar-looking but larger vehicles from the BMC J4 and J2 vans and Rootes Group&#x27;s Commer PB ranges. In a UK market segment then dominated by the Bedford CA, Ford&#x27;s Thames competitor, because of its restricted load area, failed to attract fleet users in sufficient numbers. Ford switched to a front-engined configuration, as did Bedford with their well-regarded CA series vans in the 1950s. Henry Ford II&#x27;s revolutionary step was to combine the engineering efforts of Ford of Britain and Ford of Germany to create a prototype for the Ford of Europe of today—previously the two subsidiaries had avoided competing in one another&#x27;s domestic markets but had been direct competitors in other European markets.

The Transit was a departure from the European commercial vehicles of the day with its American-inspired styling—its broad track gave it a huge advantage in carrying capacity over comparable vehicles of the day. Most of the Transit&#x27;s mechanical components were adapted from Ford&#x27;s car range of the time. Another key to the Transit&#x27;s success was the sheer number of different body styles: panel vans in long and short wheelbase forms, pick-up truck, minibuses, crew-cabs to name but a few.

The engines used in the UK were the Essex V4 for the petrol-engined version in 1.7 L and 2.0 L capacities. By using relatively short V-4 engines Ford were able to minimise the additional length necessitated to place the engine ahead of the driver. Another popular development under the bonnet was the equipping of the van with an alternator at time when the UK market competitors expected buyers to be content with a dynamo. A diesel engine sourced from Perkins was also offered. As this engine was too long to fit under the Transit&#x27;s stubby nose, the diesel version featured a longer bonnet - which became nicknamed as the &quot;pig snout&quot;. The underpowered Perkins proved unpopular, and was replaced by Ford&#x27;s own York unit in 1972. For mainland Europe the Transit had the German Ford Taunus V4 engine in Cologne 1.3, 1.5, and 1.7- or Essex 2.0-litre versions. The diesel version&#x27;s long nose front was also used to accommodate the Ford 3.0 L Ford Essex V6 engine (UK) for high performance applications such as vans supplied to police and ambulance services. In Australia, in 1973, to supplement the two Essex V4 engines that were available the Transit was released with the long-nose diesel front used to accommodate an inline 6-cylinder engine derived from the Ford Falcon.

The Metropolitan Police reported on this vehicle in 1972 via a Scotland Yard spokesman that &quot;Ford Transits are used in 95 per cent of bank raids. With the performance of a car, and space for 1.75 tonnes of loot, the Transit is proving to be the perfect getaway vehicle&quot;, describing it as &quot;Britain&#x27;s most wanted van&quot;.

The adoption of a front beam axle in place of a system incorporating independent front suspension that had featured on its UK predecessor might have been seen as a backward step by some, but on the road commentators felt that the Transit&#x27;s wider track and longer wheelbase more than compensated for the apparent step backwards represented by Ford&#x27;s suspension choices. Drivers appreciated the elimination of the excessive noise, smell and cabin heat that resulted from placing the driver above or adjacent to the engine compartment in the Thames 400E and other forward control light vans of the 1950s and early 1960s.

The Transit was also assembled in South Africa between 1967 and 1974, the last Transit to be sold in that country until 2013, when a fully imported model was introduced.
=== Facelift (1977) ===

In August 1977, a facelifted version—codenamed within Ford as the &quot;Transit &quot;—but usually referred to as the Transit Mark II, debuted with a restyled, longer nose section which could now properly accommodate an in-line engine in place of the Essex and Cologne V4s - therefore the Pinto engine from the Cortina became the Transit&#x27;s dominant power unit. The new frontal styling brought the Transit back into line with the rest of Ford of Europe&#x27;s passenger car range of the period with square headlamps and the black louvred grille, although the rear styling remained unaltered. The austere dashboard of the Mk1 with its single instrument binnacle was replaced with a full width plastic fascia with a more comprehensive instrument cluster and switchgear taken from the Taunus/Cortina Mk4. Many fleet owners experienced premature camshaft wear in early Pinto units in the Cortina and for two years the Transit 75 was available with the 1.6 L Ford Kent cross-flow engine. High-performance versions intended for police or ambulance service used the 3.0 L V6 version of the Essex engine; the 3.0 was also available in some heavier duty models like the 3.5-tonne Transit 190. From September 1978, Australian variants could be had with locally built 4.1 L (250 cu in) inline 6-cylinder engines.

In 1984, the York diesel engine was redesigned into the 2.5 L &quot;DI&quot; (direct injection) unit. At this time this generation received a minor facelift including a grey plastic front grille with integrated headlamp surrounds, wraparound indicators, longer bumper end caps and multifunction rear lights incorporating fog, indicator, reversing and side lights for the panel van. This facelift did not commonly result in a new &quot;Mark&quot; number.

The Mark II was available in 6 body styles: Van, Kombi, Chassis Cab, Parcel Van, Bus, and Crewbus all available in short-wheelbase (2690 mm) and long-wheelbase (3000 mm) versions. A selection of 5 engines was available: 1.6-litre OHC Petrol, 1.6-litre OHV Petrol (Kent), 2.0-litre OHC Petrol, 2.0-litre OHC Petrol (Economy) and 2.4-litre Diesel. On top of this were 32 door combinations, 6 axle ratios and options for 12 – 17 interior seats. All of these were available in any combination when purchased with Ford&#x27;s highly customizable custom plan. At the time this gave the business sector an unprecedented amount of flexibility, which was a major factor in the vehicles&#x27; ultimate success.

In 1981, for mainland European market only, the Transit Clubmobil was introduced by the Hymer company. This was fitted with a 1.6 / 2.0 OHC engine, and featured a custom interior – captain style swivel seats in velour, pile carpet, motorsport steering wheel, unique Ronal 14&quot; alloy wheels, unique side windows, folding back seat, luggage box, unique front spoiler, tinted glass, power assisted steering, spare wheel carrier and rear door ladder. In 3 years of production 150 were produced and less than 20 are thought to still exist.

In late 1982, the well-equipped Transit Ghia was introduced to some markets, only as a nine-seater bus. This offered a velour interior, full carpeting, tinted windows, and sunroof. Externally it can be identified by chrome dog-dish hubcaps and extra lamps in the grille.

In 1982, a four-wheel drive version was added to the German market, called the SIRA-Ford Transit. This was developed together with Rau GmbH, a Ford dealer in Stuttgart. &quot;SIRA&quot; combines &quot;Sinpar&quot; and &quot;Rau&quot; because Rau was the agent for French four-wheel-drive specialist Sinpar in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The SIRA Transit used a Sinpar transfer case and other parts, and was available with the 2-liter petrol four or the 2.4-liter Diesel, on either wheelbase. The 4x4 Transit was later offered in other markets as well.
== Second generation (1986) ==

Codenamed &quot;VE6&quot;, the second generation Transit platform appeared in January 1986 and was notable for its all-new bodyshell which was of &quot;one-box&quot; design (&quot;i.e.&quot; the windscreen and bonnet are at close to the same angle), and the front suspension was changed to a fully independent configuration on SWB versions. Initially fitted with Chubb AVA locks, Tibbe barrels were fitted soon after. The engine range was carried over largely unchanged from the last of the 1978–1985 Mk.1 facelift model, although in 1989 the high-performance 3.0 Essex V6 petrol was replaced by the Cologne 2.9 EFI V6, mainly because of emissions regulations as the Essex V6 design was nearly 25 years old by then and still used a carburettor. The third generation Transit was developed under the &quot;Triton&quot; code name.

=== Facelift (1992) ===
A subtle facelift in 1992 saw the fully independent front suspension adopted across the range, whilst a redesigned floor plan allowed the use of single, rather than paired, rear wheels on the LWB derivative, further increasing payload—these models are identifiable by the slightly more rounded front headlamps. In Australia, the third generation Transit did not go on sale until March 1994, after a 13-year absence from that market.

=== Facelift (1994) ===

A major facelift to the Transit in 1994 gave the Transit a new nose and dashboard, along with the 2.0 L DOHC 8-valve engine as found in the 1994 to 1998 Ford Scorpio. It is similar to the earlier Sierra DOHC unit but without the distributor and uses the updated OBD II-compliant EEC-V level engine control unit. At the same time air conditioning, electric windows, central locking, electric mirrors and airbags were all made available as optional extras.

In 1994, a campervan conversion produced by Auto-Sleepers converted in Willersey, Gloucestershire, known as the Auto-Sleepers Duetto was available. It was available with the high-top roof.

The naturally aspirated diesel engines came in and variants.The turbo diesel version came in or variants, and in 1998 a intercooled version became available; all turbodiesels had an electronic fuel injection pump made by Lucas.

For the 30th anniversary of the Transit in 1995 Ford released a limited edition model called the Transit Hallmark. Six hundred were made and were available in three colours with 200 being made in each.

In Europe the VE83 Transit was available up to 2000, but in Vietnam it was built up to 2003 when it was exchanged in June for the new generation.
== Third generation (2000) ==
=== Pre-facelift (2000) ===
The Transit, introduced in July 2000, was the third all-new design, and borrowed styling cues from Ford&#x27;s &quot;New Edge&quot; designs, like the Focus and Ka. Developed by Ford in the United States, the main innovation is that it is available in either front- or rear-wheel drive. Ford nomenclature makes this the V184 (rear-wheel-drive) or V185 (front-wheel-drive) model. This model features the &quot;Puma&quot;-type Duratorq turbo diesel engine also used in the 2000 Mondeo and Jaguar X-Type, with the petrol versions moving up to the 2.3 L 16-Valve edition of the straight-4 engine.

A demonstration of this model&#x27;s speed with the smallest panel van body, rear wheel drive, highest output 136PS 2.4 Duratorq turbo-diesel engine and optional 6-speed manual gearbox was shown in series 6 of &quot;Top Gear&quot; in 2005, where German race driver Sabine Schmitz attempted to drive it around the Nürburgring in under ten minutes, matching Jeremy Clarkson&#x27;s time in a turbodiesel Jaguar S-Type; after weight reduction and aerodynamic modifications, she was only just unsuccessful, marking her fastest lap at 10m 8s.

This version won the International Van of the Year 2001.

The Durashift EST automatic transmission (optional on all rear-wheel-drive models) features controls mounted on the dashboard, a specially adapted manual mode, tow-haul mode, economy mode and winter mode. This is known as the ASM (automatically shifting manual) system in the Australian market.

2002 saw the introduction of the first High Pressure Common Rail diesel engine in the Transit, with the launch of the HPCR 2.0-litre in the FWD. Production of the van started at the new Ford-Otosan plant in Kocaeli, Turkey which saw the end of all production at the Genk, Belgium plant which had been producing Transits since 1965. This coincided with the introduction of the Transit Connect (also produced in Kocaeli), a smaller panel van based on the C170 (Focus) platform and aimed at replacing the older Escort and Fiesta based models. Despite the name, the Connect has no engineering commonality with the full-size Transit.

2003 saw a new instrument cluster with a digital odometer.

2004 saw the launch of the first RWD HPCR, the 2.4-litre variant that also introduced the 6-speed MT-82 RWD manual gearbox.

The five millionth Transit rolled off the Southampton line on Monday, July 18, 2005, and was donated to an English charity.

=== Facelift (2006) ===

The third-generation Transit received a facelift to the body, introduced in July 2006, including new front and rear lights, a new front end and a new interior featuring the gearstick on the dashboard and Ford&#x27;s new corporate radio design. Besides the styling changes, the powertrains were revised. The old petrol engine was replaced with one from the Ford Ranger, the front-wheel-drive diesel went from 2.0 to 2.2 litres capacity, and all diesel engines gained high-pressure common rail (TDCi) systems. The powertrains were changed to meet new emissions legislation. Additionally, the facelift introduced CAN bus electronics to the Transit for the first time. The new version (Ford nomenclature V347 for front-wheel drive and V348 for rear-wheel drive) won International Van of the Year for 2007 despite tough competition from several all-new rivals. This Transit arrived in Mexico to replace the Freestar after the 2007 model year. This was the first Transit with a five-cylinder engine available (in the 3.2L 200PS version).

Mid-2006 saw the launch of the &quot;Sport Van&quot;, a production van featuring the engine with additional styling parts, &quot;Le Mans&quot; stripes and 18-inch alloy wheels.

Late-2007 saw the launch of the engine for front-wheel-drives (replacing the 130 PS) complete with the VMT6 6-speed manual transaxle to cope with the extra power.

The 6-speed transaxle was introduced on the mid-power FWD in late 2008 when the engine was upped to .

In late 2008, the &quot;coated Diesel Particulate Filter&quot; (cDPF)—designed to meet higher emission standards than the current Euro IV requirement—was introduced as an option on all diesel engines. Production ended in 2013, with the Southampton plant closing down making this generation the last of the British built Transits, but returned in China in two modified forms.

== Fourth generation (2014) ==

The fourth-generation Transit was launched in January 2013 at the 2013 North American (Detroit) International Auto Show. In contrast to the previous generation developed in the United States (but never sold there), the fourth-generation Transit was co-designed by Ford of Europe and Ford in North America. After entering production for worldwide sale in 2013, the Transit entered sale in North America in 2014 as an early 2015 model.
The fourth-generation Transit was the first version to be offered for sale in the United States and Canada, replacing the E-Series passenger cargo and passenger van (the E-Series remains in production as a cutaway/chassis cab). While produced since 1965 (nearly as long as the Mustang), previous generations of the Transit were excluded from North America to avoid model overlap with the Econoline/E-Series.

The introduction of the fourth generation saw a transition of the Transit nameplate into a commercially oriented sub-brand of Ford. To supplement its namesake vehicle and the Transit Connect MPV, Ford spun off the previous front-wheel drive Transit into its own model line, the Transit Custom (sized between the Transit Connect and Transit), with the Fiesta-based Transit Courier introduced in 2014 as the smallest model of the product range. The namesake of the model line, the fourth-generation Transit is marketed against the Chevrolet Express/GMC Savana, Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, Fiat Ducato (and its variants), and the Volkswagen Crafter in markets worldwide. 

=== Chassis ===


The fourth-generation Transit is offered in a rear-wheel drive powertrain layout; the front-wheel drive version of the previous generation has been replaced by the Transit Custom. The Transit van is offered in two wheelbases (129.9 inches and 147.6 inches) while the chassis cab/cutaway van is offered in three wheelbases (138 inches, 155.7, and 178 inches). As with previous-generation vans, extended-wheelbase vans were produced with either single or dual rear-wheel axles.

In a major change from the E-Series, the Transit uses a unibody chassis design instead of a separate frame; while no longer using a separate chassis, the high use of boron steel allowed for increase in payload capacity of up to 600 pounds (over a similar-configuration E-Series). The long-running Twin I-Beams of the E-Series were retired, as the fourth-generation Transit uses MacPherson struts for the front suspension; the live rear axle is leaf-sprung. The model line is fitted with four-wheel disc brakes.

==== Powertrain ====
For its worldwide introduction in 2013, the fourth-generation Transit inherited the Duratorq diesel engines from the previous generation, shared with the Ranger and Mondeo. A 2.0L inline-four was introduced (for China), shared with the 2.2 and 2.4-litre inline-fours (the former, for Europe and Australia; the latter, Europe); the largest engine was a 3.2-liter inline-five (for markets outside South America). Gasoline engines were also offered, including a 2.0-liter EcoBoost inline-four (for China) and a 2.3-liter Duratec inline-four.

For production in the Americas, the Transit was offered with higher-displacement gasoline engines (shared with the F-Series). A 275 hp 3.7L V6 was the standard engine in North America, with a 310 hp 3.5L twin-turbo EcoBoost V6 offered in both North and South America; the 185 hp 3.2L inline-5 was offered beginning in 2015 (renamed as a Power Stroke diesel). From 2015 to 2019, all engines were paired to a 6-speed automatic transmission, replaced by a 10-speed automatic for 2020.

As an option through Ford, the 3.7L engine can be converted to run on compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied petroleum gas (propane).
===Body configuration===
In a design shift, the Transit (and Transit Custom) moved from the New Edge styling of the previous generation to the &quot;Kinetic&quot; design language; the interior was influenced by the third-generation Ford Focus. The fourth-generation Transit as both a van and as a chassis cab/cutaway cab; the pickup truck of the previous generation has been discontinued. The van is offered in three different roof lengths and three different roof heights.

In most worldwide markets, the Transit passenger van is primarily marketed under the Ford Tourneo name, with Ford using the Transit name for both cargo and passenger vans in the United States and Canada. In line with other Ford trucks in North America, the Transit is marketed in XL and XLT trims. In line with the F-Series trucks (and its E-Series predecessor), in North America, the Transit is marketed in 150/250/350 (and 350HD) payload series, determined by wheelbase, body length, and roof height.

As with the E-Series and the previous-generation Transit, the model line serves as the basis for multiple commercial vehicles, including ambulances, buses, and recreational vehicles.

===2020 update===
For 2020 production, the Ford Transit underwent a mid-cycle model revision, distinguished by an update of the front fascia and dashboard. In both Otosan and Claycomo-produced examples, the powertrain saw several updates. For North America, a naturally-aspirated 275 hp 3.5L V6 with port and direct injection replaced the 3.7L V6; the 3.5L twin-turbo V6 remained an option. For markets outside the Americas, the four Duratorq diesel engines were replaced by a single 2.0L EcoBlue inline-4 turbodiesel (shared with the Ranger outside of North America). Offered in multiple power outputs (105, 130, 170, 185 PS), the EcoBlue engine is also offered with a mild-hybrid option (with the 130 PS engine). Initially intended for North American sale (alongside the Transit Connect), the EcoBlue option was dropped shortly before its introduction.

All-wheel drive is again an option for the model line. A new trim level marketed as Transit Trail was also made available for the Transit and Transit Custom. It features a Quaife locking differential and design elements of the North-American market Ford F-150 Raptor. A crew van body style was introduced as a new option; known as a double cab in Europe, the design combines the design of a passenger and cargo van, offering 5-passenger seating and a large rear cargo space. The 2020 Transit also adopted power-sliding doors and dual sliding doors (for cargo vans) as options. 
=== E-Transit ===
In November 2020, Ford announced the 2022 E-Transit battery electric cargo van; key specifications include a / maximum cargo capacity, 68 kWh (usable capacity) battery and up to range, based on the U.S. EPA Multi-Cycle Test (MCT) procedure. The E-Transit began production at Ford&#x27;s Kansas City Assembly Plant in November 2021. The first E-Transits were delivered to American customers in February 2022; according to Ford, they had received more than 10,000 orders for the E-Transit from 300 commercial fleets. E-Transit production for the European market began at Otosan in April 2022 to fill orders totaling more than 5,000 vehicles.

The E-Transit has a unique chassis to accommodate the traction battery between the frame rails, but is fitted with the same bodies as the conventional Transit. Under the bonnet, Ford have fitted cooling pumps for the high-voltage traction battery and motor, along with cabin climate control equipment and other electrical gear, including the DC-DC converter. Externally, the E-Transit can be distinguished by its rear axle, which carries the traction motor and has an independent suspension using semi-trailing arms and coil springs, rather than the live axle and leaf springs of the conventional Transit.

The liquid-cooled traction battery is sourced from the Mustang Mach-E; usable capacity is 68 kW-hr with a gross capacity of 77 kW-hr. Maximum charging speeds are 11.3 kW (AC) or 115 kW (DC). The Combined Charging System vehicle inlet is on the front of the car, below the manufacturer&#x27;s emblem. The traction motor of the E-Transit is shared with the Ford F-150 Lightning, with a nominal output of and ; in the UK, it is offered with a choice of two traction motor outputs, ; both produce the same torque as the US model. Operating in Eco mode, power is limited to . The advertised maximum range of (EPA) is accomplished with the low-roof model. Under the WLTP cycle, maximum range is . When equipped with the Pro Power Onboard option, the E-Transit can supply up to 2.4 kW of electrical power for tools and accessories through conventional AC outlets.

There are 25 combinations of height (2 choices), wheelbase (3), and gross vehicle weight rating (3) in the UK. In the United States, purchasers are given a choice of three body lengths (Regular, Long, or Extended), two wheelbases (), three roof heights (Low, Medium, or High), and three chassis preparations (cargo van, cutaway, or chassis cab; the latter two are offered with a wheelbase only); all US versions are sold as a single T-350 model with a GVWR of .

&quot;What Car?&quot; named the E-Transit its Van of the Year in 2022.
=== Assembly ===
Worldwide production of the fourth-generation Transit is sourced from two Ford facilities. All Transit production for Europe and Asia is sourced from Ford Otosan in Kocaeli Province, Turkey; this factory provides a percentage of global exports. North American and South American production is primarily sourced from Kansas City Assembly in Claycomo, Missouri; production at the Kansas City Assembly Plant began on April 30, 2014.

In North America, the model line was launched as a 2015 model, adopting the Transit name for both cargo and passenger vans (rather than using the Tourneo name used in other markets for passenger vans).

=== Second generation Transit (1997–2016) ===
Introduced in 1997, the Ford Transit VJX6541DK-M is a license-built version of the Transit assembled by Jiangling Motors (JMC) in Nanchang. Produced solely for the Chinese domestic market, it was derived from the second-generation VE6/VE83/VE94 platform. Over its Ford predecessor produced from 1986 to 2000, JMC made 70 major updates to the design. The exterior was distinguished by revision to the front fascia, including larger front headlamps and a redesigned grille and front bumper. The interior saw several ergonomic improvements, along with the standardization of power windows. ABS was offered as an option. The top speed is specified at .

Sharing its underpinnings with the second-generation Transit, the JMC-built Transit differed substantially in its powertrain configuration. In place of Ford produced engines, the model line used a 92 kW Mitsubishi-produced 2.4 L inline-4. Two Isuzu-produced 2.8 L inline-4 diesels were offered; a naturally aspirated version offering 67.6 kW-68 kW and a turbocharged, intercooled version, offering 80–85 kW.

In 2008, Ford commenced sales of the V347/V348 Transit in China alongside its JMC-produced counterpart, branded the Ford-produced van as the &quot;New Transit&quot; and the JMC van as the &quot;Transit Classic&quot;. Between the two manufacturers, a combined 210,000 examples of both generations were sold in China; in 2012, Ford expanded operations, allowing production capacity to expand to 300,000 vehicles. In January 2010, the Toyota recalls affected the Transit Classic, as Ford/JMC utilized the same supplier of accelerator pedals (CTS Corporation), suspecting the units were defective and posed a risk of unintended acceleration. Approximately 1600 Ford Transit Classics in China were affected by the recall.

==== JMC Teshun ====
Starting from May 2017, Jiangling Motors replaced the license-built Ford Transit with the JMC Teshun range of vans. While sharing much of its body with its predecessor, the Teshun underwent a redesign of the front fascia with a larger front bumper and grille. The interior underwent an update to the dashboard, along with the introduction of a front bench seating configuration.

Retaining the VE83 platform of the second-generation Transit, the gasoline Teshun is offered with a Mitsubishi-produced and 2.4 L inline-4 (Engine code: 4G69S4N) and the diesel Teshun offered with an Jiangling-produced and , 2.8 L Turbo-diesel inline-four (engine code JX493ZLQ, essentially a modified version of the Isuzu 4JB1 engine); both engines are paired with a 5-speed manual transmission.
In August 2021, a facelift of Teshun was unveiled, updates include a redesign of the front fascia, grille, headlamps, and front bumper. The rear of the car has not changed. In terms of power, the 2.4-liter gasoline engine was removed. The original 2.8L turbo-diesel inline-four engine has been upgraded to increase the output to and . 

=== Third generation Transit (2009–2023) ===
The third-generation Ford Transit commenced production in China in 2008 for the 2009 model year. Engine choices consisted of the 2.2-litre turbo diesel, a 2.3-litre petrol for 2009 models and a 2.4-litre turbo diesel. The Transit in China was given a facelift for the 2013 model year onwards with new headlights and taillights. As of 2019, the 2.2-litre turbo diesel engine and 6 speed manual gearbox is standard across the range.

====2021 Ford Transit Pro====
The model line received a facelift for 2021 production, unveiled as the Ford Transit Pro at the 2020 Beijing Auto Show. Distinguished by a restyled front end and restyled taillamps, the revision included an updated powertrain to fulfill the National Standard VI emissions standard in China. The updated engine is a and 2.2-litre diesel engine paired to a 6-speed manual transmission.

The Transit Pro was also manufactured and sold in Vietnam as the Ford Transit in 2022, powered by a 2.2L turbodiesel engine, also using a 6-speed manual transmission. 

==== 2022 JMC Fushun ====
In mid-2022, Jiangling Motors released the JMC Fushun based on the Transit Pro. According to the official data, the model was equipped with a 2.0-litre inline-four turbodiesel engine (engine code JX4D20A6H, a modified Ford ZSD-420 engine) with an output of and paired with a 6-speed manual transmission.


===Transit T8 (2023-present)===
In August 2023, the fourth-generation Ford Transit was introduced to the Chinese market for the first time by JMC Ford. Restyled and named the Transit T8, the vehicle was originally codenamed Transit V363. Currently, JMC Ford offers the Transit T8 with either an electric motor or two different diesel engines: either the 2.3L turbo fifth generation Ford Puma diesel engine or a 2.0L turbodiesel engine. A 6 speed manual transmission option is available alongside an 8 speed automatic option. 

== Variants ==

=== Tourneo ===

Introduced as part of the 1994 redesign of the Transit, the Tourneo is a Transit-based 8 or 9-seat minibus, but over the years has become increasingly better trimmed up to the point where it can almost be classified as a large MPV. Featuring back seats and back windows similar to a minivan, the Tourneo is also considered an executive transport vehicle and is often supplied with alloy wheels. Since its introduction, the Tourneo has followed the same development cycle as the Transit; both versions receive updates at the same time.

A smaller MPV version of the Tourneo was introduced in 2002; branded the Tourneo Connect, it was based on the Transit Connect mini MPV.

The version based on the fourth generation Transit is marketed as the Ford Tourneo Custom, and from 2019 has a plug-in hybrid engine option.
=== County 4×4 ===

A handful of companies offered four-wheel-drive conversions, such as County Tractors of Knighton in Powys, Wales, UK who converted vans on behalf of Ford as a Special Vehicle Operations factory option. The first Transit County models were based on the Mk2 Transit model, both long and short wheelbase. The conversion used a Dana 44F front axle and a NP208 transfer box, both lifted from the Ford Bronco, coupled to the regular Transit engine, gearbox and rear axle using three custom propshafts. The Transit rear axle was retained, mounted to a rear subframe or &#x27;lift cradle&#x27; to give the extra ride height. Other modifications were 16-inch wheel rims, locking front hubs, a heavy-duty steering box and 305 mm diameter front brake discs.

With the introduction of the Mk3 Transit in 1986 came the next generation of the County 4×4. This would prove to be a very popular and successful version of the County Transit 4×4, and the last to use the Dana beam axle layout. Later County 4×4 models switched to using an independent front suspension setup which was inherently more complex in design than the earlier beam axle models. Later panel vans also lost the twin-wheel rear axle that had been fitted on earlier LWB versions.

Mainly used by utility companies such as National Grid (UK), the Ministry of Defence (UK), and by mountain rescue teams, the Transit County 4×4 proved to be a capable vehicle both on and off-road, with the ability to carry both crew and equipment just about anywhere.

Design and supply of drivetrain components for County 4×4 models passed to Countytrac, a division of M.J. Allen Ltd, who are still involved in the development of the latest Mk7 AWD Transit and Connect models.
===Transit Trail===
The Ford Transit Trail is an upcoming off-road motorhome version of the van and comes with a twin-turbo V6 engine and all-wheel drive.

=== Transit Custom ===
Replacing the previous front-wheel drive Transit/Tourneo, the Ford Transit Custom is a mid-size cargo and passenger van. Competing against the Mercedes-Benz Vito/Viano, Peugeot Expert, Renault Trafic and Volkswagen Transporter, the Custom is offered in two body lengths and two roof heights. Offered in most worldwide markets, the Transit Custom is not currently sold in the United States and Canada; it is sold in Mexico (where the predecessor front-wheel-drive Transit replaced the Freestar minivan).

For 2018 production, the model line received an exterior update, distinguished by a new grille (in line with the larger Transit); the interior received a new dashboard (styled in line with the Fiesta).

===XXL===

To celebrate the Transit&#x27;s status as International Van of the Year 2007, Ford built a stretch limousine style van – the Transit XXL. It is a unique special that is the most expensive Transit ever made.

=== SuperSportVan ===
The Ford Transit SuperSportVan was a one-off, high-performance version of the third-gen Transit built by Ford Europe. It uses a 3.2L turbocharged Duratorq I5, producing 198 horsepower, borrowed from a larger Transit model, mated to a 6-speed transmission.

<text>The Zimba, elevation , is the most familiar mountain in the Austrian mountain range called Rätikon. Located in the hinterland of Bludenz, this horn is the landmark of Montafon valley and especially of the main village of Schruns. Three ridges and three walls emphasize the shapeliness of the form. The eastern ridge is one of the most familiar climbing routes of the whole Rätikon range, but the normal way leads along the western ridge. Despite the altitude of just 2,645 m, the Zimba is a great viewpoint for the entire region.

==Climbing routes==
*Western ridge, normal way, UIAA Class 3 (Opened by F. Sohm and J. Both in 1900)
*North east ridge, seldom taken, Class 2. (August 1854 route by three hunters)
*East ridge, the most difficult way up, Class 4
*South wall, dangerous (grassy and falling rocks), Class 2. (First ascent route)

<doc id="506349" wikidata="Q16588" url="?curid=506349" title="Piz Buin">
<text>Piz Buin () is a mountain in the Silvretta range of the Alps on the border between Austria and Switzerland. It forms the border between the Swiss canton of Graubünden and the Austrian state of Vorarlberg and is the highest peak in Vorarlberg.

Its full name in the Romansh language is &quot;Piz Buin Grond&quot; (&quot;Great Piz Buin&quot;). A similar but smaller summit nearby is called &quot;Piz Buin Pitschen&quot; (&quot;Small Piz Buin&quot;) at 3,255 m (10,680 ft). Piz Buin was first climbed on 14 July 1865 by Joseph Anton Specht and Johann Jakob Weilenmann, guided by Jakob Pfitscher and Franz Pöll. Piz Buin Pitschen was climbed three years later.

Piz Buin can be reached from the Wiesbadener hut, crossing the Vermunt glacier, climbing up the Wiesbadener ridge and hiking over the Ochsentaler Glacier to the Buin gap. From the gap there is a zigzag walk to the top, with only a 20 m (65 ft) steep step to surmount before reaching the relatively flat summit space, which has an old wooden cross on the very top. The border between Switzerland and Austria crosses the summit from East to West.

== Location and Surroundings ==
As part of the main Silvretta ridge, the mountain marks the border between Austria and Switzerland or Vorarlberg and the canton of Grisons, which runs across the summit in a west-easterly direction. To the west, separated by the Buinlücke pass, lies the Kleine Piz Buin, also known as Piz Buin Pitschen on some maps (3255 m). The Ochsental Glacier extends to the north and west of the Grosser Piz Buin, while the Vermunt Glacier lies to the northeast, separated from the Ochsental Glacier by the Wiesbadner Grätle. These two glaciers, located on Austrian territory, form the source of the Ill, which flows north through the Ochsental valley to the Silvretta Reservoir in Vermunt on the Bielerhöhe. To the south of the Vermunt glacier, the 2797 m high Vermunt Pass forms the transition into the Swiss Val Tuoi, a side valley of the Lower Engadine, which extends south of Piz Buin to Guarda and belongs to the municipality of Scuol.To the southwest of Piz Buin are the Cronsel rock spur and behind it the Plan Rai firn field, followed by Piz Fliana. To the west of Kleiner Piz Buin, the terrain is also glaciated, where the Vadret Tiatscha is located, which merges into the Silvretta Glacier via the Silvretta Pass and the Verstanclator into the Verstancla Glacier via the Verstanclator. To the northwest, the ridge leads from the Kleiner Piz Buin to the Fuorcla dal Cunfin and over to the Signalhorn. In the Silvretta, Piz Buin is only surpassed in height by the huge pyramid of Piz Linard (3410 m) and the Fluchthorn (3397 m).

== Geology and Flora ==
Piz Buin, like its surrounding peaks, is made up of crystalline rock from the Silvretta, which consists mainly of gneiss. In contrast to the higher peaks of Piz Linard and Fluchthorn, which are mainly composed of hornblende gneiss (and schist), Piz Buin is composed of lighter granite and eye gneiss. The vegetation is, as generally in the higher regions of the Silvretta, composed of crystalline rock.

The vegetation is sparse, as is generally the case in the higher regions of the Silvretta, and consists of rock and debris-dwelling plants of the nival stage. In addition to lichens and mosses, the glacier buttercup should be mentioned, which even flowers on the summit of Piz Buin.

== Base Point and Trails ==
On the Austrian side, next to the Bieler Höhe, is the Wiesbadener Hütte (2443 m) on the east side of the Ochsental. From there, the traditional normal route leads south over the Vermunt Glacier and further west to the Wiesbadener Grätle, from where you cross the Ochsental Glacier to the Buinlücke. On the ascent to the Wiesbadener Grätle, there are sections of grade level II (UIAA) to overcome. As the glacier under the Wiesbadener Grätle has continued to melt since around the year 2000, this route has become increasingly difficult and risky. In particular, the risk of falling rocks under the exposed brittle rock has led to the route already being considered for closure. The lower ice level is making it increasingly difficult to access, so that in midsummer it can often reach difficulty level IV+ or even be completely impassable.

An alternative to this route leads from the Wiesbadener Hütte or directly from the Bieler Höhe to the Ochsentaler Glacier and over this to the Buinlücke. This ascent is a popular ski tour in winter.

The Buinlücke can also be reached from the Tuoi hut (2250 m) in Val Tuoi, usually via the Fuorcla dal Cunfin to the west of the Kleiner Piz Buin and then via the Ochsental glacier.[1] This route is also frequently used in winter with touring skis. In avalanche-safe conditions, a direct descent through the Buinlücke towards the Tuoihütte is possible for very good skiers (narrow and approx. 40° steep in the upper section).

The route over the Fuorcla dal Cunfin can also be reached from the Swiss Silvretta hut (2341 m) via the Silvretta glacier and Silvretta Pass.

What all these routes have in common is the ascent to the summit from the Buinlücke: It leads over the west flank to the northwest ridge and over this through the so-called chimney to the scree-covered west flank and over this to the summit without any difficulty. The exposed crux in the chimney is rated I to III.

== Hazard Zone Buinlücke - Normal Route Piz Buin ==
The Office for Natural Hazards of the Canton of Graubünden and the Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research in Davos have been warning of a major rockfall on the Kleiner Piz Buin (Piz Buin Pitschen) since autumn 2022, which also directly affects the area of the Buinlücke (Fuorcla Buin) and the lower section of the normal route on Piz Buin. Measurements carried out in 2022 showed that over twenty thousand cubic meters of rock material (including large boulders) had already fallen within the year as a result of rockfall/blockfall and that, unlike in previous years, the rock mass was now increasingly in motion. The normal route to the summit initially led directly over the freshly erupted rock material, so that the ascent is directly in the danger zone and the major rockfall expected in the next five years would put climbers on the normal route at considerable risk. This should be taken into account when planning a tour, especially in unfavorable weather conditions such as prolonged/heavy rainfall and prolonged heat with strong sunlight. The endangered area of the normal route should therefore be crossed quickly and individually with the greatest possible distance to the foot of the Kleiner Piz Buin in order to minimize the risks. A ski descent from the Buinlücke in the direction of the Tuoi hut should no longer be undertaken, as this area down to the hut is particularly at risk, especially in winter.

== Name and History ==
Piz Buin is a Rhaeto-Romanic name meaning &#x27;Ox Peak&#x27;, with the &#x27;Buin&#x27; stressed on the second syllable. The almost flat valley floor at the end of the Ochsental, which is now flooded by the Silvretta reservoir, used to be pastureland. Grazing animals are still kept in the vicinity of the reservoir.

The original Rhaeto-Romanic name is Piz Buin Grond (Great Piz Buin), as opposed to the smaller Piz Buin, Piz Buin Pitschen.

Other names that are hardly used today were &quot;Albuinkopf&quot; in Vorarlberg and &quot;Albainkopf&quot; in Tyrol.

The first ascent was made on 14 July 1865 by Josef Anton Specht and Johann Jakob Weilenmann, accompanied by Jakob Pfitscher and Franz Pöll. Their original plan was to reach the Wiesbadener Grätle from the Bielerhöhe from the east, cross it and climb to the Buinlücke (3054m) via the gently sloping upper part of the ice stream, now called the Ochsentaler Glacier.

However, as an ascent via the (still existing) icefall to the north-west of the Wiesbadener Grätle promised faster progress, they left the Grätle to the east and reached the summit via the Buinlücke and the west flank in five hours.

The first descent was back to the Buinlücke. The route continued along the northern foot of the smaller Piz Buin to the saddle south of the Signalhorn, the &quot;Fuorcla dal Cunfin&quot;, and from there through the Swiss Val Tuoi to Klosters.

The names of the glaciers in the Piz Buin area used to be different from those used today:

In his description of the first ascent, Weilenmann referred to the ice field now commonly known as the &quot;Vermunt Glacier&quot;, framed by the Dreiländerspitze, Vermuntpaß, Piz Buin and Wiesbadener Grätle, as the &quot;Fermunt - or Ochsenthal Glacier&quot; and the &quot;Main Glacier&quot;. The ice stream surrounded by the Wiesbadener Grätle, the Buinen, the Signalhorn and the Silvrettahorn, now called the Ochsentaler Glacier, over which the first ascent was made, he saw as a &quot;side glacier&quot; of the ice field now called the Vermuntgletscher.

Even Hermine and Walther Flaig, in an essay (&quot;100 Jahre Piz Buin&quot;) to mark the centenary of the first ascent, spoke of a &quot;crevasse labyrinth of the western Vermunt glacier&quot;, referring to the icefall of the present-day Ochsental glacier.

At the time of the first ascents, both glaciers joined below the Grüne Kuppe (2579 m) in front of the Wiesbadener Grätli to the north, forming a medial moraine. Today, they have been greatly reduced by glacial melting and are separate ice fields, widely separated by the Wiesbadener Grätle and the Grüne Kuppe.

On 13 September 1936, Vorarlberg&#x27;s first summit cross was erected on Piz Buin. The Christian-socialist Vorarlberger Volksblatt described the highly symbolic action as a &quot;sign that this country is and will remain Christian despite all the attacks of the &#x27;conquerors of Christianity&#x27;&quot; (meaning the Communists and the Nazis) and described the transport of the cross to the summit as a &quot;crusade of the Reichsbund&quot;, which &quot;can hardly be explained physically, but can only be understood by the faith that moves mountains&quot;. In the summer of 2012, a new summit cross was flown to the mountain on behalf of the ÖAV, after the previous one, believed to date from the 1950s, had weathered and become misaligned.

== Trivia ==
The mountain also gives its name to the &#x27;Piz Buin&#x27; sun protection products of the pharmaceutical company Johnson &amp; Johnson. The chemist Franz Greiter was sunburned while climbing the peak in 1938 and in the following years developed the sunscreen of the same name.

<text>Remington Arms Company, LLC, was an American manufacturer of firearms and ammunition. It was formerly owned by the Remington Outdoor Company, which went bankrupt in 2020 with its lines of business sold to several purchasers. Two resulting companies each bear the &quot;Remington&quot; name—the firearms manufacturer is Remington Firearms owned by RemArms, LLC., and the ammunition business is Remington Ammunition owned by Vista Outdoor Inc.

Founded in 1816 by Eliphalet Remington as E. Remington and Sons in Ilion, New York, it was one of the oldest gun makers in the United States and claimed to be the oldest factory in the country that still made its original product. The company was the largest rifle manufacturer in North America according to 2015 ATF statistics. The company developed or adopted more cartridges than any other gun maker or ammunition manufacturer in the world.

==History==
===19th century origins===


The Remington company was founded in 1816. Eliphalet Remington II (1793–1861) believed he could build a better gun than he could buy. Remington began designing and building a flintlock rifle for himself. At age 23 (in late 1816), he entered a shooting match; though he finished second, his well-made gun impressed other contestants. Before Remington left the field that day, he had received so many orders from other competitors that he had officially entered the gunsmithing business. By 1828, he moved his operation to nearby Ilion. The modern Remington firearms plant still uses this site.

On March 7, 1888, two years after spinning off the typewriter business which later became Remington Rand, the Remington family sold the ownership of E. Remington &amp; Sons to new owners, Marcellus Hartley and Partners. This consisted of Hartley and Graham of New York, New York, a major sporting goods chain that also owned the Union Metallic Cartridge Company in Bridgeport and the Winchester Repeating Arms Company of New Haven, both in Connecticut. At this time, the company formally changed its name to the Remington Arms Company.

===20th century===


When the US entered World War I, Remington became deeply involved in the war effort. Remington was left with huge stocks of guns and ammunition and no prospects for payment. The US government purchased the firearms.

During the Great Depression, Remington was purchased by DuPont, which had made its name with improvements to gunpowder. A year later, Remington purchased the Peters Cartridge Company; today, many of the Remington headstamps still have &quot;R-P&quot; on them for Remington-Peters.

In 1940, the US Army became worried about its ammunition capacity and asked Remington to collaborate on a plan for national expansion. With the aid of DuPont, Remington built the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant (named Lake City Arsenal initially) and Denver Ordnance ammunition plants, and three more plants later on, including the Lowell Ordnance Plant. Though the plants belonged to the US government, Remington was asked to oversee their operation. Among the weapons that Remington manufactured for the government during World War II was the famous M1903A3 Springfield bolt-action rifle.

During the 1950s and 1960s, Remington expanded into other products besides guns, with the purchase of Mall Tool Company in 1956. One of the products was chain saws.

In 1962, Remington introduced the Model 700 bolt-action rifle. The rifle became one of Remington&#x27;s most successful firearms and quickly lent itself to developments of many sub-variants, including the Remington 700 BDL, Remington 700PSS for police and law enforcement agencies (the rifle, later renamed 700P, is very popular among law enforcement agencies) and the military M24 SWS, which was the United States Army standard sniper rifle between 1988 and 2010. Other armed forces worldwide still use it, such as the IDF. Other firearms companies designed and manufactured sniper rifles based on the reliable and accurate Remington Model 700 action.

In 1969, Remington broke ground on a new ammunition manufacturing plant in Lonoke, Arkansas. By 1970, centerfire ammunition in the Remington, UMC and Peter&#x27;s brand names were being produced by the facility. The company&#x27;s shotshell then rimfire ammunition production operations were subsequently moved to the Lonoke facility in the mid 1970s and early 1980s.

In 1986, Remington closed its ammunition plant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, completely transferring operations to the facility in Lonoke, Arkansas. A year later, Remington built a new clay targets plant in Athens, Georgia. According to an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in 1993, Remington&#x27;s parent company—DuPont de Nemours &amp; Company (DuPont)—sold Remington to the New York investment firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice (CD&amp;R) for $300 million. &quot;The Times&quot;, citing the National Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association said that &quot;rifle and shotgun sales totaled $900 million&quot; in 1992. Citing the National Shooting Sports Foundation president, the article said that since 1986, &quot;interest in hunting&quot; had &quot;declined&quot;. The sale of long guns—which represented 75% of Remington sales had become &quot;slack&quot; by 1993, while the sale of handguns had become the &quot;fastest-growing segment&quot; of the gun industry.

===21st century===
In June 2007, a private equity firm, Cerberus Capital Management, acquired Remington Arms for $370 million, including $252 million in assumed debt. It became part of Cerberus&#x27; Freedom Group. Remington was millions of dollars in debt and did not report a profit from 2003 to 2005. In 2015, the Freedom Group was renamed Remington Outdoor Company.

In December 2007, Remington Arms acquired rifle-maker Marlin Firearms. In 2009, ammunition sales continued to remain high despite the ongoing United States Ammunition Shortage during that time. Chief Executive Officer Ted Torbeck said that consumer concerns over future restrictions, and taxes on ammunition and firearms by the Obama administration, were creating a rise in demand.

In 2009, Remington&#x27;s former ammunition factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut, was investigated by the Travel Channel&#x27;s &quot;Ghost Adventures&quot;. The site was eventually purchased by Peter DiNardo Enterprises Inc. and was scheduled for demolition.

In October 2009, Remington Military products acquired suppressor manufacturer Advanced Armament Corporation. In 2010, Remington introduced the fastest commercially available shotgun shell, Hypersonic Steel, with a patented wad technology that allows the shot to travel at .

After a 12-year absence from the handgun market, Remington announced the Remington 1911 R1 in 2010. It had previously ceased production of its last handgun, the Model XP-100R in 1998. Later in 2010, Remington introduced the Versa Max auto-loading shotgun. Its patented &quot;Versa Port&quot; system self-regulates gas pressure based on the length of the cartridge used, enabling the shotgun to shoot light target loads, hunting loads, and magnum hunting loads.

In 2012, Remington won a US Army contract to manufacture 24,000 M4A1 carbines at $673 per unit worth $16,163,252 total.

In 2013, for the first time since 1928, Remington began to offer an air rifle, called the &quot;Remington Express.&quot;

On February 17, 2014, Remington announced a plan to build a new state-of-the-art plant in Huntsville, Alabama. Remington said it decided to move two production lines from the Ilion, New York, plant as a result of the fallout from the NY SAFE Act, which restricted gun ownership in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. AR-15 style semi-automatic rifles from Bushmaster, DPMS, and Remington (R-15) and 1911 style R-1 pistols were produced in the plant. The plant was touted by Alabama&#x27;s Department of Commerce Secretary and by Remington as a boon to Alabama&#x27;s economy. The president of United Mine Workers Local 717, which represented workers at Ilion, expressed fears about the future of the New York facility and blamed the NY SAFE Act for the company&#x27;s decision to favor Alabama over New York. Subsequently, about 100 Remington jobs were shifted from New York to Alabama.

Beginning in late 2017, Remington began bankruptcy planning, having suffered declining sales and reputation; damage from an August 2017 exposé on the CBS news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; about X-Mark Pro trigger defects linked to several deaths, and amassed some $950 million worth of debt. The low sales and debt were blamed on either a reduction in &quot;panic-buying&quot;, or diminishing quality and reputation. Remington filed for bankruptcy in March 2018, and exited bankruptcy on May 17, 2018, less than two months later. The company&#x27;s quick exit was due to a pre-approved restructuring plan supported by 97% of its creditors, which canceled all shares of common stock issued before the bankruptcy proceedings, and the issuance of new shares to convert over $775 million of company debt into equity.

The families of nine victims and a teacher who were shot and survived the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting with a Remington Bushmaster rifle filed a wrongful death lawsuit in Connecticut state court seeking a jury trial to recover unspecified damages. The case was briefly moved to federal court before being referred back to the state court level. In 2016, the suit was initially dismissed by a Connecticut Superior Court citing the immunity provided to firearms manufacturers by the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) of 2005. Remington&#x27;s bankruptcy delayed the suit. On March 14, 2019, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled, 4–3, that the suit&#x27;s wrongful marketing claim could proceed to trial under Connecticut&#x27;s Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA) which addressed marketing including &quot;truly unethical and irresponsible marketing practices promoting criminal conduct&quot; and was not preempted by the PLCAA. The US Supreme Court declined to hear the case. On February 15, 2022, it was announced that a $73 million settlement had been reached between the Sandy Hook families and Remington. The cost of the settlement was borne by insurers.

===Breakup===

On July 28, 2020, Remington filed again for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and its assets were divided up and sold to various buyers, including:
* The Remington brand name and the Lonoke ammunition factory was bought by Vista Outdoor, which uses it to market and manufacture several types of ammunition.
* The Remington firearms business (excluding Marlin Firearms) was sold to Roundhill Group, LLC, which now operates it through the holding company RemArms, LLC. RemArms licenses the use of the &quot;Remington&quot; brand name from Vista Outdoor.
* Marlin Firearms was purchased by Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co.

<doc id="506373" wikidata="Q430154" url="?curid=506373" title="Hiddenite">
<text>Hiddenite is a pale-to-emerald green variety of spodumene that is sometimes used as a gemstone.

The first specimens of the hiddenite variety of spodumene were recovered circa 1879 near the settlement of White Plains, west of Stony Point, Alexander County, North Carolina. According to contemporary accounts, a man named Lackey brought them to the attention of J.A.D. Stephenson, a local merchant who was a collector of minerals. Initially, the yellowish to greenish-yellow hiddenites were thought to be gemmy diopside. Stephenson brought the discovery to the attention of exploration geologist William Earl Hidden, who had been commissioned by Thomas Edison to seek sources of platinum in North Carolina (an effort that was unsuccessful). Hidden sent samples of the odd green material to J. Lawrence Smith, a prominent chemist and mineralogist in Louisville, Kentucky. Smith correctly identified the specimens as being a variety of spodumene and named them &quot;hiddenite&quot; in honor of Hidden. The community in which the gemstones were first found was later renamed &quot;Hiddenite&quot;. During the heyday of hiddenite mining in the 1880s and 1890s it was also known as &quot;lithia emerald&quot;. 

Hidden recognized the value of the emeralds and the potential of the new gemmy green spodumene. He acquired a tract of poor quality land, which was either the site of the initial discovery or near to it, for $1500. The Emerald and Hiddenite Mining Company was organized and excavations on the site recovered loose hiddenites and emeralds in the red, gravelly clay. At a depth of about 26 feet they struck bedrock, and soon were recovering hiddenites from solid rock. Oddly, period newspaper accounts and statements by George Frederick Kunz (1892) indicate that mining on the site was never undertaken as a full-time operation, but was only prosecuted a few weeks or months during the summer. 

Writing in 1892, Kunz described the hiddenite being recovered as &quot;always transparent, ranges from colorless (rare) to a light yellow, into a yellowish green, then into a deep yellow emerald green. Sometimes an entire crystal has a uniform green color, but generally one end is yellow and the other green.&quot; Kunz noted that the finest crystal recovered prior to 1892 measured 68 mm tall, and could have cut a gem of 5.5ct estimated weight. The size of most cut gems were small, with a 2ct hiddenite in the Augustus C. Hamlin collection being considered among the finest of the large stones. 

The coloring agent is chromium. Colors can gradually fade. Hiddenite has a strong vitreous luster and displays strong colors due to pleochroism.

In addition to the North Carolina locality, Hiddenite has been found in Brazil, China, and Madagascar. Green spodumene found in Afghanistan and Pakistan has excited modest amounts of controversy in the mineral and gemological communities with debate over whether or not it should be truly considered &quot;hiddenite&quot; as well as claims that the green coloration is induced by irradiation and is fugitive. 

Deposits occur in granite pegmatite.

<doc id="506383" wikidata="Q976521" url="?curid=506383" title="Cryptosystem">
<text>In cryptography, a cryptosystem is a suite of cryptographic algorithms needed to implement a particular security service, such as confidentiality (encryption).

Typically, a cryptosystem consists of three algorithms: one for key generation, one for encryption, and one for decryption. The term &quot;cipher&quot; (sometimes &quot;cypher&quot;) is often used to refer to a pair of algorithms, one for encryption and one for decryption. Therefore, the term &quot;cryptosystem&quot; is most often used when the key generation algorithm is important. For this reason, the term &quot;cryptosystem&quot; is commonly used to refer to public key techniques; however both &quot;cipher&quot; and &quot;cryptosystem&quot; are used for symmetric key techniques.

== Formal definition ==

Mathematically, a cryptosystem or encryption scheme can be defined as a tuple formula_1 with the following properties.

#formula_2 is a set called the &quot;plaintext space&quot;. Its elements are called plaintexts.
#formula_3 is a set called the &quot;ciphertext space&quot;. Its elements are called ciphertexts. 
#formula_4 is a set called the &quot;key space&quot;. Its elements are called keys.
#formula_5 is a set of functions formula_6. Its elements are called &quot;encryption functions&quot;.
#formula_7 is a set of functions formula_8. Its elements are called &quot;decryption functions&quot;.

For each formula_9, there is formula_10 such that formula_11 for all formula_12.

Note; typically this definition is modified in order to distinguish an encryption scheme as being either a symmetric-key or public-key type of cryptosystem.

== Examples ==

A classical example of a cryptosystem is the Caesar cipher. A more contemporary example is the RSA cryptosystem.

Another example of a cryptosystem is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm that has become the standard for securing data in various applications.

Paillier cryptosystem is another example used to preserve and maintain privacy and sensitive information. It is featured in electronic voting, electronic lotteries and electronic auctions.

<text>The Rouge River is a river in Markham, Pickering, Richmond Hill and Toronto in the Greater Toronto Area of Ontario, Canada. The river flows from the Oak Ridges Moraine to Lake Ontario at the eastern border of Toronto, and is the location of Rouge Park, the only national park in Canada within a municipality. At its southern end, the Rouge River is the boundary between Toronto and southwestern Pickering in the Regional Municipality of Durham.

==History==

The Rouge River is part of the Carolinian life zone that is found in Southern Ontario. 
After the eradication of both the Petun and the Wyandot (Huron), Senecas from New York attempted to
establish/expand their fur trade activities by establishing a village named &quot;Gandechiagaiagon&quot; (recorded variously as &quot;Gandatsekiagon&quot;, &quot;Ganatsekwyagon&quot;, &quot;Gandatchekiagon&quot;, or &quot;Katabokokonk&quot;), meaning &quot;sand-cut&quot; at the mouth of Rouge River.

According to a 1796 list by English surveyor Augustus Jones, the Mississauga name for the river was &quot;Gichi-ziibiins&quot; (recorded as &quot;Che-sippi&quot;), meaning &quot;large creek.&quot; The river&#x27;s name likely is French for &quot;red river&quot;, based on the mappings by French explorer Louis Jolliet.

In the early 19th century, pioneer settlers could spear large salmon spawning as far north as the upper tributaries of the Rouge in what is today Whitchurch-Stouffville

In the former City of Scarborough, the Rouge was the &quot;third rail&quot; issue of municipal politics, and many minor candidates for mayor often ran on a platform to preserve it. However, since Scarborough was annexed into the City of Toronto, Toronto City Council has voted on occasion to allow development around the river. A plan to build condominiums and townhouses across from the Touge in Pickering in 2000 was shutdown due to threat to native species. For much of the course of the system in Toronto is still parkland or farmland.

As for the York Region sections, the southern watershed runs through residential areas (south of Major Mackenzie Drive and west of Markham Road) and is lined with a few small municipal parks. The source of the system is either natural or farmland.

Currently, there is a degree of abandonment in the area, of former farmlands, and historic houses. There also remain many historic houses which are still lived in, some even farmed. Research on Toronto&#x27;s website listing its holdings of historic properties reveals over 20 historic buildings in the area, including Hillside Public School, Scarborough&#x27;s first schoolhouse, which sits across the street from a house built by the Pearse family in 1855.

==Geography==
===Watershed===
The Rouge River begins in the Oak Ridges Moraine in Richmond Hill and flows past: Markham, northwest, central, to the south, including a couple of conservation areas, the eastern edge of Scarborough and Rouge Valley Park. The watershed of the Rouge River is located in the municipalities of Richmond Hill and Markham in the Regional Municipality of York; Pickering in the Regional Municipality of Durham; and Toronto. 


Tributaries of the Rouge River also extend into the municipalities of Aurora and Whitchurch-Stouffville in the Regional Municipality of York. The total area of the watershed is , of which 40% is agricultural land, 35% urban, 24% forest/wetland/meadow and 1% watercourses/waterbodies.

The headwaters of the Rouge River and its tributaries are found in the Oak Ridges Moraine. Water flows down from the elevated moraine to Lake Ontario. The Rouge River meets Lake Ontario at Rouge Beach. At Rouge Beach, the Rouge Marsh is to the north and Lake Ontario to the south. More than half the remaining wetlands in the Greater Toronto Area are located here in the southern Rouge River. 

It is one of a few wilderness areas left in South-Central Ontario and has been virtually untouched by development since the arrival of Europeans. While many exclusive homes and conclaves border this area on the southern tip, it is currently surrounded largely by agricultural land. It is even devoid of recreational development but sports a considerable network of walking or bicycle paths. Unlike other rivers in the Toronto area, it is allowed to fill its entire flood plain on a regular basis rather than being forced through an artificial channel. However, parts of its watershed include the Toronto Zoo and the Beare Road Landfill.

===Tributaries===

*Little Rouge Creek (left) - runs northeast via Cedar Grove, Locust Hill, Dickson Hill, Ringwood, Lemonville, and Bloomington (Kennedy Road-Bethesda Road to Kingston Road and Altona Road)
**Katabokokonk Creek - a short creek runs in northeast Markham (west of Reesor Road and Don Cousens Parkway to Major Mackenzie Drive and west of Reesor Road) and bears the original First Nations name of the Rouge
*Morningside Creek (right) - flows from an area near Dennison Avenue and Markham Road to southwest of the Toronto Zoo and east of Morningside Road 
*Exhibition Creek - runs from north of 16th Avenue and Highway 48 to Markham and Highway 7
*Robinson Creek (left)- runs from north of Elgin Mills between McCowan Road and Kennedy Road to the east end of Milne Park at 48 and Highway 7
*Eckardt Creek (left) runs from storm management ponds at west of The Bridle Walk and 16th Avenue north to Bur Oak Avenue and east of The Bridle Walk
*Bruce Creek (left) - starts in several ponds in the southeast corner of Aurora, flows briefly through the northeast corner of Richmond Hill, then southeast in the southwest corner of Whitchurch-Stouffville, through Bruce&#x27;s Mill Conservation Area and into Markham. It flows through Angus Glen Golf Club and into Toogood Pond in Unionville, just before which the tributary Berczy Creek joins. The creek runs several hundred metres more to its mouth just east of Kennedy Road (Kennedy-Highway 7 to Woodbine Avenue north of Bloomington Road)
**Berczy Creek - runs from north of Stouffville Road and Woodbine Avenue into Bruce Creek just upstream of Toogood Pond
***Carleton Creek - runs from Woodbine Avenue and Major Mackenzie Drive to Berczy Creek at 16th Avenue and Warden Avenue
*Beaver Creek (right); flows from Richmond Hill to the future Downtown Markham development area; bounded by Major Mackenzie Drive-Bayview Avenue to Warden-Highway 407
*Apple Creek - a small creek near Apple Creek Blvd, Rodick Road and runs between residential developments in a northwest direction to 16th Avenue and Buttonfield Road (just south of Cachet Centre shopping mall)

==Parks==
===National Park===
Rouge National Urban Park is a national urban park managed by Parks Canada. The Park the largest urban park in North America, comprising a significant portion of the Rouge River. The Park was created after the Ministry of Stephen Harper proposed, in the 41st Canadian Parliament throne speech, the creation of the national park.

===Municipal parks===
There are a number of local parks around of the Rouge watershed managed by the municipalities of Markham, Pickering, Richmond Hill, and Toronto. In addition, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority manages a number of parks and conservation areas. These parks include:

* Bob Hunter Memorial Park
* Littles Road Park
* Morningview Ravine Park
* Woodlands Park
* Glen Rouge Park
* Rouge Valley Park, Markham
* Rouge Beach Park
* Milne Park, Markham
* Apple Creek Park
* Cedar Valley Park
* Mount Joy Lake Park
* Springdale Park
* Monarch Park
* Ashton Meadows Park
* Artisan Park - Beaver Creek
* Beaver Greenway - Beaver Creek
* Bruce Creek Park
* Berczy Creek Park
* Boyton Woods Park
* Elgin Mills Cemetery
* Headwaters Park
==Metro East Freeway==

The Rouge was threatened by the proposed Metro East Freeway which would have run along the river valley like the Don Valley Parkway from north Scarborough through Markham between Ninth Line and York-Durham Town Line terminating in Stouffville. The roadway came into existence following the cancellation of the Spadina Expressway and pause on Scarborough Expressway in 1971. It was removed from planning in 1994. Markham continues to seek an arterial connection to Ontario Highway 401 which led to the construction of Donald Cousens Parkway with planned connection to Highway 401 via extension of Morningside Avenue to Steeles Avenue.

==Golf courses==

* Parkview Golf Course - created from former IBM Canada Course
* Markham Green Golf Course - created from former IBM Canada Course (c. 1960) and Box Grove Golf Club (c. 1940); part of clubhouse became Rouge River Community Centre in the 1990s (pool added 1999)
* Cedar Brae Golf &amp; Country Club (c. 1922)
* York Downs Golf and Country Club
* Angus Glen Golf Club - opened in 1992 built on the former Angus Glen Farm (c. 1957)
* Markham Golf Club
* Buttonville Fairways Golf Centre
A 18-hole golf course, Unionville Golf Centre, operated from 1961 to 2007 on Main Street Unionville south of Highway 7 along the Rouge River. It is now site of Bill Crothers Secondary School. The golf greens area along the river have now been restored as natural habitat.

<doc id="506386" wikidata="Q451248" url="?curid=506386" title="David Wechsler">
<text>David &quot;Weshy&quot; Wechsler (; January 12, 1896 – May 2, 1981) was a Romanian-American psychologist. He developed well-known intelligence scales, such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) to get to know his patients at Bellevue Hospital. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Wechsler as the 51st most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

==Early life and education==
Wechsler was born in a Jewish family in Lespezi, Romania, and emigrated with his parents to the United States as a child. He studied at the City College of New York and Columbia University, where he earned his master&#x27;s degree in 1917 and his Ph.D. in 1925 under the direction of Robert S. Woodworth. During World War I, he worked with the United States Army to develop psychological tests to screen new draftees while studying under Charles Spearman and Karl Pearson.

==Career==
===Bellevue Hospital===
After short stints at various locations (including five years in private practice), Wechsler became chief psychologist at Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital in 1932, where he stayed until 1967.

Wechsler was member of a 1947 mission to set up a mental health program and clinic for Jewish survivors of the Holocaust.

===Intelligence scales===
Wechsler is best known for his intelligence tests. He was one of the most influential advocates of the role of nonintellective factors in testing. He emphasized that factors other than intellectual ability are involved in intelligent behavior. Wechsler objected to the single score offered by the 1937 Binet scale, finding the then-current Binet IQ test unsatisfactory. Wechsler originally created his tests to find out more about his patients at the Bellevue clinic. This battery differed greatly from the Binet scale which, in Wechsler&#x27;s day, was generally considered the supreme authority with regard to intelligence testing. As the 1960 form of Lewis Terman&#x27;s Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales was less carefully developed than previous versions, Form I of the WAIS surpassed the Stanford–Binet tests in popularity by the 1960s.

Although his test did not directly measure nonintellective factors, it took these factors into careful account in its underlying theory. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) was developed first in 1939 and then called the Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Test. From these he derived the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) in 1949 and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) in 1967. The tests are still based on his philosophy that intelligence is &quot;the global capacity to act purposefully, to think rationally, and to deal effectively with [one&#x27;s] environment&quot; (cited in Kaplan &amp; Saccuzzo, p. 256).

The Wechsler scales introduced many novel concepts and breakthroughs to the intelligence testing movement. First, he did away with the quotient scores of older intelligence tests (the Q in &quot;I.Q.&quot;). Instead, he assigned an arbitrary value of 100 to the mean intelligence and added or subtracted another 15 points for each standard deviation above or below the mean the subject was. While not rejecting the concept of general intelligence (as conceptualized by his teacher Charles Spearman), he divided the concept of intelligence into two main areas: verbal and performance (non-verbal) scales, each evaluated with different subtests.

== Personal life ==
He died on May 2, 1981.

<text>Ian &amp; Sylvia were a Canadian folk and country music duo which consisted of Ian and Sylvia Tyson. They began performing together in 1959 (full-time in 1961), married in 1964, and divorced and stopped performing together in 1975.

==History==
===Early lives===
Ian Tyson, CM, AOE was born in Victoria, British Columbia in 1933. In his teens, he decided upon a career as a rodeo rider. Recovering from injuries sustained from a fall during the mid-1950s, he started learning guitar. In the late 1950s, he relocated to Toronto, aspiring to a career as a commercial artist. He also started playing clubs and coffeehouses in Toronto. By 1959 he was performing music as a full-time occupation.

Sylvia Tyson, née Fricker, CM, was born in Chatham, Ontario in 1940. While still in her teens, she started frequenting the folk clubs of Toronto.

===Career===
====Folk duo====
The two started performing together in Toronto in 1959. By 1962, they were living in New York City, where they caught the attention of manager Albert Grossman, who managed Peter, Paul and Mary and would soon become Bob Dylan&#x27;s manager. Grossman secured them a contract with Vanguard Records and they released their first album late in the year.

Their first album, &quot;Ian &amp; Sylvia&quot;, on Vanguard Records, consists mainly of traditional songs. There were British and Canadian folk songs, spiritual music, and a few blues songs thrown into the mix. The album was moderately successful and they made the list of performers for the 1963 Newport Folk Festival.

&quot;Four Strong Winds&quot;, their second album, was similar to the first, with the exception of the inclusion of the early Dylan composition &quot;Tomorrow Is a Long Time&quot; and the title song &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot;, written by Ian Tyson. &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot; was a major hit in Canada and ensured their stardom. Years later, the song was named as the greatest Canadian song of all time by the CBC-Radio program &quot;50 Tracks: The Canadian Version&quot;.

The two married in June 1964; they also released their third album, &quot;Northern Journey&quot;, that year. It included a song written by Sylvia, titled &quot;You Were on My Mind&quot;, recorded by both the California group We Five (a 1965 #4 on the RPM charts, #1 on the Cashbox chart, #3 on the Billboard Hot 100) and British folk rock singer Crispian St. Peters (#29 on the RPM charts, #36 in 1967). A recording of &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot; by Bobby Bare made it to #3 on the country charts around that time.

On the &quot;Northern Journey&quot; album was the song &quot;Someday Soon&quot;, a composition by Ian Tyson that would rival &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot; in its popularity. (Both songs would eventually be recorded by dozens of singers.)

Their fourth album, &quot;Early Morning Rain&quot;, consisted in large part of new songs. They introduced the work of the couple&#x27;s fellow Canadian songwriter and performer Gordon Lightfoot through the title song and &quot;(That&#x27;s What You Get) For Lovin&#x27; Me&quot;. They also included the first recording of the song &quot;Darcy Farrow&quot; by Steve Gillette and Tom Campbell, as well as a number of their own compositions.
They performed at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. &quot;Play One More&quot;, their offering of 1965, showed a move toward the electrified folk-like music that was becoming popular with groups like the Byrds and the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful. The title tune used horns to evoke the mariachi style.

In 1967, they released two albums, one recorded for Vanguard, the other for MGM. These two efforts, &quot;So Much For Dreaming&quot; and &quot;Lovin&#x27; Sound&quot;, were far less dynamic presentations.

From 1970 to 1975, Ian Tyson hosted &quot;The Ian Tyson Show&quot; on CTV, known as &quot;Nashville North&quot; in its first season. Sylvia Tyson and the Great Speckled Bird appeared often on the series.

====Country rock pioneers====
They moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where they recorded two albums; one to fulfill the terms of their Vanguard contract, the other to supply MGM with a second (and last) album for that label. The albums can be defined as early country rock music; &quot;Nashville&quot; for Vanguard was cut in February 1968, one month before the Byrds&#x27; &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;, widely considered the first collaboration of rock and Nashville players. Three of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Basement Tapes&quot; songs are included on their Nashville albums; most of the rest were written by Ian or Sylvia.

In 1969, Ian &amp; Sylvia formed the country rock group Great Speckled Bird. In addition to participating in the cross-Canada rock-and-roll rail tour Festival Express, they recorded the album &quot;Great Speckled Bird&quot; for the short-lived Ampex label. Produced by Todd Rundgren, the record failed when Ampex was unable to establish widespread distribution. Thousands of copies never left the warehouse, and it has become a much sought-after collector&#x27;s item. Initially, the album artist was given as Great Speckled Bird but later copies had a sticker saying that it featured the duo.

Ian &amp; Sylvia&#x27;s last two albums were recorded on Columbia Records. The first, 1971&#x27;s &quot;Ian and Sylvia&quot; (not to be confused with their 1962 self-titled release) consists largely of mainstream country-flavored songs. This album was released on CD, with extra tracks, as &quot;The Beginning of the End&quot; in 1996. Their second Columbia record, 1972&#x27;s &quot;You Were on My Mind&quot;, featured a later incarnation of Great Speckled Bird. The songs range from hard country rock to middle-of-the-road country material. Neither of the Columbia albums sold well. They were eventually combined and released as 1974&#x27;s &quot;The Best of Ian and Sylvia&quot;.

In 1972, Ian &amp; Sylvia performed the song &quot;Let Her Alone&quot; for Walt Disney Productions&#x27; live-action drama &quot;Run, Cougar, Run&quot;. Ian also served as the film&#x27;s narrator.

By 1975, Ian &amp; Sylvia had stopped performing together and soon afterwards were divorced. Their final appearance as a duo was in May 1975 at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto.

===Post-divorce===
After their marriage ended in 1975, Ian returned to Southern Alberta to farm and train horses, but continued his musical career. His autobiography &quot;The Long Trail: My Life in the West&quot; was published in 2010.

Sylvia wrote, performed, and involved herself in various projects. In recent years, she has been recording new material, working as a member of the group Quartette, and performing a one-woman show titled &quot;River Road and Other Stories&quot;.

The duo&#x27;s son, Clay Tyson (Clayton Dawson Tyson, born 1966), is also a musician and recording artist.

On August 16, 1986, folk singers who had recorded or written Ian and Sylvia songs, reunited for a concert that was filmed for the CBC. The group at the Kingswood Music Theatre in Maple, Ontario included Gordon Lightfoot, Judy Collins, Emmylou Harris, and Murray McLauchlan.

Ian &amp; Sylvia sang their signature song &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot; at the 50th anniversary of the Mariposa Folk Festival on July 11, 2010, in Orillia, Ontario.

==Honours==
In 1992, they were inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.

In 1994, they were both made Members of the Order of Canada.

In 2005, an extensive Canadian Broadcasting Corporation poll on the CBC-Radio program &quot;50 Tracks: The Canadian Version&quot; named &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot; to be the greatest Canadian song of all time. Artists Neil Young, Johnny Cash, Sarah McLachlan, Harry Belafonte, and Bob Dylan recorded this song.

In 2006, they were both inducted into the Mariposa Hall of Fame; the duo performed a song together at that time, long after they had gone their separate ways. Back in 1961, Ian and Sylvia had headlined at the Mariposa Folk Festival.

In a poll of the Western Writers of America, two Ian &amp; Sylvia songs, &quot;Someday Soon&quot; and &quot;Summer Wages&quot; (both written by Tyson), were selected among the &quot;Top 100 Western Songs&quot; of all time.

Ian Tyson was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame in 1989. Sylvia Tyson was inducted in 2003.

In July 2019, it was announced that Ian Tyson and Sylvia Tyson would be inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame individually, not as a duo. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation stated that its 1964 hit &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot; &quot;has been deemed one of the most influential songs in Canadian history&quot;. The report also referenced the song &quot;You Were on My Mind&quot;, written by Sylvia Tyson, as well as her four albums from 1975 to 1980.

<doc id="506389" wikidata="Q2920230" url="?curid=506389" title="Disney's Grand Californian Hotel &amp; Spa">
<text>Disney&#x27;s Grand Californian Hotel &amp; Spa is a hotel located at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. The hotel was constructed as part of a major expansion of the Disneyland Resort in 2001. It was constructed and operated by The Walt Disney Company. The hotel was designed in the American Craftsman style of architecture. It also features a Disney Vacation Club wing that opened on September 23, 2009. The hotel has a private entrance to Disney California Adventure Park. In 2017, Disney remodeled the rooms, along with the lobby.

== Description ==
The hotel was designed by architect Peter Dominick of 4240 Architecture Inc. (formerly part of Urban Design Group Inc.). It has 948 rooms, in addition to 44 suites and 71 villas.

Craftsman style buildings often use garden themes, which was Peter Dominick&#x27;s inspiration for the hotel&#x27;s forest theme. The reception hall is based on the interior of the Swedenborgian Church in San Francisco, increased in scale to accommodate the large reception desk. The central lobby has a large fireplace and arching beams overhead, and is furnished with chairs and sofas arranged around small coffee tables.

Many of the items found throughout the hotel have been crafted by modern practitioners of the Arts and Crafts style, and some early Roycroft items are on display in the lobby.

Some of the hotel&#x27;s rooms are tributes to various Craftsman-era architects and designers such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Charles Rennie MacKintosh, and the Gladding, McBean Company.

Its name is based on Disney&#x27;s Grand Floridian Resort &amp; Spa, its sister resort and Walt Disney World&#x27;s flagship resort hotel.

=== History ===
The hotel opened on January 2, 2001, as a part of the parks expansion for Disneyland Resort.

On September 18, 2007, the Disneyland Resort announced an expansion of Disney&#x27;s Grand Californian Hotel &amp; Spa that would increase accommodations by more than 30 percent and include the first Disney Vacation Club villas in Anaheim.

The expansion on the hotel&#x27;s south side added more than 200 hotel rooms and 50 two-bedroom equivalent vacation villas and marked the West Coast debut of Disney Vacation Club, Disney&#x27;s vacation ownership program. During this expansion and renovation, a swimming pool was added as well as a 300 space underground parking garage. Peter Dominick designed the ambitious expansion to complement the existing hotel. The project was completed in September 2009.

With the completion of this major expansion, Disney&#x27;s Grand Californian Hotel &amp; Spa became the fourth-largest hotel in Orange County.

==== The Villas at Disney&#x27;s Grand Californian Hotel ====
The Disney Vacation Club villas, added as part of the hotel&#x27;s expansion, include kitchens, living and dining areas and other home-like amenities. The guest rooms feature the same decor as the hotel rooms in the original structure and continue the Californian Craftsman motif.

== Napa Rose ==
Napa Rose is a restaurant in Disney&#x27;s Grand Californian Hotel &amp; Spa that opened in 2001 as part of Disney&#x27;s expansion of its Anaheim property from one theme park (Disneyland) into a multi-park resort complex. It specializes in California cuisine and has a Napa Valley wine theme. The restaurant&#x27;s design is inspired by Scottish Art Nouveau designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh.

Napa Rose&#x27;s head chef, Andrew Sutton, formerly of the Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek&#x27;s restaurant in Dallas, was hired from Auberge du Soleil in Napa Valley, and former general manager and sommelier Michael Jordan was hired from the Patina Restaurant Group. Disney hired Sutton and Jordan in order to raise the credibility of its food and wine program. The restaurant has won multiple awards from different organizations, such as the Wine Spectator, Zagat, The Southern California Restaurant Writers and the Orange County Business Journal.

== Craftsman Bar &amp; Grill ==
Craftsman Bar &amp; Grill, formerly known as White Water Snacks, is the refurbished quick service restaurant located in Disney&#x27;s Grand Californian Hotel &amp; Spa. Initially opened in 2001 with the hotel, it re-opened in 2019 under this new name with an expanded pool deck and revised menu.

== Incident ==

At about 3:00 am on December 28, 2005, a Christmas tree in the main lobby caught fire after electric maintenance workers replaced lights on the tree. All 2,300 guests at the hotel were evacuated within four minutes. The fire was contained by the hotel&#x27;s sprinkler system and by the Anaheim Fire Department. Two guests were treated for minor injuries, one of which was a severe headache. Guests were returned to their rooms by 7:00 am.

<doc id="506393" wikidata="Q153075" url="?curid=506393" title="Grolsch Brewery">
<text>Koninklijke Grolsch N.V. (; &quot;Royal Grolsch&quot;), known simply as Grolsch, is a Dutch brewery founded in 1615 by Willem Neerfeldt in Groenlo. In 1895, the de Groen family bought the brewery. They had started their own brewery in Enschede in the early 19th century and held a significant stake until 2007. Today the main brewery is in Enschede.

It was awarded the &quot;Koninklijk&quot; (Royal) title in 1995. Grolsch became part of the SABMiller group in 2008.

As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller, the company sold Grolsch to Asahi Breweries in 2016.

==History==
The Grolsch brewery was founded in 1615 in Groenlo. The city of Groenlo was then known as Grolle, hence the name Grolsch, meaning &#x27;of Grolle&#x27;. Grolsch is best known for its 5% abv pale lager, Grolsch Premium Pilsner. The brewery was first operated by Willem Neerfeldt. Neerfeldt&#x27;s son-in-law, Peter Sanford Kuyper, later took over. Grolsch was, as of February 2006, the second largest brewer in the Netherlands (after Heineken) with annual production of 320 million litres. The domestic market comprises 51% of total production.

===Change of ownership===
On 19 November 2007, the board of Royal Grolsch NV accepted an €816 million offer for the company by SABMiller. The takeover was completed with the delisting of Grolsch&#x27;s shares on 20 March 2008.

SABMiller subsequently sold the company to Anheuser-Busch InBev. Further, in April 2016, the latter accepted Asahi Group Holdings Ltd.&#x27;s offer to buy not only Grolsch but also the Peroni and Meantime beer brands for €2.55 billion (US $2.9 billion).

==International market==
Grolsch is the 21st largest provider of beer in the world, and is available in 70 countries. Grolsch focuses primarily on the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. These primary markets make up 78% of Grolsch&#x27;s international sales (by volume). Grolsch Premium Pilsner is by far the most important beer in its international profile, while its Amsterdam brand grew by 40% in 2006, primarily in Russia and France.

===United Kingdom===
For 25 years, Grolsch Premium Pilsner was brewed under licence in the UK by Grolsch (UK) Ltd., a joint venture with Coors Brewers Ltd until November 2019. It was no longer available in the UK after Asahi ended the JV. However, it was reintroduced into the UK in late October 2020 with a lower ABV recipe at 4%, which was then further reduced to 3.4% ABV in 2024 in a cost saving exercise.

===Canada===
In 2002, the Canadian Sleeman Breweries purchased the rights to distribute Grolsch in Canada.

===United States===
In 2006, Grolsch ended its five-year relationship with importer United States Beverage, LLC, and signed a distribution agreement with Anheuser-Busch effective 1 April 2006, which was terminated following the SABMiller acquisition as A-B did not want to promote a rival&#x27;s product.

Five beers are featured in the US market: Grolsch Lager, Grolsch Amber, Grolsch Blonde and Grolsch Light. Grolsch Premium Pilsner is available in a wide variety of serving sizes, including swing-top bottles, mini-kegs and half-barrels. The others have only been confirmed available in 6 pack, 12 oz bottles.

==The brewery==

Though built as a secondary facility, the Enschede brewery over the years became the main producer of Grolsch. This brewery was heavily damaged during a fireworks explosion on 13 May 2000. The brewery in Groenlo has closed and a new brewery in Boekelo, near Enschede (replacing both the Groenlo and the old Enschede affiliate) was opened in 2004.

To underline their ties with Enschede and the whole region Grolsch signed a deal with professional football club FC Twente to sponsor their stadium starting the 2008–2009 season. The stadium is named De Grolsch Veste (Grolsch Fortress), a reference to the history of fortified city Grol, the hometown of Grolsch.

==Price fixing conviction==
On 18 April 2007, the European Commission imposed fines on Heineken International of €219.3m, Grolsch of €31.65m and Bavaria of €22.85m for operating a price-fixing cartel in the Netherlands, totalling €273.7m. InBev, (formerly Interbrew), escaped without a penalty because it provided &quot;decisive information&quot; about the cartel which operated between 1996 and 1999 with others in the EU market. The brewers controlled 95% of the Dutch market, with Heineken claiming a half and the three others 15% each. 

Former EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said, at the time, that she was &quot;very disappointed&quot; that the collusion took place at the very highest (boardroom) level. She added, Heineken, Grolsch, Bavaria and InBev tried to cover their tracks by using code names and abbreviations for secret meetings to carve up the market for beer sold to supermarkets, hotels, restaurants and cafes. The price fixing extended to cheaper own-brand labels and rebates for bars.

==Beers==

Grolsch produces a range of mainly pale lager beers from alcohol free to 11.6% abv:

* Grolsch Premium Pilsner - Known internationally as Grolsch Premium Lager, is its flagship beer and comprises 95% of all sales. It contains 5.0% abv.
* Grolsch Premium Blond - Blond is a lighter version of the Pilsner, with 30% fewer calories and 4% abv.
* Grolsch Premium Light - A light version of the Pilsner with 3.7% abv, available only in the United States.
* Grolsch Premium Weizen - A traditional hefeweizen brewed according to the Reinheitsgebot. It finishes soft and wet and has 5.5% abv.

Speciality brews:
* Grolsch Premium Lentebok (6.5% abv)
* Grolsch Premium Herfstbok (6.5% abv)
* Grolsch Premium Malt (alcohol free)
* Grolsch Oud Bruin (2.5% abv)
* Grolsch Het Kanon (11.6% abv)
* Grolsch Premium 2.5 (2.5% abv)
* Grolsch Lemon 2.5 (2.5% abv)
* Grolsch Cranberry Rosé (5.5% abv)
* Grolsch Radler (2% abv)

Grolsch also produces the Amsterdam brand of low-priced, mainly strong lagers for the European market. It is also sold in Singapore and Australia.

* Amsterdam Maximator (11.6% abv)
* Amsterdam Navigator (8.4% abv)
* Amsterdam Explorator (6.8% abv)
* Amsterdam Mariner (4.8% abv)
* Amsterdam Liberator (alcohol free)

==Bottle design==
===Beugel===

In addition to the &#x27;new&#x27; bottle, Grolsch uses a distinctively shaped bottle for some of its products, known as &quot;de beugel&quot; or &#x27;&quot;swingtop&quot;&#x27;. Bottles of this type use a flip-top cap, eliminating the need for an opener. The brown domestic bottle contains 450ml, which is over one-third more than the capacity of the average Dutch beer bottle, while the green export bottle is slightly larger, at 467 mL. In 2008, the brewery introduced a slimmer design that is a consistent 450ml for both the domestic market and export. The new bottles can be opened by hand, using a lever at the side of the bottleneck. The label is applied over the lever in order to make any tampering evident. The top used to be made of porcelain, but is now made of plastic. Bottles with porcelain tops are still in circulation in the Netherlands. They are popular with homebrewers, as they are very robust and can easily be sealed by hand without the expense of new crown seals.

Occasionally, Grolsch will use different color bottles, depending on the brew, e.g. the bottle for blonde lager is yellow, while the 2.5 lemon variety came in a clear 250 mL bottle.

===The new bottle===
In 2007, Grolsch also started using green bottles for the home market. Grolsch was the first major brewery to stop using the brown refillable bottles which were used by nearly every brewery in the Netherlands. The new green bottles have the Grolsch logo marked in the glass and come in a new package. The label is now placed higher at the neck of the bottle, and the bottles contain 10% more beer (now 330ml). The new bottle was introduced through the slogan &#x27;Bier mag weer gezien worden&#x27;, which translates roughly as, &quot;Beer that is fit to be seen again.&quot; In November 2014, the brewery changed to new, smaller bottles that contain 300 mL for Grolsch Premium Pilsner, Grolsch Stender, Grolsch Radler and Kornuit.

<doc id="506400" wikidata="Q671838" url="?curid=506400" title="Fairey Barracuda">
<text>The Fairey Barracuda was a British carrier-borne torpedo and dive bomber designed by Fairey Aviation. It was the first aircraft of this type operated by the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) of the Royal Navy to be fabricated entirely from metal.

The Barracuda was developed as a replacement for the Fairey Albacore biplanes. Development was protracted due to the original powerplant intended for the type, the Rolls-Royce Exe, being cancelled. It was replaced by the less powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. On 7 December 1940, the first Fairey prototype conducted its maiden flight. Early testing revealed it to be somewhat underpowered. The definitive Barracuda Mk II had a more powerful model of the Merlin engine, while later versions were powered by the larger and even more powerful Rolls-Royce Griffon engine. The type was ordered in bulk to equip the FAA. In addition to Fairey&#x27;s production line, Barracudas were also built by Blackburn Aircraft, Boulton Paul and Westland Aircraft.

The type participated in numerous carrier operations during the conflict, in the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and the Pacific Ocean against the Germans, Italians and Japanese respectively during the latter half of the war. One of the Barracuda&#x27;s most noteworthy engagements was Operation Tungsten, a mass attack upon the German battleship on 3 April 1944. In addition to the FAA, the Barracuda was also used by the Royal Air Force, the Royal Canadian Navy, the Dutch Naval Aviation Service and the French Air Force. After its withdrawal from service during the 1950s, no intact examples of the Barracuda were preserved despite its once-large numbers, although the Fleet Air Arm Museum has ambitions to assemble a full reproduction.

==Design and development==
===Background===
In 1937 the British Air Ministry issued Specification S.24/37, which sought a monoplane torpedo bomber to satisfy &quot;Operational Requirement OR.35&quot;. The envisaged aircraft was a three-seater that would possess a high payload capacity and a high maximum speed. Six submissions were received by the Air Ministry, from which the designs of Fairey and Supermarine (Type 322) were selected and a pair of prototypes of each design were ordered. On 7 December 1940, the first Fairey prototype conducted its maiden flight. The Supermarine Type 322 did not fly until 1943 and, as the Barracuda was already in production by then, its development did not progress further.

The Barracuda was a shoulder-wing cantilever monoplane It had a retractable undercarriage and non-retracting tailwheel. The hydraulically-operated main landing gear struts were of an &quot;L&quot; shape which retracted into a recess in the side of the fuselage and the wing, with the wheels within the wing. A flush arrestor hook was fitted directly ahead of the tail wheel. It was operated by a crew of three, who were seated in a tandem arrangement under a continuous-glazed canopy. The pilot had a sliding canopy while the other two crew members&#x27; canopy was hinged. The two rear-crew had alternate locations in the fuselage, the navigator&#x27;s position having bay windows below the wings for downward visibility. The wings were furnished with large Fairey-Youngman flaps which doubled as dive brakes. Originally fitted with a conventional tail, flight tests suggested that stability would be improved by mounting the elevator higher, similar to a T-tail, an arrangement on the second prototype. For carrier stowage the wings folded back horizontally at the roots; the small vertical protrusions on the upper wingtips held hooks that attached to the tailplane.
The Barracuda had originally been intended to be powered by the Rolls-Royce Exe X block, sleeve valve engine, but production of this powerplant was beset with difficulties and eventually abandoned, which in turn delayed the prototype&#x27;s trials. It was decided to adopt the lower-powered 12-cylinder V-type Rolls-Royce Merlin Mark 30 engine [] to drive a three-bladed de Havilland propeller and the prototypes eventually flew with this configuration. Experiences gained from the prototype&#x27;s flight testing, as well as operations with the first production aircraft, called &quot;Barracuda Mk I&quot;, revealed the aircraft to be underpowered which apparently resulted from the weight of extra equipment that had been added since the initial design. Only 23 Barracuda Mk Is were constructed, including five by Westland Aircraft. These aircraft were used for trials and conversion training.

Carrier landing the Barracuda was relatively straightforward due to a combination of the powerful flaps/airbrakes fitted to the aircraft and good visibility from the cockpit. Retracting the air-brakes at high speeds while simultaneously applying rudder would cause a sudden change in trim, which could throw the aircraft into an inverted dive. Incidents of this occurrence proved fatal on at least five occasions during practice torpedo runs; once the problem was identified, appropriate pilot instructions were issued prior to the aircraft entering carrier service.

===Further development===
The definitive version of the aircraft was the Barracuda Mk II which had the more powerful Merlin 32 driving a four-bladed propeller. A total of 1,688 Mk IIs were manufactured by several companies, including Fairey (at Stockport and Ringway) (675), Blackburn Aircraft (700), Boulton Paul (300), and Westland (13). The Barracuda Mk II carried the metric wavelength ASV II (Air to Surface Vessel) radar, with the Yagi-Uda antennae carried above the wings. The Barracuda Mk III was an ASW Mk II; changes included the replacement of the metric wavelength ASV set by a centimetric ASV III variant, the scanner for which was housed in a blister under the rear fuselage. 852 Barracuda Mk IIIs were eventually produced, 460 by Fairey and 392 by Boulton Paul.
The Barracuda Mk IV never left the drawing board. The next and final variant was the &quot;Barracuda Mk V&quot;, in which the Merlin was replaced with the larger Rolls-Royce Griffon engine. The increased power and torque of the Griffon required other changes, which included the enlargement of the fin and increased wing span with tips being clipped. The first Barracuda Mk V, which was converted from a Mk II, did not fly until 16 November 1944. Fairey had only built 37 aircraft before the war in Europe was over.

Early Merlin 30-powered Barracuda Mk 1s were deemed to be underpowered and suffered from a poor rate of climb but once airborne the type proved relatively easy to fly. During October 1941, trials of the Barracuda Mk 1 were conducted at RAF Boscombe Down, which found that the aircraft possessed an overall weight of when equipped with a torpedo. At this weight the Mk 1 had a maximum speed of at , a climb to took 19.5 minutes, with a maximum climb rate of at and a service ceiling of .
The later Barracuda Mk II had the more powerful Merlin 32, providing a increase in power. During late 1942 testing of the Mk II was performed at RAF Boscombe Down. When flown by naval test pilot Lieutenant Roy Sydney Baker-Falkner at it achieved a climb to in 13.6 minutes, with a maximum climb rate of at and an effective ceiling of . During June 1943, further testing at Boscombe Down by Baker-Falkner demonstrated a maximum range while carrying either a torpedo or a bomb , of and a practical range of , while carrying 6 × bombs reduced the range to and , respectively.

During the earlier part of its service life the Barracuda suffered a fairly high rate of unexplained fatal crashes, often involving experienced pilots. Baker-Falkner was brought in to address the issues and boost morale among operational squadrons. During 1945 the cause was traced to small leaks developing in the hydraulic system. The most common point for such a leak to happen was at the point of entry to the pilot&#x27;s pressure gauge and was situated such that the resulting spray was directed straight into the pilot&#x27;s face. The hydraulic fluid contained ether and as the aircraft were only rarely equipped with oxygen masks and few aircrew wore them below anyway, the pilot quickly became unconscious during such a leak, inevitably leading to a crash. At the end of May 1945 an Admiralty order was issued that required all examples of the type to be fitted with oxygen as soon as possible and for pilots to use the system at all times.

==Operational history==

===British service===
The first Barracudas entered operational service on 10 January 1943 with 827 Squadron of the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) under the command of Lieutenant Commander Roy Sydney Baker-Falkner, the former Admiralty test pilot at RAF Boscombe Down, who were deployed in the North Atlantic. Eventually a total of 24 front-line FAA squadrons were equipped with Barracudas. While intended to principally function as a torpedo bomber, by the time the Barracuda arrived in quantity relatively little Axis-aligned shipping remained, so it was instead largely used as a dive-bomber. From 1944 onwards, the Barracuda Mk II was accompanied in service by radar-equipped, but otherwise similar, Barracuda Mk IIIs; these were typically used to conduct anti-submarine operations.

The Royal Air Force (RAF) also operated the Barracuda Mk II. During 1943 the first of the RAF&#x27;s aircraft were assigned to No. 567 Sqn., based at RAF Detling. During 1944 similar models went to various squadrons, including 667 Sqn. at RAF Gosport, 679 Sqn. at RAF Ipswich and 691 Sqn. at RAF Roborough. Between March and July 1945 all of the RAF&#x27;s Barracudas were withdrawn from service.

During July 1943, the Barracuda first saw action with 810 Squadron aboard off the coast of Norway; shortly thereafter, the squadron was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea to support the landings at Salerno, a critical element of the Allied invasion of Italy. During the following year, the Barracuda entered service in the Pacific Theatre.

As the only British naval aircraft in service stressed for dive bombing following the retirement of the Blackburn Skua the Barracuda participated in Operation Tungsten, an attack on the while it was moored in Kåfjord, Alta, Norway. On 3 April 1944, Strike Leader Roy Sydney Baker-Falkner led two Naval Air Wings with a total of 42 aircraft dispatched from British carriers and scored 14 direct hits on &quot;Tirpitz&quot; using a combination of and bombs for the loss of one bomber. This attack damaged &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, killing 122 of her crew and injuring 316, as well as disabling the ship for over two months during the critical period leading up to the Normandy invasion. However, the slow speed of the Barracudas contributed to the failure of the subsequent Operation Mascot and Operation Goodwood attacks on &quot;Tirpitz&quot; during July and August of that year, but were effective as diversionary tactics while the Normandy landings in Operation Overlord were underway.

On 21 April 1944 Barracudas of No 827 Squadron aboard &quot;Illustrious&quot; began operations against Japanese forces. The type participated in air raids on Sabang in Sumatra, known as Operation Cockpit. In the Pacific theatre, the Barracuda&#x27;s performance was considerably reduced by the prevailing high temperatures; reportedly, its combat radius in the Pacific was reduced by as much as 30%. This diminished performance was a factor in the decision to re-equip the torpedo bomber squadrons aboard the fleet carriers of the British Pacific Fleet with American-built Grumman Avengers.

In the Pacific, a major problem hindering the Barracuda was the need to fly over Indonesian mountain ranges to strike at targets located on the eastern side of Java, which necessitated a high-altitude performance that the Barracuda&#x27;s low-altitude-rated Merlin 32 engine with its single-stage supercharger could not effectively provide. Carrying the maximum underwing bomb loads resulted in additional drag, which further reduced performance. The Light Fleet Carriers of the 11th ACS (which joined the BPF in June 1945) were all equipped with a single Barracuda and single Corsair squadron. By Victory over Japan Day, the BPF had a total of five Avenger and four Barracuda squadrons embarked on its carriers.

A number of Barracudas participated in trial flights, during which several innovations were tested, including RATOG rockets for boosting takeoff performance (which ended up being regularly used when operating off escort carriers at high weights), and a braking propeller, which slowed the aircraft by reversing the blade pitch.

Following the end of the conflict, the Barracuda was relegated to secondary roles, for the most part being used as a trainer aircraft. The type continued to be operated by FAA squadrons up until the mid-1950s, by which time the type were withdrawn entirely in favour of the Avengers.

===Canadian service===
On 24 January 1946, the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) took delivery of 12 radar-equipped Barracuda Mk II aircraft; this was a Canadian designation, in British service these aircraft were referred to as the Barracuda Mk. III. The first acquired aircraft were assigned to the newly-formed 825 Sqn. aboard aircraft carrier HMCS &quot;Warrior&quot;. The majority of Canadian aircraft mechanics had served during the war and had been deployed on numerous British aircraft carriers, notably and which, along with some Canadian pilots, the RCN crewed and operated on behalf of the RN. During 1948, the &quot;Warrior&quot; was paid off and returned to Britain along with the Barracuda aircraft.

==Surviving aircraft==
Over 2,500 Barracudas were delivered to the FAA, more than any other type ordered by the Royal Navy by then. Unlike numerous other aircraft of its era, none were retained for posterity and no complete examples of the aircraft exist today. Since the early 1970s, the Fleet Air Arm Museum has been collecting Barracuda components from a wide variety of sources throughout the British Isles to rebuild one.

In 2010, help was sought from the team rebuilding Donald Campbell&#x27;s record-breaking speed boat, &quot;Bluebird&quot;, as the processes and skills involved were related to those needed to recreating the aircraft from the crashed remains, so between May 2013 and February 2015 &#x27;The Barracuda Project&#x27; operated as a sister project to the Bluebird rebuild. The tail section of &quot;LS931&quot; was reconstructed using only original material. During September 2014, the wreckage of a rear fuselage was delivered to the workshops to undergo the same processes. In February 2015, the Barracuda sections were transported back to the Fleet Air Arm Museum, where the work continues.

During 2018 the wreckage of a Fairey Barracuda was discovered by engineers surveying the seabed for an electricity cable between England and France. According to Wessex Archaeology it is the only example of the type to have ever been found in one piece and represents the last of its kind in the UK. During 2019 the wreckage was recovered and it was intended to be reassembled and transported to the Fleet Air Arm Museum for preservation.

As of November 2023, the Fleet Air Arm Museum is running a project, including online content to rebuild a Barracuda based on &quot;DP872&quot;, a Barracuda Mk II built by Boulton Paul in 1943. The project is expected to take ten years and although based on &quot;DP872&quot;, will use parts from at least four other aircraft, &quot;LS931&quot;, &quot;DR306&quot;, &quot;MD956&quot; and &quot;PM870&quot;.

&quot;DP872&quot; crashed on 29 August 1944 shortly after takeoff from RNAS Maydown (HMS Shrike) in Northern Ireland. The recovery crew arrived promptly but found the aircraft already sinking in a bog, Blackhead Moss, about from the airfield and were unable to recover the crew of three before the aircraft sank. The remains of the aircraft were recovered in 1971 and stored at the Fleet Air Arm Museum store in Wroughton, Wiltshire.

<text>The Toronto Zoo is a zoo located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Encompassing , the Toronto Zoo is the largest zoo in Canada averaging around 1.2 million visitors a year. The zoo is divided into seven zoogeographic regions: Indo-Malaya, Africa, Americas, Tundra Trek, Australasia, Eurasia, and the Canadian Domain. Some animals are displayed indoors in pavilions and outdoors in what would be their naturalistic environments, with viewing at many levels. The zoo also has areas such as the Kids Zoo, Waterside Theatre, and Splash Island. The zoo has one of the most taxonomically diverse collection of animals on display of any zoo worldwide and is currently home to over 3,000 animals (including invertebrates and fish) representing over 300 species. The zoo is open to the public every day of the year.

The zoo is a corporation owned by the City of Toronto government. Founded by Hugh A. Crothers and business partner, John Cameron Egan, who became the first Chairman of the Metro Toronto Zoological Society in 1966, the zoo opened on August 15, 1974, as the Metropolitan Toronto Zoo. The word &quot;Metropolitan&quot; was dropped from its name when the individual municipalities that made up the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto were amalgamated into the current city in 1998. The zoo is located near the Rouge River on the western border of Rouge Park in the city&#x27;s east end district of Scarborough.

== History ==
=== Predecessor ===
Around 1880, businessman Harry L. Piper (1839–1921) established a Zoological and Acclimatization Society (also as Toronto Zoological Garden) and opened a zoological garden at Old Post Office Lane at Toronto Street north of King Street East, then in 1881 to a lot at Front Street and York Street next to the Queen&#x27;s Hotel and finally to the eastern end of the Exhibition Grounds in 1885. Piper was also Alderman for St. John&#x27;s Ward from 1877 to 1880 and 1883 to 1888.

In 1888, the Riverdale Zoo opened in Toronto, as a typical example of a zoo during this time, with animals displayed as curiosities in dark cages and cramped enclosures. Animals for Piper&#x27;s zoo moved to this site.

In 1963, a private citizen&#x27;s brief to build a new zoo was introduced by Hugh Crothers to the Chairman of the Council of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, William Allen. Allen asked Crothers to head up a committee to investigate the feasibility of a new zoo. By 1966, a group of eleven people became The Metro Toronto Zoological Society with Crothers as the first chairman.

Original plans were to have the park be located in the Leaside area, but the site was later used to create the E.T. Seton Park and the Ontario Science Centre. In 1966, Mr. Crothers and the 10 other citizens met at City Hall to form the &quot;Metropolitan Toronto Zoological Society&quot;. In 1967, the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (Metro Toronto) approved the Rouge Park site in Scarborough for a new zoo. The following year, a feasibility study on the new zoo was produced by architect Raymond Moriyama. In 1969, a master plan was created by Johnson Sustronk Weinstein and Associates that was approved by the Zoological Society. Construction of the new zoo began in 1970. On August 15, 1974, the &quot;Metropolitan Toronto Zoo&quot; was open to the public. The zoo increased from the original Riverdale Zoo&#x27;s to , and is now one of the largest zoos in the world. The Zoo introduced some designs to enhance the public&#x27;s viewing experience and the animals&#x27; living comfort. Animals were displayed in naturalized environments and grouped according to their zoogeographic region. The old zoo was converted into an urban farm called Riverdale Farm, which opened in 1978.

=== Since opening ===

In 1976, the Zoo opened the &quot;Canadian Domain Ride&quot;, a monorail-like automated guideway transit service that travelled into the Zoo&#x27;s Canadian Domain area, located in the Rouge Valley. The ride&#x27;s operations were placed on hold in July 1994 after an accident. The monorail has since been mothballed with many sections becoming overgrown with vegetation. A 2009 study determined it would cost upwards of $800,000 to return the infrastructure to use and upgrade it to current standards. A fundraising drive was started in 2010 and has since raised $1.15 million. In the interim, the current Zoomobile uses five (4-car set) Chance Coach Sunliner trams.

Between 1980 and 1984, several new exhibits were added to the zoo, including snow leopards, gaur, a children&#x27;s zoo known as Littlefootland, and new indoor habitats for the zoo&#x27;s African elephants and Indian rhinoceroses, as well as the official opening of the Zoomobile.

In 1985, Qing Qing and Quan Quan – a pair of giant pandas, on loan for three months from the People&#x27;s Republic of China, were displayed at the Zoo. The Zoo broke all previous attendance records as thousands of visitors came to see these rare animals. Over the years, the Zoo has presented other rare or unusual animals, including golden monkeys (1986), koalas (1988, 1996, 2002), Tasmanian devils (the late 1970s until 1998), and white lions (1995, 2012 onwards).

In 1987, the zoo rebranded the South American Waterfall area as the Maya Temple Ruin exhibits, featuring some architectural decor. Animals such as capybaras, jaguars and spider monkeys remained while llamas and similar animals were relocated. In 1988, the zoo completed new reptile exhibits in the Australasia Pavilion, the spotted-necked otter exhibit in the Africa Pavilion, and the Primate Wing in the Americas Pavilion.

The Malayan Woods Pavilion opened in 1993. The Sumatran tigers arrived in 1994. Naked mole-rats went on exhibit in 1996. Komodo dragons become a feature exhibit in 1997.

In 1997, zoo workers went on strike for nine weeks, however, the zoo remained open. After the strike, they signed a minimum compliment contract.

In 1998, with the amalgamation of the individual municipalities that made up Metro Toronto, the Zoo was officially renamed the &quot;Toronto Zoo.&quot; That same year, the Zoo opened the Africa Savanna, the largest expansion in its history.

==== 2000s ====

In 2001, the zoo remodeled half of the Africa Pavilion into the Gorilla Rainforest, featuring the world&#x27;s largest indoor habitat for western lowland gorillas, as well as a giant fish tank for Lake Malawi cichlids. The zoo&#x27;s Splash Island, an educationally themed water play area, opened in 2002. This was followed by an open-air amphitheatre in 2003 and the Kids Zoo in 2004.

While the SARS outbreak in 2003 had a devastating effect on the tourism industry in Toronto, the Zoo fared well with local residents supporting the zoo by visiting often. The Zoo&#x27;s attendance has recovered well with many record-breaking annual attendance numbers since then, with the exception of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In November 2006, the Toronto Zoo temporarily closed the Australasia Pavilion for redevelopment. The pavilion underwent two years of construction, resulting in new exhibits including a Great Barrier Reef area in the location of the former Edge of Night area. The Great Barrier Reef exhibit consists of a large long community tank featuring brownbanded bamboo sharks, damselfish, and triggerfish. Lionfish were also added, as well as enlarged seahorse tanks, sea anemones and moon jellyfish. The exhibit opened on May 16, 2008, alongside the reopening of the Australasia Pavilion.

In May 2007, &quot;Dinosaurs Alive&quot; opened, which featured 18 animated dinosaur models and life-size skeleton replicas. It featured the largest T-Rex model in North America. This exhibit was enjoyed by over 600,000 visitors and was included with zoo admission. The exhibit closed in October 2007. 

On August 21, 2007, the polar bear, llama, Dall sheep and mara exhibits were closed for the construction of the new Tundra Trek area. Tundra Trek featured new exhibits for the polar bears, reindeer, and Arctic wolves, as well as new additions to the zoo, such as Arctic foxes, snow geese and snowy owls. Returning to the zoo to take up residence in the new polar bear exhibit were three orphaned polar bears initially raised at the zoo and named by the community: Aurora, Nikita, and Inukshuk. The Tundra Trek opened on August 1, 2009.

On May 16, 2008, &quot;Stingray Bay&quot; opened for the first time. This interactive exhibit allowed the public to touch, feel, and feed live stingrays with their stingers removed. The exhibit returned to the zoo on a regular basis but closed permanently on October 8, 2012, to make room for the Giant Panda Research Center. In September 2008, the Toronto Zoo Board approved a motion to dissolve the Toronto Zoo Foundation and bring fundraising and development in-house. All parties agreed to the transfer of existing donor funds to the Toronto Community Foundation.

On August 15, 2009, the Toronto Zoo celebrated its 35-year anniversary. During that weekend, the public got to learn about some of the zoo&#x27;s oldest residents, including Marg the demoiselle crane and Monty the West African dwarf crocodile. 

On September 9, 2009, the south side of the African Rainforest Pavilion was closed for construction. The pavilion opened in early 2011, with new exhibits for pygmy hippos, red river hogs, an African softshell turtle, and ring-tailed lemurs replacing the mandrills, as well as a variety of exhibits for fish and reptiles.

==== 2010s ====

The Frank Schofield Memorial / Asian Gardens opened the first phase in June 2010 and includes a statue erected in Schofield&#x27;s honour.

On May 21, 2011, the black-footed penguin exhibit opened to the public. This exhibit once housed South African fur seals and was closed in 2010 and modified to house the black-footed penguins. 

In 2011, the city started looking at the process of selling the zoo to a third party after Toronto Mayor Rob Ford claimed there were many interested buyers. This process was short-lived with the city later deciding the zoo will remain an entity of the city.

In April 2012, the zoo lost its accreditation in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums due to a disagreement regarding sending its three elephants to PAWS, an animal sanctuary in California that is not AZA-accredited. The zoo began looking for a new accredited home for its elephants in October 2011, but the Toronto city council voted to send the elephants to California instead, ignoring the recommendations of the zoo&#x27;s professional staff. The zoo re-applied for AZA accreditation in March 2013, and they later returned to the AZA program. The three elephants were transported to the PAWS sanctuary in California on October 16, 2013.

In 2012, on a trade mission to China, it was announced that the Toronto Zoo and the Calgary Zoo would be lent two giant pandas from China for the span of ten years, with the pandas splitting the time equally between the two facilities. The pandas, named Er Shun and Da Mao, arrived at the Toronto Zoo on Monday, March 25, 2013, greeted by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Their exhibit opened on May 18, 2013. The pandas originated from the Chongqing Zoo and Chengdu Panda Base. In October 2015, Er Shun gave birth to twin cubs named Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue. The exhibit closed on March 18, 2018, when the pandas were moved to the Calgary Zoo.

In December 2014, the renovated Eurasia area, renamed the Eurasia Wilds, opened, featuring a new aviary with Eurasian eagle-owls and Steller&#x27;s sea eagles and a new exhibit for the snow leopards.

In April 2016, plans to install a maglev operation to replace the Zoo Domain Ride surfaced. Plans have been confirmed in November 2018 with the consortium (which includes Magna International and Lockheed Martin) paying for construction and the first 15 years of operation.

On May 11, 2017, over 400 employees went on strike, and zoo management decided to close the zoo, due to job security negotiations falling out, though conservation programs continued. During the strike, three snow leopard cubs, two clouded leopard cubs, five cheetah cubs, and three Vancouver Island marmot pups were born. The strike ended on June 15, 2017, after the Union and Zoo Board of Management signed and ratified a four-year agreement.

In December 2019, the zoo opened an after-hours night walk experience called Terra Lumina, in partnership with Montréal-based company Moment Factory. The experience is designed as a hypothetical look into the year 2099, showing positive change having occurred in the world as humanity made changes in the decades between now and then to respect and live in harmony with wildlife, with strong indigenous influences. The experience closed early on March 14, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and resumed on August 14, 2020.

==== 2020s ====

The Toronto Zoo closed to all visitors starting March 14, 2020, due to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. Essential zoo staff remained on-site during the closure to continue caring for the animals. During this closure, a Masai giraffe calf was born. The zoo reopened as a drive-through experience beginning May 23, 2020, and began re-admitting walkthrough guests beginning July 4, 2020, with the drive-through experience continuing to run until October 5, 2020. The zoo closed to visitors once again starting November 23, 2020, due to the second lockdown of the Greater Toronto Area, and reopened June 12, 2021.

The zoo implemented a mandatory COVID-19 vaccine policy starting October 25, 2021, which requires all staff and visitors aged 12 years and older to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and to show their proof-of-vaccination documents to enter the entire Zoo grounds. The zoo closed for a third time on January 5, 2022, due to growing concerns around the COVID-19 Omicron variant, and reopened on February 10, 2022.

In June 2023, the zoo opened an outdoor habitat for the Sumatran orangutans, marking the first time at the zoo that the species would be viewable outside of the Indo-Malaya Pavilion.

In late 2023, extensive renovations on the main entrance began, with plans set for it to become a &quot;Conservation Campus&quot; featuring a new exhibit for the zoo&#x27;s North American river otters as well as updated guest services buildings and research facilities.

On August 15, 2024, the zoo celebrated its 50th anniversary. The zoo took this opportunity to honour several longtime residents, including Puppe the Sumatran orangutan and Charles the Western lowland gorilla, the only two remaining animals from the zoo&#x27;s first year of operation in 1974. A new bronze statue of Charles was unveiled outside of the African Rainforest pavilion as part of the festivities. Charles died from heart failure two months after the festivities at the age of 52.

== Exhibits ==

The Toronto Zoo is divided up into seven different geographic regions. Each region showcases animals and plants from that area of the world.

===Indo-Malaya===

The Indo-Malayan area contains an outdoor area, as well as a pavilion that exhibits plants and animals from South and Southeast Asia. Featured animals in this area include Indian rhinoceroses, babirusas, Indian peafowls, Sumatran orangutans, great hornbills, false gharials, reticulated pythons, Sumatran tigers, clouded leopards, and white-handed gibbons. 

Species previously held in the Indo-Malaya section include gaurs, Malayan tapirs, and golden snub-nosed monkeys.

In 2023, the zoo completed construction on a large outdoor orangutan exhibit on the site of the gaur habitat that allowed for further study of orangutan social behaviours.

===Africa===

Opened in 1998, the African Savanna became the zoo&#x27;s largest expansion in history. The African Savanna combined with the African Rainforest Pavilion encompasses most of the southern third of the zoo. The African Savanna featured species include white lions, Grévy&#x27;s zebras, olive baboons, greater kudus, a white-headed vulture, cheetahs, southern white rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, spotted hyenas, watusi cattle, warthogs, elands, African penguins and Masai giraffes.

The African Rainforest Pavilion holds the world&#x27;s largest indoor gorilla exhibit, home to the zoo&#x27;s artistic silverback Charles from 1974 until his death in 2024, as well as dozens of other African species, including meerkats, red river hogs, dwarf crocodiles, crested porcupines and pygmy hippopotamuses. The south side of the pavilion was completely refurbished in 2011 and showcases ring-tailed lemurs and Aldabra giant tortoises.

Species previously held in the Africa section include African elephants, mandrills, sable antelopes, impalas, caracals, spotted-necked otters, blue wildebeests and South African fur seals.

===Canadian Domain===

The Canadian Domain is situated in the Rouge Valley. The Canadian Domain was built in accompaniment with the Canadian Domain Ride, which exhibited North American animals in their native environment. Featured species in this area include wood bison, cougars, bald eagles, raccoons, and grizzly bears.

Species previously held in the Canadian Domain section include moose, muskox, elks and Canada lynxes.

===Americas===

This area of the zoo houses animals from both North and South America. The Americas Pavilion displays a wide variety of New World monkeys, amphibians, reptiles, fish, and insects. Some of its most popular residents are the blue-and-yellow macaws, white-faced sakis, golden lion tamarins, two-toed sloths, American alligators, black-footed ferrets, and river otters. The Mayan Temple Ruins subsection features capybaras, scarlet macaws, American flamingos, black-handed spider monkeys and jaguars.

Species previously held in the Americas section include beavers, giant Pacific octopuses, prehensile-tailed porcupines, llamas, dall sheep, and maras.

===Tundra Trek===

The Tundra Trek opened in 2009, taking over land that used to feature several Americas exhibits. This area became the sixth region of the zoo, and showcases a variety of Arctic animals including porcupine caribou, polar bears, snow geese, and Arctic wolves. The new state-of-the-art exhibits are larger in order to encourage breeding. Educational theming emphasizes the lives of the Inuit and the effects of climate change on wildlife.

Species previously held in the Tundra Trek section include Arctic foxes and snowy owls.

===Australasia===

The Australasia Pavilion features animals from the Australian mainland, as well as Oceania. Featured species in this area include Western grey kangaroos, red-necked wallabies, short-beaked echidnas, southern hairy-nosed wombats, kookaburras, Victoria crowned pigeons, Fly River turtles, Lau banded iguanas and Komodo dragons. This pavilion once had an &quot;Edge of Night&quot; section to highlight crepuscular and nocturnal marsupials, but this was later converted into the Great Barrier Reef exhibit featuring pot-bellied seahorses, moon jellyfish, lionfish, clown triggerfish, and a long community tank.

Species previously held in the Australasia section include koalas, Matschie&#x27;s tree kangaroos, emus and Tasmanian devils.

===Eurasia Wilds===

Often regarded as the oldest part of the zoo, Eurasia received a large overhaul in 2014. The featured species in this section of the zoo are snow leopards, Amur tigers, West Caucasian tur, mouflon, red pandas, and Bactrian camels. With the area&#x27;s redesign to the Eurasia Wilds Steller&#x27;s sea eagles were added; while several other species are now only viewable from the Zoomobile, including lion-tailed macaques, yak, and the herd of Przewalski&#x27;s horses. 

Species previously held in the Eurasia section include scimitar oryxes, wisents, dholes, chamois, and Japanese macaques.

From May 18, 2013, to March 18, 2018, the area included two giant pandas: Er Shun (female) and Da Mao (male). With the pandas&#x27; arrival, the zoo has refurbished its seasonal attraction area into an extensive educational centre – the Giant Panda Interpretive Centre. In 2014, after her first estrus, Er Shun was artificially inseminated – the first such procedure performed on a panda in Canada. No baby was born in 2014 and it was believed that Er Shun experienced a pseudopregnancy, a phenomenon common in giant pandas. In 2015, Er Shun was again artificially inseminated, resulting in the first birth of giant pandas in Canada. Twin cubs, one male (later named &quot;Jia Panpan&quot; indicating &quot;Canadian Hope&quot;) and one female (&quot;Jia Yueyue&quot; indicating &quot;Canadian Joy&quot;), were born on October 13, 2015. The cubs were raised by Er Shun, with &quot;twin swapping&quot; occurring through the first four months of their lives until they were large and healthy enough that zoo staff were confident of their survival.

===Discovery Zone===
The Discovery Zone is geared towards children by featuring educational themes and exhibits. The most prominent area is a children&#x27;s water park, Splash Island, which features landscaping and themed objects depicting the three states of water. Exhibits are grouped around various themed groups of aquatic animals, including rivers, lakes, and oceans. Waterside Theatre is an open-air enclosure where live demonstrations of a variety of animals are shown, including goats, grey crowned cranes, ravens, macaws, marabou storks and ground hornbills. A third area, the Kids Zoo, consists of a variety of animals that children can interact with, such as ferrets, skunks, and armadillos. The Discovery Zone also hosted Dinosaurs Alive and the Stingray Bay exhibit for their respective durations.

==Conservation==

The Toronto Zoo makes considerable effort to conserve endangered species from around the world with the help of other accredited zoos. Captive breeding is often considered one of the most difficult and elusive rewards of captive animal care, but the Toronto Zoo&#x27;s efforts have been met with much success, and even resulted in the re-introduction of many species.

Some of the conservation initiatives that the Toronto Zoo has participated in are as follows:
*The Toronto Zoo was the first zoo to establish a captive-breeding program for black-footed ferrets with the goal of releasing them back into their wild habitat and, after years of successful breeding, had released more than 120 animals by 2011. This included re-introducing the ferrets, which had been extinct in the wild, to Saskatchewan&#x27;s Grasslands National Park beginning in 2009.
*The zoo has rescued orphaned polar bears from the wild: two in 2001, later named Aurora and Nikita and one in 2003, later named Inukshuk after the Inuit wayfinding landmark.
*In 2008, the Toronto Zoo participated in 2008 Year of the Frog, where researchers were sent to study a deadly fungus causing problems to amphibians and reptiles worldwide.
*The Toronto Zoo has acted and continues to act in the captive breeding, and re-introduction into the wild of critically endangered and otherwise threatened Canadian species, including the Vancouver Island marmot, loggerhead shrike, and Blanding&#x27;s turtle, as well as Great Lakes fishes. The zoo also runs a program for habitat preservation within the Great Lakes Region, focusing on the protection of endemic species of freshwater mussels. In the past, the zoo contributed heavily to increasing the numbers of threatened species, including the wood bison and the trumpeter swan.
*The Toronto Zoo has actively contributed to international conservation efforts and reintroduction programs, including for the Puerto Rican crested toad, and for fish in the African Great Lakes (including the Singidia tilapia or ngege).
*The zoo has bred additional rare Ontario species such as the redside dace and eastern massasauga rattlesnake.
*One zoo staff member has been key in preservation of critically endangered Malagasy freshwater fish species, both at the zoo and in Madagascar.

The Toronto Zoo has been collecting and recycling cell phones since 2006. In 2010, it was awarded the distinction of being the top cell phone recycler out of the Eco-Cell&#x27;s 175 participating wildlife organizations in North America. Other participating wildlife organizations include the San Diego Zoo and the Philadelphia Zoo. Coltan is a mineral ore mined and refined in central Africa for metals used in the electronics industry. This unregulated mining industry has a dramatic impact on the region&#x27;s biodiversity. Recycling cell phones helps to preserve the critical Lowland gorilla rainforest habitat in Africa by decreasing the demand for these minerals. This is of particular interest to the Toronto Zoo as its gorilla habitat has expanded with the addition of a newly born baby gorilla. The Toronto Zoo&#x27;s cell phone recycling program is composed of two parts: Retrocell is the zoo&#x27;s official cell phone refurbisher and the Ontario Electronic Stewardship Program processes the remainder of the phones that are collected by the Toronto Zoo.

In addition, the Toronto Zoo also participates in, and has been a key centre for, the Species Survival Plans (SSP) of dozens of species, maintaining healthy captive populations of animals which may one-day be re-introduced to their former homes. Some notable SSP species the zoo has successfully bred over the years include the western lowland gorilla, Sumatran orangutan, golden lion tamarin, Sumatran tiger, Amur tiger, snow leopard, cheetah, Przewalski&#x27;s horse, Indian rhinoceros, Matschie&#x27;s tree-kangaroo, African penguin, and Komodo dragon. The Toronto Zoo has bred hundreds of species, with many of these breedings being firsts for Canada, North America, and even the world.

===Notable births and hatches===
In 2003, a Komodo dragon was hatched for the first time in Canada.

In 2004, two female West African dwarf crocodiles successfully hatched on October 1, the first hatching of this species in Canada.

Three Sumatran tigers were born at the zoo to parents Brytne and Rengat in 2003, and two more were born in 2006.

In 2006, three orangutans were born and named Jingga, Kembali, and Budi through a TVOKids naming contest.

In 2006, a Matschie&#x27;s tree kangaroo was born, one of three born in North America in 2006. Later named Noru, it was sent to the Lincoln Zoo, and was paired with a mate named Milla who gave birth to twins – a first for this species.

On June 5, 2007, two rare snow leopards were born, the first birth in thirteen years. Another snow leopard was born in 2009, alongside three more in 2017, and two more in 2024.

Two Przewalski&#x27;s horses, one male and one female, were born on June 22, 2007, the first birth in fifteen years. The zoo also successfully bred Przewalski&#x27;s horses in 2008, 2009 and 2020.

The zoo has also been very successful in breeding Bactrian camels, the most recent birth coming in 2023.

In July 2015, two wood bison calves were born as the result of artificial insemination using frozen-thawed sperm that had been collected from a male wood bison in Elk Island, Alberta, in 1980.

Through the weekend of September 26–27, 2015, the zoo&#x27;s white lioness Makali gave birth to four cubs: the first pure-bred white lions born at the Toronto Zoo.

On October 13, 2015, Er Shun, the visiting female giant panda, gave birth to two cubs. This was the first successful reproduction of giant pandas in Canada. A male, later named Jia Panpan, was born at 3:31 AM with a weight , while the other, a female, later named Jia Yueyue, was born at 3:44 AM and weighed 115 g. Their sexes were unknown during the first few months of their lives, being determined in February 2016. The cubs were kept off display until the age of 5 months. In March 2016, the cubs were given the names Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue to signify Canadian hope and Canadian joy, respectively, and revealed to the public before the March Break of that year.

On Remembrance Day (November 11) of 2015, a female polar bear named Juno was born to mother, Aurora. Named for Juno Beach, Juno would be adopted by the Canadian Army and was granted the rank of Honorary Private, and was later promoted to Honorary Corporal on her first birthday and Honorary Master Corporal on her fifth birthday.

On February 17, 2016, 11-year-old Indian rhinoceros Ashakiran, on loan from the Los Angeles Zoo, gave birth to a male named Nandu. With fewer than 3,555 left in the wild, Indian rhinos are classified as a vulnerable species.

In May 2017, the Toronto Zoo had its first births of clouded leopards to mom, Parvati, and dad, Mingma.

On July 17, 2017, a wood bison calf was born at the Toronto Zoo as a result of embryo transfer from a bison at the University of Saskatchewan.

On May 1, 2021, three Amur tiger cubs were born, with one surviving.

On June 13, 2024, two red panda cubs were born.

==Scientific contributions==

The Toronto Zoo has conducted extensive reproduction research on wood bison (&quot;Bison bison athabascae&quot;), in an effort to find means of supporting wild populations in northwestern Canada which may be reproductively compromised due to disease. In July 2015, two wood bison calves were born as the result of artificial insemination using frozen-thawed sperm that had been collected from a male wood bison in Elk Island, Alberta, in 1980. On July 17, 2017, a wood bison calf was born at the Toronto Zoo as a result of embryo transfer from a bison at the University of Saskatchewan.

==Controversies==
On November 30, 2009, Tara, the zoo&#x27;s largest African elephant, died. She was found lying down when staff arrived in the morning and was unable to be raised to her feet. Tara was the third elephant in 14 months to die at the zoo and the fourth in three years.

Elephant deaths preceding Tara&#x27;s:
*June 2009: Tessa was knocked to the ground by another elephant, unable to stand unassisted after being raised to her feet by staff and equipment.
*September 2008: Tequila, cause of death not released.
*July 2006: Patsy was euthanized due to long-term degenerative arthritis

In the days following Tara&#x27;s death, both Zoocheck Canada and U.S.-based In Defence of Animals, as well as game show host Bob Barker of The Price is Right fame, called for the zoo to close the exhibit and send the remaining three elephants to a sanctuary. Toronto City Council endorsed this highly controversial decision. In September 2013, plans were finalized to move Toka, Thika and Iringa to a sanctuary in California in October 2013. The three elephants were transported on land during a 50-hour-long drive with stopovers. Iringa died on July 22, 2015, at the sanctuary in California.

==Media==
*&quot;Zoo Diaries&quot; was a Canadian documentary television series which aired on Life Network. Its focus was on the relationship between the animals and their keepers, allowing viewers to experience what it is like to bond with some of the world&#x27;s most exotic creatures. There have been 74 episodes produced since 2000 by DocuTainment Productions. The first two seasons of the show were also released on DVD/VHS.
*&quot;Undercover Boss Canada&quot; took place in 2011 and was filmed at the Toronto Zoo with the CEO.
*&quot;Rick Mercer Report&quot; featured Canadian comedian Rick Mercer at the Toronto Zoo in 2008 and early 2016 with Mercer visiting the pandas.
*Multiple YouTube videos released by the zoo have gone viral, being shared by news agencies and social media sites to millions of viewers around the world. Notably, videos of visiting giant panda Da Mao have received significant attention.
* The Zoo began releasing the &quot;Wild for Life&quot; podcast in early 2019 sharing interviews with staff on the behind-the-scenes conservation, animal care and research work done by the facility.

<text>Founded in 1875, the Buffalo Zoo, located at 300 Parkside Ave in Buffalo, New York, is the seventh oldest zoo in the United States. Each year, the Buffalo Zoo welcomes approximately 400,000 visitors and is the second largest tourist attraction in Western New York; second only to Niagara Falls. Located on of Buffalo&#x27;s Delaware Park, the zoo exhibits a diverse collection of wild and exotic animals, and more than 320 different species of plants. The zoo is open year-round.

==History==

The zoo traces its history to the mid-19th century when Jacob E. Bergtold, a Buffalo furrier, presented a pair of deer to the city of Buffalo. To provide the deer with room to graze, Elam R. Jewett, the publisher of the Buffalo Daily Journal, offered to house the deer on his estate. Simultaneously, plans were being made for the municipal North Park (today&#x27;s Delaware Park), and Mayor William F. Rogers hired landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted, to include a zoo as part of the park&#x27;s design. Five years after, the deer were donated, more animals were added to the collection, and the first permanent building was erected in 1875, officially establishing the Buffalo Zoological Gardens.

The zoo underwent a large expansion during the Great Depression and became a major work site for the Works Progress Administration. Among the new structures was the Buffalo Zoo Entrance Court at Parkside Avenue and Amherst Street. It was designed by African-American architect John Edmonston Brent (son of architect Calvin Brent) and built 1935–1938. The Buffalo Zoo Entrance Court was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.

Throughout the next several decades, more exhibits and facilities were added, including the Reptile House (1942), Children&#x27;s Zoo (1965), Giraffe House and Veterinary Hospital (1967), and The Gorilla Habitat Building (1981). The zoo&#x27;s mission also began to change during the 1980s and 1990s under the direction of Minot Ortolani, as it began reducing the numbers of animals in its collection to focus on the breeding of endangered species that might not otherwise have a chance at survival. In addition to its conservation efforts, the zoo also placed more of an emphasis on education to teach visitors about the animals and their natural habitats. From 2000 - 2017 the President/CEO of the zoo was Dr Donna M. Fernandes, with Norah B. Fletchall succeeding her in 2017.

In 2002, a 15-year master plan was unveiled to transform the zoo. New visitor amenities and naturalistic habitats were planned, including the Asian River and Highlands Zone, African Watering Hole, Arctic Edge, and the Wonders of Water Children&#x27;s Zoo. Phase One of the Master Plan has resulted in the opening of the Vanishing Animals exhibit, EcoStation, Otter Creek, and Sea Lion Cove. The completion of Phase One was marked by the September 10, 2008, opening of the South American Rainforest, a four-season attraction that features a two-story waterfall, dozens of colorful birds, and a variety of other rainforest species. In the fall of 2015 the $14 million Arctic Edge opened to the public featuring Arctic wolves, lynxes and polar bears. In 2016 the Arctic wolves were replaced by Arctic foxes which fit the size of the exhibit better than the wolves. Arctic Edge is currently home to two polar bears Anana and Luna. Luna is the offspring of Anana and Nanuq, who now resides at the Columbus Zoo.

In March 2018, the zoo&#x27;s Reptile House was closed for 14 months to undergo a $3.7 million remodel. It reopened on May 24, 2019, as the Donna M. Fernandes Amphibian and Reptile Center with a new roof, refreshed exhibits, interactive graphics and a conservation room.

In August 2018, the zoo announced it would be sending its two Asian elephants, Jothi and Surapa to the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans due to being unable to care for them anymore. They arrived at the Audubon Zoo later that year. As of 2022, the former elephant habitat is currently occupied by black rhinos.

In early June 2020, a red-footed tortoise was reportedly stolen from the zoo. There was an ongoing police search, but the tortoise, &#x27;Red&#x27;, was never found.

<doc id="506408" wikidata="Q574321" url="?curid=506408" title="1921 Upper Silesia plebiscite">
<text>The Upper Silesia plebiscite was a plebiscite mandated by the Versailles Treaty and carried out on 20 March 1921 to determine ownership of the province of Upper Silesia between Weimar Germany and the Second Polish Republic. The region was ethnically mixed with both Germans and Poles. According to prewar statistics, ethnic Poles formed 60 percent of the population.

Under the previous rule by the German Empire, Poles claimed they had faced discrimination and had been effectively second-class citizens. The period of the plebiscite campaign and the Allied occupation was marked by violence. Three Polish uprisings occurred, and German volunteer paramilitary units came to the region.

The area was policed by French, British and Italian troops and overseen by an Interallied Commission. The Allies planned a partition of the region, but a Polish insurgency took control of over half the area. The Germans responded with the Freikorps, volunteer paramilitary units from all over Germany that fought the Polish units. In the end, after renewed Allied military intervention, the final position of the opposing forces became, roughly, the new border. The decision was handed over to the League of Nations, which confirmed the border, and Poland received roughly one third of the plebiscite zone by area, including the greater part of the industrial region.

After the referendum, a conference of ambassadors in Paris on 20 October 1921 decided to divide the region. Consequently, the German-Polish Accord on East Silesia (Geneva Convention), a minority treaty, was concluded on 15 May 1922 and dealt with the constitutional and legal future of Upper Silesia, which had partly become Polish territory.

== Ethnolinguistic structure before the plebiscite ==

The earliest exact census figures on ethnolinguistic or national structure (Nationalverschiedenheit) of the Prussian part of Upper Silesia, come from 1819. Polish immigration from Galicia, Congress Poland and Prussian provinces into Upper Silesia during the 19th century was a major factor in their increasing numbers. The last Prussian general census figures available are from 1910 (if not including the 1911 census of school children – Sprachzählung unter den Schulkindern – which revealed a higher percent of Polish-speakers among school children than the 1910 census among the general populace). Figures (Table 1.) show that large demographic changes took place between 1819 and 1910, with the region&#x27;s total population quadrupling, the percent of Germans increasing significantly, while Polish-speakers maintained their steady increasing numbers. Also the total land area in which Polish was spoken, as well as the land area in which it was spoken, declined between 1790 and 1890. Polish authors before 1918 estimated the number of Poles in Prussian Upper Silesia as slightly higher than according to official German censuses.
The three western districts of Falkenberg (Niemodlin), Grottkau (Grodków) and Neisse (Nysa), though part of Regierungsbezirk Oppeln, were not included in the plebiscite area, as they were almost entirely populated by Germans.
== The plebiscite ==

The Paris Peace Conference at the end of the First World War placed some formerly German territory in neighbouring countries, some of which had not existed before the war. In the case of the new Second Polish Republic, the Treaty of Versailles established some 54,000 square kilometrs of formerly-German territory as part of the newly-independent Poland. Many of these areas were ethnically mixed. In three of the ethnically-mixed areas on the new German-Polish border, however, the Allied leaders provided for border plebiscites or referendums. The areas would be occupied by Allied forces and governed to some degree by Allied commissions.

The most significant of those plebiscites was the one in Upper Silesia since the region was a principal industrial centre. The most important economic asset was the enormous coal-mining industry and its ancillary businesses, but the area yielded iron, zinc, and lead. The &quot;Industrial Triangle&quot;, on the eastern side of the plebiscite zone, }between the cities of Beuthen (Bytom), Kattowitz (Katowice), and Gleiwitz (Gliwice) was the heart of this large industrial complex. The Upper Silesia plebiscite was therefore a plebiscite for self-determination of Upper Silesia required by the Treaty of Versailles. Both Germany and Poland valued the region not only for reasons of national feeling but also for its economic importance.

The area was occupied by British, French, and Italian forces, and an Interallied Committee headed by a French general, Henri Le Rond. The plebiscite was set for 20 March 1921. Both Poles and Germans were allowed to organize campaigns. Each side developed secret paramilitary forces, which were financed from the opposing capitals: Warsaw and Berlin. The major figure of the campaign was Wojciech Korfanty, a pro-Polish politician.

The Poles carried out uprisings during the campaign in August 1919 and August 1920. The Allies restored order in each case, but the Polish insurrectionists clashed with German &quot;volunteers&quot;, the Freikorps.

A feature of the plebiscite campaign was the growing prominence of a strong autonomist movement, the most visible branch of which was the Bund der Oberschlesier/Związek Górnoślązaków, an organisation attempted to gain promises of autonomy from both states and possible future independence for Upper Silesia.

There were 1,186,758 votes cast in an area inhabited by 2,073,663 people. They resulted in 717,122 votes being cast for Germany and 483,514 for Poland.

The towns and most of the villages in the plebiscite territory had German majorities. However, the districts of Pless (Pszczyna) and Rybnik in the southeast, as well as Tarnowitz (Tarnowskie Góry) in the east and Tost-Gleiwitz (Gliwice) in the interior showed considerable Polish majorities, while in Lublinitz (Lubliniec) and Groß Strehlitz (Strzelce Opolskie) the votes cast on either side were practically equal. All districts of the industrial zone in a narrower sense – Beuthen (Bytom), Hindenburg (Zabrze), Kattowitz (Katowice), and Königshütte (Chorzów) – had slight German majorities, but in Beuthen and Kattowitz, that was entirely because of the town vote (four fifths in Kattowitz. compared to an overall 60%). Many country communes of Upper Silesia had Polish majorities. Overall, however, the Germans won the vote by a measure of 59.4% to 40.6%. The Interallied Commission deliberated, but the British proposed a more easterly border than the French, which would have given much less of the Industrial Triangle to Poland. 

In late April 1921, when pro-Polish forces began to fear that the region would be partitioned according to the British plan, elements on the Polish side announced a popular uprising. Korfanty was the leading figure of the uprising, but he had much support in Upper Silesia and from the Polish government, in Warsaw. Korfanty called for a popular armed uprising, whose aim was to maximize the territory yhat Poland would receive in the partition. German volunteers rushed to meet this uprising, and large-scale fighting took place in the late spring and early summer of 1921. German-speaking spokesmen and German officials complained that the French units of the Upper Silesian army of occupation supported the insurrection by refusing to put down violent activities or to restore order.

Twelve days after the start of the uprising, Korfanty offered to take his Upper Silesian forces behind a line of demarcation if the released territory was occupied not by German forces but by Allied troops. On 1 July, British troops returned to Upper Silesia to help French forces occupy this area. Simultaneously with those events, the Interallied Commission pronounced a general amnesty for the illegal actions committed during the recent violence except for acts of revenge and cruelty. The German defence force was finally withdrawn.

Because the Allied Supreme Council was unable to come to an agreement on the partition of the Upper Silesian territory on the basis of the confusing plebiscite results, a solution was found by turning the question over to the Council of the League of Nations. Agreements between the Germans and Poles in Upper Silesia and appeals issued by both sides, as well as the dispatch of six battalions of Allied troops and the disbandment of the local guards, contributed markedly to the pacification of the district. On the basis of the reports of a League commission and those of its experts, the Council awarded the greater part of the Upper Silesian industrial district to Poland, which obtained almost exactly half of the 1,950,000 inhabitants (965,000) but not quite a third of the territory (only 3,214.26 km2 (1,255 mi2) out of 10,950.89 km2 (4,265 mi2)) but more than 80% of the heavy industry of the region.

The German and Polish governments, under a League of Nations recommendation, agreed to enforce protections of minority interests that would last for 15 years. Special measures were threatened in case either state refused to participate in the drawing up of such regulations or to accept them subsequently. In the event, the German minority remaining on the Polish side of the border suffered considerable discrimination in the subsequent decades.

The Polish government, convinced by the economic and political power of the region and by the autonomist movement of the plebiscite campaign, decided to give Upper Silesia considerable autonomy, with a Silesian Parliament as a legislature and the Silesian Voivodship Council as the executive body. On the German side the new Prussian province of Upper Silesia (&quot;Oberschlesien&quot;) with regional government in Oppeln was formed, likewise with special autonomy.

=== Results ===


According to Article 88 of the Treaty of Versailles all inhabitants of the plebiscite district older than 20 years of age and those who had &quot;been expelled by the German authorities and have not retained their domicile there&quot; were entitled to return to vote.

That stipulation of the Treaty of Versailles allowed the participation of thousands of Upper Silesian migrant workers from western Germany (Ruhrpolen). Hugo Service regards the transport of theoe eligible voters to Silesia, organized by German authorities, &quot;a cynical act aimed at boosting the German vote&quot; and as one of the reasons for the overall result. As Service writes, although almost 60% of Upper Silesians voted for their region to remain part of Germany, it would be dubious to claim that most of them were ethnically German or regarded themselves as Germans. Voting for Germany in the 1921 vote and regarding oneself as German were two different things. People had diverse, often very pragmatic reasons for voting for Germany, which usually had little to do with regarding themselves as having a German ethnonational identity.

According to Robert Machray, 192,408 of all plebiscite voters were migrants and made up 16% of the total electorate. Among them, 94.7% voted for Germany. There were cases of votes being cast in the name of already deceased persons who died outside of Upper Silesia, and since their deaths were registered&quot; in comparatively inaccessible German registration departments in Central Germany&quot;, it was often difficult to detect voter fraud. Additionally, &quot;the general conditions in which the plebiscite was held by no means created an atmosphere for a free and independent vote&quot; since the administration was staffed only by ethnic Germans, and no Polish schools were allowed, which limited Polish cultural life to churches and private organisations. The Polish population of Silesia overwhelmingly consisted of poor workers and small farmers, who owned no real property and were highly dependent on the German authorities to provide appropriate instrastructure. All offices and industries were controlled by the German population, who exerted an overwhelming pressure on Poles to vote for Germany, and they &quot;frequently exceeded their lawful powers and supported many forms of anti-Polish activities&quot;.

Demobilised German officers joined the Freikorps and terrorised the Polish population. Machray states, &quot;Upper Silesia was the scene of incessant confusion, sanguinary struggles with armed German attacks on Polish meetings and on the terrorized and defenceless Polish population, especially in the rural areas&quot;. Emil Julius Gumbel investigated and condemned the cases of widespread intimidation and murders by Freikorps and Selbstschutz divisions and remarked that “a denunciation, a suspicion without foundation under the given circumstances, was sufficient. The man concerned is fetched from his lodgings and instantly shot... all this only because the man was a Pole or was considered a Pole and worked for union with Poland”. Machray establishes that many Poles were either prevented from voting or intimidated into voting for Germany and notes that in provinces such as Kozle and Olesno, a minority of voters voted for Poland although the areas were overwhelmingly Polish according to the 1910 census, with 75% in Kozle and 81% in Olesno Provinces. Machray concludes that given the aggressive anti-Polish campaign conducted by local authorities and German volunteers, &quot;the results were far from being an objective reflection of the true desires of the oppressed people&quot;. The constant ethnic tensions and attacks on Polish voters resulted in the Silesian Uprisings.

=== Comparison of district demographics with voting behaviour ===
The following table compares the percentage of German-speakers (excluding bilinguals) as reported in the 1910 census in each district, with the pro-German vote share registered in the respective district. In almost all districts, the percentage of pro-German votes exceeded the percentage of those who identified as German by almost 25% on average, which suggests that many non-Germans voted in favour of Germany.

The above population percentages refer to the entire area of the respective districts, but in a few cases, only parts of a district were included in the plebiscite a:

1 Only a small part of the Namslau district was part of the plebiscite area; 1905 census data was used for the district

2 The predominantly German south-western part of the Neustadt district (including the town of Neustadt) was not part of the plebiscite area

3 The southern part of the Ratibor district (Hlučín Region) was ceded to Czechoslovakia in 1919 and so was not included in the plebiscite area

==Settlements that voted to secede for Poland==
In the 1921 plebiscite, 40.6% of eligible voters decided to secede from Germany and become Polish citizens. In total, over 700 towns and villages voted to secede from Germany and become part of Poland, especially in the rural districts of Pszczyna, Rybnik, Tarnowskie Góry, Toszek-Gliwice, Strzelce Opolskie, Bytom, Katowice, Lubliniec, Zabrze, Racibórz, Olesno, Koźle and Opole.

<text>A singing school is a school in which students are taught to sightread vocal music. Singing schools are a long-standing cultural institution in the Southern United States. While some singing schools are offered for credit, most are informal programs.

Historically, singing schools have been strongly affiliated with Protestant Christianity. Some are held under the auspices of particular Protestant denominations that maintain a tradition of a cappella singing, such as the Church of Christ and the Primitive Baptists. Others are associated with Sacred Harp, Southern Gospel, and similar singing traditions, whose music is religious in character but sung outside the context of church services.

Often the music taught in singing schools uses shape note or &quot;buckwheat&quot; notation, in which the notes are assigned particular shapes to indicate their pitch. There are two main varieties: the four-note, or &quot;fasola&quot;, system used in Sacred Harp music, and the seven-note system developed by Jesse B. Aikin used in southern gospel music. Some churches, including some Baptist churches (though fewer and fewer), use hymnals printed in shape notes.

==History==
===Origins===

The first American singing schools began in New England in the early 1700s as an effort to spread the use of written music in congregational singing. In some denominations, controversies existed on whether congregations should sing audibly, and whether singing should be limited to the Psalms of David. This New England controversy centered around &quot;regular singing&quot; versus the &quot;usual way&quot;. The &quot;usual way&quot; consisted of the entire congregation singing in unison tunes passed on by oral tradition, often by lining out. &quot;Regular singing&quot; consisted of &quot;singing by note&quot; or &quot;rule&quot;. Though intended for the entire congregation, &quot;regular singing&quot; sometimes divided the congregation into singers and &quot;non-singers&quot;. Massachusetts ministers John Tufts and Thomas Walter were among the leaders in this &quot;reform movement&quot;. Tufts&#x27; &quot;An Introduction to the Singing of Psalm Tunes&quot; is generally considered the first singing school manual. By the middle of the 18th century, the arguments for &quot;regular singing&quot; had generally won the day.

By the end of the 18th century, the singing school manuals had become standardized in an oblong-shaped &quot;tunebook&quot;, usually containing tunes with only one stanza of text. William Billings was one of the most important of the New England singing school teachers of this period. One of his singing schools was held in 1774 in Stoughton, Massachusetts. According to Hall, &quot;The school taught by William Billings is the first and only one with all the pupils given.&quot; A few members of this singing school later helped organize the Stoughton Musical Society in 1786, now the oldest surviving choral society in the United States.

New systems of music notation, including shape notes, were developed by singing school teachers as an aid in learning to sing by sight. Early shape note systems were an extension of &quot;Old English&quot; or &quot;Lancashire&quot; sol-fa, developed in Britain in the 17th century, with the intention of teaching school children to sing, and remained in use there until the 20th. This system was used in America from the late 17th century. The use of &quot;shape-notes&quot; themselves was an American innovation, first put into use in 1798 in Philadelphia and soon popular in the many hymn collections published in the early 19th century. The four-shape &quot;fasola&quot; system was prominent before the Civil War and survives largely in the Sacred Harp tradition, while various seven-shape systems gained popularity beginning in the 1860s and are still seen in some denominational hymnals and in Southern Gospel music.

By the 1820s, the &quot;Yankee singing school&quot; had become a nationwide phenomenon. However, advocates of European classical music like Lowell Mason sought to suppress the tradition in favor of a more cosmopolitan idiom, which came to be taught at public schools. Eventually, singing schools in the north faded to obscurity, while in the south and west they became a prominent social event for small-town Americans looking for something to do.

===Continued use in the South===
Singing schools were often taught by traveling singing masters who would stay in a location for a few weeks and teach a singing school. A singing school would be a large social event for a town; sometimes nearly everyone in the town would attend and people would come from many miles away. Many young men and women saw singing schools as important to their courtship traditions. Sometimes the entire life of a town would be put on hold as everyone came out to singing school. In this way, singing schools resembled tent revivals.

Laura Ingalls Wilder related attending a singing school as a young lady in &quot;These Happy Golden Years&quot;, one of the &quot;Little House&quot; books. Her husband, Almanzo Wilder, courted her there.

One common tradition was the &quot;singing school picture&quot; taken of the teacher and students on the last day of school. Many old black and white photographs exist as records of these events from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; genealogical researchers often find these records useful. The pictures were often taken in front of a blackboard with the name of the teacher and date of the school. Some of these pictures show small classes, while others record very large schools.

Singing schools underwent many changes as cities grew and the population moved away from an agrarian lifestyle. One of the most notable changes was the length of schools; at one time it was common for schools to last four weeks. This was shortened over time, and today most of the larger singing schools last for two weeks, though the Gospel Singers of America School of Gospel Music still lasts for three weeks.

Singing schools began to hold less interest for the general public as time went on and could rarely get attendance from an entire town. Instead, schools were attended by interested students from a much larger region. In the case of Sacred Harp singing schools, students usually attended because of their interest in the Sacred Harp singing tradition; in other schools, students attended because of an interest in vocal church music, especially for those churches that maintain an all-&quot;a capella&quot; music tradition.

The tradition of having singing school masters who traveled between various towns where they held singing schools faded away in favor of holding annual schools in the same location. Primitive Baptists have established three permanently located singing schools in the state of Texas (Harmony Hill at Azle, Harmony Plains at Cone, and Melody Grove at Warren). There are several non-denominational seven-shape singing schools throughout the southern United States, including the North Georgia School of Gospel Music in Georgia, Ben Speer&#x27;s Stamps-Baxter School of Music in Tennessee, Cumberland Valley School of Gospel Music in Tennessee and the Alabama School of Gospel Music in Alabama. Camp Fasola, which was founded in 2003, is an attempt by Sacred Harp enthusiasts to establish a permanent annual singing school.

Singing schools are also common in Missionary Baptist churches, as well as rural churches across the South, including Methodist, Church of God, Southern Baptist, and other denominations. Many of these churches still prefer to use shape note hymnals, as opposed to round note versions that many denominational publishing houses provide. In southern gospel singing schools, convention songbooks are used to teach sight-singing, music theory, and conducting. Some music publishing companies have also published music theory books for use in the schools.

==Curriculum==

The basic subjects taught at singing schools are music theory and sight reading (the ability to sing a piece of music on first reading). Most southern gospel schools also focus extensively on song leading, the ability to direct a group in vocal music. Song leading requires both music theory skills and public speaking skills. In addition, many schools teach composition and ear training. Most song leading classes are open to both genders, but some schools are associated with Christian religious traditions that allow only male leadership and therefore only offer such classes to males.
Sacred Harp singing schools use one or more of the 20th century editions of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; as curriculum. Some of these schools are one-day workshops held in conjunction with a singing convention. The emphasis is on teaching newcomers and advanced musicians the note system and traditions of Sacred Harp.

Many singing schools have published their own small textbooks on music theory, harmony, and song and lyric composition. These are often offered to students as part of the tuition charge of the school.Some schools, such as Cumberland Valley School of Gospel Music, include in the tuition charge a convention songbook rather than a textbook. At some schools students purchase a pitch pipe or tuning fork. Primitive Baptists commonly practice pitching by ear rather than with a pitch pipe. Southern gospel schools primarily use the piano as accompaniment. Pitch pipes are sometimes used in individual classes for brief practice.

It is common for students to continue to return to their singing school year after year, even after completing the entire curriculum the school offers, for additional practice as well as for the social opportunity the school represents. Many singing school students eventually become teachers. Though singing schools are not as prominent today as they were, for many people they are still an important yearly event.

<text>Solomon Kullback (April 3, 1907August 5, 1994) was an American cryptanalyst and mathematician, who was one of the first three employees hired by William F. Friedman at the US Army&#x27;s Signal Intelligence Service (SIS) in the 1930s, along with Frank Rowlett and Abraham Sinkov. He went on to a long and distinguished career at SIS and its eventual successor, the National Security Agency (NSA). Kullback was the Chief Scientist at the NSA until his retirement in 1962, whereupon he took a position at the George Washington University.

The Kullback–Leibler divergence is named after Kullback and Richard Leibler.

==Life and career==
Kullback was born to Jewish parents in Brooklyn, New York. His father Nathan had been born in Vilna, Russian Empire, (now Vilnius, Lithuania) and had immigrated to the US as a young man circa 1905, and became a naturalized American in 1911. Kullback attended Boys High School in Brooklyn. He then went to City College of New York, graduating with a BA in 1927 and an MA in math in 1929. He completed a doctorate in math from George Washington University in 1934. His intention had been to teach, and he returned to Boy&#x27;s High School to do so, but found it not to his taste; he discovered his real interest was using mathematics, not teaching it.

At the suggestion of Abraham Sinkov, who showed him a Civil Service flyer for &quot;junior mathematicians&quot; at US$2,000 per year, he took the examination. Both passed, and were assigned to Washington, D.C. as junior cryptanalysts.

Upon arrival in Washington, Kullback was assigned to William F. Friedman. Friedman had begun an intensive program of training in cryptology for his new civilian employees. For several summers running, the SIS cryptanalysts attended training camps at Fort Meade until they received commissions as reserve officers in the Army. Kullback and Sinkov took Friedman&#x27;s admonitions on education seriously and spent the next several years attending night classes; both received their doctorates in mathematics. Afterward, Kullback rediscovered a love of teaching; he began offering evening classes in mathematics at George Washington University from 1939.

Once they had completed the training, the three were put to the work for which they had actually been hired, compilations of cipher or code material for the U.S. Army. Another task was to test commercial cipher devices which vendors wished to sell to the U.S. government.

Kullback worked in partnership with Frank Rowlett against RED cipher machine messages. Almost overnight, they unravelled the keying system and then the machine pattern – with nothing but the intercepted messages in hand. Using the talents of linguist John Hurt to translate text, SIS started issuing current intelligence to military decision-makers.

In May 1942, five months after attack on Pearl Harbor, Kullback, by then a Major, was sent to Britain. He learned at Bletchley Park that the British were producing intelligence of high quality by exploiting the Enigma machine. He also cooperated with the British in the solution of more conventional German codebook-based systems. Shortly after his return to the States, Kullback moved into the Japanese section as its chief.

When the National Security Agency (NSA) was formed in 1952, Rowlett became chief of cryptanalysis. The primary problem facing research and development in the post-war period was development of high-speed processing equipment. Kullback supervised a team of about 60 people, including such innovative thinkers in automated data processing development as Leo Rosen and Sam Snyder. His staff pioneered new forms of input and memory, such as magnetic tape and drum memory, and compilers to make machines truly &quot;multi-purpose&quot;. Kullback gave priority to using computers to generate communications security (COMSEC) materials.

Kullback&#x27;s book &quot;Information Theory and Statistics&quot; was published by John Wiley &amp; Sons in 1959. The book was republished, with additions and corrections, by Dover Publications in 1968.

==Retirement==
Solomon Kullback retired from NSA in 1962, and focused on his teaching at George Washington University and publishing new papers. In 1963 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. He reached the rank of colonel, and was inducted into the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame.

Kullback is remembered by his colleagues at NSA as straightforward; one described him as &quot;totally guileless, you always knew where you stood with him.&quot; One former NSA senior recalled him as a man of unlimited energy and enthusiasm and a man whose judgment was usually &quot;sound and right.&quot;

<text>Infectious Grooves is an American funk metal supergroup led by vocalist Mike Muir and initially a side project from his group Suicidal Tendencies. The current lineup also includes guitarists Dean Pleasants and Dave Kushner, bassist Robert Trujillo, and drummer Jay Weinberg. To date, the project released four albums between 1991 and 2000.

Muir and the band appear in the 1992 film &quot;Encino Man&quot;, playing the song &quot;Feed The Monkey&quot; during the film&#x27;s prom scene finale.

Though Muir&#x27;s sense of humor was often obvious with Suicidal Tendencies, Infectious Grooves often brought out a goofier type of humor, incorporating comedy skits involving an anthropomorphic reptile named Sarsippius. A mascot costume of Sarsippius was later created and often appeared during the band&#x27;s live performances.

The Infectious Grooves were on hiatus between the release of their fourth album, 2000&#x27;s &quot;Mas Borracho,&quot; and 2007, while the band&#x27;s personnel were busy with other projects. According to Muir, Infectious Grooves had been working on new material. In April 2008 the band began a one-month tour across Europe, featuring Stephen Bruner on bass, Eric Moore on drums, Dean Pleasants, and Tim Stewart on guitars.

Most of the band&#x27;s original lineup reunited for the Orion Music + More festival in June 2013, with ex-Faith No More guitarist Jim Martin filling in for Adam Siegel.

The band is touring in 2024 with Dave Kushner on guitar and Jay Weinberg on drums.

<text>Environmental sociology is the study of interactions between societies and their natural environment. The field emphasizes the social factors that influence environmental resource management and cause environmental issues, the processes by which these environmental problems are socially constructed and define as social issues, and societal responses to these problems.

Environmental sociology emerged as a subfield of sociology in the late 1970s in response to the emergence of the environmental movement in the 1960s. It represents a relatively new area of inquiry focusing on an extension of earlier sociology through inclusion of physical context as related to social factors.

== Definition ==
Environmental sociology is typically defined as the sociological study of socio-environmental interactions, although this definition immediately presents the problem of integrating human cultures with the rest of the environment. Different aspects of human interaction with the natural environment are studied by environmental sociologists including population and demography, organizations and institutions, science and technology, health and illness, consumption and sustainability practices, culture and identity, and social inequality and environmental justice. Although the focus of the field is the relationship between society and environment in general, environmental sociologists typically place special emphasis on studying the social factors that cause environmental problems, the societal impacts of those problems, and efforts to solve the problems. In addition, considerable attention is paid to the social processes by which certain environmental conditions become socially defined as problems. Most research in environmental sociology examines contemporary societies.

==History==
Environmental sociology emerged as a coherent subfield of inquiry after the environmental movement of the 1960s and early 1970s. The works of William R. Catton, Jr. and Riley Dunlap, among others, challenged the constricted anthropocentrism of classical sociology. In the late 1970s, they called for a new holistic, or systems perspective, which lead to a marked shift in the field’s focus. Since the 1970s, general sociology has noticeably transformed to include environmental forces in social explanations. Environmental sociology has now solidified as a respected, interdisciplinary field of study in academia.

==Concepts==
===Existential dualism===
The duality of the human condition rests with cultural uniqueness and evolutionary traits. From one perspective, humans are embedded in the ecosphere and co-evolved alongside other species. Humans share the same basic ecological dependencies as other inhabitants of nature. From the other perspectives, humans are distinguished from other species because of their innovative capacities, distinct cultures and varied institutions. Human creations have the power to independently manipulate, destroy, and transcend the limits of the natural environment.

According to Buttel (2004), there are five major traditions in environmental sociology today: the treadmill of production and other eco-Marxisms, ecological modernization and other sociologies of environmental reform, cultural-environmental sociologies, neo-Malthusianisms, and the new ecological paradigm. In practice, this means five different theories of what to blame for environmental degradation, i.e., what to research or consider as important. These ideas are listed below in the order in which they were invented. Ideas that emerged later built on earlier ideas, and contradicted them.

===Neo-Malthusianism===

Works such as Hardin&#x27;s &quot;Tragedy of the Commons&quot; (1969) reformulated Malthusian thought about abstract population increases causing famines into a model of individual selfishness at larger scales causing degradation of common pool resources such as the air, water, the oceans, or general environmental conditions. Hardin offered privatization of resources or government regulation as solutions to environmental degradation caused by tragedy of the commons conditions. Many other sociologists shared this view of solutions well into the 1970s (see Ophuls). There have been many critiques of this view particularly political scientist Elinor Ostrom, or economists Amartya Sen and Ester Boserup. Sociologists have developed a critical counter to Hardin&#x27;s thesis called The Tragedy of the Commodity.

Even though much of mainstream journalism considers Malthusianism the only view of environmentalism, most sociologists would disagree with Malthusianism since social organizational issues of environmental degradation are more demonstrated to cause environmental problems than abstract population or selfishness per se. For examples of this critique, Ostrom in her book &quot;Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action&quot; (1990) argues that instead of self-interest always causing degradation, it can sometimes motivate people to take care of their common property resources. To do this they must change the basic organizational rules of resource use. Her research provides evidence for sustainable resource management systems, around common pool resources that have lasted for centuries in some areas of the world.

Amartya Sen argues in his book &quot;Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation&quot; (1980) that population expansion fails to cause famines or degradation as Malthusians or Neo-Malthusians argue. Instead, in documented cases a lack of political entitlement to resources that exist in abundance, causes famines in some populations. He documents how famines can occur even in the midst of plenty or in the context of low populations. He argues that famines (and environmental degradation) would only occur in non-functioning democracies or unrepresentative states.

Ester Boserup argues in her book &quot;The Conditions of Agricultural Growth: The Economics of Agrarian Change under Population Pressure&quot; (1965) from inductive, empirical case analysis that Malthus&#x27;s more deductive conception of a presumed one-to-one relationship with agricultural scale and population is actually reversed. Instead of agricultural technology and scale determining and limiting population as Malthus attempted to argue, Boserup argued the world is full of cases of the direct opposite: that population changes and expands agricultural methods.

Eco-Marxist scholar Allan Schnaiberg (below) argues against Malthusianism with the rationale that under larger capitalist economies, human degradation moved from localized, population-based degradation to organizationally caused degradation of capitalist political economies to blame. He gives the example of the organized degradation of rainforest areas which states and capitalists push people off the land before it is degraded by organizational means. Thus, many authors are critical of Malthusianism, from sociologists (Schnaiberg) to economists (Sen and Boserup), to political scientists (Ostrom), and all focus on how a country&#x27;s social organization of its extraction can degrade the environment independent of abstract population.

===New Ecological Paradigm===

In the 1970s, the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) conception critiqued the claimed lack of human-environmental focus in the classical sociologists and the sociological priorities their followers created. This was critiqued as the Human Exemptionalism Paradigm (HEP). The HEP viewpoint claims that human-environmental relationships were unimportant sociologically because humans are &#x27;exempt&#x27; from environmental forces via cultural change. This view was shaped by the leading Western worldview of the time and the desire for sociology to establish itself as an independent discipline against the then popular racist-biological environmental determinism where environment was all. In this HEP view, human dominance was felt to be justified by the uniqueness of culture, argued to be more adaptable than biological traits. Furthermore, culture also has the capacity to accumulate and innovate, making it capable of solving all natural problems. Therefore, as humans were not conceived of as governed by natural conditions, they were felt to have complete control of their own destiny. Any potential limitation posed by the natural world was felt to be surpassed using human ingenuity. Research proceeded accordingly without environmental analysis.

In the 1970s, sociological scholars Riley Dunlap and William R. Catton, Jr. began recognizing the limits of what would be termed the Human Excemptionalism Paradigm. Catton and Dunlap (1978) suggested a new perspective that took environmental variables into full account. They coined a new theoretical outlook for sociology, the New Ecological Paradigm, with assumptions contrary to HEP.

The NEP recognizes the innovative capacity of humans, but says that humans are still ecologically interdependent as with other species. The NEP notes the power of social and cultural forces but does not profess social determinism. Instead, humans are impacted by the cause, effect, and feedback loops of ecosystems. The Earth has a finite level of natural resources and waste repositories. Thus, the biophysical environment can impose constraints on human activity. They discussed a few harbingers of this NEP in &#x27;hybridized&#x27; theorizing about topics that were neither exclusively social nor environmental explanations of environmental conditions. It was additionally a critique of Malthusian views of the 1960s and 1970s.

Dunlap and Catton&#x27;s work immediately received a critique from Buttel who argued to the contrary that classical sociological foundations could be found for environmental sociology, particularly in Weber&#x27;s work on ancient &quot;agrarian civilizations&quot; and Durkheim&#x27;s view of the division of labor as built on a material premise of specialization/specialization in response to material scarcity. This environmental aspect of Durkheim has been discussed by Schnaiberg (1971) as well.

=== Treadmill of Production Theory ===
The Treadmill of Production is a theory coined and popularized by Schnaiberg as a way to answer for the increase in U.S. environmental degradation post World War II. At its simplest, this theory states that the more product or commodities are created, the more resources will be used, and the higher the impact will be. The treadmill is a metaphor of being caught in the cycle of continuous growth which never stops, demanding more resources and as a result causing more environmental damage.

===Eco-Marxism===

In the middle of the HEP/NEP debate Neo-Marxist ideas of conflict sociology were applied to environmental conflicts. Therefore, some sociologists wanted to stretch Marxist ideas of social conflict to analyze environmental social movements from the Marxist materialist framework instead of interpreting them as a cultural &quot;New Social Movement&quot;, separate from material concerns. So &quot;Eco-Marxism&quot; was developed based on using Neo-Marxist Conflict theories concepts of the relative autonomy of the state and applying them to environmental conflict.

Two people following this school were James O&#x27;Connor (&quot;The Fiscal Crisis of the State&quot;, 1971) and later Allan Schnaiberg.

Later, a different trend developed in eco-Marxism via the attention brought to the importance of metabolic analysis in Marx&#x27;s thought by John Bellamy Foster. Contrary to previous assumptions that classical theorists in sociology all had fallen within a Human Exemptionalist Paradigm, Foster argued that Marx&#x27;s materialism lead him to theorize labor as the metabolic process between humanity and the rest of nature. In Promethean interpretations of Marx that Foster critiques, there was an assumption his analysis was very similar to the anthropocentric views critiqued by early environmental sociologists. Instead, Foster argued Marx himself was concerned about the Metabolic rift generated by capitalist society&#x27;s social metabolism, particularly in industrial agriculture—Marx had identified an &quot;irreparable rift in the interdependent process of social metabolism,&quot; created by capitalist agriculture that was destroying the productivity of the land and creating wastes in urban sites that failed to be reintegrated into the land and thus lead toward destruction of urban workers health simultaneously. Reviewing the contribution of this thread of eco-marxism to current environmental sociology, Pellow and Brehm conclude, &quot;The metabolic rift is a productive development in the field because it connects current research to classical theory and links sociology with an interdisciplinary array of scientific literatures focused on ecosystem dynamics.&quot;

Foster emphasized that his argument presupposed the &quot;magisterial work&quot; of Paul Burkett, who had developed a closely related &quot;red-green&quot; perspective rooted in a direct examination of Marx&#x27;s value theory. Burkett and Foster proceeded to write a number of articles together on Marx&#x27;s ecological conceptions, reflecting their shared perspective

More recently, Jason W. Moore, inspired by Burkett&#x27;s value-analytical approach to Marx&#x27;s ecology and arguing that Foster&#x27;s work did not in itself go far enough, has sought to integrate the notion of metabolic rift with world systems theory, incorporating Marxian value-related conceptions. For Moore, the modern world-system is a capitalist world-ecology, joining the accumulation of capital, the pursuit of power, and the production of nature in dialectical unity. Central to Moore&#x27;s perspective is a philosophical re-reading of Marx&#x27;s value theory, through which abstract social labor and abstract social nature are dialectically bound. Moore argues that the emergent law of value, from the sixteenth century, was evident in the extraordinary shift in the scale, scope, and speed of environmental change. What took premodern civilizations centuries to achieve—such as the deforestation of Europe in the medieval era—capitalism realized in mere decades. This world-historical rupture, argues Moore, can be explained through a law of value that regards labor productivity as the decisive metric of wealth and power in the modern world. From this standpoint, the genius of capitalist development has been to appropriate uncommodified natures—including uncommodified human natures—as a means of advancing labor productivity in the commodity system.

====Societal-environment dialectic====

In 1975, the highly influential work of Allan Schnaiberg transfigured environmental sociology, proposing a societal-environmental dialectic, though within the &#x27;neo-Marxist&#x27; framework of the relative autonomy of the state as well. This conflictual concept has overwhelming political salience. First, the economic synthesis states that the desire for economic expansion will prevail over ecological concerns. Policy will decide to maximize immediate economic growth at the expense of environmental disruption. Secondly, the managed scarcity synthesis concludes that governments will attempt to control only the most dire of environmental problems to prevent health and economic disasters. This will give the appearance that governments act more environmentally consciously than they really do. Third, the ecological synthesis generates a hypothetical case where environmental degradation is so severe that political forces would respond with sustainable policies. The driving factor would be economic damage caused by environmental degradation. The economic engine would be based on renewable resources at this point. Production and consumption methods would adhere to sustainability regulations.

These conflict-based syntheses have several potential outcomes. One is that the most powerful economic and political forces will preserve the status quo and bolster their dominance. Historically, this is the most common occurrence. Another potential outcome is for contending powerful parties to fall into a stalemate. Lastly, tumultuous social events may result that redistribute economic and political resources.

In 1980, the highly influential work of Allan Schnaiberg entitled &quot;The Environment: From Surplus to Scarcity&quot; (1980)
was a large contribution to this theme of a societal-environmental dialectic.

===Ecological modernization and reflexive modernization===

By the 1980s, a critique of eco-Marxism was in the offing, given empirical data from countries (mostly in Western Europe like the Netherlands, Western Germany and somewhat the United Kingdom) that were attempting to wed environmental protection with economic growth instead of seeing them as separate. This was done through both state and capital restructuring. Major proponents of this school of research are Arthur P.J. Mol and Gert Spaargaren. Popular examples of ecological modernization would be &quot;cradle to cradle&quot; production cycles, industrial ecology, large-scale organic agriculture, biomimicry, permaculture, agroecology and certain strands of sustainable development—all implying that economic growth is possible if that growth is well organized with the environment in mind.

Reflexive modernization

The many volumes of the German sociologist Ulrich Beck first argued from the late 1980s that our risk society is potentially being transformed by the environmental social movements of the world into structural change without rejecting the benefits of modernization and industrialization. This is leading to a form of &#x27;reflexive modernization&#x27; with a world of reduced risk and better modernization process in economics, politics, and scientific practices as they are made less beholden to a cycle of protecting risk from correction (which he calls our state&#x27;s organized irresponsibility)—politics creates ecodisasters, then claims responsibility in an accident, yet nothing remains corrected because it challenges the very structure of the operation of the economy and the private dominance of development, for example. Beck&#x27;s idea of a reflexive modernization looks forward to how our ecological and social crises in the late 20th century are leading toward transformations of the whole political and economic system&#x27;s institutions, making them more &quot;rational&quot; with ecology in mind.

=== Neo-Liberalism ===
Neo-liberalism includes deregulation, free market capitalism, and aims at reducing government spending. These Neo-liberal policies greatly affect environmental sociology. Since Neo-liberalism includes deregulation and essentially less government involvement, this leads to the commodification and privatization of unowned, state-owned, or common property resources. Diana Liverman and Silvina Vilas mentions that this results in payments for environmental services; deregulation and cuts in public expenditure for environmental management; the opening up of trade and investment; and transfer of environmental management to local or nongovernmental institutions. The privatization of these resources have impacts on society, the economy, and to the environment. An example that has greatly affected society is the privatization of water.

===Social construction of the environment===

Additionally in the 1980s, with the rise of postmodernism in the western academy and the appreciation of discourse as a form of power, some sociologists turned to analyzing environmental claims as a form of social construction more than a &#x27;material&#x27; requirement. Proponents of this school include John A. Hannigan, particularly in &quot;Environmental Sociology: A Social Constructionist Perspective&quot; (1995). Hannigan argues for a &#x27;soft constructionism&#x27; (environmental problems are materially real though they require social construction to be noticed) over a &#x27;hard constructionism&#x27; (the claim that environmental problems are entirely social constructs).

Although there was sometimes acrimonious debate between the constructivist and realist &quot;camps&quot; within environmental sociology in the 1990s, the two sides have found considerable common ground as both increasingly accept that while most environmental problems have a material reality they nonetheless become known only via human processes such as scientific knowledge, activists&#x27; efforts, and media attention. In other words, most environmental problems have a real ontological status despite our knowledge/awareness of them stemming from social processes, processes by which various conditions are constructed as problems by scientists, activists, media and other social actors. Correspondingly, environmental problems must all be understood via social processes, despite any material basis they may have external to humans. This interactiveness is now broadly accepted, but many aspects of the debate continue in contemporary research in the field.

==Events==

===Modern environmentalism===

United States

The 1960s built strong cultural momentum for environmental causes, giving birth to the modern environmental movement and large questioning in sociologists interested in analyzing the movement. Widespread green consciousness moved vertically within society, resulting in a series of policy changes across many states in the U.S. and Europe in the 1970s. In the United States, this period was known as the &quot;Environmental Decade&quot; with the creation of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and passing of the Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, and amendments to the Clean Air Act. Earth Day of 1970, celebrated by millions of participants, represented the modern age of environmental thought. The environmental movement continued with incidences such as Love Canal.

===Historical studies===
While the current mode of thought expressed in environmental sociology was not prevalent until the 1970s, its application is now used in analysis of ancient peoples. Societies including Easter Island, the Anaszi, and the Mayans were argued to have ended abruptly, largely due to poor environmental management. This has been challenged in later work however as the exclusive cause (biologically trained Jared Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Collapse&quot; (2005); or more modern work on Easter Island). The collapse of the Mayans sent a historic message that even advanced cultures are vulnerable to ecological suicide—though Diamond argues now it was less of a suicide than an environmental climate change that led to a lack of an ability to adapt—and a lack of elite willingness to adapt even when faced with the signs much earlier of nearing ecological problems. At the same time, societal successes for Diamond included New Guinea and Tikopia island whose inhabitants have lived sustainably for 46,000 years.

John Dryzek et al. argue in &quot;Green States and Social Movements: Environmentalism in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Norway&quot; (2003) that there may be a common global green environmental social movement, though its specific outcomes are nationalist, falling into four &#x27;ideal types&#x27; of interaction between environmental movements and state power. They use as their case studies environmental social movements and state interaction from Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany. They analyze the past 30 years of environmentalism and the different outcomes that the green movement has taken in different state contexts and cultures.

Recently and roughly in temporal order below, much longer-term comparative historical studies of environmental degradation are found by sociologists. There are two general trends: many employ world systems theory—analyzing environmental issues over long periods of time and space; and others employ comparative historical methods. Some utilize both methods simultaneously, sometimes without reference to world systems theory (like Whitaker, see below).

Stephen G. Bunker (d. 2005) and Paul S. Ciccantell collaborated on two books from a world-systems theory view, following commodity chains through history of the modern world system, charting the changing importance of space, time, and scale of extraction and how these variables influenced the shape and location of the main nodes of the world economy over the past 500 years. Their view of the world was grounded in extraction economies and the politics of different states that seek to dominate the world&#x27;s resources and each other through gaining hegemonic control of major resources or restructuring global flows in them to benefit their locations.

The three volume work of environmental world-systems theory by Sing C. Chew analyzed how &quot;Nature and Culture&quot; interact over long periods of time, starting with &quot;World Ecological Degradation&quot; (2001) In later books, Chew argued that there were three &quot;Dark Ages&quot; in world environmental history characterized by periods of state collapse and reorientation in the world economy associated with more localist frameworks of community, economy, and identity coming to dominate the nature/culture relationships after state-facilitated environmental destruction delegitimized other forms. Thus recreated communities were founded in these so-called &#x27;Dark Ages,&#x27; novel religions were popularized, and perhaps most importantly to him the environment had several centuries to recover from previous destruction. Chew argues that modern green politics and bioregionalism is the start of a similar movement of the present day potentially leading to wholesale system transformation. Therefore, we may be on the edge of yet another global &quot;dark age&quot; which is bright instead of dark on many levels since he argues for human community returning with environmental healing as empires collapse.

More case oriented studies were conducted by historical environmental sociologist Mark D. Whitaker analyzing China, Japan, and Europe over 2,500 years in his book &quot;Ecological Revolution&quot; (2009). He argued that instead of environmental movements being &quot;New Social Movements&quot; peculiar to current societies, environmental movements are very old—being expressed via religious movements in the past (or in the present like in ecotheology) that begin to focus on material concerns of health, local ecology, and economic protest against state policy and its extractions. He argues past or present is very similar: that we have participated with a tragic common civilizational process of environmental degradation, economic consolidation, and lack of political representation for many millennia which has predictable outcomes. He argues that a form of bioregionalism, the bioregional state, is required to deal with political corruption in present or in past societies connected to environmental degradation.

After looking at the world history of environmental degradation from very different methods, both sociologists Sing Chew and Mark D. Whitaker came to similar conclusions and are proponents of (different forms of) bioregionalism.

<text>St. Mary&#x27;s Church (in full, the Church of St. Mary the Virgin), Putney, is an Anglican church in Putney, London, sited next to the River Thames, beside the southern approach to Putney Bridge. There has been a centre of Christian worship on this site from at least the 13th century, and the church is still very active today. It is also noteworthy because in 1647, during the English Civil War, the church was the site of the Putney Debates on the English constitution. It has been Grade II* listed since 1955.

The building itself has seen many changes; parts of the existing church have survived from medieval times, such as the 15th-century tower and some of the nave arcading, and the early 16th-century Bishop West Chapel, built by Bishop Nicholas West. Most of the building, however, dates from the substantial reconstruction of 1836 to the designs of Edward Lapidge. He largely rebuilt the body of the church in yellow brick with stone dressings and perpendicular windows. Some of the medieval pillars and arches in the nave were retained, but both the north and the south arcades were widened.

In 1973 an arson gutted of much of the church. Rebuilding was not completed until nearly ten years later, when the church was rehallowed by Rt. Revd. Michael Marshall the Bishop of Woolwich, on 6 February 1982. Since the restoration, the altar has not been positioned, as is usual, in the chancel or even at the eastern end of the nave, but instead halfway down the northern side of the nave, with the seating arranged to reflect this. The architect of the restoration was Ronald Sims. The pipe organ is by the Danish firm of Marcussen &amp; Søn.

Inscribed on a wall of the church is a quote from the Putney debates (1647) by Colonel Thomas Rainsborough:
In 2005 a new extension to the church, the &quot;Brewer Building&quot;, built at a cost of £1.7m was opened by the Bishop of Southwark.

St. Mary&#x27;s is one of the two churches in the Parish of Putney, the other being All Saints&#x27; Church, Putney Common. The parish is within the Wandsworth Deanery, the Kingston Episcopal Area and the Diocese of Southwark.

== Notable people associated with St Mary&#x27;s ==

* Nicholas West (1461 – 28 April 1533), bishop and diplomat, was born at Putney, and educated at Eton and at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, of which he became a fellow in 1486. He built two chapels, one in St. Mary&#x27;s and the other in Ely Cathedral, where he is buried.
* Thomas Cromwell, born in Putney, was Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1533 and 1540.
* Samuel Pepys mentions St. Mary&#x27;s in his diary for 1667. He attended a service where he heard &#x27;a good sermon&#x27;. He saw the girls of the school, &#x27;few of which were pretty&#x27;.
* Charles Dickens made St. Mary&#x27;s the setting for David Copperfield&#x27;s marriage to Dora Spenlow.
* Giles Fraser, Anglican priest and broadcaster, was a former Team Rector of St Mary&#x27;s 2000-2009, where he campaigned to raise the profile of the Putney Debates.

<doc id="506443" wikidata="Q10843474" url="?curid=506443" title="Professional diving">
<text>Professional diving is underwater diving where the divers are paid for their work. Occupational diving has a similar meaning and applications. The procedures are often regulated by legislation and codes of practice as it is an inherently hazardous occupation and the diver works as a member of a team. Due to the dangerous nature of some professional diving operations, specialized equipment such as an on-site hyperbaric chamber and diver-to-surface communication system is often required by law, and the mode of diving for some applications may be regulated.

There are several branches of professional diving, the best known of which is probably commercial diving and its specialised applications, offshore diving, inshore civil engineering diving, marine salvage diving, hazmat diving, and ships husbandry diving. There are also applications in scientific research, marine archaeology, fishing and aquaculture, public service, law enforcement, military service, media work and diver training.

Any person wishing to become a professional diver normally requires specific training that satisfies any regulatory agencies which have regional or national authority, such as US Occupational Safety and Health Administration, United Kingdom Health and Safety Executive or South African Department of Employment and Labour. International recognition of professional diver qualifications and registration exists between some countries.

==Procedural aspects==
The primary procedural distinction between professional and recreational diving is that the recreational diver is responsible primarily for their own actions and safety but may voluntarily accept limited responsibility for dive buddies, whereas the professional diver is part of a team of people with extensive responsibilities and obligations to each other and usually to an employer or client, and these responsibilities and obligations are formally defined in contracts, legislation, regulations, operations manuals, standing orders and compulsory or voluntary codes of practice. In many cases a statutory national occupational health and safety legislation constrains their activities. The purpose of recreational diving is basically for personal entertainment, while the professional diver has a job to do, and diving is necessary to get that job done. Recreational diving instruction and dive leadership are legally considered professional diving in some jurisdictions, particularly when the diver is employed for that purpose.

===Diving operations===

A diving operation is a professional dive and the activity in preparation for, and in support of, the specific dive. The diving operation is controlled by the diving supervisor, is expected to follow the dive plan, is conducted by the diving team, and is recorded in the diving operations record (though the terms may have regional variations). A diving operation is over when the last diver has completed decompression and is out of the water.

===Diving projects===
A diving project is a coordinated set of diving operations for a particular purpose, often the responsibility of a diving contractor. This would include mobilisation and setup of the diving spread at the start, and demobilisation at the end of the project. Depending on the size of the project, the project manager may be the senior supervisor, or the diving superintendent.

===Diving contractor===
A diving contractor is the legal entity responsible for the execution of diving operations for a client. The diving contractor is responsible for ensuring that the diving operations are safe, that a competent diving team is appointed, and the contracted work is done to specifications.

=== Diving team ===

A diving team is a group of people who conduct a diving operation. A characteristic of professional diving is the specification for minimum personnel for the diving support team. This typically specifies the minimum number of team members and their appointed responsibilities in the team based on the circumstances and mode of diving, and the minimum qualifications for specified members of the diving team. The minimum team requirements may be specified by regulation or code of practice. Specific appointments within a dive team for which competences are specified and registration may be required are listed below.

Core diving team:
* 
* 
* – On telephonic standby.
Additional member for surface-supplied air diving using a low pressure compressor:
Additional member for bell diving:
* Launch and recovery system winch operator
Additional member for dives with a chamber on site:
Additional member for surface-supplied mixed gas diving:
Additional members for offshore diving:
* 
Additional personnel for saturation diving:
* - One per shift.
Additional members for remotely operated underwater vehicle support:
* 

=== Regulation of activities ===

Professional diving activities are generally regulated by health and safety legislation, but in some cases may be exempted from the national or state diving regulations for specific diving applications, such as scientific diving or public safety diving, when they operate under a recognised code of practice for that application.

=== Codes of practice ===

A code of practice for professional diving is a document that complements occupational health and safety laws and regulations to provide detailed practical guidance on how to comply with legal obligations, and should be followed unless another solution with the same or better health and safety standard is in place, or may be a document for the same purpose published by a self-regulating body to be followed by member organisations.

Codes of practice published by governments do not replace the occupational health and safety laws and regulations, and are generally issued in terms of those laws and regulations. They are intended to help understand how to comply with the requirements of regulations. A workplace inspector can refer to a code of practice when issuing an improvement or prohibition notice, and they may be admissible in court proceedings. A court may use a code of practice to establish what is reasonably practicable action to manage a specific risk. Equivalent or better ways of achieving the required work health and safety may be possible, so compliance with codes of practice is not usually mandatory, providing that any alternative systems used provide a standard of health and safety equal to or better than those recommended by the code of practice.

=== Operations manual ===
The operations manual is the diving contractor&#x27;s in-house documentation specifying the procedures authorised for diving operations conducted by the company. It will refer to relevant legislation and codes of practice and will specify the organisation of the company and the chain of responsibility. Standard operating procedures for the activities normally conducted by the company may be described in sufficient detail that all affected parties can understand how the organisation operates, or may refer to other documents such as the manufacturer&#x27;s maintenance instructions for details.

=== Records ===
Professional diving operations are generally required to be documented for legal reasons related to contractual obligations and health and safety. Divers are required to keep their personal diving logbooks up to date, supervisors are required to record the specifics of a diving operation on the diving operations record. The dive plan is generally documented, and includes a description of the planned work, specification of the equipment to be used, the expected dive profile, and the outcome of the relevant risk assessment.

==Branches of professional diving==

===Commercial diving===
Commercial diving may be considered an application of professional diving where the diver engages in underwater work for industrial, construction, engineering, maintenance or other commercial purposes which are similar to work done out of the water, and where the diving is usually secondary to the work.

In some legislation, commercial diving is defined as any diving done by an employee as part of their job, and for legal purposes this may include scientific, public safety, media, and military diving. That is similar to the definition for professional diving, but in those cases the difference is in the status of the diver within the organisation of the diving contractor. This distinction may not exist in other jurisdictions. In South Africa, any person who dives under the control and instructions of another person within the scope of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993, is within the scope of the Diving Regulations, 2009. In the UK, the Diving at Work Regulations, 1997, apply.

Major applications of commercial diving include:
* – Diving in support of civil engineering projects. 
**Inspection, nondestructive testing, and repair 
**
*
*

===Scientific diving===
Scientific diving is the use of diving techniques by scientists to study underwater what would normally be studied by scientists. Scientific divers are normally qualified scientists first and divers second, who use diving equipment and techniques as their way to get to the location of their fieldwork. The direct observation and manipulation of marine habitats afforded to scuba-equipped scientists have transformed the marine sciences generally, and marine biology and marine chemistry in particular. Underwater archeology and geology are other examples of sciences pursued underwater. Some scientific diving is carried out by universities in support of undergraduate or postgraduate research programs.

Government bodies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the UK Environment Agency carry out scientific diving to recover samples of water, marine organisms and sea, lake or riverbed material to examine for signs of pollution.

Equipment used varies widely in this field, but surface supplied equipment though quite uncommon in the UK is growing in popularity in the U.S. Most scientific dives are relatively short duration and shallow, and surface supplied equipment is cumbersome and relatively expensive. The safety record of scuba for scientific diving has been good, and it is considered acceptable for most scientific diving by several national and international codes of practice.

Not all scientific divers are professionals; some are amateurs who assist with research or contribute observations on citizen science projects out of personal interest.

Scientific diving organizations include:
* The American Academy of Underwater Sciences
* The European Scientific Diving Panel.
* The German Academy of Underwater Sciences.

=== Media diving ===
Media diving is the practice of underwater photography and underwater cinematography outside of normal recreational interests. Media diving is often carried out in support of television documentaries, such as the BBC series Planet Earth or movies, with feature films such as Titanic and The Perfect Storm featuring underwater photography or footage. Media divers are normally highly skilled camera operators who use diving as a method to reach their workplace, although some underwater photographers start as recreational divers and move on to make a living from their hobby.

Equipment in this field is varied with scuba and surface supplied equipment used, depending on requirements, but rebreathers are often used for wildlife related work as they are normally quiet, release few or no bubbles and allow the diver a lengthy bottom time with a reduced risk of frightening off the subject.

===Military and naval diving===

Military diving is diving carried out by military personnel in the course of their duties. There are a number of different specialisations in military diving; some depend on the branch of the military. Offensive activities include underwater demolition, infiltration and sabotage, this being the type of work done by units such as the UK Special Boat Service or the United States Navy SEALs. Defensive activities are centered around countering the threat of enemy special forces and enemy anti-shipping measures, and typically involve defusing mines, searching for explosive devices attached to the hulls of ships, and locating enemy frogmen in the water.

Military divers may need equipment which does not reveal their position and avoids setting off explosives, and to this end, they may use rebreathers which produce less noise due to bubbles emitted from the equipment, and few or no bubbles on the surface, and which contain no magnetic components, and the face-mask may be fitted with anti-reflective glass.

Naval diving is the military term for what civilians would call commercial diving. Naval divers work to support maintenance and repair operations on ships and military installations. Their equipment is derived from commercially available equipment, with the US Navy using versions of the Kirby Morgan helmets and full-face masks amongst other equipment. Typical tasks include:
* inspection, cleaning and maintenance of boats, ships, and underwater structures 
* demolition of shipwrecks, obstructing navigation and unexploded ordnance
* ship, submarine, downed aircraft, and other military hardware salvage or recovery
* underwater mine clearance
* investigating unidentified submerged divers

Some armies have their own diving personnel for inland water operations.

Experimental diving may be conducted by special units like the US Navy&#x27;s Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU) which involves meeting military needs through the research and development of diving practices and diving equipment, testing new types of equipment and finding more effective and safer ways to perform dives and related activities. The US NEDU was responsible for much of the experimental diving work to calculate and validate decompression tables and algorithms, and has since worked on such developments as heated diving suits powered by radioactive isotopes and mixed gas diving equipment, while the British equivalent (The Admiralty Experimental Diving Unit) developed the Mark 10 submarine escape suits used by both the Royal Navy and the US Navy.

===Police diving===
Police divers are normally police officers who have been trained in the use of diving techniques to recover evidence and occasionally bodies from underwater. They may also be employed in searching shipping for contraband attached to the outside of hulls to avoid detection by internal searches. The equipment they use depends on operational requirements, but a requirement for communications with the surface team would necessitate the use of full-face masks with voice communication equipment, either with scuba or surface-supplied equipment.

===Public safety diving===

Public safety diving is the underwater work conducted by law enforcement, fire rescue, and search &amp; rescue/recovery dive teams. Public safety divers differ from recreational, scientific and commercial divers who can generally plan the date, time, and location of a dive, and dive only if the conditions are conducive to the task. Public safety divers respond to emergencies at whatever time and place they occur, and may be required to dive at times and in circumstances where conditions and regulations may exempt them from some of the health and safety requirements of other professional divers at times when it appears possible that a living person may be rescued. In the US, many public safety divers are volunteers, but career law enforcement or fire rescue personnel also often take on these additional responsibilities as part of their occupation.

===Aquarium diving===

Aquarium divers normally hold some form of professional qualification, either as a commercial diver or a recognised recreational certification indicating sufficient competence. The work is varied but is centred around the maintenance of the tank, livestock and public entertainment. This includes:
*Feeding the animals 
*Tank cleaning and maintenance 
*Shows
*Taking members of the public into the tank

===Diving instructors===

Instructors for the professional classes of diving are generally qualified and experienced as divers, diving supervisors, and adult educators operating under the auspices of a governmental agency. Standards for instruction are authorized by those agencies to ensure safety during training and competence in the workplace. Commercial diving instructors are normally required to have commercial diving qualifications. They typically teach trainee commercial divers how to operate the types of diving equipment and typical underwater tools they will use in the course of their work as well as the skills required for diving safely with the relevant equipment.

Recreational diving instructors differ from other types of professional divers as they normally don&#x27;t require registration as commercial divers, but a relevant recreational qualification from a recognised certification agency and in-date membership or registration with that agency which permits them to teach and assess the competence of recreational divers to agency standards. Recreational dive instructors teach a wide variety of skills from entry-level diver training for beginners, to diver rescue for intermediate level divers and technical diving for divers who wish to dive in higher risk environments. They may operate from dedicated dive centres at coastal sites, or through hotels in popular holiday resorts or simply from local swimming pools. Initial training is carried out mainly on conventional open circuit scuba equipment but with the increasing availability of recreational rebreathers, their use is also taught. Not all recreational diving instructors are professionals; many are amateurs with careers outside the diving industry, but they work to the same training standards as the professionals, and will have the same duty of care for their trainees.

===Recreational dive leaders===

Professional underwater dive leaders (also referred to as divemasters) are quite commonly employed by dive centres, live-aboard dive boats and day charter boats to lead certified recreational divers and groups of divers on underwater excursions. These divemasters are generally expected to ensure that the customers are briefed on the conditions to be expected, the known hazards other than those inherent in the activity, and what the customer can reasonably expect to see during a dive. They are underwater tour guides, and as such are expected to know the level of certification and fitness needed for the planned dive, but are not generally considered responsible for ensuring that the customers are competent to the level of certification they hold, or for the personal safety of the customers during the dive. If the dive leader allocates dive buddies, they may thereby make themselves legally responsible for ensuring that the buddy pairs they allocate are appropriate. Any instruction given by the dive leader may make them liable for the reasonably foreseeable consequences of carrying out that instruction, though the customer is usually obliged to sign a waiver exonerating the dive guide for ordinary negligence. Not all recreational dive leaders are professionals; many are amateurs with careers outside the diving industry, and lead groups of friends or club members without financial reward. The internationally recognised minimum standard for a person professionally leading a group of certified recreational divers is ISO 24801-3 and the equivalent European Standard EN 14153–3. Most recreational diver training agencies have a certification meeting these standards.

==Equipment==

Diving equipment is equipment used by underwater divers to make diving activities possible, easier, safer and/or more comfortable. This may be equipment primarily intended for this purpose, or equipment intended for other purposes which is found to be suitable for diving use.

===Diving suit===

Depending on the water temperature, depth and duration of the planned dive, the diver will either use a wetsuit, dry suit or hot water suit. A wetsuit provides thermal insulation by layers of foam neoprene but the diver gets wet. Hot water diving suits are similar to a wetsuit but are flooded with warm water from a surface water heater that is then pumped to the diver via an umbilical. A dry suit is another method of insulation, operating by keeping the diver dry under the suit, and relies on either the suit material, the gas trapped in thermal undergarments, or both, to insulate the diver, and also provides better isolation from environmental contamination. Certain applications require a specific type of dive suit; long dives into deep, cold water normally require a hot water suit or dry suit, whilst diving into potentially contaminated environments requires a dry suit, dry hood, and dry gloves at a minimum, usually with a helmet sealed to the suit, or at least a positive pressure full-face mask, thereby keeping the diver completely isolated from the diving environment.

===Breathing apparatus===
A number of factors dictate the type of breathing apparatus used by the diver. Typical considerations include the length of the dive, water contamination, space constraints and vehicle access for support vehicles. Some disciplines will very rarely use surface supplied diving, such as scientific divers or military clearance divers, whilst commercial divers will rarely use scuba equipment.

====Scuba diving====
Scuba equipment is not commonly used in civilian commercial diving, but is often employed by scientific, media and military divers, sometimes as specialized equipment such as rebreathers, which are closed circuit scuba equipment that recycles exhaled breathing gas instead of releasing it into the water. The recycling of gas makes rebreathers advantageous for long duration dives, more efficient decompression is possible when the gas mix is adjustable, and observation of animals in the wild is facilitated due to the lack of noisy exhaust bubbles. These characteristics also make rebreathers ideal for military use, such as when military divers are engaged in covert action where bubbles would alert the opposition to their presence, or when performing mine clearance where bubble noise could potentially trigger an explosion.

Open circuit scuba equipment is occasionally used by commercial divers working on sites where surface supplied equipment is unsuitable, such as around raised structures like a water tower, or in remote locations where it is necessary to carry equipment to the dive site. Normally, for comfort and for practicality, a full face mask such as those manufactured by Kirby Morgan will be used to allow dive lights and video cameras to be mounted on the mask. The benefit of full-face masks is that they can normally also be used with surface supplied equipment, removing the need for the diver or the company to have two sets of expensive equipment.

====Surface-supplied diving====

This is, perhaps, the most common type of equipment used in professional diving, and the one most recognised by the public. Surface-supplied equipment can be used with full face masks or diving helmets. Helmets are normally fitted with diver to surface communication equipment, and often with light sources and video equipment. The decision between wearing a full-face mask or a full diving helmet comes down to job requirements and personal preference; however, the impact protection and warmth offered by a full diving helmet makes it popular for underwater construction sites and cold water work.

Breathing gas for the diver is piped down from the surface, through a long, flexible hose, bundled with other services and called an diver&#x27;s umbilical. In addition to breathing gas, the umbilical will have additional hoses and cables for such things as communications equipment, a pneumofathometer for measuring depth, or hot water should the diver be using a hot water suit. The umbilical must be strong enough to support the diver&#x27;s weight, with a significant safety margin, because it may be used by surface personnel to pull the diver out of the water. The diver&#x27;s breathing gas is pumped down from either high pressure tanks or through a gas compressor.

====Saturation diving====

If the diver is to work at fairly constant depths for periods which would require long periods for decompression, the diver may live in a special underwater habitat or a pressurised surface habitat called a saturation system. This type of diving is known as saturation diving. The same technique for supplying breathing gas as regular surface supplied diving is used, with the diving bell receiving breathing gas and other essential services from a diving support vessel on the surface. If diving at extreme depths, helium-based breathing gas mixtures are used to prevent nitrogen narcosis and oxygen toxicity which would otherwise occur due to the high ambient pressure. The diver is decompressed only once, at the end of the job, which saves time and reduces risk of decompression injury.

==Training and registration==


Diver training is the set of processes through which a person learns the necessary and desirable skills to safely dive underwater within the scope of the diver training standard relevant to the specific training programme. Most diver training follows procedures and schedules laid down in the associated training standard, in a formal training programme, and includes relevant foundational knowledge of the underlying theory, including some basic physics, physiology and environmental information, practical skills training in the selection and safe use of the associated equipment in the specified underwater environment, and assessment of the required skills and knowledge deemed necessary by the certification agency to allow the newly certified diver to dive within the specified range of conditions at an acceptable level of risk. Recognition of prior learning is allowed in some training standards.

Professional diver certification is generally in terms of a diver training standard published by a national government organisation or department, or an international organisation of which such national bodies are members. Training standards specify the mode of diving, equipment and scope of operations for divers registered in terms of that standard. International recognition of professional diver certification may require registration through a national government agency or an agency appointed by a national government for this purpose.

Diver training is closely associated with diver certification or registration, the process of application for and issue of formal recognition of competence by a certification agency or registration authority.

Work skills specific to the underwater environment may be included in diver trailing programmes, but are also often provided independently, either as job training for a specific operation, or as generic training by specialists in the fields.

===Regional requirements===

====Australia====
The Australian Diver Accreditation Scheme (ADAS) is an international commercial and occupational diver certification scheme administered on a cost-recovery basis by the ADAS Board under the direction of the Australian Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism. It has mutual recognition arrangements with other equivalent national schemes. The original Australian and New Zealand (NZ) national occupational diver certification scheme was developed by the Australian government as a not-for-profit accreditation and certification scheme. Training is provided by Accredited Training Establishments (ATEs) which are required to operate at the level of international best practice as defined by ADAS. The scheme provides certification of divers and accreditation of training establishments, develops training courses to meet industry needs, and promotes the mobility of ADAS licence holders around the world. Australian commercial divers are trained in accordance with Australian Standard AS 2815.

====Canada====
The Diver Certification Board of Canada certifies occupational divers, accredits schools which train occupational divers. The DCBC is a federally incorporated not-for-profit body which was originally set up to replace the offshore diver certification regime of the National Energy Board and the offshore petroleum boards. DCBC is the only national body which certifies offshore and inshore commercial divers in Canada.

The DCBC offers certification to commercial divers and supervisors who can demonstrate that they have sufficient training and experience to enable them to meet the competency requirements of the appropriate section of the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Competency Standard for Diving Operations (CSA Standard Z275.4). Certificates issued by the DCBC are recognized by Australia (ADAS), France, Norway, South Africa (DoL), the United Kingdom (HSE) and the International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA). The Diver Certification Board of Canada accredits commercial diver training organizations which train to the competency levels described in CSA Standard Z275.4. Accredited commercial diver training organizations can also assess the competency of experienced commercial divers who were not trained at an accredited school, a form of recognition of prior learning.

====Denmark====
All professional diving activities carried out on Danish national territory (included its continental shelf and from Danish offshore vessels and platforms) must comply with the provisions of the Consolidated act on diving operations and diving equipment, etc. and Order no. 1395 on the safe performance of diving operations. Diving operations in Greenland are subject to different regulations.

The Danish Maritime Authority oversees all diving operations. In order to perform diving works professional must have completed and passed training programs in the approved diving schools. Training contents must comply with national and IDSA training standards.

====Poland====
In Poland &quot;commercial diver&quot; is a state-regulated profession and qualifications are awarded by the Maritime Office in Gdynia, according the Polish law of 17 October 2003.

There are four levels of diving qualifications for divers and supervisors. The diver&#x27;s cards and logbooks are legally protected documents.

====South Africa====
In South Africa the Department of Employment and Labour regulates the activities of people who dive as part of their employment, except for those involved in diving connected to minerals and energy, who are nominally controlled by the Department of Minerals and Energy. Military diving is also officially within the jurisdiction of the Department of Employment and Labour, but provided the diving is conducted within the requirements of SA Naval Operations Publication 96 it is deemed to comply with the Diving Regulations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1993.

All commercial diver training is within the scope of the Diving Regulations, but recreational diver training and dive leading (divemasters) are specifically excluded from the regulations, though still subject to general provisions of the Occupational Health and Safety Act.

Commercial divers are registered with the Department of Employment and Labour after completing their training and assessment at registered commercial diving schools. The standard of training is officially specified in the Commercial Diver Training Standards for each class of diver, but the precise definitions for many of the specified items is unclear. However this is not unlike the standards for training in several other countries, as the SA standards are similar to the standards published by the International Diving Regulators and Certifiers Forum (IDRCF) of which the SA Department of Employment and Labour is a member.

====United Kingdom====
In the UK, any person diving at work is required to hold a relevant qualification approved by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). Diving schools in the UK work towards a standard HSE approved qualification, whilst divers who have trained in other countries may find their existing qualifications meet the HSE standards, if not, additional training may be required. HSE approved qualifications are well known around the world and several diving qualifications from around the world are aligned with HSE standards, allowing any diver certified to a standard recognised by the HSE to work in the UK, an important location due to the North Sea oil industry. HSE commercial diver qualifications are recognized by Australia (ADAS), Canada (DCBC), France, Norway, South Africa (DoEL) and in part by the International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA).

There are several HSE qualifications, each focusing on a different type of equipment or type of diving activity, for instance the HSE Scuba qualification only recognises the holder&#x27;s competence to dive using scuba equipment. Training usually takes place at a residential school, with courses taking anything between 9 and 13 weeks although divers with existing qualifications, such as former military divers can take courses which build on their existing knowledge and experience. During training, divers will be taught how to use common types of diving equipment (nearly every school trains divers to use the Kirby Morgan equipment) and how to carry out underwater construction techniques such as welding and cutting.

In addition to practical skills training, there is classroom work, with divers learning subjects such as basic physics and physiology of diving and the use of decompression tables. First Aid courses are normally also a requirement for trainee divers, with the emphasis placed on dealing with decompression and other diving related injuries.

====United States====
====Others====
Other countries known to have nationally regulated training and registration systems:
*France
*Norway
===Engineer diver===
A Master&#x27;s degree titled &quot;Engineer Diver&quot;, for a professional who has the capacities, skills and knowledge needed to plan, manage and successfully execute an underwater operation concerning engineering practice, was proposed in 2007. The proposal does not appear to have been taken up.
Examples of businesses that might benefit from the proposed qualification are civil infrastructures contractors (above and below water) where inspections, and maintenance projects are carried out periodically. That is the case of underwater inspections of ports, offshore platforms, vessels, bridges and dams.

<text>Ferry Tales is a 2003 American short documentary film written, produced and directed by Katja Esson. It follows the conversations of women in the powder room of the Staten Island Ferry during the morning commute from Staten Island to Manhattan. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short.

==Production==
Inspired by an idea of Cassis Birgit Staudt, Katja Esson decided in July 2001 to create a sort of ‘working-girl’ documentary about the women who occupy the ladies&#x27; bathroom on the ferry each morning.

Filming took place soon after the September 11 attacks.

==Film Festivals &amp; Awards==

&quot;&#x27;Esson&#x27;s film gives a fantastic glimpse into one of the countless secret sub-cultures of New York. Her brilliant portrayal rethinks class and gender and turns our ideas of the suburban/urban divide on their head&#x27;.&quot; (K.E. Flemming, New York University)

 Academy Award Nominee for Best Short Doc

Women&#x27;s Network Awards - Best Documentary Film

 Underdog Film Festival - Best Doc

 Annapolis Film Festival - Honorable Mention

 Woodstock Film Festival - Honorable Mention

<doc id="506450" wikidata="Q803692" url="?curid=506450" title="Pai Hsien-yung">
<text>Kenneth Hsien-yung Pai (; born July 11, 1937) is a Chinese writer based in Taiwan who has been described as a &quot;melancholy pioneer&quot;. He was born in Guilin, Guangxi at the cusp of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Pai&#x27;s father was the Kuomintang (KMT) general Bai Chongxi (Pai Chung-hsi), whom he later described as a &quot;stern, Confucian father&quot; with &quot;some soft spots in his heart.&quot; Pai was diagnosed with tuberculosis at the age of seven, during which time he would have to live in a separate house from his siblings (of which he would have a total of nine). He lived with his family in Chongqing, Shanghai, and Nanjing before moving to the British-controlled Hong Kong in 1948 as CPC forces turned the tide of the Chinese Civil War. In 1952, Pai and his family resettled in Taiwan, where the KMT had relocated the Republic of China after defeat by the Communists in 1949.
==Chronology==
Pai studied in La Salle College, a Hong Kong Catholic boys&#x27; high school, until he left for Taiwan with his family. In 1956, Pai enrolled at National Cheng Kung University as a hydraulic engineering major because he wanted to participate in the Three Gorges Dam Project. The following year, he passed the entrance examination for the foreign literature department of National Taiwan University and transferred there to study English literature. In September 1958, after completing his first year of study, he published his first short story &quot;Madame Ching&quot; in the magazine &quot;Literature&quot;. Two years later, he collaborated with several NTU classmates—e.g., Chen Ruoxi, Wang Wen-hsing, Ouyang Tzu—to launch &quot;Modern Literature&quot; (Xiandai wenxue), in which many of his early works were published. He was also known to frequent the Cafe Astoria in Taipei.

Pai went to the US in 1963 to study literary theory and creative writing at the University of Iowa in the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop. That same year, Pai&#x27;s mother, the parent with whom Pai had the closest relationship, died, and he attributes this to the melancholy that pervades his work. After earning his M.A. from Iowa, he became a professor of Chinese literature at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and has resided in Santa Barbara ever since. Pai retired from UCSB in 1994. Pai&#x27;s cousin is Hong Kong radio personality Pamela Peck.

==Major works==
Pai&#x27;s most famous work of fiction, &quot;Taipei People&quot; (, 1971), is a seminal work of Chinese modernism that mixes both literary Chinese and experimental modernist techniques. In terms of his choice of themes, Pai&#x27;s work is also far ahead of its time. His novel, &quot;Crystal Boys&quot; (, 1983), tells the story of a group of homosexual youths living in 1960s Taipei, largely from the viewpoint of a gay youth who is thrown out of his father&#x27;s home. The novel&#x27;s comparison of the dark corners of Taipei&#x27;s New Park, the characters&#x27; main cruising area, with the cloistered society of Taiwan of that period proved quite unacceptable to Taipei&#x27;s then KMT-dominated establishment, though Pai has generally remained a loyal KMT supporter.

==Influence==
Among other writers in Taiwan, Pai is appreciated for sophisticated narratives that introduce controversial and groundbreaking perspectives to Chinese literature. His major works, discussed above, have been widely influential.

Further, Pai&#x27;s writings while in the US in the early 1960s have greatly contributed to an understanding of the Chinese experience in postwar America. &quot;Death in Chicago&quot; (1964) is a semi-autobiographical account of a young Chinese man who, on the eve of his graduation from the English Literature department of the University of Chicago, discovers that his mother has died back home. &quot;Pleasantville&quot; (1964) explores the depressed state of a Chinese mother in the upper-class New York suburbs who feels alienated by the Americanization of her Chinese husband and daughter. Both &quot;Death in Chicago&quot; and &quot;Pleasantville&quot; subtly criticize America as a superficial and materialistic culture that can cause immigrant Chinese to feel lonely and isolated.

In recent years, Pai has gained some acclaim in Mainland Chinese literary circles. He has held various lectures at Beijing Normal University, among others. In the &quot;Beijing University Selection of Modern Chinese Literature: 1949–1999&quot; published in 2002, three of Pai&#x27;s works are included under the time period 1958–1978. These stories reflect the decadence of Shanghai high society in the Republican era. This subject matter constitutes only a small segment of Pai&#x27;s diverse work, yet it fits particularly well with orthodox renditions of pre-1949 history taught on the Mainland.

In April 2000, a series of five books representing Pai&#x27;s lifework was published by Huacheng Publishing House in Guangzhou. This series is widely available in Mainland bookstores. It includes short stories, essays, diary entries, and the novel &quot;Niezi&quot;. A lengthy preface in Volume 1 was penned by Ou Yangzi, a fellow member of the group that founded the journal &quot;Xiandai Wenxue&quot; in Taiwan in the 1950s.

Pai was born Muslim, attended missionary Catholic schools and embraced Buddhist meditation practices in the United States.

<text>Commercial diving may be considered an application of professional diving where the diver engages in underwater work for industrial, construction, engineering, maintenance or other commercial purposes which are similar to work done out of the water, and where the diving is usually secondary to the work.

In some legislation, commercial diving is defined as any diving done by an employee as part of their job, and for legal purposes this may include scientific, public safety, media, and military diving. That is similar to the definition for professional diving, but in those cases the difference is in the status of the diver within the organisation of the diving contractor. This distinction may not exist in other jurisdictions. In South Africa, any person who dives under the control and instructions of another person within the scope of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993, is within the scope of the Diving Regulations, 2009.

== Applications of commercial diving ==

=== Offshore diving ===

Offshore diving is a well known branch of commercial diving, with divers working in support of the exploration and production sector of the oil and gas industry in places such as the Gulf of Mexico in the United States, the North Sea in the United Kingdom, and Norway and along the coast of Brazil. The work in this area of the industry includes maintenance of oil platforms and the building of underwater structures used in the production process.

Equipment used for offshore diving tends to be surface supplied equipment but this does vary depending on the nature of the work and location. For instance Gulf of Mexico-based divers may use wetsuits whereas North Sea divers need drysuits or even hot water suits due to the temperature of the water.

=== Civil engineering diving ===

Civil engineering works are one of the major applications of inshore and inland coastal diving projects. Much of the work is either underwater inspection or engineering construction or repair work. The types of dive sites involved is varied, and divers can be found working in harbours and lakes, on hydroelectric dams, in rivers and around bridges and pontoons, with a large amount of this work being done in freshwater. Divers may be required to inspect and repair outfalls with penetrations exceeding , which require special safety precautions.

The equipment used does depend on the nature of the work and location, but normally surface oriented surface-supplied diving equipment is used. Saturation diving may be used for major projects in deep water, and scuba may occasionally be used for inspections or light work where the regulations or code of practice permit.

==== Construction and repair ====
Construction:

Concrete work:
*Clearing and preparation. Dredging, airlifting, waterjetting, In-water surface cleaning. Shuttering and formwork, bagwork. Reinforcement. Underwater concrete placement - Tremie, pumped concrete, skip placement, toggle bags, grouted aggregate.
*Concrete repair: Grouting

Fixing bolts: Drilling and core drilling

Pipe installation (Outfalls) Pipeline support and protection, Mattresses (ballast for stabilising pipelines),

==== Inspection and non-destructive testing ====


===Hazmat diving===
HAZMAT diving is one of the most dangerous branches of the commercial diving industry, employing highly skilled and experienced staff.

Typical work involves diving into raw sewage or dangerous chemicals, such as paper pulp, liquid cement, or oil sludge. This leads to special requirements:
* The divers may need to be vaccinated against diseases such as hepatitis and tetanus.
* Suitable equipment and competent personnel are required for decontamination of the diver and diving equipment after a dive.
* Emergency procedures appropriate to the specific hazmat environment must be planned and equipment and personnel in place to safely recover the diver if something goes wrong.
* Personnel must be monitored after exposure for possible long term effects.

The tasks a diver may be required to do in a contaminated environment include:
* Essential maintenance of underwater valves and sluice gates.
* Repairing damaged pipelines.
* Pollution control work to contain, control and clean up after a pollution incident.
* Sampling activities, such as those performed by United States Environmental Protection Agency. units specializing in polluted water diving, and the Environmental Response Team dive units.
* Diving in landfill sites to maintain the pumping equipment, vital in preventing landfill sites from filling up with rainwater and contaminating the water table.
* Maintenance and repair work inside functioning sewers , sewage treatment works, or working in septic tanks.
* Maintenance and repair work in nuclear plant.
* Miscellaneous repairs and finding lost objects.
* Finding and recovering corpses after crimes, accidents and disasters. - This work is usually done by police divers and public safety divers, though military divers may be called in to assist for major incidents.

=== Potable water diving ===
Potable water diving is diving in a tank for potable water. This is usually done for inspection and cleaning tasks. A person who is trained to do this work may be described as a potable water diver. The risks to the diver associated with potable water diving are related to the access, confined spaces and outlets for the water. The risk of contamination of the water is managed by isolating the diver in a clean dry-suit and helmet or full-face mask which are decontaminated before the dive.

=== Salvage diving ===

Salvage diving is the diving work associated with the recovery of all or part of ships, their cargoes, aircraft, and other vehicles and structures which have sunk or fallen into water. In the case of ships it may also refer to repair work done to make an abandoned or distressed but still floating vessel more suitable for towing or propulsion under its own power.

Most salvage diving is commercial work, or military work, depending on the diving contractor and the purpose for the salvage operation, Clearance diving, the removal of obstructions and hazards to navigation, is closely related to salvage diving, but has a different purpose, in that the objects to be removed are not intended to be recovered, just removed or reduced to a condition where they no longer constitute a hazard. Many of the techniques and procedures used in clearance diving are also used in salvage work.

=== Ships husbandry diving ===

Ships husbandry is the maintenance, cleaning, and general upkeep of the hull, rigging, and equipment of a ship, and may also refer to aspects of maintenance which are not specifically covered by the technical departments.

Underwater ship husbandry includes:
* Underwater hull cleaning to remove fouling organisms which increase drag, and therefore reduce top speed and increase fuel consumption. Such cleaning may be of the entire hull or parts thereof, particularly propellers, shafts and thrusters.
* Non-destructive testing and inspection including fouling surveys, inspection of known or suspected damage to structure, equipment or coatings, and inspection of repairs. 
* Underwater repair of structure, appendages, and equipment, and small areas of paintwork.

==Equipment==

===Diving suit===

Depending on the water temperature, depth and duration of the planned dive, the diver will either use a wetsuit, dry suit or hot water suit. A wetsuit provides thermal insulation by layers of foam neoprene but the diver gets wet. Hot water diving suits are similar to a wetsuit but are flooded with warm water from a surface water heater that is then pumped to the diver via an umbilical. A dry suit is another method of protection, operating by keeping the diver dry under the suit, and relies on either the suit material or the air trapped in thermal undergarments to insulate the diver, and also provides better isolation from environmental contamination. Certain applications require a specific type of dive suit; long dives into deep, cold water normally require a hot water suit or dry suit, whilst diving into potentially contaminated environments requires a dry suit, dry hood, and dry gloves at a minimum, thereby keeping the diver completely isolated from the diving environment.

===Breathing apparatus===

A number of factors dictate the type of breathing apparatus used by the diver. Typical considerations include the length of the dive, water contamination, space constraints and vehicle access for support vehicles. Commercial divers will rarely use scuba equipment for occupational health and safety reasons.

====Scuba diving====

Open circuit scuba equipment is occasionally used by commercial divers working on sites where surface supplied equipment is unsuitable, such as around raised structures like a water tower, or in remote locations where it is necessary to carry equipment to the dive site. Normally, for comfort and for practicality, a full face mask such as those manufactured by Kirby Morgan will be used to allow torches and video cameras to be mounted onto the mask. The benefit of full-face masks is that they are considered safer, as they protect the airway, and can normally be used with surface supplied equipment as well as scuba, reducing the need for contractor to have two different sets of equipment and the spares to service them.

====Surface-supplied diving====

This is the most common type of equipment used in professional diving, and the one most recognised by the public. Surface-supplied equipment can be used with full face masks or diving helmets, which are normally fitted with diver to surface communication equipment, and often with light sources and video equipment. The decision between wearing a full-face mask or a full diving helmet comes down to job requirements and personal preference, however the impact protection and warmth offered by a full diving helmet makes it popular for underwater construction sites and cold water work.

Breathing gas for the diver is piped down from the surface, through a long, flexible hose, bundled with other services and called an diver&#x27;s umbilical. In addition to breathing gas, the umbilical will have additional hoses and cables for such things as communications equipment, a pneumofathometer for measuring depth, or hot water should the diver be using a hot water suit. The umbilical must be strong enough to support the diver&#x27;s weight, with a significant safety margin, and securely connected to the diver&#x27;s harness, because it may be used by surface personnel to pull the diver out of the water. Breathing gas is may be supplied from either high pressure storage cylinders or through a gas compressor. An emergency gas supply is carried by the diver.

====Saturation diving====

If the diver is to work at fairly constant depths for periods which would require long periods for decompression, the diver may temporarily live in a pressurised surface habitat called a saturation system, and be transported under pressure in a closed bell to and from the underwater workplace. The various chambers, including the diving bell to bring the divers to their work site, are called Pressure vessel for human occupancy.This type of diving is known as saturation diving. The same techniques for supplying breathing gas are used as in surface oriented surface-supplied diving, with the diving bell receiving breathing gas and other essential services from the surface. If diving at extreme depths, helium-based breathing gas mixtures are used to prevent nitrogen narcosis and oxygen toxicity which would otherwise occur due to the high ambient pressure. The diver is decompressed only once, at the end of the job, which saves time and reduces risk of decompression injury.

== Training and registration ==

In most jurisdictions the diving training and certification is the same for all branches of commercial diving, but specialist training may be needed for specific work skills associated with the application.

Diver training is the set of processes through which a person learns the necessary and desirable skills to safely dive underwater within the scope of the diver training standard relevant to the specific training programme. Most diver training follows procedures and schedules laid down in the associated training standard, in a formal training programme, and includes relevant foundational knowledge of the underlying theory, including some basic physics, physiology and environmental information, practical skills training in the selection and safe use of the associated equipment in the specified underwater environment, and assessment of the required skills and knowledge deemed necessary by the certification agency to allow the newly certified diver to dive within the specified range of conditions at an acceptable level of risk. Recognition of prior learning is allowed in some training standards.

Diver training is closely associated with diver certification or registration, the process of application for and issue of formal recognition of competence by a certification agency or registration authority. Commercial diver certification is generally in terms of a diver training standard published by a national government organisation or department, or an international organisation of which such national bodies are members. Training standards specify the mode of diving, equipment and scope of operations for divers registered in terms of that standard. International recognition of professional diver certification may require registration through a national government agency or an agency appointed by a national government for this purpose.

Work skills specific to the underwater environment may be included in diver trailing programmes, but are also often provided independently, either as job training for a specific operation, or as generic training by specialists in the fields.

==Demographics==
US Bureau of Labor occupational employment statistics for May 2019 for commercial divers, excluding athletes and sports competitors, law enforcement personnel, and hunting and fishing workers. The national employment estimate is 3,420 employees, at a mean annual wage of $67,100 and mean hourly rate of $32.26 for this occupation, Actual rates can vary from about half to about twice these figures. Employment is concentrated in coastal states. These figures are slightly higher than for 2017.

==International commercial diving co-ordination and regulatory organisations==

=== Association of Commercial Diving Educators ===
The Association of Commercial Diving Educators, Inc. (ACDE) is a section 501 (c) (3) organization established in 1979 to communicate between industry and schools which provide commercial diver training. Membership includes US public and private educational organisations.

Goals: 
* To promote consistency and quality of commercial diver training amongst member schools.
* To provide oversight and quality assurance of the ANSI/ACDE-01-2015 National Training Standard.
* To communicate and participate with local, state and federal authorities, business, commerce and industry in the development and maintenance of high standards and sound policies in the field of diving education.
* To provide academic and training expertise to government training agencies and commercial diving industries and their representative organizations.

Member Schools
* The Ocean Corporation 
* Divers Academy International 
* International Diving Institute 
* Commercial Diving Academy 
* Louisiana Technical College 

The ANSI/ACDE-01-2015 Minimum Standard for Commercial Diver Training was revised and approved by ANSI in 2015.

=== Association of Diving Contractors International ===

The Association of Diving Contractors International (ADCI) is a non-profit organization which promotes standards and issues certifications for commercial diving skills. ADCI publishes &quot;Consensus Standards for Commercial Diving Operations&quot;, which defines qualifications for its diving certifications and safety procedures in underwater activities.
===European Diving Technology Committee===
The European Diving Technology Committee (EDTC) is tasked with promoting good standards for diving within Europe and where practicable, coordinating differing standards. As part of this work they publish high level minimum competence standards for inshore and offshore diving industry personnel as guidance for member states to encourage harmonisation of standards and facilitate international recognition of commercial diver qualifications.

=== International Marine Contractors Association ===

The International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA) is the international trade association representing offshore, marine, and underwater engineering companies. Contractors, suppliers, training establishments, personnel agencies and non-voting corresponding organisations (oil companies, governmental and regulatory bodies) can become members in one or more of the four divisions (Diving, Marine, Offshore Survey, Remote Systems &amp; ROV).

===International Diving Regulators and Certifiers Forum ===

The International Diving Regulators and Certifiers Forum (IDRCF) confirmed its principals and purpose at their meeting in London in September 2009. The statement of principals and purpose states “The forum has agreed to work together towards mutual recognition to identify and implement best practice in diver training and assessment with the objective of harmonising cross-border diver training outside Europe.” Members of the IDRCF include ADAS (Australia), DCBC (Canada), HSE (UK), PSA (Norway), and the Secretariat General to the Sea Progress Committee (France).

=== International Diving Schools Association ===

IThe International Diving Schools Association (DSA) was formed in 1982 with the primary purpose of developing common international standards for commercial diver training. 

The Association is concerned with offshore, inshore and inland commercial diving and some specialist non-diving qualifications such as diving supervisors, diving medical technicians and life support technicians. It has published international diver training standards based on the consensus opinion of members which provide a basic standard of comparison for commercial diver training standards, with the stated intention of:- 
*Improving safety
*Providing contractors with a direct input to the diver training syllabus
*Enabling contractors to bid across national borders on a more even playing field
*Improving diver quality
*Providing divers with greater job opportunities
IDSA provides a Table of Equivalence of various national commercial diver training standards.

== Safety record ==
Commercial diving remains a relatively dangerous occupation, but the rate of fatal accidents has decreased over the years.

<text>Phénix (French for ) was a small-scale (gross 264/net 233 MWe) prototype fast breeder reactor, located at the Marcoule nuclear site, near Orange, France. It was a pool-type liquid-metal fast breeder reactor cooled with liquid sodium. It generated 590 MW of thermal power, and had a breeding ratio of 1.16 (16% more plutonium produced than consumed), but normally had to be stopped for refueling operations every two months. Phénix continued operating after the closure of the subsequent full-scale prototype Superphénix in 1997. After 2004, its main use was investigation of transmutation of nuclear waste while also generating some electricity. Phénix was shut down in 2009.

The decommissioning project started in 2005. Between 2009 and 2011, the non-nuclear equipment and turbine hall were dismantled. The decommissioning license was expected for 2015. Finalising of the decommissioning process is expected between 2031 and 2043.

== History ==

Construction of Phénix began in November 1968. The first connection to the French national electricity grid was in December 1973.

Plans for a French fast reactor date as far back as 1958&#x27;s &quot;Rapsodie&quot;, and followed up in 1964 for a larger design with a power output of 1 GWe. Construction of the Rapsodie facility started in 1962 and went critical on 28 January 1967. It did not have power producing systems, but its 22 MW of thermal output (MWth) would translate to perhaps 9 MW of electrical output (MWe). Experiments on core configurations were carried out in the &quot;Masurca&quot; facility starting in 1966, and design of a larger power-producing facility was already well underway.

During the 1960s, interest in nuclear power was reaching a crescendo. For France, with little uranium supply of their own, large scale generation would be subject to supply constraints, especially given that nuclear power was experiencing a boom in construction that suggested the available supply would be limited even on a worldwide basis. In France&#x27;s plans, breeders would serve the twin purposes of producing fuel for their conventional light water reactor fleet, as well as producing that fuel from the waste fuel from those reactors, thereby reducing the amount of nuclear waste they would have to dispose of. Only a small number of breeders, estimated to be around 20, would be required to fuel the fleet of about 200 light water reactors.

France began construction of the Phénix demonstration plant in November 1968, only a year after Rapsodie went critical. It was fueled with 931 kg of highly enriched plutonium, around 77% Pu-239. The fuel load is capable of running for about 90 days maximum, but in practice it normally ran for two month periods. Due to its design, refueling required the reactor to be shut down. As a result, it had a low capacity factor (CF), on the order of 65%. As a prototype plant, a high CF was not a design goal, although any practical design would have to improve this. Phénix demonstrated a breeding ratio of 1.16, meaning it produced 16% more fuel than it consumed, while also producing 233 MWe in normal operation.

Phénix ran without problems through the 1970s and &#x27;80s, but in the early 1990s it began to demonstrate a number of unexplained behaviours, including large power transients. This had serious safety implications, and the reactor was repeatedly shut down, spending most of the period from 1991 to 1994 being studied while offline. The long offline period required it to be recertified, so the plant also underwent a significant refurbishment between 1994 and 2002. It was finally recertified in June 2003, but only at a reduced power of 130 MWe.

<text>Police diving is a branch of professional diving carried out by police services. Police divers are usually professional police officers, and may either be employed full-time as divers or as general water police officers, or be volunteers who usually serve in other units but are called in if their diving services are required.

The duties carried out by police divers include rescue diving for underwater casualties, under the general classification of public safety diving, and forensic diving, which is search and recovery diving for evidence and bodies.

==Scope==
Police diving includes forensic diving – the recovery of evidence from underwater – and public safety diving. Police diving work may include:
* Underwater searches
* Evidence recovery
* Submerged body recoveries (from accidents/suicides/crime victims)
* Anti-narcotics operations (inspecting ships hulls etc.)
* Anti-terrorism operations (explosive ordnance disposal, defense against swimmer incursions)
* Search and rescue operations
* Other maritime law enforcement

===Forensic diving===

Forensic diving is professional diving work related to the gathering of evidence for use in investigations and legal cases. Police divers may be called in to investigate and recover evidence in plane crashes, submerged vehicles, boating accidents, suicides, homicides, swimming fatalities and other incidents and crimes. Forensic divers may face a number of environmental hazards from underwater structures and infrastructure, debris, industrial pollution, medical waste, organic hazards from various sources, shifting currents, poor visibility, hypothermia and hyperthermia, for which special equipment may be required to mitigate the risk. Other specialised equipment could include locating devices, access equipment, and transportation. Underwater recovery efforts may include the use of trained dogs, which can detect human remains underwater at depths as great as feet in ideal conditions. Qualifications and training for forensic divers are additional to departmental physical and psychological requirements. Training may include instruction in stress management, media relations and teamwork.

Submerged evidence can have similar forensic value to evidence found above the water. Items recovered from immersion have been used as evidence in many cases where they have provided identifiable blood traces, fingerprints, hair and fibers, and other trace evidence. There are advantages to having a regional underwater investigation team available, but doing it well requires planning, administration, an adequate budget and due consideration of occupational health and safety issues. The working environment for underwater investigation includes a range of contaminated and inhospitable sites. Depending on the location and local procedural requirements, the teams may contain volunteers, firefighting and rescue personnel, or law enforcement personnel, and in some cases a collaboration of all of these. It is preferable that all members of an agency dive team be full-time, trained members of that agency for reasons of liability, training, policy and procedures. In some jurisdictions the required minimum certification is a recreational certification, in others an occupational qualification and registration may be stipulated. All members should be medically fit to dive, properly trained and competent to perform the tasks they may be assigned, and trained in matters of crime scene documentation and evidence handling and processing in an underwater environment.

=== Public safety diving ===
&quot;Public safety diving&quot; is a term coined by Steven J Linton in the 1970s to describe underwater rescue, underwater recovery and underwater investigation conducted by divers working for or under the authority of municipal, state or federal agencies. These divers are typically members of police departments, sheriff&#x27;s offices, fire rescue agencies, search and rescue teams or providers of emergency medical services. Public safety divers (PSDs) can be paid by the agencies employing them, or be non-paid volunteers.

===Conditions===

Due to the conditions in which accidents may happen, or where criminals may choose to dispose of evidence or their victims, police divers might need to dive under hostile environmental conditions which can include:
* In canals and rivers with strong flow
* In harbors and shipping lanes
* In intake pipes, sewers, culverts, and other enclosed spaces
* In bodies of water requiring high angle rope access
* In water towers with potable water
* Sludge, mud, debris or thick vegetation
* Under ice and in frigid water
* At night or with low visibility
* In rough seas and weather
* In water contaminated with toxins or parasites
As these dives may have to be done at short notice, department diving supervisors should be aware of the conditions and local hazards of the likely sites within their areas of operation, so that appropriate measures can be available when their team is called out.

== Qualifications and training ==
For professional police diving, the diver would in most cases be expected to be trained as a professional public safety diver, with specialized training in handling underwater forensic work. All the principles of land-based law enforcement work preserving and collecting evidence apply underwater.

More specialized training, depending on local requirements, may include airborne deployment of divers and gear, climbing and rappelling, cold water and ice diving, firearms training, night diving, operation of a recompression chamber, search management, surface-supplied air diving and diving voice communication systems, hazmat diving, and penetration diving.

===United States===
In the US, diving training agencies such as Emergency Response Diving International (ERDI), Special Response Diving International (SRDI), formally the National Academy of Police Diving, Team Lifeguard Systems, and Underwater Criminal Investigators have courses to train divers in public safety diving.
UCI (Underwater Criminal Investigators) was founded in 1987 to provide professional underwater criminal investigations training to the public safety diving community.

Special Response Diving International (SRDI) was formed in 1988 by a group of police divers to create a national standard for police and public safety diver training and certification in the US. It has helped provide public safety diver training for police officers, fire departments, military divers, and environmental investigators in the following locations: North America, Central America, Russia, Australia, and the Caribbean.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, public safety diving and police diving fall under the Diving Regulations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993, and such divers are required to be registered as commercial divers by the Department of Employment and Labor. Their basic diver training must be done through registered commercial diving schools. As they are professional police officers, they are also trained in police procedures.

===Australia===
The Australian Diver Accreditation Scheme (ADAS) includes accreditation for police diver training.

== Equipment ==

Some items of diving equipment have been designed or modified specifically for public safety diving, such as buoyancy compensator harnesses modified for helicopter lifts and swift water work, and for chemical resistance and HAZMAT conditions. Most equipment is standard scuba and surface supplied diving equipment suitable for the conditions in which it is to be used.

==History==
In Britain, in the early years of the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC), police often called on BSAC branches to dive to find submerged bodies, before the police started their own diving branches.

<text>Underwater divers may be employed in any branch of an armed force, including the navy, army, marines, air force and coast guard.
Scope of operations includes: search and recovery, search and rescue, hydrographic survey, explosive ordnance disposal, demolition, underwater engineering, salvage, ships husbandry, reconnaissance, infiltration, sabotage, counterifiltration, underwater combat and security.

==History of military diving==
Military divers are essential to many missions and campaigns. Combat and demolition work, underwater and coastal reconnaissance, ordnance disposal, search and rescue, salvage operations, construction, ship maintenance and underwater engineering. Every branch of the U.S. military employs divers, and more than 40 nations have military diving units. Military diving is an occupation that has risks and responsibilities beyond those of other professional diving. Research and development in military diving equipment and procedures often eventually contributes to recreational and technical diving practice.

Military diving development was influenced by the development of submarine technology in the early 20th century. There were several serious accidents following the widespread deployment of submarines, and the main application for military diving at that time was salvage and later rescue and recovery operations. Submarine escape equipment development helped with early scuba development.

Combat diving.

Fleet and engineering diving.

==Application of diving by branches of the military==

*Navy divers are used in ships husbandry, marine construction and salvage, demolition and mine clearance and special forces.
*Army divers may be used in engineering activities such as bridge construction and demolition, and by special forces units.
*Marine divers may be used for reconnaissance, preparation for amphibious operations, coastal demolition, disposal of explosives and special operations
*Air forces frequently use divers for search and rescue missions.
*In some countries the coastguard is considered to be a military force, and there are several applications for coastguard diving operations both operationally and for ships husbandry purposes.

==Armed forces with diving units==
==Scope of operations==

===Tactical diving===
===Clearance diving===

Clearance divers are specialists in underwater demolition, explosive ordnance disposal and improvised explosive device disposal. They are tasked with locating and destroying or recovering underwater ordnance at sea in ships, in the approaches to ports and anchorages, in port facilities and installations and in the coastal environment of amphibious operations.

===Ships husbandry===

Ships husbandry or ship husbandry is all aspects of maintenance, cleaning, and general upkeep of the hull, rigging, and equipment of a ship. It may also be used to refer to aspects of maintenance which are not specifically covered by the technical departments. The term is used in both naval and merchant shipping, but naval vessel husbandry may also be used for specific reference to naval vessels. Underwater ships husbandry includes hull cleaning, inspection, and some kinds of repair work.

===Marine salvage===
===Underwater engineering===
===Search and rescue===
===Search and recovery===

Underwater search and recovery is the process of locating and recovering underwater objects, often by divers. but also by the use of submersibles, remotely operated vehicles and electronic equipment on surface vessels.

Recovery techniques depend upon the type and size of the object. Smaller objects, can simply be carried up by the diver. Heavier objects represent a material change to the diver&#x27;s buoyancy control, and may put the diver at risk from an uncontrolled ascent if contact with the object is lost during ascent. Medium-sized objects are normally recovered using a lifting bag. Lift bags can be rated up to several tons, but these require an independent supply of inflation gas. Large objects usually require specialised commercial lifting equipment.
