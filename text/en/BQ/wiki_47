<doc id="496773" wikidata="Q383600" url="?curid=496773" title="Sudbury District">
<text>The Sudbury District is a district in Northeastern Ontario in the Canadian province of Ontario. It was created in 1894 from townships of eastern Algoma District and west Nipissing District. In 1973, the Regional Municipality of Sudbury was created as a separate jurisdiction out of the district.

The overwhelming majority of the district (about 92%) is unincorporated and part of Unorganized North Sudbury District. With the exception of Chapleau, all of the district&#x27;s incorporated municipalities are found in the area immediately surrounding the city of Greater Sudbury to the west, east and south. North of the Greater Sudbury area, the district is sparsely populated; between Sudbury and Chapleau, only unincorporated settlements, ghost towns and small First Nations reserves are found.

==Status of Greater Sudbury==
Because the districts of Northern Ontario are unincorporated territorial divisions, unlike the counties or regional municipalities of Southern Ontario, the city of Greater Sudbury is legally defined as part of the district in the geographic sense.

Politically, however, the district and the city are considered two distinct census divisions and two distinct jurisdictions for provincial government services. The district&#x27;s social services board—which has offices in the district seat of Espanola, as well as satellite offices in several other communities in the district—instead shares its jurisdictional area with the neighbouring Manitoulin District, whereas equivalent services in Greater Sudbury, which has the status of a single-tier municipality, are provided directly from the city.

With the city included, the district would have had a population of 183,077 in the 2016 census.

* Espanola
* French River
* Markstay-Warren
* St. Charles

==Demographics==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Sudbury District had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Provincial highways==

The Sudbury District is served by Trans-Canada Highways 17, which leads from the community of Walford (Sables-Spanish Rivers) in the west to the community of Warren (Markstay-Warren) in the east, and 69, which enters the district at French River and exits at the southern boundary of Greater Sudbury.

The Ontario government is converting Highway 69 to a freeway. Virtually the entire route of Highway 69 within the Sudbury District is now four-laned as of December 2021, with the completion of the segment between the French River and Grundy Lake Provincial Park, while the route narrows back to a two-lane highway in the Parry Sound District until widening back into Highway 400 at Carling. The freeway conversion of the remaining route, and its eventual renumbering as an extension of Highway 400, are expected in the future, although no exact date has been confirmed as of 2022 for the completion of the project.

Other primary provincial highways in the district are: 
* Highway 6, which extends from Highway 17 south to Whitefish Falls, where it enters the Manitoulin District,
* Highway 64, which runs from Highway 69 east and north through the Municipality of French River, and enters the Nipissing District at Mashkinonje Provincial Park,
* Highway 101, which extends from the boundary of Algoma District, west of Chapleau, to the boundary of Cochrane District, just outside Timmins,
* Highway 129, which runs from Highway 101 to the boundary of Algoma District south of Chapleau,
* Highway 144, which runs from the northwestern city limits of Greater Sudbury north to the boundary of Timiskaming District, just outside Timmins.

The Sudbury District also has a number of secondary provincial highways, which are the analogue in a district to county or municipal roads in Southern Ontario. They are important connections to the communities they serve, but are not significant routes for through traffic. The secondary highways are: 
* Highway 528, connecting the community of Wolseley Bay (French River) to Highway 64,
* Highway 528A, which provides access to the south side of the water body at Wolseley Bay,
* Highway 535, connecting Highway 64 at Noëlville (French River) to Highway 17 at Hagar (St. Charles),
* Highway 553, extending north from the community of Massey (Sables-Spanish Rivers),
* Highway 560, which runs from Highway 144 to the boundary of Timiskaming District, through Shining Tree,
* Highway 560A, which connects Westree to Highway 560,
* Highway 607, which runs from Bigwood (French River) to Highway 64,
* Highway 607A, which provides road access to the French River,
* Highway 637, which runs from Highway 69 to the community of Killarney,
* Highway 661, which connects the community of Gogama to Highway 144.

<text>Kevin Joseph &quot;Chuck&quot; Connors (April 10, 1921 – November 10, 1992) was an American actor and professional basketball and baseball player. He is one of only 13 athletes in the history of American professional sports to have played in both Major League Baseball (Brooklyn Dodgers 1949, Chicago Cubs, 1951) and the National Basketball Association (Boston Celtics 1946–48). With a 40-year film and television career, he is best known for his five-year role as Lucas McCain in the highly rated ABC series &quot;The Rifleman&quot; (1958–63).

== Early life and education ==
Connors was born on April 10, 1921 in Brooklyn, New York to Marcella (; 1894—1871) and Alban Francis &quot;Allan&quot; Connors (1891—1966) immigrants of Irish descent from Newfoundland and Labrador. He had one sibling, a younger sister named Gloria Marie Connors Cole (1923—2020).

His father became a citizen of the United States in 1914 and was working in Brooklyn in 1930 as a longshoreman and his mother had also attained her U.S. citizenship in 1917.

Connors was a devoted fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers despite their losing record during the 1930s, and he hoped to join the team one day. A talented athlete, he earned a scholarship to the Adelphi Academy, a preparatory school in Brooklyn, where he graduated in 1939. He received offers for athletic scholarships from more than two dozen colleges and universities. He attended Seton Hall University and played both basketball and baseball for the school.

Since childhood, Connors had disliked his first name, Kevin, and he had sought another name. He tried using &quot;Lefty&quot; and &quot;Stretch&quot; before finally settling on &quot;Chuck&quot;. The name derived from his time as a player on Seton Hall&#x27;s baseball team. He would repeatedly yell to the pitcher from his position on first base, &quot;Chuck it to me, baby! Chuck it to me!&quot; The rest of his teammates and spectators at the university&#x27;s games soon caught on, and the nickname stuck.

Connors left Seton Hall after two years to accept a contract to play professional baseball. He played on two minor league teams (see below) in 1940 and 1942, then joined the United States Army following America&#x27;s entrance into World War II. During most of the war, he served as a tank-warfare instructor at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and later at West Point in New York.

==Sports career==

=== Minor League Baseball (1940–1952) ===
In 1940, following his departure from college, Connors played four baseball games with the Brooklyn Dodgers&#x27; minor league team, the Newport Dodgers (Northeast Arkansas League). Released, he sat out the 1941 season, then signed with the New York Yankees farm team, the Norfolk Tars (Piedmont League), where he played 72 games before enlisting in the Army at Fort Knox, Kentucky, at the end of the season, on October 10, 1942.

Following his time in the Army, Connors played for the Newport News Dodgers (Piedmont League) in 1946, the Mobile Bears (Southern Association) in 1947, the Montreal Royals (International League) from 1948 through 1950, and the Los Angeles Angels (PCL) (Pacific Coast League) in 1951 and 1952.

===Professional basketball (1946–1948)===
Following his military discharge in 1946, the Connors joined the Rochester Royals (now the Sacramento Kings) of the National Basketball League for their 1945–1946 championship season. For the 1946–1947 season he joined the newly formed Boston Celtics of the Basketball Association of America. During his tenure with the Celtics in 1946, Connors became the first professional basketball player to break a backboard. He did so during pre-game practice before the Celtics&#x27; first home game of their inaugural season with a shot and not a slam dunk, which is what typically breaks a backboard in modern basketball. He played 53 games for Boston before leaving the team early in the 1947–48 season.

Connors is one of 13 athletes to have played in both the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball. The 12 others: Danny Ainge, Frank Baumholtz, Hank Biasatti, Gene Conley, Dave DeBusschere, Dick Groat, Steve Hamilton, Mark Hendrickson, Cotton Nash, Ron Reed, Dick Ricketts, and Howie Schultz.

Connors attended spring training in 1948 with Major League Baseball&#x27;s Brooklyn Dodgers but did not make the squad He played two seasons for the Dodgers&#x27; AAA team, the Montreal Royals before playing one game with the Dodgers in 1949. After two more seasons with Montreal, Connors joined the Chicago Cubs in 1951, playing in 66 games as a first baseman and occasional pinch hitter. In 1952, he was sent to the minor leagues again to play for the Cubs&#x27; top farm team, the Los Angeles Angels.

===Sports career notes===
In 1966, Connors played an off-field role by helping to end the celebrated holdout (see reserve clause) by Los Angeles Dodgers pitchers Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax when he acted as an intermediary during negotiations between management and the players. Connors can be seen in the Associated Press photo with Drysdale, Koufax and Dodgers general manager Buzzie Bavasi announcing the pitchers&#x27; new contracts.

Contrary to erroneous reports, Connors was not drafted by the Chicago Bears of the NFL.

=====Regular season=====
==Acting career==
Connors realized that he would not make a career in professional sports, so he decided to pursue an acting career. Playing baseball near Hollywood proved fortunate, as he was spotted by an MGM casting director and subsequently signed for the 1952 Tracy–Hepburn film &quot;Pat and Mike&quot;, performing the role of a police captain. In 1953, he starred opposite Burt Lancaster as a rebellious Marine private in &quot;South Sea Woman&quot; and then as an American football coach opposite John Wayne in &quot;Trouble Along the Way&quot;.

===Television roles===
Connors had a rare comedic role in a 1955 episode (&quot;Flight to the North&quot;) of &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;. He portrayed Sylvester J. Superman, a lanky rustic yokel who shared the same name as the title character of the series.

Connors was cast as Lou Brissie, a former professional baseball player wounded during World War II, in the 1956 episode &quot;The Comeback&quot; of the religion anthology series &quot;Crossroads&quot;. Don DeFore portrayed the Reverend C. E. &quot;Stoney&quot; Jackson, who offered the spiritual insight to assist Brissie&#x27;s recovery so that he could return to the game. Grant Withers was cast as Coach Whitey Martin; &quot;Crossroads&quot; regular Robert Carson also played a coach in this episode. Edd Byrnes, Rhys Williams, and Robert Fuller played former soldiers. X Brands is cast as a baseball player.

In 1957, Connors was cast in the Walt Disney film &quot;Old Yeller&quot; in the role of Burn Sanderson. That same year, he co-starred in &quot;The Hired Gun&quot;.

===Character actor===

Connors acted in feature films including &quot;The Big Country&quot; with Gregory Peck and Charlton Heston, &quot;Move Over Darling&quot; with Doris Day and James Garner, &quot;Soylent Green&quot; with Heston and Edward G. Robinson, and &quot;Airplane II: The Sequel&quot;.

He also became a beloved television character actor, guest-starring in dozens of shows. His guest-starring debut was on an episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Dear Phoebe&quot;. He played in two episodes, one as the bandit Sam Bass, on Dale Robertson&#x27;s NBC western &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot;.

Other television appearances were on &quot;Hey, Jeannie!&quot;, &quot;The Loretta Young Show&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Four Star Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Matinee Theatre&quot;, &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;The Gale Storm Show&quot;, &quot;The West Point Story&quot;, &quot;The Millionaire&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; hosted by Ronald Reagan, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;The Restless Gun&quot; with John Payne, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Date with the Angels&quot; with Betty White, &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;Night Gallery&quot; hosted by Rod Serling, and &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; with Lucille Ball.

===&quot;The Rifleman&quot;===
Connors beat 40 other actors for the lead in &quot;The Rifleman&quot;, portraying Lucas McCain, a widowed rancher known for his skill with a customized Winchester rifle. This ABC Western series, which aired from 1958 to 1963, was also the first show to feature a widowed father raising a young child. Connors said in a 1959 interview with &quot;TV Guide&quot; that the producers of Four Star Television (Dick Powell, Charles Boyer, Ida Lupino, and David Niven) must have been looking at 40 to 50 thirty-something men. At the time, the producers offered a certain amount of money to do 39 episodes for the 1958–59 season. The offer turned out to be less than Connors was making doing freelance acting, so he turned it down. A few days later, the producers of &quot;The Rifleman&quot; took their own children to watch &quot;Old Yeller&quot;, in which Connors played a strong father figure. After the producers watched him in the movie, they decided they should cast Connors in the role of Lucas McCain and made him a better offer, including a five-percent ownership of the show.

&quot;The Rifleman&quot; was an immediate hit, ranking No. 4 in the Nielsen ratings in 1958–59, behind three other Westerns – &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, and &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;. Johnny Crawford, an unfamiliar actor at the time, former Mousketeer, baseball fan and Western buff, beat 40 other young stars to play the role of Lucas&#x27;s son, Mark. Crawford remained on the series from 1958 until its cancellation in 1963. &quot;The Rifleman&quot; landed high in the Nielsen ratings until the last season in 1962–63, when it was opposite the highly rated return to television of Lucille Ball on &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; and ratings began to drop. The show was cancelled in 1963 after five seasons and 168 episodes.

====The rifle====

Three rifles were made for the show: two identical .44–40 Winchester model 1892 rifles, one that was used on the show and one for backup, and a Spanish version called an &quot;El Tigre&quot; used in the saddle holster. The rifle levers were modified from the round type to more D-shaped in later episodes.

Two rifles were specifically made for Chuck Connors by Maurice &quot;Moe&quot; Hunt and were never used on the show. He was a fan of the show and gave them to Connors. Arnold Palmer, a friend and honorary chairman of the annual Chuck Connors charity golf event, was given one of the personal rifles by Connors and it was on display at The World Golf Hall of Fame.

=== Typecasting and other TV roles ===

In 1963, Connors appeared in the film &quot;Flipper&quot;. He also appeared opposite James Garner and Doris Day in the comedy &quot;Move Over, Darling&quot; in the role earlier played by Randolph Scott in the original 1940 Irene Dunne/Cary Grant version entitled &quot;My Favorite Wife&quot;.

As Connors was strongly typecast for playing the single-father rancher, he then starred in several short-lived series, including: ABC&#x27;s &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot; (1963–1964), an early forerunner of &quot;Law and Order&quot; featuring two young actors Ben Gazzara and Don Galloway; and NBC&#x27;s post-Civil War-era series &quot;Branded&quot; (1965–1966).

In 1967–1968, Connors starred in the ABC series &quot;Cowboy in Africa&quot; alongside Tom Nardini and British actor Ronald Howard.

Connors guest-starred in a last-season episode of &quot;Night Gallery&quot; titled &quot;The Ring With the Red Velvet Ropes&quot;. In 1973 and 1974, he hosted a television series called &quot;Thrill Seekers&quot;.

Connors was nominated for an Emmy Award for his performance in a key role against type: a slave owner in the 1977 miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;.

Connors hosted a number of episodes of &quot;Family Theater&quot; on the Mutual Radio Network. This series was aimed at promoting prayer as a path to world peace and stronger families, with the motto, &quot;The family which prays together stays together.&quot;

In 1980, he hosted &quot;Chuck Connors&#x27; Great Western Theatre&quot;, a combination of off-network episodes of &quot;Branded&quot; and &quot;The Guns of Will Sonnett&quot;, managed by Leo A. Gutman, Inc.

In 1983, Connors joined Sam Elliott, Cybill Shepherd, Ken Curtis, and Noah Beery Jr. in the short-lived NBC series &quot;The Yellow Rose&quot;, about a modern Texas ranching family.

In 1985, he first guest-starred in the pilot episode which would become a recurring role of &quot;King Powers&quot; in the ABC TV series &quot;&quot;, starring Robert Urich as “Spenser” — “with an S, like the poet” — and Avery Brooks as “Hawk.”

In 1987, he co-starred in the Fox series &quot;Werewolf&quot;, as drifter Janos Skorzeny.

In 1988, he guest-starred as &quot;Gideon&quot; in the TV series &quot;Paradise&quot;, starring Lee Horsley. He also starred as Nash Crawford in the film &quot;Once Upon a Texas Train&quot; in which he played an aged, retired Texas Ranger.

In 1991, Connors was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City.

== Personal life ==

Connors was married three times. He met his first wife, Elizabeth Jane Riddell Connors, at one of his baseball games and they were married on October 1, 1948. They had four sons.

Connors married Kamala Devi (1963) the year after co-starring with her in &quot;Geronimo&quot;. She also acted with Connors in &quot;Branded&quot;, &quot;Broken Sabre&quot;, and &quot;Cowboy in Africa&quot;. They were divorced in 1973.

Connors met his third wife, Faith Quabius, when they both appeared in the film &quot;Soylent Green&quot; (1973). They were married in 1977 and divorced in 1979.

Connors was a supporter of the Republican Party and attended several fundraisers for campaigns for U.S. President Richard M. Nixon. Connors also backed Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election, and Gerald Ford in the 1976 presidential election. He campaigned for Ronald Reagan, a personal friend, and marched in support of the Vietnam War in 1967.

Leonid Brezhnev, the leader of the Soviet Union, met Connors when Brezhnev arrived on Air Force One at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station with President Richard Nixon in June 1973. Brezhnev noticed Connors in the group on the tarmac waiting to receive him and the President. Brezhnev shook Connors&#x27; hand and then wrapped his arms around him, and leapt into Connors&#x27; arms to be lifted up by the hulking American actor. The crowd laughed and clapped at the spectacle. Later, at a party given by Nixon at the Western White House in San Clemente, California, Connors presented Brezhnev with a pair of Colt Single Action Army &quot;Six-Shooters&quot; (revolvers) which Brezhnev liked greatly.

Few American television programs were permitted to be broadcast in the Soviet Union at that time: &quot;The Rifleman&quot; was an exception, because it happened to be Brezhnev&#x27;s favorite show. Connors and Brezhnev got along so well that Connors accepted an invitation to visit the Soviet leader in Moscow in December 1973. After Brezhnev&#x27;s death in 1982, Connors expressed an interest in returning to the Soviet Union for the General Secretary&#x27;s funeral, but the U.S. government would not allow Connors to be part of the official delegation.

Connors was left handed.

On July 18, 1984, Connors was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (star location at 6838 Hollywood Blvd). Over 200 close friends attended, including his family, and actor Johnny Crawford.

=== Charity ===

Connors hosted the annual Chuck Connors Charitable Invitational Golf Tournament, through the Chuck Connors Charitable Foundation, at the Canyon Country Club in Palm Springs, California. Proceeds went directly to the Angel View Crippled Children&#x27;s Foundation and over $400,000 was raised.

==Death==
Connors died on November 10, 1992, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles at the age of 71 of lung cancer. He is buried in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery.

<text>Richard Bennett Hatfield (April 9, 1931 – April 26, 1991) was a New Brunswick politician and the longest serving premier of New Brunswick from 1970 to 1987.

== Early life ==
The youngest of five children of Heber Hatfield and Dora Robinson, Richard was brought up with politics in the household. His father, already a well known potato shipper, was Hartland&#x27;s mayor when he was born. In 1938, at 7 years old, his father brought him to the Conservative Party of Canada leadership convention in Winnipeg where he met his namesake, R. B. Bennett. In 1940 Heber was elected Victoria-Carleton county Conservative Member of Parliament and served until his death due to cancer in 1952. Young Richard spent a lot of time in Ottawa even getting to know John Diefenbaker and his first wife Edna.

After graduating from high school in 1948 in his home town Hartland, Hatfield attended Acadia University for four years majoring in chemistry and English where he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He also got involved in drama, an experience that seemed to have the most lasting impact of any during his years at Acadia. &quot;That was extremely valuable&quot; he said. &quot;It would benefit every politician to have a bit of theatre training... too many politicians get caught up using big words to impress, but don&#x27;t know how to project feelings.&quot; After Acadia, he attended Dalhousie University to become a doctor but after a year he turned to law. He graduated Dalhousie Law School in 1956.

== Early career ==

Hatfield left Halifax in 1957 and moved to Truro to take a job with the firm Patterson, Smith, Matthew and Grant so he could do his six months articling period. After successfully completing his articles, he left Truro to join Gordon Churchill who was at the time Minister of Industry in Ottawa. He declined a job offer at the firm and he never practised law again. He stayed in Ottawa for nine months until he called his brother Fred for a job back home. Frederick Heber Hatfield (1922-2004), who was managing the potato shipping and processing operation since Heber died, agreed and Richard became vice-president of sales. He worked with his brother until 1965. When his family sold their potato chip plant to Humpty Dumpty Snack Foods, he decided to be a politician full-time.

== Political career ==
In 1961, Hugh John Flemming left his Carleton County seat and ran successfully in the federal seat of Royal. Fred, then president of Carleton County PC Association, offered the nomination to Richard, who accepted. He ran against his brother-in-law Gerald Clark, and won easily with a majority of 1,736 votes. Years later, he recalled that his father&#x27;s reputation &quot;had helped me to be elected, and now I was on my own.&quot;

When the New Brunswick Legislature was not sitting, Hatfield sold potato chips all over the Maritimes. His first few years as an MLA were uneventful, but he spent a lot of time talking to reporters about politics in Fredericton and Montreal.

He became Leader of the Opposition and interim leader of the Progressive Conservatives after the 1967 general election and was elected party leader in 1969. He led the party to victory in the 1970 provincial election. During Hatfield&#x27;s long tenure, he became prominent on the national stage by allying with Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau during the constitutional negotiations that led to the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution and the creation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. He also took leadership in helping create equality between the province&#x27;s Francophone Acadian minority and Anglophone majority.

His attempts at attracting investment to the province and developing the economy were less successful. In the 1970s, the Hatfield government financed the manufacture of the Bricklin SV-1 in hope of creating an auto industry in the province. Although the visionary project produced an advanced sports car, huge cost overruns and poor management led to the company&#x27;s demise.

===Controversies and resignation===
Hatfield&#x27;s last years in office were plagued by personal scandal. On September 25, 1984, the RCMP found 35 grams of marijuana in his suitcase during a security check of luggage conducted before a flight from Fredericton to Moncton during a royal visit by Queen Elizabeth II. He was charged with criminal possession of marijuana on October 26. The trial was postponed when Judge James D. Harper appeared on a radio show and suggested that privileged people should receive stiffer sentences than &quot;Joe Blow from Kokomo who is the town drunk.&quot; On January 29, 1985, Hatfield was acquitted by Judge Andrew Harrigan after a two-day trial. Harrigan sparked legal furor after he suggested that a journalist might have planted the drugs to create &quot;the juiciest story ever to crack the media.&quot;

Several days after the acquittal, allegations emerged that Hatfield had invited four young men to an all-night party in his Fredericton home in 1981. The men accused Hatfield of giving them marijuana and of using cocaine during the evening. They also alleged that Hatfield flew them to Montreal aboard a government aircraft and put them up in a downtown hotel for the night. Hatfield denied the allegations and stated, &quot;It is true that they were in my home together with others, some four years ago. However, they were strangers to me. Those who know me will confirm I am extremely gregarious. I meet and talk to people on the street, in the markets and the shops, in the restaurants and bars. I invite them to my house, I go to their houses. The door to my house is usually unlocked and frequently open. That is my way. I admit I am unconventional.&quot; No legal action was taken.

In the 1987 election, Hatfield&#x27;s PC Party lost every seat in the legislature, a wipeout that had not been not seen in Canada in over half a century. Hatfield was soundly defeated in his own riding by the Liberal, Allison DeLong, and lost by 18 points. Hatfield resigned as Premier of New Brunswick and as party leader.

== Later years and death ==
In 1990, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada by Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn, on the advice of Brian Mulroney. Soon after taking up his appointment, he was stricken with an inoperable brain tumour and died in 1991, at the age of 60. His memorial service, which was held at the Christ Church Cathedral in Fredericton, New Brunswick, was attended by Premiers and Prime Ministers, friends and opponents.

== Personal life ==
It was a widely known open secret that Hatfield was gay; in the 1978 provincial election, New Brunswick Liberal Party leader Joseph Daigle attracted criticism for a campaign speech in which he referred to Hatfield as a &quot;faded pansy&quot;. Janet Cawley of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called him, &quot;a flamboyant, eccentric and controversial figure with a penchant for modern art, rock and roll, and New York night life&quot;. His critics nicknamed him &quot;Disco Dick&quot;. Despite this, he never officially came out as such during his lifetime, and his sexual orientation only began to be discussed on the record in media and biographical sources after his death. Hatfield said of his bachelor lifestyle, &quot;the nuclear family—one wife, two kids and one dog—looks nice on Christmas cards, but they pay an awful price&quot;.

<text>Pre-production is the process of planning some of the elements involved in a film, television show, play, or other performance, as distinct from production and post-production. Pre-production ends when the planning ends and the content starts being produced.

== In content film ==
Pre-production formally begins once a project has been greenlit. It involves finalizing the script, hiring the actors and crew, finding locations, determining what equipment is needed, and figuring out the budget. At this stage, finalizing preparations for production go into effect. Financing will generally be confirmed and many of the key elements such as principal cast members, director, and cinematographer are set. By the end of pre-production, the screenplay is usually finalized and satisfactory to all the financiers and other stakeholders.

During pre-production, the script is broken down into individual scenes with storyboards and all the locations, props, cast members, costumes, special effects, and visual effects are identified. An extremely detailed shooting schedule is produced and arrangements are made for the necessary elements to be available to the film-makers at the appropriate times. Sets are constructed, the crew is hired, financial arrangements are put in place and a start date for the beginning of principal photography is set. At some point in pre-production, there will be a read-through of the script which is usually attended by all cast members with speaking parts, the director, all heads of departments, financiers, producers, and publicists.

== In music ==

In the music industry, pre-production is a process whereby a recording artist spends time creating and refining their musical ideas. The artist thus produces a song&#x27;s demo recording, or rough draft, in order to establish the song&#x27;s creative premise. This reduces the time and money spent in expensive studios. The goal is to enter into the major recording phase of production with the basic and most promising ideas having been already established.

Notable producers who preferred this process have included Bruce Fairbairn and Bob Rock. They have both produced successful albums such as Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot;, Mötley Crüe&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;, Metallica&#x27;s &quot;The Black Album&quot;, and Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot;.

<text>Deoksugung (), also called Deoksu Palace or Deoksugung Palace, is a former royal palace in Seoul, South Korea. It was the first main palace of the 1897–1910 Korean Empire. It is now a major tourist attraction. It has a mix of traditional Korean and Western architecture that reflects its history. Inside the palace are the Daehan Empire History Museum and National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Deoksugung branch.

The palace was first used as a temporary palace by King Seonjo during the 1592–1598 Imjin War, when the other palaces had been destroyed. In 1611, it was made an official palace named Gyeongungung. The palace then went largely unused until the late 19th century. In 1897, Gojong declared the creation of the Korean Empire and made Gyeongungung the empire&#x27;s main palace. He attempted to make the palace a symbol of Korea&#x27;s efforts to modernize. He rapidly expanded it by acquiring land from nearby properties and constructing new buildings in both Korean and Western styles. Under his tenure, the palace&#x27;s major buildings Junghwajeon and Seokjojeon were constructed. Despite his efforts to keep Korea independent, he was forced to abdicate in 1907 and Korea was colonized by Japan in 1910. He lived in the palace until his death in 1919. After Gojong&#x27;s death, the colonial government moved quickly to sell off and dismantle the palace&#x27;s property. By 1930, 18 of the original buildings were left. In 1933, the palace was made a public park. In 1938, a West Wing was constructed for Seokjojeon, and together the two buildings became the . After these efforts to open the palace to the public, just 8 of the original buildings remained.

Even for decades after the 1945 liberation of Korea, the palace continued to function as a public park, with some public works projects further altering or decreasing the size of the palace. One scholar estimated the palace&#x27;s current size to be 1/3rd of its peak size. Efforts to restore its pre-colonial appearance began in the 1980s. In 2004, a comprehensive plan to restore aspects of the palace was enacted. As part of this plan, a number of buildings and structures have been recreated or moved back to their original pre-colonial spots based on historical research.

== History ==
The site the palace now occupies once contained the tomb of Queen Sindeok, second wife of the Joseon founding king Taejo (r. 1392–1398). During the reign of Taejong (r. 1400–1418), the tomb was moved elsewhere. Grand Prince Wolsan, the elder brother of King Seongjong, constructed his residence in the area. In the early stages of the 1592–1598 Imjin War, King Seonjo fled Seoul. In his absence, the palaces in the city were destroyed by fire. Upon his return to Seoul in 1593, he stayed in the area, which was dubbed the Jeongneung-dong Haenggung (). He would eventually die there.

King Gwanghaegun then ascended the throne at the palace. In 1611, Changdeokgung was adequately repaired, and Gwanghaegun moved over to that palace. He then upgraded Haenggung to a full palace and selected a new name for it: Gyeongungung (). He ordered that Gyeongungung&#x27;s facilities be maintained so that it could be used as a secondary palace. Several months later, he moved back to Gyeongungung. While repairing other palaces, he ordered that several of Gyeongungung&#x27;s structures be disassembled and their materials used in other palaces. In 1618, Seonjo&#x27;s former wife Queen Inmok was forcefully confined in the palace. In 1623, King Injo ordered that all buildings except for two in Gyeongungung be returned to their original owners.

For much of the later Joseon period, Gyeongungung was considered to have lesser facilities, and thus went largely unused by the Korean royal family. It was renovated in 1679 and visited four times by King Yeongjo between 1748 and 1775. An article in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Korean Culture&quot; argues it was otherwise disregarded to the extent of not appearing on a number of late Joseon maps. After the 1884 failed Gapsin Coup, various foreign missions were granted permission to be established around Gyeongungung. To its west was the and . To its north is the Embassy of the United Kingdom. In 1893, the Korean monarch Gojong held a ceremony at Gyeongungung for the 300th anniversary of Seonjo returning to Seoul. Historian An Chang-mo () argues that the palace held symbolism to Gojong as a place where the monarch stayed during a foreign invasion crisis.

=== Korean Empire period ===

After the 1895 assassination of the Korean Queen Min, the Korean monarch Gojong fled for safety in the Russian legation in early 1896. Rather than return to Gyeongbokgung, where Min had been assassinated, Gojong chose to make Gyeongungung his residence for its proximity to the legations, which he believed could help protect him from Japan. At the time, the palace only had a small number of buildings. Around a week after his arrival in the legation, he began ordering the renovation and expansion of Gyeongungung. The first round of renovations were completed on September 28, 1896. They then held a state funeral for Min, whom was posthumously dubbed Empress Myeongseong, wherein her remains were transferred from Gyeongbokgung to Gyeongungung. On February 20, 1897, Gojong left the Russian legation and moved into Gyeongungung. That year, he ordered road infrastructure around the palace be significantly reconstructed. After crowning himself emperor at a ceremony at the nearby Hwangudan, on October 13, 1897, he officially proclaimed the Korean Empire.

Gojong attempted to make the palace into a symbol of Korea&#x27;s modernization efforts. The palace grounds were expanded in three directions: north, west, and south. To the east was a major road and dense city. The palace, unlike the previous main palaces in Seoul, was built and grew under the restrictions of being within a well-established city. Land was purchased from various groups, but this was not always possible or easily done, especially when foreign land owners and consulates were involved. Nearby buildings had height restrictions issued, in order to prevent them from looking over into the palace.

On April 14, 1904, a major fire started in Hamnyeongjeon. While Hamnyeongjeon was Gojong&#x27;s sleeping quarters, at the time he was at Gwanmyeongjeon while Hamnyeongjeon was undergoing repairs. The fire destroyed most of the buildings, including Jungmyeongjeon, Seogeodang, and Jeokjodang, which had dated to the time of Seonjo. A number of buildings on the north, northeast, and east side of the palace were spared from the fire. Numerous valuables were destroyed, with only some rescued. Most of Gojong&#x27;s ministers and the Japanese minister advised Gojong to return to Gyeongbokgung, but Gojong refused. Restoration work began the following day. Repair costs were enormous and exceeded the total annual budget of the Korean Empire. By 1905, the buildings Jeukjodang, Seogeodang, Gyeonghyojeon, Jungmyeongjeon, Heummungak, and Hamnyeongjeon were rebuilt. A number of these were built smaller than their original form. The gates Junghwamun and Jowunmun were also completed in that year. In 1906, the main building Junghwajeon and main gate Daeanmun were both completed.In 1907, Gojong was made to abdicate in favor of his son, Sunjong. In August 1907, Sunjong&#x27;s coronation ceremony was a relatively simple affair held at Dondeokjeon. Afterwards, Sunjong used Changdeokgung as his primary palace, possibly at the behest of the Japanese, who wished to isolate him from Gojong. That year, Gyeongungung was renamed Deoksugung. Gojong continued to live there in the building Hamnyeongjeon. In 1910, the building Seokjojeon was completed.

=== Colonial period ===

In May 1912, the adjacent road Taepyeongno was made to cut straight through the eastern side of the palace. The gate Podeokmun, its adjacent buildings, and the large plaza in front of Daehanmun were demolished. The palace&#x27;s eastern wall was pushed inwards. Numerous former guest houses for the palace became separate from the palace; these extended into what is today Seoul Plaza.

The death of Gojong in 1919 was a significant turning point for the palace. The palace was managed by the Office of the Yi Dynasty, although the royal family ceased using the palace significantly. The Government-General of Chōsen began downsizing, dismantling, and selling off portions of the palace. The Seonwonjeon area, in the northwest of the palace, was the first to be dismantled and sold off; two schools were built in its place by 1923. By 1930, there were 18 of the original palace buildings left.

In May 1931, the Office of the Yi Dynasty announced that of Deoksugung would be turned into a public park called &quot;Central Park&quot; (). After around a year of construction work, it was opened to the public on October 1, 1933. Ten buildings were removed from the palace. The remaining former guest houses that were separated from the palace during Taepyeongno&#x27;s expansion were demolished in 1933. Plans were created for a swimming pool in place of Dondeokjeon, which could be used as a skating rink during the winter. The plan was deemed too offensive to the legacy of the palace, and was scrapped. Alterations to the palace during this process were among the most significant in the palace&#x27;s history. A water feature was moved from another palace Changdeokgung to the garden in front of Seokjojeon. The gardens of the palace were significantly renovated; only a few trees and decorative elements have persisted until the present. Numerous peonies were planted in the park. These became a popular attraction during the colonial period and even after the liberation. They were replaced in 1985 with pine trees and azaleas after it was determined they were a product of the colonial period.

In 1933, Seokjojeon was converted into the Seokjojeon Art Museum. From 1936 to 1938, a three-story West Wing building for Seokjojeon was constructed. Together, these buildings became the .

After the above projects, just eight of the original buildings were left.

=== Post-liberation ===
Soon after the 1945 liberation of Korea, the Yi Royal Family Art Museum renamed itself to the Deoksugung Art Museum. In March 1946, the United States Army Military Government in Korea seized Seokjojeon and designated it as the offices of the . They held a major meeting there on the issue of Korean reunification on March 20, 1946. The returning Korean Provisional Government used the building for a number of its meetings. The joint commission was dissolved in October 1947.

During the 1950–1953 Korean War, the palace was largely spared from war damage, although Seokjojeon&#x27;s interior was destroyed by fire. During the Second Battle of Seoul, North Korean soldiers amassed in the palace. U.S. lieutenant James Hamilton Dill persuaded his superiors to not shell the palace because of the palace&#x27;s cultural heritage. In 1996, after this story came to the attention of the South Korean government, he was awarded a plaque of gratitude.

In 1961, a project to expand the nearby road Taepyeongno affected the palace. The palace walls were torn down and replaced with a see-through fence. In 1968, the walls were further pushed back during another road expansion program. Daehanmun was initially not pushed back along with the wall, and stuck out into the road. From August 1970 to January 1971, the gate was moved west into the wall, to its current location.

Beginning in the 1980s, efforts began to be made to restore the palace to its pre-colonial state. In 2004, a plan for this, entitled the Deoksugung Restoration and Maintenance Basic Plan (), was drafted. As part of these efforts, Jungmyeongjeon was restored in 2009, Seokjojeon was restored in 2014, and Gwangmyeongmun was moved back to its original location in 2018.

An Chang-mo argues that the current Deoksugung is around a third the size of its peak size.

== Current landmarks ==

=== East section ===

==== Daehanmun ====

 () is the current main gate of the palace and located on the east side of the complex. It was originally called Daeanmun (). It was completed in 1898. The original main gate was Inhwamun, but that gate declined in use and status compared to Daeanmun. In 1900, Daeanmun was made the official main gate. The gate was destroyed in the 1904 fire and rebuilt in 1906. On April 25, 1906 it was renamed to Daehanmun and made the main gate. Its new nameboard was written by . The gate was moved inwards towards the palace in 1914 during a road expansion project. It was moved again in 1970 to its final location. It is decorated with &quot;dancheong&quot; decorative coloring and statues of various beasts.

==== Gwangmyeongmun ====

Gwangmyeongmun () is the main gate to the south of the king&#x27;s sleeping quarters Hamnyeongjeon. It was completed in 1897 and destroyed by the 1904 fire. It was reconstructed later that same year. It was moved in 1938, upon the expansion of Seokjojeon and the establishment of the . It was used as an exhibition hall for national treasures such as the water clock Borugak Jagyeongnu and . It was moved back to its original location at the end of 2018 in anticipation of the 100th anniversary of the 1919 March First Movement.

==== Hamnyeongjeon ====

 () is a building that was used as Gojong&#x27;s sleeping quarters. The building was originally completed in 1897 but was destroyed in the 1904 fire. It was the &quot;ondol&quot; system of this building that caused the 1904 great fire. It was rebuilt by December that year, with the new building in an L-shape instead of the original rectangular form. Gojong died in this building on January 22, 1919. The building was used as Gojong&#x27;s funeral home and his spirit tablet was kept here. The building&#x27;s layout and style is typical with other Korean palaces. There are windows on all sides of the building. It has an &quot;ondol&quot; traditional floor heating system.

==== Deokhongjeon ====

Deokhongjeon () is a hall next to and just west of Hamnyeongjeon. A different building on this spot was originally called Gyeongsojeon (). After Empress Myeongseong&#x27;s death, the hall was renamed Gyeonghyojeon () and began to be used as her &quot;honjŏn&quot; (), or ancestral spirit hall. The building was destroyed in the 1904 fire. The empress&#x27;s spirit tablet was moved elsewhere thereafter and did not return even after another building was rebuilt on this spot in 1912. That building was called Deokhongjeon, and used as an audience hall for Gojong.

==== Jeonggwanheon ====

 () is an American-style brick building with a wooden porch. It has Romanesque columns on the veranda and Korean-style elements in its roof. It was built before February 1901 and was unaffected by the 1904 fire. The building was used for a variety of purposes that possibly changed over time, including enshrining the portrait of King Taejo, a space for drawing royal portraits, and serving food during banquets. The building was modified over time, but specific records of how and when it was modified on some occasions have been lost. In the 1930s, its floor was changed from wood to concrete, its interior walls were removed to make it a single room, and its roof was changed to a Japanese-style architecture. In the 1960s, glass doors were installed in it and it was used as a cafe.

==== Junghwamun ====

Junghwamun () is a gate to the front of Junghwajeon. It is built in a similar style to Junghwajeon. Like its counterpart, it was destroyed in the 1904 fire and rebuilt at smaller scale. It has three large sets of doors and is built on a stone pedestal. In front of it is a staircase divided into three sections, with stone beast statues in between east section.

==== Junghwajeon ====

Junghwajeon () is the main building of the palace. It was originally a two-story building completed in 1902. Construction on the building began relatively late compared to other structures in the palace. Gojong completed other portions of the palace first and purchased more land south of the palace before ordering its construction in 1901. It was destroyed in the 1904 fire, and rebuilt as a one-story building that has remained to the present. The exterior is decorated with &quot;dancheong&quot; decorative coloring. The ceiling has two dragon statues that symbolize the emperor. It is visible from around the sides of its front gate Junghwamun; this was not its original appearance. A ring of buildings used to surround its front courtyard. These were demolished during the colonial period.

==== Seogeodang ====

Seogeodang () is a building that dated to Seonjo&#x27;s time (before it was destroyed in the 1904 fire and rebuilt that same year). Queen Inmok was confined in this building in the 17th century. It is one of the few surviving two-story buildings in the palace. The stairs to the second floor are located in the west-most room. The upper floor is a single room. The lower floor has a signboard with calligraphy by Gojong.

==== Junmyeongdang and Jeukjodang ====

Junmyeongdang () is a building that was used to receive foreign envoys. It was originally completed in 1897 but destroyed in the 1904 fire. It was then rebuilt. In 1916, the building was used as a kindergarten for the last Korean princess Deokhye. The building is now in an L shape. It is equipped with an &quot;ondol&quot; underfloor heating system.

Jeukjodang () is a building that is adjacent to and connected with Junmyeongdang. It dated to Seonjo&#x27;s time, before it was destroyed in the 1904 fire and rebuilt at smaller scale. When Gojong first moved into Deoksugung, he used Jeukjodang as the main hall. He dubbed it Taegeukjeon () and then Junghwajeon (same name as the later main building). After the construction of the larger main building, that building went by Junghwajeon and this building returned to using the name Jeukjodang.

=== West section ===

==== Seokjojeon and West Wing ====

Seokjojeon () is a neoclassical palace building that was completed in 1910. It was designed and furnished by British people. Just months after its completion, Korea was formally annexed by Japan. It continued to be used by the Korean royal family until Gojong&#x27;s death in 1919. Afterwards it was used by Japanese dignitaries for a variety of purposes and its interior was altered. It was used as an art museum beginning in 1933. In 1938, a West Wing building was constructed for it. Together, these two buildings were used for the .

After the 1945 liberation of Korea, the buildings were largely used as museums. In 1998, the West Wing became part of the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Deoksugung branch. Beginning in the late 2000s, the main building began to be converted into a history museum. Efforts were made to restore the pre-colonial interior as accurately as possible. The Daehan Empire History Museum opened in 2014.

The garden in front of both these buildings was first completed in March 1913.

==== Dondeokjeon ====

Dondeokjeon () was a French-style building constructed between 1902 and 1903. A customs office used to occupy its spot. It was used as a guest house and audience hall for dignitaries. It did not burn down during the 1904 fire. Gojong used this hall frequently to receive guests and Sunjong ascended to the throne here. It was demolished sometime between 1921 and 1926. A children&#x27;s amusement park was built in its place. Efforts began to reconstruct the building in the late 2010s. As the interior was poorly documented, rather than attempt to recreate the interior decorations (as they did with Seokjojeon), they made it into a museum. It was opened to the public on September 26, 2023.

=== Outside current palace proper ===

==== Jungmyeongjeon ====

 () is the first Western-style building in the palace; it was completed before 1897 under the name Suokheon () and was originally a single-story building that possibly previously belonged to foreigners. It was originally an imperial library. The building was destroyed in a November 16, 1901 fire and rebuilt; the rebuilt form has two stories. After the 1904 fire, it was temporarily used as Gojong&#x27;s office. Around this time, he changed the name of the building to Jungmyeonjeon. In 1905, the infamous Eulsa Treaty was signed here. In 1906, the wedding between Emperor Sunjong and Empress Sunjeonghyo took place at this building. The building was once directly part of the palace complex but eventually became separate amidst a reduction in the palace&#x27;s size during the colonial period. Afterwards, it was leased out to and used by a number of different entities. In 1925, a fire severely damaged its interior. It was eventually purchased by the Cultural Heritage Administration. In February 2007, it began to managed as a part of Deoksugung.

==== Yangijae ====

Next to what is now the Embassy of the United Kingdom used to be two buildings that were part of the palace complex. The building () still exists, although Hamhuidang () was demolished. They were originally completed in February 1905 and meant to be used for educating the families of the elite. They ceased to be used for this purpose in October 1910, after the Japanese annexation. In 1912, the Government-General of Chōsen asked that the royal family lease these buildings to the Seoul Anglican Cathedral. The buildings were purchased by the church outright in 1920. Both buildings were moved in 1927, with Yangijae moving to its current spot, and Hamhuidang was demolished in 1960.

== Former landmarks ==
Seonwonjeon () was an ancestral worship hall that was located in what is now outside and north of the palace. It was first completed in 1900 in the east side of the palace but was destroyed by fire on October 14 of that year. It was then rebuilt to the northwest side, and was completed on July 11, 1901. After Gojong&#x27;s death in 1919, the building and its land was sold off to the public. The building was demolished by 1925 and its ancestor worship materials were moved to Changdeokgung. Afterwards, a variety of buildings and clients occupied its former site. Eventually, the residence of the chief of the Chōsen Savings Bank came to occupy the spot. That building continued to exist by 2024. Between 2002 and 2005, the United States Embassy planned to build a 15-story office building and 8-story apartment on the land, but this plan was thwarted by citizen protestors that thought the buildings potential eyesores and wanted to preserve the history of the plot. In 2024, it was opened as a public park.

The headquarters for the Board of Marshals was located in two buildings to the right of Inhwamun (the original main gate in the south). They had entrances both in and out of the palace. At least one of them was made of brick and was two stories tall. Photos of the buildings are sparse, so little is known of their appearance otherwise.

There were three brick three-story watchtowers along the palace walls that looked to be built in Western style.

There were two overpass bridges () at the palace. One connected the palace to the former German legation (some portion of that legation&#x27;s land was purchased by the Korean government) and another led to another palace Gyeonghuigung. The bridge to the legation had a single arch; traces of its structure still remain on the walls of Deoksugung and on a Seoul City Hall annex building.

Inhwamun () was the original main gate of the palace and was located to its south. However, it led to a narrow and poor quality road. It declined in use and status compared to Daeanmun. In 1900, Daeanmun was made the official main gate. Inhwamun was demolished and its materials recycled some time around 1900 to 1902. It was possibly located around the current location of Junghwamun.

Jowonmun () was a gate constructed to complete the traditional three-gate system (where visitors must pass through three gates to arrive at the main hall) employed in other palaces. These gates for Deoksugung were, in order, Daeanmun, Jowonmun, and Junghwamun. It was built concurrently with Junghwajeon. It was destroyed in the 1904 fire and rebuilt in a different location, more to the east. It was likely demolished in 1913, during the construction of an Office of the Yi Dynasty building. In 2019, it was reported that there were active plans to reconstruct the gate in the 2020s.

Guseongheon () was a two-story Western-style building north of Seokjojeon, to the northwest of Junmyeongdang. Little is known about when and how it was built and when it was demolished. Its use is attested to in 1899 and 1907 records. It had verandas with arches over them. Its entrance possibly faced to the north, as there was a gabled roof on that side.

<doc id="496799" wikidata="Q1340579" url="?curid=496799" title="Nuwara Eliya">
<text>Nuwara Eliya ( ; ) is a city in the hill country of the Central Province, Sri Lanka. Its name means &quot;city on the plain (table land)&quot; or &quot;city of light&quot;. The city is the administrative capital of Nuwara Eliya District, with a picturesque landscape and temperate climate. It is at an altitude of 1,868 m (6,128 ft) and is considered to be the most important location for tea production in Sri Lanka. The city is overlooked by Pidurutalagala, the tallest mountain in Sri Lanka. Nuwara Eliya is known for its temperate, cool climatethe coolest area in Sri Lanka.

== History ==
The city was founded by Samuel Baker, the explorer of Lake Albert and the upper Nile in 1846. Nuwara Eliya&#x27;s climate lent itself to becoming the prime sanctuary of the British civil servants and planters in Ceylon. Nuwara Eliya, called Little England, was a hill country retreat where the British colonialists could immerse themselves in their pastimes such as fox hunting, deer hunting, elephant hunting, polo, golf and cricket.

Many of the buildings retain features from the colonial period such as the Queen&#x27;s Cottage, General&#x27;s House, Grand Hotel, Hill Club, St Andrew&#x27;s Hotel and Town Post Office. New hotels are often built and furnished in the colonial style. Visitors to the city can wallow in its nostalgia of bygone days by visiting the landmark buildings. Many private homes maintain their old English-style lawns and gardens.
==Climate==
Due to its highland location, Nuwara Eliya has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;), having no pronounced dry season, a monsoon-like cloudy season and with a mean annual temperature of .

In the winter months, there can be frost at night, but it warms up rapidly during the day because of the high sun angle.

==Demographics==

The majority of the population of Nuwara Eliya city is Sinhalese. There are sizable communities belonging to other ethnic groups, such as Indian Tamils and Sri Lankan Tamils.
Source: &quot;&quot;statistics.gov.lk&quot;

==Language==
Sinhala and Tamil are the two major languages spoken in Nuwara Eliya. English is also widely used by the locals.

==Festivals==

The town really comes alive in April for the Sinhalese and Tamil New Year. It is difficult to find accommodation as Sri Lankans holiday in the region during this period. The festive season starts on April 1 annually in a ceremonial manner. The ceremony consists mainly of a band show in which all the local school bands participate.

Main attractions during April include motor and horse racing events. Motor racing comes alive with the Mahagastotte and Radella Hill Climbs, the former being run since 1934. The Nuwara Eliya Road Race and the 4X4 Lake Cross on edge of Lake Gregory attract a fair share of enthusiasts. Parties are held nightly in the hotels, and the season culminates in the nine-furlong (1811 m) Governor&#x27;s Cup at the Nuwara Eliya Racecourse, Golf Tournaments at the Nuwara Eliya Golf Club, and the flower show at the end of the month.

==Attractions==

The town&#x27;s attractions include the golf course, trout streams, Victoria Park, and boating or fishing on Lake Gregory. Victoria Park is an attractive and well-used oasis. It is popular with birdwatchers at quieter times because of the good opportunities for seeing species, particularly the Indian blue robin, pied thrush or scaly thrush lurking in the denser undergrowth. The Kashmir flycatcher is another attractive bird species in the park.

Galway&#x27;s Land Bird Sanctuary, close to Lake Gregory, is an area of montane forest a few kilometers east of the town. Covering an area of 0.6 km2 it is home to many bird and mammal species endemic to Sri Lanka, including wild boar and barking deer.

The city is a base for visits to Horton Plains National Park. This is a key wildlife area of an open grassy woodland. Species found here include the leopard, sambar, and the endemic purple-faced langur. Endemic highland birds include the dull-blue flycatcher, Sri Lanka white-eye, and yellow-eared bulbul. The plains have a well-visited tourist attraction at World&#x27;s End — a sheer precipice with a 1050 m drop. The return walk passes the scenic Baker&#x27;s Falls. Early morning visits are best, both to see the wildlife and to view World&#x27;s End before mists close in during the later part of the morning.

One of the distinctive features of Nuwara Eliya&#x27;s countryside is the widespread growing of vegetables, fruit and flowers usually associated with temperate Europe. This &quot;Little England&quot; is covered with terraces growing potatoes, carrots, leeks, and roses interspersed with tea bushes on the steeper slopes.

The slow-growing tea bushes of this highland region produce some of the world&#x27;s finest orange pekoe tea. Several tea factories around Nuwara Eliya offer guided tours and the opportunity to sample or purchase their products.

&#x27;Lovers Leap&#x27; is a spectacular waterfall set among tea plantations a short walk from the town of Nuwara Eliya. It falls a height of 30m in a long cascading sheet of water. It is said that it is named after a young couple who decided to be bound together forever by jumping off the cliff to their demise.

==Other places==

A gravestone of Major Thomas William Rogers, (the Government Agent for Badulla District) is in the corner of the golf grounds. He is infamous for having shot, at the very lowest estimate 1,400 wild elephants. Folklore in Nuwara Eliya says that every year his gravestone is struck by lightning for his great sin. This place is not open for visitors.

Another place related to folklore is the Hindu temple called Seetha Kovil (Hanuman Kovil). It is found on the way to Badulla from Nuwara Eliya before reaching the Hakgala Botanical Garden. The temple is in the village called Seetha Eliya. The area is related to the Ramayana story in Hinduism. Folklore says that the mighty king Ravana kidnapped princess Seeta who was the queen of Rama and hid her where the temple now is.

There is a church called the Holy Trinity Church on Church Road, which accommodates an old graveyard. Most of the gravestones have British names on them.

== Transportation ==
The nearest train station is in Nanu Oya, about 8 km away. Scheduled air taxi from Lake Gregory Waterdrome links Nuwara Eliya to Colombo.

<text>John Joseph Cahill (21 January 189122 October 1959), also known as Joe Cahill or J. J. Cahill, was a long-serving New South Wales politician, railway worker, trade unionist and Labor Party Premier of New South Wales from 1952 to his death in 1959. Born the son of Irish migrants in Redfern, Cahill worked for the New South Wales Government Railways from the age of 16 before joining the Australian Labor Party. Being a prominent unionist organiser, including being dismissed for his role in the 1917 general strike, Cahill was elected to the Parliament of New South Wales for St George in 1925.

After many years of backbench service, including a term outside of parliament, Cahill was appointed Secretary for Public Works in 1941 and Minister for Local Government in the government of William McKell in 1944, where he led significant reforms of local government in the state, including establishing a Royal commission in 1945, and passing the landmark &quot;Local Government (Areas) Act&quot; of 1948. Promoted to Deputy Premier in 1949, Cahill became Premier of New South Wales from April 1952 to his death in October 1959. His term as premier is primarily remembered for his government&#x27;s role in post-war infrastructure development, which included the commissioning of the Sydney Opera House and construction of the expressway which now bears his name.

==Early years and family==
Joe Cahill, as he was popularly known, was born on 21 January 1891 in the inner-Sydney suburb of Redfern, the son of Irish-born parents, Thomas Cahill, and Ellen Glynn. Cahill&#x27;s father was born in County Limerick and was a NSW railways labourer at the nearby Eveleigh Railway Workshops, and his mother was the daughter of Irish immigrants from County Clare. After being educated at St Brigid&#x27;s, Marrickville, and Patrician Brothers&#x27; School, Redfern, at age 16 he was apprenticed as a fitter for the New South Wales Government Railways at the Eveleigh Railway Workshops on 2 July 1907.

As a member of the Workers&#x27; Educational Association and the Marrickville branch of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers (known from 1921 as the Amalgamated Engineering Union [AEU]), Cahill became politically active and joined the NSW Branch of the Labor Party. Like most Roman Catholics within the Labor Party he opposed conscription for World War I in 1916, and lost his railway job on 14 August 1917 after taking part in a general strike over railway workers&#x27; pay and conditions.

Cahill also made his first attempt to enter politics as a member of the Parliament of New South Wales, when he stood as the Labor candidate for the Legislative Assembly seat of Dulwich Hill at the March 1917 election. Bearing the marks of a young radical, Cahill campaigned on big ideas like the abolition of the Legislative Council and replacing the state Governor with the Lieutenant-Governor, but his comment that &quot;the wealth of the country should be placed in one big pool&quot; attracted amusement in the press. Cahill was subsequently defeated on a margin of 31-68% against the sitting Nationalist Party member, Tom Hoskins.

On 17 February 1918 his younger brother who also worked in the New South Wales railways, Sapper Thomas James Cahill, of the 4th Field Company (4th Division), Australian Engineers, was killed in action in France. His father had also died in June 1916 at the age of 58 while on active service as a reservist Sergeant-Major in the Australian Garrison Artillery. After a period of difficult unemployment, Cahill found some work selling insurance amongst other temporary jobs, but was re-employed by the New South Wales Government Railways in mid-1922 at the Randwick Tramway Workshops.

On 11 November 1922, at St Brigid&#x27;s Church, Marrickville, he married Esmey Mary Kelly, the daughter of public servant James Joseph Kelly, and they were to have three sons and two daughters. When their first son was born on 12 February 1924, they named him Thomas James after Cahill&#x27;s younger brother. On 11 December 1926, another son was born, who they named John Joseph Cahill. A third son, Brian Francis Cahill, was born on 10 December 1930.

In 1922, after taking part in an unsuccessful attempt to unseat the AEU&#x27;s NSW governing body through a federal council, Cahill among several others was sued by the union for &quot;illegally holding office within the union&quot;. Although the suit was later dismissed by the Chief Judge in Equity, Philip Street, Cahill was banned from holding office in the union until 1925.

==Early political career==

Eight years after his first tilt at state politics, Cahill was elected as one of the members of the NSW Legislative Assembly seat of St George at the 1925 state election, which brought the Labor party back into government under Jack Lang. He was never counted among the close allies of Lang, and remained on the backbench throughout Lang&#x27;s two terms in government. Cahill, along with half of the parliamentary caucus, supported Peter Loughlin, when the latter challenged Lang for the party leadership in September 1926. With the abolition of the St George constituency in 1930, Cahill ran for Arncliffe and was appointed party whip. However, Cahill lost his bid to be re-elected for Arncliffe to United Australia Party&#x27;s Horace Harper, at the 1932 election, with the electoral tide sweeping out the dismissed Lang Labor government.

This defeat, nevertheless, proved to be only a temporary setback, and Cahill found work as a shop inspector for a shoe retailer in the interim. Retaining his interest in political matters, Cahill (despite his earlier support of Loughlin) stayed loyal to Lang when many in the ALP had deserted the flamboyant ex-Premier. He exclaimed to an Arncliffe Labor meeting: &quot;Mr. Lang is the greatest friend the workers have ever had, and time will prove that Lang is right.&quot; In 1935, Cahill was returned to parliament in Arncliffe for the State Labor Party despite the overall defeat at the election, declaring that while &quot;the Press had poisoned the minds of the people, [...] ten years after he was dead the Press would proclaim Mr. Lang as the greatest hero Australia had seen for many a long day.&quot;

With Lang&#x27;s leadership in doubt after a further election loss in 1938, Cahill abandoned his former praise of Lang, and he backed a caucus motion to support federal intervention in the state branch&#x27;s factional infighting which had led to several of his colleagues defecting to the Industrial Labor Party, led by Bob Heffron, the member representing Botany in Sydney&#x27;s south-east. Cahill subsequently supported William McKell, when he successfully challenged Lang for the Labor Party leadership in September 1939, and was elected to the party executive.

A frequent speaker in the assembly, Cahill often addressed his fellow parliamentarians on railway-related matters and lobbied the government (unsuccessfully) for an extension of the Cooks River Tram Line to Arncliffe. Cahill was the Labor Party campaign director for the September 1940 federal election, which resulted in the ALP under John Curtin gaining the popular vote and winning three additional seats from Robert Menzies&#x27; United Australia Party Government, which was forced into minority status, and later fell in a confidence vote in October 1941.

==Minister of the Crown==

The Labor Party swept back into office at the May 1941 election, winning 26 seats over the United Australia Party&#x27;s (UAP) loss of 33 seats, and McKell was commissioned by the Governor, Lord Wakehurst, to form a government. When Arncliffe was abolished at the 1941 election, Cahill switched to the new electorate of Cook&#x27;s River. On 16 May 1941, Cahill was sworn in along with the rest of the ministry as Secretary of Public Works by the Governor at Government House.

Commencing office during wartime, Cahill&#x27;s role as Public Works minister was crucial through the direction of various projects to facilitate continued economic growth and in support of the war effort. The government had long supported the re-establishment of a state shipbuilding enterprise following the UAP Government of Bertram Stevens closing the NSW Government Dockyard in Newcastle in 1933, and consequently in 1942 Cahill directed the opening of the NSW Government Engineering and Shipbuilding Undertaking (known as the State Dockyard) in Newcastle, which was enshrined in the passage of the &quot;Government Engineering and Shipbuilding Undertaking Act, 1943&quot;. On his role, Cahill declared: 

Other projects commenced included various war works such as defence installations, air fields, prisoner-of-war camps, alongside important civil improvements to water and electricity infrastructure which were not delayed due to the war. By 1943, Cahill was already heavily involved in post-war infrastructure planning, with the McKell Government enabling significant investment in new public works projects such as new ports and roads. With the launching of the 22nd vessel from the State Dockyard in October 1945, Cahill declared that he was proud to have been involved in its successful re-establishment and noted that the Dockyard would &quot;continue to play a significant part in the permanent establishment of shipbuilding, which is so essential to the industrial development of the Commonwealth.&quot; As the Government had predicted, with the end of the war came a great need for new investment in infrastructure, and in 1946 Cahill introduced new bills for substantial projects such as £1.7 million for a new Mental Hospital at North Ryde and £600,000 for works to dredge and improve the Cooks River and Wolli Creek.
In 1944 Cahill became Minister for Local Government, a position he would hold for eight years; he used this position to augment local governments&#x27; powers. He established the State Brickworks at Homebush Bay. In addition, he supervised the establishment of the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, which brought electricity to much of rural New South Wales, and the Cumberland County Council, which developed the landmark county planning scheme in 1948.

In September 1949, the serving Deputy Premier, Jack Baddeley, announced his retirement from parliament and his appointment as Director of the State Coal Mines Control Board, and Cahill stood to succeed him as deputy. At the caucus meeting on 21 September, Cahill was elected Deputy Premier 21 votes to 20 against Attorney-General Clarence Martin.

==Premier of New South Wales==
When James McGirr announced his resignation as premier on the grounds of ill health on 1 April 1952, Cahill, a natural successor as deputy, put himself forward as a candidate to succeed McKell. He ran against Clive Evatt, William Francis Sheahan, Bob Heffron (by this time Education Minister), and Clarence Martin (still Attorney-General). However, the day before the ballot on 3 April, Heffron had been made aware that he would not have the numbers in caucus to win against Cahill, and consequently made arrangements to give the votes of his bloc to Cahill, in exchange for Cahill giving him support to become Deputy Premier. As a result, on 3 April Cahill defeated the only remaining rival for the premiership, namely Martin (Sheahan and Evatt had withdrawn from the contest), by 32 votes to 14. Heffron defeated Mines Secretary Joshua Arthur by 32 votes to 14 to become Deputy Premier.

Cahill won the state elections of 1953, 1956, and 1959. In November 1958, he officially opened the Wangi Power Station on Lake Macquarie.

===Sydney Opera House===

It was in November 1954 that Cahill first began to champion the idea of an opera house in Sydney on the site of the old Fort Macquarie Tram Depot at Bennelong Point. He announced an international competition for its design in September 1955. This competition was subsequently won by the Danish architect Jørn Utzon in January 1957. In August 1957, Cahill responded to criticisms that the opera house was an extravagance and inaccessible to the ordinary public by noting that, &quot;the building when erected will be available for the use of every citizen, that the average working family will be able to afford to go there just as well as people in more favourable economic circumstances, that there will be nothing savouring even remotely of a class conscious barrier and that the Opera House will, in fact, be a monument to democratic nationhood in its fullest sense.&quot;

On 5 February 1959, Cahill signed the contract for the first stage of building works for the Opera House with the chairman of Lendlease and Civil &amp; Civic, Dick Dusseldorp, and the managing director of Brederos, Jan de Vries. On the occasion of the official start of building and the laying of the foundation plaque on 2 March 1959, Cahill declared that the Sydney Opera House, &quot;will stand not merely as an outstanding example of modern architecture or even as a world famous opera house, but as a shrine in which the great artists of the world may be seen and heard and our own artists may display the flowering of Australian culture.&quot;
===Sectarian tensions===
Cahill&#x27;s political skills, his determination to avoid another Lang-style split in the party, and his government&#x27;s, and indeed personal, close alliance with Sydney&#x27;s Catholic Archbishop, Cardinal Norman Gilroy, ensured that Labor in New South Wales avoided the devastating divisions which forced the party out of office in Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland during the 1950s split.

===Illness and death in office===
A heavy smoker, Cahill suffered increasingly poor health during 1959, with Deputy Premier Bob Heffron often acting in Cahill&#x27;s place during these times. He died at Sydney Hospital of a myocardial infarction on 22 October of that year and Heffron succeeded him unopposed in the premiership. No premier of New South Wales before him had continuously remained in power as long as Cahill did and no later premier would manage to surpass the length of Cahill&#x27;s tenure until Robert Askin in 1972.

==Honours and legacy==

Survived by his wife, Esmey, daughters Gemma and Margaret, and sons Tom, John and Brian, Cahill was granted a state funeral and was laid-in-state at St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney. His funeral at the cathedral was attended by over 3,000 people, including Governor Sir Eric Woodward, Prime Minister Robert Menzies and Opposition Leader Herbert Evatt, and it was estimated that around 200,000 people lined the route from the cathedral to his burial place at Rookwood Cemetery. In his panegyric, Cardinal Norman Gilroy praised Cahill as a &quot;man of immaculate integrity&quot;.

His eldest son, Thomas James Cahill, was elected to his father&#x27;s vacated seat of Cook&#x27;s River at the subsequent December by-election and served as an MP until his death in 1983. His second son and namesake, John Joseph Cahill, served as a judge of the Industrial Commission of New South Wales from 1971 to 1998. His wife, Esmey Cahill, died at the age of 79 on 21 June 1971 at the Cahill&#x27;s long-term home at 44 Warren Road, Marrickville, and was buried beside her husband in the family plot at Rookwood Cemetery.

Over the years Cahill was given several awards. As a Member of Parliament, he received the King George VI Coronation Medal (1937), and Cahill and Esmey Cahill received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal (1953). He received an honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from the University of Sydney in 1952, an honorary Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) from the New South Wales University of Technology in 1955, and an honorary Doctor of Literature (D.Litt.) from the University of New England in 1956. On 17 December 1958, the City of Sydney decided to name the new highway across Circular Quay as the Cahill Expressway, and Cahill was present when the Blue Mountains City Council officially named Cahills Lookout in Katoomba on 6 June 1959. In 1961 the Municipality of Rockdale in his former electorate decided to name the new park in Wolli Creek as &quot;Cahill Park&quot;.

Following Cahill&#x27;s death, the new public high school in Mascot in his former seat of Cook&#x27;s River also decided to honour his memory, as well as his role in the school&#x27;s establishment, by naming itself the J J Cahill Memorial High School, which was officially opened by his widow, Esmey Cahill, on 24 March 1961. On the school&#x27;s 50th anniversary, the principal Robyn Cowin noted that Cahill &quot;was a man of genuine personal integrity, a family man and a great worker whose deeds spoke for themselves [...] His code of behaviour and indeed the manner of his life embodied the school motto &#x27;Do what is right because it is right&#x27;&quot;.

<text>Frank Duff Moores (February 18, 1933 – July 10, 2005) served as the second premier of Newfoundland as leader of the Progressive Conservatives from 1972 until his retirement in 1979. Moores was also a successful businessman in both the fishing industry and federal lobbying. He was accused accepting secret commissions as part of the Airbus affair.

==Early life and education==

Born in Carbonear, Dominion of Newfoundland, Moores was educated at St. Andrew&#x27;s College in Aurora, Ontario. He then briefly attended Boston University in the fall of 1951, but left two months later after an argument with one of his professors. He later worked briefly in the Boston fish industry and then returned to Newfoundland, where he worked in his father&#x27;s fish plant. His father, Silas Moores, was a wealthy businessman in that industry.

==Expansion of family business==

Moores worked with his father to expand the family business, North East Fisheries, to the stage that it became the largest fish processor in Newfoundland by the early 1960s and employed 2,000 people. With his father&#x27;s death of a heart attack in July 1962, he followed through on a plan to take the company to a year-round operation from the traditional summer-autumn format and then sold a majority interest to British owners.

==Politics==

With no previous experience in politics, Moores was first elected in 1968 to the House of Commons as a Progressive Conservative. The party captured six of seven seats in the province, almost all of which had been Liberal since 1949, against the national trend that elected Pierre Elliott Trudeau with a strong majority. Moores was elected to a one-year term as president of the federal PC Party in 1969.

In 1970, he resigned his federal seat and became the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland. He was asked to form a government in January 1972, several months after the October 1971 election, which resulted in a near tie between Joey Smallwood&#x27;s Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives. Moores soon called a new March 1972 election and won a strong majority. In the 1975 election, he won a reduced majority.

As premier, Moores advocated rural development and provincial control of natural resources as well as economic development. He also brought a more consultative approach to government than had prevailed under Smallwood. Under his watch, the House of Assembly became the last provincial legislature to have a Question Period.

==Later life==

He left politics in March 1979 to re-enter business and became a lobbyist. In 1983, he was an organizer of the successful federal Progressive Conservative leadership campaign for Brian Mulroney.

Moores served as an adviser to Mulroney premiership and was appointed to the Board of Air Canada, which was then a crown corporation. He also worked for Government Consultants International (GCI), a powerful Ottawa-based international lobbying firm, which then had as clients the airline firms Wardair and Nordair, which were competitors of Air Canada. Over accusations of conflict of interest, GCI later gave up Wardair and Nordair as clients. He resigned his Air Canada directorship shortly after GCI had taken on the Airbus file.

In 1987, he became the chairman of GCI and retired from this position in 1990. In the 1990s, he regained prominence for his alleged role in the Airbus affair. Karlheinz Schreiber&#x27;s accountant alleged that Moores received secret commissions from Schreiber.

On July 10, 2005, Moores died of liver cancer in Perth, Ontario.

In November 2007, in the wake of new revelations about the Airbus affair by Karlheinz Schreiber, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; published evidence indicating that Moores had written a letter about the Airbus deal to Franz Josef Strauss, the chairman of Airbus Industrie. Moores, until his death, denied having any involvement in the affair.

<text>Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) comprise a category of otherwise unrelated disease-modifying drugs defined by their use in rheumatoid arthritis to slow down disease progression. The term is often used in contrast to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (which refers to agents that treat the inflammation, but not the underlying cause) and steroids (which blunt the immune response but are insufficient to slow down the progression of the disease).

The term &quot;antirheumatic&quot; can be used in similar contexts, but without making a claim about an effect on the disease course. Other terms that have historically been used to refer to the same group of drugs are &quot;remission-inducing drugs&quot; (RIDs) and &quot;slow-acting antirheumatic drugs&quot; (SAARDs).

==Terminology==
Although the use of the term DMARDs was first propagated in rheumatoid arthritis (hence their name), the term has come to pertain to many other diseases, such as Crohn&#x27;s disease, lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, myasthenia gravis, sarcoidosis, and various others. 

The term was originally introduced to indicate a drug that reduces evidence of processes thought to underlie the disease, such as a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, reduced haemoglobin level, raised rheumatoid factor level, and more recently, a raised C-reactive protein level. More recently, the term has been used to indicate a drug that reduces the rate of damage to bone and cartilage. DMARDs can be further subdivided into traditional small molecular mass drugs synthesised chemically and newer &quot;biological&quot; agents produced through genetic engineering.

Some DMARDs (e.g. the purine synthesis inhibitors) are mild chemotherapeutics, but use a side effect of chemotherapy—&quot;immunosuppression&quot;—as their main therapeutical benefit.

==Subdivision==

DMARDs have been classified as:
* synthetic (sDMARD)
** conventional synthetic and targeted synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs and tsDMARDs, respectively)
*** csDMARDs are the traditional drugs (such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, gold salts)
*** tsDMARDs are drugs that were developed to target a particular molecular structure
* biological (bDMARD) can be further separated into original and biosimilar DMARDs (boDMARDs and bsDMARDs)
** bsDMARDs are those that have the same primary, secondary, and tertiary structure as an original (boDMARD) and possess similar efficacy and safety as the original protein

==Members==
Although these agents operate by different mechanisms, many of them can have similar impacts upon the course of a condition. Some of the drugs can be used in combination. A common triple therapy for rheumatoid arthritis is methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine.

==Alternatives==
When treatment with DMARDs fails, cyclophosphamide or steroid pulse therapy is often used to stabilise uncontrolled autoimmune disease. Some severe autoimmune diseases are being treated with bone marrow transplants in clinical trials, usually after cyclophosphamide therapy has failed. Furthermore, should DMARDs fail, tocilizumab can be used for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor treatments in NICE guidance.

Combinations of DMARDs are often used, because each drug in the combination can be used in a smaller dose than if it were given alone, thus reducing the risk of side effects.

Many patients receive an NSAID and at least one DMARD, sometimes with low-dose oral glucocorticoids. If disease remission is observed, regular NSAIDs or glucocorticoid treatment may no longer be needed. DMARDs help control arthritis, but do not cure the disease. For that reason, if remission or optimal control is achieved with a DMARD, it is often continued as a maintenance dosage. Discontinuing a DMARD may reactivate disease or cause a &quot;rebound flare&quot;, with no assurance that disease control will be re-established upon resumption of the medication.

<doc id="496817" wikidata="Q3366492" url="?curid=496817" title="Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador">
<text>The Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador is a political party in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The party is the provincial branch, and affiliate of the federal Liberal Party of Canada. It has served as the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador since December 14, 2015. The NL Liberals were re-elected to a majority government in the 2021 provincial election.

==Origins==
The party originated in 1948 as the Newfoundland Confederate Association. At this time, Newfoundland was being governed by a Commission of Government appointed by the Government of the United Kingdom. The NCA was an organization campaigning for Newfoundland to join Canadian confederation. Joey Smallwood was the NCA&#x27;s chief organizer and spokesman, and led the winning side of the 1948 Newfoundland referendum on Confederation.

==The Joey Smallwood era (1949–1972)==

Following the referendum victory, the NCA reorganized itself as the new province&#x27;s Liberal Party under Smallwood&#x27;s leadership. It won the province&#x27;s first post-Confederation election for the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly held on May 27, 1949.

The Liberals under Smallwood promoted the diversification of the province&#x27;s economy through various megaprojects. The provincial government invested in the construction of factories, the pulp and paper industry, the oil industry, hydro-electricity projects, the construction of highways and schools, the relocation of rural villages into larger centres, and other projects. These projects were often very expensive, and yielded few results.

Smallwood led the province virtually unchallenged for two decades, during which he never faced more than eight opposition MHAs. However, by the late 1960s, disaffection with Smallwood and his government mounted within the province. He had always had a somewhat autocratic bent, a tendency that increased during the 1960s. He tended to treat his ministers as extensions of his authority rather than colleagues.

In hopes of stemming the tide, Smallwood brought several younger Liberals into government during this time, but this did little to rebuild his popularity. He announced his retirement in 1969, only to run in the ensuing leadership contest. Smallwood defeated John Crosbie, one of the younger ministers, for the leadership. Crosbie along with many young Liberals defected to the opposition Progressive Conservatives. The Progressive Conservatives had previously found support largely in the business community, and in and around St. John&#x27;s.

The Liberals narrowly lost the 1971 election, but Smallwood refused to resign as Premier until January 1972 as the support of the Labrador Party&#x27;s lone MHA resulted in a 21–21 tie in the House of Assembly for Smallwood&#x27;s government. Frank Moores&#x27; Conservatives attempted to form government but its shaky hold on power resulted in the 1972 general election. This time, Smallwood&#x27;s Liberals were conclusively defeated, falling to only nine seats.

Smallwood was forced out of the party, and formed his own Newfoundland Reform Liberal Party, which ran in the 1975 general election against the Liberals and the Tories. Due in part to massive vote-splitting, the Tories won 30 seats against 20 for the two Liberal factions combined (14 for the Liberals and 6 for the Reform Liberals). The Liberals were badly split and demoralized, and remained on the opposition benches until 1989.

==The party under Clyde Wells (1987–1996)==
In the 1989 provincial election, the Liberals returned to power under Clyde Wells, winning 31 of the 52 seats in the House of Assembly. Despite their majority win the Progressive Conservatives narrowly won the popular vote, winning 47.6% of the vote compared to 47.2 for the Liberals.

Under Wells, the Liberal government eschewed the megaprojects and spending of the Smallwood, Moores and Peckford eras in favour of an economic development program laid out in the Strategic Economic Plan. During a severe economic recession, the Wells administration introduced spending controls and reduced the size of the public service while at the same time maintaining social program spending and working to diversify and develop the economy. Wells rose to national prominence in early 1990 for his opposition to the Meech Lake constitutional Accord. In September 1990, Wells signed a development agreement for the Hibernia project, thereby laying the foundation for the province&#x27;s oil and gas industry and future economic prosperity. When Wells retired in 1996, he was replaced by former federal Liberal cabinet minister Brian Tobin.

==Tobin Government (1996-2000)==
In 1996, Tobin resigned from federal politics to succeed Clyde Wells as leader of the governing Liberal Party of Newfoundland and premier. The Liberal Party won a large majority government later that year. During his time as premier Tobin pursued tough negotiations with out-of-province companies seeking to export resources for refining and smelting elsewhere. He insisted that the resources will never be mined unless Newfoundlanders received secondary manufacturing and tertiary service spin-offs. A similar tough stance was taken in seeking to develop the Lower Churchill River, keeping in mind the contract his predecessor Joey Smallwood had negotiated. His Liberals won re-election in 1999.

It was also during this time in the lead-up to the millennium that Newfoundland undertook an aggressive tourism marketing campaign which focused on important anniversaries such as the 500th year since John Cabot&#x27;s voyage of discovery (1997), as well as the 1000th year since Vikings, such as Leif Ericson, made landfall on the province&#x27;s shores (2000).

Tobin returned to federal politics in 2000, after only four years as Premier.

Less than two years into his second mandate, Tobin announced his resignation as premier on October 16, 2000, to return to federal politics. Tobin&#x27;s Deputy Premier Beaton Tulk was sworn in as his successor the same day and served as premier till a leadership convention could be held the new year. Minister of Health Roger Grimes, Fisheries Minister John Efford and Mines and Energy Minister Paul Dicks all announced their intentions to contest the February 2001 leadership race.

Grimes and Efford were the perceived frontrunners in the leadership race and were considered to be very different candidates with different strengths. Grimes was considered to be the candidate of the party establishment, he had a low-profile with a proven track record in several difficult portfolios. Efford on the other hand was a charismatic, populist politician whose outspokenness has caused some controversy. Efford&#x27;s outspokenness alienated members of the establishment but won him the support of the party&#x27;s grassroots.

After the first ballot at the convention no candidate won the 50 per cent required to be elected leader. Dicks was thus eliminated after finishing third and immediately threw his support behind Efford, hoping to defeat Grimes who had finished first on the ballot. Dicks&#x27; support was not enough and on the second ballot Grimes was elected leader; defeating Efford by 14 votes. The three-month race had included nasty and personal attacks between the candidates, and when Grimes was announced as the leader he received boos from Efford&#x27;s supporters. Grimes was sworn in as Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador on February 13, 2001. While Efford had called for the party to unite behind Grimes at the leadership convention, Dicks left politics immediately while Efford turned down a cabinet post and resigned in May of that year to enter federal politics.

==The party under Roger Grimes (2001–2005)==
Grimes served as the province&#x27;s eighth premier, from February 13, 2001 until November 6, 2003. The Liberals had been in power for 12 years when Grimes won the leadership; he attempted to reinvigorate the party by distancing himself from Tobin. A major priority for Grimes as premier was to re-open talks with the mining company Inco Ltd., who had proposed to build a nickel mine in northern Labrador. Talks had stalled under Tobin, who insisted the nickel from Labrador must be processed in the province. On June 11, 2002, Grimes&#x27; government reached a deal with Inco, six years after negotiations first began. Inco agreed to build a processing facility on Newfoundland, but the deal allowed for them to ship nickel to other facilities for processing before that facility was built.

In 2003, the federal government declared a moratorium on the last remaining cod fishery in Atlantic Canada in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. While Newfoundland and Labrador was again the most directly affected province by this decision, communities on Quebec&#x27;s North Shore and in other parts of Atlantic Canada also faced difficulties.

Grimes called for a review of the Act of Union by which the province had become a part of Canada and on July 2, 2003, the findings of the Royal Commission on Renewing and Strengthening Our Place in Canada (which Grimes had created in 2002) were released. Critics called this inquiry the &quot;Blame Canada Commission&quot;.

Grimes often clashed with the federal Liberal government of Jean Chrétien and became increasingly critical of his predecessor, Tobin. When Grimes accused the federal government of bias in the Gulf of St. Lawrence cod moratorium, many even in Newfoundland and Labrador saw him as stirring up unnecessary trouble for political gain. After the Royal Commission on Renewing and Strengthening Our Place in Canada, Grimes&#x27; popularity began to decline as his increasingly confrontational approach made it more difficult to win concessions from the federal government.

==The party in Opposition==

===2003 general election===
By 2003, the Liberals had spent fourteen years in power under four different leaders. Public disaffection had mounted resulting in their electoral defeat by Danny Williams and the Tories. Grimes stayed on as Liberal leader until his retirement on May 30, 2005, when he was replaced, initially on an interim basis, by Gerry Reid.

Lawyer Jim Bennett was acclaimed party leader on February 6, 2006, after no other candidate came forward for the post. Bennett&#x27;s leadership started causing rifts within the Liberal caucus after controversial policies statements and his reported abrasive leadership style. In April of that year Bennett was criticized by Reid, who was still serving as Opposition Leader, over his proposal to create a two-tier minimum wage based on age. On May 8, 2006, Bennett resigned as Liberal leader, just three months after being acclaimed to the position. Reid then resumed the leadership, now on a permanent basis, and lead the party into the next election.

===2007 general election===
In the October 2007 provincial election, the Liberal Party&#x27;s support fell to its lowest level since Confederation. The party won just three of the 48 seats in the House of Assembly. Reid resigned as leader after losing his seat, and Yvonne Jones was named interim leader.

===Liberals under Yvonne Jones (2007–2011)===

With only three members re-elected following the 2007 general election, the party decided that Jones would stand as the party&#x27;s leader on an interim basis, and therefore as the Official Opposition Leader in the House of Assembly. Jones became the first woman to serve as the leader of the Liberals and only the second woman to serve as Official Opposition Leader.

Seven by-elections have been held since Jones took over the leadership of the Liberal Party, each one to replace a Tory MHA. Six of the by-elections were won by a Progressive Conservative candidate and the Liberals won one. The by-election they won was held on October 27, 2009 in the district of The Straits - White Bay North. The by-election was held to replace Minister of Transportation and Works, Trevor Taylor, who resigned on October 2, 2009. Liberal candidate Marshall Dean squeaked out a win taking 1,975 votes compared to 1,799 for PC candidate Rick Pelley. The by-election was mostly focused on Premier Williams&#x27; plan to make cuts to rural health care in this area. He announced days before the by-election he would not make cuts to the district&#x27;s rural health care after protests from residents.

===May 2011 leadership election===
A leadership convention was scheduled for the spring of 2008, but due to lack of interest in the leadership the convention was delayed. The convention was rescheduled for November 2010 with nominations closing on July 30, 2010. On July 9, 2010, Yvonne Jones officially submitted nomination papers, and with the close of nominations at the end of the month she was the only candidate to file nomination papers and was acclaimed leader. Jones announced weeks later she had breast cancer and the leadership election was postponed till May 2011. On May 25, 2011, she was sworn in as the permanent leader of the party.

===Liberals under Aylward (2011–2012)===

On August 9, 2011, Jones resigned as leader due to her health. That night the executive of the party decided the process of choosing the next leader, nominations for the leadership opened on August 10, 2011, and Kevin Aylward was chosen by the executive on August 14, 2011. Aylward led the party during the October 11, 2011, election. The campaigned on a platform that advocated for the creation of a legacy fund for offshore oil revenues, a new deal to develop the Lower Churchill hydroelectric development, annual increase to retired public service pensions, improve high-speed internet and cellphone service in rural areas, merge the Department of Business with the Department of Innovation, Trade, and Rural Development, establish a fisheries investment and diversification fund, creation of a fisheries loan board, initiate a judicial inquiry dealing with management of the fishery and operating a marine rescue subcentre in the province.

The party was unable to gain momentum under Aylward&#x27;s leadership, after tying the NDP in opinion polls in May 2011, the Liberals fell to third place in polling during the election campaign. On election night the Progressive Conservatives won their third straight majority government. The Liberals placed third in the popular vote on election night, winning just 19.1 per cent of the vote. However, they managed to increase their number of seats to six and remain the Official Opposition. On October 26, 2011, Aylward announced his resignation as leader after failing to win the district of St. George&#x27;s-Stephenville East in the election.

==Liberals under Dwight Ball (2012–2020)==

In December 2011, the party announced that Humber Valley MHA Dwight Ball would assume the role as Leader of the Official Opposition and interim leader of the Liberal Party on January 3, 2012.
 The Party announced in May 2012, that their next leadership election will occur between November 15 and 17, 2013. On July 18, 2013 Bay of Islands MHA Eddie Joyce was named Leader of the Opposition replacing Dwight Ball who resigned to run for the leadership permanently in the 2013 convention.

===Ball Government (2015–2020)===
In the 2015 general election, the Tories lost their majority to the Liberals making their government the shortest in the province&#x27;s history since joining Canada (it lasted from 2003 to 2015, 12 years). The party won every by-election in the years between the 2011 general election and the election in 2015 and some Tory MHAs crossed the floor to the Liberal Party including former cabinet minister Tom Osborne. In the months ahead of the election in 2015 the Liberals lead in the polls, often with support from the majority of respondents. The party won 31 of 40 seats in the election.

Since the election support for the Liberal Party has dropped significantly. This started in April 2016 when Finance Minister Cathy Bennett unveiled the government&#x27;s budget. Due to the ongoing fall in oil prices and high public debt due to overspending by the Tories under Williams and Dunderdale, the province faced a massive deficit and thus, the Liberal government planned tax increases and cuts to government services including the closure of libraries and courthouses. Combined with the mismanagement of the Lower Churchill Project and Nalcor Energy, this led to Ball being one of Canada&#x27;s least popular heads of government only seven months after being elected with a majority of votes.

On June 16, 2018 delegates at the Liberal Party Annual General Meeting vote to endorse the leadership of Dwight Ball with 79% voting against the party holding a leadership convention.

In the 2019 provincial election, despite consistent Progressive Conservative leads in polling through the debate, including a 9 point lead in the final poll, released a day before the election, the Liberal Party led by Ball won re-election, but nonetheless fell one seat short of retaining their majority after an unexpected loss to the New Democrats in Labrador West by 5 votes (later lowered to 2 votes). The Liberals won 20 out of 40 seats in the legislature.

==Liberals under Andrew Furey (2020–present)==

Andrew Furey was elected leader on August 3, 2020. He was appointed as Premier on August 19, 2020, following Ball&#x27;s resignation. On August 19, 2020, Furey was formally sworn in as Premier, along with his provincial cabinet. On October 6, 2020, Furey won a by-election in Humber-Gros Morne; this gained him a seat in the legislature. 

On January 15, 2021, Furey asked for consent from Lieutenant Governor Judy Foote to dissolve the House of Assembly to call for an election in order to obtain a stronger mandate in the form of a majority government. The election was originally scheduled for February 15, 2021 but a COVID-19 outbreak in St. John&#x27;s forced Elections NL to switch to a mail-in election, cancelling in-person voting for all districts. The deadline was set on March 25, 2021 and the results were announced on March 27, 2021 with the Furey government winning a majority government.

On September 12, 2022, Premier Furey announced that Independent MHA Perry Trimper would be rejoining the Liberal caucus.

Beginning in December 2023, ahead of a by-election for Conception Bay East–Bell Island expected in early 2024, campaign signs identified the party primarily using a &quot;Furey&quot; logotype, with a reference to &quot;Newfoundland and Labrador Liberals&quot; in smaller print. Political analysts suggested the change was made due to Furey&#x27;s personal popularity combined with dropping poll numbers for the federal Liberals under Justin Trudeau. Furey himself indicated that there was no plan to further separate the parties, which he said already operate as distinct entities. On January 30, 2024, Liberal Fred Hutton won the by-election. On April 15, 2024, the Fogo Island-Cape Freels by-election was held. Progressive Conservative candidate Jim McKenna was elected, gaining the seat from the Liberals. On May 27, 2024, Progressive Conservative candidate Lin Paddock was elected in the Baie Verte-Green Bay by-election, gaining the seat from the Liberals. On August 22, 2024, the Waterford Valley by-election was held electing Liberal Jamie Korab. 

On February 25, 2025, Andrew Furey announced his pending resignation as premier and leader of the Liberal Party. He&#x27;ll remain as premier and party leader, until his successor is chosen.

<text>The Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador is a provincial political party in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The party was founded in 1949 and most recently formed the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador from the 2003 general election until the 2015 general election. The party has served as the official opposition to the government of Newfoundland and Labrador since 14 December 2015. On October 14, 2023, MHA Tony Wakeham was elected leader.

==History==

===Origins===
The party originated before Newfoundland&#x27;s confederation with Canada as the Responsible Government League (RGL). The RGL campaigned for responsible government to return to Newfoundland, after being suspended in 1934. In the 1948 referendum, Newfoundland narrowly voted to join Canada as its tenth province. Following the referendum, federal parties started organizing in Newfoundland and most members of the RGL decided to align themselves with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, to form the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland.

=== In the political wilderness (1949–1972) ===
Harry Mews was acclaimed as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party and led them into the 1949 provincial election. Liberal leader Joey Smallwood, who had campaigned for confederation in 1948, led his party to victory, winning 22 seats of the 28 seats available. The Progressive Conservatives only managed to win five seats and Mews, who ran in the district of St. John&#x27;s West, was unsuccessful in his bid for a seat in the House of Assembly. Mews was elected mayor of St. John&#x27;s later that year and stepped down as party leader soon after.

The Progressive Conservatives struggled to make gains in the province, being tarred as anti-confederates. Their support was confined to Roman Catholic communities on the Avalon Peninsula outside of St. John&#x27;s, which had been anti-confederation strongholds in the 1940s. Smallwood continued to lead the Liberal Party through the 1950s and 1960s; however, by 1969 his government started facing problems. Failed megaprojects and controversial policy decisions had started turning the public against Smallwood and his government. He attempted to revitalize his party by appointing younger men to his cabinet, such as John Crosbie, Edward Roberts and Clyde Wells. However, Smallwood continued to face internal strife and announced his resignation as leader and his retirement from politics in 1969. When Crosbie became the front-runner to succeed him as leader, Smallwood decided to run for the leadership. Smallwood&#x27;s leadership bid was successful and Crosbie, along with a number of young Liberals, defected to the Progressive Conservatives.

The defections of Crosbie and others revitalized the Progressive Conservatives. No longer tarred by their anti-confederate stance in 1948, the Tories were viewed to be a fresh and modern party. For the first time since confederation they became a credible force in forming government. Under the leadership of Gerald Ottenheimer, the party became better organized and built district associations throughout the province. In May 1971, Frank Moores, the federal Member of Parliament for the Avalon-based riding of Bonavista—Trinity—Conception, was elected as party leader.

=== Moores era (1971–1979) ===
Moores led the Tories into the 1971 election. They took 18 seats from the Liberals for a total of 21 seats in the House of Assembly; they had never won more than seven seats previously. The Liberals won 20 seats, leaving the balancee of power with the New Labrador Party&#x27;s one MHA, Tom Burgess, a former Liberal dissident. Burgess decided to support the Conservatives, allowing Moores to form government by one seat. Smallwood resigned as premier on 18 January 1972, and Moores was sworn in as the second Premier of Newfoundland.

However, when Moores reneged on a promise to name Burgess to cabinet, Burgess defected back to the Liberals. Conservative MHA Hugh Shea crossed the floor to the Liberals just days after Moores was sworn in. Just hours after the new House met, Moores realized he was in no position to govern. He asked Lieutenant Governor Ewart Harnum to dissolve the legislature and call another election. In the March election, Moores led his party to a decisive victory, taking 33 seats and 61% of the vote. The once-dominant Liberals, now led by Roberts (who had ousted Smallwood as leader two months earlier), won nine seats and 37% of the popular vote. Moores was reelected to a second term on 16 September 1975. The number of districts in the province had increased to 52, and the Progressive Conservatives won 30 seats and 46% of the popular vote.

Moores promised that his administration would make government more democratic and accountable, which was in contrast to Smallwood&#x27;s domineering leadership style. The new Progressive Conservative government vowed to promote rural development and take greater control of the province&#x27;s natural resources, it also distanced itself from the Liberal Party&#x27;s resettlement plans, and industrialization policies.

The Moores government was successful in bringing about democratic reforms. His government brought in daily question period, which was common in most legislative assemblies in Canada but was non-existent in Newfoundland. The government also passed the Conflict of Interest Act in 1973, which was the first legislation of its kind in Canada. The act required elected officials and senior civil servants to make public any investments or relationships that could influence the performance of their official duties. It also forbade MHAs from voting or speaking on issues where a conflict of interest could exist. While Smallwood had treated his cabinet as an extension of his authority, Moores gave his ministers more independence and greater control over their departments. The government created a planning and priorities committee of senior ministers, who would discuss and create policy on resource development, government services, and social programs. In 1975, an independent and non-partisan provincial ombudsman was created. His role was to investigate complaints from citizens who felt they were unfairly treated by government departments or agencies.

While the Moores government was successful in implementing democratic reforms, his government had little impact on improving Newfoundland&#x27;s economy. Much of his time in power was monopolized with completing unfinished industrial projects negotiated by Smallwood, many of which were unsuccessful. The government tried to re-negotiate the sale of Upper Churchill Hydro electricity to Hydro-Quebec, but was unsuccessful. In 1974, $160 million was paid the British Newfoundland Corporation (BRINCO) to buy back water rights and obtain a controlling interest in the Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corporation Limited, with hopes of developing hydro power on the Lower Churchill river. However, the government was not able to negotiate a transmission route across Quebec to sell power into the North American market. The Stephenville linerboard mill was another drain on government money and resources. By the time Moores took office in 1972, the mill&#x27;s projected cost had increased from $75 million to $122 million, and government guarantees had more than doubled from $53 million to $110 million. The mill was losing $100 on every ton of linerboard it produced by 1976, and needed government subsidies to stay afloat. The province closed the mill, owned by the Crown corporation Labrador Linerboard Limited, in August 1977 and sold the mill to Abitibi-Price Ltd. for $43.5 million. The Come By Chance Refinery also cost the government millions of dollars in loans, including $60 million in 1975. The refinery was $42 million in debt to the province when it filed for bankruptcy in 1976.

With so much money and resources being spent on industrial projects, the Moores government was unable to follow through on promises of rural development. Between five and 10% of government spending was earmarked for fisheries, agriculture, forestry, tourism, and rural development. While Moores disagreed with Smallwood&#x27;s resettlement plans outmigration of rural to urban areas continued without government intervention. The province&#x27;s fishery struggled, due to overcapacity in the industry. Unemployment was a major problem in the province, which was only exacerbated by an increasing birth rate since the 1940s. During its first five years in power, the Moores administration increased the public service from 7,600 employees to 9,300. By 1977, the province was spending more money on salaries than it received in tax revenues. At the same time, the province unemployment rate was estimated at 34%. Newfoundland relied on loans and federal transfer payments to pay salaries, finance industrial project and fund other expenditures. Moores announced he was retiring as premier in 1979. When he left office, the provincial debt was approximately $2.6 billion, up from $970 million in 1972.

=== Peckford era (1979–1989) ===
In the 1979 leadership convention, 10 candidates came forward to succeed Moores as leader and premier. The leading candidates in the race were Leo Barry, Walter Carter, Bill Doody and Brian Peckford. At the convention Peckford, who most recently served as Minister of Energy and Mines, was elected Progressive Conservative leader after three ballots. He was sworn in as the third Premier of Newfoundland on 26 March 1979. On 26 May 1979, the legislature was dissolved and an election was set for 18 June 1979. On election night Peckford led the party to an increased majority government, winning 33 seats and 50% of the popular vote. In the 1982 provincial election Peckford led the Progressive Conservatives to a second, and larger, majority government. His party won 60% of the popular vote and took 44 of the 52 seats in the legislature. In the 1985, provincial election the Tories were once again re-elected under Peckford&#x27;s leadership. However, a significant increase in support for the New Democratic Party (NDP), and a bump in Liberal support, resulted in a significantly reduced majority for the Tories. They won 49% of the vote and 36 seats in the House of Assembly.

Peckford&#x27;s premiership was heavily focused on resource development. He strove for greater independence from the federal government through constitutional reform, so that Newfoundland could manage its natural resources. Peckford&#x27;s goals resonated well with voters in the province who were embracing nationalism and their distinct culture. However, much of the province&#x27;s natural resources were already controlled by outside interests. The disastrous Upper Churchill deal, signed by Smallwood, was benefitting Quebec instead of Newfoundland, mining in Labrador West was controlled by the Iron Ore Company of Canada, multinational companies controlled the forestry, while the federal government controlled much of the fishery. The offshore oil was a new industry which could have very lucrative benefits for the impoverished province, however the federal government challenged Newfoundland&#x27;s claimed ownership of the resource.

The Peckford administration worked to renegotiate the lopsided Upper Churchill contract with Quebec, however repeated attempts were unsuccessful. The federal government was unwilling to intervene, and in 1984 and 1988 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled twice in Quebec&#x27;s favour. Like his predecessor, Peckford hoped to develop the Lower Churchill hydro project, but his government was also unsuccessful in securing a transmission route through Quebec. His government sought for constitutional change so that the province would have greater control of the fisheries, but Peckford was unable to get enough support from other premiers. The government did its best to influence federal fisheries policies, but Ottawa still brought in controversial policies that Peckford felt were disastrous. His government also continued with policies that added to overcapacity in the fishery, such as allowing too many fish processing plants to operate.

The biggest success of Peckford&#x27;s tenure was the signing of the Atlantic Accord, which led to the development of the province&#x27;s offshore oil industry. In 1984, the Supreme Court of Canada had ruled that the due to oil being located offshore Newfoundland it fell under federal jurisdiction. However, in 1985, Peckford negotiated the Atlantic Accord with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, the Accord gave the province equal say over offshore management and a large slice of all revenues. The Accord received widespread support and was hailed as a turning point in the province&#x27;s economy, however it would take years for the offshore oil industry to be developed.

Constitutional reform was a major topic in Canada throughout the 1980s. In 1981, Peckford was instrumental in adding a clause to the Canadian constitution recognizing affirmative action programs. He also supported the Meech Lake Accord, which he hoped would decentralize federal authority and give the province a greater say over fisheries and offshore oil management. Other notable events under Peckford included the appointment of Lynn Verge and Hazel Newhook to the provincial cabinet in 1979, they became the first women to serve as cabinet ministers in Newfoundland and Labrador. Peckford&#x27;s government also adopted a new provincial flag on 6 June 1980. The province implemented twelfth grade in 1983, the same year construction began on the Trans-Labrador Highway. His government also partnered with Philip Sprung to build hydroponic greenhouses on the island and sell cucumbers in Atlantic Canada and the eastern United States. The &quot;Sprung Greenhouse&quot; was constructed near the St. John&#x27;s-Mount Pearl boundary, but was an economic failure. Cucumbers grown at the greenhouse were more expensive than what was already available in grocery stores, the province spent $22 million on the Sprung Greenhouse before it went into receivership in 1989.

Towards the end of his political career, Peckford became increasingly unpopular. The provincial economy continued to struggle throughout his premiership, unemployment remained high and revenues were low. A global recession hurt the province&#x27;s resource sector and the fishery was the brink of collapse. Peckford&#x27;s promise of rural development only led to make-work projects and federally administered employment insurance programs. While he had hoped the Sprung Greenhouse would help diversify the economy it only hurt the credibility and popularity of him and his party. On 21 January 1989, Peckford announced his retirement from politics.

In that year&#x27;s leadership election, Fisheries Minister Tom Rideout was narrowly elected leader, beating four other men.

=== Defeat and opposition (1989–2003) ===
Rideout was sworn in as premier of Newfoundland on 22 March 1989. A week after being sworn in as premier he called a general election to be held on 20 April 1989. The Progressive Conservatives went into the election with a large lead in public opinion polls, but that lead evaporated as the campaign wore on. On election night Clyde Wells led his Liberal Party to victory, winning 31 seats compared to 21 for the Tories. While the Liberal Party were able to win more seats and form government, the Progressive Conservatives had actually won the popular vote by a slim 1,400-vote margin.

Rideout stayed on as leader of the party until 17 January 1991, when he announced his resignation. Rideout stated that the party had a better chance of winning the next election with a new leader. Rideout was succeeded as leader by Len Simms, who led the party into the 1993 general election. The election was heavily focused on the economy. The Liberals, under Wells, campaigned on cutting $70 million from the public sector payroll, while both the Tories and New Democrats felt the cuts proposed by Wells were too drastic. The Liberal Party was re-elected and the PC Party lost support and seats to both the Liberals and New Democrats.

Simms resigned as leader in 1994 and a leadership convention was held on the weekend of 28–29 April 1995. Unlike the 1979 and 1989 leadership conventions, which saw a large number of candidates, the 1995 race saw just two candidates seek the leadership; Lynn Verge and Loyola Sullivan. Verge was first elected in 1979, becoming one of the first women to serve as a cabinet minister; she had been Deputy Premier under Rideout. Sullivan was a businessman and former educator who was first elected in a 1992 by-election. Both were seen as representing different factions of the party; Verge represented the progressive wing while Sullivan represented the conservative wing. The leadership contest was considered to be a bitter affair by some, with Verge winning by a margin of three votes. With her win, Verge became the first woman to serve as leader of a political party in the province&#x27;s history.

The PC Party caucus was divided following Verge&#x27;s win, not only due to her representing the progressive wing but also because of her gender. The divisions within the party remained quiet during her first six months as leader, but became public by November. The PC Party had been confident that they could defeat Wells in the next election, but by November 1995, a Corporate Research Associates (CRA) poll showed that the Liberals held a large lead over the Tories. The following month Wells announced he would be stepping down as premier of Newfoundland. On 26 January 1996, Wells was replaced by Brian Tobin, a popular federal minister in Jean Chrétien&#x27;s government. There were discussions of ousting Verge as leader, until Tobin called a snap election for 22 February 1996. There were fears that the Liberals would win every seat in the legislature; in the end the PC Party won nine seats and 39% of the popular vote. Although this was the Tories&#x27; worst showing in 30 years, Verge had managed to close the gap between the Tories and Liberals as the campaign wore on. Indeed, some Liberal insiders even admitted she could have won the popular vote in the election if the campaign had lasted another week. Verge lost her own seat by seven votes. She subsequently resigned as leader and was succeeded by Sullivan on an interim basis.

Ed Byrne became leader of the Progressive Conservatives in 1998, when he was uncontested for the leadership, and led the party into the 1999 general election. The party gained 2.11% more of the popular vote in the election and increased their caucus from nine members to 14. Two years later, Byrne stepped down as leader of the party and successful businessman and lawyer Danny Williams was acclaimed his successor.

=== Williams era (2001–2010) ===

Two months after taking the leadership, Williams won a by-election in the Corner Brook district of Humber West. The Progressive Conservatives won four by-elections after the 1999 election, and gained another MHA when Liberal Party member Ross Wiseman crossed the floor to join the party. When the legislature was dissolved for the 2003 election the party had increased its caucus to 19 members. In the election the Tories were returned to power after 14 years, winning 34 of the province&#x27;s 48 seats. In the provincial election in 2007 the Progressive Conservatives won a landslide victory. The party won 44 out of the 48 seats in the House of Assembly and took just under 70% of the popular vote, the largest win for any party in the province&#x27;s history.

Early in Williams&#x27; first term as premier he took a more fiscally conservative approach to governing. He reduced the size of the provincial cabinet following the election, and months later reformed government departments. After discovering that the province was in worse financial shape than previously thought, and facing annual deficits of $1 billion, he made a number of controversial cuts. The construction of new hospitals and schools, that had been planned under the previous Liberal government, were put on hold, and the number of school and health boards were compressed. After a monthlong strike the government legislated public service employees back to work in April 2004, without a pay raise.

After a successful fight with the federal Liberal government to re-negotiate the fiscal arrangement of the Atlantic Accord and a significant increase in oil prices, offshore oil revenues led to record surpluses for the provincial government. The new surpluses led to the Williams government reducing income taxes and significantly increasing government spending. The increases in spending was largely focussed on upgrading the province&#x27;s infrastructure and social programs. He also gave public service employees increases in pay of over 20%, to make up for years that their pay was frozen. By the time he left office in 2010, government spending had skyrocketed, his provincial cabinet had increased to 18 ministers and the size of the public service was significantly larger than when he took office. While government spending was up substantially his government still managed to reduce the province&#x27;s net debt by roughly $4 billion and Williams was considered one of the most fiscally responsible premiers in Canada.

On 25 November 2010, Williams announced that he would step down as premier on 3 December 2010 and that Deputy Premier Kathy Dunderdale would serve as the premier of the province until the Progressive Conservatives chose a new leader in 2011.

=== Dunderdale era (2010–2014) ===

Kathy Dunderdale was sworn in as the tenth Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador on 3 December 2010, following the resignation of Williams. She became the first woman in the province to hold the post and only the sixth woman in Canada to become premier. Although she had stated she would not seek the leadership of the party Dunderdale announced on 30 December 2010, that she was entering the leadership race with the backing of her entire caucus. She was the only eligible candidate to seek the leadership and was sworn in as party leader on 2 April 2011. Later that year Dunderdale led the Progressive Conservatives to their third consecutive victory in the provincial election. Despite a drop in support from the previous election the PC Party elected 37 MHAs and won 56% of the popular vote. The development of the Muskrat Falls project, along with other natural resource developments, and the reining in of public spending dominated her time as premier. As well Dunderdale faced many questions about her leadership and communication skills as public support for her and her government declined significantly during her three years in office.

In the lead up to the 2012 budget, Dunderdale and her ministers began to warn the public of looming spending cuts to rein in projected multi-year deficits. Dunderdale said her government had a goal of finding $100 million in savings. When the budget was released on 24 April 2012, it contained few cuts and government spending increased by 1.7%. Finance Minister Tom Marshall said that instead of making large cuts all at once that the government would embark on a &quot;core mandate analysis&quot; to restrain spending growth for the next ten years. The government forecasted that they would run a deficit of $258 million for the 2012–2013 fiscal year. In June 2012, Dunderdale&#x27;s government brought forth controversial legislation, known as Bill 29, that reformed the province&#x27;s Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The legislation received widespread criticism from opposition parties, the public and experts in the field of access to information laws. Bill 29 was passed in the House of Assembly after a four-day filibuster by opposition parties. Three months after the bill was passed longtime MHA and former cabinet minister Tom Osborne announced he was leaving the PC caucus due to dissatisfaction with Dunderdale&#x27;s leadership and his opposition to Bill 29, which he had voted for. On 17 December 2012, Dunderdale along with Emera Energy announced they had both officially sanctioned the Muskrat Falls project, two years after the project was first announced.

While the Dunderdale government and the PC Party fared well in opinion polling conducted throughout 2012 their support trended downwards. In December 2012, a CRA poll showed support for the Progressive Conservatives was at 46%, a drop of 14 percentage points in a year. The same poll showed satisfaction with government stood at 58%, down from 75% in a December 2011 poll. Dunderdale&#x27;s personal numbers took the biggest hit. Only 36% of people thought Dunderdale was the best choice for premier, down from 59% in a year.

In January 2013, Dunderdale shuffled Jerome Kennedy into the finance portfolio as her government once again warned of large spending cuts. When Kennedy delivered his budget on 26 March 2013, he announced the government would run a $563.8 million deficit for the 2013 fiscal year. The budget included $300 million in spending cuts and saw 1,200 public sector jobs eliminated. Dissatisfaction with Dunderdale and her government increased significantly after the release of the 2013 budget. In the first public opinion poll released after the budget, 65% of respondents said they were dissatisfied with the government&#x27;s performance. Only 21% felt Dunderdale was the best choice for premier, behind the other two party leaders, and the Progressive Conservative Party fell to third place.

Despite a number of big wins for her government throughout the last half of 2013, Dunderdale struggle to regain the ground she had lost in public opinion following that year&#x27;s budget. In September her government announced a tentative deal had been reached with NAPE, the province&#x27;s largest public sector union. Earlier in the year Carol Furlong, the president of NAPE, warned that the union had a war chest built up if a strike was necessary. Her government reached agreements with several other unions throughout the remainder of the year. In October she joined officials with Husky Energy to announce that the company would build a new offshore oil platform for the West White Rose Extension in Placentia. Only weeks later her government announced the benefits they had negotiated as part of the Canada&#x27;s Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the European Union, particularly with regards to the fishery. The provincial government agreed to eliminate minimum process requirement for the European Union in exchange for the elimination of high tariffs on seafood. Days later Dunderdale and her ministers were joined with fishing industry officials to announce that as part of the free trade agreement the provincial and federal governments would invest $400 million into the fishery over three years. In December she announced all financing for the Muskrat Falls was in place, with the province borrowing $5-billion, with a 40-year term at 3.8% interest.

While her government&#x27;s satisfaction increased throughout the last quarter of 2013, there was little change in Dunderdale&#x27;s personal numbers or support for the Progressive Conservative Party. A CRA poll released in December showed the party had move back into second place, due to a collapse in NDP support, but the gap between them and the first place Liberals increased significantly. The Progressive Conservatives polled at 29% compared to 52% for the Liberals and 19% for the NDP. Dunderdale faced many questions about her leadership but stated numerous times she was not resigning before the next election.

In early January 2014, the province experienced wide spread power outages that effected 190,000 customers. The outages were a result of cold temperatures coupled with problems at generating facilities. The outages lasted for several days which caused businesses to close and delayed the opening of schools and post-secondary institutes following their Christmas break. Dunderdale faced criticism for not addressing the public until several days after rolling blackouts began. When she did address the public Dunderdale was accused of downplaying the significance of the blackouts. Former cabinet minister Shawn Skinner said Dunderdale lacked empathy and compassion when stating that there was no crisis. After weeks of outrage over her handling of the power issue, which saw a PC MHA cross the floor to the Liberals, it was reported that Dunderdale was returning early from vacation to announce her resignation.

On 22 January 2014, Dunderdale announced her resignation as premier in the lobby of the Confederation Building, stating &quot;just as you know when it&#x27;s time to step up, you also know when it is time to step back, and that time for me is now.&quot; Dunderdale said that Finance Minister Tom Marshall would succeed her as premier and become interim leader of the Progressive Conservatives while the party held a leadership convention to find a permanent successor.

===Marshall era (2014)===
Marshall was sworn in as the 11th Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador on 24 January 2014. During Marshall&#x27;s eight months as premier he reversed several controversial decisions the government made while Dunderdale was premier. Five days after being sworn in Marshall announced that he would be striking a committee to review the province&#x27;s access to information laws due to the backlash the government had received since Bill 29 was adopted in June 2012. He later announced an &quot;Open Government Initiative&quot; to share more data and information online.

In March 2014, Marshall announced his government would also establish an oversight committee for the Muskrat Falls project. The committee would be made up of senior bureaucrats and would release quarterly updates on the project to the public. During the Spring sitting of the legislature his government passed whistleblower legislation to protect public sector employees.. Whistleblower legislation was promised during the 2007 election but the government repeatedly delayed enacting it under both Williams and Dunderdale.

Marshall also announced that a new hospital to be built in Corner Brook would provide cancer treatment. The government had previously said the population of the region did not warrant radiation therapy or a Positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. Following Marshall&#x27;s announcement that both would be part of the new hospital he shuffled Susan Sullivan out of the Health portfolio. Sullivan, who had defended the decision to not offer the services, was replaced by Paul Davis.

On 2 September 2014, Marshall and Finance Minister Charlene Johnson held a news conference with multiple union leaders to announce that they had negotiated a deal to reform pension plans for the majority of public sector employees. The government had spoken of the need to reform pension plans for years. As of 31 March 2014, the pension liabilities and other post-retirement benefits made up 74% of Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s $9.8 billion net debt. Reforms to the plan included increased contributions by employers and government beginning 1 January 2015, over five years the retirement age will increase to 58 and employees will need to 10 years of service to qualify for a pension rather than five years. The unions and government will jointly manage the fund with the creation of a new corporation and it is expected the plans will be fully funded within 30 years.

While polling showed a significant increase in government satisfaction and high approval ratings for Marshall, the Progressive Conservative Party was unable to regain the support it had lost during Dunderdale&#x27;s tenure as premier. A CRA poll conducted throughout August 2014, showed that 62% of those polled were satisfied with the government&#x27;s performance under Marshall. This number was consistent with other polls conducted by CRA during Marshall&#x27;s time as premier. An Angus Reid Global poll ranking the popularity of Canadian premiers placed Marshall as the third most popular premier in the country, with a 59% approval rating. CRA placed support for the PC Party at 33% in February 2014—a four-point increase since November 2013—but support fell over the next two quarters. The party&#x27;s support fell to 29% in May and fell again to 26% in August.

===Paul Davis (2014–2015)===
Davis was sworn in as the 12th Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador on 26 September 2014. It is believed that Davis is the first premier in Canadian history to have previously worked as a Police Officer.

At the swearing in ceremony for his cabinet on 30 September 2014, Davis announced that the Department of Justice would now be titled the Department of Public Safety and that the Fire and Emergency Services portfolio would now fall under the department. In a surprise move Davis announced that St. John&#x27;s lawyer Judy Manning would serve as the department&#x27;s new minister, despite not being an elected member of the House of Assembly. Davis received criticism for dropping justice from the department&#x27;s name as well as the appointment of Manning, due to her being unelected and not willing to seek a seat in the House of Assembly until the next election. Representative from the provincial branch of the Canadian Bar Association met with Davis on 10 October 2014, to question him on why the former Department of Justice was replaced with the Department of Public Safety. Following the meeting Davis announced the department would be renamed the Department of Justice and Public Safety.

On 15 January 2015, Davis announced that the House of Assembly would be opening the following week so that his government could bring forth legislation to reduce the number of electoral districts in the province by 8. Under the province&#x27;s current legislation a committee was supposed to be set up in 2016 to review electoral boundaries. Davis announced he was speeding up the process in order to reduce the number of districts before the next election, which is supposed to be called by September 2015. Previously there were 48 electoral districts in the province. His government expects that by reducing the number to 40 the government will save $10 million over four years. Along with reducing the number of electoral districts, the Davis government will also review MHA pension plans and identify measures to increase the participation of elected members in the House of Assembly.

On 29 April 2015, Davis along with his Minister of Health and Community Services and Minister of Seniors, Wellness and Social Development announced a plan to partner with private and non-profit providers to create 360 long-term care beds throughout the island portion of the province. A private or non-profit provider would construct and operate new long-term care facilities and the provincial government would pay a per-bed fee. The Davis government hired Partnerships BC - a crown corporation in British Columbia specializing in public private partnerships - to facilitate between government and the potential providers. The move was condemned by the public sector unions who called the move an attack on their workers.

On 22 October 2015, Davis announced the Downpayment Assistance Program, to be administered by the Newfoundland and Labrador Housing Corporation. The program was a two-year pilot project which provided downpayment loans to first-time homebuyers who have low-to-moderate incomes. Applicants must have a household income of $65,000 or less. The downpayment loans range from between $4,500 and $12,500 and successful applicants will not have to begin repaying their loans until five years after the purchase of their home.

===Opposition (2015–present)===
:&quot;See: 2018 Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador leadership election2023 Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador leadership election&quot;

Following the 2015 provincial election, the Progressive Conservative Party was reduced to only 7 seats after previously controlling the government since 2003. In 2016, Paul Davis announced his resignation following the election of a new leader. On 28 April 2018 lawyer Ches Crosbie defeated Health Authority CEO Tony Wakeham to succeed outgoing leader Paul Davis. The leadership convention operated under a mixed vote-points system in which a hundred points were awarded in each of the 40 districts across the province, based on the percentage of vote each candidate won. The final tally was Crosbie with 2,298.92 and Wakeham with 1,701.08 points respectively. Following the election of Crosbie as leader in April 2018, Davis announced he would resign as Leader of the Opposition. Since Crosbie does not have a seat in the House of Assembly, MHA David Brazil was appointed Leader of the Opposition on 14 May 2018. On 20 September 2018 Crosbie won the district of Windsor Lake in a by-election, therefore becoming Leader of the Opposition. In November 2018, Davis resigned as MHA.

Crosbie led the party into the 2019 provincial election with the party increasing its seat count from 7 to 15. The PCs finished 1% behind the Liberals in the popular vote and the Ball government was reduced to a minority. 

Crosbie led the party into the 2021 provincial election. He was personally defeated in his district of Windsor Lake; while the party lost one other seat, electing 13 MHAs. The Liberals under Furey won a majority government. On 31 March 2021, Crosbie resigned as leader and MHA David Brazil was appointed interim Leader and interim Leader of the Opposition. On October 14, 2023, MHA Tony Wakeham was elected leader. On November 10, 2023, David Brazil announced his resignation as MHA effective December 29, 2023. On January 30, 2024, Liberal candidate Fred Hutton was elected in the Conception Bay East - Bell Island by-election, gaining the seat from the Progressive Conservatives. On April 15, 2024, the Fogo Island-Cape Freels by-election was held. Progressive Conservative candidate Jim McKenna was elected, gaining the seat from the Liberals. On May 27, 2024, Progressive Conservative candidate Lin Paddock was elected in the Baie Verte-Green Bay by-election, gaining the seat from the Liberals. On July 16, 2024, MHA Lela Evans rejoined the PC Party.

==Ideologies and policies==
The Progressive Conservative Party is a political party which is made up of two dominant factions: social democrats and liberal conservatives. The leadership of the party has tended to be dominated by centrists or proponents of the Third Way throughout the party&#x27;s history. Party leaders Brian Peckford, Tom Rideout, and Lynn Verge were all seen as being part of the Red Tory base of the party, while their main challengers in at the leadership conventions, Bill Doody, Len Simms, and Loyola Sullivan, were considered to be further to the right. Danny Williams has stated that he considers the PC Party to be a grouping of Red Tories whose social and fiscal viewpoints are softer than those of the federal Conservative Party that was formed in 2003.

During the Constitutional negotiations of the 1980s, the Tories supported a decentralized federation, while the Liberals were in favour of a strong central government. The Tories lost power in 1989 but continued to argue for decentralization in opposition, voting in favour of a package of proposed constitutional amendments called the Meech Lake Accord, while the Liberal Party led by Clyde Wells opposed it.

==Federal affiliation==
The party still recognizes select ex-officio representation at its annual General meetings from the Conservative Party of Canada (and the legacy federal PC Party before the merger of the federal PC and CA Parties in 2003). While there is some overlap in support federally and provincially, there have been periods of tension and distance.

Under Premier Williams, the party&#x27;s relationship with federal Conservatives, led by Stephen Harper, was often tenuous. After Harper reneged on a promise made to Williams during the 2006 federal election, regarding equalization payments, Williams launched the Anything But Conservative (ABC) campaign. The ABC campaign encouraged people to vote for any other party but the Conservatives, with a goal of making sure no Conservative was elected in the next federal election in Newfoundland and Labrador. The campaign, which was supported by all but one member of Williams&#x27; caucus, crippled the federal party&#x27;s ability to find candidates and volunteers. On election night the campaign was successful, the Conservative Party lost the three seats they had held prior to the election, and won only 17% of the popular vote in the province. Despite being shut out of Newfoundland and Labrador the Conservatives did manage to win a second minority government. Following the election Williams announced that it was time to end his battle with Ottawa, and both he and Harper signaled a willingness to work with each other.

When Dunderdale succeeded Williams as Premier, she worked to build a stronger relationship between the province and Harper&#x27;s Conservative government. At the beginning of the May 2011 federal election campaign, Dunderdale gave the green light to members of her caucus to campaign with the federal Conservative Party. At a campaign stop in St. John&#x27;s, Dunderdale, along with the majority of her caucus, endorsed the Conservative Party. After having difficulty attracting candidates in 2008, the Conservatives ran three former provincial cabinet ministers who served under Williams. Despite the support from the provincial party the Conservatives were unable to get back to their traditional level of support, they elected one MP and increased their popular vote to 28%. During a 2017 visit to St. John&#x27;s, federal Conservative leader Andrew Scheer met with then-PC leader Paul Davis. In 2018, Scheer visited St. John&#x27;s during the Regatta celebration and met with PC leader Ches Crosbie.

<text>Rendang is a spicy Minangkabau meat dish originating from the highlands region in west of the Sumatra island in Indonesia. It has spread across other islands in Indonesia to the cuisines of neighbouring Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and the Philippines.

Rendang is often described by Westerners as a rich &quot;curry&quot; made by stewing meat in coconut milk and spices until it becomes tender; but the dish is usually not considered as such in Indonesia and Malaysia since it is richer and contains less liquid than is normal for curries known in these countries. Rendang is a piece of meat — most commonly beef (&quot;rendang daging&quot;) — that has been slow cooked and braised in a coconut milk and spice mixture, well until the liquids evaporate and the meat turns dark brown and tender, becoming caramelized and infused with rich spices. As the signature dish of Minangkabau culture, rendang is traditionally served at ceremonial occasions to honour guests during festive events; such as wedding feasts and Eid al-Fitr also known as &quot;Hari Raya&quot; or &quot;Lebaran&quot;. Rendang is also traditionally served among the Malay community in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, as well as the Maguindanaon and Maranao in the Philippines. 

In Indonesia, 6 different traditions of preparing rendang have been granted intangible cultural heritage status by the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture, all included under the heritage of West Sumatra province. In 2010, &quot;Randang&quot; (the Minang spelling of &quot;Rendang&quot;), and &quot;gulai rendang&quot; (rendang served with more coconut-milk based liquid) were granted cultural heritage status, followed by &quot;Randang daging&quot; (meat rendang), &quot;randang kantang&quot; (potato rendang), and &quot;randang incek kacang&quot; (rendang with beans) in 2016, while &quot;rendang paku&quot; of Dharmasraya (rendang prepared with the leaves of a fern (&quot;Diplazium esculentum&quot;)) received the same status in 2018.

In 2011, an online poll of 35,000 people by CNN International nominated beef rendang as the No. 1 World&#x27;s most delicious dish in their &quot;World&#x27;s 50 most delicious foods: Readers&#x27; picks&quot; list (even though it was No. 11 on the original list produced by the staff). In 2018, &quot;rendang&quot; was officially recognised as being one of the 5 national dishes of Indonesia; the others are soto, sate, nasi goreng, and gado-gado.

==History==

The origin of rendang could be traced back to the Indian merchants links to West Sumatra before the 15th century. Due to regular contacts between India and West Sumatra since the early second millennium, there are possibilities that north Indian curry was the precursor of rendang. Indian curry was adopted by the Minangkabau people as gulai, a local version of curry. Minangkabau people then cooked this gulai further in order to prepare kalio also known as wet rendang. This cooking process was then continued until it thickened and became rendang or also known as dry rendang.

Originating in the Sumatran Minangkabau region, the making of rendang spreads from Minangkabau highlands to Mandailing, Riau, Jambi, across the strait to Malacca and Negeri Sembilan, resulting in a variety of rendang traditions. Andalas University historian, Prof. Gusti Asnan suggests that rendang began to spread across the region when Minangkabau merchants began to trade and migrate to Malacca in the 16th century, &quot;Because the journey through the river waterways in Sumatra took much time, a durable preserved dry rendang is suitable for a long journey.&quot; The dried Padang rendang is a durable food, good to consume for weeks, even when left at room temperature. One of the earliest written records of rendang is from the Malaccan Malay manuscript of Hikayat Amir Hamzah, which date back to the 1550s.

During the Indonesian National Revolution in 1946, the Indonesian First Lady Fatmawati, the wife of Sukarno, cooked and sent rendang to boost the morale of Indonesian republic freedom fighters around Yogyakarta. Declined by household helps, she insisted on buying beef and went to the market herself by &quot;becak,&quot; despite being pregnant at the time.

The popularity of rendang has spread widely from its original domain because of the &quot;marantau&quot; (migrating) culture of Minangkabau people. In the modern era, Overseas Minangkabau leave their hometown to start a career in other Indonesian cities as well as neighboring countries, and Padang restaurants, Minangkabau eating establishments that are ubiquitous in Indonesian cities, spring up. These Padang restaurants have introduced and popularized Minangkabau style rendang and other Padang food dishes across Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the wider world.

==Cultural significance==
Rendang is revered in Minangkabau culture as an embodiment of the philosophy of &quot;musyawarah&quot;, discussion and consultation with elders. It has been claimed that the four main ingredients represent Minangkabau society as a whole:
# The meat (&quot;daging&quot;) symbolises the &quot;Niniak Mamak&quot;, the traditional clan leaders such as the &quot;datuk&quot;, the nobles, royalty, and revered elders.
# The coconut milk (&quot;karambia&quot;) symbolises the &quot;Cadiak Pandai&quot;, intellectuals, teachers, poets, and writers.
# The chilli (&quot;lado&quot;) symbolises the &quot;Alim Ulama&quot;, clerics, &quot;ulama&quot; and religious leaders. The hotness of the chilli symbolises Sharia.
# The spice mixture (&quot;pemasak&quot;) symbolises the rest of Minangkabau society.
In Minangkabau tradition, rendang is a requisite dish for special occasions in traditional Minang ceremonies, from birth ceremonies to circumcision, marriage, Qur&#x27;an recitals, and religious festivals such as Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.

In 2011, rendang placed 11th place on a list of World&#x27;s 50 best foods published by CNN International. An online reader&#x27;s poll of 35,000 voters chose beef rendang as the top dish on CNN International&#x27;s &quot;Readers&#x27; picks&quot; list.

The Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture have included six rendang preparations under its National Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indonesia list, all of which are registered under West Sumatra: &quot;Randang&quot; (Minang spelling), and &quot;gulai rendang&quot;, were part of the inaugural list in 2010. They were joined by &quot;randang daging&quot; (meat rendang), &quot;randang kantang&quot; (potato rendang), and &quot;randang incek kacang&quot;, in 2016. &quot;Rendang paku&quot; (fern rendang) of Dharmasraya, is the most recent addition as of 2018.

In 2018, rendang was officially recognised by the Indonesian government as one of the country&#x27;s five national dishes: the others are soto, sate, nasi goreng, and gado-gado.

==Composition and cooking method==

Rendang is most often described as meat slow-cooked in coconut milk and spices until it becomes tender. If cooked properly, dry rendang can last for as long as four weeks. Prior to refrigeration technology, this style of cooking enabled preservation of the large amount of meat. The cooking technique flourished because of its role in preserving meat in a tropical climate. Its durability is one of the reasons that today, prepackaged rendang is sent as food aid relief for natural disaster survivors in Indonesia. The cut of beef suitable for rendang is lean meat of the rear leg of the cattle; i.e. topside or round beef, which is considered perfect for slow cooking.

Rendang is rich in spices. Along with the main meat ingredient, rendang uses coconut milk and a paste of mixed ground spices, including ginger, galangal, turmeric leaves, lemongrass, garlic, shallots, chillis and other spices. This spice mixture is called &quot;pemasak&quot; in Minangkabau. The spices, garlic, shallot, ginger and galangal used in rendang have antimicrobial properties and serve as natural organic preservatives. Although some culinary experts describe rendang as a curry, the dish is usually not considered as such in Indonesia or Malaysia since it is richer and contains less liquid than is normal for curries.

Traditionally the term &quot;rendang&quot; does not refer to a certain type of dish. The verb &quot;merendang&quot; actually refers to a method of slow cooking; continuously churning the ingredients in a pot or frying pan, on a small fire, until all of the liquids evaporate and the meat is well done. Traditional Padang rendang takes hours to cook. Cooking rendang involves pounding and grinding ingredients as well as slow cooking, and so is time-consuming and requires patience. The meat pieces are slowly cooked in coconut milk and spices until almost all the liquid is gone, allowing the meat to become tender and absorb the condiments. The cooking process changes from boiling to frying, as the liquid evaporates and the coconut milk turns to coconut oil. Cooking the meat until tender with almost all the liquid evaporated requires great care, keeping it from getting burnt. Because of its generous use of numerous spices, rendang is known for having a complex and unique taste.

Rendang is often served with steamed rice, &quot;ketupat&quot; (a compressed rice cake) or &quot;lemang&quot; (glutinous rice cooked in bamboo tubes), accompanied with vegetable side dishes such as boiled cassava leaf, &quot;cubadak&quot; (young jackfruit &quot;gulai&quot;), cabbage &quot;gulai&quot; and &quot;lado&quot; (red or green chilli pepper sambal).

==Types==
In Minangkabau culinary tradition, there are three recognised stages in cooking meat in spicy coconut milk. The dish which results is categorised according to the liquid content of the cooked coconut milk, which ranges from the most wet and soupy to the most dry: &quot;Gulai — Kalio – Rendang&quot;. The ingredients of &quot;gulai&quot;, &quot;kalio&quot; and rendang are almost identical with the exceptions that &quot;gulai&quot; usually has less red chilli pepper and more turmeric, while rendang has richer spices.

If pieces of meat are cooked in spicy coconut milk and the process stopped right when the meat is done and the coconut milk has reached its boiling point, the dish is called &quot;gulai&quot;. If the process continues until the coconut milk is partly evaporated and the meat has started to brown, the dish is called &quot;kalio&quot;. For traditional dry rendang, the process continues hours beyond this, until the liquid has all but completely evaporated and the color turns to a dark brown, almost black color. Thus not only liquid content but also color indicate which type of rendang is involved: &quot;gulai&quot; is light yellow, &quot;kalio&quot; is brown and rendang is very dark brown. Today, one mostly finds only two simpler categories of rendang: either dry or wet.

According to Minangkabau tradition, their true rendang is the dry one. Although, unlike crispy &quot;dendeng balado&quot; spicy jerky, rendang&#x27;s texture is not actually dry, since it is quite moist and rather oily. Rendang is diligently stirred, attended, and cooked for hours until the coconut milk has evaporated, turned into coconut oil, and the meat has absorbed the spices. It is still served for special ceremonial occasions or to honor guests. If cooked properly, dried rendang can last for three to four weeks stored at room temperature and is still good to consume. It can even last months stored in a refrigerator, and up to six months if frozen.

===Wet rendang or &quot;kalio&quot;===
Wet rendang, more accurately identified as &quot;kalio&quot;, is a type of rendang that is cooked for a shorter period of time and much of the coconut milk liquid has not evaporated. &quot;Kalio&quot; has quite abundant liquid sauce acquired from cooked coconut milk that partly has turned into spicy oil, which is quite flavourful if consumed with steamed rice. Much of rendang served abroad is actually more akin to &quot;kalio&quot; or wet version of rendang. If stored at room temperature, &quot;kalio&quot; lasts less than a week. &quot;Kalio&quot; usually has a light golden brown colour, paler than dry rendang.

==Variations==
Rendang is made from beef (or occasionally beef liver, chicken, duck, mutton, water buffalo, or vegetables like jackfruit or cassava). Chicken or duck rendang also contains tamarind and is usually not cooked for as long as beef rendang.

The original Minangkabau rendang has two categories, &quot;rendang darek&quot; and &quot;rendang pesisir&quot;. &quot;Rendang darek&quot; (‘land rendang’) is an umbrella term for dishes from old regions in mountainous areas of the Minangkabau Highlands such as Batusangkar, Agam, Lima Puluh Kota, Payakumbuh, Padang Panjang and Bukittinggi. It mainly consists of beef, offal, poultry products, jackfruit, and many other vegetables and animal products which are found in these places. &quot;Rendang pesisir&quot; (‘coastal rendang’) is from the coastal regions of Minangkabau such as Pariaman, Padang, Painan and Pasaman. &quot;Rendang pesisir&quot; mainly consists of seafood, although it is not unusual for them to incorporate beef or water buffalo meat in their rendang.

== Rendang outside West Sumatra ==
=== In Indonesia ===
Today, rendang is quite widespread in Indonesia, owned mainly by the proliferation of Padang restaurants in the country, which led to popularity and adoption of rendang
into the kitchens of contemporary Indonesian households of various ethnic backgrounds. This might led to development of variants with slightly altered tastes to accommodate regional preferences. Other ethnic groups in Indonesia also have adopted a version of rendang into their daily diet. For example, in Java, the rendang—aside from the Padang variety sold in Padang restaurants—tend to be wet, slightly sweeter and less spicy to accommodate Javanese tastes.

Rendang variations outside by the Minangkabau: 
# &quot;Rendang kelinci&quot;: rabbit meat rendang, popular in Aceh.
# &quot;Rendang babi&quot;: pork rendang, the adaptation of rendang by non-Muslim population of Indonesia. Usually consumed in Christian-majority Batak region of North Sumatra and Hindu-majority island of Bali. In Bali, the popularity of rendang has led to this adaptation, since some Balinese Hindus do not consume beef.
# &quot;Rendang jawa&quot;: Javanese adoption of Minang rendang, which is more soft and moist suited to Javanese taste, usually rather sweet and less spicy compared to Sumatran rendang.

Outside of Indonesia, rendang is also known in Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, southern Thailand, and the southern Philippines as well as in the Netherlands, Australia, Taiwan, Belgium, and New Zealand.

===In the Netherlands===
The Dutch are familiar with rendang through colonial ties and often serve the wet &quot;kalio&quot; version in the Netherlands—usually as part of a &quot;rijsttafel&quot;. Indonesian dishes, including rendang, are served in numbers of Indonesian restaurants in Dutch cities, especially The Hague, Utrecht, Rotterdam and Amsterdam.

===In the Philippines===
In the Philippines, rendang is most commonly associated with the cuisine of the Muslim Maranao people of Mindanao. It differs from the Indonesian versions in the use of the native spice mix &quot;palapa&quot; as well as the addition of &quot;muscovado&quot; sugar.

==Fusion rendang==

Rendang &quot;bumbu&quot; is sometimes used as the base of other fusion dishes. Some chefs in Indonesian sushi establishments for example, have developed a Japanese-Indonesian fusion cuisine with recipes for krakatau roll, gado-gado roll, rendang roll and gulai ramen. Several chefs and food industries have experimented with fusing rendang with sandwiches, burgers and spaghetti. Burger King at one time served their take on a rendang-flavoured burger in their Singapore and Indonesia chains for a limited promotion period. Spaghetti with rendang could also be found in 7-Eleven convenience stores across Indonesia.

Rendang is also a popular flavour in Indonesian instant noodle variants, such as the &quot;Indomie Goreng Rendang&quot;.

Most recently, there were Taiwanese baozis with rendang fillings sold at Neo Soho Mall in West Jakarta.

<text>KeyBank Center is a multipurpose indoor arena located in Buffalo, New York, United States. Originally known as Marine Midland Arena, the venue has since been named HSBC Arena and First Niagara Center. Home to the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League (NHL) since 1996, is the largest indoor arena in Western New York, seating 19,070. It replaced the Sabres&#x27; former home, Buffalo Memorial Auditorium, where the team played from 1970 to 1996. The venue is also home to the Buffalo Bandits of the National Lacrosse League.

KeyBank Center was previously home to the Canisius Golden Griffins (NCAA), Buffalo Blizzard (NPSL), Buffalo Wings (RHI) and Buffalo Destroyers (AFL).
In addition to concerts and professional wrestling, the venue has hosted major events including the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, 1999 Stanley Cup Finals, 2003 Frozen Four, 2011 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, 2012 NLL All-Star Game, 2016 NHL Draft, UFC 210, 2018 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships and 2019 Frozen Four.

==History==

===Planning and construction===
What was originally known during construction as Crossroads Arena opened September 21, 1996, replacing Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. The construction cost was $127.5 million, (approximately $ in dollars).

The venue was named after its central downtown location, which was originally proposed as the site of a domed stadium in the 1960s for the Buffalo Bills and a potential Major League Baseball team before that project was abandoned.

===Opening and reception===
On November 16, 1996, the arena&#x27;s first JumboTron, an eight-sided scoreboard made by Daktronics with Sony video screens, fell to the ice while it was being remotely moved. This happened minutes after a few players ended practice and hours before a game between the Buffalo Sabres and Boston Bruins. Nobody was injured, but the game was postponed. The scoreboard was replaced later that season.

===Alterations===

The first update to the arena took place after the conclusion of the 1998-1999 hockey season. 95 seats were added behind the last row of the 300 level, raising the arena&#x27;s hockey and lacrosse capacity from 18,595 to 18,690.

The second update to the arena took place in 2002–2003, when the Sabres replaced matrix board on the face of the second bowl with a LED ribbon. The original seamless glass boards were also removed, and replaced with boards with clear plastic stanchions, which gave when players were hit into them.

The third update to the arena took place prior to the 2007–2008 season. Two illuminated Sabres logos were added in the upper level of the pavilion on both sides of the Sports Headlines bar. Also, new LED ribbon boards were installed in the arena seating bowl in conjunction with the new HD scoreboard manufactured by Daktronics. In addition, the four main speaker racks were removed and replaced and two additional speaker racks were added. The new scoreboard features four large HD video screens, surrounded by two 360-degree LED ribbon boards. The bottom of the board features large Buffalo Sabres logos with giant sabres crossed behind them. The handles of the sabres are lit with blue LEDs. The Sabres logos shoot smoke out of the Buffalo&#x27;s nostrils every time a Sabres goal is scored or when the Sabres win at home. Later in 2008, a mural was installed in the lower pavilion near the main entrance, containing pictures from the 2008 NHL Winter Classic held at Ralph Wilson Stadium, now known as Highmark Stadium, in nearby Orchard Park.

The fourth update took place during the summer and early fall of 2011. The major renovation included the demolition and installation of brand new locker rooms, decor and concession updates as well as fan enhancements. This $6 million locker room project led by Cannon Design of Grand Island saw an expansion from in size. The new Sabres locker room is designed as a circular room, complete with illuminated team logos on the floor and ceiling. Additional new facilities include a state of the art fitness center, new coaching offices, film rooms where players and coaches can watch previous games, and a players lounge with a kitchen and team chef. Also, the new Sabres locker room features a Wall of Fame featuring team history, the names and numbers of retired team jerseys. Limestones that were salvaged from the former Buffalo Memorial Auditorium are surrounded by glass, which features the names of all team players throughout franchise existence. Visiting team locker rooms were also expanded from . Finally, a new post-game interview room was also built. In addition to the new locker rooms and training facilities, the public spaces within the arena were also upgraded.

Also as part of the update, the arena took on the Sabres Blue and Gold color scheme inside the arena bowl. It replaced the red color used on the team logo from 1996 to 2006. The previous Sabres logo (known infamously as the &quot;Buffaslug&quot;, and used from 2006 to 2010) was removed from the scoreboard and replaced with the current logo. All of the original TV sets were replaced with new HDTVs. New food choices were added as part of the upgraded concessions. Signage was replaced or upgraded where needed. Restrooms saw cup holders and HDTVs added for fan convenience. Also, new chimes were added, which sound two minutes prior to the opening faceoff each period. This lets fans know to head towards the seating areas. Finally, the Sports Headlines bar has now been replaced by the Labatt Blue Zone.

The ice rink itself also saw a multimillion-dollar upgrade with adding a new dehumidifier system and cooling tower. All of the Zamboni machines were replaced and upgraded to feature laser beam leveling. These upgrades improve the quality of the ice surface. Outside, a new LED ribbon board was added to the entrance pavilion which can display upcoming events, scores, and team information, though it was subsequently removed to make way for the construction of a new pedestrian bridge to the adjacent LECOM Harborcenter complex in 2014.

The fifth update features the creation of the Tops Markets Alumni Plaza. In July 2012, the space located between the arena&#x27;s entrance pavilion and the parking ramp saw the concrete bridge columns covered with brick. All of the team members that the Buffalo Sabres have had throughout existence are now featured on plaques that are mounted to the bricks. In addition, fans of the Sabres are able to purchase custom plaques that will be featured alongside the team members. Alumni Plaza&#x27;s centerpiece is a 10&#x27; high bronze statue of The French Connection. These renovations were completed in October 2012.

The sixth update included multiple changes, including modifying the entrance pavilion due to the LECOM Harborcenter construction. That building is attached to the arena by an elevated walkway. LECOM Harborcenter is a mid-rise building with 2 hockey rinks, a Marriott hotel, retail space, IMPACT Training facility, restaurants including 716 Food and Sport and flagship Tim Hortons and a parking garage. Construction began in early 2013, while the restaurants and rinks opened in late October 2014. The elevated walkway connecting the KeyBank Center and LECOM Harborcenter buildings was completed and opened in early 2015, while the Marriott hotel opened in the summer of 2015. Also, after the 2011-12 Buffalo Sabres season, the Sabres added 380 seats, mainly as an additional row in the 200 level, to raise the arena&#x27;s capacity to 19,070. This number is symbolic of the team&#x27;s founding in 1970. In 2013, the Buffalo Sabres announced that all 80 luxury suites would be renovated over a 3-year period. All suites will now feature the Sabres Blue and Gold color scheme, 50&quot; TVs, new carpeting, new furniture and gathering islands. Construction began on this project in July 2013.

The seventh update took place during the summer of 2016 on the exterior due to the renaming from First Niagara Center to KeyBank Center. The entrance canopies that featured hockey images were replaced. New exterior signage was installed during the week of August 11, 2016 and KeyBank debuted the rebranded arena on September 19, 2016. Also, a new LED lighting system was installed by Ephesus. This allows the arena to provide better lighting while significantly reducing the number of light fixtures needed and reducing energy consumption.

The arena’s main scoreboard and roof are both being replaced in the spring/summer of 2024.

===Naming rights===

Naming rights were sold to Marine Midland Bank, part of the HSBC banking group in 1996, and the building was renamed Marine Midland Arena before the first game had been played. The bank bought the naming rights for 30 years then to expire in 2026. 

In 1999, as part of HSBC&#x27;s worldwide corporate rebranding, the arena&#x27;s name was changed to HSBC Arena, with the official renaming taking place on March 17, 2000. This name change coincided with the playing of the first college basketball tournament game in the arena&#x27;s history. 

In 2011, Buffalo-based First Niagara Financial Group reached an agreement to purchase HSBC Bank&#x27;s upstate New York and Connecticut branch network, including much of the core of the old Marine Midland. While naming rights to HSBC Arena were not included in the sale, First Niagara, HSBC, the Buffalo Sabres and other parties reached an agreement to establish a new naming rights deal with First Niagara. The name of the arena became First Niagara Center that summer, with the official renaming taking place that fall. First Niagara bought the naming rights for 15 years, approximately the remainder of the time that was left on HSBC&#x27;s naming rights deal with the arena.

KeyCorp announced its plans to purchase First Niagara—and thus also the naming rights to the arena—on October 30, 2015. Although exterior signage was installed during the week of August 11, 2016, the renamed KeyBank Center became official on September 19, 2016.

<doc id="496828" wikidata="Q2697347" url="?curid=496828" title="Plestiodon laticeps">
<text>The broad-headed skink or broadhead skink (Plestiodon laticeps) is species of lizard, endemic to the southeastern United States. The broadhead skink occurs in sympatry with the five-lined skink (&quot;Plestiodon fasciatus&quot;) and Southeastern five-lined skink (&quot;Plestiodon inexpectatus&quot;) in forest of the Southeastern United States. All three species are phenotypically similar throughout much of their development and were considered a single species prior to the mid-1930s.

==Description==
Together with the Great Plains skink it is the largest of the &quot;&quot;Plestiodon&quot; skinks&quot;, growing from a total length of to nearly .
The broad-headed skink gets its name from the wide jaws, giving the head a triangular appearance. Adult males are brown or olive brown in color and have bright orange heads during the mating season in spring. Females have five light stripes running down the back and the tail, similar to the Five-lined Skink. However, they can be distinguished by having five labial scales around the mouth, whereas Five-lined skinks have only four. Juveniles are dark brown or black and also striped and have blue tails.

==Habitat==
Broad-headed skinks are semi-arboreal lizards that are strongly associated with live oak trees. It does not appear that the lizards have a preference for tree size, rather they prefer trees with holes. Juveniles stay closer to the ground on low or fallen branches. Males have been known to guard preferred trees that are surrounded with dense brushes to limit attack by predators and harbor prey. Dead and decaying trees are important habitat resources for nesting. Fallen logs are also essential because during the winter following the breeding season it is seen that In &quot;Eumeces laticepts&quot; small groups gather in hibernacula under the ground or in rotting logs. The occurrence of the species was seen to correlate with the presence of Black Walnut (&quot;Juglans nigra&quot;).

==Behavior==
Broad-headed skinks are the most arboreal of the North American &quot;Plestiodon&quot;. They forage on the ground, but also easily and often climb trees for shelter, to sleep, or to search for food. Broad-headed skinks often feed on what are called &quot;hidden prey&quot;; prey items that can only be located by searching under debris, soil or litter.
Broad-headed skinks are preyed on by a variety of organisms including carnivorous birds, larger reptiles, and mammals. Skinks prefer to flee by climbing a nearby tree or seeking shelter under foliage. These skinks exhibit tail autotomy when caught by a predator. The tails break away and continue to move, distracting the predator and allowing the skink to flee. This species is capable of detecting integumentary chemical stimuli from two species of snakes that are sympatric predators of lizards. Typically, females will flee before males do when found in pairs. Males during the breeding season tend to stand their ground, likely due to the possibility of losing a mate. Broad-headed Skinks rely on coloration and directional stimuli to determine which end of their prey item to attack. When consuming large invertebrates, they often carry them to shelter to avoid being preyed upon during the prey handling time.

== Diet ==
Broad-headed skinks consume a wide variety of different organisms, but mostly consume insects, insect larvae, gastropods, and spiders. They are diurnal (daytime) feeders, and will actively hunt their prey (i.e. other organisms that are active at the time they are). Their diet consists of what is available at the time of day they are feeding. Broad-headed skinks have been documented consuming &quot;Anolis&quot; lizards, as well as cannibalizing juvenile Broad-headed skinks. Their larger body size allows for them to consume a wider range of prey. They are very opportunistic hunters, and they use strategy to determine the desirability of their prey. They have been seen avoiding predators and dismissing food when too dangerous. Smaller prey is easier to grab, and they can eat it right away, whereas larger prey takes longer and might put you at risk of being predated on. Because handling time increases with prey size, larger prey are not necessarily the most profitable.

==Reproduction==
Males typically are larger than females. Large males guard females during breeding season using aggressive behavior with other males, and remain in pairs for long periods of time for foraging, basking, and mating. The larger the female, the more eggs she will lay. Males thus often try to mate with the largest female they can find, and they sometimes engage in severe fights with other males over access to a female. Large adult males in South Carolina will guard females within their territories and chase away smaller males. Females will also mate with the largest males they can find, a result of the Good Genes Hypothesis. Females only have a preference on body size of males when reproducing, they tend to look over the more dominant feature of bright orange heads on this species. Females emit a pheromone from glands in the base of the tail when they are sexually receptive and males can find them by tracking their chemical trails through tongue-flicking. Males show higher tongue flicking rates when exposed to conspecific females verses heterospecific females when mating and will terminate behavioral interaction without initiating courtship if the pheromones do not match the species. Males can get particularly aggressive during mating season and even display mate guarding. Mate guarding thus lasts through a major portion of the mating season, which appears to be limited to about two weeks. Mate guarding can be costly, many suffer injuries and fatality at the hands of guarding their female. The female lays between 8 and 22 eggs, which she guards and protects until they hatch in June or July. Female broadhead skinks will lay their clutch in decaying log cavities, and they have been observed to create a sort of nest by packing down debris within their cavities. The hatchlings have a total length of to .

==Geographic range==
Broad-headed skinks are widely distributed in the southeastern states of the United States, from the East Coast to Kansas and eastern Texas and from Ohio to the Gulf Coast.

==Nonvenomous==
These skinks (along with the similar &quot;Plestiodon fasciatus&quot;) are sometimes wrongly thought to be venomous. Broad-headed skinks are nonvenomous.

<text>The prime minister of Myanmar () is the head of government of Myanmar. The post was re-established in 2021 by the State Administration Council (SAC), the country&#x27;s ruling military junta, to lead its nominally-civilian provisional government. The provisional government is subject to the decision-making of the SAC; additionally, there is significant overlap in the membership of both bodies. There is no provision for a prime minister in the 2008 Constitution of Myanmar, with the president being the constitutional head of government. The current prime minister is Min Aung Hlaing, who is also the leader of the junta and the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services. The post had been used by previous military governments, as recently as 2011.

==History of the office==

The position of prime minister was created in 1948, with the adoption of the Burmese Declaration of Independence from the United Kingdom. Since then, eleven people have held the office (with two of them doing so on multiple occasions). Due to the country&#x27;s long period of military rule, it has not been uncommon for the prime minister to be a serving (or recently retired) military officer.

The actual power of the prime minister has considerably varied over time, differing based on who holds the office. In 2004, a power struggle between the then–head of state, Senior General Than Shwe, chairman of the State Peace and Development Council, and his prime minister, General Khin Nyunt, led to his dismissal and arrest.

The position was abolished on 30 March 2011, according to the current Constitution (adopted in 2008). It provided that the president is both the head of state and head of government. But after the 2015 general election, as Aung San Suu Kyi was constitutionally barred from becoming President, an office named State Counsellor, functionally identical to that of prime minister, was established for her on 6 April 2016.

On 1 August 2021, State Administration Council formed the caretaker government and chairman of SAC became prime minister.

<text>Chance is a 2002 film, the directing debut of actress Amber Benson. Benson directed, wrote, produced and starred in this film. Many of Benson&#x27;s co-stars from the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; appeared in the film. It was estimated to cost $25,000.

As documented on &quot;Chance&quot;&#x27;s official site, the cost of making the film ended up being more than triple the estimate. Though Benson originally thought that she would foot the bill herself, she decided to ask fans for support. Signed photos of Benson on the set of the film, as well as scripts and props, were sold to raise money.

Benson&#x27;s production company, Benson Entertainment, distributes the movie on DVD and video.

==Plot==
Chance is a twenty-something slacker living in Los Angeles, who relies on a trust fund for finances and shares an apartment with her friend Simon, an unsuccessful telemarketer who is self-conscious about his body odor. One day, Simon comes home from the grocery store to find a dead woman in Chance&#x27;s bed.

The film then goes back several months. Chance is annoyed when Rory, a struggling soap opera actor with whom Chance had a one-night stand, appears at her door and becomes emotional trying to convince her that they have a connection beyond just sex. Chance and Simon spin a story about meeting in a mental institution, which makes Rory uncomfortable enough to stop crying and to leave.

Simon tricks Chance into answering a phone call from her mother by telling her that it is a man named Jack whom she was immediately attracted to when she met him at a nightclub. Her mother, Desiree, is calling to tell her that she is coming to visit. Trying to escape spending time with her mother, Chance persuades Simon to switch roles with her for the weekend and Simon spends time with Desiree pretending to be Chance until Desiree tells Simon that she needs to talk to Chance about something in particular. Desiree tells Chance that she is leaving Chance&#x27;s father Malcolm, who is in a relationship with another woman named Heidi.

Upset, Chance tells Simon about her parents&#x27; divorce and reveals that Desiree wants to stay with them for a while. Chance is suspicious when Simon tries to offer some comfort, and he begs again for $200 to pay off some unpaid parking tickets. Though hesitant to loan anyone money because of a bad experience with her first serious boyfriend, Chance agrees to give him the money for playing along with her charade for her mother.

Uncomfortable with the idea of her mother living with her, Chance arranges for Desiree and her to have dinner with Malcolm and Heidi. Chance also invites Rory and, as Chance had hoped, Heidi is immediately smitten with him because she watches the soap opera in which he stars. When Rory manages to get Heidi out of the room, Chance asks her parents about the divorce. Malcolm reveals that Desiree had suggested that they experiment sexually with Heidi, and Desiree felt rejected when Heidi preferred him. Desiree insists that he seduced her, but Malcolm denies it. Malcolm says that while attractions may come and go he loves her.

Chance goes out to a nightclub one night and meets a woman named Sara, who makes sexual advances on her. Chance brings Sara home with her, and after spending a day in bed together, Sara suggests that they take some drugs. Chance refuses and takes the drugs away. Chance leaves her apartment the next morning, and when she returns she finds Simon in her bedroom with Sara, who has apparently overdosed; Chance fears that Sara may have died from the drugs. Simon, overcome with emotion, kisses her and they have sex. Afterward, the two quickly begin to fight about the significance of the sex and Simon leaves the apartment.

The next morning Chance awakes to find Sara, alive, sitting at the kitchen table. She thanks Chance for a place to sleep off the drugs and then leaves. Meanwhile, Simon runs into Jack, who recognizes him from the nightclub. When Simon realizes that Jack is hitting on him, he tells him that Chance has a crush on him and thinks that he is straight. Simon then tells Jack about what had happened the night before and about his frustration and attraction to Chance. Jack tells Simon that, even though he is gay, he sometimes has sex with women because he needs the contact with human beings, and Simon realizes that he needs that human contact too.

Simon returns to Chance&#x27;s apartment, and Chance is happy to see him, greeting him with a hug. They apologize for their actions and both admit that they are ready to try a relationship.

==Cast==
* Amber Benson as Chance, a slacker in her 20s. 
* James Marsters as Simon, Chance&#x27;s friend and an unsuccessful telemarketer.
* Christine Estabrook as Desiree, Chance&#x27;s mother.
* Tressa di Figlia as Sara, a British woman that was first seen in a club who makes sexual advances on Chance.
* Andrew Hallett as Jack, a man whom Chance is attracted to when she was at a night club.
* Rayder Woods as Rory, a struggling actor whom had a one-night stand with Chance.
* Jeff Ricketts as Malcolm, Chance&#x27;s father.
* Nate Barlow as Milton, a creepy neighbor of Chance.
* Shamus Murphy as Guy, one of Chance&#x27;s former boyfriends.
* Patrick Beller as The Orderly
* Lara Boyd Rhodes as Heidi, Malcolm&#x27;s ditzy girlfriend
* Rupert Cole as Johnny
* Jaimie Linn as Rachie
* Grant Langston as The Strolling Minstrel
* David Fury as Pizza Delivery Guy

===Themes===
* &quot;Chance&quot; explores sex and how it functions for different people and in different relationships. Because of a previous bad relationship in which her boyfriend used sex for manipulation, Chance has stripped sex of its meaning. Insecure about his body, Simon shies away from any kind of interaction, so he needs to feel a real connection to a woman to become intimate with her. Jack sees sex as comforting, a way to connect with people.
* The film also plays at reversing gender roles with the male characters—Simon, Rory, Malcolm—needing emotional connection in their sexual relationships, while the female characters experiment sexually and are sexually aggressive, with Chance possessing something of a &quot;get some, get gone&quot; attitude. More obviously Chance and Simon literally switch gender roles for the day when Chance&#x27;s mother visits.

==Stylistic techniques==
* Non-linear storytelling -- The film begins with a provocative situation and then goes back in time to show how the situation came to occur.
* Breaking the Fourth Wall -- Both Chance as the narrator and the &quot;strolling minstrel&quot; break the fourth wall by talking or singing directly to the camera.

==Production details==
* Filming Dates: March–April 2001
* The costume designer Nickolaus Brown also worked on &quot;Buffy&quot; and borrowed clothes from the wardrobe department. Seth Green wore Simon&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Inn&quot; T-shirt, which Chance also wears, in the &quot;Buffy&quot; episode &quot;Harsh Light of Day&quot; and during a photoshoot for some &quot;Buffy&quot; promotional photos.
* Joss Whedon allowed Benson to shoot on the &quot;Buffy&quot; set, and all of the club scenes were filmed on the interior and exterior sets for The Bronze.
* This movie reunites Amber Benson and James Marsters with Andy Hallett, whom they worked with before on Mere Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Enforcers&quot;. 

===Casting===
* Much of the cast has some connection to the Buffyverse: Benson and Marsters obviously played prominent characters on &quot;Buffy&quot;; David Fury was a writer/producer and Rupert Cole was a production assistant on &quot;Buffy&quot;; Jeff Ricketts guest starred on both &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; as a Watchers&#x27; Council member; Andy Hallett starred on &quot;Angel&quot; as Lorne/The Host; Grant Langston guest starred on an episode of &quot;Angel&quot;; and Tressa di Figlia was married to &quot;Buffy&quot; cast member Nicholas Brendon.
* In the Behind the Scenes special feature on the &quot;Lovers, Liars and Lunatics&quot; DVD, Christine Estabrook says that she met Benson at a WB party. (Benson worked on &quot;Buffy&quot; and Estabrook worked on &quot;Nikki&quot;, a short-lived WB comedy.) Estabrook approached Benson at the party to tell her how much she liked Benson on &quot;Buffy&quot; and Benson asked if Estabrook would play her mother in a movie that she had written.

==Shakespeare==
* When Desiree and Malcolm make up, they recite Shakespeare to each other, specifically a conversation between Hermia and Lysander in Act I, Scene i of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

<doc id="496842" wikidata="Q1811522" url="?curid=496842" title="Martin P4M Mercator">
<text>The Martin P4M Mercator was a maritime reconnaissance aircraft built by the Glenn L. Martin Company. The Mercator was an unsuccessful contender for a United States Navy requirement for a long-range maritime patrol bomber, with the Lockheed P2V Neptune chosen instead. It saw a limited life as a long-range electronic reconnaissance aircraft. Its most unusual feature was that it was powered by a combination of piston engines and turbojets, the latter being in the rear of the engine nacelles.

==Design and development==
Work began on the Model 219 in 1944, as a replacement for the PB4Y Privateer long-range patrol bomber, optimised for long range minelaying missions, with the first flight being on 20 October 1946. A large and complicated aircraft, it was powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney R4360 Wasp Major 28-cylinder radial engines. To give a boost during takeoff and combat, two Allison J33 turbojets were fitted in the rear of the two enlarged engine nacelles, the intakes being beneath and behind the radial engines. The jets, like those on most other piston/jet hybrids, burned gasoline instead of jet fuel which eliminated the need for separate fuel tanks.

A tricycle undercarriage was fitted, with the nosewheel retracting forwards. The single-wheel main legs retracted into coverless fairings in the wings, so that the sides of the wheels could be seen even when retracted. The wings themselves, unusually, had a different airfoil cross-section on the inner wings than the outer.

Heavy defensive armament was fitted, with two 20 mm (.79 in) cannon in an Emerson nose turret and a Martin tail turret, and two 0.5 in (12.7 mm) machine guns in a Martin dorsal turret. The bomb bay was, like British practice, long and shallow rather than the short and deep bay popular in American bombers. This gave greater flexibility in payload, including long torpedoes, bombs, mines, depth charges or extended-range fuel tanks.

==Operational history==

The US Navy chose the smaller, simpler, cheaper and better performing P2V Neptune for the maritime patrol requirement, but nineteen aircraft were ordered in 1947 for high-speed minelaying purposes. The P4M entered service with Patrol Squadron 21 (VP-21) in 1950, the squadron deploying to NAS Port Lyautey in French Morocco. It remained in use with VP-21 until February 1953.

From 1951, the 18 surviving production P4Ms were modified for the electronic reconnaissance (or SIGINT, for &quot;signals intelligence&quot;) mission as the P4M-1Q, to replace the PB4Y-2 Privateer. The crew was increased to 14 and later 16 to operate all the surveillance gear, and the aircraft was fitted with a large number of different antennae.

Starting in October 1951, electronic surveillance missions were flown from U.S. Naval Station Sangley Point in the Philippines, later from Naval Air Station Iwakuni, Japan, and Naval Air Station Atsugi, Japan, by a secretive unit that eventually gained the designation Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron One (VQ-1). Long missions were flown along the coast (about offshore) of Vietnam, China, North Korea and the eastern Soviet Union, and were of a highly secret nature; the aircraft sometimes masqueraded as regular P2V Neptunes in radio communications, and often flew with false serial numbers (Bureau Numbers) painted under the tail. Operational missions were always flown at night, during the dark with the moon when possible, and with no external running lights.

The Mercators were replaced by the EA-3B Skywarrior, which, being carrier-based, had a greater degree of flexibility, and the larger Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star. Final withdrawal from service was in 1960 after which all of the remaining P4Ms were scrapped.

==Losses==
* On 8 March 1951 a Mercator flew into the Atlantic Ocean off Florida, four of its crew were killed.
* On 6 February 1952, a Mercator ditched north of Cyprus at night, out of fuel, with no power, losing only the Aircraft Commander/pilot after they were in the water (See United States Naval Institute, Naval History, March/April 1997). The crew was rescued by HMS &quot;Chevron&quot;.
* On 22 August 1956, one Mercator was shot down near Shanghai by Chinese fighters of the 2nd Aviation Division, with its crew of 16 all killed.
* On November 19, 1957, a Mercator was lost in an accident
* On 6 January 1958, a P4M-1Q of JQ-3 crashed at Ocean View, Virginia, when it lost an engine on approach to NAS Norfolk, Virginia, killing four crew and injuring three civilians.
* On 16 June 1959, a P4M-1Q was attacked by two North Korean MiG-17s with heavy damage and serious injury to the tail gunner.
* On 19 January 1960, VQ-2 P4M-1Q JQ-16 (BuNo 124365) crashed en route to Adana AFB killing all 16 aircrew. The RAF Mountain Rescue Team based at Nicosia, Cyprus recovered the bodies of 12 crew members before being forced to leave the recovery of the remaining bodies/parts until the spring.

<doc id="496848" wikidata="Q3638724" url="?curid=496848" title="Bernardino Nogara">
<text>Bernardino Nogara (June 17, 1870 — November 15, 1958) was the financial advisor to the Vatican between 1929 and 1954, appointed by Pope Pius XI and retained by Pope Pius XII as the first Director of the Special Administration of the Holy See. According to historian John F. Pollard, Nogara laid &quot;the foundations&quot; for &quot;one of the biggest pillars for the Vatican&#x27;s post-Second World War financial strength.&quot;

Nogara&#x27;s career was characterized by an &quot;ability to move fluidly in the highest circles of industry and politics as well as the Church&quot;. In his role as Director of the Special Administration, Nogara made large investments in many of the largest companies in Europe, personally becoming a board member of a &quot;mind-boggling&quot; number of firms, and appointing directors to many others.

Though a Catholic with several close relatives in the Holy Orders, Nogara insisted that his investments remain unrestricted by religious or doctrinal considerations. Under Pius XI, Nogara made large investments in firms contrary to Catholic social teaching and made direct loans to Mussolini&#x27;s government prior to Mussolini&#x27;s 1935 invasion of Ethiopia. Under Pius XII, Nogara routinely invested in firms that profited from and enabled the war effort of the Axis powers during World War II. Though these investments were hidden from the Allies (with whom Nogara also transacted), through the use of holding companies and offshore banking centres, under Nogara &quot;like water finding a downhill path, Vatican money found its way to the grisly side of the Holocaust&quot;. However, other than a Vatican purchase in May 1940 of a minor shareholding in an Italian insurance company, La Fondaria, no primary source evidence has ever been offered in support of these latter claims, while documents recently discovered in The National Archives, London (in the T231 and T160 series) reveal that Nogara transferred the Vatican&#x27;s entire foreign investment portfolio to the United States at the beginning of the war, and throughout the duration of the war was actively accumulating a substantial portfolio of stocks in British and American war-related industries in support of the Allied war effort. By contrast, no document has yet been produced to substantiate the claim that any funds were invested in Germany.

==Early financial career==

Nogara was trained as an engineer at the Politecnico di Milano . He managed mining projects in Wales (where he learned fluent English), Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire. While in Istanbul, he was appointed a representative to the Italian Banca Commerciale and then the Italian representative to an international committee overseeing the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s debt and the Italian delegation to the economic committee at the Versailles Peace Conference in 1919, after which he remained on the permanent reparations committee. He was later appointed to manage the industry section of the Inter-Allied Commission that enacted the Dawes Plan in Berlin.

Within the Banca Commerciale Italiana, Italy&#x27;s largest private bank, he became a member of the board of directors and later the vice-president. He was also a member of the board of Commissioni Economiche e Finanziarie alle Conferenze (Comofin).

Nogara&#x27;s dealings with the Vatican began in 1914, when he purchased a variety of bonds on behalf of Pope Benedict XV.

==Director of the Special Administration==

===Appointment===
The Vatican finances were on the verge of bankruptcy prior to being bolstered by $92.1 million (750 million lire cash and another 1 billion lire in Italian government bonds) which the Vatican received as a consequence of the Lateran treaties in 1929, as compensation for the occupation and annexation of the Papal States by the Italian Government in 1861 and 1870.

In 1929, Pope Pius XI, a family friend, appointed Nogara director of the Special Administration of the Holy See, charged with the financial dealings of the Vatican. In theory, the director of the Special Administration reported to a three cardinal committee—which included Eugenio Pacelli (who became the next pope) and Pietro Gasparri; in practice, Nogara reported directly to the Pope, meeting with him more frequently than any official in the Curia, with the exception of the Cardinal Secretary of State. The Special Administration was independent of the other two Vatican financial offices, although Nogara may have exercised considerable influence over the other branches of Vatican finances as well.

Nogara accepted Pius XI&#x27;s appointment on one condition: that he would not &quot;be restricted by religious or doctrinal considerations&quot;. Nogara&#x27;s promotion was just one of many where Pius XI favoured other natives of Lombardy with promotions within the Roman Curia. At the time, one of his brothers, Bartolomeo, was the superintendent of the Vatican museums, two were archbishops, one was the rector of an Apulian seminary, and his sister was a mother superior.

===Under Pius XI===
Nogara&#x27;s tenure at the Special Administration came on the heels of the Wall Street crash of 1929, and its many after-effects in Europe. Nogara immediately restructured the holdings of the Holy See, moving approximately 100 million lire in gold reserves and moving aggressively into real estate as an entrepreneur rather than an arms-length investor. Nogara created many companies, and appointed equally many chief executive officers to firms that still exist today. Grolux, the holding company for the profits of the Special Administration between 1932 and 1935, was housed in Luxembourg due to its dearth of public disclosure laws.

Nogara became a board member of many Italian firms due to the Vatican&#x27;s controlling interests, including Assicurazioni Generali, Italy&#x27;s largest insurer (and one of the largest in the world), and Società Generale Immobiliare, the largest construction company in Italy (which went on to become one of the largest in the world). The Mafia&#x27;s interest in these activities is fictionalized in the 1990 movie &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;.

Nogara was a party to the negotiations on the reorganization of Italy&#x27;s banks, which followed 1929 legislation bailing out the banks. With this inside information, Nogara knew exactly which industries and firms would benefit from the bailout and purchased large positions in these companies.

Nogara&#x27;s seat on the boards ensured that he could direct the firm toward the interests of the Vatican and the other equity holders. Nogara, through shrewd investing in stocks, gold, and futures markets, vastly increased the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s financial holdings. By 1935, Nogara had vastly expanded the Vatican treasury in a sum estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars (the Holy See kept the exact amount confidential).

Nogara was a controversial figure with the Roman Curia because many of his investments were perceived to violate the church&#x27;s doctrines. For example, Nogara purchased a controlling share in Istituto Farmacologico Serono di Roma, Italy&#x27;s largest manufacturer of birth control products. Nogara also invested in Italy&#x27;s munitions plants and other war industries, including direct loans to Mussolini&#x27;s government prior to his invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. However, Nogara was highly regarded by many cardinals for bolstering the church&#x27;s finances, which had been declining since 1870.

===Under Pius XII===
After his election in 1939, Pope Pius XII retained Nogara as the head of the Special Administration. Pius XII met regularly with Nogara, as had his predecessor, keeping a close eye on the investment holding of the Holy See. Pius XII managed Nogara directly, with no intermediaries, and
no notes were taken during their conferences (nor do any documents relating to Nogara exist in the ADSS). The information from this period of Nogara&#x27;s tenure is relatively &quot;scanty&quot; (compared to the period 1931–1939, documented by Nogara himself), although much is contained in the US national archives due to Nogara&#x27;s transactions with New York banks. However, a new and vast set of documents became available in 2012 when the day to day records of the Vatican&#x27;s financial transactions for this period were discovered in The National Archives, London, (files T231/140 to T231/142, T231/1131 and T160/369) which throw new and interesting light on the Vatican&#x27;s financial dealings throughout the duration of the war.

The immediate concern for Nogara upon the outbreak of World War II was that the Vatican assets in the various Allied and Axis countries not be seized or frozen. Nogara&#x27;s &quot;cloaked real estate companies&quot; continued to operate throughout Europe, in Allied and Axis controlled territory, for the entire war. Although Germany otherwise had a policy of blocking funds that might reach Allied countries, the Vatican—which had, and used, an account at the Reichsbank—was excluded and enjoyed relative freedom. Reference does not support statement.

Nogara arranged the Vatican purchase of Profima, a Swiss property owner, into a full-fledged holding company, by 1938 &quot;being able to participate in all forms of commercial, industrial, property and financial enterprises&quot;. It was through Profima, and other similarly organized holding companies, that the Vatican was able to purchase blacklisted companies, such as Banco Sudameris (blacklisted by both the US and Great Britain for its financing of the Axis war effort). There are reasons other than profit why Nogara may have been interested in Sudameris—for example, he helped found the bank prior to World War I—but it was without question that the purchase could only have produced a large return if Axis won the war.

Although Harold Tittmann, the American envoy, bypassed Nogara and warned the Cardinal Secretary of State against the purchase of Sudameris, once the Vatican went ahead with the purchase in 1941 it &quot;left no stone unturned&quot; in its quest to get the company removed from the Allied blacklists, petitioning nearly every relevant government in the world. According to Phayer, the confrontation over the delisting of Sudameris &quot;boiled down to two views of fascism. For the Vatican, which had done business with the fascists during the prewar days, Sudameris was &quot;business as usual&quot;.

Similarly, Nogara bought shares in Italian insurer La Fondiaria for the Vatican in May 1940, acting on a tip that Mussolini&#x27;s government would soon nationalize many Italian assets of English insurer Norwich Union and hand them over to Fondiaria. Even at the time the purchase was controversial because only two months earlier the insurer had made clear its fascist sympathies by firing all of its Jewish employees. While the Allies would not have required the Vatican to sell its assets in Fondiaria if they had been acquired before the war, had they learned of this mid-war transaction, they would have blocked all the banking accounts of the Holy See in New York as well as its business interests in the United States and Great Britain. According to Phayer, both Nogara and Pius XII were well aware that their covert purchase of Fondiara amounted to a &quot;betrayal of trust&quot; of their agreements with the Allied powers. However, Italy did not declare war on Britain and France until June 1940, the US Freezing Orders were not applied to Italy and Continental Europe until July 1941 and the United States did not enter the war until after Pearl Harbor in December 1941, thus it is not clear in what sense this purchase in May 1940 involved the &quot;betrayal of trust&quot; asserted by Phayer.

Fondiaria would go on to collaborate with the Nazi expropriation of Eastern European insurance companies, both directly and indirectly (by working with collaborating re-insurers to pool risk). According to Phayer, &quot;like water finding a downhill path, Vatican money found its way to the grisly side of the Holocaust&quot;. Phayer cites Nogara&#x27;s timely purchases of firms about to benefit from fascist and Nazi expropriation as proof that Nogara &quot;knew which way the wind was blowing&quot;. Another firm that Nogara invested the Vatican heavily in, Assicurazioni Generali, was the prime beneficiary of the fact that &quot;fascist countries were about to remake the European insurance industry&quot; at the expense of the European Jewry.

In 1941, Phayer suggests that Nogara may have been planning a substantial investment in Iberian tungsten carbonate mining operations (the &quot;high tech metal of the conflict&quot;), the same year that Germany&#x27;s invasion of Russia cut off their previous supply of Russian metals. According to Phayer, &quot;the conclusion is unavoidable: &quot;Nogara indirectly trafficked in the arms race and did so knowing that any resulting profit would be derived from stolen property&quot;&quot;. As the US would have blocked the transaction had they known it was for tungsten mining, the Vatican labelled the funds as earmarked for &quot;food exports&quot;. But Phayer&#x27;s contention is convincingly undermined by British Foreign Office file FO371/28930 which reveals that the pesetas and escudos supplied by the US Government for food exports were in fact used by Carlo Pacelli, Pius XII&#x27;s nephew, to purchase food from Spain and Portugal with which the Vatican was feeding half the starving population of Rome. Thus no evidence whatsoever exists to support Phayer&#x27;s speculation.

Based on a reference to one &quot;Noraga&quot;, an Abwehr agent, in the interrogation report of Abwehr recruiter Karl Wilhelm Reme, Gerald Posner argues that this could only be Bernardino Nogara who would thereby be able &quot;to sabotage the Allied war effort and at the same time find ways to help finance the Axis powers&quot;. However, John Pollard, reviewing Posner&#x27;s book in &quot;The Tablet&quot;, points out that the interrogation report of this selfsame Nogara is found in The National Archives, London, where he is identified as Bruno Nogara, a Venice school teacher and Blackshirt fanatic who was arrested by the Allies in April 1945.

Faced with this evidence, Posner has amended his recently published paperback version of &quot;God’s Bankers&quot; and now says, on page 137, that there were in fact two &quot;Abwehr&quot; agents named Nogara: Bruno Nogara, whose Interrogation Report is found in The National Archives, London, and Branch Nogara, listed in Appendix C of the Interrogation Report of Reinhard Reme, &quot;Abwehr&quot; II Recruiter, found in the National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, D.C. His argument is that the former, Bruno Nogara, is listed as a member of &quot;Abwehr&quot; Unit 257 under &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; Hubert Pfannenstiel, while the latter, Branch Nogara, is listed under &quot;Abwehr&quot; Unit 254 commanded by &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; Ernst Schmidt-Burck – thus, two different &quot;Abwehr&quot; Units under two different commanders and therefore two different Nogaras. “The Tablet”, however, reports that the very source cited by Posner clearly identifies &quot;Branch Nogara&quot;, not as a person, but as the small town of &quot;Nogara&quot; located just north of the river PO where &quot;Abwehr&quot; Unit 254 maintained its supply depot. According to &quot;The Tablet&quot;, there is no second Nogara, only Bruno Nogara, an &quot;Abwehr&quot; agent, and the small Italian town of Nogara which Posner claims refers to Bernardino Nogara, the Vatican&#x27;s Financial Director, when actually it refers a town of the same name.

According to Pollard, it became public in Nogara&#x27;s obituary in 1958 that in WWII, Nogara was the Vatican&#x27;s representative in Rome&#x27;s underground resistance movement, the Committee of National Liberation. Nogara&#x27;s grandson, Ambassador Osio, in his interviews with Pollard, said that Nogara did not invest in German securities, or in tungsten, and that he disliked the Nazis.

In 1954, Nogara was succeeded as director of the Special Administration of the Holy See by Henri de Maillardoz, a director of Credit Suisse.

==Diary==
Nogara kept a diary recording his audiences with Pius XI from 1931 to 1939, which remains unpublished. The diary is supplemented by a variety of papers in the Nogara Archives (AFN), which provide detailed information about the finances of the Vatican and Nogara&#x27;s involvement.

<text>East York is a district and former municipality within Toronto, Ontario, Canada. From 1967 to 1998, it was officially the Borough of East York, a borough within the upper-tier municipality of Metropolitan Toronto. The borough was dissolved in 1998 when it was amalgamated with the other lower-tier municipalities of Metropolitan Toronto to form the new &quot;megacity&quot; of Toronto. Prior to its amalgamation, East York was Ontario&#x27;s last remaining borough.

It is separated by the Don River from the former City of Toronto. Traditional East York is southeast of the river, and the neighbourhoods of Leaside, Bennington Heights and densely populated Thorncliffe Park are northwest of the river. The heart of East York is filled with middle-class and working-class homes.

==History==
East York was originally part of York Township, Ontario. Following the incorporation of the Township of North York in 1922, York Township was divided by Toronto, Leaside and North Toronto. With the rapid growth that followed the opening of the Bloor-Danforth (Prince Edward) Viaduct in 1918, the residents of the eastern half of York Township (as an exclave of the western half) felt they had been neglected by the township when it came to roads, sewers and other municipal services. Left with the option to either join the City of Toronto or branch out on its own, 448 East Yorkers voted to incorporate a new township, while 102 voted to amalgamate with Toronto. The Township of East York was incorporated on January 1, 1924 with a population of 19,849. The western half of York Township retained its name.

East York was originally populated by working-class English people who valued the opportunity to own small homes of their own, with front lawns and back gardens. Many had immigrated from Lancashire and Yorkshire. In 1961, 71.7% of the population identified themselves as having British origins.

In the late 1940s, after World War II, East York became home to many returning veterans and their families. Many inexpensive homes were built, including the houses around Topham Park, by the government, to house the returning veterans and the baby boomers. The local government was both socially conscious and frugal, fitting the residents&#x27; self-image of East York as filled with supportive neighbours and non-government organizations.

For many years, East York did not allow the serving of alcoholic beverages in any restaurants, etc. The result was a heavy concentration of alcohol-serving restaurants and bars on Danforth Avenue, the main street in the city of Toronto running east–west just south of East York. The prohibition of serving alcohol was eliminated in the 1970s.

The borough of East York was established in 1967 through the amalgamation of the former township of East York and the former town of Leaside. Leaside was a planned industrial and residential community. East York has over the years been a residential enclave for senior citizens, as the original owners from the 1940s age and as younger families move out to suburbs to live in larger houses. East York had its own fire department with three stations, which are still in operation today under the combined Toronto Fire Services. Recently, rapid and accelerated gentrification has changed many neighbourhoods. Many one-story bungalows have added second floors, and many shops have been converted to more upscale shops. Canada&#x27;s only borough, East York was semi-autonomous within the greater municipality of Metropolitan Toronto.

In 1998, Metro Toronto and its constituent municipalities were dissolved and replaced by the new &quot;megacity&quot; of Toronto. East York&#x27;s last mayor was Michael Prue who went on to become city councillor for East York, and then a Member of Provincial Parliament for Beaches—East York in 2001. Between 2002 and 2005, the East York Civic Centre&#x27;s &quot;True Davidson Council Chamber&quot; was used to hold the Toronto Computer Leasing Inquiry/Toronto External Contracts Inquiry.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many residents of East York stood up against illegal rent increases. This came in the form of protests, rent strikes, and community organizing.

==Geography==
East York is located not far from the mouth of the Don River. The municipality borders Scarborough to the east, Old Toronto to the west, and North York to the north. East York is located north of Danforth Avenue between the Don River and Victoria Park Avenue.

==Demographics==
East York&#x27;s population was 115,185 in 2001. By the 2006 census, the population had dropped slightly (−2.7%), to 112,054.
Since the 1970s, the population composition has changed from predominantly British, as East York has become a major arrival point for immigrants, many of whom have established their first Canadian residence in the apartments that became plentiful in Thorncliffe Park, Crescent Town and elsewhere on or near main streets. Almost half of the population in 2001 (45.1%) was foreign-born, and of these, 49.0% had immigrated to the area between 1991 and 2001. These groups include Bengalis, Indians, Pakistanis, Jamaicans, Filipinos and Sri Lankans. East York also has a well established Greek population and a growing Chinese community. In 2006 the percentage of visible minorities was 38.4%, and the percentage of immigrants was 44.4%.

The religious affiliations of the East York population are consistent with its ethnic composition. Some 63.4% of the population adheres to Christianity, with an almost even split between Catholics (23.6%) and Protestants (25.3%). Christian Orthodox and unspecified types of Christianity make up 12.0% and 2.5% respectively. The largest non-Christian religious group is Muslim, who make up 12.6% of religious adherents, followed by Hinduism (3.7%), Buddhism (1.6%), and Judaism (0.9%). A sizable percentage of the population (17.1%) has no religious affiliation. 

There is also Estonian House which is the unofficial Estonian Consulate in Toronto. The building houses banquets, social events, and an Estonian school.

While English is the dominant language in the area, nearly half (42.6%) of the population reports that their first language was neither English nor French.

==Education==

Four public school boards provide primary and secondary education for residents of East York, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM), Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the Toronto District School Board (TDSB). CSV and TDSB operate as secular public school boards, the former operating French first language institution, whereas the latter operated English first language institutions. The other two school boards, CSCM and TCDSB, operate as public separate school boards, the former operating French first language separate schools, the latter operating English first language separate schools.

The East York Board of Education was the former authority of English secular schools in East York, until East York was amalgamated into the City of Toronto in 1998. The Metropolitan Separate School Board managed all separate schools (English and French) until 1998, when the school board was reorganized into CSCM and TCDSB.

In addition to primary and secondary education institutions, East York is also home to a campus operated by Centennial College. The college is a post-secondary institution with campuses located throughout Toronto.

==Sports==
East York is home to various sports teams. The hockey teams are the Bulldogs, playing in East York Arena, Victoria Village, playing in Victoria Village arena and the Flames, playing in Leaside Memorial Community Gardens. All three leagues offer co-ed (boys and girls) entry level and competitive select hockey for various ages, being played in the North York Hockey League. The East York Lyndhursts represented the Canada men&#x27;s national ice hockey team at the 1954 Ice Hockey World Championships.

East York is home to East York Soccer, playing at East York Collegiate, Clairlea Soccer, playing at various locations and the Leaside-East Toronto Soccer Club, playing at Leaside High School and Flemingdon, who offer entry level and competitive soccer for all ages. East York is represented by East York City FC in soccer. East York is home to baseball organizations such as East York and Topham Park. East York provides entry level and AAA baseball for all ages, while Topham Park provides entry level and competitive select softball. East York is home to a provincially known figure skating club, a gymnastics club, a lawn bowling club, and a curling club. East York has a skateboarding community group, Team EY, who collaborated with the local skateboarding community to build the East York Skatepark in 2007.

Leaside Memorial Community Gardens, the largest recreation centre in Leaside, provides an indoor swimming pool, an ice rink, a curling rink and a large auditorium.

<text>The Biikebrennen (meaning &quot;bonfires&quot; in Northern Low Saxon), Biikebrånen (in North Frisian) or Pers Awten (meaning &quot;Saint Peter&#x27;s Eve&quot; in South Jutish) is an annual bonfire night celebration held on 21 February in North Frisia, in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein and in Southern Jutland in Denmark.
The origin of Biikebrennen is unclear but the roots of the festival stem from pagan times. The meaning has changed over time. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the event was especially associated with seafarers engaged in whaling. The ritual varies a little from location to location. At Biikebrennen, nearly all North Frisian towns, and many isolated farmhouses as well, light their own bonfires, known locally as , at or shortly after sunset to bid winter farewell.

<doc id="496859" wikidata="Q3460615" url="?curid=496859" title="Sables-Spanish Rivers">
<text>Sables-Spanish Rivers is a township in Ontario, Canada, on the north shore of Georgian Bay. It is located in the Sudbury District, approximately west of Sudbury.

The township was created in 1998 by amalgamating the former towns of Massey and Webbwood with the Township of The Spanish River and the unorganized geographic townships of May and Shakespeare, and was named for Massey&#x27;s location at the junction of the Spanish and Aux Sables rivers.

The township&#x27;s population was 3,237 in the 2021 Canadian census. The municipal offices are located in Massey.

==Communities==
Massey () is located at the junction of the aux Sables and Spanish Rivers, close to the northern shore of Lake Huron. Chutes Provincial Park is one of its principal attractions. Massey is one of several sites that claim to be the home of broomball.

Walford () is the westernmost community of the township located along Highway 17. Its economy was primarily based on logging and mining. The old Walford fire tower still stands north of the village on Tube Lake.

Webbwood () was incorporated as a town in 1906.

The hamlet of Lee Valley is divided between the municipalities of Sables-Spanish Rivers and Espanola.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Sables-Spanish Rivers had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Culture==
The community hosts an annual fair in late August, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2007.

Massey holds a fall fair every year at the fairgrounds. There are rides, contests, prizes, many games and even more vendors. A crash-up car derby has been recently been added along with a four-wheeler mud bog competition. In 2008, the classic car show at the fair was very small compared to the years before so it may be cancelled. There are motocross races, horse pulls, and horse shows there as well.

===Recreation and sports===
The Massey District Community Centre and Arena is located in Massey, and plays host to the Massey Predators Minor Hockey Association and the Massey and District Figure Skating Club. The Massey Marathon is held annually using the arena as a centre for registration and award ceremony. The marathon is now in its 33rd year and is a qualifier for the Boston Marathon. The township is also the home of Chutes Provincial Park.

==Transportation==

All three of the township&#x27;s main communities are located directly along . Massey is located at the junction of Highway 17 and .

All three communities sit along the Huron Central Railway, and once had Canadian Pacific Railway stations. Webbwood was once a divisional point on the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s Sudbury–Soo Line, with the Webbwood Subdivision to the east and the Thessalon Subdivision to the west. As steam engines were phased out, Canadian Pacific no longer needed as many divisional points for refueling and repair, so its importance as a station declined and the station was eventually removed.

Massey and Webbwood are both stops on Ontario Northland&#x27;s Sault Ste. Marie–Ottawa motor coach route.

The Great Lakes Waterfront Trail, a part of the Trans Canada Trail, passes through the township. Travelling from Spanish in the west, the trail enters the township following DeClerk Road and Menard Crescent on gravel before following the route of Highway 17 along a paved shoulder. At Walford, it dips south to follow the gravel route of River Road parallel and to the north of the Spanish River. Upon reaching Massey, it passes through the south of the town before continuing along Lee Valley Road toward Lee Valley.

==Media==

The township is served primarily by media from Sudbury, Elliot Lake, Espanola and Little Current.

In 1995, The Canadian Wildlife Experience Inc. received a licence to operate a new low-power tourist information radio station to serve Massey, Walford and Spanish, Ontario at 98.5 MHz, during the spring, summer and fall seasons. The call letters were CJWE-FM. It is uncertain if the station is still currently in operation.

==Notable people==
The citizens of Webbwood elected Canada&#x27;s first female mayor, Barbara Hanley, in 1936.

Massey is the birthplace of artist Robert Lougheed and former NHLer Pete Horeck. It is also the hometown of writer and former bank robber Stephen Reid and the current home of poet Charlie Smith.

Theodore Drake, one of the inventors of Pablum, was born at Webbwood.

<doc id="496867" wikidata="Q1738830" url="?curid=496867" title="Kenner Products">
<text>Kenner Products, known simply as Kenner, was an American toy brand owned by Hasbro. Kenner Products began as a toy company founded in 1946, going on to produce several highly recognizable toys and merchandise lines including action figures for the original series of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot; as well as die cast models. 

The company underwent numerous acquisitions and mergers throughout its lifetime, starting with by General Mills in 1967, which eventually spun it off alongside Parker Brothers in 1985 as Kenner Parker Toys, Inc. In 1987, Kenner Parker was acquired by Tonka, which in turn was purchased by Hasbro in 1991. Hasbro closed and merged Kenner&#x27;s offices and products in 2000. The brand was reintroduced by Hasbro in 2010 with the release of &quot;Star Wars&quot;: The Vintage Collection.

== History ==

Kenner was founded in 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, by brothers Albert, Philip and Joseph L. Steiner. The company was named after the street where the original corporate offices were located, just north of Cincinnati Union Terminal. It was a pioneer in the use of television advertisement for the marketing of merchandise across the United States, beginning in 1958.

In 1962, Kenner introduced its corporate mascot, the Kenner Gooney Bird, and its company slogan &quot;It&#x27;s Kenner! It&#x27;s fun!&quot; for advertising. In 1968, the company commissioned Muppets creator Jim Henson to create an Easy-Bake Oven ad, which featured the Kenner Gooney Bird in puppet form. Later in 1969, the puppet would be repurposed as the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; character Little Bird. The Bird was phased out by 1974.

The company was purchased by the food company General Mills in 1967. In 1971, General Mills merged its Rainbow Crafts division into Kenner, bringing Play-Doh into the Kenner product line. In 1985, General Mills would spin-off both its Kenner and Parker Brothers toy divisions to form Kenner Parker Toys, Inc. The following year Kenner Parker sold off its Lionel Trains division.

Kenner Parker was acquired by Tonka in 1987. Under Tonka management, Kenner Products was reconstituted as a division. Tonka (including Kenner) was purchased by the toy company Hasbro in mid-1991. Hasbro closed the Cincinnati offices of Kenner in 2000, and Kenner&#x27;s product lines were merged into Hasbro&#x27;s.

== Products and product lines ==
One of Kenner&#x27;s original products was the &quot;Bubble-Matic,&quot; a toy gun that blew bubbles. An &quot;updated&quot; version was available at least as late as the mid-1960s. Kenner introduced its popular Girder and Panel building sets construction toy in 1957, the Give-a-Show projector in 1959, the Easy-Bake Oven in 1963, the Electric Mold Master also in 1963, the Spirograph drawing toy in 1966, and the Starting Lineup sports action figure collectible line in 1988.

Kenner Products obtained the rights to produce Star Wars action figures and playsets for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy from 1976 through 1985. After Kenner acquired the license to produce &quot;Star Wars&quot; toys when the Mego Corporation rejected it in 1976, Kenner popularized the 3.75 inch action figure that became an industry standard. Kenner also produced toys related to the popular 1970s TV series &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; and the 1979 sci-fi movie &quot;Alien&quot;. In 1981, Kenner belatedly entered the diecast toy car market, with a short-lived range called Fast 111&#x27;s. The 1980s also saw the release of the &quot;Fashion Star Fillies&quot; line of model horses, a product discontinued by the end of the decade.

One of Kenner&#x27;s most highly acclaimed lines was the Super Powers Collection, produced from 1984 to 1986. These action figures were based on the famed superheroes of DC Comics. What made the line so successful was that the characters were modeled almost exactly from the style guide of the company; and also, each character performed some &quot;action.&quot; For example, if Superman&#x27;s legs are squeezed, he would throw a punch. Furthermore, Kenner was able to commission some of the characters&#x27; creators like Jack Kirby for his New Gods characters and George Perez for Cyborg to design the action figures. In 1985, DC Comics named Kenner as one of the honorees in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot; for its work on the Super Powers Collection.

One of the more popular action figure lines in the late 1980s was Kenner&#x27;s &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, based on the 1986-1991 animated series adaptation of the 1984 feature film &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. The toy line debuted the same year as the cartoon and continued production through most of its run. Although the initial releases accurately resembled &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; cartoon designs, unlike Super Powers, the toy line very soon stopped attempting to be faithful to the existing source material. Instead, new, original costumes, weapons and ghost characters were designed by Kenner, many of them centered on unique action features, similar to those popularized by Mattel&#x27;s competing &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; toy line as well as Kenner&#x27;s earlier Super Powers toy line.

This idea of basing a toy line on well-known characters but then coming up with original designs that were not based on any published storylines represented a major shift in the design approach to action figure toy lines at the time. In previous years, one major approach to producing toy lines was to base them closely on popular, well-known characters from properties like &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Marvel Comics, or DC Comics. The other major approach was for the toy companies to invent their own original characters and then help produce comic books and cartoons that promoted those exact designs (e.g., Hasbro&#x27;s G.I. Joe and Transformers and Mattel&#x27;s &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot;). In a departure from this, Kenner did not have any arrangement to incorporate their new concepts and designs into &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; cartoons or comic books.

This looser approach to the source material of licensed toy lines continued with Kenner&#x27;s Dark Knight Collection, launched in 1990 and the first of their numerous lines based on the Batman character. This initial set was created to capitalize on the phenomenal success of the cinematic version of the character, releasing vehicles (such as the Batmobile or Batplane) inspired on the highly successful 1989 film. Kenner also made vehicles from the &quot;Batman Forever&quot; movie (1995). Later toy lines expanded beyond the movie series and took inspiration from and comic book incarnations. Kenner went on to develop lines centered on Superman and other DC Comics characters as well. As with &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, most of these DC Comics lines incorporated multi-colored costumes, weapons and action features which were not based directly on any existing storylines, although the character names and likenesses were typically drawn from the source material. This design approach to the DC Comics toy lines was continued to a large extent by Mattel when they took over the DC Comics license and produced lines based on the movies &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; and &quot;Superman Returns&quot; as well as the Justice League cartoons. Hasbro, Kenner&#x27;s eventual buyer, has taken a similar approach with some of their action figure lines, most notably on their 2010 3.75&quot; Spider-Man action figure line as well as some of their 2009 &quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&quot; product.

In 1998, the &quot;Jurassic Park: Chaos Effect&quot; line was released but sales were less than expected. The &quot;Night Hunter&quot; series, the second line of toys based on &quot;Chaos Effect&quot;, was planned for 1999, but was cancelled due to poor sales. The &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; series became more of an annoyance to Hasbro rather than a trademark brand name. Due to this, the overproduction of &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; toys, coupled with low sales, forced Hasbro to downsize by getting rid of the Kenner department in Cincinnati. 100 people were transferred and 420 were laid off. Among these 420 was the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; design team (which also designed &quot;Batman&quot; among other toy lines), who had just started the very early concepts for &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;. Because of this, Hasbro assigned the toys from &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; to their &quot;Star Wars&quot; design team, who scaled the humans to be in size with &quot;Star Wars&quot; figures and made the style of the toys similar to the ones from &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;.

In 2010, Hasbro began releasing modern &quot;Star Wars&quot; action figures with packaging reminiscent of the original Kenner 1978–1984 Star Wars product line. Star Wars: The Vintage Collection is composed of new highly pose-able figures, with screen-accurate likenesses. Hasbro had done this twice before, with the 2004 &quot;vintage&quot; Original Trilogy Collection and the 2006–2007 &quot;vintage&quot; Saga Collection but this is the first time that their Star Wars line was entirely dedicated to replica Kenner carded figures.

<text>Velizh () is a town and the administrative center of Velizhsky District in Smolensk Oblast, Russia, located on the bank of the Western Dvina, from Smolensk, the administrative center of the oblast. Population: 

==History==

In the late 14th century, it used to be a border fortress of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Muscovy recaptured it in 1536. Lithuania recaptured it in 1562, then Muscovy again in 1563, then Polish forces led by Jan Zamoyski captured it in 1580, confirmed by the 1582 Truce of Yam-Zapolsky. In 1585, King Stephen Báthory of Poland established the coat of arms and granted privileges for the townspeople. In 1654 it was occupied by Russia, but in 1667 it was restored to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

After the First Partition of Poland in 1772 the town was annexed by Russia and included into newly established Pskov Governorate, a giant administrative unit comprising what is currently Pskov Oblast and a considerable part of Belarus. After 1773, the area belonged to Velizhsky Uyezd of Pskov Governorate. In 1777, it was transferred to Polotsk Viceroyalty. In 1796, the viceroyalty was abolished and the area was transferred to Byelorussia Governorate; since 1802 to Vitebsk Governorate. Between July and October 1812, Velizh was occupied by the army of Napoleon advancing to Moscow. In 1924, Vitebsk Governorate was abolished, and Velizhsky Uyezds was transferred to Pskov Governorate.

In April 1823, Velizh was the site of an infamous blood libel incident, in which local Jews were wrongly accused of the murder of Christian boy who was found dead in a field. Based on the testimony of a drunk prostitute, over forty Jews were arrested and in 1826 the synagogues were closed. Some of the accused were not released until 1835.

In 1860 there were 649 craftsmen in the town, and in 1891 there were 67 industrial plants in the town, which employed 1,279 people. Two annual fairs were held in the town in the late 19th century. In 1897, the ethnic make-up, by mother tongue, was 49.1% Jewish, 47.6% Belarusian, 2.3% Russian, and 0.4% Polish.
On 1 August 1927, governorates were abolished, and Velizhsky District with the center in Velizh was established. It belonged to Velikiye Luki Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On June 17, 1929, Velizhsky District was transferred to Western Oblast. On 23 July 1930, the okrugs were also abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On 17 September 1937, Western Oblast was abolished, and the district was transferred to Smolensk Oblast. During World War II, between July 1941 and September 1943, Velizhsky District was occupied by German troops.

Much of the town was destroyed during World War II. During the war, Velizh was occupied by the German Army from July 14, 1941 to September 20, 1943. In September 1942, German occupation forces murdered all but 17 of the town&#x27;s 1,440 Jewish residents.

On 1 February 1963, during the abortive Khrushchyov administrative reform, Velizhsky District was merged into Demidovsky District, but on 12 January 1965 it was re-established.
==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Velizh serves as the administrative center of Velizhsky District. As an administrative division, it is, together with seventeen rural localities, incorporated within Velizhsky District as Velizhskoye Urban Settlement.

<doc id="496876" wikidata="Q861519" url="?curid=496876" title="Iki, Nagasaki">
<text>is a city on the island of Iki, in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. As of November 2022, the city has an estimated population of 25,042 and a population density of 202 persons per km2. The total area is 138.57 km2.

==Geography==
Iki is located in the Tsushima Strait, approximately west of Fukuoka on mainland Kyushu. The city consists of five inhabited and 17 uninhabited islands, and its entire area is within the Iki-Tsushima Quasi-National Park.
===Climate===
==History==
The Iki Islands have been inhabited since the Japanese Paleolithic era, and numerous artifacts from the Jōmon, Yayoi and Kofun periods have been found. The islands were organized as Iki Province under the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; reforms in the latter half of the seventh century. Following the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate in the Edo period, the islands came under the rule of Hirado Domain.

Following the Meiji restoration, Iki became part of Nagasaki Prefecture, and was organized into Iki District and Ishida District, with a total of 22 villages. These were consolidated into 12 villages by 1889, and Ishida District was abolished in 1896. Mushozu was raised to town status in 1925, followed by Katsumoto in 1935 and Takawa in 1947. Gonoura was established in 1955, and Takawa was renamed Ashibe. Ishida was raised to town status in 1970.

The modern city of Iki was established on March 1, 2004, from the merger of the towns of Ashibe, Gonoura, Ishida and Katsumoto (all from Iki District).

==Economy==
The island has abundant groundwater reserves, and agriculture is widely practiced by the local inhabitants. Rice and tobacco are the primary cash crops. Commercial fishing and whaling, once the mainstay of the local economy, have been largely restricted since the 1980s, although sea urchin, sardine, mackerel, abalone and kombu are harvested. Tourism is a growing sector of the local economy.

==Transportation==
Iki Island has ferry terminals in Ashibe, Ishida and Gōnoura, which connect Iki to mainland Japan. Located on the east coast Iki Airport (IKI/RJDB) connects the island to Nagasaki. Japan National Route 382 connects the hamlets of the island together, and the bus company &quot;Iki-kotsu&quot; provides for public transport.

<doc id="496877" wikidata="Q2396765" url="?curid=496877" title="Distance line">
<text>A distance line, penetration line, cave line, wreck line or guide line is an item of diving equipment used by scuba divers as a means of returning to a safe starting point in conditions of low visibility, water currents or where pilotage is difficult. They are often used in cave diving and wreck diving where the diver must return to open water after a penetration when it may be difficult to discern the return route. Guide lines are also useful in the event of silt out.
Distance lines are wound on to a spool or a reel for storage, and are laid &quot;in situ&quot; by unrolling. The length of the distance line used is dependent on the plan for the dive. An open water diver using the distance line only for a surface marker buoy may only need , whereas a cave diver may use multiple reels of lengths from to 1000+ ft (300 m).

Reels for distance lines may have a locking mechanism, ratchet or adjustable drag to control deployment of the line and a winding handle to help keep slack line under control and rewind line. Lines are used in open water to deploy surface marker buoys and decompression buoys and link the buoy on the surface to the submerged diver, or may be used to allow easy return navigation to a point such as a shotline or boat anchor.

The material used for any given distance line will vary based on intended use, nylon being the material of choice for cave diving. A common line used is polypropylene line when it does not matter if the line is buoyant.

The use of guide line for navigation requires careful attention to laying and securing the line, line following, marking, referencing, positioning, teamwork, and communication.

==Applications==
Cave diving: Guide lines are used in cave diving as standard procedure whenever it is possible that the divers may be confused about the way out. In effect, this is in any dive where there is no free surface overhead and where daylight is not visible at all points of the dive. By the most common definition of cave diving, this would mean guide lines should be used for all cave dives.

Wreck diving: The use of guide lines in wreck diving is very similar to their use in cave diving.

Diving in low visibility: A guide line may be used for dives where poor visibility may make it difficult to return to the starting point, and there is a safety or operational requirement to return to that point.

Other dives where it is necessary or highly desirable to return to a starting point: This may include dives where a shot line or anchor line is to be used for ascent, and other dives where a specific exit point is chosen for safety or convenience. Working divers may use a guide line to allow confident and efficient movement to, from and around the workplace. This may also be referred to as a jackstay. In these applications the guide line is generally more for efficiency than for safety, but it may also help the divers stay away from potentially hazardous areas. 

Guidelines may be used to direct divers on underwater search patterns.

Guide lines may also be used as a means of directing tourists around a dive site, between points of interest which may be difficult to find without the line. This form of guide line may be permanently placed.

==Equipment==

===Cave line and wreck line===
, strictly speaking, is line used for navigation in caves, but the term is used generically for the type of line carried by divers on reels and spools for use as guide lines and surface marker buoy lines. It is made using the same machines and materials to the same specifications as the equivalent line used for other purposes. When used in wreck diving, the same material is called , though a thicker line may be used for better abrasion and cut resistance in an environment of rusty metal edges.
;Material: 
:Nylon is strong, with a tenacity of 6.5 to 9 g/D (gram per denier), durable and sinks. The specific gravity (SG) is 1.14. Negative buoyancy is considered a desirable feature for some applications, where a line that sinks to the bottom is easier to find than one which may float up to the overhead if dislodged from tie-offs. Abrasion resistance is poor when wet.
:Polypropylene is also strong and durable, with tenacity of 6.5 g/D, and fair abrasion resistance, but it floats, with SG of 0.91, and is preferred where the risk of floating up to the overhead and being difficult to find is offset by the line not being easily buried in silt on the bottom.
:Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (Spectra and Dyneema) is very strong and durable. Tenacity is between 35 and 48 g/D, more than 4 times the strength of nylon. It is also relatively expensive. More line can be carried on the reel with equivalent or greater strength and durability than other fibres. UHMWPE is slightly buoyant in fresh water with SG of 0.98. Abrasion resistance is excellent. It is slippery and knots must be tied with care.
:Natural fibres such as cotton and sisal are not usually used for guide line as they rot and lose strength relatively quickly, and are more bulky for equivalent strength. They may be used for temporary lines on wrecks where it may not be possible to recover the line before ascent, and biodegradation is desirable.
;Structure: 
:Twisted line may have greater strength for the same bulk, but it is more easily broken by abrasion, and has a greater tendency to twist on itself when not under tension, and unlay when cut or broken, making it more difficult to handle. 
:Single braid is more resistant to abrasion and twisting than twisted line, and is easily available in suitably small diameters. It is usually the preferred structure for temporary guide line and permanent line in places where conditions are not rough on the line. 
:Double braid (Kernmantle) line consists of a core strength member and a sheathing for abrasion resistance. This is more expensive, larger and heavier than the thinner lines, but may be better for permanent guide lines, particularly in places where water movement reduces the expected lifespan of the line due to abrasion.
;Thickness: 
:American measure: usually 18 to 36 gauge, with 24 gauge (about 1.86 mm diameter) single braid as a good general purpose size.

;Colour: 
:White is generally the preferred choice as it shows up best in low light.
:Other high visibility colours may be used to allow the specific line to be easily identified, such as the main route, or a personal line. Yellow is a popular colour for main route guide line, particularly for kernmantle line. In this application it is known as &quot;gold line&quot;.
;Marking (knots): 
:Personal line may be marked at regular intervals by knots, allowing the diver to make an easy estimation of distance travelled by counting the knots as the line is deployed. is a popular spacing.

===Reels===
A dive reel comprises a spool with a winding knob, which rotates on an axle, attached to a frame, with a handle to hold the assembly in position while in use. A line guide is almost always present, and there is usually a method of clipping the reel to the diver&#x27;s harness when not in use.
*The handle may be positioned on top, behind, or at the side of the spool.
*The spool is the storage area for the line. It has a hub and two flanges, which prevent the line from falling off the sides of the hub. The size of the spool and the thickness of the line together determine the length of line the reel can hold, though this is also affected by how neatly the line is wound onto the spool.
*The winding knob is on the side of the spool. Most reels are laid out for holding in the left hand and winding with the right. The knob is usually attached by a bolt which allows it to rotate, giving a more secure grip to the winding hand.
*The line guide is a slotted attachment which guides the line onto the spool. This helps to control the stacking of the line on the spool when it is reeled in.
Other accessories which may be present (usually not all on the same reel) include:
*Ratchet mechanism, which prevents the spool from rotating when there is tension on the line. this prevents inadvertent unreeling of line, as the ratchet lever must be held in the open position to allow unwinding. The ratchet mechanism is usually a ratchet wheel on the spool which engages with a spring-loaded pawl which can either be held open by a trigger lever, or clipped open by a knob or lever on the handle. The ratchet allows the spool to be manually rotated to wind in line when engaged.
*A lock down screw or latch is an alternative way of preventing spool rotation if there is no ratchet. This will prevent rotation in both directions.
*An adjustable brake may be fitted to control the friction of the spool on the handle, so that some tension is required to unwind the line, and the spool can not spin freely, causing overruns and tangled line. The brake may be released when reeling in.
*The line may have a snap hook or an end loop to tie off the free end.
*A clip may be attached to the handle to clip the reel off to the diver&#x27;s harness.
*A lanyard may be connected to the handle to connect the reel to the diver while in use.
*A wrist loop may be fitted to the handle to attach the reel to the diver while in use.

Reels may be made from a wide variety of materials, but near neutral buoyancy and resistance to impact damage are desirable features, which are easiest to achieve in engineering polymers such as nylon, acetal (delrin) and polyethylene.

Reels may also be open or closed. This refers to the presence of a cover around the spool, which is intended to reduce the risk of line tangles on the spool, or line flipping over the side and causing a jam. To some extent this works, but if there is a jam the cover effectively prevents the diver from correcting it. Open reels allow easy access to free jams caused by overwinds or line getting caught between spool and handle.

===Spools===
Finger spools, dive spools, line spools, or cave spools, are a simple, compact low tech alternative to reels best suited to relatively short lengths of line. They are simply a pair of circular flanges with a hole in the middle, connected by a tubular hub, which is suitably sized to use a finger as an axle when unrolling the line. Line is secured by clipping a bolt snap through a hole on one of the flanges and over the line as it leaves the reel. Line is reeled in by holding the spool with one hand and simply winding the line onto the spool by hand. Spools are most suitable for reasonably short lines, up to about 50m, as it becomes tedious to roll up longer lengths. The small, compact size, and low cost make them useful for various purposes where long line is not required.
Spools may be made from any material that is strong enough and suitable for underwater service, but engineering thermoplastics are most common.

=== Line holders ===

A line holder is a simple device for storing and deploying line underwater. A simple type is an H-shaped piece of wood, plastic or stainless steel used to manually wrap a moderate length line.

It may be used in conjunction with a surface marker buoy or a delayed surface marker buoy by divers, or for a short guide line. When used to deploy a DSMB, negative buoyancy is helpful in to safely unwind the line underwater as the buoy floats to the surface, as it may not be possible to manually unwind the line fast enough to avoid being pulled upwards. For this method of deployment the line holder is dropped and left to unwind by gravity. This may not work as intended, and the line holder may unwind more line than is useful if deployed in midwater. This problem falls away when used with a regular SMB, or for a short guide line.

===Types of reel or spool===
====Cave reels====
Cave reels are reels used in cave diving. They are often specifically designed for laying and recovering line at swimming speeds, and may differ from reels used for other purposes such as deploying a DSMB. They usually have an adjustable drag facility to prevent overrun, and a lock, but may not have a ratchet.

Exploration reels are large cave reels that can hold a lot of line, in some cases as much as , and are used during major exploration dives where this length is needed. They tend to be bulky and impractical for most other purposes. They are often used to lay permanent line.

Penetration reels (also known as primary or lead reels) are used to run line from a point with direct access to the surface to the start of a permanent line. This may be as much as a few hundred feet into the overhead. These reels will usually carry of line. These reels are also used for short penetrations where there is no permanent line.

====Spool types====

Jump and gap spools are used to bridge gaps between two permanent guide lines. Line length is generally about 

Safety spools are used in emergencies such as line breaks, searches for a lost guide line or lost diver. They generally carry about of line, and one should be carried by each diver. They are not intended for use under an overhead except in an emergency.

DSMB spools are used to deploy inflatable surface marker buoys from depth. They have negative buoyancy and enough line to reach the surface from the planned deployment depth, and are often made of injection moulded plastic and sold as a set with the DSMB. Larger versions which can carry more line and are suitable for use from deeper depths are more likely to be machined from aluminium and are both more ergonomically shaped and more expensive.

====Ratchet reels====

General purpose reels used by open water divers usually feature a ratchet mechanism which allows rapid deployment of DSMBs, and secure recovery of line, using the spring-loaded ratchet to prevent unintended unrolling during ascent, but allowing deployed length to be increased rapidly under tension by disengaging the pawl, which is usually operated by a thumb lever or finger trigger. Ratchet reels are occasionally fitted with a drag mechanism to allow controlled line tension when laying guide line, and a ratchet release retainer, but these features add complexity and cost and potential failure points, and are not needed for open water use.

===Line markers===
Line markers are used for orientation as a visual and tactile reference on a permanent guide line. Directional markers (commonly arrows), are also known as line arrows or Dorff arrows, and point the way to an exit. Line arrows may mark the location of a &quot;jump&quot; location in a cave when two are placed adjacent to each other. Two adjacent arrows facing away from each other, mark a point on the line where the diver is equidistant from two exits.

Non-directional markers (&quot;cookies&quot;) are purely personal markers that mark specific spots, or the direction of one&#x27;s chosen exit at line intersections where there are options. One important reason to be adequately trained before cave diving is that incorrect marking can confuse and fatally endanger not only oneself, but also other divers.

===Silt screws===

Silt screws are pegs which are inserted into soft bottom sediments to tie off the guide line when there are no suitable natural formations. A common style of silt screw is a length of rigid PVC tube cut to a point at one end, with a notch at the other to secure a wrap. These are lightweight and durable, and are easily transported by attaching them to a cylinder with bungees.

==Procedures==
The principle of a between the penetration diver and open water is central to cave and wreck diving safety. Procedures associated with the use of guide lines include primary and secondary tie-off, laying line, positioning line, following line, marking and identifying line, identifying jumps and exit directions, searching for a lost line, repairing a break, and recovering line. 

===Laying line===
Most reels are designed to be held in the left hand, particularly for recovering line. Line should be kept under tension at all times to avoid slack which is more likely to snag on divers&#x27; equipment. An adjustable brake may be used to provide resistance to rotation, or this can be done by pressing a thumb or finger against the spool as it rotates, which is quick and controllable, but requires some attention, and fails if the reel is dropped. The line should be kept clear of the divers body during the laying to reduce risk of snagging on the diver&#x27;s equipment. This can be achieved by holding the reel away from the body in clear water.

The line should be laid so that it can be followed in the worst possible visibility, and allow for other emergency procedures such as gas sharing at the time. This generally means that the divers must be able to follow it by feel.

Line traps are places that a line can pass through but are too tight for a diver, making it impossible to follow the line by feel. Avoiding line traps is a large part of the skill of laying line, and generally require the line to be tied off in such a way that it does not enter line trap areas when under the necessary tension to prevent slack. As a general principle, this requires the line to be secured at any change of direction, by a &quot;placement&quot; or a &quot;tie-off.&quot;

A placement is made by running the line past a contact surface in such a way that friction or geometry of the line position prevents the line from moving. This may be adequate, for example, when going past a boulder which has a notch which holds the line in place.

A tie-off generally involves &quot;wrapping&quot; the line round a fixed object once or twice, and may be made more secure by adding a &quot;lock&quot;, which is made by looping the reel around the incoming line and taking up the slack, before continuing the lay. A lock also puts the incoming and continuing parts of the line in contact, which makes it much easier to follow by feel.

The security of both placements and tie-offs depends on the detail of the place where they are made, and some may be disrupted by a pull on the line in the wrong direction. This makes the skill of following a line without dislodging it an important safety issue.

Placements and tie-offs take time to set up, and time to negotiate when following the line by feel, so they should be limited to those which are actually useful. To be useful, a tie-off would limit the distance to the next tie-off to a reasonable distance which could be negotiated with a safety spool in case of a break, or which prevents a line trap. More frequent placements and tie-offs are likely to be used on a permanent line which does not have to be retrieved on the way back, and which must withstand use by many divers over a long period.

====Line routing====
The position of the line can make a large difference to the ease with which divers may follow it. The line would ideally allow divers to see or feel it while swimming comfortably without coming into contact with or being obstructed by, the bottom, sides or ceiling. This is not always possible.

The bottom is often easy to follow by eye and often has suitable tie-off points, but sometimes swimming close to it may cause silting, and it may result in a higher inert gas loading and higher gas consumption than an alternative route.

The sides have a problem in that they constrain divers to swim on one side of the line only.

The ceiling may be difficult to tie-off to, and is difficult to follow, as the divers will generally have to look upwards. Following a ceiling guide line by feel can be even more awkward and tiring, and an overhead line is both more likely to get snagged by a diver&#x27;s equipment, and be more difficult to unsnag, as the snag is likely to be behind the diver where it cannot be seen or easily reached.

====Entering the overhead====
If the lead diver is the one to lay line on entering the overhead environment, it is possible for other divers in the team to follow the guide line for their safety, and they can check the security of tie-offs and that the line is not moving into traps unnoticed. This order also reduces the risk that a diver will become separated from the team if the line-layer has to stop for any reason.

====Primary tie-off====
The primary tie off is made in a place with direct vertical access to the surface, if possible, in a place where it is unlikely to be interfered with by outsiders. This tie-off should be secure.

====Secondary tie-off====

The secondary tie-off is made just inside the overhead, where the route to the exit is obvious even if visibility is lost. This is a backup in case the primary tie-off is compromised.

====Connection to a permanent guide line====

The temporary entry guide line should be tied off to the permanent line and the reel locked. A recommended method is to make two wraps around the permanent line and then clip the line end back to the line. Another method is to pass the reel or spool through a loop at the and of the line made for that purpose, the loop may be of stiffer and thicker line and may have a short extension to make it easier to undo on the return. This method cannot be accidentally released.

===Recovering a temporary guide line===

If the last diver out is the one to reel in the line, the lead divers can prepare the way by loosening tie-offs just ahead of the reel, and there is less risk of them becoming separated from the group without the reel operator noticing. This can significantly reduce the risk of anyone getting lost. This order is even more safety critical if the exit is in poor visibility. In an emergency, the reel would be left at a tie-off and the divers would exit without recovering the line, as this would save time.

===Navigation===
There is more to navigating by guide line than merely following the line.

Survey of line condition: A permanent guide line may have deteriorated since the latest reliable report on its condition. A complete check of line condition during the penetration will ensure that there are no unpleasant surprises like line breaks or line traps during the exit

Distance from the guide line: Good visibility may be compromised very quickly in some environments. If a diver is more than arm&#x27;s reach from the line when visibility is lost, it will be necessary to find the line in possibly adverse circumstances. This can be avoided by remaining within reach of the line.

Guide lines are frequently used in areas with heavy silt, and the line may lie on the silt or be close above it. If silt is kicked up everyone following will have poor visibility, and the return along the line may be in low or zero visibility, which is at the very least inconvenient. The ability to fin without kicking up the silt relies on good level trim and appropriate finning techniques.

====Orientation====
It can be useful to build up a mental model of the route, even to make notes and sketches indicating major landmarks and changes of direction. This helps to reduce disorientation on return along the line, when the surroundings may look very unfamiliar because they are observed from a different direction. For the same reason, occasional checks in the exit direction will make the route look more familiar on return.

=====Compass checks=====
Use of a compass for occasional checks of direction has the advantage of providing a secondary input for sense of direction. This can be of great value when disorientated for any reason.

====Pace and order of activity====
It is important for safety to ensure that the gas supply for the return is sufficient for reasonable contingencies. It is more conservative gas management to do any work on the outward leg, and return directly, unless specifically planned otherwise. As the exit is approached, the gas stock and decompression obligations can be re-assessed, and plans adjusted accordingly.

== Safety ==
Although distance lines are considered to be safety equipment, there are hazards associated with their use.
* Entanglement: Loose line in the water is generally a greater entanglement risk than relatively taut line. The chances of snagging the diver&#x27;s equipment on line depends on awareness of the line&#x27;s position relative to the diver, and the number of possible snag points on the diver&#x27;s equipment. The ability to release a line snag depends on the ability to identify and reach the snag. Keeping the line in view or in hand at arm&#x27;s length, and keeping the number of possible snag points on equipment to a minimum will reduce the entanglement risk. Passing under a line increases the risk of snagging on a point that cannot be seen or reached, requiring assistance or the need to cut the guide line to get free. If the line is cut, it no longer serves the purpose of providing an unbroken guide to the exit, and this is another emergency. Thin line may snag more easily and can be more difficult to free by feel. 
* Line breaks: A line break during entry is an inconvenience. It may ruin the dive but should not endanger the divers. in many cases it can be repaired and the dive continued. On the way out, it can be an emergency, as the route may become uncertain, and remains uncertain until the other end has been found. The emergency spool is carried to allow a search for the lost end without losing the end in hand, which may have moved apart some distance due to sinking, floating, or drifting with a current. 
* Line traps:
* Losing the line:

==History==
In 1977, Sheck Exley published &quot;Basic Cave Diving: A Blueprint for Survival&quot; which pointed out that the lack of a continuous guide line was one of five main contributing factors in cave diving accidents.

<text>Ole von Beust (born 13 April 1955) is a former German politician who was First Mayor of Hamburg from 31 October 2001 to 25 August 2010, serving as President of the Bundesrat from 1 November 2007 on for one year. He was succeeded as mayor by Christoph Ahlhaus.

==Life and work==
Born in Hamburg as &quot;Carl-Friedrich Arp Freiherr von Beust&quot;, he is the son of Achim Helge Freiherr von Beust and Hanna, née Wolff, who was considered half Jewish in Nazi Germany. The von Beust family is an old noble family from the Altmark, which appears in 1228 for the first time. Through his father he is a descendant of Saxon and Austrian statesman Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust. He had his nickname &quot;Ole&quot; registered as his first name.

In 1971 von Beust became a member of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU). In 1973, after finishing high school, he worked for CDU parliamentary group in the Hamburg Parliament (&quot;Hamburgische Bürgerschaft&quot;), a position he held until he started to study law in 1975 at the University of Hamburg. From 1977 until 1983 he was Hamburg president of the youth organisation of his party. Since 1978 von Beust has been a member of the Hamburg city-state&#x27;s parliament. In 1983 he successfully completed his studies and became an independent lawyer.

He has been a member of the ruling council of the Hamburg Land CDU since 1992, and of the national ruling council of the CDU party since 1998.

===First Mayor of Hamburg===
First term

On 31 October 2001, Ole von Beust became First Mayor of Hamburg.

When Hamburg experienced an exodus of jobs after major corporations including cigarette-maker Reemtsma, travel and shipping company Hapag-Lloyd, haircare products-maker Hans Schwarzkopf and the Vereins and Westbank AG were acquired by companies outside of Hamburg, von Beust had the city&#x27;s investment arm, the Hamburger Gesellschaft für Beteiligungsverwaltung, join forces with retailer Tchibo for the acquisition of cosmetics maker Beiersdorf in 2003. This put American multinational Procter &amp; Gamble out of the bidding and preserved Beiersdorf as a publicly traded, stand-alone company in Hamburg.

As host of Hamburg&#x27;s annual St. Matthew&#x27;s Day banquet for the city&#x27;s civic and business leaders, von Beust invited several high-ranking guests of honour to the city, including Queen Silvia of Sweden (2003), King Abdullah II of Jordan (2005), Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark (2006), President Jakaya Kikwete of Tanzania (2008).

On 19 August 2003, von Beust dismissed his vice-mayor, Ronald Schill, causing a scandal. Von Beust had earlier dismissed Walter Wellinghausen, senator of the interior and Schill&#x27;s most important official, without consulting Schill beforehand. This was due to public allegations of misconduct on Wellinghausen&#x27;s part. In a private conversation, Schill then demanded that von Beust take back the dismissal, allegedly using personal threats. Von Beust then decided to dismiss Schill as well.

In the (preassigned) press conference Schill held minutes after he had heard of his own dismissal, he spoke vaguely of &quot;homosexual relationships&quot;, a &quot;flat in an infamous hustler district&quot; and &quot;certain things happened that let one infer the occurrence of love acts&quot; between von Beust and Roger Kusch, who von Beust had appointed minister (in German city-states &quot;senator&quot;) of justice. Von Beust in turn stated that Schill threatened to make his alleged liaison with Kusch public under the premise that von Beust intermingled public and private affairs. He said he had no sexual relationship with Kusch, that they merely knew each other for 25 years and were good friends, and that von Beust was Kusch&#x27;s landlord. &quot;This is all – absolutely all&quot;, according to von Beust.

His unprepared statement to the press quickly earned Schill a homophobic reputation. A popular radio-station broadcast a song calling him &quot;Mega-Proll&quot; (mega redneck) and gay and lesbian associations protested vocally. Schill however later affirmed von Beust&#x27;s version of the story, except for the accusations of blackmail, saying that he warned von Beust to stay clear of nepotism, and that this had nothing to do with von Beust&#x27;s sexual orientation. He stated &quot;I have nothing against homosexuals&quot;.

In a later interview, von Beust&#x27;s father confirmed that his son is indeed homosexual. Von Beust himself considers his sexual orientation a private matter; when asked directly he usually ironically refers the interviewer to his father. He has been in a relationship with his partner Lukas Förster since 2009 when the high school student completed an internship at the town hall. In 2013, the 56-year-old ex-mayor married his 22-year-old partner.

Second term
The Hamburg elections of 29 February 2004, ended with an unprecedented landslide victory for Ole von Beust and the CDU, with the party achieving an overall majority in the city-state&#x27;s parliament. The CDU gained 47.2 percent of the vote, a full 21-point increase from the previous election in September 2001. This was the first time since 1993 the city-state has had only a single ruling party.

Under von Beust&#x27;s leadership, the Hamburg state government made the decision to commence construction of the Elbphilharmonie, a concert hall in the quarter.

Between 2007 and 2009, von Beust was one of 32 members of the Second Commission on the modernization of the federal state, which had been established to reform the division of powers between federal and state authorities in Germany.

Third term

In the Hamburg elections of 24 February 2008, the CDU gained 42.6 percent of the vote. Thus, the CDU continued to be the strongest party in Hamburg. However, since the CDU lost its absolute majority, it formed a coalition government with the Greens. At the time, the two party&#x27;s cooperation was widely seen as a test for a possible coalition at the national level.

In February 2009, von Beust and Minister President Peter Harry Carstensen of Schleswig-Holstein agreed on a €13 billion bailout of state-owned shipping financier HSH Nordbank. The two states were forced to intervene after the SoFFin fund, which had been set up by the federal government in 2008 to stabilize the financial markets, said it could not help out HSH Nordbank until it got rid of all its bad debts.

Ahead of the 2009 national elections, von Beust was tipped as potential Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development in the cabinet of Chancellor Angela Merkel; in the negotiations on a coalition agreement with the FDP, however, the position went to Dirk Niebel.

In 2010, von Beust became the first German state leader to indicate that his state was in principle willing to provide humanitarian solutions for former Guantanamo inmates approved for release; Hamburg later accepted one released detainee.

On 18 July 2010, von Beust announced his resignation, to take effect on 25 August. Leaving office alongside von Beust were Karin von Welck, Hamburg&#x27;s State Minister for Culture, and Volkmar Schoen of the senate chancellery.

Shortly after, voters in Hamburg toppled von Beust&#x27;s proposed education reforms in the city-state&#x27;s first binding referendum. The vote assured the preservation of Hamburg&#x27;s four-year primary schools, rather than extending primary education to six years, which the ruling coalition of Christian Democrats and Greens had proposed.

==Life after politics==
Upon leaving active politics, von Beust opened his own law firm and joined consultancy Roland Berger as advisor. In 2012, he succeeded Klaus von Dohnányi as Executive Director of the Hamburg Foundation for Politically Persecuted People.

During a strike of ground crew at Frankfurt Airport in February 2012, von Beust was appointed as arbitrator by airport operator Fraport for negotiations with trade union GdF. The union accepted his proposed settlement plan; Fraport, however, rejected the deal.

In addition, von Beust has been holding various paid and unpaid positions, including the following:
* Friends of the Fraekelufer Synagogue, Member of the Board of Trustees
* Alliander AG, Member of the Advisory Board (since 2016)
* BoxDirect AG, Member of the Supervisory Board
* CH2 Contorhaus Hansestadt Hamburg AG, Chairman of the Supervisory Board
* Donner &amp; Reuschel, Advisor (since 2014)
* ECE Projektmanagement, Member of the Sustainability Board
* Germela, Member of the Advisory Board
* Varengold Bank, Member of the Advisory Board (since 2013)
* Wirtschaftsrat der CDU, Member of the Board
* Rotary International, Member
* HafenCity Hamburg GmbH, Ex-Officio Chairman of the Supervisory Board (2010)

In late 2015, von Beust was named co-chairman (alongside Jürgen Trittin and Matthias Platzeck) of a government-appointed commission tasked with recommending by early 2016 how to safeguard the funding of fulfilling Germany&#x27;s exit from nuclear energy. By April 2016, the commission agreed to ask the power firms to pay €23.3 billion ($26.4 billion) into a state fund to cover the costs of nuclear waste storage.

==Political positions==
For the 2021 national elections, von Beust endorsed Markus Söder as the Christian Democrats&#x27; joint candidate to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel.

==Recognition==
Von Beust was a finalist for the World Mayor prize of 2010.

<text>Teve Guía was a Puerto Rican gossip and listings magazine. The magazine was established by Mario Prévidi and Juan Ortiz Jiménez in 1962. &quot;Teve Guía&quot; was written in association with the United States magazine, &quot;TV Guide&quot;, but had a slightly different format. The publisher of &quot;Teve Guía&quot; was Agencia de Publicaciones.

Apart from offering daily programming information, &quot;Teve Guía&quot; also published interviews with entertainers, both from Puerto Rico and on the international scene, and gossip sections. Another section, &quot;Querida Aurora&quot;, was a &quot;Dear Abby&quot; style column, dedicated to counseling readers who wrote in seeking advice.

&quot;Teve Guia&quot;&#x27;s main competitors were &quot;Artistas&quot;, &quot;Estrella&quot;, &quot;Estrellita&quot;, and &quot;Vea&quot;.

<doc id="496883" wikidata="Q991032" url="?curid=496883" title="Tsushima, Nagasaki">
<text>is an island city grouped in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. It is the only city of Tsushima Subprefecture and it encompasses all of Tsushima Island, which lies in the Tsushima Strait north of Nagasaki on the western side of Kyushu, the southernmost mainland island of Japan. As of March 2017, the city has an estimated population of 31,550 and a population density of 45 persons per km2. Its total area is 708.61 km2, 17.3% of the area of Nagasaki Prefecture.

==History==
An Imperial decree in July 1899 established Izuhara, Sasuna, and Shishimi as open ports for trading with the United States and the United Kingdom.

On April 1, 1975, Toyotama Village was promoted to the status of a town. Mine Village was also elevated to the status of a town in the following year.

The modern city of Tsushima was established on March 1, 2004, from the merger of six towns on Tsushima Island: Izuhara, Mitsushima, and Toyotama (all from Shimoagata District), and Mine, Kamiagata, and Kamitsushima (all from Kamiagata District). Both districts were dissolved as a result of this merger.

==Geography==
The city of Tsushima is located on Tsushima Island and other small neighbouring islands, lying slightly to the west side of Tsushima Strait, south of the Sea of Japan and north-east of the East China Sea. The island also lies between the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese mainland. Its coastline has a total length of 915 km. Asō Bay, a prominent bay with a rias coastline, is located between the islands. Tsushima lies about 60 km from Iki, 138 km from the city of Fukuoka, and 49.5 km from Busan, South Korea.

===Islands===
Several other islands encompass Tsushima city, in addition to Kamino-shima and Shimono-shima, both of which makes up the Tsushima Island(s):
* Santsu-jima (三ッ島)
* Shimayama-jima (島山島)
* Uni Island

===Flora and fauna===

====Tsushima cat====
Native to the island is the Tsushima cat (or Tsushima leopard cat, an endemic subspecies of the leopard cat, &quot;Prionailurus bengalensis&quot;). Present on the islands since ancient times, its numbers have decreased sharply, and it is now listed as a critically endangered species on the Japanese Red List. , it was estimated that only 80 to 100 animals remain.

===Climate===
Tsushima has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) with very warm summers and cool winters. Precipitation is significant throughout the year, but is much heavier in summer than in winter.



==Demographics and culture==
The population of Tsushima Island has been decreasing significantly. Between the years of 1995 and 2000, the decline was 5.2%. As nuclear families replace the traditional extended families, the average household is smaller, as is the total population. The elderly comprise nearly a quarter of the population here, compared to 20.8% of the Nagasaki Prefecture as a whole, and 17.3% of the population of Japan.

Religious traditions on Tsushima Island mirror those of the rest of Japan, with a majority of the population adhering to Buddhism or Shinto.

==Economy==
Many Tsushima residents are employed as fishermen. It is also known for its pearl culture. The natural environment of the Tsushima Islands also contributes to the local tourism industry. Beaches are crowded with tourists in the summer.

==Transportation==

===Airport===
Tsushima Airport (TSJ) is approximately 10 km (6.2 mi) northeast of the city, with daily services to Fukuoka and Nagasaki serviced by ANA and Oriental Air Bridge.

===Seaport===
Tsushima has two sea ports, Izuhara and Hitakatsu. Ferries cross to the port of Hakata on Kyūshū a few times per day. Ferries also travel a few times a week to Busan in South Korea on the northern port of the island.

===Road===
* Japan National Route 382

==Broadcasting==
Tsushima has received 12 digital TV channels from Fukuoka and mainland Nagasaki prefectures : NHK-G 11, NHK-E 21, NBC 31 (JNN), NIB 41 (NNN / NNS), NCC 51 (ANN), KBC 11 (ANN), TVQ 71 (TX Network), KTN 81 (FNN/FNS), Rkb+ 41 (JNN), FBS 51 (NNN/NNS), CATV 111, and TNC 81 (FNN/FNS); along with its radio frequencies. In addition, the island could receive South Korean TV channels (KBS, MBC and SBS-affiliated KNN) and radio frequencies, due to its location nearby to the port city of Busan.

<doc id="496890" wikidata="Q733064" url="?curid=496890" title="Joseph Trumpeldor">
<text>Joseph Vladimirovich (Volfovich) Trumpeldor (, ; , ; November 21, 1880 – March 1, 1920) was a Russian Zionist activist who helped organize the Zion Mule Corps and bring Jewish immigrants to Palestine. He was killed while defending the settlement of Tel Hai in 1920 and subsequently became a Jewish national hero. According to a standard account, his last words were &quot;It&#x27;s nothing, it is good to die for our country&quot;.

==Biography==
===His parents===
Joseph Trumpeldor’s father, Vladimir Wolf (Ze&#x27;ev), was born in the city of Parczew in Congress Poland, the son of Rabbi Shmuel Asher. At the age of 13, Trumpeldor&#x27;s father was kidnapped as a Cantonist and forced into service in the Russian Imperial Army, where he served for many years as a combat medic. His surname, &quot;Trumpeldor,&quot; was likely given to him by his military officers in an attempt to detach him from his Judaism. Despite his difficult experiences, Trumpeldor’s father did not assimilate, unlike many other Cantonists. Shortly before his discharge, he held a Inauguration of a Torah scroll ceremony at his place of service, which received attention even in Vilnius and was reported in the newspaper &quot;Ha-Karmel.&quot;

Wolf married twice. His second wife was Fedusia Axelvant, an educated woman who was distant from Judaism, with whom he had seven children, the fourth being Joseph. He was raised by his father with Jewish national pride, loyalty to Judaism, to the Tsar, the Russian army, and their homeland Russia. The language spoken in the family was Russian, not Yiddish as was common among Russian Jews at that time.

===Childhood and youth===

Trumpeldor was born in Pyatigorsk in the Caucasus on 1 Tevet 5641 (November 21, 1880, according to the Julian calendar), and grew up in the city of Rostov-on-Don. At the age of seven, he briefly studied in a Talmud Torah school and later attended the municipal school in Rostov-on-Don, where he excelled in his studies. At the age of 14, influenced by the teachings of Tolstoy, he became a vegetarian and a pacifist. He took exams to enter a real gymnasium (high school), passed successfully, but was not accepted due to the Numerus Clausus, which limited the number of Jews allowed to enroll. Due to the need to learn a trade, he returned to Pyatigorsk, to his brother Herman, who was a dentist, and there he studied dentistry. In 1902, he received a government diploma in Kazan as a dental healer.

Later, when writing about his youth, Trumpeldor referred to the persecution and antisemitism he faced in Russia due to his Jewish identity: 

Trumpeldor was influenced by the teachings of Herzl and the historic event of the First Zionist Congress (1897). At age 17, he established a Zionist circle in his city and served as its chairman. However, his activities ceased when he was drafted into the Russian army.

===Trumpeldor in the Russian Army===
In 1902, Trumpeldor was drafted into the army. As a Tolstoyan, he held anti-militaristic views but decided to enlist so that his abstention would not be perceived as Jewish cowardice. He was initially assigned to the 76th Infantry Regiment of the Kuban, based in the city of Tulchyn. There, he befriended David Belotserkovsky.

Early in his military service, Trumpeldor began developing his ideas about settling in Eretz Yisrael.

Trumpeldor volunteered for the 27th Siberian Infantry Regiment that was sent to Port Arthur—the main Russian naval base in East Asia. Soon after, the Russo-Japanese War broke out. From the early battles, Trumpeldor’s name became known as a hero distinguished by his composure and resilience. Following the Russian forces’ retreat to the fortress of Port Arthur, he was awarded the Saint George Cross, 4th degree, and the rank of Sergeant.

Trumpeldor volunteered for the regiment&#x27;s Special Forces unit, tasked with the most dangerous missions. In this elite unit, he encountered antisemitism when one of the commanders declared that there were no cowards or traitors in the unit because there were no Jews among them. The proud Trumpeldor immediately declared his Jewish identity publicly.

On August 20, 1904, a shell shattered his left arm, and doctors had to amputate it above the elbow. Despite his severe injury, Trumpeldor remained motivated and optimistic about the future. His unique personality was evident in a powerful letter he wrote to his family: 

After recovering, he requested to return to the front and said to his commanders: His bravery in battle and his rare request to return to the front earned him special recognition. He was promoted to the rank of Senior Sergeant and received another decoration—the Saint George Cross, 3rd degree. At a ceremonial parade held in his honor, he was appointed commander of the third company and gained the admiration of his soldiers.

===Trumpeldor in Japanese captivity===

On January 2, 1905, following Russia&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Port Arthur, Trumpeldor was captured and taken to a Prisoner of War camp in Takayama, Japan. The Russian prisoners in Japan received good conditions. They were divided into camps according to their religious affiliation, with 1,739 of the approximately 70,000 Russian prisoners being Jewish. Trumpeldor spent about a year in Japanese captivity, and thanks to his personality, he became the leader of the Jewish prisoners. In captivity, he worked tirelessly to promote his ideological and socio-national vision. Alongside organizing the needs of the prisoners in education, welfare, and tradition.

He established a Loan fund, workshops, schools, a library, a theater troupe, and even arranged for religious needs, requesting the Japanese to assist in baking matzah, acquiring a Torah scroll, and tallitot, and writing greeting cards for Rosh Hashanah.

An example of Trumpeldor’s educational activities can be found in a special letter written by a Jewish prisoner to his teacher Trumpeldor: 

Being among Jewish prisoners in the camp stirred strong nationalistic feelings in Trumpeldor. Therefore, most of his activities focused on Zionism. He founded a Zionist association called &quot;Bnei Zion Captives in Japan&quot; (which included 120 members). He raised funds for Zionist causes, such as the Jewish National Fund, building a Hebrew school in Jaffa, a library in Jerusalem, and planting a forest in Herzl’s memory. In July 1905, he sent a letter of support to the Seventh Zionist Congress in Basel. Trumpeldor also helped establish a Zionist association within the small Jewish community in Japan. He published a Zionist weekly in Yiddish and Russian called &quot;Der Yiddisher Leben&quot; (&#x27;Jewish Life&#x27;), of which he was the editor and author of most articles.

In captivity, Trumpeldor began developing his social-national ideas regarding the establishment of cooperative settlements in Eretz Yisrael. To seek support for his plans, he wrote a letter from captivity to Menachem Ussishkin. He planned to immigrate to Israel with ten carefully selected individuals to establish a new settlement.

Trumpeldor was widely admired by prisoners, both Jewish and non-Jewish. Following the signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth, Trumpeldor was one of the first to be released from captivity. His friends reported that thousands came to bid him farewell at the POW camp, carrying him on their shoulders and cheering: 

The Japanese captors respected Trumpeldor’s leadership and character, and his legacy remains appreciated to this day. In 2006, an exhibition was held in Takayashi about the Russo-Japanese War POW camp. A room in the exhibition was dedicated to Trumpeldor, showcasing photos and describing his Zionist activities until his death in the Battle of Tel Hai.

=== The Zion Mule Corps ===
Trumpeldor was among the supporters and founders of the &quot;Zion Mule Corps.&quot; The Irish Colonel John Patterson was appointed as the commander of the corps, and Trumpeldor was appointed as his deputy, with the rank of Captain. The corps was transferred to Gallipoli where it participated as an auxiliary force, supplying the ANZAC troops (forces from Australia and New Zealand). Trumpeldor performed heroic acts in Gallipoli and was even injured in the shoulder by a rifle bullet.

Trumpeldor was the driving force in the corps. The corps, which suffered from severe disciplinary issues, including attempts at desertion and low morale, barely held together due to his influence and concern for the members of the corps. The corps had to endure floggings and physical punishments from British officers. In November 1915, Trumpeldor was appointed acting commander of the corps, but a month later, the British decided to disband it.

In Alexandria, upon his return from Gallipoli, Trumpeldor took French lessons from Fira (Esther) Rozov, a member of a wealthy citrus-growing family and one of the pioneers of Petach Tikva, who were also exiled to Egypt due to their foreign nationality. Fira, 22 years old and 13 years younger than Trumpeldor, quickly became his beloved and fiancée, and he shared all his secrets and emotions with her for several years, writing her numerous letters during the war that described his experiences.

In October 1916, after abandoning his efforts to rebuild the corps, Trumpeldor traveled to London to assist Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky in establishing a Jewish fighting unit. Others involved in these efforts included David Ben-Gurion, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, and Pinhas Rutenberg. Jabotinsky hoped that British Jewry would enlist en masse for a Jewish unit in the army and believed that Trumpeldor, whose reputation as a hero preceded him, could help him recruit volunteers. However, the recruitment effort failed miserably. Trumpeldor and Jabotinsky encountered severe and even violent hostility from the Jewish community, which refused to enlist. Despite the difficulties, Trumpeldor continued to advocate for the idea of the unit. He met with Chaim Weizmann, as well as with prominent opponents of the idea, such as Rabbi Joseph Hertz, the Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom, Ahad Ha&#x27;am, and Nahum Sokolow, who viewed the establishment of a Jewish military unit as inappropriate and &quot;un-Jewish.&quot;

In December 1916, 120 men from the remnants of the Zion Mule Corps arrived in London, whom Trumpeldor managed to persuade to enlist in the British army. These men ultimately formed the nucleus of the Jewish Legion, which Jabotinsky, with Trumpeldor&#x27;s active assistance, succeeded in establishing with great effort and after numerous persuasion attempts in 1917.

Trumpeldor, unable to join the unit due to his amputated arm and foreign nationality, went to Russia following the February Revolution.

===In Russia during the revolution===

In June 1917, Trumpeldor returned to Russia to work there on behalf of Zionism and the Land of Israel. His ambition this time was to recruit a Jewish force of one hundred thousand men to be sent to the front in the Caucasus or Persia and eventually reach the Land of Israel. The Russian Provisional Government viewed Trumpeldor’s grand plan favorably, but the Jewish and Zionist establishment in Russia was hesitant (at that time, the Russian army was suffering defeats on all fronts, and the likelihood of death at the front was high). In light of the growing danger of a Bolshevik uprising and the expected pogroms against Jews that might follow, Trumpeldor turned his efforts to organizing Jewish self-defense, as a first and urgent task. In December 1917, he received permission from the Bolshevik government to establish a Jewish unit of 1,000 men in Petrograd. However, the idea met resistance among the Jews, who were hesitant to take a stand in the developing Russian Civil War between the Bolsheviks and the Whites. Only about 20 men enlisted in the unit, and it was disbanded after about two months.

Trumpeldor continued his activities in organizing Jewish self-defense units in Southern Russia under the Yevsektsiya, which was anti-Zionist. However, these efforts were not successful. The Jewish self-defense units provoked the anger of the Cossack and White insurgents, and only the Red Army and the German Imperial Army, which controlled large parts of Russia, provided assistance to the Jews.

===His work in the &quot;HeHalutz&quot; organization===
Following the February Revolution, there was a revival and awakening in the Zionist movement in Russia. The number of &quot;Shekel Payers&quot; exceeded 140,000, and tens of thousands of young people aspired to immigrate to the Land of Israel. The global &quot;HeHalutz&quot; organization mobilized young people interested in immigrating to Israel and becoming pioneers. At the beginning of 1918, Trumpeldor became actively involved in the movement. He worked intensively on drafting practical plans for establishing communes (essentially kibbutzim) in the Land of Israel, forming a pioneering military organization, a labor union, and facilitating immigration. The movement adopted many of Trumpeldor’s ideas and elected him as the movement&#x27;s chairman at its first conference.

Trumpeldor organized &quot;training&quot; in Petrograd for agricultural workers, set up a loan fund, a club, and a shared residence. He then went to the Crimea and organized HeHalutz activities there as well. In August 1919, he set out once again for the Land of Israel.

===Return to the Land of Israel===
On his way to the Land of Israel, Trumpeldor stopped in Istanbul (known as &quot;Constantinople&quot; at the time). There, as usual, he helped the pioneers waiting for their turn to immigrate by providing them with employment and organizing various welfare activities. He met the Russian deserter, Captain Aryeh Bayevsky, and the two became friends. In late October 1919, Trumpeldor returned to Israel. A few months later, in March 1920, Bayevsky arrived at Jaffa Port and joined the group of pioneers, who referred him to the Water Committee. In Israel, his fiancée, Fira Rozov, awaited him, but upon his arrival, their relationship ended, likely due to a connection Trumpeldor formed in Crimea with another young woman, Emma (Nechama) Tsipkin.

Jabotinsky greeted Trumpeldor with enthusiasm. It was a tumultuous period in the country. The Zionist Commission had failed in its attempts to absorb the demobilized Jewish Legion members and to promote settlement. The Zionist Organization not only failed to encourage mass immigration but was also unable to absorb the small quota of immigrants allocated by the British authorities. This was the state of affairs when Trumpeldor returned to the Land of Israel. He assisted in preparations for the arrival of &quot;HeHalutz&quot; members from Russia and Turkey. He also contributed to the planning of the establishment of a Hebrew Navy in the Land of Israel and the purchase of a Halutz Ship for training the movement’s pioneers from the Caucasus in Seafaring and to engage in Labor Conquest at Sea. He also participated in a plan for establishing fishing villages along the coast with pioneers trained by Subbotniks brought from the Astrakhan region in the Caucasus. He viewed with distaste the party disputes between Ahdut HaAvoda and Hapoel Hatzair, writing:
Trumpeldor aspired to unite all workers under one party so that they could fight together for workers&#x27; rights in the Land of Israel. He issued a &quot;call&quot; on the matter, which gained significant attention but did not succeed in convincing HaPoel HaTzair to unite with Achdut HaAvoda. However, under the influence of his call, after his death, in Hanukkah 1920, the conference that established the General Federation of Workers in the Land of Israel was held.

He called for an increase in Aliyah:
In the midst of his struggle for cooperation among the workers&#x27; parties, Israel Shochat, one of the leaders of the Hashomer organization, asked Trumpeldor to go to the Upper Galilee and check the situation there.

===Events at Tel Hai===
In 1916, a secret agreement was signed between the United Kingdom and France regarding the division of the Ottoman Empire after the end of World War I. This agreement, known as the Sykes-Picot Agreement, included the northern Galilee (including Galilee Panhandle) in France’s sphere of influence. The agreement was renewed in September 1919, as an agreement signed between Lloyd George, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and Georges Clemenceau, the Prime Minister of France. According to this agreement, the British withdrew from areas they had captured north of a line drawn between Rosh HaNikra and Buazia near Lake Hula (just north of today&#x27;s Ayelet HaShahar).

France did not establish its rule in the region and did not send sufficient military forces, initially holding only the coastal area near Sidon. The local Arabs took advantage of the situation to rebel against French rule and even harassed the Christian villages in the area, which France had promised to protect. Numerous Bedouin gangs operated in the region, with some encouragement from the British. Four Jewish settlements in the French-controlled area were caught up in these events: the Metula colony, the groups Tel Hai and Kfar Giladi, and the founding group of the Hamara settlement. The leadership of the Yishuv debated whether to evacuate these settlements and relocate their residents to British Mandate territory or to continue holding the land. Ultimately, no decision was made, and the settlements remained in the French-controlled area.

Initially, the Arabs did not harm the Jewish settlements, but the situation later deteriorated. On November 15, 1919, Bedouins disguised as French gendarmes entered Kfar Giladi, confiscated weapons, and stole money and property. On December 12, they attacked Tel Hai, killing Shneur Shposhnik, a resident of Petach Tikva. On December 17, another attack occurred, during which the defenders of Tel Hai acknowledged their military inferiority against the rebels and awaited reinforcements. Small reinforcements of a few people and rifles arrived.

David Ben-Gurion asked Trumpeldor to organize the defense of the settlements and report on the situation. Trumpeldor arrived at Tel Hai at the end of December 1919. Bedouin attacks continued. In one incident, Trumpeldor and his men were captured, robbed, and stripped of their clothes. Following the attacks, the Hamara settlement was abandoned and was never re-established. On January 4, 1920, Bedouins attacked Hamara, where a French force was present at the time; the force retreated to Metula, and the Bedouins set Hamara on fire.

Following the French withdrawal, the defenders of Tel Hai, led by Trumpeldor, grew increasingly anxious. Their frustration grew due to the lack of support they received from the weakened Yishuv institutions and the nascent Haganah committee. On January 8, the defenders of the Galilee issued a proclamation that read, among other things:
Later that month, a large French force arrived in Metula; its Jewish residents left, and the force completely destroyed and looted the colony. In early February, the French withdrew from Metula, and the situation in the area worsened.

On February 9, 1920, Trumpeldor wrote to the Haganah Committee from Ayelet HaShahar, stating that the Arab leaders had decided &quot;to destroy and annihilate the Jewish settlement in the Upper Galilee.&quot; Trumpeldor sent a request to the Yishuv leadership for reinforcements and urgently needed supplies:
The Workers&#x27; Committee in Jaffa convened a meeting attended by David Ben-Gurion, A.Z.R., Avraham Herzfeld, and Shmuel HaPater, and it was decided to reinforce the northern defenders, but the number of people sent was small.

On February 23, 1920, the provisional Haganah committee convened to discuss the defense of the Upper Galilee. Representatives of the workers&#x27; parties, led by Berl Katznelson, supported reinforcing the defenders, while the representatives of the &quot;civilians&quot; hesitated, fearing conflict with the Arabs. Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky argued that it was impractical to defend the settlements and suggested relocating all those in the French-controlled area to British territory. The assembly decided to continue defending the settlements and to establish a committee to organize the defense and rescue the points. However, by the time the committee reached Ayelet HaShahar, it was already too late.

On 11 Adar, 5680, March 1, 1920, Arabs arrived at Tel Hai and requested entry to check if there were any French soldiers in the settlement. They were allowed entry, but then the Arabs decided to confiscate the weapons of the Tel Hai residents. When they attempted to forcibly take the weapon of Deborah Drukler, Trumpeldor ordered the defenders to open fire on the attackers. A gunfight ensued, and Trumpeldor was severely wounded in his abdomen. Those around him hesitated to tend to his wounds, as they were untrained in medical care. He ordered water, washed his hand, pushed his intestines back into his abdomen, and was bandaged. In the meantime, the attackers temporarily retreated, and Trumpeldor handed command over to Pinchas Schneerson.

The battle continued as some of the Arabs fortified themselves in the attic of Tel Hai. The defenders of Tel Hai managed to throw hand grenades and repel the attackers. Both sides suffered casualties, and in the middle of the battle, a truce was declared, allowing the Arabs to evacuate their dead and wounded. However, due to heavy losses and dwindling ammunition, a decision was made to abandon Tel Hai and retreat. The evacuation with the wounded and the bodies of the dead from the courtyard of Tel Hai took place on a stormy, rainy night, and the path was filled with mud. The decision was made to retreat from Tel Hai and regroup only at Kfar Giladi and Metula.

During the long battle, Trumpeldor, who was injured, was asked several times about his condition. The message in his responses was: These words and the important message they carried were highlighted in numerous testimonies published immediately after the battle. For example, in a letter written that same night, Avraham Herzfeld told his colleagues at the Agricultural Center that Trumpeldor said to him: &quot;It&#x27;s nothing; it&#x27;s worth dying for the Land of Israel.&quot; Dr. Gary, who treated him, also testified that Trumpeldor replied: &quot;It’s nothing; it’s worth dying for the country.&quot; Another wounded individual present next to Trumpeldor at that time recounted that &quot;when Dr. Gary asked about his condition, he said, &#x27;It is good to die for our country.&#x27;&quot; 

It is possible that this statement originated from a well-known Latin proverb: &quot;It is sweet and fitting to die for one&#x27;s country.&quot;

This statement by Trumpeldor became a symbol of supreme sacrifice and heroism for the people and the land. It became a national value on which many generations were raised. As Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said on Tel Hai Day: 

The writer Yosef Haim Brenner wrote in response to the events of Tel Hai: The Haredi-Zionist thinker Rabbi Yissachar Shlomo Teichtal also praised the pioneers building the land in his book &quot;Em HaBanim Semeicha&quot;, stating: There is also a claim that Trumpeldor&#x27;s original words were: &quot;It is good to die for the land,&quot; but those who heard him slightly altered the phrasing to more proper Hebrew.

By the time the group reached Kfar Giladi, Trumpeldor was no longer alive. The people of Kfar Giladi, fearing that the Arab and Bedouin attack would continue, did not allow the defenders of Tel Hai to sleep under their roof. They buried the fighters in a temporary mass grave. Years later, the remains were transferred to the cemetery in Kfar Giladi.

 The Galilee Panhandle remained empty of Jews for several months. In July 1920, the French expelled Faisal from Damascus, and in December 1920, France and Britain signed an agreement transferring the Galilee Panhandle to British control. Even before that, the farmers returned to Metula, and members of Hashomer and the Labor Battalion returned to Kfar Giladi and later to Tel Hai.

==Commemoration==
In memory of Trumpeldor and his comrades, eulogies were delivered from both sides of the political spectrum. The most well-known were &quot;Tel Hai&quot; by Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky, the founder of Revisionist Zionism, eight days after the battle, and &quot;Yizkor Am Yisrael&quot; by Berl Katznelson, one of the leaders of Socialist Zionism.
The story of Trumpeldor&#x27;s heroism and death became a foundational story on which generations were educated. His death defending Tel Hai immediately became a symbol of Jewish resistance, in contrast to being slaughtered in pogroms without resistance. Leaders such as Berl Katznelson, Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky, Yosef Haim Brenner, and many others eulogized him and the others who fell at Tel Hai. One of Trumpeldor&#x27;s dreams for cooperation among the workers&#x27; parties was realized in his memory on December 9, 1920, with the founding of the Histadrut.

* Trumpeldor&#x27;s trainees in the &quot;HeHalutz&quot; movement established a group of pioneers and settlers in his name, called the &quot;Labor and Defense Battalion in Memory of Joseph Trumpeldor&quot;, or simply the Labor Battalion. The battalion was founded by eighty-eight members at a memorial on the six-month anniversary of his death on 11 Elul 5680, August 25, 1920, at a camp near Hamat Tiberias.
* The kibbutz Tel Yosef, established by members of the Labor Battalion, was named after Trumpeldor. The kibbutz houses the &quot;Trumpeldor House&quot; museum, which once contained Trumpeldor&#x27;s prosthetic hand, transferred to the Zionist Archives on the 100th anniversary of his death.
* Streets in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv (which, due to its location, also includes the cemetery known as Trumpeldor Cemetery), two streets in Haifa (Joseph the One-Armed in Hadar HaCarmel and Trumpeldor Boulevard in Neve Sha&#x27;anan) as well as streets and schools in many towns across Israel bear his name. A neighborhood in Tel Aviv and one in Nahariya are also named after Trumpeldor.
* Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky, leader of the Revisionist movement and Trumpeldor’s close friend, founded the youth movement named after him – Betar: &quot;Alliance of Joseph Trumpeldor&quot;. Jabotinsky admired Trumpeldor and described their shared path. To maintain the acronym, Beitar members continue to spell the name &#x27;Trumpeldor&#x27; with a &#x27;Tet.&#x27; On the story of Tel Hai, Jabotinsky wrote the &quot;Song of the Prisoners of Acre&quot;.
* Kiryat Shmona, near the site of Trumpeldor&#x27;s and his seven comrades&#x27; deaths and burials at Tel Hai, is named after them. Initially, it was called Kiryat Yosef, after Trumpeldor.

Trumpeldor&#x27;s heroism is reflected in Berl Katznelson’s introduction to the book &quot;Events of 1936,&quot; written by Bracha Habas, where he compared the settlers&#x27; heroism in facing Arab terror during 1936–1939 to the heroism of the defenders of Tel Hai: 

On the centennial of Trumpeldor&#x27;s birth, Professor Yigal Ilam wrote: 

Many songs and stories have been written about Trumpeldor.

In Abraham Broides&#x27; song &#x27;In the Galilee,&#x27; he wrote:

The composer Emanuel Amiran wrote a piece in his honor and memory titled &quot;Joseph the Galilean&quot;, which begins with the words: 

In the spring of 1920, Abba Schneller (later Abba Hushi) read the words of a song inspired by the heroic stand of Joseph Trumpeldor and his comrades in the courtyard of Tel Hai for the first time at a conference of &quot;Hashomer Hatzair&quot; in Lviv:
Joseph Trumpeldor is buried in the cemetery of Kfar Giladi, near the graves of the Hashomer members, in a mass grave, along with the seven other fighters who were killed at Tel Hai. Above their grave stands the statue of the &quot;Roaring Lion,&quot; with the inscription &quot;It is good to die for our country.&quot; Every year on 11 Adar, school students and members of youth movements visit the grave to commemorate the battle and what it symbolizes in a state ceremony attended by a representative of the Government of Israel. The life and heroism of Captain Joseph Trumpeldor are detailed on the Yizkor website – the memorial site for the fallen of Israel&#x27;s wars, Ministry of Defense.

<text>Costabile &quot;Gus&quot; Farace, Jr. (June 21, 1960 – November 17, 1989) was an Italian American criminal and mobster who was born in Bushwick, Brooklyn and died in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. He was an associate of the Bonanno crime family who murdered a teenage male prostitute and a federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent in New York City. He was shot and killed by an unknown assailant in 1989.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Farace was born on June 21, 1960, in Bushwick, to Mary and Costabile &quot;Gus&quot; Farace, Sr., a first-generation immigrant from Camastra, Agrigento province Sicily. At the age of five he moved with his family to Prince&#x27;s Bay, Staten Island. He sometimes used the name &quot;Nicholas&quot; as an alias while a fugitive and gave several alternate dates of birth: August 20, 1959, January 1, 1960, and June 20, 1960. He stood at 6&#x27;3&quot;, weighed 220 pounds, and sported a tattoo of a girl on his lower calf, another girl tattoo on his right leg, and a butterfly on his stomach.

His father Gus opened a small grocery store, G&amp;S, in the island&#x27;s Great Kills neighborhood on Hylan Boulevard. The store closed in 1983.

Costabile, Sr. and his brother Frank were fringe members of a Colombo crime family illegal gambling ring. Farace was a paternal first cousin of Dominick Farace, the son of Frank Farace. He also was a cousin to Michael A. Farace, Michael J. Farace, and Vincent Farace. Vincent Farace is a recognized made man in the Bronx faction of the Bonanno crime family.

Costabile attended Totten Intermediate School 34 in Tottenville (the former site of Tottenville High School until it moved to its present location in 1972), where he was considered the class flirt in eighth grade. As a child he was considered the class clown, a poor student, popular, and gregarious. He played Peewee football in Wolfe&#x27;s Pond Park. In 1975, he entered Tottenville High School and joined a street gang of adolescent delinquents called &quot;the Bay Boys&quot;, named after the Upper New York Bay near Tottenville. The gang liked to intimidate people and start fights. In January 1977, he was pulled over for reckless driving and, after searching him, the police found a gun on his person. Three weeks later, he was arrested for forgery, but he avoided a jail sentence because he was a youth. He listed his occupation as a grocer.

===Assaults and Killing in Greenwich Village===
On October 7, 1979, Farace murdered a 17-year-old boy and brutally beat the victim&#x27;s 16-year-old companion. Farace and three friends were on a street in the Greenwich Village section of Manhattan when the two boys allegedly propositioned them. Enraged, Farace and his accomplices — later identified as David Spoto and Robert DeLicio — forced the two teenagers into the Farace group&#x27;s car and drove them to the beach at Wolfe&#x27;s Pond Park in Prince&#x27;s Bay, Staten Island. Once there, the men beat the boys using driftwood and other objects, then left them for dead. The 17-year-old, Steven Charles of Newark, New Jersey, died on the beach. The 16-year-old, Thomas Moore of Brooklyn, was critically injured, but dove into the pond and managed to elude his attackers. Moore then walked to a nearby residence for assistance. Later, on October 8, the police arrested Farace, DeLicio, and Spoto. Four days later, Moore identified Farace and the other suspects from a police lineup.

On December 10, 1979, Farace pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter. The state had accepted his manslaughter plea rather than go through the uncertainty and expense of a trial, and of even winning a conviction in virulently anti-gay Staten Island (they particularly feared that Farace and his co-defendants would use the &quot;gay panic defense&quot;). Farace was sentenced to 7 to 21 years in prison.

===Relationship with organized crime===
It was in prison that Farace first met Gerrard &quot;Jerry&quot; Chilli, Sr. As Robert Stutman writes in &quot;Dead on Delivery&quot;: &quot;Blamed for some infraction of the inmate’s code, Petrucelli was about to be killed with a set of barbells in a weight room brawl when Farace interceded, saving his life.&quot; Chilli unofficially &quot;adopted&quot; Farace, who at that point was in his late twenties, as a protégé, and stayed in contact when Chilli got out of prison. Farace used his contacts with old friends, and new ones he met in prison, to start a marijuana selling business, which soon expanded into other drugs. In June 1988, Farace was released from prison. By June 3, 1988, Farace had become partners with his friend Gregory Scarpa, Jr. who worked out of his criminal headquarters at Wimpy Boys Athletic Club. Scarpa&#x27;s father, Gregory Scarpa, Sr., was a secret FBI informer. Farace married Antoinette Acierno, a sister of a criminal associate.

===Murder of DEA Agent Hatcher===
After being released on parole on June 3, 1988, Farace soon got into trouble again. He began selling small amounts of cocaine and marijuana, and in late February 1989, set up a cocaine deal with Everett Hatcher, an undercover federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent. At approximately 10:00 p.m. on the evening of February 28, 1989, Farace was to meet Hatcher at a remote overpass on the West Shore Expressway in the Rossville section of Staten Island to complete the deal. Hatcher had met Farace to discuss purchasing cocaine from him on several occasions. During the course of the drug transaction, Hatcher got separated from the surveillance team. When the team finally found Hatcher, he had been shot through the head three times in his unmarked Buick Regal. The window was rolled down and the Regal&#x27;s engine was on, but Hatcher&#x27;s foot was on the brake.

Police theorized that Farace shot Hatcher from a van as it passed Hatcher&#x27;s car. The van was found abandoned three days later on a street about two miles northeast of the murder scene. This location was less than half a mile from the Arthur Kill Correctional Facility, where Farace had spent the last two years of his manslaughter sentence. It is not known why Farace killed Hatcher; one theory is that Farace had become suspicious of Hatcher from rumors he had heard.

===Manhunt===
Hatcher&#x27;s death was the first murder of a DEA agent in New York City since 1972. He was also believed to have been the first law enforcement officer killed in the line of duty on Staten Island.

After Hatcher&#x27;s slaying, a nationwide manhunt for Farace commenced. The Federal Bureau of Investigation placed Farace on the Ten Most Wanted list. Local and federal law enforcement increased their surveillance of Cosa Nostra members, stopping them to take photographs and ask questions. As pressure increased on the Bonanno family, its leadership decided to kill Farace.

Following the Hatcher murder, Gregory Scarpa, Sr. told David Krajcek of the &quot;Daily News&quot; that the Farace and Scarpa families were no longer close. No one from the Scarpa family had gone to Farace&#x27;s wedding to Toni Acierno a few months earlier. Scarpa feared that a strong connection would send his convicted drug dealer son, Gregory Jr., to a distant federal prison.

Meanwhile, Farace was hiding with friends and criminal associates around the Greater New York area. He first stayed with Margaret &quot;Babe&quot; Scarpa, an old girlfriend who was Chilli&#x27;s daughter. Soon after Farace had departed, the police raided Scarpa&#x27;s house and arrested her; at the scene, DEA official Stutman told Chilli he could blame Farace. At this point, an aggravated Chilli wanted Farace killed. A new mob associate with the Lucchese family, John Petrucelli, was helping Farace find places to hide. Chilli met with Petrucelli and Lucchese capo Mike Salerno to discuss the situation. Chilli demanded that Petrucelli kill Farace, but Petrucelli refused. Two months later, Petrucelli was found dead with a hood over his head, which is a Sicilian message for &quot;never keep secrets from the family&quot;.

===Shooting and death===
Less than ten months after the Hatcher murder, the manhunt for Farace would be over. At 11:08 p.m. on November 17, 1989, police dispatchers received a 9-1-1 emergency call about a car parked at 1814 81st Street in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. The car contained one male occupant, with another male lying face down on the sidewalk, both of whom had just been shot. (The call came in as &quot;shots fired&quot;, no other specifics.)

Police rushed to the scene and found the two men, one dead and the other seriously wounded. The dead man was identified as Costabile Farace. He had gunshot wounds to the head, neck, back and leg. According to witnesses, a van had driven alongside Farace&#x27;s car and shot the two men nine times. This was the same method Farace had used to kill Agent Hatcher. The survivor in the car was identified as Joseph Sclafani, a member of Farace&#x27;s organization. Sclafani said he fired two shots at the assailants. 

In a different version of this story, per the responding officer, Farace was still breathing when police arrived. They placed him in a trauma suite, but he died &quot;en route&quot; to the hospital. Sclafani was outside of the vehicle, having been shot out of his shoes. Officers handcuffed him on the scene for weapons possession.

===Aftermath===
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York refused to grant Farace a public funeral mass, citing his notorious life and death. However, the Archdiocese did permit his remains to be buried in the church-owned Cemetery of the Resurrection in Pleasant Plains, Staten Island, the same area where Hatcher was murdered.

On September 17, 1997, Lucchese family soldier James Galione and Lucchese family associate Mario Gallo admitted in court to murdering Farace. A third mobster, Louis Tuzzio, who was slain in 1990, was the third member of their team. Daniel &quot;Dirty Danny&quot; Mongelli was convicted of killing Tuzzio in 2004 and was released from prison in 2020 after catching COVID-19.

A made-for-TV movie, &quot;Dead or Alive: The Race for Gus Farace&quot; (1991) starred Tony Danza as Farace. The movie alleged that the mob was trying to kill Farace before the FBI could apprehend him. The movie &quot;Out For Justice&quot; starring Steven Seagal was based on Gus Farace&#x27;s manhunt.

<text>Nia Tsholofelo Künzer (born 18 January 1980) is a retired German women&#x27;s football player.

==Early life==
She was born in Mochudi, Botswana, as Nia Tsholofelo Künzer (her first name being Swahili for &quot;aim&quot; or &quot;intention&quot; and her second name being Tswana for &quot;hope&quot;), where her parents were on a two-year tour with a development aid organization. She grew up in the Albert-Schweitzer-Kinderdorf (children&#x27;s village) in Wetzlar-Garbenheim, alongside her brother and seven foster children. After the Abitur, she did a year of practical training in social work in a kindergarten for handicapped children. In 2008, she completed a degree in education science (German title &quot;Diplompädagogin&quot;) at the Justus Liebig University Giessen.

==Career==
Having a history as a high jumper, and after being a member of football clubs Eintracht Wetzlar and VfB Gießen she was with 1. FFC Frankfurt (1st Frankfurt Women&#x27;s Football Club) starting 1997. She played as a defender or midfielder. Künzer retired in July 2008 from professional football after an injury.

==International career==
Künzer was part of the German women&#x27;s national football team at the 2003 World Cup. Her &quot;golden goal&quot; in the final match against Sweden made Germany the winner of the tournament with a result of 2-1. The goal was to become the first ever women&#x27;s &quot;Goal of the Year&quot; in the history of German football. In 2004, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) voted to abolish the &quot;golden goal&quot; rule (taking effect on 1 July 2004), and the tie-breaking format was established, with teams playing two straight 15-minute extra time periods before the game goes to penalty kicks. Künzer&#x27;s winning goal is the only &quot;golden goal&quot; to decide a Women&#x27;s World Cup final.

She actively promotes the idea of women&#x27;s soccer and helps in recruiting from the next generation of enthusiastic young girls.

During the winter of 2003/2004 she had to pause for several weeks due to one more cruciate ligament injury, which meant she was not available for the Olympic Games 2004 in Athens, Greece. A fourth cruciate ligament injury forced Künzer to resign from the national team in 2006.

==TV career==
Künzer also works as a TV sports commentator. She is Das Erste&#x27;s main pundit for their comprehensive coverage of games involving the national team as well as for major women&#x27;s tournaments like World Cups, Euros and the Algarve Cup.

In 2012, it was shortened to Best Jazz Instrumental Album, encompassing albums that previously fell under the categories Best Contemporary Jazz Album and Best Latin Jazz Album (both defunct as of 2012). A year later, the Best Latin Jazz Album category returned, disallowing albums in that category to be nominated for Best Jazz Instrumental Album.

This category is meant for albums containing greater than 50% playing time of new instrumental jazz recordings.

Years listed indicate the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for works released in the previous year. Before 1962 and from 1972 to 1978, the award title did not specify instrumental performances and was presented for instrumental or vocal performances. The award has had several name changes.

<text>The Enterprise is a Bermuda rigged sailing dinghy with a double-chined hull and distinctive blue sails. Normally crewed by two, and sometimes carrying a third crew member, it may also be sailed single-handed.

==History==
The Enterprise was designed by Jack Holt in 1956 for The News Chronicle during the post-war sailing boom, becoming the first UK sailing dinghy to be sponsored by a national newspaper (followed in due course by the Mirror Dinghy, also designed by Jack Holt). It remains popular in the United Kingdom and a dozen or so other countries, for cruising and racing. Adopted by many sailing schools, the Enterprise&#x27;s combination of size, weight, and power has widespread appeal. The Enterprise is accredited as an International Class by the International Sailing Federation, the ISAF. 

The Enterprise is most often sailed with no spinnaker. However the international class rules allow the decision of whether to allow spinnakers to be made by the national authority. In the U.K. and Canada, no spinnakers were allowed until 2002 when a new PY handicap was introduced in the UK to allow spinnakers to be used in multi class racing in clubs, although spinnakers may still not be used in &quot;Class&quot; racing; in the United States they are allowed.

Early boats, wooden and GRP, used buoyancy bags fixed under the benches and thwarts for internal buoyancy but nowadays foam reinforced plastic boats have built in buoyancy tanks improving stiffness and removing much of the maintenance associated with air-filled bags. Wooden boats still tend to have buoyancy bags to the rear and a forward bulkhead.

They are also relatively unstable in comparison with other dinghies of similar performance, they have handling characteristics which would generally be associated with much faster designs.

The first two Enterprises built were sailed from Dover to Calais both as a test and for advertising purposes. This feat was repeated on the Enterprise&#x27;s 50th anniversary, but this time the two boats not only sailed to France, but also returned to England.

<text>The Tura (; ), also known as Dolgaya (Long River, ) is a historically important Siberian river which flows eastward from the central Ural Mountains into the Tobol, a part of the Ob basin. The main town on it is Tyumen.

==Description==
From about 1600 to 1750 the Tura was the main entry point into Siberia. Most people and goods entering or leaving passed through the customs house at Verkhoturye. There are a number of mining towns in the upper Tura basin.

===Geography===
It is located in the Sverdlovsk Oblast and Tyumen Oblast in Russia. It is long with a drainage basin of . The Tura is navigable within of its mouth. It freezes up in late October through November and stays under the ice until April or the first half of May.

The Tura basin is bounded on the west by the Ural Mountains with the city of Perm, on the north by the Tavda basin, on the east by the Tobol with the city of Tobolsk and on the south by the Iset basin with the city of Yekaterinburg.

The Tura flows north through Verkhnyaya Tura and Nizhnyaya Tura, receives an east-flowing river from the mining town of Kachkanar, flows east past Verkhoturye, turns east-southeast, receives the Tagil from the west, passes Turinsk, receives the east-flowing Nitsa, passes Tyumen, turns directly east, receives the east-flowing Pyshma from the south and joins the Tobol River southwest of Tobolsk.

The Tura basin is fan-shaped with the Tura on the north side and the Pyshma on the south.

<doc id="496919" wikidata="Q78879" url="?curid=496919" title="Kolyma (river)">
<text>The Kolyma (, ; ) is a river in northeastern Siberia, whose basin covers parts of the Sakha Republic, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, and Magadan Oblast of Russia. 

The Kolyma is frozen to depths of several metres for about 250 days each year, becoming free of ice only in early June, until October.

==Course==
The Kolyma begins at the confluence of the Kulu and the Ayan-Yuryakh (Kolyma a natural continuation of Ayan-Yuryakh). The confluence happens in the Okhotsk-Kolyma Upland (Охотско-Колымское нагорье), which lies within the watershed that separates the Kolyma basin and the basins of rivers flowing into the Sea of Okhotsk. Kolyma flows across the Upper Kolyma Highlands roughly southwards in its upper course. Leaving the mountainous areas it flows roughly northwards across the Kolyma Lowland, a vast plain dotted with thousands of lakes, part of the greater East Siberian Lowland. 
The river empties into the Kolyma Gulf of the East Siberian Sea, a division of the Arctic Ocean. 

The Kolyma is long. The area of its basin is . The average discharge at Kolymskoye is , with a high of reported in June 1985, and a low of in April 1979.

===Tributaries===
The main tributaries of the Kolyma are, from source to mouth:

*Ayan-Yuryakh (left)
*Kulu (right)

===Islands===
In the last stretch, the Kolyma divides into two large branches. There are many islands at the mouth of the Kolyma before it meets the East Siberian sea. The main ones are:

*Mikhalkino is the largest island, it lies to the west of the Kolyma&#x27;s eastern branch, the Kamennaya Kolyma anabranch. This island breaks up into smaller islands on its northern end. It is long and wide. Mikhalkino is also known as &quot;Glavsevmorput Island&quot; after the Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route.
*Sukharnyy, or Sukhornyy, is 3 kilometres from the northeastern shores of Mikhalkino. It is long and about wide. Northeast of Sukhornyy lies a cluster of small islands known as the Morskiye Sotki Islands.
*Piat&#x27; Pal&#x27;tsev lies 5 kilometres to the southeast of Sukhornyy&#x27;s southern end. It is 5 kilometres long and has a maximum width of 1.8 kilometres.
*Nazarovsky Island lies on the western side of the Kolyma&#x27;s western branch, the Prot. Pokhodskaya Kolyma, in an area where there are many small islands. It is 4.5 kilometres long and 1.3 kilometres wide.
*Shtormovoy Island lies offshore, about to the north of Nazarovsky Island. Shtormovoy is the northernmost island off the Mouths of the Kolyma. It is 4.3 kilometres long and 1.5 kilometres wide.

==History==

In 1640 Dimitry Zyryan (also called Yarilo or Yerilo) went overland to the Indigirka. In 1641 he sailed down the Indigirka, went east and up the Alazeya. Here they heard of the Kolyma and met Chukchis for the first time. In 1643 he returned to the Indigirka, sent his &quot;yasak&quot; (tribute) to Yakutsk and went back to the Alazeya. In 1645 he returned to the Lena where he met a party and learned that he had been appointed &quot;prikazchik&quot; (land administrator) of the Kolyma. He returned east and died in early 1646. In the winter of 1641–42 Mikhail Stadukhin, accompanied by Semyon Dezhnyov, went overland to the upper Indigirka. He spent the next winter there, built boats and sailed down the Indigirka and east to the Alazeya where he met Zyryan. Zyryan and Dezhnyov stayed at the Alazeya, while Stadukhin went east, reaching the Kolyma in the summer of 1644. They built a &quot;zimovye&quot; (winter cabin), probably at Srednekolymsk, and returned to Yakutsk in late 1645.

In 1892–94 Baron Eduard Von Toll carried out geological surveys in the basin of the Kolyma (among other Far-eastern Siberian rivers) on behalf of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Barr, 1980). During one year and two days the expedition covered , of which were up rivers, carrying out geodesic surveys en route.

The Kolyma is known for its Gulag labour camps and gold mining, both of which have been extensively documented since Joseph Stalin–era Soviet archives opened. The river gives its title to a famous anthology about life in Gulag camps by Varlam Shalamov, &quot;The Kolyma Tales&quot;.

After the camps were closed, state subsidies, local industries and communication dwindled to almost nothing. Many people have migrated, but those who remain in the area make a living by fishing and hunting. In small fishing settlements, fish are sometimes stored in caves carved from permafrost. The last Americans to visit the Kolyma during the Soviet era, before &quot;perestroika&quot;, were the crew of the sailing schooner &quot;Nanuk&quot; in August 1929, whose visit was captured in a film taken by the &quot;Nanuk&quot; owner&#x27;s 18-year-old daughter, Marion Swenson. The first two Americans to visit the Kolyma after the &quot;Nanuk&quot;&#x27;s visit were writer Wallace Kaufman and journalist Rebecca Clay, who traveled by cutter from Ziryanka to Green Cape in August 1991. Kaufman and his daughter Sylvan and CPA Letty Collins Magdanz also travelled part of the Kolyma in August 1992, the first American visitors since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Both trips were arranged by North-East Scientific and Industrial Center: Ecocenter to try out an ecotourism route which was found to be impractical. In February 2012, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that scientists had grown plants from 30,000-year-old &quot;Silene stenophylla&quot; fruit, which was stored in squirrel burrows near the banks of the Kolyma river and preserved in permafrost.

==Settlements==
Settlements at the Kolyma river include (listed downstream) Sinegorye, Debin, Ust-Srednekan, Seymchan, Zyryanka, Srednekolymsk and Chersky.

==Constructions==

The Kolyma Hydroelectric Station is a hydropower plant at Sinegorye, downstream from the Kolyma Reservoir in the upper part of the river. The plant was started in the 1980s by Kolyma Gestroi and both the plant and the town of Sinegorye were built under the supervision of chief engineer Oleg Kogadovski. The town included an olympic sized swimming pool, an underground rifle range, and many amenities absent in most other small Russian towns. Kogadovski said that in order to attract and employ good talent in such a remote place, the town had to be exceptional. The dam provides most of the electricity to the region including Magadan. the Kolyma dam is an earthen dam some 150 ft high. Air circulation tubes carry frigid winter air into the core of the dam where frozen earth stabilizes the structure. Kolyma Ges. said it was the largest dam ever built in a permafrost region. In 1992 a new hydropower plant was under construction at Ust-Srednekan, the Ust-Srednekan Hydroelectric Plant. Larch forests cleared for the reservoir were cut in winter when the trunks were frozen and easily snapped. The wood was sold for pulp.

There are only a few bridges over the river, including at Ust-Srednekan, at Sinegorye and at Debin (which carries the Kolyma Highway).

<text>The Northern March or North March () was created out of the division of the vast &quot;Marca Geronis&quot; in 965. It initially comprised the northern third of the &quot;Marca&quot; (roughly corresponding to the modern state of Brandenburg) and was part of the territorial organisation of areas conquered from the Wends. A Lutician rebellion in 983 reversed German control over the region until the establishment of the March of Brandenburg by Albert the Bear in the 12th century.

== Slavic background ==

During the Migration Period, many Germanic peoples began migrating towards the Roman frontier. In the northeast they were replaced primarily by Slavic peoples (Veleti, later Lutici). The first Slavs were certainly in the Brandenburg area by 720, after the arrival of the Avars in Europe. These Slavs had come via Moravia, where they had arrived in the mid-seventh century. The remnants of the Germanic Semnoni were absorbed into these Slavic groups. 

The group of people who settled at the Spree river became known as Sprevani. They settled east of the line formed by the Havel and Nuthe rivers, in the current Barnim and Teltow regions. They built their main fortification at the confluence of the Spree and the Dahme rivers at Köpenick. The Hevelli lived west of that line, in the current Havelland and Zauche regions. They were named &quot;Habelli&quot; for the ancient Germanic name of the river &quot;Habula&quot; (Havel). The name for themselves was the &quot;Stodoranie&quot;. They built their main fortification at &quot;Brenna&quot; (modern Brandenburg). The Hevelli also built a large outpost at the current site of Spandau Citadel in Berlin. The Sprevani and Hevelli waged war against not only their German neighbors, but also their Slavic neighbours.

== History of the Northern March ==

=== Establishment and loss, 965–983 ===
After the Saxon War of 808, the victorious Charlemagne bestowed on the Slavic tribes allied with him (such as the Obotrites) part of the Saxon lands between the Elbe and the Baltic Sea. A period of quiet followed in the region. The Bishoprics of Brandenburg and Havelberg were established around 940 and the Christianisation of the pagan Slavs began.

Henry I of Germany conquered Brandenburg in 928–929 and imposed tribute upon the tribes up to the Oder. By 948 his son Otto I had established German control over the many remaining pagans, who were collectively referred to as Slavs or Wends by contemporaries. Slavic settlements such as Brenna (Brandenburg), Budišin (Bautzen), and Chotebuž (Cottbus) came under German control through the installation of margraves. The main function of the margravial office was to defend and protect the marches (frontier districts) of the Kingdom of Germany. After the death of the margrave Gero the Great in 965, the vast collection of marches (a &quot;super-march&quot;) was divided by Otto into five smaller commands. The Northern March was one of these. The others were the Eastern March, the March of Merseburg, the March of Meissen, and the March of Zeitz.

The rebellion of 983, initiated by the Lutici, led to a factual disestablishment of the Northern and Billung marches as well as the corresponding bishoprics, though titular margraves and bishops were still appointed. Until the collapse of the Liutizi alliance in the middle of the 11th century, the German expansion in the direction of the Northern March remained at a standstill and the Wends east of the Elbe remained independent for approximately 150 years.

=== March of Brandenburg ===

In the beginning of the 12th century, the German kings re-established control over the mixed Slav-inhabited lands on the eastern borders of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1134, in the wake of the Wendish Crusade of 1147, the German magnate Albert the Bear was granted the Northern March by Emperor Lothair III. The Slavs were subsequently assimilated by German settlers during the Ostsiedlung. The church under Albert established dioceses, which with their walled towns protected the townspeople from attack. With the arrival of monks and bishops begins anew the recorded history of the town of Brandenburg, from which would develop the eponymous margraviate.

Albert&#x27;s control of the region was nominal for several decades, but he engaged in a variety of military and diplomatic actions against the Wends, and saw his control become more real by the middle of the century. In 1150, Albert formally inherited Brandenburg from its last Hevelli ruler, the Christian Pribislav. Albert and his Ascanian descendants made considerable progress in Christianising the captured lands.

== List of margraves ==
The Margraves of the Nordmark were closely related to both the Counts of Stade, many holding dual titles, and the Counts of Walbeck. The early counts and margraves were discussed by Thietmar of Merseburg, a descendant of the original rulers.

=== Counts of Haldensleben ===
*Dietrich, 965–983, possibly the son of Wichman the Elder, an early Count of Stade
=== Counts of Walbeck === 
*Lothair I, 983–1003, the first margrave of the House of Walbeck, and son of Lothar II the Old, Count of Walbeck
*Werner, 1003–1009, son of the previous and cousin of Thietmar of Merseburg
=== Counts of Haldensleben ===
*Bernard I, 1009–1018, son of Dietrich
*Bernard II, 1018–1051, son of the previous
*William, 1051–1056, son of the previous
*Otto, 1056–1057, illegitimate son of Bernard 
=== Counts of Stade ===
*Lothair Udo I, 1056–1057, also Count of Stade (as Lothair Udo II), first of the House of Udonids, and son of Siegfried II, Count of Stade
*Lothair Udo II, 1057–1082, also Count of Stade (as Lothair Udo III), son of the previous
*Henry I the Long, 1082–1087, also Count of Stade (as Henry III the Long), son of the previous
*Lothair Udo III, 1087–1106, also Count of Stade (as Lothair Udo IV), brother of the previous
*Rudolf I, 1106–1112, also Count of Stade, brother of the previous
=== Counts of Plötzkau ===
*Helperich von Plötzkau, 1112–1114, nondynastic, but part of the House of Walbeck as grandson of Conrad, Count of Walbeck
=== Counts of Stade ===
*Henry II, 1114–1128, son of Lothair Udo III
*Udo IV, 1128–1130, son of Rudolf I
=== Counts of Plötzkau ===
*Conrad, 1130–1133, son of Helperich
=== Counts of Stade ===
*Rudolf II, 1133–1134, son of Rudolf I and the last of the House of Udonids
=== Counts of Ballenstedt (Ascanians) ===
*Albert the Bear, 1134–1170

Under Albert, the march was expanded with the acquisition of Slavic lands around Brandenburg in 1157. The expanded march became a hereditary possession of Albert&#x27;s house, the Ascanians, and was called the March of Brandenburg.

<text>A variety of eating utensils have been used by people to aid eating when dining. Most societies traditionally use bowls or dishes to contain food to be eaten, but while some use their hands to deliver this food to their mouths, others have developed specific tools for the purpose. In Western cultures, cutlery items such as knives and forks are the traditional norm, while in much of the East, chopsticks are more common. Spoons are ubiquitous.

==History==

In some cultures, such as Ethiopian and Indian, hands alone are used or bread takes the place of non-edible utensils. In others, such as Japanese and Chinese, where bowls of food are more often raised to the mouth, little modification from the basic pair of chopsticks and a spoon has taken place. Western culture has taken the development and specialization of eating utensils further, with the result that multiple utensils may appear in a dining setting, each with a different name and purpose. With the evolution of people&#x27;s eating habits, further modification continues to take place, mostly in the West.

==List of utensil types==
* Spoon – List of types of spoons
* Fork – Western/Southeast Asian utensils
* Knife
* Chopsticks – East and Southeast Asian utensil
* Skewer
* Tongs
* Toothpick
* Cocktail stick
* Drinking straw
* Cutlery – A set of Western utensils: usually knife, fork and spoon
* Sujeo – A paired set of Korean utensils: a spoon and chopsticks
* Food pusher - a utensil with a blade set at 90° to the handle, used for pushing food onto a spoon or fork

===Utensils for specific foods===

Some utensils are designed for eating or preparing specific foods:
* Butter knife
* Cake fork
* Soup spoon
* Crab cracker
* Crab fork
* Fish knife
* Fondue fork
* Grapefruit knife
* Grapefruit spoon
* Lobster pick
* Snail tongs and forks
* Nutcracker
* Ice cream scoop
* Tongs for:
** Sugar
** Asparagus
* Honey dipper
* Meat claws (used to shred barbecue meats such as brisket)

===Combination utensils===

Over time, traditional utensils have been modified in various ways in attempts to make eating more convenient or to reduce the total number of utensils required. These are typically called combination utensils.
* Chopfork – A utensil with a fork at one end and chopsticks/tongs at the other.
* Chork – Pointed and slightly curved tongs, which can be used like chopsticks (as pincers) or as a fork (for spearing). A different kind of chork is a fork with a split handle, which can be broken in half to make two chopsticks.
* Forkchops – Used in a pair, these are basically a pair of chopsticks with a small fork and knife on the non-pointed ends.
* Spoon and Chopstick Hybrid – Pointed and slightly curved tongs, which can be used like chopsticks or as a spoon.
* Knife and Chopstick Hybrid – Pointed and slightly curved tongs, which can be used like chopsticks or as a knife.
* Knork – A knife with a single tine, sharpened or serrated, set into the anterior end of the blade. 
* Pastry fork – A fork with a cutting edge along one of the tines.
* Spifork - A utensil consisting of a spoon, knife, and fork.
* Spoon straw – A scoop-ended drinking straw intended for slushies and milkshakes.
* Sporf – A utensil consisting of a spoon on one end, a fork on the other, and edge tines that are sharpened or serrated.
* Spork – Spoon and fork
* Splayd – Spoon and fork and knife
* Spife – Spoon and knife.
* FRED - Can opener, bottle opener, and spoon combination issued by the Australian Defence Force.

===Disposable utensils===
Prepackaged products may come with a utensil intended to be consumed or discarded after using it to consume the product. For instance, some single-serve ice cream is sold with a flat wooden spade, often erroneously called a &quot;spoon&quot;, to lift the product to one&#x27;s mouth. Prepackaged tuna salad or cracker snacks may contain a flat plastic spade for similar purposes.

<text>A kitchen utensil is a hand-held, typically small tool that is designed for food-related functions. Food preparation utensils are a specific type of kitchen utensil, designed for use in the preparation of food. Some utensils are both food preparation utensils and eating utensils; for instance some implements of cutlery – especially knives – can be used for both food preparation in a kitchen and as eating utensils when dining (though most types of knives used in kitchens are unsuitable for use on the dining table).

In the Western world, utensil invention accelerated in the 19th and 20th centuries. It was fuelled in part by the emergence of technologies such as the kitchen stove and refrigerator, but also by a desire to save time in the kitchen, in response to the demands of modern lifestyles.

<text>Ueda Akinari or Ueda Shūsei (, July 25, 1734 in Osaka – August 8, 1809 in Kyoto) was a Japanese author, scholar and &quot;waka&quot; poet, and a prominent literary figure in 18th-century Japan. He was an early writer in the &quot;yomihon&quot; genre and his two masterpieces, &quot;Ugetsu Monogatari&quot; (&quot;Tales of Rain and the Moon&quot;) and &quot;Harusame Monogatari&quot; (&quot;Tales of Spring Rain&quot;), are central to the canon of Japanese literature.

==Biography==
Born to an Osaka prostitute and an unknown father, Ueda was adopted in his fourth year by a wealthy merchant who reared him in comfort and provided him with a good education. As a child he became gravely ill with smallpox, and although he survived, he was left with deformed fingers on both hands. During his illness, his parents prayed to the god of the Kashima Inari Shrine, and Ueda felt that this deity had intervened and saved his life. Throughout his life he remained a strong believer in the supernatural, and this belief seems to inform important elements of his literature and scholarship such as his most famous work, a collection of ghost stories titled &quot;Ugetsu Monogatari&quot;.

He inherited the Ueda family oil and paper business when his adoptive father died. However, he was not a successful merchant, and he lost the business to a fire after running it unhappily for ten years. During this time, he published several humorous stories in the &quot;ukiyo-zōshi&quot; style, literally translated as &quot;tales of the floating world&quot;.

Taking the fire as opportunity to leave the business world, Ueda began studying medicine under , who in addition to teaching Ueda to be a doctor also taught him about colloquial Chinese fiction. In 1776 he began to practice medicine and also published &quot;Ugetsu Monogatari&quot;. This work places Ueda alongside Takizawa Bakin among the most prominent writers of &quot;yomihon&quot; — a new genre that represented a dramatic change in reading practices from the popular fiction that came before it.

In addition to his fiction, Ueda was involved in the field of research known as &quot;kokugaku&quot;, the study of philology and classical Japanese literature. &quot;Kokugaku&quot; was often typified by a rejection of foreign influences on Japanese culture, notably Chinese language, Buddhism and Confucianism. Ueda took a highly independent position within these circles, and his vigorous polemical dispute with the leading scholar of the movement, Motoori Norinaga, is recorded in the latter&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Kagaika&quot; (&quot;呵刈葭&quot; 1787–1788). Some argue that Ueda also worked out this conflict in stories such as those appearing in &quot;Ugetsu Monogatari&quot; by beginning his stories grounded on Chinese stories and moral and intellectual discourses and that he then foregrounded a Japanese sensibility by calling on supernatural elements and having his characters feel deep emotion (as opposed to Chinese reliance on the intellect).

In the years after his wife&#x27;s death in 1798 he experienced temporary blindness, and although eventually sight returned to his left eye from that point on he had to dictate much of his writing. It was at this time that he began working on his second &quot;yomihon&quot;, and he finished the first two stories of what would be &quot;Harusame Monogatari&quot; (&quot;Tales of the Spring Rain&quot;) in around 1802. &quot;Harusame&quot; is quite different from &quot;Ugetsu Monogatari&quot;. Among other differences, &quot;Harusame&quot; does not invoke the supernatural, and the stories are of greatly varied length. The story titled &quot;Hankai&quot; is about a disreputable ruffian who suddenly converts to Buddhism and spends the rest of his life as a monk.

In 1809, Ueda died at the age of 76 in Kyoto.

==Modern References==
Ueda Akinari is discussed in Haruki Murakami&#x27;s &quot;Killing Commendatore&quot;. The main character in Murakami&#x27;s novel shares Akinari&#x27;s experience of the supernatural. Akinari&#x27;s story &quot;Fate Over Two Generations&quot; plays out in modern-day in Murakami&#x27;s novel.

Indian Filmmaker AK Srikanth&#x27;s film &#x27;Dvija&#x27; (2022) is said to be inspired by Ueda Akinari&#x27;s work.

<text>Áramótaskaupið (&quot;The New Year&#x27;s Lampoon&quot;) is an annual Icelandic television comedy special, broadcast on New Year&#x27;s Eve by the state public service broadcaster RÚV. Initially aired on radio in 1948, and later moving to television in 1966, it features sketches satirizing the news events of the past year.

It is often the highest-rated television broadcast of the year in Iceland. In 2002, it was reported that the special had been seen by 95.5% of the country; Páll Magnússon, CEO of RÚV stated that this was most likely a record in the Western world. Due to its high viewership, advertising time during &quot;Áramótaskaupið&quot; is the most expensive on Icelandic television. The show ends just before midnight, and those Icelanders who shoot off fireworks usually do so after &quot;Áramótaskaupið&quot; ends.

Some of its sketches have become well known in Icelandic culture, such as its portrayal of Minister of Finance Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson as the Batman parody &quot;Skattmann&quot; (&quot;Taxman&quot;). In 2009, the show featured a sketch about the protests following the 2008 Icelandic financial crisis, in which Jón Gnarr played a strait-laced middle-aged protester shouting &quot;Helvítis fokking fokk!!&quot;. The phrase swiftly became widely used in Iceland in relation to the crisis.

<doc id="496937" wikidata="Q1261335" url="?curid=496937" title="Yoji Yamada">
<text>is a Japanese film director best known for his &quot;Otoko wa Tsurai yo&quot; series of films and his Samurai Trilogy (&quot;The Twilight Samurai&quot;, &quot;The Hidden Blade&quot; and &quot;Love and Honor&quot;).

==Biography==
Yamada was born in Osaka, but due to his father&#x27;s job as an engineer for the South Manchuria Railway, he was brought up in Dalian, China, from the age of two. Following the end of World War II, he returned to Japan and subsequently lived in Yamagata Prefecture. After receiving his degree from Tokyo University in 1954, he entered Shochiku and worked under Yoshitaro Nomura as a scriptwriter and as an assistant director.

Yamada won many awards throughout his long career and is well respected in Japan and by critics throughout the world. He wrote his first screenplay in 1958 and directed his first movie in 1961. Yamada continues to make movies to this day. He once served as president of the Directors Guild of Japan, and is currently a guest professor of Ritsumeikan University.

==Tora-san series==

Known in Japan under the title &quot;Otoko wa Tsurai yo&quot;, his Tora-san series features traveling merchant Torajirō, who is always unlucky in love. Since the lead role in every Tora-san movie was played by Kiyoshi Atsumi, his death in 1996 put an end to the series and Yamada moved on to other movies. Although Yamada is known for his long-running series of movies—four films in the &quot;A Class to Remember&quot; series, 13 in the &quot;Free and Easy&quot; (&quot;Tsuribaka Nisshi&quot;) series—none has reached the prolific numbers of the Tora-san series. Over a period of about 25 years, 48 Tora-san films were made, all of them starring Atsumi, and the majority written and directed by Yamada.

==Notable awards==
His movies have won the Best Picture award at the Japanese Academy Awards four times: in 1977 for &quot;The Yellow Handkerchief&quot;, in 1991 for &quot;My Sons&quot;, in 1993 for &quot;A Class to Remember&quot;, and in 2002 for &quot;The Twilight Samurai&quot;, which was nominated for the 76th Academy Awards&#x27; Best Foreign Language Film. He won the Japan Academy Prize for Director of the Year three times. His 1984 film, &quot;Tora-san&#x27;s Forbidden Love&quot;, was nominated for the Golden Prize at the 14th Moscow International Film Festival.

His 2004 film, &quot;The Hidden Blade&quot;, was nominated for sixteen awards and won three. In 2010, Yamada was honored at the 2010 Berlin Film Festival with a screening of his latest film &quot;Otōto&quot; during the awards ceremony, as well as receiving a &quot;Berlinale Camera&quot; award for his numerous contributions to the festival&#x27;s program.

<text>Maykop is the capital city of Adygea, Russia, located on the right bank of the Belaya River. It borders Maykopsky District, from which it is administratively and municipally independent, to the east and south; Giaginsky District to the north, and Belorechensky District of Krasnodar Krai to the west.

Population: 

==History==
The city gave its name to the early Bronze Age Maykop culture after the discovery of a royal burial site there in 1897.

Following the establishment of a military camp in 1825, the Imperial Russian Army built a military fort at Maykop in 1857.

In 1910 oil deposits were discovered in the vicinity of Maykop. The city was the administrative center of the Maykopsky Otdel of the Kuban Oblast.

In 1936, Maykop and the surrounding region merged with Adyghe Autonomous Oblast and became the administrative centre of the autonomy. The Wehrmacht occupied Maykop on 10 August 1942 without a fight as a result of a Brandenburger commando operation. German attempts to re-start oil production in the scorched-earth area proved only minimally successful. On 29 January 1943, the Transcaucasian Front of the Red Army re-took the town.

Since 1991 Maykop has served as the capital of the Republic of Adygea in the Russian Federation.

==Economy==

The discovery of extensive underground oil reserves has made Maykop a major centre for oil extraction for the Soviet Union and, subsequently, Russia. Other economically important sectors are food processing and the timber industry.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with eight rural localities, incorporated as Maykop Republican Urban Okrug—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. It has the following rural localities under its jurisdiction:
*&quot;khutor&quot; of Gaverdovsky
*&quot;stanitsa&quot; of Khanskaya
*&quot;khutor&quot; of Kosinov
*settlement of Podgorny
*settlement of Rodnikovy
*settlement of Severny
*&quot;khutor&quot; of Vesyoly
*settlement of Zapadny

As a municipal division, Maykop Republican Urban Okrug is incorporated as Maykop Urban Okrug.

<doc id="496944" wikidata="Q962154" url="?curid=496944" title="Hypergraphia">
<text>Hypergraphia is a behavioral condition characterized by the intense desire to write or draw. Forms of hypergraphia can vary in writing style and content. It is a symptom associated with temporal lobe changes in epilepsy and in Geschwind syndrome. Structures that may have an effect on hypergraphia when damaged due to temporal lobe epilepsy are the hippocampus and Wernicke&#x27;s area. Aside from temporal lobe epilepsy, chemical causes may be responsible for inducing hypergraphia.

==Characteristics==
===Writing style===
American neurologists Stephen Waxman and Norman Geschwind were the first to describe hypergraphia, in the 1970s. The patients they observed displayed highly compulsive detailed writing, sometimes with literary creativity. The patients kept diaries, which some used to meticulously document minute details of their everyday activities, write poetry, or create lists. Case 1 of their study wrote lists of her relatives, her likes and dislikes, and the furniture in her apartment. Beside lists, the patient wrote poetry, often with a moral or philosophical undertone. She described an incident in which she wrote the lyrics of a song she learned when she was 17 several hundred times and another incident in which she felt the urge to write a word over and over again. Another patient wrote aphorisms and certain sentences in repetition.

A patient from a separate study experienced continuous &quot;rhyming in his head&quot; for five years after a seizure and said that he &quot;felt the need to write them down.&quot; The patient did not talk in rhyme, nor did he read poetry. Language capacity and mental status were normal for this patient, except for recorded right-temporal spikes on electroencephalograms. This patient had right-hemisphere epilepsy. Functional MRI scans of other studies suggest that rhyming behavior is produced in the left hemisphere, but Mendez proposed that postictal hypoactivity of the right hemisphere may induce a release of writing and rhyming abilities in the left hemisphere.

===Content===
In addition to writing in different forms (poetry, books, repetition of one word), hypergraphia patients differ in the complexity of their writings. While some writers (e.g. Alice Flaherty and Dyane Harwood) use their hypergraphia to help them write extensive papers and books, most patients do not write things of substance. Flaherty describes hypergraphia as a result of decreased temporal lobe function which disinhibits frontal lobe idea and language generation, &quot;sometimes at the expense of quality.&quot; Patients hospitalized with temporal lobe epilepsy and other disorders causing hypergraphia have written memos and lists (like their favorite songs) and recorded their dreams in extreme length and detail.

There are many accounts of patients writing in nonsensical patterns including writing in a center-seeking spiral starting around the edges of a piece of paper. In one case study, a patient even wrote backward, so that the writing could only be interpreted with the aid of a mirror. Sometimes the writing can consist of scribbles and frantic, random thoughts that are quickly jotted down on paper very frequently. Grammar can be present, but the meaning of these thoughts is generally hard to grasp and the sentences are loose. In some cases, patients write extremely detailed accounts of events that are occurring or descriptions of where they are.

In some cases, hypergraphia can manifest with compulsive drawing. The composer Robert Schumann, during periods of high musical output, also wrote many long letters to his wife Clara; similarly, Vincent van Gogh had much more written correspondence during bouts of intense painting. Many drawings by patients with hypergraphia exhibit repetition and a high level of detail, sometimes mixing both compulsive writing and drawing together.

==Causes==
Some studies have suggested that hypergraphia is related to bipolar disorder, hypomania, and schizophrenia. Although creative ability was observed in the patients of these studies, signs of creativity were observed, not hypergraphia specifically. Therefore, it is difficult to say with absolute certainty that hypergraphia is a symptom of these psychiatric illnesses because creativity in patients with bipolar disorder, hypomania, or schizophrenia may manifest into something aside from writing. However, other studies have shown significant accounts between hypergraphia and temporal lobe epilepsy and chemical causes.

=== Temporal lobe epilepsy ===

Hypergraphia was first studied as a symptom of temporal lobe epilepsy, a condition of reoccurring seizures caused by excessive neuronal activity, but it is not a common symptom among patients. Less than 10 percent of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy exhibit characteristics of hypergraphia. Temporal lobe epilepsy patients may exhibit irritability, discomfort, or an increasing feeling of dread if their writing activity is disrupted. To elicit such responses when interrupting their writing suggests that hypergraphia is a compulsive condition, resulting in an obsessive motivation to write. A temporal lobe epilepsy may influence frontotemporal connections in such a way that the drive to write is increased in the frontal lobe, beginning with the prefrontal and premotor cortex planning out what to write, and then leading to the motor cortex (located next to the central fissure) executing the physical movement of writing.

Most temporal lobe epilepsy patients who suffer from hypergraphia can write words, but not all may have the capacity to write complete sentences that have meaning.

=== Bipolar disorder ===
The disorder most often associated with high-output writers is bipolar disorder, especially during hypomania. In fact, temporal lobe epilepsy is more likely to produce hypergraphia if it also produces manic symptoms. While depression has been linked to increased writing, it appears that most writers with depression write little while depressed, and high output periods correspond to rebound mood elevation after the end of a depression, or in mixed mood states.

=== Chemicals ===
Drugs that boost mood and energy have been known to induce hypergraphia, possibly by increasing activity in brain networks utilizing one of the body&#x27;s neurotransmitters, dopamine. Dopamine has been known to decrease latent inhibition, which causes a decrease in the ability to habituate to screen out unexpected stimuli. Low latent inhibition leads to an excessive level of stimulation and could contribute to the onset of hypergraphia and general creativity. This research implies that there is a direct correlation between the levels of dopamine between neuronal synapses and the level of creativity exhibited by the patient. Dopamine agonists increase the levels of dopamine between synapses which results in higher levels of creativity, and the opposite is true for dopamine antagonists.

In one case study, a patient taking donepezil reported an elevation in mood and energy levels which led to hypergraphia and other excessive forms of speech (such as singing). Six other cases of patients taking donepezil and experiencing mania have been previously reported. These patients also had cases of dementia, cognitive impairment from a cerebral aneurysm, bipolar I disorder, and/or depression. Researchers are unsure why donepezil can induce mania and hypergraphia. It could potentially result from an increase in acetylcholine levels, which would have an effect on the other neurotransmitters in the brain.

==Pathophysiology==

Several regions of the brain are involved in the act of written composition. Handwriting depends on the superior parietal cortex, and motor control areas in the frontal lobe and cerebellum. An area of the frontal lobe that is especially active is Exner&#x27;s area, located in the premotor cortex. Writing creatively and generating ideas, on the other hand, activates multiple sites in the limbic system and cerebral cortex, including the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45) and the left temporal pole (BA 38). Lesions to Wernicke&#x27;s area (in the left temporal lobe) can increase speech output, which can sometimes manifest itself in writing. In one study, patients with hippocampal atrophy showed signs of having Geschwind syndrome, including hypergraphia. While epilepsy-induced hypergraphia is usually lateralized to the left cerebral hemisphere in the language areas, hypergraphia associated with lesions and other brain damage usually occurs in the right cerebral hemisphere. Lesions to the right side of the brain usually cause hypergraphia because they can disinhibit language function on the left side of the brain. Hypergraphia has also been known to be caused by right hemisphere strokes and tumors.

==Society and culture==
Hypergraphia was one of the central issues in the 1999 trial of Alvin Ridley for the imprisonment and murder of his wife Virginia Ridley. The mysterious woman, who had died in bed of apparent suffocation, had remained secluded in her home for 27 years in the small town of Ringgold, Georgia, United States. Her 10,000-page journal, which provided abundant evidence that she suffered from epilepsy and had remained housebound of her own will, was instrumental in the acquittal of her husband.

In 1969, Isaac Asimov said &quot;I am a compulsive writer&quot;. Other artistic figures reported to have been affected by hypergraphia include Vincent van Gogh, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Robert Burns. &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; author Lewis Carroll is also said to have had the condition, having written more than 98,000 letters in various formats throughout his life. Some were written backward, in rebus, and in patterns, as with &quot;The Mouse&#x27;s Tale&quot; in &quot;Alice&quot;.

Eleanor Alice Burford, whose pen-names included Jean Plaidy, Victoria Holt, Philippa Carr, Eleanor Burford, Elbur Ford, Kathleen Kellow, Anna Percival, and Ellalice Tate, described herself as a compulsive writer.

Naomi Mitchison, often called a doyenne of Scottish literature, writing over 90 books of historical and science fiction, travel writing and autobiography, has been described as a compulsive writer.

<doc id="496945" wikidata="Q7086957" url="?curid=496945" title="Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe">
<text>Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, 435 U.S. 191 (1978), is a United States Supreme Court case deciding that Indian tribal courts have no criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians. The case was decided on March 6, 1978, with a 6–2 majority. The court opinion was written by William Rehnquist, and a dissenting opinion was written by Thurgood Marshall, who was joined by Chief Justice Warren Burger. Justice William J. Brennan did not participate in the decision.

Congress partially abrogated the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision by enacting the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, which recognizes the criminal jurisdiction of tribes over non-Indian perpetrators of domestic violence that occur in Indian Country when the victim is Indian.

==Background==
In August 1973 Mark David Oliphant, a non-Indian living as a permanent resident with the Suquamish Tribe on the Port Madison Indian Reservation in northwestern Washington, was arrested and charged by tribal police with assaulting a tribal officer and resisting arrest during the Suquamish Tribe&#x27;s Chief Seattle Days. Knowing that thousands of people would gather in a small area for the celebration, the tribe requested Kitsap County and the Bureau of Indian Affairs for additional law enforcement assistance. The county sent just one deputy, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs sent no one. When Oliphant was arrested, at 4:30 a.m., only tribal officers were on duty.

Oliphant applied for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court and claimed he was not subject to tribal authority because he was not Native American. He challenged the exercise of criminal jurisdiction by the tribe over non-Indians.

== Procedural history ==
Oliphant&#x27;s application for a writ of habeas corpus was rejected by the lower courts. The Ninth Circuit upheld tribal criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians on Indian land because the ability to keep law and order on tribal lands was an important attribute of tribal sovereignty that had been neither surrendered by treaty nor removed by the US Congress under its plenary power over Tribes. Judge Anthony Kennedy, then a judge of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, dissented from the decision and said he found no support for the idea that only treaties and acts of Congress could take away the retained rights of tribes. He considered that doctrine of tribal sovereignty was not &quot;analytically helpful&quot; in resolving the issue.

==Ruling==
The Supreme Court ruled in Oliphant&#x27;s favor by holding that Indian tribal courts do not have criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians for conduct occurring on Indian land and reversed the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s decision. More broadly, the Supreme Court held that Indian tribes cannot exercise powers &quot;expressly terminated by Congress&quot; or &quot;inconsistent with their status&quot; as &quot;domestic dependent nations.&quot;

Analyzing the history of Congressional actions related to criminal jurisdiction in Indian Country, the Supreme Court concluded that there was an &quot;unspoken assumption&quot; that tribes lacked criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians. While &quot;not conclusive,&quot; the &quot;commonly shared presumption of Congress, the Executive Branch, and lower federal courts that tribal courts do not have the power to try non-Indians carrie[d] considerable weight.&quot;

The Court incorporated that presumption into its analysis of the Treaty of Point Elliot, which was silent on the issue of tribal criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians. The Court rejected the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s approach, which interpreted the treaty&#x27;s silence in favor of tribal sovereignty and applied the &quot;long-standing rule that legislation affecting the Indians is to be construed in their interest.&quot; Instead, the Court revived the doctrine of implicit divestiture. Citing &quot;Johnson v. McIntosh&quot; and &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia&quot;, the Court considered criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians an example of the &quot;inherent limitations on tribal powers that stem from their incorporation into the United States,&quot; similar to tribes&#x27; abrogated rights to alienate land.

By incorporating into the United States, the Court found that Tribes &quot;necessarily [gave] up their power to try non-Indian citizens of the United States except in a manner acceptable to Congress&quot;. Arguing that non-Indian citizens should not be subjected to another sovereign&#x27;s &quot;customs and procedure&quot;, the Court analogizes to &quot;Crow Dog&quot;. In &quot;Crow Dog&quot;, which was decided before the Major Crimes Act, the Court found exclusive Tribal jurisdiction over Tribe-members because it would be unfair to subject Tribe-members to an &quot;unknown code&quot; imposed by people of a different &quot;race [and] tradition&quot; from their own.

Although the Court found no inherent Tribal criminal jurisdiction, it acknowledged the &quot;prevalence of non-Indian crime on today&#x27;s reservations which the tribes forcefully argue requires the ability to try non-Indians&quot; and invited &quot;Congress to weigh in&quot; on &quot;whether Indian tribes should finally be authorized to try non-Indians&quot;.

==Dissenting opinion==
Justice Thurgood Marshall dissented. In his view, the right to punish all individuals who commit crimes against tribal law within the reservation was a necessary aspect of the tribe&#x27;s sovereignty:

I agree with the court below that the &quot;power to preserve order on the reservation ... is a &quot;sine qua non&quot; of the sovereignty that the Suquamish originally possessed.&quot; &quot;Oliphant v. Schlie&quot;, 544 F.2d 1007, 1009 (CA9 1976). In the absence of affirmative withdrawal by treaty or statute, I am of the view that Indian tribes enjoy, as a necessary aspect of their retained sovereignty, the right to try and punish all persons who commit offenses against tribal law within the reservation. Accordingly, I dissent.

Chief Justice Warren Burger joined the dissenting opinion.

==Effects==
In 1990 the Supreme Court extended &quot;Oliphant&quot; to hold that tribes also lacked criminal jurisdiction over Indians who were not members of the tribe, exercising jurisdiction in &quot;Duro v. Reina&quot;. Within six months, however, Congress abrogated the decision by amending the Indian Civil Rights Act to affirm that tribes had inherent criminal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians. In 2004, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the legislation in &quot;United States v. Lara&quot;.

Scholars have extensively criticized &quot;Oliphant&quot;. According to Professor Bethany Berger, &quot;By patching together bits and pieces of history and isolated quotes from nineteenth century cases, and relegating contrary evidence to footnotes or ignoring it altogether, the majority created a legal basis for denying jurisdiction out of whole cloth.&quot; Rather than legal precedent, the holding was &quot;dictated by the Court&#x27;s assumptions that tribal courts could not fairly exercise jurisdiction over outsiders and that the effort to exercise such jurisdiction was a modern upstart of little importance to tribal concerns.&quot; Professor Philip Frickey describes &quot;Oliphant&quot;, along with the subsequent decisions limiting tribal jurisdiction over non-Indians, as rooted in a &quot;normatively unattractive judicial colonial impulse,&quot; and Professor Robert Williams condemns the decision as &quot;legal auto-genocide.&quot; According to Dr. Bruce Duthu, the case showed &quot;that the project of imperialism is alive and well in Indian Country and that courts can now get into the action.&quot;

The Oliphant Court essentially elevated a local level conflict between a private citizen and an Indian tribe into a collision of framework interests between two sovereigns, and in the process revived the most negative and destructive aspects of colonialism as it relates to Indian rights. This is a principal reason the decision has attracted so much negative reaction ... &quot;Oliphant&quot; impact on the development of federal Indian law and life on the ground in Indian Country has been nothing short of revolutionary. The opinion gutted the notion of full territorial sovereignty as it applies to Indian tribes.

==Evolution==
Congress allowed the tribal courts the right to consider a lawsuit if a non-Indian man commits domestic violence towards a Native American woman on the territory of a Native American tribe by passing Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA 2013), signed into law on March 7, 2013, by President Barack Obama. It was motivated by the high percentage of Native American women being assaulted by non-Indian men, who felt immune because of the lack of jurisdiction of tribal courts. The new law allowed tribal courts to exercise jurisdiction over non-Indian domestic violence offenders but also imposed other obligations on tribal justice systems, including the requirement for tribes to provide licensed attorneys to defend the non-Indians in tribal court. The new law took effect on March 7, 2015, but also authorized a voluntary &quot;Pilot Project&quot; to allow certain tribes to begin exercising special jurisdiction earlier. On February 6, 2014, three tribes were selected for this Pilot Project: the Pascua Yaqui Tribe (Arizona), the Tulalip Tribes of Washington, and the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (Oregon).

<text>Nizhnevartovsk () is a city in Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug–Yugra, Russia. Since the 1960s, the Western Siberian oil boom has led to Nizhnevartovsk&#x27;s rapid growth from a small settlement to a city due to its location beside the Samotlor oil field along the right bank of the Ob River, from the border with Tomsk Oblast, and the presence of the petroleum industry has made it one of the wealthiest cities in Russia.

Nizhnevartovsk is one of the few cities in Russia that exceeds the population of the administrative center of its federal subject. Population:

=== Geographical location ===
Nizhnevartovsk is located in the Sredneobskaya lowland of the West Siberian plain in the middle reaches of the Ob river on its right Bank.

Moscow time+2 (Yekaterinburg time)

Nizhnevartovsk, like the entire district, is located in the Moscow time zone+2 (Yekaterinburg time). The offset of the applied time relative to UTC is +5: 00

=== Hydrology ===
The main watercourse of the city is the Ob river, from the mouth of the Svitlaya Bayou to the Lokosovskaya Bayou. Within the Nizhnevartovsky district, the section of the middle Ob river is 134 km long and the floodplain is 18 to 20 km wide. By the nature of the water regime, it belongs to the type of rivers with spring and summer floods and floods in the warm period of the year. The duration of the flood is on average 60–130 days. The appearance of ice formations on rivers is typical for the second half of October—early November. The average duration of ice build-up is 180–200 days. 

In hydrographic terms, the taiga zone of the Ob river differs sharply from the forest-steppe zone adjacent to it from the South; this difference is primarily due to a change in the ratio of water balance elements. With a noticeable increase in precipitation, with a decrease in their losses to evaporation, surface runoff increases sharply here.

In 2015, the largest flooding of territories adjacent to Nizhnevartovsk in thirty years occurred, including numerous dachas and gardening associations. The reason for the dynamics of water level rise was the climatic features of the spring period.

=== Climate ===
Nizhnevartovsk has a subarctic climate (Koppen Dfc). The climate is characterized by a long cold winter, long snow cover (200–210 days), short transitional seasons, late spring and early autumn frosts, short frost-free period (100–110 days), and short, but relatively warm summer (10–14 weeks). Winter is characterized by relatively small inter-day variability in air temperature, the average value of which is 5°C; which is lower than during the summer.

The annual precipitation rate is of the continental type. During the cold period, about 20% of the annual amount falls. Most of them fall in the first months of winter. The maximum annual precipitation falls in the summer months of the year — from June to August. In some years, the amount of precipitation may deviate significantly from the norm. The annual minimum precipitation is observed in February. Snow cover is formed in October—early November, and its descent is observed in late April-early May.

As the entire district is equated to the regions of the Far North.

* Average annual air temperature: −0.9°C
* Relative humidity: 73.7%
* Average wind speed: 3.1m/s

=== Vegetation ===
In the Nizhnevartovsky district, as well as throughout the entire territory of the Middle Ob region, cedar (people in Russia called &quot;cedar&quot; some species of pine, in this case – Siberian pine) forests are indigenous, and birch and aspen trees that have arisen in their place are derived. The basis of the district&#x27;s forests is made up of three species: pine, cedar and birch. Among the forest formations, the area is dominated by pine trees. Cedar forests cover less than a quarter of the forested area. A third of the area is occupied by small-leaved forests.

Pine trees are found on sandy and sandy loam strongly podzolic soils and are confined to elevated terrain areas. The most common types are lichen and cranberry pines.

For cedar trees, a good development of the grass-shrub layer is characteristic, in which the dominant value belongs to forest shrubs (blueberries, cranberries, watermelons, marsh bagulnik) and taiga smallgrass (Linnea Severnaya, kislitsa, maynik dvulistnogo). Shrubs are represented by Siberian mountain ash, individual specimens. Green mosses are always present in these forests.

==History==
Nizhnevartovsk was founded in 1909 (or 1905), built as a service point for merchant steamships operating on the Ob River to acquire stocks of firewood to power their boats. The new village had five homes with a population of eleven people, and was named Nizhnevartovskoye (), in reference to the Vartovskaya River, a tributary of the Ob located downstream. In early 1924, Nizhnevartovsky Selsoviet was formed.

Nizhnevartovsk remained a relatively small settlement until the 1960s when the Soviet authorities began widespread prospecting for the petroleum industry in the Western Siberia region, discovering the Samotlor oil field, one of the largest oil fields in the world, beneath the nearby Lake Samoltor to the north of Nizhnevartovsk. The discovery saw its rapid development and growth from a large village to a boomtown, Komsomol volunteers were brought in from across the country to construct the city, and Nizhnevartovsk&#x27;s population skyrocketed from 2300 people in 1959 to 15,663 in 1970. Town status was granted to Nizhnevartovsk on March 9, 1972.

==Administrative and municipal divisions==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Nizhnevartovsk serves as the administrative center of Nizhnevartovsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the city of okrug significance of Nizhnevartovsk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of okrug significance of Nizhnevartovsk is incorporated as Nizhnevartovsk Urban Okrug.

==Economy==
Nizhnevartovsk is the center of the West Siberian oil-producing region and one of the wealthiest cities in the country.

== Education ==
Nizhnevartovsk is home to Nizhnevartovsk State University, a higher education institution with over 5,000 students.

==Notable people==
*Ksenia Sukhinova, Miss World 2008

==In popular culture==
Nizhnevartovsk features prominently in the opening of Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, which details a hypothetical war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. In the novel, Nizhnevartovsk is depicted as a significant center for petroleum in the Soviet Union until it is sabotaged, causing a major economic crisis which triggers World War III.

<text>Ponza (Italian: &quot;isola di Ponza&quot; ) is the largest island of the Italian Pontine Islands archipelago, located south of Cape Circeo in the Tyrrhenian Sea. It is also the name of the commune of the island, a part of the province of Latina in the Lazio region.

==History==
The island was inhabited from neolithic through Roman times. According to local legends, Ponza was named after Pontius Pilate, Roman governor of Judea who tried Jesus of Nazareth for sedition against Roman rule. Pontius Pilate&#x27;s family owned a grotto on Ponza, which is still named after him. The Pontius Pilate legend of Ponza&#x27;s name has recently come into dispute amongst historians, because the name &quot;Pontia&quot; appears in Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;. This pre-dates the birth of Pilate. It is not known if this is the same name as Ponza or a similar name. Also, &quot;Pontia&quot; means &quot;Land of Bridges&quot; in Latin, a name which could have been applied for Ponza&#x27;s many naturally occurring arches and bridge-like landforms. Another theory is that the name is of Greek origin, from Greek &quot;pontos&quot;, &quot;πόντος&quot;, sea (see also Pontus).

===Greek and Roman periods===
In ancient times the island was called &quot;Tyrrhenia&quot;. Legend says that Ponza is what is left of the lost island of Tyrrhenia. Ponza is said to have been connected to the mainland by a narrow strip of land, which sank into the sea with most of the island below the water, with the parts remaining above sea level. The same exact phenomenon happened at Capri. According to legend, there was a large city on the ancient island. There has been significant archaeological progress recently that shows this may be true. For example, it was discovered that the harbor floor of nearby Pozzuoli had sunk and risen several times in the last 5,000 years, revealing sunken Roman temples.

Ponza was first colonised by Etruscans. The island was heavily forested with giant trees in ancient times, but the forest is gone and the hills are covered with man-made terraces. Most of these terraces are no longer being used to grow food and grapes and are falling apart, due to lack of maintenance. The tallest hill on the island, called Monte Guardia, still has the rotting stumps of the extinct giant trees over eight feet wide. Crops are grown on these terraces like grapes for wine and cactus pears and fig trees.

Ponza is also suspected to be the island of Aeaea in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, as the island of Circe the sorceress, where her cave or grotto was. Today it is known as Grotta della Maga Circe on the west side of the island, between Capo Bianco and Chiaia di Luna beach. She was said to have lived in this cave in the winter months, spending the summer atop nearby Mount Circe on the mainland of Italy. This is where Circe turned Odysseus&#x27; men into animals and cast her spell on and seduced and lived with him for over a year. On the west side of Ponza is the Grotta di Ulisse O Del Sangue, which means Cave of Ulysses or the Blood. The Grotto or cave is almost directly underneath the hill/peninsula called Il Belvedere, which has the Giardino Botanico Ponziano a botanical garden with a villa and the remains of a castle. These caves or grottoes are popular destinations to visit by boat only.

During Roman times, Nero Caesar, eldest brother of Caligula, was deported to Ponza in AD 29, where he was put to death the following year. Two of his sisters, Agrippina the Younger (mother of the emperor Nero) and Julia Livilla, were exiled to Ponza in AD 39 for their complicity in a plot to overthrow Caligula. They were recalled to Rome in AD 41. Julia Livilla had a mansion named Palazzo Giulia (Julia&#x27;s Palace) built specially for her on Ponza. The ruins are still visible. A similar mansion with the same name was also built on nearby Ventotene for Emperor Augustus&#x27; exiled daughter, Julia the Elder.

===Middle Ages===
Ponza was abandoned during the Middle Ages due to constant raids by Saracens and pirates. In 1552, the Ottoman fleet under the command of Turgut Reis (known as Dragut in the West) defeated the Spanish fleet of Emperor Charles V under the command of the famous Genoese admiral Andrea Doria near Ponza.

===1700–present===
During the 18th century, the Kingdom of Naples re-colonized the island. In 1813 it was captured by British naval captain Charles Napier during the Napoleonic Wars.

The island became part of the Kingdom of Italy in the mid-19th century and it is now part of the Republic of Italy. The island&#x27;s isolation destined it to serve as a penal colony by various regimes. During the two decades of fascism, Ponza and nearby Ventotene served as a prison for political opponents of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s regime. The Ethiopian Prince Regent and military leader, Ras Immiru, who was captured by the Italian Army in 1936, was imprisoned in a house in Santa Maria. Mussolini himself was imprisoned on the island for several weeks after being overthrown and arrested in 1943. Left Communist theorist Amadeo Bordiga was also imprisoned on the island, and he returned after his imprisonment to build several houses.

The island is well known for the tragic story of Lucia Rosa who threw herself into the Tyrrhenian Sea rather than being forced to marry a man against her wishes. She is viewed by many women around the world as a martyr for women&#x27;s rights and symbol for human rights.

A few years ago, engineers working on an ancient Roman tunnel that connected the harbour part of Ponza to the neighborhood of Santa Maria used explosives to dig a conduit nearby — they were supposed to use a chisel. The explosive shock shattered and destroyed a 2,100-year-old Roman gallery tunnel. The tunnel that connects Ponza with Santa Maria is now repaired, but many residents complain that it does not look like it used to, with steel reinforced concrete in place of Roman bricks.

Today, the island is a tourist attraction with sandy beaches like Chiaia di Luna (Half Moon Beach), now permanently closed due to falling rocks from the huge collapsing cliff above. Several tourists were killed a few years ago while sunbathing on the beach. The Italian National Park Service has installed steel cable netting to prevent further rock falls and deaths. The Roman Galleria or Roman Tunnel that connected the beach to the road is now closed because of collapsing Roman brickwork. Many beaches that were very popular are now permanently closed because falling rocks from overhead cliffs have killed vacationers.

In September of 2007, six &quot;aquanauts&quot; spent two weeks living underwater off the coast of Ponza, breaking all other records.

==Geography==
Ponza and Gavi are the remains of a caldera rim of an extinct volcano, with a surface area of . Ponza is approximately long by at its widest. It is a crescent shaped island with one large beach called Spiaggia di Chiaia di Luna (Half Moon Beach) and a few small beaches and has a mostly rocky coast made of kaolin and tuff rock. The island has layers of Kaolinite and Bentonite which used to be mined. It has many odd natural rock formations, one looks like a monk, another looks like a giant pair of work pants, Spaccapurpo (Arco Naturale O Spaccapolpi), another looks like a patch of flowers and another one looks like mushrooms, another looks like a horseman. It has the Fantasy Rock Castle and several natural bridges and arches. It also has Faragliones or giant sea stacks made of solid rock. It has several small villages, among them are Commune di Ponza, Santa Maria and Le Forna. Ponza is often confused with nearby islands like Ischia and Capri, except Ponza has no active volcanism.

===Climate===
Ponza has a mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;) with hot and dry summers combined with mild and rainy winters. The annual average temperature is , the hottest month in August is , and the coldest month is in February. The annual precipitation is , of which November is the wettest with , while July is the driest with only .

==Archaeology==
The island is famed for its Blue Grottoes, which were created by the Etruscans. Among them are Serpents Grotto and the Roman Gallery, a Roman tunnel that connects the town of Ponza to the (now closed) large sandy beach called Chiaia di Luna on the west side. The island has many archeological ruins visible everywhere, including Greek, and Phoenician necropoli ruins in the middle of the island. There are Etruscan ruins on parts of the island jumbled with Roman ruins. A large statue called &quot;Il Mamozio&quot; (&quot;The Mummy&quot;) or &quot;Il Mitreo&quot;, meaning miter or priest&#x27;s hat, is a 3,000-year-old marble statue and was found in the harbor. Depicting a local Etrurian consul, it is now displayed in a museum in Naples behind protective plastic, where it was reunited with its head. It is the oldest known Etruscan statue of its kind and extremely rare.

==Economy==
The town of Ponza is a fishing and boating port with several large docks that can accommodate large ships. Its biggest industry is tourism followed by boatbuilding, boat repair and fishing.

The four mines at the northern end — the most beautiful area of the island — were closed down in 1975 by the Italian Environmental Protection Agency because the mining operation was destroying the wildlife and flora, which are endangered species. The mines produced kaolin and Bentonite. Kaolin is used in making Kaolin-Pectin medicine and the manufacture of porcelain.

Ponza has a two lane road that goes from north to south, but can accommodate small cars only. An airstrip planned for the north of the island was canceled due to environmental concerns. Because there is no airstrip, seaplanes visit the island instead.

Celebrities who have vacationed on Ponza include Kirk Douglas, his son Michael Douglas, Anthony Quinn, Burt Lancaster, Gina Lollobrigida, Elsa Martinelli and Sophia Loren, Jacques Cousteau and his son, Philippe Cousteau, who filmed several documentaries in the area.

Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;Satyricon&quot; (1969) was filmed on Ponza. Some scenes in Wes Anderson&#x27;s film &quot;The Life Aquatic&quot; were filmed on the island; Ponza was instead called in the movie, &quot;Port-au-Patois&quot;. 

The Rai Fiction television series, &quot;Un&#x27;altra Vita&quot; (2014), was largely filmed on Ponza. Many of the scenes showcase the hilly landscape and rugged shoreline of the island.

Most of the people who live there raise rabbits and chickens and other animals in coops for meat to make cacciatore. Other farmed animals include goats, lamb and pigeons.

Many of the original inhabitants of Ponza are now leaving the island. They are steadily being replaced by other Italians from the mainland. Many local children simply move away after becoming adults and never return.

The local economy is in a downturn partly due to the severe restrictions on commercial fishing.

==Transportation==
Ferries reach Ponza from Naples, Terracina, Formia and Anzio; there are also hydrofoils (aliscafo) from Anzio and Formia that take about 75 minutes. The ferries and hydrofoils may not depart to and from Ponza during severe weather conditions. Much of Ponza is accessible by car and a bus runs the length of the island.

<text>Bertrand Russell makes a distinction between two different kinds of knowledge: knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description. Whereas knowledge by description is something like ordinary propositional knowledge (e.g. &quot;I know that snow is white&quot;), knowledge by acquaintance is familiarity with a person, place, or thing, typically obtained through perceptual experience (e.g. &quot;I know Sam&quot;, &quot;I know the city of Bogotá&quot;, or &quot;I know Russell&#x27;s &quot;Problems of Philosophy&quot;&quot;). According to Bertrand Russell&#x27;s classic account of acquaintance knowledge, acquaintance is a direct causal interaction between a person and some object that the person is perceiving.

==Pre-Russellian accounts==
===Grote===
In 1865, philosopher John Grote distinguished between what he described as &quot;knowledge of acquaintance&quot; and &quot;knowledge-about&quot;. Grote noted that these distinctions were made in many languages. He cited Greek (γνωναι and ειδεναι), Latin (noscere and scire), German (kennen and wissen), and French (connaître and savoir) as examples.

Grote&#x27;s &quot;knowledge &quot;of&quot; acquaintance&quot; is far better known today as &quot;knowledge &quot;by&quot; acquaintance&quot;, following Russell&#x27;s decision to change the preposition in a paper that he read to the Aristotelian Society on 6 March 1911.

===Helmholtz===
In a similar fashion, in 1868 Hermann von Helmholtz clearly distinguished between das Kennen, the knowledge that consisted of &quot;mere familiarity with phenomena&quot;, and das Wissen, &quot;the knowledge of [phenomena] which can be communicated by speech&quot;. Stressing that the Kennen sort of knowledge could not &quot;compete with&quot; the Wissen sort of knowledge, Helmholtz argued that, despite the fact that it might be of &quot;the highest possible degree of precision and certainty&quot;, the Kennen kind of knowledge can not be expressed in words, &quot;even to ourselves&quot;.

===James===
In 1890, William James, agreeing there were two fundamental kinds of knowledge, and adopting Grote&#x27;s terminology, further developed the distinctions made by Grote and Helmholtz:

::I am acquainted with many people and things, which I know very little about, except their presence in the places where I have met them. I know the color blue when I see it, and the flavour of a pear when I taste it; I know an inch when I move my finger through it; a second of time, when I feel it pass; an effort of attention when I make it; a difference between two things when I notice it; but about the inner nature of these facts or what makes them what they are, I can say nothing at all. I cannot impart acquaintance with them to any one who has not already made it himself I cannot describe them, make a blind man guess what blue is like, define to a child a syllogism, or tell a philosopher in just what respect distance is just what it is, and differs from other forms of relation. At most, I can say to my friends, Go to certain places and act in certain ways, and these objects will probably come. (1890, p.221)

==Bertrand Russell==

===&quot;On Denoting&quot;===
The distinction in its present form was first proposed by British philosopher Bertrand Russell in his famous 1905 paper, &quot;On Denoting&quot;. According to Russell, knowledge by acquaintance is obtained exclusively through experience, and results from a direct causal interaction between a person and an object that the person is perceiving. In accordance with Russell&#x27;s views on perception, sense-data from that object are the only things that people can ever become acquainted with; they can never truly be acquainted with the physical object itself. A person can also be acquainted with his own sense of self (&quot;cogito ergo sum&quot;) and his thoughts and ideas. However, other people could not become acquainted with another person&#x27;s mind, for example. They have no way of directly interacting with it, since a mind is an internal object. They can only perceive that a mind could exist by observing that person&#x27;s behaviour.

To be fully justified in believing a proposition to be true one must be acquainted, not only with the fact that supposedly makes the proposition true, but with the relation of correspondence that holds between the proposition and the fact. In other words, justified true belief can only occur if I know that a proposition (e.g. &quot;Snow is white&quot;) is true in virtue of a fact (e.g. that the frequency of the light reflected off the snow causes the human eye, and by extension, the human mind, to perceive snow to be white). By way of example, John is justified in believing that he is in pain if he is directly and immediately acquainted with his pain. John is fully justified in his belief not if he merely makes an inference regarding his pain (&quot;I must be in pain because my arm is bleeding&quot;), but only if he feels it as an immediate sensation (&quot;My arm hurts!&quot;). This direct contact with the fact and the knowledge that this fact makes a proposition true is what is meant by knowledge by acquaintance.

On the contrary, when one is not directly and immediately acquainted with a fact, such as Julius Caesar&#x27;s assassination, we speak of knowledge by description. When one is not directly in contact with the fact, but knows it only indirectly by means of a description, one arguably is not entirely justified in holding a proposition true (such as e.g. &quot;Caesar was killed by Brutus&quot;).

The acquaintance theorist can argue that one has a noninferentially justified belief &quot;that P&quot; only when one has the thought &quot;that P&quot; and one is acquainted with both the fact that P is the case, the thought &quot;that P&quot;, and the relation of correspondence holding between the thought &quot;that P&quot; and the fact that P is the case. So I must not only know the proposition P, and the fact that P is the case, but also know that the fact that P is the case is what makes proposition P true.

===&quot;The Problems of Philosophy&quot;===
The distinction between knowledge by description and knowledge by acquaintance is developed much further in Russell&#x27;s 1912 book, &quot;The Problems of Philosophy&quot;.

Russell referred to acquaintance as &quot;the given&quot;. He theorized that certain familiarities develop from an individual&#x27;s experience with various primary impressions (sensory or abstract) that are so much a part of awareness itself that the individual possesses knowledge of these familiar features without accessing memories by the cognitive process of remembering. Russell believes that acquaintance is necessary in order for us to form any proposition—that any belief we form must be composed entirely of experiential components with which we have acquaintance. Per Russell, all foundational knowledge is by acquaintance, and all non-foundational (inferential) knowledge is developed from acquaintance relations. Russell&#x27;s famous description of acquaintance is as follows:

::We shall say that we have acquaintance with anything of which we are directly aware, without the intermediary of any process of inference or any knowledge of truths. Thus in the presence of my table I am acquainted with the sense-data that make up the appearance of my table—its colour, shape, hardness, smoothness, etc.; all these are things of which I am immediately conscious when I am seeing and touching my table. The particular shade of colour that I am seeing may have many things said about it—I may say that it is brown, that it is rather dark, and so on. But such statements, though they make me know truths about the colour, do not make me know the colour itself any better than I did before so far as concerns knowledge of the colour itself, as opposed to knowledge of truths about it, I know the colour perfectly and completely when I see it, and no further knowledge of it itself is even theoretically possible. Thus the sense-data which make up the appearance of my table are things with which I have acquaintance, things immediately known to me just as they are.

Russell adds that we have acquaintance with sense data, desires, feelings, (probably) the self, and universals like color, brotherhood, diversity, etc. Other acquaintance theorists would later suggest that we can have acquaintance with basics such as “yellow or not yellow”; ourselves; states, properties, things, or facts (Sellars, see below); feeling, sensations, ticklings, afterimages, itches, etc. (Chalmers, see below); necessary truths (such as “the tallest thing is the only thing that is as tall as it is”, “all violinists are musicians&quot;, &quot;3 + 2 = 5&quot;, etc.); phenomenal experiences “seemings”; and sensory inputs, or “particulars that are directly present to the mind”.

Direct acquaintance only refers to the individual&#x27;s direct access to some aspect of her/his experience, whereas knowledge by acquaintance requires that the individual have a belief about it. Russell and other acquaintance theorists assert that not only does acquaintance make knowledge possible; it makes thinking itself possible. This assertion is based on the epistemic principle that empirical experience is the source of properly simple concepts.

In &quot;The Problems of Philosophy&quot;, Russell clarifies that knowledge we can have of a specific “so-and-so”, which is a thing identifiable as the thing that it uniquely is, is knowledge by description.

Per Russell, acquaintance knowledge is an awareness that occurs below the level of specific identifications of things. Knowledge by acquaintance is knowledge of a general quality of a thing, such as its shape, color, or smell. According to Russell, acquaintance does not involve reasoning that leads the individual to form an inference that the thing possessing the quality is any specific “so-and-so”. He also includes self-consciousness of one&#x27;s having an experience. For example, &quot;When I see the sun, I am often aware of my seeing the sun; thus &#x27;my seeing the sun&#x27; is an object with which I have acquaintance.&quot; It is only possible to have acquaintance with things that exist, actual relata, according to Russell, and acquaintance does not involve thought, intention, or judgment, or application of concepts.

Russell allows for fallibility of acquaintance due to false impressions acquired in some acquaintance relations, and he argues that these do not negate the much greater number of accurate impressions that result in acquaintance based on truths. To support this position, Fumerton offers examples of error such as misidentifying a particular shade of color as another, and he suggests that acquaintance relations should not be viewed as guarantees of, but only as representations of probabilities of, truth relations.

==Subsequent views==
===Sellars===
Wilfrid Sellars, in &quot;Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind&quot; (1956), rejects acquaintance theory, arguing that acquaintance is not necessary to provide a solid foundation for knowledge and thinking, as acquaintance theorists claim. In his Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind, he dissects the internalists&#x27; case for acquaintance. He calls the proposal that we have direct acquaintance with sensory data &quot;The Myth of the Given&quot;. Sellars argues, &quot;there is no reason to suppose that having the sensation of a red triangle is a cognitive or epistemic fact.&quot; He reasons that if sensations, impressions, desires, images, or feelings are to be considered as veridical experiences, then it must be likewise possible for them to be unveridical. He believes that if &quot;immediate experience&quot; like sensations, is susceptible to being misperceived, thus resulting in erroneous inferences for epistemic agent (as is very common in everyday life) then it doesn&#x27;t make sense to think of acquaintance as a necessity for knowledge.

Sellars bypasses the usual objections to acquaintance theory, which largely focus on absence of explanation for how acquaintance is connected to the knowledge that is said to result from it. Instead, Sellars emphasizes the need to dispel the myth by closely examining the “form of the givenness”, dissecting the proposed operations of acquaintance in terms of “such facts as that physical object X looks red to person S at time t, or that there looks to person S at time t to be a red physical object over there.” (Sellars)

Sellars asserts that acquaintance theory has not been sufficiently evaluated, and that in order for the theory to be validated, the range of sense impressions it claims can be &quot;given&quot; to the epistemic agent must be fully accounted for by an &quot;exhaustive list&quot;, and each type of impression must be meticulously scrutinized as a prospect for such givenness. He also argues that it is necessary to presuppose that the epistemic agent possesses empirical knowledge of particular truths in order to make assumptions about the epistemic state of cognitive states that are independent of inference. However, Sellars reasons, because presupposition is inferential, empirical knowledge, regardless of being non-inferentially acquired, is nevertheless epistemically dependent if based on the presupposition that the epistemic agent possesses other pertinent empirical knowledge. Therefore, he concludes that cognitions that are organized propositionally do not qualify as “the given”. Sellars does determine that there are beliefs that are non-inferential but that are intermixed with other beliefs that are connected in chains of inferences.
(These arguments are later pursued by DeVries.)

===Conee===
Earl Conee invoked the idea of acquaintance knowledge in response to Frank Jackson&#x27;s knowledge argument. Conee argued that when Mary the neuroscientist first sees a red object, she doesn&#x27;t gain new information but rather &quot;a maximally direct cognitive relation to the experience.&quot;[2]

Michael Tye makes similar use of the distinction between acquaintance and factual knowledge in his analysis of the Mary thought experiment.[3]

In some versions of acquaintance theory, the “given” is actually acquired by the mind&#x27;s work to register, maintain, and recall a particular sensation or other object of acquaintance until it ultimately becomes established as an acquaintance relation for the epistemic agent., but theorists emphasis that this is not to be confused with the same processes by which memories are developed.

===Fumerton===
Richard Fumerton views direct acquaintance (the theory of which he often refers to as “classical foundationalism”) as simple, hence indefinable. He asserts that it is the central concept around which philosophy of mind and epistemology must be developed. He acknowledges that although he takes direct acquaintance to be basic, it is viewed by other philosophers as a mystery. Fumerton (1995) suggests that the following are the necessary conditions to constitute knowledge by acquaintance.

::i. S is directly acquainted with the fact that p; 
::ii. S is directly acquainted with the thought that p; and 
::iii. S is directly acquainted with the correspondence that holds between the fact that P and the thought that P (Fumerton 1995, pp. 73–79).

According to Fumerton, acquaintance awareness is not non-relational or intentional thinking. There is a sui generis relation between the individual epistemic agent and “a thing, property, or fact”. He concurs with Russell that the acquaintance relation between the individual&#x27;s awareness and a state, object, fact, or property obtains in a way that cannot be reduced to more basic operations.
He suggests that one potential benefit of acquaintance, or “the given”, is that it solves the problem of infinite regress of justification for beliefs by serving as the basis on which all inferences can be grounded. Skeptics reject this proposal, arguing that in “the given” would need to be propositional in order to ground inferences, or, at minimum have its own truth value.

Fumerton asserts that because acquaintance requires that its relata actually exist, having acquaintance with something both justifies belief in the thing and makes the belief true. Fumerton offers this response to skeptics of acquaintance.

::If I am asked what reason I have for thinking that there is such a relation as acquaintance, I will, of course, give the unhelpful answer that I am acquainted with such a relation. The answer is question-begging if it is designed to convince someone that there is such a relation, but if the view is true it would be unreasonable to expect its proponent to give any other answer. (Fumerton)

Skeptics who find Fumerton&#x27;s response unsatisfactory persist that having a truth value requires employment of concepts, i.e., comparing, classifying, and making judgments. That process involves at least the simplest of beliefs associated with memories of previous experienced, making acquaintance a form of inference.

But, Fumerton further asserts that an individual can have direct acquaintance not just possible with the non-propositional experiences but also with the “relation of correspondence that holds between the non-propositional experience and the propositional thought.&quot; He finds that these three acquaintance relationships are required in order for a proposition to be true (correspondence theory of truth).

::a. the truth-maker (S is directly acquainted with the fact that p); 
::b. the truth-bearer (S is directly acquainted with the thought that p); and 
::c. the correspondence relation (S is directly acquainted with the correspondence between the fact that P and the thought that p). (Fumerton)

Fumerton proposes that while acquaintance does not depend on proposition, one can have thoughts and propositions established in acquaintance, and that justification for belief is effected by the individual&#x27;s acquaintance with the correspondence relation between a thought and the fact associated with it. BonJour also mentions this relation, but he views this recognition as requiring proposition or judgment.

===BonJour===
Laurence BonJour (2003) asserts that acquaintance is a &quot;built-in&quot; awareness, that does not involve cognitive processes, and that it justifies belief. He argues that an adequate defense of acquaintance must explain the process by which acquaintance builds and maintains its cache of impressions into which new inputs of matching impressions can be added and caused to engage with cognitive processes. He also posits that for an epistemic agent to establish acquaintance unavoidably engages a proposition, or at least requires categorizing of inputs.

In response to Sellars, BonJour asserts that an individual can have experiences that are not connected to inferences but that there is a suitable relation of those experiences and her/his beliefs. BonJour asserts that awareness is “built-in” and that it provides full justification for essential empirical beliefs.

Fallibility: BonJour asserts that the cognitive content that constitutes the basis for typically accurate interpretation of sensory inputs makes it possible to acquire many true acquaintances, and the efficacy of this arrangement is not undermined by occurrences of inaccurate interpretations.

===Chisholm===
In his “Object and Person” (2002), Roderick Chisholm examines the conflicting perspectives between philosophers on whether or not we can actually be directly aware of the contents of our experiences. The unique property of an object of acquaintance permits the epistemic agent to develop acquaintance with that particular property by which the agent can identify it. In his Acquaintance and the Mind-Body Problem, Chisolm asserts that all epistemic agents have direct acquaintance with the self. He notes that both René Descartes and Gottlob Frege held this view as well.

===Chalmers===
David Chalmers (2002) argues that for acquaintance to depend on propositions as Bonjour suggests, then instances of acquaintance require their own justification. He further contends that acquaintance with an object of acquaintance cannot serve as justification for any beliefs without the acquaintance itself being justified. Chalmers contends that as acquaintances is understood as separate from cognition, it does not seem feasible as justification for beliefs or as a basis for knowledge.

===The speckled hen case===

The famous speckled hen case has been invoked by acquaintance skeptics who insist that the theory cannot explain acquaintance with very simple mental states, like viewing a few dots against a solid background color can be said to justify belief in knowledge by acquaintance, while it is believed that viewing a significantly larger number of dots cannot justify belief in it. They believe that defenders of acquaintance theory should answer as to why the capacity of direct acquaintance should be so limited. Sellars resolved the problem simply by asserting that naturally the speckled hen experiment fails to support an acquaintance relation because the individual cannot reasonably be expected to build up such an association where the total number of objects in an array cannot be known without methodically accounting for them all. He points out that the “character of the experience” is not distinguishable to the individual&#x27;s subconscious in such cases of instant presentations of complex arrays of data.

===Knowledge of other people===
Some recent work in epistemology deploys ideas concerning knowledge by acquaintance in developing an epistemology of knowing other people. For some examples, see Bonnie Talbert&#x27;s &quot;Knowing Other People&quot; and Matthew Benton&#x27;s &quot;Epistemology Personalized&quot; and &quot;The Epistemology of Interpersonal Relations&quot;.

<doc id="496957" wikidata="Q599843" url="?curid=496957" title="Hard link">
<text>In computing, a hard link is a directory entry (in a directory-based file system) that associates a name with a file. Thus, each file must have at least one hard link. Creating additional hard links for a file makes the contents of that file accessible via additional paths (i.e., via different names or in different directories). This causes an alias effect: a process can open the file by any one of its paths and change its content. By contrast, a soft link or “shortcut” to a file is not a direct link to the data itself, but rather a reference to a hard link or another soft link.

Every directory is itself a special file on many systems, containing a list of file names instead of other data. Hence, multiple hard links to directories are possible, which could create a circular directory structure, rather than a branching structure like a tree. For that reason, some file systems forbid the creation of additional hard links to directories.

POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, Android, macOS, and the non POSIX compliant Windows NT family, support multiple hard links to the same file, depending on the file system. For instance, NTFS and ReFS support hard links, while FAT does not.

==Operation==
Let two hard links, named &quot;LINK A.TXT&quot; and &quot;LINK B.TXT&quot;, point to the same physical data. A text editor opens &quot;LINK A.TXT&quot;, modifies it and saves it. When the editor (or any other app) opens &quot;LINK B.TXT&quot;, it can see those changes made to &quot;LINK A.TXT&quot;, since both file names point to the same data. So from a user&#x27;s point of view this is one file with several filenames. Editing any filename modifies &quot;all&quot; files, however deleting &quot;any&quot; filename except the last one keeps the file around.

However, some editors, such as GNU Emacs, break the hard link concept. When opening a file for editing, e.g., &quot;LINK B.TXT&quot;, emacs renames &quot;LINK B.TXT&quot; to &quot;LINK B.TXT~&quot;, loads &quot;LINK B.TXT~&quot; into the editor, and saves the modified contents to a newly created &quot;LINK B.TXT&quot;. Now, &quot;LINK A.TXT&quot; and &quot;LINK B.TXT&quot; no longer shares the same data. (This behavior can be changed using the emacs variable codice_1.)

Any number of hard links to the physical data may be created. To access the data, a user only needs to specify the name of any existing link; the operating system will resolve the location of the actual data. Even if the user deletes one of the hard links, the data is still accessible through any other link that remains. Once the user deletes all of the links, if no process has the file open, the operating system frees the disk space that the file once occupied.

=== Reference counting ===
Most file systems that support hard links use reference counting. The system stores an integer value with each logical data section that represents the total number of hard links that have been created to point to the data. When a new link is created, this value is increased by one. When a link is removed, the value is decreased by one. When the counter becomes zero, the operating system frees the logical data section. (The OS may not to do so immediately, e.g., when there are outstanding file handles open, for performance reasons, or to enable the undelete command.)

This is a simple method for the file system to track the use of a given area of storage, as zero values indicate free space and nonzero values indicate used space. The maintenance of this value guarantees that there will be no dangling hard links pointing nowhere. The data section and the associated inode are preserved as long as a single hard link (directory reference) points to it or any process keeps the associated file open.

On POSIX-compliant operating systems, the reference count for a file or directory is returned by the stat() or fstat() system calls in the codice_2 field of codice_3.

== Limitations ==
To prevent loops in the filesystem, and to keep the interpretation of the &quot;&quot; file (parent directory) consistent, operating systems do not generally allow hard links to directories. UNIX System V allowed them, but only the superuser had permission to make such links. Mac OS X v10.5 (Leopard) and newer use hard links on directories for the Time Machine backup mechanism only.

Hard links can be created to files only on the same volume, i.e., within the same file system. (Different volumes may have different file systems. There is no guarantee that the target volume&#x27;s file system is compatible with hard linking.)

The maximum number of hard links to a single file is limited by the size of the reference counter. On Unix-like systems the counter is 4,294,967,295 (on 32-bit machines) or 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (on 64-bit machines). In some file systems, the number of hard links is limited more strictly by their on-disk format. For example, as of Linux 3.11, the ext4 file system limits the number of hard links on a file to 65,000. Windows limits enforces a limit of 1024 hard links to a file on NTFS volumes.

On Linux Weekly News, Neil Brown criticized hard links as high-maintenance, since they complicate the design of programs that handle directory trees, including archivers and disk usage tools. These apps must take care to de-duplicate files that are linked multiple times in a hierarchy. Brown notes that Plan 9 from Bell Labs, the intended successor to Unix, does not include the concept of a hard link.

==Platform support==
Windows NT 3.1 and later support hard links on the NTFS file system. Windows 2000 introduces a codice_4 function to create hard links, but only for files, not directories. The codice_5 function can remove them.

To create a hard link on Windows, end-users can use:
* The codice_6 utility (introduced in Windows 2000)
* The codice_7 internal command of Windows Command Prompt (introduced in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008)
* The codice_8 cmdlet of PowerShell

To interrogate a file for its hard links, end-users can use:
* The codice_6 utility
* The codice_10 and codice_11 cmdlets of PowerShell. These cmdlets represent each file with an object; PowerShell adds a read-only LinkType property to each of them. This property contains the string if the associated file has multiple hard links.

The Windows Component Store uses hard links to keep track of different versions of components stored on the hard disk drive.

On Unix-like systems, the system call can create additional hard links to existing files. To create hard links, end-users can use:
* The ln utility
* The link utility
* The codice_8 cmdlet of PowerShell

To interrogate a file for its hard links, end-users can use:
* The codice_13 command
* The codice_14 command
* The codice_10 and codice_11 cmdlets of PowerShell (see above)

Unix-like emulation or compatibility software running on Microsoft Windows, such as Cygwin and Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications, allow the use of POSIX interfaces. 

OpenVMS supports hard links on the ODS-5 file system. Unlike Unix, VMS can create hard links to directories.

<text>The She people (; She Chinese: ; Cantonese: , Fuzhou: ) are an ethnic group in China. They form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

The She are the largest ethnic minority in Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi Provinces. They are also present in the provinces of Anhui and Guangdong. Some descendants of the She also exist amongst the Hakka minority in Taiwan.

== Languages ==
Today, over 400,000 She people of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces speak She Chinese, an unclassified Chinese variety that has been heavily influenced by Hakka Chinese.

There are approximately 1,200 She people in Guangdong province who speak a Hmong–Mien language called She, also called &quot;Ho Ne&quot; meaning &quot;mountain people&quot; (). Some said they were descendants of Dongyi, Nanman or Yue peoples.

&quot;She Chinese&quot; () should not be confused with (), also known as Ho Ne, which is a Hmong-Mien language spoken in east-central Guangdong. She and Sheyu speakers have separate histories and identities, although both are officially classified by the Chinese government as She people. The Dongjia of Majiang County, Guizhou are also officially classified as She people, but speak a Western Hmongic language closely related to Chong&#x27;anjiang Miao ().

== History ==
The She people are some of the earliest known settlers of Guangdong; they are thought to have originally settled along the shallow shore for easier fishing access during the Neolithic era. Eventually, after an influx of Yuet people moved south during the Warring States period, serious competition between the two peoples for resources developed.

From the time of the Qin dynasty on, waves of migrants from northern China have had a serious impact on the She people. Because they possessed superior tools and technology, these migrants were able to displace the She and occupy the better land for farming. As a result of this, some of the She were forced to relocate into the hilly areas of the Jiangxi and Fujian provinces.

Following this relocation, the She people became hillside farmers. Their methods of farming included burning grasses on the slope, casting rice seeds on those embers and then harvesting the produce following the growth season. Some of the She people also participated in the production and trade of salt, obtained from the evaporation of local pools of salt water.

Many conflicts took place between the Han Chinese and She peoples. For example, in one incident, She salt producers on Lantau Island in Hong Kong attacked the city of Canton in a revolt during the Song dynasty.

During the Ming-Qing dynasties they moved into and settled Zhejiang&#x27;s southern region and mountain districts in the Lower Yangtze region, after they left their homeland in Northern Fujian. It is theorized that the She were pushed out of their land by the Hakka, which caused them to move into Zhejiang.

<text>Plestiodon gilberti, commonly known as Gilbert&#x27;s skink, is a species of heavy-bodied medium-sized lizard in the family Scincidae. The species is endemic to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, and grows to about in total length (including tail).

==Taxonomy and etymology==
&quot;Plestiodon gilberti&quot; (formerly &quot;Eumeces Gilberti&quot; ) was coined by John Van Denburgh, commemorating Dr.Charles H. Gilbert who was Denburgh’s professor at Stanford University and inspiration for his involvement in herpetology.

Together with the western skink (&quot;P. skiltonianus&quot;), the San Lucan skink (&quot;P. lagunensis&quot;), and the four-lined Asiatic skink (&quot;P. quadrilineatus&quot;), Gilbert&#x27;s skink belongs to the so-called &quot;&quot;skiltonianus&quot; group&quot;. The exact taxonomy within this group is being questioned and may need revision following DNA analysis research.

==Subspecies==
There are five subspecies of &quot;Plestiodon gilberti&quot;, including the nominotypical subspecies.
*&quot;Plestiodon gilberti arizonensis&quot; – Arizona skink
*&quot;Plestiodon gilberti gilberti&quot; – greater brown skink
*&quot;Plestiodon gilberti placerensis&quot; – northern brown skink
*&quot;Plestiodon gilberti cancellosus&quot; – variegated skink
*&quot;Plestiodon gilberti rubricaudatus&quot; – western red-tailed skink

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Plestiodon&quot;.

The subspecies &quot;P. g. placerensis&quot; is named after Placer County, California, where it occurs.

==Geographic range==
Gilbert&#x27;s skink occurs mainly in California. It is found in the northern San Joaquin Valley, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada from Butte County southward, and along the inner flanks of the Coast Ranges from San Francisco Bay to the Mexican border and into northern Baja California. It is also found in the mountains of southern California, and at scattered mountain localities in the eastern desert from Mono County to San Bernardino County. Spotted in Kern County, west of the Rand Mountains bordering San Bernardino, but greater numbers were found east, dispersed north of the Mojave Desert. Isolated populations also occur in western Arizona as well as in southern Nevada.

==Habitat==
Gilbert&#x27;s skink occurs in habitats ranging from sea level to elevations of about . Found in a wide variety of habitats, this lizard is most common in early successional stages or open areas within habitats in which it occurs, which range from grassland to open chaparral or open pine forests. Heavy brush and densely forested areas are generally avoided.

==Description==
Gilbert&#x27;s skink is a heavy-bodied lizard with small legs. Adults are uniformly colored in green, grey, olive or brown. Juveniles have light stripes on the sides and the back enclosing a broad black or brown stripe. This dark stripe stops near the base of the waxy-pink tail. The striping fades with growth and maturation faster in males than in females. In some environments, Gilbert’s skinks are known to be very similar in appearance to western skinks until they reach maturity.

==Behavior==
A robust skink, &quot;P. gilberti&quot; is seldom seen in the open. It forages through leaf litter and dense vegetation, occasionally digging through loose soil. It is a good burrower and often constructs its own shelter by burrowing under surface objects such as rocks or rotting logs.

The male counterparts of the P. gilberti are not observed to be territorial creatures, despite male aggression being typical in other Plestiodon species. When confronted, the P. gilberti would flee into leaf litter and away from sight.

== Diet ==

P. &quot;gilberti&quot; is typically known to feed on small invertebrates, such as insects and spiders.

It has a quirk in which it insists upon ingesting its prey headfirst, no matter the angle at which the prey confronts it, anteriorly or posteriorly. An instinctual tactic used by the P. gilberti to lessen struggle from a potentially difficult prey.
==Reproduction==
The reproductive season for &quot;P. gilberti&quot; varies geographically and from year to year depending on local conditions. Little is known about the timing of reproduction, but it is probably similar to the Western Skink, which lays its eggs in June and July. Adult females construct nest chambers in loose moist soil several centimeters deep, especially under flat stones. Clutch size varies from 3 to 9 eggs.

<text>Beerenburg (West Frisian: &quot;Bearenburch&quot;) is a Dutch drink, made by adding herbs to jenever, with about 30% alcohol.

The original Beerenburg was made in the early 18th century by the Amsterdam spice merchant &quot;Hendrik Beerenburg&quot;, to whom it owes its name. Beerenburg opened his own shop at the Stromarkt 6 in Amsterdam in 1724, a location which to date shows on its roof a bear (&#x27;beer&#x27;) crawling out of a fortress (&#x27;burcht&#x27;). Beerenburg kept his recipe secret but soon local varieties emerged, each with its own recipe. These were, however, not allowed to use the name &quot;Beerenburg&quot;, which is why there are variations on the spelling, such as Berenburg and Berenburger.

Despite the Amsterdam (North Holland) origin of Beerenburg, the drink became most popular in the northern provinces Friesland, Groningen and Drenthe. It is related to the Italian amaro, another type of digestive bitters.

In the European Union, Beerenburg is classified as a spirit drink.

==Brands==

Some famous brands of Beerenburg are: Boomsma (Leeuwarden), Bokma, Sonnema (Dokkum), Weduwe Joustra (Sneek), Plantinga (Bolsward), all from Friesland, and Hooghoudt Kalmoes, from Groningen.

<text>The Jaguar E-Type, or the Jaguar XK-E for the North American market, is a British front mid-engined sports car that was manufactured by Jaguar Cars Ltd from 1961 to 1974. Its combination of exceptional aesthetics, advanced technologies, high performance, and competitive pricing established the model as an icon of the motoring world. The E-Type&#x27;s claimed top speed, sub-7-second 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) acceleration, largely unitary body construction, front and rear independent suspension with disc brakes, mounted inboard at the rear, and rack-and-pinion steering, distinguished the car and spurred industry-wide changes.

The E-Type was based on Jaguar&#x27;s D-Type racing car, which had won the 24 Hours of Le Mans for three consecutive years beginning in 1955.

The E-Type employed what was, for the early 1960s, a novel design principle, with a front subframe carrying the engine, front suspension and front bodywork bolted directly to the body tub. No ladder frame chassis, as was common at the time, was needed and as such the first cars weighed only .

It is rumored that, on its debut on 15 March 1961, Enzo Ferrari called it &quot;the most beautiful car ever made&quot;, but this statement is not fully confirmed. In 2004, &quot;Sports Car International&quot; magazine placed the E-Type at number one on their list of Top Sports Cars of the 1960s. In March 2008, the Jaguar E-Type ranked first in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s online list of the world&#x27;s &quot;100 most beautiful cars&quot; of all time.

==Overview==

The E-Type was introduced as a rear-wheel drive grand tourer in two-seater coupé form (FHC or Fixed Head Coupé) and as a two-seater convertible (OTS or Open Two Seater). A &quot;2+2&quot; four-seater version of the coupé, with a lengthened wheelbase, was released in 1966.

Later model updates of the E-Type were officially designated &quot;Series 2&quot; and &quot;Series 3&quot;, and over time the earlier cars have come to be referred to as &quot;Series 1.&quot; As with other partly hand made cars of the time, changes were incremental and ongoing, which has led to confusion over exactly what a Series 1 car is. This is of more than academic interest, as Series 1 E-Types—and particularly Series 1 roadsters—often have values in excess of Series 2 and 3 models.

The Series 1 cars essentially fall into two categories: Those made between 1961 and 1964, which had 3.8-litre engines and (on all but the very last cars) partial synchromesh transmissions; and those made between 1965 and 1967, which increased engine size and torque by around 10% to 4.2 litres, and also provided new reclining seats, an alternator in place of the dynamo, an electrical system switched to negative earth, a more reliable brake servo, and other modern amenities. Styling was unchanged.
As a result, the 4.2-litre Type 1 generally became the most valuable form of the car. However, as of the end of 2014, the most expensive regular production Jaguar E-Types sold at auction included a 4.2-litre Series 1 roadster, with matching numbers, original paint and interior, under since new, and a history of being in the original buyer&#x27;s family for 45 years, for $467,000 in 2013, and a 3.8-litre 1961 &quot;flat floor&quot; Series 1, for $528,000 in 2014. Special run racing lightweights go for far more still. For example, a 1963 E-type Lightweight Competition advertised as very original and with much patina (wearing the &quot;factory installed interior and bodywork showing the patina of decades of use,&quot; although it was re-painted and has a non-matching numbers - albeit factory provided - engine), one of just twelve that were built, sold for $7,370,000 at the 2017 Scottsdale, Arizona auctions.

Being a British-made car of the 1960s, there are some rather rare sub-types of Series 1 E-Types, particularly at the beginning and end of the Series 1 production. For example, the first 500 Series 1 cars had flat floors and external bonnet latches. At the close of the Series 1 production run, there were a small number of cars produced that are identical in every respect to other Series 1 units (including triple SU carbs, button actuated starter, toggle switches, etc.), except that the headlight covers were removed for better illumination. It is not known exactly how many of these Series 1 cars (sometimes referred to as for convenience sake as &quot;Series 1.25,&quot; but per Jaguar, Series 1) were produced, but given that 1,508 Series 1 convertibles were produced worldwide for 1967, combined with the fact that these examples were made in just the last several months of Series 1 production, means that these, like the flat floor examples that began the Series 1 production run, are the lowest volume Series 1 variant, save of course for the special lightweights.

Including both left and right hand drive examples, a total of 7,828 3.8-litre Series 1 open two seaters (OTS) were built, with 6,749 of the later 4.2-litre Series 1 OTS&#x27;s having been manufactured.

While the 1968 Series 1.5 cars maintained the essential design of the Series 1 models, US emission regulations saw its triple SU carburettors replaced there with twin Zenith-Stromberg units, resulting in a drop in claimed power from and torque from .

Of the &quot;Series 1&quot; cars, Jaguar manufactured some limited-edition variants, inspired by motor racing:

*The &quot;&#x27;Lightweight&#x27; E-Type&quot; initiated and designed for competition was intended as a racing follow-up to the D-Type. Jaguar planned to produce 18 units but ultimately only a dozen were reportedly built. Of those, two have been converted to low drag form and two others are known to have been crashed and deemed to be beyond repair, although one has now been rebuilt. These are exceedingly rare and sought after by collectors. *The &quot;Low Drag Coupé&quot; was a one-off technical exercise which was ultimately sold to a Jaguar racing driver. It is presently believed to be part of the private collection of the current Viscount Cowdray. In 2014, Jaguar announced its intention to build the remaining six lightweights, at a cost of approximately £1 million each.

Safety and emissions regulations in the North American market resulted in Series 2 and 3 E-Types being fitted with a larger grille, wider wheel arches, and bigger bumpers. And they were also fitted with a bigger radiator and cooling system because the Series 1 were notorious for overheating

The New York City Museum of Modern Art recognised the significance of the E-Type&#x27;s design in 1996 by adding a blue roadster to its permanent design collection, one of only six automobiles to receive the distinction.
The MoMA XKE is a Series 1 OTS.

==Concept versions==

===E1A (1957)===
After the company&#x27;s success at the Le Mans 24 hr through the 1950s, Jaguar&#x27;s racing department was given the brief to use D-Type style construction to build a road-going sports car, replacing the XK150.

The first prototype (E1A), featured a monocoque design designed in 1957 by William Heynes Technical Director and Chief Engineer, Jaguar&#x27;s fully independent rear suspension and the &quot;XK&quot; engine.
The car was used solely for factory testing and was never formally released to the public. The car was eventually scrapped by the factory.

===E2A (1960)===
Jaguar&#x27;s second E-Type concept was E2A which, unlike the E1A, was constructed from a steel chassis with an aluminium body. This car was completed as a racing car as it was thought by Jaguar at the time it would provide a better testing ground. E2A used a 3-litre version of the XK engine with a Lucas fuel injection system.

After retiring from the Le Mans 24 hr the car was shipped to America to be used for racing by Jaguar privateer Briggs Cunningham. In 1961, the car returned to Jaguar in England to be used as a test vehicle. Ownership of E2A passed in 1970 to Roger Woodley (Jaguar&#x27;s customer competition car manager) who took possession on the basis the car not be used for racing. E2A had been possibly scheduled to be scrapped. Roger&#x27;s wife owned E2A until 2008 when it was offered for sale at Bonham&#x27;s Quail Auction, where it sold for US$4,957,000.

===E-Type Concept Zero (2017)===
Jaguar unveiled a modern revival of the 1968 E-Type series 1.5 roadster with an all-electric, zero-emission powertrain in September 2017. The vehicle has a 40kWh battery-powered electric motor and can accelerate to 60mph in 5.5 seconds. On a full charge, the vehicle has a range of . The battery pack is designed to fit in the space occupied by the original six-cylinder motor without any modifications, and will fit in any model Jaguar using the same motor. The electric motor replaces the original transmission.

In August 2018, Jaguar confirmed it will offer all-electric E-Types for sale starting in summer 2020.. However, this plan was halted in 2019.

==Production versions==

===Series 1 (1961–1968)===


The Series 1 was introduced, initially for export only, in March 1961. The domestic market launch came four months later, in July 1961. The cars at this time used the triple SU carburetted 3.8-litre six-cylinder Jaguar XK engine from the XK150S. Earlier built cars utilised external bonnet latches which required a tool to open and had a flat floor design. These cars are rare and more valuable. After that, the floors were dished to provide more leg room and the twin bonnet latches moved to inside the car. The 3.8-litre engine was increased to in October 1964.

The 4.2-litre engine produced the same power as the 3.8-litre () and same top speed (), but increased torque 18% from . Acceleration remained pretty much the same and times were around 6.4 seconds for both engines, but maximum power was now reached at 5,400 rpm instead of 5,500 rpm on the 3.8-litre. That all meant better throttle response for drivers that did not want to shift down gears. The 4.2-litre&#x27;s block was completely redesigned, made longer to accommodate larger bores, and the crankshaft modified to use newer bearings. Other engine upgrades included a new alternator/generator and an electric cooling fan for the radiator.

&quot;Autocar&quot; road tested a UK spec E-Type 4.2 fixed head coupé in May 1965. The maximum speed was , the time was 7.6 seconds and the from a standing start took 15.1 seconds. They summarised it as &quot;In its 4.2 guise the E-Type is a fast car (the fastest we have ever tested) and offers just about the easiest way to travel quickly by road.&quot;.

&quot;Motor&quot; magazine road tested a UK spec E-Type 4.2 fixed head coupé in Oct 1964. The maximum speed was , the 0- time was 7 seconds and the time was 14.9 seconds. They summarised it as &quot;The new 4.2 supersedes the early 3.8 as the fastest car &quot;Motor&quot; has tested. The absurd ease which can be exceeded in a never failed to astonish. of testing confirms that this is still one of the world&#x27;s outstanding cars&quot;.

All E-Types featured independent coil spring rear suspension designed and developed by R J Knight with torsion bar front ends, and four wheel disc brakes, in-board at the rear, all were power-assisted. The Coventry engineers spared nothing with regards to high automotive technology in braking. Like several British car builders of the middle and late 1950s, the four-wheel disc brakes were also used in that era by Austin-Healey and MG, putting the British far ahead of Ferrari, Maserati, Alfa Romeo, Porsche, and Mercedes-Benz. Even Lanchester tried an abortive attempt to use copper disc brakes in 1902. Jaguar was one of the first vehicle manufacturers to equip production cars with 4 wheel disc brakes as standard from the XK150 in 1958. The Series 1 (except for late 1967 models) can be recognised by glass-covered headlights (up to 1967), small &quot;mouth&quot; opening at the front, signal lights and tail-lights above bumpers and exhaust tips under the number plate in the rear.

3.8-litre cars have leather-upholstered bucket seats, an aluminium-trimmed centre instrument panel and console (changed to vinyl and leather in 1963), and a Moss four-speed gearbox that lacks synchromesh for first gear (&quot;Moss box&quot;) on all except very last cars. 4.2-litre cars have more comfortable seats, improved brakes and electrical systems, and, obviously, an all-synchromesh Jaguar designed four-speed gearbox. 4.2-litre cars also have a badge on the boot proclaiming &quot;Jaguar 4.2 Litre E-Type&quot; (3.8 cars have a simple &quot;Jaguar&quot; badge). Optional extras included chrome spoked wheels and a detachable hard top for the OTS. When leaving the factory the car was originally fitted with Dunlop 6.40 × 15-inch RS5 tyres on 15 × 5K wire wheels (with the rear fitting 15 × 5K½ wheels supplied with 6.50 X15 Dunlop Racing R5 tyres in mind of competition). Later Series One cars were fitted with Dunlop 185 - 15 SP41 or 185 VR 15 Pirelli Cinturato as radial ply tyres.

A 2+2 version of the fastback coupé was added in 1966. The 2+2 offered the option of an automatic transmission. The body is longer and the roof angles are different. The roadster and the non 2+2 FHC (Fixed Head Coupé) remained as two-seaters.

Less widely known, right at the end of Series 1 production, but prior to the transitional &quot;Series 1½&quot; referred to below, a small number of Series 1 cars were produced with open headlights. These Series 1 cars had their headlights modified by removing the covers and altering the scoops they sit in, but these Series 1 headlights differ in several respects from those later used in the Series 1½ (or 1.5), the main being they are shorter at 143 mm from the Series 1½ at 160 mm. Production dates on these machines vary but in right-hand drive form production has been verified as late as July 1968. They are not &quot;rare&quot; in the sense of the build of the twelve lightweights, but they are certainly uncommon; they were not produced until January 1967 and given the foregoing information that they were produced as late as July 1968, it appears that there must have been an overlap with the Series 1.5 production, which began in August 1967 as model year 1968 models. These calendar year/model year Series 1 E-Types are identical to other 4.2-litre Series 1 examples in every respect except for the open headlights; all other component areas, including the exterior, the interior, and the engine compartment are the same, with the same three SU carburettors, polished aluminium cam covers, centre dash toggle switches, etc.

Following the Series 1 there was a transitional series of cars built in 1967–68 as model year 1968 cars, unofficially called &quot;Series 1½.&quot; Due to American pressure the new features were not just open headlights, but also different switches (black rocker switches as opposed to the Series 1 toggle switches), de-tuning for emissions (using two Zenith-Stromberg carburettors instead of the original three SUs) for US models, ribbed cam covers painted black except for the top brushed aluminium ribbing, bonnet frames on the OTS that have two bows, and other changes. Series 1½ cars also have twin cooling fans and adjustable seat backs. The biggest change between 1961 and 1967 Series 1 E-Types and the 1968 Series 1.5 was the reduction in the number of carburettors from 3 to just 2 (North America), resulting in a loss in horsepower.

Series 2 features were gradually introduced into the Series 1, creating the unofficial Series 1½ cars, but always with the Series 1 body style. A United States federal safety law affecting 1968 model year cars sold in the US was the reason for the lack of headlight covers and change in dash switch design in the &quot;Series 1.5&quot; of 1968. An often overlooked change, one that is often &quot;modified back&quot; to the older style, is the wheel knock-off &quot;nut.&quot; US safety law for 1968 models also forbade the winged-spinner knockoff, and any 1968 model year sold in the US (or earlier German delivery cars) should have a hexagonal knockoff nut, to be hammered on and off with the assistance of a special &quot;socket&quot; included with the car from the factory. This hexagonal nut carried on into the later Series 2 and 3. The engine configuration of the US Series 1.5s was the same as is found in the Series 2.

An open 3.8-litre car, actually the first such production car to be completed, was tested by the British magazine &quot; Motor&quot; in 1961 and had a top speed of and could accelerate from in 7.1 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £2,097 including taxes.

The cars submitted for road test by the motoring journals of the time (1961) such as &quot;Motor&quot;, &quot;Autocar&quot; and &quot;Autosport&quot; magazines were prepared by the Jaguar works. This work entailed engine balancing and subtle tuning work such as gas-flowing checking the cylinder heads but otherwise production built engines.

Both of the well-known 1961 road test cars: the E-Type coupé Reg. No. 9600 HP and E-Type Convertible Reg. No. 77 RW, were fitted with Dunlop Racing Tyres on test, which had a larger rolling diameter and lower drag coefficient. This goes some way to explaining the maximum speeds that were obtained under ideal test conditions. The maximum safe rev limit for standard 6-cylinder 3.8-litre E-Type engines is 5,500 rpm. The later 4.2-Litre units had a red marking on the rev counter from just 5,000 rpm. Both 3.8 test cars may have approached 6,000 rpm in top gear when on road test, depending on final drive ratio.

===Series 2 (1968–1971)===
The Series 2 introduced a number of design changes, largely due to U.S. National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration mandates. The most distinctive exterior feature is the absence of the glass headlight covers, which affected several other imported cars, such as the Citroën DS, as well. Unlike other cars, this step was applied worldwide for the E-Type.

Other hallmarks of Series 2 cars are a wrap-around rear bumper, larger front indicators and tail lights re-positioned below the bumpers, and an enlarged grille and twin electric fans to aid cooling.

Additional U.S.-inspired changes included a steering lock which moved the ignition switch to the steering column, replacing the dashboard mounted ignition and push button starter, the symmetrical array of metal toggle switches replaced with plastic rockers, and a collapsible steering column to absorb impact in the event of an accident. New seats allowed the fitment of head restraints, as required by U.S. law beginning in 1969.

The engine is easily identified visually by the change from smooth polished cam covers to a more industrial &quot;ribbed&quot; appearance. It was de-tuned in the US with twin two-barrel Strombergs replacing three SUs. Combined with larger valve clearances horsepower was reduced from 265 to 246 and torque from 283 to 263.

Air conditioning and power steering were available as factory options.

Production according to Robson is 13,490 of all types.

===Series 3 (1971–1974)===
The E-Type Series 3 was introduced in 1971, with a new 5.3 L Jaguar V12 engine, uprated brakes and standard power steering. An automatic transmission, wire wheels and air conditioning were available options. The V12 was equipped with four Zenith carburettors, and as introduced produced a claimed , more torque, and a 0–60 mph acceleration of less than seven seconds. The short wheelbase FHC body style was discontinued, with the Series 3 available only as a convertible and 2+2 coupé. Fifty Series 3 E-Types were constructed as end of model commemorative cars. They featured black exteriors, cinnamon upholstery and commemorative plaques on the glove box (apart from a single green car that Jaguar painted for a long-standing customer). The final production E-Type OTS Roadster was built in June 1974.

The new longer wheelbase offered significantly more room in all directions. The Series 3 is easily identifiable by the large cross-slatted front grille, flared wheel arches, wider tyres, four exhaust tips and a badge on the rear that proclaims it to be a V12. The first published road test of the series 3 was in Jaguar Driver, the club magazine of the Jaguar Drivers&#x27; Club, the only owners club to be officially sanctioned by Sir William Lyons and Jaguar themselves. The road test of a car provided by Jaguar was published ahead of all the national and international magazines.

Cars for the US market were fitted with large projecting rubber bumper over-riders (in 1973 these were on front, in 1974 both front and rear) to meet local impact regulations, but those on European models were considerably smaller. US models also have side indicator repeats on the front wings. There were also a very limited number of six-cylinder Series 3 E-Types built. These were featured in the initial sales procedure but the lack of demand stopped their production. The V12 Open Two Seater and V12 2+2 were factory fitted with Dunlop E70VR − 15-inch tyres on 15 × 6K wire or solid wheels.

Robson lists production at 15,290.

==Motorsport==
Two race version of E-Type were made as test beds, the low drag coupé and lightweight E-Type, both of which were raced:

===Low Drag Coupé (1962)===
Shortly after the introduction of the E-Type, Jaguar wanted to investigate the possibility of building a car more in the spirit of the D-Type racer from which elements of the E-Type&#x27;s styling and design were derived. One car was built to test the concept designed as a coupé. Unlike the steel production E-Types, the LDC used lightweight aluminium. Malcolm Sayer retained the original tub with lighter outer panels riveted and glued to it. The front steel sub frame remained intact, the windshield was given a more pronounced slope, and the rear hatch was welded shut. Rear brake cooling ducts appeared next to the rear windows, and the interior trim was discarded, with only insulation around the transmission tunnel. With the exception of the windscreen, all cockpit glass was Perspex. A tuned version of Jaguar&#x27;s 3.8-litre engine with a wide-angle cylinder head design tested on the D-Type racers was used.

The only test bed car was completed in summer of 1962 but was sold a year later to Jaguar racing driver Dick Protheroe. Since then it has passed through the hands of several collectors on both sides of the Atlantic and is now believed to reside in the private collection of the current Viscount Cowdray.

Peter Lindner, the Jaguar distributor in Germany, had his Lightweight modified by competition department to include the low drag roof and rear panels as part of an effort to win the GT class at Le Mans. Lindner&#x27;s car was more than a match for the Ferrari 250 GTO but mechanical problems forced it out of the race. Lindner was later killed in a racing accident that demolished his car, which has recently been restored.

Jaguar waited too long before committing to a racing program in earnest and what could have been a world champion in 1962 was not competitive by 1965.

===Lightweight E-Type (1963–1964, 2014–present)===
Twelve lightweight cars plus two spare bodies were made by Jaguar. In some ways, this was an evolution of the low drag coupé. It made extensive use of aluminium alloy metal, in the body panels and other components. However, with at least one exception, it remained an open-top car in the spirit of the D-Type to which this car is a more direct successor than the production E-Type which is more of a GT than a sports car. The cars used an aluminium block tuned version of the production 3.8-litre Jaguar engine with output rather than the produced by the &quot;ordinary&quot; version. Factory-built lightweights were homologated by Jaguar with three 45DCOE Weber carburettors in addition to a Lucas mechanical fuel injection system. Early cars were fitted with a close-ratio version of the four speed E-Type gearbox, with some later cars being fitted with a ZF five speed gearbox.
The cars were entered in various races but, unlike the C-Type and D-Type racing cars, they did not win at Le Mans or Sebring but were reasonably successful in private hands and in smaller races.

One lightweight was modified by Jaguar competition department into a low drag coupé (the Lindner/Nöcker car). Another lightweight was modified into a unique low drag design (the Lumsden/Sargent car), by Dr Samir Klat of Imperial College. Along with the factory low drag coupe, this lightweight resided in the early 2000s in the private collection of the current Viscount Cowdray. Many were fitted with more powerful engines as developments occurred. William Towns also produced 2 special bodied V12s badged as the Guyson E12
On 14 May 2014, Jaguar&#x27;s Heritage Business announced it would be building the six &#x27;remaining&#x27; lightweights. The original run of lightweights was meant to be 18 vehicles; however only 12 were built. The new cars, using the unused chassis codes, were hand built to exactly the same specification as the originals. Availability was prioritised for established collectors of Jaguars, with a focus on those who have an interest in historic race cars. The prototype &quot;Car Zero&quot; was shown at Pebble Beach in August 2014.

Bob Jane won the 1963 Australian GT Championship at the wheel of a &quot;lightweight&quot; E-Type.

The Jaguar E-Type was very successful in SCCA Production sports car racing with Group 44 and Bob Tullius taking the B-Production championship with a Series-3 V12 racer in 1975. A few years later, Gran-Turismo Jaguar from Cleveland Ohio campaigned a 4.2-litre six-cylinder FHC racer in SCCA production series, and in 1980 won the National Championship in the SCCA C-Production Class, defeating a fully funded factory Nissan Z-car team with Paul Newman.

==Commemoration==
In 2013, the Jaguar E-Type featured on a &quot;British Auto Legends&quot; postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail.

<doc id="496982" wikidata="Q157884" url="?curid=496982" title="Isabella of Austria">
<text>Isabella of Austria (&quot;Isabel&quot;; 18 July 1501 – 19 January 1526), also known as Elizabeth, was born an Archduchess of Austria and Infanta of Castile from the House of Habsburg, and subsequently became Queen of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, under the Kalmar Union, as the wife of King Christian II. She was the daughter of King Philip I and Queen Joanna of Castile and the sister of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. She ruled Denmark as regent in 1520. 

Her upbringing, overseen by her aunt Archduchess Margaret, was marked by a comprehensive education in Mechelen under the guidance of notable humanists like Juan Luis Vives and Adrian of Utrecht. In 1514, she entered into a strategic marriage with Christian II of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. However, the marriage encountered early challenges with diplomatic tensions arising from Christian II&#x27;s existing relationship with Dyveke Sigbritsdatter, his Dutch mistress. Following Dyveke&#x27;s death in 1517 the relations between Isabella and her husband significantly improved, and Isabella was entrusted with the position of regent in 1520 and political advisor to the king.

In 1523, her husband, King Christian II, was deposed. The political upheaval prompted the Danish royal family, including Isabella and her children, to seek refuge in various European states, such as England, Saxony and the Habsburg Netherlands. During this exile, Isabella strongly advocated for her husband&#x27;s cause. In 1524, she participated in the Imperial Diet in Nürnberg, where she campaigned on behalf of King Christian II, seeking support for his restoration to the Danish throne.

Her travels through Germany, England, and the Netherlands contributed to her evolving religious sympathies for the Protestant movement. Isabella&#x27;s death in 1526 prompted widespread mourning. She received both Protestant and Catholic communion, but the Habsburgs declared that she had died a fervent Catholic.

==Childhood and marriage ==

Isabella was born on 18 July 1501 in Brussels as the third child of Philip the Handsome, ruler of the Habsburg Netherlands and Joanna the Mad, heiress to the Spanish kingdoms of Castile and Aragon. Her father was the son of the reigning Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and his deceased consort Mary, Duchess of Burgundy, while her mother was the daughter of the Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, after whom she is named. She was baptized in Brussels by the Bishop of Cambrai, Henri de Berghes.

She had two older siblings, Eleanor and Charles, as well as three younger siblings Ferdinand, Mary and Catherine. Isabella and her siblings were considered the &quot;noblest children&quot; of her time. Her brothers became the most powerful men in Europe as Holy Roman Emperors. Her sisters became queens in Portugal and France, Bohemia and Hungary, and Portugal, respectively.

=== Upbringing at Mechelen ===
Following the early death of Isabella&#x27;s father in September 1506, her mother&#x27;s mental health began to deteriorate. Isabella, along with her brother, Charles, and her sisters, Eleanor and Mary, was put into the care of her paternal aunt, Archduchess Margaret, governor of the Habsburg Netherlands, while the two other siblings, Ferdinand and Catherine, remained in Castile. Eleanor, Isabella, and Mary were educated together at their aunt&#x27;s court in Mechelen. 

Margaret, a wise, staunch Catholic, and politically experienced woman, played a significant role in shaping Isabella&#x27;s upbringing. Under her aunt&#x27;s care, Isabella received a comprehensive education from the learned renaissance humanists of the time. Her upbringing at the opulent court in Mechelen afforded Isabella the finest education of her time, and among her notable tutors were Juan Luis Vives and the later Pope Adrian VI, who was associated with the pre-Reformation movement known as the &quot;Brethren of the Common Life.&quot; The Brethren were viewed favourably by Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon for their emphasis on Christian devotion and self-sacrifice. Many members of this movement later aligned with the Protestant cause in its divergence from the authority of the papal church. 

In her education, Isabella received instruction from Vives, covering Greek and Latin studies. The curriculum included a focus on the Gospels, St. Paul&#x27;s Epistles, and select portions of the Old Testament. 

Margaret acted as a maternal figure to her brother&#x27;s children, and in October 1507, she informed her father, Emperor Maximilian I, who closely followed and actively participated in matters concerning his grandchildren, of Isabella and Maria contracting measles, with Eleonora showing symptoms. Due to the contagious nature of the disease and winter conditions, Margaret and Archduke Charles opted to stay in Brussels rather than returning to Mechelen as initially intended. 

The household of the imperial children was headed by First Chamberlain, Charles de Croy-Chimay and Grand Mistress (stewardess) Anna de Beaumont, a Spanish-Navarrese noblewoman of French origin, who had been Juana’s former lady-in-waiting, arriving in the Low Countries with the duchess in 1498. 

=== Matrimonial negotiations ===
Margaret heavily participated in the marriage negotiations of her nieces, including Isabella&#x27;s. In 1509, Isabella&#x27;s grandfather Emperor Maximilian proposed Henry of Navarre, son of John III, as a possible spouse, but the proposition was presumably dismissed by Margaret. By 1510, there were discussions about Isabel’s possible marriage to Charles II, Duke of Guelders, son of Adolf, Duke of Guelders. However, both Margaret and Maximilian harbored reservations about sending the young princess to Guelders, questioning the match&#x27;s prestige. The Lord of Guelders held a lower rank as a duke, and their family&#x27;s objective was to wed their daughters into royal houses. 

Isabella&#x27;s fortune, her succession rights, and her connections made her a valuable pawn in the royal marriage market. In 1513, Copenhagen hosted negotiations for the topic of the new King Christian II&#x27;s marriage, leading to an agreement to pursue one of Philip the Beautiful&#x27;s daughters. This alliance promised strategic advantages, creating kinship with the emperor and making King Christian the brother-in-law of Archduke Charles, a powerful figure in key Dutch cities. Furthermore, Habsburg-Austrian princesses were known for substantial dowries. King Christian enlisted the help of his uncle, Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, who, well-connected with the Emperor, inquired about suitable matches at the Imperial Court. In late October and early November, a national assembly in Viborg revisited the matrimonial issue, resolving to send an embassy to Emperor Maximilian for the formal proposal of Archduchess Isabella&#x27;s hand. Bishop Gottschalk von Ahlefeldt, alongside Councilors Mogens Gjø and Albert Jepsen Ravensberg, was chosen to lead this envoy.

The king of Denmark had first intended to marry Isabella&#x27;s eldest sister Eleanor of Austria, but the Habsburgs considered Eleanor too valuable for the throne of Denmark, because as the eldest sister, there was a likelihood that her progeny may succeed. Therefore, Isabella was selected for the Danish king. The Emperor expressed approval for the potential alliance with Denmark, a sentiment that found favor in the Low Countries. This alliance was viewed as a strategic opportunity to enhance trade access to the Baltic for merchants from Bruges and Amsterdam.
The envoyship reached the imperial court in Linz in early April, engaging in month-long negotiations culminating in the signing of a marriage contract on 29 April 1514. The substantial dowry amounted to 250,000 Rhenish &quot;gulden&quot;, approximately equal to 800 million DKK today (about 118 million USD), with contributions from Spain and the Burgundian territories. Princess Isabella was also assured an annual income of 25,000 Rhenish &quot;gulden&quot;.

On 11 July 1514, one week short of her 13th birthday, Isabella was married by proxy to King Christian II of Denmark with Emperor Maximilian I, her grandfather, standing in for the king. The Bishop of Cambrai, , presided over the wedding which was conducted at the Brussels Palace.

She remained in the Netherlands, but is said to have fallen in love with her spouse at the sight of his painting, and asked to be taken to Denmark. A year after the wedding, the Archbishop of Nidaros, , was sent to escort her to Copenhagen. The Danish fleet arrived in Veere, Zeeland on 1 July 1515, and later than month, a tearful Isabella departed on 16 July 1515. The fleet encountered a violent tempest, that dispersed the Danish convoy along the shores of Jutland. The vessel carrying the Queen narrowly averted shipwreck, and upon safely reaching Helsingør in the start of August, she penned a poignant letter to the Margaret: &quot;Madame, if I could choose for myself, I should be with you now; for to be parted from you is the most grievous thing in the world to me&quot;&quot;. Isabella and Christian had their initial encounter at Hvidøre, Christian II&#x27;s summer residence, where he greeted her with an elaborate entourage of over 1000 individuals.

The marriage was ratified on 12 August 1515, when she was 14 years old.

==Queen==

Isabella was crowned Queen of Denmark and Norway, the same day of her matrimonial ratification, on 12 August 1515 at Copenhagen Castle by the Archbishop of Lund, . She began using another version of her name, Elisabeth, but the relationship between her and her new family and Christian was quite cool during the first years of the marriage. The King&#x27;s Dutch mistress, Dyveke Sigbritsdatter, had been with him since 1507, and he was not about to give her up for a teenager. Dyveke&#x27;s mother, Sigbrit Willoms, was also influential at court, and Isabella was given less influence than both of them. This angered the Emperor, and caused some diplomatic strife between him and King Christian, but the matter was resolved when Dyveke died in 1517, and Isabella&#x27;s relationship with her husband improved vastly over the next few years; her relationship with Sigbrit Willoms improved as well, and both women acted as political advisors to the king. From 1516, Anne Meinstrup was head lady-in-waiting of her court.

In 1520, Christian took the throne of Sweden, thereby making Isabella Queen of Sweden. After taking Stockholm, he asked the Swedish representatives to turn it and the regency of Sweden over to Isabella if he himself should die when his children were minors. She was to be the last Queen of Sweden who was also Queen of Denmark during the Kalmar union, but she in fact never visited Sweden; pregnant at the time of her spouse&#x27;s accession to the throne of Sweden, she did not follow him there. Isabella served as the regent of Denmark during Christian&#x27;s stay in Sweden. Her husband was deposed as king of Sweden the following year. King Christian imprisoned many Swedish noblewomen, related to rebellious Swedish nobles, at the infamous &quot;Blåtårn&quot; (&quot;Blue Tower&quot;) of Copenhagen Castle, including Christina Gyllenstierna, Cecilia Månsdotter and Margareta Eriksdotter Vasa. Gustav I of Sweden used their purported harsh treatment in captivity in his propaganda against Christian II and claimed that the Danish monarch starved the women and children, who only survived by the mercy shown to them by the queen of Denmark, Isabella of Austria. 

When King Christian was deposed in 1523 by disloyal noblemen supporting his uncle, Duke Frederick, the new king wanted to be on good terms with Isabella&#x27;s family. He wrote her a personal letter in her native German, offering her a dowager queen&#x27;s pension and permitting her to stay in Denmark under his protection while King Christian fled to the Low Countries. But Isabella replied in Latin &quot;ubi rex meus, ibi regnum meum&quot; (&quot;where my king is, there is my kingdom&quot;).

==Exile==

Isabella left Denmark with her husband and their children after her husband was deposed in 1523 and travelled to the Netherlands. Isabella and Christian travelled around Germany in an attempt to gain help for Christian&#x27;s restoration to the throne. Isabella made her own negotiations with her relatives, and also accompanied her husband on his travels. 

The Danish royal family then journeyed to England. While in England, they had an audience with Henry VIII at the Royal Palace in Greenwich and were later accommodated at Hampton Court Palace. They visited Saxony in 1523 and Berlin in 1523–1524. In Berlin, Isabella became interested in the teachings of Luther, and felt sympathy for Protestantism, however she never converted officially. When she visited Nürnberg in 1524, she received communion in the Protestant way, which so enraged her birth family, the Habsburgs, that Christian decided that she should hide her Protestant views in the future, for political reasons.

In the spring of 1525, Isabella caught some kind of serious illness, which worsened after she travelled through a storm later that year, and lasted all summer. The former queen died at the castle of Zwijnaarde near Ghent aged twenty-four, on 19 January 1526. She received both Protestant and Catholic communion, but the Habsburgs declared that she had died a convinced Catholic. Her religious sympathies, and whether she was a Protestant or a Catholic after 1524, have been debated. At her deathbed, she gave the cause of her husband&#x27;s restoration to her aunt, the regent of the Netherlands, Margaret of Austria. She was buried on 4 February 1526 at the Saint Peter&#x27;s Abbey, Ghent.

Isabella&#x27;s early death was mourned not only in the Low Countries but also in her husband&#x27;s realms. Nationwide funeral services were held, and expressions of grief were widespread for the Princess known as &quot;the mother of her people.&quot; Testimonies to her worth were abundant, including a letter from Henry VIII of England, who regarded her as a sister. Martin Luther also paid tribute to her in his treatise on Holy Women.

Her fifteenth generation great-granddaughter, Princess Isabella of Denmark, was named after her.

<doc id="496983" wikidata="Q213204" url="?curid=496983" title="Territorial waters">
<text>Territorial waters are informally an area of water where a sovereign state has jurisdiction, including internal waters, the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone, and potentially the extended continental shelf (these components are sometimes collectively called the maritime zones). In a narrower sense, the term is often used as a synonym for the territorial sea.

Vessels have different rights and duties when passing through each area defined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), one of the most ratified treaties. States cannot exercise their jurisdiction in waters beyond the exclusive economic zone, which are known as the high seas.

== Baseline ==

Normally, the baseline is the low-water line along the coast as marked on large-scale charts that the coastal state recognizes. This is either the low-water mark closest to the shore or an unlimited distance from permanently exposed land, provided that some portion of elevations exposed at low tide but covered at high tide (such as mud flats) is within of permanently exposed land.

Straight baselines can alternatively be defined connecting fringing islands along a coast, across the mouths of rivers, or with certain restrictions across the mouths of bays. In this case, a bay is defined as &quot;a well-marked indentation whose penetration is in such proportion to the width of its mouth as to contain land-locked waters and constitute more than a mere curvature of the coast. An indentation is not, however, regarded as a bay unless its area is as large as, or larger than, that of the semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that indentation&quot;. The baseline across the bay must also be no more than in length.

== Internal waters ==

Internal waters are landward of the baseline. The coastal state has sovereignty over internal waters, and can enforce domestic law on vessels in internal waters, including to prohibit innocent passage. Lakes, rivers and bays are considered internal waters.

&quot;Archipelagic waters&quot; within the outermost islands of an archipelagic state, such as Indonesia or the Philippines, are also internal waters, but the state must allow innocent passage through them. However, archipelagic states can limit innocent passage to designated sea lanes within these waters. Each island in the archipelago can have its own baseline.

== Territorial sea ==
Territorial sea is a belt of coastal waters extending at most from the baseline (usually the mean low-water mark) of a coastal state. The territorial sea is sovereign territory, although foreign ships (military and civilian) are allowed innocent passage through it, or transit passage for straits; this sovereignty also extends to the airspace over and seabed below. In international law, adjustment of these boundaries is called maritime delimitation.

A state&#x27;s territorial sea extends up to from its baseline. If this overlaps with another state&#x27;s territorial sea, the border is taken as the median point between the states&#x27; baselines, unless the states agree otherwise. A state can also choose to claim a smaller territorial sea.

Conflicts have occurred when a coastal nation claims an entire gulf as its territorial waters while other nations only recognize the more restrictive definitions of the UNCLOS. Claims that draw the baseline at more than 24 nautical miles (two 12 nm limits) are judged excessive by the US. Two conflicts occurred in the Gulf of Sidra where Libya drew a line in excess of and claimed the entire enclosed gulf as its territorial waters. The US exercised freedom of navigation rights, resulting in the 1981 and 1989 Gulf of Sidra incidents.

== Contiguous zone ==
The contiguous zone is a band of water extending farther from the outer edge of the territorial sea to up to from the baseline. Inside, a state can exercise limited control to prevent or punish &quot;infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea&quot;.

The zone is typically wide. However, it can be wider when a state claims a territorial sea of less than 12 nautical miles, or narrower if it would otherwise overlap with another state&#x27;s contiguous zone. Unlike the territorial sea, there is no standard rule for resolving such conflicts and states must negotiate a compromise. The US invoked a contiguous zone out to 24 nmi from the baseline on 29 September 1999.

== Exclusive economic zone ==

An exclusive economic zone (EEZ) extends from the baseline to almost and therefore includes the contiguous zone. A coastal nation has control of all economic resources inside its exclusive economic zone, including fishing, mining, oil exploration, and pollution of those resources. However, it cannot prohibit passage or loitering above, on, or under the surface of the sea that complies with the laws and regulations adopted by the coastal state in accordance with the provisions of the UN Convention, within that portion of its exclusive economic zone beyond its territorial sea.

Before the convention, coastal nations arbitrarily extended their territorial waters to attempt to control activities that are now regulated by the exclusive economic zone, such as offshore oil exploration or fishing rights (see Cod Wars).

The EEZ is still popularly, but incorrectly, regarded as coastal nation&#x27;s territorial waters.

== Continental shelf ==

=== Definition ===
Article 76 of the UN convention defines &quot;continental shelf&quot; of coastal countries.

A state&#x27;s continental shelf extends to the outer edge of the continental margin but at least from the baselines of the territorial sea if the continental margin does not stretch that far. Coastal states can explore and exploit the seabed and the natural resources on or beneath it. However, other states may lay cables and pipelines if authorized by the coastal state. The outer limit of a country&#x27;s continental shelf cannot stretch beyond of the baseline or beyond from the isobath, which is a line connecting the depths of the seabed at 2,500 meters.

The outer edge of the continental margin for the purposes of this article is defined as:

: *a series of lines joining points not more than apart where the thickness of sedimentary rocks is at least 1% of the height of the continental shelf above the foot of the continental slope; or
: *a series of lines joining points not more than 60 nautical miles apart that is not more than 60 nautical miles from the foot of the continental margin.
The foot of the continental slope is determined as the point of maximum change in the gradient at its base.

=== Extended continental shelf===

The portion of the continental shelf beyond the 200 nautical mile limit is also known as the &quot;extended continental shelf&quot;. Countries wishing to delimit their outer continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles have to submit scientific information for the basis of their claim to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. The Commission then validates or makes recommendations on the scientific basis for the extended continental shelf claim. The scientific judgement of the Commission shall be final and binding. Validated extended continental shelf claims overlapping any demarcation between two or more parties are decided by bilateral or multilateral negotiation, not by the commission.

Countries have ten years after ratifying UNCLOS to lodge their submissions to extend their continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, or by 13 May 2009 for countries where the convention was ratified before 13 May 1999. As of 1 June 2009, 51 submissions have been lodged with the commission, of which eight have been deliberated by the commission and have had recommendations issued. The eight are (in the order of date of submission): Russian Federation; Brazil; Australia; Ireland; New Zealand; the joint submission by France, Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom; Norway and Mexico.

=== Rights over the continental shelf ===
Articles 77 to 81 define the rights of a country over its continental shelf.

A coastal nation has control of all resources on or under its continental shelf, living or not, but no control over any living organisms above the shelf that are beyond its exclusive economic zone. This gives it the right to conduct hydrocarbon exploration and drilling works.

== Background ==

From the eighteenth century until the mid twentieth century, the territorial waters of the British Empire, the United States, France and many other nations were three nautical miles (5.6 km) wide. Originally, this was the distance of a cannon shot, hence the portion of an ocean that a sovereign state could defend from shore. However, Iceland claimed , Norway and Sweden claimed , and Spain claimed during this period. During incidents such as nuclear weapons testing and fisheries disputes some nations arbitrarily extended their maritime claims to as much as or even . Since the late 20th century the &quot;12 mile limit&quot; has become almost universally accepted. The United Kingdom extended its territorial waters from by the (c. 49).

During the League of Nations Codification Conference in 1930, the issue of establishing international legislation on territorial waters was raised, but no agreement was reached.

Claims by legislation to the adjacent continental shelf and fishing was first made by the United States government immediately following the Second World War. On 28 September 1945, US President Harry S. Truman issued two proclamations that established government control of natural resources in areas adjacent to the coastline. One of these proclamation was titled &quot;Policy of the United States With Respect to the Natural Resources of the Subsoil and Sea Bed of the Continental Shelf&quot;, and stipulated in its operative clause:

the Government of the United States regards the natural resources of the subsoil and sea bed of the continental shelf beneath the high seas but contiguous to the coasts of the United States as appertaining to the United States, subject to its jurisdiction and control.
The second proclamation was titled &quot;Policy of the United States With Respect to Coastal Fisheries in Certain Areas of the High Seas&quot;, and stated in its operative clause:

the Government of the United States regards it as proper to establish conservation zones in those areas of the high seas contiguous to the coasts of the United States wherein fishing activities have been or in the future may be developed and maintained on a substantial scale.
Following the US presidential proclamation, the issue of legally determining territorial waters by international agreement was raised, and in its first session in 1949, the International Law Commission of the United Nations added the subject to its agenda.

The important issue of the breadth of territorial waters could not be resolved at either the UNCLOS I (1956-1958) or UNCLOS II (1960) conferences, with neither the two major contenders of a 3-mile or 12-mile limit reaching the required two-thirds support. This lack of agreement had the potential to lead to serious international disputes. It was only at the UNCLOS III (1973-1982) conference, whose provisions did not come into force until 1994, that this issue was resolved at twelve nautical miles.

== Miscellaneous ==
Pirate radio broadcasting from artificial marine fixtures or anchored ships can be controlled by the affected coastal nation or other nations wherever that broadcast may originate, whether in the territorial sea, exclusive economic zone, the continental shelf or even on the high seas.

Thus a coastal nation has total control over its internal waters, slightly less control over territorial waters, and ostensibly even less control over waters within the contiguous zones. However, it has total control of economic resources within its exclusive economic zone as well as those on or under its continental shelf.

Throughout this article, distances measured in nautical miles are exact legal definitions, while those in kilometres are approximate conversions that are not stated in any law or treaty.

Federal nations, such as the United States, divide control over certain waters between the federal government and the individual states. (See tidelands.)

== Territorial sea claim ==

Maritime controversies involve two dimensions: (a) territorial sovereignty, which are a legacy of history; and (b) relevant jurisdictional rights and interests in maritime boundaries, which are mainly due to differing interpretations of the law of the sea.

<text>Castleman disease (CD) describes a group of rare lymphoproliferative disorders that involve enlarged lymph nodes, and a broad range of inflammatory symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Whether Castleman disease should be considered an autoimmune disease, cancer, or infectious disease is currently unknown.

Castleman disease includes at least three distinct subtypes: unicentric Castleman disease (UCD), human herpesvirus 8 associated multicentric Castleman disease (HHV-8-associated MCD), and idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD). These are differentiated by the number and location of affected lymph nodes and the presence of human herpesvirus 8, a known causative agent in a portion of cases. Correctly classifying the Castleman disease subtype is important, as the three subtypes vary significantly in symptoms, clinical findings, disease mechanism, treatment approach, and prognosis. All forms involve overproduction of cytokines and other inflammatory proteins by the body&#x27;s immune system as well as characteristic abnormal lymph node features that can be observed under the microscope. In the United States, approximately 4,300 to 5,200 new cases are diagnosed each year.

Castleman disease is named after Benjamin Castleman, who first described the disease in 1954. The Castleman Disease Collaborative Network is the largest organization dedicated to accelerating research and treatment for Castleman disease as well as improving patient care.

== Classification ==
Castleman disease (CD) can involve one or more enlarged lymph nodes in a single region of the body (unicentric CD, UCD) or it can involve multiple enlarged lymph node regions (multi centric CD, MCD). Doctors classify the disease into different categories based on the number of enlarged lymph node regions and the underlying cause. There are four established subtypes of Castleman disease:

=== Unicentric Castleman disease ===

Unicentric Castleman disease (UCD) involves a single enlarged lymph node or multiple enlarged lymph nodes within a single region of the body that display microscopic features consistent with Castleman disease. It is also sometimes called localized Castleman disease.

The exact cause of UCD is unknown, but appears to be due to a genetic change that occurs in the lymph node tissue, most similar to a benign tumor. In about half cases of UCD, individuals exhibit no symptoms (asymptomatic). Sometimes symptoms stem are secondary to compression of surrounding structures by rapidly enlarging lymph nodes.

Some UCD patients, however, experience systemic inflammatory symptoms such as fever, fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, and skin rash as well as laboratory abnormalities such as elevated C-reactive protein.

Surgery is considered by experts to be the first-line treatment option for all cases of UCD. Sometimes, removing the enlarged lymph node(s) is not possible. If surgical excision is not possible, treatment is recommended for symptomatic patients. If symptoms are due to compression, then rituximab is recommended. If symptoms are due to an inflammatory syndrome, then anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) therapy is recommended. If these treatments are not effective, then radiation may be needed.

=== Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) ===
In this form, patients have multiple regions of enlarged lymph nodes with characteristic microscopic features, flu-like symptoms, and organ dysfunction due to excessive cytokines or inflammatory proteins. MCD is further classified into three categories based on underlying cause: POEMS-associated MCD, HHV-8-associated MCD, and idiopathic MCD (iMCD).

=== POEMS-associated MCD ===
A cancerous cell population found in patients with POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasma cell disorder, and skin changes) can cause MCD in a fraction of patients by producing cytokines that initiate a cytokine storm. In patients who have both POEMS-associated MCD, treatment should be directed at the POEMS syndrome.

=== HHV-8-associated multicentric Castleman disease (HHV-8-MCD) ===
HHV-8-associated MCD patients have multiple regions of enlarged lymph nodes and episodic inflammatory symptoms due to uncontrolled infection with HHV-8. HHV-8-associated MCD is most commonly diagnosed in HIV infected or otherwise immunocompromised individuals that are not able to control HHV-8 infection. Thus, HHV-8-associated MCD patients may experience additional symptoms related to their HIV infection or other conditions. First-line treatment of HHV-8-associated MCD is rituximab, a drug used to eliminate a type of immune cell called the B lymphocyte. It is highly effective for HHV-8-associated MCD, but occasionally antivirals and/or cytotoxic chemotherapies are needed.

=== Idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) ===

Idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD), which is the most common form of MCD, occurs for an unknown cause. There is no evidence of POEMS syndrome, HHV-8, or any other cancer or infectious disease. Though all forms of MCD involve excessive production of cytokines and a cytokine storm, iMCD has important differences in symptoms, disease course, and treatment from POEMS-associated MCD and HHV-8-associated MCD. First line treatment for iMCD is anti-IL-6 therapy with siltuximab (or tocilizumab, if siltuximab is not available). Siltuximab is the only FDA-approved treatment for iMCD and patients who respond to siltuximab tend to have long-term responses. In critically ill patients, chemotherapy and corticosteroids are recommended if the patient is demonstrating disease progression while on siltuximab. Approximately half of iMCD patients do not improve with anti-IL-6 therapy. In patients where siltuximab is not effective, other treatments such as rituximab and sirolimus can be used.

iMCD can be further sub-classified into three clinical subgroups:

iMCD with TAFRO Syndrome (iMCD-TAFRO): characterized by acute episodes of Thrombocytopenia, Anasarca, Fever, Renal dysfunction or myelofibrosis, and Organomegaly.

iMCD with idiopathic plasmacytic lymphadenopathy (iMCD-IPL): characterized by thrombocytosis, hypergammaglobulinemia, and a more chronic disease course.

iMCD, not otherwise specified (iMCD-NOS): is diagnosed in iMCD patients who do not have iMCD-TAFRO or iMCD-IPL.

== Pathology ==
Castleman disease is defined by a range of characteristic features seen on microscopic analysis (histology) of tissue from enlarged lymph nodes. Variations in the lymph node tissues of patients with CD have led to 4 histological classifications:
* Plasmacytic: increased number of follicles with large hyperplastic germinal centers and sheetlike plasmacytosis (increased number plasma cells). Germinal centers may also show regressed features
* Hyaline vascular: regressed germinal centers, follicular dendritic cell prominence or dysplasia, hypervascularity in interfollicular regions, sclerotic vessels, prominent mantle zones with an &quot;onion-skin&quot; appearance.
* Hypervascular: similar to hyaline vascular features, but seen in iMCD rather than UCD. Includes regressed germinal centers, follicular dendritic cell prominence, hypervascularity in interfollicular regions, and prominent mantle zones with an &quot;onion-skin&quot; appearance.
* Mixed: presence of a combination of hyaline vascular/hypervascular and plasmacytic features in the same lymph node.

UCD most commonly demonstrates hyaline vascular features, but plasmacytic features or a mix of features may also be seen. iMCD more commonly demonstrates plasmacytic features, but hypervascular features or a mix of features are also seen. All cases of HHV-8-associated MCD are thought to demonstrate plasmablastic features—similar to plasmacytic features, but with plasmablasts present. The clinical utility of subtyping Castleman disease by histologic features is uncertain, as histologic subtypes do not consistently predict disease severity or treatment response. Guidelines recommend against using histologic subtype to guide treatment decisions. Staining with latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA-1), a marker for HHV-8 infection, should be measured in all forms of Castleman disease but is positive only in HHV-8-associated MCD.

Diseases other than Castleman disease can present with similar histologic findings in lymph node tissue, including:
* Infectious causes: Epstein-Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis
* Autoimmune diseases: Systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis
* Lymphoproliferative disorders: lymphoma, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome

== History ==
Unicentric Castleman disease was first described in a case series by Benjamin Castleman in 1956. By 1984, a number of case reports had been published describing a multicentric variant of the disease and with some reports describing an association with Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma. In 1995, the association between HHV-8 and Castleman disease was described in patients with HIV. Formal diagnostic criteria and definition of the disease was established in 2016, which will allow for better understanding and the ability to appropriately track and research CD. In 2017, international consensus diagnostic criteria for idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) were established for the first time. In 2018, the first treatment guidelines for iMCD were established. In 2020 the first evidence based diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines were established for unicentric Castleman disease.

World Castleman Disease Day was established in 2018 and is held every year on July 23. This date was chosen for Benjamin Castleman&#x27;s initial case series describing Castleman disease, which was published in July 1956, and the diagnostic criteria for idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease, which were published in the journal &quot;Blood&quot; on March 23, 2017.

==Castleman Disease Collaborative Network==

The Castleman Disease Collaborative Network (CDCN), founded in 2012, is the largest organization dedicated to Castleman disease. It is a global initiative dedicated to research and treatment for Castleman disease (CD) and to improve survival for all patients with CD. The CDCN works to achieve this by facilitating collaboration among the global research community, mobilizing resources, strategically investing in high-impact research, and supporting patients and people supporting them.

<doc id="496985" wikidata="Q436050" url="?curid=496985" title="Dyveke Sigbritsdatter">
<text>Dyveke Sigbritsdatter or &quot;Dyveke Willomsdatter&quot;, (1490 – 21 September 1517), in Denmark normally known as &quot;&quot;Dyveke&quot; (in modern Dutch &quot;duifje&quot;&quot; means &quot;little dove&quot;), was the mistress to Christian II of Denmark.

Dyveke was a commoner, the daughter of the Dutch merchant Sigbrit Willoms, who lived in Bergen in Norway. Dyveke became the mistress to Christian II in 1507 or 1509. They met in Bergen, and Christian took Dyveke with him to Oslo, where he was regent, and to Copenhagen, when he became king in 1513. Their relationship has been the inspiration of many poets, but in fact little is known about it. The mother of Dyveke, Sigbrit, acted as an advisor to the king, which was much disliked, especially by the nobility, and every effort was therefore made to separate Dyveke and Christian, which would ensure the departure also of Sigbrit from the court. Whether Dyveke herself had any political influence is unknown. 
Though Christian married Isabella of Austria and had her crowned in 1515, he refused to end his relationship with Dyveke. This created tension between him and his brother-in-law, the future Emperor Charles V. In 1516, the Emperor demanded that Dyveke and her mother be sent away, but Christian refused.

Dyveke died in the summer of 1517, possibly by eating poisoned cherries. Her death led to the execution of nobleman Torben Oxe but his guilt has never been proved, and both an initiative by the court of the Emperor Maximilian I or even an accidental poisoning have been suggested as an explanation. Her mother Sigbrit went on to become Christian II&#x27;s financial advisor. Nothing is recorded for Sigbrit after 1523 although one assumption has her imprisoned for witchcraft, dying in 1532.
