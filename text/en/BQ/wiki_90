<text>Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There is a book by American conservative political commentator David Brooks. It was first published in 2000.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;bobo&quot;, Brooks&#x27; most famously used term, is an abbreviated form of the words &quot;bourgeois&quot; and &quot;bohemian&quot;, suggesting a fusion of two distinct social classes (the counter-cultural, hedonistic and artistic bohemian, and the white collar, capitalist bourgeois). The term is used by Brooks to describe the 1990s successors of the yuppies. Often of the corporate upper class, they claim highly tolerant views of others, purchase expensive and exotic items, and believe American society to be meritocratic. The term is also widely used in France.

==Thesis==
The thesis is that during the late 1970s a new establishment arose that represented a fusion between the bourgeois world of capitalist enterprise and the hippie values of the bohemian counterculture. He refers to these individuals as &quot;bobos&quot;, a portmanteau for &quot;bourgeois bohemians&quot;.

==Description and behaviour==
Bobos are noted for their aversion to conspicuous consumption while emphasizing the &quot;necessities&quot; of life. Brooks argues that they feel guilty in the way typical of the so-called &quot;greed era&quot; of the 1980s so they prefer to spend extravagantly on kitchens, showers, and other common facilities of everyday life. They &quot;feel&quot; for the labor and working class and often purchase American-made goods rather than less expensive imports from developing nations.

Bobos often relate to money as a means rather than an end; they do not disdain money but use it to achieve their ends rather than considering wealth as a desirable end in itself.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; noted in 2007 that, &quot;&#x27;Made in the U.S.A.&#x27; used to be a label flaunted primarily by consumers in the Rust Belt and rural regions. Increasingly, it is a status symbol for cosmopolitan bobos, and it is being exploited by the marketers who cater to them.&quot;

<text>John Leslie (born John Leslie Stott; 22 February 1965) is a Scottish former television and radio presenter. Debuting on the Music Box channel in 1987, he later presented BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, and ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot; and the gameshow &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. He was also the studio host for the first series of the UK version of &quot;Survivor&quot;.

==Early life and career==
John Leslie Stott was born in Edinburgh, the brother of Grant Stott. He attended Liberton High School and James Gillespie&#x27;s High School. Leslie spent his early years in the church choir, studied music on leaving school, and worked as a DJ in Copenhagen. Prior to his television career he worked as a DJ in nightclubs in Edinburgh and Newcastle, becoming resident DJ at the Blu Bambu club.

His first television work was on Yorkshire Television, when he hosted Music Box&#x27;s all-night music show, &quot;Formula One&quot; which was the English language version of the German TV music show which was shown on Super Channel and in some ITV regions in 1987 and 1988 where he would link music performances from the German original from a UK studio, in 1989.

==Personal life==
Leslie had a widely publicised relationship with nurse Abi Titmuss, who became a star in her own right when a video Leslie filmed of her having sex with another woman was leaked.

Leslie is also known for his affinity for football. He played in goal for the Scottish team in the Celebrity World Cup Soccer Six tournament, which took place on 14 May 2006 at St Andrew&#x27;s, the home of Birmingham City. He is a supporter of Hibernian.

Leslie now works in property development and lives with his girlfriend Kate Moore.

==Television==

===&quot;Blue Peter&quot;===
On 20 April 1989, Leslie became &quot;Blue Peter&quot;″s first Scottish presenter, and also the tallest at 1.93 m (6&#x27; 4&quot;). He was the second &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenter to take part in the London Marathon, following Peter Duncan. He finished in four hours, thirty-six minutes.

On his last show he was set John&#x27;s Final Challenge which involved abseiling down BBC Television Centre, completing a velcro and wheelbarrow obstacle course, then trampolining and conducting an orchestra in the studio. Leslie presented &quot;Blue Peter&quot; with Caron Keating, Yvette Fielding, Diane-Louise Jordan, Anthea Turner and Tim Vincent.

===&quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;===
Leslie succeeded Bradley Walsh as the main presenter of the British version of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. He was succeeded in 2001 by Paul Hendy. That year, he turned up on &quot;Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank&quot;.

===&quot;This Morning&quot;===
From series 11 in 1999 Leslie, alongside Fern Britton, was a regular presenter of the Friday edition. When Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan departed the show in 2001, they were replaced by Coleen Nolan and Twiggy, with Britton and Leslie remaining on Fridays. However, Nolan and Twiggy proved less popular with viewers, so Britton and Leslie took on the full job of presenting the show, bringing the ratings back up to around one million. In 2002, after allegations of sexual offences were made in the press against Leslie, he was dismissed from the programme and replaced by Phillip Schofield from Mondays to Thursdays and by Eamonn Holmes on Fridays (with Ruth Langsford).

==Music and radio==
In December 2003, Leslie appeared in the music video for the Christmas single &quot;Proper Crimbo&quot;, released by &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot; creator Leigh Francis, alongside Matthew Wright in a spoof of their presumed rivalry.

In November 2012, John Leslie began to present Friday&#x27;s Drivetime show on 98.8 Castle FM, hoping to revive his career as a radio DJ. In March 2013, Leslie was among the Castle FM presenters who walked out in a disagreement with their management, only to be locked out when they tried to return. By the end of the year, the radio station had become automated, with no presenters.

On 28 March 2014, it was announced that Leslie would begin presenting his own Saturday (10:00 to 14:00) radio show across the Scottish Bauer Radio AM network, debuting the following day.

==Sexual assault allegations==
In October 2002, Ulrika Jonsson had written in her autobiography, &quot;Honest&quot;, that &quot;an acquaintance&quot; had raped her when she was 19. Amid media speculation, television presenter Matthew Wright mistakenly named Leslie as the alleged predator on &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot;. Jonsson has never said whether the correct person was named, and Leslie was never charged for offences against Jonsson. Wright has since apologised to Leslie and said he named him in error. Despite this, the story was widely covered in the tabloids.

Other women made accusations of indecent assault against Leslie, and he was arrested in December 2002 on one count of rape and two concerning indecent assault, being then released on bail after being interviewed by the police. He was charged in June 2003 with assaulting a woman twice between 25 and 28 May 1997. The prosecution dropped the charges against Leslie at Southwark Crown Court on 31 July 2003 after new information from the alleged victim. On the court steps after the end of the hearing, Leslie said that he had &quot;been to hell and back&quot; and that he had &quot;maintained [his] innocence throughout&quot;.

In July 2018, Leslie was cleared of assaulting a woman at a nightclub in June 2017 after a two-day trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court. Leslie announced that he was going to make a complaint against Police Scotland.

In June 2019, Leslie was charged with sexually assaulting a then 30-year-old woman in Westminster during December 2008. That August, Leslie pleaded not guilty at Southwark Crown Court and he was released on bail. He was cleared of this charge by a jury on 19 October 2020. Judge Deborah Taylor subsequently told him: &quot;You, for the second time, leave this court without a stain on your character and I hope it will be the last time you have to attend.&quot;

<doc id="507188" wikidata="Q5204511" url="?curid=507188" title="Wizards Play Network">
<text>The Wizards Play Network (WPN) is the official sanctioning body for competitive play in &quot;&quot; (&quot;Magic&quot;) and various other games produced by Wizards of the Coast and its subsidiaries, such as Avalon Hill. Originally, it was known as the DCI (formerly Duelists&#x27; Convocation International) but was rebranded in 2008. The WPN provided game rules, tournament operating procedures, and other materials to private tournament organizers and players. It also operated a judge certification program to provide consistent rules enforcement and promote fair play. The DCI&#x27;s name was still commonly used, however, to refer to the player registration number (&quot;DCI number&quot;) until 2020.

== History ==

The DCI was formed in late 1993, and developed &quot;Magic&quot;&#x27;s first tournament sanctioning and deckbuilding rules. Over the next decades, it filled several roles in &quot;Magic&quot;&#x27;s organized play. It maintained policy documents as changes were needed, addressed new questions and supported new product releases. It maintained the registration systems for both players and sanctioned tournaments. It also developed and operated a certification program for tournament officials, known as Judges.

Over time, the roles of the DCI were gradually absorbed by other organizations, such as Wizards of the Coast itself through its Wizards Play Network (WPN) program, or through the independent . Part of the 2008 Wizards Play Network rebrand was &quot;in response to feedback from organizers, particularly retailers&quot;. This also opened up &quot;Magic&quot; pre-release tournaments to participating WPN stores. Per the industry trade &quot;ICv2&quot;, the WPN was designed to include &quot;a wider range of casual formats, including leagues, multi-player, and team play. Current sanctioned programs will remain; the new programs will be in addition to those that already exist&quot;; previously, &quot;the entire array of &quot;Magic&quot; organized play events was all one-on-one sanctioned tournament play&quot;. In May 2009, Wizards of the Coast announced that 138,500 active &quot;Magic&quot; players were registered in the new organized play program since launching the WPN.

Also in 2009, stores at the WPN Core level or higher were allowed to release &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (D&amp;D) products before the official publication date. In 2010, Wizards of the Coast restricted organized play not associated with a participating store; many sanctioned &quot;Magic&quot; and &quot;D&amp;D&quot; events were now required to be hosted at a participating store or sponsored by a participating store. Wizards of the Coast began to advertise the D&amp;D Encounters program, a &quot;D&amp;D&quot; equivalent of Friday Night Magic, under the WPN umbrella in 2010. From 2014 to 2016, the D&amp;D Adventurers League could only be run at participating WPN locations. Scott Thorne, for &quot;ICv2&quot; in 2014, wrote that the WPN organized play is highly structured with stores expected, or at least encouraged, to run OP events, either provided by WotC itself (Friday Night &quot;Magic&quot;, &quot;Magic&quot; Game Days, the late &quot;Kaijudo&quot; Draft program, &quot;D&amp;D&quot; Encounters and so forth and so on), or set up by the store (&quot;Magic&quot;, casual &quot;Magic&quot;, casual &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;). Stores can either schedule events weeks or months in advance, with promotional materials and support often provided (sometimes hundreds of dollars worth of support), or set something up on the fly, as a group of players come in and settles down for an evening of &quot;Magic&quot; or &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. The company has made the DCI Reporter software integral to its OP program and updates the software on a regular basis. The weekly sales tips sent out from Wizards&#x27; Customer Support usually (but not always) focus on how to enhance a store’s OP program as integral to the success of &quot;Magic&quot; and, to a lesser extent, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. 

In March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Wizards of the Coast suspended in-store events in North America, Europe, and Latin America. In response to the in-person suspension, Wizards of the Coast launched the &quot;Friday Night Magic at Home&quot; program utilizing the online game &quot;&quot;. Then in October 2020, Wizards of the Coast announced a new ongoing ticketed series for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; called D&amp;D Virtual Play Weekends which are organized by Baldman Games. This monthly event includes the option of either Adventurers League legal games or non-AL games. In May 2021, the in-store suspension was lifted in the United States, Japan and Africa but not in Latin America or Europe.

In 2024, WPN started a pilot program called &quot;Avalon Hill Game Nights&quot; which focuses on &quot;evergreen titles that WotC is increasing availability for to WPN stores via distribution. These titles include the &quot;HeroQuest&quot; line, &quot;Betrayal at House on the Hill&quot;, &quot;The Yawning Portal&quot;, and &quot;Risk&quot; and &quot;Risk Strike&quot;&quot;. The pilot program is scheduled to begin in July 2024 at &quot;200 WPN stores in the U.S. and Canada&quot;.

== WPN sanctioned events ==

In order to play in sanctioned events, players must register for membership. Previously, players would receive a DCI number. This number is up to 10 digits long, and uniquely identifies a competitor in a sanctioned tournament. In 2017, players were encouraged to create a Wizards Account which would include a player&#x27;s DCI number. Starting in 2020, there was a transition to sanctioned events requiring a player to have a Wizards Account instead of a DCI number.

The WPN previously maintained a global player ratings database (formerly based on a variation of the Elo rating system; then based on &quot;Planeswalker Points&quot;, earned for participating in events as well as for each win) and members had access to their entire tournament history online. However, in 2020, both the database and &quot;Planeswalker Points&quot; were retired. &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that &quot;your DCI number and the website that lets you track your tournament process back decades will be taken offline [...]. Players have been responding on reddit and Twitter to the removal of the archival with either disdain or acceptance&quot;. &quot;Epicstream&quot; commented that the &quot;move to remove the old Planeswalker Points system is understandable. The Wizards Account and Companion app will simplify everything, and due to privacy laws, local game stores can no longer store local databases so each player will need to type the event into the app or give the organizer their Wizards Account email address&quot;.

If a member commits frequent or flagrant rules infractions, their membership can be suspended for variable amounts of time depending on the severity, from one month to lifetime.

=== Participating stores ===
The WPN outlines various rules participating stores must follow along with various metrics they must meet in order to stay in the WPN network. , Wizards of the Coast has required participating stores to pay for background checks (where legal) on employees or others involved in the administering of WPN events. Additionally, Wizards of the Coast made an explicit &quot;requirement that WPN stores not employ staff or engage others whose names appear on a sex offender registry &#x27;and/or have been convicted... for a violent sexual offense or a crime against children&#x27;.&quot; Milton Griepp, for the industry trade &quot;ICv2&quot;, commented that this change occurred after recent social media coverage on a &quot;Magic&quot; judge who &quot;was discovered to be listed on a sex offenders registry. To make things worse, the situation had been reported to an email address maintained by Magic Judges, &#x27;an independent community-run organization that operates and manages the judge community and the Judge Conduct Committee,&#x27; way back in July 2017&quot;.

Stores were previously divided into levels (Core, Advanced and Advanced Plus) and received different benefits based on their store level. , stores are divided into WPN Stores and WPN Premium Stores (&quot;about 5% of all WPN stores&quot;). Metrics are measured by what WPN calls Tickets and Engaged Players. Tickets are &quot;the total number of entries across all of a store’s &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot; events&quot; and Engaged Players are &quot;players who join six events, in either Standard, Draft, or Sealed, per year&quot;. To stay in the WPN Network, stores must reach a minimum of 5 Engaged players and 250 Tickets per year. Stores will also receive player incentives, such as promo packs, based on their exact metrics. 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these metrics were suspended. However, Wizards of the Coast began encouraging WPN stores to run events again by resuming metric counts in July 2021. Jeffrey Dohm-Sanchez, for &quot;ICv2&quot;, highlighted that this metric rollout was limited to the US region with other regions to follow in the future. He wrote that &quot;retailers will have an entire year to build up their metrics for allocations as a grace period, and during this time, allocations will either be based on the Q1 2020 or live metrics. After the grace period ends, the live metrics will determine allocations. It is also to be noted that all formats will now count towards the Engaged Players portion of the metrics. Prior to the pandemic, only Standard, Booster Draft and Sealed events counted towards this metric. Now, any form of &quot;Magic&quot; played in a retailer&#x27;s community can contribute to the number of Engaged Players&quot;. Also in 2021, Wizards of the Coast required participating stores to transition from the Wizards Event Reporter (WER) to the Wizards EventLink system in order to stay in the WPN network as the WER was being decommissioned.

== Tournaments ==
=== Ranking ===
Until September 2011, the WPN maintained rules and assigned players ratings for three basic categories in &quot;Magic&quot;: Constructed, Eternal, and Limited. These categories recorded a player&#x27;s ranking based on their records of wins and losses. A fourth rating category, Composite, was the average of a player&#x27;s Constructed and Limited ratings. Starting in 2010, the WPN introduced a new rating category, called &quot;Total&quot; rating. This rating replaced most of the existing individual ratings. While the other ratings were still published, &quot;Total&quot; replaced the other categories for rating-based invitations and byes.

The rating system was discontinued in 2011 in favor of a points-based system, known as Planeswalker Points, administered by Wizards of the Coast. This system awarded points for participating in a tournament, as well as additional points for each win during the event. This system replaced the rating system for invitations and byes. In 2020, Planeswalker Points were retired.

=== Judge Program ===

The WPN was also the home of the Judge Program. Early in Magic&#x27;s competitive history, the event&#x27;s organizers needed a system for training and certifying qualified tournament officials. To have a measure of capability of the judges the WPN introduced judge levels. Over time the Judge Program grew and transformed, and is now an independent organization.

=== Friday Night Magic ===
&quot;Thousands of games shops&quot; participate in Friday Night Magic (FNM), an event sponsored by the WPN; it is advertised as &quot;the event where new players can approach the game, and start building their community&quot;. FNM offers both sanctioned tournament formats and all formats. In 2018, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; reported that &quot;even as it has grown in popularity and size, Magic flies low to the ground. It thrives on the people who gather at lunch tables, in apartments, or in one of the six thousand stores worldwide that Wizards has licensed to put on weekly tournaments dubbed Friday Night Magic&quot;. FNM tournaments can act as a stepping-stone to more competitive play.

=== Major tournaments ===
=== Other tournaments ===
Pre-release tournaments are held in hundreds of locations around the world several days before each new expansion, or set, is available for sale in stores. The pre-release provides a casual play atmosphere and a preview of new cards and sets. Before 2008, pre-release tournaments were limited to those with Premier Tournament Organizer status; it was then opened up to WPN stores.

Friday Night Magic (FNM) tournaments and &quot;Arena Leagues&quot; (currently defunct) are offered in many stores and clubs, allowing players to compete for special foil promo cards and other prizes (rarely involving a cash top prize). These tournaments are mostly for amateurs and first-time players seeking a start in professional play. The WPN will also run other regional tournaments such as the 2021 Store Challenger Series for participating WPN stores in the APAC region.

Many other stores, school clubs, and community groups hold WPN-sanctioned events on a regular basis. Events are also held at almost all gaming conventions, such as Origins and Gen Con. In addition, some companies hold tournament series for Magic: The Gathering at locations across the US outside of WPN regulation.

== Hecatomb ==
Hecatomb was supported by the DCI over its short lifetime. In August 2006, it was announced that the game would no longer be produced by Wizards of the Coast, and the DCI ceased to support it.

<doc id="507190" wikidata="Q2846150" url="?curid=507190" title="Steel and tin cans">
<text>A steel can, tin can, tin (especially in British English, Australian English, Canadian English and South African English), or can is a container made of thin metal, for distribution or storage of goods. Some cans are opened by removing the top panel with a can opener or other tool; others have covers removable by hand without a tool. Cans can store a broad variety of contents: food, beverages, oil, chemicals, etc. In a broad sense, any metal container is sometimes called a &quot;tin can&quot;, even if it is made, for example, of aluminium.

Steel cans were traditionally made of tinplate; the tin coating stopped the contents from rusting the steel. Tinned steel is still used, especially for fruit juices and pale canned fruit. Modern cans are often made from steel lined with transparent films made from assorted plastics, instead of tin. Early cans were often soldered with neurotoxic high-lead solders. High-lead solders were banned in the 1990s in the United States, but smaller amounts of lead were still often present in both the solder used to seal cans and in the mostly-tin linings.
Cans are highly recyclable and around 65% of steel cans are recycled.

==History==

The tin canning process was conceived by the Frenchman Philippe de Girard, who had British merchant Peter Durand patent the idea in 1810. The canning concept was based on experimental food preservation work in glass containers the year before by the French inventor Nicholas Appert. Durand did not pursue food canning, but, in 1812, sold his patent to two Englishmen, Bryan Donkin and John Hall, who refined the process and product, and set up the world&#x27;s first commercial canning factory on Southwark Park Road, London. By 1813 they were producing their first tin canned goods for the Royal Navy. By 1820, tin canisters or cans were being used for gunpowder, seeds, and turpentine.

Early tin cans were sealed by soldering with a tin–lead alloy, which could lead to lead poisoning. Automated soldering machines started to arrive in the 1870s and steel started to displace iron as a material for the cans at the very end of the 19th century. Locking side seam was invented by Max Ams in 1888, giving the rise to a &quot;sanitary can&quot; design, where the solder was found only on the outside of the can and never touched the food. The modern three-piece design dates back to 1904 (Sanitary Can Company of New York).

In 1901 in the United States, the American Can Company was founded, at the time producing 90% of the tin cans in the United States. It bought out the Sanitary Can Company of New York in 1908, and the three-piece design displaced all other cans by the early 1920s. The can saw very little change since then, although better technology brought 20% reduction in the use of steel, and 50% - in the use of tin (the modern cans are 99.5% steel).
Canned food in tin cans was already quite popular in various countries when technological advancements in the 1920s lowered the cost of the cans even further. In 1935, the first beer in metal cans was sold; it was an instant sales success. The production of these three-piece cans by the American Can Company stopped for World War II due to lack of material, after the war the first two-piece cans with no side seams and a cone top were introduced. The use of aluminum started in 1958 with Primo beer.

About 600 different types of cans were used in the early 21st century, with the most popular being the three-piece design with side seam and two doble-seamed ends, followed by the two-piece construction with sides and bottom drawn as one piece.

==Description==
Most cans are right circular cylinders with identical and parallel round tops and bottoms with vertical sides. However, in cans for small volumes or particularly-shaped contents, the top and bottom may be rounded-corner rectangles or ovals. Other contents may suit a can that is somewhat conical in shape.

Fabrication of most cans results in at least one &quot;rim&quot;—a narrow ring slightly larger than the outside diameter of the rest of the can. The flat surfaces of rimmed cans are recessed from the edge of any rim (toward the middle of the can) by about the width of the rim; the inside diameter of a rim, adjacent to this recessed surface, is slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the rest of the can.

Three-piece can construction results in top and bottom rims. In two-piece construction, one piece is a flat top and the other a deep-drawn cup-shaped piece that combines the (at least roughly) cylindrical wall and the round base. Transition between wall and base is usually gradual. Such cans have a single rim at the top. Some cans have a separate cover that slides onto the top or is hinged.

Two piece steel cans can be made by &quot;drawing&quot; to form the bottom and sides and adding an &quot;end&quot; at the top: these do not have side seams. Cans can be fabricated with separate slip-on, or friction fit covers and with covers attached by hinges. Various easy opening methods are available.

In the mid-20th century, a few milk products were packaged in nearly rimless cans, reflecting different construction; in this case, one flat surface had a hole (for filling the nearly complete can) that was sealed after filling with a quickly solidifying drop of molten solder. Concern arose that the milk contained unsafe levels of lead leached from this solder plug.

==Advantages of steel cans==
A number of factors make steel cans ideal containers for beverages. Steel cans are stronger than cartons or plastic, and less fragile than glass, protecting the product in transit and preventing leakage or spillage, while also reducing the need for secondary packaging.

Steel and aluminium packaging offer complete protection against light, water and air, and metal cans without resealable closures are among the most tamper-evident of all packaging materials. Food and drink packed in steel cans has equivalent vitamin content to freshly prepared, without needing preserving agents. Steel cans also extend the product&#x27;s shelf-life, allowing longer sell-by and use-by dates and reducing waste.

As an ambient packaging medium, steel cans do not require cooling in the supply chain, simplifying logistics and storage, and saving energy and cost. At the same time, steel&#x27;s relatively high thermal conductivity means canned drinks chill much more rapidly and easily than those in glass or plastic bottles.

==Materials and health issues==

===Tin===
No cans currently in wide use are composed primarily or wholly of tin. Until the second half of the 20th century, almost all cans were made of tinplate steel. The steel was cheap and structurally strong, but prone to rust; the tin coating prevented the wet food from corroding the steel. Corrosion-resistant coatings on almost all steel food cans are now made from plastic, not tin. Some manufacturers use Vitreous enamel, instead.

====Dissolution of tin into the food====
Tin is corrosion resistant, but acidic food like fruits and vegetables can corrode the tin layer. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been reported after ingesting canned food containing 200 mg/kg of tin. A 2002 study showed that 99.5% of 1200 tested cans contained below the UK regulatory limit of 200 mg/kg of tin, an improvement over most previous studies largely attributed to the increased use of fully lacquered cans for acidic foods, and concluded that the results do not raise any long term food safety concerns for consumers. The two non-compliant products were voluntarily recalled.

Evidence of tin impurities can be indicated by color, as in the case of pears, but lack of color change does not guarantee that a food is not tainted with tin.

===Lead===
Lead is harmful to health in any quantity, and more lead is more harmful than less lead. Infants and children are more severely affected, as lead harms brain development.

In November 1991, US can manufacturers voluntarily eliminated lead seams in food cans. Imported food cans continued to include lead soldered seams.

In 1995, the US FDA issued a rule prohibiting lead soldered food cans, including both domestic and imported food cans. Unfortunately, the FDA did not give a definition of &quot;lead solder&quot;, or a quantitative limit to permissible lead levels, and some solders and tin linings used on tin cans still contained significant amounts of lead. In 2017, quantitative limits were set, but they are high enough to permit intentionally adding lead, and the FDA measurements show measurable levels of lead in many US canned foods in the 2010s.

===Plastic linings===
Many metal food cans are lined with plastic, to prevent the food from corroding the can. These linings can leach contaminants into the canned food. Some of these contaminants are substances with known health harms, though whether they are ingested in canned food in levels sufficient to cause harms is not known.

Among other substances, the plastic linings in food cans often contain bisphenol A (BPA). Pregnant women who eat more canned food have higher levels of BPA in their urine.

Other constituents in can linings, including newer BPA-free can linings, have also been identified as having known health harms.

====Bisphenol-A====
Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a controversial chemical compound present in commercially available tin can plastic linings and transferred to canned food. The inside of the can is coated with an epoxy coating, in an attempt to prevent food or beverage from coming into contact with the metal. The longer food is in a can, and the warmer and more acidic it is, the more BPA leaches into it. In September 2010, Canada became the first country to declare BPA a toxic substance. In the European Union and Canada, BPA use is banned in baby bottles.
The FDA does not regulate BPA (see BPA controversy#Public health regulatory history in the United States). Several companies, like Campbell&#x27;s Soup, announced plans to eliminate BPA from the linings of their cans, but have not said which chemical they plan to replace it with. (See BPA controversy#Chemical manufacturers reactions to bans.)

====Canada====
In 2016, BPA was common in food can linings in Canada. , Health Canada&#x27;s Food Directorate concluded that &quot;the current dietary exposure to BPA through food packaging uses is not expected to pose a health risk to the general population, including newborns and infants&quot;. They also stated that, as some animal studies had shown effects from low levels of BPA, they were seeking to make BPA levels in food packaged for infants and newborns (especially formula). They also cited a WHO review.

====UK====
In modern times, the majority of food cans in the UK have been lined with a plastic coating containing bisphenol A (BPA). The coating prevents acids and other substances from corroding the tin or aluminium of the can, but leaching of BPA into the cans contents was investigated as a potential health hazard. The UK Food Standards agency currently considers can-derived BPA levels to be acceptable, but is investigating its safe-level thresholds; it currently has a temporary threshold for BPA, .

====US====
A 2016 market survey using Fourier-transform infrared spectrums to identify materials, found BPA and other substances known to have health harms were common in food can linings in the US. A similar survey done by food can manufacturers in 2020 found BPA only in some imported cans; it did not discuss potential harms from lining substances other than BPA.

===Labels===
A can traditionally has a printed label glued to the outside of the curved surface, indicating its contents. Some labels contain additional information, such as recipes, on the reverse side. More recently labels are sometimes printed directly onto the metal before or after the metal sheet is formed into the individual cans.

Traditionally, labels were glued on with casein glue, which dissolved easily in hot water. Some other glues may make the label harder to remove for recycling.

==Standard sizes==

Cans come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Walls are often stiffened with rib bulges, especially on larger cans, to help the can resist dents that can cause seams to split.

Can sizes in the United States have an assortment of designations and sizes. For example, size 7/8 contains one serving of half a cup with an estimated weight of 4 ounces; size 1 &quot;picnic&quot; has two or three servings totalling one and a quarter cups with an estimated weight of 10 ounces; size 303 has four servings totalling 2 cups weighing 15 ounces; and size 10 cans, most widely used by food services selling to cafeterias and restaurants, have twenty-five servings totalling 13 cups with an estimated weight of 103 ounces (size of a roughly 3 pound coffee can). These are U.S. customary cups, not British Imperial standard.

In the United States, cook books sometimes reference cans by size. The Can Manufacturers Institute defines these sizes, expressing them in three-digit numbers, as measured in whole and sixteenths of an inch for the container&#x27;s nominal outside dimensions: a 307 × 512 would thus measure 3 and 7/16&quot; in diameter by 5 and 3/4&quot; (12/16&quot;) in height. Older can numbers are often expressed as single digits, their contents being calculated for room-temperature water as approximately eleven ounces (#1 &quot;picnic&quot; can), twenty ounces (#2), thirty-two ounces (#3), fifty-eight ounces (#5), and one-hundred-ten ounces (#10 &quot;coffee&quot; can).

In parts of the world using the metric system, tins are made in 250, 500, 750 ml (millilitre) and 1 L (litre) sizes (250 ml is approximately 1 cup or 8 ounces). Cans imported from the US often have odd sizes such as 3.8 L (1 US gallon), 1.9 L (1/2 US gallon), and 946 ml (2 US pints / 1 quart).

In the UK and Australia, cans are usually measured by net weight. A standard size tin can holds roughly 400 g; though the weight can vary between 385 g and 425 g depending on the density of the contents. The smaller half sized can holds roughly 200 g, typically varying between 170 g and 225 g.

==Fabrication of cans==

Rimmed three-piece can construction involves several stages;
* Forming a tube and welding or soldering the seam of the sides
* Joining the bottom end to the tube
* Printing or attaching labels to the can
* Filling the can with content; sterilization or retorting is required for many food products
* Joining the wall and top &quot;end&quot;.

Double seam rims are crucial to the joining of the wall to a top or bottom surface. An extremely tight fit between the pieces must be accomplished to prevent leakage; the process of accomplishing this radically deforms the rims of the parts. Part of the tube that forms the wall is bent, almost at its end, turning outward through 90 degrees, and then bent further, toward the middle of the tube, until it is parallel to the rest of the tube, a total bend of 180 degrees.

The outer edge of the flat piece is bent against this toward the middle of the tubular wall, until parallel with the wall, turning inward through 90 degrees. The edge of bent portion is bent further through another 90 degrees, inward now toward the axis of the tube and parallel to the main portion of the flat piece, making a total bend of 180 degrees. It is bent far enough inward that its circular edge is now slightly &quot;smaller&quot; in diameter than the edge of the tube. Bending it yet further, until it is parallel with the tube&#x27;s axis, gives it a total bend of 270 degrees. It now envelops the outward rim of the tube.

Looking outward from the axis of the tube, the first surface is the unbent portion of the tube. Slightly further out is a narrow portion of the top, including its edge. The outward-bent portion of the tube, including its edge, is still slightly further out. Furthest out is the 90-degree-bent portion of the flat surface.

The combined interacting forces, as the portion of the flat surface adjacent to the interior of the tube is indented toward the middle of the tube and then outward &quot;forward&quot; the axis of the tube, and the other bent portions of the flat piece and the tube are all forced &quot;toward&quot; the axis of the tube, drives these five thicknesses of metal against each other from inside and out, forming a &quot;dry&quot; joint so tight that welding or solder is not needed to strengthen or seal it. Illustrations of this process can be found on pages 20–22 of the FAO Fisheries Technical Paper 285 &quot;Manual on fish canning&quot;.

==Design and manufacture==

===Steel for can making===
The majority of steel used in packaging is tinplate, which is steel that has been coated with a thin layer of tin, whose functionality is required for the production process. The tin layer is usually applied by electroplating.

===Two-piece steel can design===
Most steel beverage cans are two-piece designs, made from 1) a disc re-formed into a cylinder with an integral end, double-seamed after filling and 2) a loose end to close it. Steel cans are made in many different diameters and volumes, with opening mechanisms that vary from ring pulls and tab openers, to wide open mouths.

===Drawn-and-ironed (DWI) steel cans===
The process of re-forming sheet metal without changing its thickness is known as &#x27;drawing&#x27;. Thinning the walls of a two-piece can by passing it through circular dies is called &#x27;ironing&#x27;. Steel beverage cans are therefore generally referred to as drawn-and-ironed, or DWI, cans (sometimes D&amp;I). The DWI process is used for making cans where the height is greater than the diameter, and is particularly suited to making large volumes of cans of the same basic specification.

Steel can wall thicknesses are now 30% thinner and weigh 40% less than 30 years ago, reducing the amounts of raw materials and energy required to make them. They are also up to 40% thinner than aluminium.

===Magnetic properties===
Steel is a ferrous metal and is therefore magnetic. For beverage packaging this is unique. This allows the use of magnetic conveyor systems to transfer empty cans through the filling and packing processes, increasing accuracy and reducing potential spillage and waste. In recycling facilities, steel cans may be readily separated from other waste using magnetic equipment including cross-belt separators, also known as overband magnets, and drum magnets.

==Opening cans==
The first cans were heavy-weight containers that required ingenuity to open, with instructions directing to use a hammer and chisel, during the war of 1812, British soldiers resorted to use of bayonets and knives. After an introduction of much thinner cans in the 1850s, a specialized opener became possible, and were introduced in 1855 (Robert Yeates) and 1858 (Ezra J. Warner). The latter unwieldy design saw limited use by soldiers in the American Civil War. The push-lever opener similar to the modern ones was introduced in 1860 (&quot;Bull&#x27;s Head&quot;), cutting wheel invented in 1870 (William W. Lyman). Serrated wheel, common in the rotating can openers, was first used by the Star Can Opener Company in 1925. 

While beverage cans or cans of liquid such as broth can be punctured—as with a church key—to pour out the contents, solid or semisolid contents require removing one end of the can. This can be accomplished with a heavy knife or other sharp tool, but can openers are safer, easier, and more convenient.

Some cans, such as those used for sardines, have a specially scored lid so that the user can break out the metal by the leverage of winding it around a slotted twist-key. Until the mid-20th century, some sardine tins had solder-attached lids, and the twist-key worked by forcing the solder joint apart.

The advent of pull tabs in beverage cans spread to the canning of various food products, such as pet food or nuts (and non-food products such as motor oil and tennis balls). The ends are known as &quot;easy open&quot; lids because they open without any tools or implements. An additional innovation developed specifically for food cans uses a tab that is bent slightly upwards, creating a larger surface area for easier finger access.

Cans can be made with easy open features. Some cans have screw caps for pouring liquids and resealing. Some have hinged covers or slip-on covers for easy access. Paint cans usually have a lid with an interference fit, removable and replaceable any number of times so the paint may be stored between uses.
==Recycling and re-use==
Steel from cans and other sources is the most recycled packaging material. Around 65% of steel cans are recycled. In the United States, 63% of steel cans are recycled, compared to 52% of aluminium cans. In Europe, the recycling rate in 2016 is 79.5%.
Most can recycling occurs at the smelters, but individual consumers also directly reuse cans in various ways. For instance some people use two tin cans to form a camp or survival stove to cook small meals.
===Sustainability and recycling of steel beverage cans===

====Steel recycling====

From an ecological perspective, steel may be regarded as a closed-loop material: post-consumer waste can be collected, recycled and used to make new cans or other products. Each tonne of scrap steel recycled saves 1.5 tonnes of CO2, 1.4 tonnes of iron ore and 740 kg of coal. Steel is the world&#x27;s most recycled material, with more than 85% of all the world&#x27;s steel products being recycled at the end of their life: an estimated 630 million tonnes of steel scrap were recycled in 2017, saving 945 million tonnes of CO2.

====Steel can recycling====
A steel can can be recycled again and again without loss of quality; however, for the food grade steel it&#x27;s required to remove tin from the scrap metal, which is done by way of electrochemistry: the tin is leached from a high pH solution at low negative voltage.

Recycling a single can saves the equivalent power for one laundry load, 1 hour of TV or 24 hours of lighting (10W LED bulb).

Steel beverage cans are recycled by being melted down in an electric arc furnace or basic oxygen furnace.

Most steel cans also carry some form of recycling identification such as the Metal Recycles Forever mark, Recyclable Steel, and the Choose Steel campaign logo. There is also a campaign in Europe called Every Can Counts, encouraging can recycling in the workplace.

====Smaller carbon footprint====
All beverage packaging creates CO2 emissions at every stage in the production process, from raw material extraction, processing and manufacture through to recycling. However, steel cans are an ecological top performer, as cans can always be recycled. The steel industry needs the used cans and will use them in the production of new steel product. By recycling the cans and closing the loop, CO2 emissions are dramatically reduced. There is also the potential for higher global steel recycling rates as consumers become more aware of the benefits.

<doc id="507191" wikidata="Q4862821" url="?curid=507191" title="Baron St Helens">
<text>Baron St Helens is a title that has been created three times, once in the Peerage of Ireland and twice in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==History==

The first two creations were both in favour of the same person, but are now extinct. The first creation came in the Peerage of Ireland on 26 January 1791 when the Chief Secretary for Ireland Alleyne Fitzherbert was created Baron St Helens. On 31 July 1801 he was further honoured when he was created Baron St Helens, of St Helens on the Isle of Wight in the County of Southampton, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, allowing him to sit in the House of Lords. On his death in 1839, both baronies became extinct. Lord St Helens was the son of William Fitzherbert, Member of Parliament for Derby, and a younger brother of Sir William Fitzherbert, 1st Baronet.

The third creation came on 31 December 1964 when the Conservative politician Michael Hughes-Young was created Baron St Helens, of St Helens in the County Palatine of Lancaster. He had earlier represented Wandsworth Central in the House of Commons. It was one of the last hereditary baronies ever created in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. the title is held by his son, the second Baron, who succeeded in 1980. Henry George Young, father of the first Baron, was a Brigadier-General in the British Army.

==Barons St Helens, First and second creations (1791/1801 - 1839)==
*Alleyne Fitzherbert, 1st Baron St Helens (1753–1839)

==Barons St Helens, Third creation (1964 - present)==
*Michael Henry Colin Hughes-Young, 1st Baron St Helens (1912–1980)
*Richard Francis Hughes-Young, 2nd Baron St Helens (born 1945)
**The heir apparent, and only heir to the title, is his son, The Hon. Henry Thomas Hughes-Young (born 7 Mar 1986)

<doc id="507197" wikidata="Q368498" url="?curid=507197" title="Psychology of religion">
<text>Psychology of religion consists of the application of psychological methods and interpretive frameworks to the diverse contents of religious traditions as well as to both religious and irreligious individuals. The various methods and frameworks can be summarized according to the classic distinction between the natural-scientific and human-scientific approaches. The first cluster amounts to objective, quantitative, and preferably experimental procedures for testing hypotheses about causal connections among the objects of one&#x27;s study. In contrast, the human-scientific approach accesses the human world of experience using qualitative, phenomenological, and interpretive methods. This approach aims to discern meaningful, rather than causal, connections among the phenomena one seeks to understand.

Psychologists of religion pursue three major projects: 
#systematic description, especially of religious contents, attitudes, experiences, and expressions
#explanation of the origins of religion, both in the history of the human race and in individual lives, taking into account a diversity of influences
#mapping out the consequences of religious attitudes and conduct, both for the individual and for society at large. 
The psychology of religion first arose as a self-conscious discipline in the late 19th century, but all three of these tasks have a history going back many centuries before that.

==Overview==
The challenge for the psychology of religion is essentially threefold:
# to provide a thoroughgoing description of the objects of investigation, whether they be shared religious content (e.g., a tradition&#x27;s ritual observances) or individual experiences, attitudes, or conduct;
#to account in psychological terms for the rise of such phenomena, whether they be in individual lives or not;
#to clarify the outcomesthe fruits, as William James put itof these phenomena, for individuals, and the larger society. These fruits may be both positive and negative.

The first, descriptive task naturally requires a clarification of one&#x27;s termsabove all, the word &quot;religion&quot;. Historians of religion have long underscored the problematic character of this term. They note that its usage over the centuries has changed in significant ways, generally in the direction of reification. The early psychologists of religion were fully aware of these difficulties, typically acknowledging that the definitions they chose were to some degree arbitrary. With the rise of positivistic trends in psychology over the 20th century, especially the demand that all phenomena be operationalized by quantitative procedures, psychologists of religion developed a multitude of scales, most of them developed for use by Protestant Christians. Factor analysis was also brought into play by both psychologists and sociologists of religion, to establish a fixed core of dimensions and a corresponding set of scales. The justification and adequacy of these efforts, especially in the light of constructivist and other postmodern viewpoints, remains a matter of debate.

In the last several decades, especially among clinical psychologists, a preference for the terms &quot;spirituality&quot; and &quot;spiritual&quot; has emerged, along with efforts to distinguish them from &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;religious.&quot; Especially in the United States, &quot;religion&quot; has for many become associated with sectarian institutions and their obligatory creeds and rituals, thus giving the word a negative cast; &quot;spirituality&quot;, in contrast, is positively constructed as deeply individual and subjective, as a universal capacity to apprehend and accord one&#x27;s life with higher realities. In fact, &quot;spirituality&quot; has likewise undergone an evolution in the West, from a time when it was essentially a synonym for religion in its original, subjective meaning. 
Today, efforts are ongoing to &quot;operationalize&quot; these terms, with little regard for their history in their Western context, and with the apparent realist assumption that underlying them are fixed qualities identifiable using empirical procedures.

Schnitker and Emmons theorized that the understanding of religion as a search for meaning makes implications in the three psychological areas of motivation, cognition and social relationships. The cognitive aspects relate to God and a sense of purpose, the motivational ones to the need to control, and the religious search for meaning is also woven into social communities.

==History==
===Edwin Diller Starbuck===
Edwin Diller Starbuck is considered a pioneer of the psychology of religion and his book &quot;Psychology of Religion&quot; (1899) has been described as the first book in the genre. This book was endorsed by William James who collaborated by writing its preface. Starbuck&#x27;s work would influence James on writing his own book, &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot;, with James thanking him in the preface for having &quot;made over to me his large collection of manuscript material&quot;. In the book itself James mentions Starbuck&#x27;s name 46 times and cites him on several different occasions.

=== William James ===
American psychologist and philosopher William James (1842–1910) is regarded by most psychologists of religion as the founder of the field. He served as president of the American Psychological Association, and wrote one of the first psychology textbooks. In the psychology of religion, James&#x27; influence endures. His &quot;Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; is considered to be the classic work in the field, and references to James&#x27; ideas are common at professional conferences.

James distinguished between institutional religion and personal religion. Institutional religion refers to the religious group or organization and plays an important part in a society&#x27;s culture. Personal religion, in which the individual has mystical experience, can be experienced regardless of the culture. James was most interested in understanding personal religious experience.

In studying personal religious experiences, James made a distinction between &quot;healthy-minded&quot; and &quot;sick-souled&quot; religiousness. Individuals predisposed to healthy-mindedness tend to ignore the evil in the world and focus on the positive and the good. James used examples of Walt Whitman and the &quot;mind-cure&quot; religious movement to illustrate healthy-mindedness in &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot;. In contrast, individuals predisposed to having a sick-souled religion are unable to ignore evil and suffering and need a unifying experience, religious or otherwise, to reconcile good and evil. James included quotations from Leo Tolstoy and John Bunyan to illustrate the sick soul.

William James&#x27; hypothesis of pragmatism stems from the efficacy of religion. If an individual believes in and performs religious activities, and those actions happen to work, then that practice appears the proper choice for the individual. However, if the processes of religion have little efficacy, then there is no rationality for continuing the practice.

James also believed that the different religious experiences could bring benefits and positive outcomes to society. In &quot;Varieties of Religious Experience,&quot; he says: &quot;We must judge the tree by its fruit. The best fruits of the religious experience are the best things history has to offer. The highest flights of charity, devotion, trust, patience, and bravery to which the wings of human nature have spread themselves, have all been flown for religious ideals.”

― William James, The Varieties of Religious Experience

=== Other early theorists ===

==== G.W.F. Hegel ====
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) described all systems of religion, philosophy, and social science as expressions of the basic urge of consciousness to learn about itself and its surroundings, and record its findings and hypotheses. Thus, religion is only a form of that search for knowledge, within which humans record various experiences and reflections. Others, compiling and categorizing these writings in various ways, form the consolidated worldview as articulated by that religion, philosophy, social science, etc. His work &quot;The Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; was a study of how various types of writing and thinking draw from and re-combine with the individual and group experiences of various places and times, influencing the current forms of knowledge and worldviews that are operative in a population. This activity is the functioning of an incomplete group mind, where each is accessing the recorded wisdom of others. His works often include detailed descriptions of the psychological motivations involved in thought and behavior, e.g., the struggle of a community or nation to know itself and thus correctly govern itself. In Hegel&#x27;s system, Religion is one of the major repositories of wisdom to be used in these struggles, representing a huge body of recollections from humanity&#x27;s past in various stages of its development.

==== Sigmund Freud ====
Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) gave explanations of the genesis of religion in his various writings. In &quot;Totem and Taboo&quot;, he applied the idea of the Oedipus complex (involving unresolved sexual feelings of, for example, a son toward his mother and hostility toward his father) and postulated its emergence in the primordial stage of human development.

In &quot;Moses and Monotheism&quot;, Freud reconstructed biblical history by his general theory. His ideas were also developed in &quot;The Future of an Illusion&quot;. When Freud spoke of religion as an illusion, he maintained that it &quot;is a fantasy structure from which a man must be set free if he is to grow to maturity.&quot;

Freud views the idea of God as being a version of the father image, and religious belief as at bottom infantile and neurotic. Authoritarian religion, Freud believed, is dysfunctional and alienates man from himself.

==== Carl Jung ====

The Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung (1875–1961) adopted a very different posture, one that was more sympathetic to religion and more concerned with a positive appreciation of religious symbolism. Jung considered the question of the metaphysical existence of God to be unanswerable by the psychologist and adopted a kind of agnosticism.

Jung postulated, in addition to the personal unconscious (roughly adopting Freud&#x27;s concept), the collective unconscious, which is the repository of human experience and which contains &quot;archetypes&quot; (i.e. basic images that are universal in that they recur regardless of culture). The irruption of these images from the unconscious into the realm of consciousness he viewed as the basis of religious experience and often of artistic creativity. Some of Jung&#x27;s writings have been devoted to elucidating some of the archetypal symbols, and include his work in comparative mythology.

==== Alfred Adler ====
Austrian psychiatrist Alfred Adler (1870–1937), who parted ways with Freud, emphasized the role of goals and motivation in his &quot;Individual Psychology&quot;. One of Adler&#x27;s most famous ideas is that we try to compensate for inferiorities that we perceive in ourselves. A lack of power often lies at the root of feelings of inferiority. One way that religion enters into this picture is through our beliefs in God, which are characteristic of our tendency to strive for perfection and superiority. For example, in many religions, God is considered to be perfect and omnipotent, and commands people likewise to be perfect. If we, too, achieve perfection, we become one with God. By identifying with God in this way, we compensate for our imperfections and feelings of inferiority.

Our ideas about God are important indicators of how we view the world. According to Adler, these ideas have changed over time, as our vision of the world – and our place in it – has changed. Consider this example that Adler offers: the traditional belief that people were placed deliberately on earth as God&#x27;s ultimate creation is being replaced with the idea that people have evolved by natural selection. This coincides with a view of God not as a real being, but as an abstract representation of nature&#x27;s forces. In this way, our view of God has changed from one that was concrete and specific to one that is more general. From Adler&#x27;s vantage point, this is a relatively ineffective perception of God because it is so general that it fails to convey a strong sense of direction and purpose.

An important thing for Adler is that God (or the idea of God) motivates people to act and that those actions do have real consequences for ourselves and others. Our view of God is important because it embodies our goals and directs our social interactions.

Compared to science, another social movement, religion is more efficient because it motivates people more effectively. According to Adler, only when science begins to capture the same religious fervor, and promotes the welfare of all segments of society, will the two be more equal in peoples&#x27; eyes.

==== Gordon Allport ====
In his 1950 book &quot;The Individual and His Religion&quot;, Gordon Allport (1897–1967) illustrates how people may use religion in different ways. He makes a distinction between &quot;Mature religion&quot; and
&quot;Immature religion&quot;. Mature religious sentiment is how Allport characterized the person whose approach to religion is dynamic, open-minded, and able to maintain links between inconsistencies. In contrast, immature religion is self-serving and generally represents the negative stereotypes that people have about religion.

More recently, this distinction has been encapsulated in the terms &quot;intrinsic religion&quot;, referring to a genuine, heartfelt devout faith, and &quot;extrinsic religion&quot;, referring to a more utilitarian use of religion as a means to an end, such as church attendance to gain social status. These dimensions of religion were measured on the Religious Orientation Scale of Allport and Ross. The third form of religious orientation has been described by Daniel Batson. This refers to treatment of religion as an open-ended search.

More specifically, it has been seen by Batson as comprising a willingness to view religious doubts positively, acceptance that religious orientation can change and existential complexity, the belief that one&#x27;s religious beliefs should be shaped from personal crises that one has experienced in one&#x27;s life. Batson refers to extrinsic, intrinsic and quests respectively as religion-as-means, religion-as-end, and religion-as-quest, and measures these constructs on the Religious Life Inventory.

==== Erik H. Erikson ====
Erik Erikson (1902–1994) is best known for his theory of psychological development, which has its roots in the psychoanalytic importance of identity in personality. His biographies of Gandhi and Martin Luther reveal Erikson&#x27;s positive view of religion. He considered religions to be important influences in successful personality development because they are the primary way that cultures promote the virtues associated with each stage of life. Religious rituals facilitate this development. Erikson&#x27;s theory has not benefited from systematic empirical study, but it remains an influential and well-regarded theory in the psychological study of religion.

==== Erich Fromm ====
The American scholar Erich Fromm (1900–1980) modified the Freudian theory and produced a more complex account of the functions of religion. In his book &quot;Psychoanalysis and Religion&quot; he responded to Freud&#x27;s theories by explaining that part of the modification is viewing the Oedipus complex as based not so much on sexuality as on a &quot;much more profound desire&quot;, namely, the childish desire to remain attached to protecting figures. The right religion, in Fromm&#x27;s estimation, can, in principle, foster an individual&#x27;s highest potentialities, but religion in practice tends to relapse into being neurotic.

According to Fromm, humans need a stable frame of reference. Religion fills this need. In effect, humans crave answers to questions that no other source of knowledge has an answer to, which only religion may seem to answer. However, a sense of free will must be given for religion to appear healthy. An authoritarian notion of religion appears detrimental.

==== Rudolf Otto ====
Rudolf Otto (1869–1937) was a German Protestant theologian and scholar of comparative religion. Otto&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;The Idea of the Holy&quot; (published first in 1917 as ), defines the concept of the holy as that which is &quot;numinous&quot;. Otto explained the numinous as a &quot;non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self.&quot; It is a mystery () that is both fascinating (&quot;fascinans&quot;) and terrifying at the same time; A mystery that causes trembling and fascination, attempting to explain that inexpressible and perhaps supernatural emotional reaction of wonder drawing us to seemingly ordinary and/or religious experiences of grace. This sense of emotional wonder appears evident at the root of all religious experiences. Through this emotional wonder, we suspend our rational mind for non-rational possibilities.

&quot;The Idea of the Holy&quot; also set out a paradigm for the study of religion that focuses on the need to realize the religious as a non-reducible, original category in its own right. This paradigm was under much attack between approximately 1950 and 1990 but has made a strong comeback since then.

=== Modern thinkers ===
Autobiographal accounts of 20th-century psychology of religion as a field have been supplied by numerous modern psychologists of religion, primarily based in Europe, but also by several US-based psychologists such as Ralph W. Hood and Donald Capps.

==== Allen Bergin ====
Allen Bergin is noted for his 1980 paper &quot;Psychotherapy and Religious Values&quot;, which is known as a landmark in scholarly acceptance that religious values do, in practice, influence psychotherapy. He received the Distinguished Professional Contributions to Knowledge award from the American Psychological Association in 1989 and was cited as challenging &quot;psychological orthodoxy to emphasize the importance of values and religion in therapy.&quot;

====Robert A. Emmons====
Robert A. Emmons offered a theory of &quot;spiritual strivings&quot; in his 1999 book, &quot;The Psychology of Ultimate Concerns&quot;. With support from empirical studies, Emmons argued that spiritual strivings foster personality integration because they exist at a higher level of the personality.

====Ralph W. Hood Jr.====

Ralph W. Hood Jr. is a professor of psychology at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. He is a former editor of the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion and a former co-editor of the Archive for the Psychology of Religion and The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion. He is Past President of Division 36 of the American Psychological Association and a recipient of its William James Award. He has published several hundred articles and book chapters on the psychology of religion and has authored, co-authored, or edited thirteen volumes, all dealing with the psychology of religion.

==== Kenneth Pargament ====
Kenneth Pargament is noted for his book &quot;Psychology of Religion and Coping&quot; (1997), as well as for a 2007 book on religion and psychotherapy, and a sustained research program on religious coping. He is professor of psychology at Bowling Green State University (Ohio, US), and
has published more than 100 papers on the subject of religion and spirituality in psychology. Pargament led the design of a questionnaire called the &quot;RCOPE&quot; to measure Religious Coping strategies. Pargament has distinguished between three types of styles for coping with stress:
# Collaborative, in which people co-operate with God to deal with stressful events;
# Deferring, in which people leave everything to God; and
# Self-directed, in which people do not rely on God and try exclusively to solve problems by their own efforts. He also describes four major stances toward religion that have been adopted by psychotherapists in their work with clients, which he calls the religiously &quot;rejectionist&quot;, &quot;exclusivist&quot;, &quot;constructivist&quot;, and &quot;pluralist&quot; stances.

==== James Hillman ====
James Hillman, at the end of his book &quot;Re-Visioning Psychology&quot;, reverses James&#x27; position of viewing religion through psychology, urging instead that we view psychology as a variety of religious experience. He concludes: &quot;Psychology as religion implies imagining all psychological events as effects of Gods in the soul.&quot;

==== Julian Jaynes ====

Julian Jaynes, primarily in his book &quot;The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind&quot;, proposed that religion (and some other psychological phenomena such as hypnosis and schizophrenia) is a remnant of a relatively recent time in human development, prior to the advent of consciousness. Jaynes hypothesized that hallucinated verbal commands helped non-conscious early man to perform tasks promoting human survival. Starting about 10,000 BCE, selective pressures favored the hallucinated verbal commands for social control, and they came to be perceived as an external, rather than internal, voice commanding the person to take some action. These were hence often explained as originating from invisible gods, spirits, and ancestors.

== Hypotheses on the role of religion ==
There are three primary hypotheses on the role of religion in the modern world.

=== Secularization ===
The first hypothesis, secularization, holds that science and technology will take the place of religion. Secularization supports the separation of religion from politics, ethics, and psychology. Taking this position even further, Taylor explains that secularization denies transcendence, divinity, and rationality in religious beliefs.

=== Religious transformation ===
Challenges to the secularization hypothesis led to significant revisions, resulting in the religious transformation hypothesis. This perspective holds that general trends towards individualism and social disintegration will produce changes in religion, making religious practice more individualized and spiritually focused. This in turn is expected to produce more spiritual seeking, although not exclusive to religious institutions. Eclecticism, which draws from multiple religious/spiritual systems and New Age movements are also predicted to result.

=== Cultural divide ===
In response to the religious transformation hypothesis, Ronald Inglehart piloted the renewal of the secularization hypothesis. His argument hinges on the premise that religion develops to fill the human need for security. Therefore, the development of social and economic security in Europe explains its corresponding secularization due to a lack of need for religion. However, religion continues in the third world where social and economic insecurity is rampant. The overall effect is expected to be a growing cultural disparity.

The idea that religiosity arises from the human need for security has also been furthered by studies examining religious beliefs as a compensatory mechanism of control. These studies are motivated by the idea that people are invested in maintaining beliefs in order and structure to prevent beliefs in chaos and randomness.

In the experimental setting, researchers have also tested compensatory control in regard to individuals&#x27; perceptions of external systems, such as religion or government. For example, Kay and colleagues found that in a laboratory setting, individuals are more likely to endorse broad external systems (e.g., religion or sociopolitical systems) that impose order and control on their lives when they are induced with lowered levels of personal control. In this study, researchers suggest that when a person&#x27;s personal control is lessened, their motivation to believe in order is threatened, resulting in compensation of this threat through adherence to other external sources of control.

== Psychometric approaches to religion ==
Since the 1960s psychologists of religion have used the methodology of psychometrics to assess ways in which a person may be religious. An example is the Religious Orientation Scale of Allport and Ross, which measures how respondents stand on intrinsic and extrinsic religion as described by Allport.
More recent questionnaires include the Age-Universal I-E Scale of Gorsuch and Venable, the Religious Life Inventory of Batson, Schoenrade and Ventis, and the Spiritual Experiences Index-Revised of Genia. The first provides an age-independent measure of Allport and Ross&#x27;s two religious orientations. The second measures three forms of religious orientation: religion as means (intrinsic), religion as end (extrinsic), and religion as quest. The third assesses spiritual maturity using two factors: Spiritual Support and Spiritual Openness.

===Religious orientations and religious dimensions===

Some questionnaires, such as the Religious Orientation Scale, relate to different religious orientations, such as intrinsic and extrinsic religiousness, referring to different motivations for religious allegiance. A rather different approach, taken, for example, by Glock and Stark (1965), has been to list different dimensions of religion rather than different religious orientations, which relates to how an individual may manifest different forms of being religious. Glock and Stark&#x27;s typology described five dimensions of religion – the doctrinal, the intellectual, the ethical-consequential, the ritual, and the experiential. In later works, these authors subdivided the ritual dimension into devotional and public ritual, and also clarified that their distinction of religion along multiple dimensions was not identical to distinguishing religious orientations. Although some psychologists of religion have found it helpful to take a multidimensional approach to religion for the purpose of psychometric scale design, there has been, as Wulff explains, considerable controversy about whether religion should really be seen as multidimensional.

===Questionnaires to assess religious experience===
What we call religious experiences can differ greatly. Some reports exist of supernatural happenings that it would be difficult to explain from a rational, scientific point of view. On the other hand, there also exist the sort of testimonies that simply seem to convey a feeling of peace or oneness – something which most of us, religious or not, may possibly relate to. In categorizing religious experiences it is perhaps helpful to look at them as explicable through one of two theories: the objectivist thesis or the subjectivist thesis.

An objectivist would argue that the religious experience is a proof of God&#x27;s existence. However, others have criticised the reliability of religious experiences. The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes asked how it was possible to tell the difference between talking to God in a dream, and dreaming about talking to God.

The Subjectivist view argues that it is not necessary to think of religious experiences as evidence for the existence of an actual being whom we call God. From this point of view, the important thing is the experience itself and the effect that it has on the individual.

== Developmental approaches to religion ==

Many have looked at stage models, like those of Jean Piaget and Lawrence Kohlberg, to explain how children develop ideas about God and religion in general.

===James Fowler&#x27;s model===
The best-known stage model of spiritual or religious development is that of James W. Fowler, a developmental psychologist at the Candler School of Theology, in his &quot;Stages of Faith&quot;. He follows Piaget and Kohlberg and has proposed a holistic staged development of faith (or spiritual development) across the lifespan. These stages of faith development were along the lines of Piaget&#x27;s theory of cognitive development and Kohlberg&#x27;s stages of moral development.

The book-length study contains six stages of faith development proposed by James Fowler:

* Stage 0 – &quot;Primal or Undifferentiated&quot; faith (birth to two years), is characterized by an early learning of the safety of their environment (i.e. warm, safe and secure vs. hurt, neglect and abuse). If consistent nurture is experienced, one will develop a sense of trust and safety about the universe and the divine. Conversely, negative experiences will cause one to develop distrust about the universe and the divine. Transition to the next stage begins with integration of thought and language which facilitates the use of symbols in speech and play.
* Stage 1 – &quot;Intuitive-Projective&quot; faith (ages of three to seven), is characterized by the psyche&#x27;s unprotected exposure to the Unconscious, and marked by a relative fluidity of thought patterns. Religion is learned mainly through experiences, stories, images, and the people that one comes in contact with.
* Stage 2 – &quot;Mythic-Literal&quot; faith (mostly in school children), is characterized by a strong belief in the justice and reciprocity of the universe, and their deities are almost always anthropomorphic. During this time metaphors and symbolic language are often misunderstood and are taken literally.
* Stage 3 – &quot;Synthetic-Conventional&quot; faith (arising in adolescence; aged 12 to adulthood), is characterized by conformity to authority and the religious development of a personal identity. Any conflicts with one&#x27;s beliefs are ignored at this stage due to the fear of threat from inconsistencies.
* Stage 4 – &quot;Individuative-Reflective&quot; faith (usually mid-twenties to late thirties), is a stage of angst and struggle. The individual takes personal responsibility for his or her beliefs and feelings. As one is able to reflect on one&#x27;s own beliefs, there is an openness to a new complexity of faith, but this also increases the awareness of conflicts in one&#x27;s belief.
* Stage 5 – &quot;Conjunctive&quot; faith (mid-life crisis), acknowledges paradox and transcendence relating reality behind the symbols of inherited systems. The individual resolves conflicts from previous stages by a complex understanding of a multidimensional, interdependent &quot;truth&quot; that cannot be explained by any particular statement.
* Stage 6 – &quot;Universalizing&quot; faith: The individual would treat any person with compassion as he or she views people as from a universal community, and should be treated with universal principles of love and justice.

Fowler&#x27;s model has inspired a considerable body of empirical research into faith development, although little of such research was ever conducted by Fowler himself. Gary Leak&#x27;s Faith Development Scale (FDS) has been subject to factor analysis by Leak.

===Other hypotheses===
Other theorists in developmental psychology have suggested that religiosity comes naturally to young children. Specifically, children may have a natural-born conception of mind-body dualism, which lends itself to beliefs that the mind may live on after the body dies. In addition, children have a tendency to see agency and human design where there is not, and prefer a creationist explanation of the world even when raised by parents who do not.

Researchers have also investigated attachment system dynamics as a predictor of the religious conversion experience throughout childhood and adolescence. One hypothesis is the correspondence hypothesis, which posits that individuals with secure parental attachment are more likely to experience a gradual conversion experience. Under the correspondence hypothesis, internal working models of a person&#x27;s attachment figure is thought to perpetuate his or her perception of God as a secure base. Another hypothesis relating attachment style to the conversion experience is the compensation hypothesis, which states that individuals with insecure attachments are more likely to have a sudden conversion experience as they compensate for their insecure attachment relationship by seeking a relationship with God. 
Researchers have tested these hypotheses using longitudinal studies and individuals&#x27; self narratives of their conversion experience. For example, one study investigating attachment styles and adolescent conversions at Young Life religious summer camps resulted in evidence supporting the correspondence hypothesis through analysis of personal narratives and a prospective longitudinal follow-up of Young Life campers, with mixed results for the compensation hypothesis.

James Alcock summarizes a number of components of what he calls the &quot;God engine&quot;, a &quot;number of automatic processes and cognitive biases [that] combine to make supernatural belief the automatic default.&quot; These include magical thinking, agency detection, theory of mind that leads to dualism, the notion that &quot;objects and events [serve] an intentional purpose&quot;, etc.

== Evolutionary and cognitive psychology of religion ==
Evolutionary psychology is based on the hypothesis that, just as the cardiac, pulmonary, urinary, and immune systems, cognition has a functional structure with a genetic basis, and therefore appeared through natural selection. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared among humans and should solve important problems of survival and reproduction. Evolutionary psychologists seek to understand cognitive processes by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might serve, and with this lens, apply the same concept to religion.

Pascal Boyer is one of the leading figures in the cognitive psychology of religion, a new field of inquiry that is less than fifteen years old, which accounts for the psychological processes that underlie religious thought and practice. In his book &quot;Religion Explained&quot;, Boyer shows that there is no simple explanation for religious consciousness. Boyer is mainly concerned with explaining the various psychological processes involved in the acquisition and transmission of ideas concerning the gods. Boyer builds on the ideas of cognitive anthropologists Dan Sperber and Scott Atran, who first argued that religious cognition represents a by-product of various evolutionary adaptations, including folk psychology, and purposeful violations of innate expectations about how the world is constructed (for example, bodiless beings with thoughts and emotions) that make religious cognitions striking and memorable.

Religious persons acquire religious ideas and practices through social exposure. The child of a Zen Buddhist will not become an evangelical Christian or a Zulu warrior without the relevant cultural experience. While mere exposure does not cause a particular religious outlook (a person may have been raised a Roman Catholic but leave the church), nevertheless some exposure seems required – this person will never invent Roman Catholicism out of thin air. Boyer says cognitive science can help us to understand the psychological mechanisms that account for these manifest correlations and in so doing enable us to better understand the nature of religious belief and practice.

Boyer moves outside the leading currents in mainstream cognitive psychology and suggests that we can use evolutionary biology to unravel the relevant mental architecture. Our brains are, after all, biological objects, and the best naturalistic account of their development in nature is Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution. To the extent that mental architecture exhibits intricate processes and structures, it is plausible to think that this is the result of evolutionary processes working over vast periods of time. Like all biological systems, the mind is optimised to promote survival and reproduction in the evolutionary environment. On this view all specialised cognitive functions broadly serve those reproductive ends.

For Steven Pinker the universal propensity toward religious belief is a genuine scientific puzzle. He thinks that adaptationist explanations for religion do not meet the criteria for adaptations. An alternative explanation is that religious psychology is a by-product of many parts of the mind that originally evolved for other purposes.

== Religion and prayer ==
Religious practice often manifests itself in some form of prayer. Recent studies have focused specifically on the effects of prayer on health. Measures of prayer and the above measures of spirituality evaluate different characteristics and should not be considered synonymous.

Prayer is fairly prevalent in the United States. About 55% of Americans report praying daily. However, the practice of prayer is more prevalent and practiced more consistently among Americans who perform other religious practices. There are four primary types of prayer in the West. Poloma and Pendleton, utilized factor analysis to delineate these four types of prayer: meditative (more spiritual, silent thinking), ritualistic (reciting), petitionary (making requests to God), and colloquial (general conversing with God). Further scientific study of prayer using factor analysis has revealed three dimensions of prayer. Ladd and Spilka&#x27;s first factor was awareness of self, inward reaching. Their second and third factors were upward reaching (toward God) and outward reaching (toward others). This study appears to support the contemporary model of prayer as connection (whether to the self, higher being, or others).

Dein and Littlewood (2008) suggest that an individual&#x27;s prayer life can be viewed on a spectrum ranging from immature to mature. A progression on the scale is characterized by a change in the perspective of the purpose of prayer. Rather than using prayer as a means of changing the reality of a situation, a more mature individual will use prayer to request assistance in coping with immutable problems and draw closer to God or others. This change in perspective has been shown to be associated with an individual&#x27;s passage through adolescence.

Prayer appears to have health implications. Empirical studies suggest that mindfully reading and reciting the Psalms (from scripture) can help a person calm down and focus. Prayer is also positively correlated with happiness and religious satisfaction. A study conducted by Francis, Robbins, Lewis, and Barnes investigated the relationship between self-reported prayer frequency and measures of psychoticism and neuroticism according to the abbreviated form of the Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQR-A). The study included a sample size of 2306 students attending Protestant and Catholic schools in the highly religious culture of Northern Ireland. The data shows a negative correlation between prayer frequency and psychoticism. The data also shows that, in Catholic students, frequent prayer has a positive correlation to neuroticism scores. Ladd and McIntosh suggest that prayer-related behaviors, such as bowing the head and clasping the hands together in an almost fetal position, are suggestive of &quot;social touch&quot; actions. Prayer in this manner may prepare an individual to carry out positive pro-social behavior after praying, due to factors such as increased blood flow to the head and nasal breathing. Overall, slight health benefits have been found fairly consistently across studies.

Three main pathways to explain this trend have been offered: placebo effect, focus and attitude adjustment, and activation of healing processes. These offerings have been expanded by Breslin and Lewis (2008) who have constructed a five pathway model between prayer and health with the following mediators: physiological, psychological, placebo, social support, and spiritual. The spiritual mediator is a departure from the rest in that its potential for empirical investigation is not currently feasible. Although the conceptualizations of chi, the universal mind, divine intervention, and the like breach the boundaries of scientific observation, they are included in this model as possible links between prayer and health so as to not unnecessarily exclude the supernatural from the broader conversation of psychology and religion.

== Religion and ritual ==
Another significant form of religious practice is ritual. Religious rituals encompass a wide array of practices, but can be defined as the performance of similar actions and vocal expressions based on prescribed tradition and cultural norms.

Scheff suggests that ritual provides catharsis, emotional purging, through distancing. This emotional distancing enables an individual to experience feelings with an amount of separation, and thus with less intensity. However, the conception of religious ritual as an interactive process has since matured and become more scientifically established. From this view, ritual offers a means to catharsis through behaviors that foster connection with others, allowing for emotional expression. This focus on connection contrasts to the separation that seems to underlie Scheff&#x27;s view.

Additional research suggests a social component of ritual. For instance, findings suggest that ritual performance indicates group commitment and prevents the uncommitted from gaining membership benefits. Ritual may aid in emphasizing moral values that serve as group norms and regulate societies. It may also strengthen commitment to moral convictions and the likelihood of upholding these social expectations. Thus, performance of rituals may foster social-group stability.

Robert Sapolsky sees a similarity between the rituals accompanying obsessive–compulsive disorder and religious rituals. According to him, religious ritual reduces the tension and anxiety associated with the disorder and provides relief resulting from practicing in a social community.

==Religion and personal functioning==

===Religion and health===

There is considerable literature on the relationship between religion and health. More than 3000 empirical studies have examined relationships between religion and health, including more than 1200 in the 20th century, and more than 2000 additional studies between 2000 and 2009.

Psychologists consider that religion may benefit both physical and mental health in various ways, including encouraging healthy lifestyles, providing social support networks and encouraging an optimistic outlook on life; prayer and meditation may also benefit physiological functioning. Nevertheless, religion is not a unique source of health and well-being, and there are benefits to nonreligiosity as well. Haber, Jacob and Spangler have considered how different dimensions of religiosity may relate to health benefits in different ways.

===Religion and personality===

Some studies have examined whether there is a &quot;religious personality.&quot; Research on the five factor model of personality suggests that people who identify as religious are more likely to be agreeable and conscientious. Similarly, people who identify as spiritual are more likely to be extrovert and open, although this varies based on the type of spirituality endorsed. For example, people endorsing fundamentalist religious beliefs are more likely to measure low on the Openness factor.

===Religion and prejudice===
To investigate the salience of religious beliefs in establishing group identity, researchers have also conducted studies looking at religion and prejudice. Some studies have shown that greater religious attitudes may be significant predictors of negative attitudes towards racial or social outgroups. These effects are often conceptualized under the framework of intergroup bias, where religious individuals favor members of their ingroup (ingroup favoritism) and exhibit disfavor towards members of their outgroup (outgroup derogation). Evidence supporting religious intergroup bias has been supported in multiple religious groups, including non-Christian groups (after all, religion is not only related to Christianity, but others like Islamism, Buddhism, Paganism, and more), and is thought to reflect the role of group dynamics in religious identification. Many studies regarding religion and prejudice implement religious priming both in the laboratory and in naturalistic settings with evidence supporting the perpetuation of ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation in individuals who are high in religiosity.

Recently, reparative or conversion therapy, a religiously motivated process intended to change an individual&#x27;s sexuality, has been the subject of scrutiny and has been condemned by some governments, LGBT charities, and therapy/counselling professional bodies.

== Religion and drugs ==

The American psychologist James H. Leuba (1868–1946), in &quot;A Psychological Study of Religion&quot;, accounts for mystical experience psychologically and physiologically, pointing to analogies with certain drug-induced experiences. Leuba argued forcibly for a naturalistic treatment of religion, which he considered to be necessary if religious psychology were to be looked at scientifically. Shamans all over the world and in different cultures have traditionally used drugs, especially psychedelics, for their religious experiences. In these communities the absorption of drugs leads to dreams (visions) through sensory distortion. The psychedelic experience is often compared to non-ordinary forms of consciousness such as those experienced in meditation, and mystical experiences. Ego dissolution is often described as a key feature of the psychedelic experience.

William James was also interested in mystical experiences from a drug-induced perspective, leading him to make some experiments with nitrous oxide and even peyote. He concludes that while the revelations of the mystic hold true, they hold true only for the mystic; for others they are certainly ideas to be considered, but hold no claim to truth without personal experience of such.

== Religion and mental illness ==
Although many researchers have brought evidence for a positive role that religion plays in health, others have shown that religious beliefs, practices, and experiences may be linked to mental illnesses of various kinds (mood disorders, personality disorders, and psychiatric disorders). In 2012 a team of psychiatrists, behavioral psychologists, neurologists, and neuropsychiatrists from the Harvard Medical School published research which suggested the development of a new diagnostic category of psychiatric disorders related to religious delusion and hyperreligiosity.

They compared the thoughts and behaviors of the most important figures in the Bible (Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ, and Paul) with patients affected by mental disorders related to the psychotic spectrum using different clusters of disorders and diagnostic criteria (DSM-IV-TR), and concluded that these Biblical figures &quot;may have had psychotic symptoms that contributed inspiration for their revelations&quot;, such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, manic depression, delusional disorder, delusions of grandeur, auditory-visual hallucinations, paranoia, Geschwind syndrome (Paul especially), and abnormal experiences associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The authors suggest that Jesus sought to condemn himself to death (&quot;suicide by proxy&quot;).

The research went further and also focused on social models of psychopathology, analyzing new religious movements and charismatic cult leaders such as David Koresh, leader of the Branch Davidians, and Marshall Applewhite, founder of the Heaven&#x27;s Gate cult. The researchers concluded that &quot;If David Koresh and Marshall Applewhite are appreciated as having psychotic-spectrum beliefs, then the premise becomes untenable that the diagnosis of psychosis must rigidly rely upon an inability to maintain a social group. A subset of individuals with psychotic symptoms appears able to form intense social bonds and communities despite having an extremely distorted view of reality. The existence of a better socially functioning subset of individuals with psychotic-type symptoms is corroborated by research indicating that psychotic-like experiences, including both bizarre and non-bizarre delusion-like beliefs, are frequently found in the general population. This supports the idea that psychotic symptoms likely lie on a continuum.&quot;

== Religion and psychotherapy ==
Clients&#x27; religious beliefs are increasingly being considered in psychotherapy with the goal of improving service and effectiveness of treatment. A resulting development was theistic psychotherapy. Conceptually, it consists of theological principles, a theistic view of personality, and a theistic view of psychotherapy. Following an explicit minimizing strategy, therapists attempt to minimize conflict by acknowledging their religious views while being respectful of client&#x27;s religious views. This is argued to up the potential for therapists to directly utilize religious practices and principles in therapy, such as prayer, forgiveness, and grace. In contrast to such an approach, psychoanalyst Robin S. Brown argues for the extent to which our spiritual commitments remain unconscious. Drawing from the work of Jung, Brown suggests that &quot;our biases can only be suspended in the extent to which they are no longer our biases&quot;.

===Pastoral psychology===
One application of the psychology of religion is in pastoral psychology, the use of psychological findings to improve the pastoral care provided by pastors and other clergy, especially in how they support ordinary members of their congregations. Pastoral psychology is also concerned with improving the practice of chaplains in healthcare and in the military. One major concern of pastoral psychology is to improve the practice of pastoral counseling. Pastoral psychology is a topic of interest for professional journals such as the &quot;Journal of Psychology and Christianity&quot; and the &quot;Journal of Psychology and Theology&quot;. In 1984, Thomas Oden severely criticized mid-20th-century pastoral care and the pastoral psychology that guided it as having entirely abandoned its classical/traditional sources, and having become overwhelmingly dominated by modern psychological influences from Freud, Rogers, and others. More recently, others have described pastoral psychology as a field that experiences a tension between psychology and theology.

===Artificial Intelligence in the Psychology of Religion===

In recent years, the psychology of religion has increasingly recognized the methodological contributions of artificial intelligence (AI). AI offers new opportunities, particularly in data analysis and the examination of complex religious topics. Murat Çinici&#x27;s doctoral dissertation, &quot;Artificial Intelligence and Religiosity: A Methodological Approach to Studies in the Psychology of Religion,&quot; provides a framework for integrating AI into this field.

Additionally, in their study Artificial Intelligence and the Psychology of Religion, Çinici and Kızılgeçit explore the broader implications of AI on religious perceptions. 
Furthermore, the qualitative research titled &quot;A Qualitative Study on Belief-Unbelief, Natural Disasters, and Death with the Artificial Intelligence Chatbot ChatGPT: The Effects of Religion and Spirituality on Psychological Health&quot; examines topics such as faith, spiritual well-being, and mortality through AI applications.

<text>Paul Jacob Alexander (March 11, 1904 – May 6, 1969) was a newspaper publisher and Seattle City Councilman.

Paul Jacob Alexander was born in Seattle, Washington on March 11, 1904, to Alfred and Lillian (Wooding) Alexander. He graduated from Ballard High School and spent a semester at the University of Washington. He worked for &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; in the 1920s, and purchased the &quot;Rainier District Times&quot;, a community newspaper in the Rainier Valley, in 1929. He sold the paper in 1965.

He ran unsuccessfully for the Seattle City Council in 1952 and 1954. He was elected in 1956 and re-elected in 1960 and 1964. He was a Republican, and although he was a strong supporter of freedom of the press, he considered himself a conservative. In 1963, he succeeded in removing an emergency clause from Seattle&#x27;s proposed open housing ordinance that would have allowed it to take effect without a public vote, and in 1964 he ran for re-election as an opponent of open housing.

As the chairman of the council&#x27;s Utilities Committee, he was attending a reception at the American Public Power Association in Washington, D.C. when he died of a heart attack. Liem Tuai was appointed to fill his seat.

He lived in Rainier Valley, a block from Lake Washington.

<text>Charles-Jean-François Hénault (; 8 February 1685 – 24 November 1770) was a French writer and historian.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Hénault was born in Paris. His father, René Jean Rémy Hénault de Cantobre (1648–1737) a farmer-general of taxes, &quot;Ferme générale&quot;, was a man of literary tastes, and young Hénault obtained a good education at the Jesuit college, Lycée Louis-le-Grand. His mother was Françoise de Ponthon (died 1738).

Captivated by the eloquence of Massillon, in his fifteenth year he entered the Oratory with the view of becoming a preacher but after two-year&#x27;s residence he changed his intention, and, inheriting a position which secured him access to the most select society of Paris, he achieved distinction at an early period by his witty and graceful manners.

===Career===
Hénault&#x27;s literary talent, manifested in the composition of various light poetical pieces, an opera, a tragedy (&quot;Cornélie, vestale&quot;, 1713), etc., obtained his entrance to the Academy (1723). &quot;Petit-maître&quot; as he was, he had also serious capacity, for he became councillor of the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris (1705), and in 1710 he was chosen president of the chamber of inquiries (French: Chambre des Enquêtes). He also hosted the Club de l&#x27;Entresol (1724–1731) in his house on the Place Vendôme. After the death of the count de Rieux (son of the famous financier, Samuel Bernard) he became (1753) superintendent of the household of Queen Marie Leszczynska, whose intimate friendship he had previously enjoyed.

On Hénault&#x27;s recovery in his eightieth year from a dangerous malady (1765) he professed to have undergone religious conversion and retired into private life, devoting the remainder of his days to study and devotion. His religion was, however, according to the marquis d&#x27;Argenson, exempt from fanaticism, persecution, bitterness and intrigue; and it did not prevent him from continuing his friendship with Voltaire, to whom it is said he had formerly rendered the service of saving the manuscript of &quot;La Henriade&quot;, when its author was about to commit it to the flames.

The literary work on which Hénault bestowed his chief attention was the &quot;Abrégé chronologique de l&#x27;histoire de France&quot;, first published in 1744 without the author&#x27;s name. In the compass of two volumes he comprised the whole history of France from the earliest times to the death of Louis XIV. The work has no originality. Hénault had kept his note-books of the history lectures at the Jesuit college, of which the substance was taken from Mézeray and P Daniel. He revised them first in 1723, and later put them in the form of question and answer on the model of P le Ragois, and by following Dubos and Boulainvilliers and with the aid of the abbé Boudot he compiled his &quot;Abrégé&quot;.

The research is all on the surface and is only borrowed. But the work had a prodigious success, and was translated into several languages, even into Chinese. This was due partly to Hénault&#x27;s popularity and position, partly to the agreeable style which made the history readable. He inserted, according to the fashion of the period, moral and political reflections, which are always brief and generally as fresh and pleasing as they are just. A few masterly strokes reproduced the leading features of each age and the characters of its illustrious men; accurate chronological tables set forth the most interesting events in the history of each sovereign and the names of the great men who flourished during his reign; and interspersed throughout the work are occasional chapters on the social and civil state of the country at the close of each era in its history. Continuations of the work have been made at separate periods by Fantin des Odoards, by Anguis with notes by Walckenaer, and by Michaud. He died at Paris on 24 November 1770.

Hénault&#x27;s &quot;Mémoires&quot; have come down to us in two different versions, both are said to be authentic. One was published in 1855 by M. du Vigan; the other was owned by the Comte de Coutades, who permitted Lucien Perey to give long extracts in his work on &quot;Président Hénault&quot; (Paris, 1893). The memoirs are fragmentary and disconnected, but contain interesting anecdotes and details concerning persons of note. See the &quot;&quot; of Grimm, of Madame de Deffand and of Voltaire; the notice by Walckenaer in the edition of the Abrégé; Sainte-Beuve, &quot;Causeries du lundi&quot;, vol. xi.; and the &quot;Origines de l&#x27;abrégé&quot; (&quot;Ann. Bulletin de la Société de l&#x27;histoire de France&quot;, 1901). Also H Lion, &quot;Le Président Hénault&quot; (Paris, 1903).

The park is surrounded by the Green Lake neighborhood to the north and east, the Wallingford neighborhood to the south, the Phinney Ridge neighborhood to the west, and Woodland Park to the southwest. It is a glacial lake, its basin having been dug 50,000 years ago by the Vashon glacier, which also created Lake Washington, Union, Bitter and Haller Lakes.

==History==

Green Lake is called &quot;&quot; in Lushootseed, the native language of Seattle. The etymology of the name is unknown. It was given its English name by David Phillips, who surveyed the area in September 1855 for the United States Surveyor General. His first notes referred to it as &quot;Lake Green&quot; because even in its natural state the lake is prone to algae blooms. 

The lake has a surface area of , a mean depth of , and a maximum depth of . The lake has been dredged in order to maintain its depth. Green Lake lacks both surface water inflows and outflows. It once drained into Lake Washington via Ravenna Creek, but in 1911 the water level was lowered by to create parkland, causing the creek to dry up between Green Lake and Cowen Park. Ravenna Boulevard and its wide, grassy median were constructed over the creek bed. The lake is now fed by rainfall, storm runoff, and Seattle&#x27;s municipal water supply.

The area was originally homesteaded by various pioneers, the first being Erhart Sarfried, &quot;Green Lake John.&quot; Sarfried subdivided his homestead in 1888 and sold the land to various entrepreneurs. W.D. Wood built an &quot;amusement park&quot; on the west side of the lake (which never amounted to more than a glorified lawn for picnics). On the east side of the lake, A.L. Parker logged the woods and built a sawmill. Edward C. Kilbourne built the first trolley line connecting the area to the city, the route of which is now Green Lake Way North. The trolley lines kept growing, until by 1910 they extended completely around the lake and a round trip could be made on a separate line going back to the city.

In July 2008, several metal spikes up to in length were found along the bottom of the lake, injuring one person who accidentally stepped on them. The Seattle Parks Department later confirmed that the spikes were from a forgotten pilot program to control the growth of Eurasian water milfoil in Green Lake. The invasive aquatic plant had first appeared in the lake in the early 1980s. In 1984, the Parks Department installed of black plastic sheeting along the bottom of the lake, using the spikes to hold the sheeting in place. The spikes originally had curved tips to prevent injury, but the tips had corroded and broken off. The city paid a team of divers to remove the remaining spikes in late July 2008. Throughout the course of the investigation, it was revealed that the city had also tried combating the milfoil with weed-eating fish, but hadn&#x27;t made any serious efforts in the past 15 years aside from occasionally paying divers to pull the weeds by hand.

==Green Lake Park==
After 1903 the area became part of Seattle&#x27;s grand Olmsted Plan to create a series of interconnected greenspaces around the entire city. The park design still reflects the Olmsted vision.
Green Lake is surrounded by a paved pedestrian pathway. Bicycles, scooters, roller skates, and other wheeled vehicles were barred from using the paved pathway during the COVID-19 pandemic due to high pedestrian use and the construction of new protected bicycle lanes on Green Lake Way. This restriction, made by the Seattle Parks and Recreation department, is currently classified as a &quot;long-term temporary use restriction&quot;.

The path attracts people seeking exercise and relaxation, and can be crowded. There is also an outer non-paved path along the edge of the park. The park is a popular spot for qigong classes, roller hockey, soccer, baseball, golf, the Derek Baker Memorial Boccie Ball Club, and lawn bowls, part of the Woodland Park Lawn Bowling Club, and a monthly midnight bicycle race.

The bathhouse was built in 1927 next to an outdoor swimming area with concrete steps leading into the water. A lifeguard station with a boat was built next to this area in 1930 after several drownings in 1929. The bathhouse is now home to the Seattle Public Theater at the Bathhouse, a small venue for plays.

Across the lake from the bathhouse, in the northeast part of the park, Green Lake&#x27;s first community center was built in 1929 at a cost of $95,598. As it was built on the fill land from the 1911 draining, the community center was built on pilings. It contains two conference rooms, a gym with showers and bathrooms, and a stage. Toward the lake, another stepped swimming area was built. The tennis courts were added in 1945. In 1955 a 150,000 gallon (568 cubic meter) swimming pool was added. It was named the Evans Pool in honor of two brothers, Ben and Lou Evans, for their long service to athletics at Seattle parks.

On the east side of the park there is a basketball court, where local National Basketball Association players would occasionally appear for pick-up games in the 1990s.

The children&#x27;s wading pool was a Works Progress Administration project, as was the drainage ditch and the arched stone bridge providing a path over the ditch. The wading pool is staffed in the summer by the Seattle Parks department, and operates daily from June 23–September 3, from 11 a.m.–8 p.m.

South of the bathhouse is a lawn and fishing pier. Since 1984 this part of the lake has hosted an annual floating lantern memorial dedicated to the victims of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and all other victims of war.
Prospect Point, a spit of land that points toward Duck Island, protects a small area of water from high winds. This once was a popular spot for model boats, though model boating is no longer allowed on the lake.

The Green Lake Aqua Theater was built in 1950 for the first Seafair in order to house an attraction called the Aqua Follies and their &quot;swimusicals,&quot; a combination of aqua ballet, stage dancing, and comedy. The theater included a round stage and floating (though still recessed below the stage) orchestra pit, encircling a section of the lake with high diving platforms on each side. The grandstand capacity was more than 5,000 seats. The Aqua Follies continued to run during Seafair until 1965. Outside of the Seafair schedule the theater was the stage for plays and musicals whose directors always took advantage of the unique setting. In the summer of 1962, coinciding with the Century 21 Exposition, the Aqua Theater stage was host to a jazz festival, popular performers such as Bob Hope, two plays, and a special presentation of the Aqua Follies with 100 performers. After the World&#x27;s Fair, summer productions languished, which is usually blamed on Seattle&#x27;s unpredictable weather, until the Aqua Theater was mostly abandoned. A 1969 concert by the Grateful Dead revealed that the grandstand was crumbling and dangerous. Beginning in 1970 the theater was dismantled, stage right now serving as a pedestrian pier and stage left providing dock and storage for crew shells. Some sections of the grandstand were left in place.

The southwest portion of the park connects with adjoining Woodland Park on land that is also mostly fill, much of which came from the excavation of a route for Aurora Avenue. The southwest portion of the lake once extended to what is now N. 54th Street.

In the summer, Green Lake is also popular for swimming and boating. Although public use of motorized boats has been banned since at least 1968, the lake was the site of hydroplane races from 1929 to 1984. Today many forms of motor-less boats, including sailboarding, pedal boats, rowboats, skiffs, and canoes, are commonly seen on the lake. The Milk Carton Derby is held annually on the lake as one of the opening events of Seafair. While remnants of boat launches still exist, all launches have been removed from the lake; all boats must be hand carried to the water.

The Green Lake Small Craft Center, a Seattle Parks facility, is located on the south end of the lake. It houses both Green Lake Crew and the Seattle Canoe and Kayak Club. From August 10–13, 2006, Green Lake hosted the USRowing Masters National Championship Regatta, which included an estimated 2,000 competitors ranging in age from 23 to 86 years of age.

To the east of the lake across from the park, sits the Green Lake Library, built in 1910 with funds from Andrew Carnegie.

Within the lake is an artificial island that is commonly called Duck Island but was originally named Swan Island. It was built by the Works Progress Administration in 1936. The island was built (with dumped gravel) as a wildlife sanctuary and later housed some swan gifted to the city by Vancouver, British Columbia. The park board named the island Waldo&#x27;s Wildlife Sanctuary, after Waldo J Dahl, who took care of the swan. The swans, which were intended to start a small flock, did not have proper breeding habitat around the island. Future attempts to breed swans on the island (at least until the 1970s) were also failures. The state game commission officially made the island a reserve, off limits to people, in 1956. That designation ended in 1983. Though not noted as supporting any unique wildlife, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife notes the island is part of a bald eagle management buffer encompassing the south end of the lake. The parks department still considers the island off-limits to people for safety reasons. But there is an occasional presence of rope swings and empty alcohol containers.

==Green Lake Crew==
The Green Lake Small Craft Center, which is a Seattle Parks facility, is the training ground for Green Lake Crew, which has a history of successful rowing at the national level.

The Green Lake Small Craft Center also is home to the Seattle Canoe and Kayak Club. This Olympic style sprint paddling also competes at a national level.

==Animal and plant life==

Green Lake is a beacon for wildlife. Many types of wildlife, toads, ducks, cormorants, loons, herons, geese, turtles, raccoons, rats, squirrels, bats, hawks, eagles, and osprey are among the wild creatures commonly viewed there.

Green Lake is a popular dumping ground for unwanted house pets and developed a large population of feral rabbits. The rabbits created problems by burrowing under streets and retaining walls and into the Woodland Park Zoo. Over the years volunteers adopted or removed the rabbits but not fast enough to keep the population under control. In 2005 the city and zoo combined with the Rabbit Sanctuary to remove all of the rabbits and present an educational outreach campaign to teach people not to abandon rabbits. The practice of abandoning pets into or around Green Lake has resulted in several other non-native species needing removal, mostly ordinary goldfish but including exotic species such as sturgeon and caiman at various times.

Recently, a program has been implemented to substantially reduce the number of ducks and geese. Their droppings raise the level of phosphorus in the lake, leading to excessive growths of algae and milfoil. In 2003 the lake was treated with aluminum sulfate to encapsulate the phosphorus. A paddle boat, moored in the lake, is used to cut the milfoil. The fowl also leave pathogens in the lake which can cause Swimmer&#x27;s itch. This shows the difficulty of maintaining water quality in a stagnant lake.

Many species of fish live in Green Lake. Trout, mainly rainbow trout, are stocked for recreational fishing. A large population of common carp are present, and can be seen spawning in the shallows in spring. Tiger muskellunge were stocked to control the carp population, as carp are perceived as an invasive species and can contribute to eutrophication. The lake also contains largemouth bass, yellow perch, bluegill, yellow bullhead, channel catfish, and small populations of many different unexpected species.

During the spring, Green Lake Park is in bloom with pink and white cherry trees. Planted along the west side of the lake in 1931 and 1932, they were a gift from the Japanese Association of North America.

<doc id="507208" wikidata="Q13520655" url="?curid=507208" title="Double factorial">
<text>In mathematics, the double factorial of a number , denoted by , is the product of all the positive integers up to that have the same parity (odd or even) as . That is,

formula_1

Restated, this says that for even , the double factorial is
formula_2
while for odd it is
formula_3
For example, . The zero double factorial as an empty product.

The sequence of double factorials for even = starts as

The sequence of double factorials for odd = starts as
The term odd factorial is sometimes used for the double factorial of an odd number.
The term semifactorial is also used by Knuth as a synonym of double factorial.

==History and usage==
In a 1902 paper, the physicist Arthur Schuster wrote:
 states that the double factorial was originally introduced in order to simplify the expression of certain trigonometric integrals that arise in the derivation of the Wallis product. Double factorials also arise in expressing the volume of a hyperball and surface area of a hypersphere, and they have many applications in enumerative combinatorics. They occur in Student&#x27;s -distribution (1908), though Gosset did not use the double exclamation point notation.

==Relation to the factorial==
Because the double factorial only involves about half the factors of the ordinary factorial, its value is not substantially larger than the square root of the factorial , and it is much smaller than the iterated factorial .

The factorial of a positive may be written as the product of two double factorials:
formula_4
and therefore
formula_5
where the denominator cancels the unwanted factors in the numerator. (The last form also applies when .)

For an even non-negative integer with , the double factorial may be expressed as
formula_6

For odd with , combining the two previous formulas yields
formula_7

For an odd positive integer with , the double factorial may be expressed in terms of -permutations of or a falling factorial as
formula_8

==Applications in enumerative combinatorics==

Double factorials are motivated by the fact that they occur frequently in enumerative combinatorics and other settings. For instance, for odd values of counts
*Perfect matchings of the complete graph for odd . In such a graph, any single vertex &quot;v&quot; has possible choices of vertex that it can be matched to, and once this choice is made the remaining problem is one of selecting a perfect matching in a complete graph with two fewer vertices. For instance, a complete graph with four vertices &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;d&quot; has three perfect matchings: &quot;ab&quot; and &quot;cd&quot;, &quot;ac&quot; and &quot;bd&quot;, and &quot;ad&quot; and &quot;bc&quot;. Perfect matchings may be described in several other equivalent ways, including involutions without fixed points on a set of items (permutations in which each cycle is a pair) or chord diagrams (sets of chords of a set of points evenly spaced on a circle such that each point is the endpoint of exactly one chord, also called Brauer diagrams). The numbers of matchings in complete graphs, without constraining the matchings to be perfect, are instead given by the telephone numbers, which may be expressed as a summation involving double factorials.
*Stirling permutations, permutations of the multiset of numbers in which each pair of equal numbers is separated only by larger numbers, where . The two copies of must be adjacent; removing them from the permutation leaves a permutation in which the maximum element is , with positions into which the adjacent pair of values may be placed. From this recursive construction, a proof that the Stirling permutations are counted by the double permutations follows by induction. Alternatively, instead of the restriction that values between a pair may be larger than it, one may also consider the permutations of this multiset in which the first copies of each pair appear in sorted order; such a permutation defines a matching on the positions of the permutation, so again the number of permutations may be counted by the double permutations.
*Heap-ordered trees, trees with nodes labeled , such that the root of the tree has label 0, each other node has a larger label than its parent, and such that the children of each node have a fixed ordering. An Euler tour of the tree (with doubled edges) gives a Stirling permutation, and every Stirling permutation represents a tree in this way.
*Unrooted binary trees with labeled leaves. Each such tree may be formed from a tree with one fewer leaf, by subdividing one of the tree edges and making the new vertex be the parent of a new leaf.
*Rooted binary trees with labeled leaves. This case is similar to the unrooted case, but the number of edges that can be subdivided is even, and in addition to subdividing an edge it is possible to add a node to a tree with one fewer leaf by adding a new root whose two children are the smaller tree and the new leaf.

 and list several additional objects with the same counting sequence, including &quot;trapezoidal words&quot; (numerals in a mixed radix system with increasing odd radixes), height-labeled Dyck paths, height-labeled ordered trees, &quot;overhang paths&quot;, and certain vectors describing the lowest-numbered leaf descendant of each node in a rooted binary tree. For bijective proofs that some of these objects are equinumerous, see and .

The even double factorials give the numbers of elements of the hyperoctahedral groups (signed permutations or symmetries of a hypercube)

==Asymptotics==
Stirling&#x27;s approximation for the factorial can be used to derive an asymptotic equivalent for the double factorial. In particular, since formula_9 one has as formula_10 tends to infinity that

formula_11

==Extensions==

===Negative arguments===
The ordinary factorial, when extended to the gamma function, has a pole at each negative integer, preventing the factorial from being defined at these numbers. However, the double factorial of odd numbers may be extended to any negative odd integer argument by inverting its recurrence relation
formula_12
to give
formula_13
Using this inverted recurrence, (−1)!! = 1, (−3)!! = −1, and (−5)!! = ; negative odd numbers with greater magnitude have fractional double factorials. In particular, when is an odd number, this gives
formula_14

===Complex arguments===
Disregarding the above definition of for even values of , the double factorial for odd integers can be extended to most real and complex numbers by noting that when is a positive odd integer then

formula_15
where formula_16 is the gamma function.

The final expression is defined for all complex numbers except the negative even integers and satisfies everywhere it is defined. As with the gamma function that extends the ordinary factorial function, this double factorial function is logarithmically convex in the sense of the Bohr–Mollerup theorem. Asymptotically, formula_17

The generalized formula formula_18 does not agree with the previous product formula for for non-negative &quot;even&quot; integer values of . Instead, this generalized formula implies the following alternative:
formula_19
with the value for 0!! in this case being

* formula_20 .
Using this generalized formula as the definition, the volume of an -dimensional hypersphere of radius can be expressed as

formula_21

==Additional identities==
For integer values of ,

formula_22
Using instead the extension of the double factorial of odd numbers to complex numbers, the formula is
formula_23

Double factorials can also be used to evaluate integrals of more complicated trigonometric polynomials.

Double factorials of odd numbers are related to the gamma function by the identity:

formula_24

Some additional identities involving double factorials of odd numbers are:

formula_25

An approximation for the ratio of the double factorial of two consecutive integers is
formula_26
This approximation gets more accurate as increases, which can be seen as a result of the Wallis Integral.

==Generalizations==

===Definitions===

In the same way that the double factorial generalizes the notion of the single factorial, the following definition of the integer-valued multiple factorial functions (multifactorials), or -factorial functions, extends the notion of the double factorial function for positive integers formula_27:

formula_28

===Alternative extension of the multifactorial===
Alternatively, the multifactorial can be extended to most real and complex numbers by noting that when is one more than a positive multiple of the positive integer then

formula_29

This last expression is defined much more broadly than the original. In the same way that is not defined for negative integers, and is not defined for negative even integers, is not defined for negative multiples of . However, it is defined and satisfies for all other complex numbers . This definition is consistent with the earlier definition only for those integers satisfying .

In addition to extending to most complex numbers , this definition has the feature of working for all positive real values of . Furthermore, when , this definition is mathematically equivalent to the function, described above. Also, when , this definition is mathematically equivalent to the alternative extension of the double factorial.

===Generalized Stirling numbers expanding the multifactorial functions===

A class of generalized Stirling numbers of the first kind is defined for by the following triangular recurrence relation:

formula_30

These generalized &quot;-factorial coefficients&quot; then generate the distinct symbolic polynomial products defining the multiple factorial, or -factorial functions, , as

formula_31

The distinct polynomial expansions in the previous equations actually define the -factorial products for multiple distinct cases of the least residues for .

The generalized -factorial polynomials, where , which generalize the Stirling convolution polynomials from the single factorial case to the multifactorial cases, are defined by

formula_32

for . These polynomials have a particularly nice closed-form ordinary generating function given by

formula_33

Other combinatorial properties and expansions of these generalized -factorial triangles and polynomial sequences are considered in .

===Exact finite sums involving multiple factorial functions===

Suppose that and are integer-valued. Then we can expand the next single finite sums involving the multifactorial, or -factorial functions, , in terms of the Pochhammer symbol and the generalized, rational-valued binomial coefficients as

formula_34

and moreover, we similarly have double sum expansions of these functions given by

formula_35

The first two sums above are similar in form to a known &quot;non-round&quot; combinatorial identity for the double factorial function when given by .

formula_36

Similar identities can be obtained via context-free grammars. Additional finite sum expansions of congruences for the -factorial functions, , modulo any prescribed integer for any are given by .

<text>In mathematics, and more specifically number theory, the hyperfactorial of a positive integer formula_1 is the product of the numbers of the form formula_2 from formula_3 to 

==Definition==
The hyperfactorial of a positive integer formula_1 is the product of the numbers formula_5. That is,
formula_6
Following the usual convention for the empty product, the hyperfactorial of 0 is 1. The sequence of hyperfactorials, beginning with formula_7, is:
==Interpolation and approximation==
The hyperfactorials were studied beginning in the 19th century by Hermann Kinkelin and James Whitbread Lee Glaisher. As Kinkelin showed, just as the factorials can be continuously interpolated by the gamma function, the hyperfactorials can be continuously interpolated by the K-function.

Glaisher provided an asymptotic formula for the hyperfactorials, analogous to Stirling&#x27;s formula for the factorials:
formula_8
where formula_9 is the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant.

==Other properties==
According to an analogue of Wilson&#x27;s theorem on the behavior of factorials modulo prime numbers, when formula_10 is an odd prime number
formula_11
where formula_12 is the notation for the double factorial.

The hyperfactorials give the sequence of discriminants of Hermite polynomials in their probabilistic formulation.

<doc id="507210" wikidata="Q11636332" url="?curid=507210" title="Superfactorial">
<text>In mathematics, and more specifically number theory, the superfactorial of a positive integer formula_1 is the product of the first formula_1 factorials. They are a special case of the Jordan–Pólya numbers, which are products of arbitrary collections of factorials.

==Definition==
The formula_1th superfactorial formula_4 may be defined as:
formula_5
Following the usual convention for the empty product, the superfactorial of 0 is 1. The sequence of superfactorials, beginning with formula_6, is:
==Properties==
Just as the factorials can be continuously interpolated by the gamma function, the superfactorials can be continuously interpolated by the Barnes G-function.

According to an analogue of Wilson&#x27;s theorem on the behavior of factorials modulo prime numbers, when formula_7 is an odd prime number
formula_8
where formula_9 is the notation for the double factorial.

For every integer formula_10, the number formula_11 is a square number. This may be expressed as stating that, in the formula for formula_12 as a product of factorials, omitting one of the factorials (the middle one, formula_13) results in a square product. Additionally, if any formula_14 integers are given, the product of their pairwise differences is always a multiple of formula_4, and equals the superfactorial when the given numbers are consecutive.

<text>Moritzburg is a municipality in the district of Meissen in Saxony, Germany, between Meissen itself, an early centre of Saxony, and today&#x27;s capital Dresden. It is most famous for its Baroque castle, Schloss Moritzburg.

The village, which was originally known as Eisenburg, was first mentioned in 1294. It became a market in 1675. The Saxon state stud has been located here since 1828. In 1884, a narrow-gauge railway, the Radebeul–Radeburg line, was built connecting the town to the district capital Radebeul and Radeburg. It was renamed Moritzburg, after the nearby castle, in 1934. German artist Käthe Kollwitz lived at the invitation of Prince Ernst Heinrich von Wettin in the Rüdenhof in Moritzburg from 1944 until her death on 22 April 1945. In 1995, a small museum was opened in the Rüdenhof.

<text>François Eudes de Mézeray (1610 – 10 July 1683) was a French historian.

Mézeray was born at Ri near Argentan, where his father was a surgeon.
He had two brothers, one of whom, Jean-Eudes, was the founder of the order of the Eudists. François studied at the University of Caen, and completed his education at the College of Ste Barbe at Paris. His &quot;Histoire de France depuis Faramond jusqu&#x27;au règne de Louis le juste&quot; (3 vols., 1643–1651), is a fairly accurate summary of French and Latin chronicles.

Mézeray was appointed to a committee that supervised &quot;La Gazette&quot;.

Mézeray won the favor of Pierre Séguier and was given the title &quot;Historiographer to the King of France&quot;. In 1649, on the death of Vincent Voiture, he was admitted to the Académie française. His &quot;Abrégé chronologique&quot; (3 vols., 1667–1668) went through fifteen editions between 1668 and 1717; and he used it to attack the financiers, with the result that his salary as historiographer was diminished by Colbert.

Mézeray succeeded Valentin Conrart as permanent secretary to the Académie française (1675), and died at Paris. He translated Grotius&#x27;s &quot;Traité de la religion chretienne&quot; (1640), and a &quot;Histoire des Turcs depuis 1612 jusqu&#x27;en 1649&quot; (1650), which is an addition to a continuation of Laonikos Chalkokondyles.

<doc id="507221" wikidata="Q1719128" url="?curid=507221" title="PL/0">
<text>PL/0 is a programming language, intended as an educational programming language, that is similar to but much simpler than Pascal, a general-purpose programming language. It serves as an example of how to construct a compiler. It was originally introduced in the book, &quot;Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs&quot;, by Niklaus Wirth in 1976. It features quite limited language constructs: there are no real numbers, very few basic arithmetic operations and no control-flow constructs other than &quot;if&quot; and &quot;while&quot; blocks. While these limitations make writing real applications in this language impractical, it helps the compiler remain compact and simple.

== Features ==
All constants and variables used must be declared explicitly.

The only data types are integers. The only operators are arithmetic and comparison operators. There is an codice_1 function that tests whether the argument is odd.

In the original implementation presented by Wirth, there are no input and output routines. The compiler prints the value as a given variable changes. So the program:

var i, s;
begin
 i := 0; s := 0;
 while i &lt; 5 do
 begin
 i := i + 1;
 s := s + i * i
 end
end.

gives the output:

However, most implementations have single input and single output routines.

Flow control structures are codice_2 and codice_3 constructs and user-defined procedures. Procedures cannot accept parameters.

==Grammar==
The following is the syntax rules of the model language defined in EBNF:
program = block &quot;.&quot; ;

block = [ &quot;const&quot; ident &quot;=&quot; number {&quot;,&quot; ident &quot;=&quot; number} &quot;;&quot;]
 [ &quot;var&quot; ident {&quot;,&quot; ident} &quot;;&quot;]
 { &quot;procedure&quot; ident &quot;;&quot; block &quot;;&quot; } statement ;

statement = [ ident &quot;:=&quot; expression | &quot;call&quot; ident 
 | &quot;?&quot; ident | &quot;!&quot; expression 
 | &quot;begin&quot; statement {&quot;;&quot; statement } &quot;end&quot; 
 | &quot;if&quot; condition &quot;then&quot; statement 
 | &quot;while&quot; condition &quot;do&quot; statement ];

condition = &quot;odd&quot; expression |
 expression (&quot;=&quot;|&quot;#&quot;|&quot;&lt;&quot;|&quot;&lt;=&quot;|&quot;&gt;&quot;|&quot;&gt;=&quot;) expression ;

expression = [ &quot;+&quot;|&quot;-&quot;] term { (&quot;+&quot;|&quot;-&quot;) term};

term = factor {(&quot;*&quot;|&quot;/&quot;) factor};

factor = ident | number | &quot;(&quot; expression &quot;)&quot;;
It is rather easy for students to write a recursive descent parser for such a simple syntax. Therefore, the PL/0 compiler is still widely used in courses on compiler construction throughout the world. Due to the lack of features in the original specification, students usually spend most of their time with extending the language and their compiler. They usually start with introducing codice_4 and continue with more advanced features like parameter passing to procedures or data structures like arrays, strings or floating point numbers.

==Use in education==
The main article on compilers honours PL/0 for introducing several influential concepts (stepwise refinement, recursive descent parsing, EBNF, P-code, T-diagrams) to the field by educating students to use these concepts. Over the last 3 decades, most university courses on compiler construction that used PL/0 have followed Wirth strictly in employing these techniques (see references below). Some years ago university courses deviated from the course set by Wirth with the replacement of the classical recursive descent parsing technique by a (nonetheless classical) Unix-like approach of employing lex and yacc. Only recently an implementation (PL/0 Language Tools) along this way has also combined modern concepts like object-orientation and design patterns with a modern scripting language (Python), allowing students to consume the source text of the implementation in a contemporary programming style.

==Compiler construction==
In December 1976, Wirth wrote a small booklet about compiler construction, containing the full source code of the PL/0 compiler. The syntax rules above were taken from this first edition of Wirth&#x27;s book &quot;Compilerbau&quot;. In later editions of this book (under the influence of his ongoing research) Wirth changed the syntax of PL/0. He changed the spelling of keywords like codice_5 and codice_6 to uppercase. This change made PL/0 resemble Modula-2 more closely. At the same time, Wirth&#x27;s friend and collaborator C. A. R. Hoare was working on his influential communicating sequential processes concept, which used the exclamation mark &quot;!&quot; and the question mark &quot;?&quot; to denote communication primitives. Wirth added both symbols to the PL/0 language, but he did not mention their semantics in the book.

==Examples==

This program outputs the squares of numbers from 1 to 10. Most courses in compiler construction today have replaced the exclamation mark with the codice_7 procedure.

VAR x, squ;

PROCEDURE square;
BEGIN
 squ:= x * x
END;

BEGIN
 x := 1;
 WHILE x &lt;= 10 DO
 BEGIN
 CALL square;
 ! squ;
 x := x + 1
 END
END.
This following program prints the prime numbers from 1 to 100. The write statement corresponds to &#x27;!&#x27; statement in the EBNF syntax above.
const max = 100;
var arg, ret;

procedure isprime;
var i;
begin
 ret := 1;
 i := 2;
 while i &lt; arg do
 begin
 if arg / i * i = arg then
 begin
 ret := 0;
 i := arg
 end;
 i := i + 1
 end
end;

procedure primes;
begin
 arg := 2;
 while arg &lt; max do
 begin
 call isprime;
 if ret = 1 then write arg;
 arg := arg + 1
 end
end;

call primes


The following example was taken from the second edition of Wirth&#x27;s book Compilerbau, which appeared in 1986 in Germany.
VAR x, y, z, q, r, n, f;

PROCEDURE multiply;
VAR a, b;
BEGIN
 a := x;
 b := y;
 z := 0;
 WHILE b &gt; 0 DO
 BEGIN
 IF ODD b THEN z := z + a;
 a := 2 * a;
 b := b / 2
 END
END;

PROCEDURE divide;
VAR w;
BEGIN
 r := x;
 q := 0;
 w := y;
 WHILE w &lt;= r DO w := 2 * w;
 WHILE w &gt; y DO
 BEGIN
 q := 2 * q;
 w := w / 2;
 IF w &lt;= r THEN
 BEGIN
 r := r - w;
 q := q + 1
 END
 END
END;

PROCEDURE gcd;
VAR f, g;
BEGIN
 f := x;
 g := y;
 WHILE f # g DO
 BEGIN
 IF f &lt; g THEN g := g - f;
 IF g &lt; f THEN f := f - g
 END;
 z := f
END;

PROCEDURE fact;
BEGIN
 IF n &gt; 1 THEN
 BEGIN
 f := n * f;
 n := n - 1;
 CALL fact
 END
END;

BEGIN
 ?x; ?y; CALL multiply; !z;
 ?x; ?y; CALL divide; !q; !r;
 ?x; ?y; CALL gcd; !z;
 ?n; f := 1; CALL fact; !f
END.
==Oberon-0==
In the third and last edition of his book on compiler construction, Wirth replaced PL/0 with Oberon-0. The language Oberon-0 is much more complex than PL/0. For example, Oberon-0 offers arrays, records, type declarations and procedure parameters. The publisher of Wirth&#x27;s books (Addison-Wesley) has decided to phase out all his books, but Wirth has published revised editions of his book beginning in 2004. , the most recent revision available is from May 2017.

<text>Linux Magazine is an international magazine for Linux software enthusiasts and professionals. It is published by Computec Media GmbH in German-speaking countries and Linux New Media USA, LLC. for English edition.
The magazine was first published in German in 1994, and later in English, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish. The German edition is called Linux-Magazin (); the American/Canadian edition was Linux Pro Magazine () until January of 2023 when the name changed to Linux Magazine. The founding company was Articon GmbH.

The magazine is published on the first Thursday of each month. Every issue includes a DVD-ROM, usually featuring a recent version of a Linux distribution.

==&quot;Linux-Magazin&quot;==
&quot;Linux-Magazin&quot; is among the oldest magazines about Linux in the world. The first German language issue appeared in October 1994, seven months after &quot;Linux Journal&quot;&#x27;s first issue, as the information paper for DELUG, the German Linux user group. The slogan of the magazine is „Die Zeitschrift für Linux-Professionals“ (German for &quot;The magazine for Linux professionals&quot;).

Medialinx AG along with its titles was acquired by Computec Media in 2014.

==InfoStrada&#x27;s American-based magazine==
When launched their North American version of &quot;Linux-Magazin&quot;, to avoid a naming conflict with another magazine called &quot;Linux Magazine&quot; published in the United States by InfoStrada, Linux New Media&#x27;s American and Canadian magazine took the name &quot;Linux Pro Magazine&quot;.

Linux Magazine () was a magazine about Linux written in English and published in the United States by Mountain View, California-based InfoStrada. Their magazine covered system administration, Linux distros, free software, Linux development and other topics.

In June 2008, Linux New Media USA, LLC purchased assets from InfoStrada related to their magazine. Consequently, InfoStrada&#x27;s &quot;Linux Magazine&quot; was no longer offering print subscriptions. The website for InfoStrada&#x27;s &quot;Linux Magazine&quot; was acquired by QuinStreet&#x27;s Internet.com network, so no name-change was applied to Linux New Media&#x27;s North American magazine. The latest article on QuinStreet&#x27;s site is dated 30 June 2011.

In October 2016, &quot;Linux Voice&quot; merged as a special section into Linux Magazine.

<text>Robert Lee Thornton Sr. (often R. L. Thornton; August 10, 1880 – February 15, 1964) was an American banker, civic leader, and four-term Mayor of Dallas, Texas.

A child of tenant farmers, Thornton&#x27;s early years were divided between school and farm labor. After holding several jobs and starting two unsuccessful business ventures, Thornton began a banking operation in Dallas in 1916. The bank progressed to be a Texas-wide institution, and by 1923 it had a national charter. Thornton served as president (1916–1947) and board chairman (1947–1964) of the bank he founded, the Mercantile Bank and Trust Co.

Thornton became a prominent businessman and community figure, serving as president of the Dallas Chamber of Commerce from 1933 to 1936, and as president of the State Fair of Texas from 1945 to 1960. He played a major part in securing the Texas Centennial Exposition for Dallas. From 1953 to 1961, Thornton served as mayor of Dallas. His vigorous promotion of the city and its development earned him the soubriquet &quot;Mr. Dallas&quot; in the media. His avuncular and countryfied manner saw him often referred to and addressed as &quot;Uncle Bob&quot; by locals and associates.

Beginning in 1994, claims that Thornton had been a Ku Klux Klan member in the early 1920s have arisen. Records of any Klan association are scant and have been contested. His family argue that although Thornton was a highly scrutinized public figure, as mayor and prominent business leader, no allegations of Klan affiliation surfaced during his lifetime, nor for thirty years after his death. Thornton&#x27;s involvement in the city&#x27;s desegregation and civil rights matters in the 1950s and 60s provided an opening for criticism from African American and other civil rights campaigners; however there are no contemporary, nor later, accusations on record, prior to the one surfacing in 1994.

Thornton married in 1905 and settled in Dallas with his wife, where they raised four children. Thornton died in 1964. Various roads and places in Dallas are named for him. Since the 1990s there have been intermittent calls for these place names to be changed on the basis of Thornton&#x27;s perceived involvement with the Klan. Although little firm evidence of such involvement appears to exist, the claim of his membership is repeated from time-to-time in various publications.

== Early years ==
Robert Lee Thornton was born to tenant farmer William Travis Thornton and Polly Ann () in a sod-roofed, half-dugout in Hamilton County, Texas, near Hico. His childhood time was divided between farm work, such as picking cotton, and attending school. He discontinued schooling at the eighth grade because his family needed him to work full-time farming. Formal business education was limited to an eight-week bookkeeping course at the Metropolitan Business College in Dallas. His first visit to Dallas was as an eight-year-old; he traveled by wagon with his father and a brother to visit the State Fair of Texas. The experience made a life-long impression: his involvement with the State Fair, and Dallas, lasted for more than 75 years.

== Business career ==
Other than picking cotton, Thornton&#x27;s first job was as an $18-a-month store clerk in Heelstring (now Bristol) in Ellis County, Texas. Thornton then worked as a traveling candy salesman, supplying the Oklahoma Indian Territory. By 1912, Thornton returned to Dallas and became involved in two business ventures – a bookstore and a mortgage banking company – both of which were unsuccessful.

In 1916, at the age of 36, with loans from family and friends, he organized a private bank in Dallas in an office that had formerly housed the Blue Goose restaurant. It was from this first successful venture that Thornton launched his four-decade banking career as president of Stiles, Thornton, and Lund, which eventually would become the third-largest bank in Dallas. A year later, the bank reorganized as the Dallas County State Bank.

Many of Dallas&#x27; business leaders joined Thornton on the bank&#x27;s board of directors. They included former Dallas mayor W. M. Holland, business leaders John W. Carpenter, Jewish business leader Julius Schepps, Catholic-community leader John Vilbig Jr., and Sanger–Harris department store general manager Charles L. Sanger. Thornton&#x27;s fellow bankers recognized his business talent early in his career when they elected him president of the Texas Bankers Association in 1924–1925.

By 1923 they had outgrown the name &quot;Dallas County State Bank&quot; and became the &quot;Mercantile Bank and Trust Co.&quot;, with a national charter. Two years later, the bank&#x27;s capital hit the $1 million mark. Thornton served as president from 1916 to 1947, when he became chairman of the board until 1964. It would eventually become MCorp Bank through a merger and was then acquired by Bank One Corporation. The current successor is JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., who acquired Bank One in 2004.

== Civic leader ==
Shortly after Dallas County State Bank opened, Thornton joined the Dallas Chamber of Commerce, serving as president of the Chamber from 1933 to 1936. In 1923, he was named to the Dallas Plan Commission and later to the economic development organization, Industrial Dallas, Inc. that toured the Southwest encouraging businesses to move to Dallas.

He served as a member of the board of directors of a range of Dallas organizations. They included nonprofits: Children&#x27;s Development Center, Greater Dallas Council of Churches, Texas Research Foundation, Scottish Rite Hospital, and the Southwestern Medical Foundation, as well as the citizens&#x27; advisory Trinity Improvement Authority, and the Texas Turnpike Authority agency. He volunteered to head the World War II Dallas War Chest to raise money through war bonds, chaired the Big Gifts division for the Dallas County United Fund, and chaired the campaign to approve the Dallas County courthouse complex. His greatest love was Dallas&#x27; Fair Park. He spent more than three decades involved with the [city-owned] park and the State Fair of Texas beginning with his election to the Fair board in 1929. He became chairman in 1945, serving until 1960, when he was elected board president.

In 1933, while serving as chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, he joined with his close friend Fred Florence of Republic Bank and Nathan Adams of First National Bank to pursue hosting the Texas Centennial and Exposition at Fair Park in 1936. The first world&#x27;s fair in the Southwest hosted more than six million people including U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and was credited with cushioning Dallas from the Great Depression. According to historian Michael V. Hazel, &quot;The man most responsible for securing the central Centennial Exposition for Dallas was Robert L. Thornton, head of the Mercantile Bank.&quot; In his history of the Dallas Citizens Council, author Darwin Payne noted, &quot;Despite financial losses, the Centennial was the crowning event in the city&#x27;s history. The public relations value alone was incalculable, and the economic benefits enormous.&quot; Payne wrote, &quot;Dallas had become a different city, different in self-awareness as well as in its new national image as a prosperous, sophisticated city. That image was relayed to the nation in glowing articles in such prestigious publications as &quot;Fortune&quot; and &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;. Dallas almost overnight became &quot;Big D&quot;.&quot; 

To host the Centennial, Dallas leaders promised to raise millions of dollars for the effort. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The businessmen of the city had worked hard to raise $3.5 million for the event, but the experience had shown them how loosely organized their city was.&quot;  Thornton told the &quot;Times&quot; that committee members &quot;had to report back to their companies before making financial commitments. We needed people who could say &#x27;yes&#x27; or &#x27;no&#x27; right away to determine if a project could be done quickly and efficiently&quot;. In 1937 this concern drove Thornton to organize the Dallas Citizens Council (not to be confused with the &quot;White Citizens Councils in the South&quot;) made up of only the chief executive officers and decision-makers in Dallas. Since that time, the Council has put its collective money and expertise into projects deemed important for the city.

In his book, &quot;Big D: Triumphs and Troubles of an American Supercity in the 20th Century&quot;, Darwin Payne wrote, &quot;Thornton was widely recognized as &#x27;Mr. Dallas&#x27; by the 1950s. His folksy, avuncular ways earned him alternately the affectionate title of &quot;Uncle Bob&quot;,&quot; as he never forgot his country boy roots. A banker who was a natural salesman with energy and vision, R. L. Thornton sold Dallas to businesses across the nation and helped build Dallas into a major metropolitan area. &quot;City-building,&quot; he said, &quot;is just a privilege of citizenship.&quot; Through his leadership at the State Fair of Texas he made Dallas the Southwestern hub of entertainment and helped develop the State Fair of Texas into one of the largest in the world.

During his career, he received awards and honors, including the Linz Award for outstanding civic contributions (1947), the Sales Executive Club&#x27;s Number 1 Salesman of Dallas award (1948), the Greater Dallas Planning Council&#x27;s Distinguished Citizen Award (1955), the Press Club&#x27;s Headliner of the Year award (1955), the Man of Vision Award from the Dallas Chapter of the American Institute of Architects (1959), and an honorary doctor of humanities degree from the University of Dallas (1963).

== Mayor of Dallas ==
Early in 1953, Dallas Mayor J.B. Adoue Jr. announced he would not seek reelection. The city was struggling with rapid economic growth challenges amid a prolonged drought that meant a severe water shortage. City leaders launched an effort to draft the 72-year-old Thornton for mayor. The city&#x27;s business leadership was clearly in Thornton&#x27;s corner, and the draft movement gained momentum throughout the city. His support was broad-based, and &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; reported that &quot;Thornton has won wide respect among Dallas Negroes&quot; and quoted the Rev. E. C. Estell, pastor of Dallas&#x27; largest African American church, as saying, &quot;I do not know of any man who can serve our situation better... we must have a man like Thornton to lead us.&quot;

On February 10, Thornton accepted the draft and agreed to run for Mayor of Dallas in the April election. The &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; reported that he had no desire to hold public office, but he had &quot;never turned down a job for my city.&quot; He won the election with 69.5% of the vote, and at his first Council meeting, he said, &quot;This city government will govern for everyone alike. Dallas has no second-class citizens. All are created equal and will be treated equal – the rich, the poor, the high, the low.&quot; Thornton emphasized effective, businesslike, and open government, announcing that all City decisions would be made in public. &quot;He instructed the City Manager to advise all department heads that utmost courtesy be shown all citizens, with positively no exceptions.&quot;

Six months later, Thornton saw the Statler Hotel break ground in downtown Dallas. It would be the largest hotel in the Southwest and kicked off Thornton&#x27;s plan of &quot;Keep the Dirt Flyin’.&quot; Major municipal projects completed during his eight years in office included a new downtown library, a new city hall annex, construction of the Memorial Auditorium, and expansion of Dallas Love Field with a new passenger terminal. To ameliorate the devastating and prolonged droughts in North Texas, Thornton launched the construction of Lake Tawakoni and Lake Ray Hubbard reservoirs to supply water for Dallas.

Mayor Thornton ran unopposed in 1955 and won ahead of two other candidates in 1957, despite a major tornado that ripped through Oak Cliff and West Dallas the afternoon of election day, April 2, 1957. By 1959, the 78-year-old Thornton would face his most formidable and last election. Opposed by Earle Cabell of Cabell&#x27;s Dairy and the son and grandson of previous mayors of Dallas, Thornton was forced into a runoff since neither candidate received a majority of the votes. Two weeks later, Thornton won by 3,000 votes and began his fourth and last term as Mayor of Dallas. A &quot;National Geographic&quot; article by Stanley Walker noted in 1961 that his time in office had come to be regarded as the &quot;Thornton era&quot;.

== Controversies ==
R. L. Thornton addressed controversial issues during his business, mayoral and civic life: severe water shortages, long-delayed civic projects, need for crime reduction, economic development challenges, and desegregation issues for the city and State Fair. The most difficult challenge was the fight for equal rights under the law for Black citizens during the 1950s and 1960s.

=== Integration and the State Fair ===
Black Americans served with distinction during World War II and returned home to seek racial change. A National Park Service document cited the NAACP, &quot;emboldened by the record of Black servicemen in the war, a new corps of brilliant young lawyers... initiated major attacks against discrimination and segregation.&quot;  In Dallas, the leadership included A. Maceo Smith, Reverend E.C. Estell, Reverend Rhett James and Juanita Craft, the NAACP Youth Council advisor.

Since 1889 the State Fair in Dallas had been segregated and limited Black citizens&#x27; attendance to one day each year, initially called Colored People&#x27;s Day, and later renamed Negro Achievement Day in 1936. Starting in 1953, Ms. Craft organized years of peaceful protests with her NAACP youth group and others until the Fair was fully desegregated in 1967. Over the years, Thornton, as Mayor and State Fair of Texas president, personally brokered agreements with Craft, other African American leaders, and opponents in the Anglo community.

In 1954, with the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, the City of Dallas (and the Dallas Independent School District) needed to comply with the federal law regarding school and business desegregation and competing State of Texas decrees. Nearing the end of his last mayoral term, Thornton played a leadership role in Dallas&#x27; peaceful school and business desegregation and motivated the Dallas Citizens Council to mount a successful, peaceful Dallas desegregation effort. The political climate throughout Texas was significantly anti-integration, and Dallas remained one of the largest school systems in the South with a completely segregated school system.

Despite federal court decisions, the 55th Texas legislature passed a law in 1957 that required local communities to vote on school desegregation. Without a majority vote, Dallas ISD could lose $2.7 million in state aid, and lose accreditation if they tried to desegregate. The school superintendent and board members could be fined up to $1,000 for the same offense. In Dallas, a referendum was held on August 6, 1960 and resulted in an overwhelming 4 to 1 vote against integration.

Lacking a public mandate, &quot;Mayor Thornton believed the situation to be so critical that the Dallas Citizens Council must exercise its power to assure success.&quot; Citing the loss of reputation and business in other Southern cities that had not successfully desegregated schools, he convinced the Citizens Council of the need to seek peaceful desegregation in schools and businesses for economic self-interest reasons. Acceding to the mayor&#x27;s request, the Citizens Council agreed in 1960 to assume as a special project the successful integration of Dallas schools. The Council developed an extensive education campaign to facilitate the desegregation of Dallas schools by creating a climate to convince citizens of the need to accept desegregation peacefully.

Key steps included organizing a bi-racial Committee of 14 consisting of seven Black and seven white members to serve as a bridge between the two communities.  The Black membership included George Allen, Juanita Craft, Rev. Ernest Estell, and William J. Durham while the white members were predominantly CEOs of Dallas&#x27; largest businesses.

The Citizens Council produced &quot;Dallas at the Crossroads,&quot; a film narrated by Walter Cronkite that was shown throughout the city more than 1,000 times to community groups with introductions by leading citizens; distributed more than 100,000 booklets through churches; and many companies included inserts in employee paychecks. On September 6, 1961 racial desegregation came quietly and peacefully in Dallas, as 18 Black children entered first-grade classes in eight historically white elementary schools.

President Kennedy praised Dallas&#x27; peaceful school integration and acclaimed the city&#x27;s &quot;responsible, level-headed leadership,&quot; which had led the way. Roy Wilkins, executive director of the national NAACP, asserted, &quot;If this sort of thing had been done throughout the country – people willing to sit down together and talk about the problem – we would have a different picture now.&quot;

School desegregation progress followed a summer of peaceful business and city desegregation on a large scale without any public announcement. Lunch counters and hotels were successfully desegregated, &quot;White-only&quot; signs came down throughout the city, and at Fair Park open seating was initiated at the Dallas Summer Musicals and all carnival rides were opened to Black citizens. The peaceful Dallas school and business desegregation in 1961 was a stark contrast and nearly four years ahead of Gov. George Wallace&#x27;s order to break up protests in Selma, Alabama which led to Bloody Sunday on the Edmund Pettus Bridge.

=== The Klan ===
Dallas in the 1920s had one of the highest proportions of Klan membership of any U.S. city, just at the time Thornton was rising to prominence. Up to one in three eligible (white, Protestant) men in Dallas are believed to have joined in the early 1920s. Confirmed Dallas Klansmen included the sheriff, district attorney, police chief, commissioner of railways, ministers of the church, with several prominent Dallas businessmen also numbered in the ranks of the Dallas klavern. In 1994, in his book &quot;Big D: Triumphs and Troubles of an American Supercity in the 20th Century,&quot; Darwin Payne wrote: &quot;The president of Dallas County State Bank, Robert L. Thornton, [...] was a member [of the Ku Klux Klan]&quot;.

Following publication, Thornton&#x27;s family said the accusation was false. &quot;It was simply untrue,&quot; grandson Robert L. Thornton III wrote in a 1995 letter to the editor of the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot;. He said that not once in R. L. Thornton&#x27;s 83 years of life – including his thoroughly documented roles as a businessman, civic leader, and elected official – was there ever a single mention of a KKK membership. Moreover, for 30 years after his death in 1964, there was no public or known private suggestion or evidence that he was ever a member of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK).

According to the book&#x27;s author, Payne himself, he had a sole source for ascribing KKK membership to Thornton. Payne cites it in a footnote in the revised, 2000 edition of &quot;Big D&quot; as &quot;an undated document held by the Dallas Historical Society ... given by George B. Dealey in 1942&quot;. That document rested in the George B. Dealey archives at the Dallas Historical Society. It had been given to Dealey &quot;by Mr. Albert Brin of ... Dallas&quot; in 1942, some 20 years after the purported date of its creation.

The document was undated and unsigned, with no external verification. It was divided into three separate sections, two of which named 115 members of the Executive Committee and Steering Committee of the Klan at the time. There was a third section that listed about 270 businesses, labeled &quot;Ku Klux Klan Business Firms 100 %&quot;, under which the Dallas County State Bank was included, noting R.L. Thornton as president. There was no explanation as to what was meant by &quot;business firms 100%&quot;. Dealey, however, in his transmittal letter to the Dallas Historical Society wrote that it was an &quot;impossibility&quot; that &quot;the stores enumerated are said to be Ku Klux Klan 100%.&quot; The Klan itself noted: &quot;We do not claim that every 100% American is a Klansman.&quot; In a letter to Dallas real estate executive Henry S. Miller Jr after the publication of the 1994 edition, Payne acknowledged that Thornton was not listed on the individual member lists.  

There are two investigations from the 1920s into Klan participation in Dallas on record. The first was published by the &quot;Dallas Dispatch&quot; newspaper on May 12, 1922. &quot;Dallas Dispatch&quot; reporters were stationed at Fair Park for a large Dallas regional Klan meeting. They recorded and vetted license plates of the attendees&#x27; automobiles. The second was the 1923 Klan Day at the State Fair. This was billed as &quot;One of the Greatest Gatherings in Klan History&quot; with 160,000 attendees. Support was documented in the Klan Day souvenir program and in a 25-page detailed financial audit prepared by the Klan auditor, J.F. Collier, and his auditing firm Bell, Collier, &amp; Doyle. The firm&#x27;s &quot;Special Examination&quot; report of June 13, 1924 listed receipts, vendors, advertisers and individuals who provided support in exhaustive detail. Neither R. L. Thornton nor Dallas County State Bank were named in either listing.

A possible source of confusion may be that a younger brother of R.L. Thornton was indeed a member and leader of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s. W. L. Thornton, a Dallas attorney and prominent judge, was active in both the Klan and the Democratic party locally, statewide, and nationally.  Since the book&#x27;s 1994 publication, some authors and journalists have perpetuated the accusation that Thornton was a &quot;member of the Klan&quot;, by repeating Payne&#x27;s assertion, without any apparent separate investigation or research of their own.
== Family and legacy ==
On June 1, 1905, Thornton married Mary Metta Stiles (April 13, 1887 – March 25, 1975) of Waxahachie. Dallas became their home; they raised a family and lived there for the rest of their lives. Together they had three daughters and a son: Katherine Marie, who married J. Frank Holt; Rosemary, who married Ralph Brinegar. One daughter, Mary Ann, died in 1924, aged 3. 

Their son Robert L. Thornton Jr. (January 12, 1911 – September 24, 1992) was the founding chairman of the Dallas County Community College District (now Dallas College). He served on numerous boards including for Texas Woman&#x27;s University and Dallas Baptist College and was a chairman of the United Negro College Fund. The R.L. Thornton Jr. Building in Dallas was named in his honor by Dallas College. He was named chairman of Mercantile Bank in 1969.  

Their grandson, Robert L. Thornton III (born March 15, 1940), is a third-generation banker, having retired as vice chairman of JPMorgan Chase-Dallas. Thornton has been a trustee of The Nature Conservancy of Texas, a member of the University of Texas Press advisory board, a director of Southern Methodist University&#x27;s Cox School of Business, and chairman and director emeritus of the Dallas Arboretum. He is an officer of the Dallas College (formerly Dallas County Community College District) Foundation.

Father, son, and grandson, were all three honored with the Linz Award, Dallas&#x27; most distinguished civic award.

=== Death ===
Mayor Thornton died at his home on February 15, 1964, aged 83. At his memorial service, Dr. William Dickinson, pastor of the Highland Park United Methodist Church, concluded, &quot;His genius in leadership was seen not only in his limitless energy but in his ability to get other people to do things they did not know they could do. He not only built buildings and improved the appearance of a city, but more importantly, he helped men achieve their true stature.&quot;

<text>Robert &quot;Choc&quot; Thornton (born 14 July 1978 in Darlington) is a retired English National Hunt jockey.

Robert &quot;Chocolate&quot; Thornton (known as Choc) was one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s leading National Hunt jockeys. After growing up riding hunters with his father (a noted professional Huntsman) he started working for trainer David Nicholson in 1997 as an amateur and after immediate success became a Conditional jockey riding 71 winners during his first season in the sport. He won the Conditional Jockey&#x27;s title the following year.

After making his professional debut, Thornton’s performance was consistent, if unspectacular, and he consistently featured in the top 10 of the British Jumps Jockey Championship. Thornton’s most successful season was the 2007/2008-season, during which he broke the 100-winner barrier for the first time, by winning 105 of his 597 races.
Robert Thornton shies away from the spotlight and he did not talk to the television cameras until he spoke to his owners and trainer.

Robert Thornton’s greatest achievements are all linked to the Cheltenham Festival, at which he showed a knack for riding winners in major hurdles races. Thornton won his first Cheltenham Festival feature race in 2006, when he rode My Way de Solzen to victory in the World Hurdle.

Thornton has since won the Champion Hurdle and Triumph Hurdle. He also achieved good results in some of the Cheltenham Festival’s most prestigious chases, winning the Queen Mother Champion Chase on Voy Por Ustedes in 2007, and the Arkle Challenge Trophy in the same year. Thornton won the Top Jockey title at the Cheltenham Festival in 2007, by riding 4 winners during the meeting. In 2008 he rode three winners including a notable 1st day double. Thornton rode his 1,000th career winner on Araldur at Towcester on 28 March 2011.

He is unrelated to the jockey Andrew Thornton.

His worst moment in racing was when Strong Promise died in the 2000 Martel Cup at Liverpool.

<doc id="507266" wikidata="Q818557" url="?curid=507266" title="Observational astronomy">
<text>Observational astronomy is a division of astronomy that is concerned with recording data about the observable universe, in contrast with theoretical astronomy, which is mainly concerned with calculating the measurable implications of physical models. It is the practice and study of observing celestial objects with the use of telescopes and other astronomical instruments.

As a science, the study of astronomy is somewhat hindered in that direct experiments with the properties of the distant universe are not possible. However, this is partly compensated by the fact that astronomers have a vast number of visible examples of stellar phenomena that can be examined. This allows for observational data to be plotted on graphs, and general trends recorded. Nearby examples of specific phenomena, such as variable stars, can then be used to infer the behavior of more distant representatives. Those distant yardsticks can then be employed to measure other phenomena in that neighborhood, including the distance to a galaxy.

Galileo Galilei turned a telescope to the heavens and recorded what he saw. Since that time, observational astronomy has made steady advances with each improvement in telescope technology.

==Subdivisions of observational Astronomy==
A traditional division of observational astronomy is based on the region of the electromagnetic spectrum observed:
* Radio astronomy detects radiation of millimetre to decametre wavelength. The receivers are similar to those used in radio broadcast transmission but much more sensitive. See also Radio telescopes.
* Infrared astronomy deals with the detection and analysis of infrared radiation (this typically refers to wavelengths longer than the detection limit of silicon solid-state detectors, about 1 μm wavelength). The most common tool is the reflecting telescope, but with a detector sensitive to infrared wavelengths. Space telescopes are used at certain wavelengths where the atmosphere is opaque, or to eliminate noise (thermal radiation from the atmosphere).
* Optical astronomy is the part of astronomy that uses optical instruments (mirrors, lenses, and solid-state detectors) to observe light from near-infrared to near-ultraviolet wavelengths. Visible-light astronomy, using wavelengths detectable with the human eyes (about 400–700 nm), falls in the middle of this spectrum.
* High-energy astronomy includes X-ray astronomy, gamma-ray astronomy, and extreme UV astronomy.
*Occultation astronomy is the observation of the instant one celestial object occults or eclipses another. Multi-chord asteroid occultation observations measure the profile of the asteroid to the kilometre level.

=== Methods ===
In addition to using electromagnetic radiation, modern astrophysicists can also make observations using neutrinos, cosmic rays or gravitational waves. Observing a source using multiple methods is known as multi-messenger astronomy.

Optical and radio astronomy can be performed with ground-based observatories, because the atmosphere is relatively transparent at the wavelengths being detected. Observatories are usually located at high altitudes so as to minimise the absorption and distortion caused by the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Some wavelengths of infrared light are heavily absorbed by water vapor, so many infrared observatories are located in dry places at high altitude, or in space.

The atmosphere is opaque at the wavelengths used by X-ray astronomy, gamma-ray astronomy, UV astronomy and (except for a few wavelength &quot;windows&quot;) far infrared astronomy, so observations must be carried out mostly from balloons or space observatories. Powerful gamma rays can, however be detected by the large air showers they produce, and the study of cosmic rays is a rapidly expanding branch of astronomy.

=== Important factors ===
For much of the history of observational astronomy, almost all observation was performed in the visual spectrum with optical telescopes. While the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is relatively transparent in this portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, most telescope work is still dependent on seeing conditions and air transparency, and is generally restricted to the night time. The seeing conditions depend on the turbulence and thermal variations in the air. Locations that are frequently cloudy or suffer from atmospheric turbulence limit the resolution of observations. Likewise the presence of the full Moon can brighten up the sky with scattered light, hindering observation of faint objects.

For observation purposes, the optimal location for an optical telescope is undoubtedly in outer space. There the telescope can make observations without being affected by the atmosphere. However, at present it remains costly to lift telescopes into orbit. Thus the next best locations are certain mountain peaks that have a high number of cloudless days and generally possess good atmospheric conditions (with good seeing conditions). The peaks of the islands of Mauna Kea, Hawaii and La Palma possess these properties, as to a lesser extent do inland sites such as Llano de Chajnantor, Paranal, Cerro Tololo and La Silla in Chile. These observatory locations have attracted an assemblage of powerful telescopes, totalling many billion US dollars of investment.

The darkness of the night sky is an important factor in optical astronomy. With the size of cities and human populated areas ever expanding, the amount of artificial light at night has also increased. These artificial lights produce a diffuse background illumination that makes observation of faint astronomical features very difficult without special filters. In a few locations such as the state of Arizona and in the United Kingdom, this has led to campaigns for the reduction of light pollution. The use of hoods around street lights not only improves the amount of light directed toward the ground, but also helps reduce the light directed toward the sky.

Atmospheric effects (astronomical seeing) can severely hinder the resolution of a telescope. Without some means of correcting for the blurring effect of the shifting atmosphere, telescopes larger than about 15–20 cm in aperture can not achieve their theoretical resolution at visible wavelengths. As a result, the primary benefit of using very large telescopes has been the improved light-gathering capability, allowing very faint magnitudes to be observed. However the resolution handicap has begun to be overcome by adaptive optics, speckle imaging and interferometric imaging, as well as the use of space telescopes.

=== Measuring results ===
Astronomers have a number of observational tools that they can use to make measurements of the heavens. For objects that are relatively close to the Sun and Earth, direct and very precise position measurements can be made against a more distant (and thereby nearly stationary) background. Early observations of this nature were used to develop very precise orbital models of the various planets, and to determine their respective masses and gravitational perturbations. Such measurements led to the discovery of the planets Uranus, Neptune, and (indirectly) Pluto. They also resulted in an erroneous assumption of a fictional planet Vulcan within the orbit of Mercury (but the explanation of the precession of Mercury&#x27;s orbit by Einstein is considered one of the triumphs of his general relativity theory).

== Developments and diversity ==
In addition to examination of the universe in the optical spectrum, astronomers have increasingly been able to acquire information in other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The earliest such non-optical measurements were made of the thermal properties of the Sun. Instruments employed during a solar eclipse could be used to measure the radiation from the corona.

=== Radio astronomy ===
With the discovery of radio waves, radio astronomy began to emerge as a new discipline in astronomy. The long wavelengths of radio waves required much larger collecting dishes in order to make images with good resolution, and later led to the development of the multi-dish interferometer for making high-resolution aperture synthesis radio images (or &quot;radio maps&quot;). The development of the microwave horn receiver led to the discovery of the microwave background radiation associated with the Big Bang.

Radio astronomy has continued to expand its capabilities, even using radio astronomy satellites to produce interferometers with baselines much larger than the size of the Earth. However, the ever-expanding use of the radio spectrum for other uses is gradually drowning out the faint radio signals from the stars. For this reason, in the future radio astronomy might be performed from shielded locations, such as the far side of the Moon.

=== Late 20th-century developments ===
The last part of the twentieth century saw rapid technological advances in astronomical instrumentation. Optical telescopes were growing ever larger, and employing adaptive optics to partly negate atmospheric blurring. New telescopes were launched into space, and began observing the universe in the infrared, ultraviolet, x-ray, and gamma ray parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as observing cosmic rays. Interferometer arrays produced the first extremely high-resolution images using aperture synthesis at radio, infrared and optical wavelengths. Orbiting instruments such as the Hubble Space Telescope produced rapid advances in astronomical knowledge, acting as the workhorse for visible-light observations of faint objects. New space instruments under development are expected to directly observe planets around other stars, perhaps even some Earth-like worlds.

In addition to telescopes, astronomers have begun using other instruments to make observations.

=== Other instruments ===
Neutrino astronomy is the branch of astronomy that observes astronomical objects with neutrino detectors in special observatories, usually huge underground tanks. Nuclear reactions in stars and supernova explosions produce very large numbers of neutrinos, very few of which may be detected by a neutrino telescope. Neutrino astronomy is motivated by the possibility of observing processes that are inaccessible to optical telescopes, such as the Sun&#x27;s core.

Gravitational wave detectors are being designed that may capture events such as collisions of massive objects such as neutron stars or black holes.

Robotic spacecraft are also being increasingly used to make highly detailed observations of planets within the Solar System, so that the field of planetary science now has significant cross-over with the disciplines of geology and meteorology.

== Observation tools ==


=== Telescopes ===

The key instrument of nearly all modern observational astronomy is the telescope. This serves the dual purposes of gathering more light so that very faint objects can be observed, and magnifying the image so that small and distant objects can be observed. Optical astronomy requires telescopes that use optical components of great precision. Typical requirements for grinding and polishing a curved mirror, for example, require the surface to be within a fraction of a wavelength of light of a particular conic shape. Many modern &quot;telescopes&quot; actually consist of arrays of telescopes working together to provide higher resolution through aperture synthesis.

Large telescopes are housed in domes, both to protect them from the weather and to stabilize the environmental conditions. For example, if the temperature is different from one side of the telescope to the other, the shape of the structure changes, due to thermal expansion pushing optical elements out of position. This can affect the image. For this reason, the domes are usually bright white (titanium dioxide) or unpainted metal. Domes are often opened around sunset, long before observing can begin, so that air can circulate and bring the entire telescope to the same temperature as the surroundings. To prevent wind-buffet or other vibrations affecting observations, it is standard practice to mount the telescope on a concrete pier whose foundations are entirely separate from those of the surrounding dome and building.

To do almost any scientific work requires that telescopes track objects as they wheel across the visible sky. In other words, they must smoothly compensate for the rotation of the Earth. Until the advent of computer controlled drive mechanisms, the standard solution was some form of equatorial mount, and for small telescopes this is still the norm. However, this is a structurally poor design and becomes more and more cumbersome as the diameter and weight of the telescope increases. The world&#x27;s largest equatorial mounted telescope is the 200 inch (5.1 m) Hale Telescope, whereas recent 8–10 m telescopes use the structurally better altazimuth mount, and are actually physically &quot;smaller&quot; than the Hale, despite the larger mirrors. As of 2006, there are design projects underway for gigantic alt-az telescopes: the Thirty Metre Telescope , and the 100 m diameter Overwhelmingly Large Telescope.

Amateur astronomers use such instruments as the Newtonian reflector, the Refractor and the increasingly popular Maksutov telescope.

=== Photography ===
The photograph has served a critical role in observational astronomy for over a century, but in the last 30 years it has been largely replaced for imaging applications by digital sensors such as CCDs and CMOS chips. Specialist areas of astronomy such as photometry and interferometry have utilised electronic detectors for a much longer period of time. Astrophotography uses specialised photographic film (or usually a glass plate coated with photographic emulsion), but there are a number of drawbacks, particularly a low quantum efficiency, of the order of 3%, whereas CCDs can be tuned for a QE &gt;90% in a narrow band. Almost all modern telescope instruments are electronic arrays, and older telescopes have been either been retrofitted with these instruments or closed down. Glass plates are still used in some applications, such as surveying, because the resolution possible with a chemical film is much higher than any electronic detector yet constructed.

==== Advantages ====
Prior to the invention of photography, all astronomy was done with the naked eye. However, even before films became sensitive enough, scientific astronomy moved entirely to film, because of the overwhelming advantages:
* The human eye discards what it sees from split-second to split-second, but photographic film gathers more and more light for as long as the shutter is open.
* The resulting image is permanent, so many astronomers can use the same data.
* It is possible to see objects as they change over time (SN 1987A is a spectacular example).

==== Blink comparator ====
The blink comparator is an instrument that is used to compare two nearly identical photographs made of the same section of sky at different points in time. The comparator alternates illumination of the two plates, and any changes are revealed by blinking points or streaks. This instrument has been used to find asteroids, comets, and variable stars.
=== Micrometer ===
The position or cross-wire micrometer is an implement that has been used to measure double stars. This consists of a pair of fine, movable lines that can be moved together or apart. The telescope lens is lined up on the pair and oriented using position wires that lie at right angles to the star separation. The movable wires are then adjusted to match the two star positions. The separation of the stars is then read off the instrument, and their true separation determined based on the magnification of the instrument.

=== Spectrograph ===
A vital instrument of observational astronomy is the spectrograph. The absorption of specific wavelengths of light by elements allows specific properties of distant bodies to be observed. This capability has resulted in the discovery of the element of helium in the Sun&#x27;s emission spectrum, and has allowed astronomers to determine a great deal of information concerning distant stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies. Doppler shift (particularly &quot;redshift&quot;) of spectra can also be used to determine the radial motion or distance with respect to the Earth.

Early spectrographs employed banks of prisms that split light into a broad spectrum. Later the grating spectrograph was developed, which reduced the amount of light loss compared to prisms and provided higher spectral resolution. The spectrum can be photographed in a long exposure, allowing the spectrum of faint objects (such as distant galaxies) to be measured.

Stellar photometry came into use in 1861 as a means of measuring stellar colors. This technique measured the magnitude of a star at specific frequency ranges, allowing a determination of the overall color, and therefore temperature of a star. By 1951 an internationally standardized system of UBV-magnitudes (&quot;U&quot;ltraviolet-&quot;B&quot;lue-&quot;V&quot;isual) was adopted.

=== Photoelectric photometry ===
Photoelectric photometry using the CCD is now frequently used to make observations through a telescope. These sensitive instruments can record the image nearly down to the level of individual photons, and can be designed to view in parts of the spectrum that are invisible to the eye. The ability to record the arrival of small numbers of photons over a period of time can allow a degree of computer correction for atmospheric effects, sharpening up the image. Multiple digital images can also be combined to further enhance the image, often known as &quot;stacking&quot;. When combined with the adaptive optics technology, image quality can approach the theoretical resolution capability of the telescope.

Filters are used to view an object at particular frequencies or frequency ranges. Multilayer film filters can provide very precise control of the frequencies transmitted and blocked, so that, for example, objects can be viewed at a particular frequency emitted only by excited hydrogen atoms. Filters can also be used to partially compensate for the effects of light pollution by blocking out unwanted light. Polarization filters can also be used to determine if a source is emitting polarized light, and the orientation of the polarization.

== Observing ==
Astronomers observe a wide range of astronomical sources, including high-redshift galaxies, AGNs, the afterglow from the Big Bang and many different types of stars and protostars.

A variety of data can be observed for each object. The position coordinates locate the object on the sky using the techniques of spherical astronomy, and the magnitude determines its brightness as seen from the Earth. The relative brightness in different parts of the spectrum yields information about the temperature and physics of the object. Photographs of the spectra allow the chemistry of the object to be examined.

Parallax shifts of a star against the background can be used to determine the distance, out to a limit imposed by the resolution of the instrument. The radial velocity of the star and changes in its position over time (proper motion) can be used to measure its velocity relative to the Sun. Variations in the brightness of the star give evidence of instabilities in the star&#x27;s atmosphere, or else the presence of an occulting companion. The orbits of binary stars can be used to measure the relative masses of each companion, or the total mass of the system. Spectroscopic binaries can be found by observing doppler shifts in the spectrum of the star and its close companion.

Stars of identical masses that formed at the same time and under similar conditions typically have nearly identical observed properties. Observing a mass of closely associated stars, such as in a globular cluster, allows data to be assembled about the distribution of stellar types. These tables can then be used to infer the age of the association.

For distant galaxies and AGNs observations are made of the overall shape and properties of the galaxy, as well as the groupings where they are found. Observations of certain types of variable stars and supernovae of known luminosity, called standard candles, in other galaxies allows the inference of the distance to the host galaxy. The expansion of space causes the spectra of these galaxies to be shifted, depending on the distance, and modified by the Doppler effect of the galaxy&#x27;s radial velocity. Both the size of the galaxy and its redshift can be used to infer something about the distance of the galaxy. Observations of large numbers of galaxies are referred to as redshift surveys, and are used to model the evolution of galaxy forms.

<doc id="507267" wikidata="Q156439" url="?curid=507267" title="Reichenau Island">
<text>Reichenau Island () is an island in Lake Constance in Southern Germany. It lies almost due west of the city of Konstanz, between the Gnadensee and the Untersee, two parts of Lake Constance. With a total land surface of and a circumference of , the island is long and wide at its greatest extent. The highest point, the Hochwart, stands some above the lake surface and above mean sea level.

Reichenau is connected to the mainland by a causeway, completed in 1838, which is intersected between the ruins of Schopflen Castle and the eastern end of Reichenau Island by a and waterway, the Bruckgraben. A low road bridge allows the passage of ordinary boats but not of sailing-boats.

Reichenau Abbey, founded on the island by bishop Pirmin in 724, quickly developed into an influential religious, cultural, and intellectual center. Because of its historical importance and the exceptional quality of the architecture and artwork found in the island&#x27;s three churches and abbey, Reichenau was declared a World Heritage Site in 2000.

==History==
Although people occupied Reichenau in the Bronze Age and Iron Age, archeological evidence suggests that Reichenau was abandoned during the Roman era. It remained uninhabited until 724, when the monk Pirmin received support from the Carolingian ruler Charles Martel to build a monastery on the island. The first monastery, at Mittelzel, was wooden, although it was replaced by a stone building by 746. In the early 9th century, under the patronage of the Carolingian dynasty and Ottonian dynasty, the community flourished. In 816 the monastery church of the by-then abbey, was rebuilt in a cruciform basilica style, and churches dedicated to the Virgin and Saint Mark were consecrated. Relics of St. Mark arrived at the abbey in the mid-9th century. Two further churches were built on the island consecrated to Saints Peter and Paul (in 799) and to Saint George (in 896).

The abbey&#x27;s bailiff was housed in a two-storey stone building to which two more storeys of timber framing were added in the 14th century, one of the oldest timber-frame buildings in southern Germany. It is today used as a museum of local history.

The monastic community of the abbey produced several influential poets and authors, such as Walafrid Strabo (who served as abbot) and scholars such as Hermann of Reichenau and Abbot Reginbert, as well as artists. The famous artworks of Reichenau include (in the church of St George) the Ottonian murals of miracles of Christ, unique survivals from the 10th century. The Plan of St. Gall, the only surviving architectural drawing from the Middle Ages, may also have been created on the island. Among the abbey&#x27;s far-flung landholdings was Reichenau, a village on the upper Rhine in the municipality of Tamins in the canton of Graubünden, Switzerland, named for the abbey.

In the 16th century, the territory of the Prince-Bishopric of Constance was extended to include Reichenau, and as a result the influence of the abbey waned. During the secularization of the Prince-Bishopric of Constance in 1803, many of the smaller chapels on the island were demolished. In addition, the manuscripts and archives held in the abbey were given to Karlsruhe and the University of Heidelberg library and the surrounding farms were parceled and sold.

Today the island is also famous for its vegetable farms. The Wollmatinger Ried next to the island is a large nature reserve, a wetland area of reeds, which is used by many birds as a stopover during their annual migration.

==Transport==
 is a railway station on the High Rhine Railway line. It is served by regional trains to and , via .

Reichenau has a landing stage. Between spring and autumn, the URh offers regular boat services on the High Rhine and Untersee between Schaffhausen and Kreuzlingen, via Konstanz.

<doc id="507275" wikidata="Q6243002" url="?curid=507275" title="John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign">
<text>The 2004 presidential campaign of John Kerry, the longtime U.S. senator from Massachusetts, began when he formed an exploratory committee on December 1, 2002. On September 2, 2003, he formally announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination. After beating John Edwards, Howard Dean, Wesley Clark, and other candidates in the primaries, he became the Democratic nominee, challenging Republican incumbent George W. Bush in the general election. Kerry selected Edwards as his running mate.

Kerry conceded defeat in a telephone call to Bush at around 11 a.m. EST (16:00 UTC) on the morning of November 3, 2004. Had Kerry won, he would have been the first incumbent senator since John F. Kennedy to be elected president. Edwards would have been the first vice president from North Carolina. Kerry was the most recent Democratic presidential nominee to lose both the electoral vote and the popular vote until Kamala Harris in 2024 against Republican Donald Trump.

Edwards would run for president again in the 2008 Democratic primary, finishing third. That year&#x27;s Democratic nominee, Barack Obama, became the third senator elected president after Warren G. Harding and John F. Kennedy. After Obama&#x27;s reelection in 2012, he nominated Kerry as Secretary of State.

==Political positions==
===Economy and budget===
Kerry supported enhancing the Balanced Budget Act. In 1993, Kerry voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Kerry supported eliminating tax incentives for companies that move operations overseas and making efforts to reduce outsourcing.

Kerry was against funding cuts in Social Security benefits. He opposed privatizing Social Security accounts.

===Immigration===

Kerry supported cutting the Bureau for Citizenship and Immigration Services&#x27; application pending backlog and reducing the lag for the naturalization process. Kerry endorsed benefits to legal immigrants. Kerry supported the DREAM Act. Kerry supported the proposal of legalizing the status of illegal immigrants, pending a certain amount of working time in the US and passing a background check. Kerry proposed border enforcement reformation and an increase of border enforcement funding.

===Education and science===
Kerry voted for the No Child Left Behind Act and argues that it should be &quot;fully funded&quot; which would entail funding several programs up to authorized levels of funding. He proposed a new &quot;Education Trust Fund&quot; to require the federal government to fund programs up to their authorized levels. He also proposed a &quot;College Opportunity Tax Credit&quot; for &quot;economically vulnerable&quot; students.

Kerry promised to increase funding for scientific research, to reduce restrictions on stem cell research, and to facilitate cooperation with foreign scientists by improving immigration and visa practices. He said he would support efforts to reduce global warming.

===Law and justice===
As an assistant district attorney, Kerry personally prosecuted armed robbers, rapists, and mob bosses. He is in favor of putting resources in the community, backing the Community Oriented Policing System Act (COPS), and creating laws that lead to criminals being arrested and convicted. Kerry has advocated expanding the COPS program to place 100,000 police officers in community policing assignments. Kerry supports the Police Corps program. In the Senate, Kerry has advocated laws that punish drug dealers and money launderers.

====Death penalty====
Kerry has long stated his opposition to the death penalty, but has recently stated that he would support it in the case of convicted terrorists. He had previously opposed the death penalty for terrorists on the grounds that it would make it difficult to extradite suspects to the United States to stand trial. (Many nations refuse extradition requests, on humanitarian grounds, if the suspect faces execution.)

====Illegal drugs====
Kerry&#x27;s proposals to deal with illegal drugs include focusing on keeping drugs out of the country as well as reducing demand for illegal drugs. Kerry supports aggressively targeting traffickers and dealers. Kerry supports funding drug prevention and treatment programs.

====Guns====
Kerry is a gun owner and hunter. Kerry believes that law-abiding Americans should continue to have the right to own guns, but only guns that fall within the &quot;hunters and sportsmen&quot; paradigm. As he has voted in favour of various gun control measures, the NRA Political Victory Fund gave him an &quot;F&quot; rating in 2004, their lowest rating. In 2002, the pro-gun control Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence indicated that Kerry voted their preferred position 100% of the time.

As a senator, Kerry has supported:
*The Brady Bill and mandatory background checks
*Legislation to close the gun show loophole
*A ban on various types of semi-automatic firearms
*Mandatory gun locks

===Social issues===

====Abortion====
Kerry affiliates himself with pro-choice women&#x27;s organizations. Kerry is against the criminalization of abortion. In the Senate, Kerry consistently voted against bans on abortions conducted on military bases and military installations overseas, as well as against the ban on partial-birth abortion. He has been given a 0% rating from the National Right to Life Committee and a 100% rating from NARAL.

In an interview on July 4, 2004, Kerry told the Dubuque, Iowa, &quot;Telegraph Herald&quot; &quot;I oppose abortion, personally. I don&#x27;t like abortion. I believe life does begin at conception.&quot; &quot;I can&#x27;t take my Catholic belief, my article of faith, and legislate it on a Protestant or a Jew or an atheist,&quot; he continued in the interview. &quot;We have separation of church and state in the United States of America.&quot;
Archbishop Raymond Burke said that he would deny Kerry communion over his position on abortion. The issue led to comparisons between Kerry&#x27;s presidential campaign and that of John F. Kennedy in 1960. While Kennedy had to demonstrate his independence from the Roman Catholic Church due to public fear that a Catholic president would make decisions based on Vatican commands, it seemed that Kerry, in contrast, had to show obedience to Catholic authorities in order to win votes. According to Margaret Ross Sammons, Kerry&#x27;s campaign was sufficiently damaged by the threat to withhold communion that it may have cost him the election. Sammons argues that President George W. Bush was able to win 53% of the Catholic vote because he appealed to &quot;traditional&quot; Catholics.

====Gay rights====
Kerry is in favor of the acknowledgement and protection of civil rights for gay and lesbian Americans. John Kerry is an original cosponsor of the Hate Crimes Prevention bill and supports passage of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. He introduced a very early bill (1985) into the Senate to statutorily forbid sexual-orientation-based discrimination. Kerry cosponsored the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act (CARE) and also sponsored the Vaccines for the New Millennium Act.

Kerry supported same-sex civil unions, but opposed same-sex marriage. Kerry supported legislation to provide domestic partners of federal employees the benefits available to spouses of federal employees. Kerry voted against the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in the Senate in 1996 and opposes the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA). He and Senator Edwards were absent for the unsuccessful vote to invoke cloture on the FMA, a procedural move that the FMA&#x27;s proponents had conceded beforehand would be defeated. In an interview with National Public Radio in February 2004, Kerry endorsed equal rights for same-sex couples, but commented that &quot;the word marriage kind of gets in the way of the whole debate,&quot; because of the religious origin of marriage as being limited to male-female unions.

Kerry opposed the &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy. Since 1995, Human Rights Campaign, the nation&#x27;s largest gay-rights advocacy group, has given Kerry a 100% rating for his voting record in Congress.

====Affirmative action====
Kerry states that he supports affirmative action and diversity programs, a claim supported by his Senate voting record. He has, however, expressed reservations about affirmative action in the past, most notably in a 1992 speech in which he reportedly called the practice &quot;inherently limited and divisive,&quot; explaining that it &quot;has kept America thinking in racial terms.&quot; Kerry has also received some criticism from African Americans because his campaign inner circle was entirely white. Kerry also remarked on Bill Clinton&#x27;s close relationship with African Americans: &quot;President Clinton was often known as the first black president. I wouldn&#x27;t be upset if I could earn the right to be the second.&quot; Kerry&#x27;s remark was not well received by some blacks.

====National service====
Kerry supports supplementing national service in nearly all aspects of American life, including requiring community service for high school students to graduate, a &quot;Summer of Service&quot; for teenagers (essentially community service during summer breaks from school, with a U.S. $500 grant for college), increasing the Peace Corps to 25,000 members, requiring universities that receive Federal funding to offer a ROTC, and providing more funding for ROTC scholarships.

===Foreign policy===

====Iraq====
Kerry voted in support of the Senate resolution authorizing the President to use force against Saddam Hussein if he failed to surrender his weapons of mass destruction and related tools for constructing and distributing them. Kerry, in October 2002, declared his belief that &quot;Iraq has some lethal and incapacitating agents and is capable of quickly producing weaponizing of a variety of such agents, including anthrax, for delivery on a range of vehicles, such as bombs, missiles, aerial sprayers and covert operatives which would bring them to the United States itself.&quot; The National Intelligence Estimate, to which Kerry had access, held some skepticism of Iraq&#x27;s capability. Kerry&#x27;s vote to support the use of force in Iraq was given with strong stipulations that all other peaceful avenues be exhausted first, and that any action of force would be done in conjunction with a world coalition, and not just with the British. (Kerry&#x27;s full statement before casting his resolution vote)

After the President launched the U.S. invasion against Iraq, without meeting all of Kerry&#x27;s stipulation, Kerry reiterated his position and declared the administration&#x27;s Iraq policy reckless at best and baseless at worst. He has since been outspoken against the handling of the war and of the Bush administration&#x27;s stewardship of occupied Iraq, attacking what he calls poor planning and poor diplomacy on Bush&#x27;s part, but supports remaining in Iraq until the task of reconstruction and reconciliation is complete. He changed his position on WMDs by saying they were not enough to go to war with Iraq. (Kerry&#x27;s post-attack view on Iraq) This harmed Kerry&#x27;s campaign when he was perceived as a &quot;flip-flopper,&quot; changing his position to better suit what is popular. This perception was strengthened after a March 16, 2004, debate at Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia when Kerry made what would become one of the most famous lines of his campaign stating, &quot;I actually did vote for the 87 billion dollars, before I voted against it.&quot; The Bush campaign immediately seized on the comment, using the footage in television ads to illustrate its charge that Kerry flip-flops on issues, particularly the war in Iraq. &quot;Kerry Discusses $87 Billion Comment,&quot;

Kerry was criticized by Howard Dean and others for his position on the war, which was criticized as inconsistent. Kerry explained his vote authorizing force by claiming that he believed the Senate resolution was intended to be a diplomatic &quot;threat&quot; to Saddam Hussein and not a blank check for war. In the first of the 2004 United States presidential debates, Kerry argued that Saddam Hussein had posed a significant potential threat, but that President Bush was premature in going to war. Kerry stated that war should have been a last resort, after diplomatic pressure and efforts by United Nations weapons inspectors had been allowed to run their course.

Kerry and Bush sparred repeatedly over Kerry&#x27;s expression of his policy. Kerry maintained that he has &quot;one Iraq policy&quot;, while Bush claimed that Kerry has made major changes in his policy. The Bush campaign says that differences between one Kerry policy statement and another amount to &quot;flip-flops.&quot; The nonpartisan FactCheck stated that &quot;Kerry has never wavered from his support for giving Bush authority to use force in Iraq, nor has he changed his position that he, as President, would not have gone to war without greater international support.&quot;

====Multilateralism====
Kerry advocates involving NATO, troops from other countries and the United Nations in U.S.-led efforts to achieve the goals of a &quot;stable&quot; and &quot;democratic&quot; world. According to the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot;, Kerry said in 1970 that the United Nations should have approval over most of our foreign military operations. &quot;I&#x27;m an internationalist. I&#x27;d like to see our troops dispersed through the world only at the directive of the United Nations.&quot; He has since repudiated this 1970 position. Kerry says he has always believed the United States has the absolute right to defend itself.

Throughout his Senate career, Kerry was also a staunch critic of many foreign policy initiatives of Republican Presidents. He opposed and voted against the Gulf War in 1991, and opposed funding the Contras in Nicaragua and similar armed groups in Latin America.

Kerry was preferred by most US allies, according to a GlobeScan-PIPA poll, conducted during July and August 2004.

===Military===
Kerry sponsored the Code of Conduct of Arms Transfers Act, which would prohibit U.S. military assistance and arms transfers to undemocratic nations, human rights violators or armed aggressors. Kerry cosponsored an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization Bill that allows the military to transport families of soldiers wounded while on active duty.

Kerry detailed proposals for homeland security efforts include enlisting the National Guard and AmeriCorps, creating a community defense service, ensuring first defenders and first responders are equipped and ready, improving information technology, reforming domestic intelligence, implementing public health initiatives and improving infrastructure security.

Kerry and fellow Vietnam-era Navy veteran Senator John McCain (R-AZ) had worked together in the early 1990s on U.S. Senate Select POW/MIA Committee. McCain and Kerry later joined to urge President Clinton to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam, which led to normalized relations between the countries but engendered some angry reactions from those involved in the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue.

===Environment===
Kerry advocates the removal of toxins from communities, bolstering the Superfund cleanup program, and reducing sprawl and traffic congestion.

Proposals for &quot;Green and Clean Communities&quot; include a Toxics Task Force at the EPA, fighting air pollution, water pollution and fighting other environmental hazards. Kerry has proposed a &quot;Conservation Covenant.&quot; As part of the covenant, Kerry will extend the Endangered Species Act for the benefits of wildlife and habitat protection to public and private lands and reinvest public-land royalties back into land protection.

In 2002, Kerry was one of the leaders of the Senate filibuster that defeated the Bush administration&#x27;s proposal to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. Kerry wants to participate in the development of an international climate change strategy to address global warming.

In 1998, the League of Conservation Voters gave Kerry an award for having one of the best environmental voting records in the Senate over the previous five years. In 2004, the Sierra Club endorsed Kerry, the first time it had endorsed a presidential candidate before the party conventions.

===Health care===
Kerry proposed a comprehensive health care plan that was more extensive than that proposed by President Bush. Several estimates were made of the cost of his proposals. While the estimates varied, they all indicated that the funding requirements would be substantial.

==Campaign history==

===Campaign managers===
Early on, John Kerry&#x27;s campaign manager was Jim Jordan. However, Jordan was replaced by Mary Beth Cahill. Kerry also hired Bob Shrum as a campaign consultant. Cahill and Shrum were known for disagreeing on how the campaign should be run.

Kerry&#x27;s team of advisors included Robert Rubin on economic affairs and Gary Hart on foreign policy. James Johnson, a Washington businessman and democratic veteran, coordinated Kerry&#x27;s search for a running mate, eventually settling on John Edwards.

In sheer numbers, however, Kerry had fewer endorsements than Howard Dean, who was far ahead in the superdelegate race going into the Iowa caucuses in February 2004, although Kerry led the endorsement race in Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona, South Carolina, New Mexico and Nevada. Kerry&#x27;s main perceived weakness was in his neighboring state of New Hampshire and nearly all national polls. Most other states did not have updated polling numbers to give an accurate placing for the Kerry campaign before Iowa.

Heading into the primaries, Kerry&#x27;s campaign was largely seen as in trouble; the key factor enabling it to survive was Kerry&#x27;s mortgaging his own home and lending the money to his campaign. He also brought on the &quot;magical&quot; Michael Whouley who was Al Gore&#x27;s national field director and would later become the Democratic National Committee&#x27;s National Field Director for Kerry-Edwards. Whouley is widely credited with helping bring home the Iowa victory the same as he did in New Hampshire for Al Gore in 2000 against Bill Bradley.

The only notable labor union to endorse him early was the International Association of Fire Fighters; however, Kerry&#x27;s support quickly snowballed as he won caucuses and primaries. He received a historic endorsement by the United Farm Workers on February 1, 2004, in Phoenix, Arizona. This was the first time the UFW had endorsed a candidate in the primary since Robert Kennedy. He received the endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters prior to the New Hampshire primary, a first for that organization as well.

He also received the support of each of his former competitors as they lost primaries and dropped out of the race, beginning with Missouri representative Dick Gephardt. Plenty of other notable Democrats followed, as did many labor unions which had previously backed Gephardt or Dean or stayed out of the race entirely (he won the endorsement of the entire AFL–CIO just prior to his Super Tuesday showdown with Edwards).

Becoming the nominee, he gained the support of virtually every Democratic politician and organization in the nation. Two notable exceptions were retiring Georgia Senator Zell Miller, a conservative Democrat, and Ed Koch, the former three-term mayor of New York City, both of whom endorsed George W. Bush. All of the former candidates for the nomination endorsed Kerry.

On September 29, John Eisenhower, the son of the former Republican president Dwight D. Eisenhower, endorsed Kerry in the &quot;New Hampshire Union Leader&quot; newspaper, saying that the Republican Party of today &quot;is one with which I am totally unfamiliar&quot;. Ron Reagan, son of former President Ronald Reagan, endorsed Kerry, saying that Bush had hijacked his father&#x27;s real legacy for extremist purposes, and spoke at the Democratic National Convention. Ron Reagan Jr. had a history of opposing his father&#x27;s policies while President Reagan was in office. Furthermore, Michael Reagan, President Reagan&#x27;s son from his first marriage, endorsed President Bush. The Senator also gained the endorsement of Marlow Cook, the former Republican Senator from Kentucky.

Ralph Nader&#x27;s running mate in the 1996 and 2000 elections, Native American activist Winona LaDuke, refused to support him in 2004. Instead, she stated: &quot;I am voting for John Kerry this November. I love this land, and I know that we need to make drastic changes in Washington if we are going to protect our land and our communities.&quot;

Former Governors of Maine and Minnesota Angus King and Jesse Ventura, respectively, endorsed Kerry in October 2004. Kerry also gained support from political activist Lyndon LaRouche.

===Campaign controversies===

====Ted Sampley====
In 2004, Vietnam veteran Ted Sampley claimed Kerry gave him the finger in front of photographers at the Vietnam memorial. Rush Limbaugh, in conjunction with his broadcast on the matter, posted a doctored photo of the incident on his website, but stated that the Newsmax report that made the claim was his only source.

====Swift Boat Veterans for Truth====
Early in the 2004 presidential election campaign an organization known as Swift Boat Veterans for Truth was established to challenge John Kerry&#x27;s bid for the presidency.

The group, led by Vietnam veteran John O&#x27;Neill, claimed that Kerry was &quot;unfit to serve,&quot; based on various cited anecdotes regarding his wartime conduct, but also focused on his past activism in the anti-Vietnam war movement. While Kerry had criticized the government&#x27;s highly unpopular war policy, the SBVT group claimed that his criticism was a &quot;betrayal of trust&quot; with other soldiers, and that by his activism he had caused direct and inexcusable &quot;harm&quot; to soldiers still at war. (See John Kerry military service controversy.)

Many believe that the organization&#x27;s accusations coupled with the Kerry campaign&#x27;s slow reaction to them were a significant factor in Kerry&#x27;s November defeat. In addition, Kerry&#x27;s first line from his acceptance speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention was, &quot;I&#x27;m John Kerry, and I&#x27;m reporting for duty.&quot; Critics have argued that this line was inept and that Kerry&#x27;s emphasis on his Vietnam experience opened the door to the Swiftboat attacks and shifted the national debate towards foreign policy issues, which were Bush&#x27;s strengths, rather than the economic issues on which Democrats could have had more campaign success.

===Running mate selection===

Kerry&#x27;s campaign began the process of searching for a vice-presidential nominee, sometimes called the &quot;Veepstakes&quot;, shortly after Kerry&#x27;s Super Tuesday victories. Kerry named Jim Johnson, former advisor to Vice President Walter F. &quot;Fritz&quot; Mondale, as the head of a vice-presidential search process.

One of the major criteria considered to be a factor in selecting a vice-presidential candidate was the ability to deliver a traditionally Republican or a swing state in the November election. Every successful Democratic presidential campaign since 1960 had included a politician from a swing state (usually in the South) who helped deliver one or more states for the Democrats.

By the first week of July 2004, pundits and those close to the Kerry campaign indicated that the vice-presidential selection had narrowed to five potential choices: U.S. Sen. John R. Edwards (N.C.), Ret. General Wesley K. Clark (Ar.), U.S. Rep. Richard A. &quot;Dick&quot; Gephardt (Mo.), U.S. Sen. Bob Graham (Fl.), and Iowa Gov. Thomas J. Vilsack, all of whom were reportedly instructed to clear their calendars for a potential announcement during the second week of July. Edwards, from North Carolina, Graham, from Florida, and Clark from Arkansas all were Southerners; the other two, from Missouri and Iowa respectively, are Midwesterners (the Midwest is viewed as a key region containing numerous swing states). As of late June, the charismatic Edwards was the first choice of Democratic voters, according to several polls; some pundits attributed this to high name recognition, due to his runner-up status in the primaries.

On the morning of July 6, 2004, Kerry announced the selection of John Edwards as his running mate. However, at 10 p.m. on the night before the official announcement, the information was leaked by an airport worker who saw Edwards&#x27;s name being painted on Kerry&#x27;s plane, which was to be used to announce his choice of running mate. On July 6, the Kerry campaign sent an e-mail message to his supporters at about 8:15 a.m. EDT informing them of the choice, and made the formal announcement for 9 a.m. EDT in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Kerry and Edwards were previously considered as potential running mates for Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore in the 2000 election, however Gore later chose Senator Joe Lieberman from Connecticut for the ticket.

===Democratic Convention===

At the Democratic National Convention in Boston from July 26 to 29, 2004, Kerry made his Vietnam War experience a prominent theme. In accepting the nomination, he began his speech with, &quot;I&#x27;m John Kerry and I&#x27;m reporting for duty.&quot;

Following his official nomination at the convention, Kerry received only a small bounce in the polls and remained effectively tied with his opponent, Bush. This was the first time in recent political history that a candidate failed to receive a substantial boost in post-convention poll numbers. Some political pundits attributed this small boost to the unusually small number of undecided voters as compared with previous presidential elections.

===Debates===

On March 13, while at a speaking engagement in Quincy, Illinois site of one of the historic Lincoln-Douglas debates, Kerry challenged Bush to a series of monthly debates. The Bush campaign declined the challenge.

On September 20, the Bush campaign and the Kerry campaign jointly released a memorandum of understanding between the two campaigns. The 32-page MOU covered in minute detail many aspects of the staging and format for the presidential and vice-presidential debates.

On September 30, Kerry and Bush debated at University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida in the first of three scheduled debates. This debate focused on foreign policy issues. Polls conducted immediately following the debate suggests that a majority of undecided voters believe that Kerry fared better than Bush did.

On October 8, Kerry and Bush debated at Washington University in St. Louis in a town-hall style debate, with the questions asked by the audience of undecided voters. Polls were split as to who won this debate, as Bush&#x27;s performance was greatly improved.

On October 13, Kerry and Bush debated at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. The focus of this debate was domestic policy issues. Again, polls were split, but more indicated a win for Kerry than Bush.

Additionally, on October 5, the vice presidential candidates Senator John Edwards and Vice President Dick Cheney engaged in a debate at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.

====Campaign spending====
Kerry took public funds to finance his campaign, agreeing to a $74.6 million limit.

==Views of Kerry==
Some of Kerry&#x27;s popular support came from &quot;Anybody but Bush&quot; voters - those who voted for him as a repudiation of the Bush administration&#x27;s policies. One of the major focuses of his campaign was to attract voters to his stances on the issues, instead of as a &quot;de facto&quot; opponent of the President.

The official Kerry for President website declares:

John has a bold, new vision for America. An America safe from foreign threats and greedy special interests. John has the experience and plans to lead America to better jobs, quality health care, energy that is clean, renewable, and independent, and greater opportunities for our children.

The &quot;Kansas City Star&quot; endorsed Kerry before the Missouri primary and wrote of him:

Kerry has the right combination of intelligence, experience and thoughtful, progressive views for the job. His military record—he received both a Bronze Star and a Silver Star for acts of bravery in Vietnam—as well as his defense and foreign policy expertise clearly make him the best qualified Democrat to lead the nation in the continuing fight against our adversaries abroad...Kerry has decades of public service that are available for scrutiny and review. It is an excellent record, one that contains abundant evidence of the senator&#x27;s commitment to the country and its better impulses.

The &quot;Chattanooga Times Free Press&quot; endorsed Kerry before the Tennessee Democratic primary and editorialized:

If Mr. Kerry is, by contrast [to Mr. Bush], a &#x27;liberal,&#x27; at least his policies make sense and would benefit all Americans. He has supported the sort of responsible domestic policies that boost education, support job creation and improve health care for all. With his personal war experience and deep background in foreign policy, he would exercise sound diplomacy in foreign affairs.

The &quot;Washington Post&quot; had this editorial comment on Kerry&#x27;s approaching front-runner status:

In an appearance in Milwaukee, fellow candidate and political rival Howard Dean stated, &quot;When you act like Senator Kerry does, he appears to be more like George Bush than he does like a Democrat.&quot;

Critics of Kerry cite Associated Press reports that Kerry made efforts to keep loopholes for special interests. One loophole allowed American International Group to profit from liability insurance coverage it provided for the &quot;Big Dig&quot; project in Boston. AIG later provided the funds for Kerry&#x27;s trip to Vermont and donated $30,000 (or more) to a group used to set up Kerry&#x27;s presidential campaign (Company executives also donated $18,000 to his campaigns). Charles Lewis, head of the Center for Public Integrity, stated that &quot;the idea that Kerry has not helped or benefited from a specific special interest, which he has said, is utterly absurd.&quot; Kerry has denied any connection between his assistance to AIG and its contributions to his campaign.

Kerry was in favor of free markets, free trade, and fiscal prudence. The Americans for Democratic Action, a prominent liberal organization, rates Kerry&#x27;s voting record better than that of Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA), causing Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie to joke, &quot;Who would have guessed it? Ted Kennedy is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.&quot; (Kerry got a 93% from the ADA, Kennedy an 88%.)

On June 21, 2004, 48 Nobel laureates endorsed Kerry as they thought that he would increase the prosperity, health, environment, and security of Americans, attract talented scientists and engineers from abroad; and nurture a business environment that creates quality jobs. They criticized the Bush administration for reducing funding for scientific research, setting restrictions on stem cell research, ignoring scientific consensus on critical issues such as global warming, and hampering cooperation with foreign scientists by employing deterring immigration and visa practices.

A poll conducted in July and August 2004 showed that of citizens of 35 countries, 30 preferred Kerry over Bush. Only Nigeria, the Philippines and Poland preferred Bush. India and Thailand were divided. US Allies such as the UK (47% Kerry to 16% Bush), Germany (74% Kerry to 10% Bush), Spain (45% to 7%), Italy (58% to 14%), Japan (43% to 23%) were all in favor of Kerry. Other countries such as Mexico (38% to 18%), Colombia (47% to 26%), China (52% to 12%) and South-Africa (43% to 29%) were in favor of Kerry as well.

==Campaign slogans==

Kerry&#x27;s campaign used many slogans to describe his run for the presidency:
* &quot;A stronger America begins at home.&quot;
* &quot;A safer, stronger, more secure America.&quot;
* &quot;The real deal&quot; — often printed on circular campaign gear as shown on the right
* &quot;The courage to do what&#x27;s right for America&quot;
* &quot;Together, we can build a stronger America&quot;
* &quot;A lifetime of service and strength&quot;
* &quot;Let America be America again&quot; — the title of a poem by Langston Hughes
* &quot;A new team, for a new America&quot;
* &quot;Stronger at home, respected in the world&quot;
* &quot;America deserves better&quot;
* &quot;Let us make one America&quot; — from Edwards&#x27; former presidential campaign
* &quot;Hope is on the way!&quot; — chanted by Edwards and his supporters during his speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention
* &quot;Help is on the way!&quot; — chanted by Kerry and his supporters during his speech as the 2004 Democratic National Convention

==Transition planning==

A presidential transition was contingently planned from Bush to Kerry. Prior to the election, Kerry and his senior advisors began discussing details for a potential presidential transition should he defeat President Bush, but the discussions were kept low-key. By late-October, it was reported by the Associated Press that aides to Kerry had anonymously told them that the transition process was behind schedule, but had still offered assurances that Kerry would be prepared to name his national security team soon after the election. With ongoing war, Kerry believed that it would be necessary to put such a team in place quickly during a transition after the election. On October 19, it was announced that Jim Johnson, who had led the search for Kerry&#x27;s running mate, and David McKean would officially lead the transition effort.

<doc id="507276" wikidata="Q4997821" url="?curid=507276" title="Bunnicula">
<text>Bunnicula is a children&#x27;s novel series. The first installment was written by James and Deborah Howe, and introduced a vampire rabbit named Bunnicula who sucks the juice out of vegetables. Deborah died in June 1978, before the first book was printed and James continued the project alone. The series consists of seven books, published between 1979 and 2006.

== Characters ==

=== Bunnicula ===
The titular character is a harmless rabbit with unusual eating habits and minor vampiric qualities. Toby, a member of the Monroe family, found the rabbit in a theater while the film &quot;Dracula&quot; was screening. Bunnicula is subjected to many murder attempts by Chester. The authors never produced an actual origin for him or his abilities, nor did they ever explicitly confirm or deny that Bunnicula was a vampire.

=== Harold ===
Harold is an old, scruffy and loving dog under the Monroe&#x27;s care who narrates the books.

=== Chester ===
The highly imaginative, prideful orange tabby cat who loves good literature and milk. Ever since Bunnicula&#x27;s arrival, Chester becomes increasingly jealous and convinced that the bunny could be a threat, though by the end he becomes friends with Bunnicula. Chester is often paranoid.

=== Howie ===
The carefree and sometimes slightly dim Dachshund puppy who was adopted by the Monroes from Chateau Bow-Wow. He views Chester as his father.

=== Peter &quot;Pete&quot; Monroe ===
The oldest of two boys who slacks off often. He often bullies his younger brother Toby and the pets, except for Bunnicula.

=== Toby Monroe ===
The younger of two boys who is kinder than Pete. He likes to share his snacks with Harold during his late-night readings and is adored by Harold, Chester, Bunnicula, and Howie. Toby&#x27;s family adopted Bunnicula after the family brought him home.

==Series plot==
The story focuses on the Monroe family and their pets, but is told from the perspective of their dog Harold. Bunnicula is the family&#x27;s pet rabbit which the Monroes found at a theater during a showing of the film &quot;Dracula&quot;.

=== &quot;Bunnicula: A Rabbit-Tale of Mystery (1979)&quot; ===
=== &quot;Howliday Inn (1982)&quot; ===
When the Monroe family decides to leave for a vacation, they send Harold and Chester off to a kennel called Chateau Bow-Wow, where they meet the other inhabitants of the kennel, including a poodle named Louise and two Dachshunds named Heather and Howard. The owner of the kennel, Dr. Greenbriar, takes the week off and the other staff, Jill and Harrison, are overworked. Louise goes missing and Chester becomes convinced that foul play was involved before he vanishes as well. Upon returning, he leads the other animals to find Harrison trying to capture Heather and Howard. Chester tells Harold later that Harrison caught wind that one of the animals in the shelter was very valuable. He kidnapped Louise and then Chester, thinking that it could have been one of them. It is revealed that it was the Dachshunds, who are rare wire-haired Dachshunds. When the Monroe family returns from their vacation, they reveal that they are adopting the runt of the Dachshund litter, who they name Howie.

=== &quot;The Celery Stalks at Midnight (1983)&quot; ===
Bunnicula has gone missing and Chester begins to fear for the town again. He believes that the vegetables that Bunnicula sucks dry could return as the rabbit&#x27;s vampire slaves to use as an army to take over the town. He, Harold, and Howie set off to search the neighborhood. They witness Toby and Pete wearing dark robes and holding a group of frightened children prisoner. The pets fear that Bunnicula has begun to control people and run to the nearby school. After causing much mayhem they are caught by the Monroes. It is revealed that there was a carnival at the school that day and Toby, Pete and the other children were rehearsing for a play they were going to put on. Bunnicula is discovered to have been entered in the pet show at school. The title is a reference to the 1951 animated film of the same name by John Whitney. 

=== &quot;Nighty Nightmare (1987)&quot; ===
Mr. Monroe has a mid-life crisis and wants to do something exciting while he is at his lakeside retreat of Boggy Lake while fishing with Harold, Chester, and Howie. He decides to go camping out in the woods. They meet two men, Bud and Spud, and their dog Dawg. That night, they go out for a walk, and Dawg leads Harold, Chester, and Howie away from his masters and the Monroes to show them something &quot;neat&quot;, getting them lost in the woods. Chester begins to suspect that Bud and Spud are planning to murder the Monroes and that Dawg is luring them away to keep them from interfering. Once they reach a house right in the middle of the woods, Chester tells a story about Bunnicula&#x27;s origin in an attempt to lull Dawg to sleep and allow himself, Harold, and Howie to escape. While the plan is successful, Harold, Howie, and Chester fall asleep along with Dawg, and awaken shortly before dawn. After they return to the Monroes&#x27; camp, only to find it trashed and deserted, Dawg reveals that the house they visited is his own. The Monroes also stayed the night with them to avoid the rain, and are relieved that Harold, Howie, and Chester are unharmed.

=== &quot;Return to Howliday Inn (1992)&quot; ===
The Monroe family leaves Harold, Chester, and Howie at Chateau Bow-Wow again. The pets quickly notice differences, including a new group of animals staying there, including a sad Great Dane named Hamlet. The three Monroe pets learn that Hamlet&#x27;s old owner left him there a long time ago. Chester finds his owner&#x27;s new address and they leave the chateau to escort Hamlet there. The new address turns out to be a nursing home that does not allow animals. Hamlet finds his old owner, and it is revealed that the owner was a ventriloquist. Using ventriloquism, the pets and patients convince the staff of the nursing home to allow Hamlet to stay. When Harold, Chester, and Howie are picked up at the end, they fool the Monroes with the ventriloquism tricks they learned.

=== &quot;Bunnicula Strikes Again! (1999)&quot; ===
Chester suspects again that Bunnicula is a threatening vampire and starts drinking the rabbit&#x27;s juice in the daytime so Bunnicula will die of starvation. One night, Harold notices Bunnicula crying while singing him a lullaby. Chester thinks he misses his mother, and in the next few days, he leads the two dogs to search for her to no luck. When Bunnicula becomes increasingly ill, he is taken to the veterinarian. Chester escapes, and both he and Bunnicula are crushed under rubble. Harold and Howie manage to alert the Monroes who dig through the rubble and find them both unharmed. Chester finally accepts Bunnicula.

=== &quot;Bunnicula Meets Edgar Allan Crow (2006)&quot; ===
Pete writes to the author of his (and Howie&#x27;s) favorite series, FleshCrawlers. He visits the Monroe household and stays in the guestroom, bringing with him his favorite pet crow, Edgar Allan Crow. Everyone is thrilled, except for Chester, who insists that the author, M.T. Graves, is suspicious. Harold and Howie are not convinced, but Chester is convinced that there is a secret society among the crows and Edgar is a messenger sent to help Graves transform Bunnicula into a bat. When Bunnicula escapes, the entire party chases after him, and Harold and Howie begin to think that Chester may have been right. M.T. Graves is very careful about a black bag, and when Bunnicula is not found, Chester believes he is trapped in the bag. Harold dumps the bag, only to discover it is filled with stuffed animals. M.T. Graves tells them that he stayed at the Monroes&#x27; house so that he could conquer his phobia of animals.

== Spin-offs==
Following the end of the &quot;Bunnicula&quot; series, James wrote a spin-off series called &quot;Tales from the House of Bunnicula&quot;, which is &quot;written&quot; by Howie, the Dachshund puppy who was introduced into the series in &quot;Howliday Inn&quot;. The &quot;Bunnicula and Friends: Ready to Read&quot; series contains six picture books about the adventures of the characters, and is aimed at beginner readers.

== Adaptations ==
A 1982 animated TV special (from Ruby-Spears) by the same name was created based on the first book and aired on the &quot;ABC Weekend Special&quot;.

An animated series loosely adapted from the book series began airing on Cartoon Network and on Boomerang on 6 February 2016.

A stage adaptation based on the books was written by Jon Klein and performed by the B Street Theatre in Sacramento, California. An additional stage adaptation was created for a children&#x27;s theatre at the DR2 Theatre in New York, adapted by writer Charles Busch.

In 2022, &quot;Bunnicula: The Graphic Novel&quot;, an adaptation of the first book in the series by Andrew Donkin and art by Stephen Gilpin was released.

<text>4 Times Square (also known as 151 West 42nd Street or One Five One; formerly the Condé Nast Building) is a 48-story skyscraper at Times Square in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. Located at 1472 Broadway, between 42nd and 43rd Streets, the building measures tall to its roof and tall to its antenna. The building was designed by Fox &amp; Fowle and developed by the Durst Organization. 4 Times Square, and the Bank of America Tower to the east, occupy an entire city block.

Fox &amp; Fowle planned a masonry facade facing south and east, as well as a glass facade facing west and north. The northwest corner of the building&#x27;s base contains the eight-story cylindrical facade of Nasdaq MarketSite, which includes a large LED sign. The top of 4 Times Square includes an antenna mast and four large illuminated signs on each side which read ‘H&amp;M’. The building contains of floor space, much of which was originally taken by publishing company Condé Nast and law firm Skadden Arps. The lowest three stories contain retail space while the fourth story has a food hall for tenants, originally designed by Frank Gehry for Condé Nast. 4 Times Square is an early example of green design in commercial skyscrapers in the United States.

During the 1980s and early 1990s, Park Tower Realty and the Prudential Insurance Company of America had planned to develop a tower for the site as part of a wide-ranging redevelopment of West 42nd Street. After long opposing a tower there, Douglas Durst proposed an office building on the site in late 1995. Condé Nast and Skadden Arps leased the majority of the building in 1996, and the structure was finished in 1999. After Condé Nast and Skadden Arps moved out of the building during the 2010s, a variety of office tenants have occupied 4 Times Square. Several modifications have been made to the building after it opened, including an expansion of the antenna mast atop the building in 2003, as well as a renovation in the late 2010s.

== Site ==
4 Times Square is on the eastern side of Broadway, between 42nd Street and 43rd Street, at the southern end of Times Square in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. The land lot is trapezoidal and covers . The site has a frontage of on Broadway and a depth of .

4 Times Square, as well as the Bank of America Tower and Stephen Sondheim Theatre to the east, comprise the entire city block. Other nearby locations include the Town Hall theater and the Chatwal New York hotel to the northeast, 1500 Broadway to the north, 1501 Broadway to the northwest, One Times Square and 3 Times Square to the west, Times Square Tower and 5 Times Square to the southwest, and the Knickerbocker Hotel and Bush Tower to the south. An entrance to the New York City Subway&#x27;s Times Square–42nd Street station, served by the , is across 42nd Street. There is also an entrance to the 42nd Street–Bryant Park/Fifth Avenue station, served by the , less than a block east.

3, 4, and 5 Times Square and the Times Square Tower comprise a grouping of office buildings that were developed at Times Square&#x27;s southern end in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The northern portion of 4 Times Square&#x27;s site had been occupied by George M. Cohan&#x27;s Theatre and the Fitzgerald Building before 1938, then by the Big Apple Theatre and a Nathan&#x27;s Famous. The southern portion of the site had contained the Longacre Building. The Nathan&#x27;s space was originally a Toffenetti&#x27;s restaurant, which opened in 1940. Designed by Walker &amp; Gillette, the Toffenetti&#x27;s restaurant had 1,000 seats; the Nathan&#x27;s opened in the Toffenetti&#x27;s building in 1968.

==Architecture==
The building was designed by Fox &amp; Fowle and developed by the Durst Organization. WSP Cantor Seinuk was the structural engineer, while Tishman Construction was the main contractor. Other companies involved with the project included wind consultant CPP Wind Engineering and Air Quality Consultants, elevator contractor Otis Worldwide, mechanical engineer Cosentini Associates, photovoltaic contractor Kiss + Cathcart Architects, lighting contractor Fisher Marantz Renfro Stone, and cladding contractor Heitmann &amp; Associates. The New York City Economic Development Corporation owns the structure.

4 Times Square has 48 usable floors above ground, as well as two basement floors. Including mechanical stories atop the building, 4 Times Square is 52 stories tall. The building measures to its architectural tip and to the top of the antenna mast. The main roof is only high.

4 Times Square is one of the first examples of green design in commercial skyscrapers in the United States. The design incorporates many environmentally efficient features. In particular, Fox &amp; Fowle had been chosen for its experience designing ecologically sustainable buildings. One of the building&#x27;s original major tenants, publisher Condé Nast, had committed to designing its space to environmentally efficient standards (the other major tenant, law firm Skadden Arps, did not make a similar commitment). The building&#x27;s high energy usage limits the extent of the energy savings; Suzanne Stephens wrote for &quot;Architectural Record&quot; that the inclusion of such features was &quot;a little like opening up a smoke-enders clinic on a tobacco farm&quot;.

=== Form ===
The building is part of the 42nd Street Development Project and, thus, could bypass many city zoning rules such as those relating to floor area ratio (FAR). Bruce Fowle of Fox &amp; Fowle estimated that the building had a FAR of 35, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that the FAR was only 31. The massing of the building contains several setbacks, which were not mandated by zoning ordinances but were included to make the building&#x27;s design fit in with its setting. The 43rd story contains a glass setback with a cavetto-shaped cornice. Stephens wrote that the building contained a combination of neo-Modernist and traditional design elements. While the building is divided into a base, shaft, and pinnacle similar to older skyscrapers, the design of the facade was more varied.

==== Antenna mast ====
If the building&#x27;s antenna mast is included, the structure&#x27;s total height is . The original antenna mast measured and was built primarily for Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia, Inc.) as a backup transmitter site. After the broadcast equipment atop the World Trade Center&#x27;s towers was destroyed during the September 11 attacks in 2001, the main transmitters for radio stations WKTU, WNYC-FM, and WPAT-FM and the backup transmitter for WSKQ-FM were transferred to 4 Times Square. In 2003, the original installation was replaced with a mast. This allowed WKTU, WNYC-FM, and WPAT-FM to build main transmitters at the Empire State Building without disrupting existing FM tenants there. The topmost antenna, designed for Univision&#x27;s WFUT-TV, was removed in 2015 and replaced with a very high frequency (VHF) antenna for television station WJLP, bringing the mast to tall.

The mast includes five antennas. The topmost one is used by WJLP. The second-highest tier contains two antennas for ultra high frequency (UHF) broadcasts; the antenna serving UHF channels 40–60 is above that serving channels 24–45. Below that are two antennas for VHF broadcasts: one for low-VHF broadcasts and the other for FM radio stations. The antenna systems and mast were constructed by Andrew Corporation, Dielectric Communications, Shively Labs, and Electronics Research Inc. , the mast at 4 Times Square is used as a primary site by FM radio stations WBGO, WKCR, WNYE, and WBAI. In addition, the mast has been used as a backup site for FM stations such as WKTU, WNYC, WPAT, WSKQ, WHTZ, WAXQ, WWPR, WLTW, and WCAA.

=== Facade ===

Fox &amp; Fowle planned a masonry facade, largely oriented south toward 42nd Street and east toward Bryant Park, as well as a glass facade, largely facing west toward Broadway and north toward 43rd Street. The arrangement was meant to fit in with the livelier character of Broadway and the more restrained character of 42nd Street and Bryant Park. This led multiple media sources to compare the facade to the two-faced god Janus. In general, the lower stories have low-reflective glass to increase transparency, while the upper stories have highly reflective glass that deflects heat.

The masonry facade wraps around much of the north, east, and south elevations. In a 1996 press release, Fox &amp; Fowle described the character of the masonry facade as presenting &quot;a more composed personality appropriate to the context of Midtown Manhattan&quot;. The offices are accessed from an entrance on 42nd Street, which is named One Five One after its street address of 151 West 42nd Street. The main entrance has a recessed glass wall and originally had an angled glass canopy, which complemented the curving ceiling of the lobby. The entrance originally contained glass doors and was flanked by stone blocks. The masonry facade has windows measuring , larger than in typical office buildings. The large windows were meant to reduce the amount of electricity required for illuminating the offices.

The glass facade, which wraps around the west elevation and part of the south elevation, is designed to blend in with the surrounding signage. The glass facade contains green panels and is divided by vertical steel mullions. The west elevation on Broadway was designed with video screens, which cover and are mandated by the zoning law. There are ten signs, which could be rented to advertisers; when the building was constructed, the signs were projected to earn $7 million per year. The signs were included as part of Robert A. M. Stern&#x27;s 42nd Street Now! master plan, which required a variety of lighting and signage for facades along Times Square.

The 37th through 43rd stories of the south and east elevations have photovoltaic (PV) panels. These were installed in place of some of the spandrels that separate windows on different floors. There are 208 panels covering , half a percent of the facade&#x27;s total area. While the panels can generate enough power for five or six houses, they only supply one-half of a percent of the total power needs of 4 Times Square. The PV modules are placed on a thin glass pane that is then laminated on both sides. The PV panels were included because they were inconspicuous and only cost more than conventional spandrels. Originally, the architects had planned for of PV panels. Before deciding to use PV panels, Fox &amp; Fowle had considered installing solar panels on the roof, as well as wind turbines. Douglas Durst of the Durst Organization said the panels were intended to indicate the building&#x27;s energy-saving features, as the PV panels could be upgraded when the technology was more advanced.

==== Nasdaq MarketSite ====

The eight-story cylindrical facade of 4 Times Square&#x27;s northwest corner, on Broadway and 43rd Street, contains Nasdaq MarketSite. The facade was part of the building&#x27;s original design and was included before Nasdaq had leased the space. At street level is a three-story glass facade, which contains a view of the studio inside. Above the studio, the facade consists of a giant LED display, variously cited as measuring or . The display was the world&#x27;s largest at the time of its completion. The display is allowed because 4 Times Square is exempt from the zoning rules regarding signs.

The LED sign over the studio cost $37 million. The display can show information at a computer display standard of 1280x1824, and it has over 18 million LEDs. The display is made of about 8,200 or 8,400 panels, manufactured by Saco Smart Vision. It is thick and is interrupted by thirty square windows. The windows are arranged into five rows, which illuminate a portion of Condé Nast&#x27;s space. There is a catwalk and a ventilation space behind the display, creating a gap of about between the sign and the actual facade. At 4 Times Square&#x27;s opening, Nasdaq leased the sign space from Durst for $2 million a year.

==== Top-story signs ====
The top of the building was originally ornamented with four signs, each measuring and displaying the address 4 Times Square. Unlike the signs at the base, the top stories&#x27; signs are not required by zoning. While modern New York City building code prohibits logos from being more than above the curb or occupying over on a blockfront, the top-story signs are protected because they are in the 42nd Street Development Project.

The panels were originally vacant, though Durst had sought to market them to tenants at $1 million a year. In 2000, after the building opened, panels with the name of wireless provider Teligent Telecom were installed on the top stories, measuring . The signs were subsequently replaced by the number &quot;4&quot; during the mid-2000s. Since 2013, the top of the building has contained four illuminated panels with the name of clothing retailer H&amp;M, a retail tenant at the base.

=== Mechanical and environmental features ===

==== Fuel cells ====
The building is partially powered by two fuel cells that are capable of each. They are installed on the fourth floor. The two cells could provide 50 percent of the exterior signs&#x27; nighttime power needs but a minuscule amount of the daytime needs. They could generate eight percent of the building&#x27;s total electricity. The fuel cells cost $1 million and were made by United Technologies Corporation. As part of an agreement with Consolidated Edison (Con Ed), which operates much of New York City&#x27;s power-supply system, the cells must be turned off during a power failure, such as the Northeast blackout of 2003.

Fox &amp; Fowle originally planned to include eight fuel cells, which would have been capable of generating of power annually, including all of the exterior signs&#x27; power needs. Along with the photovoltaic panels on the facade, the fuel cells would have been able to provide most of the power for 4 Times Square, with building managers purchasing power from the city&#x27;s electrical grid from Con Ed only as needed. The fuel cells would have to run continuously to operate efficiently, since they could not be turned off or on easily, but the building&#x27;s power needs were much lower at night during the day. Furthermore, each cell cost $600,000. Consequently, plans for six of the eight fuel cells were discarded in 1997.

==== Air delivery ====
Fox &amp; Fowle and Durst decided to use chillers powered by natural gas to provide cool air to the offices. At the time, many buildings still used fossil fuels for power generation, and natural gas created much less pollution than other fossil fuels. Gas was used instead of electricity because gas could be stored for later use, while electricity had to be used when it is produced. According to Bruce Fowle of Fox &amp; Fowle, the firm had contemplated using electric chillers, which could create and store ice at night, then use the ice to chill the offices during the daytime. Fowle said the firm had decided against using ice storage because it was more expensive than natural gas-powered chillers. After an upgrade in 2003, the building had of air conditioning.

The air-delivery system provides 50 percent more fresh air than is required by New York City building code. It can also be used to ventilate polluted air from specified floors; a separate exhaust shaft was designed for employee smoking areas. The air-circulation system was built so air on any set of three floors could be replaced every 24 to 48 hours. Sensors on each floor are used to monitor air quality, and the building&#x27;s management team could adjust the air-delivery and ventilation systems as needed. Tenants could also independently adjust the heating and air-conditioning systems in their offices. The building&#x27;s climate control system was designed to operate in tandem with the wastewater system, further reducing energy use.

==== Other features ====
The building is also served by recycling chutes. There are dedicated shafts for paper recycling and trash, which lead to storage bins in the basement. There is mechanical equipment on the 49th floor and on two mezzanines above it. These stories contain three diesel generators, which power the antenna mast and are capable of a combined . In addition, the 51st floor has FM transmitters and combiners while the 52nd floor has TV combiners.

=== Interior ===
The superstructure is made of both concrete and steel, though the structural core is made of concrete. The steel columns are embedded in shear walls made of reinforced concrete. The building uses demolition debris that was recycled from the previous structures on the site, and the previous foundations were also reused. Where newer foundations were installed, deep-rock caissons and deep foundations were used to minimize damage to neighboring buildings and subway tunnels. The building&#x27;s core and external columns rise to the top of the building. The four large signs on the roof conceal the &quot;hat truss&quot; that connects the core and external columns. Behind the truss is mechanical space, which doubles as a damper. Inside, 4 Times Square has of space.

==== Lower stories ====

The lobby is on the east side of the ground floor and is accessed from both 42nd and 43rd Streets. The ceiling contains aluminum and fiberglass panels, which curve downward from both entrances toward the center of the space. The lobby has an exhibit of the Durst Organization&#x27;s history. There are also architectural models of various projects developed by the Durst Organization, such as the VIA 57 West residential development on Manhattan&#x27;s West Side, as well as brochures of buildings owned by the company. There are also security checkpoints with turnstiles.

The building was designed with of retail space on the lowest three stories. When the building opened, the retail space was occupied by a three-story ESPN Zone entertainment restaurant, operated by The Walt Disney Company. The ground floor had an American grill called the Studio Grill; the second floor had the Screening Room, a sports-viewing area with television screens; and the third floor had the Sports Arena, which included a small practice facility and an arcade video game area. Part of the ground floor and basement was also occupied by a Duane Reade. Since 2013, the old ESPN space has contained a three-story H&amp;M clothing store.

Einhorn Yaffee Prescott designed Nasdaq MarketSite&#x27;s space at the northwest corner of the building. The space had a 72-seat auditorium, a public exhibit area, and a pair of broadcast studios below the large LED sign. The ground floor of the MarketSite contains a broadcast studio with a wall of 96 monitors, measuring tall and broadcasting information about stocks and the market. It is visible from the windows that overlook Times Square. An exhibit on the second floor was designed as the &quot;MarketSite Experience&quot;, displaying items about MarketSite&#x27;s history.

==== Condé Nast cafeteria ====
Frank Gehry designed an employee cafeteria on the fourth floor for Condé Nast. The cafeteria was Gehry&#x27;s first New York City project since, prior to designing the space, Gehry had had difficulty gaining any major commissions. Gehry had been friends with Condé Nast CEO Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr., who offered to hire Gehry for the interior design of Condé Nast&#x27;s offices, a role that Gehry declined. When the cafeteria opened in 2000, it was directed by Sean J. Killeen and a staff of 53. The space was given several nicknames, such as &quot;the Commissary&quot; and &quot;the Aquarium&quot;. The main cafeteria covered and could fit 260 people. Next to the main cafeteria were four smaller dining rooms and an auditorium with 85 seats. The private dining rooms could fit 70. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; said that James Truman, Condé Nast&#x27;s editorial director, &quot;spent months thinking about nothing else&quot; during the design of the cafeteria. The cafeteria reportedly cost $30 to $35 million.

The main cafeteria measures tall. It was originally decorated with serpentine blue-titanium walls, as well as a ceiling with blue-titanium panels and hanging white shapes. The floor was made of plywood, but it was resurfaced in linoleum by 2002 because Condé Nast editors&#x27; high heels kept damaging the floor. Most of the seats were initially in 39 upholstered-leather booths with yellow elliptical wooden tables. The booths were slightly lifted on concrete podiums clad with wood, and the pathways through the cafeteria varied in elevation depending on the booths&#x27; height. Each booth is divided by angled glass partitions that measure tall, wide, and about thick and weighing apiece. The panes are held in place by metal grommets at the top and bottom. It took one year for Gehry and the glass workers to determine how to bend the glass into a three-dimensional shape. Gehry used CATIA software to modify the glass. The partitions in the private dining rooms were sandblasted and were designed with overlaps. A model of part of the dining area was fabricated in Italy before being shipped to New York City.

After Condé Nast moved out during 2014, the cafeteria was unused for five years. Studios Architecture renovated the dining room, which reopened in 2018 as a tenant-only food hall operated by Claus Meyer. The floors were resurfaced in white oak; the leather seats and tables were replaced; and the titanium walls were covered with curving sheetrock and plaster. A set of test kitchens was turned into a reception area for an adjacent conference room. The northwestern western section of the cafeteria, which had once contained mechanical space behind the MarketSite sign, was converted into a garden room with a full-height green wall containing 2,200 plants. Seating capacity was increased to 300 during the renovation.

==== Offices ====
The lowest office floors cover each, while the highest floors cover each. When designing the building, Fox &amp; Fowle tried to maximize the amount of space illuminated by natural light. Since natural light could only penetrate about 25 percent of each office story, the office stories contain a flexible open plan arrangement. The lighting in the office stories can be controlled by dimmers.

Condé Nast&#x27;s space originally spanned floors 4 to 23 and cost an estimated $100 million. The Condé Nast offices were designed by Mancini Duffy, though Truman influenced the furnishings in the offices. The company&#x27;s flagship magazines &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; had their own stories, while &quot;The New Yorker&quot; had floors 20 and 21; the rest of the space had corporate offices. Most of Condé Nast&#x27;s stories were shared by two publications; the elevator lobbies served as a common reception area, with glass doors on either side. Past the glass doors were curved &quot;branding walls&quot; with the logo of the publication that occupied the corresponding office space. Behind the &quot;branding walls&quot; on each floor are rectangular conference rooms with beige or gray decorations, as well as meeting spaces for editorial teams. Along the outer edges of each story, each publication&#x27;s offices were connected by an &quot;art corridor&quot; decorated with works of art.

Most of Condé Nast&#x27;s offices were arranged in an open plan, which was not popular among the publication&#x27;s employees. The open-plan workspaces had white-laminate and blue-gray aluminum workstations with wooden accents. Only five percent of offices were directly adjacent to windows, but the open plan allowed many lower-ranking employees to have desks next to windows. Publishers and top editors had their own offices at the corners, while senior staffers had to work near the building&#x27;s core. Some editors customized their offices. For example, Anna Wintour of &quot;Vogue&quot; used aluminum chairs and potted bulbs to resemble a setting in &quot;Home and Garden&quot; magazine, and Ruth Reichl of &quot;Gourmet&quot; designed her offices in a contemporary style with red accents. Graydon Carter of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; redesigned his editorial office so it looked like his previous accommodations. Test kitchens, two private dining rooms, and a photograph studio were also installed for &quot;Gourmet&#x27;s&quot; recipe editors. Newhouse&#x27;s office was on the 11th floor, unlike other executive offices that were generally placed at the top.

== History ==
=== Planning ===
The Durst family had started acquiring property on the city block bounded by Broadway, Sixth Avenue, and 42nd and 43rd Streets in 1967, when Douglas Durst&#x27;s father Seymour Durst bought a building that housed White&#x27;s Sea Food Restaurant. Seymour Durst planned to redevelop the area east of Times Square with office skyscrapers, but he canceled these plans in 1973 amid a declining office market. Several other failed proposals followed for the block.

==== Early plans ====

The Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC), an agency of the New York state government, had proposed redeveloping the area around a portion of West 42nd Street in 1981. Four towers designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee were to be built around 42nd Street&#x27;s intersections with Broadway and Seventh Avenue; the largest of those would have been a 56-story building at the northeast corner of 42nd Street and Broadway. These towers would have been redeveloped by George Klein of Park Tower Realty, though the Prudential Insurance Company of America joined the project in 1986. Furthermore, as part of the West Midtown special zoning district created in 1982, the New York City government had allowed new buildings in Times Square to be developed with an increased floor area ratio. To ensure the area would not be darkened at nightfall, the city passed zoning regulations that encouraged developers to add large, bright signs on their buildings.

The Durst Organization opposed the redevelopment for 15 years, citing concerns over the subsidies that were to be given to the developers, which in turn would decrease the value of the Dursts&#x27; buildings. Durst himself had acquired a small portion of what would be Park Tower and Prudential&#x27;s office building, part of 20 lots on the same city block that he owned by February 1990. However, he was loath to develop his sites on the block until the 42nd Street redevelopment had been finalized. The Dursts&#x27; opposition, along with Prudential and Park Tower&#x27;s inability to secure tenants for the proposed buildings, led government officials to allow Prudential and Park Tower to postpone the project in 1992. By then, Prudential had spent $300 million on condemning the sites through eminent domain. The partners retained the right to develop the sites in the future, and the ESDC&#x27;s zoning guidelines remained in effect. Klein ceded decision-making power for the sites to Prudential, which decided to exit the real-estate market altogether, selling off all four sites.

==== Durst proposal ====
Seymour Durst ultimately died in mid-1995 before any building was developed on the block. By November 1995, Seymour&#x27;s son Douglas Durst was negotiating with Prudential to develop the northeast corner of 42nd Street and Broadway with a larger skyscraper that would use the Durst family&#x27;s adjacent lots. Durst asked Prudential to postpone the development of the other three sites until Durst had completed his building. The new building would be the first in the same redevelopment project that the Durst family had once opposed. Further, Durst planned to claim a 35 percent tax abatement for the project. Durst acquired a $215 million mortgage loan on three other buildings to fund the proposed skyscraper.

After a slight delay, Prudential&#x27;s board voted to sell the site to Durst in February 1996. Klein was opposed to the proposed sale, citing the Durst family&#x27;s previous objections to the redevelopment. Ultimately, Klein received an unknown amount of compensation for ceding the site&#x27;s development rights to Durst. Durst acquired the plot that April, he combined the newly acquired lot, which covered , with an adjacent lot owned by his family, covering . Durst proposed a skyscraper on the expanded site. To reduce concerns from community members and civic groups, he showed them his plans. Fox &amp; Fowle was hired to design the building; at the time, it was one of four companies that were allowed to design green buildings in New York City. Its plan for limestone and glass facades was generally well received by civic groups such as the Municipal Art Society.

Before construction started, the state required a commitment from a large tenant. This led media sources to debate whether the building was a speculative development. Though Durst had intended the building to be developed without an anchor tenant, similar to speculative buildings, the state would not approve the project unless a tenant was secured. The author Matthew Wells characterized the building as &quot;the first speculative office block to be completed in Manhattan for over a decade&quot;. At the time of the sale, Durst denied rumors that Condé Nast would occupy the building for its headquarters. That May, Condé Nast leased , taking up floors 4 to 23, with an option for an additional . The building was consequently named after Condé Nast. The publisher had wanted to consolidate the operations of 17 of its magazines, which then occupied six separate buildings, and many of its leases were set to expire in 2000. Condé Nast had selected 4 Times Square because of the environmentally-efficient features planned for the structure.

=== Construction ===
Preliminary work for 4 Times Square, as the building was known, began in September 1996. At the time, it was the first speculative office development to be built in Midtown Manhattan in fifteen years, and its construction prompted the development of other office buildings in the area. 4 Times Square and its three neighboring developments would collectively add almost of office space. All four projects were being marketed with a Times Square address, which until the early 1990s had not been popular in the city&#x27;s real estate market. The project was to receive $10.7 million in tax relief and Durst was to receive a $4 million tax exemption every year. That October, law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom agreed to move its headquarters to 4 Times Square, with on the top 21 stories. Skadden Arps&#x27;s commitment was part of an increase in leasing in buildings around Times Square. By March 1997, though the building&#x27;s site had not been fully excavated, 87 percent of the office space had already been leased. Rainforest Cafe tentatively agreed to lease a storefront in the street level and basement that July.

Since most of the office space had been taken by Condé Nast and Skadden Arps, the Durst Organization decided to distribute CDs to promote the retail space and the signs atop the building. The promotional CD contained a photo gallery of Times Square&#x27;s history, details of 4 Times Square&#x27;s green-building features, and a map of planned hotels and stores nearby. The Durst Organization received a $340 million construction loan in mid-1997. The loan was issued by a syndicate of banks led by the Bank of New York. The site was cleared by that August 1997. The superstructure had risen to 30 stories by the February 1998, though steel construction was delayed by the rainy weather. Around that time, Nasdaq was considering leasing a marketing center and TV studio at 4 Times Square. By mid-1998, it had agreed to lease the space and add an LED sign around the cylindrical northwest corner. Disney leased three stories of retail later that year for the ESPN Zone entertainment restaurant.

Several incidents occurred during construction, leading the city&#x27;s tabloid newspapers to describe the construction site as &quot;jinxed&quot;. A construction crane fell onto a building on 43rd Street in January 1998, and a piece of aluminum dropped from the northern facade that April, though no one was hurt in either incident. That June, a carpenter was crushed to death by an elevator. The most severe incident occurred on July 21, 1998, when a construction elevator fell onto the nearby Woodstock Hotel, killing an 85-year-old woman and injuring twelve other people. The surrounding area was closed to the public and many residents and businesses were displaced; the area could not be reopened until netting was installed around the collapsed scaffold. After the scaffold was disassembled, the surrounding segment of 43rd Street was reopened a month after the collapse, though Woodstock Hotel residents did not return until that October.

The July 1998 construction collapse delayed construction by two months. Following an investigation, U.S. government officials said in early 1999 that the scaffold had collapsed because it had lacked crucial support beams. The construction crane was being disassembled by February 1999; at the time, it was the eighth-tallest structure in Manhattan. The next month, as the building was being completed, falling debris from the construction site injured three pedestrians.

=== Usage ===

==== Opening ====

The first Condé Nast employees began moving into the building on June 21, 1999, when almost 200 employees from &quot;Brides&quot;, &quot;House &amp; Garden&quot;, and &quot;Women&#x27;s Sports and Fitness&quot; moved to the structure. The relocations continued over the two following months. The overall reaction among Condé Nast employees was positive, though some were critical of the building; one editor would not preview the building prior to the move, while another expressed concern about the construction incidents. Furthermore, many staff members of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; were reluctant to move to 4 Times Square, though this was more heavily influenced by the fact that &quot;The New Yorker&quot; previously occupied a different building from the other Condé Nast publications. Many Condé Nast staff arrived at the building in limousines, which created congestion on nearby streets, prompting the city government to create a limousine-dropoff area nearby.

At the building&#x27;s opening, Durst also faced two class-action lawsuits from nearby business owners as a result of the construction incidents in 1998. These were both dismissed in July 1999 because the business owners did not suffer physical damage. In addition, Nasdaq and Condé Nast had disagreed over the proposed LED sign since the beginning of 1999, leading the two companies to seek an arbitration proceeding. Condé Nast claimed that the sign would block the windows of its art department and that it protruded too far from the facade. In response, Nasdaq said the sign was within the terms of its own lease and that, in any case, Condé Nast&#x27;s graphic-arts department did not need natural light. An arbitrator ruled in favor of Nasdaq in August 1999, and the Nasdaq MarketSite sign started illuminating that December. By the end of 1999, Durst was looking to refinance the building to replace the construction loan from the Bank of New York.

==== 2000s ====
The building&#x27;s fourth-floor cafe opened in April 2000 and was renovated two years afterward. Meanwhile, the signs atop the building remained unused through early 2000. Teligent was the first company to pay $500,000 a year for the signs, but it went bankrupt a year after the signs were installed. By late 2001, Nasdaq was contemplating relocating its offices (which had been damaged in the September 11 attacks) to 4 Times Square, where only of office space was vacant. Several radio stations had also been forced to move to 4 Times Square after the attacks, prompting the addition of an FM antenna for WNYC in March 2002. The Duane Reade pharmacy chain leased the remaining ground-floor space and part of the basement in mid-2002.

After the September 11 attacks, Durst was unable to refinance 4 Times Square because his insurer had dropped terrorism coverage from its policy. A judge issued a restraining order preventing mortgage holder Cigna from declaring the building in default until April 2002. The restraining order was extended to May; a few minutes before the extension was set to expire, it was extended again to September. In the meantime, a New York state judge ruled that Cigna could force Durst to carry terror insurance. The lack of insurance led Moody&#x27;s Investors Service to reduce the credit rating of the loan on 4 Times Square. Following the passage of a terror-insurance law in November 2002, Durst said he was amenable to buy a cheaper terror-insurance policy. Cigna and Durst had reached a settlement by late 2003, when the credit rating of the property loan was upgraded after Durst obtained terror insurance.

Meanwhile, in November 2002, Durst announced that he would construct a antenna mast atop 4 Times Square as a backup facility for radio stations that had broadcast from the World Trade Center. The original antenna mast was designed for four stations but was serving eight stations, while the new antenna mast would be designed to serve 18 stations. The old mast was disassembled and the new mast was constructed starting in March 2003. Univision signed an agreement to build an antenna on the building. During construction, a temporary one-bay antenna was mounted atop 4 Times Square. The work, costing $25 million, included adding structural reinforcements. The new mast was finished on October 2, 2003, with the first broadcast occurring on October 30 of the same year.

During the mid-2000s, Durst spent $300,000 to install repeaters and antennas that could operate the core mechanical systems in case of an emergency. The equipment was completed in 2006. By then, the signs atop the building were not being used by any advertiser and contained the number &quot;4&quot;. In the late 2000s, Durst developed the Bank of America Tower on the eastern side of the block, obscuring views from 4 Times Square&#x27;s eastern facade.

==== 2010s to present ====

The ESPN Zone restaurant closed in June 2010 following the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Around that time, Condé Nast signed a lease to relocate to the new One World Trade Center when that building was completed. The retail space remained vacant for over two years and, following a failed negotiation with Express, Inc., H&amp;M agreed to lease the majority of the retail space in late 2012. H&amp;M announced in August 2013 that it would install panels with its logo atop the building, and the H&amp;M store opened that November. Condé Nast moved to One World Trade Center between November 2014 and January 2015. After the relocation, preservationists expressed concern that the Condé Nast cafeteria would be destroyed, since Skadden Arps had its own cafeteria. In early 2015, the Durst Organization indicated it would preserve the cafeteria but would have to find a tenant for it.

Among the later tenants was Nasdaq, which in February 2018 moved its global headquarters to the building and extended the MarketSite lease. Nasdaq planned to expand MarketSite over the following three years; the expansion included a 10th-story event space with a terrace that would be able to accommodate 400 people. During the late 2010s, the Durst Organization renovated the building&#x27;s main entrance and lobby for $140 million. In addition, the fourth-floor dining room was renovated for $35 million; after the renovation was completed in 2018, the dining room was opened to all of the building&#x27;s tenants. The Durst Organization also installed beehives on the building&#x27;s roof to create honey for the dining room. After the renovation, 4 Times Square had of amenity space.

Skadden Arps itself planned to move out of Four Times Square by 2020, having signed a lease at One Manhattan West. The building&#x27;s two major tenants had occupied nearly all the office space, and their departure would leave the building almost vacant. In the five years after Condé Nast&#x27;s departure, the Durst Organization secured tenants for the publisher&#x27;s former space. All of the old Condé Nast space had been leased by April 2019. Durst then refinanced the building with $900 million from JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. The refinancing came after $650 million of commercial mortgage-backed securities, issued by UBS, had matured. The Durst Organization also planned to market the building as 151 West 42nd Street. By July 2022, the Durst Organization had leased out the last two vacant floors that Skadden Arps had occupied.

== Critical reception ==

When construction of 4 Times Square began in 1996, Paul Goldberger wrote for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; &quot;While the building is far from modest in size, [Fox &amp; Fowle&#x27;s design] is significantly improved from the original plans by Philip Johnson and John Burgee.&quot; For the same newspaper, Herbert Muschamp wrote that the building &quot;is not monstrously out of scale&quot; with other contemporary developments. Muschamp said it looked like a custom design for Condé Nast, &quot;whose stock in trade is the knowing mix of high style and popular culture&quot;. Karrie Jacobs of &quot;New York&quot; magazine also considered Fox &amp; Fowle&#x27;s design to be better than Johnson and Burgee&#x27;s plan, adding that &quot;It&#x27;s the perfect building for a culture that consists of nothing but fragmented references to what has come before&quot;. The building was pictured in the August 1998 issue of &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine, which was published as scheduled despite the fatal construction collapse the previous month.

After the building was completed, Suzanne Stephens wrote that the decorative elements on the glass facades &quot;seem unnecessary&quot; from a purist point of view, though she added that decorative features in the Empire State Building and Chrysler Building were similarly criticized upon their respective completions. Muschamp said of the different facades of the building: &quot;it wants to be at once a background building and a foreground building, both star and chorus&quot;. Jacobs called the building &quot;better as a piece of social commentary than as architecture&quot; with its contrasting facades. 4 Times Square also received awards from the American Institute of Architects and AIA&#x27;s New York state chapter.

The Condé Nast cafeteria was largely praised, with Muschamp referring to the cafeteria as &quot;an underwater hypostyle hall&quot;. Brent Richards wrote in the book &quot;New Glass Architecture&quot; that Gehry was able to create a &quot;seemingly impossible fluidity&quot; with the partitions, while &quot;Arcspace&quot; magazine said of the cafeteria, &quot;Gehry&#x27;s formalism has produced an informality that encourages chance encounters of the friendly, and even romantic, kind.&quot; The Nasdaq MarketSite facade on Broadway and 43rd Street was also critiqued; Jacobs described it as a &quot;glowing 140-foot-high soda can&quot;. Muschamp said the cylindrical facade would &quot;make a dandy giant soda can, film spool, aerosol spray, or a current issue of &quot;House and Garden&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="507285" wikidata="Q1462531" url="?curid=507285" title="Layoff">
<text>A layoff or downsizing is the temporary suspension or permanent termination of employment of an employee or, more commonly, a group of employees (collective layoff) for business reasons, such as personnel management or downsizing an organization. Originally, &quot;layoff&quot; referred exclusively to a temporary interruption in work, or employment but this has evolved to a permanent elimination of a position in both British and US English, requiring the addition of &quot;temporary&quot; to specify the original meaning of the word. A layoff is not to be confused with wrongful termination. 

&quot;Laid off workers&quot; or &quot;displaced workers&quot; are workers who have lost or left their jobs because their employer has closed or moved, there was insufficient work for them to do, or their position or shift was abolished (Borbely, 2011). Downsizing in a company is defined to involve the reduction of employees in a workforce. Downsizing in companies became a popular practice in the 1980s and early 1990s as it was seen as a way to deliver better shareholder value as it helps to reduce the costs of employers (downsizing, 2015). Research on downsizing in the US, UK, and Japan suggests that downsizing is being regarded by management as one of the preferred routes to help declining organizations, cutting unnecessary costs, and improve organizational performance. Usually a layoff occurs as a cost-cutting measure. A study of 391 downsizing announcements of the S&amp;P 100 firms for the period 1990-2006 found, that layoff announcements resulted in substantial increase in the companies’ stock prices, and that the gain was larger, when the company had prior layoffs. The authors suggested, that the stock price manipulation alone creates a sufficient motivation for publicly-traded corporations to adopt the practice of regular layoffs.

== Terminology ==
Euphemisms are often used to &quot;soften the blow&quot; in the process of firing and being fired. The term &quot;layoff&quot; originally meant a temporary interruption in work (and usually pay). The term became a euphemism for permanent termination of employment and now usually means that, requiring the addition of &quot;temporary&quot; to refer to the original meaning. Many other euphemisms have been coined for &quot;(permanent) layoff&quot;, including &quot;downsizing&quot;, &quot;excess reduction&quot;, &quot;rightsizing&quot;, &quot;leveraging synergies&quot;, &quot;delayering&quot;, &quot;smartsizing&quot;, &quot;redeployment&quot;, &quot;workforce reduction&quot;, &quot;workforce optimization&quot;, &quot;simplification&quot;, &quot;force shaping&quot;, &quot;recussion&quot;, &quot;manage out people&quot;, &quot;resource action&quot;, and &quot;reduction in force&quot; (also called &quot;RIF&quot;, especially in the government employment sector). &quot;Mass layoff&quot; is defined by the United States Department of Labor as 50 or more workers laid off from the same company around the same time. &quot;Attrition&quot; implies that positions will be eliminated as workers quit or retire. &quot;Early retirement&quot; means workers may quit now yet still remain eligible for their retirement benefits later.

&quot;Redundancy&quot; is a specific legal term in UK labour law with a definition in section 139 of the Employment Rights Act 1996: see Redundancy in United Kingdom law.

When an employer is faced with work of a particular type ceasing or diminishing at a particular location, it may be perceived as obfuscation. Firings imply misconduct or failure while layoffs imply economic forces beyond the employer&#x27;s and employees&#x27; control, especially in the face of a recession.

== Common abbreviations for &quot;reduction in force&quot; ==
RIF – A generic reduction in force, of undetermined method. Often pronounced like the word &quot;riff&quot; rather than spelled out. Sometimes used as a verb, as in &quot;the employees were pretty heavily &quot;riffed&quot;&quot;.

eRIF – Layoff notice by email.

IRIF – Involuntary reduction in force – The employee(s) did not voluntarily choose to leave the company. This usually implies that the method of reduction involved either layoffs, firings, or both, but would not usually imply resignations or retirements. If the employee is fired rather than laid off, the term &quot;with cause&quot; may be appended to indicate that the separation was due to this employee&#x27;s performance and/or behavior, rather than being financially motivated.

VRIF – Voluntary reduction in force – The employee(s) did play a role in choosing to leave the company, most likely through resignation or retirement. In some instances, a company may exert pressure on an employee to make this choice, perhaps by implying that a layoff or termination would otherwise be imminent, or by offering an attractive severance or early retirement package. Conversely, the company is not obliged to accept an employee&#x27;s decision and may not accept every employee who volunteers for a VRIF.

WFR – Work force reduction.

== In the public sector ==
Following the recession of 2007–2008, the public sector has seen significantly smaller job growth in employment versus the private sector, and layoffs have been used to ensure sustainability. As the public sector declines, the demand for services from the private sector declines as well. Layoffs in the public sector have put limitations on the growth rate of the private sector, inevitably burdening the entire flow of markets.

== Unemployment compensation ==
Risks of being laid off vary depending on the workplace and country a person is working in. Unemployment compensation in any country or workplace typically has two main factors. The first factor of unemployment compensation depends on the distribution of unemployment benefits in a workplace outlined in an employee handbook. The second factor is the risk of inequality being conditioned upon the political regime type in the country an employee is working in. The amount of compensation will usually depend on what level the employee holds in the company.

Packages may also vary if the employee is laid off, or voluntarily quits in the face of a layoff (VRIF). The method of separation may have an effect on a former employee&#x27;s ability to collect whatever form of unemployment compensation might be available in their jurisdiction. In many U.S. states, workers who are laid off can file an unemployment claim and receive compensation. Depending on local or state laws, workers who leave voluntarily are generally ineligible to collect unemployment benefits, as are those who are fired for gross misconduct. Also, lay-offs due to a firm&#x27;s moving production overseas may entitle one to increased re-training benefits. Some companies in the United States utilize Supplemental Unemployment Benefits. Since they were first introduced by organized labor and the Department of Labor in the early 1950s, and first issued in a Revenue Ruling by the IRS in 1956, SUB-Pay Plans have enabled employers to supplement the receipt of state unemployment insurance benefits for employees that experience an involuntary layoff. By establishing severance payments as SUB-Pay benefits, the payments are not considered wages for FICA, FUTA, and SUI tax purposes, and employee FICA tax. To qualify for SUB-Pay benefits, the participant must be eligible for state unemployment insurance benefits and the separation benefit must be paid on a periodic basis. There have also been increasing concerns about the organizational effectiveness of the post-downsized &#x27;anorexic organization&#x27;. The benefits, which organizations claim to be seeking from downsizing, center on savings in labor costs, speedier decision making, better communication, reduced product development time, enhanced involvement of employees and greater responsiveness to customers (De Meuse et al. 1997, p. 168). However, some writers draw attention to the &#x27;obsessive&#x27; pursuit of downsizing to the point of self-starvation marked by excessive cost-cutting, organ failure and extreme pathological fear of becoming inefficient. Hence &#x27;trimming&#x27; and &#x27;tightening belts&#x27; are the order of the day.

== Effects ==
Traditionally, layoffs directly affect the employee. However, the employee terminated is not alone in this. Layoffs affect the workplace environment and the economy as well as the employee. Layoffs have a widespread effect and the three main components of layoff effects are in the workplace, to the employee, and effects to the economy. One framework to examine the effects on the macro level is PSB, which examines the stakeholders perspective in global downsizing. This framework examines the global perspective of positive and negative stakeholders behavior during downsizing.

===Effects of layoffs in the workplace===
Layoffs have remained the greatest way for a company to cut costs. Although from the employer&#x27;s perspective a layoff is beneficial for the business, layoffs create an uncertainty in the workplace environment and lowers other employees&#x27; job security as well as creates an apprehension and fear of termination for the remaining employees, and subsequently lowers overall motivation in the workplace environment. According to &quot;Healing the Wounds: Overcoming the Trauma of Layoffs and Revitalizing Downsized Organizations,&quot; in the post-layoff environment, there is a need for empathy, tangibility, self-knowledge, and relentlessly seeking customers among the surviving employees. The remaining employees may have feelings of survivors guilt. In order to diminish negative effects of layoffs, Wayne Cascio suggests alternative approaches to layoff and downsizing as &quot;Responsible restructuring&quot; approach. Optimism is critical for rebuilding the workplace environment because employees look to their leaders for stability and predictability. No matter the position in an organization, employees will look for job security.

===Effects of layoffs to the employee===

Employees (or former employees in this case) can be affected in a couple of different ways. When an employee is laid off, his or her general trust in long-term work may decrease, reducing expectations upon rehire. After an employee withstands a layoff, the effects can trickle into future employment and attitudes. Layoffs in the workplace often leave the former employee less inclined to trust future employers which can lead to behavioral conflicts among co-workers and management. Layoffs can erode confidence, making employees feel insecure about their job performance and career prospects. Despite new employers not being responsible for a prior circumstances, job performance may still be affected by prior layoffs. Many companies work to make layoffs as minimally burdensome to the employee. At times employers may layoff multiple people at once to soften the impact.

* Denial stage is the first stage in the emotional reaction to change or layoffs, in which an employee denies that an organization change or layoff will occur. 
* Anger stage is the second stage of the emotional reaction to downsizing, in which an employee becomes angry at the organization.
* Fear stage is the third emotional stage following an announcement of layoff, in which employees worry about how they will survive financially.
* Acceptance stage is the fourth and final stage of the emotional reaction to downsizing, in which employees accept that layoffs will occur and are ready to take steps to secure their future.

===Effects of layoffs in the American economy===

Layoffs create lower job security overall, and an increased competitiveness for available and opening positions. Layoffs have generally two major effects on the economy and stockholders. The way layoffs affect the economy varies from the industry that is doing the layoffs and the size of the layoff. If an industry that employs a majority of a region (freight in the northeast for example) suffers and has to lay employees off, there will be mass unemployment in an economically rich area. This can have leave ripple effects nationwide. Unemployment is the biggest effect on the economy that can come from layoffs.

== Around the world ==
In francophone Belgium, the term Procédure Renault has become a synonym for the consultation process leading to mass redundancies, due to a controversial mass layoff and resultant legislation in the late 1990s. 

When an employee has been laid off in Australia their employer has to give them redundancy pay, which is also known as severance pay. The only time that a redundancy payment doesn&#x27;t have to be paid is if an employee is casual, working for a small business or has worked for a business for less than twelve months. The redundancy compensation payment for employees depends on the length of time an employee has worked for an employer which excludes unpaid leave. If an employer can&#x27;t afford the redundancy payment they are supposed to give their employee, once making them redundant, or they find their employee another job that is suitable for the employee. An employer is able to apply for a reduction in the amount of money they have to pay the employee they have made redundant. An employer can do this by applying to the Fair Work Commission for a redundancy payment reduction. 

A layoff is also known as a retrenchment in (South African English). In the UK, permanent termination due to elimination of a position is usually called redundancy. Certain countries (such as Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Italy, France and Germany), distinguish between leaving the company of one&#x27;s own free will, in which case the person is not entitled to unemployment benefits, but may receive a onetime payment and leaving a company as part of a reduction in labour force size, in which case the person is entitled to them. A RIF reduces the number of positions, rather than laying off specific people, and is usually accompanied by internal &quot;redeployment&quot;.

==Mass layoff==
Department of Labor Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) requires employer &quot;to provide at least 60 calendar days advance written notice of a plant closing and mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees&quot;.

The framework also matches empirical findings on the shares of average earnings losses following displacement that are due to reduced employment and lower wages.&quot;

<text>William Francis Murphy (April 13, 1890July 19, 1949) was an American politician, lawyer, and jurist from Michigan. He was a Democrat who was named to the Supreme Court of the United States in 1940 after a political career that included serving as United States Attorney General, 35th governor of Michigan, and Mayor of Detroit. He also served as the last Governor-General of the Philippines and the first High Commissioner to the Philippines.

Born in &quot;The Thumb&quot; region of Michigan, Murphy graduated from the University of Michigan Law School in 1914. After serving in the United States Army during World War I, he served as a federal attorney and trial judge. He served as Mayor of Detroit from 1930 to 1933. A panel of 69 scholars in 1993 ranked him among the ten best mayors in American history. In 1933 he was appointed as Governor-General of the Philippine Islands. He returned home in 1936 and defeated incumbent Republican governor Frank Fitzgerald in the 1936 Michigan gubernatorial election and served a single term as Governor of Michigan. Murphy lost re-election to Fitzgerald in 1938 and accepted an appointment as the United States Attorney General the following year.

In 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Murphy to the Supreme Court to fill a vacancy caused by the death of Pierce Butler. Murphy served on the Court from 1940 until his death in 1949, and was succeeded by Tom C. Clark. Murphy wrote the Court&#x27;s majority opinion in &quot;SEC v. W. J. Howey Co.&quot;, and wrote a dissenting opinion in &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot;.

==Early life==
Murphy was born in Harbor Beach (then called Sand Beach), Michigan, in 1890. Both his parents, John T. Murphy and Mary Brennan, were Irish immigrants and raised him as a devout Catholic. He followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps by becoming a lawyer. He attended the University of Michigan Law School, and graduated with a BA in 1912 and an LLB in 1914. He was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity and the senior society Michigamua.

Murphy was admitted to the State Bar of Michigan in 1914, after which he clerked with a Detroit law firm for three years. He then served with the American Expeditionary Forces in Europe during World War I, achieving the rank of captain with the occupation army in Germany before leaving the service in 1919. He remained abroad afterward to pursue graduate studies. He did his graduate work at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in London and Trinity College, Dublin, which was said to be formative for his judicial philosophy. He developed a need to decide cases based on his more holistic notions of justice, eschewing technical legal arguments. As one commentator quipped of his later Supreme Court service, he &quot;tempered justice with Murphy.&quot;

==Career==
===1919–1922: U.S. Attorney, Eastern District of Michigan===
Murphy was appointed and took the oath of office as the first Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan on August 9, 1919. He was one of three assistant attorneys in the office.

When Murphy began his career as a federal attorney, the workload of the attorney&#x27;s office was increasing at a rapid rate, mainly because of the number of prosecutions resulting from the enforcement of national prohibition. The government&#x27;s excellent record in winning convictions in the Eastern District was partially due to Murphy&#x27;s record of winning all but one of the cases he prosecuted. He practiced law privately to a limited extent while still a federal attorney, and resigned his position as a United States attorney on March 1, 1922. He had several offers to join private practices, but decided to go it alone and formed a partnership with Edward G. Kemp in Detroit.

===1923–1930: Recorder&#x27;s Court===
Murphy ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for the United States Congress in 1920, when national and state Republicans swept Michigan, but used his legal reputation and growing political connections to win a seat on the Recorder&#x27;s Court, Detroit&#x27;s criminal court. In 1923, he was elected judge of the Recorder&#x27;s Court on a non-partisan ticket by one of the largest majorities ever cast for a judge in Detroit, took office on January 1, 1924, and served seven years during the Prohibition era.

While on Recorder&#x27;s Court, he established a reputation as a trial judge. He was a presiding judge in the famous murder trials of Dr. Ossian Sweet and his brother, Henry Sweet, in 1925 and 1926. Clarence Darrow, then one of the most prominent trial lawyers in the country, was lead counsel for the defense. After an initial mistrial of all of the black defendants, Henry Sweet—who admitted that he fired the weapon which killed a member of the mob surrounding Dr. Sweet&#x27;s home and was retried separately—was acquitted by an all-white jury on grounds of the right of self-defense. The prosecution then elected to not prosecute any of the remaining defendants. Murphy&#x27;s rulings were material to the outcome of the case.

===1930–1933: Mayor of Detroit===
In 1930, Murphy ran as a Democrat and was elected Mayor of Detroit. He served from 1930 to 1933, during the first years of the Great Depression. He presided over an epidemic of urban unemployment, a crisis in which 100,000 were unemployed in the summer of 1931. He named an unemployment committee of private citizens from businesses, churches, and labor and social service organizations to identify all residents who were unemployed and not receiving welfare benefits. The Mayor&#x27;s Unemployment Committee raised funds for its relief effort and worked to distribute food and clothing to the needy, and a Legal Aid Subcommittee volunteered to assist with the legal problems of needy clients. In 1933, Murphy convened in Detroit and organized the first convention of the United States Conference of Mayors. They met and conferred with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Murphy was elected its first president. He served in that position from 1932 until 1933.

Murphy was an early and enthusiastic supporter of Roosevelt and the New Deal, helping Roosevelt to become the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state of Michigan since Franklin Pierce in 1852 before the Republican Party was founded.

A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists, and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago saw Murphy ranked as the seventh-best American big-city mayor to serve between the years 1820 and 1993. Holli wrote that Murphy was an exemplary mayor and a highly effective leader.

===1933–1935: Governor-General of the Philippine Islands===
By 1933, after Murphy&#x27;s second mayoral term, the reward of a big government job was waiting. Roosevelt appointed Murphy as Governor-General of the Philippine Islands.

He was sympathetic to the plight of ordinary Filipinos, especially the land-hungry and oppressed tenant farmers, and emphasized the need for social justice.

===1935–1936: High Commissioner to the Philippines===
When his position as governor-general was abolished in 1935, he stayed on as United States High Commissioner until 1936. That year, he was a delegate from the Philippine Islands to the Democratic National Convention.

High Commissioner to the Philippines was the title of the personal representative of the president of the United States to the Commonwealth of the Philippines during the period 1935–1946. The office was created by the Tydings–McDuffie Act of 1934, which provided for a period of transition from direct American rule to the complete independence of the islands on July 4, 1946.

===1937–1939: Governor of Michigan===

Murphy was elected the 35th governor of Michigan on November 3, 1936, defeating Republican incumbent Frank Fitzgerald, and served one two-year term. During his two years in office, an unemployment compensation system was instituted and mental health programs were improved.

The United Automobile Workers engaged in an historic sit-down strike at General Motors&#x27; Flint plant. The Flint Sit-Down Strike was a turning point in national collective bargaining and labor policy. After 27 people were injured in a battle between the workers and the police, including 13 strikers with gunshot wounds, Murphy sent the National Guard to protect the workers, failed to follow a court order that requested him to expel the strikers, and refused to order the Guard&#x27;s troops to suppress the strike.

He successfully mediated an agreement and end to the confrontation, and G.M. recognized the U.A.W. as a bargaining agent under the newly adopted National Labor Relations Act. This recognition had a significant effect on the growth of organized labor unions. In the next year, the UAW saw its membership grow from 30,000 to 500,000 members. As later noted by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), this strike was &quot;the strike heard round the world.&quot;

In 1938, Murphy was defeated by his predecessor, Fitzgerald, who became the only governor of Michigan to precede, and then succeed, the same person.

===1939–1940: Attorney General of the United States===
In 1939, Roosevelt appointed Murphy the 56th attorney general of the United States. He established a Civil Liberties Unit in the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice, designed to centralize enforcement responsibility for the Bill of Rights and civil rights statutes.

===1940–1949: Supreme Court and military service===
One year after becoming attorney general, on January 4, 1940, Murphy was nominated by President Roosevelt as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, filling the vacancy caused by the death of Pierce Butler the previous November. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 16, and sworn in on February 5, 1940. The timing of the appointment put Murphy on the cusp of the Charles Evans Hughes and the Harlan Fiske Stone courts. On the death of Chief Justice Stone, Murphy served in the court led by Frederick Moore Vinson, who was confirmed in 1946. During World War II he served in the Army Reserve during three months of 1942 while the court was in recess. He served as the executive officer to the Chief of Staff of the United States Army George C. Marshall. He retired with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

Murphy took an expansive view of individual liberties, and the limitations on government he found in the Bill of Rights. He authored 199 opinions: 131 for the majority, 68 in dissent. One of the important opinions authored by Justice Murphy was &quot;Securities and Exchange Commission v. W. J. Howey Co.&quot; (1946), in which the Court defined the term &quot;investment contract&quot; under the Securities Act of 1933, thus giving content to the most important concept of what makes something a security in American law.

Opinions differ about him and his jurisprudential philosophy. He has been acclaimed as a legal scholar and a champion of the common man, but Justice Felix Frankfurter disparagingly nicknamed Murphy &quot;the Saint&quot;, criticizing his decisions as being rooted more in passion than reason. It has been said he was &quot;neither legal scholar nor craftsman&quot;, and he was criticized &quot;for relying on heart over head, results over legal reasoning, clerks over hard work, and emotional solos over team play.&quot;
Murphy&#x27;s support of African Americans, aliens, criminals, dissenters, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Native Americans, women, workers and other &quot;outsiders&quot; evoked a pun: &quot;tempering justice with Murphy.&quot; As he wrote in &quot;Falbo v. United States&quot; (1944), &quot;The law knows no finer hour than when it cuts through formal concepts and transitory emotions to protect unpopular citizens against discrimination and persecution.&quot; (p. 561)

According to Frankfurter, Murphy was part of the more liberal &quot;axis&quot; of justices on the Court along with justices Wiley B. Rutledge, William O. Douglas, and Hugo L. Black; the group would for years oppose Frankfurter&#x27;s &quot;judicially restrained&quot; conservative ideology. Douglas, Murphy and then Rutledge were the first justices to agree with Black&#x27;s notion that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated the Bill of Rights&#x27; protection in it; this view would later become law.

Murphy is perhaps best known for his vehement dissent from the court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot; (1944), which upheld the constitutionality of the government&#x27;s internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. He sharply criticized the majority ruling as &quot;legalization of racism.&quot;

This was the first time the word &quot;racism&quot; found its way into a Supreme Court opinion (Murphy had previously used the term twice in a concurring opinion in &quot;Steele v. Louisville &amp; Nashville Railway Co.&quot; (1944) issued that same day). He would use that word again in five separate opinions before the word &quot;racism&quot; disappeared from Murphy&#x27;s and the High Court&#x27;s other opinions for almost two decades, not reappearing until the landmark decision of &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; (1967), which struck down as unconstitutional the Virginia anti-miscegenation statute. (See also Jim Crow laws.)

Although Murphy was serving on the Supreme Court during World War II, he still longed to be part of the war effort and so he served at Fort Benning, Georgia as an infantry officer during court recesses.

On January 30, 1944, almost exactly one year before Soviet liberation of the Auschwitz death camp on January 27, 1945, Justice Murphy unveiled the formation of the National Committee Against Nazi Persecution and Extermination of the Jews. Serving as committee chair, he declared that it was created to combat Nazi propaganda &quot;breeding the germs of hatred against Jews.&quot; This announcement was made on the 11th anniversary of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s appointment as Chancellor of Germany. The eleven committee members included U.S. Vice President Henry Wallace, 1940 Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie and Henry St. George Tucker, Presiding Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church.

Murphy was among 12 nominated at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to serve as Roosevelt&#x27;s running mate in the presidential election that year. He acted as chairman of the National Committee against Nazi Persecution and Extermination of the Jews and of the Philippine War Relief Committee. The first committee was established in early 1944 to promote rescue of European Jews, and to combat antisemitism in the United States.

==Death and memory==
Murphy died in his sleep at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit on July 19, 1949, of a coronary thrombosis at the age of 59. Over 10,000 people attended his funeral in Detroit. He is buried in Our Lady of Lake Huron Catholic Cemetery in Sand Beach Township, Michigan, near Harbor Beach.
The Frank Murphy Hall of Justice was home to Detroit&#x27;s Recorder&#x27;s Court and now houses part of Michigan&#x27;s Third Judicial Circuit Court. There is a plaque in his honor on the first floor, which is recognized as a Michigan Legal Milestone.

Outside the Hall of Justice is Carl Milles&#x27;s statue &quot;The Hand of God&quot;. This rendition was cast in honor of Murphy and financed by the United Automobile Workers. It features a nude figure emerging from the left hand of God. Although commissioned in 1949 and completed by 1953, the work, partly because of the male nudity involved, was kept in storage for a decade and a half. The work was chosen in tribute to Murphy by Walter P. Reuther and Ira W. Jayne. It was placed on a pedestal in 1970 with the help of sculptor Marshall Fredericks, who was a Milles student.

Murphy is also honored with a museum in his home town, Harbor Beach, Michigan. Housed at his former residence, it contains numerous personal artifacts from his life and career, most notably from the Philippines. The Murphy Museum is open during the summer months, by appointment.

Murphy&#x27;s personal and official files are archived at the Bentley Historical Library of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and are open for research. This also includes an oral history project about Murphy. His correspondence and other official documents are deposited in libraries around the country.

In memory of Murphy, one of three University of Michigan Law School alumni to become a U.S. Supreme Court justice, Washington, D.C.–based attorney John H. Pickering, who was a law clerk for Murphy, donated a large sum of money to the law school as a remembrance, establishing the Frank Murphy Seminar Room.

Murphy was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Law degree by the University of Michigan in 1939.

The University of Detroit has a Frank Murphy Honor Society.

&quot;The Sweet Trials: Malice Aforethought&quot; is a play written by Arthur Beer, based on the trials of Ossian and Henry Sweet, and derived from Kevin Boyle&#x27;s &quot;Arc of Justice&quot;.

The Detroit Public Schools named Frank Murphy Elementary in his honor.

==Personal life==

Murphy never married or had children. He was the subject of &quot;[r]umors of homosexuality [...] all his adult life&quot;. According to &quot;Courting Justice: Gay Men and Lesbians v. The Supreme Court&quot;:
[a] gay reading of [biographies of Murphy] suggests that Murphy&#x27;s homosexuality was hiding in plain sight. For more than 40 years, Edward G. Kemp was Frank Murphy&#x27;s devoted, trusted companion. Like Murphy, Kemp was a lifelong bachelor. From college until Murphy&#x27;s death, the pair found creative ways to work and live together. [...] When Murphy appeared to have the better future in politics, Kemp stepped into a supportive, secondary role, much as Hillary Clinton would later do for Bill Clinton.

As well as Murphy&#x27;s close relationship with Kemp, Murphy&#x27;s biographer, historian Sidney Fine, found in Murphy&#x27;s personal papers a letter that &quot;if the words mean what they say, refers to a homosexual encounter some years earlier between Murphy and the writer.&quot; The writer of the letter implied that he and Murphy had become lovers while Murphy was governor-general and congratulated Murphy on his appointment to the Supreme Court.

Murphy did have at least two female companions of note. Ann Parker was frequently seen horseback riding with Murphy in Washington during his tenure as U.S. Attorney General, leading to speculation of a romance in the press. At the time of his death, Murphy was engaged to Joan Cuddihy; the wedding was scheduled for the following month.

<doc id="507305" wikidata="Q3344437" url="?curid=507305" title="Cement chemist notation">
<text>Cement chemist notation (CCN) was developed to simplify the formulas cement chemists use on a daily basis. It is a shorthand way of writing the chemical formula of oxides of calcium, silicon, and various metals.

==Abbreviations of oxides==

The main oxides present in cement (or in glass and ceramics) are abbreviated in the following way:

==Conversion of hydroxides in oxide and free water==
For the sake of mass balance calculations, hydroxides present in hydrated phases found in hardened cement paste, such as in portlandite, Ca(OH)2, must first be converted into oxide and water.

To better understand the conversion process of hydroxide anions in oxide and water, it is necessary to consider the autoprotolysis of the hydroxyl anions; it implies a proton exchange between two OH−, like in a classical acid–base reaction:
or also,
:2 OH− → O2− + H2O

For portlandite this gives thus the following mass balance:

:Ca(OH)2 → CaO + H2O

Thus portlandite can be written as CaO · H2O or CH.

==Main phases in Portland cement before and after hydration==

These oxides are used to build more complex compounds. The main crystalline phases described hereafter are related respectively to the composition of: 
* Clinker and non-hydrated Portland cement, and; 
* Hardened cement pastes obtained after hydration and cement setting.

===Clinker and non-hydrated Portland cement===

Four main phases are present in the clinker and in the non-hydrated Portland cement. They are formed at high temperature (1,450 °C) in the cement kiln and are the following:

The four compounds referred as C3S, C2S, C3A and C4AF are known as the main crystalline phases of Portland cement. The phase composition of a particular cement can be quantified through a complex set of calculation known as the Bogue formula.

To avoid the flash setting of concrete, due to the very fast hydration of the tricalcium aluminate (), calcium sulfate is interground with the cement clinker to prepare the cement powder. In cement chemist notation, (anhydrite) is abbreviated as C, and (gypsum) as CH2.

Similarly, in case of a limestone filler addition, , can be noted C.

===Hydrated cement paste===

Hydration products formed in hardened cement pastes (also known as HCPs) are more complicated, because many of these products have nearly the same formula and some are solid solutions with overlapping formulas. Some examples are given below:

The hyphens in C-S-H indicate a calcium silicate hydrate phase of variable composition, while &#x27;CSH&#x27; would indicate a calcium silicate phase, CaH2SiO4.

==Use in ceramics, glass, and oxide chemistry==
The cement chemist notation is not restricted to cement applications but is in fact a more general notation of oxide chemistry applicable to other domains than cement chemistry &quot;sensu stricto&quot;.

For instance, in ceramics applications, the kaolinite formula can also be written in terms of oxides, thus the corresponding formula for kaolinite, 
:Al2Si2O5(OH)4,

is
:Al2O3 · 2 SiO2 · 2 H2O

or in CCN
:AS2H2.

==Possible use of CCN in mineralogy==
Although not a very developed practice in mineralogy, some chemical reactions involving silicate and oxide in the melt or in hydrothermal systems, and silicate weathering processes could also be successfully described by applying the cement chemist notation to silicate mineralogy.

An example could be the formal comparison of belite hydration and forsterite serpentinisation dealing both with the hydration of two structurally similar earth -alkaline silicates, Ca2SiO4 and Mg2SiO4, respectively.

;Calcium system: belite hydration:

;Magnesium system: forsterite serpentinisation:

The ratio Ca/Si (C/S) and Mg/Si (M/S) decrease from 2 for the dicalcium and dimagnesium silicate reagents to 1.5 for the hydrated silicate products of the hydration reaction. In other term, the C-S-H or the serpentine are less rich in Ca and Mg respectively. This is why the reaction leads to the elimination of the excess of portlandite (Ca(OH)2) and brucite (Mg(OH)2), respectively, out of the silicate system, giving rise to the crystallization of both hydroxides as separate phases.

The rapid reaction of belite hydration in the setting of cement is formally &quot;chemically analogue&quot; to the slow natural hydration of forsterite (the magnesium end-member of olivine) leading to the formation of serpentine and brucite in nature. However, the kinetic of hydration of poorly crystallized artificial belite is much swifter than the slow conversion/weathering of well crystallized Mg-olivine under natural conditions.

This comparison suggests that mineralogists could probably also benefit from the concise formalism of the cement chemist notation in their works.

<doc id="507318" wikidata="Q2597432" url="?curid=507318" title="Battle of Modon (1500)">
<text>The Battle of Modon, aka the Second Battle of Lepanto, took place in August 1500 during the war of 1499–1503 between the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Venice. The Ottomans, who had won the Battle of Zonchio (First Battle of Lepanto / Battle of Sapienza) the previous year, were again victorious under Admiral Kemal Reis.

In December 1499, the Venetians attacked Lepanto with the hope of regaining the territories which they lost with the Battle of Zonchio. Kemal Reis set sail from Cefalonia and retook Lepanto from the Venetians. He stayed in Lepanto between April and May 1500, where his ships were repaired by an army of 15,000 Ottoman craftsmen who were brought from the area. From there Kemal Reis set sail and bombarded the Venetian ports on the island of Corfu, and in August 1500 he once again defeated the Venetian fleet. He bombarded the fortress of Modon from the sea and captured the town. He later engaged with the Venetian fleet off the coast of Coron and captured the town along with a Venetian brigantine. From there he sailed towards the Island of Sapientza (Sapienza) and sank the Venetian galley &quot;Lezza&quot;. In September 1500, Kemal Reis assaulted Voiussa and in October he appeared at Cape Santa Maria on the Island of Lefkada before ending the campaign and returning to Constantinople in November.

With the Battle of Modon, the Ottoman fleet and army quickly overwhelmed most of the Venetian possessions in Greece.

Modon and Coron, the &quot;two eyes of the Republic&quot;, were lost. Ottoman cavalry raids reached Venetian territory in northern Italy, and, in 1503, Venice again had to seek peace, recognizing Ottoman gains.

<text>Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is a protein that, in humans, is encoded by the &quot;SNCA&quot; gene. Alpha-synuclein is a neuronal protein that regulates synaptic vesicle trafficking and subsequent neurotransmitter release.

It is abundant in the brain, while smaller amounts are found in the heart, muscle and other tissues. In the brain, alpha-synuclein is found mainly in the axon terminals of presynaptic neurons. Within these terminals, alpha-synuclein interacts with phospholipids and proteins. Presynaptic terminals release chemical messengers, called neurotransmitters, from compartments known as synaptic vesicles. The release of neurotransmitters relays signals between neurons and is critical for normal brain function.

In Parkinson&#x27;s disease and other synucleinopathies, insoluble forms of alpha-synuclein accumulate as inclusions in Lewy bodies.

Familial Parkinson&#x27;s disease is associated with mutations in the -synuclein (&quot;SNCA&quot;) gene. In the process of seeded nucleation, alpha-synuclein acquires a cross-sheet structure similar to other amyloids.

The human alpha-synuclein protein is made of 140 amino acids. An alpha-synuclein fragment, known as the non-amyloid beta (non-Abeta) component (NAC) of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease amyloid, originally found in an amyloid-enriched fraction, was shown to be a fragment of its precursor protein, NACP. It was later determined that NACP is the human homologue of synuclein in electric rays, genus &quot;Torpedo&quot;. Therefore, NACP is now referred to as human alpha-synuclein.

== Tissue expression ==

Alpha-synuclein is a synuclein protein primarily found in neural tissue, making up as much as one percent of all proteins in the cytosol of brain cells. It is expressed highly in neurons within the frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and olfactory bulb, but can also be found in the non-neuronal glial cells. In melanocytes, SNCA protein expression may be regulated by microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF).

It has been established that alpha-synuclein is extensively localized in the nucleus of mammalian brain neurons, suggesting a role of alpha-synuclein in the nucleus. Synuclein is however found predominantly in the presynaptic termini, in both free or membrane-bound forms, with roughly 15% of synuclein being membrane-bound at any moment in neurons.

It has also been shown that alpha-synuclein is localized in neuronal mitochondria. Alpha-synuclein is highly expressed in the mitochondria in olfactory bulb, hippocampus, striatum and thalamus, where the cytosolic alpha-synuclein is also rich. However, the cerebral cortex and cerebellum are
two exceptions, which contain rich cytosolic alpha-synuclein but very low levels of mitochondrial alpha-synuclein. It has been shown that alpha-synuclein is localized in the inner membrane of mitochondria, and that the inhibitory effect of alpha-synuclein on complex I activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is dose-dependent. Thus, it is suggested that alpha-synuclein in mitochondria is differentially expressed in different brain regions and the background levels of mitochondrial alpha-synuclein may be a potential factor affecting mitochondrial function and predisposing some neurons to degeneration.

At least three isoforms of synuclein are produced through alternative splicing. The majority form of the protein, and the one most investigated, is the full-length protein of 140 amino acids. Other isoforms are alpha-synuclein-126, which lacks residues 41-54 due to loss of exon 3; and alpha-synuclein-112, which lacks residues 103-130 due to loss of exon 5.

=== In the enteric nervous system (ENS) ===
First characterisations of aSyn aggregates in the ENS of PD patients has been performed on autopsied specimens in the late 1980s. It is yet unknown if the microbiome changes associated with PD are consequential to the illness process or main pathophysiology, or both.

Individuals diagnosed with various synucleinopathies often display constipation and other GI dysfunctions years prior to the onset of movement dysfunction.

Alpha synuclein potentially connects the gut-brain axis in Parkinson&#x27;s disease patients. Common inherited Parkinson disease is associated with mutations in the alpha-synuclein (SNCA) gene. In the process of seeded nucleation, alpha-synuclein acquires a cross-sheet structure similar to other amyloids.

The &quot;Enterobacteriaceae&quot;, which are quite common in the human gut, can create curli, which are functional amyloid proteins. The unfolded amyloid CsgA, which is secreted by bacteria and later aggregates extracellularly to create biofilms, mediates adherence to epithelial cells, and aids in bacteriophage defense, forms the curli fibers. Oral injection of curli-producing bacteria can also boost formation and aggregation of the amyloid protein Syn in old rats and nematodes. Host inflammation responses in the intestinal tract and periphery are modulated by curli exposure. Studies in biochemistry show that endogenous, bacterial chaperones of curli are capable of briefly interacting with Syn and controlling its aggregation.

The clinical and pathological findings support the hypothesis that aSyn disease in PD occurs via a gut-brain pathway. For early diagnosis and early management in the phase of creation and propagation of aSyn, it is therefore of utmost importance to identify pathogenic aSyn in the digestive system, for example, by gastrointestinal tract (GIT) biopsies.

According to a growing body of research, intestinal dysbiosis may be a major factor in the development of Parkinson&#x27;s disease by encouraging intestinal permeability, gastrointestinal inflammation, and the aggregation and spread of asyn.

Not just the CNS but other peripheral tissues, such as the GIT, have physiological aSyn expression as well as its phosphorylated variants. As suggested by Borghammer and Van Den Berge (2019), one approach is to recognise the possibility of PD subtypes with various aSyn propagation methods, including either a peripheral nervous system (PNS)-first or a CNS-first route.

While the GI tract has been linked to other neurological disorders such autism spectrum disorder, depression, anxiety, and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, protein aggregation and/or inflammation in the gut represent a new topic of investigation in synucleinopathies.

== Structure ==

Alpha-synuclein in solution is considered to be an intrinsically disordered protein, i.e. it lacks a single stable 3D structure. As of 2014, an increasing number of reports suggest, however, the presence of partial structures or mostly structured oligomeric states in the solution structure of alpha-synuclein even in the absence of lipids. This trend is also supported by a large number of single molecule (optical tweezers) measurements on single copies of monomeric alpha-synuclein as well as covalently enforced dimers or tetramers of alpha-synuclein.

Alpha-synuclein is specifically upregulated in a discrete population of presynaptic terminals of the brain during a period of acquisition-related synaptic rearrangement. It has been shown that alpha-synuclein significantly interacts with tubulin, and that alpha-synuclein may have activity as a potential microtubule-associated protein, like tau. Evidence suggests that alpha-synuclein functions as a molecular chaperone in the formation of SNARE complexes. In particular, it simultaneously binds to phospholipids of the plasma membrane via its N-terminus domain and to synaptobrevin-2 via its C-terminus domain, with increased importance during synaptic activity. Indeed, there is growing evidence that alpha-synuclein is involved in the functioning of the neuronal Golgi apparatus and vesicle trafficking.

Apparently, alpha-synuclein is essential for normal development of the cognitive functions. Knock-out mice with the targeted inactivation of the expression of alpha-synuclein show impaired spatial learning and working memory.

=== Interaction with lipid membranes ===

Experimental evidence has been collected on the interaction of alpha-synuclein with membrane and its involvement with membrane composition and turnover. Yeast genome screening has found that several genes that deal with lipid metabolism and mitochondrial fusion play a role in alpha-synuclein toxicity. Conversely, alpha-synuclein expression levels can affect the viscosity and the relative amount of fatty acids in the lipid bilayer.

Alpha-synuclein is known to directly bind to lipid membranes, associating with the negatively charged surfaces of phospholipids. Alpha-synuclein forms an extended helical structure on small unilamellar vesicles. A preferential binding to small vesicles has been found. The binding of alpha-synuclein to lipid membranes has complex effects on the latter, altering the bilayer structure and leading to the formation of small vesicles. Alpha-synuclein has been shown to bend membranes of negatively charged phospholipid vesicles and form tubules from large lipid vesicles. Using cryo-EM it was shown that these are micellar tubes of ~5-6 nm diameter. Alpha-synuclein has also been shown to form lipid disc-like particles similar to apolipoproteins. EPR studies have shown that the structure of alpha synuclein is dependent on the binding surface. The protein adopts a broken-helical conformation on lipoprotein particles while it forms an extended helical structure on lipid vesicles and membrane tubes. Studies have also suggested a possible antioxidant activity of alpha-synuclein in the membrane. 
 Membrane interaction of alpha-synuclein modulates or affects its rate of aggregation. The membrane-mediated modulation of aggregation is very similar to that observed for other amyloid proteins such as IAPP and abeta. Aggregated states of alpha-synuclein permeate the membrane of lipid vesicles. They are formed upon interaction with peroxidation-prone polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) but not with monounsaturated fatty acids and the binding of lipid autoxidation-promoting transition metals such as iron or copper provokes oligomerization of alpha-synuclein. The aggregated alpha-synuclein has a specific activity for peroxidized lipids and induces lipid autoxidation in PUFA-rich membranes of both neurons and astrocytes, decreasing resistance to apoptosis. Lipid autoxidation is inhibited if the cells are pre-incubated with isotope-reinforced PUFAs (D-PUFA).

== Function ==

Although the function of alpha-synuclein is not well understood, studies suggest that it plays a role in restricting the mobility of synaptic vesicles, consequently attenuating synaptic vesicle recycling and neurotransmitter release. An alternate view is that alpha-synuclein binds to VAMP2 (a synaptobrevin) and stabilizes SNARE complexes; though recent studies indicate that alpha-synuclein–VAMP2 binding is critical for alpha-synuclein-mediated attenuation of synaptic vesicle recycling, connecting the two seemingly divergent views. It may also help regulate the release of dopamine, a type of neurotransmitter that is critical for controlling the start and stop of voluntary and involuntary movements.

Alpha-synuclein modulates DNA repair processes, including repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs). DNA damage response markers co-localize with alpha-synuclein to form discrete foci in human cells and mouse brain. Depletion of alpha-synuclein in human cells causes increased introduction of DNA DSBs after exposure to bleomycin and reduced ability to repair these DSBs. In addition, alpha-synuclein knockout mice display a higher level of DSBs, and this problem can be alleviated by transgenic reintroduction of human alpha-synuclein. Alpha-synuclein promotes the DSB repair pathway referred to as non-homologous end joining. The DNA repair function of alpha-synuclein appears to be compromised in Lewy body inclusion bearing neurons, and this may trigger cell death.

===Proneurogenic function of alpha-synuclein===
In some neurodegenerative diseases, alpha-synuclein produces insoluble inclusion bodies. These diseases, known as synucleinopathies, are connected with either higher levels of normal alpha-synuclein or its mutant variants. The normal physiological role of Snca, however, has not yet been thoroughly explained. In fact, physiological Snca has been demonstrated to have a neuroprotective impact by inhibiting apoptosis induced by several types of apoptotic stimuli, or by regulating the expression of proteins involved in apoptotic pathways.
Recently it has been demonstrated that up-regulation of alpha-synuclein in the dentate gyrus (a neurogenic niche where new neurons are generated throughout life) activates stem cells, in a model of premature neural aging. This model shows reduced expression of alpha-synuclein and reduced proliferation of stem cells, as is physiologically observed during aging. Exogenous alpha-synuclein in the dentate gyrus is able to rescue this defect. Moreover, alpha-synuclein also boosts the proliferation of dentate gyrus progenitor neural cells in wild-type young mice. Thus, alpha-synuclein represents an effector for neural stem and progenitor cell activation.
Similarly, alpha-synuclein has been found to be required to maintain stem cells of the SVZ (subventricular zone, i.e., another neurogenic niche) in a cycling state.

== Sequence ==

Alpha-synuclein primary structure is usually divided in three distinct domains:
* Residues 1-60: An amphipathic N-terminal region dominated by four 11-residue repeats including the consensus sequence KTKEGV. This sequence has a structural alpha helix propensity similar to apolipoproteins-binding domains. It is a highly conserved terminal that interacts with acidic lipid membranes, and all the discovered point mutations of the SNCA gene are located within this terminal.
* Residues 61-95: A central hydrophobic region which includes the &quot;non-amyloid-β component&quot; (NAC) region, involved in protein aggregation. This domain is unique to alpha-synuclein among the synuclein family.
* Residues 96-140: a highly acidic and proline-rich region which has no distinct structural propensity. This domain plays an important role in the function, solubility and interaction of alpha-synuclein with other proteins.

== Autoproteolytic activity ==

The use of high-resolution ion-mobility mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) on HPLC-purified alpha-synuclein &quot;in vitro&quot; has shown alpha-synuclein to be autoproteolytic (self-proteolytic), generating a variety of small molecular weight fragments upon incubation. The 14.46 kDa protein was found to generate numerous smaller fragments, including 12.16 kDa (amino acids 14–133) and 10.44 kDa (40–140) fragments formed through C- and N-terminal truncation and a 7.27 kDa C-terminal fragment (72–140). The 7.27 kDa fragment, which contains the majority of the NAC region, aggregated considerably faster than full-length alpha-synuclein. It is possible that these autoproteolytic products play a role as intermediates or cofactors in the aggregation of alpha-synuclein &quot;in vivo&quot;.

== Clinical significance ==
Alpha synuclein, having no single, well-defined tertiary structure, is an intrinsically disordered protein, with a pI value of 4.7, which, under certain pathological conditions, can misfold in a way that exposes its core hydrophobic residues to the intracellular milieu, thus providing the opportunity for hydrophobic interactions to occur with a similar, equally exposed protein. This could lead to self assembly and subsequent aggregation into large, insoluble fibrils known as amyloids. The conversion of soluble alpha synuclein into highly ordered, cross-β sheet, fibrillar structures does not, as previously thought, follow a two-step mechanism, rather, occurs through a series of transient, soluble oligomeric intermediates. In 2011, two groups published their findings that unmutated α-synuclein forms a stably folded tetramer that resists aggregation, asserting that this folded tetramer represented the relevant in vivo structure in cells, thereby relieving alpha synuclein of its disordered status. Proponents of the tetramer hypothesis argued that in vivo cross-linking in bacteria, primary neurons and human erythroleukemia cells confirmed the presence of labile, tetrameric species. However, despite numerous in-cell NMR reports demonstrating that alpha synuclein is indeed monomeric and disordered in intact E. coli cells, it is still a matter of debate in the field despite an ever growing mountain of conflicting reports. Nevertheless, alpha-synuclein aggregates to form insoluble fibrils in pathological conditions characterized by Lewy bodies, such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. These disorders are known as synucleinopathies. In vitro models of synucleinopathies revealed that aggregation of alpha-synuclein may lead to various cellular disorders including microtubule impairment, synaptic and mitochondrial dysfunctions, oxidative stress as well as dysregulation of Calcium signaling, proteasomal and lysosomal pathway. Alpha-synuclein is the primary structural component of Lewy body fibrils. Occasionally, Lewy bodies contain tau protein; however, alpha-synuclein and tau constitute two distinctive subsets of filaments in the same inclusion bodies. Alpha-synuclein pathology is also found in both sporadic and familial cases with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

The aggregation mechanism of alpha-synuclein is uncertain. There is evidence of a structured intermediate rich in beta structure that can be the precursor of aggregation and, ultimately, Lewy bodies. A single molecule study in 2008 suggests alpha-synuclein exists as a mix of unstructured, alpha-helix, and beta-sheet-rich conformers in equilibrium. Mutations or buffer conditions known to improve aggregation strongly increase the population of the beta conformer, thus suggesting this could be a conformation related to pathogenic aggregation. One theory is that the majority of alpha-synuclein aggregates are located in the presynapse as smaller deposits which causes synaptic dysfunction. Among the strategies for treating synucleinopathies are compounds that inhibit aggregation of alpha-synuclein. It has been shown that the small molecule cuminaldehyde inhibits fibrillation of alpha-synuclein.
The Epstein-Barr virus has been implicated in these disorders.

In rare cases of familial forms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, there is a mutation in the gene coding for alpha-synuclein. Five point mutations have been identified thus far: A53T, A30P, E46K, H50Q, and G51D; however, in total, nineteen mutations in the SNCA gene have been associated with parkinsonism: A18T, A29S, A53E, A53V, E57A, V15A, T72M, L8I, V15D, M127I, P117S, M5T, G93A, E83Q, and A30G.

It has been reported that some mutations influence the initiation and amplification steps of the aggregation process. Genomic duplication and triplication of the gene appear to be a rare cause of Parkinson&#x27;s disease in other lineages, although more common than point mutations. Hence certain mutations of alpha-synuclein may cause it to form amyloid-like fibrils that contribute to Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Over-expression of human wild-type or A53T-mutant alpha-synuclein in primates drives deposition of alpha-synuclein in the ventral midbrain, degeneration of the dopaminergic system and impaired motor performance. Although the accumulation and aggregation of alpha-synuclein in most Parkinson&#x27;s disease patients primarily result from posttranscriptional mechanisms, targeting its production remains a potential therapeutic approach. Research indicates that microRNA-7 and the naturally occurring small molecule quercetin can reduce alpha-synuclein levels under experimental conditions.

Certain sections of the alpha-synuclein protein may play a role in the tauopathies.

A prion form of the protein alpha-synuclein may be a causal agent for the disease multiple system atrophy.

Self-replicating &quot;prion-like&quot; amyloid assemblies of alpha-synuclein have been described that are invisible to the amyloid dye Thioflavin T and that can acutely spread in neurons in vitro and in vivo. 
Antibodies against alpha-synuclein have replaced antibodies against ubiquitin as the gold standard for immunostaining of Lewy bodies. The central panel in the figure to the right shows the major pathway for protein aggregation. Monomeric α-synuclein is natively unfolded in solution but can also bind to membranes in an α-helical form. It seems likely that these two species exist in equilibrium within the cell, although this is unproven. From in vitro work, it is clear that unfolded monomer can aggregate first into small oligomeric species that can be stabilized by β-sheet-like interactions and then into higher molecular weight insoluble fibrils. In a cellular context, there is some evidence that the presence of lipids can promote oligomer formation: α-synuclein can also form annular, pore-like structures that interact with membranes. The deposition of α-synuclein into pathological structures such as Lewy bodies is probably a late event that occurs in some neurons. On the left hand side are some of the known modifiers of this process. Electrical activity in neurons changes the association of α-synuclein with vesicles and may also stimulate polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2), which has been shown to phosphorylate α-synuclein at Ser129. Other kinases have also been proposed to be involved. As well as phosphorylation, truncation through proteases such as calpains, and nitration, probably through nitric oxide (NO) or other reactive nitrogen species that are present during inflammation, all modify synuclein such that it has a higher tendency to aggregate. The addition of ubiquitin (shown as a black spot) to Lewy bodies is probably a secondary process to deposition. On the right are some of the proposed cellular targets for α-synuclein mediated toxicity, which include (from top to bottom) ER-golgi transport, synaptic vesicles, mitochondria and lysosomes and other proteolytic machinery. In each of these cases, it is proposed that α-synuclein has detrimental effects, listed below each arrow, although at this time it is not clear if any of these are either necessary or sufficient for toxicity in neurons.

<text>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), also known as matrix metallopeptidases or matrixins, are metalloproteinases that are calcium-dependent zinc-containing endopeptidases; other family members are adamalysins, serralysins, and astacins. The MMPs belong to a larger family of proteases known as the metzincin superfamily.

Collectively, these enzymes are capable of degrading all kinds of extracellular matrix proteins, but also can process a number of bioactive molecules. They are known to be involved in the cleavage of cell surface receptors, the release of apoptotic ligands (such as the FAS ligand), and chemokine/cytokine inactivation. MMPs are also thought to play a major role in cell behaviors such as cell proliferation, migration (adhesion/dispersion), differentiation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and host defense.

They were first described in vertebrates in 1962, including humans, but have since been found in invertebrates and plants. They are distinguished from other endopeptidases by their dependence on metal ions as cofactors, their ability to degrade extracellular matrix, and their specific evolutionary DNA sequence.

==History==
MMPs were described initially by Jerome Gross and Charles Lapiere in 1962, who observed enzymatic activity (collagen triple helix degradation) during tadpole tail metamorphosis (by placing a tadpole tail in a collagen matrix plate). Therefore, the enzyme was named interstitial collagenase (MMP-1).

Later, it was purified from human skin (1968), and was recognized to be synthesized as a zymogen.

The &quot;cysteine switch&quot; was described in 1990.

==Structure==
The MMPs have a common domain structure. The three common domains are the pro-peptide, the catalytic domain, and the haemopexin-like C-terminal domain, which is linked to the catalytic domain by a flexible hinge region.

===The pro-peptide===
The MMPs are initially synthesized as inactive zymogens with a pro-peptide domain that must be removed before the enzyme is active. The pro-peptide domain is part of the &quot;cysteine switch.&quot; This contains a conserved cysteine residue that interacts with the zinc in the active site and prevents binding and cleavage of the substrate, keeping the enzyme in an inactive form. In the majority of the MMPs, the cysteine residue is in the conserved sequence PRCGxPD. Some MMPs have a prohormone convertase cleavage site (Furin-like) as part of this domain, which, when cleaved, activates the enzyme. MMP-23A and MMP-23B include a transmembrane segment in this domain.

===The catalytic domain===
X-ray crystallographic structures of several MMP catalytic domains have shown that this domain is an oblate sphere measuring 35 x 30 x 30 Å (3.5 × 3 x 3 nm). The active site is a 20 Å (2 nm) groove that runs across the catalytic domain. In the part of the catalytic domain forming the active site there is a catalytically important Zn2+ ion, which is bound by three histidine residues found in the conserved sequence HExxHxxGxxH. Hence, this sequence is a zinc-binding motif.

The gelatinases, such as MMP-2, incorporate Fibronectin type II modules inserted immediately before in the zinc-binding motif in the catalytic domain.

===The hinge region===
The catalytic domain is connected to the C-terminal domain by a flexible hinge or linker region. This is up to 75 amino acids long, and has no determinable structure.

===The hemopexin-like C-terminal domain===

The C-terminal domain has structural similarities to the serum protein hemopexin. It has a four-bladed β-propeller structure. β-Propeller structures provide a large flat surface that is thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions. This determines substrate specificity and is the site for interaction with TIMP&#x27;s (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases). The hemopexin-like domain is absent in MMP-7, MMP-23, MMP-26, and the plant and nematode. The membrane-bound MMPs (MT-MMPs) are anchored to the plasma membrane via a transmembrane or a GPI-anchoring domain.

==Catalytic mechanism==

There are three catalytic mechanisms published.

* In the first mechanism, Browner M.F. and colleagues proposed the base-catalysis mechanism, carried out by the conserved glutamate residue and the Zn2+ ion.
* In the second mechanism, the Matthews-mechanism, Kester and Matthews suggested an interaction between a water molecule and the Zn2+ ion during the acid-base catalysis.
*In the third mechanism, the Manzetti-mechanism, Manzetti Sergio and colleagues provided evidence that a coordination between water and zinc during catalysis was unlikely, and suggested a third mechanism wherein a histidine from the HExxHxxGxxH-motif participates in catalysis by allowing the Zn2+ ion to assume a quasi-penta coordinated state, via its dissociation from it. In this state, the Zn2+ ion is coordinated with the two oxygen atoms from the catalytic glutamic acid, the substrate&#x27;s carbonyl oxygen atom, and the two histidine residues, and can polarize the glutamic acid&#x27;s oxygen atom, proximate the scissile bond, and induce it to act as reversible electron donor. This forms an oxyanion transition state. At this stage, a water molecule acts on the dissociated scissile bond and completes the hydrolyzation of the substrate.

==Classification==

The MMPs can be subdivided in different ways.

===Evolutionary===

Use of bioinformatic methods to compare the primary sequences of the MMPs suggest the following evolutionary groupings of the MMPs: 
* MMP-19
* MMPs 11, 14, 15, 16, and 17
* MMP-2 and MMP-9
* All the other MMPs

Analysis of the catalytic domains in isolation suggests that the catalytic domains evolved further once the major groups had differentiated, as is also indicated by the substrate specificities of the enzymes.

===Functional===
The most commonly used groupings (by researchers in MMP biology) are based partly on historical assessment of the substrate specificity of the MMP and partly on the cellular localization of the MMP. These groups are the collagenases, the gelatinases, the stromelysins, and the membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs).

* The collagenases are capable of degrading triple-helical fibrillar collagens into distinctive 3/4 and 1/4 fragments. These collagens are the major components of bone, cartilage and dentin, and MMPs are the only known mammalian enzymes capable of degrading them. The collagenases are No. 1, No. 8, No. 13, and No. 18. In addition, No. 14 has also been shown to cleave fibrillar collagen, and there is evidence that No. 2 is capable of collagenolysis. In MeSH, the current list of collagenases includes No. 1, No. 2, No. 8, No. 9, and No. 13. Collagenase No. 14 is present in MeSH but not listed as a collagenase, while No. 18 is absent from MeSH.
* The main substrates of the gelatinases are type IV collagen and gelatin, and these enzymes are distinguished by the presence of an additional domain inserted into the catalytic domain. This gelatin-binding region is positioned immediately before the zinc-binding motif, and forms a separate folding unit that does not disrupt the structure of the catalytic domain. The gelatinases are No. 2 and No. 9.
* The stromelysins display a broad ability to cleave extracellular matrix proteins but are unable to cleave the triple-helical fibrillar collagens. The three canonical members of this group are No. 3, No. 10, and No. 11.
* All six membrane-type MMPs (No. 14, No. 15, No. 16, No. 17, No. 24, and No. 25) have a furin cleavage site in the pro-peptide, which is a feature also shared by No. 11.

However, it is becoming increasingly clear that these divisions are somewhat artificial as there are a number of MMPs that do not fit into any of the traditional groups.

===Genes===

Matrix metalloproteinases combines with the metal binding protein, metallothionine; thus helping in metal binding mechanism.

==Function==
The MMPs play an important role in tissue remodeling associated with various physiological or pathological processes such as morphogenesis, angiogenesis, tissue repair, cirrhosis, arthritis, and metastasis. MMP-2 and MMP-9 are thought to be important in metastasis. MMP-1 is thought to be important in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Recent data suggests active role of MMPs in the pathogenesis of Aortic Aneurysm. Excess MMPs degrade the structural proteins of the aortic wall. Disregulation of the balance between MMPs and TIMPs is also a characteristic of acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases.

==Activation==

 All MMPs are synthesized in the latent form (Zymogen). They are secreted as proenzymes and require extracellular activation. They can be activated in vitro by many mechanisms including organomercurials, chaotropic agents, and other proteases.

==Inhibitors==
The MMPs are inhibited by specific endogenous tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which comprise a family of four protease inhibitors: TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, and TIMP-4.

Synthetic inhibitors generally contain a chelating group that binds the catalytic zinc atom at the MMP active site tightly. Common chelating groups include hydroxamates, carboxylates, thiols, and phosphinyls. Hydroxymates are particularly potent inhibitors of MMPs and other zinc-dependent enzymes, due to their bidentate chelation of the zinc atom. Other substituents of these inhibitors are usually designed to interact with various binding pockets on the MMP of interest, making the inhibitor more or less specific for given MMPs.

===Pharmacology===
Doxycycline, at subantimicrobial doses, inhibits MMP activity, and has been used in various experimental systems for this purpose, such as for recalcitrant recurrent corneal erosions. It is used clinically for the treatment of periodontal disease and is the only MMP inhibitor that is widely available clinically. It is sold under the trade name Periostat by the company CollaGenex. Minocycline, another tetracycline antibiotic, has also been shown to inhibit MMP activity.

A number of rationally designed MMP inhibitors have shown some promise in the treatment of pathologies that MMPs are suspected to be involved in (see above). However, most of these, such as marimastat (BB-2516), a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, and cipemastat (Ro 32-3555), an MMP-1 selective inhibitor, have performed poorly in clinical trials. The failure of Marimastat was partially responsible for the folding of British Biotech, which developed it. The failure of these drugs has been due largely to toxicity (in particular, musculo-skeletal toxicity in the case of broad spectrum inhibitors) and failure to show expected results (in the case of trocade, promising results in rabbit arthritis models were not replicated in human trials). The reasons behind the largely disappointing clinical results of MMP inhibitors is unclear, especially in light of their activity in animal models.

<text>In biochemistry, immunostaining is any use of an antibody-based method to detect a specific protein in a sample. The term &quot;immunostaining&quot; was originally used to refer to the immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections, as first described by Albert Coons in 1941. However, immunostaining now encompasses a broad range of techniques used in histology, cell biology, and molecular biology that use antibody-based staining methods.

==Techniques==

=== Immunohistochemistry ===

Immunohistochemistry or IHC staining of tissue sections (or immunocytochemistry, which is the staining of cells), is perhaps the most commonly applied immunostaining technique. While the first cases of IHC staining used fluorescent dyes (see &quot;immunofluorescence&quot;), other non-fluorescent methods using enzymes such as peroxidase (see &quot;immunoperoxidase staining&quot;) and alkaline phosphatase are now used. These enzymes are capable of catalysing reactions that give a coloured product that is easily detectable by light microscopy. Alternatively, radioactive elements can be used as labels, and the immunoreaction can be visualized by autoradiography.

Tissue preparation or &quot;fixation&quot; is essential for the preservation of cell morphology and tissue architecture. Inappropriate or prolonged fixation may significantly diminish the antibody binding capability. Many antigens can be successfully demonstrated in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. However, some antigens will not survive even moderate amounts of aldehyde fixation. Under these conditions, tissues should be rapidly fresh frozen in liquid nitrogen and cut with a cryostat. The disadvantages of frozen sections include poor morphology, poor resolution at higher magnifications, difficulty in cutting over paraffin sections, and the need for frozen storage. Alternatively, vibratome sections do not require the tissue to be processed through organic solvents or high heat, which can destroy the antigenicity, or disrupted by freeze thawing. The disadvantage of vibratome sections is that the sectioning process is slow and difficult with soft and poorly fixed tissues, and that chatter marks or vibratome lines are often apparent in the sections.

The detection of many antigens can be dramatically improved by &quot;antigen retrieval&quot; methods that act by breaking some of the protein cross-links formed by fixation to uncover hidden antigenic sites. This can be accomplished by heating for varying lengths of times (heat induced epitope retrieval or HIER) or using enzyme digestion (proteolytic induced epitope retrieval or PIER).

One of the main difficulties with IHC staining is overcoming specific or non-specific background. Optimisation of fixation methods and times, pre-treatment with blocking agents, incubating antibodies with high salt, and optimising post-antibody wash buffers and wash times are all important for obtaining high quality immunostaining. In addition, the presence of both positive and negative controls for staining are essential for determining specificity.

===Flow cytometry===

A flow cytometer can be used for the direct analysis of cells expressing one or more specific proteins. Cells are immunostained in solution using methods similar to those used for immunofluorescence, and then analysed by flow cytometry.

Flow cytometry has several advantages over IHC including: the ability to define distinct cell populations by their size and granularity; the capacity to gate out dead cells; improved sensitivity; and multi-colour analysis to measure several antigens simultaneously. However, flow cytometry can be less effective at detecting extremely rare cell populations, and there is a loss of architectural relationships in the absence of a tissue section. Flow cytometry also has a high capital cost associated with the purchase of a flow cytometer.

===Western blotting===
Western blotting allows the detection of specific proteins from extracts made from cells or tissues, before or after any purification steps. Proteins are generally separated by size using gel electrophoresis before being transferred to a synthetic membrane via dry, semi-dry, or wet blotting methods. The membrane can then be probed using antibodies using methods similar to immunohistochemistry, but without a need for fixation. Detection is typically performed using peroxidase linked antibodies to catalyse a chemiluminescent reaction.

Western blotting is a routine molecular biology method that can be used to semi-quantitatively compare protein levels between extracts. The size separation prior to blotting allows the protein molecular weight to be gauged as compared with known molecular weight markers.

===Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay===

The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or ELISA is a diagnostic method for quantitatively or semi-quantitatively determining protein concentrations from blood plasma, serum or cell/tissue extracts in a multi-well plate format (usually 96-wells per plate). Broadly, proteins in solution are absorbed to ELISA plates. Antibodies specific for the protein of interest are used to probe the plate. Background is minimised by optimising blocking and washing methods (as for IHC), and specificity is ensured via the presence of positive and negative controls. Detection methods are usually colorimetric or chemiluminescence based.

===Immuno-electron microscopy===

Electron microscopy or EM can be used to study the detailed microarchitecture of tissues or cells. Immuno-EM allows the detection of specific proteins in ultrathin tissue sections. Antibodies labelled with heavy metal particles (e.g. gold) can be directly visualised using transmission electron microscopy. While powerful in detecting the sub-cellular localisation of a protein, immuno-EM can be technically challenging, expensive, and require rigorous optimisation of tissue fixation and processing methods. Protein biotinylation &quot;in vivo&quot; was proposed to alleviate the problems caused by frequent incompatibility of antibody staining with fixation protocols that better preserve cell morphology.

==Methodological overview==
In immunostaining methods, an antibody is used to detect a specific protein epitope. These antibodies can be &quot;monoclonal&quot; or &quot;polyclonal&quot;. Detection of this first or &quot;primary antibody&quot; can be accomplished in multiple ways.
* The primary antibody can be directly labeled using an enzyme or fluorophore.
* The primary antibody can be labeled using a small molecule which interacts with a high affinity binding partner that can be linked to an enzyme or fluorophore. The biotin-streptavidin is one commonly used high affinity interaction.
* The primary antibody can be probed for using a broader species-specific &quot;secondary antibody&quot; that is labeled using an enzyme, or fluorophore.
* In the case of electron microscopy, antibodies are linked to a heavy metal particle (typically gold nanoparticles in the range 5-15nm diameter).

As previously described, enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase are commonly used to catalyse reactions that give a coloured or chemiluminescent product. Fluorescent molecules can be visualised using &quot;fluorescence microscopy&quot; or &quot;confocal microscopy&quot;.

==Applications==
The applications of immunostaining are numerous, but are most typically used in &quot;clinical diagnostics&quot; and &quot;laboratory research&quot;.

Clinically, IHC is used in histopathology for the diagnosis of specific types of cancers based on molecular markers.

In laboratory science, immunostaining can be used for a variety of applications based on investigating the presence or absence of a protein, its tissue distribution, its sub-cellular localisation, and of changes in protein expression or degradation.

<text>In molecular biology, a riboswitch is a regulatory segment of a messenger RNA molecule that binds a small molecule, resulting in a change in production of the proteins encoded by the mRNA. Thus, an mRNA that contains a riboswitch is directly involved in regulating its own activity, in response to the concentrations of its effector molecule. The discovery that modern organisms use RNA to bind small molecules, and discriminate against closely related analogs, expanded the known natural capabilities of RNA beyond its ability to code for proteins, catalyze reactions, or to bind other RNA or protein macromolecules.

The original definition of the term &quot;riboswitch&quot; specified that they directly sense small-molecule metabolite concentrations. Although this definition remains in common use, some biologists have used a broader definition that includes other cis-regulatory RNAs. However, this article will discuss only metabolite-binding riboswitches.

Most known riboswitches occur in bacteria, but functional riboswitches of one type (the TPP riboswitch) have been discovered in archaea, plants and certain fungi. TPP riboswitches have also been predicted in archaea, but have not been experimentally tested.

==History and discovery==

Prior to the discovery of riboswitches, the mechanism by which some genes involved in multiple metabolic pathways were regulated remained mysterious. Accumulating evidence increasingly suggested the then-unprecedented idea that the mRNAs involved might bind metabolites directly, to affect their own regulation. These data included conserved RNA secondary structures often found in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of the relevant genes and the success of procedures to create artificial small molecule-binding RNAs called aptamers. In 2002, the first comprehensive proofs of multiple classes of riboswitches were published, including protein-free binding assays, and metabolite-binding riboswitches were established as a new mechanism of gene regulation.

Many of the earliest riboswitches to be discovered corresponded to conserved sequence &quot;motifs&quot; (patterns) in 5&#x27; UTRs that appeared to correspond to a structured RNA. For example, comparative analysis of upstream regions of several genes expected to be co-regulated led to the description of the S-box (now the SAM-I riboswitch), the THI-box (a region within the TPP riboswitch), the RFN element (now the FMN riboswitch) and the B12-box (a part of the cobalamin riboswitch), and in some cases experimental demonstrations that they were involved in gene regulation via an unknown mechanism. Bioinformatics has played a role in more recent discoveries, with increasing automation of the basic comparative genomics strategy. Barrick &quot;et al.&quot; (2004) used BLAST to find UTRs homologous to all UTRs in &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;. Some of these homologous sets were inspected for conserved structure, resulting in 10 RNA-like motifs. Three of these were later experimentally confirmed as the glmS, glycine and PreQ1-I riboswitches (see below). Subsequent comparative genomics efforts using additional taxa of bacteria and improved computer algorithms have identified further riboswitches that are experimentally confirmed, as well as conserved RNA structures that are hypothesized to function as riboswitches.

==Mechanisms==

Riboswitches are often conceptually divided into two parts: an aptamer and an expression platform. The aptamer directly binds the small molecule, and the expression platform undergoes structural changes in response to the changes in the aptamer. The expression platform is what regulates gene expression.

Expression platforms typically turn off gene expression in response to the small molecule, but some turn it on. The following riboswitch mechanisms have been experimentally demonstrated.
* Riboswitch-controlled formation of rho-independent transcription termination hairpins leads to premature transcription termination.
* Riboswitch-mediated folding sequesters the ribosome-binding site, thereby inhibiting translation.
* The riboswitch is a ribozyme that cleaves itself in the presence of sufficient concentrations of its metabolite.
* Riboswitch alternate structures affect the splicing of the pre-mRNA.
** A TPP riboswitch in &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot; (a fungus) controls alternative splicing to conditionally produce an Upstream Open Reading Frame (uORF), thereby affecting the expression of downstream genes
** A TPP riboswitch in plants modifies splicing and alternative 3&#x27;-end processing
* A riboswitch in &quot;Clostridium acetobutylicum&quot; regulates an adjacent gene that is not part of the same mRNA transcript. In this regulation, the riboswitch interferes with transcription of the gene. The mechanism is uncertain but may be caused by clashes between two RNA polymerase units as they simultaneously transcribe the same DNA.
* A riboswitch in &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; regulates the expression of its downstream gene. However, riboswitch transcripts subsequently modulate the expression of a gene located elsewhere in the genome. This &quot;trans&quot; regulation occurs via base-pairing to the mRNA of the distal gene. As the temperature of the bacterium increases, the riboswitch melts, allowing transcription. Unpublished undergraduate research created a similar riboswitch or &#x27;thermosensor&#x27; via random mutagenesis of the Listeria monocytogenes sequence.

==Types==
The following is a list of experimentally validated riboswitches, organized by ligand.
* &quot;Cobalamin riboswitch&quot; (also &quot;B12-element&quot;), which binds either adenosylcobalamin (the coenzyme form of vitamin B12) or aquocobalamin to regulate cobalamin biosynthesis and transport of cobalamin and similar metabolites, and other genes.
* &quot;cyclic AMP-GMP riboswitches&quot; bind the signaling molecule cyclic AMP-GMP. These riboswitches are structurally related to cyclic di-GMP-I riboswitches (see also &quot;cyclic di-GMP&quot; below).
* &quot;cyclic di-AMP riboswitches&quot; (also called &quot;ydaO/yuaA&quot;) bind the signaling molecule cyclic di-AMP.
* &quot;cyclic di-GMP riboswitches&quot; bind the signaling molecule cyclic di-GMP in order to regulate a variety of genes controlled by this second messenger. Two classes of cyclic di-GMP riboswitches are known: cyclic di-GMP-I riboswitches and cyclic di-GMP-II riboswitches. These classes do not appear to be structurally related.
* &quot;fluoride riboswitches&quot; sense fluoride ions, and function in surviving high levels of fluoride.
* &quot;FMN riboswitch&quot; (also &quot;RFN-element&quot;) binds flavin mononucleotide (FMN) to regulate riboflavin biosynthesis and transport.
* &quot;glmS riboswitch&quot;, which is a ribozyme that cleaves itself when there is a sufficient concentration of glucosamine-6-phosphate.
* &quot;Glutamine riboswitches&quot; bind glutamine to regulate genes involved in glutamine and nitrogen metabolism, as well as short peptides of unknown function. Two classes of glutamine riboswitches are known: the &quot;glnA RNA motif&quot; and &quot;Downstream-peptide motif&quot;. These classes are believed to be structurally related (see discussions in those articles).
* &quot;Glycine riboswitch&quot; binds glycine to regulate glycine metabolism genes, including the use of glycine as an energy source. Previous to 2012, this riboswitch was thought to be the only that exhibits cooperative binding, as it contains contiguous dual aptamers. Though no longer shown to be cooperative, the cause of dual aptamers still remains ambiguous.
* &quot;Lysine riboswitch&quot; (also &quot;L-box&quot;) binds lysine to regulate lysine biosynthesis, catabolism and transport.
* &quot;manganese riboswitches&quot; bind manganese ions.
* &quot;NiCo riboswitches&quot; bind the metal ions nickel and cobalt.
* &quot;PreQ1 riboswitches&quot; bind pre-queuosine1, to regulate genes involved in the synthesis or transport of this precursor to queuosine. Three entirely distinct classes of PreQ1 riboswitches are known: PreQ1-I riboswitches, PreQ1-II riboswitches and PreQ1-III riboswitches. The binding domain of PreQ1-I riboswitches are unusually small among naturally occurring riboswitches. PreQ1-II riboswitches, which are only found in certain species in the genera &quot;Streptococcus&quot; and &quot;Lactococcus&quot;, have a completely different structure, and are larger, as are PreQ1-III riboswitches.
* &quot;Purine riboswitches&quot; binds purines to regulate purine metabolism and transport. Different forms of the purine riboswitch bind guanine (a form originally known as the &quot;G-box&quot;) or adenine. The specificity for either guanine or adenine depends completely upon Watson-Crick interactions with a single pyrimidine in the riboswitch at position Y74. In the guanine riboswitch this residue is always a cytosine (i.e. C74), in the adenine residue it is always a uracil (i.e. U74). Homologous types of purine riboswitches bind deoxyguanosine, but have more significant differences than a single nucleotide mutation.
* &quot;SAH riboswitches&quot; bind S-adenosylhomocysteine to regulate genes involved in recycling this metabolite that is produced when S-adenosylmethionine is used in methylation reactions.
* &quot;SAM riboswitches&quot; bind S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to regulate methionine and SAM biosynthesis and transport. Three distinct SAM riboswitches are known: &quot;SAM-I&quot; (originally called &quot;S-box&quot;), &quot;SAM-II&quot; and the &quot;SMK box riboswitch&quot;. SAM-I is widespread in bacteria, but SAM-II is found only in Alpha-, Beta-, and a few Gammaproteobacteria. The SMK box riboswitch is found only in the order Lactobacillales. These three varieties of riboswitch have no obvious similarities in terms of sequence or structure. A fourth variety, SAM-IV riboswitches, appears to have a similar ligand-binding core to that of SAM-I riboswitches, but in the context of a distinct scaffold.
* &quot;SAM-SAH riboswitches&quot; bind both SAM and SAH with similar affinities. Since they are always found in a position to regulate genes encoding methionine adenosyltransferase, it was proposed that only their binding to SAM is physiologically relevant.
* &quot;Tetrahydrofolate riboswitches&quot; bind tetrahydrofolate to regulate synthesis and transport genes.
* &quot;TPP riboswitches&quot; (also THI-box) binds thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) to regulate thiamin biosynthesis and transport, as well as transport of similar metabolites. It is the only riboswitch found so far in eukaryotes.
* &quot;ZMP/ZTP riboswitches&quot; sense ZMP and ZTP, which are by-products of de novo purine metabolism when levels of 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate are low.

Presumed riboswitches:
* &quot;Moco RNA motif&quot; is presumed to bind molybdenum cofactor, to regulate genes involved in biosynthesis and transport of this coenzyme, as well as enzymes that use it or its derivatives as a cofactor.
Candidate metabolite-binding riboswitches have been identified using bioinformatics, and have moderately complex secondary structures and several highly conserved nucleotide positions, as these features are typical of riboswitches that must specifically bind a small molecule. Riboswitch candidates are also consistently located in the 5&#x27; UTRs of protein-coding genes, and these genes are suggestive of metabolite binding, as these are also features of most known riboswitches. Hypothesized riboswitch candidates highly consistent with the preceding criteria are as follows: crcB RNA Motif, manA RNA motif, pfl RNA motif, ydaO/yuaA leader, yjdF RNA motif, ykkC-yxkD leader (and related ykkC-III RNA motif) and the yybP-ykoY leader. The functions of these hypothetical riboswitches remain unknown.

==Computational models==

Riboswitches have been also investigated using in-silico approaches. In particular, solutions for riboswitch prediction can be divided into two wide categories:
* &quot;riboswitch gene finders&quot;, i.e. systems aimed at uncovering riboswitches by genomic inspections, mostly based on motif-searching mechanisms. This group contains Infernal, the founding component of the Rfam database, and more specific tools such as RibEx or RiboSW.
* &quot;conformational switch predictors&quot;, i.e. methods based on a structural classification of alternative structures, such as paRNAss, RNAshapes and RNAbor. Moreover, family-specific approaches for ON/OFF structure prediction have been proposed as well.

The SwiSpot tool somehow covers both the groups, as it uses conformational predictions to assess the presence of riboswitches.

==The RNA world hypothesis==

Riboswitches demonstrate that naturally occurring RNA can bind small molecules specifically, a capability that many previously believed was the domain of proteins or artificially constructed RNAs called aptamers. The existence of riboswitches in all domains of life therefore adds some support to the RNA world hypothesis, which holds that life originally existed using only RNA, and proteins came later; this hypothesis requires that all critical functions performed by proteins (including small molecule binding) could be performed by RNA. It has been suggested that some riboswitches might represent ancient regulatory systems, or even remnants of RNA-world ribozymes whose bindings domains are conserved.

==As antibiotic targets==

Riboswitches could be a target for novel antibiotics. Indeed, some antibiotics whose mechanism of action was unknown for decades have been shown to operate by targeting riboswitches. For example, when the antibiotic pyrithiamine enters the cell, it is metabolized into pyrithiamine pyrophosphate. Pyrithiamine pyrophosphate has been shown to bind and activate the TPP riboswitch, causing the cell to cease the synthesis and import of TPP. Because pyrithiamine pyrophosphate does not substitute for TPP as a coenzyme, the cell dies.

==Engineered riboswitches==

Since riboswitches are an effective method of controlling gene expression in natural organisms, there has been interest in engineering artificial riboswitches
for industrial and medical applications such as gene therapy.

<text>Ant spiders are members of the family Zodariidae. They are small to medium-sized eight-eyed spiders found in all tropical and subtropical regions of South America, Africa, Madagascar, Australia-New Guinea, New Zealand, Arabia and the Indian subcontinent. Most species are daytime hunters and live together with ants, mimicking their behavior and sometimes even their chemical traits. Although little is known about most zodariids, members of the genus &quot;Zodarion&quot; apparently feed only on ants; a number of other genera in the family are apparently also ant (or termite) specialists.

<text>Draco was a shareware programming language created by Chris Gray. First developed for CP/M systems, Amiga version followed in 1987.

Although Draco, a blend of Pascal and C, was well suited for general purpose programming, its uniqueness as a language was its main weak point. Gray used Draco for the Amiga to create a port of Peter Langston&#x27;s game &quot;Empire&quot;.

<text>Saint-Éloi () is a parish municipality in the region of Bas-Saint-Laurent, Quebec, Canada. Its population was 310 in the Canada 2021 Census.

== History ==

On March 9, 1848, the parish of Saint-Éloi was canonically erected by separating an area from the parishes of Saint-Jean-Baptiste de L&#x27;Isle-Verte and Notre-Dame-des-Neiges de Trois-Pistoles. It was erected civilly on the following June 13. Parish registers were also opened in 1848. The first parish priest was Thomas Aubert from Gaspé. Previously, the parish had been served by the parish priests of Trois-Pistoles and L&#x27;Isle-Verte. The first chapel was built in 1849 and in 1853, the post office was opened under the name of Saint-Éloi. 

The municipality of Saint-Éloi was officially created on July 1st 1855. The municipality lost an important part of its territory in 1883 when Saint-Cyprien (then called Hocquart) was separated from Saint-Éloi. On September 14, 1924, the first cornerstone of the current church was blessed. On 15 September 1926, the first mass was celebrated in the current church.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Saint-Éloi had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


== Notable people ==
Notable people born in Saint-Éloi include jazz musician Alain Caron and Quebec premier Adélard Godbout.

<text>This is a glossary of terms specific to differential geometry and differential topology. The following three glossaries are closely related:
*Glossary of general topology
*Glossary of algebraic topology
*Glossary of Riemannian and metric geometry.

See also:
*List of differential geometry topics

Words in &quot;italics&quot; denote a self-reference to this glossary.


==A==

* Atlas

==B==

* Bundle – see &quot;fiber bundle&quot;.

* Basic element – A basic element &quot;formula_1&quot; with respect to an element &quot;formula_2&quot; is an element of a cochain complex formula_3 (e.g., complex of &quot;differential forms&quot; on a manifold) that is closed: formula_4 and the contraction of &quot;formula_1&quot; by &quot;formula_2&quot; is zero.

==C==

* Characteristic class
* Chart

* Cobordism

* Codimension – The codimension of a submanifold is the dimension of the ambient space minus the dimension of the submanifold.

* Connected sum

* Connection

* Cotangent bundle – the vector bundle of cotangent spaces on a manifold.

* Cotangent space
* Covering
* Cusp
* CW-complex

==D==

* Dehn twist
* Diffeomorphism – Given two differentiable manifolds &quot;formula_7&quot; and &quot;formula_8&quot;, a bijective map formula_9 from &quot;formula_7&quot; to &quot;formula_8&quot; is called a diffeomorphism – if both formula_12 and its inverse formula_13 are smooth functions.
* Differential form
* Domain invariance

* Doubling – Given a manifold &quot;formula_7&quot; with boundary, doubling is taking two copies of &quot;formula_7&quot; and identifying their boundaries. As the result we get a manifold without boundary.

==E==

* Embedding
* Exotic structure – See exotic sphere and exotic formula_16.

==F==

* Fiber – In a fiber bundle, &quot;formula_17&quot; the preimage &quot;formula_18&quot; of a point &quot;formula_1&quot; in the base &quot;formula_20&quot; is called the fiber over &quot;formula_1&quot;, often denoted &quot;formula_22&quot;.

* Fiber bundle

* Frame – A frame at a point of a differentiable manifold &quot;M&quot; is a basis of the tangent space at the point.

* Frame bundle – the principal bundle of frames on a smooth manifold.

* Flow

==G==

* Genus
* Germ
* Grassmannian bundle
* Grassmannian manifold

==H==

* Local diffeomorphism

==M==

* Manifold – A topological manifold is a locally Euclidean Hausdorff space (usually also required to be second-countable). For a given regularity (e.g. piecewise-linear, formula_23 or formula_24 differentiable, real or complex analytic, Lipschitz, Hölder, quasi-conformal...), a manifold of that regularity is a topological manifold whose charts transitions have the prescribed regularity.
* Manifold with boundary
* Manifold with corners
* Mapping class group
* Morse function

==N==
* Neat submanifold – A submanifold whose boundary equals its intersection with the boundary of the manifold into which it is embedded.

== O ==
* Orbifold
* Orientation of a vector bundle

==P==

* Pair of pants – An orientable compact surface with 3 boundary components. All compact orientable surfaces can be reconstructed by gluing pairs of pants along their boundary components.
* Parallelizable – A smooth manifold is parallelizable if it admits a smooth global frame. This is equivalent to the tangent bundle being trivial.
* Partition of unity
* PL-map

* Poincaré lemma

* Principal bundle – A principal bundle is a fiber bundle &quot;formula_25&quot; together with an action on &quot;formula_26&quot; by a Lie group &quot;formula_27&quot; that preserves the fibers of &quot;formula_26&quot; and acts simply transitively on those fibers.

* Torus

* Transversality – Two submanifolds &quot;formula_7&quot; and &quot;formula_8&quot; intersect transversally if at each point of intersection &quot;p&quot; their tangent spaces formula_31 and formula_32 generate the whole tangent space at &quot;p&quot; of the total manifold.
* Triangulation

* Trivialization
* Tubular neighborhood

==V==

* Vector bundle – a fiber bundle whose fibers are vector spaces and whose transition functions are linear maps.

* Vector field – a section of a vector bundle. More specifically, a vector field can mean a section of the tangent bundle.

==W==

* Whitney sum – A Whitney sum is an analog of the direct product for vector bundles. Given two vector bundles &quot;formula_33&quot; and &quot;formula_34&quot; over the same base &quot;formula_20&quot; their cartesian product is a vector bundle over formula_36. The diagonal map formula_37 induces a vector bundle over &quot;formula_20&quot; called the Whitney sum of these vector bundles and denoted by &quot;formula_39&quot;.

<doc id="507362" wikidata="Q1349029" url="?curid=507362" title="Christopher Condent">
<text>Condent (died 1734), born in Plymouth in Devon, was an English pirate who was best known for his piracies in the Indian Ocean.

His real name is uncertain; French sources from the time of his retirement refer to him as &quot;Edward Congdon.&quot; He has been known under the surnames Condent, Congdon, Coudon, Comdon, Connor, Condell, or Gonwel; various given names also arise, including William, Christopher, Edmond, Edward, or John. His frequently-encountered nickname was &quot;Billy One-Hand&quot;. He is most commonly known as Christopher Condent but &quot;Christopher&quot; as his given name was not seen in period sources and dates only to the 1950s.

==History==

Around 1718, when Woodes Rogers became governor of the Bahamas, and was tasked with ridding the Caribbean of pirates, Condent and his crew left New Providence. During a trip across the Atlantic Ocean, Condent killed an Indian crewmember, who threatened to ignite the ship&#x27;s powder magazine. Shortly after, the ship captured a merchantman, the &quot;Duke of York&quot;. After a dispute, the crew split up between the two ships, with Condent elected captain of the sloop. At the Cape Verde Islands, Condent and his men captured a ship carrying Portuguese wine. Condent then sailed to Brazil, where he took more prizes, occasionally cutting off the ears and noses of Portuguese prisoners. He then returned to the area around Cape Verde, where he captured a flotilla of twenty small ships and a Dutch war sloop off Santiago. Condent kept the warship, and named it &quot;Dragon&quot;.

Condent seized the English galley, the &quot;Wright&quot;, a Portuguese ship, and a 26-gun Dutch vessel. Leaving the &quot;Wright&quot; behind, he led a fleet of three ships to the Gold Coast (Ghana) where they captured the &quot;Indian Queen&quot;, the &quot;Fame&quot;, and another Dutch ship.
By April 1719, Condent had reached the island of Sainte-Marie, Madagascar. There he integrated some of John Halsey&#x27;s old crew into his own. After a successful cruise to the East Indies they captured a rich Arab trading ship called &quot;Faza Ramance&quot;. Condent and his crew returned to the island of Sainte-Marie, dividing their haul into around £3,000 each. While there he traded with visiting British slavers and merchants, one of whom reported that Condent and his crew had so much treasure, they &quot;need not go to sea again as long as they lived&quot;. In 1721 Condent and forty other members of his crew sailed to the island of Bourbon where they negotiated with the French governor for a pardon; twenty or more of the men settled on the island; Condent went on to marry the governor&#x27;s sister-in-law. At Réunion he was visited by pirates Levasseur, Taylor, and Seagar who had captured the Portuguese Viceroy of Goa aboard the fantastically wealthy &quot;Nossa Senhora do Cabo&quot;. Condent negotiated between the pirates and the island&#x27;s Governor for the Viceroy&#x27;s release. In 1723 Condent travelled to France, where he settled down with his wife in Brittany and became a wealthy merchant in Saint-Malo. The last of his surviving crew died in the Mascarene Islands in 1770. One of his former crew who remained at Madagascar was James Plaintain, who established a trading post and set himself up as a local &quot;King&quot; with his share of treasure from the &quot;Faza Ramance&quot;.

==His ship==

At first thought to be William Kidd&#x27;s &quot;Adventure Galley&quot;, the &quot;Fiery Dragon&quot; was claimed to have been found by Barry Clifford off the coast of Sainte-Marie, Madagascar, where it was purposely sunk in 1721. However, a UNESCO analysis of Clifford&#x27;s discovery reported that Clifford had instead found an unrelated ship of Asian origin.

==Flag==

The Jolly Roger flag generally associated with Condent - three skulls-and-crossbones on a black flag or banner - first appeared in Mariner&#x27;s Mirror in 1912, though it was not attributed to Condent and was dated to 1704. A similar design was printed in Basil Lubbock&#x27;s “Blackwall Frigates” in 1922 and F. Bradlee&#x27;s &quot;Piracy in the West Indies and its suppression” in 1923, again not attributed to Condent. Charles Grey attributed it to him in 1933 in “Pirates of the Eastern Seas” but without citing any evidence. The only period source describing his flag is an article in &quot;The St. James Post&quot; from June 1718 describing his ships &quot;who appear&#x27;d with flags having a Deaths Head on them.&quot;

<text>Digital printing is a method of printing from a digital-based image directly to a variety of media. It usually refers to professional printing where small-run jobs from desktop publishing and other digital sources are printed using large-format and/or high-volume laser or inkjet printers.

Digital printing has a higher cost per page than more traditional offset printing methods, but this price is usually offset by avoiding the cost of all the technical steps required to make printing plates. It also allows for on-demand printing, short turnaround time, and even a modification of the image (variable data) used for each impression. The savings in labor and the ever-increasing capability of digital presses means that digital printing is reaching the point where it can match or supersede offset printing technology&#x27;s ability to produce larger print runs of several thousand sheets at a low price.

== Process ==

The greatest difference between digital printing and analog methods, such as lithography, flexography, gravure, and letterpress, is that in digital printing (introduced in the 1980s) there is no need to replace the printing plate, whereas in analog printing the plates are repeatedly replaced. This results in quicker turnaround time and lower cost in digital printing, but typically a loss of detail in most commercial digital printing processes. The most popular methods include inkjet and laser printers, which deposit pigment and toner, respectively, onto substrates, such as paper, canvas, glass, metal, and marble.

In many of the processes, the ink or toner does not permeate the substrate, as does conventional ink, but forms a thin layer on the surface that may be additionally adhered to the substrate by a fuser fluid with thermal (toner) or ultraviolet curing (ink).

== Digital printing methods of note ==

=== Fine art inkjet printing ===
Fine art digital inkjet printing is printing from a computer image file directly to an inkjet printer as a final output. It evolved from digital proofing technology from Kodak, 3M, and other major manufacturers, with artists and other printers trying to adapt these dedicated prepress proofing machines to fine-art printing. There was experimentation with many of these types of printers, the most notable being the IRIS printer, initially adapted to fine-art printing by programmer David Coons, and adopted for fine-art work by Graham Nash at his Nash Editions printing company in 1991. Initially, these printers were limited to glossy papers, but the IRIS Graphics printer allowed the use of a variety of papers that included traditional and non-traditional media. The IRIS printer was the standard for fine art digital printmaking for many years, and is still in use today, but has been superseded by large-format printers from other manufacturers such as Epson and HP that use fade-resistant, archival inks (pigment-based, as well as newer solvent-based inks), and archival substrates specifically designed for fine-art printing.

Substrates in fine art inkjet printmaking include traditional fine-art papers such as Rives BFK, Arches watercolor paper, treated and untreated canvas, experimental substrates (such as metal and plastic), and fabric.

For artists making reproductions of their original work, inkjet printing is more expensive on a per-print basis than the traditional four-color offset lithography, but with inkjet printing the artist does not have to pay for the expensive printing-plate setup or the marketing and storage needed for large four-color offset print runs. Inkjet reproductions can be printed and sold individually in accordance with demand. Inkjet printing has the added advantage of allowing artists to take total control of the production of their images, including the final color correction and the substrates being used, with some artists owning and operating their own printers.

Digital inkjet printing also allows for the output of digital art of all types as finished pieces or as an element in a further art piece. Experimental artists often add texture or other media to the surface of a final print, or use it as part of a mixed-media work. Many terms for the process have been used over the years, including &quot;digigraph&quot; and &quot;giclée&quot;. Thousands of print shops and digital printmakers now offer services to painters, photographers, and digital artists around the world.

Digital images are exposed onto true, light sensitive photographic paper with lasers and processed in photographic developers and fixers. These prints are true photographs and have continuous tone in the image detail. The archival quality of the print is as high as the manufacturer&#x27;s rating for any given photo paper used. In large format prints, the greatest advantage is that, since no lens is used, there is no vignetting or detail distortion in the corners of the image.

=== Digital cylinder printing ===

Digital cylinder printing is when a machine directly lays ink onto a curved surface that usually is the wall of an object that has a circular cross section, and a constant, tapered, or variable diameter. Digital cylinder printing is a method of reproducing black-and-white or full-color images and text onto cylindrical objects, typically promotional products, through use of digital imaging systems.

The digital process is by definition faster than conventional screen printing, because it requires fewer production steps and less set-up time for multiple colors and more complex jobs. This in turn enables reduced run lengths.

The ability of digital cylinder printing machines to print full color in one pass, including primers, varnishes and specialty inks, enables multiple design techniques, which include:

* Mirror prints: viewable on the inside and outside of glass or plastic
* Tone on tone: solid matte-finished substrate enhanced with one ink or clear coat
* Stained glass: color opaque enough to see through
* Contouring
* Etched

Full-wrap cylindrical printing also benefits from seamless borders with no visual overlap. For ease of print file preparation, original design artwork should be able to be imaged on cylinders and tapered items without the need for manipulation or distortion; i.e., flat images will print to scale on a curved surface, with software automatically making the adjustment. The more advanced systems available on the market can handle these requirements.

The digital cylindrical printing process involves inserting a cylinder-shaped item, or part, into a fixture, which securely holds it in place. The part then travels under a print head mechanism in which tiny droplets of CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) inks are released in a specific pattern to form an image. Typically, one part is printed at a time and can require from 8 to 45 seconds to complete, depending on artwork complexity and quality. It is then finished with a UV coating to add a glossy finish and protect it from abrasion.

There are three different imaging techniques used by digital cylinder printing machines: multi-pass, single pass, and helical printing.

Multi-Pass: Multi-pass printing is when the print heads or printed object move axially in steps down the part, like a flatbed printer. The move time is inefficient and can lead to stitching artifacts between moves.

Single Pass: Single pass involves using an array of print heads to print the full image length with a single revolution of the printed object. Different colors are usually printed at different stations, leading to higher cost, increased complexity, and sensitivity to print nozzle drop-outs.  

Helical Printing: Helical printing is a hybrid method between the single-pass and multi-pass approaches. Image data is mapped to allow continuous imaging in a helical pattern with a limited number of print heads. Users can optimize the print resolution, speed, and curing controls to optimize image quality or choose higher speed if quality isn&#x27;t critical. Tapers can be imaged at high speed and curved vessels can be managed through the range of controls offered.

Items that can be printed using digital cylindrical processes include cups, tumblers, thermos bottles, bottles, makeup containers, machine parts, carrier tubes, pens, tubes, jars and others.

== Applications ==
Digital printing has many advantages over traditional methods. Some applications of note include:
* Desktop publishing – inexpensive home and office printing is only possible because of digital processes that bypass the need for printing plates
* Commercial – Business Stationery - Including business cards, letterheads
* Variable data printing – uses database-driven print files for the mass 
personalization of printed materials
* Fine art – archival digital printing methods include real photo paper exposure prints and giclée prints on watercolor paper using pigment based inks.
* Print on Demand – digital printing is used for personalized printing for example, children&#x27;s books customized with a child&#x27;s name, photo books (such as wedding photo books), or any other books.
* Advertising – often used for outdoor vinyl banners and event signage, in trade shows, in the retail sector at point of sale or point of purchase, and in personalized direct mail campaigns.
* Photos – digital printing has revolutionized photo printing in terms of the ability to retouch and color correct a photograph before printing.
* Architectural Design – new media that conforms to a variety of surfaces has enabled interior and exterior spaces to be transformed using digitally printed wall murals and floor graphics.
* Sleeking – The process of adding foil, holographic effects or even glossy and dull finishes by way of digital ink adhesion. This is done by digitally printing a rich black area where the user wants the sleeking to take place. The machine registers this and only adheres to this specific area.

<text>PL-11 is a high-level machine-oriented programming language for the PDP-11, developed by R.D. Russell of CERN in 1971. Written in Fortran IV, it is similar to PL360 and is cross-compiled on other machines.

PL-11 was originally developed as part of the Omega project, a particle physics facility operational at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland) during the 1970s. The first version was written for the CII 10070, a clone of the XDS Sigma 7 built in France. Towards the end of the 1970s it was ported to the IBM 370/168, then part of CERN&#x27;s computer centre.

A report describing the language is available from CERN.

<text>Gary Jules Aguirre Jr. (born March 19, 1969) is an American singer-songwriter, known primarily for his cover version of the Tears for Fears song &quot;Mad World&quot;, which he recorded with his friend Michael Andrews for the film &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;. It became the UK Christmas number-one single of 2003.

==Early life==
Gary Jules was born in Fresno, California to Marie and Gary Aguirre. His family is descendant from Oklahoma, Ireland, France, Mexico and Spain. He attended The Bishop&#x27;s School in La Jolla, California.

==Songs==
Jules recorded a cover of the song &quot;Mad World&quot; by Tears for Fears for the 2001 film &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; and released it as a single in December 2003. This timing allowed it to become the Christmas Number One single in the UK for that year.

He sang the cover on stage as a guest in a duet with French singer composer Mylène Farmer during her &quot;Timeless (Mylène Farmer)&quot; 2013 tour.

The cover also featured as background music in various television programs such as drama &quot;General Hospital&quot;, as well as individual episodes of &quot;Without a Trace&quot;, &quot;The O.C.&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;Jericho&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;House&quot; and &quot;Riverdale&quot;.
The cover was used in the trailer for the 2010 film, &quot;The Crazies,&quot; and the Cavaliers Drum and Bugle Corps&#x27; 2010 Production, &quot;Mad World&quot;.

In 2016, a piano cover influenced by Jule&#x27;s version was released by artist Jennifer Ann and used in a commercial for Lloyd&#x27;s Bank, which featured a horse galloping through different stages in people&#x27;s lives.

Adam Lambert sang a cover of &quot;Mad World&quot; that was heavily influenced by Jules&#x27;s version at two different points in his &quot;American Idol&quot; competition, as well as during the American Idols Live! 2009 tour. Following its appearance on the popular television show, Jules&#x27;s cover of the song rose to No. 11 on the iTunes Store.

Electronic music producer Phutureprimitive remixed the Gary Jules version of &quot;Mad World&quot; and released it as an mp3 in 2011 with an accompanying video.

The song &quot;Something Else&quot; was featured on the Season 5 episode &quot;My Fallen Idol&quot; of the NBC show &quot;Scrubs&quot;.

The song &quot;Gone Daddy&quot; is based upon an experience that led to Jules relocating his family from Southern California to North Carolina. A neighbor was gunned down one night in Los Angeles and while the police were investigating the shooting, Jules approached one of the officers, explained that his child was napping, and asked if the officer knew when they would be finished. The officer said he did not know, but that the family could leave Los Angeles if they didn&#x27;t like it. Jules took the advice to heart and relocated shortly thereafter.

Jules&#x27;s song &quot;Wichita&quot; was inspired by a class he took at UCLA regarding Native American history. During the class he read a story about Native Americans following herds of bison around the nation to survive. 

Jules was a surprise guest on a series of Parisian concerts of French singer Mylène Farmer, called Timeless 2013 (September 2013). In all the performances that take place in the Palais omnisport de Bercy, Gary Jules sings his cover of Mad World joined by Mylène Farmer. They follow by the duet song &quot;Les Mots&quot; that Mylène Farmer originally released in 2001 with Seal. So far Gary Jules is also part of the tour, as he was also performing during the concerts in Lyon.

<text>The ancient Agora of Athens (also called the Classical Agora) is an ancient Greek agora. It is located to the northwest of the Acropolis, and bounded on the south by the hill of the Areopagus and on the west by the hill known as the Agoraios Kolonos, also called Market Hill. The Agora&#x27;s initial use was for a commercial, assembly, or residential gathering place.

==Buildings and structures of the classical agora==

===North side of the agora===
* Stoa Poikile (Painted stoa), a building built in the 5th century B.C. used purely for socialising unlike many other buildings in the agora.
* Altar of the Twelve Gods
* Stoa Basileios (Royal stoa)
* Temple of Aphrodite Urania
*The south end of what is believed to be a Basilica has been uncovered near Hadrian Street and is dated to the mid 100s C.E.

===East side of the agora===
* The Stoa of Attalos, a stoa lined with shops built in the 2nd century B.C. which has since been reconstructed for use as the Museum of The Ancient Agora.
* The Square Peristyle was a law court originally located under the northern end of the Stoa of Attalos.
*A collection of buildings were added to the south-east corner: the East stoa, the Library of Pantainos, the Nymphaeum and a temple.
*The Library of Pantainos was more than just a library, the west and north wings were series of rooms that were used for other purposes other than storing books. With the construction of the Library of Pantainos, the official entrance into the agora was now between the Library and the Stoa of Attalos.
* The Mint, a building which was used for the minting of bronze coinage in the 2nd and 3rd centuries B.C. but there is no evidence for it being used for the minting of Athenian silver coinage.
*The Monopteros was located south of the Basilica and also dated to the mid 100s C.E. It had no walls, was a dome supported by columns and was about 8 meters in diameter.
*The Bema was a speakers platform and was located near the Stoa of Attalos.

===South side of the agora===
*The Middle stoa which was the most extensive monument built during the 2nd century B.C.
* The Southwest Temple, built with material from Thorikos in the early first century AD.
* South-east Fountain House
* South Stoa I
* Aiakeion

===West side of the agora===
* Strategeion
* Agoraios Kolonos
* Tholos
* Boundary stone
* Monument of the Eponymous Heroes, a monument for the ten heroes of the tribes of Athens which was also used as a notice board for new legislation, public events and military conscription.
* Metroon (Old Bouleuterion)
* Bouleuterion
* Temple of Hephaestus (Hephaestion)
* Temple of Apollo Patroos
* Stoa of Zeus
*The Temple of Zeus Phratrios and Athena Phratria dated to the 300s B.C. and is located near the Temple of Apollo Patroos.
* A statue of the Roman emperor Hadrian was located near the metroon.

===Other monuments===

A number of other notable monuments were added to the agora. Some of these included:
*An Altar of Zeus Agoraios was added just to the east of the Monument to the Eponymous Heroes.
*The Temple of Ares, dedicated to Ares, the god of war, was added in the north half agora, just south of the Altar of the Twelve Gods.
*The Odeon of Agrippa and accompanying gymnasium were added in the centre of the agora.
*There is evidence of a Synagogue in the Agora of Athens in the 3rd century.

== Gender roles in the Athenian Agora ==

=== Professions ===
In the 4th and 5th centuries, there was significant evidence of women being innkeepers and merchants selling their products in the market of the Athenian agora. Some of the products they sold included fruits, clothes, pottery, religious and luxury goods, perfume, incense, purple dye, wreaths, and ribbons.

=== Rituals ===
The Athenian calendar boasted several religious festivals that were held in the Athenian agora. These festivals were significant as they provided Ancient Athenian women with the opportunity to socialize outside of the home. Additionally, some of these festivals were performed by women; these duties included officiating the worship of goddess Athena, patron goddess of the city. Performing these rituals for goddesses was a prerequisite for the daughters of aristocratic families. Women of all ranks and classes could be seen making offerings at the small shrines in the agora. Some women also set up substantial memorials to their piety within the agora. Religious festivals were a significant opportunity for the women of Athens to participate in their social culture.

== Marble-workers in the Athenian Agora ==

As of the early 5th century, the Ancient Agora of Athens was known as glorious and richly decorated, set with famous works of art, many of them sculpted from marble. The buildings of the Athenian Agora had marble decoration and housed dedications in the form of marble statues. Finds from the agora excavations identified that generations of marble-workers made the agora of Athens an important center for the production of marble sculptures. Marble-workers made sculptures, marble weights, sundials, furniture parts, and an assortment of kitchen utensils. Excavations of the Athenian agora revealed the remains of many marble-working establishments, various unfinished statues, reliefs, and utilitarian objects.

=== Marble workshops in the Agora ===
Excavations of the Athenian agora have proved that marble-workers were very active, the earliest workshops being established in the early 5th century. The earliest areas used by marble workers were the residential and industrial districts southwest of the agora. Another area where marble-workers set up shop was in the South Square, after the sack of Athens by the Roman general Sulla in 86 BC. As the South Square was in ruins, marble-workers were attracted to the remains of the marble temples. A workshop from the southern corner of the agora was also important, the Library of Pantainos rented out rooms to marble-workers.

=== Famous marble-workers in the Agora ===
Literacy and evidence from excavations give a sense of statues and famous marble sculptors in the Athenian agora. These famous marble-workers of the Agora include, the 5th-century master Phidias and his associate Alkamenes, and the 4th-century sculptors Praxiteles, Bryaxis, and Euphranor.

==== Phidias ====
Phidias was the most well known marble-worker to have worked in the agora. He was famous for his gold and ivory cult statue of Zeus at Olympia, and for his three lost sculptures of Athena.

==== Alcamenes ====

A well-known associate of Phidias was Alcamenes, whose most important works in the agora were the bronze cult statues of Hephaestus and Athena in the Temple of Hephaestus.

==== Praxiteles and Bryaxis ====
These famous sculptors are attested in the agora by the discovery of signed pieces of work that could no longer be preserved. A marble statue signed and possibly carved by Bryaxis was found in the agora behind the Royal Stoa.

==== Euphranor ====
The 4th century marble-worker known for his sculptures, made a colossal statue of Apollo for the Temple of Apollo Patroos on the west side of the agora.

==Excavations==

The ancient Athenian agora has been excavated by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens (ASCSA) since 1931 under the direction of Thomas Leslie Shear, Sr. His wife, Josephine Platner Shear, supervised the digging and led the study and conservation of numismatics from the site, as well as making the discovery of a new 2nd-century C.E. Athenian coin. The excavation was negotiated and directed by the ASCSA&#x27;s chair of the agora excavation committee, Edward Capps, whom the school would honor with a memorial overlooking the project. John McK Camp served as Director of the excavations since 1994, until his retirement in 2022. John K. Papadopoulos is now in the position of Director following Camp&#x27;s retirement.

After the initial phase of excavation, in the 1950s the Hellenistic Stoa of Attalos was reconstructed on the east side of the agora, and today it serves as a museum and as storage and office space for the excavation team.

A virtual reconstruction of the Ancient Agora of Athens has been produced through a collaboration of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and the Foundation of the Hellenic World, which had various output (3d video, VR real-time dom performance, and Google Earth 3d models).

During a 1974 excavation, a lead tablet was discovered. The tablet was a letter written by Lesis, a slave. It was one of the few recorded instances of slave literacy.

===Flora===
Evidence of planting was discovered during the excavations and on 4 January 1954, the first oak and laurel trees were planted around the Altar of Zeus by Queen Frederika and King Paul as part of the efforts to restore the site with plants that would have been found there in antiquity.

== Museum of the Ancient Agora ==
The museum is housed in the Stoa of Attalos, and its exhibits are connected with Athenian democracy. The collection of the museum includes clay, bronze and glass objects, sculptures, coins and inscriptions from the 7th to the 5th century B.C., as well as pottery of the Byzantine and Ottoman periods. The exhibition within the museum contains works of art which describe the private and public life in ancient Athens. In 2012, a new sculpture exhibition was added to the museum which includes portraits from Athenian Agora excavations. The new exhibition revolves around portraits of idealized gods, officially honored people of the city, wealthy Roman citizens during the Roman occupation (1st and 2nd century A.D.), 3rd-century citizens and finally on works of art from private art schools of late antiquity.

<doc id="507381" wikidata="Q5641713" url="?curid=507381" title="Half Moon Hotel">
<text>The Half Moon Hotel in Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York, was a 225-foot-tall, 14-story hotel that opened on May 5, 1927, on the Riegelmann Boardwalk at West 29th Street. The Half Moon was built to help Coney Island compete with the beach resort Atlantic City, New Jersey. The hotel was designed by the architectural firm of George B. Post and Sons and built by the Cauldwell-Wingate Co.

It is best known as the location where Abe Reles, informant for the FBI who brought down numerous members of Murder, Inc., either jumped, fell or was pushed to his death on November 12, 1941, from room 623, where he was in protective custody of the New York City Police Department, a few hours before he was scheduled to testify against Albert Anastasia. Reles&#x27;s death signified the reach that organized crime had into the police department – he was guarded by six police detectives. There was little doubt that Reles was defenestrated.

The name &quot;Half Moon&quot; refers to the name of explorer Henry Hudson&#x27;s ship, which anchored off Gravesend Bay in Brooklyn (the location of Coney Island), while searching for a short cut to Asia.

During World War 2, the hotel was operated by the U.S. Navy and became known as the &quot;U. S. Naval Special Hospital Sea Gate, NY&quot;, a convalescent hospital.

In the 1950s, it became a senior citizens&#x27; home called the Metropolitan Jewish Geriatric Center. They moved to another building and it was demolished in 1995. Today the Seagate Rehabilitation and Nursing Center is on the site.

<doc id="507383" wikidata="Q671401" url="?curid=507383" title="Foynes">
<text>Foynes (; ) is a town and major port in County Limerick in the midwest of Ireland, located at the edge of hilly land on the southern bank of the Shannon Estuary. The population of the town was 512 as of the 2022 census.

==Foynes&#x27;s role as seaport==
Foynes as a port has a long history, being first surveyed in 1837, and is now the location of a major deep water seaport operated by the Shannon Foynes Port Company, an amalgamation under the Harbours Act 2000 of the agencies operating the ports of Limerick and Foynes. It is anticipated that more traffic from the upstream Limerick Port will ultimately be diverted there as the latter portlands are redeveloped as commercial and residential properties. A railway line to Limerick via Patrickswell and Raheen is in existence but not operational. Iarnród Éireann&#x27;s policy of concentrating on what it sees as more profitable passenger operations means the Port&#x27;s traffic is entirely served by road.

Foynes Port Company was amalgamated with the Shannon Estuary Ports Company (which had responsibility for the other areas of the Estuary) in 2000, to form Shannon Foynes Port Company (SFPC). SFPC is the second largest port facility in Ireland, handling over 10 million tonnes of cargo annually through the six terminals currently operational. Planning permission has been granted for an LNG import terminal at Ballylongford, County Kerry, within SFPC&#x27;s jurisdiction; once constructed it will add considerably to throughput.

==Foynes&#x27;s role in aviation==

During the late 1930s and early 1940s, land-based planes lacked sufficient flying range for Atlantic crossings. Foynes was the last port of call on its eastern shore for seaplanes. As a result, Foynes would become one of the biggest civilian airports in Europe during World War II. Surveying flights for flying boat operations were made by Charles Lindbergh in 1933 and a terminal was begun in 1935. The first transatlantic proving flights were operated on 5 July 1937 with a Pan Am Sikorsky S-42 service from Botwood, Newfoundland on the Bay of Exploits and a BOAC Short Empire service from Foynes with successful transits of twelve and fifteen-and-a-quarter hours respectively. Services to New York, Southampton, Montreal, Poole and Lisbon followed, the first non-stop New York service operating on 22 June 1942 in 25 hours 40 minutes.

While Irish Coffee is claimed to have been invented in San Francisco, it was made popular in that city a decade after it had been first invented at Foynes in 1943 when the Brendan O&#x27;Regan&#x27;s chef and bartender, Joe Sheridan, was asked to make something hot for passengers whose flying boat had turned back due to bad weather. O&#x27;Regan was Catering Comptroller between 1943-1945 and afterwards held the same position at Shannon Airport where he established the world&#x27;s first duty-free shop amongst his innovations.

===Foynes Flying Boat Museum===

Flying boat use started to change following the construction and opening in 1942 of Shannon Airport on flat bogland on the northern bank of the Shanno River estuary. Foynes flying-boat station closed in 1946. A college for the learning of the Irish language was opened in the former terminal in 1954. 

The Port Trustees purchased the building in 1980 and the Foynes Flying Boat Museum leased a portion in 1988. The museum contains much memorabilia from that era, including the original radio and weather room, along with its equipment and a full-size replica Boeing 314 flying boat.

==Transport==
===Rail===

Foynes railway station opened on 29 April 1858, as the terminus of a line from Limerick which was subsequently extended west from Ballingrane to Tralee. The station closed to passengers on 4 February 1963, but remained open for freight traffic until 30 October 2000. The Limerick–Foynes railway line was &quot;mothballed&quot; at the end of 2001 (the line from Ballingrane to Tralee having been lifted in the late 1980s). The annual Irish Rail weed-spraying train last traversed the line on 7 May 2002.

The Shannon Foynes Port Company reportedly maintained contact with Irish Rail to discuss reopening the line for bulk cargo projects and, in April 2011, the company&#x27;s chairman said that they were confident that the rail link could be reopened. In June 2015, €800,000 of EU funding was secured for a study to develop the business case to reopen the line. In early 2023, it was announced that a contractor had been appointed and works on reopening the line were due to commence in February 2023.

===Bus===
Bus Éireann route number 314 provides a few journeys a day to Limerick via Askeaton. In the opposite direction, there are buses to Glin with a weekend service to Tralee and a summer service to Ballybunion.

==Places of interest==
In addition to the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, the Knockpatrick Gardens, an award-winning garden overlooking the Shannon Estuary, is located from Foynes.

Foynes is near to Adare, a national heritage town, and the city of Limerick. The main gateway to the region is Shannon Airport. Foynes is located on the N69 &quot;coast road&quot; to Tarbert and Tralee in County Kerry.

==Sports==
Saint Senan&#x27;s GAA club draws its players from the parish centred on Foynes and the neighbouring town of Shanagolden. Although it has fielded hurling teams on occasions, it is primarily a Gaelic football club. After winning the intermediate championship in 2003, Saint Senan&#x27;s were narrowly beaten in the final of the 2006 Limerick Senior Football Championship. Its predecessor, the Foynes team, won its only senior championship in 1907.

<text>Luis Villalta Aquino (October 2, 1969 in Lima, Peru – March 3, 2004 in Pompano Beach, Florida) was a professional boxer, who was nicknamed &quot;El Puma&quot; during his career.

He moved to Hillsborough Township, New Jersey to be near his trainer and improve his career opportunities while trying to get entry visas for his family. He shared an apartment with two roommates and worked at a local McDonald&#x27;s.

On February 28, 2004, he defended his North American Boxing Association lightweight title against Ricky Quiles at the Seminole Tribe of Florida Coconut Creek Casino. He collapsed in his dressing room moments after losing. Villalta was rushed to the North Broward Medical Center. He died after undergoing surgery for head trauma. His wife, Miraebel, and father, Luis, Sr. who were granted emergency visas, were at his bedside. He never regained consciousness.

Villalta is the fifth Peruvian fighter to die in the ring. His career record was 29-6-1.

<doc id="507397" wikidata="Q12061386" url="?curid=507397" title="Nancy Harkness Love">
<text>Nancy Harkness Love (February 14, 1914 – October 22, 1976), born Hannah Lincoln Harkness, was an American pilot and airplane commander during World War II. She earned her pilot&#x27;s license at age 16. She worked as a test pilot and air racer in the 1930s. During World War II she convinced Colonel William H. Tunner of the U.S. Army Air Forces to look to set up a group of female pilots to ferry aircraft from factories to air bases. This proposal was eventually approved as the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron. Love commanded this unit and later all ferrying operations in the newly formed Women Airforce Service Pilots. She was awarded the Air Medal for her work during the war and was appointed lieutenant colonel in the US Air Force Reserve in 1948.

==Early life==
Born in Houghton, Michigan on February 14, 1914, as the daughter of a wealthy physician, Harkness developed an intense interest in aviation at an early age. At 16, she took her first flight and earned her pilot&#x27;s license within a month. Although she went to all the right schools, including Milton Academy in Massachusetts and Vassar in New York, she was restless and adventurous. In 1932, by the end of her freshman year, dubbed, &quot;The Flying Freshman!&quot;, she earned her commercial license and received national attention. At Vassar, she earned extra money taking students for rides in an aircraft she rented from a nearby airport.

In 1936, Harkness married Robert M. Love, an Air Corps Reserve major. They built their own successful Boston-based aviation company, Inter City Aviation, for which Nancy was a pilot. She also flew for the Bureau of Air Commerce. Love entered air races in 1936 and 1937, competing In the National Air Races in Los Angeles and Detroit. After finishing second in the Detroit race, she stopped competing. In 1937 and 1938, Love worked as a test pilot, alongside famous air racer Frank Hawks, for the Gwinn Air Car Company, performing tests on various aircraft modifications and innovations. In one project, she served as a test pilot on the new tricycle landing gear, which subsequently became standard on most aircraft. In another project, she helped mark water towers with town names as a navigational aid for pilots.

In May 1940, after World War II broke out in Europe, Love wrote to Lt. Col. Robert Olds, then in the Plans Division of US Air Corps Headquarters but, who a year later, would be in charge of establishing the Air Corps Ferrying Command, that she had found 49 excellent women pilots. This group called &quot;the originals&quot; each had more than 1,000 flying hours. She proposed that the women could help transport aircraft from factories to bases. Olds submitted a plan for integrating civilian female pilots in the Ferrying Command to Gen. Hap Arnold, commanding general of the United States Army Air Forces, who turned it down after Jacqueline Cochran extracted a promise from him not to act on any proposal regarding women pilots that did not make them commissioned officers commanded by women.

==World War II==

In early 1942, her husband Robert Love was called to active duty in the Munitions Building, Washington, D. C. as the deputy chief of staff of the Ferrying Command. Love accompanied him to Washington and on March 11, took a civil service position in Baltimore, Maryland with the Operations Office of the Ferrying Command&#x27;s Northeast Sector (soon redesignated 2nd Ferrying Group), Domestic Division. The Domestic Division, commanded by Col. William H. Tunner, was designated Ferrying Division, Air Transport Command (ATC) a few months later.

Love piloted her own aircraft on her daily commute from the couple&#x27;s home in Washington, D. C. The offices of Major Love and Col. Tunner were near each other, and during a conversation between them, her piloting skills caught the attention of Tunner, who was scouring the country for skilled pilots to deliver aircraft from factories to fields. Major Love suggested Tunner speak to his wife directly.

Love convinced Tunner that the idea of using experienced women pilots to supplement the existing pilot force was a good one. He then asked her to write up a proposal for a women&#x27;s ferrying division. When his recommendation that she (and the other female pilots) be commissioned into the Women&#x27;s Army Corps (WAAC) was denied, he appointed her to his staff as Executive of Women&#x27;s Pilots. Within a few months, she had recruited 30 experienced female pilots to join the newly created Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS); 28 graduated from training. Love became their commander. In September 1942, the women pilots began flying from New Castle Army Air Field, Wilmington, Delaware, under the auspices of the 2nd Ferrying Group.

By June 1943, Love was commanding four different squadrons of WAFS at Love Field, Texas; New Castle, Delaware; Romulus, Michigan and Long Beach, California. The WAFS&#x27; number had greatly increased because of the addition of graduates of the Women&#x27;s Flying Training Detachment (WFTD) at Avenger Field, Sweetwater, Texas, an organization championed and headed by Jacqueline Cochran.

On August 5, 1943, the WAFS merged with the WFTD and became a single entity: the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP). Love was named the executive for all WASP ferrying operations. Under her command, female pilots flew almost every type military aircraft then in the Army Air Forces&#x27; inventory, and their record of achievement proved remarkable. Love was certified in 19 military aircraft, becoming the first woman to be certified to fly the latest military aircraft, including the Douglas C-54 Skymaster, North American B-25 Mitchell, and along with Betty Gillies, the first to fly the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. In Dallas, Love was also checked out on the North American P-51 Mustang, the USAAF&#x27;s &quot;hottest&quot; fighter.

In 1944, after the WASPs were disbanded, Love continued to work on reports detailing the work of the Air Transport Command.

==Post-war==
At the end of the war, Love and her husband had the unique distinction of being decorated simultaneously. He received the Distinguished Service Medal, and she the Air Medal for her &quot;Operational leadership in the successful training and assignment of over 300 qualified women fliers in the flying of advanced military aircraft.&quot;

After the war, Love had three daughters, but she continued as an aviation industry leader, as well as a champion for recognition as military veterans for the women who had served as WASPs. In 1948, after the creation of the United States Air Force, she was given the rank of lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve.

Love died of cancer at the age of 62 in 1976, so she did not live to see the WASPs being accorded military recognition three years later.

==Legacy==

Love was posthumously inducted into the Airlift/Tanker Association&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1996, the Michigan Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1997, and the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio in 2005. A statue dedicated to Nancy Harkness Love is at the New Castle County Airport in Delaware.

<text>Gao Jianli () was a musician of the Chinese state of Yan, during the Warring States period, who played a struck zither called &quot;zhu&quot; () or &quot;ji zhu&quot; ().

==Legend==
After his friend Jing Ke was killed during his assassination attempt on Qin Shi Huang, Gao changed his name and became an assistant in a wine shop, fearing reprisals from Qin Shi Huang. 

Gao Jianli&#x27;s skill as a &quot;zhu&quot; player eventually came to the attention of the owner of the wine shop. Qin Shi Huang heard about Gao&#x27;s ability and summoned Gao to play for him. When Gao&#x27;s identity was eventually revealed, Qin Shi Huang had him blinded, but pardoned him due to his love of music.

After a few performances the Emperor relaxed his guarding of Gao. Sensing the change, Gao secretly hid pieces of lead in the instrument, and when he got an opportunity, attempted to assassinate the Emperor himself, without success. Gao was subsequently executed.

<text>The NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, branded as March Madness, is a single-elimination tournament played in the United States to determine the men&#x27;s college basketball national champion of the Division I level in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Played mostly during March, the tournament consists of 68 teams and was first conducted in 1939. Known for its upsets of favored teams, it has become one of the biggest annual sporting events in the US.

The 68-team format was adopted in 2011; it had remained largely unchanged since 1985 when it expanded to 64 teams. Before then, the tournament size varied from as little as 8 to as many as 53. The field was restricted to conference champions until at-large bids were extended in 1975 and teams were not fully seeded until 1979. In 2020, the tournament was cancelled for the first time due to the COVID-19 pandemic; in the subsequent season, the tournament was contested completely in the state of Indiana as a precaution.

Thirty-seven different schools have won the tournament to date. UCLA has the most with 11 championships; their coach John Wooden has the most titles of any coach with 10. The University of Kentucky (UK) has eight championships, the University of Connecticut (UConn) and the University of North Carolina have six championships, Duke University and Indiana University have five championships, the University of Kansas (KU) has four championships, and Villanova University has three championships. Seven programs are tied with two national championships, and 23 teams have won the national championship once.

All tournament games are broadcast by CBS, TBS, TNT, and truTV under the program name &quot;NCAA March Madness&quot;. With a contract through 2032, Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discovery pay $891 million annually for the broadcast rights. The NCAA distributes revenue to participating teams based on how far they advance, which provides significant funding for college athletics. The tournament has become part of American popular culture through bracket contests that award money and other prizes for correctly predicting the outcomes of the most games. In 2023, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; reported that an estimated 60 to 100 million brackets are filled out each year.

== History ==

=== Early era (1939–1970) ===
The first tournament was held in 1939 and was won by Oregon. It was the idea of Ohio State coach Harold Olsen. The National Association of Basketball Coaches operated the first tournament for the NCAA.

From 1939 to 1950, the NCAA tournament consisted of eight teams, with each selected from a geographical district. Multiple conferences were considered part of each district, such as the Missouri Valley and the Big Seven conferences in one district and the Southern and Southeastern conferences in another, which often led to top-ranked teams being left out of the tournament. The issue came to a head in 1950, when the NCAA suggested that third-ranked Kentucky and fifth-ranked North Carolina State compete in a playoff game for a bid, but Kentucky refused, believing they should be given the bid as the higher-ranked team. In response, the NCAA doubled the field to 16 in 1951, adding two additional districts and six spots for at-large teams. Conferences could still only have one team in the tournament, but multiple conferences from the same geographic district could now be included through at-large bids. This development helped the NCAA compete with the National Invitation Tournament for prestige.

In the eight team format, the tournament was split into the East and West Regions, with champions meeting in the national championship game. The first two rounds for each region were conducted at the same site and the national championship and, from 1946, consolation game occurred a week later. Some years, the site of the national championship was the same site as a regional championship and in other years a new site. With the expansion to 16 teams, the tournament retained the original format of the national semifinals being the regional finals in 1951. For the 1952 tournament, there were four regions named East-1, East-2, West-1, West-2, all played at separate sites. The regional champions met for the national semifinals and championship at a separate location a week later, establishing the format with two final rounds of the tournament (although the name &quot;Final Four&quot; would not be used in branding until the 1980s).

The 1953 tournament expanded to include 22 teams and added a fifth round, with ten teams receiving a bye to the regional semifinals. The number of teams would fluctuate from 22 to 25 teams over the next two decades, but the number of rounds remained the same. The double region naming was kept until 1956, when the regions were named the East, Midwest, West, and Far West. In 1957, the regions were named East, Mideast, Midwest, and West, which remained until 1985. Regions were paired in the national semifinals based on their geographic locations, with the two eastern regions meeting in one semifinal and two western regions meeting in the other semifinal.

Beginning in 1946, a national third-place game was held before the championship game. Regional third-place games were played in the West from 1939 and the East from 1941. Despite expansion in 1951, there were still only two regions, each with a third-place game. The 1952 tournament had four regions each with a third-place game.

This era of the tournament was characterized by competition with the National Invitation Tournament. Founded by the Metropolitan Basketball Writers Association one year before the NCAA tournament, the NIT was held entirely in New York City at Madison Square Garden. Because New York was the center of the press in the United States, the NIT often received more coverage than the NCAA tournament in early years. Additionally, good teams were often excluded from the NCAA tournament because each conference could only have one bid and conference champions were even excluded because of the 8-district system before 1950. Teams often competed in both tournaments during the first decade, with City College of New York winning both the NIT and NCAA tournament in 1950. Soon after, the NCAA banned teams from participating in both tournaments.

=== Pre-modern era (1971–1984) ===
Two major changes over the course of the early 1970s led to the NCAA becoming the preeminent post-season tournament for college basketball. First, the NCAA added a rule in 1971 that banned teams who declined an invitation to the NCAA tournament from participating in other post-season tournaments. This was in response to eighth-ranked Marquette declining its invitation in 1970 and instead participating in and winning the NIT after coach Al McGuire complained about their regional placement. Since then, the NCAA tournament has clearly been the major one, with conference champions and the majority of the top-ranked teams participating. Second, the NCAA allowed multiple teams per conference starting in 1975. This was in response to several highly ranked teams being denied bids during the early 1970s. These included South Carolina in 1970, which was undefeated in conference play but lost in the ACC tournament; second-ranked USC in 1971, which was left out because their conference was represented by top-ranked UCLA; and Maryland in 1974, which was ranked #3 but lost the ACC tournament championship game to eventual national champion North Carolina State.

To accommodate at-large bids, the tournament expanded in 1975 to include 32 teams, allowing a second team to represent a conference in addition to the conference champion, and eliminated byes. In 1979, the tournament expanded to 40 teams and added a sixth round; 24 teams received byes to the second round. Eight more teams were added in 1980 with only 16 teams receiving byes, and the restriction on the number of at-large bids from a conference was removed. In 1983, a seventh round with four play-in games was added; an additional play-in game was added in 1984. Beginning in 1973, the regional pairings for the national semifinals were rotated on a yearly basis instead of the two eastern and two western regions always playing.

Seeding also began during this era, adding drama and ensuring better teams had better paths to the Final Four. In 1978, teams were seeded in two separate pools based on their qualification method. Each region had four teams which automatically qualified ranked Q1–Q4 and four teams which received an at-large bid ranked L1–L4. In 1979, all teams in each region were seeded 1 through 10, without regards for their qualification method.

The national semifinals were moved to Saturday and the championship was moved to Monday evening in 1973, where they have remained since. Before the championship had been played on Saturday and the semifinals two days before.

The third-place games were eliminated during this era, with the last regional third-place games played in 1975 and the last national third-place game played in 1981.

=== Modern era (1985–present) ===
In 1985, the tournament expanded to 64 teams, eliminating all byes and play-ins. For the first time, all teams had to win six games to win the tournament. This expansion led to increased media coverage and popularity in American culture. Until 2001, the First and Second Rounds occurred at two sites in each region.

In 1985, the Mideast Region was renamed the Southeast Region. In 1997, the Southeast Region became the South Region. From 2004 to 2006, the regions were named after their host cities, e.g. the Phoenix regional in 2004, the Chicago regional in 2005, and the Minneapolis regional in 2006, but reverted to the traditional geographic designations beginning in 2007. For the 2011 tournament, the South Region was the Southeast Region and the Midwest Region the Southwest Region; both returned to their previous names in 2012.

The 1996 Final Four was the last to take place in a venue built specifically for basketball. Since then, the Final Four has exclusively been played in large indoor football stadiums.

Beginning in 2001, the field was expanded from 64 to 65 teams, adding to the tournament what was informally known as the &quot;play-in game&quot;. This was in response to the creation of the Mountain West Conference during 1999. Originally, the winner of the Mountain West&#x27;s tournament did not receive an automatic bid, as doing so would have eliminated one of the at-large bids. As an alternative to eliminating an at-large bid, the NCAA expanded the tournament to 65 teams. The #64 and #65 seeds were seeded in a regional bracket as 16 seeds, and then played the opening round game on the Tuesday preceding the first weekend of the tournament. This game was always played at the University of Dayton Arena in Dayton, Ohio.

Starting in 2004, the selection committee revealed the overall rankings among the #1 seeds. Based on these rankings, the regions were paired so that the #1 overall seed would play the #4 overall seed in a national semifinal if both teams made the Final Four. This was to prevent the top two teams from meeting before the finals, as was largely considered the case in 1996 when Kentucky played Massachusetts in the Final Four. Previously, regional pairings rotated yearly.

In 2010, there was speculation about increasing the tournament size to as many as 128 teams. On April 1, 2010, the NCAA announced that it was looking at expanding to 96 teams for 2011. However, three weeks later the NCAA announced a new television contract with CBS/Turner that expanded the field to 68 teams, instead of 96, starting in 2011. The First Four was created by the addition of three play-in games. Two of the First Four games pit 16 seeds against each other. The two other games, however, pit the last at-large bids against each other. The seeding for the at-large teams will be determined by the selection committee and fluctuates based on the true seed ranking of the teams. Explaining the reasoning for this format, selection committee chairman Dan Guerrero said, &quot;We felt if we were going to expand the field it would create better drama for the tournament if the First Four was much more exciting. They could all be on the 10 line or the 12 line or the 11 line.&quot; As part of this expansion, the round of 64 was renamed the Second Round and the round of 32 was renamed the Third Round, with the First Four being officially the First Round. In 2016, the rounds of 64 and 32 returned to their previous names of the First Round and the Second Round and the First Four became the official name of the opening round.

In 2016, the NCAA introduced a new &quot;NCAA March Madness&quot; logo for tournament-wide branding, which included bespoke tourney-exclusive courts at each of the tournament venues from the same manufacturer with the same floor composition across each round. Previously, the NCAA would use the venue&#x27;s existing default floor (be it solely for college basketball or a dual-use NBA/college floor) with tournament and NCAA decals applied.

Beginning in 2017, the #1 overall seed picks the sites for their first and second round games and their potential regional games. Additionally, the selection committee began releasing the top 16 seeds three weeks before Selection Sunday as a bracket preview.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the NCAA cancelled the 2020 tournament. Initially, the NCAA discussed holding a shortened version with only 16 teams in the Final Four host city of Atlanta. Once the vast scale of the pandemic was understood, the NCAA cancelled the tournament, making it the first edition not to be held, and decided against releasing the brackets that the Selection Committee had been working on.

In 2021, the tournament was held entirely in the state of Indiana to reduce travel. This was to date the only time the tournament was conducted in one state. As a COVID-19 precaution, all participating teams were required to stay in NCAA-provided accommodations until they lost. The schedule was adjusted to provided extended time for COVID-19 evaluation before the tournament began, with the First Four occurring entirely on Thursday, the First and Second Rounds pushed one day back to a Friday-Monday window, and the Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight pushed to a Friday-Monday window as well. Teams ranked 69–72 by the Selection Committee were put on &quot;standby&quot; to replace any team that withdrew from the tournament due to COVID-19 protocols during the 48 hours after the brackets were announced. Only one game was declared a no contest due to COVID-19, with Oregon advancing to the second round because VCU could not participate due to COVID-19 protocols. VCU was not replaced by one of the first four teams out because the COVID-19 infections started more than two days after the brackets were announced. The tournament returned to its regular format in 2022.

In response to protests from players in the 2021 women&#x27;s tournament about the differing facility quality and branding, both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tournaments were branded as &quot;NCAA March Madness&quot; starting in 2022 with variations of the same tournament-wide logo used by the men&#x27;s tournament. Additionally, the Final Four for the men&#x27;s tournament was branded as the &quot;Men&#x27;s Final Four&quot; beginning in 2022, reflecting the &quot;Women&#x27;s Final Four&quot; branding in use for that tournament since 1987.

=== Evolution overview ===
==Format==

The tournament consists of 68 teams competing in seven rounds of a single-elimination bracket. Thirty-two teams automatically qualify for the tournament by winning their conference tournament, played during the two weeks before the tournament, and thirty-six teams qualify by receiving an at-large bid based on their performance during the season. The Selection Committee determines the at-large bids, ranks all the teams 1 to 68, and places the teams in the bracket, all of which is revealed publicly on the Sunday before the tournament, dubbed &quot;Selection Sunday&quot; by the media and fans. There is no reseeding during the tournament and matchups in each subsequent round are predetermined by the bracket.

The tournament is divided into four regions, with each region having sixteen to eighteen teams. Regions are named after the U.S. geographic area of the city hosting each regional semifinal and regional final (the tournament&#x27;s third and 4th round overall). Host cities for all regions vary from year to year.

The tournament is played over three weekends, with two rounds occurring each weekend. Before the first weekend, eight teams compete in the First Four to advance to the first round. Two games pair the lowest-ranked conference champions and two games pair the lowest-ranked at-large qualifiers. The first and second rounds are played during the first weekend, the regional semifinals and regional finals during the second weekend, and the national semifinals and championship game during the third weekend. Regional rounds are branded as the Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight and the third weekend is branded as the Final Four, all named after the number of teams remaining at the beginning of the round. All games, including the First Four, are scheduled so that teams will have one rest day between each game. This format has been in use since 2011, with minor changes to the schedule in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Seeding and bracket ===

The Selection Committee, which includes conference commissioners and university athletic directors appointed by the NCAA, determines the bracket during the week before the tournament. Since the results of several conference tournaments occurring during the same week can significantly impact the bracket, the Committee often makes several brackets for different results.

To make the bracket, the Committee ranks the whole field from 1 to 68; these are referred to as the &quot;true seed&quot;. The committee then divides the teams amongst the four regions, giving each a seed between No. 1 and No. 16. The same four seeds in all the regions are referred to as the &quot;seed line&quot; (i.e. the No. 6 seed line). Eight teams are doubled up and compete in the First Four. Two of the paired teams compete for No. 16 seeds, and the other two paired teams are the last at-large teams awarded bids to the tournament and compete for a seed line in the No. 10 to No. 14 range, which varies year to year based on the true seeds of the teams overall.

The top four overall seeds are placed as No. 1 seeds in each region. The regions are paired so that if all the No. 1 seeds reached the Final Four true seed No. 1 would play No. 4 and No. 2 would play No. 3. The No. 2 teams are preferably placed so that the No. 5 true seed will not be paired with the No. 1 true seed. The committee ensures competitive balance among the top four seeds in each region by adding the true seed values up and comparing the values among the regions. If there is significant deviation, some teams will be moved among the regions to balance the true seed distribution.

If a conference has two to four teams in the top four seeds, they will be placed in different regions. Otherwise, teams from the same conference are placed to avoid a rematch before the regional finals if they have played three or more times in the season, the regional semifinals if they have played twice, or the second round if they have played once. Additionally, the committee is advised to avoid rematches from the regular season and the previous years&#x27; tournament in the First Four. Finally, the committee will attempt to ensure that a team is not moved out of their preferred geographical region an inordinate number of times based on their placement in the previous two tournaments. To follow these rules and preferences, the committee may move a team off of their expected seed line. Thus, for example, the 40th overall ranked team, originally slated to be a No. 10 seed within a particular region, may instead be moved up to a No. 9 seed or moved down to a No. 11 seed.

Since 2012, the committee has released the No. 1 to 68 true seed list after announcing the bracket.
Since 2017, the Selection Committee has released a list of the top 16 teams three weeks before Selection Sunday. This list does not guarantee any team a bid, as the Committee re-ranks all teams when starting the final selection process.
The seed line of the four at-large teams competing in the First Four has varied each year, depending on the overall ranking of the at-large teams in the field.

=== Venues ===
In the men&#x27;s tournament, all sites are nominally neutral; teams are prohibited from playing tournament games on their home courts during the first, second, and regional rounds. Under NCAA rules, any court on which a team hosts more than three regular-season games (not including preseason or conference tournament games) is considered a &quot;home court&quot;. For the First Four and the Final Four, the home court prohibition does not apply because only one venue hosts these rounds. The First Four is regularly hosted by the Dayton Flyers; as such, the team competed on their home court in 2015. Because the Final Four is hosted at indoor football stadiums, it is unlikely that a team will play on their home court in the future. The last time this was possible was the 1996 when the Continental Airlines Arena, home court of Seton Hall, hosted.

For the first and second rounds, eight venues host games, four on each day of the round. Each venue hosts two sets of four teams, referred to as &quot;pods.&quot; To limit travel, teams are placed in pods closer to their home unless seeding rules would prevent it. Because each pod includes a top 4 seed, the highest ranked teams normally get the closest sites.

The possible pods by seeding are:
* Pod A: 1 v. 16 and 8 v. 9
* Pod B: 2 v. 15 and 7 v. 10
* Pod C: 3 v. 14 and 6 v. 11
* Pod D: 4 v. 13 and 5 v. 12

:&quot;The following is a list of all schools that have won at least one NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament, along with the year(s) in which they won their championship(s).&quot;
*&quot;Vacated title not included&quot;





== Appearances ==
A total of 333 teams have appeared in the NCAA tournament since 1939. Because the NCAA did not split into divisions until 1957, some schools that have appeared in the tournament are no longer in Division I. Among Division I schools, 46 have never made the tournament, including 11 that are ineligible because they are transitioning to Division I.

== Rituals and influence ==

===Cutting down the nets===
As a tournament ritual, the winning team cuts down the nets at the end of regional championship games as well as the national championship game. Starting with the seniors, and moving down by classes, players each cut a single strand off each net; the head coach cuts the last strand connecting the net to the hoop, claiming the net itself. An exception to the head coach cutting the last strand came in 2013, when Louisville head coach Rick Pitino gave that honor to Kevin Ware, who had suffered a catastrophic leg injury during the tournament. This tradition is credited to Everett Case, the coach of North Carolina State, who stood on his players&#x27; shoulders to accomplish the feat after the Wolfpack won the Southern Conference tournament in 1947. CBS, since 1987 and yearly to 2015, in the odd-numbered years since 2017, and TBS, since 2016, the even-numbered years, close out the tournament with &quot;One Shining Moment&quot;, performed by Luther Vandross.

===Team awards===
Just as the Olympics awards gold, silver, and bronze medals for first, second, and third place, respectively, the NCAA awards the national champions a gold-plated wooden NCAA national championship trophy. The loser of the championship game receives a silver-plated national runner-up trophy for second place. Since 2006, all four Final Four teams receive a bronze plated NCAA regional championship trophy; prior to 2006, only the teams who did not make the title game received bronze plated trophies for being a semifinalist.

The champions also receive a commemorative gold championship ring, and the other three Final Four teams receive Final Four rings.

The National Association of Basketball Coaches also presents a more elaborate marble/crystal trophy to the winning team. Ostensibly, this award is given for taking the top position in the NABC&#x27;s end-of-season poll, but this is invariably the same as the NCAA championship game winner. In 2005, Siemens AG acquired naming rights to the NABC trophy, which is now called the Siemens Trophy. Formerly, the NABC trophy was presented right after the standard NCAA championship trophy, but this caused some confusion. Since 2006, the Siemens/NABC trophy has been presented separately at a press conference the day after the game.

===Most Outstanding Player===
After the championship trophy is awarded, one player is selected and then awarded the Most Outstanding Player award (which almost always comes from the championship team). It is not intended to be the same as a Most &quot;Valuable&quot; Player award although it is sometimes informally referred to as such.

===Influence on the NBA draft===
Because the NBA draft takes place just three months after the NCAA tournament, NBA executives have to decide how players&#x27; performances in a maximum of seven games, from the First Four to the championship game, should affect their draft decisions. A 2012 study for the National Bureau of Economic Research explores how the March tournament affects the way that professional teams behave in the June draft. The study is based on data from 1997 to 2010 that looks at how college tournament standouts performed at the NBA level.

The researchers determined that a player who outperforms his regular season averages or who is on a team that wins more games than its seed would indicate will be drafted higher than he otherwise would have been. At the same time, the study indicated that professional teams do not take college tournament performance into consideration as much as they should, as success in the tournament correlates with elite professional accomplishment, particularly top-level success. &quot;If anything, NBA teams undervalue the signal provided by unexpected performance in the NCAA March Madness tournament as a predictor of future NBA success.&quot;

==Television coverage and revenues==

===Television contracts===
Since 2011, the NCAA has had a joint contract with CBS and Warner Bros. Discovery. The coverage of the tournament is split between CBS, TNT, TBS, and truTV.

Broadcasters from CBS, TBS, and TNT&#x27;s sports coverage are shared across all four networks, with CBS&#x27; college basketball teams supplemented with TNT&#x27;s NBA teams, while studio segments take place at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City and TNT&#x27;s studios in Atlanta. In the New York–based studio shows, CBS&#x27; Adam Zucker and Clark Kellogg are joined by Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and Charles Barkley of TNT&#x27;s &quot;Inside the NBA&quot; while Seth Davis and Jay Wright of CBS assist with Adam Lefkoe and Candace Parker of TNT&#x27;s Tuesday night NBA coverage. While three of TNT&#x27;s NBA voices, Kevin Harlan, Ian Eagle, and Spero Dedes are already employed by CBS in other capacities, TNT also lends analysts Stan Van Gundy, Jim Jackson, Grant Hill, and Steve Smith, secondary play-by-play man Brian Anderson, and reporters Allie LaForce and Lauren Shehadi, the latter being from TBS&#x27;s MLB coverage, to CBS. In turn, CBS announcers Brad Nessler, Andrew Catalon, and Tom McCarthy appear on WBD network broadcasts along with analysts Jim Spanarkel, Bill Raftery, Dan Bonner, Steve Lappas, Brendan Haywood, and Avery Johnson, as well as reporters Tracy Wolfson, Evan Washburn, A. J. Ross, and Jon Rothstein, and rules analyst Gene Steratore. Announcers from other networks like Lisa Byington and Robbie Hummel from Fox, the latter also working for Peacock and Big Ten Network, Debbie Antonelli from ESPN, Jamie Erdahl from NFL Network, and Andy Katz from NCAA.com are also lent to CBS and TNT.

The most recent transaction in 2016 renews the contract through 2032 and provides for the nationwide broadcast each year of all games of the tournament. All First Four games air on truTV. A featured first- or second-round game in each time &quot;window&quot; is broadcast on CBS, while all other games are shown either on TBS, TNT or truTV. The regional semifinals, better known as the Sweet Sixteen, are split between CBS and TBS. CBS had the exclusive rights to the regional finals, also known as the Elite Eight, through 2014. That exclusivity extended to the entire Final Four as well, but after the 2013 tournament Turner Sports elected to exercise a contractual option for 2014 and 2015 giving TBS broadcast rights to the national semifinal matchups. CBS kept its national championship game rights.

Since 2015, CBS and TBS split coverage of the Elite Eight. Since 2016 CBS and TBS alternate coverage of the Final Four and national championship game, with TBS getting the final two rounds in even-numbered years, and CBS getting the games in odd-numbered years. &quot;March Madness On Demand&quot; would remain unchanged, although Turner was allowed to develop their own service.

The CBS broadcast provides the NCAA with over $500 million annually, and makes up over 90% of the NCAA&#x27;s annual revenue. The revenues from the multibillion-dollar television contract are divided among the Division I basketball playing schools and conferences as follows:
* 1/6 of the money goes directly to the schools based on how many sports they play (one &quot;share&quot; for each sport starting with 14, which is the minimum needed for Division I membership).
* 1/3 of the money goes directly to the schools based on how many scholarships they give out (one share for each of the first 50, two for each of the next 50, ten for each of the next 50, and 20 for each scholarship above 150).
* 1/2 of the money goes to the conferences based on how well they did in the six previous men&#x27;s basketball tournaments (counting each year separately, one share for each team getting in, and one share for each win except in the Final Four and, prior to the 2008 tournament, the Play-in game). In 2007, based on the 2001 through 2006 tournaments, the Big East received over $14.85 million, while the eight conferences that did not win a first-round game in those six years received slightly more than $1 million each. Most conferences distribute most of the revenue evenly to its member institutions, regardless of performance. By 2021, the value of the shares or &quot;units&quot; to a conference was worth US$337,141.

===History of television coverage===
CBS has been the major partner of the NCAA in televising the tournament since 1982, but there have been many changes in coverage since the tournament was first broadcast in 1969.

====Early broadcast coverage====
From 1969 to 1981, the NCAA tournament aired on NBC, but not all games were televised. The early rounds, in particular, were not always seen on TV.

In 1982, CBS obtained broadcast television rights to the NCAA tournament.

====ESPN &amp; CBS share coverage====
In 1980, ESPN began showing the opening rounds of the tournament. This was the network&#x27;s first contract signed with the NCAA for a major sport, and helped to establish ESPN&#x27;s following among college basketball fans. ESPN showed six first-round games on Thursday and again on Friday, with CBS, from 1982 to 1990, then picking up a seventh game at 11:30 pm ET. Thus, 14 of 32 first-round games were televised. ESPN also re-ran games overnight. At the time, there was only one ESPN network, with no ability to split its signal regionally, so ESPN showed only the most competitive games. During the 1980s, the tournament&#x27;s popularity on television soared.

====CBS takes over====
However, ESPN became a victim of its own success, as CBS was awarded the rights to cover all games of the NCAA tournament, starting in 1991. Only with the introduction of the so-called &quot;play-in&quot; game (between the 64 seed and the 65 seed) in the 2000s, did ESPN get back in the game (and actually, the first time this &quot;play-in&quot; game was played in 2001, the game was aired on The Nashville Network, using CBS graphics and announcers, as both CBS and TNN were both owned by Viacom at the time.

Through 2010, CBS broadcast the remaining 63 games of the NCAA tournament proper. Most areas saw only eight of 32 first-round games, seven of 16 second-round games, and four of eight regional semifinal games (out of the possible 56 games during these rounds; there would be some exceptions to this rule in the 2000s). Coverage preempted regular programming on the network, except during a 2-hour window from about 5 ET until 7 ET when the local affiliates could show programming. The CBS format resulted in far fewer hours of first-round coverage than under the old ESPN format but allowed the games to reach a much larger audience than ESPN was able to reach.

During this period of near-exclusivity by CBS, the network provided to its local affiliates three types of feeds from each venue: &quot;constant feed&quot;, &quot;swing feed&quot;, and &quot;flex feed&quot;. Constant feeds remained primarily on a given game, and were used primarily by stations with a clear local interest in a particular game. Despite its name, a constant feed occasionally veered away to other games for brief updates (as is typical in most American sports coverage), but coverage generally remained with the initial game. A swing feed tended to stay on games believed to be of natural interest to the locality, such as teams from local conferences, but may leave that game to go to other games that during their progress become close matches. On a flex feed, coverage bounced around from one venue to another, depending on action at the various games in progress. If one game was a blowout, coverage could switch to a more competitive game. A flex feed was provided when there were no games with a significant natural local interest for the stations carrying them, which allowed the flex game to be the best game in progress. Station feeds were planned in advance and stations had the option of requesting either constant or flex feed for various games.

====Viewing options emerge====
In 1999, DirecTV began broadcasting all games otherwise not shown on local television with its &quot;Mega March Madness&quot; premium package. The DirecTV system used the subscriber&#x27;s ZIP code to black out games which could be seen on broadcast television. Prior to that, all games were available on C-Band satellite and were picked up by sports bars.

In 2003, CBS struck a deal with Yahoo! to offer live streaming of the first three rounds of games under its Yahoo! Platinum service, for $16.95 a month. In 2004, CBS began selling viewers access to &quot;March Madness On Demand&quot;, which provided games not otherwise shown on broadcast television; the service was free for AOL subscribers. In 2006, &quot;March Madness On Demand&quot; was made free, and continued to be so to online users through the 2011 tournament. For 2012, it once again became a pay service, with a single payment of $3.99 providing access to all 67 tournament games. In 2013, the service, now renamed &quot;March Madness Live&quot;, was again made free, but uses Turner&#x27;s rights and infrastructure for TV Everywhere, which requires sign-in though the password of a customer&#x27;s cable or satellite provider to watch games, both via PC/Mac and mobile devices. Those that do not have a cable or satellite service or one not participating in Turner&#x27;s TV Everywhere are restricted to games carried on the CBS national feed and three hours (originally four) of other games without sign-in, or coverage via Westwood One&#x27;s radio coverage. Effective with the 2018 tournament, the national semifinals and final are under TV Everywhere restrictions if they are aired by Turner networks; before then, those particular games were not subject to said restrictions.

In addition, CBS Sports Network (formerly CBS College Sports Network) had broadcast two &quot;late early&quot; games that would not otherwise be broadcast nationally. These were the second games in the daytime session in the Pacific Time Zone, to avoid starting games before 10 AM. These games are also available via &quot;March Madness Live&quot; and on CBS affiliates in the market areas of the team playing. In other markets, newscasts, local programming or preempted CBS morning programming are aired. CBSSN is scheduled to continue broadcasting the official pregame and postgame shows and press conferences from the teams involved, along with overnight replays.

====HDTV coverage====
The Final Four has been broadcast in HDTV since 1999. From 2000 to 2004, only one first/second round site and one regional site were designated as HDTV sites. In 2005, all regional games were broadcast in HDTV, and four first and second round sites were designated for HDTV coverage. Local stations broadcasting in both digital and analog had the option of airing separate games on their HD and SD channels, to take advantage of the available high definition coverage. Beginning in 2007, all games in the tournament (including all first and second-round games) were available in high definition, and local stations were required to air the same game on both their analog and digital channels. However, due to satellite limitations, first round &quot;constant&quot; feeds were only available in standard definition. Moreover, some digital television stations, such as WRAL-TV in Raleigh, North Carolina, choose not to participate in HDTV broadcasts of the first and second rounds and the regional semifinals, and used their available bandwidth to split their signal into digital subchannels to show &quot;all&quot; games going on simultaneously. By 2008, upgrades at the CBS broadcast center allowed all feeds, flex and constant, to be in HD for the tournament.

===International broadcasts===

As of 2011, ESPN International holds international broadcast rights to the tournament, distributing coverage to its co-owned networks and other broadcasters. ESPN produces the world feed for broadcasts of the Final Four and championship game, produced using &quot;ESPN College Basketball&quot; staff and commentators.

Since 1979, the NCAA has seeded each region. Beginning in 2004, the Selection Committee announced the rankings among the 1 seeds, designating an &quot;overall #1 seed&quot; and pairing the regions so that the overall #1 seed would meet the #4 overall seed in the Final Four if both advanced. The overall rankings are denoted with the numbers in parentheses. The following teams received the top ranking in each region:
*&quot;Vacated&quot;Bold denotes team also won tournament

====No. 1 seeds by school====
Last updated through 2024 tournament.*&quot;Vacated appearances not included (see #1 seeds by year and region)&quot;

==== All No. 1 seeds in the Final Four ====

Only once did all four No. 1 seeds make it to the Final Four:
* 2008 – Kansas (champion), North Carolina, UCLA, Memphis

==== Final Fours without a No. 1 seed ====
Four times (including three since the field expanded to 64 teams) the Final Four has been without a No. 1 seed:
* 1980 – No. 2 Louisville (champion), No. 8 UCLA (runner-up), No. 5 Iowa, No. 6 Purdue
* 2006 – No. 3 Florida (champion), No. 2 UCLA (runner-up), No. 4 LSU, No. 11 George Mason
* 2011 – No. 3 Connecticut (champion), No. 8 Butler (runner-up), No. 4 Kentucky, No. 11 VCU
* 2023 – No. 4 UConn (champion), No. 5 San Diego State (runner-up), No. 5 Miami (FL), No. 9 Florida Atlantic

Since 1985, there have been 4 instances of three No. 1 seeds reaching the Final Four; 13 instances of two No. 1 seeds making it; and 14 instances of just one No. 1 seed reaching the Final Four. 2023 was the first Final Four without a 1, 2, or 3 seed.

==== No. 1 seeds in the championship game ====
There have been ten occasions (nine times since the field expanded to 64) that the championship game has been played between two No. 1 seeds:
* 1982 – North Carolina beat Georgetown
* 1993 – North Carolina beat Michigan
* 1999 – Connecticut beat Duke
* 2005 – North Carolina beat Illinois
* 2007 – Florida beat Ohio State
* 2008 – Kansas beat Memphis
* 2015 – Duke beat Wisconsin
* 2017 – North Carolina beat Gonzaga
* 2021 – Baylor beat Gonzaga
* 2024 – UConn beat Purdue

Since 1985 there have been 18 instances of one No. 1 seed reaching the Championship Game (No. 1 seeds are 13–5 against other seeds in the title game) and 8 instances where no No. 1 seed made it to the title game.

==== Additional No. 1 seed stats ====
* In 1997, Arizona became the only team to beat three No. 1 seeds in a single tournament. Arizona (No. 4 seed) beat Kansas in its own southeast region, then beat North Carolina in the Final Four and finally Kentucky in the championship game. The most No. 1 seeds any team can face in the tournament is three (provided that the team itself is not a No. 1 seed, in which case it can only face two No. 1 seeds in the tournament).
* In 2011, the highest seed to advance to the Final Four was No. 3 seed Connecticut, making the 2011 tournament the first time that neither a No. 1 seed nor a No. 2 seed advanced into the final weekend of play. In the same tournament, Butler made history as the first program to make consecutive Final Fours while not being seeded No. 1 or No. 2 in either season.
* There have been 16 teams that have entered the tournament unbeaten. Four of those teams were from UCLA, and all those Bruin teams won each of those tournaments. However, of the other 12 teams entering the tournament unbeaten, just three went on to win the tournament. For details, see table below.
* In 1980, 1981, and 1982, when the tournament was 48 teams, DePaul was seeded No. 1 but was defeated in the first round.
* Theoretically, a No. 1 seed&#x27;s most difficult six-game path to win the tournament is to defeat a No. 16, a No. 8, a No. 4, a No. 2, a No. 1, and a No. 1 – the highest possible opposing seeds in successive rounds. No No. 1 seed has ever won all six such games, though two teams have won the first five.
** In the 2002 tournament, Maryland reached the final after defeating teams seeded 16/8/4/2/1; they won the tournament after defeating No. 5 Indiana in the final.
** In the 2015 tournament, Wisconsin reached the final after defeating teams seeded 16/8/4/2/1. In the final, they faced No. 1 Duke with a chance to complete the full six-game path. However, Wisconsin lost the final.
* In 2023, no No. 1 seeds advanced to the Elite Eight for the first time ever. Purdue lost to Fairleigh Dickinson in the first round; Kansas lost to Arkansas in the second round, and both Alabama and Houston lost in the Sweet Sixteen, respectively to San Diego State and Miami.

=== Undefeated teams in the tournament ===
The record here refers to the record before the first game of the NCAA tournament.
====Undefeated teams not in the tournament====
The NCAA tournament has dramatically expanded since 1975, and since the expansion to 48 teams in 1980, no unbeaten team has failed to qualify. Since by definition, a team would have to win its conference tournament, and thus secure an automatic bid to the tournament, to be undefeated in a season, the only way a team could finish undefeated and not reach the tournament is if the team is banned from postseason play. As of 2021, no team banned from postseason play has finished undefeated since 1980. Other possibilities for an undefeated team to fail to qualify: the team is independent; the conference does not have an automatic bid; or the team is transitioning from a lower NCAA division or the NAIA, during which time it is barred from NCAA-sponsored postseason play in the NCAA tournament or NIT. No men&#x27;s team from a transitional D-I member has been unbeaten after its conference tournament, but one such women&#x27;s team has been—California Baptist in 2021. (CBU was able to play in the women&#x27;s NIT, which has never been operated by the NCAA.)

Before 1980, there were occasions on which a team achieved perfection in the regular season, yet did not appear in the NCAA tournament.
* During 1939, Long Island University finished the regular season 20–0 but decided to accept instead an invitation to the second NIT (which they won) instead of the first and only NABC tournament (later called the NCAA tournament), as the NIT was more prestigious at the time. It was not until the mid-1950s that the NCAA required that its tournament would have &quot;first choice&quot; in determining teams for their field. Before then, many of the more successful teams during the regular season chose to play in the NIT instead of the NCAA tournament.
* During 1940, Seton Hall finished the regular season 19–0, but their record had been built largely against weak teams and thus did not earn them an invitation to the postseason tournament.
* During 1941, Milwaukee State finished the regular season 16–0, but their record had been built largely against weak teams and thus did not earn them an invitation to the postseason tournament.
* During 1944, Army finished the regular season 15–0 but owing to World War II, the Cadets did not accept an invitation to postseason play.
* During 1954, Kentucky finished 25–0 and were invited to the tournament, but declined the invitation, due their star players being ineligible due to already graduating.
* During 1973, NC State finished the regular season 27–0 and ranked #2 (behind undefeated and eventual tournament champion UCLA) but were barred from participating in the NCAA tournament while on probation for recruiting violations.
* During 1979, Alcorn State finished the regular season 27–0, but did not receive an invitation to the NCAA tournament. The Braves accepted a bid to the NIT, where they lost in the second round to eventual NIT champion Indiana.

=== Repeat champions ===
Eight programs have repeated as national championships. UCLA is the only program to win more than 2 in a row, winning 7 straight from 1967 to 1973. These programs are:
* Oklahoma State: 1945 and 1946
* Kentucky: 1948 and 1949
* San Francisco: 1955 and 1956
* Cincinnati: 1961 and 1962
* UCLA: 1964 and 1965; 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, and 1973
* Duke: 1991 and 1992
* Florida: 2006 and 2007
* UConn: 2023 and 2024

There have been nine times in which the tournament did not include the reigning champion (the previous year&#x27;s winner):
* 1978 champion Kentucky went 19–12 in 1979. They accepted an invitation to the National Invitation Tournament, losing to Clemson in the first round.
* Both 1979 champion Michigan State (12–15) and 1979 runner up Indiana State (16–11) failed to qualify for the 1980 NCAA Tournament. Furthermore, neither was invited to the National Invitation Tournament, and Michigan State is the only team to finish the subsequent season with a losing record. Following the 1979 NCAA Tournament, Indiana State lost Larry Bird to graduation, and Magic Johnson left Michigan State after his sophomore season to enter the NBA draft.
* 1983 champion North Carolina State went 19–14 in 1984. They accepted an invitation to the National Invitation Tournament, losing to Florida State in the first round.
* 1986 champion Louisville went 18–14 in 1987. They declined an invitation to the National Invitation Tournament.
* 1988 champion Kansas went 19–12 in 1989. The team was ineligible for postseason participation in 1989 due to NCAA sanctions for recruiting violations.
* Both 2007 champion Florida (24–12) and 2007 runner-up Ohio State (24–13) failed to qualify for the 2008 NCAA Tournament. Both accepted invitations to the National Invitation Tournament. Florida lost to Massachusetts in the semifinals, and Ohio State subsequently beat Massachusetts in the championship game to win the tournament.
* 2009 champion North Carolina went 20–17 in 2010. They accepted an invitation to the National Invitation Tournament and reached the finals, losing to Dayton.
* 2012 champion Kentucky went 21–12 in 2013. They accepted an invitation to the National Invitation Tournament, losing to Robert Morris in the first round.
* 2014 champion UConn went 20–15 in 2015. They accepted an invitation to the National Invitation Tournament, losing to Arizona State in the first round.

=== Upsets by low-seeded teams ===
===Mid-major teams===
Mid-major teams—which are defined as teams from the America East Conference (America East), ASUN Conference (ASUN), Atlantic 10 (A-10), Big Sky Conference (Big Sky), Big South Conference (Big South), Big West Conference (Big West), Coastal Athletic Association (CAA), Conference USA (C-USA), Horizon League (Horizon), Ivy League (Ivy), Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC), Mid-American Conference (MAC), Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC), Missouri Valley Conference (MVC), Mountain West Conference (MW), Northeast Conference (NEC), Ohio Valley Conference (OVC), Patriot League (Patriot), Southern Conference (SoCon), Southland Conference (Southland), Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC), Summit League (Summit), Sun Belt Conference (Sun Belt), West Coast Conference (WCC), and the Western Athletic Conference (WAC)—have experienced success in the tournament.

The last time, as of 2025, a mid-major team won the National Championship was 1990 when UNLV won with a 103–73 win over Duke, since UNLV was then a member of the Big West and since 1999 has been a member of the MW; the Big West was not then considered a power conference, nor is the MW today. However, during the tenure of UNLV&#x27;s coach at the time, Jerry Tarkanian, the Runnin&#x27; Rebels were widely viewed as a major program despite their conference affiliation (a situation similar to that of Gonzaga since the first years of the 21st century). Additionally, the Big West received three bids in the 1990 tournament. The last time, as of 2025, an independent mid-major team won the national championship was 1977 when Marquette won 67–59 over North Carolina. However, Marquette was not considered a &quot;mid-major&quot; program at that time. The very term &quot;mid-major&quot; was not coined until 1977 and did not see wide use until the 1990s. More significantly, Marquette was one of several traditional basketball powers that were still NCAA Division I independents in the late 1970s. Also, Marquette has been a member of widely acknowledged &quot;major&quot; basketball conferences since 1991, and is currently in the undeniably major Big East Conference. The last time, as of 2025, a mid-major team from a small media market (defined as a market that is outside of the top 25 television markets in the United States in 2025) won the National Championship was arguably 1962 when Cincinnati, then in the MVC, won 71–59 over Ohio State of the Big Ten, since Cincinnati&#x27;s TV market is listed 35th in the nation as of 2025. However, the MVC was generally seen in that day as a major basketball conference.

The last time the Final Four was composed, as of 2025, of at least 75% mid-major teams (3/4), i.e. excluding all present-day major conferences or their predecessors, was 1979, where Indiana State, then as now of the Missouri Valley Conference (which had lost several of its most prominent programs, among them Cincinnati, earlier in the decade); Penn, then as now in the Ivy League; and DePaul, then an independent, participated in the Final Four, only to see Indiana State lose to Michigan State. The last time, as of 2025, the Final Four has been composed of at least 50% mid-major teams (2/4) was 2023, when Florida Atlantic, of Conference USA, and San Diego State, of the Mountain West Conference, participated in the Final Four, only to see San Diego State lose to UConn. To date, as of 2025, no Final Four has been composed of 100% mid-major teams (4/4), therefore guaranteeing a mid-major team winning the national championship.

Arguably the tournament with the most mid-major success was the 1970 tournament, which had 63% representation of mid-major teams in the Sweet 16 (10/16), 75% representation in the Elite 8 (6/8), 75% representation in the Final 4 (3/4), and 50% representation in the national championship game (1/2). Jacksonville lost to UCLA in the National Championship, with New Mexico State defeating St. Bonaventure for third place.

This table shows the performance of mid-major teams from the Sweet Sixteen round to the national championship game from 1939—the tournament&#x27;s first year—to 2025.

;Notes
* The first column is a list of every mid-major conference. For the conferences that have predecessor names, a footnote (below the table) lists those names and years. Opposite each conference&#x27;s name are the schools that have appeared in the tournament from the Sweet Sixteen onwards when the school was a member of the conference or a predecessor conference.
* Some of the conferences that are considered mid-majors were regarded as major conferences in the past. For example:
** The Missouri Valley Conference was considered a major basketball conference until many of its most prominent members left in the mid-1970s (before Indiana State&#x27;s 1979 run to the title game).
** Conference USA was considered a major conference at its formation in 1995. It arguably became a mid-major in 2005, when several of its more prominent teams left for the Big East Conference, and unquestionably became a mid-major during the early-2010s realignment cycle.
** The WAC was considered a major conference until 1999, when 8 of its 16 members left to form the Mountain West Conference.
** The MW was considered a major basketball conference until 2011, when two of its most prominent basketball programs (BYU and Utah) left for other conferences (West Coast Conference and Pac-12, respectively).
* Certain programs that were members of &quot;mid-major&quot; conferences during deep tournament runs are nonetheless widely viewed as having been major programs at that time. The same applies to many programs that were independent before the 1980s. Examples include (but are not limited to) San Francisco in the 1950s, Marquette in the 1970s, UNLV in the last part of the 20th century, and Gonzaga since the mid-2010s.


==== Defunct conferences and independents ====
This table shows teams that saw success in the tournament from later defunct conferences, or were independents.

One conference listed, the Southwest Conference, was universally considered a major conference throughout its history. Of its final eight members, five moved to conferences typically considered &quot;major&quot; in basketball—three in the Big 12, one in the SEC, and one in The American. Another member that left during the SWC&#x27;s last decade also moved to the SEC. The Metro Conference, which operated from 1975 to 1995, is not listed because it was considered a major basketball conference throughout its history. The, Louisville, which was a member for the league&#x27;s entire existence, won both of its NCAA-recognized titles (1980, 1986) while in the Metro. It was one of the two leagues that merged to form the Conference USA. The other league involved in the merger, the Great Midwest Conference, was arguably a major conference; it was formed in 1990, with play starting in 1991, when several of the Metro&#x27;s strongest basketball programs left that league.

====Regional finals results====
==Host cities==
=== Final Four venues ===
Until 1952, the national championship was played at a separate site from the national semifinal games, which were considered regional finals. Forty-one different venues have hosted the final rounds, and several have hosted more than five times:
* Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City hosted nine times between 1940 and 1960
* Madison Square Garden in New York hosted seven times between 1943 and 1950
* Freedom Hall in Louisville hosted six times between 1958 and 1969
* Caesars Superdome in New Orleans hosted six times between 1982 and 2022

Among cities, Kansas City has hosted the Final Four a total of ten times, with Kemper Arena hosting in 1988 in addition to Municipal Auditorium. New York and Indianapolis have both hosted seven times, with the latter doing so at three venues: Market Square Arena in 1980, four times in the RCA Dome between 1991 and 2006, and three times in Lucas Oil Stadium, between 2010 and 2021. The state of Texas has hosted the Final Four eleven times in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and Arlington between 1971 and 2023.

For most of the tournament&#x27;s history, the national championship game and national semifinal games have been played in basketball arenas. The first instance of a domed stadium being used for the Final Four was the Houston Astrodome in 1971, but the Final Four would not return to a dome until 1982 when the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans hosted the event for the first time. The last on-campus venue to host the Final Four was University Arena in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1983. The last venue primarily built for a college basketball team to host the Final Four was Rupp Arena in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1985. The last NBA arena to host the Final Four was the Meadowlands Arena, then known as Continental Airlines Arena, in 1996. From 1997 to 2013, the NCAA required that the Final Four be played in domed stadiums with a minimum capacity of 40,000. the minimum was increased to 70,000, by adding additional seating on the floor of the dome, and raising the court on a platform three feet above the dome&#x27;s floor.

In September 2012, the NCAA began preliminary discussions on the possibility of returning occasional Final Fours to basketball-specific arenas in major metropolitan areas. According to &quot;ESPN.com&quot; writer Andy Katz, when Mark Lewis was hired as NCAA executive vice president for championships during 2012, &quot;he took out a United States map and saw that both coasts are largely left off from hosting the Final Four.&quot; Lewis added in an interview with Katz,

I don&#x27;t know where this will lead, if anywhere, but the right thing is to sit down and have these conversations and see if we want our championship in more than eight cities or do we like playing exclusively in domes. None of the cities where we play our championship is named New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago or Miami. We don&#x27;t play on a campus. We play in professional football arenas.
Under then-current criteria, only eleven stadiums could be considered as Final Four locations. On June 12, 2013, Katz reported that the NCAA had changed its policy. In July 2013, the NCAA had a portal available on its website for venues to make Final Four proposals in the 2017–2020 period, and there were no restrictions on proposals based on venue size. Also, the NCAA decided that future regionals will no longer be held in domes. In Katz&#x27; report, Lewis indicated that the use of domes for regionals was intended as a dry run for future Final Four venues, but this particular policy was no longer necessary because all of the Final Four sites from 2014 to 2016 had already hosted regionals. The policy was changed to only be used if a new venue would be hosting the subsequent tournament&#x27;s Final Four. Under the current policy, the 2030 regionals could be held at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, which opened in 2017 that will be hosting its first Final Four in 2031.

=== Home court advantage ===
On several occasions NCAA tournament teams played their games in their home arena. In 1959, Louisville played at its regular home of Freedom Hall; however, the Cardinals lost to West Virginia in the semifinals. In 1984, Kentucky defeated Illinois, 54–51 in the Elite Eight on its home court of Rupp Arena. Also in 1984, #6 seeded Memphis played the first 2 rounds on its home court, defeating Oral Roberts and Purdue. In 1985, Dayton played its first-round game against Villanova (it lost 51–49) on its home floor. In 1986 (beating Brown before losing to Navy) and &#x27;87 (beating Georgia Southern and Western Kentucky), Syracuse played the first 2 rounds of the NCAA tournament in the Carrier Dome. Also in 1986, LSU played in Baton Rouge on its home floor for the first 2 rounds despite being an 11th seed (beating Purdue and Memphis State). In 1987, Arizona lost to UTEP on its home floor in the first round. In 2015, Dayton played at its regular home of UD Arena, and the Flyers beat Boise State in the First Four.

Since the inception of the modern Final Four in 1952, only once has a team played a Final Four on its actual home court—Louisville in 1959. But through the 2015 tournament, three other teams have played the Final Four in their &quot;home cities&quot;, one other team has played in its &quot;metropolitan area&quot;, and six additional teams have played the Final Four in their &quot;home states&quot; through the 2015 tournament. Kentucky (1958 in Louisville), UCLA (1968 and 1972 in Los Angeles, 1975 in San Diego), and North Carolina State (1974 in Greensboro) won the national title; Louisville (1959 at its home arena, Freedom Hall); Purdue (1980 in Indianapolis) lost in the Final Four; and California (1960 in the San Francisco Bay Area), Duke (1994 in Charlotte), Michigan State (2009 in Detroit), and Butler (2010 in Indianapolis) lost in the final.

In 1960, Cal had nearly as large an edge as Louisville had the previous year, only having to cross the San Francisco Bay to play in the Final Four at the Cow Palace in Daly City; the Golden Bears lost in the championship game to Ohio State. UCLA had a similar advantage in 1968 and 1972 when it advanced to the Final Four at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, not many miles from the Bruins&#x27; homecourt of Pauley Pavilion (also UCLA&#x27;s home arena before the latter venue opened in 1965, and again during the 2011–12 season while Pauley was closed for renovations); unlike Louisville and Cal, the Bruins won the national title on both occasions. Butler lost the 2010 title from its Indianapolis campus.

Before the Final Four was established, the east and west regionals were held at separate sites, with the winners advancing to the title game. During that era, three New York City teams, all from Manhattan, played in the east regional at Madison Square Garden—frequently used as a &quot;big-game&quot; venue by each team—and advanced at least to the national semifinals. NYU won the east regional in 1945 but lost in the title game, also held at the Garden, to Oklahoma A&amp;M. CCNY played in the east regional in both 1947 and 1950; the Beavers lost in the 1947 east final to eventual champion Holy Cross but won the 1950 east regional and national titles at the Garden.

In 1974, North Carolina State won the NCAA tournament without leaving its home state of North Carolina. The team was put in the east region, and played its regional games at its home arena Reynolds Coliseum. NC State played the Final Four and national championship games at nearby Greensboro Coliseum.

While not its home state, Kansas has played in the championship game in Kansas City, Missouri, only 45 minutes from the campus in Lawrence, Kansas, on four different occasions. In 1940, 1953, and 1957 the Jayhawks lost the championship game each time at Municipal Auditorium. In 1988, playing at Kansas City&#x27;s Kemper Arena, Kansas won the championship, over Big Eight–rival Oklahoma. Similarly, in 2005, Illinois played in St. Louis, Missouri, where it enjoyed a noticeable home court advantage, yet still lost in the championship game to North Carolina.

In 2002, Texas was paired with Mississippi State in Dallas despite being the lower seed. The #6 seeded Longhorns defeated the #3 seeded Bulldogs 68–64 in front of a predominately Texas crowd.

=== Previously banned venues ===

====South Carolina====
The NCAA had banned the Bon Secours Wellness Arena, originally known as Bi-Lo Center, and Colonial Life Arena, originally Colonial Center, in South Carolina from hosting tournament games, despite their sizes (16,000 and 18,000 seats, respectively) because of an NAACP protest at the Bi-Lo Center during the 2002 first and second round tournament games over that state&#x27;s refusal to completely remove the Confederate Battle Flag from the state capitol grounds, although it had already been relocated from atop the capitol dome to a less prominent place in 2000. Following requests by the NAACP and Black Coaches Association, the Bi-Lo Center, and the newly built Colonial Center, which was built for purposes of hosting the tournament, were banned from hosting any future tournament events. As a result of the removal of the battle flag from the South Carolina State Capitol, the NCAA lifted its ban on South Carolina hosting games in 2015, and it was able to host in 2017 due to North Carolina House Bill 2 (see next section).

====North Carolina====
On September 12, 2016, the NCAA stripped the state of North Carolina of hosting rights for seven upcoming college sports tournaments and championships held by the association, including early round games of the 2017 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament scheduled for the Greensboro Coliseum. The NCAA argued that House Bill 2 made it &quot;challenging to guarantee that host communities can help deliver [an inclusive atmosphere]&quot;. Bon Secours Wellness Arena was able to secure the bid to be the replacement site.

==75th Anniversary==
Ahead of the 75th anniversary of the tournament, on December 11, 2012, the NCAA announced the 75 best players, the 25 best teams, and the 35 best moments in tournament history. The NCAA started with a group of more than 100 nominees and then analyzed the tournament statistics for each player to select the 75 finalists from which the public would select the top 15 via an online poll in January 2013.

The results of the public vote were revealed at the 2013 NCAA Final Four. Among the 15 players, ten had won a championship, 11 were declared the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament at least once, and all made the Final Four at least once. Abdul-Jabbar, Laettner, Lucas, Olajuwon, and Walton all reached the Final Four in every season they played college basketball, and an additional five players went to multiple Final Fours. Hill, Laettner, Russell, and Walton all won two championships, and Abdul-Jabbar won three championships. Lucas and Walton repeated as Most Outstanding Players, and Abdul-Jabbar was declared the MOP all three seasons he played. Bradley, Lucas, Olajuwon, and West were all declared MOP without winning the championship. Twelve players competed in the tournament every year they played college basketball.

UCLA and Duke are the only team with multiple honorees. Christian Laettner and Grant Hill are the only teammates, they played together for Duke and won two championships in 1991 and 1992. Larry Bird and Magic Johnson competed against each other in the 1979 NCAA Championship Game, and Patrick Ewing and Michael Jordan competed against each other in the 1982 NCAA Championship Game as freshmen. Oscar Robertson and Jerry West competed during the same seasons, but never met in the tournament.

Eleven of the players have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and the College Basketball Hall of Fame as players. Michael Jordan and Olajuwon have only been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial as players, and Christian Laettner and Danny Manning have only been inducted into the CBHOF as players. Bill Russell has also been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial as a coach.

Patrick Ewing (Georgetown) and Danny Manning (Tulsa and Wake Forest) have appeared in the tournament as head coaches. Manning has also recorded six appearances, two Final Fours, one runner-up, and one championship as an assistant for Kansas.

==Popular culture==
The NCAA tournament and the Super Bowl are the two American sports events that draw both fans and non-fans. Many people are connected to a school in the tournament, having been an alumnus of one of the participants, knowing someone from the college, or living close to the school.

===Bracketology and pools===
There are pools or private gambling-related contests in which participants predict the outcome of each tournament game, filling out a complete tournament bracket in the process. The popularity of this practice grew around 1985, when the tournament expanded to 64 games, forming four symmetrical regions with 15 games apiece to decide the Final Four. In 2023, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; reported that an estimated 60 to 100 million brackets are filled out each year. Filling out a tournament bracket with predictions is called the practice of &quot;bracketology;&quot; sports programming during the tournament often features commentators comparing the accuracy of their predictions. On The Dan Patrick Show, a wide variety of celebrities from various fields (such as Darius Rucker, Charlie Sheen, Neil Patrick Harris, Ellen DeGeneres, Dave Grohl, and Brooklyn Decker) have posted full brackets with predictions. Former U.S. president Barack Obama began releasing his bracket annually in 2009, his first year in office. While in office, he filled out the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s brackets on ESPN with reporter Andy Katz, and they were also posted on the White House website. He continued releasing his picks after leaving office.

There are many tournament prediction scoring systems. Most award points for correctly picking the winning team in a particular match up, with increasingly more points being given for correctly predicting later round winners. Some provide bonus points for correctly predicting upsets, the amount of the bonus varying based on the degree of upset. Some just provide points for wins by correctly picked teams in the brackets.

There are 2^63 or about 9.22 quintillion unique combinations of winners in a 64-team NCAA bracket, meaning that without considering seed number, the odds of picking a perfect bracket are about 9.22 quintillion to 1. Including the First Four, the number of unique combinations increases to 2^67 or about 147.57 quintillion.

There are numerous awards and prizes given by companies for anyone who can make the perfect bracket. One of the largest was done by a partnership between Quicken Loans and Berkshire Hathaway, which was backed by Warren Buffett, with a $1 billion prize to any person(s) who could correctly predict the outcome of the 2014 tournament. No one was able to complete the challenge and win the $1 billion prize.

===Workplace productivity===
During the tournament, American workers take extended lunch breaks at sports bars to follow the game. They also use company computer and internet access to view games, scores, and bracket results. Some workplaces block access to sports and entertainment sites, but the rise of mobile devices and live-streamed games bypassed those restrictions, and even workers not normally in front of computers then had access. Workers spend an estimated average of six hours on the tournament each year. , U.S. employers were projected to lose around $13 billion due to lost productivity during the tournament.

===Tournament-associated terms===
As indicated below, none of these phrases are &quot;exclusively&quot; used in regard to the NCAA tournament. Nonetheless, they are associated widely with the tournament, sometimes for legal reasons, sometimes as part of the American sports vernacular.

====March Madness====
&quot;March Madness&quot; is a popular term for season-ending basketball tournaments played in March. It is also a registered trademark currently owned exclusively by the NCAA.

H. V. Porter, an official with the Illinois High School Association (and later a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame), was the first person to use &quot;March Madness&quot; to describe a basketball tournament. Porter published an essay named &quot;March Madness&quot; during 1939, and during 1942, he used the phrase in a poem, &quot;Basketball Ides of March&quot;. Through the years the use of &quot;March Madness&quot; increased, especially in Illinois, Indiana, and other parts of the Midwest. During this period, the term was used almost exclusively in reference to state high school tournaments. During 1977, Jim Enright published a book about the Illinois tournament entitled &quot;March Madness&quot;.

Fans began associating the term with the NCAA tournament during the early 1980s. Evidence suggests that CBS sportscaster Brent Musburger, who had worked for many years in Chicago before joining CBS, popularized the term during the annual tournament broadcasts. The NCAA has credited Bob Walsh of the Seattle Organizing Committee for starting the March Madness celebration in 1984.

Only during the 1990s did either the IHSA or the NCAA think about trademarking the term, and by that time a small television production company named Intersport had already trademarked it. IHSA eventually bought the trademark rights from Intersport, and then went to court to establish its primacy. IHSA sued GTE Vantage, an NCAA licensee that used &quot;March Madness&quot; for a computer game based on the college tournament. During 1996, in a historic ruling, &quot;Illinois High School Association v. GTE Vantage, Inc.&quot;, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit created the concept of a &quot;dual-use trademark&quot;, granting both the IHSA and NCAA the right to trademark the term for their own purposes.

After the ruling, the NCAA and IHSA joined forces and created the March Madness Athletic Association to coordinate the licensing of the trademark and investigate possible trademark infringement. One such case involved a company that had obtained the internet domain name &quot;marchmadness.com&quot; and was using it to post information about the NCAA tournament. During 2003, by &quot;March Madness Athletic Association v. Netfire, Inc.&quot;, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit decided that &quot;March Madness&quot; was not a generic term, and ordered Netfire to relinquish the domain name to the NCAA.

Later during the 2000s, the IHSA relinquished its ownership share in the trademark, although it retained the right to use the term in association with high school championships. During October 2010, the NCAA reached a settlement with Intersport, paying $17.2 million for the latter company&#x27;s license to use the trademark.

====Sweet Sixteen====
This is a popular term for the regional semifinal round of the tournament, consisting of the final 16 teams. As in the case of &quot;March Madness&quot;, this was first used by a high school federation—in this case, the Kentucky High School Athletic Association (KHSAA), which has used the term for decades to describe its own season-ending tournaments. It officially registered the trademark in 1988. Unlike the situation with &quot;March Madness&quot;, the KHSAA has retained sole ownership of the &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; trademark; it licenses the term to the NCAA for use in collegiate tournaments.

====Elite Eight====
The &quot;Elite Eight&quot; is a popular term to describe the two teams in each of the four regional championship games. The NCAA officially uses the term for the eight-team final phase of the Division II men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball tournaments. The winners of these games in the D-I tournament advance to the Final Four (the NCAA does not use the term &quot;Final Four&quot; in D-II). The NCAA trademarked this phrase in 1997. Like &quot;March Madness&quot;, the phrase &quot;Elite Eight&quot; originally referred to the Illinois High School Boys Basketball Championship, the single-elimination high school basketball tournament run by the Illinois High School Association. In 1956, when the IHSA finals were reduced from sixteen to eight teams, a new nickname for Sweet Sixteen was needed, and &quot;Elite Eight&quot; won the vote. The IHSA trademarked the term in 1995; the trademark rights are now held by the March Madness Athletic Association, a joint venture between the NCAA and IHSA formed after a 1996 court case allowed both organizations to use &quot;March Madness&quot; for their own tournaments.

====Final Four====
The term Final Four refers to the last four teams remaining in the playoff tournament. These are the champions of the tournament&#x27;s four regional brackets, and are the only teams remaining on the tournament&#x27;s final weekend. (While the term &quot;Final Four&quot; was not used during the early decades of the tournament, the term has been applied retroactively to include the last four teams in tournaments from earlier years, even when only two brackets existed.)

Some claim that &quot;Final Four&quot; was first used to describe the final games of Indiana&#x27;s annual high school basketball tournament. But the NCAA, which has a trademark on the term, says &quot;Final Four&quot; was originated by a &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; sportswriter, Ed Chay, in a 1975 article that appeared in the Official Collegiate Basketball Guide. The article stated that Marquette University &quot;was one of the final four&quot; of the 1974 tournament. The NCAA started capitalizing the term during 1978 and converting it to a trademark several years later.

During recent years, &quot;Final Four&quot; has been used for other sports besides basketball. Tournaments which use the
term include the EuroLeague in basketball, national basketball competitions in several European countries, and the now-defunct European Hockey League. Together with the name &quot;Final Four&quot;, these tournaments have adopted an NCAA-style format in which the four surviving teams compete in a single-elimination tournament held in one place, typically, during one weekend. The derivative term &quot;Frozen Four&quot; is used by the NCAA to refer to the final rounds of the Division I men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey tournaments. Until 1999, it was just a popular nickname for the last two rounds of the hockey tournament; officially, it was also known as the &quot;Final Four&quot;.

====Cinderella teams and Underdog teams====
A Cinderella team, both in NCAA basketball and other sports, is one that achieves far greater success than would reasonably have been best expected. In the NCAA tournament, teams may earn the &quot;Cinderella&quot; title after multiple wins in a single tournament against higher seeded teams. The term first came into widespread usage in 1950, when the City College of New York unexpectedly won the tournament in the same month that a film adaptation of &quot;Cinderella&quot; was released in the United States.

Notable Cinderella teams include North Carolina State in 1983 (the subject of a &quot;30 for 30&quot; documentary titled &quot;Survive and Advance&quot;), Villanova in 1985 (the lowest-seeded team to ever win the tournament), LSU in 1986 (the only team to defeat the top three seeds in their region in the same tournament), UMBC in 2018 (the first No. 16 seed to defeat a No. 1 seed), Saint Peter&#x27;s in 2022 (the first No. 15 seed to advance to the Elite Eight), and Fairleigh Dickinson (the second 16 seed to defeat a 1 seed) and Florida Atlantic (a 9 seed which had never won an NCAA tournament game before its Final Four run) in 2023.
