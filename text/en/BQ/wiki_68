<text>A binary option is a financial exotic option in which the payoff is either some fixed monetary amount or nothing at all. The two main types of binary options are the cash-or-nothing binary option and the asset-or-nothing binary option. The former pays some fixed amount of cash if the option expires in-the-money while the latter pays the value of the underlying security. They are also called all-or-nothing options, digital options (more common in forex/interest rate markets), and fixed return options (FROs) (on the NYSE American).

While binary options may be used in theoretical asset pricing, they are prone to fraud in their applications and hence banned by regulators in many jurisdictions as a form of gambling. Many binary option outlets have been exposed as fraudulent. The U.S. FBI is investigating binary option scams throughout the world, and the Israeli police have tied the industry to criminal syndicates. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has banned retail binary options trading. Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) considers binary options as a &quot;high-risk&quot; and &quot;unpredictable&quot; investment option, and finally also banned binary options sale to retail investors in 2021.

The FBI estimates that the scammers steal US$10 billion annually worldwide. The use of the names of famous and respectable people such as Richard Branson to encourage people to buy fake &quot;investments&quot; is frequent and increasing. Articles published in &quot;The Times of Israel&quot; newspaper explain the fraud in detail, using the experience of former insiders such as a job-seeker recruited by a fake binary options broker, who was told to &quot;leave [his] conscience at the door&quot;. Following an investigation by &quot;The Times of Israel&quot;, Israel&#x27;s cabinet approved a ban on the sale of binary options in June 2017, and a law banning the products was approved by the Knesset in October 2017.

On January 30, 2018, Facebook banned advertisements for binary options trading as well as for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs). Google and Twitter announced similar bans in the following weeks.

==Function==

Binary options &quot;are based on a simple &#x27;yes&#x27; or &#x27;no&#x27; proposition: Will an underlying asset be above a certain price at a certain time?&quot; Traders place wagers as to whether that will or will not happen. If a customer believes the price of an underlying asset will be above a certain price at a set time, the trader buys the binary option, but if he or she believes it will be below that price, they sell the option. In the U.S. exchanges, the price of a binary is always under $100.

Investopedia described the binary options trading process in the U.S. thus:

[A] binary may be trading at $42.50 (bid) and $44.50 (offer) at 1 p.m. If you buy the binary option right then you will pay $44.50, if you decide to sell right then you&#x27;ll sell at $42.50.

Let&#x27;s assume you decide to buy at $44.50. If at 1:30 p.m. the price of gold is above $1,250, your option expires and it becomes worth $100. You make a profit of $100 – $44.50 = $55.50 (less fees). This is called being &quot;in the money&quot;. 

But if the price of gold is below $1,250 at 1:30 p.m., the option expires at $0. Therefore you lose the $44.50 invested. This is called being &quot;out of the money&quot;. 

The bid and offer fluctuate until the option expires. You can close your position at any time before expiry to lock in a profit or a reduce a loss (compared to letting it expire out of the money).

In the U.S., every binary option settles at $100 or $0, $100 if the bet is correct, 0 if it is not.

In the online binary options industry, where the contracts are sold by a broker to a customer in an OTC manner, a different option pricing model is used. Brokers sell binary options at a fixed price (e.g., $100) and offer some fixed percentage return in case of in-the-money settlement. Some brokers, also offer a sort of out-of-money reward to a losing customer. For example, with a win reward of 80%, out-of-money reward of 5%, and the option price of $100, two scenarios are possible. In-the-money settlement pays back the option price of $100 and the reward of $80. In case of loss, the option price is not returned but the out-of-money reward of $5 is granted to the customer.

On non-regulated platforms, client money is not necessarily kept in a trust account, as required by government financial regulation, and transactions are not monitored by third parties in order to ensure fair play.

Binary options are often considered a form of gambling rather than investment because of their negative cumulative payout (the brokers have an edge over the investor) and because they are advertised as requiring little or no knowledge of the markets. Gordon Pape, writing in Forbes.com in 2010, called binary options websites &quot;gambling sites, pure and simple&quot;, and said &quot;this sort of thing can quickly become addictive... no one, no matter how knowledgeable, can consistently predict what a stock or commodity will do within a short time frame&quot;.

Pape observed that binary options are poor from a gambling standpoint as well because of the excessive &quot;house edge&quot;. One online binary options site paid $71 for each successful $100 trade. &quot;If you lose, you get back $15. Let&#x27;s say you make 1,000 &quot;trades&quot; and win 545 of them. Your profit is $38,695. But your 455 losses will cost you $38,675. In other words, you must win 54.5% of the time just to break even&quot;.

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission warns that &quot;some binary options Internet-based trading platforms may overstate the average return on investment by advertising a higher average return on investment than a customer should expect given the payout structure.&quot;

==Black–Scholes valuation==
In the Black–Scholes model, the price of the option can be found by the formulas below. In fact, the Black–Scholes formula for the price of a vanilla call option (or put option) can be interpreted by decomposing a call option into an asset-or-nothing call option minus a cash-or-nothing call option, and similarly for a put – the binary options are easier to analyze, and correspond to the two terms in the Black–Scholes formula.

In these, &quot;S&quot; is the initial stock price, &quot;K&quot; denotes the strike price, &quot;T&quot; is the time to maturity, &quot;q&quot; is the dividend rate, &quot;r&quot; is the risk-free interest rate and formula_1 is the volatility. formula_2 denotes the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution,
:formula_3
and,
:formula_4
: formula_5

===Cash-or-nothing call===
This pays out one unit of cash if the spot is above the strike at maturity. Its value now is given by
:formula_6

===Cash-or-nothing put===
This pays out one unit of cash if the spot is below the strike at maturity. Its value now is given by
:formula_7

===Asset-or-nothing call===
This pays out one unit of asset if the spot is above the strike at maturity. Its value now is given by
:formula_8

===Asset-or-nothing put===
This pays out one unit of asset if the spot is below the strike at maturity. Its value now is given by:
:formula_9

===American style===
An American option gives the holder the right to exercise at any point up to and including the expiry time formula_10. That is, denoting by formula_11 the strike price, if formula_12 (resp. formula_13), the corresponding American binary put (resp. call) is worth exactly one unit. Let
:formula_14
The price of a cash-or-nothing American binary put (resp. call) with strike formula_15) and time-to-expiry formula_10 is:
:formula_17
where formula_18 denotes the error function and formula_19 denotes the sign function. The above follows immediately from expressions for the Laplace transform of the distribution of the conditional first passage time of Brownian motion to a particular level.

===Foreign exchange===
If we denote by &quot;S&quot; the FOR/DOM exchange rate (i.e., 1 unit of foreign currency is worth S units of domestic currency) we can observe that paying out 1 unit of the domestic currency if the spot at maturity is above or below the strike is exactly like a cash-or nothing call and put respectively. Similarly, paying out 1 unit of the foreign currency if the spot at maturity is above or below the strike is exactly like an asset-or nothing call and put respectively.
Hence if we now take formula_20, the foreign interest rate, formula_21, the domestic interest rate, and the rest as above, we get the following results.

In case of a digital call (this is a call FOR/put DOM) paying out one unit of the domestic currency we get as present value,
:formula_22
In case of a digital put (this is a put FOR/call DOM) paying out one unit of the domestic currency we get as present value,
:formula_23
While in case of a digital call (this is a call FOR/put DOM) paying out one unit of the foreign currency we get as present value,
:formula_24
and in case of a digital put (this is a put FOR/call DOM) paying out one unit of the foreign currency we get as present value,
:formula_25

===Skew===
In the standard Black–Scholes model, one can interpret the premium of the binary option in the risk-neutral world as the expected value = probability of being in-the-money * unit, discounted to the present value. The Black–Scholes model relies on symmetry of distribution and ignores the skewness of the distribution of the asset. Market makers adjust for such skewness by, instead of using a single standard deviation for the underlying asset formula_26 across all strikes, incorporating a variable one formula_27 where volatility depends on strike price, thus incorporating the volatility skew into account. The skew matters because it affects the binary considerably more than the regular options.

A binary call option is, at long expirations, similar to a tight call spread using two vanilla options. One can model the value of a binary cash-or-nothing option, &quot;C&quot;, at strike &quot;K&quot;, as an infinitesimally tight spread, where formula_28 is a vanilla European call:
:formula_29
Thus, the value of a binary call is the negative of the derivative of the price of a vanilla call with respect to strike price:
:formula_30

When one takes volatility skew into account, formula_26 is a function of formula_11:
:formula_33

The first term is equal to the premium of the binary option ignoring skew:
:formula_34

formula_35 is the Vega of the vanilla call; formula_36 is sometimes called the &quot;skew slope&quot; or just &quot;skew&quot;. Skew is typically negative, so the value of a binary call is higher when taking skew into account.
:formula_37

===Relationship to vanilla options&#x27; Greeks===
Since a binary call is a mathematical derivative of a vanilla call with respect to strike, the price of a binary call has the same shape as the delta of a vanilla call, and the delta of a binary call has the same shape as the gamma of a vanilla call.

==Regulation and fraud==
Many binary option &quot;brokers&quot; have been exposed as fraudulent operations. In those cases, there is no real brokerage; the customer is betting against the broker, who is acting as a bucket shop. Manipulation of price data to cause customers to lose is common. Withdrawals are regularly stalled or refused by such operations; if a client has good reason to expect a payment, the operator will simply stop taking their phone calls. Though binary options sometimes trade on regulated exchange, they are generally unregulated, trading on the Internet, and prone to fraud. Most of the binary options brokers are registered in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and offering their services globally. The country&#x27;s Financial Services Authority has issued a warning to the general public about unlicensed Forex and binary options trading provided by entities registered in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

=== European Union ===
On 23 March 2018, The European Securities and Markets Authority, a European Union financial regulatory institution and European Supervisory Authority located in Paris, agreed to new temporary rules prohibiting the marketing, distribution or sale of binary options to retail clients.

=== Australia ===
The Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) warned Australian investors on 13 February 2015 against Opteck, an unlicensed binary option provider. The ASIC later began a focused effort to control unlicensed derivative providers, including &quot;review&quot; websites, broker affiliates, and managed service providers related to binary option products. ASIC finally released a ban on sale of binary options to retail clients in 2021.

=== Belgium ===
In August 2016, Belgium&#x27;s Financial Services and Markets Authority banned binary options schemes, based on concerns about widespread fraud.

=== Canada ===
No firms are registered in Canada to offer or sell binary options, so no binary options trading is currently allowed. Provincial regulators have proposed a complete ban on all binary options trading include a ban on online advertising for binary options trading sites. A complete ban on binary options trading for options having an expiration less than 30 days was announced on September 28, 2017.

=== Cyprus ===
On May 3, 2012, the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) announced a policy change regarding the classification of binary options as financial instruments. The effect is that binary options platforms operating in Cyprus, where many of the platforms are now based, would have to be CySEC regulated within six months of the date of the announcement. CySEC was the first EU MiFID-member regulator to treat binary options as financial instruments.

In 2013, CySEC prevailed over the disreputable binary options brokers and communicated intensively with traders in order to prevent the risks of using unregulated financial services. On September 19, 2013, CySEC sent out a press release warning investors against binary options broker TraderXP, who was not and had never been licensed by CySEC.
On October 18, 2013, CySEC released an investor warning about binary options broker NRGbinary and its parent company NRG Capital (CY) Ltd., stating that NRGbinary was not and had never been licensed by CySEC.

CySEC also temporarily suspended the license of the Cedar Finance on December 19, 2013, because the potential violations referenced appeared to seriously endanger the interests of the company&#x27;s customers and the proper functioning of capital markets, as described in the official issued press release. CySEC also issued a warning against binary option broker PlanetOption at the end of the year and another warning against binary option broker LBinary on January 10, 2014, pointing out that it was not regulated by the Commission and the Commission had not received any notification by any of its counterparts in other European countries to the effect of this firm being a regulated provider.

The Cyprus regulator imposed a penalty of €15,000 against ZoomTrader. OptionBravo and ChargeXP were also financially penalized. CySEC also indicated that it had voted to reject the ShortOption license application.

In 2015, CySEC repeatedly fined Banc De Binary for several violations including the solicitation of U.S. clients. In 2016, the regulator fined Banc De Binary Ltd once again for violation of its legislation. The broker has come to a settlement of €350,000.

=== France ===
In August 2016, France&#x27;s &quot;Sapin II&quot; bill on transparency was announced by the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), seeking to outlaw all financial derivatives advertising. The AMF stated that it would ban the advertising of certain highly speculative and risky financial contracts to private individuals by electronic means. The document applies specifically to binary options, and to contracts for difference (CFDs), and financial contracts on currencies. The French regulator is determined to cooperate with the legal authorities to have illegal websites blocked. The law also prohibits all forms of sponsorship and partnership that results in direct or indirect advertising of the financial products it covers. This ban was seen by industry watchers as having an impact on sponsored sports such as European football clubs.

The Cyprus-based company 24Option was banned from trading in France by AMF earlier in 2016. They had sponsored a well-known Irish mixed martial artist, Conor McGregor, who in turn promoted the company through social media.

=== Germany ===

German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) has been regularly publishing investor warnings. On November 29, 2018, BaFin announced that it is planning to &quot;prohibit the marketing, distribution and sale of binary options to retail clients at a national level&quot;.

=== Indonesia ===
According to the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (CoFTRA) in Indonesia, also known as BAPPEBTI, binary options are considered a form of online gambling and is illegal in the country. The move to delegalize binary options stems from concerns that the public may be swayed by misleading advertisements, promotions, and offers to participate in fraudulent practices that operate under the guise of binary options trading. As of 2 February 2022, at least 92 binary options websites, including Binomo, IQ Option, and Olymp Trade, have been classified as unlicensed operators and blocked by the Indonesian government.

=== Israel ===
;Binary options trading
In March 2016 binary options trading within Israel was banned by the Israel Securities Authority, on the grounds that such trading is essentially gambling and not a form of investment management. The ban was extended to overseas clients as well in October 2017. It was approved by the Knesset in October, despite strong opposition from the binary options industry.

;Fraud
In 2016 &quot;The Times of Israel&quot; ran several articles on binary options fraud. &quot;The wolves of Tel Aviv: Israel&#x27;s vast, amoral binary options scam exposed&quot; revealed that the industry is a scam. A second article describes in detail how a binary options salesman fleeced clients. &quot;According to one ex-employee of a firm that employs over 1,000 people in a high-rise office building in Tel Aviv, losses are guaranteed because the &#x27;dealing room&#x27; at the binary options firm controls the trading platform — like the crooked ownership of a rigged casino manipulating the roulette wheel&quot;.

In July 2016 the Israeli binary option firms Vault Options and Global Trader 365 were ordered by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois to pay more than $4.5 million for unlawful off-exchange binary options trading, fraud, and registration violations. The companies were also banned permanently from operating in the United States or selling to U.S. residents.

In November 2016 the Israel Securities Authority carried out a raid on the Ramat Gan offices of binary option broker iTrader. The CEO and six other employees were charged with fraud, providing unlicensed investment advice, and obstruction of justice.

On May 15, 2017, Eliran Saada, the owner of Express Target Marketing, which has operated the binary options companies InsideOption and SecuredOptions, was arrested on suspicion of fraud, false accounting, forgery, extortion, and blackmail. The case involves a Singaporean woman who claims to have lost over $500,000 to the firm.

In August 2017 Israeli police superintendent Rafi Biton said that the binary trading industry had &quot;turned into a monster&quot;. He told the Israeli Knesset that criminal investigations had begun.

In September 2017, the FBI arrested Lee Elbaz, CEO of binary options trading company Yukom Communications, upon her arrival in the United States. They arrested her for wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. In 2019, Lee Elbaz was found guilty and sentenced to 22 years in prison.

In February 2019, the FBI arrested Austin Smith, founder of Wealth Recovery International, after his arrival in the United States. Smith was arrested for wire fraud due to his involvement as an employee of Binarybook.com.

===Malta===
In March 2013 the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) announced that binary options regulation would be transferred away from Malta&#x27;s Lottery and Gaming Authority. On 18 June 2013 MFSA confirmed that in their view binary options fell under the scope of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), which made Malta the second EU jurisdiction to regulate binary options as a financial instrument. This required providers to obtain a category 3 Investment Services license and conform to MiFID&#x27;s minimum capital requirements; firms could previously operate from the jurisdiction with a valid Lottery and Gaming Authority license.

=== New Zealand ===
In April 2017, New Zealand&#x27;s Financial Markets Authority (FMA) announced that all brokers that offer short-term investment instruments that settle within three days are required to obtain a license from the agency. This is intended to cover binary options as well as contracts for difference (CFDs).

===United Kingdom===
;Binary options trading
In the UK, binary options were regulated by the Gambling Commission rather than the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This regulation, however, applied only to firms that have gambling equipment in the UK. The FCA in 2016 did propose bringing binary options under its jurisdiction and restricting them. They stated that binary options &quot;did not appear to meet a genuine investment need&quot;. In March 2017, Action Fraud issued a warning on binary options.

The Isle of Man, a self-governing Crown dependency for which the UK is responsible, has issued licenses to companies offering binary options as &quot;games of skill&quot; licensed and regulated under fixed odds betting by the Isle of Man Gambling Supervision Commission (GSC). This positions binary options as a form of gambling, and the administrator of the trading as something akin to a casino, as opposed to an exchange or brokerage house.

On October 19, 2017, London police raided 20 binary options firms in London. On January 3, 2018, the FCA took over regulation of binary options from the Gambling Commission. In December 2018, FCA has proposed new rules which would permanently ban the sale, marketing and distribution of binary options to retail consumers.

;Fraud
Fraud within the market is rife, with many binary options providers using the names of famous and respectable people without their knowledge. According to a national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre Action Fraud, 664 binary options frauds were reported in 2015/16, increasing to 1,474 in 2016/17. The City of London police in May 2017 said that reported losses for the previous financial year were £13 million, increased from £2 million the year before. In the first half of 2017, 697 people reported losses totaling over £18 million.

=== United States ===
;Binary options trading

In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved exchange-traded binary options in 2008. Trading commenced on the NYSE American (MYSEA) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) in May and June 2008.

The MYSEA offers binary options on some exchange-traded funds and a few highly liquid equities such as Citigroup and Google. On the exchange binary options were called &quot;fixed return options&quot; (FROs). To reduce the threat of market manipulation of single stocks, FROs use a &quot;settlement index&quot; defined as a volume-weighted average of trades on the expiration day. MYSEA and Donato A. Montanaro submitted a patent application for exchange-listed binary options using a volume-weighted settlement index in 2005. CBOE offers binary options on the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) and the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). The tickers for these are BSZ and BVZ, respectively.

NADEX, a U.S.-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulated exchange, launched binary options for a range of Forex, commodities, and stock indices&#x27; markets in June 2009. On March 30, 2010 the CFTC issued an amended Order of Designation to allow trades on NADEX to be intermediated. NADEX have since offered binary options trading between buyers and sellers. They do not participate in the trades.

;Fraud

On June 6, 2013, the U.S. CFTC and the SEC jointly issued an Investor Alert to warn about fraudulent promotional schemes involving binary options and binary options trading platforms. The two agencies said that they had received numerous complaints of fraud about binary options trading sites, &quot;including refusal to credit customer accounts or reimburse funds to customers; identity theft; and manipulation of software to generate losing trades&quot;. Other binary options operations were violating requirements to register with regulators.

In June 2013, U.S. regulators charged Israeli-Cypriot company Banc De Binary with illegally selling binary options to U.S. investors. In February 2016, the company reached an $11 million settlement with U.S. authorities. Regulators found the company used a &quot;virtual office&quot; in New York&#x27;s Trump Tower in pursuit of its scheme, evading a ban on off-exchange binary option contracts. The company neither admitted nor denied the allegations. In November 2016, SEC published yet another Investor Alert on binary options websites. In 2016,

In February 2017 &quot;The Times of Israel&quot; reported that the FBI was conducting an active international investigation of binary option fraud, emphasizing its international nature, saying that the agency was &quot;not limited to the USA&quot;. Victims from around the world were asked to contact an FBI field office or the FBI&#x27;s Internet Crime Complaint Center. The investigation is not limited to the binary options brokers, but is comprehensive and could include companies that provide services that allow the industry to operate. Credit card issuers will be informed of the fraudulent nature of much of the industry, which could possibly allow victims to receive a chargeback, or refund, of fraudulently obtained money.

On March 13, 2017, the FBI reiterated its warning, declaring that the &quot;perpetrators behind many of the binary options websites, primarily criminals located overseas, are only interested in one thing—taking your money&quot;. They also provide a checklist on how to avoid being victimized.

There is also a popular binary options recovery services scam, where fraudsters promise to &quot;hunt&quot; down the binary options scammers and retrieve the money from them through legal methods. In January 2018, Boston federal prosecutors filed a complaint against Leonel Alexis Valerio Santana and Frank Gregory Cedeno, accusing them of such type of fraud. In August 2018, Santana was sentenced to 63 months in prison, three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution of $105,869 (Cedeno was indicted in March and pleaded not guilty).

<doc id="502107" wikidata="Q306592" url="?curid=502107" title="Xargs">
<text>xargs (short for &quot;extended arguments&quot;) is a command on Unix and most Unix-like operating systems used to build and execute commands from standard input. It converts input from standard input into arguments to a command.

Some commands such as codice_1 and codice_2 can take input either as command-line arguments or from the standard input. However, others such as codice_3 and codice_4 can only take input as arguments, which is why xargs is necessary.

A port of an older version of GNU is available for Microsoft Windows as part of the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities. A ground-up rewrite named is part of the open-source TextTools project. The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.

==Examples==
One use case of the xargs command is to remove a list of files using the rm command. POSIX systems have an for the maximum total length of the command line, so the command may fail with an error message of &quot;Argument list too long&quot; (meaning that the exec system call&#x27;s limit on the length of a command line was exceeded): rm /path/* or rm $(find /path -type f). (The latter invocation is incorrect, as it may expand globs in the output.)

This can be rewritten using the codice_5 command to break the list of arguments into sublists small enough to be acceptable:
$ find /path -type f -print | xargs rm

In the above example, the codice_6 utility feeds the input of codice_5 with a long list of file names. codice_5 then splits this list into sublists and calls codice_9 once for every sublist.

Some implementations of xargs can also be used to parallelize operations with the codice_10 argument to specify how many parallel processes should be used to execute the commands over the input argument lists. However, the output streams may not be synchronized. This can be overcome by using an codice_11 argument where possible, and then combining the results after processing. The following example queues 24 processes and waits on each to finish before launching another.

$ find /path -name &#x27;*.foo&#x27; | xargs -P 24 -I &#x27;{}&#x27; /cpu/bound/process &#x27;{}&#x27; -o &#x27;{}&#x27;.out
xargs often covers the same functionality as the &quot;command substitution&quot; feature of many shells, denoted by the backquote notation (codice_12 or codice_13). xargs is also a good companion for commands that output long lists of files such as codice_14, codice_15 and codice_1, but only if one uses codice_17 (or equivalently codice_18), since codice_5 without codice_17 deals badly with file names containing codice_21, codice_22 and space. GNU Parallel is a similar tool that offers better compatibility with find, locate and grep when file names may contain codice_21, codice_22, and space (newline still requires codice_17).

==Placement of arguments==
=== option: single argument===
The xargs command offers options to insert the listed arguments at some position other than the end of the command line. The codice_26 option to xargs takes a string that will be replaced with the supplied input before the command is executed. A common choice is codice_27.

$ mkdir ~/backups
$ find /path -type f -name &#x27;*~&#x27; -print0 | xargs -0 -I % cp -a % ~/backups
The string to replace may appear multiple times in the command part. Using at all limits the number of lines used each time to one.

===Shell trick: any number===
Another way to achieve a similar effect is to use a shell as the launched command, and deal with the complexity in that shell, for example:

$ mkdir ~/backups
$ find /path -type f -name &#x27;*~&#x27; -print0 | xargs -0 sh -c &#x27;for filename; do cp -a &quot;$filename&quot; ~/backups; done&#x27; sh
The word at the end of the line is for the POSIX shell to fill in for , the &quot;executable name&quot; part of the positional parameters (argv). If it weren&#x27;t present, the name of the first matched file would be instead assigned to codice_28 and the file wouldn&#x27;t be copied to codice_29. One can also use any other word to fill in that blank, for example.

Since accepts multiple files at once, one can also simply do the following:

$ find /path -type f -name &#x27;*~&#x27; -print0 | xargs -0 sh -c &#x27;if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then cp -a &quot;$@&quot; ~/backup; fi&#x27; sh

This script runs with all the files given to it when there are any arguments passed. Doing so is more efficient since only one invocation of is done for each invocation of .

==Separator problem==
Many Unix utilities are line-oriented. These may work with codice_5 as long as the lines do not contain codice_21, codice_22, or a space. Some of the Unix utilities can use NUL as record separator (e.g. Perl (requires codice_17 and codice_34 instead of codice_35), codice_36 (requires using codice_17), codice_14 (requires using codice_39), codice_1 (requires codice_41 or codice_42), codice_43 (requires using codice_41)). Using codice_17 for codice_5 deals with the problem, but many Unix utilities cannot use NUL as separator (e.g. codice_47, codice_48, codice_49, codice_4, codice_51, codice_52, codice_53, codice_54).

But often people forget this and assume codice_5 is also line-oriented, which is not the case (per default codice_5 separates on newlines and blanks within lines, substrings with blanks must be single- or double-quoted).

The separator problem is illustrated here:

# Make some targets to practice on
touch important_file
touch &#x27;not important_file&#x27;
mkdir -p &#x27;12&quot; records&#x27;

find . -name not\* | tail -1 | xargs rm
find \! -name . -type d | tail -1 | xargs rmdir

Running the above will cause codice_57 to be removed but will remove neither the directory called codice_58, nor the file called codice_59.

The proper fix is to use the GNU-specific codice_39 option, but codice_61 (and other tools) do not support NUL-terminated strings:

# use the same preparation commands as above
find . -name not\* -print0 | xargs -0 rm
find \! -name . -type d -print0 | xargs -0 rmdir
When using the codice_39 option, entries are separated by a null character instead of an end-of-line. This is equivalent to the more verbose command:find . -name not\* | tr \\n \\0 | xargs -0 rm or shorter, by switching codice_5 to (non-POSIX) line-oriented mode with the codice_64 (delimiter) option: find . -name not\* | xargs -d &#x27;\n&#x27; rm

but in general using codice_17 with codice_39 should be preferred, since newlines in filenames are still a problem.

GNU codice_67 is an alternative to codice_5 that is designed to have the same options, but is line-oriented. Thus, using GNU Parallel instead, the above would work as expected.

For Unix environments where codice_5 does not support the codice_17 nor the option (e.g. Solaris, AIX), the POSIX standard states that one can simply backslash-escape every character:find . -name not\* | sed &#x27;s/\(.\)/\\\1/g&#x27; | xargs rm. Alternatively, one can avoid using xargs at all, either by using GNU parallel or using the functionality of .

==Operating on a subset of arguments at a time==
One might be dealing with commands that can only accept one or maybe two arguments at a time. For example, the codice_71 command operates on two files at a time. The codice_72 option to codice_5 specifies how many arguments at a time to supply to the given command. The command will be invoked repeatedly until all input is exhausted. Note that on the last invocation one might get fewer than the desired number of arguments if there is insufficient input. Use codice_5 to break up the input into two arguments per line:

$ echo {0..9} | xargs -n 2
0 1
2 3
4 5
6 7
8 9
In addition to running based on a specified number of arguments at a time, one can also invoke a command for each line of input with the codice_75 option. One can use an arbitrary number of lines at a time, but one is most common. Here is how one might codice_71 every git commit against its parent.

$ git log --format=&quot;%H %P&quot; | xargs -L 1 git diff
==Encoding problem==
The argument separator processing of codice_5 is not the only problem with using the codice_5 program in its default mode. Most Unix tools which are often used to manipulate filenames (for example codice_79, codice_80, codice_81, etc.) are text processing tools. However, Unix path names are not really text. Consider a path name /aaa/bbb/ccc. The /aaa directory and its bbb subdirectory can in general be created by different users with different environments. That means these users could have a different locale setup, and that means that aaa and bbb do not even necessarily have to have the same character encoding. For example, aaa could be in UTF-8 and bbb in Shift JIS. As a result, an absolute path name in a Unix system may not be correctly processable as text under a single character encoding. Tools which rely on their input being text may fail on such strings.

One workaround for this problem is to run such tools in the C locale, which essentially processes the bytes of the input as-is. However, this will change the behavior of the tools in ways the user may not expect (for example, some of the user&#x27;s expectations about case-folding behavior may not be met).

<text>Winterthur (; ) is a city in the canton of Zurich in northern Switzerland. With over 120,000 residents, it is the country&#x27;s sixth-largest city by population, as well as its ninth-largest agglomeration with about 140,000 inhabitants. Located about northeast of Zurich, Winterthur is a service and high-tech industrial satellite city within Zurich Metropolitan Area.

The official language of Winterthur is German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Zurich German. Winterthur is usually abbreviated as &quot;Winti&quot; in the local dialect and by its inhabitants.

Winterthur is connected to Germany by direct trains and has links to Zurich Airport. It is also a regional transport hub: the A1 motorway from Geneva through to St. Margrethen connects in Winterthur with the A4 motorway heading north toward Schaffhausen and the A7 motorway heading close to the Swiss-German border at Kreuzlingen. There are also roads leading to other places such as Turbenthal. The railway station is the fourth busiest railway station in Switzerland, and is 20 minutes away by train from Zurich.

==History==
&quot;Vitudurum&quot; was a &quot;vicus&quot; in what is now Oberwinterthur during the Roman era (first century BC to third century AD). It was fortified into a &quot;castrum&quot; at the end of the third century, apparently in reaction to the incipient Alamannic invasion.

There was an Alamannic settlement on the site in the seventh century.

In a battle near Winterthur in 919, Burchard II of Swabia asserted his control over the Thurgau within the Duchy of Swabia against the claims of Rudolph II of Burgundy.

The counts of Winterthur, a cadet branch of the family of the counts of Bregenz, built Kyburg castle in the tenth century. With the extinction of the counts of Winterthur in 1053, the castle passed to the counts of Dillingen. Winterthur as a city (presumably on the site of a pre-existing village) was founded by Hartmann III of Dillingen in 1180, shortly before his death in the same year. From 1180 to 1263, Winterthur was ruled by the cadet line of the House of Kyburg.

When the counts of Kyburg became extinct in the male line in 1263, Winterthur passed to the House of Habsburg, who established a comital line of &quot;Neu-Kyburg&quot; in 1264 and granted city rights to Winterthur in the same year. From 1415 until 1442 Winterthur was &quot;reichsfrei&quot; (subject only to the Holy Roman Emperor). However, in the Old Zürich War they lost this freedom and came back under the control of the Austrian Habsburgs. Needing money, in 1467, the Habsburgs sold Winterthur to the city of Zurich.
While it was under the leadership of Zurich, Winterthur&#x27;s economic freedom was restricted. It lost many of its market rights and the right to trade in some goods. This ended in 1798, when Napoleonic troops took the town. On 27 May 1799, it was the site of the Battle of Winterthur between elements of the French Army of the Danube and elements of the Habsburg army, commanded by Friedrich, Baron von Hotze during the War of the Second Coalition, in the French Revolutionary Wars. Because Winterthur lies near Zurich and at the junction of seven roads, the army that held the town held the access to most of Switzerland and points crossing the Rhine into southern Germany. Although the forces involved were small, the ability of the Austrians to sustain an 11-hour assault against the French line, on the plateau north of Zurich, resulted in the consolidation of three Austrian forces. This led to the French defeat a few days later.
In the 19th century, Winterthur became an industrial town when companies, like Sulzer, Rieter and SLM, built large industrial plants. Winterthur suffered severely from its investments in and guarantee of loans to the National Railway of Switzerland (a private enterprise). In 1878, Winterthur had to sell its shares in the line, and from 1881 to 1885 it was in great difficulties due to a loan of nine million francs guaranteed in 1874 by the town, together with three others in Aargau, to the enterprise. As the three co-guarantor towns were unable to pay their shares, the whole burden fell on Winterthur, which struggled to meet its liabilities. But it was assisted by large loans from the cantonal and federal governments.

The Great Depression, in the 1930s, hit Winterthur extremely hard. Sixty percent of the total employees in town worked in the machine industry. Jobs became extremely hard to find. However, with the outbreak of World War II, industry grew again in the city.

In 2008, Winterthur reached 100,000 inhabitants.

<text>A lifting bag is an item of diving equipment consisting of a robust and air-tight bag with straps, which is used to lift heavy objects underwater by means of the bag&#x27;s buoyancy. The heavy object can either be moved horizontally underwater by the diver or sent unaccompanied to the surface.

Lift bag appropriate capacity should match the task at hand. If the lift bag is grossly oversized a runaway or otherwise out of control ascent may result. Commercially available lifting bags may incorporate dump valves to allow the operator to control the buoyancy during ascent, but this is a hazardous operation with high risk of entanglement in an uncontrolled lift or sinking. If a single bag is insufficient, multiple bags may be used, and should be distributed to suit the load.

There are also lifting bags used on land as short lift jacks for lifting cars or heavy loads or lifting bags which are used in machines as a type of pneumatic actuator which provides load over a large area. These lifting bags of the AS/CR type are for example used in the brake mechanism of rollercoasters.

==Physics of buoyant lifting==

The volume of the bag determines its lifting capacity: each litre of air inside the bag will lift a weight of 1 kilogram, or each cubic foot will lift about 62 pounds. For example, a bag can lift a underwater object.

A partially filled bag will accelerate as it ascends because the air in the bag expands as the pressure reduces on the ascent, following Boyle&#x27;s law, increasing the bag&#x27;s buoyancy, whereas a full bag will overflow or blow off excess volume and maintain the same volume and buoyancy providing it does not descend. A bag which leaks sufficiently to start sinking will lose volume to compression and become less buoyant in a positive feedback loop until stopped by the bottom.

===Breakout===
The force required to lift a submerged object from the bottom can be split into two main components:
* Apparent weight, which is the weight of the object less the buoyancy of its displacement.
* Breakout forces due to embedment in the bottom, which can be negligible, or in some cases the major part of the load.
Once the object has broken free of the bottom, only the apparent weight remains, and a controlled lift requires a way of managing the sudden decrease of resistance to the lifting force. There are three basic ways this can be done:
* Use of mechanical or hydraulic excavation to loosen the sediments holding the load.
* Use of a &quot;Dead Man Anchor&quot; - a large heavy weight - and restraining cable to prevent the bag from moving away too far, so that the buoyancy can be corrected to more closely match the load.
* Use of shallow bags with long cables to the load to provide breakout, which will only lift a short distance before surfacing, after which the load can be lifted further by staged lifts or direct lift by close-coupled bags.

===Stability of the load===
Once a load is lifted off the substrate, it will rotate until the centre of gravity is in the position of lowest potential energy. If it is suspended from a single point, the apparent centre of gravity (corrected for inherent buoyancy) will be directly below the lift point. If it is undesirable for the load to rotate by a large angle as it leaves the bottom, the lifting point must be chosen to allow for this effect, and a multi-part sling or spreader bar may be needed, and it may be necessary to secure slings so they do not slip.

==Types and construction==
Underwater lifting bags are lifting equipment and as such may be required to comply with safety standards.

===Open lift bags (parachute lift bags)===
Parachute lift bags are open at the bottom. When full any extra or expanding air will spill out. The shape of an open lifting bag should distribute the volume in a vertical rather than a horizontal direction so that the open end of the bag always remains underwater. If the open end reaches the surface, air will escape from the bag and it may sink.

The simplest version are two-sided bags, either joined round the edges or folded and joined along two sides. Webbing straps may be stitched to doubler patches which are then glued or welded to the bag on light duty bags, but on large and heavy duty bags there are usually strips of bag material bonded to the bags which form flat retaining tubes for the webbing which is threaded through the tubes and may be withdrawn for maintenance and inspection. heavy duty open bags are generally conical with a domed top or a reversed truncated cone top, and may have several straps from the lifting point at the bottom, through the guide tubes on the sides, to a crown ring of webbing or steel at the top, to spread the load evenly over the fabric of the bag.

Parachute lift bags cannot be overfilled and are suitable for lifts where there is a large pressure change, and where it may be necessary to capsize (invert) the bag to stop a runaway lift.

Some lift bags can be converted from open to closed by screwing a cover onto the bottom opening.

====Propeller lifting bags====
Installation and removal of propellers is a specialised application where there is usually very little clearance above the load, which is usually at least partly underneath a vessel. Lift bags for this application partly enclose the propeller when in use, and are required to hold the propeller in the correct alignment for fitting to the shaft.
It may be necessary to ballast the lower blade to keep the propeller upright. and details of the rigging will depend on the precise geometry of the propeller, such as aspect ratio, skew, and number of blades. The propeller lift bag will cover the upper part of the propeller, but cannot project below the line of the top of the shaft. It will support the propeller by at least two blades, for stability, and the propeller will generally by slung with a gap at the top, for maximum tip clearance. The bag may be shaped with a relatively horizontal top or a curve to follow the blade disc. Attachment to the blades must be on both sides for stability, and the slings must not harm the blade surfaces or damage the leading or trailing edge.

===Closed lift bags (camels)===
Closed lift bags have an overpressure valve to prevent internal pressure from exceeding ambient pressure by more than a set amount (around 10kPa, or 1msw) Closed lift bags are intended for use at or near the surface, as they retain the air even in rough seas. They are available in several configurations, including horizontal cylinder, vertical cylinder, teardrop and pillow.

===Rapid deployment===
Rapid deployment lift bags have a scuba cylinder mounted on the outside which contains sufficient air to inflate the bag at a specified depth. The bag can be attached to the load and when ready, the valve is opened and the diver swims clear. If the regulator pressure is set to a lower pressure than the over-pressure relief valve, a closed bag will automatically stop filling before the relief valve opens, but will be topped up if it leaks after reaching the surface. The regulator pressure must take into account the hydrostatic pressure difference between the top and bottom of the bag so that the bag will be completely filled.

===Dump valves===
Dump valves are used to release air from the bag when in the water. They can be operated manually at the valve by a diver or may be remotely operated by a pull-cord, which may be operated by a diver or attached to a weight which will automatically open the valve if the weight is lifted off the bottom. Some dump valves can be operated in both these ways. One system operates by pressing on the top or pulling a line attached to the bottom to actuate the spring-loaded valve. The dump valve may be a screw-in quick change system, and the spring tension may be adjustable.

==Use==
===Dynamic lifts===
When the empty lift bag is attached to the load and the lift is made by controlling the volume of inflation air it is referred to as a dynamic lift.

====Direct lift====
The bag or set of bags is used to lift the load directly to the surface. This is simple, but there is a risk if the lift bag is too large and cannot be vented fast enough the lift may get out of control and ascend so fast that the bag breaks the surface, capsizes and collapses, losing so much air that it then cannot support the weight of the load, and will then sink back to the bottom. If there is a marker buoy attached it will at least not be lost. A lift bag which is only slightly larger than needed to support the load will ascend more slowly, and is less likely to capsize at the surface, as excess air will be spilled continuously during the ascent.

====Staged lift====
Lift bags are used to bring the load up in stages: a long chain or sling is used to connect the load to a lift bag just below the surface, which is filled to break out the load and lift it until the bag reaches the surface, then a second bag is used to bring the load up further. This procedure continues until the load has been raised sufficiently. Advantages of this method are a more controlled lift, the facility to use a larger capacity for initial breakout without risk of a runaway. Disadvantages include the requirement for divers to work on or near the lifting gear when under load.

===Buoyancy assisted lift===
The lift is controlled by a line from the surface vessel, and the load is reduced by a lift bag with a volume too small to support the weight of the load when full. This allows a faster lift by the winch. The lifting gear must be capable of supporting the load if the bag fails, or must be arranged to fail safely.

A buoyancy assisted lift is a common procedure for recreational divers to assist the recovery of the shotline or anchor, which would otherwise be pulled up manually. A small lift bag attached to the shot is partially filled by the last diver to leave the bottom, and after surfacing the crew pull up the line and the air in the bag expands as it ascends, providing more assistance to the crew. In this application a runaway lift is not usually a problem, and the bag size is not critical.

===Static lifts===
Lift bags also can be used for static lifts, where the bag is anchored in place by rigging, and used as a lifting point with very high buoyancy compared to the load, which is then lifted in a controlled manner using a purchase or chain block or other suitable lifting device.

=== Rigging lift bags ===
Lift bags can not be over inflated, and can not normally exert a static buoyant force greater than their safe working load (SWL), however the rigging can be subjected to snatch loads, which can be caused by several factors.

* When the bag is used in shallow water and surge or wave action causes rapid changes in dynamic loading, by pulling the bag from side to side
* When the bag has lifted the load to the surface and the bag is subjected to vertical wave action
* When the lift bag is incorrectly rigged
* When the lift bag is snagged, then breaks free to be snubbed when the slack is taken up.
* When the load is partly supported by a lifting cable and there is a sudden variation on the tension in the cable due to vessel movement or cable slip.

When lifting with more than one bag, allowance should be made for reduced filling capacity if bags are attached in such a way that they press against each other.

Incorrect rigging can cause load concentration on attachment points which may exceed the SWL

An inverter or capsizing line can be attached to the top of the bag. This line should be long enough and strong enough to attach to an independent anchor point so that if the lift bag or rigging fails the bag will be inverted and the air will escape, preventing a runaway lift. This procedure is generally used for short-distance transport near the bottom, as when aligning large components for assembly. With this method the load will generally hold the bag in the upright position, so the tripping line may be subjected to considerable load and the bag may not invert. An inverter line can also be attached to the load, so it will capsize the bag if it breaks free of the load, but this will not stop a runaway lift, and a holdback line is used for this purpose.

A holdback line is used to prevent the lift bag and load from floating away when used for short distance lifts at the bottom. The holdback is attached to the lifting ring of the bag, or to the load, and should be attached by a strong cable to an anchor point it cannot lift. The SWL of the holdback should be at least equal to the lifting capacity of the bag. A holdback and inverter are often used together.

A spreader bar may be used to distribute the lifting load more evenly between bags or along the load.

When filling bags, if each bag is completely filled before starting to fill the next bag, it is less likely that a runaway will be initiated, as only one of the bags can increase lift as it ascends. This will be the last bag, and the divers will be monitoring it most carefully while they are filling it, so will be more likely to react in time to regain control of the lift.

A weighted dump line will automatically start open the valve to start dumping excess air if the weight is lifted off the bottom. This will stop the lift from ascending any further if the dump valve releases air fast enough. When the weight is lowered back to the bottom by the sinking load, the valve will close again, and should hold the load steady. The stability of this system depends on the preload of the valve spring and the size of the valve opening.

===Filling lift bags===
The amount of air required for a lift bag depends on the apparent weight of the load and the depth of the bag. Approximately 1 m3 of air at ambient pressure is required per tonne of lift. Free air volume follows Boyle&#x27;s law, and is proportional to absolute ambient pressure in bar or ata.

:For example: A 5 tonne lift with the bags to be filled at 20m, requires 5m3 of air at 3 bar, which is 15m3 at surface pressure.

Filling air is usually supplied from the surface from a low pressure compressor, but for small lifts the diver may carry a cylinder of air for the purpose. It is considered bad practice in some jurisdictions to fill a lift bag from the diver&#x27;s breathing gas cylinder, particularly if the diver has decompression obligations or only one cylinder as the risk of using up too much air and leaving the diver without sufficient air for a safe ascent is considered unacceptable.

Bags can be inflated from a safer distance by use of an air-lance, a rigid pipe which can be inserted into the opening of the bag.

===Hazards of use===
* Snagging of the diver or diver&#x27;s umbilical or lifeline in the lifting equipment, resulting in an uncontrolled rapid ascent.
* Using too much air from a scuba diver&#x27;s breathing gas supply, resulting in an out of air incident.
* Using too much volume in the lift bags, resulting in a positive feedback expansion on ascent and a runaway lift.
* Leaks in lift bags, causing loss of buoyancy and sinking of the load after lifting. The load may then sink increasingly rapidly as the air in the bags compresses, and may be a hazard to divers below or working on the load at the surface, or the load may be lost.
* Unbalanced attachment of lifting gear may cause the load to be unstable once lifted free of the bottom. subsequent capsize or shifting of the load may break it free of the rigging, or damage the load or the lift bag. Similarly, poorly chosen or inadequate lifting points may result in overstressing the cargo and causing damage.

===Marking the lift===
If there is a significant risk of the bag losing buoyancy and sinking again with the load, a surface marker can be attached that will remain at the surface and mark the new position of the load so that it can be recovered again. The marker buoy line should be long enough to reach the surface if the load sinks anywhere in the vicinity.

==Securing the load at the surface==
Once at the surface, the load may be secured by adding more buoyancy, lifting on board a vessel or other method.

<doc id="502124" wikidata="Q1244996" url="?curid=502124" title="Pistis Sophia">
<text>Pistis Sophia () is a Gnostic text discovered in 1773, possibly written between the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. The existing manuscript, which some scholars place in the late 4th century, relates one Gnostic group&#x27;s teachings of the transfigured Jesus to the assembled disciples, including his mother Mary, Mary Magdalene, and Martha. (In this context, &quot;transfigured&quot; refers to Jesus after his death and resurrection, not the event during his life where he spoke to appearances of Moses and Elijah on a mountain.) In this text, the risen Jesus had spent eleven years speaking with his disciples, teaching them only the lower mysteries. After eleven years, he receives his true garment and is able to reveal the higher mysteries revered by this group. The prized mysteries relate to complex cosmologies and knowledge necessary for the soul to reach the highest divine realms.

Much of the first two books of the manuscript are dedicated to outlining the myth of the fall and restoration of the figure known as Pistis Sophia, in particular giving detailed parallels between her prayers of repentance and particular Psalms and Odes of Solomon.

Although in many Gnostic texts and systems Sophia is a major female divinity, in &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot; she originates and dwells outside of the divine realm. Her fall and redemption parallel that found in versions of the Sophia myth such as that in the Apocryphon of John, but the actions all take place in the material aeons, and she can only be restored to her place in the thirteenth aeon, outside the Kingdom of Light.

==The Askew Codex==
&quot;Pístis Sophía&quot; has been preserved in a single Coptic language manuscript originally comprising 178 leaves of parchment, but currently consisting of 174 leaves. This &quot;Askew Codex&quot; was purchased by the British Museum (now British Library) in 1785 from collector Anthony Askew. The Greek title &quot;Pístis Sophía&quot; was assigned by Carl Gottfried Woide, based on a title at the beginning of Book 2, &quot;The Second Book of the Pistis Sophia,&quot; which was added by a later hand. Carl Schmidt suggests &quot;Books of the Saviour&quot;, based on a title found at the end of the same book.

The expression &quot;Pístis Sophía&quot; is obscure, and its English translations varied: &quot;The Wisdom of Faith&quot;, &quot;Faith Wisdom&quot;, &quot;Wisdom in Faith&quot;, or &quot;Faith in Wisdom&quot;. To some later Gnostics, &quot;Sophia&quot; was a divine syzygy of Christ, rather than simply a word meaning &quot;wisdom&quot;, and this context suggests the interpretation &quot;The Faith of Sophia&quot;, or &quot;The Loyalty of Sophia&quot;. Both the Berlin Codex and a papyrus codex at Nag Hammadi have an earlier, simpler &quot;Sophia&quot; wherein the transfigured Christ explains &quot;Pístis&quot; obscurely:

The work is divided into several parts, with debate as to the number of parts. The most common view is that the work consists of four books, but some have posited as many as five or six books. Additionally, the codex contains two fragments in a later hand that are not directly connected to any of the main books.

Until the discovery of the Nag Hammadi library in 1945, the Askew Codex was one of three codices that contained almost all of the Gnostic writings that had survived the suppression of such literature both in East and West, the other two codices being the Bruce Codex and the Berlin Codex. Aside from these primary sources, everything written about gnosticism before the Nag Hammadi library became available is based on quotes, characterizations, and caricatures in the writings of the enemies of Gnosticism. The purpose of these heresiological writings was polemical, presenting gnostic teachings as absurd, bizarre, and self-serving, and as an aberrant heresy from a proto-orthodox and orthodox Christian standpoint.

==Text==

The work as a whole shows clear signs of having been compiled from multiple sources, with only the first two books following directly on each other. Even within a single book, occasionally multiple, differing accounts of a single event or cosmological outline appear, suggesting the use and preservation of several sources. Changes in terminology and cosmological description between books also shows that it is a compilation of texts that may have been written over a period of some time.

The bulk of the text (Books 1-3) is in the form of a dialogue between Jesus and the disciples, both male and female. Mary Magdalene is the most featured disciple, who provides many questions and scriptural interpretations; John “the Virgin” is the second most prominent. Other figures named as followers include Andrew, Bartholomew, James, John, Mary the mother of Jesus, Martha, Matthew, Peter, Philip, Salome, Simon the Canaanite, and Thomas.

===First Book===
The first book (Chapters 1-62) establishes that Jesus remained with the disciples for 11 years after the resurrection, teaching them only the lowest of the mysteries. At a certain point, he ascends and traverses the aeons, defeating the wicked archons, before returning to speak with the disciples further. It connects Jesus’ actions to the effectiveness of astrologers in the world – it suggests he has reduced, but not eliminated, the effectiveness of astrological magic. This leads into the introduction of the myth of Pistis Sophia&#x27;s fall and restoration, which takes up the bulk of both the first and second book. Pistis Sophia recites several prayers/repentances, and after each one a disciple interprets the repentance in light of one of the Psalms or Odes of Solomon.

Unlike other versions of the Gnostic myth, such as the Apocryphon of John, here Pistis Sophia is a being of the lower, material aeons. She is not a high, divine being, and her restoration is not to the realms of light, but only back to her place in the thirteenth aeon. This is significant in distinguishing the theology of this book from other Gnostic systems – it prioritizes its own, distinct cosmology and mythology above the Sophia myth, which to this author represents inferior, material struggles.

===Second Book===
This book makes up Chapters 63-101. After the conclusion of the story of Pistis Sophia, the text turns to lengthy explanations of cosmology and the knowledge offered by the mysteries of this author&#x27;s system. The end of the book also suggests the close connection of this work with the Books of Jeu found in the Bruce Codex (Chapter 99).

===Third Book===
The third book (Chapters 102-135) is mostly concerned with presenting an ethical or lifestyle code for adherents of the text. It outlines what is needed for right thought and right action, as well as actions that are not acceptable and their punishments. It also discusses at length the dissemination of the mysteries, repentance, and when it is or is not permissible to grant the mysteries to others. Finally, it discusses the formation of the human being, its components, and how they are connected. Again the Books of Jeu are referenced (Chapter 134), with the stipulation that they contain mysteries that are necessary for all, including the righteous.

===Fourth Book===
Part one of this book (Chapters 136-143) deals with cosmological and astrological speculation, and ritual development. It presents a myth of fallen archons of the aeons being imprisoned within the zodiacal sphere; outlines five realms of punishment (the Midst) and the types of sinners each holds; and gives specific configurations of the planets in the zodiac that allow souls to be released from each region. Jesus also interprets the elements of his incarnation and their role in the world, and administers the “baptism of the first offering” to his disciples.

The second part of what is commonly thought of as the fourth book (chapters 144-148) appears after a lacuna in the text, and is probably part of a separate book. Its cosmology is different from the preceding text, and it focuses entirely on the destiny of various types of souls and the punishments of sinners. Some of the sins listed are duplicates from part one of book four, but list different punishments.

==Cosmology==
Cosmology is a primary focus of the Pistis Sophia – learning the structure of the universe and how to traverse it is considered key in these texts, and the cosmology is one of the most complex from any Gnostic text remaining today. Summarizing the cosmology is further complicated because the structure is slightly different in each of its separate books, with certain realms added and removed.

Some scholars have suggested cosmologies encompassing the entirety of the codex; recently an outline has been made looking at the cosmology of each text individually. A general overview could be seen as:
*The Treasury of Light (the place of the right; separate regions in Books 1 &amp; 2 only)
*The Midst (&quot;mesos&quot;)
*The thirteenth aeon (excluded in Book 3 and part two of Book 4)
*The twelve aeons/&quot;heimarmene&quot; (separate regions in Books 1 &amp; 2 only)
*The first sphere (Books 1 &amp; 2 only)
*The firmament (Books 1 &amp; 2 only)
*Amente (Book 3 and part two of Book 4 only)
*Chaos (Book 3 and part two of Book 4 only)
*The Midst (&quot;mhte&quot;) (Books 3 &amp; 4 only)
*The Outer Darkness (Books 3 &amp; 4 only)
Notably, the portion of Books 1 &amp; 2 dealing with the myth of Pistis Sophia&#x27;s fall and redemption use a different cosmology from the rest of those books. The most controversial point in this alternate cosmological conception is reference to the thirteenth aeon, Pistis Sophia&#x27;s home, as a place of “righteousness;” this view of the thirteenth aeon is absent from the rest of the text.

In Books 1-3, all the regions except for the punishment realms are also known as the Spaces of the First Mystery, and in Books 1 &amp; 2, all the regions from the thirteenth aeon downward are considered the Outer Darkness.

Generally speaking, the aeonic realms represent the material universe, bounded by the stars and the zodiac. The Midst is the space dividing this region from the upper realms, and is sometimes a waiting space for souls before being allowed to enter the light realms. The goal of the soul is to ascend beyond the aeons and enter the upper realms of light. This is achieved by receiving the mysteries offered by the group represented by these texts.

The mysteries are not explicitly listed in the text; an initiate would most likely have to prove him or herself worthy by living for some period according to the ethical guidelines provided in the texts before undergoing the baptisms and gaining access to the mysteries. The Books of Jeu are noted as a source of the mysteries; it is probable that the texts found in the Bruce Codex are very similar, if not identical, with these texts.

==Key figures==

===Pistis Sophia===

The story of Pistis Sophia&#x27;s fall and restoration (chapters 29-82) dominates much of Books 1 &amp; 2. She dwells in the thirteenth aeon, is tricked into leaving her aeon and descending into Chaos, has her light-power stolen, and is not allowed to return to her place until Jesus ascends through the aeons. She recites many repentances and prayers, and is repeatedly persecuted by wicked archontic beings before being allowed to wait just outside of the thirteenth aeon for restoration.

It is noteworthy that she is not a divine being, as portrayed in other versions of the Gnostic myth such as the Apocryphon of John. She is a being of the material aeons, and her restoration is only as far as the thirteenth material aeon. The myth as a whole seems to have been adopted to address the beliefs of another Gnostic group, and to assert the superiority of this text&#x27;s system: humans who receive the mysteries of this group can surpass Pistis Sophia and reach the divine realms of light.

===Authades===

Authades is the equivalent of Ialdabaoth/the demiurge in versions of the Sophia myth such as that found in the Apocryphon of John. Unlike Ialdabaoth, he is not created by the Sophia figure, and in fact he holds a slightly higher hierarchical position than Pistis Sophia. His sin is wishing to rule all the material aeons, and he grows jealous when Pistis Sophia chooses to worship the light rather than continuing the ways of the aeons. Authades appears only in the chapters dealing with the Sophia myth; elsewhere Sabaoth the Adamas is the representative of evil in these texts.

===Jesus===

Jesus serves as a teacher or instructor, teaching his disciples information about the divine world they will need to progress to a higher state of being, as well as knowledge of the cosmic realms, their inhabitants, and their functions. He teaches the disciples baptismal rites, and instructs them to give these rites to all who show themselves worthy. He is closely tied to the highest divine being. However, little significance is given to his earthly incarnation – the ritual bread and wine in the baptism is not associated with the Christian Eucharist, and the crucifixion and resurrection play little role. Here, he only gains his true garment and teaches the disciples the higher mysteries eleven years after his resurrection – downplaying versions of Christianity claiming his earlier teachings as ultimate truth.

===Jeu===

This is the demiurge of these texts. Jeu dwells in the Treasury of Light and organizes the cosmos. He places the archons and the aeons in their proper places, and assigns powers to the planets, effectively offering a divine origin for astrology. This is particularly noteworthy given the anti-cosmic nature of some other Gnostic groups.

He is sometimes referred to as the “Father of Jesus’ Father.” Jeu is considered the father of the Great Sabaoth, the Good, who provides the soul to Jesus’ earthly incarnation – thus Jeu is the father of Jesus’ earthly father. The divine Jesus’ true father remains the highest, ineffable God.

===Zorokothora Melchisedek===

Often referred to simply as Melchisedek, this figure also dwells in the Treasury of Light or Place of the Right. His primary role is overseeing transport of light from the lower realms to the higher light realms as it becomes purified. His subordinates also deliver certain souls out of the punishment regions when believers on Earth pray for them.

===The Great Sabaoth, the Good===

As mentioned above, this figure provides a power or soul for Jesus’ earthly incarnation, making him effectively Jesus’ earthly father. This role is most widely discussed through extensive interpretations of Psalm 85:10-11 in Chapters 62-63.

===Sabaoth, the Adamas===

This is the primary representative of evil or wickedness in the majority of the Pistis Sophia. He is accused of inappropriate sexual conduct, begetting archons and other beings, and as a result he is imprisoned in the bounds of the zodiac, or the material universe. For those human souls who did not receive the mysteries before death and are thus bound to be reincarnated in the world, he is also responsible for giving the “cup of forgetfulness,” denying them the knowledge they had acquired from previous lives and punishments.

<text>The Artifact Small Format Film Festival (formerly the $100 Film Festival) is Calgary&#x27;s only celluloid-based film festival. When the $100 Film Festival was born in 1992, it showcased eight short films on Super 8. The name sprung from the challenge to shoot a short film on four rolls of Super 8 – which tallied to the cost of $100. In following years, the festival dropped the budgetary limit and allowed 16 mm film, which shifted the focus from low budget to quality small-format films. Thus, the name was changed to the Artifact Small Format Film Festival in 2017 so as to better represent the festival&#x27;s role as an international celebration of creative story telling on celluloid.

Over the years, Artifact has expanded to include the popular Film/Music Explosion!, commission projects, and various partnerships.

Artifact is one of only a handful of festivals worldwide that exhibit exclusively on small-format celluloid.

<text>The Industrial Commission was a United States government body in existence from 1898 to 1902, to recommend changes in national industrial and economic policy and programs. The commission was established by an act of Congress and was composed of members of Congress and Presidential appointees.

== Background and mission ==
The Panic of 1893 created substantial economic instability and uncertainty throughout the United States in the mid-to late 1890s. One response to this uncertainty was a proposal from the National Association of Manufacturers that Congress create a federal Department of Commerce and Industry. During the 1890s Congress declined to establish such a department, but it considered creating a commission to study the nation&#x27;s economic situation. In 1897 President Grover Cleveland vetoed a bill that would have established the Industrial Commission. In 1898, after the election of President William McKinley, Congress again approved legislation for the commission, and McKinley signed the bill on June 18, 1898.

The commission was charged with investigating railroad pricing policy, industrial concentration, and the impact of immigration on labor markets, and making recommendations to the President and Congress.

== Membership ==
The commission comprised 19 members, 10 of which were members of Congress and 9 appointed by the President. McKinley selected appointees from the business community and organized labor. Members included McKinley&#x27;s Ohio running mate, Commissioner Andrew L. Harris (a Governor of Ohio and Civil War General) who served as Chair of the Agriculture Subcommittee.

== Recommendations, dissolution and aftermath ==

In 1902 the commission completed its business and issued a final report totaling about 1,000 pages in 18 volumes. Included among its many recommendations were a call for more extensive federal regulation of trusts, and that the financial records of national corporations and banks be subject to inspection at all times.

Congress established the United States Department of Commerce and Labor in 1903. President Theodore Roosevelt supported enforcement of the Sherman Antitrust Act and expanded regulation of trusts during his administration. Legislative reforms included the Elkins Act (1903) and the Hepburn Act (1906), which expanded the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the regulation of railroads.

<doc id="502133" wikidata="Q7783043" url="?curid=502133" title="Thermal diode">
<text>The term &quot;thermal diode&quot; can refer to:

* a (possibly non-electrical) device which allows heat to flow preferentially in one direction;
* an electrical (semiconductor) diode in reference to a thermal effect or function;
* or it may describe both situations, where an electrical diode is used as a heat pump or thermoelectric cooler.

==One-way heat-flow==
A thermal diode in this sense is a device whose thermal resistance is different for heat flow in one direction than for heat flow in the other direction. I.e., when the thermal diode&#x27;s first terminal is hotter than the second, heat will flow easily from the first to the second, but when the second terminal is hotter than the first, little heat will flow from the second to the first.

Such an effect was first observed in a copper–cuprous-oxide interface by Chauncey Starr in the 1930s. Beginning in 2002, theoretical models were proposed to explain this effect. In 2006 the first microscopic solid-state thermal diodes were built. In April 2015 Italian researchers at CNR announced development of a working thermal diode, publishing results in Nature Nanotechnology.

Thermal siphons can act as a one-way heat flow. 
Heat pipes operating in gravity may also have this effect.

==Electrical diode thermal effect or function==
A sensor device embedded on microprocessors used to monitor the temperature of the processor&#x27;s die is also known as a &quot;thermal diode&quot;.

This application of thermal diode is based on the property of electrical diodes to change voltage across it linearly according to temperature. As the temperature increases, diodes&#x27; forward voltage decreases. Microprocessors having high clock rate encounter high thermal loads. To monitor the temperature limits thermal diodes are used. They are usually placed in that part of the processor core where highest temperature is encountered. Voltage developed across it varies with the temperature of the diode. All modern AMD and Intel CPUs, as well as AMD and Nvidia GPUs have on-chip thermal diodes. As the sensor is located directly on the processor die, it provides most local and relevant CPU and GPU temperature readings. The silicon diodes have temperature dependency of -2mV per degree Celsius. Thus the junction temperature can be determined by passing a set current through the diode and then measuring voltage developed across it. In addition to processors, the same technology is widely used in dedicated temperature sensor IC&#x27;s.

==Thermoelectric heat-pump or cooler==
There are two types. One uses semiconductor, or less efficient metal, i.e. thermocouples, working on the principles of the Peltier-Seebeck effect. The other relies on vacuum tubes and the principles of thermionic emission.

===Peltier devices===
* a heat engine working backwards as a refrigerator, such as a Peltier device (diode)

==Advancements==

As of 2009 a team at MIT is working for construction of thermal diodes that convert heat to electricity at lower temperatures than before. This can be used in construction of engines or in electricity production. The efficiency of present thermal diodes is about 18% between the temperature range of 200-300 degree Celsius.

<doc id="502134" wikidata="Q68103" url="?curid=502134" title="Interlaken">
<text>Interlaken (; lit.: &quot;between lakes&quot;) is a Swiss town and municipality in the Interlaken-Oberhasli administrative district in the canton of Bern. It is an important and well-known tourist destination in the Bernese Oberland region of the Swiss Alps, and the main transport gateway to the mountains and lakes of that region.

The town is located on flat alluvial land called Bödeli between two lakes, Brienz to the east and Thun to the west, and alongside the river Aare, which flows between them. Transport routes to the east and west alongside the lakes are complemented by a route southwards into the near mountain resorts and high mountains, e.g. the famous high Alpine peaks of Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau, following upwards the Lütschine.

Interlaken is the central town of a small agglomeration with the same name of 23,300 inhabitants.

The official language of Interlaken is German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Bernese German.

==History==

Until 1891, Interlaken was known as &quot;Aarmühle&quot;. The convent of the Augustinian Canons was built around 1133 when it was mentioned as &quot;inter lacus Madon&quot; and lasted until 1528. The mill on the left bank of the Aare was first mentioned in 1365 as &quot;Amuli&quot;, while the town on the right bank was mentioned in 1239 as &quot;villa Inderlappen&quot;.

=== Early history ===
While some scattered Neolithic flint objects, early Bronze Age swords and Roman era coins have been found near Interlaken, there is no evidence for a settlement in the area before the Middle Ages. Interlaken Monastery was built around 1133 on imperial land on the left side of the Aare. The monastery controlled a bridge over the river and generated an income from tolls. A village grew up around the monastery, along with a mill (which gave the municipality its name until 1891). On the right bank of the river, Interlaken village developed. In 1279/80 the village of Unterseen developed near Interlaken village. Also near the village were the imperial castle of Weissenau and the market town of Widen. The castle and market town became the possessions of the monastery, but fell into disrepair in the Late Middle Ages.

=== Interlaken Monastery ===
The Interlaken Monastery was first mentioned in 1133 when Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor took it under his protection. By 1247, there were also women at the monastery. During the 13th century the monastery&#x27;s influence spread throughout the neighboring area and into the Aare and Gürbe valleys. They eventually had authority over two dozen churches along with a number of villages and farms and became the largest religious landholder in the region.

During the 13th and the beginning of the 14th century, the monastery grew and prospered. However, in 1350 a period of crises and conflicts led to a decline in the number of monks and nuns and increasing debt. A document from 1310, indicates that there were 30 priests, 20 lay brothers, and 350 women at the monastery. In contrast, in 1472 there were only the provost, the prior, nine ordinary canons, seven novices and 27 nuns. At this time, the monastery also had problems with its tenants and neighbors. In 1348, the people of Grindelwald and Wilderswil joined a mutual defense league with Unterwalden. Bern responded with a military expedition to the Bernese Oberland, which ended in defeat for Unterwalden and its allies. In 1445 the Evil League () rose up in the Oberland near Interlaken and fought against Bernese military service and taxes following the Old Zürich War.

During the 14th century, the canons and nuns stopped following most of the monastic rules. In 1472 a violent dispute between the men and the women&#x27;s convents resulted in two visitations by the Bishop of Lausanne who noted serious deficiencies. The provost was arrested and some of the canons were replaced by canons from other convents. Despite the reform measures the nun&#x27;s convent was closed in 1484 and its property transferred to the newly founded monastery of St. Vincent in Bern.

During the Protestant Reformation, the monastery was secularized in 1528. The canons received a financial settlement and the properties were now managed by a Bernese bailiff. The tenants of the monastery who had expected the abolition of allowed interest responded by rioting, which was suppressed by Bern.

After the Reformation, Bern created the Interlaken bailiwick from the monastery lands. Part of the monastery building was used as the headquarters of the district administration, while the rest was used as an indigent hospital. In 1562-63 Bern converted the monastery church&#x27;s choir into a granary and a wine cellar. In 1746-50 the west wing was demolished and Governor Samuel Tillier built the so-called &quot;New Castle&quot;. It has remained the center of administration for the Interlaken District since that time.

=== Aarmühle village ===

Aarmühle was named for the mill on the Aare which was built there in or before 1365. Starting in 1365, the monastery held weekly and yearly markets at Aarmühle. It had its own bäuert (agricultural cooperative) but was politically part of the municipality of Matten.

In the 16th century, the bäuert of Aarmühle and the surrounding bäuerten began quarreling over the use of common fields and woods. Attempts at arbitration in 1533, 1586, and 1618 were unsuccessful. Partly as a result of the quarreling, in 1633, Wilderswil separated from Matten and became an independent municipality. However, the dispute continued between Aarmühle and Matten, and in 1761, the governor of the Interlaken district attempted, unsuccessfully, to mediate. Finally, in 1810 the two villages divided their common property, though it took until 1838 for Aarmühle to become an independent political municipality.

Around the time of the separation, the number of tenant farmers (farmers that did not own the land that they worked) was very different in Aarmühle and Matten. In 1831, 37% of the population in Aarmühle were tenants, while only 12% were in Matten. This meant that the population of Matten was closely tied to the land and remained farmers, while in Aarmühle they began to support the growing tourism trade.

===Aarmühle becomes Interlaken===
On the right bank of the Aare, Unterseen became the only municipality and absorbed the village of Interlaken. In 1838, on the left bank, the villages became the two municipalities of Matten and Aarmühle. However, Aarmühle used the name Interlaken for its post office and train station, leading to that name becoming more well known. Officially the name changed to Interlaken in 1891.

=== Rise of tourism ===
Interlaken&#x27;s reputation as international resort started around 1800 due to the landscapes of Franz Niklaus König and other Swiss landscape artists. The success of the Unspunnenfest, a festival of Swiss culture, in 1805 and 1808 brought many tourists to Interlaken. Starting in 1820, they came for mountain air and spa treatment and the large Kursaal opened in 1859 to provide an elegant spa. The many hotels combined with good transportation links made it easy for these early tourists to visit. In 1835 a steam ship route opened along Lake Thun from Thun, followed in 1839 by another along Lake Brienz from Brienz.

In 1872, the Bödelibahn railway opened from Därligen, on Lake Thun, to Interlaken. Two years later it was extended to Bönigen, on Lake Brienz. Initially, this line was unconnected to the rest of the Swiss railway system and served as a link between the steamships on both lakes. However, in 1893, the Lake Thun railway line opened alongside Lake Thun providing a direct rail connection to Thun, with onward connections to Bern and beyond. In 1888, the Brünig railway opened between Alpnachstad, on Lake Lucerne, and Brienz, on Lake Brienz, thus providing a through steamer and rail connection from Interlaken to Lucerne. By 1916, the Brünig railway had reached Interlaken from Brienz, and, together with an earlier extension at its eastern end, provided a direct rail route to Lucerne. In 1890, the Berner Oberland railway connected Interlaken to the tourist destinations of Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald.

With the opening up of transport links, hotels developed along the route to the Jungfrau. In 1860–75 and 1890–1914 several luxury hotels were built with views of the Jungfrau and surrounding mountains. The current Kursaal was built in 1898-99 and remodeled in 1909–10.

Despite the emphasis on tourism, a parquet factory operated from 1850 until 1935 and a wool weaving factory opened in 1921. In the late 20th century a woolen thread and a metal products factory opened in Interlaken. Since 1988, Interlaken has been connected to the A8 motorway.

=== Modern Interlaken ===
The tourism industry&#x27;s frantic growth abruptly ended in 1914 when World War I started, though it resumed somewhat after the war. World War II brought another dramatic slowdown. Interlaken started to recover from the effects of the war in 1955 as Interlaken re-branded itself as a convention and conference center. Today, the two nuclei villages (Aarmühle and the village around the Bailiff&#x27;s Castle) have been joined by new construction between them. The municipalities of Matten and Unterseen are also connected by new construction to Interlaken and share a common infrastructure. A referendum to merge the three political municipalities into one was voted down in 1914 and again in 1927.

The town is principally a base from which to explore the surrounding areas. Among the main attractions are the mountains of the Jungfrau region, including the Jungfrau, (), the Mönch () and the Eiger (). Whilst the peaks of these mountains are accessible only to mountaineers, a sequence of connecting mountain railways gives access to the Jungfraujoch, a saddle () between the Jungfrau and the Mönch, but correctly translated as a yoke (), which is the highest point in Europe reachable by train.

Closer to Interlaken, the Harderkulm (), just to the north of the town, and the Schynige Platte (), just to the south, are also accessible by railway and provide extensive views of the higher mountains. Lake Thun and Lake Brienz are both close to the town, and the Aare flows east to west through the town. Boat trips operate on both lakes, serving various lakeside towns. One of these, Brienz, is the starting point for one of Switzerland&#x27;s last remaining steam operated mountain railway, the Brienz Rothorn Railway.

Jungfrau Park, an amusement park, is situated just to the south of Interlaken. It was originally opened as a Mystery Park, a paranormal-based theme park owned by the author Erich von Däniken, but was closed in 2006 after three years because of financial difficulties. It re-opened in its current guise in 2009.

Interlaken has a large selection of hotels of various grades, many of which are located along the &quot;Höheweg&quot;, a street that links the town&#x27;s two railway stations and offers views of the mountains.

Besides being the terminal of the Thunersee line, Interlaken Ost is also the terminus of the Zentralbahn&#x27;s Brünig line to Brienz, Meiringen and Luzern, with onward connections to north-eastern Switzerland. The Berner Oberland railway also operates from Ost station, providing the first stage of several mountain railway routes into the Jungfrau region and, most notably, to Europe&#x27;s highest station at the Jungfraujoch.

Boat services across Lake Brienz to Brienz and across Lake Thun to Spiez and Thun are operated by the BLS AG. The boats on Lake Thun operate from a quay adjacent to the West station, connected to Lake Thun by the Interlaken ship canal. The boats on Lake Brienz operate from a quay on the Aare by the Ost station. The remainder of the Aare between the two lakes is controlled by several weirs and is not navigable.

Interlaken is connected by the A8 motorway to Thun and Lucerne, with onward connections by other Swiss motorways to the rest of Switzerland. Local roads also follow both banks of the lakes to east and west and follow the valley of the Lütschine south into the Jungfrau region. However, there is no direct road connection across the mountains of that region into the canton of Valais to the south, with the nearest such connections being the Grimsel Pass to the east, or using the vehicle transport service through the Lötschberg rail tunnel to the west.

<text>A color term (or color name) is a word or phrase that refers to a specific color. The color term may refer to human perception of that color (which is affected by visual context) which is usually defined according to the Munsell color system, or to an underlying physical property (such as a specific wavelength on the spectrum of visible light). There are also numerical systems of color specification, referred to as color spaces.

An important distinction must be established between color and shape, as these two attributes usually are used in conjunction with one another when describing in language. For example, they are labeled as alternative parts of speech terms color term and shape term.

Psychological conditions for recognition of colors exist, such as those who cannot discern colors in general or those who see colors as sound (a variety of synesthesia).

== Color dimensions ==
Typical human color vision is trichromatic, meaning it is based on a three-dimensional color gamut. These three dimensions can be defined in different ways, but often the most intuitive definition are the dimensions of the HSL/HSV color space:

* Hue: representing the different colors of the rainbow or color wheel (e.g. &#x27;red&#x27;, &#x27;orange&#x27;, &#x27;yellow&#x27;, etc.); roughly analogous to the color&#x27;s wavelength or frequency.
* Saturation: the colorfulness of the color, i.e. a measure of vibrant vs. pale.
* Luminosity: a measurement of intensity or &#x27;brightness&#x27;.

==In natural languages==

===Lexicology===
 color words are composed of individual lexemes, or &quot;root words&quot;, such as &#x27;red&#x27;, &#x27;brown&#x27;, &#x27;fuchsia&#x27;, or &#x27;olive&#x27;. The root words generally describe the hue of the color, but some root wordsnamely browncan also describe the other dimensions. Compound color words make use of prefix adjectives (e.g. &#x27;light brown&#x27;, &#x27;sea green&#x27;), that generally describe the saturation or luminosity, or compounded basic color words (e.g. &#x27;yellow-green&#x27;), which refine the hue of the color relative to root words. , the Finnish word for &#x27;pink&#x27;, is a clear agglutination of the language&#x27;s words for &#x27;pale&#x27; () and &#x27;red&#x27; ().

=== Basic color terms ===

Basic color terms meet the following criteria:
* monolexemic (&#x27;green&#x27;, but not &#x27;light green&#x27; or &#x27;forest green&#x27;),
* high-frequency, and
* agreed upon by speakers of that language.

English has 11 basic color terms: black, white, red, green, yellow, blue, brown, orange, pink, purple, and gray; other languages have between 2 and 12. All other colors are considered by most speakers of that language to be variants of these basic color terms. A useful litmus test involves replacing each of these basic terms with an approximation of other basic terms, e.g. replacing orange with red-yellow. If the approximation is &quot;&quot;, the replaced term likely meets the requirement for being a basic color term.
An example of a color that comes close to being a basic color term in English is &quot;turquoise&quot;. It is monolexemic, but is not very high frequency, especially compared to alternatives teal or cyan. It also generally fails the above litmus test in that most people do not find the use of the approximation of other basic color terms (blue-green) to be jarring.

===Color-term hierarchy===
In the classic study of Brent Berlin and Paul Kay (1969), &quot;Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution&quot;, the researchers argued that the differences in number of basic color terms in languages follow a repeatable pattern. Color terms can be organized into a coherent hierarchy and there are a limited number of universal basic color terms which begin to be used by individual cultures in a relatively fixed order. This order is defined in stages I to VII. Berlin and Kay originally based their analysis on a comparison of color words in 20 languages from around the world. The model is presented below, broken into stages, with stage I on the left and stage VII on the right:formula_1

Berlin and Kay&#x27;s study identified seven stages of color distinction systems. Each progressive stage features a color term that the previous stages do not.

====Stage I (dark and light)====

Stage I contains two terms, white and black (light and dark); these terms are referenced broadly to describe other undefined color terms. For example, the Yali highland group in New Guinea identify the color of blood as black. This is because blood, as a relatively dark liquid, is grouped into the same color classification as black.

In the Bassa language, there are two terms for classifying colors; (white, yellow, orange, and red) and (black, violet, blue, and green).

In the Pirahã language, there appear to be no color terms beyond describing lightness and darkness.

The Dani language of western New Guinea differentiates only two basic colors: for cool/dark shades such as blue, green, and black; and for warm/light colors such as red, yellow, and white.

====Stage II (red)====

Stage II implements a third term for red. Objects begin to rely less on their brightness for classification and in this stage we instead see each term cover a larger scope of colors. Specifically, blue and other darker shades continue to be described as black, yellow and orange colors are classified with red, and other bright colors continue to be classified with white.

In the Bambara language, there are three color terms: (white, beige), (reddish, brownish), and (dark green, indigo, and black).

====Stage III/IV (yellow + green)====

Stage III identifies a third term referring either to green (IIIa) or yellow (IIIb). Most languages in the study with this system identify yellow over green, such as the Komi language, where green is considered a shade of yellow (, ), called ( . However, the Nigerian Ibibio language and the Philippine Hanunoo language both identify green instead of yellow.

The Ovahimba use four color names: stands for dark shades of blue, red, green, and purple; is white and some shades of yellow; is some shades of green and blue; and is some other shades of green, red, and brown. It is thought that this may increase the time it takes for the Ovahimba to distinguish between two colors that fall under the same Herero color category, compared to people whose language separates the colors into two different color categories.
Stage IV incorporates green or yellow, whichever was not already present, i.e. stage IIIa languages will adopt yellow and stage IIIb languages will adopt green. Most stage IV languages continue to colexify blue and green, as listed in &quot;Blue–green distinction in language&quot;.

The Chinese character (pronounced in Mandarin and in Japanese) has a meaning that covers both blue and green. In more contemporary terms, they are (, in Mandarin) and (, in Mandarin) respectively. Japanese also has two terms that refer specifically to the color green, (, derived from the classical Japanese descriptive verb in reference to trees) and (, which is derived from the English word &#x27;green&#x27;).

====Stage V (blue)====

Stage V introduces blue as its own color term, differentiating from black or from green.

====Stage VI (brown)====
The seventh basic color term is likely to be brown.

In English, this is the first basic color term (other than black and white) that is not differentiated on hue, but rather on lightness. English splits some hues into several distinct colors according to lightness: such as red and pink or orange and brown. To English speakers, these pairs of colors, which are objectively no more different from one another than light green and dark green, are conceived of as belonging to different categories.

====Stage VII====
Stage VII adds additional terms for orange, pink, purple, or gray, but these do not exhibit the same hierarchy as the previous seven colors. 

English contains eleven basic color terms: &#x27;black&#x27;, &#x27;white&#x27;, &#x27;red&#x27;, &#x27;green&#x27;, &#x27;yellow&#x27;, &#x27;blue&#x27;, &#x27;brown&#x27;, &#x27;orange&#x27;, &#x27;pink&#x27;, &#x27;purple&#x27;, and &#x27;gray&#x27;.

====Stage VII+====

Languages with further color distinction use relativistic light/dark terms like light blue/ dark blue (in comparison to blue sky/ blue ocean), or pale red/ deep red.

Italian, Russian and Hebrew have twelve basic color terms, each distinguishing blue and light blue. A Russian will make the same red/pink and orange/brown distinctions, but will also make a further distinction between () and (), which English speakers would call dark and light blue. To Russian speakers, and are as separate as red and pink, or orange and brown.

Hungarian and Turkish distinguish multiple words for &#x27;red&#x27;: and (Hungarian; is a darker red), and , , and (Turkish); now includes all reds but originally referred to crimson, to which it is cognate, while mainly refers to scarlet and other orange-tinted or brownish reds. Two words for &#x27;red&#x27; are also found in Irish and Scottish Gaelic: ( for light, bright red and or respectively for dark, brownish red). Turkish also has two words for &#x27;white&#x27; ( and ) and &#x27;black&#x27; ( and ). and have the same meaning, while is a broader term than and also includes dark browns; which word is used also depends on the kind of object being described. Both and are of Turkic origin, while is borrowed from Persian, and from Arabic .

In Serbo-Croatian there are differences in dark brown (), brown ( and ), red (), pink (), and orange (), as well as in blue hues: navy blue (), dark blue (), blue (), and ash blue ().

An interesting case that deviates from this pattern is Irish&#x27;s two words for green:
* denotes the green color of plants
* denotes artificial greens of dyes, paints etc.
This distinction is made even if two shades are identical. is also used for &quot;natural&quot; grays, such as the gray squirrel, .

====Linguistic relativity====

These colors roughly correspond to the sensitivities of the retinal ganglion cells, leading Berlin and Kay to argue that color naming is not merely a cultural phenomenon, but is one that is also constrained by biology—that is, language is shaped by perception. A 2012 study suggested that the origin of this hierarchy may be tied to human vision and the time ordering in which these color names get accepted or agreed upon in a population perfectly matches the order predicted by the hierarchy.

=== Non-hue terms ===
This article mostly describes the color terms that define the &quot;hue&quot; of a color, since hue is considered the most innate dimension of the three. However, other terms are often used to describe the other two dimensions, which can be seen as common prefixes to the root terms that generally describe hue. Adding prefixes to root color terms generates colors. Examples of common prefix adjectives can be seen in a list of color names and are described:
* Brightness: can describe either high luminosity or high saturation, according to the Helmholtz–Kohlrausch effect and/or Hunt effect.
* Lightness: describes both a high luminosity &quot;and&quot; low saturation
* Darkness: the opposite of lightness, or low luminosity
* Paleness, &quot;dullness&quot;: a measure of desaturation
* , Royal: may refer to darkness and/or high saturation; unrelated to color depth.
* Pure, &quot;Bold&quot;, , : all referring to high saturation
* Pastel: refers to colors with high luminosity and low saturation.
* : bright, in either of the word&#x27;s connotations; alluding to the bright glow of neon lighting.
* Fluorescent: very bright, sometimes also highly saturated. Named after the fluorescence effect of pigments and dyes, which can produce a luminous glow when viewed under ultraviolet light, thereby appearing significantly brighter than their surroundings.

=== Non-dimensional terms ===
Other terms sometimes used to describe color are related to physical phenomenon that do not describe a single color, but describe the dynamic nature of an object&#x27;s color. These include:
* Glossy: whether the surface reflects &quot;diffusely&quot; or &quot;specularly&quot; (sharply)
* Metallic: distinguishing &#x27;gold&#x27; and &#x27;silver&#x27; from shades of &#x27;yellow&#x27; and &#x27;gray&#x27;, respectively
* Iridescent: dependence of color on viewing angle, innate to structural coloration
* Opacity: opaque (solid) vs. translucent (transparent or see-through)

=== Abstract and descriptive color terms ===
Color terms can be classified as &quot;abstract&quot; or &quot;descriptive&quot;, though the distinction is often unclear.

Abstract color terms refer only to the color they represent and any etymological link to an object of that color is lost. In English white, black, red, yellow, green, blue, brown, and gray are abstract color terms. These terms are also &quot;basic color terms&quot; (as described above), though other abstract terms like maroon and magenta are not considered basic color terms.

Descriptive color terms are secondarily used to describe a color but primarily refer to an object or phenomenon. &#x27;Salmon&#x27;, &#x27;rose&#x27;, &#x27;saffron&#x27;, and &#x27;lilac&#x27; are descriptive color terms in English because their use as color terms is derived in reference to natural colors of salmon flesh, rose flowers, infusions of saffron pistils, and lilac blossoms respectively.

Abstract color terms in one may be represented by descriptive color terms in another; for example in Japanese pink is (, ) and gray is either or (, , lit. &#x27;ash-color&#x27; for light grays and &#x27;mouse-color&#x27; for dark grays respectively). Nevertheless, as languages evolve they may adopt or invent new abstract color terms, as Japanese has adopted () for pink and () for gray from English.

While most of the 11 basic color terms in English are decidedly abstract, three of them (all stage VII, so understandably the youngest basic color terms) are arguably still descriptive:
* &quot;Pink&quot; was originally a descriptive color term derived from the name of a flower called a &#x27;pink&#x27;. However, because the word &#x27;pink&#x27; is rarely used to refer to the flower anymore, relative to its common usage as a color, it is often regarded as an abstract color term.
* &quot;Purple&quot; is another example of this shift, as it was originally a word that referred to the dye named Tyrian purple, which took its name from the Latin , which referred to both the dye and the sea snail from which the dye was derived. However, this etymological link has been lost in translation.
* &quot;Orange&quot; is difficult to categorize as abstract or descriptive because both its uses, as a color term and as a word for an object, are very common and it is difficult to distinguish which of the two is primary. As a basic color term it became established in the early-to-mid 20th century; before that time artist&#x27;s palettes called it &#x27;yellow-red&#x27;. In English, the use of the word &#x27;orange&#x27; for a fruit predates its use as a color term. The word comes from French , which derives via Arabic () and Sanskrit () from a Dravidian language such as Tamil or Tulu. The derived form &quot;orangish&quot; as a color is attested from the late 19th century by reference to the fruit.

==Struggle in linguistics==

Research on color terms is often conducted without reference to common uses of the term or its significance within the context of its original language. In John A. Lucy&#x27;s article &quot;The linguistics of &#x27;colour″&quot; he identifies two key categories. One of these is &quot;characteristic referential range&quot;, or the use of a color term to identify or differentiate a referent over a wide context.

== Philosophy ==

Color objectivism holds that colors are objective, mind-independent properties of material objects or light sources and that color terms refer to objective reality. Two main forms are color primitivism, which sees colors as simple, irreducible qualities either realist or eliminativist, and color physicalism, which views colors as objective properties that require empirical investigation to understand. Color irrealism, eliminativism or fictionalism denies that material objects and light sources actually possess colors, though eliminativists may describe colors as dispositions or attributes of sensations, as seen in the work of Descartes, Newton, and others. Color dispositionalism sees colors as dispositional properties, existing as powers to cause color experiences in perceivers using the right conditions. Averill&#x27;s radical relationism argues that colors are relational properties. He suggests that the color term &quot;yellow,&quot; for example, is a relational term tied to both populations of normal observers and optimal viewing conditions in specific environments.

For Wittgenstein, in his work Remarks on Colour, any puzzles about color and color terms can only be resolved through attention to the language games involved. He stated that our description of colors are neither fully empirical nor a priori. Statements such as &quot;there cannot be a reddish green&quot; are taken as a part of a logical structure akin to geometry, institing that color-related terms and propositions are rooted in our language practices.

Frank Jackson&#x27;s knowledge argument against physicalism involves a famous thought experiment about Mary, a scientist knowing everything about the physical aspects of color, including physics and terms, but has lived her whole life in a black-and-white room. When Mary leaves the room and experiences color for the first time, she learns what it feels like to see color, i.e., acquires certain qualia while using the color term &quot;red&quot;, suggesting subjective aspects of color experience.

The inverted spectrum argument states that two people could experience different subjective experiences while seeing the same color even when using the same color term &quot;red&quot;. For example, one person might see red as what the other experiences as green, even though they both use the color term &quot;red&quot;.

Hardin addresses the everyday color terms like “red,” “yellow,” “green,” and “blue,” as essential reference points in the study of color. He explores what elements of color are fundamental versus accidental, emphasizing his focus on a core set of colors, including white, black, and gray, while acknowledging a special place for brown in color perception. Peacock explores the relationship between how we conceptualize colors and how we experience them, examining whether color concepts, shaped by language and cognition, align with our subjective experience of color perception. 

For Foster, color constancy refers to the phenomenon where the perceived color of a surface remains stable despite changes in lighting conditions, such as intensity or spectral composition. Txapartegi analyzed how the ancient Greeks understood and categorized color through the concepts of hue, brightness, and saturation, using color terms from classical Greek texts. 

Šekrst and Karlić introduced cognitive convenience, referring to naming of objects of a certain color, for which their hue is not as important as their brightness. For example, in various languages, grapes are described using color terms &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; even though their real hue is usually a certain shade of green or purple. Hansen and Chemla explore whether color adjectives, like &quot;red&quot; or &quot;green,&quot; function as relative or absolute adjectives, using experimental methods instead of informal judgments. Their findings reveal interpersonal variation in how people apply color adjectives, challenging existing theories and highlighting the complexity of scalar adjectives and context sensitivity.

Decock analzyes conceptual change and engineering in the context of color concepts, arguing that in the case of conceptual change of colour concepts varying degrees of optimization, design and control are possible. Krempel investigates whether differences in color terminology across languages lead to differences in color experience, questioning whether language can penetrate and affect perception. She argues that empirical studies do not conclusively support the idea of linguistic penetrability in color experience, even if differences exist between speakers of different languages.

==Standardized systems==
In contrast with the color terms of natural language, systematized color terms also exist. Some examples of color-naming systems are CNS and ISCC–NBS lexicon of color terms. The disadvantage of these systems, however, is that they specify only specific color samples, so while it is possible to, by interpolating, convert any color to or from one of these systems, a lookup table is required. In other words, no simple invertible equation can convert between CIE XYZ and one of these systems.

Philatelists traditionally use names to identify postage stamp colors. While the names are largely standardized within each country, there is no broader agreement, and so for instance the US-published Scott catalogue will use different names than the British Stanley Gibbons catalogue.

On modern computer systems a standard set of basic color terms is now used across the web color names (SVG 1.0/CSS3), HTML color names, X11 color names and the .NET Framework color names, with only a few minor differences.

The Crayola company is famous for its many crayon colors, often creatively named.

Heraldry has standardized names for &#x27;tinctures&#x27;, subdivided into &#x27;colors&#x27;, &#x27;metals&#x27;, and &#x27;furs&#x27;.

<text>Richard Noel &quot;Dick&quot; Richards (born August 24, 1946), (Capt, USN, Ret.), is a retired American naval officer and aviator, test pilot, chemical engineer, and a former NASA astronaut. He flew aboard four Space Shuttle missions in the 1980s and 1990s.

== Early life and education ==
He was born on August 24, 1946, in Key West, Florida, but considers Houston, Texas, to be his hometown. He is married to the former Lois Hollabaugh of Amarillo, Texas. He graduated from Riverview Gardens High School in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1964. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering from the University of Missouri in 1969, and a Master of Science degree in aeronautical systems from the University of West Florida in 1970. While at the University of Missouri, he became a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.

== Military service ==
Richards was commissioned as an Ensign in the United States Navy upon graduating from the University of Missouri in 1969 and was designated a Naval Aviator in August of the following year. From 1970 to 1973, he flew support missions in the A-4 Skyhawk and F-4 Phantom airplanes while assigned to Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 33 (VAQ-33) at Norfolk Naval Air Station, Virginia. He subsequently reported to Fighter Squadron 103 (VF-103), and deployed to the North Atlantic and Mediterranean aboard the aircraft carriers and , flying F-4 airplanes. Selected for test pilot training, he reported to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, in 1976. A tour in the Naval Air Test Center&#x27;s Carrier Systems Branch and F/A-18A Program Office of the Strike Aircraft Test Directorate followed Test Pilot School graduation. Over the next years, Richards served as a project test pilot for automatic carrier landing systems development work in F-4 and A-7 aircraft and also conducted approach/landing/catapult flying qualities and catapult minimum end speed performance testing of a prototype &quot;slatted&quot; F-4S airplane. As carrier suitability project officer for the F/A-18A Hornet airplane, he made the first shipboard catapults and arrested landings during Initial Sea Trials of the F/A-18A on board USS &quot;America&quot; in 1979. He was reassigned to Fighter Squadron 33 (VF-33) in May 1980 and was en route to that assignment when notified of his selection as an astronaut candidate.

== NASA career ==
Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in May 1980, Richards became an astronaut in August 1981. He served as ascent CAPCOM for STS-51F, passing up the &quot;Abort ATO&quot; call when &quot;Challenger&#x27;s&quot; centre engine went down.
Richards flew on four missions: STS-28 (August 8–13, 1989), STS-41 (October 6–10, 1990), STS-50 (June 25 – July 9, 1992), and STS-64 (September 9–20, 1994)--and logged a total of 33 days, 21 hours, 32 minutes, 15 seconds in space. In April 1995, Richards left the Astronaut Office, and was assigned to the Space Shuttle Program Office at the Johnson Space Center. He was designated as the Mission Director/Manager for the second Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Space Shuttle Mission (STS-82), and Mission Manager for the second Tethered Satellite System Space Shuttle mission (STS-75).

=== Spaceflight experience ===

On his first space flight, Richards was pilot on the crew of STS-28 aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 8, 1989. The mission carried Department of Defense payloads and a number of secondary payloads. After 80 orbits of the Earth, this five-day mission concluded with a dry lakebed landing on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on August 13, 1989. Mission duration was 121 hours 9 seconds.
Slightly more than one year later, Richards commanded the crew of STS-41. The five-man crew launched aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; on October 6 from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 10, 1990. During 66 orbits of the Earth, the STS-41 crew successfully deployed the Ulysses spacecraft, starting this interplanetary probe on its four-year journey, via Jupiter, to investigate the polar regions of the Sun.
In June 1992, Richards commanded the crew of STS-50 aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. STS-50 was the first flight of the United States Microgravity Laboratory and the first extended duration Orbiter flight. Over a two-week period, the STS-50 flight crew conducted a wide variety of experiments relating to materials processing and fluid physics in a microgravity environment. At that time this was the longest Space Shuttle flight in history.
In September 1994, Richards commanded the STS-64 crew aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;. Mission highlights included: the first use of a space based laser for environmental research; deployment and retrieval of a spacecraft in support of solar wind and corona studies; robotic processing of semiconductors; maneuvered the robotic arm in proximity to over 100 Shuttle reaction control system jet firings to measure forces imparted to a plume detection instrument in support of future Space Station/Shuttle rendezvous flights; first untethered spacewalk in 10 years to test a self-rescue jetpack. Mission duration was 10 days, 22 hours, 51 minutes.

== Post-NASA career ==
In August 1998, Richards left NASA to join the Boeing Company. Between 1998 and 2007 he supported NASA via Boeing&#x27;s Space Shuttle Sustaining Engineering Support Contract. Boeing has over 1,000 employees across the United States involved with Space Shuttle flight operations. In 2007, Richards retired from Boeing as the Deputy Program Manager for Space Shuttle, and now lives in Houston, Texas.

==Awards and honors==

<doc id="502145" wikidata="Q8563736" url="?curid=502145" title="Flen flyys">
<text>Flen flyys (Middle English: &quot;Fleas (and) flies&quot;) is the colloquial name and first words of an anonymous, untitled poem, written about 1475 or earlier, famous for containing an early written usage in English of the vulgar verb &quot;fuck&quot;. In fact the usage was &quot;fuccant&quot;, a hybrid of an English root with a Latin conjugation, and was disguised in the text by a simple code, in which each letter was replaced with the next letter in the alphabet of the time (so that &quot;fuccant&quot; is written as &quot;gxddbou&quot;).

Written half in English and half in Latin, the poem satirised Carmelite friars in the English county of Cambridgeshire. The poem takes its name from the opening line &quot;Flen, flyys and freris&quot; meaning &quot;fleas, flies and friars&quot;.

The famous line reads &quot;Non sunt in coeli, quia gxddbov xxkxzt pg ifmk.&quot; meaning &quot;They [the friars] are not in heaven, since ...&quot; followed by words that when decoded, taking in account the alphabet of the time (where u and v were interchangeable, as were i and j, and uu represented w), read &quot;fvccant vvivys of heli&quot;, a Latin/English mix that means &quot;...they fuck the wives of Ely&quot; (Ely being a city near Cambridge) as well as being a pun on the word &quot;hell&quot;.

The poem also contains the lines &quot;Fratres cum knyvys goth about and txxkxzv nfookt xxzxkt.&quot; With the last three words decoded in the same way as &quot;svvivyt mennis vvyvis,&quot; it may be translated as &quot;Friars with knives go about and swive (have sex with) men&#x27;s wives.&quot;

The poem is found in British Library, Harley MS 3362, and was first edited in T. Wright &amp; J. O. Halliwell, &quot;Reliquiæ Antiquæ&quot; (1841) 1.91. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (online edition) cites &quot;Flen flyys&quot; in square brackets, since the form &quot;fuccant&quot; is Anglo-Latin and not strictly speaking English.

<text>Phragmites () is a genus of four species of large perennial reed grasses found in wetlands throughout temperate and tropical regions of the world.

==Taxonomy==
The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, maintained by Kew Garden in London, accepts the following four species:
* &quot;Phragmites australis&quot; – The cosmopolitan common reed
* &quot;Phragmites japonicus&quot; – Japan, Korea, Ryukyu Islands, Russian Far East
* &quot;Phragmites karka&quot; – tropical Africa, southern Asia, Australia, some Pacific Islands, invasive in New Zealand
* &quot;Phragmites mauritianus&quot; – central + southern Africa, Madagascar, Mauritius

==Wildlife in reed beds==
&quot;Phragmites&quot; stands can provide food and shelter resources for a number of birds, insects, and other animals. Habitat benefits are often optimal when stands are thinner, and management of stands may promote more suitable habitat benefits. Some evidence suggests that a short term management rotation of 1–2 years could maximize bird and invertebrate numbers.

==Uses==

===Ecosystem Services===
&quot;P. australis&quot; provides ecosystem services such as nutrient sequestration, soil stabilization, and waste treatment. It has been suggested that due to its resilience to climate change impacts, &quot;P. australis&quot; may provide beneficial ecosystem services that need to be considered in coastal ecosystems, even where it is considered an invasive species. Others have argued that the ecosystem services lost as a result of invasion outweigh the benefits gained and managers need to be responsive to invasion control.

===Cultivation===
&quot;P. australis&quot; is cultivated as an ornamental plant in aquatic and marginal settings such as pond- and lakesides. Its aggressive colonisation means it must be sited with care.

===Phytoremediation water treatment===

&quot;Phragmites australis&quot; is one of the main wetland plant species used for phytoremediation water treatment.

Waste water from lavatories and greywater from kitchens is routed to an underground septic tank-like compartment where the solid waste is allowed to settle out. The water then trickles through a constructed wetland or artificial reed bed, where bioremediation bacterial action on the surface of roots and leaf litter removes some of the nutrients in biotransformation. The water is then suitable for irrigation, groundwater recharge, or release to natural watercourses.

===Thatching===

Reed is used in many areas for thatching roofs. In the British Isles, common reed used for this purpose is known as Norfolk reed or water reed. However, &quot;wheat reed&quot; and &quot;Devon reed&quot;, also used for thatching, are not in fact reed, but long-stemmed wheat straw.

===Music===
In Middle East countries &quot;Phragmites&quot; is used to create a small instrument similar to the clarinet called a sipsi, with either a single, as in the picture, or double pipes as in bagpipes. The reed of the zurna is made from the common reed which is flattened after removing its brittle outer glaze and the loose inner membrane, and after softening it by wetting. The result is a double reed with an elliptical opening that vibrates by closing and opening at a high speed. This is not to be confused with other double reeds like that of the oboe which uses two reeds made from the giant reed leaning against each other.

===Food===
The leaves, roots, seeds and stems of phragmites are edible. Young shoots can be cooked or eaten raw just like bamboo shoots. The young stems, &quot;while still green and fleshy, can be dried and pounded into a fine powder, which when moistened is roasted like marshmallows.&quot; The seeds and rhizomes &quot;can be ground into flour or made into gruel.&quot; In Japan, young leaves are dried, ground, and then mixed with cereal flour to make dumplings. Grazing on phragmites by large-bodied domestic herbivores, such as cows, horses, sheep, and goats, can effectively control the plant and provide a reciprocal positive benefit for humans by generating meat, milk, leather, and wool etc.

===Other uses===
Some other uses for &quot;Phragmites australis&quot; and other reeds in various cultures include baskets, mats, reed pen tips (qalam), and paper. Beekeepers can utilize the reeds to make nesting.

In the Philippines, &quot;Phragmites&quot; is known by the local name &quot;tambo&quot;. Reed stands flower in December, and the blooms are harvested and bundled into whisk brooms called &quot;walis&quot;. Hence the common name of household brooms is &quot;walis tambo&quot;.

Reeds have been used to make arrows and weapons such as spears for hunting game.

== Invasiveness and control ==
Some &quot;Phragmites&quot;, when introduced by accident or intent, spread rapidly. In tropics and subtropics, &quot;Phragmites karka&quot; is an abundant invasive species. In the United States, prior to 1910, only a few areas in the Northeast contained non-native haplotypes of &quot;Phragmites australis.&quot; However, by 1960 non-native haplotypes were found in samples taken from coast to coast. Today, in some places like Michigan, &quot;Phragmites australis (haplotype M)&quot; has become the dominant haplotype. The problem is invasive non-native &quot;Phragmites australis&quot; quickly spread through marshes and wetland areas. They replace native plants, deny fish and wildlife nutrients and space; block access to the water for swimming, fishing and other recreation endeavors; spoil shoreline views; and pose a fire hazard. &quot;Phragmites&quot; also alters wetland biogeochemistry and affects both floral and faunal species assemblages, including potentially reducing nitrogen and phosphorus availability for other plants.

&quot;Phragmites&quot; can drive out competing vegetation in two main ways. Their sheer height and density can deprive other plants of sunlight and the chemicals they produce when decaying reduce the germination of competing seeds. Among other effects, the monocultures that result from invasion decrease spatial and temporal habitat heterogeneity and increase avian homogeneity.

Recognizing the non-native form of &quot;Phragmites&quot; early in its invasion increases the opportunity for successful eradication dramatically. Once it has become established, removal by hand is nearly impossible. The seeds or rhizomes can quickly lead to a new dense stand. Chemical treatment is by far the most utilized method in North America. The two most common active ingredients in herbicides for &quot;Phragmites&quot; control are glyphosate and imazapyr. It is important to select the proper herbicide for the location. Further, even the proper herbicide can lead to unintended consequences since a large amount of decaying dead plant material can depress oxygen levels in the water and kill all the fish in a pond or small lake. Some success has also been obtained using goats to graze on &quot;Phragmites&quot;, controlled burns, and native wild rice crops. Biological controls have been suggested to be the most likely control method to succeed and biocontrols have been approved for introduction in North America Unfortunately, biocontrols may destroy the native subspecies population as well. When cutting under water, cutting and then flooding, or burning and then flooding, it is important that the entire &quot;Phragmites&quot; stand is completely submerged so that the plants cannot obtain oxygen.

Biocontrol using two species of moth larvae (Lenisa geminipuncta and Archanara neurica) is being investigated in Ontario.

<text>Otto Kaiser (30 November 1924 – 14 December 2017) was a German Old Testament scholar.

==Biography==

===Education===
Kaiser was born in Prenzlau, Germany, where he attended the Gymnasium in Eberswalde and went to the University of Berlin to study medicine, as well as philosophy with Nicolai Hartmann. He served in World War II on the Eastern Front and was wounded. Returning, he studied Protestant theology and Oriental Studies and Philosophy at the University of Tübingen. He received his Doctor of Divinity degree in 1961 and his habilitation less than a year later. He holds honorary doctorates from the University of Jena, the University of Tartu, and the University of Salzburg, as well as the Bundesverdienstkreuz 1st Class.

===Career===
Called to a professorship at the University of Marburg, the oldest Protestant university in the world with one of the most distinguished Divinity Schools in Germany, he soon received the main Chair of Old Testament, which, in spite of many calls to other universities, he held until his retirement. Kaiser&#x27;s work stands in the tradition of Rudolf Bultmann; he sees theology as &quot;the study of the human reflection of the experience of the Divine in time and space.&quot; He has written a complete, three-volume theology of the Old Testament, as well as the leading one- and three-volume introductions into Old Testament Studies in German; among his many special areas are the Book of Job, Ecclesiastes, the Apocrypha, and Sirach. Kaiser is also a leading scholar on ancient and modern philosophy, particularly on Kant, Hegel, and toward the end of his career, Nietzsche, Plato, and Aristotle.

<doc id="502166" wikidata="Q1368326" url="?curid=502166" title="Esplanade de La Défense station">
<text>Esplanade de La Défense () is a station on Paris Métro Line 1 on the outskirts of La Défense on the border of Courbevoie and Puteaux. It has an island platform because of limitations on space due it being enclosed in a site originally earmarked for one of the underpasses of the A14 autoroute (which runs through La Défense underground).

== History ==
The station was opened on 1 April 1992 as part of the western extension of the line from Pont de Neuilly to La Défense. The project name was Puteaux - Courbevoie.

The RATP having preferred an open-air passage on the Neuilly bridge, less expensive, rather than a tunnel under the Seine, with the station La Défense - Michelet, planned since the 1970s by the EPAD, remained unused.

As part of the automation work on line 1, the Esplanade de la Défense station was equipped with platform screen doors during October 2009.

In 2019, according to RATP estimates, 9,883,008 passengers entered this station, which places it in the 17th position of metro stations for its usage out of 302.

In 2020, with the Covid-19 crisis, 4,488,878 passengers entered this station which places it in the 24th position of metro stations for its attendance.

In 2021, attendance gradually increases, with 4,708,183 passengers entering this station which places it in the 43rd position of metro stations for its attendance.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two accesses:
* west exit gives access to the Vosges, Alsace, Corolles, Reflets and Iris districts of the &quot;Esplanade Nord&quot; sector and to the Michelet and Villon districts of the &quot;Esplanade Sud&quot; sector;
* the east exit gives access to the Saisons district of the &quot;Esplanade Nord&quot; sector and to the Bellini district of the &quot;Esplanade Sud&quot; sector.

===Station layout===

===Platforms===
The station has a central platform due to the small width of the station, which was built in what was originally to be one of the two tubes of the A14 autoroute (which passes through a tunnel under The Defence). A slight difference in width also exists between the western end of the platform, through which access is made, and the eastern one, narrower and under a lower ceiling covered with a black fireproof flocking. Lighting is provided by fluorescent tubes. Large white flat tiles cover the vertical walls. The advertising frames are metallic and the name of the station is inscribed in Parisine font on enamelled plates arranged only on the platform. The latter is equipped with yellow &quot;Akiko&quot; seats and platform screen doors.
===Bus connections===
The station is served by bus lines 73, 157, 158, 174, 175 and 176 of the RATP Bus Network and by line N24 of the Noctilien night bus service.

==Nearby==
In the courtyard entrance to this station and in the corridors of it, statues have been erected. At the end of the platform, in the direction of Paris, the station is almost open-air. It allows you to see the Arc de Triomphe and is visible from the bus station at the Pont de Neuilly metro station. The cultural and exhibition space Defacto la Gallery, opened in September 2008, is located at the eastern exit of the station. The station gives access to the Tour First, and the Tour CB21 and Allianz One towers.

<text>STS-52 was a NASA Space Shuttle mission using Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, launched on October 22, 1992.

== Crew ==

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission highlights ==
Primary mission objectives were deployment of the Laser Geodynamics Satellite 2 (LAGEOS-2) and operation of the U.S. Microgravity Payload-1 (USMP-1). LAGEOS 2, a joint effort between NASA and the Italian Space Agency (ASI), was deployed on day 2 and boosted into an initial elliptical orbit by ASI&#x27;s Italian Research Interim Stage (IRIS). The spacecraft&#x27;s apogee kick motor later circularized LAGEOS 2 orbit at its operational altitude of . The USMP-1, activated on day one, included three experiments mounted on two connected Mission Peculiar Equipment Support Structures (MPESS) mounted in the orbiter&#x27;s cargo bay. USMP-1 experiments were: Lambda Point Experiment; Matériel pour l&#x27;Étude des Phénomènes Intéressant la Solidification sur eT en Orbite (MEPHISTO), sponsored by the French agency Centre National d&#x27;Études Spatiales (CNES); and Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS).

Secondary payloads: (1) Canadian experiment (CANEX-2), located in both the orbiter&#x27;s cargo bay and middeck and which consisted of Space Vision System (SVS); Materials Exposure in Low-Earth Orbit (MELEO); Queen&#x27;s University Experiment in Liquid-Metal Diffusion (QUELD); Phase Partitioning in Liquids (PARLIQ); Sun Photospectrometre Earth Atmosphere Measurement-2 (SPEAM-2); Orbiter Glow-2 (OGLOW-2); and Space Adaptation Tests and Observations (SATO). A small, specially marked satellite, the Canadian Target Assembly (CTA), was deployed on day nine, to support SVS experiments. (2) ASP, featuring three independent sensors mounted on a Hitchhiker plate in the cargo bay – Modular Star Sensor (MOSS), Yaw Earth Sensor (YES) and Low Altitude Conical Earth Sensor (LACES), all provided by the European Space Agency (ESA).

Other middeck payloads: Commercial Materials Dispersion Apparatus Instrument Technology Associates Experiments; Commercial Protein Crystal Growth experiment; Chemical Vapor Transport Experiment Heat Pipe Performance Experiment (CVTEHPPE); Physiological Systems Experiment (PSE) (involving 12 rodents); and Shuttle Plume Impingement Experiment (SPIE). The orbiter also was used as a reference point for calibrating an Ultraviolet Plume Instrument on an orbiting Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) satellite.

The Tank Pressure Control Experiment/Thermal Phenomena (TPCE/TP) was contained in a Getaway Special (GAS) canister in the orbiter&#x27;s cargo bay.

Some of the ashes of &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry were also carried aboard the orbiter for the duration of the mission.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. A special musical track is chosen for each day in space, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, to have a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or in reference to the day&#x27;s planned activities.

<doc id="502168" wikidata="Q1344555" url="?curid=502168" title="Pont de Neuilly station">
<text>Pont de Neuilly () is a station on Paris Métro Line 1, situated in the prosperous suburban commune of Neuilly-sur-Seine. Between 1940 and 1950 it was known as &quot;Pont de Neuilly, Avenue de Madrid&quot;.

==Location==
The station is located under Avenue Charles-de-Gaulle (RN 13) at its intersection with Avenue de Madrid. Oriented approximately along a north-west/south-east axis, it is situated between the &quot;Esplanade de la Défense&quot; and &quot;Les Sablons&quot; metro stations, separated from the former by an above-ground crossing of the Seine river in the centre of the Pont de Neuilly bridge, with a grade of 6%, the steepest in the network. In the direction of La Défense, it is the last classic station available on this part of the line.

It is named after the Pont de Neuilly, a nearby bridge. The bridge - which carries parallel road and rail links between Neuilly and La Défense, over the river Seine - is in fact nearer to the Esplanade de la Défense metro station than to the Pont de Neuilly metro station.

It was the western terminus of Line 1 from 1937 until 1992, before the western extension to La Défense metro was opened. Above the station lies an esplanade from which one can see the area of La Défense.

==History==
The station was opened on 29 April 1937 as the western terminus of line 1 from Château de Vincennes, replacing the original terminus at Porte Maillot. It owes its name to its relative proximity to the Neuilly bridge, linking Neuilly-sur-Seine on the right bank of the Seine to the communes of Courbevoie and Puteaux on the left bank, in line with the historic Parisian axis. The station was named Pont de Neuilly - Avenue de Madrid from 1940 to 1950 to highlight its location at the intersection of the Avenue de Madrid, which takes its name from the capital of Spain.

The station was modernized after 1988 by the adoption of the decorative style &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; on the platforms, green in this case.

On 1 April 1992, it became a transit station with the inauguration of the extension to Grande Arche de la Défense (now La Défense). This extension required the complete takeover of the rear station in order to allow the passage of the line on the Pont d Neuillyy, the basement constrained at that time by the presence of the tunnel of RER A line, built during the 1960s.

As part of the automation of line 1, the platforms were raised to accommodate platform screen doors, installed between mid-June and mid-July 2009, making this station the second on the line to benefit from these doors after Bérault.

In 2019, according to RATP estimates, 6,902,027 passengers entered this station, which places it in the 41st position of metro stations for its usage out of 302. In the same year, the docks lost their asphalt pavement to dark tiles.

In 2020, with the Covid-19 crisis, 3,678,074 passengers entered this station, which places it in the 36th position of metro stations for its usage.

In 2021, attendance gradually increases, with 4,822,599 passengers entering this station which places it in the 41st position of metro stations for its usage.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has three entrances divided into six metro accesses, established on the side medians of Avenue Charles-de-Gaulle:
* Access no. 1 &quot;Rue du Château&quot;: two fixed stairs, one decorated with a mast with a yellow &quot;M&quot; inscribed in a circle, leading to no. 168 of the avenue;
* Access no. 2 &quot;Avenue de Madrid&quot;: a fixed staircase to the right of no. 205 Avenue Charles-de-Gaulle and an escalator facing Nos. 203 and 203 bis;
* Access no. 3 &quot;Rue de l&#x27;Église&quot;: a fixed staircase with a yellow totem &quot;M&quot; leading to the right of no. 185 Avenue Charles-de-Gaulle and an escalator going up to the Église Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Neuilly-sur-Seine at no. 158.

Each stair hopper has the particularity, treated in flat brown tiles laid vertically and aligned.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Pont de Neuilly is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms, 105 meters long, separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is in the &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; green style. The lighting canopies, of the same colour, are supported by curved braces in the shape of a scythe. The direct lighting is white as well as, unlike most light canopies of this style, indirect lighting. The white ceramic tiles are flat and cover the walls, vault, tunnel exits and outlets of the corridors. The advertising frames are green and cylindrical and the name of the station is inscribed in Parisine font on enamelled plates. The platforms are tiled in anthracite grey and equipped with green &quot;Motte&quot; style shell seats as well platform screen doors.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by bus lines 43, 73, 93, 157, 158, 174 and 176 of the RATP Bus Network and by lines N11, N24 and N153 of the Noctilien night bus service.

Some of these lines terminate at the bus station overlooking the station; this space is extended to the northwest by an esplanade from which emerges a view of the business district of La Défense.

<text>Lake Thun () is an Alpine lake in the Bernese Oberland in Switzerland named after the city of Thun, on its northern shore. At in surface area, it is the largest Swiss lake entirely within a single canton.

The lake was created after the last glacial period. After the 10th century, it split from Lake Brienz, before which the two lakes were combined, as &quot;Wendelsee&quot; (&quot;Lake Wendel&quot;). The culminating point of the lake&#x27;s drainage basin is the Finsteraarhorn at above sea level.

Lake Thun&#x27;s approximate catchment area frequently causes local flooding after heavy rainfalls. This occurs because the river Aare (), which drains Lake Thun, has only limited capacity to handle the excess runoff. The lake is fed by water from Lake Brienz to the southeast, which is higher than Lake Thun, and various streams in the Oberland, including the Kander.

In 1835, passenger steamships began operating regularly on the lake. Ten passenger ships, operated by the local railway company BLS AG like , serve the towns of Interlaken and Thun; the Interlaken ship canal and Thun ship canal connect the lake to Interlaken West railway station and Thun railway station respectively.

Following World War II and up until 1964, the Swiss Government disposed of unused munitions into Lake Thun. The quantity of munitions dumped is reported to be from 3,000 to more than 9,020 tons.

<text>Les Sablons () is a station on Line 1 of the Paris Métro in the commune of Neuilly-sur-Seine west of the city. In 2019 Les Sablons ranked 53rd in passenger volume among the system&#x27;s 302 stations. The station is located under Avenue Charles de Gaulle, a major traffic artery between Etoile and La Defense. It has four entrances, a pair located on each of the medians on opposite sides of the Avenue.

The name of the station was taken from the Boulevard des Sablons which connects the station area with the northern entrance to the Bois de Boulogne.  The name of the Boulevard derived from the Plaine des Sablons, as much of present-day Neuilly was known prior to its urbanization.  The station signage is subtitled &quot;Jardin d&#x27;Acclimatation,&quot; referring to the leisure park in the Bois de Boulogne 300 meters to the south. 

== History ==
The station opened in April 1937, when Line 1 of the Paris Metro was extended west from Porte Maillot to Pont de Neuilly under Neuilly&#x27;s principal commercial thoroughfare, the Avenue de Neuilly (renamed Avenue Charles de Gaulle in 1971). At the same time, the Avenue was significantly widened to serve as an arterial route for automobile traffic, and the project marked the end of the Fête de Neuilly, a summer street carnival held for over a century in what had become a well-heeled urban district. Initial planning in the early 1930s envisaged two stations between Porte Maillot and Pont de Neuilly, at Place du Marché and Rue St. Pierre, but Les Sablons was built instead. Work on the Line 1 extension was pressed to completion in time for the 1937 International Exposition. In the 1970s the station was remodeled in the style Andreu-Motte. In 2003, the corridors were remodeled as part of a system-wide program. In 2009, the platforms were fitted with platform screen doors in anticipation of the fully-automated operation of Line 1.

Prior to its urbanization, much of the area immediately to the north of the Bois de Boulogne was known as the Plaine des Sablons, for its sterile soil and sand pits whose output was much used in the construction of Paris. In the 1780s, Louis XVI granted part of the Champs des Sablons, an area used for training by the King&#x27;s Guards, to Antoine-Augustin Parmentier, who demonstrated the growing of potatoes, and promoted their acceptance in continental Europe as safe for human consumption. During the 19th century, this rural area gave way to suburban, then urban, development.

The Jardin d&#x27;Acclimatation opened in 1860 on 20 hectares in the northwest corner of the Bois de Boulogne, as a feature in the transformation of the Bois from public woodlands into an urban park. The Jardin was initially a zoo and botanical garden emphasizing species from tropical and sub-tropical regions. From 1877 to 1927 it also included an &quot;ethnological garden&quot;, a human zoo featuring the physiques and cultures of non-European indigenous peoples. After 1910, there was increased focus on carnival rides and entertainments, following the example of Copenhagen&#x27;s Tivoli Gardens. These, in turn, were displaced in the 1950s in favor of an area &quot;for walks and outdoor activities of an instructional, sporting, and family nature&quot;, and in the 1960s and &#x27;70s the Jardin featured popular, rural, and traditional French culture. In recent years, amusements and wild animals have returned to what is now a family-oriented leisure park, focusing on children&#x27;s activities. The original name has never changed.

<text>Joseph Percival &quot;Joe&quot; Allen IV (born June 27, 1937) is an American former NASA astronaut. He logged more than 3,000 hours flying time in jet aircraft.

==Early life and education==
Allen was born in Crawfordsville, Indiana, in June 1937. His parents, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph P. Allen III, had resided in Frankfort, Indiana. He attended Mills School, and is a graduate of Crawfordsville High School in Indiana, Class of 1955; received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics and Physics from DePauw University in 1959, where he was a member of Delta chapter of Beta Theta Pi, and a Master of Science and a Doctor of Philosophy degrees in Physics from Yale University in 1961 and 1965, respectively. At Yale, Allen worked with future physicist Richard F. Casten.

Allen was a research associate in the Nuclear Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington prior to his selection as an astronaut. He was a staff physicist at the Nuclear Structure Laboratory at Yale University in 1965 and 1966, and during the period 1963 to 1967, served as a guest researcher at Brookhaven National Laboratory

==NASA experience==
Allen was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in August 1967 as a member of the second group of scientist-astronauts. He completed flight training at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma. He served as mission scientist while a member of the astronaut support crew for Apollo 15 and served as a staff consultant on science and technology to the President&#x27;s Council on International Economic Policy.

From August 1975 to 1978, Allen served as NASA Assistant Administrator for Legislative Affairs in Washington, D.C. Returning to the Johnson Space Center in 1978, as a senior scientist astronaut, Allen was assigned to the Operations Mission Development Group. He served as a support crew member for the first orbital flight test of the Space Shuttle (&quot;Columbia&quot;) in April 1981 and was the CAPCOM during the reentry phase for this mission. In addition, in 1980 and 1981, he worked as the technical assistant to the director of flight operations.

==Space experience==

Allen served as mission specialist on STS-5, the first fully operational flight of the Space Shuttle program, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 11, 1982. He was accompanied by Vance D. Brand (spacecraft commander), Col. Robert F. Overmyer (pilot), and Dr. William B. Lenoir (mission specialist). STS-5, the first mission with four crewmembers, clearly demonstrated the Space Shuttle as fully operational by the successful first deployment of two commercial communications satellites from the Orbiter&#x27;s payload bay. The mission marked the first use of the Payload Assist Module (PAM-D), and its new ejection system. Numerous flight tests were performed throughout the mission to document Shuttle performance during launch, boost, orbit, atmospheric entry and landing phases. STS-5 was the last flight to carry the Development Flight Instrumentation (DFI) package to support flight testing. A Getaway Special, three Student Involvement Projects, and medical experiments were included on the mission. A planned spacewalk by Allen and Lenoir, the first of the Space Shuttle program, was postponed by one day after Lenoir became ill, and then had to be canceled when the two spacesuits that were to be used developed problems. The STS-5 crew successfully concluded the 5-day orbital flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; with the first entry and landing through a cloud deck to a hard-surface runway and demonstrated maximum braking. STS-5 completed 81 orbits of the Earth in 122 hours before landing on a concrete runway at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on November 16, 1982.
Allen was a mission specialist on STS 51-A, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 8, 1984. He was accompanied by Captain Frederick (Rick) Hauck (spacecraft commander), Captain David M. Walker (pilot), and fellow mission specialists, Dr. Anna Lee Fisher and Commander Dale Gardner. This was the second flight of the Orbiter &quot;Discovery&quot;. During the mission the crew deployed two satellites, Canada&#x27;s Anik D-2 (Telesat H) and Hughes&#x27; LEASAT-1 (Syncom IV-1), and operated the 3M Company&#x27;s Diffusive Mixing of Organic Solutions experiment. In the first space salvage attempt in history, Allen and Gardner performed spacewalks and successfully retrieved for return to Earth the Palapa B-2 and Westar VI communications satellites. STS 51-A completed 127 orbits of the Earth in 192 hours before landing at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 16, 1984. With the completion of this flight Allen logged a total of 314 hours in space.

==Post-NASA experience==
Allen served as chief executive officer of Space Industries International, Washington, D.C., and later was chairman of Veridian, until he retired in 2004. General Dynamics announced its acquisition of Veridian on June 9, 2003.

In the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, Allen was played by Doug McKeon.

In the 1998 movie &quot;Armageddon&quot;, directed by Michael Bay, Allen served as a NASA consultant and cameoed as &quot;Kennedy Launch&quot; during the launching of the X-71 shuttles.

==Personal life==
Allen married Bonnie Jo Darling of Elkhart, Indiana in 1961. They have two children. Bonnie Darling died in early 2021.

==Works==
*&quot;Entering Space: An Astronaut&#x27;s Odyssey&quot; (1985) 

Allen was a contributor to the book &quot;NASA&#x27;s Scientist-Astronauts&quot; by David Shayler and Colin Burgess.

==Organizations==
Allen is a member of several organizations, including the American Physical Society, the American Astronautical Society, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Phi Beta Kappa, Beta Theta Pi, Sigma Xi, and Phi Eta Sigma.

<doc id="502183" wikidata="Q7804848" url="?curid=502183" title="TimeChase">
<text>TimeChase was a history-based quiz show series created by Sidney M. Cohen and Jay R. Cohen originally telecast on Canada&#x27;s History Television channel.

Hosted by Sheldon Turcott, it featured questions based on decades in history. It was produced and directed by Sidney M. Cohen. The show ran from 1997 to 1999, and emcee Turcott died shortly after its cancellation. &quot;TimeChase&quot; was later rerun on GameTV from 2007 to 2011. Catherine Swing served as announcer during the show&#x27;s first season.

==Round 1==
Three contestants compete in this game. One of them was a returning champion.
Sheldon announces six decades which act as categories. One decade is a timechase mystery category which remains a secret until it is chosen. The champion picks a decade and then Sheldon reads a question with three choices. The first player to ring in gets to answer. If he/she is right, they get 10 points. If they are wrong, the remaining players will have a choice from the remaining answers (although if the 2nd player is also wrong the 3rd player does not get to answer). 4 questions are in each category. After the category is gone, the player with the last correct answer picks from the remaining categories. The round ends when time runs out. There was no mystery decade during season 2.

==Round 2: Double or Nothing==
This round was almost the same as the first round. There were 6 more decades (5 in Season 2), but now those decades were all about a certain topic. In Season 1, there was another mystery decade and was only revealed if chosen. Correct answers were worth 20 points and the player had to decide whether or not to answer a follow-up question for another 20 points. A wrong answer takes those points away. The round ends when time runs out or all decades have been covered. The player who with the most points wins a prize and moved on to the Bonus Round.

==Bonus Round==
Sheldon reveals a topic and the winning contestant has to answer 5 questions. The first question is worth $25, the second, $50, the third, $75, the fourth, $100, and the fifth and final question is worth $250 for a total of $500. If the player answers them all right, he/she wins another prize. The player can stop anytime, but an incorrect answer along the way loses everything, but if there were any questions left, they would be worth $25 each. In any case, the champion comes back next time. Champions can stay for as many as 5 shows. If they make it that far, they win a cruise on the Saint Lawrence River.

<doc id="502185" wikidata="Q275068" url="?curid=502185" title="Broth">
<text>Broth, also known as bouillon (), is a savory liquid made of water in which meat, fish, or vegetables have been simmered for a short period of time. It can be eaten alone, but it is most commonly used to prepare other dishes, such as soups, gravies, and sauces.

Commercially prepared liquid broths are available, typically chicken, beef, fish, and vegetable varieties. Dehydrated broth in the form of bouillon cubes was commercialized beginning in the early 20th century.

== Stock versus broth ==

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
Many cooks and food writers use the terms &quot;broth&quot; and &quot;stock&quot; interchangeably. In 1974, James Beard (an American cook) wrote that stock, broth, and bouillon &quot;are all the same thing&quot;.

While many draw a distinction between stock and broth, the details of the distinction often differ. One possibility is that stocks are made primarily from animal bones, as opposed to meat, and therefore contain more gelatin, giving them a thicker texture. Another distinction that is sometimes made is that stock is cooked longer than broth and therefore has a more intense flavor. A third possible distinction is that stock is left unseasoned for use in other recipes, while broth is salted and otherwise seasoned and can be eaten alone.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Similar dishes==
Not every dish with the word &quot;broth&quot; in its name is, strictly speaking, a broth. For example, Aberaeron Broth is a Welsh soup. Scotch broth is a soup which includes solid pieces of meat and vegetables. Its name reflects an older usage of the term &quot;broth&quot; that did not distinguish between the complete soup and its liquid component. Similarly, Awara broth is a Guianan Creole stew from French Guiana.

Court-bouillon (French for &quot;short broth&quot;) is a broth cooked for a short time, mostly used for poaching fish. Rosół is a category of clear Polish soups, primarily made of broth, with a popular version being similar to chicken noodle soup. Canja de galinha is a similar soup from Portuguese-speaking countries.

<text>Dale Allan Gardner (November 8, 1948 – February 19, 2014) was a NASA astronaut, and naval flight officer who flew two Space Shuttle missions during the mid 1980s.

== Personal information ==
Born on November 8, 1948, in Fairmont, Minnesota, Gardner grew up in Sherburn, Minnesota, and Savanna, Illinois. He considered his hometown to be Clinton, Iowa, where his mother, Alice Gardner, resides. He lived with his second wife Sherry in Golden, Colorado and later in Divide, Colorado until his death. An avid sports enthusiast, he enjoyed snow skiing, golfing, tennis, woodworking and photography.

== Education ==
Gardner graduated as valedictorian of his class from Savanna Community High School, in Savanna, Illinois, in 1966. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering Physics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1970.

== Military experience ==
Upon graduation from the University of Illinois in 1970, Gardner entered into active duty with the United States Navy and was assigned to the Aviation Officer Candidate School at Pensacola, Florida. He was commissioned an Ensign and was selected as the most promising naval officer from his class. In October 1970 he began Basic Naval Flight Officer training with the VT-10 squadron at Pensacola, graduating with the highest academic average ever achieved in the history of the squadron. He proceeded to the Naval Air Technical Training Center at NAS Glynco, Georgia, for Advanced Naval Flight Officer training and was selected a Distinguished Naval Graduate and awarded his Naval Flight Officer wings on May 5, 1971. At the Naval Air Test Center at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, from May 1971 to July 1973, he was assigned to the Weapons Systems Test Division and involved in initial F-14 Tomcat developmental test and evaluation as Project Officer for Inertial Navigation and Avionics Systems. Gardner&#x27;s next assignment was with the first operational F-14 squadron (VF-1) at Naval Air Station Miramar, California, from where he flew in the Tomcat and participated in two Western Pacific and Indian Ocean cruises while deployed aboard the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;. From December 1976 until July 1978, he was assigned to Test and Evaluation Squadron 4 (VX-4) aboard NAS Point Mugu, California, involved in the operational test and evaluation of Navy fighter aircraft.

== NASA experience ==
Gardner was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in January 1978, reporting to the Johnson Space Center in July 1978. In August 1979 he completed a one-year training and evaluation period, making him eligible for assignment as a Mission Specialist Astronaut. He subsequently served as the Astronaut Project Manager for the flight software in the Space Shuttle onboard computers leading up to the first flight in April 1981. He then served as a Support Crew Astronaut for the fourth flight (STS-4). He flew as a mission specialist on STS-8 (August 30 to September 5, 1983) and STS-51-A (November 8–16, 1984). Gardner logged a total of 337 hours in space and 225 orbits of the Earth on these two flights.

He logged more than 2,300 hours flying time in over 20 different types of aircraft and spacecraft. Prior to the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident, Gardner was chosen to be a member of the first Shuttle mission to launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. That flight and the Vandenberg launch capability itself were canceled after the accident.

In October 1986, following 8½ years with NASA, Gardner returned to his Navy duties and was assigned to the U.S. Space Command, Colorado Springs, Colorado. He served over two years as the Deputy Chief, Space Control Operations Division in Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station and, after promotion to the rank of captain in June 1989, became the Command&#x27;s Deputy Director for Space Control at Peterson Air Force Base. His space control responsibilities included the surveillance and tracking of all man-made objects in Earth orbit and the protection of U.S. and allied space systems. Gardner retired from the U.S. Navy in October 1990 and accepted a position with TRW Inc. in Colorado Springs, being placed as a program manager in the Colorado Springs Engineering Operations of TRW&#x27;s Space and Defense Sector. In that capacity, he was involved in the development of both civilian and military space and defense high technology programs. After TRW, he became the manager of Northrop Grumman&#x27;s operations in Colorado Springs. Gardner became the Associate Director for Renewable Fuels Science and Technology at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in 2003, and retired in January 2013.

=== Space flight experience ===
STS-8 launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida on August 30, 1983. The crew aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; included Richard Truly (Spacecraft Commander), Daniel Brandenstein (Pilot), and fellow Mission Specialists Guion Bluford and William Thornton. This was the third flight of the Orbiter &quot;Challenger&quot; and the first night launch and landing mission of the Shuttle program. During the flight, the crew of STS-8 deployed the Indian National Satellite (INSAT-1B), operated and tested the Canadian-built Remote Manipulator System (RMS) robot arm, and performed numerous earth resources and space science experiments. STS-8 completed 98 Earth orbits in 145 hours before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California on September 5, 1983.
STS-51-A, the fourteenth flight of the Shuttle program, launched on November 8, 1984 (his birthday). The crew aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; included Frederick Hauck (Spacecraft Commander), David Walker (Pilot), and fellow Mission Specialists Joseph Allen and Anna Fisher. This was the second flight of &quot;Discovery&quot;. During this mission the crew deployed two satellites, Canada&#x27;s Anik D-2 (TELESAT-H) and the Hughes&#x27; LEASAT-1 (Syncom IV-1), now in service with the U.S. Navy. In a dramatic salvage effort, they also rendezvoused with and returned from space two satellites previously launched into improper orbits, the Indonesian Palapa B-2 and the Western Union Westar VI communication satellites. Gardner and Allen completed two spacewalks totaling 12 hours and flew the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) backpack during the salvage operation. STS-51-A completed 127 orbits of the Earth before landing at the Kennedy Space Center on November 16, 1984.

== Organizations ==
Gardner was a Member of Phi Eta Sigma, Sigma Tau, and Tau Beta Pi, and a fellow of the American Astronautical Society.

== Special honors ==
Gardner was awarded the Defense Superior Service Medal (1984, 1989, 1990); the Distinguished Flying Cross (1989); the Meritorious Unit Commendation (1976); the Humanitarian Service Medal (1979) and the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon (1984). His other honors included the NASA Space Flight Medal (1983 and 1984); the Master Space Badge (1989); and the Lloyd&#x27;s of London Meritorious Service Medal (1984).

A bridge connecting Savanna, Illinois &amp; Sabula, Iowa over the Mississippi River was built through interstate collaboration in dedication to Dale Gardner and US Veterans in November 2017 as the Dale Gardner Veterans Memorial Bridge. This new $80.6 million bridge was constructed as a replacement to the 86 year old Savanna-Sabula Bridge.

== Death ==
Gardner died on February 19, 2014, after suffering a hemorrhagic stroke at his home. He was 65.

<doc id="502193" wikidata="Q10632357" url="?curid=502193" title="Pistis">
<text>In Greek mythology, Pistis (; Ancient Greek: Πίστις) was the personification of good faith, trust and reliability. In Christianity and in the New Testament, &quot;pistis&quot; is typically translated as &quot;faith&quot;. The word is mentioned together with such other personifications as &quot;Elpis&quot; (Hope), &quot;sophrosyne&quot; (Prudence), and the &quot;Charites&quot;, who were all associated with honesty and harmony among people.

Her Roman equivalent was &quot;Fides&quot;, a personified concept significant in Roman culture.

Additionally, a close linkage between &quot;pistis&quot; and persuasion developed through the discussion of faith (belief) and was further morphed by an understanding of &quot;pistis&quot; as a rhetorical technique.

==In rhetoric==

&quot;Pistis&quot; in rhetoric can mean &quot;proof&quot; and is the element to induce true judgment through enthymemes, hence to give &quot;proof&quot; of a statement. There are three modes by which this is employed. The first mode is the &quot;subject matter capable of inducing a state of mind within the audience.&quot; The second &quot;pistis&quot; is the &quot;subject itself considered under an appeal to the intellect or in its logical aspects.&quot; The third &quot;pistis&quot; is the &quot;logical, rational, and intellectual aspect of the issue under discussion.&quot; All three modes of &quot;pistis&quot; occur in logos as it appeals to logical persuasion.

==Greek rhetoric and Christianity==
New Testament translators favor the English word &quot;faith&quot; when translating &quot;pistis.&quot; Some have argued that the Christian concept of faith (&quot;pistis&quot;) was borrowed from Greek rhetorical notions of &quot;pistis&quot;, perhaps making &quot;argument&quot; a better translation than &quot;faith&quot;. Christian &quot;pistis&quot; deems its persuasion in a positive light as the New Testament concepts of pistis require that a listener be knowledgeable of the subject matter at issue and thus able to fully assent. Whereas, the Greeks took the notion of &quot;pistis&quot; as persuasive discourse that was elliptical and concentrated on the &quot;affect and effect rather than on the representation of the truth&quot;. The evolution of &quot;pistis&quot; in Christianity as a persuasive rhetorical technique starkly contrasts with its meaning used by the Greeks. More recent scholarship has argued for a more robust understanding of &quot;pistis&quot; that moved beyond a concept of &quot;belief&quot;&quot;.&quot; Teresa Morgan has argued for the concept of &quot;trust&quot;. Matthew Bates argues for &quot;allegiance&quot;.

<doc id="502194" wikidata="Q14442" url="?curid=502194" title="Lake Brienz">
<text>Lake Brienz () is a lake just north of the Alps, in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. It has a length of about , a width of and a maximum depth of . Its area is ; the surface is above the sea-level. It is fed, among others, by the upper reaches of the Aare at its eastern end, the Giessbach at its southern shore from steep, forested and rocky hills of the high Faulhorn and Schwarzhoren more than above the lake, as well as by both headwaters of the Lütschine, the &quot;Schwarze Lütschine&quot; (Black Lütschine) flowing from Grindelwald, and the &quot;Weisse Lütschine&quot; (White Lütschine) from the Lauterbrunnen Valley, at its southwestern corner. Not far north from Lütschine&#x27;s inflow, the lake drains into a further stretch of the Aare at its western end. The culminating point of the lake&#x27;s drainage basin is the Finsteraarhorn at 4,274 metres above sea level.

The village of Brienz, from which the lake takes its name, lies on the northern shore to its eastern end. In the west, the lake is terminated by the Bödeli, a tongue of land that separates it from neighbouring Lake Thun. The village of Bönigen occupies the lake frontage of the Bödeli, whilst the larger resort town of Interlaken lies on the reach of the Aare between the two lakes. The village of Iseltwald lies on the south shore, whilst the villages of Ringgenberg, Niederried and Oberried are on the north shore.

The lake is poor in nutrients, and thus fishing is not very important. Nevertheless, in 2001 10,000 kg of fish were caught.

There have been passenger ships on the lake since 1839, and currently there are five passenger ships on the lake. The ships are operated by BLS AG, the local railway company, and link Interlaken Ost railway station, which they access using a long navigable stretch of the Aare, with Brienz and other lakeside settlements. The ships also connect to the Giessbachbahn, a funicular which climbs up to the famous Giessbach Falls.

The Brünig railway line follows the northern shore of the lake, along with a local road, whilst the A8 motorway adopts an alternative and mostly tunnelled route above the southern shore.

<doc id="502203" wikidata="Q662577" url="?curid=502203" title="The Chieftains">
<text>The Chieftains are a traditional Irish folk band formed in Dublin in 1962, by Paddy Moloney, Seán Potts and Michael Tubridy. Their sound, which is almost entirely instrumental and largely built around uilleann pipes, has become synonymous with traditional Irish music. They are regarded as having helped popularise Irish music around the world. They have won six Grammy Awards during their career and they were given a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2002 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. Some music experts have credited The Chieftains with bringing traditional Irish music to a worldwide audience, so much so that the Irish government awarded them the honorary title of &#x27;Ireland&#x27;s Musical Ambassadors&#x27; in 1989.

==Name==
The band&#x27;s name came from the book &quot;Death of a Chieftain&quot; by Irish author John Montague. Assisted early on by Garech Browne, they signed with his company Claddagh Records. They needed financial success abroad and succeeded in this.

==Career==
===Origins===
Paddy Moloney was a member of Ceoltóirí Chualann, a group of musicians who specialised in instrumentals and sought to form a new band. Their first rehearsals were held at Moloney&#x27;s house, with David Fallon and Martin Fay joining the original three. The group remained only semi-professional until the 1970s. By then, they had achieved great success in Ireland and the United Kingdom.

===Rise to international fame===
In 1973, their popularity began to spread to the United States when their previous albums were released there by Island Records. They received further acclaim when they worked on the Academy Award–winning soundtrack to Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;, which triggered their transition to the mainstream in the US.

===Successful career===
The group continued to release successful records throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and their work with Van Morrison in 1988 resulted in the critically acclaimed album &quot;Irish Heartbeat&quot;. They went on to collaborate with many other well-known musicians and singers; among them Luciano Pavarotti, the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Roger Daltrey, and Van Morrison.

===50th anniversary===
In 2012, they celebrated their 50th anniversary with an ambitious album and tour. The album, &quot;Voice of Ages&quot;, was produced by T Bone Burnett and featured the Chieftains collaborating with many musicians including Bon Iver, Paolo Nutini and The Decemberists. It also included a collaboration with NASA astronaut Catherine Coleman playing the flute aboard the International Space Station as it orbited the Earth. The Chieftains performed at Carnegie Hall on March 17, 2012.

===The Irish Goodbye Tour===
In February 2019, The Chieftains embarked on an extensive farewell tour entitled the &quot;Irish Goodbye Tour&quot;, including a 2019 European leg, a 2020 Canadian leg and two 2019 and 2020 US legs.
On 13 March 2020, the band announced that a few tour dates of their &quot;Irish Goodbye Tour&quot; had been postponed (until further notice) due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===2021: Paddy Moloney&#x27;s death===
The Chieftains&#x27; co-founder and leader Paddy Moloney died suddenly on 12 October 2021, leaving the band&#x27;s future uncertain.

===2022: &quot;Live in San Francisco 1973 &amp; 1976&quot;===
On 23 July 2022, in celebration of the band&#x27;s 60 years, it was announced the forthcoming release on 2 September 2022 on vinyl, CD, and digital downloads of &quot;Bear&#x27;s Sonic Journals: The Foxhunt, The Chieftains Live in San Francisco 1973 &amp; 1976&quot; featuring the Chieftains performing live in San Francisco in 1973 and 1976. The 2CD &amp; Digital editions of the album feature the recordings of two entire shows in San Francisco: on October 1, 1973 at The Boarding House during their first tour in the U.S. (an unscheduled gig which occurred at Jerry Garcia&#x27;s invitation to open for his bluegrass band, Old &amp; In the Way) and on May 5, 1976 at The Great American Music Hall, while the vinyl release features 2 sides containing (only) the performance from October 1, 1973.

==Collaborations==
The band has become known for their vast work of collaborations with popular musicians of many genres, including country music, Galician traditional music, Newfoundland music, and rock and roll. Their widespread work as collaborators resulted in the Irish Government awarding the group the honorary title of Ireland&#x27;s Musical Ambassadors in 1989.

They have performed with (in alphabetical order):

In May 1986, they performed at Self Aid, a benefit concert held in Dublin that focused on the problem of chronic unemployment which was widespread in Ireland at that time. In 1994, they appeared in Roger Daltrey&#x27;s production, album and video of &quot;A Celebration: The Music of Pete Townshend and The Who&quot;. They performed with Canadian astronaut Cmdr. Chris Hadfield in Houston, Texas, on 15 February 2013. Hadfield sang and played guitar on &quot;Moondance&quot; from aboard the International Space Station.

==Success and legacy==
The band has won six Grammy Awards and has been nominated eighteen times. They have won an Emmy and a Genie and contributed tracks, including their highly praised version of the song &quot;Women of Ireland&quot;, to Leonard Rosenman&#x27;s Oscar-winning score for Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;. In 2002 they were given a &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; by the UK&#x27;s BBC Radio 2. Two of their singles have been minor hits in the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Have I Told You Lately&quot; (credited to The Chieftains with Van Morrison) reached No. 71 in 1995. &quot;I Know My Love&quot; (credited to The Chieftains featuring The Corrs) reached No. 37 in 1999.

Dr. Gearóid Ó hAllmhuráin said the success of The Chieftains helped place Irish traditional music on a par with other musical genres in the world of popular entertainment. By collaborating with pop and rock musicians, they have taken Irish music to a much wider audience. They have become, in effect, musical ambassadors for Ireland. This de facto role was officially recognised by the Irish government in 1989 when it awarded the group the honorary title of Ireland&#x27;s Musical Ambassadors.

==Notable performances==
They played in a concert for Pope John Paul II, before an audience of more than one million people in 1979 in Phoenix Park in Dublin, to mark the Papal visit to Ireland.

In 1983, they were invited by the Chinese Government to perform with the Chinese Broadcasting Art Group in a concert on the Great Wall of China, becoming the first Western musical group to do so. They were the first group to perform in the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., invited by Senator Edward Kennedy and the former Speaker of the House, Tip O&#x27;Neill.

In 2011, they performed at a concert in Dublin attended by President Mary McAleese and Queen Elizabeth II of Britain during her first-ever official trip to Ireland.

On 14 April 2023, they reunited for one last time to play for president Joe Biden who was visiting his ancestral home of Ballina, County Mayo in a historical tour of the Island.

<doc id="502205" wikidata="Q16526038" url="?curid=502205" title="Diophantine geometry">
<text>In mathematics, Diophantine geometry is the study of Diophantine equations by means of powerful methods in algebraic geometry. By the 20th century it became clear for some mathematicians that methods of algebraic geometry are ideal tools to study these equations. Diophantine geometry is part of the broader field of arithmetic geometry.

Four theorems in Diophantine geometry that are of fundamental importance include:

* Mordell–Weil theorem
* Roth&#x27;s theorem
* Siegel&#x27;s theorem
* Faltings&#x27;s theorem

==Background==
Serge Lang published a book &quot;Diophantine Geometry&quot; in the area in 1962, and by this book he coined the term &quot;Diophantine geometry&quot;. The traditional arrangement of material on Diophantine equations was by degree and number of variables, as in Mordell&#x27;s &quot;Diophantine Equations&quot; (1969). Mordell&#x27;s book starts with a remark on homogeneous equations &quot;f&quot; = 0 over the rational field, attributed to C. F. Gauss, that non-zero solutions in integers (even primitive lattice points) exist if non-zero rational solutions do, and notes a caveat of L. E. Dickson, which is about parametric solutions. The Hilbert–Hurwitz result from 1890 reducing the Diophantine geometry of curves of genus 0 to degrees 1 and 2 (conic sections) occurs in Chapter 17, as does Mordell&#x27;s conjecture. Siegel&#x27;s theorem on integral points occurs in Chapter 28. Mordell&#x27;s theorem on the finite generation of the group of rational points on an elliptic curve is in Chapter 16, and integer points on the Mordell curve in Chapter 26.

In a hostile review of Lang&#x27;s book, Mordell wrote:

He notes that the content of the book is largely versions of the Mordell–Weil theorem, Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem, Siegel&#x27;s theorem, with a treatment of Hilbert&#x27;s irreducibility theorem and applications (in the style of Siegel). Leaving aside issues of generality, and a completely different style, the major mathematical difference between the two books is that Lang used abelian varieties and offered a proof of Siegel&#x27;s theorem, while Mordell noted that the proof &quot;is of a very advanced character&quot; (p. 263).

Despite a bad press initially, Lang&#x27;s conception has been sufficiently widely accepted for a 2006 tribute to call the book &quot;visionary&quot;. A larger field sometimes called arithmetic of abelian varieties now includes Diophantine geometry along with class field theory, complex multiplication, local zeta-functions and L-functions. Paul Vojta wrote:

:While others at the time shared this viewpoint (e.g., Weil, Tate, Serre), it is easy to forget that others did not, as Mordell&#x27;s review of &quot;Diophantine Geometry&quot; attests.

==Approaches==
A single equation defines a hypersurface, and simultaneous Diophantine equations give rise to a general algebraic variety &quot;V&quot; over &quot;K&quot;; the typical question is about the nature of the set &quot;V&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) of points on &quot;V&quot; with co-ordinates in &quot;K&quot;, and by means of height functions, quantitative questions about the &quot;size&quot; of these solutions may be posed, as well as the qualitative issues of whether any points exist, and if so whether there are an infinite number. Given the geometric approach, the consideration of homogeneous equations and homogeneous co-ordinates is fundamental, for the same reasons that projective geometry is the dominant approach in algebraic geometry. Rational number solutions therefore are the primary consideration; but integral solutions (i.e. lattice points) can be treated in the same way as an affine variety may be considered inside a projective variety that has extra points at infinity.

The general approach of Diophantine geometry is illustrated by Faltings&#x27;s theorem (a conjecture of L. J. Mordell) stating that an algebraic curve &quot;C&quot; of genus &quot;g&quot; &gt; 1 over the rational numbers has only finitely many rational points. The first result of this kind may have been the theorem of Hilbert and Hurwitz dealing with the case &quot;g&quot; = 0. The theory consists both of theorems and many conjectures and open questions.

<doc id="502207" wikidata="Q331838" url="?curid=502207" title="Michael Steele">
<text>Michael Stephen Steele (born October 19, 1958) is an American politician, attorney, and political commentator who served as the seventh lieutenant governor of Maryland from 2003 to 2007 and as chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC) from 2009 until 2011; he was the first African-American to hold either office.

In the 1990s, Steele worked as a partner at the international law firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene &amp; MacRae and co-founded the Republican Leadership Council, a &quot;fiscally conservative and socially inclusive&quot; political action committee. Steele also made numerous appearances as a political pundit on Fox News and other media outlets prior to running for public office. As lieutenant governor, Steele chaired the Minority Business Enterprise task force, actively promoting an expansion of affirmative action in the corporate world. He made an unsuccessful run in the 2006 U.S. Senate election in Maryland, losing to Democrat Ben Cardin. From 2007 to 2009, Steele was chairman of GOPAC, a 527 organization that trains and supports Republican candidates in state and local elections. After serving one term as RNC Chair from 2009 to 2011, he lost his bid for a second term and was succeeded by Reince Priebus. Since 2011, Steele has contributed as a regular columnist for online magazine &quot;The Root&quot; and as a political analyst for MSNBC. In 2018, he became a Senior Fellow at Brown University&#x27;s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs.

In 2020, he formally endorsed Joe Biden for the presidency, after previously starring in an advertisement aired by The Lincoln Project.

He currently co-hosts MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;The Weekend&quot; and 7 pm ET weekday broadcasts MSNBC Prime with Alicia Menendez and Symone Sanders-Townsend. 

==Early life and education==
Steele was born on October 19, 1958, at Andrews Air Force Base in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, and was adopted as an infant by William and Maebell Steele. His father died in 1962. His mother, who had been born into a sharecropping family in South Carolina, worked for minimum wage as a laundress to raise her children. After Steele&#x27;s father died, she ignored her friends&#x27; appeals to apply for public assistance, later telling Steele, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want the government raising my children.&quot; She later married John Turner, a truck driver. Michael and his sister, Monica Turner, were raised in the Petworth neighborhood of Northwest, Washington, D.C., which Steele has described as a small, stable and racially integrated community that insulated him from some of the problems elsewhere in the city. Steele&#x27;s sister later married and divorced former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson.

Steele attended Archbishop Carroll High School in Washington, D.C., participating in the glee club, the National Honor Society and many of the school&#x27;s drama productions. During his senior year, he was elected student council president.

In 1981, Steele received a BA degree in international studies from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore City, Maryland.

After graduating from Hopkins, Steele worked for one year as a high school teacher at Malvern Preparatory School in Pennsylvania, teaching classes in world history and economics. He spent three years preparing for the Catholic priesthood at the Augustinian Friars Seminary at Villanova University, which he left prior to ordination to enter civil service.

Steele subsequently attended Georgetown Law School where he graduated with a JD degree in 1991. He failed the Maryland bar exam, but passed the Pennsylvania exam.

From 1991 to 1997, Steele worked in Washington, D.C., as a corporate securities associate for the Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton international law firm, where he specialized in financial investments for Wall Street underwriters. He left the firm to found the Steele Group, a business and legal consulting firm.

==Political development==

After joining the Republican Party, he became chairman of the Prince George&#x27;s County Republican Central Committee. He was a founding member of the centrist, fiscally conservative and socially inclusive Republican Leadership Council in 1993 but left in 2008, citing disagreements over endorsing primary candidates. In 1995, the Maryland Republican Party selected him as their Republican Man of the Year. He worked on several political campaigns, was an alternate delegate to the 1996 Republican National Convention and a delegate to the 2000 Republican National Convention. Steele&#x27;s Maryland biography identifies him as a member of the Tau Epsilon Phi fraternity.

In December 2000, he was elected chairman of the Maryland Republican Party, becoming the first African-American ever to be elected chairman of any state Republican Party.

==Lieutenant Governor of Maryland==

In 2002, Robert Ehrlich, who was running for Maryland governor, selected Steele as his running mate for lieutenant governor. The campaign was waged against Democrat Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, who was running for governor, and Charles R. Larson who was running for lieutenant governor.

In the September primary election, Ehrlich and Steele had no serious opposition. In the November 2002 general election, the Republican Ehrlich-Steele ticket won, 51 percent to 48 percent, even though Maryland traditionally votes Democratic and had not elected a Republican Governor in almost 40 years. The Townsend-Larson campaign had been tainted by outgoing Democratic governor Parris Glendening&#x27;s marital problems and backlash due to his strict enforcement of environmental regulations.

Steele&#x27;s most prominent efforts for the Ehrlich administration were reforming the state&#x27;s Minority Business Enterprise program and chairing the Governor&#x27;s Commission on Quality Education in Maryland. Steele garnered criticism for his failure to oppose Ehrlich&#x27;s reinstitution of the death penalty, despite claims of racial inequities in the use of the death penalty, Steele&#x27;s own religious beliefs and his prior anti-death penalty pronouncements.

In 2005, Steele was named an Aspen Institute Rodel Fellow in Public Leadership and was awarded the Bethune-DuBois Institute Award for his continuing efforts to improve the quality education in Maryland.

At the 2004 Republican National Convention, Steele gave the Republican counterpoint to Barack Obama&#x27;s 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address; it was Steele&#x27;s first major national exposure. In April 2005, President Bush chose him to be a member of the U.S. delegation at the investiture of Pope Benedict XVI in Vatican City.

==2006 campaign for U.S. Senate==

When Paul Sarbanes, Maryland&#x27;s longest-serving United States Senator, announced in March 2005 that he would not be a candidate for re-election in 2006, top state and national Republican officials began pressing Steele to become their party&#x27;s nominee for the seat. In April 2005, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; announced the results of a poll it conducted, stating that Steele would run statistically neck and neck against either former NAACP head Kweisi Mfume, or Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin of Baltimore County. Steele formally announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate on October 25, 2005.

Steele won the Republican nomination after facing little opposition in the primary. His opponents were Democrat Ben Cardin and Independent Kevin Zeese (who was endorsed by the Green and Libertarian parties). The three candidates participated in three debates. Cardin primarily attacked Steele over his close relations with President Bush. Steele focused on low taxes, less government spending, free markets and national security.

Steele lost the general election to Cardin on November 7, 2006, 44% to Cardin&#x27;s 54%. Steele&#x27;s former campaign finance chairman later alleged improprieties in Steele&#x27;s handling of campaign funds, which Steele denied.

==After the senate race==
One day after Steele conceded defeat in the senate election, Chris Cillizza of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Steele was hoping to succeed Ken Mehlman as the chairman of the Republican National Committee. Senator Mel Martinez of Florida, who had the endorsement of President George W. Bush, got the position.

In February 2007, Steele became chairman of GOPAC, a political action committee that helps fund state and local Republican campaigns around the country and is responsible for training future Republican candidates. He succeeded former U.S. Congressman J.C. Watts, a fellow black Republican. In April 2007, Steele joined the international law firm of Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf, as a partner in the firm&#x27;s Washington, D.C. office.

At a speech given at the Media Research Center&#x27;s 2007 DisHonors Awards Gala, Steele said:

Steele is considered a possible candidate for Governor of Maryland in the future and said he was &quot;intrigued by the idea&quot; for 2010. He said that he would not run for president in 2012.

Steele appeared several times on HBO&#x27;s political show &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;, and was on Comedy Central&#x27;s talk show &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on January 23, 2007. He also hosted a PBS Republican Primary debate in Baltimore, Maryland on September 27, 2007.

He coined the phrase &quot;Drill Baby Drill&quot; during the 2008 Republican National Convention in Minnesota, where he promoted offshore drilling as an alternative to dependency on foreign oil.

==RNC chairman==
===2009 election===

On November 24, 2008, Steele kicked off his campaign for the RNC chairmanship by launching his website. On January 30, 2009, Steele won the chairmanship of the RNC in the sixth round, with 91 votes to Katon Dawson&#x27;s 77. Steele, the RNC&#x27;s first African American chairman, was selected in the aftermath of President Obama&#x27;s election; many in the GOP saw him as a charismatic counter to the nation&#x27;s first Black president.

===Leadership dispute with Rush Limbaugh===
On March 1, 2009, in response to a question on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Face the Nation&quot; as to who spoke for the Republican Party, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel opined that Rush Limbaugh spoke for the Party; Emanuel asserted that &quot;whenever a Republican criticizes [Limbaugh], they have to run back and apologize to him, and say they were misunderstood. He is the voice and the intellectual force and energy behind the Republican Party. And he has been upfront about what he views, and hasn&#x27;t stepped back from that, which is he hopes for [President Obama&#x27;s] failure. He said it. And I compliment him for his honesty, but that&#x27;s their philosophy that is enunciated by Rush Limbaugh.&quot;

In remarks aired by the CNN program &quot;D.L. Hughley Breaks the News&quot; on March 1, 2009, Steele said he, rather than Limbaugh, was &quot;the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Republican Party. Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer. Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s whole thing is entertainment. Yes, it is incendiary. Yes, it is ugly.&quot; On March 2, 2009, Limbaugh said on his radio show that Steele was not fit to lead the Republican Party, asking why Steele claimed &quot;to lead the Republican Party when [he seemed] obsessed with seeing to it President Obama succeeds?&quot; After the show, Steele called Limbaugh to apologize, saying &quot;I have enormous respect for Rush Limbaugh. I was maybe a little bit inarticulate. There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership. I went back at that tape and I realized words that I said weren&#x27;t what I was thinking. It was one of those things where I thinking I was saying one thing, and it came out differently. What I was trying to say was a lot of people want to make Rush the scapegoat, the bogeyman, and he&#x27;s not.&quot; Steele later issued another statement to say that Limbaugh &quot;is a national conservative leader, and in no way do I want to diminish his voice. I truly apologize.&quot;

===Fire Pelosi Bus Tour===
In the fall of 2010, Steele launched the &quot;Fire Pelosi Bus Tour&quot;, with the goal of &quot;firing&quot; Speaker Pelosi from her position as Speaker of the House of Representatives by re-establishing a Republican majority in the United States House of Representatives. The tour began on September 15 and lasted six weeks, visiting 48 states in the Continental U.S. and more than 100 cities while covering 14,000 miles. The Tour&#x27;s purpose was to &quot;encourage votes for Republicans in districts across the nation&quot;. The stops in individual districts gave Steele, &quot;known for his bomb-throwing speaking style&quot;, an opportunity to fire up local GOP activists. During the tour, &quot;Steele urged party unity&quot; as the Republicans attempted to take over the House of Representatives and end Representative Pelosi&#x27;s tenure as Speaker of the House.

The RNC broke fundraising records by raising over $198 million during the 2010 congressional cycle; in November 2010, Republicans won 63 House seats (the biggest pickup since 1938) and retook control of the House. The 2010 midterm elections were successful for Steele and the Republicans, as they also took back six Senate seats, seven governorships, and the greatest share of state legislative seats since 1928 (over 600 seats).

===2011 election===
In December 2010, Steele declared that he would run for re-election as RNC chairman. The 2011 Republican National Committee (RNC) chairmanship election was held on January 14, 2011. Steele withdrew from the race after the fourth ballot, urging his supporters to vote for Maria Cino. After seven rounds of balloting, Reince Priebus was elected over Steele, Saul Anuzis, Ann Wagner and Maria Cino.
: Candidate won majority of votes in the round
: Candidate secured a plurality of votes in the round
: Candidate withdrew

==After the chairmanship==

After his loss in the chairmanship election, Steele was hired by MSNBC to be a regular political analyst as of May 2011. He also was hired to be a columnist for the online magazine &quot;The Root&quot;, an African-American news and commentary site owned by The Washington Post Company.

On C-SPAN&#x27;s &quot;Washington Journal&quot; on the Sunday after the 2012 Obama reelection victory, Steele expressed some interest in running for RNC Chairman again. Steele emphasized the need to make conservative minorities feel comfortable and welcome in a party that offered them opportunities to launch political careers in counties and statehouses.

In 2018, Steele was named a faculty fellow at Brown University&#x27;s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, where he leads seminars.

In August 2020, Steele joined the Lincoln Project PAC and endorsed Joe Biden for president. In April 2021, Steele expressed interest in running in the Republican primary for governor of Maryland, later forming an exploratory committee in July 2021. Later that month, state delegate Lauren Arikan filed a campaign finance complaint against Steele, alleging that he was illegally using a 527 committee to coordinate campaign activities. In a formal response, Steele rejected these claims, citing that the committee had not made any expenditures and was not in violation of Maryland campaign finance law. In January 2022, he announced that he would not run for governor. Steele later attended the inauguration of Governor-elect Wes Moore on January 18, 2023. On November 30, 2023, MSNBC announced that Steele would be co-hosting a new weekend morning show, alongside Alicia Menendez and Symone Sanders-Townsend.

Starting February 24, 2025, Steele and his other co-hosts on &quot;The Weekend&quot; would co-host a newscast on MSNBC&#x27;s weekday 7pm ET time slot which was previously occupied Joy Reid&#x27;s &quot;The ReidOut&quot;

==Political positions==
===Economic views===
As Lieutenant Governor of Maryland, Steele chaired the Governor&#x27;s Commission on Minority Business Enterprise Reform.

Steele criticized the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (stimulus bill).

===Environment and energy===
Steele rejects the scientific consensus on climate change, claiming in 2009 that the Earth is &quot;cooling&quot; rather than &quot;the supposed warming&quot;.

===Opposition to President Donald Trump===
Steele was openly critical of Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign and has continued to oppose President Trump during his subsequent administration. In a January 2018 interview on MSNBC, in response to an accusation that President Trump had referred to El Salvador and Haiti as &quot;shithole countries&quot;, Steele expressed his belief that the President was &quot;racist&quot;. Steele reiterated his frustration with Trump and his supporters during the COVID-19 pandemic by saying &quot;I&#x27;ve talked to enough of them over the last few days. I&#x27;m exhausted, I&#x27;m exasperated. You know, at this point, it&#x27;s like, save who you can save. Because there&#x27;s only so much you can do, there&#x27;s only so much you can say. The fact that we have to literally beg people to wear a mask to save their own dumb ass from getting sick, I&#x27;m sorry. To me, it is beyond the imagination... I am just so exhausted with this president.&quot;

===Social views===
In 2008, Steele said he was opposed to abortion and thought &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was &quot;wrongly decided&quot;. In a March 2009 interview with &quot;GQ&quot;, Steele suggested that abortion restrictions should be left to state governments, and stated that he &quot;absolutely&quot; believed there was room for a &quot;pro-choice&quot; candidate in the GOP. This statement prompted criticism from socially conservative Republicans such as Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, as well as the Christian Coalition, and Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council. In response to these critics, Steele suggested that he asked God for patience &quot;so I absolutely don&#x27;t go out and kick this person&#x27;s ass&quot;.

In 2008, Steele said that he personally opposes a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, saying that he believes states should decide the issue for themselves. Steele, however, has indicated he would uphold the Republican Party platform and support the amendment. He rates the issue of banning same-sex marriage low in importance. In 2009, Steele opposed same-sex civil unions. However, in 2012, Steele said that LGBT couples deserve full privileges and benefits under the law.

In a 2006 interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Steele commented on gun control: &quot;Society should draw lines. What do you need an assault weapon for, if you&#x27;re going hunting? That&#x27;s overkill. But I don&#x27;t think that means you go to a total ban for those who want to use guns for skeet shooting or hunting or things like that. But what&#x27;s the point of passing gun laws if we&#x27;re not going to enforce them? If you want to talk about gun control, that&#x27;s where you need to start. We&#x27;ve got 300 gun laws on the books right now. At the end of the day, it&#x27;s about how we enforce the law.&quot;

In 2009, speaking on illegal immigration, Steele called for the U.S. to &quot;secure our borders first&quot;, saying, &quot;you cannot begin to address the concerns of the people who are already here unless and until you have made certain that no more are coming in behind them.&quot;

During his 2006 campaign, Steele said that he only supported stem cell research if it did not result in the destruction of the embryo. In February 2006, Steele compared embryonic stem cell research to medical experiments performed by the Nazis during the Holocaust, remarks for which he later apologized.

===Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq===
In July 2010, video footage of Steele was released in which he stated that the Afghan war was &quot;a war of Obama&#x27;s choosing. If he&#x27;s such a student of history has he not understood that, you know, that&#x27;s the one thing you don&#x27;t do – is engage in a land war in Afghanistan? Everyone who has tried, over a thousand years of history has failed.&quot; He also said the war was &quot;not something the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in&quot;. However, the war in Afghanistan was initiated by George W. Bush in October 2001 in retaliation for the September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington D.C.; Barack Obama increased troop levels there.

Steele&#x27;s comments drew criticism, with neoconservative commentator William Kristol calling for Steele&#x27;s resignation and former George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove calling Steele&#x27;s comment &quot;boneheaded.&quot; U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican nominee for president in the 2008 election, withdrew his support from Steele, calling Steele&#x27;s comments &quot;wildly inaccurate ... there is no excuse for them&quot; and saying &quot;I think that Mr. Steele is going to have to assess as to whether he can still lead the Republican Party as chairman of the Republican National Committee.&quot; Senator Jim DeMint called upon Steele to apologize and Senator Lindsey Graham said, &quot;It was an uninformed, unnecessary, unwise, untimely comment. This is not President Obama&#x27;s war, this is America&#x27;s war. We need to stand behind the president.&quot; Former Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth Cheney also called for Steele to resign. However, Congressman Ron Paul, who is known for his generally antiwar stance, in support of Steele said, &quot;Michael Steele has it right, and Republicans should stick by him.&quot;

In contrast to his position on Afghanistan, Steele has been a supporter of the Iraq War and President George W. Bush&#x27;s war strategy. During his 2006 campaign, Steele opposed setting a timetable for U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. Steele criticized President Obama on the issue, complaining that he had &quot;demonized&quot; the Iraq War.

===National Popular Vote Interstate Compact===

Steele is a supporter of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. In a piece co-authored with former Michigan Republican Party Chairman Saul Anuzis, Steele states that &quot;the good news is that under a national popular vote, a Republican could probably survive a narrow popular vote loss in Texas or Florida and still win the presidency, because every GOP vote in those states would still count toward a national popular vote majority.&quot;

==&quot;Right Now&quot;==
Steele&#x27;s book, &quot;Right Now: A 12-Step Program for Defeating the Obama Agenda&quot;, was released on January 4, 2010; it was published by Regnery Publishing, . The Associated Press reported that, &quot;Steele focuses much of the book on familiar GOP denunciations of President Barack Obama&#x27;s overall policies (&#x27;a roadmap to failure&#x27;), the $787 billion stimulus bill (&#x27;a reckless, wasteful, pork-laden spending spree&#x27;), liberal views on man-made global warming (&#x27;A threat to life on Earth? Depends on whom you ask&#x27;) and other issues. To regain the public confidence, Steele says the GOP should, among other things, expose the &#x27;reign of error&#x27; inherent in liberal policies, contrast conservative and liberal principles, and highlight the damage caused by Obama&#x27;s policies while explaining conservative solutions.&quot;

<text>K-27 was the only nuclear submarine of the Soviet Navy&#x27;s Project 645. It was constructed by placing a pair of experimental VT-1 nuclear reactors that used a liquid-metal coolant (lead-bismuth eutectic) into the modified hull of a Project 627A () vessel. A unique NATO reporting name was not assigned.

==Launch and operations==
The keel of &quot;K-27&quot; was laid down on 15 June 1958 at Severodvinsk Shipyard No. 402. It was launched on 1 April 1962, and went into service as an experimental &quot;attack submarine&quot; on 30 October 1963. &quot;K-27&quot; was officially commissioned into the Soviet Northern Fleet on 7 September 1965. &quot;K-27&quot; was assigned to the 17th submarine division, headquartered at Gremikha.

The nuclear reactors of &quot;K-27&quot; were troublesome from their first criticality, but the &quot;K-27&quot; was able to engage in test operations for about five years. On 24 May 1968, the power output of one of her reactors suddenly dropped sharply; radioactive gases were released into her engine room; and the radiation levels throughout &quot;K-27&quot; increased dangerously – by 1.5 grays per hour. This radiation consisted mostly of gamma rays and thermal neutrons, with some alpha radiation and beta radiation in addition – generated by the released radioactive gases such as xenon and krypton in her reactor compartment.

The training of the crew by the Soviet Navy had been inadequate, and these sailors did not recognize that their nuclear reactor had suffered from extensive fuel element failures. By the time they gave up their attempts to repair the reactor at sea, nine of the crewmen had accumulated fatal radioactive exposures.

About one-fifth of the reactor core had experienced inadequate cooling caused by uneven coolant flows. Hot spots in the reactor had ruptured, releasing nuclear fuel and nuclear fission products into the liquid-metal coolant, which circulated them throughout her reactor compartment.

&quot;K-27&quot; was laid up in Gremikha Bay starting on 20 June 1968. The cooling-off of the reactors and various experimental projects were carried out aboard the submarine through 1973. These included the successful restarting of the starboard reactor up to 40% of maximal power production. Plans were considered to slice off the reactor compartment and replace it with a new one containing standard VM-A water-cooled reactors. The rebuilding or replacement of the nuclear reactor was considered to be too expensive, and also to be inappropriate because more modern nuclear submarines had already entered service in the Soviet Navy.

==Disposal==
&quot;K-27&quot; was officially decommissioned on 1 February 1979. During the summer of 1981 her reactor compartment was filled with a special solidifying mixture of furfuryl alcohol and bitumen, at Severodvinsk shipyard No. 893 &quot;Zvezdochka&quot;, to seal the compartment and avoid pollution of the ocean with radioactive products. 

&quot;K-27&quot; was then towed to a special training area in the western Kara Sea, and scuttled on 6 September 1982, in a fjord at Stepovoy Bay at a depth of just , near position 72°31&#x27;28&quot;N., 55°30&#x27;09&quot;E. off the northeastern coast of Novaya Zemlya. The bow sank, reaching the sea floor, while the stern remained afloat; a naval salvage tug rammed it to pierce the aft ballast tanks and complete the sinking. This scuttling was performed contrary to the International Atomic Energy Agency&#x27;s requirement that nuclear-powered submarines and surface ships must be scuttled at depths not less than .

The last scientific expedition of the Russian Ministry of Emergencies to the Kara Sea examined the site of the scuttling in September 2006. Numerous samples of the seawater, the seafloor, and the sealife were gathered and then analyzed. The final report stated that the radiation levels of the area were stable.

Lessons in nuclear submarine construction and safety learned from Project 645 were applied in Projects 705 and 705K – that produced the Soviet s. These were equipped with similar liquid-metal-cooled reactors.

=== Recovery plans ===
Although a joint Russian and Norwegian mission in 2012 did not find alarming levels of radioactivity in the water and soil surrounding the submarine, an urgent consideration pertains to the dismantling of the nuclear reactors should the submarine be raised. Because the reactors were cooled by liquid metals, the nuclear rods became fused with the coolant when the reactors were stopped and conventional methods cannot be used for disassembling the reactors. However, France&#x27;s Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission designed and donated special equipment for a dedicated dry-dock (SD-10) in Gremikha, which was used to dismantle the Alfa-class submarines that shared this design feature. However, since the last Alfa reactor was dismantled in 2011, this equipment is at risk.

In 2017, plans were again mooted to raise the submarine, by 2022. The Krylov State Research Center of Saint Petersburg announced that it was working on plans for a catamaran floating dock, capable of such heavy lifts from the seabed.

In March 2020, Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a draft decree for an initiative to lift the &quot;K-27&quot; and and four reactor compartments from the Barents Sea.

<text>Lake Biel or Lake Bienne (; ) is a lake in western Switzerland. Together with Lake Morat and Lake Neuchâtel, it is one of the three large lakes in the Jura region of Switzerland. It lies on the language boundary between German and French speaking areas.

== Geography ==
The lake is 15 km long and up to 4.1 km wide. Its surface area is 39.3 km2, the maximum depth 74 m. The lake is located at 429 metres above sea level.

Lake Biel/Bienne has a catchment area of about 8,305 km2. Water remains in the lake for an average of 58 days. The rivers Aare and Zihl/Thielle flowing from Lake Neuchâtel, the Twannbach draining water down from the surplombing first Jura mountain range and the Suze draining water down from the Vallon de St. Imier, are the main tributaries. The Aare was redirected into the lake in 1878, in order to prevent the flooding of the nearby area called &quot;Seeland&quot;, and drains the water out of the lake down to Büren through a simultaneously man-made channel. The level of all three lakes is being controlled by a dam built across the channel, in Port.

The largest settlement along the shores of Lake Biel are the bilingual city of Biel/Bienne and its sister city Nidau, both located on the northern end. The St. Peter&#x27;s Island attracts tourists. The island is located near Erlach/Cerlier. Jean-Jacques Rousseau once spent a few months on the island.

One of the main business in the area is the watch and affiliated microtechnic industries. World famous watch brands have their sites and headquarters in the area, including the Swatch Group and Rolex movements manufacture.

The lake&#x27;s surface is the lowest point of the canton of Neuchâtel.

== Towns and villages by the lake ==

As the lake is located on the border of the French and German language regions, most places have names in both languages, though not all versions are still in use.

<doc id="502217" wikidata="Q839507" url="?curid=502217" title="Magnolia stellata">
<text>Magnolia stellata, the star magnolia, is a slow-growing deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It bears large, showy white or pink flowers in early spring, before its leaves open. This species is closely related to the Kobushi magnolia (&quot;Magnolia kobus&quot;), and is treated by many botanists as a variety or even a cultivar of that. However, &quot;Magnolia stellata&quot; was accepted as a distinct species in the 1998 monograph by Hunt.

==Description==

This shrub grows in height, spreading to in width at maturity. Young plants display upright oval growth, but the plants spread and mound with age.

&quot;M. stellata&quot; blooms at a young age, with the slightly fragrant wide flowers covering the bare plant in late winter or early spring before the leaves appear. There is natural variation within the flower color, from white to rich pink; the pink also changes from year to year. The flowers are star-shaped, with at least 12 thin, delicate petal-like tepals, some cultivars having more than 30.

The leaves open bronze-green, turning to deep green as they mature, and yellow before dropping in autumn. They are oblong and about long by about wide.

&quot;M. stellata&quot; produces a reddish-green, knobby aggregate fruit about long that matures in early autumn. Mature fruit opens by slits to reveal orange-red seeds, but the fruits often drop before developing fully.

Young twigs have smooth, shiny chestnut brown bark, while the main trunks have smooth, silvery gray bark. Like the saucer magnolia (&quot;Magnolia&quot; × &quot;soulangeana),&quot; it is deciduous, revealing a twiggy, naked frame in winter.
Plants have thick, fleshy roots which are found fairly close to the surface and do not tolerate much disturbance.

==Origins==
The species &quot;Magnolia stellata&quot; may be found growing wild in certain parts of the Ise Bay area of central Honshū, Japan’s largest island, at elevations of . It grows by streamsides and in moist, boggy areas with such other woody plants as &quot;Enkianthus cernuus, Corylopsis glabrescens&quot; var. &quot;gotoana&quot; and &quot;Berberis sieboldii.&quot;

==Hybrids==
*&quot;Magnolia&quot; × &quot;loebneri&quot; = &quot;Magnolia kobus&quot; × &quot;Magnolia stellata&quot;.
This hybrid was first obtained by Max Loebner of Pillnitz, Germany. Paul M. Kache designated the new hybrid in 1920, to honour Max Löbner. Numerous other varieties are produced by these parents as &#x27;Leonard Messel&#x27; and &#x27;Merrill&#x27;. The selection, &#x27;Leonard Messel&#x27; was a chance hybrid that was developed at Messel&#x27;s garden in Sussex, UK, Nymans. Also on the market are white &#x27;Ballerina&#x27; and the late-flowering white &#x27;Merrill&#x27; that extend the &quot;loebneri&quot; season.

*&quot;Magnolia&quot; × &quot;proctoriana&quot; = &quot;Magnolia salicifolia&quot; × &quot;Magnolia stellata&quot;. The hybrid of these closely related species was first obtained in 1925 at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University.
*&quot;Magnolia liliiflora&quot; × &quot;Magnolia stellata&quot;, hybrid obtained at the US National Arboretum by Francis DeVos and William Corsair. There are in the trade eight varieties with women&#x27;s names, the &quot;Eight Little Girls&quot;.

==Cultivation==
After it was introduced to the United States in 1862 by Dr. George Robert Hall (1820-1899), &quot;Magnolia stellata&quot; has been widely cultivated in much of North America, and has been recorded as an established escape in a few places. It is also a commonly grown ornamental in Europe, and was first introduced to the United Kingdom in 1877 or 1878, most likely by Charles Maries, while he was collecting for Veitch Nurseries.

Its compact size makes it an ideal subject for smaller gardens, where its flowers - appearing initially on bare stems - provide some much needed colour in early Spring.
The cultivars &#x27;Centennial&#x27;, &#x27;Jane Platt&#x27;, and &#x27;Royal Star&#x27; have all gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

Spring frosts can damage the flowers. The shrub prefers deep, acidic soil. It may be propagated by seed, or more easily by rooting cuttings taken after the flower buds have formed.

<text>Argentine () is a station on Line 1 of the Paris Métro, located on the boundary between the 16th arrondissement and the 17th arrondissement, in the western part of the city.

==Location==
Like most stations on Line 1, Argentine station lies on an east–west route through Paris from Vincennes in the east to La Défense in the west. Specifically, the station is underneath Avenue de la Grande Armée, the extension of the Champs-Élysées west of the Arc de Triomphe, at its intersection with Rue d&#x27;Argentine. In relation to the rest of the city, Argentine straddles the border between the 16th and 17th arrondissements of Paris.

==History==
Argentine station opened on 1 September 1900, six weeks after the opening of the initial segment of Line 1 between Porte de Vincennes and Porte Maillot, as part of the gradual opening of stations on the inaugural line of the Métro.

Upon its opening, the station was known as Obligado, the name of the nearby cross-street at the time, in turn named after the Battle of Vuelta de Obligado, a Pyrhic Anglo-French victory over the Argentine Confederation in 1845 commanded by Juan Manuel de Rosas.

The name remained until 25 May 1948, when Rue Obligado was renamed Rue d&#x27;Argentine, as a good-will gesture after the visit of Eva Perón to France and as a mark of respect to Argentina, which was a source of aid to the French during World War II; large shipments of grain and beef arrived from Argentina to feed the population struggling to get their fields and livestock back in order.

In the 1960s, the platform were covered with a metallic panels with yellow horizontal uprights and with golden, illuminated advertising frames. This arrangement was completed by yellow benches attached to the panels. In the same period, a crypt was created at the end of the two platforms towards Château de Vincennes to allow the passage of five to six cars. The station lost the tiling of the tunnel exit towards Vincennes and the vault.

At the end of the 1990s, the metallic panels were renewed. The horizontal uprights changed from yellow to blue, they were completed with blue &quot;Motte&quot; style seats to replace the old yellow benches attached to the camber and the old enamelled plates indicating the station name have been replaced by Parisine font plates.

On March 24, 2006, a commemorative plaque was inaugurated on the western tunnel exit of the platforms towards La Défense, bearing the words in Spanish&quot; Nunca más&quot; (literally meaning: &quot;Never again&quot;), &quot;in homage to Argentine citizens and French kidnapped, detained and disappeared in Argentina under the military dictatorship (1976-1983) ”and“ to all the victims of repression ”. A small exhibition on Argentina was also opened in the middle of the platform towards Château De Vincennes.

As part of the automation of line 1, the platforms were completely renovated in 2008, resulting in the removal of the bodywork and the exposures. They were raised on the weekend of 20 and 21 September 2008 to platform screen doors, which were installed in February 2010.

In 2019, 3,026,210 travelers entered this station, which places it at the 172nd position of metro stations for its use out of 302.

In 2020, with the COVID-19 crisis, 1,603,572 travelers entered this station, which places it 160th among metro stations in terms of attendance.

On 18 December 2022, the station was temporarily renamed &quot;France&quot; ahead of 2022 FIFA World Cup final, which was played by France and Argentina.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two entrances made up of fixed stairs:
* access 1 &quot;Rue des Acacias&quot;, adorned with a Dervaux candelabra, located to the right of no. 36 of the avenue;
* access 2 &quot;Avenue de la Grande-Armée&quot; located opposite no 37.
===Station layout===

===Platforms===
As the Paris Métro runs inversely to normal railways in the rest of France (save for in Alsace-Moselle), the southern track is used by trains heading east to Château de Vincennes and the northern to La Défense – Grand Arche. Argentine is a station of standard configuration. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. A 15-meter-long crypt, whose ceiling rests on pillars very close together has been extended it at its eastern end due to increasing the service to six-car trains in the 1960s.

Since 2008, as part of the automation of line 1, the platforms have been decorated on a theme dedicated to Argentina, mainly composed of eight large backlit panels of different colours each representing a landscape of that country, to which is incorporated the name of the station in Parisine font. The inauguration of these facilities took place on 15 June 2011 in the presence of Pierre Mongin, Chairman and CEO of RATP, Aldo Ferrer, Ambassador of Argentina and Enrique Meyer, Minister Argentine Tourism. The station&#x27;s &quot;Akiko&quot; style seats are in the emblematic colour of that country, blue.

The rest of the decoration is classic according to the style used for the majority of the metro stations. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the metro revival of the 2000s, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the wall, the tunnel exits towards La Défense and the outlets of the corridors. The vault and the tunnel exit towards Vincennes are painted white, while the columns of the crypt are covered with small tiles of a dark shade. The advertising frames are in white ceramic and the platforms are equipped with platform screen doors.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by bus line 73 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N11 and N24 of the Noctilien bus network.

<text>Lake Morat or more rarely Lake Murten ( ) is a lake located in the cantons of Fribourg and Vaud in the west of Switzerland. It is named after the small bilingual town of Murten/Morat on its southern shore.

It is the smallest of the three lakes in the Seeland or Pays des trois lacs area of the Swiss plateau located at the foot of the first chain of the Jura mountains. The main tributary is the river Broye.

Since the Jura water correction its water leaves the lake through the Broye Canal (&quot;Canal de la Broye&quot;) into nearby Lake Neuchâtel that is connected to Lake Bienne/Lake Biel through the Thielle canal. Thus all three lakes form a natural reservoir in order to retain overflow water from the river Aare that flows into Lake Bienne/Biel: in times of combined heavy rainfalls and glacier 
melting in the Alps, the peculiar situation arises that the water flows backwards through the Thielle and Broye canals, preventing an overflow of the Grand Marais.

<text>George V () is a station on Line 1 of the Paris Métro, under the Champs-Élysées.

==History==
The station was opened on 13 August 1900, almost a month after trains began running on the original section of Line 1 between Porte de Vincennes and Porte Maillot on 19 July 1900. It was originally called Alma, after the nearby street named in honour of the Battle of Alma in the Crimean War.

On 27 May 1920 the street and station were renamed after George V of the United Kingdom in appreciation of the United Kingdom&#x27;s support for France during World War I. The station entrance is located between Rue de Bassano and Avenue George V on the Champs-Élysées.

Like most of the stations on the line, between May 1963 and December 1964, the platforms were extended to 90 metres to accommodate trains of six cars with pneumatic bearings, intended to cope with severe chronic overloads. This extension is carried out by means of a crypt, as in five other stations, at the western end of the platforms in case. At the time, walls were clad in metal panels with white horizontal pillars and illuminated gilded advertising frames, later supplemented by yellow &quot;Motte&quot; style seats.

On November 21, 2003, to celebrate U.S. President George W. Bush&#x27;s visit to Buckingham Palace, Bush&#x27;s &quot;admirers&quot; renamed the station George W - Sovereign of Great Britain with name plate stickers.

As part of the automation of Line 1, the stopping point was renovated with the removal of the metalwork from the piers, and the platforms were raised between 29 October to 2 November 2008 to accommodate screen doors, which were installed by February 2011.

On September 19, 2022, the RATP replaced half of the nameplates on the platforms, for one day, to pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, whose funeral took place on the same day. The station was renamed &quot;Elizabeth II&quot;, the British sovereign being the granddaughter of King George V honoured at the station. The Queen&#x27;s name appears in capital letters with the words &quot;1926 - 2022&quot; written below in smaller characters, all on a black background as a sign of mourning instead of the usual midnight blue of the RATP name signs.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two entrances on either side of the Avenue des Champs-Élysées:
* Access 1 - &quot;Champs-Élysées&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase adorned with a stone balustrade by the architect Joseph Cassien-Bernard, located to the right of no. 118 of the said avenue;
* Access 2 - &quot;Avenue George-V&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase doubled by an escalator, located opposite no. 101, between Avenue George-V and Rue de Bassano.

In the access corridors to the platforms, some signs indicating the list of stations on the line to each terminus have the particularity of using the Helvetica font, tested in some stations of the network in the 1990s before the creation of the Parisine typography, which would later be generalized to all RATP signage.
===Station layout===

===Platforms===
George V is a standard station: it has two platforms 90 metres long separated by the metro tracks located in the centre and the vault is elliptical. A 15-metre-long crypt, whose ceiling rests on closely spaced pillars, has extended the stations length at its western end since the line was switched to six-car trains in the 1960s. The decoration is in the style used for the majority of metro stations, combined with the specific layouts of this line since its automation. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the &quot;Metro Renewal&quot; of the 2000s, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault and the tunnel exits and corridor outlets. The vault of the crypt is painted white, while its columns are covered with small dark tiles. The advertising frames are made of white ceramic and the name of the station is inscribed in Parisine font on backlit panels, most of which are incorporated into wooden boxes. The platforms are equipped with green &quot;Akiko&quot; seats and have half-height screen doors.
===Bus connections===
The station is served by line 73 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N11 and N24 of the Noctilien bus network.

<text>Magnolia liliiflora is a small tree native to southwest China (in Sichuan and Yunnan), but cultivated for centuries elsewhere in China and also Japan. Variously known by many names, including Mulan magnolia, purple magnolia, red magnolia, lily magnolia, tulip magnolia and woody-orchid, it was first introduced to English-speaking countries from cultivated Japanese origins, and is thus also sometimes called Japanese magnolia, though it is not native to Japan. It is now also planted as an ornamental in North America and Europe, though rather less often than its popular hybrid (see below).

It is a deciduous shrub, exceptionally a small tree, to 4m tall (smaller than most other magnolias), and blooms profusely in early spring with large pink to purple showy flowers, before the leaf buds open. It is one of the slowest-growing trees, with a growth rate of 15 - 30 centimeters (6–12 in) when young.

The cultivar &#x27;Nigra&#x27;, with flowers much deeper in colour than the species, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. It prefers an acid or neutral soil, in full sun or light shade.

This species is one of the parents of the popular hybrid saucer magnolia, &quot;M.&quot; × &quot;soulangeana&quot;, the other parent being the Yulan magnolia, &quot;M. denudata&quot;.

<text>Franklin D. Roosevelt () is a station on Line 1 and Line 9 of the Paris Métro. With more than nine million passengers annually (2019), it is the nineteenth busiest station in the Paris Métro system.

==History==

Originally, the stations on the two lines were separate. The Line 1 station opened as part of the first stage of the line between Porte de Vincennes and Porte Maillot on 19 July 1900 and was called Marbeuf up until 6 October 1942. It was named after the Rue Marbeuf, which in turn was named after the Marquise de Marbeuf, who had developed the area in the 1770s and was guillotined during the Reign of Terror. It was renamed Rond-Pont-des-Champs-Elysees until 30 October 1946.

The Line 9 station opened when the line was extended from Trocadéro to Saint-Augustin on 27 May 1923 and was called Rond-Point des Champs-Élysées or just Rond-Point. On 6 October 1942 a connection between the two stations was opened and the new station was renamed Marbeuf–Rond-Point des Champs-Élysées (or more often Champs-Élysées–Marbeuf). This new station became Franklin D. Roosevelt station in 1946 when the nearby Avenue Victor-Emmanuel III was renamed Franklin D. Roosevelt Avenue, in honour of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt who had been an ally of France during World War II, as opposed to Victor Emmanuel III, the king of Italy who, although allied with France during the First World War, had fought against France as king of Fascist Italy during the Second World War.

The station was renovated after the Second World War and the work introduced a new artistic technique known as &quot;gemmail&quot;, which is often called &quot;block glass&quot; or &quot;glass brick&quot; in English. Sometimes it is also called a &quot;station musée&quot; (station-museum). While one can find some of the glass brick along the platform for Line 9, more of it can be found in along the platform serving Line 1. The inauguration of the finished station involved a large ceremony on the night of 1 March 1957, with two ramps equipped with tables of food for the invited guests.

As part of the automation project on Line 1, its platforms were completely renovated in 2008.

===Access===
The station has seven entrances, the first two of which are only accessible from the platforms of Line 1, given that its stopping point was originally independent of that of Line 9.
* Access 1 - &quot;27, Avenue des Champs-Élysées&quot;;
* Access 2 - &quot;35, Avenue des Champs-Élysées&quot;;
* Access 3 - &quot;40, avenue des Champs-Élysées&quot;;
* Access 4 - &quot;44, Avenue des Champs-Élysées&quot;;
* Access 5 - &quot;3, rond-point des Champs-Élysées&quot;;
* Access 6 - &quot;7, rond-point des Champs-Élysées&quot;;
* Access 7 - &quot;60, Avenue Montaigne&quot;.
===Station layout===


===Platforms===
The platforms of the two lines are of standard configuration: there are two per stopping point, they are separated by the tracks located in the centre and the vault is elliptical. On the other hand, they are distinguished by their cultural layout, which itself differs between the two lines.

In line 1, the walls are clad in illuminated gilded metal panels, while the vault, as well as the tunnel exits, are clad in bevelled champagne-coloured tiles and fitted with cylindrical ceiling lamps decorated with bubble motifs. The platforms are tiled in anthracite grey and fitted with landing doors partially painted black. The name of the station is written directly on the metal panels in five different languages. On each platform, three touch screens display maps of the network, a map of the neighbourhood and a route finder. Five additional screens present advertising campaigns as well as cultural programmes. They will screen four two-minute films, produced by the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) as part of the International Year of Chemistry, and three films made by the artist Marko Echeverria as part of his work &quot;Passenger Landscapes&quot;. These amenities are complemented by black &quot;Akiko&quot; style seats.

On line 9, the metalwork is in the form of honey-coloured aluminium panelling comprising a set of brass-rimmed display cases. Many of them are now empty. Their partial closure reveals the old wall of the station still covered with its original bevelled white tiles, which also covers the vault while the tunnel exits are treated with metal wall facings. The name of the station appears in raised honey-coloured capital letters above the display windows. This layout is complemented by yellow &quot;Motte&quot; style seats and specific lighting canopies with metal slats in a shape close to a semicircle.
===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 28, 32 (in the direction of Gare de l&#x27;Est only), 42, 73, 80 and 93 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N11 and N24 of the Noctilien bus network.

<text>Concorde () is a station on Lines 1, 8, and 12 of the Paris Métro. Serving the Place de la Concorde in central Paris, it is located in the 1st arrondissement.

The station, along with Tuileries and Champs-Élysées-Clemenceau were closed from 17 June to 21 September for the 2024 Summer Olympics.

== History ==
The station opened on 13 August 1900, almost a month after trains began running on the initial section of line 1 between Porte de Vincennes and Porte Maillot on 19 July 1900. The station was the site of the first accident on the métro. On 19 October 1900, a current capture fault between the contact shoe on the train and the third rail resulted in a short circuit that started a fire. It caused a collision with the following train, injuring 29 passengers and 1 driver. 

Line 12&#x27;s platforms opened on 5 November 1910 as part of the original section of the Nord-Sud Company&#x27;s line A between Porte de Versailles and Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. 

Ezra Pound wrote in 1914 that his famous Imagist poem, &quot;In a Station of the Metro&quot;, was inspired by his impressions upon exiting a train at Concorde three years earlier. 

Line 8&#x27;s platforms opened on 12 March 1914 as part of the initial section of the line from &quot;Beaugrenelle&quot; (now Charles Michels on Line 10) to Opéra, seven months after the opening of the initial section of the line on 12 July 1913 as the platforms at &quot;Concorde&quot; and Invalides were not completed at the time. 

On 27 March 1931, line A became line 12 when It was taken over by its competitor, the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (CMP), incorporating it into the Paris Métro.

The original Nord-Sud decor of line 12&#x27;s station was removed in 1991 when it was redecorated by a new artwork by the artist Françoise Schein. It consisted of blue letters set on a white square tile that form the text of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The name of the station was also inscribed using the same letters albeit on navy blue tiles. The platforms&#x27; vault are covered with horizontal and vertical bands of navy blue tiles and have a speckled-grey tiling on its floors. Numerous metro stations around the world have also been designed with the same theme in mind by the same artist such as: Luz in São Paulo, Parvis de Saint-Gilles in Brussels, Parque in Lisbon, and Westhafen in Berlin. 

Up until 1997, line 8&#x27;s station had a single dead-end track alongside the platform towards Pointe du Lac. It was removed to create offices.

Over the weekend of 13–14 June 2009, line 1&#x27;s platforms were closed to raise its platform levels for the installation platform screen doors to improve passenger safety and for its eventual automation; it was installed in October 2010.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, between 11 April to 30 June 2016, line 8&#x27;s platforms and lighting were renovated and modernised, requiring a closure of its platforms during that time.

In 2019, the station was used by 6,115,023 passengers, making it the 58th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 2,617,251 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 75th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 3,401,219 passengers, making it the 86th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has seven accesses:

* Access 1: Jeu de Paume &quot;Jardin des Tuileries&quot;

All three lines have a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms, although the lower portion of the side walls on line 12&#x27;s platforms are vertical instead of elliptical, as with the other stations constructed by the Nord-Sud company (today on lines 12 and 13).

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by lines 42, 45, 72, 73, 84, and 94 of the RATP bus network, and at night, by lines N11 and N24 of the Noctilien bus network.

<doc id="502247" wikidata="Q710896" url="?curid=502247" title="Arthur O'Shaughnessy">
<text>Arthur William Edgar O&#x27;Shaughnessy (14 March 184430 January 1881) was a British poet and herpetologist. Of Irish descent, he was born in London. He is most remembered for his poem &quot;Ode&quot;, from his 1874 collection &quot;Music and Moonlight&quot;, which begins with the words &quot;We are the music makers, / And we are the dreamers of dreams&quot;, and which has been set to music by several composers including Edward Elgar (as &quot;The Music Makers)&quot;, Zoltán Kodály, Alfred Reed and, more recently, 808 State (: nephatiti) and Aphex Twin (&quot;Selected Ambient Works 85-92&quot;).

==Early life and herpetology==
In June 1861, at age 17, Arthur O&#x27;Shaughnessy received the post of transcriber in the library of the British Museum, reportedly through the influence of Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton. According to Sir Edmund Gosse, O&#x27;Shaughnessy was one of Bulwer Lytton&#x27;s many children born out of wedlock. Two years later, he became a herpetologist in the museum&#x27;s zoological department. From 1874 to his premature death, he described six new species of reptiles, and after his death, he was honoured in the specific name, &quot;oshaughnessyi&quot;, of four new species of lizards described by Albert Günther and George Albert Boulenger.

==Poetry==
However, O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s true passion was for literature. He published his first collection of poetry, &quot;Epic of Women&quot;, in 1870, followed two years later by &quot;Lays of France&quot; in 1872, and then &quot;Music and Moonlight&quot; in 1874. He is now best remembered for the first poem in his collection &quot;Music and Moonlight&quot;, entitled &quot;Ode&quot;, which begins with the words: &quot;We are the music makers, / And we are the dreamers of dreams&quot;.

O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s most quoted poem is his ode to the place of art, beginning 

&lt;poem&gt;We are the music-makers. 
And we are the dreamers of dreams.
Wandering by lone sea-breakers. 
And sitting by desolate streams;
World-losers and world-forsakers. 
On whom the pale moon gleams
Yet we are the movers and shakers 
Of the world for ever, it seems&lt;/poem&gt;

When he was 30, he married and did not produce any more volumes of poetry for the last seven years of his life. His last volume, &quot;Songs of a Worker&quot;, was published posthumously in 1881. O&#x27;Shaughnessy was both formally and aesthetically cutting-edge. For example, he is one of the few Pre-Raphaelite poets to have needed a steady income, and his corpus often explores the relationship between art and work. Unlike other Pre-Raphaelites, O&#x27;Shaughnessy saw poetry as the result of toil rather than the consequence of a moment&#x27;s frenetic inspiration. 

In his influential 1957 essay, 
T. S. Eliot gives O&#x27;Shaughnessy as an example of &quot;poets who have written just one, or only a few good poems,&quot; and says that, despite his uneven output, &quot;We Are the Music Makers&quot; belongs in any 19th century verse anthology.

==Personal life==
The artists Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Ford Madox Brown were among O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s circle of friends, and in 1873, he married Eleanor Marston, the daughter of author John Westland Marston and the sister of the poet Philip Bourke Marston. Together, he and his wife wrote a book of children&#x27;s stories, &quot;Toy-land&quot; (1875). They had two children together, both of whom died in infancy. 

Eleanor died in 1879, and O&#x27;Shaughnessy himself died in London two years later at the age of 36 from the effects of a &quot;chill&quot; after walking home from the theatre on a rainy night. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

==Legacy==
The anthologist Francis Turner Palgrave, in his work, &quot;The Golden Treasury&quot; declared that of the modern poets, despite his limited output, O&#x27;Shaughnessy had a gift that in some ways was second only to Tennyson and &quot;a haunting music all his own&quot;.

O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s translations of Parnassian poetry, and the influence of French decadence on his own work, were crucial in setting the stage for English-language decadence in the 1890s. Jordan Kistler writes that he was &quot;instrumental in bridging the gap between the Pre-Raphaelitism practised by poets such as D. G. Rossetti and William Morris in the 1870s and the aestheticism of the 1890s&quot;.

O&#x27;Shaughnessy is commemorated in the scientific names of four species of lizards: &quot;Calumma oshaughnessyi&quot;, &quot;Cercosaura oshaughnessyi&quot;, &quot;Enyalioides oshaughnessyi&quot;, and &quot;Pachydactylus oshaughnessyi&quot;.

<text>Tuileries () is a station on Line 1 of the Paris Métro. Located in the 1st arrondissement, it serves the Jardin des Tuileries.

The station, along with Concorde and Champs-Élysées-Clemenceau were closed from 17 June to 21 September for the 2024 Summer Olympics.

==Location==
The station is located underneath the Rue de Rivoli along the Jardin des Tuileries.

==History==
The station opened on 19 July 1900 with the entry into service of the first section of line 1 between Porte de Vincennes and Porte Maillot.

From the 1960s until the end of the 20th century, the station walls were clad in metal sheets with green horizontal posts and illuminated gold advertising frames, and the metal beams supporting the station ceiling were painted green, and the station was fitted with white &quot;Motte&quot; style seats. In 2000, to celebrate the métro&#x27;s centenary, the station was redecorated with wooden benches and wall covered with photo panels showing major events from 11 decades of history. In May 2023, new wall decoration was installed, showing drawings of trees, leaves and flowers, produced by artist Cyprien Chabert, and the platform signs showing the station name were updated with a green background color (instead of the usual blue).

As part of the automation of line 1, the station platforms were upgraded on the weekend of 18 and 19 October 2008, then fitted with platform screen doors in November 2010.

In 2019, 2,614,837 travelers entered this station which placed it in 199th position among metro stations for its usage.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has one entrance and one exit, located on the south sidewalk of the Rue de Rivoli at its intersection with the Rue du Vingt-Neuf-Juillet.

The two access points are situated on either side of an entrance gate to the Jardin des Tuileries. They are decorated with a Guimard entrance listed as a historical monument by a decree of 29 May 1978.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Tuileries is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks. The ceiling consists of a metal deck, the beams of which, silver in color, are supported by vertical walls. Since the introduction of the six-car train line in the 1960s, a 15-meter-long crypt, the ceiling of which rests on closely spaced pillars, extends the platform to its western end.

The decoration of the platforms, created for the centenary of the Metro and line 1, is &quot;cultural&quot; evoking the cultural history of the Metro in relation to that of the twentieth century thanks to thematic panels illustrated with iconic images by decades. The lighting is indirect, projected onto the walls and the vaults of the ceiling above the platforms. The beveled white ceramic tiles only cover the tunnel outlets, the outlets of the corridors and the walls under the crypt. The vault of the crypt is painted white, while its columns are covered with small flat white ceramic tiles laid vertically. The advertising frames are metallic and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates. The platforms are equipped with wooden slatted benches as well as platform screen doors.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by line 72 of the RATP Bus Network, and, at night, by lines N11 and N24 of the Noctilien network.

<doc id="502250" wikidata="Q1467113" url="?curid=502250" title="Palais Royal–Musée du Louvre station">
<text>Palais Royal–Musée du Louvre () is a station on Line 1 and Line 7 of the Paris Métro. Situated in the heart of the 1st arrondissement, it most notably serves the Palais-Royal, Comédie-Française and Louvre.

==Location==
The station is located under the Place du Palais-Royal, between the Palais-Royal and the Louvre Museum, the platforms being established (almost parallel):
* on Line 1, under the Rue de Rivoli;
* on Line 7, under Rue Saint-Honoré.

==History==
It is one of the eight original stations opened as part of the first section of Line 1 between Porte de Vincennes and Porte Maillot on 19 July 1900, under the name &quot;Palais Royal&quot;. The Line 7 platforms were opened on 1 July 1916 with the extension of the line from Opéra. It was the southern terminus of the line until it was extended to Pont Marie on 16 April 1926. From the 1970s until the 2010s, the station was modernized with the installation of orange ceramic tiles typical of the &quot;Mouton-Duvernet&quot; style, laid horizontally and aligned. The station was given its current name in 1989, soon after the opening of the new entrance to the Louvre Museum. It is named after the nearby Palais Royal and the Louvre.

The entrance on Place Colette was redesigned by Jean-Michel Othoniel, as the (Kiosk of the night-walkers), and completed in October 2000 for the centenary of the Métro. Two cupolas of the (one representing the day, the other the night) are made of colored glass beads that are threaded to structure of aluminum. They make an unexpected and original work in the very traditional environment of the &quot;Place Colette&quot;.

As part of the automation of line 1, its platforms were upgraded during the weekend of 7 and 8 February 2009, then fitted with platform screen doors in October 2010. The corridors of the station were renovated a second time on 31 December 2014, reviving the bevelled white tiling as part of the RATP &quot;un métro + beau&quot; program.

In 2018, the masonry benches on the platforms of line 7, fitted with flat brown tiles, part of the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style of the station, were covered with smaller orange flat tiles, thus being consistent with the seats and the lighting fittings, but no longer with the outlets of the corridors, as the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style originally wanted.

In 2019, 9,592,920 travelers entered this station, which placed it in 18th position for metro stations in terms of its usage.

Attractions accessible from this metro station include the Louvre, the &quot;Place du Carrousel&quot;, and the &quot;Carrousel du Louvre&quot; shopping mall.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
Since the renovation of the Louvre museum, each of the platforms of line 1 has been linked to an underground shopping mall, the Carrousel du Louvre, providing access to the museum&#x27;s underground hall. This is exit number 1.

The Kiosque des Noctambules is a contemporary work of art covering one of the metro entrances (exit 5) leading to Place Colette. Built for the centenary of the Paris metro and produced under the direction of the artist Jean-Michel Othoniel in a controversial style, it was inaugurated in October 2000.

The station has the following five accesses:
* Entrance 1: Louvre museum;
* Entrance 2: Place du Palais-Royal;
* Entrance 3: Rue de Rivoli;
* Entrance 4: Rue de Valois;
* Entrance 5: Place Colette, Kiosque des Noctambules.
Exits 2 and 3 are adorned with Guimard entrances, which are listed as historical monuments by the decree of 29 May 1978.

In an access corridor, another work of art, &quot;La Pensée et l&#x27;Âme Huicholes&quot; was the subject of an exchange intended to celebrate the thirty years of cooperation between the metro companies of Mexico City and Paris. The Parisian station thus houses an indigenous fresco, La Pensée et l&#x27;Âme huicholes, developed by the shaman Santos de la Torre and composed of two million pearls of 2 mm in diameter. In exchange, the City of Mexico received on 14 November 1998 a Hector Guimard-style entrance, which it installed at the Bellas Artes metro station.

===Station layout===

===Platforms===
The platforms of the two lines are of standard configuration. There are two per stopping point and are separated by the metro tracks located in the center.

Line 1 station platform is flush with the walls. The ceiling is made up of a metal deck, the beams of which are supported by vertical walls. A 15-meter-long crypt, the ceiling of which rests on closely spaced pillars, extends at western end for the introduction of the six-car train line in the 1960s. Furnished in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style, the station along with Opéra on line 3 and Concorde on line 8, they are only three stations decorated in this way, in purple, forming part of the lexicon of exceptional colors of this style. It is applied to light fittings, deck beams and seats. The benches, tunnel exits and platforms are fitted with large flat white tiles with a glazed appearance, while the outlets in the corridors are treated with classic beveled white tiles. The advertising frames are metallic and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates.

Line 7 station is curved and has an elliptical arch. However, it is distinguished by the lower part of the wall which are vertical and not curved, and its platforms are slightly offset from one another. Like those of line 1, they are furnished in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style with two orange light fittings, the corridor outlets in flat brown tiles and orange &quot;Motte&quot; seats. The latter are fixed on masonry benches covered with flat orange tiles of a smaller size than usual. This new tiling is therefore now consistent with the lighting strips and the seats they support; on the other hand, they are no longer in harmony with the tiles of the outlets of the corridors, neither by their size nor by their color, going against the original principles of the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style. The bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault and the tunnel exits. The stair stringers and the walkway are treated in flat white tiles aligned horizontally. The advertising frames are metallic and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamel plates.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 21, 27, 39, 67, 68, 69, 72 and 95 of the RATP Bus Network as well as by the tourist line OpenTour. At night, the station is served by lines N11 and N24 of the Noctilien bus network.

<text>Louvre–Rivoli () is a station on the Line 1 of the Paris Metro. Located in the 1st arrondissement, it is near the Louvre and Rue de Rivoli.

==Location==
The station is located under Rue de Rivoli, west of its intersection with Rue du Louvre. Approximately oriented east–west, it is inserted between the Palais Royal–Musée du Louvre and Châtelet metro stations.

==History==
The station was opened on 13 August 1900, almost a month after trains began running on the original section of Line 1 between Porte de Vincennes and Porte Maillot on 19 July 1900, under the name Louvre. It was given its current name in 1989, soon after the opening of the new entrance to the Louvre Museum at the simultaneously renamed Palais Royal–Musée du Louvre station.

Because of this proximity, a specific cultural decoration was put in place in September 1968, at the initiative of André Malraux, then Minister of Culture, in order to transform the station into an antechamber of the museum. On the platforms, copies of works of art from the Louvre museum are exhibited, while under the crypt were a historical plan of the Louvre castle and reproductions of old engravings from the palace. The platforms, devoid of advertising, are covered with Burgundy stone tiles, and the metal deck has a false ceiling above the platform. This layout is completed with backlit panels indicating the name of the station according to a specific typography, as well as glass benches available to travelers.

However, with the renovation of the museum carried out in 1989 and the relocation of its entrance in 1990 under the cour d&#x27;honneur via the Pyramid, led to the relocating the access by the metro to the Palais Royal station, renamed in 1989 Palais Royal–Louvre Museum. At the same time, the Louvre station became Louvre–Rivoli in order to highlight its service to the Rue de Rivoli, whose name commemorates a victory won by Napoleon Bonaparte over Austria in 1797.

On 1 May 1991, the station was vandalized in a spectacular manner by a group of taggers seeking thereby, to force the entry of their discipline into the institution represented by the Louvre. Unpublished media coverage ensued, making this action a famous stage in the development of graffiti in Paris.

As part of the automation of line 1, the station platforms were raised during the weekend of 21 and 22 February 2009 to accommodate platform doors, which were installed in 2010.

At the same time as the start of this full automation, the reproductions of works were withdrawn in 2011 with a view to renovating the station, operated by RATP as part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; program. Only the luminous name panels remain. In May 2013, however, posters indicated that the decoration was still in progress; in March 2014, the wall tiles were destroyed, revealing the original flat white earthenware tiles which were part of the experimental decorations tested in 1900 before the bevelled white tiles were subsequently chosen.

The work aimed to improve reception, comfort and safety, as well as the museum scenography, designed in partnership with the Louvre museum. The modernization includes, among other things, the replacement of the wall tiles with facings that are easier to maintain, new seats replacing the glass seats in order to meet safety and accessibility standards, the elimination of the original false ceiling and the installation of a new lighting system. The station reopened its doors on 26 November 2015 after twelve weeks of redevelopment work that required its closure to the public.

On 24 March 2016, the cultural facilities including nine casts exhibited on the platforms were unveiled. The redevelopment of the station further includes a specific SIEL display device.

In 2019, according to RATP estimates, the station&#x27;s annual attendance was 2,633,369, which placed it in 198th position among metro stations for its attendance out of 302.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has a single entrance called &quot;Rue de l&#x27;Amiral-de-Coligny&quot;, leading to the right of no. 8 in the street via a fixed staircase at the intersection of Rue du Louvre and Rue de Rivoli. It is decorated with a Guimard entrance, which is listed as a historic monument by the decree of 12 February 2016.

===Station layout===


===Platform===
Louvre–Rivoli is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks. Established flush with the wall, it has a metal ceiling whose beams are supported by vertical piers. A 15-meter-long crypt, the ceiling of which rests on closely spaced pillars, extends it to its western end since the introduction of the six-car train line in the 1960s.

The decoration is cultural and designed as an antechamber to the Louvre. Developed in partnership with the latter, it showcases reproductions of statues from Antiquity or the Middle Ages, displayed directly on the platforms. Porcelain stoneware wall claddings cover the walls, devoid of advertising, while the floor and tunnel exits are tiled in anthracite gray, the crypt painted white. The backs of the display cases, the alcoves and the pedestals are covered with a dark material to simulate a case, and the ceiling is painted entirely in black. The lighting is provided by spotlights oriented towards the walls, and the name of the station appears on backlit panels, in white capital letters on a black background, in a specific serif typeface. The platforms are equipped with black &quot;Akiko&quot; seats and have platform screen doors.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 21, 67, 69, 72, 74 and 85 of the RATP Bus Network. At night, it is served by lines N11, N15, N16 and N24 of the Noctilien network.

<text>Châtelet station () is a station of the Paris Métro and Île-de-France&#x27;s RER commuter rail service, located in the centre of medieval Paris, on the border between the 1st and 4th arrondissements. It serves RER A, B and D, as well as lines 1, 4, 7, 11, and 14 of the Paris Métro; it is the southern terminus of Line 11. The station is made up of two parts connected by a long corridor: lines 7 and 11 under the Place du Châtelet and the Quai de Gesvre (site of the original medieval river port of Paris), next to the Seine; lines 1, 4 and 14 towards Rue Saint-Denis and the Rue de Rivoli.

Châtelet is connected by another long underground corridor to the southern end of the RER platforms at , the northern end of which is again connected to the métro station . The distance from Line 7 at Châtelet to the RER lines at Châtelet–Les Halles is approximately . It is the ninth-busiest station on the métro system.

==Location==
 The station has two parts connected to each other by a long corridor equipped with two moving walkways.

They serve under the Place du Châtelet:
* line 7 under the Quai de Gesvres (between Pont-Neuf and Pont Marie);
* line 11 under Avenue Victoria (terminus preceding or following Hôtel de Ville station).

Further north, they serve:
* line 1 under Rue de Rivoli (between Louvre - Rivoli and Hôtel de Ville);
* line 4 under Rue des Halles (between Les Halles and Cité);
* line 14 diagonally between these two previous streets, parallel to line 4 (between Pyramides and Gare de Lyon stations).

The station is connected, from the northern part, by another corridor comprising three moving walkways, to the Châtelet–Les Halles RER station and, through this, to the Les Halles metro station of line 4 .

==History==

The station was opened on 6 August 1900, three weeks after trains began running on the original section of line 1 between Porte de Vincennes and Porte Maillot on 19 July 1900. The line 4 platforms were opened on 21 April 1908 as part of the original section of the line from Porte de Clignancourt to &quot;Châtelet&quot;. It was the southern terminus of line 4 until the opening of the connecting section of the line under the Seine to Raspail on 9 January 1910.

It is named after the Place du Châtelet, which is named after the Grand Châtelet, a castle over the northern approach to the old Pont au Change over the Seine to the Île de la Cité, which was demolished by Napoléon in 1802. &quot;Châtelet&quot; is a medieval French term for &quot;barbican&quot;, a small castle that commands (overlooks) a bridge or defile.

The line 7 platforms were opened on 16 April 1926 as part of the line&#x27;s extension from Palais Royal to Pont Marie with the name &quot;Pont Notre-Dame-Pont au Change&quot;. It had no direct connection with &quot;Châtelet&quot;. On 15 April 1934 a connecting corridor was opened to the platforms of lines 1 and 4 and the line 7 station was renamed. The line 11 platforms were opened near the line 7 platforms on 28 April 1935 as part of the original section of the line from &quot;Châtelet&quot; to Porte des Lilas.

From May 1963 to December 1964, like the majority of the stations of line 1, its platforms were lengthened to 90 meters to accommodate trainsets of six cars to cope with significant chronic overloads. On 21 October 1964, the station was the first to be equipped with moving walkways, 132 meters long, in the corridor connecting its northern and southern parts. Like most of the stations of line 4, between October 1966 and October 1967, the platforms of the latter were in turn extended to 90 meters, in order to accommodate trains of six pneumatically-driven carriages.

On 9 December 1977 the Châtelet – Les Halles RER station was opened with a connecting corridor with a moving walkway to &quot;Châtelet&quot;. The station was partially modernized with the installation of small fine flat ceramic tiles, yellow-orange and white, in the connecting corridors of its northern part. The same year, a fresco by the French artist Hervé Mathieu-Bachelot, entitled &quot;En rouge et en blanc&quot;, was installed on a pedestal not far from the main accesses to line 4.

In 1985, the corridor connecting the northern and southern parts of the station also receives two identical mosaics by the same artist: &quot;Obliques enrubannées&quot; (work produced with André Ropion).

Like a third of the stations in the network between 1974 and 1984, all the stopping points are fitted out in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style, in yellow accompanied by flat white tiles for line 1, in red with flat white tiles on line 4, in green with the conservation of the original bevelled tiles for line 7 and in blue with the maintenance of white bevelled ceramic tiles on line 11.

As part of the automation of line 1, its station was renovated in 2009, losing its yellow &quot;Motte&quot; decoration. From the 7 and 8 March 2009, the line 1 platforms were raised during the automation of line 1, including the installation of platform screen doors in November 2010.

The line 14 platforms were opened near the line 1 and 4 platforms on 15 October 1998 as part of the original section of the line from Madeleine to Bibliothèque François Mitterrand. On 7 and 8 March 2009 the line 1 platforms were restored during the automation of line 1, including the installation of platform screen doors.

From 16 April 2013 to 25 February 2016, the corridors ensuring the connection between lines 4 and 14, which have become too cramped and congested, were widened and doubled, each with an ascending escalator. The openings of the fixed staircase, that encroached on the platforms of line 4 were then eliminated in favor of a wide opening in each side wall.

From 2014 until 15 February 2016, all the connecting corridors, except those giving access to line 14, were modernized as part of the RATP &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; program. The station has since been divided into two distinct sectors called Sector Rivoli and Sector Seine, each distinguished by a symbol represented in relief on the ceramic friezes above the bevelled white tiling: those of the former, of bronze color, have patterns suggesting the lines of buildings on rue de Rivoli, while those on the latter, sky blue in color, are adorned with waves reminiscent of the Seine. In addition, the RER station and the neighboring Les Halles station are also referred to as Sector Forum.

In certain corridors, the bevelled white ceramic tiles have for the first time dimensions measuring twice those of the classic format, similar to the tiles at Porte d&#x27;Orléans station on line 4, and which will subsequently be deployed at Maisons-Alfort - Les Juilliottes on line 8 (from 2016) and Basilique de Saint-Denis on line 13 (in 2018). Subsequently, the names of the two sectors will be gradually added to the left of the nominative panels of the platforms (starting with line 11 in 2018 then line 1 in 2019).

The renovation of the connecting corridor from the Rivoli Sector to the Seine Sector was completed later, at the beginning of 2017. It includes in particular, the replacement of the moving walkways, now shortened, as well as the installation of wall panels intended to receive event frescoes and decorations, a specific lighting fixture, the color of which juggles between cold white, warm white and amber. The double mosaic is no longer visible.

As part of the automation of Line 4, its stopping point has been modernized since the second half of 2016, losing its red &quot;Motte&quot; style. Its platforms were raised from 27 November 2017 to 30 March 2018.

As part of the extension of Line 11 to Rosny-Bois Perrier, its terminus underwent major works from 15 March to the end of December 2019, during which time the western terminus of the line was transferred to the neighboring Hôtel de Ville. The platforms were raised, consolidated and tiled, the tracks and signage renewed and the connecting staircase doubled. The reversing headshunt is extended to the right of the central track, under the cellar of the Terminus Châtelet restaurant, in order to be able to accommodate trainsets of five cars.

In the course of the first half of 2019, the platforms of line 7 will have their masonry-style &quot;Motte&quot; benches in green tiling removed, as will the characteristic &quot;coque&quot; seats, in favor of contemporary seats, which were installed during the summer.

===Usage===
In 2019, according to RATP estimates, 10.8 million travelers entered this station, which places it in 12th position among metro stations for its use out of 302.

===Station layout===
===Platforms===
All lines except line 11 have standard configuration stations, with two platforms framing two tracks under an elliptical arch.

The platforms of line 1 are decorated with white and flat ceramic tiles that cover the vault and the tunnel exits. The lighting is of the &quot;Gaudin&quot; type typical of the metro revival of the 2000s and the platforms are equipped with platform doors. The advertising frames are metallic and the walls are equipped with wooden panels crowned with the name of the station, back-lit and written in Parisine font.

The platforms of line 4 are decorated in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style in red, with flat tiles from the 1970s until 2018. As part of the automation of the line, these platforms were still under construction in 2019, the Andreu-Motte style having been entirely cast out.

The platforms of line 7 are decorated in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style in an apple green color, associated with the original decoration of the CMP, characterized by bevelled white tiles, advertising frames in honey-colored earthenware. The name of the station is supplemented by its old name, (Pont au Change), also written in earthenware. At the eastern end of the station, the unusually high vault gives way to a footbridge spanning the tracks. In 1642, Louis XIII ceded land to the Marquis de Gesvres and demanded that he establish, under the platform which today bears his name, a gallery made up of arcades overlooking the Seine. Nicknamed &quot;cagnards&quot;, these unsanitary vaults quickly became a den for the thugs of the capital. After being condemned in the 19th century, they were brought to light in 1921 during the construction of the metro. At the request of the Commission du Vieux Paris, the structure was preserved and integrated into the station, which explains this unusual configuration.

The line 11 station is special: it has two platforms flanking two tracks as well as a third track on the south side, due to its role as terminus. It is decorated in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style in blue color. The name of the station is indicated on enamel plaques. In 2018, these were renewed, from a font in capital letters, to the Parisine font, and losing the old subtitle Avenue Victoria.

Line 14 station has the amenities specific to this line with a sober and modern decoration combining wood and concrete. It has a monumental vault and the platforms are equipped with landing doors.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 21, 38, 47, 58, 67, 69, 70, 72, 74, 75, 76, 85 and 96 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N11, N12, N13, N14, N15, N16, N21, N22, N23, N24, N122, N144 and N145 of the Noctilien bus network.

<doc id="502255" wikidata="Q6565051" url="?curid=502255" title="List of chancellors and vice-chancellors of British universities">
<text>This following is a current list of the chancellors, vice-chancellors and visitors of universities in the United Kingdom. The chancellor is the ceremonial head of a university, while the vice-chancellor is the chief academic officer and chief executive; some universities have only a vice-chancellor but no chancellor. A few universities use other titles for their ceremonial head, e.g., &quot;president&quot; at the Royal Agricultural University and &quot;rector&quot; at Brunel, University of London. Two English universities (UCL and Imperial) have chief executives who do not use the title vice-chancellor. In Scotland, the chief executive is titled the principal and vice-chancellor.

The visitor is appointed by the founder of a charitable institution to oversee the distribution of the founder&#x27;s bounty; in the case of universities, this is often the sovereign, in which case the office is usually carried out by the Lord President of the Council. In general, only universities incorporated as chartered or statutory corporations have visitors, i.e. most pre-1992 institutions but not post-1992 universities. Scottish universities do not have visitors, nor do the two ancient universities of England, which are civil corporations.

==England, Wales and Northern Ireland==

==Scotland==

At Scottish universities, the chief executive is styled the principal (formally principal and vice-chancellor). The ancient universities of Scotland, and the University of Dundee, have a Rector, elected by the student body.

The original station on 21 April 1908 as part of the first section of the line from Châtelet to Porte de Clignancourt to serve Les Halles (old markets). The station was rebuilt and put into service on 3 October 1977 about ten metres further east to interchange with the new Châtelet–Les Halles RER station on RER A, RER B and RER D which opened on 9 December 1977. This RER station is connected by underground corridors to the Métro station Châtelet on Line 1, Line 4, Line 7, Line 11 and Line 14; Les Halles is therefore also connected with Châtelet. Line 4 is the only line that serves Les Halles; it also serves Châtelet station.

The walking distance from Line 4 at Les Halles to the far end of Châtelet (Line 7) is about . Les Halles serves the underground shopping centre Forum des Halles. One of the floors of the Forum des Halles contains the Métro station. As part of the automation of Line 4, its platforms were upgraded during the weekend of 10 and 11 June 2017, in order to receive landing doors. These are installed between the end of January and mid-February 2020.

In 2019, 16,069,170 users entered the station which placed it in ninth position among stations in the Paris metropolitan network (out of 302).

<text> (, literally &quot;City Hall&quot;) is a rapid transit station on lines 1 and 11 of the Paris Métro. It is named after the nearby Hôtel de Ville de Paris (City Hall) and is located within the fourth arrondissement of Paris.

==History==
Hôtel de Ville is one of the eight original stations opened as part of the first stage of line 1 between Porte de Vincennes and Porte Maillot on 19 July 1900. The line 11 platforms opened as part of the original section of the line from Châtelet to Porte des Lilas on 28 April 1935. During the same decade, the platforms of line 1 were extended to 105 metres to cater for 7-car trains which ultimately did not materialise.

A plaque near the platforms of line 1 marks the 50th anniversary of the strike organised by 3000 employees of the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (CMP), the operator of the métro then, on 16 August 1944 against the Nazis during the occupation of Paris and was triggered by the French Forces to liberate the capital.

In 1974, the original Guimard entrance at rue de Lobau was moved to Abbesses, and is one of the only two remaining glass-covered &quot;dragonfly&quot; entrances, known as &quot;édicules&quot; (the other is at Porte Dauphine). It was listed as a historical monument on 25 July 1965.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the platforms of line 11 were renovated and modernised on 2005.

During the automation of line 1, the platforms of line 1 had undergone a series of upgrades. Over the weekend of 21–22 March 2009, its platforms were closed to raise its platform levels for the installation platform edge doors to improve passenger safety and for automation which were done in April 2010. During the construction period, the platforms of line 11 remained open, allowing for westward travel to Châtelet, where a transfer to line 1 was possible. The line was fully automated in December 2012.

As part of modernization works for the extension of Line 11 to in 2023 for the Grand Paris Express, the station was closed from 8 September 2018 to 12 October 2018 to raise its platform levels and its surface tiled to accommodate the new rolling stock that will be used (MP 14) to accommodate the expected increase in passengers and to improve the station&#x27;s accessibility. From 18 March 2019 to 16 December 2019, the station acted as line 11&#x27;s western terminus when its original terminus, &quot;Châtelet&quot;, was closed for 9 months to lengthen the platforms to cater for 5-car trains as it could only cater for 4 at the time. Hence, trains arrived and departed from the western platform, usually used for trains heading to &quot;Châtelet&quot;, with the other platform temporarily not in use. On 11 December 2020, an additional entrance was opened at rue du Temple.

In 2019, the station was used by 12 307 363 passengers, making it the 11th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 5,673,100 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 13th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

<text>Bastille () is a station on Line 1, Line 5 and Line 8 of the Paris Métro. Located under the Place de la Bastille and near the former location of the Bastille, it is situated on the border of the 4th, 11th and 12th arrondissement.

==Location==
The station is located on Place de la Bastille, the platform being established:
* Line 1, south of the square, outside the Canal Saint-Martin (between Saint-Paul and Gare de Lyon stations);
* Line 5, west of the square between Boulevard Richard-Lenoir and Boulevard Bourdon (between Bréguet-Sabin and Quai de la Rapée stations, not including the Arsenal ghost station);
* Line 8, north of the square between Boulevard Beaumarchais and Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine (between Chemin Vert and Ledru-Rollin stations).

==History==
The Line 1 station opened as part of the first stage of the line between Porte de Vincennes and Porte Maillot on 19 July 1900.

It derives its name from the Place de la Bastille, symbolic place of the French Revolution, where the old fortress of the Bastille was destroyed between 14 July 1789 and 14 July 1790.

On 17 December 1906, the station of Line 5 was opened when the line was extended from Gare de Lyon to Lancry (now known as &quot;Jacques Bonsergent&quot;). The Line 8 platforms were opened on 5 May 1931 when the line was extended from Richelieu – Drouot to Porte de Charenton.

During the 1960s, the platform of Line 5 was renovated in the &quot;Mouton-Duvernet&quot; style with two-toned orange-tinted ceramic tiles, a white painted vault and characteristic lighting strips. Subsequently, they were equipped with seats &quot;Motte&quot; orange.

The platforms of Line 1 have been upgraded as part of its full automation. They are the last to be equipped with landing doors, in April 2011, because of the technical difficulty presented by the pronounced curve at their western end.

It saw 13,172,392 passengers enter in 2018, which places its attendance at the 10th position of all metro stations.

==Services for passengers==
===Access===
The station has nine entrances from Place de la Bastille:
* Boulevard Henri-IV;
* Boulevard Bourdon;
* Rue de Lyon;
* Boulevard de la Bastille;
* Opera Bastille;
* Jardin du Port-de-l&#x27;Arsenal;
* Hospital Quinze-Vingts;
* Rue de la Roquette;
* Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine.

The access leading to the Rue de Lyon was decorated with a Hector Guimard designed entrance registered as a historic monument on 29 May 1978. However, it was later moved to a metro station Boulevard Beaumarchais.

===Station layout===
===Platforms===
The stations of the lines meeting at Bastille all have side platforms.

The station belonging to Line 1 are very particular for several reasons; the station of this line is established on a very tight curve and counter curve, partly underground and part above ground. The western end of the line 1 platforms have the sharpest curve used by passenger trains on the Métro, with a radius of only . The line 1 platforms, at long, are significantly longer than the average Métro platform length. The latter part overlooks the Canal Saint-Martin that, at this point, passes from being underground to open air. The Line 1 station is also particular in that the remnants of a former narrow island platform are visible. The station is also noted for being the only station in the system for being partially underground and elevated. Finally, the tracks and platforms are partly sloped. The ceiling of the east end, which is underground, consists of a metal deck, the silver beams are supported by vertical walls. The decoration of these walls and tunnel exits are &quot;cultural&quot; evoking the French Revolution thanks to a unique ceramics created by Liliane Belembert and Odile Jacquot in May 1989. Part of this fresco was replaced by a plastic display on automation of the line on the occasion of this operation (in the platforms towards La Défense). The open-air part of the platform towards Château de Vincennes has floor-to-ceiling windows offering a view of the Saint-Martin canal opening onto the Bassin de l&#x27;Arsenal. Bevelled white ceramic tiles cover only the outlets of the corridors. The name of the station is written in Parisine typeface on enamelled plates. The platforms, equipped with glass edge doors, are devoid of advertisements and seats.

The platforms of Line 5 are underground and have an elliptical vault. The decoration is the style used for the majority of metro stations. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of &quot;l&#x27;Operation Espace Métro 2000&quot;, and the white ceramic tiles are covered the walls, the vault, the tunnel exits and the outlets of the corridors. The advertising frames are of white ceramics and the name of the station is written in Parisine typeface on enamelled plates. The seats, in &quot;Akiko&quot; style, are burgundy. Foundations of one of the counterscarp walls of the old Bastille prison, discovered during the construction of the line in 1905, are visible on the platform in the direction of Bobigny-Pablo Picasso. Metal lines drawn on the ground mark the contours of the building on the two platforms. The station also exhibits various views of the ancient fortress.

The platforms of Line 8 are also underground under an elliptical vault. They are furnished in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style with two orange light canopies, benches and outlets in the corridors treated with flat brown tiles and &quot;Motte&quot; orange seats. These arrangements are married with the flat white ceramic tiles that cover the walls, vault and tunnel exits, making this station one of the few to have the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; preserved style. Advertising frames are metallic and the name of the station is Parisine typeface on enamelled plates. The station is distinguished however by the lower part of its walls which are vertical and not elliptical.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 29, 69, 76, 86, 87 and 91 of the RATP Bus Network as well as the OpenTour tourist line. At night, it is served by lines N01, N02, N11, N16 and N144 of the Noctilien bus network.

<text>The Gare de Lyon, officially Paris Gare de Lyon (), is one of the seven large mainline railway stations in Paris, France. It handles about 148.1 million passengers annually according to the estimates of the SNCF in 2018, with SNCF railways and the RER D accounting for around 110 million and the RER A accounting for 38 million, making it the second-busiest station of France after the Gare du Nord and one of the busiest in Europe.

The station is located in the 12th arrondissement, on the right bank of the river Seine, in the east of Paris. Opened in 1849, it is the northern terminus of the Paris–Marseille railway. It is named after the city of Lyon, a stop for many long-distance trains departing here, most en route to the South of France. The station is served by high-speed TGV trains to Southern and Eastern France, Switzerland, Germany, Italy and Spain. The station also hosts regional trains and the RER and also the Gare de Lyon Métro station.

Main line trains depart from 32 platforms in two distinct halls: Hall 1, which is the older train shed, contains tracks labelled with letters from A to N, while the modern addition of Hall 2 contains tracks which are numbered from 5 to 23. There are a further four platforms for the RER underneath the main lines.

==History==
Lyon railway station had been under construction since 1847. It was officially opened to the public on 12 August 1849 under the name &quot;Railway station from Paris to Montereau&quot; (fr. Embarcadère de chemin de fer de Paris à Montereau). It was a boardwalk building designed by architect under the direction of Baron Haussmann, and at the time of its construction it was awaiting arbitration between the French state and the first Compagnie des chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée (PLM) company over its management. PLM did not like the fact that Mazas prison was being built next to the station. The company hoped that it could extend the railroad branch line to Place de la Bastille. But instead of that, Lyon Street (fr. Rue de Lyon) was laid out between the station and Place de la Bastille. The station was expanded many times as the volume of rail traffic increased.

As the station became unsuitable for further expansion, a second Gare de Lyon building was constructed in 1855 by the design of the architect François-Alexis Cendrier. New building was operated by the newly established Paris à Lyon (PL) railway company. The station was built on a high embankment to protect it from the floods of the Seine. It had only five tracks, occupying a large hall long and wide. A portico to the right of the entrance to the arrival hall connected the station itself to the Bâtiment X, the central administration building on the side facing Boulevard Mazas. The station was partially destroyed by fire during the Paris Commune in 1871 and later rebuilt.

On 8 July 1887, General Georges Boulanger&#x27;s departure from Paris triggered a demonstration: 8,000 people stormed the train station and covered the train with &quot;Il reviendra&quot; (He will return) posters and delayed its departure by an hour and a half.

By 1900, in time for the 1900 World&#x27;s Fair, a new thirteen-track Gare de Lyon building was constructed, designed by the Toulon architect Marius Toudoire and decorated with a large fresco by the Marseille artist Jean-Baptiste Olive, depicting some of the cities to which one could take a train from this station. It was inaugurated on 6 April 1901 by Émile Loubet, president of the Third Republic.

On multiple levels, it is considered a classic example of the architecture of its time. Most notable is the large clock tower atop one corner of the station, similar in style to the clock tower of the Palace of Westminster, home to Big Ben. The station houses the Le Train Bleu restaurant, which has served drinks and meals to travellers and other guests since 1901 in an ornately decorated setting.

On 27 June 1988, in the Gare de Lyon rail accident, a runaway train crashed into a stationary rush-hour train, killing 56 people and injuring a further 55. A fire broke out on 28 February 2020, that was reportedly started by Congolese protesters. The station was completely evacuated.

On 18 December 2021, the station became the terminus of the newly-inaugurated Milan–Paris Frecciarossa.

On 3 February 2024, a stabbing at the station injured 3 people.

<doc id="502286" wikidata="Q573840" url="?curid=502286" title="Mount Mansfield">
<text>Mount Mansfield is the highest mountain in Vermont, reaching an elevation of above sea level. Located in the northwest of the state, it is also the highest peak in the Green Mountains. Its summit is located within the town of Underhill in Chittenden County; the ridgeline, including some secondary peaks, extends into the town of Stowe in Lamoille County, and the mountain&#x27;s flanks also reach into the town of Cambridge.

When viewed from the east or west, this mountain has the appearance of a (quite elongated) human profile, with distinct forehead, nose, lips, chin, and Adam&#x27;s apple. These features are most distinct when viewed from the east; unlike most human faces, the chin is the highest point. The Abenaki describe the mountain as having the appearance of a less human profile: that of a moose. 

Mount Mansfield is one of three spots in Vermont where true alpine tundra survives from the Ice Ages. A few acres exist on Camel&#x27;s Hump and Mount Abraham nearby and to the south, but Mount Mansfield&#x27;s summit still holds about . In 1980, the Mount Mansfield Natural Area was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.

Located in Mount Mansfield State Forest, the mountain is used for various recreational and commercial purposes. &quot;The Nose&quot; is home to transmitter towers for a number of regional radio and TV stations. There are many hiking trails, including the Long Trail, which traverses the main ridgeline. In addition, the east flank of the mountain is used by the Stowe Mountain Resort for winter skiing. A popular tourist activity is to drive the toll road (a steep, mostly unpaved road with several hairpin turns) from the Stowe Base Lodge to &quot;The Nose&quot; and then hike along the ridge to &quot;The Chin.&quot;

== Name ==
Prior to the mid-eighteenth century, the mountain was known by its Abenaki name, Mozôdebiwajok, which translates to Moosehead Mountain. The name of the mountain today comes from the dissolved town of Mansfield, Vermont, in which the mountain was located (its territory was later divided between the towns of Underhill and Stowe), but the source of the town&#x27;s name is the subject of some dispute.

Several of the original grantees of the land in Mansfield were from Mansfield, Connecticut, which in turn is known to have been named for Moses Mansfield, one of the chief landowners there. However, Benning Wentworth, the governor of the British colony of New Hampshire, issued a charter to a group of grantees in what he dubbed the town of Mansfield, possibly for a chief justice of England, Lord Mansfield (a British judge who deemed slavery illegal on British soil in 1772). 
Wentworth had good reason to honor Lord Mansfield by naming a town after him: Mansfield and another English official had jointly ruled in 1752 that the land between the Connecticut River and Lake Champlain should be considered part of the Wentworth-governed royal province of New Hampshire, and not of New York, which also claimed that territory.

The Town of Mansfield was formed before anyone involved had visited the site; when the townsite was surveyed, it was discovered to be mostly mountainside. Although a few hardy pioneers settled in the town&#x27;s few lowlands, the town was dissolved by degrees, with the portion generally west of the mountain being annexed to Underhill in 1839, the eastern portion to Stowe in 1848 after a vote of the citizenry. The dividing line did not run exactly along the ridge of the mountain; thus, the Chin is in Underhill and the Nose in Stowe.
==Geology and soils==
The dominant bedrock of Mt. Mansfield is a mica-albite-quartz schist common to the Green Mountains, with mica being the most abundant mineral. Layers of quartzite are found locally. The soils, mostly podzol, are stony with fine-earth fractions grading through textures of fine sandy loam, loam and silt loam; they are mapped mostly as Londonderry, Lyman, Peru and Tunbridge Series with considerable areas of rock outcropping around the summit.

== Topography ==
The ridge which forms the &quot;head&quot; of the &quot;man&quot; is aligned generally north and south. The &quot;Adam&#x27;s apple&quot; is on the north end of the ridge, and the &quot;forehead&quot; to the south. From north of the mountain, looking south, this ridge appears as a triangular peak. At the northeastern portion of the mountain, there are cliffs. At the base of these cliffs (on the western side of the Notch Road, Vermont Route 108), there is a honeycomb network of talus caves. There are cliffs on the eastern side of the Notch Road as well. These two sets of facing cliffs are separated by at their base.

== Skiing ==

Mt. Mansfield is the home of Stowe Mountain Resort, one of the oldest ski areas in the United States. Along with other expert trails, a group of trails, known as the &quot;Front Four&quot;, are Goat, Starr, National and Liftline. They have steep pitches, many natural hazards (rocks and trees), and little grooming. There are also cross country ski trails around the base of the mountain and on its lower slopes. The Bruce Trail descends the east side of the mountain while the Teardrop Trail descends west side. In addition to Stowe Mountain resort, Skiing is also available at the nearby Smugglers&#x27; Notch Resort.

== Gallery ==

==Climate==
Mount Mansfield is located in a boreal temperate rainforest and receives more than 80 inches of precipitation each year on average and has a humid boreal climate (Dfc). Lower elevations of the mountain have a humid continental climate

Summer days on the mountain are warm coupled with cool nights, while winters are long, cold and snowy, lasting from November through April and with annual snowfall averaging . The highest daily snowfall recorded was and occurred on March 15, 2017. The highest snow depth recorded was and occurred on April 2 during the very snowy winter of 1969. According to the NOAA, snowfall has been recorded on the summit for every month of the year. Mount Mansfield averages 197.7 nights at or below annually. Extreme temperatures ranges from on May 28, 2020 to on January 9, 1968.

<doc id="502289" wikidata="Q1385992" url="?curid=502289" title="Michael Wilding">
<text>Michael Charles Gauntlet Wilding (23 July 1912 – 8 July 1979) was an English stage, television, and film actor. He is best known for a series of films he made with Anna Neagle; he also made two films with Alfred Hitchcock, &quot;Under Capricorn&quot; (1949) and &quot;Stage Fright&quot; (1950); and he guest starred on Hitchcock&#x27;s TV show in 1963. He was married four times, including to Elizabeth Taylor, with whom he had two sons.

==Biography==
Born in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, England, and educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital, Wilding left home at age 17 and trained as a commercial artist. He went to Europe when he was 20 and supported himself in Europe by doing sketches. He wanted to get into designing sets for films and approached a London film studio in 1933 looking for work. They invited him to come to work as an extra.

==Acting career==
Wilding appeared as an extra in British films such as &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; (1933), &quot;Heads We Go&quot; (1933), and &quot;Channel Crossing&quot; (1933). He caught the acting bug and decided to make it a career. He reportedly appeared in an Austrian film called &quot;Pastorale&quot;.

He made his stage debut in &quot;The Ringer&quot; in 1934 for the Watford Repertory Company and made his London stage debut in &quot;Chase the Ace&quot; the following year. He could be spotted in the films &quot;Late Extra&quot; (1935), &quot;When Knights Were Bold&quot; (1936), and &quot;Wedding Group&quot; (1936). He was in two musicals on stage, &quot;Spread It Abroad&quot; and &quot;Home and Beauty&quot;.

In 1937–38 he toured Australia and New Zealand with Fay Compton&#x27;s stage company. The plays included &quot;Personal Appearance&quot;, &quot;Victoria Regina&quot;, &quot;Tonight at Eight Thirty&quot; and &quot;George and Margaret&quot;. While in Australia he filmed a prologue for &quot;Personal Appearance&quot;.

Back in England he appeared in the first Gate Revue, then followed this with another revue, &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It&quot; and a pantomime, &quot;Who&#x27;s Taking Liberty&quot;.

He had bigger film parts in &quot;There Ain&#x27;t No Justice&quot; (1939), &quot;Convoy&quot; (1940), and &quot;Tilly of Bloomsbury&quot; (1940). He had a good role in &quot;Sailors Three&quot; (1940), and &quot;Sailors Don&#x27;t Care&quot; (1940).

Wilding had a leading role in &quot;Spring Meeting&quot; (1941) but was back to support parts in &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1941). His films grew more prestigious: &quot;Kipps&quot; (1941), &quot;Cottage to Let&quot; (1941), &quot;Ships with Wings&quot; (1941), &quot;The Big Blockade&quot; (1941), &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; (1942), &quot;Secret Mission&quot; (1942), and &quot;Undercover&quot; (1943). He played in &quot;Quiet Weekend&quot; on stage for a year. In 1943 he performed for the troops in Gibraltar with John Gielgud.

===Stardom===
Wilding finally became a film name with &quot;Dear Octopus&quot; (1943). He followed it with &quot;English Without Tears&quot; (1944).

====Collaboration with Anna Neagle====
What really made him a star was appearing opposite Anna Neagle in &quot;Piccadilly Incident&quot; (1946). Director Herbert Wilcox had wanted Rex Harrison or John Mills and had only taken Wilding reluctantly. However, once he saw the rushes he signed Wilding to a long-term contract. &quot;Piccadilly Incident&quot; was the second most popular film at the British box office in 1946. After co-starring with Sally Gray in &quot;Carnival&quot; (1946), Wilding was reunited with Neagle and Wilcox in &quot;The Courtneys of Curzon Street&quot; (1947), the biggest hit at the 1947 British box office and one of the most-seen British films of all time. Alexander Korda cast him opposite Paulette Goddard in &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (1947), another hit, but it failed to recoup its enormous cost. Wilding, Neagle and Wilcox reteamed for &quot;Spring in Park Lane&quot; (1948), another outstanding hit. It led to a sequel, &quot;Maytime in Mayfair&quot; (1949), which was also enormously popular.

Wilding was now one of the biggest stars in Britain—indeed he was voted as such by the readers of &quot;Kine Weekly&quot;. Director Alfred Hitchcock then cast him in two consecutive films that he produced through his own film production company Transatlantic Pictures (distributed through Warner Brothers Pictures). The first, &quot;Under Capricorn&quot; (released in 1949), in which he played opposite Ingrid Bergman and Joseph Cotten, was shot mostly in London but had final retakes and overdubs filmed in Hollywood. It was one of Hitchcock&#x27;s few flops. His second film for Hitchcock was the more popular &quot;Stage Fright&quot; (released in 1950), also filmed in London, with Marlene Dietrich and Jane Wyman. Thirteen years later, in 1963, Wilding starred in an Alfred Hitchcock Hour episode titled &quot;Last Seen Wearing Blue Jeans&quot;.

Wilcox used him in a film without Neagle, &quot;Into the Blue&quot; (1950) and the public response was considerably less enthusiastic than for the films they made together. He put Anouk Aimée under personal contract and announced plans to make a movie together but none resulted.

===Hollywood===
MGM made an offer for Wilding to appear opposite Greer Garson in &quot;The Law and the Lady&quot; (1951); the film was not a success. He returned to Britain for &quot;The Lady with a Lamp&quot; (1951), a biopic of Florence Nightingale with Neagle and Wilcox. It was popular in Britain, though less so than their earlier collaborations.

So too was &quot;Derby Day&quot; (1952), the last Neagle–Wilding collaboration. Wilcox tried Wilding with a new star, Margaret Lockwood, in &quot;Trent&#x27;s Last Case&quot; (1952), a minor hit. In 1952 British exhibitors voted him the fourth most popular star at the local box office.

In May 1952 Wilding signed a long-term contract with MGM. He turned down a role in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Latin Lovers&quot; and the studio put him under suspension.

In Hollywood, Wilding supported Joan Crawford in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Torch Song&quot; (1953). 20th Century Fox borrowed him to play a pharaoh in their big budget spectacular, &quot;The Egyptian&quot; (1954), which was a box office disappointment.

At MGM he was Prince Charming to Leslie Caron&#x27;s Cinderella in &quot;The Glass Slipper&quot; (1955), and Major John André in &quot;The Scarlet Coat&quot; (1956).

===Supporting actor===
Wilding journeyed with Taylor to Africa to appear in &quot;Zarak&quot; (1956) for Warwick Films, after which his marriage to Taylor ended. He began appearing regularly on U.S. television, including the title role in the 1957 episode &quot;The Trial of Colonel Blood&quot; of NBC&#x27;s anthology series &quot;The Joseph Cotten Show&quot;.

He had some roles in &quot;Danger Within&quot; (1959), a POW movie; &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot; (1960); &quot;The Naked Edge&quot; (1961); &quot;The Best of Enemies&quot; (1961); and &quot;A Girl Named Tamiko&quot; (1962).

===Final films===
His last roles included &quot;The Sweet Ride&quot; (1968) and &quot;Waterloo&quot; (1970).

His last appearance in a feature was in a cameo in &quot;Lady Caroline Lamb&quot; (1972), which co-starred his last wife, Margaret Leighton. His last role was in the TV movie &quot;&quot; (1973).

===Box-office ranking===
At the peak of his career, British exhibitors voted him among the most popular stars in the country:

* 1947—seventh most popular British star
* 1948—fifth most popular star
* 1949—second most popular star
* 1950—sixth most popular British star
* 1951—tenth most popular star
* 1952 fourth most popular British star
==Personal life==
Wilding was married four times: to Kay Young (married August 1937, separated December 1945, divorced December 1951); Elizabeth Taylor (married February 1952, separated July 1956, divorced January 1957); Susan Nell (married February 1958, divorced July 1962); and Margaret Leighton (married from July 1964 until her death in January 1976).

He and Taylor, who was 20 years his junior, had two sons, Michael Howard (born 6 January 1953) and Christopher Edward (born 27 February 1955). In 1957 he had a short-lived romance with actress Marie McDonald, who was nicknamed The Body.

In the 1960s he was forced to cut back on his film appearances because of illness related to his lifelong epilepsy.

==Death==
Wilding died on 8 July 1979 in Chichester, West Sussex, as a result of head injuries from a fall down a flight of stairs during an epileptic seizure. His body was cremated and the ashes were scattered.

<doc id="502294" wikidata="Q216298" url="?curid=502294" title="Nicky Hilton">
<text>Nicholai Olivia &quot;Nicky&quot; Rothschild ( Hilton; born October 5, 1983) is an American socialite, fashion designer and model. She is a member of the Hilton family by birth, and a member of the Rothschild family through her marriage to James Rothschild, a grandson of Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild, in 2015. She is the younger sister of Paris Hilton.

== Early life ==
Hilton was born on October 5, 1983 in New York City and was raised in Los Angeles to Richard Hilton and Kathy Hilton (née Avanzino). Hilton was named for her granduncle, Conrad &quot;Nicky&quot; Hilton Jr. Her siblings are Paris Hilton (born 1981), Barron Hilton II (born 1989) and Conrad Hughes Hilton (born 1994).

Hilton was raised Catholic. She has Norwegian, German, Italian, English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. Hilton graduated from Convent of the Sacred Heart, an all-girls Catholic school on the Upper East Side, in 2001. She took courses at Fashion Institute of Technology and Parsons The New School for Design but does not have a degree.

== Career ==

=== Fashion design ===
In 2004, Hilton launched her own clothing line. She also designed a line of handbags for Japanese company Samantha Thavasa. In 2007, she started her second line, Nicholai, at a higher price point. Nicholai held its fashion show for the spring/summer 2008 season on September 9, 2007, in New York City during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. In 2014, Hilton launched a 10-piece collection with eLuxe.

In 2010, Hilton launched a line of jewelry. The pieces are fashion jewelry and in an Art Deco style, averaging around $200 per piece. In 2015, she launched a capsule collection of handbags as part of a collaboration with Linea Pelle. Hilton said she was approached by Linea Pelle &quot;to make a capsule collection and I really wanted to have it be classic. As in I didn&#x27;t want to make these super trendy bags that would be out of style next season.&quot;

In August 2017, Hilton announced her collaboration with Tolani for a Mommy and Me capsule collection. The collection launched in stores in spring 2018. In 2019 Hilton launched a second collection with Tolani inspired by her travels. In February 2019, Hilton announced her first footwear collection in partnership with French Sole. The line, known as Nicky Hilton x French Sole, officially launched in September 2019.

In October 2024, she partnered with Australian designer Rebecca Vallance on a fashion collection called &quot;The Nicky Hilton for Rebecca Vallance Holiday Collection.” This unveiling was launched alongside her 41st birthday celebration.

=== Modeling ===
In 2005, Hilton was the face of Australian underwear line Antz Pantz alongside Kimberly Stewart. Stewart remains contracted, but Hilton has been replaced by Australian model Megan Maitland. Around this time, Hilton modeled for the cover of &quot;Lucire&quot; for its New Zealand and Romanian editions.

=== Other ventures ===

In 2006, Hilton entered a partnership to open two Nicky O Hotels, the first in Miami and the second in Chicago. That same year, she sued her partner in Federal Court in Los Angeles for damages and to seek an injunction against his use of the name. On February 12, 2007, Hilton was sued for breach of contract by her partners.

In 2014, she published her first book, &quot;365 Style&quot;, published by Harlequin, a subsidiary of HarperCollins.

In 2015, Hilton collaborated with Smashbox, the cosmetic brand owned by Estée Lauder Companies, to create a cosmetic line consisting of three limited-edition cat-inspired makeup kits.

== Personal life ==
At 2:30 a.m. on August 15, 2004, Hilton married childhood friend and businessman Todd Meister at the Vegas Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. The marriage was annulled less than three months later, with Hilton and Meister explaining they traveled apart often and had married &quot;on a whim&quot;.

In 2011, Hilton began dating financier James Rothschild (born 1985), a member of the Rothschild family and only son of Amschel Rothschild. On August 12, 2014, Hilton became engaged to Rothschild. They were married on July 10, 2015, in London, England. They have three children.

<doc id="502296" wikidata="Q6806018" url="?curid=502296" title="Medial magma">
<text>In abstract algebra, a medial magma or medial groupoid is a magma or groupoid (that is, a set with a binary operation) that satisfies the identity
or more simply,
for all , , and , using the convention that juxtaposition denotes the same operation but has higher precedence. This identity has been variously called &quot;medial&quot;, &quot;abelian&quot;, &quot;alternation&quot;, &quot;transposition&quot;, &quot;interchange&quot;, &quot;bi-commutative&quot;, &quot;bisymmetric&quot;, &quot;surcommutative&quot;, &quot;entropic&quot;, etc.

Any commutative semigroup is a medial magma, and a medial magma has an identity element if and only if it is a commutative monoid. The &quot;only if&quot; direction is the Eckmann–Hilton argument. Another class of semigroups forming medial magmas are normal bands. Medial magmas need not be associative: for any nontrivial abelian group with operation and integers , the new binary operation defined by yields a medial magma that in general is neither associative nor commutative.

Using the categorical definition of product, for a magma , one may define the Cartesian square magma  with the operation
The binary operation of , considered as a mapping from to , maps to , to , and to .
Hence, a magma  is medial if and only if its binary operation is a magma homomorphism from  to . This can easily be expressed in terms of a commutative diagram, and thus leads to the notion of a medial magma object in a category with a Cartesian product. (See the discussion in auto magma object.)

If and are endomorphisms of a medial magma, then the mapping defined by pointwise multiplication 
is itself an endomorphism. It follows that the set of all endomorphisms of a medial magma is itself a medial magma.

== Bruck–Murdoch–Toyoda theorem ==
The Bruck–Murdoch–Toyoda theorem provides the following characterization of medial quasigroups. Given an abelian group and two commuting automorphisms and of , define an operation on by
where some fixed element of . It is not hard to prove that forms a medial quasigroup under this operation. The Bruck–Murdoch-Toyoda theorem states that every medial quasigroup is of this form, i.e. is isomorphic to a quasigroup defined from an abelian group in this way. In particular, every medial quasigroup is isotopic to an abelian group.

The result was obtained independently in 1941 by Murdoch and Toyoda. It was then rediscovered by Bruck in 1944.

== Generalizations ==
The term &quot;medial&quot; or (more commonly) &quot;entropic&quot; is also used for a generalization to multiple operations. An algebraic structure is an entropic algebra if every two operations satisfy a generalization of the medial identity. Let and be operations of arity and , respectively. Then and are required to satisfy
: formula_1

== Nonassociative examples ==
A particularly natural example of a nonassociative medial magma is given by collinear points on elliptic curves. The operation for points on the curve, corresponding to drawing a line between x and y and defining as the third intersection point of the line with the elliptic curve, is a (commutative) medial magma which is isotopic to the operation of elliptic curve addition. 

Unlike elliptic curve addition, is independent of the choice of a neutral element on the curve, and further satisfies the identities . This property is commonly used in purely geometric proofs that elliptic curve addition is associative.

<doc id="502303" wikidata="Q378429" url="?curid=502303" title="Me and Bobby McGee">
<text>&quot;Me and Bobby McGee&quot; is a song written by American singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson and originally performed by Roger Miller. Fred Foster shares the writing credit, as Kristofferson wrote the song based on a suggestion from Foster. A posthumously released version by Janis Joplin topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1971, making the song the second posthumously released No. 1 single in U.S. chart history after &quot;(Sittin&#x27; On) The Dock of the Bay&quot; by Otis Redding. Gordon Lightfoot had previously released a version that reached number 1 on the Canadian country charts in 1970. Jerry Lee Lewis released a version that was number 1 on the country charts in December 1971/January 1972 as the &quot;B&quot; side of &quot;Would You Take Another Chance on Me&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Joplin&#x27;s version as the No. 11 song for 1971.

In 2002, the 1971 version of the song by Janis Joplin on Columbia Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==History==
The suggestion for the title was a cordial challenge from producer and Monument Records founder Fred Foster to Kris Kristofferson. The titular character was named for a studio secretary, Barbara &quot;Bobbie&quot; McKee, but Kristofferson had misheard her surname. He explained that he was trying to convey the despair of the last scene of Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La Strada&quot; in which a broken, war-torn, inebriated man (played by Anthony Quinn) stares up from the beach at the night&#x27;s stars, and breaks down sobbing.

==Narrative==
The song is the story of two drifters, the narrator and Bobby McGee. The pair hitch a ride from a truck driver and sing as they drive through the American South before making their way westward. They visit California and then part ways somewhere near Salinas, with the song&#x27;s narrator expressing sadness afterwards. 

Due to the singer&#x27;s name never being mentioned and the name &quot;Bobby&quot; being gender-neutral (especially in the US), the song has been recorded by both male and female singers as a heterosexual love song with only minor differences in the lyrical content.

==Recordings and notable performances==
Roger Miller was the first artist to record the song (in May 1969), and it appeared at No. 12 on the U.S. country chart in 1969. Kenny Rogers and the First Edition recorded the song in May/June 1969, and released it on their album &quot;Ruby, Don&#x27;t Take Your Love To Town&quot; in 1969. On the Canadian charts, Gordon Lightfoot&#x27;s version (recorded in November 1969) hit No. 13 on the pop music chart and No. 1 on the country music chart in 1970. The song was included on the 1970 Statler Brothers&#x27; album &quot;Bed of Rose&#x27;s&quot;, but was not released as a single.

Kristofferson recorded his own version of the song on his debut album &quot;Kristofferson&quot; in 1970. Later that year, his version of the song appeared in Monte Hellman&#x27;s psychedelic road movie &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot;. Kristofferson also appears briefly singing the song in the 1971 Dennis Hopper film &quot;The Last Movie&quot;.

Janis Joplin recorded the song for inclusion on her &quot;Pearl&quot; album only a few days before her death in October 1970. Singer Bob Neuwirth taught it to her while Kristofferson was in Peru filming &quot;The Last Movie&quot; with Dennis Hopper. Kristofferson did not know she had recorded the song until after her death. The first time he heard her recording of it was the day after she died. &quot;Record World&quot; called it a &quot;perfect matching of performer and material.&quot; Joplin&#x27;s version topped the charts to become her only number one single; her version was later ranked No. 148 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2004 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

Pink performed a cover of the song on January 30, 2025 at Kia Forum in Inglewood, California for FireAid to help with relief efforts for the January 2025 Southern California wildfires.

The Grateful Dead included this song in may of their live performances, with Bob Weir on the vocals.

<text>Havre Boucher is a community in Antigonish County, Nova Scotia, Canada.

==Description==
The village takes its name from &quot;Havre Boucher&quot;, a natural harbour that opens onto St. George&#x27;s Bay to the north. The community has expanded from its original setting on the west side of the harbour to now encompass the communities of Auld&#x27;s Cove, Cape Jack, East Havre Boucher, West Havre Boucher, Frankville and Linwood.

Havre Boucher is largely rural and dependent upon the fishing industry, and as a service centre for the surrounding area.

Formerly an incorporated village, offering its residents political control through an elected governing body known as a &quot;village commission&quot; which operated under the auspices of the Nova Scotia Municipal Services Act, its status was dissolved in 2018.

==History==
Construction of the Canso Causeway, which opened in 1955, saw the Canadian National Railway mainline from Truro-Sydney being diverted from Linwood to an alignment north through Havre Boucher and Cape Jack, following the Strait of Canso to the causeway. Prior to that time, the railway ran from Linwood to Mulgrave where a ferry service operated to Point Tupper. Havre Boucher saw the construction of a large railway yard, which remains in operation today by the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Havre Boucher had a population of 281 living in 128 of its 137 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 309. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="502309" wikidata="Q5353983" url="?curid=502309" title="Elders Limited">
<text>Elders Limited, formerly known as Elder, Stirling &amp; Co., Elder Smith and Co. and Elder Smith &amp; Co. Ltd, is an Australian agribusiness that provides agricultural goods and services to primary producers in Australia.

==History==

===Early history (1839–1939)===
With the fledgling colony of South Australia only three years old, Alexander Lang Elder arrived in Port Misery (now Port Adelaide) in January 1839 aboard the family-owned schooner &quot;Minerva&quot; as the only cabin passenger, under Captain David Reid. He went there to set up business and explore opportunities for his family&#x27;s Scottish-based merchant and shipping business. Alexander&#x27;s brothers, William, George, and Thomas joined Alexander. Out of the four of them, only Thomas stayed in Australia. Thomas moved to Adelaide in 1854 and worked with George for a year.

After George left, Thomas formed Elder, Stirling &amp; Co with Edward Stirling, Robert Barr Smith, and John Taylor. On Stirling and Taylor&#x27;s retirement in 1863, Barr Smith and Thomas Elder formed Elder Smith and Co.

In 1888, Elder Smith and Co. was amalgamated with its subsidiary Elder&#x27;s Wool &amp; Produce Co. Ltd, and Peter Waite became the chairman of directors of the new company, which was called Elder Smith &amp; Co. Ltd. Elders profits more than doubled from 1918 to 1928, with Peter Waite as chairman until his death in 1922, followed by Tom Elder Barr Smith, son of Robert.

In 1929 Walter Bagot, of Woods, Bagot, Jory &amp; Laybourne Smith designed the Elders Currie Street.

===World War II and after (1939–1962)===
The Elders centenary in 1939 coincided with the start of World War II when the highly competitive wool-selling business was put into government control. As the war continued, the wool auction system remained closed and the British government acquired the total Australian wool clip. In 1941, the British government paid Elders the equivalent of $3 billion today, and nearly $4 billion the following year. The return to the open auction system in 1946 saw the start of a dramatic five-year run for wool. National wool revenues increased by 29% and 64% respectively in the first two full years of peace.

In the early 1950s, Norman Giles moved from the Elders WA branch of the company to the Adelaide branch, and two years later became managing director. In 1962 Giles announced the merger of Elder Smith and Goldsbrough Mort with its new corporate headquarters located in Adelaide. In 1970, Giles expanded Elders into Gove Alumina and Robe River mining ventures and launched Elders Finance and Investment Co. Sir Norman Giles retired in 1975 after 54 years with Elders.

===Structural changes and expansion beyond agriculture (1970–2009)===
In 1976 Elders acquired Pitt Son &amp; Badgery Ltd, a Sydney based former subsidiary of the Scottish-Marra group. In 1982 Elders merged with jam maker Henry Jones IXL to become Elders IXL. The following year, Elders launched a successful takeover bid for Carlton &amp; United Breweries, which it renamed to Elders Brewing Group. In 1989, due to an economic downturn, Elders sold Henry Jones IXL to J.M. Smucker Company, was renamed Elders Pastoral, and became a division of its subsidiary Foster&#x27;s. In 1993, after being renamed Elders Limited, Elders was floated from Foster&#x27;s, after which it acquired the Australian Agricultural Company. Two years later, Futuris Corporation, a major shareholder in Elders, became the new owner of Elders Limited.

In 1997, Elders launched Australian Wool Handlers as a joint venture, a wool handling and dumping company that quickly became responsible for more than 60% of the national clip. In 1999 Elders Finance was sold to New Zealand-based company Hanover Finance after Elders had sold this business to NZ based investors who took on $20 million of liabilities. In 2009, Futuris Corporation changed its name to Elders Limited, and changed from its conglomerate holding company structure to a single integrated company with an owner-operated focus around its principal business Elders.

In 2013 Elders returned to a pure play agribusiness by selling and divesting the last portions of its Forestry and Automotive divisions.

===Return to pure play agribusiness (2013–present)===
In May 2014, Mark Allison was appointed CEO.

Central to Allison&#x27;s restructure of Elders was an Eight Point Plan, which outlined an aspirational target of returning Elders to sustainable earnings growth by FY17.

In 2016, Elders acquired 20% of Elders Insurance from QBE and 30% of StockCo.

In 2017, Elders divested its live export division, North Australian Cattle Company (NACC) and Indonesian Feedlot and Abattoir, re-allocating capital to a number of new acquisitions including horticultural inputs and services provider Ace Ohlsson and Kerr &amp; Co Livestock. 2017 also saw Elders complete the buyback of preferential hybrid shares.

In December 2017 Elders paid its first dividend to shareholders in nine years and achieved a market capitalization of $850 million, referred to as &quot;one of the biggest turnarounds in Australia’s corporate history&quot;.

In May 2018, Elders acquired Titan Ag, a manufacturer and supplier of agricultural chemicals. Elders began its acquisition of direct competitor Australian Independent Rural Retailers (AIRR) in July 2019 after making a $187 million offer.

In November 2024, Elders announced it would acquire Delta Agribusiness for $475 million.

== Main operations ==

=== Rural products ===
Elders is a significant supplier of farm inputs to primary producers in Australia. Products include seeds, fertilizer, agricultural chemicals, animal health products and general rural merchandise. The company also supplies professional and technical services to the rural sector via a network of agronomists.

=== Agency services ===
Elders provides services to assist primary producers with the sale of wool, grain and livestock. The company&#x27;s network of livestock agents and employees operates across Australia, with operations including livestock auctions (both physical and online), and direct sales to feedlots and livestock exporters.

Elders has historically been one of Australia&#x27;s largest agents for the sale of greasy wool. The company also operates a brokering service for woolgrowers and a grain marketing business.

=== Real estate services ===
Elders provides real estate services from around 24,981 branches across Australia. Rural agency services are primarily involved in the marketing and sale of farms, stations and lifestyle estates. Residential real estate services, including agency and property management, operate in major population centres and regional areas through a network of company-owned and franchised offices. Elders is also involved in mortgage and water broking.

=== Financial services ===
Elders offers a range of banking and insurance services from branches across Australia.

=== Feed and processing services===
Elders operates the Killara feedlot located south of Tamworth in New South Wales. The company also imports, processes and distributes premium Australian meat in China.

=== Australian Independent Rural Retailers (AIRR) ===
In July 2019, Elders announced the acquisition of Australian Independent Rural Retailers, an unlisted public company, for $187 million. AIRR was established in 2006 as an independent buying and marketing group for rural merchandise and pet and produce stores. The business has around 240 independent member stores plus 100 Tuckers Pet &amp; Produce stores across Australia. The acquisition was finalised on 13 November 2019.

=== Thomas Elder Markets ===
Thomas Elder Markets (TEM) was established in July 2020 to provide objective and independent analysis on agricultural commodity markets. This unit was set up with leading Australian commodity analysts Andrew Whitelaw and Matt Dalgleish, formerly of Mecardo. The TEM analysis business is one of the first of its kind to have an independence charter to ensure the independence of any work produced

The Thomas Elder Markets website has produced 492 articles between August 2020 and July 2021 which are freely accessible to agricultural stakeholders, these include 205 grain and oilseed, 53 fibre, 190 livestock and 44 other.

== Social responsibility ==
In 2016 Elders partnered with the North Queensland Cowboys National Rugby League team, producing a series of television advertisements and community initiatives to raise awareness and break the stigma of mental health. This program ended in 2018.

Following the Sir Ivan bushfire in June 2017, many Elders teams gave up time to contribute to a fencing day restoring damaged property. Elders also raised funds for the NSW Farmers Merriwa Sir Ivan Bushfire Appeal.

Elders Give It is a community giving program raising funds for not-for-profit organisations that support rural communities. Partners of Elders Give It include the Royal Flying Doctor Service, Landcare Australia and Beyond Blue.

In April 2017 Elders on South Australia&#x27;s Eyre Peninsula raised $25,000 for the Royal Flying Doctor Service and in November of the same year became a major sponsor of the Flying Doctor unveiling a new aircraft bearing the Elders logo, part of a three-year $300,000 sponsorship.

In FY2019, Elders made donations, support and contributions valued at $1.3 million to community projects including sporting teams, schools and rural charities.

<doc id="502314" wikidata="Q7828544" url="?curid=502314" title="Toucan Sam">
<text>Toucan Sam is the cartoon toucan mascot for Froot Loops breakfast cereal. The character has been featured in advertising since 1963. He exhibits the ability to smell Froot Loops from great distances and invariably locates a concealed bowl of the cereal while intoning, &quot;Follow your nose! It always knows!&quot;, sometimes followed by &quot;The flavour of fruit! Wherever it grows!&quot; Another version of this phrase in a string of commercials in the late 2000s presents the character at the end of the commercials saying &quot;Just follow your nose!&quot;, followed by his nephews retorting, &quot;For the fruity taste that shows!&quot;

==History==
Toucan Sam became the mascot for Froot Loops cereal in 1963. Manuel R. Vega created the cartoon character and originally voiced by Mel Blanc, using an ordinary American accent. Blanc&#x27;s original commercials were noted for their use of Pig Latin (referring to the cereal as OOT-fray OOPS-lay). The ad agency later decided to switch to the British accent more commonly associated with the character. They then employed Paul Frees to do what is, in effect, an imitation of Ronald Colman. After the death of Paul Frees, Toucan Sam&#x27;s voice was performed by Maurice LaMarche (1986–2021), then Matthew Curtis for a single spot in 2020. In July 2021, Toucan Sam was re-designed and re-cast as a friendly and wise British accented voice - a role filled by voice actor Colin Cassidy.

Toucan Sam had a cousin named Arty Artin featured in a few commercials.

Animation of the commercials was created by several animation companies including Thumbnail Spots; this impacted the character growth over the years.

Although his nose originally had two pink stripes, during the 1970s it became a tradition that each stripe on his nose represented one of the colours of the pieces in the cereal. The additions of new colours have made this colour scheme no longer accurate. There are now six colours of this cereal. The first new colour was green, which was introduced in 1991, then purple in 1994, and blue in 1996.

The colours, perhaps, represent different flavours present in the cereal, but each colour has the same flavour.

==Maya Archaeology Initiative==
The Maya Archaeology Initiative (MAI) is a project of the World Free Press Institute (WFPI). In June 2010, WFPI submitted a trademark application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the MAI logo, a profile of a toucan with a Mayan temple in the background, both encircled by yellow/green light. It was published on 15 March 2011.

Kellogg&#x27;s (owner of the Toucan Sam logo) objected because the two logos are too similar. That caused a long argument, which ended on 15 November 2011 with an announcement that Kellogg&#x27;s and the MAI were forming a charitable partnership.

==Recent commercials==

Since 1994, Toucan Sam has been joined onscreen by his nephews Puey, Susey, and Louis, though they are never actually referred to by name. The nephews are voiced by two notable voiceover artists: Frank Welker and Jim Cummings. In recent commercials, Toucan Sam&#x27;s three nephews have joined him in opposition to many practical Froot Loop-loving enemies through a series of integrated commercials (each of them as well as appropriately advertise the cereal itself).

The Toucan Sam campaign was produced by Pepper Films, Inc. until 2013 when Kellogg&#x27;s transitioned the Froot Loops brand to CGI with animation company Nathan Love. Toucan Sam is currently voiced by Colin Cassidy.

In 2020, Toucan Sam was redesigned to a more simplistic and contemporary design. The design received negative reactions, with many detractors noting that actual toucans don&#x27;t have human-like mouths in real life. He was redesigned again in 2021, retaining his original look in a brighter blue with red, orange, green, and purple stripes on his nose, while having a more solid appearance instead of a feathery texture. This was done due to the overwhelming negative reaction the previous redesign received. During this redesign, a Froot Loops YouTube channel was created.

==Health concerns and legal status across countries==
Toucan Sam, as well as other mascots featured in products targeted to children (such as Chester Cheetah and fellow Kellogg’s mascot, Tony the Tiger), has been the subject of controversy in several countries. A study published in the journal &quot;Obesity Reviews&quot;, suggested familiar media character branding appeared to be &quot;a powerful influence on children&#x27;s preferences, choices and intake of less healthy foods.&quot; Sam and similar mascots, have been banned from being featured in packaging and advertising in countries like Chile, Peru, Argentina and Mexico. A study by a coalition that included Action on Sugar and Children&#x27;s Food Campaign in the UK, found that 51% of 526 assessed &quot;child-friendly&quot; food and drink products with popular cartoon characters on their packaging were high in sugar, saturated fat, salt and fat, with only 18 healthy products such as fruit, vegetables and water were found to use child-friendly cartoons. Tom Watson of the Labour Party said using playful characters to appeal to children is “grossly irresponsible”, and the Health and Social Care Select Committee issued calls for a blanket ban on ‘brand-generated characters or licensed TV and film characters which are used to promote foods high in fat, sugar or salt.&quot; Consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks dropped 25 percent in the 18 months after Chile adopted these regulations, which also included octagon front-of-package warning labels and a ban on junk food in schools.

<doc id="502316" wikidata="Q718499" url="?curid=502316" title="Jon McBride">
<text>Jon Andrew McBride (August 14, 1943 – August 7, 2024) was an American naval officer, test pilot, astronaut and administrator for NASA.

Throughout his career with the United States Navy, McBride served as an aviator, a fighter pilot, a test pilot, and an aeronautical engineer. He had achieved the rank of captain when he retired in 1989.

McBride was an astronaut with NASA, a role in which he piloted STS-41-G, and would have been commander of STS-61-E had the mission not been canceled as the next scheduled launch in the wake of the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster.

==Early life, education and personal life==
Jon McBride was born on August 14, 1943, in Charleston, West Virginia. When he was still a young child, his family moved to Beckley, West Virginia, which he considered to be his hometown. In 1960, he graduated from Beckley&#x27;s Woodrow Wilson High School, then attended West Virginia University from 1960–1964 and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1971. He did graduate work in Human Resource Management at Pepperdine University. At West Virginia University, McBride became a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.

McBride was married to the former Brenda Lou Stewart in 1966. They had three children, Richard M. (1962–1992), Melissa L. (1966), and Jon A. (1970). After their divorce in 1986, he married the former Sharon Lynn White in 1988, which also ended in divorce in 2019.

==Military career==
McBride&#x27;s naval service began in 1965 with flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida. After being designated a naval aviator and receiving his wings in August 1966, he was assigned to Fighter Squadron 101 (VF-101) based at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia for training on the F-4 Phantom II aircraft. He was subsequently assigned to Fighter Squadron 41 (VF-41) where he served three years as a fighter pilot and division officer. He also served tours with VF-11 and VF-103. While deployed in Southeast Asia, McBride flew 64 combat missions during the Vietnam War.

He attended the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (Class 75A) at Edwards Air Force Base in California before reporting to Air Test and Development Squadron Four (VX-4) at Naval Air Station Point Mugu in California, where he served as a maintenance officer and Sidewinder project officer. He flew over 40 different types of military and civilian aircraft and piloted the Navy &quot;Spirit of &#x27;76&quot; bicentennial-painted F-4J Phantom in various air shows during 1976, 1977, and 1978. He held Federal Aviation Administration ratings which included civilian commercial pilot certificate (multi-engine), instrument, and glider, and he previously served as a certified flight instructor.

He logged over 8,800 hours of flying time—including 4,700 hours in jet aircraft and over 600 carrier landings.

==NASA career==

Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in January 1978, McBride became an astronaut in August 1979, the first astronaut from West Virginia. His NASA assignments included lead chase pilot for the maiden voyage of Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory, capsule communicator for STS-5, STS-6, and STS-7, flight data file manager, and orbital rendezvous procedures development.

McBride was the pilot of STS-41-G, which launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, on October 5, 1984, aboard the Orbiter &quot;Challenger&quot;. This was the first crew of seven, at the time the largest crew ever sent into space. During their eight-day mission, crew members deployed the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite, conducted scientific observations of the Earth with the OSTA-3 pallet and Large Format Camera, and demonstrated potential satellite refueling with an EVA and associated hydrazine transfer. The mission duration was 197 hours and concluded with a landing at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, on October 13, 1984.

McBride was scheduled to fly again in March 1986 as the commander of STS-61-E. This flight was one of several deferred by NASA in the wake of the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident in January 1986.

On July 30, 1987, McBride was assigned to NASA Headquarters to serve as assistant administrator for Congressional Relations, with responsibility for NASA&#x27;s relationship with the United States Congress, and for providing coordination and direction to all headquarters and field center communications with congressional support organizations. He held this post from September 1987 through March 1989. In 1988, McBride was named to command the crew of the STS-35 (ASTRO-1) mission, scheduled for launch in March 1990, but chose to retire from NASA instead.

==Post-NASA career==

===Business career===
In May 1989, McBride retired from NASA and the U.S. Navy to pursue a business career. He moved to Lewisburg, West Virginia, where he became president and chief executive officer of the Flying Eagle Corporation, a venture capital firm, and president of the Constructors&#x27; Labor Council of West Virginia, a group representing heavy and highway construction contractors.

===Political career===
In 1996, he unsuccessfully vied for the Republican nomination for Governor of West Virginia, losing to Cecil H. Underwood.
===Kennedy Space Center and retirement===
By 2008, McBride was retired and living near Cocoa, Florida. According to a short interview on September 20, 2017, during a &quot;Meet an Astronaut&quot; event, he was also actively working on improving the Space Shuttle Experience ride. He had proposed to assist in the development of a landing sequence for the ride. McBride remained active supporting the &quot;Lunch with an Astronaut&quot; program at Kennedy Space Center until 2020 when he announced his retirement from duty at the visitors complex.

On September 23, 2011, the NASA Independent Verification and Validation Facility (IV&amp;V) in Fairmont, West Virginia, dedicated a NASA software laboratory to McBride, a West Virginia native. The laboratory&#x27;s official name is the Jon McBride Software Testing and Research Laboratory, or JSTAR. JSTAR is NASA IV&amp;V&#x27;s environment for adaptable testing and simulation, designed to enhance tools and methods used to critically assess mission and safety critical software across NASA&#x27;s missions. The lab supports end-to-end testing on mission flight software through the application of analytical rigor to reduce the threat of software-related mission failure.

==Death==
Jon McBride died on August 7, 2024, at the age of 80, just a week before his 81st birthday.

<doc id="502317" wikidata="Q2920489" url="?curid=502317" title="Space Coast">
<text>The Space Coast is a region in the U.S. state of Florida around the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. It is one of several &quot;themed&quot; coasts around Florida. All orbital launches from American soil carrying NASA astronauts (running from Project Mercury in 2022 to the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, and since 1994 using the SpaceX Dragon 2) have departed from either KSC or Cape Canaveral. The Space Force Station has also launched unmanned military and civilian rockets. Cities in the area include Port St. John, Titusville, Cocoa, Rockledge, Cape Canaveral, Merritt Island (unincorporated), Cocoa Beach, Melbourne, Satellite Beach, Indian Harbour Beach, Indialantic, Melbourne Beach, Palm Bay, and Viera (unincorporated). Much of the area lies within Brevard County. It is bounded on the south by the Treasure Coast, on the west by Central Florida including Orlando (and is economically tied to that region), on the north by Volusia County, and on the east by the Atlantic Ocean.

One reason rockets are launched from the Space Coast has to do with the Earth&#x27;s rotation. The Earth rotates from west to east, most quickly at the equator, and to take advantage of this, adding the speed of rotation to the orbital velocity of the rocket, it is most beneficial to launch eastward from a location near the equator. Launching from an uninhabited location on an easterly coast at low latitude, minimizing the danger posed by debris from a failed launch, is ideal both for the safety of the people on the ground and for fuel efficiency of the rocket. Given the high population densities in coastal Texas, South Florida, and Puerto Rico, the Space Coast is often considered the best location when all factors are taken into account.

== Space-named landmarks (outside KSC and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station) ==
Many places near the Cape are named for subjects relating to the US space program including vehicles, astronauts, and the spaceport itself.

== Telephone area code ==
When the region became too heavily populated to be served by only one area code, a local resident Robert Osband (aka Richard Cheshire) discovered that area code 321 was not assigned to any other territory (though it was being considered for the suburban Chicago area). If each number is pronounced individually—&quot;3, 2, 1&quot;—the pronunciation resembles the countdown before liftoff; thus, the resident petitioned for the code to be assigned to the Space Coast region. His efforts were popular among local residents and resulted in success; the new code officially became effective on November 1, 1999.

==Tourism==
Because it is home to Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station the local area is popular with visitors to watch rocket launches in person. Over 100,000 people are believed to have been present in February 2018 for the Falcon Heavy test flight. It is home to Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, US Space Walk of Fame, and the Air Force Space and Missile Museum. Nearly 1 million people were present to watch the last space shuttle launch in 2011. 150,000 people were present for the Crew Dragon Demo-2 launch. The area is also home to many space-themed businesses. 750,000 to 900,000 people gathered on the space coast to watch the Apollo 11 launch in 1969.

The area also sees Christmas tourism, as thousands of people attend the Surfing Santas festival in Cocoa Beach (by Cape Canaveral) over the holiday season. Cocoa Beach attracts all types of people looking for a vacation because of the beachy location. A weekend here may have people stopping by a surf museum or shopping at a tiki gallery.

== Media ==
&quot;Brevard Business News&quot; is a weekly newspaper in Melbourne, Florida, United States covering business news and trends for the Space Coast. Fred Krupski started Brevard Business News in 1981, and Adrienne B. Roth purchased it in 1986. Other media outlets serving the Brevard County community include the Florida Today, Space Coast Daily, Hometown News, Spectrum TV 13 and numerous radio stations. Several national TV network affiliates based in Orlando also cover Brevard County news.

==Locations==
TNO is headquartered in The Hague. Other locations include: Amsterdam, Delft, Rijswijk, Leiden, Groningen, Helmond, Petten, Soesterberg, Utrecht, Ypenburg, Zeist and Eindhoven. TNO also has international branch offices in Shin-Yokohama (Japan), Toronto (Canada), Brussels (Belgium), Doha (Qatar), Singapore and Aruba. The locations of Hoofddorp and Enschede were closed in 2014.

==Criticism==
During World War II, the organization controlled several large institutes under the occupation of the Nazis. The Director was . As rector of the University of Utrecht, he fired the Jewish professors Ornstein, Roos and Wolff and the Jewish student assistants Fisher, Katz, Pais and Van der Hoeven. He was a member of the board of the AKU, which was controlled by the Germans.

In 2006, TNO-ITSEF, a subsidiary organization of TNO, was criticized for resisting the publication of its test reports regarding widely used voting computers in the Netherlands. In the same year, a Swiss research group refuted a widely publicized TNO report claiming UMTS radiation is a health hazard. The organization also received criticism after the evacuation of 200 residents of an Amsterdam housing estate over fears of its structural integrity when the construction had been technically approved by TNO only five months earlier. TNO was also criticized for its 2006 handling of an investigation into the collapse of a balcony in Maastricht in 2003 that killed two people.

In 2018, TNO was accused of committing fraud to disguise the cause of the disaster for their report about the fireworks disaster in Enschede on 13 May 2000, according to an investigation by Paul van Buitenen.

He was awarded the Presidential Rank of Meritorious Executive Award in 1998 and again in 2004.

==Experience==
Leestma joined the U.S Naval Sea Cadet Corps in 8th grade. Leestma said that &quot;[Sea Cadets] was my first experience with the military service and it appealed to me... [Sea Cadets] was the beginning of this journey with the Navy that has been a lifetime experience.&quot; Leestma graduated first in his class from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1971. As a first lieutenant afloat, he was assigned to in Long Beach, California, before reporting in January 1972 to the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. He completed United States Naval Flight Officer training and received his NFO wings in October 1973. He was assigned to VF-124 in San Diego, California, for initial flight training in the F-14A Tomcat and then transferred to VF-32 in June 1974 and was stationed at Virginia Beach, Virginia. Leestma made three overseas deployments to the Mediterranean/North Atlantic areas while flying aboard the aircraft carrier . In 1977, he was reassigned to Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Four (VX-4) at Naval Air Station Point Mugu, California. As an operational test director with the F-14A, he conducted the first operational testing of new tactical software for the F-14 and completed the follow-on test and evaluation of new F-14A avionics, including the programmable signal processor. He also served as fleet model manager for the F-14A tactical manual.

He has logged over 3,500 hours of flight time, including nearly 1,500 hours in the F-14A. Leestma retired from the Navy as a captain.

===NASA experience===
He was selected by NASA to become an astronaut in 1980 and was the first member of NASA Astronaut Group 9 to go into space. Following his first flight, Leestma served as a capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for STS-51-C through STS-61-A. He was then assigned as the Chief, Mission Development Branch, responsible for assessing the operational integration requirements of payloads that will fly aboard the Space Shuttle. From February 1990 to September 1991, when he started training for his third space mission, Leestma served as deputy director of Flight Crew Operations. Following this flight, he served as Deputy Chief and Acting Chief of the Astronaut Office. Leestma was selected as the Director, Flight Crew Operations Directorate, in November 1992. As Director, FCOD, he had overall responsibility for the Astronaut Office and for Johnson Space Center (JSC) Aircraft Operations. During his tenure as Director, 41 Shuttle flights and 7 Mir missions were successfully flown. He was responsible for the selection of Astronaut Groups 15, 16 and 17. While director, he oversaw the requirements, development modifications of the T-38A transition to the T-38N avionics upgrades. In September 1998, Leestma was reassigned as the deputy director, Engineering, in charge of the management of Johnson Space Center Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) Projects. In August 2001 he was assigned as the JSC Project Manager for the Space Launch Initiative, responsible for all JSC work related to the development of the new launch system. Leestma is currently serving as the Assistant Program Manager for the Orbital Space Plane Program, responsible for the vehicle systems and operations of the new crewed vehicle that is to serve as the transfer vehicle for space flight crews to and from the International Space Station.

A veteran of three space flights, Leestma has logged a total of 532.7 hours in space. He was a mission specialist on STS-41-G (October 5–13, 1984), STS-28 (August 8–13, 1989), and STS-45 (March 24 to April 2, 1992).

===Space flight experience===
STS-41-G &quot;Challenger&quot;, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on October 5, 1984. It was the sixth flight of the orbiter &quot;Challenger&quot; and the thirteenth flight of the Space Shuttle system. The seven-person crew also included two payload specialists: one from Canada, and one Navy oceanographer. During the mission, the crew deployed the ERBS satellite using the Remote Manipulator System (RMS), operated the OSTA-3 payload (including the SIR-B radar, FILE, and MAPS experiments) and the Large Format Camera (LFC), conducted a satellite refueling demonstration using hydrazine fuel with the Orbital Refueling System (ORS), and conducted numerous in-cabin experiments as well as activating eight &quot;Getaway Special&quot; canisters. Dave Leestma and Kathryn Sullivan successfully conducted a 3½ hour extravehicular activity (EVA) to demonstrate the feasibility of actual satellite refueling.

STS-28 &quot;Columbia&quot;, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 8, 1989. The mission carried Department of Defense payloads and a number of secondary payloads. After 80 orbits of the Earth, this five-day mission concluded with a lakebed landing on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on August 13, 1989.

STS-45 &quot;Atlantis&quot;, launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida on March 24, 1992. During the nine-day mission, the crew operated the twelve experiments that constituted the ATLAS-1 (Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science) cargo. ATLAS-1 obtained a vast array of detailed measurements of atmospheric, chemical and physical properties, which will contribute significantly to improving our understanding of our climate and atmosphere. STS-45 landed on April 2, 1992, on Runway 33 at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, after completing 142 orbits of the Earth.

<doc id="502323" wikidata="Q1501872" url="?curid=502323" title="Inverse kinematics">
<text>In computer animation and robotics, inverse kinematics is the mathematical process of calculating the variable joint parameters needed to place the end of a kinematic chain, such as a robot manipulator or animation character&#x27;s skeleton, in a given position and orientation relative to the start of the chain. Given joint parameters, the position and orientation of the chain&#x27;s end, e.g. the hand of the character or robot, can typically be calculated directly using multiple applications of trigonometric formulas, a process known as forward kinematics. However, the reverse operation is, in general, much more challenging.

Inverse kinematics is also used to recover the movements of an object in the world from some other data, such as a film of those movements, or a film of the world as seen by a camera which is itself making those movements. This occurs, for example, where a human actor&#x27;s filmed movements are to be duplicated by an animated character.

==Robotics==
In robotics, inverse kinematics makes use of the kinematics equations to determine the joint parameters that provide a desired configuration (position and rotation) for each of the robot&#x27;s end-effectors. This is important because robot tasks are performed with the end effectors, while control effort applies to the joints. Determining the movement of a robot so that its end-effectors move from an initial configuration to a desired configuration is known as motion planning. Inverse kinematics transforms the motion plan into joint actuator trajectories for the robot. Similar formulas determine the positions of the skeleton of an animated character that is to move in a particular way in a film, or of a vehicle such as a car or boat containing the camera which is shooting a scene of a film. Once a vehicle&#x27;s motions are known, they can be used to determine the constantly-changing viewpoint for computer-generated imagery of objects in the landscape such as buildings, so that these objects change in perspective while themselves not appearing to move as the vehicle-borne camera goes past them.

The movement of a kinematic chain, whether it is a robot or an animated character, is modeled by the kinematics equations of the chain. These equations define the configuration of the chain in terms of its joint parameters. Forward kinematics uses the joint parameters to compute the configuration of the chain, and inverse kinematics reverses this calculation to determine the joint parameters that achieve a desired configuration.

==Kinematic analysis==

Kinematic analysis is one of the first steps in the design of most industrial robots. Kinematic analysis allows the designer to obtain information on the position of each component within the mechanical system. This information is necessary for subsequent dynamic analysis along with control paths.

Inverse kinematics is an example of the kinematic analysis of a constrained system of rigid bodies, or kinematic chain. The kinematic equations of a robot can be used to define the loop equations of a complex articulated system. These loop equations are non-linear constraints on the configuration parameters of the system. The independent parameters in these equations are known as the degrees of freedom of the system.

While analytical solutions to the inverse kinematics problem exist for a wide range of kinematic chains, computer modeling and animation tools often use Newton&#x27;s method to solve the non-linear kinematics equations. When trying to find an analytical solution it is often convenient to exploit the geometry of the system and decompose it using subproblems with known solutions.

Other applications of inverse kinematic algorithms include interactive manipulation, animation control and collision avoidance.

==Inverse kinematics and 3D animation==

Inverse kinematics is important to game programming and 3D animation, where it is used to connect game characters physically to the world, such as feet landing firmly on top of terrain (see for a comprehensive survey on Inverse Kinematics Techniques in Computer Graphics).

An animated figure is modeled with a skeleton of rigid segments connected with joints, called a kinematic chain. The kinematics equations of the figure define the relationship between the joint angles of the figure and its pose or configuration. The forward kinematic animation problem uses the kinematics equations to determine the pose given the joint angles. The &quot;inverse kinematics problem&quot; computes the joint angles for a desired pose of the figure.

It is often easier for computer-based designers, artists, and animators to define the spatial configuration of an assembly or figure by moving parts, or arms and legs, rather than directly manipulating joint angles. Therefore, inverse kinematics is used in computer-aided design systems to animate assemblies and by computer-based artists and animators to position figures and characters.

The assembly is modeled as rigid links connected by joints that are defined as mates, or geometric constraints. Movement of one element requires the computation of the joint angles for the other elements to maintain the joint constraints. For example, inverse kinematics allows an artist to move the hand of a 3D human model to a desired position and orientation and have an algorithm select the proper angles of the wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints. Successful implementation of computer animation usually also requires that the figure move within reasonable anthropomorphic limits.

A method of comparing both forward and inverse kinematics for the animation of a character can be defined by the advantages inherent to each. For instance, blocking animation where large motion arcs are used is often more advantageous in forward kinematics. However, more delicate animation and positioning of the target end-effector in relation to other models might be easier using inverted kinematics. Modern digital creation packages (DCC) offer methods to apply both forward and inverse kinematics to models.

== Analytical solutions to inverse kinematics ==

=== Generic solutions ===
In some, but not all cases, there exist analytical solutions to inverse kinematic problems. One such example is for a 6-Degrees of Freedom (DoF) robot (for example, 6 revolute joints) moving in 3D space (with 3 position degrees of freedom, and 3 rotational degrees of freedom). If the degrees of freedom of the robot exceeds the degrees of freedom of the end-effector, for example with a 7 DoF robot with 7 revolute joints, then there exist infinitely many solutions to the IK problem, and an analytical solution does not exist. Further extending this example, it is possible to fix one joint and analytically solve for the other joints, but perhaps a better solution is offered by numerical methods (next section), which can instead optimize a solution given additional preferences (costs in an optimization problem). 

An analytic solution to an inverse kinematics problem is a closed-form expression that takes the end-effector pose as input and gives joint positions as output, formula_1. Analytical inverse kinematics solvers can be significantly faster than numerical solvers and provide more than one solution, but only a finite number of solutions, for a given end-effector pose.

Many different programs (Such as FOSS programs IKFast and Inverse Kinematics Library) are able to solve these problems quickly and efficiently using different algorithms such as the . One issue with these solvers, is that they are known to not necessarily give locally smooth solutions between two adjacent configurations, which can cause instability if iterative solutions to inverse kinematics are required, such as if the IK is solved inside a high-rate control loop.

=== Ortho-parallel Basis and a Spherical Wrist ===

Many industrial 6DOF robots feature three rotational joints with intersecting axes (&quot;spherical wrist&quot;). These robots, known as robots with an &quot;Ortho-parallel Basis and a Spherical Wrist,&quot; can be defined by 7 kinematic parameters that are distances in their assumed standard geometry. These robots may have up to 8 independent solutions for any given position and rotation of the robot tool head. Open-source solutions for C++ and Rust exist. OPW has also been integrated into ROS framework. 

== Numerical solutions to IK problems ==

There are many methods of modelling and solving inverse kinematics problems. The most flexible of these methods typically rely on iterative optimization to seek out an approximate solution, due to the difficulty of inverting the forward kinematics equation and the possibility of an empty solution space. The core idea behind several of these methods is to model the forward kinematics equation using a Taylor series expansion, which can be simpler to invert and solve than the original system.

=== The Jacobian inverse technique ===

The Jacobian inverse technique is a simple yet effective way of implementing inverse kinematics. Let there be formula_2 variables that govern the forward-kinematics equation, i.e. the position function. These variables may be joint angles, lengths, or other arbitrary real values. If, for example, the IK system lives in a 3-dimensional space, the position function can be viewed as a mapping formula_3. Let formula_4 give the initial position of the system, and 

:formula_5

be the goal position of the system. The Jacobian inverse technique iteratively computes an estimate of formula_6 that minimizes the error given by
formula_7.

For small formula_6-vectors, the series expansion of the position function gives

:formula_9,

where formula_10 is the (3 × m) Jacobian matrix of the position function at formula_11.

The (i, k)-th entry of the Jacobian matrix can be approximated numerically

:formula_12,

where formula_13 gives the i-th component of the position function, formula_14 is simply formula_11 with a small delta added to its k-th component, and formula_16 is a reasonably small positive value.

Taking the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse of the Jacobian (computable using a singular value decomposition) and re-arranging terms results in

:formula_17,

where formula_18.

Applying the inverse Jacobian method once will result in a very rough estimate of the desired formula_6-vector. A line search should be used to scale this formula_6 to an acceptable value. The estimate for formula_6 can be improved via the following algorithm (known as the Newton–Raphson method):

:formula_22

Once some formula_6-vector has caused the error to drop close to zero, the algorithm should terminate. Existing methods based on the Hessian matrix of the system have been reported to converge to desired formula_6 values using fewer iterations, though, in some cases more computational resources.

=== Heuristic methods ===

The inverse kinematics problem can also be approximated using heuristic methods. These methods perform simple, iterative operations to gradually lead to an approximation of the solution. The heuristic algorithms have low computational cost (return the final pose very quickly), and usually support joint constraints. The most popular heuristic algorithms are cyclic coordinate descent (CCD) and forward and backward reaching inverse kinematics (FABRIK).

<doc id="502328" wikidata="Q493699" url="?curid=502328" title="Paul Scully-Power">
<text>Paul Desmond Scully-Power, AM GOSE FRAeS (born May 28, 1944) is an Australian-born American oceanographer, technology expert, business executive and astronaut. In 1984, while a civilian employee of the United States Naval Undersea Warfare Center, he flew aboard NASA Space Shuttle mission STS-41-G as a Payload Specialist. He was the first Australian-born person to journey into space, and the first astronaut with a beard.

During his time in space he was able to confirm the existence of spiral eddies, and observe them with the naked eye.

Scully-Power went on to work in private industry. He is considered a world expert in remote sensing: visible, infra-red, radar and acoustic and is considered a security, aviation and aerospace expert.

He was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the 2004 Australia Day Honours &quot;for service to science in the fields of oceanography and space remote sensing, and to the community through contributions to a range of government regulatory agencies and through raising public awareness of conservation issues.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Paul Scully-Power was born in Sydney, Australia. He attended schools in London, and Saint Ignatius&#x27; College, Riverview and St Pius X College, Chatswood, in Sydney. He studied applied mathematics at the University of Sydney, where he resided at St John&#x27;s College, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science with Honours in 1966 and a Diploma of Education in 1967.

==Career==
In January 1967, after graduating from the University of Sydney, Scully-Power was approached by the Royal Australian Navy to set up the first oceanographic group within the Navy.

From January 1967 to July 1972 he was a Scientific officer, and remained the first permanent head of the oceanographic group.

From July 1972 to March 1974 he was an Australian Navy Exchange Scientist, U.S. Navy. He also worked at the U.S. Naval Underwater Systems Center, New London, Connecticut, and at the Office of Naval Research, Washington, D.C. During this period, he was invited to assist the Earth Observations team on the Skylab Project and has worked in space oceanography for each crewed spacecraft mission since that time.

From March 1974 to March 1975 he returned to Australia, planned and executed the joint Australia, New Zealand, United States project ANZUS EDDY, which was the first combined oceanographic and acoustic measurement of an ocean eddy ever conducted.

In 1976, he was appointed a foreign principal investigator for the Heat Capacity Mapping Mission, which was one of a series of satellites launched by NASA to explore the usefulness of remote sensing measurements.

In October 1977, he emigrated to the United States and was offered a position at the Naval Underwater Systems Center. This position is that of a senior scientist and technical specialist on the staff of the Associate Technical Director for Research and Technology with the responsibility to insure the development of a comprehensive and balanced technology base within the Center. He became a U.S. citizen in 1982.

===NASA career===
In June 1984, Scully-Power was chosen by NASA to be a Payload Specialist (known among the crew affectionately as a blanket counter) on the 13th Shuttle mission, which would study Earth Sciences. His space flight STS-41-G &quot;Challenger&quot; (October 5–13, 1984) was launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. STS-41-G was the first mission with a 7-person crew, and the first to demonstrate American orbital fuel transfer. During the 8-day flight, the crew deployed the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite, conducted scientific observations of the earth with the OSTA-3 pallet and Large Format Camera, and demonstrated potential satellite refueling with an EVA and associated hydrazine transfer. At mission conclusion, Scully-Power had traveled over 3.4 million miles in 133 Earth orbits, and logged over 197 hours in space.

His role was to investigate spiral eddies, which at the time were thought to be rare. He was able to photograph them with an ordinary camera, and show that they were ubiquitous.

NASA initially expected him to shave his beard before spaceflight, but allowed it after he was able to demonstrate that it did not affect his helmet&#x27;s seal.

===Corporate career===
Scully-Power became the CTO of Tenix Group in 2004, and in 2007 was appointed chairman and CEO of SensorConnect Inc., a Silicon Valley high-tech company. He was formerly the CTO of the Tenix Group, Australia&#x27;s largest Defence &amp; Technology contractor.

<text>Trinity College is a private liberal arts college in Hartford, Connecticut, United States. Founded as Washington College in 1823, it is the second-oldest college in the state of Connecticut. Coeducational since 1969, the college enrolls 2,235 students. Trinity offers 41 majors and 28 interdisciplinary minors. The college is a member of the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC).

== History ==
===19th century===

Bishop Thomas Brownell opened Washington College in 1824 to nine male students and the vigorous protest of Yale alumni. A 14-acre site was chosen, at the time about a half-mile from the city of Hartford.

The college was renamed Trinity College in 1845; the original campus consisted of two Greek Revival buildings. One of the Greek Revival buildings housed a chapel, library, and lecture rooms. The other was a dormitory for the male students.

In 1872, Trinity College was persuaded by the state to move from its downtown &quot;College Hill&quot; location (now Capitol Hill, site of the state capitol building) to its current campus a mile southwest. Although the college sold its land overlooking the Park River and Bushnell Park in 1872, it did not complete its move to its Gallows Hill campus until 1878. The original plans for the Gallows Hill site were drawn by the noted Victorian architect William Burges but were too ambitious and too expensive to be fully realized. Only one section of the proposed campus plan, the Long Walk, was completed.

By 1889, the library contained 30,000 volumes, and the school graduated over 900 students. Enrollment reached 122 in 1892.

===20th century===
President Remsen Ogilby (1920–1943) enlarged the campus, and more than doubled the endowment. The faculty grew from 25 to 62, and the student body from 167 to 530 men. Under President Keith Funston (1943–1951), returning veterans expanded the enrollment to 900.

In 1962, Connecticut Public Television (CPTV) began its first broadcasts in the Trinity College Public Library, and later in Boardman Hall, a science building on campus.

In 1968, the trustees voted to withdraw from the Association of Episcopal Colleges. Also in 1968, the trustees of Trinity College voted to make a commitment to enroll more minority students, providing financial aid as needed. This decision was preceded by a siege of the administrative offices in the Downes and Williams Memorial buildings during which Trinity students would not allow the president or trustees to leave until they agreed to the resolution.

In 1969, Trinity College became coeducational and admitted its first female students, as transfers from Vassar College and Smith College.

== Academics ==

Trinity offers undergraduate degrees in 41 majors with options of 28 minors and a self-designed major, and Masters of Arts in a few subjects. Trinity is part of a small group of liberal arts schools that offer degrees in engineering. Trinity has a student-to-faculty ratio of 9:1. Its most popular undergraduate majors, by number out of 517 graduates in 2022, were:
*Political Science and Government (80)
*Economics (64)
*Psychology (41)
*Econometrics and Quantitative Economics (38)
*Engineering (28)
*Neuroscience (24)
*Biology/Biological Sciences (23)

=== Trinity College, Rome Campus ===
Trinity College, Rome Campus (TCRC), is a study abroad campus of Trinity College. It was established in 1970 and is in a residential area of Rome on the Aventine Hill close to the Basilica of Santa Sabina within the precincts of a convent run by an order of nuns.

=== Admissions ===

The 2020 annual ranking by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; categorizes Trinity as &quot;more selective&quot;.

For the Class of 2022 (enrolling fall 2018), Trinity received 6,096 applications, accepted 2,045 (33.5%) and enrolled 579.

As of fall 2015, Trinity College does not require the SAT or ACT for students applying for admission. Of the 31% of enrolled freshmen submitting SAT scores, the middle 50% range was 630–710 for evidence-based reading and writing, and 670–750 for math, while of the 23% of enrolled freshmen submitting ACT results, the middle 50% range for the composite score was 29–32.

=== Rankings and reputation ===
&quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked Trinity College 17th amongst all liberal arts universities and 71st amongst all colleges and universities on its 2024-25 list. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Trinity tied for 36th in its 2025 ranking of best national liberal arts colleges in the United States. It was also ranked 27th for best value school. However, these US News rankings likely reflect that Trinity joined the &quot;Annapolis Group&quot; in August 2007, an organization of more than 100 of the nation&#x27;s liberal arts schools, in refusing to participate in the magazine&#x27;s rankings. Trinity College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

In 2016, authors Howard and Matthew Greene continued to include Trinity in the third edition of &quot;Hidden Ivies: 63 Top Colleges that Rival the Ivy League&quot;. The Princeton Review has given Trinity a 93 (out of 99) for selectivity and in 2017 named Trinity as a best value college. &quot;Money.com&quot; magazine ranked Trinity College 55th among all colleges and universities in the nation.

== Student life ==
===Mascot===

Trinity&#x27;s mascot, the bantam, was conceived by Joseph Buffington, class of 1875, who was a federal judge and trustee of the college.

===Student publication===

&quot;The Trinity Tripod&quot;, founded in 1904, is Trinity College&#x27;s student newspaper.

=== Fraternities and sororities ===

According to the college, 18% of the student body are affiliated with a Greek organization. 

In 2012, then-president James F. Jones proposed a social policy for Trinity College which made a commitment, among other things, to require all sororities and fraternities to achieve gender parity within two years or face closure. Trinity College&#x27;s co-ed mandate for fraternities and sororities was withdrawn in September 2015 and replaced with the &quot;Campaign for Community&quot; effort to establish more inclusive social traditions on campus.

Trinity currently has several sororities and fraternities:

==Hartford campus ==

=== Long Walk buildings ===
The first buildings completed on the current campus were Seabury and Jarvis halls in 1878. Together with Northam Towers, these make up what is known as the &quot;Long Walk&quot;. These buildings are an early example of Collegiate Gothic architecture in the United States, built to plans drawn up by William Burges, with F.H. Kimball as supervising architect. The Long Walk has been expanded and is connected with several other buildings. On the northernmost end there is the chapel, whose western side is connected to the Downes and Williams Memorial building. Heading south, the next building is Jarvis Hall, named after Abraham Jarvis. Jarvis becomes Northam Towers heading south, then Seabury Hall. Seabury Hall, named for Samuel Seabury, is connected to Hamlin Hall. To Hamlin&#x27;s east is Cook, then Goodwin and then Woodward. The dormitories on the Long Walk end there, and the terminal building on the south end of the long walk is Clement/Cinestudio. Clement is the chemistry building; Cinestudio a student run movie theater. If one travels to the south of Hamlin there will be Mather Hall and the Dean of Students Office.

=== Main quadrangle ===
Trinity&#x27;s campus features a central green known as the Main Quad, designed by famed architect Frederick Law Olmsted. The large expanse of grass is bound on the west by the Long Walk, on the east by the Lower Long Walk, on the north by the chapel, and on the south by the Cook and Goodwin-Woodward dormitories. Trinity&#x27;s green is notable for its unusually large, rectangular size, running the entire length of the Long Walk and with no walkways traversing it. Trees on the Quad have been planted in a &#x27;T&#x27; configuration (for Trinity) with the letter&#x27;s base at the statue of Bishop Brownell (built 1867). and its top running the length of the Long Walk.

==== Film ====
Cinestudio is an art cinema with 1930s-style design. An article in the &quot;Hartford Advocate&quot; described this non-profit organization, which depends solely on grants and the efforts of volunteer workers who are paid in free movies.

==== Music ====
Trinity College hosts the Albert Schweitzer Organ Festival, one of the top competitions for young organists in North America. The festival features performances on the chapel organ, which was designed by Charles Nazarian, a college alumnus and pipe organ designer, in consultation with Clarence Watters, who was the chapel organist and head of the college&#x27;s music department from 1932 to 1967. The organ incorporates pipes from the chapel’s original 1932 Aeolian-Skinner organ and was built in 1971 by Austin Organs of Hartford.

The Chapel Singers perform concerts on campus as well as on domestic and international tours. Trinity also hosts the annual Trinity International Hip Hop Festival. The festival was founded in 2006 with the goal of unifying Trinity with the city of Hartford.

Since 2006, Trinity&#x27;s WRTC FM radio station has broadcast the Trinity Samba Fest from the Hartford waterfront featuring regional and international talent.

===Academic regalia===
Trinity followed the European pattern of using academic regalia from its foundation, and was one of only four US institutions (all associated with the Episcopal Church) to assign gowns and hoods for its degrees in 1883. There were six degrees awarded at the time, all taking a black gown of silk or stuff and a hood of black silk lined according to the degree: B.A. white silk, M.A. dove-colored silk, B.D. crimson silk, D.D. scarlet silk, L.L.D. pink silk, Mus.D. purple silk.

In 1894, a year before the introduction of the intercollegiate code on academic costume, the college brought in a new scheme of academic regalia. The hoods and gowns followed the shape of those used at the University of Oxford except that the hood for Doctors of Divinity was of the shape used at the University of Cambridge. 

A variety of different colours and fabrics were used for the hoods: B.A. black stuff edged palatinate purple, B.S. black stuff edged light blue silk, B.Litt. black stuff edged russet brown silk, B.D. black silk edged scarlet silk (not in use by 1957), L.L.B. black silk edged dark blue silk (not in use by 1957), Mus.B. black silk edged pink silk (not in use by 1957), M.A. black silk lined palatinate purple silk, M.S. black stuff lined light blue silk, D.D. scarlet cloth lined black silk, D.Litt. scarlet silk-lined russet brown silk, L.L.D. scarlet silk lined dark blue silk, D.C.L. crimson silk lined black silk, Mus.D. white silk-lined pink silk, D.Sc. black silk lined light blue silk, Ph.D. black silk lined people silk (not in use by 1957), M.D. scarlet silk lined maroon silk (not in use by 1957). 

D.P.H. black cloth lined salmon pink silk (1945), D.H.Litt. scarlet silk-lined people silk (1947), D.Hum. white silk-lined crimson (1957), and D.S.T. scarlet silk-lined blue with a gold chevron (1957) were later added. 

As of 2018, the hoods for doctorates (except the Ph.D. and M.D.) and for the M.Mus. remain in use for honorary degrees, with the further addition since 1957 of the D.F.A. wrote lined white with a red Chevron.

<doc id="502349" wikidata="Q243327" url="?curid=502349" title="Changwon">
<text>Changwon (; ) is the capital and largest city of South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea (with a population of 1,025,702 ), and the 11th largest city of the country.

A port city, Changwon is bordered by Masan Bay to the south, and the cities of Busan and Gimhae to the east. The city of Miryang lies to the northeast, and Jinju to the west.

The region has been inhabited since the Bronze Age, and its urban areas have been renamed and re-organized many times throughout history. In 1974, with the creation of the Changwon National Industrial Complex, the three historically interdependent cities of Masan, Jinhae District, and Changwon began to undergo significant economic development, growing into an important industrial centre. On 1 July 2010, the cities of Changwon, Jinhae, and Masan merged to form the current city of Changwon.

As Korea&#x27;s first planned city, modeled after Canberra, Australia, Changwon uses accessible urban planning including many parks and separate residential and industrial areas. The city has also branded itself an &quot;environmental capital&quot; with the municipal government actively participating in climate change conferences and committing to the development of sustainable policies like the globally recognized bike-sharing program, Nubija.

==History==
=== Early history ===
Populated since the early Bronze Age, the area surrounding Masan Bay would have been a wide open region between the ocean and the hilly lands of the coastal plain. Today ruins can be found in the area dating from the Iron Age. Typical Iron Age landmarks include Bangyedong monuments, dolmens, holy mounds, lower molar sites, and dolmens from Bronze Age settlements.

In 209 AD, during the Three Kingdoms period, the area was named Gulja-gun, a province of the Silla kingdom. During the Unified Silla Period, this region was renamed to Uian-gun in 739 AD, during the reorganization of all Silla provinces, then in the Goryeo Period, to Uichang-hyeon.

The name Changwon was first used in 1408 during the Joseon period, when King Taejong established the city as Changwon-bu. In 1415, he renamed Changwon-bu to Changwon-dohobu. Later during the King Sunjo Period (1601), it became Changwondae-do hobu.

In 1895, the country was reorganized into 23 divisions by King Gojong, and Changwondae-do hobu was split into Changwon-gun and Ungcheon-gun. In 1908 Ungcheon-gun merged with nearby Jinhae-gun. During the Japanese colonial period, the city became known as Masan-bu, and Masan Port was opened. Eventually, Changwon was separated from Masan-bu.

=== Post-Korean War ===
In 1970, the Masan Free Export Zone was opened to encourage foreign business to move to the area. In 1974, Changwon was selected to be an industrial and residential centre, as well as the provincial capital. The Changwon Industrial Complex was built in the south of the city, while Changwon began urban planning modelling itself after Canberra, Australia.

The country&#x27;s longest straight road was constructed in Changwon, with a length of , with the industrial park to the south and residential complexes constructed to the north. This road, Changwon Daero, is meant to serve as an airplane runway in a state of emergency as Changwon was designed to be South Korea&#x27;s emergency backup capital city. Underground walkways are able to serve as bomb shelters and roads and buildings in the planned city are numbered for efficient use in evacuation.

In 1985, the Korean War Monument () in Changwon&#x27;s Uichang gu was constructed. The monument is &quot;dedicated to the 1,142 soldiers from Gyeongsangnam province that died in the Korean War.&quot;

On 1 July 2010, the three neighboring cities of Masan, Changwon and Jinhae unified to create &quot;Unified Changwon City&quot;, with a population of 1.04 million.

==Geography==

Changwon is located on the southeastern coast of the Korean Peninsula, on the Nakdong River delta looking out onto Masan Bay. The city is surrounded by mountains, the highest of which are Mt. Bulmo (), Mt. Jeongbyeong (), and Mt. Jangbok ().

The city also comprises several small islands in Masan Bay and along the coast including Dot island, Sokuri island, and several uninhabited islands.

The city has four distinct seasons. The climate of Changwon is a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) with very warm summers and cold winters. The average temperature ranged between in January to in August. The average annual precipitation is . Between 1980 and 1990 there was an annual average of around 116 sunny days a year (32% of the year), and between 1990 and 2000 an average of 135 (37%).

==Cityscape==
=== Administrative divisions===
Changwon has 5 administrative districts (&quot;Gu&quot;) which are divided into 54 neighborhoods (&quot;dong&quot;), 5 in Uichang District, 7 in Seongsan District, 12 in Masanhoewon District, 15 in Masanhappo District and 13 in Jinhae District.


=== Neighborhoods ===
The development of Changwon into an industrial city during the 1960s and 1970s has led to a city structure that is bisected by one main avenue called Changwon Daero, meaning Changwon big road. To the south are the factories, to the north are all of the residential areas. Changwon Daero also serves as emergency runway for military purposes.

The Financial district is located in the southern part of Jungang-dong and Sangnam-dong, while the government district located northern part of Youngho-dong and Shinwol-dong.

The Changdong Art Village has many murals and artwork on display throughout the streets. Originally Masan&#x27;s old town, when businesses began to disperse, &quot;ateliers, cafés, and galleries took over the vacant stores&quot; transforming the area into a thriving art district.

The Sangnam neighborhood is the central part of greater Changwon. The main part of this neighborhood, the Sangnam Commercial District (), is the main nightlife area, with many bars, hotels, business bars, noraebangs, and restaurants. On every day of the month with a date that ends in 4 or 9 the market &quot;Sangnam-sijang&quot; is open and bustling for business. This is the largest farmer&#x27;s market within the city, with vendors selling fresh seafood, vegetables, and other groceries as well as clothing and pottery. There is also a large-scale residential complex of high-rise apartments.

Jungan-dong, located just west of Sangnam, is the &quot;old town&quot; and extended central area of the city. There is more nightlife here than restaurants, and local English speaking expats often frequent the area for drinks and laughs, often living very nearby. This is the most likely place to meet one of the foreign English teachers, engineers and armed services residence of the area.

==Economy==
Changwon owes its rapid growth since the 1970s primarily to the Changwon industrial Complex, a hub of factories dominated by heavy industry which employs 82,000 and leads the chemical, industrial, and heavy machinery sectors of the Korean economy. In September 2010, the Changwon Industrial Complex exceeded 2,000 tenant companies. The tenants are 97.8% (1,957) small-to-medium—sized businesses, while large corporations make up 2.2%(44) including Samsung Techwin, GM Korea, LG Electronics, Hyundai Rotem, Doosan Heavy Industries &amp; Construction, Doosan Infracore, Hyosung, Hyundai Wia and STX Corporation.

The defense industry of Changwon makes up a large part of its industrial output and the majority of South Korea&#x27;s weapons manufacturing. 70% of South Korea&#x27;s defense industry is based in Changwon. The city was chosen to host the military defense industry because of the city&#x27;s natural basin shape and coastal access. Major defense companies like Hanwha Defense and Hyundai Rotem manufacturing the K9 Thunder and K2 Black Panther respectively are based out of Changwon.

As the provincial capital, Changwon is home to several government offices, and the Jinhae District district contains a large naval base housing various units of the Republic of Korea Navy.

Changwon&#x27;s Gross Regional Domestic Product is 21.7 trillion won which is higher than that of Gwangju and Daejeon. It earned 29 billion dollars through exports in 2008, more than Busan, Gwangju, Daejeon or Daegu.

=== Healthcare ===
Although a growing divide between Changwon&#x27;s vibrant, modern west side and its older east side, has been identified as a source of socioeconomic and health inequality among its citizens, Changwon&#x27;s municipal government has responded with renewed commitment to ensuring the social determinants of health for all citizens. Changwon&#x27;s Healthy City Initiative has undertaken several initiatives to promote better health including the implementation of a bike-sharing system, &quot;the development of walking trails in apartment complex areas&quot; accessible to 85% of its citizens, building a new publicly funded health centre in the east side, and the installation of defibrillators in public areas like shopping centres and apartment complexes, giving Changwon &quot;tremendous potential as an international model&quot; for cities wishing to encourage public health.

<text>The Brooklyn Cyclones are a Minor League Baseball team of the South Atlantic League and the High-A affiliate of the New York Mets. They are based in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, and play at Maimonides Park, just off the Coney Island Boardwalk.

Brooklyn won six division titles and two NYPL championships. In 2001, the Cyclones were declared co-league champions with the Williamsport Crosscutters, being forced to prematurely end their championship series due to the September 11 attacks, despite the Cyclones leading the series one game to none. Their second NYPL championship came in 2019, representing the first title for a professional sports team based in Brooklyn since the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers.

The club was owned by the Mets from its inception through 2024, when it was sold to Diamond Baseball Holdings, a conglomerate that operates over 40 Minor League Baseball teams in the United States and Canada.

==History==

The Cyclones began as the St. Catharines, Ontario, St. Catharines Blue Jays (later St. Catharines Stompers) in 1986 as a team in the New York–Penn League. They were named for their parent club, the Toronto Blue Jays. In 1995, the team was sold by the city of Toronto to a group of local investors which included former Toronto catcher Ernie Whitt.

In 1999, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced a deal that would bring two minor league baseball teams to the boroughs outside Manhattan. New ballparks would be constructed for the Staten Island Yankees and the Cyclones. Prior to the 2000 season, the team was bought and moved to Queens, becoming known as the Queens Kings. The club played its 2000 season at Jack Kaiser Stadium on the St. John&#x27;s University campus in Jamaica, in the borough of Queens, remaining a Blue Jays affiliate for one last season.

A &quot;name-the-team&quot; contest was held to determine a new name for the franchise. The winning selection, Cyclones, refers to the famous Coney Island Cyclone roller coaster at nearby Astroland amusement park on Coney Island. The Mets&#x27; Double-A affiliate, the Binghamton Rumble Ponies, are also named after amusement park rides, specifically, the 6 antique carousels found in or near Binghamton, New York.

The team&#x27;s new park, which was then called KeySpan Park, was completed in time for the 2001 season. Brooklyn had been without professional baseball since the Brooklyn Dodgers left Ebbets Field for Los Angeles, California in 1958. After approximately three weeks of play, additional seats had to be added to the stadium to accommodate fans.

The Cyclones managed by Edgar Alfonzo played well in their opening season with the best record in the league (52–24), where they led the NY Penn-League with a 2.35 team ERA. They defeated the Staten Island Yankees in a classic NYPL opening playoff round. The deciding game won by the Cyclones 4–1 featured trickery by Catcher Brett Kay who faked giving up on a play only to receive a laser throw from John Toner to tag out a runner at the plate. advancing to the championship series against the Williamsport Crosscutters. The Cyclones traveled to Bowman Field in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, winning the series opener on September 10, 2001 by a score of 8–4. The potential championship clincher was scheduled for September 11 in Brooklyn. However, due to the September 11 attacks, all minor league baseball playoffs were canceled. The Cyclones and Crosscutters were declared co-champions.

The 2002 season was filled with inconsistent play and questionable pitching decisions by manager Howard Johnson leading to a .500 season. Scott Kazmir pitched to a 0.50 ERA in five starts and had 34 strikeouts in only 18 innings pitched.

In 2003, the Cyclones managed by Tim Teufel won the McNamara division title with brilliant pitching led by starters, soon to be major leaguers, Matt Lindstrom and Brian Bannister and by relievers Robert Paulk and Carlos Muñiz. Despite a drop in run production, the Cyclones pitching staff willed their way into the playoffs, beating the Oneonta Tigers 2 games to 1 only to lose in the NYPL Championship to the Williamsport Crosscutters 2 games to none.

The 2004 season brought the most complete Cyclones team ever. Managed by Tony Tijerina, three batters hit over .300 and five starting pitchers made their starts in rotation for the last 55 games of the season except one game. The Cyclones won the McNamara division title only to lose to the Tri-City ValleyCats in controversial fashion. With the series tied, the Cyclones were leading 3–0 in the 3rd inning when the games was held up and eventually cancelled by rain, which wiped out the score. After another rainout, Game 3 was played from the beginning where the Cyclones lost the deciding game 7–1. A new rule was placed by the NY-Penn League that any games suspended because of rain, if a team or teams have scored runs in the game, the suspended game will be picked from the inning when the game was called.
The 2005 season managed by Mookie Wilson was hampered by inconsistent relief pitching that hampered games in the later innings despite a good offense. The Cyclones finished third and missed the playoffs. On August 23, 2005, The Cyclones and KeySpan Park hosted the first-ever New York–Penn League All-Star Game, which was won by the National League–affiliated team. The winning pitcher was Bobby Parnell. Also that year, the Cyclones became a major partner of Brooklyn&#x27;s High School of Sports Management, a small school located down the block from KeySpan Park on West 19th Street and Mermaid Ave.

The 2006 season managed by George Greer mirrored the team name. A 7-game losing streak to start the season was followed by a 10-game winning streak which led the streaky Cyclones to the NYPL Playoffs in a dramatic extra-inning victory against the Vermont Lake Monsters in the final game of the season. The Cyclones would lose to the SI Yanks in the NYPL opening playoff round 2 games to none. On July 20, 2006, the Cyclones and the Oneonta Tigers took part in the longest game in the history of the New York–Penn League, a 26-inning marathon that the Cyclones lost, 6–1. The game took 6 hours and 40 minutes to complete. The Cyclones scored their lone run in the first inning; Oneonta tied the game in the fourth and then did not score again until they scored five runs in the top of the 26th inning. Cyclones manager George Greer was ejected from the contest in the first inning for arguing an umpire&#x27;s call on a force play at second base.

The 2007 season managed by Edgar Alfonzo had the second most successful season in team history with a 49–25 record. With a consistent offense, great pitching and the best defense in the league, the Cyclones powered their way to winning its fourth McNamara division title and sweeping the SI Yankees in two straight games in the NYPL opening playoff round. Game One produced the best road win in team history when the Cyclones beat the SI Yanks, 8–4. However, the Cyclones went on to getting swept in disappointing fashion by the Auburn Doubledays for the NYPL Championship. After giving up a leadoff home run to shortstop Matt Bouchard, future Toronto Blue Jays starting pitcher Brett Cecil pitched one hit ball in 7 innings as the Doubledays won the game 4–1. On September 7, 2007, during the final regular season game (a 5–4 victory over the Lowell Spinners), the Cyclones set an all-time single-game attendance record of 10,073—2,573 more than the stadium&#x27;s seating capacity in 2001. That season, the team won its fourth McNamara division title.

The 2008 season, managed again by Edgar Alfonzo, was marred by a poor start but recovered with a torrid finish at 45–30, narrowly missing the playoffs after losing the final game of the season to the Aberdeen Ironbirds 5–3 in extra innings. The team produced major leaguers and future New York Mets Ike Davis and Jenrry Mejía. But the team was marred with an inconsistent offense with less than average results with runners in scoring position.

On August 23, 2009, Cyclones pitcher Brandon Moore threw a 7-inning no-hitter in the first game of a doubleheader against the Aberdeen IronBirds, 5–0, at Ripken Stadium. Moore walked three and hit one batter, with only one IronBird reaching second base. This came seven years to the day Miguel Pinango threw a nine-inning one-hitter for the Cyclones, pitching innings of no-hit ball.

On February 4, 2010, the team announced that the new name of their home would be called Municipal Credit Union (MCU) Park, replacing KeySpan as the naming right sponsor, which had held the naming rights from the opening of the stadium in 2001. In addition to the naming rights, MCU and the Cyclones entered into a comprehensive 11-year marketing partnership that launches the Cyclones’ 10th season in Brooklyn. The partner agreement is scheduled to last until 2020.

The 2010 season saw the Cyclones, under the leadership of Wally Backman, lead the league with a record of 52–24, but the Cyclones fell in the Championship series to Tri-City ValleyCats. The Cyclones would make the playoffs as the wild card team in 2011 and 2012, but would not make it out of the semifinals. The Cyclones failed to make the playoffs in 2013 and lost a tie-breaker in 2014 on and missed the playoffs on the last day of the season.

Since 2014, the Cyclones have dedicated one night a year as a tribute to the popular sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, featuring various show tributes such as an &quot;Elaine Benes dancing contest&quot;, determining if a fan had either picked or scratched their nose, the Cyclones wearing &quot;Puffy Shirt&quot;–styled jerseys, appearances from former actors and giveaways honoring the show. This game has since become one of the Cyclones&#x27; most popular events, regularly selling out in advance and drawing fans of both baseball and &quot;Seinfeld&quot; from near and far.

The 2015 season was the first time in franchise history the Brooklyn Cyclones finished below .500. The Cyclones would go on to have losing records in 2016 and 2017, but lost the tie-breaker and once again missed out on the playoffs on the last day of the season in 2018.

The Brooklyn Cyclones returned to the New York-Penn League playoffs in 2019, thanks to a strong finish to end the season, which included a series sweep of the Staten Island Yankees in what would be the final match-up between the longtime rivals. In the semi-finals, the Cyclones faced division rival and wild card winner in the Hudson Valley Renegades. The Cyclones fell to the Renegades 5–4 in Game 1. The Cyclones took Game 2 in Brooklyn by a score of 1–0, thanks to a solo homer from Jed Lowrie, who was on a rehab assignment from the Mets. The Cyclones won Game 3 on a walkoff double from Ranfy Adon, sending them to the New York-Penn League Championship.

The Cyclones faced the Lowell Spinners in a series that was dubbed &quot;An MiLB Rematch of 1986&quot;, as the Spinners were a Red Sox farm team. The Cyclones took Game 1 in Lowell by a score of 2–1, before dropping game 2 in Brooklyn by a score of 3–1. Game 3 saw the Cyclones take a 2–0 lead in the bottom of the 2nd, but the Spinners tied it up the next half inning. After a solo homer by Marino Campana in the Top of the 7th put Lowell up 3–2, the Cyclones staged a rally to take a 4–3 lead, en route to winning the 2019 New York-Penn League Championship. The Cyclones were managed by former Met Edgardo Alfonzo, whose brother, Edgar, managed the Brooklyn Cyclones in 2001. Other coaches on the team included Pitching Coach Josue Matos, Hitting Coach Delwyn Young and Bench Coach Endy Chavez

The Cyclones would be the final New York-Penn League champions, as the COVID-19 Pandemic cancelled the 2020 season and the ensuing MiLB realignment led to the dissolving of the New York-Penn League.

In October 2020, Steve Cohen bought the New York Mets, Syracuse Mets, St. Lucie Mets and Brooklyn Cyclones from the Wilpon family. This has led to a unique situation, as the longtime Vice President of the Brooklyn Cyclones is also named Steve Cohen, but unrelated to the new owner.

The Cyclones&#x27; main rivals prior to the 2021 restructuring of Minor League Baseball were the Staten Island Yankees, a rivalry often called the &quot;Battle of the Boroughs&quot;, after the boroughs of Brooklyn and Staten Island, or the &quot;Battle for the Bridge&quot;, after the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge which separated the two teams. Only apart, the two teams had the closest proximity in the Minor Leagues. The two teams generally sold out the games which pitted them against each other. A major contribution to this intense rivalry was the fact that both parent teams were also based in New York (the Mets in Queens, and the Yankees in the Bronx). Other regional rivals included the Hudson Valley Renegades and the Tri-City ValleyCats.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Cyclones were organized into the 12-team High-A East. In 2022, the High-A East became known as the South Atlantic League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

In December 2024, Steve Cohen announced that he had sold the Cyclones to Diamond Baseball Holdings.

==Alumni==
The first Cyclone to break into the major leagues was infielder Danny Garcia, who made his debut with the New York Mets on September 2, 2003, at Shea Stadium. Scott Kazmir, who played with Brooklyn in 2002, made his major league debut with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 2004. Still with the Rays in 2008, Kazmir was tagged with the loss in Game 1 of the 2008 World Series. He is the first former Cyclone to reach the World Series, though Lenny DiNardo, who pitched with the Cyclones in 2001, won a World Series ring with the Boston Red Sox in 2004 while on the Disabled List.

Mike Jacobs, who was a member of the inaugural 2001 Cyclones team, made his Mets debut on August 21, 2005, hitting a three-run pinch-hit home run off Washington Nationals pitcher Esteban Loaiza. In 30 games with 100 at bats for the Mets, Jacobs hit 11 home runs and had 23 RBI before being traded to the Florida Marlins after the season.

In April 2006, Brian Bannister became the first Cyclone pitcher to make his debut with the Mets in a game against the Washington Nationals at Shea. The following April, sidearm reliever Joe Smith, who pitched for the Cyclones in 2006, made his major league debut on opening day for the Mets against the St. Louis Cardinals. Smith pitched a scoreless third of an inning in the Mets win. First baseman/outfielder Nick Evans was called up on May 24, 2008, as an injury replacement. Evans, who played with the Cyclones in 2005, had 3 doubles in his first major league game. Ike Davis played for the Cyclones in 2008. In 2012, Davis led the Mets with 32 home runs. Daniel Murphy made his Mets debut in 2008. In 2015, Murphy was the NLCS MVP in the Mets series victory against the Chicago Cubs. Juan Lagares was called up by the Mets in 2013 and won a Gold Glove in 2014. In 2015, Michael Conforto was called up by the Mets and hit two home runs in Game 4 of the 2015 World Series, becoming the third youngest player to hit two home runs in a World Series game. The Mets would lose the World Series as former Cyclone Wilmer Flores struck out to make the final out. The strike out was caught by former Cyclone Drew Butera of the Royals. Pete Alonso made his Mets debut in 2019. Alonso broke the rookie home run record with 53 home runs and won the NL Rookie of the Year.

==Retired and honored numbers==
A total of 10 numbers hang on the press level of Maimonides Park.

Brooklyn Dodgers: 4: Duke Snider; 14: Joan and Gil Hodges 17: Carl Erskine; 36: Don Newcombe; 42: Jackie Robinson;

Brooklyn Cyclones: 6: Danny Garcia; 19: Brian Bannister; 20: Dillon Gee; 35: Ángel Pagán;

NOTE: A Cyclones player may still wear these numbers, with the exception of 14, and 42. The numbers that may not be worn by Cyclones players are numbers that have been retired by the Mets.

On August 22, 2011, the Brooklyn Cyclones also honored Pia Toscano, who sang the anthem prior to a game in 2003 by putting a plaque on the press level.

On August 15, 2014, the Cyclones added Joan Hodges, the widow of Gil Hodges, to the ring of Honored Numbers.

==Mascots==
The Cyclones have two mascots, Sandy the Seagull and Pee-Wee. Sandy, the primary mascot, has been with the team since the inaugural Cyclones season in 2001. Pee-wee was introduced in 2003 as Sandy&#x27;s adopted son. Sandy is named for Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax, while Pee-Wee was named after Brooklyn Dodgers shortstop Pee Wee Reese. Even though Hurricane Sandy damaged MCU Park and Coney Island, the Cyclones kept the name Sandy on their mascot.

In 2006, the team introduced a new unnamed mascot: a blow-up &quot;ZOOperstars!&quot; type pelican. Despite a contest to name the character, it was never given an official name. The Pelican has not made an appearance since the 2006 season. In 2008, Maverick the Wonder Dog was introduced. He was a real Chocolate Labrador Retriever who was owned by one of the Cyclones staff members. The goal was to have Maverick learn tricks like picking up baseballs and bats. Like the Pelican, Maverick lasted only one season.

A Hot Dog race is held at every game at Maimonides Park, which is sponsored by Nathan&#x27;s Famous. The first Nathan&#x27;s store is located two blocks away from the ballpark. The three hot dogs currently racing are Ketchup, Mustard, and Relish. For many years Relish has become the loveable loser because he either wins very few races or none at all during the season.

==On field entertainers==
MCs

2001–2003: &quot;Party Marty&quot; Haber, a member of the Cyclones front office.

2003–2019, 2022-present: King Henry A local entertainer. In 2013, King Henry became the main on field entertainer. He was not brought back for the 2021 season before returning in 2022.

2007–2010: Jay Moran, who had served as PA Announcer in 2006.

2011: Jason Negron

2012: Dan Pecoraro, a member of the Cyclones front office.

2021: Christina Moore, a member of the Cyclones front office.

In 2013, Bucky the Buccaneer was introduced. Every time the Brooklyn Cyclones would score a run, this pirate themed mascot would run around the field from one dugout to the next, waving his rally flags in excitement. Bucky was played by a first year intern, Daniel DePasquale. He worked with the Brooklyn Cyclones for 2 seasons.

Beach Bums and Surf Squad

The original &quot;Cyclones Beach Bums&quot; were a promotional team of men and women who entertained the ballpark from 2003 through 2008, were seen all over the ballpark dancing, interacting with fans, and handing out promotional items. In 2009, the team decided to hire an all women dance team to replace the Beach Bums, but still retaining the Beach Bum name. The dance team is similar to that of the New York Knicks, New York Dragons and New York Islanders.

Following the 2016 season, the all women&#x27;s dance team was done away with and the team was reverted to what it was in the past. The team was rebranded as the Surf Squad.

==Public address announcers==
2001–2005: Dom Alagia.

2006: Sean Howard for 1 month, replaced by Jay Moran a PA Announcer at St. John&#x27;s.

2007 – July 2010: David Freeman, who had served as PA Announcer for the Queens Kings. Freeman left to become an MLB Scorer with the Mets and Yankees.

August 2010 – 2021: Mark Fratto, who also serves as the PA Announcer for NYCFC, the Washington Wizards, the Westchester Knicks and Sky Blue FC.

2021 Colin Cosell, who also serves as the New York Mets PA Announcer.

WKRB (90.3 FM) was the official radio station of the Cyclones. It served as radio home for every Cyclones season through 2016, with the exception of 2012 when WSOU was the official radio station of the Cyclones. Cyclones games will air occasionally on BCAT and SNY.

2001–2011: Warner Fusselle and Reginald Armstrong served as radio voices of the Brooklyn Cyclones for the first two years and Warner continued until his death on June 10, 2012, a week prior to the 2012 Cyclones season.

2012: David Rind, Vincent Coughlin and Chris Paizis, who all called Seton Hall baseball, split the broadcasting duties, with Rind serving as the road announcer.

2013: David Greenwald served as the radio voice of the Cyclones for 1 year on WKRB.

2014–2017: Stu Johnson. In addition to Brooklyn Cyclones games, Stu also announced Brooklyn Bolts games on WKRB. Jake Eisenberg joined Johnson in the booth for the 2017 season.

2018–2022: Keith Raad, along with Dom Savino (2018–2021) and Nick DeLuca (2022). Raad left the Cyclones in 2023 to join the Mets radio broadcast team.

<text>Conrad Nicholson &quot;Nicky&quot; Hilton Jr. (July 6, 1926 – February 5, 1969) was an American socialite, hotel heir, and businessman. He was the eldest son of Hilton Hotels founder Conrad Hilton.

==Life and career==

Conrad Nicholson Hilton Jr. was born in Dallas, Texas. His parents were Conrad Hilton, the founder of Hilton Hotels, and Mary Adelaide Barron. Hilton had three younger siblings: Barron, Eric, and Francesca. He is a grand-uncle of Paris Hilton and Nicky Hilton.

Growing up he did not take interest in the family business and he dropped out of Loyola University in Los Angeles to join the Navy. His father enrolled him at École hôtelière de Lausanne in Lausanne, Switzerland but he was suspended after six months. In 1951, he became the vice president of the Hilton Corporation and manager of the Bel Air Hotel. In his later years, he was a director and chairman of the executive committee of the Hilton International Company.

Hilton died at the age of 42 from a sudden heart attack due to alcoholism on February 5, 1969. His funeral was held at St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Los Angeles. He is interred in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

== Personal life ==
Hilton dated various Hollywood starlets and gained a reputation for being a playboy.

Hilton had an affair with his stepmother, Zsa Zsa Gabor, according to claims made by Gabor after his death. Gabor stated in her 1991 autobiography &quot;One Lifetime Is Not Enough&quot;, that their affair began when her marriage to Hilton&#x27;s father was on the rocks and ended during his marriage to Elizabeth Taylor.

In October 1949, Hilton met Taylor at the Mocambo nightclub in Los Angeles. The couple were married in a highly publicized ceremony at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills on May 6, 1950. They had a tempestuous eight-month marriage due to his gambling, drinking, heroin addiction, and abusive behavior. During one of his violent outbursts, Hilton kicked Taylor in the stomach and caused her to have a miscarriage. Taylor announced their separation in December 1950; she was granted a divorce on grounds of mental cruelty on January 29, 1951.

In September 1951, actress Betsy von Furstenberg announced her engagement to Hilton. They planned to marry the following spring but they were never married. 

In May 1954, Hilton was arrested on drunk charges and received two years of probation.

In the 1950s, Hilton dated actresses Terry Moore, Mamie Van Doren, Arlene Solof, and Jeanne Carmen. In 1957, he dated actresses Natalie Wood and Joan Collins at the same time. Shortly after, he dated Mexican actress Silvia Pinal, whom he met at the opening of a hotel in Acapulco.

In 1958, Hilton married Patricia McClintock, an oil heiress from Oklahoma. They had two sons, Conrad Nicholson Hilton III and Michael Otis Hilton. Their marriage deteriorated as Hilton became addicted to the sleeping pill Seconal and mixed it with hard liquor. McClintock sued for divorce on February 10, 1964. She charged Hilton with &quot;causing her extreme mental and physical suffering&quot; but they later reconciled. In August 1967, McClintock filed for divorce again, accusing Hilton of &quot;repeated acts and threats of violence.&quot; The divorce was never granted but they were separated at the time of Hilton&#x27;s death.

<doc id="502358" wikidata="Q3354921" url="?curid=502358" title="Johan Henrik Nebelong">
<text>Johan Henrik Nebelong (20 July 1817 – 2 March 1871) was a Danish architect. He worked in Norway from 1840 to 1853 and was best known for interior design work on &quot;Oscarshall&quot; (1847–1852). Nebelong also taught at the Royal Academy of Arts in Copenhagen.

== Biography ==
He was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. He was the son of Johan Henrik Nebelong and Anna Christine Schreyber and was a younger brother of architect Niels Sigfried Nebelong. Nebelong was a student of Professor Gustav Friedrich Hetsch in Copenhagen. He later enrolled at the Royal Academy of Arts. At the Academy, he won the prestigious silver medal in 1839. The accolade was followed immediately by a proposal to come to Christiania (now Oslo) and assist the architect Hans Linstow. Nebelong was hired to assist Linstow in drawing interior works of the Norwegian Royal Palace. In 1842, he received a government grant to study in Germany.

His buildings include the customs house (&quot;Tollpakkhuset&quot;), Commanders living quarters at Akershus festning (&quot;Kommandantboligen&quot;) and &quot;De naturhistoriske samlinger&quot; at Bergen Museum.
He was also involved in renovation projects including the excavations of the Hovedøya monastery and reconstruction on Heddal Stave Church (&quot;Heddal stavkirke&quot;) in Telemark (1851).
Nebelong also worked closely with architect Heinrich Ernst Schirmer, decorative painter Peter Frederik Wergmann (1802–1869), and painter Johannes Flintoe. This quartet worked under the guidance of Hans Linstow. Although Linstow&#x27;s influence stimulated much in Nebelong, the latter soon developed his signature designs and style. Nebelong is often associated with the new Swiss style and the unique style with which he infused his refurbished masonry designs such as the large apartment building for Danish builder Nestor Malthe.

== Buildings ==
The apartment building (&quot;Heiberggården&quot;) of Professor Christen Heiberg was the first building Nebelong designed in Swiss style. The building on the corner of Karl Johans gate and Rosenkrantz gate in Oslo was erected in 1844. The swiped brick building, featured a protruding, post borne roof over a porch. It had two wings with low brick tiled gable roof.

In 1847 Nebelong designed the Santa&#x27;s Boys School in Rosenkrantz. It had a brick facade with round arched window openings.

<doc id="502359" wikidata="Q979247" url="?curid=502359" title="Captain (ice hockey)">
<text>In ice hockey, the captain is the player designated by a team as the only person authorized to speak with the game officials regarding rule interpretations when the captain is on the ice. At most levels of play each team must designate one captain and a number of alternate captains (usually two or three) who speak to the officials when the captain is on the bench. Captains wear a &quot;C&quot; on their sweaters, while alternate captains wear an &quot;A&quot;.

Officially captains have no other responsibility or authority, although they may, depending on the league or individual team, have various informal duties, such as participation in pre-game ceremonies or other events outside the game. As with most team sports that designate captains, the captain is usually a well-respected player and a team leader.

==Responsibilities and importance==

According to International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and National Hockey League (NHL) rules, the only player allowed to speak with referees about rule interpretations is the captain, or, if the captain is not on the ice, an alternate captain.

Although the rules do not specify any other distinction between the captain and their teammates, the captain has numerous responsibilities to the team, particularly in North American professional hockey. The captain is a dressing room leader, and also represents the players&#x27; concerns to management.

The captain is often considered the primary representative of the team to the public, and sometimes is responsible for organizing the team&#x27;s social functions and performing ceremonial on-ice functions, such as award presentations or ceremonial faceoffs.

==Selection==
NHL teams need not designate the same player as captain from game to game, though most teams do. When Boston Bruins captain Terry O&#x27;Reilly retired, Ray Bourque and Rick Middleton were named as co-captains of the team for the 1985–86 season. Middleton wore the &quot;C&quot; during home games and Bourque for road games during the season&#x27;s first half, and the two switched for the second half. This arrangement continued until Middleton retired in 1988 and Bourque became the sole captain. Some teams name two (such as the Buffalo Sabres during the 2005–06 and 2006–07 NHL seasons) or three (such as the Vancouver Canucks during the 1990–91 season) captains for a season. Some teams rotate captains rather than keep one for an extended period of time (the Minnesota Wild rotated captaincy every one or two months until the 2009–10 season, when Mikko Koivu was named the first permanent captain since the franchise&#x27;s inception). During each NHL game, however, only one player can officially be designated as captain.

Captains are usually veteran players, though on occasion younger players are chosen. The selection is often seen as an important moment for a team, and one that can affect the team&#x27;s (and newly appointed captain&#x27;s) performance. Captains are selected by different means: in some instances, teams have held votes among their players to choose a team captain, while on other occasions, the choice was made by team management. Captains are often chosen due to their seniority in the game and years of service with their current club. However, franchise players—current or emerging stars—have also been named captains. Though not required, many captains have previously served as alternate captains of their team. Some selections or removals of NHL captaincies have been controversial, more so than the other North American professional sports leagues. For instance, in Canada men&#x27;s national ice hockey team, then-General Manager Bobby Clarke selected Eric Lindros for the 1998 Winter Olympics, considered somewhat controversial as Lindros was chosen over longer-tenured NHL captains such as Steve Yzerman, Ray Bourque and Wayne Gretzky, Clarke was also general manager of the Philadelphia Flyers whom Lindros played for professionally. In 2000, when the relationship between Clarke and Lindros deteriorated during contentious contract negotiations and the team&#x27;s handling of Lindros&#x27; injuries, the team captaincy was issued to Eric Desjardins. Tampa Bay Lightning head coach John Tortorella stripped the captaincy from Vincent Lecavalier after disagreements about the player&#x27;s skills and conditioning practices. In 1980, Darryl Sittler angrily resigned the captaincy by cutting off the &quot;C&quot; from his Toronto Maple Leafs jersey with scissors, in protest of Harold Ballard&#x27;s trade of his best friend Lanny McDonald, Ballard likened Sittler&#x27;s actions to flag burning.

The rules of the IIHF, NHL and Hockey Canada do not permit goaltenders to be designated as on-ice captains, due to the logistical challenge of having the goaltender relay rules discussions between referees and coaches and then return to the crease. The NHL introduced a rule prohibiting the goaltender from being a captain following the 1947–48 season (see § Goaltender captains below).

==Alternate captains==

Teams may designate alternate captains (often erroneously called &quot;assistant captains&quot;). Alternate captains wear the letter &quot;A&quot; on their jerseys in the same manner that team captains wear the &quot;C&quot;.

In the NHL, teams may appoint a captain and up to two alternate captains, or they may appoint three alternate captains and thus no captain. A team with a player-coach may also have no captain or alternate captains. A team commonly has three alternate captains when the team has not selected a captain, or when the serving captain is injured and misses a game. In the National Hockey League, it is common for a team to have three alternate captains if no one is assigned captain, the current captain is absent, or a goaltender is named as the captain. International and USA amateur rules do not allow this; they stipulate that &quot;each team must appoint a captain and not more than two alternate captains&quot; In the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), Western Hockey League (WHL) and minor leagues under the jurisdiction of Hockey Canada, teams are allowed to have a captain with up to three alternate captains.
If the team chooses to not appoint a captain, they are not permitted to appoint a fourth alternate captain. When the captain is off the ice or unavailable for the game, any alternate captain on the ice is responsible for fulfilling the captain&#x27;s official role as liaison to the referees.

NHL teams may choose alternate captains from game to game or appoint regular alternate captains for the season. In North America, alternate captains perform many of the same leadership and team building roles as the captain. In the 1969–70 season, the Boston Bruins had three alternate captains (Johnny Bucyk, Phil Esposito and Ed Westfall) instead of a captain sporting the &quot;C&quot;. However, as Bucyk was the most senior of the alternate captains, he was first one to be presented the Stanley Cup when the team won the championship in 1970 and 1972.

In the NCAA, a team can designate a single alternate captain to assume the role of captain, should the captain be unavailable due to injury or penalty.

==Designation on uniform==

The letter &quot;C&quot; or &quot;A&quot; is attached to the jersey of the team&#x27;s captain and alternate captains (commonly sewn at higher levels of play, though removable insignia exist so the &quot;C&quot; or &quot;A&quot; designation can be easily changed). The designation is traditionally placed on the left side of the sweater, though the IIHF, NHL and NCAA rules specify only that it must be in a &quot;conspicuous location on the front&quot; of the player&#x27;s sweater. Two teams in the NHL have sweaters where the positioning of the crest on the front leaves insufficient space on the left for the letter: the Carolina Hurricanes and New Jersey Devils both have alternate jerseys where the captain&#x27;s patch is on the right.

In the World Hockey Association&#x27;s final season of 1978-79, Paul Shmyr, the captain of the Edmonton Oilers, wore a &quot;K&quot; (for &quot;kapitan&quot;) on his sweater instead of a &quot;C&quot;, as a salute to both his personal, and the city of Edmonton&#x27;s, Ukrainian heritage.

==NHL captains==
===Records===
Steve Yzerman served as the captain of the Detroit Red Wings for 20 years/19 seasons (1986–87 to 2005–06) and 1,303 games during that time, the longest term in the history of the NHL by both years and games. The Boston Bruins&#x27; Ray Bourque was previously the longest-tenured captain in NHL history from 1985–86 to 1999–00, being co-captain for the first three seasons. Daniel Alfredsson holds the record as the longest-serving European captain serving for 14 years/13 seasons (1999–00 to 2012–13) as captain of the Ottawa Senators. Alfredsson&#x27;s record was tied by Zdeno Chara, who served as the captain of the Boston Bruins also for 14 seasons between 2006–07 and 2019–20. Brian Bellows was the youngest captain in NHL history, serving as the interim captain of the Minnesota North Stars from January to May 1984, during Craig Hartsburg&#x27;s absence from the lineup, due to injury. The youngest permanent NHL captain in history is Connor McDavid, announced as captain by the Edmonton Oilers on October 5, 2016, at the age of 19 years and 266 days.

: Player is still active as captain of their team.

&quot;Table Notes:&quot;

† An exact date for Brian Bellows&#x27; &quot;interim&quot; captaincy has not yet been determined. The North Stars captain, Craig Hartsburg, was injured on January 3, 1984, and Bellows became interim captain shortly thereafter in January 1984.

** Stan Smyl resigned as Canucks captain after the 1989–90 season. Trevor Linden, Dan Quinn, and Doug Lidster were named &quot;Tri-Captain&quot; for the 1990–91 season. Dan Quinn would be traded to the St. Louis Blues at the 1991 trade deadline, leaving Linden and Lidster as co-captains. Trevor Linden became sole captain for the start of the 1991–92 season. Exact dates for announcements and first game wearing the &quot;C&quot; in &quot;Tri-Captaincy&quot; rotation could not be determined. Date listed is Linden&#x27;s first game of the 1991–92 regular season as permanent captain.

===Stanley Cup Finals===
Jean Beliveau is the only one to have captained his team to win five Stanley Cup championships, doing so with the Montreal Canadiens between 1961 and 1971. The following captains all won four, three of them in consecutive years: Maurice Richard (1957–1960) with the Canadiens, George Armstrong with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Yvan Cournoyer (1976–1979) with the Canadiens, Denis Potvin (1980–1983) with the New York Islanders and Wayne Gretzky with the Edmonton Oilers. Dunc Munro was the first NHL captain born in Europe to lead his team to a Stanley Cup title (1926), and Charlie Gardiner was the first to accomplish the same feat in the post-WHL era (1934). Both Munro and Gardiner were born in Scotland. Derian Hatcher became the first American-born captain to win the Stanley Cup in 1999. Daniel Alfredsson was the first European-born and trained captain to lead an NHL team to the Stanley Cup Finals (2007), while Nicklas Lidstrom was the first captain born and trained in Europe to lead an NHL team to a Stanley Cup title (2008). Mark Messier was the first NHL player to win the Stanley Cup as captain of two different teams: the Edmonton Oilers in 1990 and the New York Rangers in 1994. Sidney Crosby became the youngest captain in the NHL to win the Stanley Cup in 2009 at 21 years 10 months. The youngest captain to lead his team to the Stanley Cup in the history of the trophy is Mike Grant of the 1895 Montreal Victorias, who was 21 years and 2 months at the time.

===Minority captains===
Dirk Graham became the first NHL captain of African descent when he was named captain of the Chicago Blackhawks in March 1989. Jarome Iginla, who became captain of the Calgary Flames in 2003, has been cited by ESPN as the first black captain in NHL history.
Bryce Salvador captained the New Jersey Devils from 2013 to 2015.
Kyle Okposo was captain of the Buffalo Sabres from 2022 to 2024.

===Goaltender captains===
In NHL history, there have been six goaltenders who served as official team captains:

* John Ross Roach (Toronto St. Patricks): 1924–25 season
* George Hainsworth (Montreal Canadiens): 1932–33 season
* Roy Worters (New York Americans): 1932–33 season
* Alex Connell (Ottawa Senators): 1932–33 season
* Charlie Gardiner (Chicago Black Hawks): 1933–34 season
* Bill Durnan (Montreal Canadiens): latter half of 1947–48 season

Prior to the 1948–49 season, the NHL made a change to the rules, prohibiting goaltenders from being captains or alternate captains. This was in response to complaints from opponents of the Montreal Canadiens, who complained that Durnan left his crease to argue with the referee at strategic points during games, resulting in unscheduled timeouts. This rule is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Durnan Rule.&quot;

Although the Canucks appointed goaltender Roberto Luongo as team captain for the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons, since he could not be his team&#x27;s official captain during games, Willie Mitchell was the on-ice captain, serving as liaison to the officials, and Henrik Sedin and Mattias Ohlund performed ceremonial aspects of the position such as pre-game faceoffs.

<text>The decoder pen, yes-no pen, yes-know pen or magic pen book is a combination of decoder pen or marker specially designed to reveal invisible ink-encoded pictures or writing, in the form of answers to questions or hidden parts of pictures, with specially created children&#x27;s books with hidden words and pictures. They were most popular in the 1970s, but continue to be sold at gift shops. Often they were in the form of trivia games, which enabled the player to guess before revealing the answer. Brands of books for use with decoder pens include Yes &amp; Know, and surprise Ink.

However, the pen and paper can be damaged easily if excessive rubbing is used. Therefore, most invisible ink books contain an advisory saying to use a very gentle back and forth motion - not a circular grinding motion, when using the books.

Fans of the adventure games released by Sierra Entertainment in the 1980s such as &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; and &quot;Space Quest&quot; are also familiar with the decoder pen, which was used to reveal the answers to hints in the hints book sold for each game. Eventually these were replaced by a colored translucent plastic window, which eliminated a visually interfering red pattern. 

Infocom sold similar hint books called &quot;Invisiclues&quot; for their interactive fiction games.

<text>A buggy refers to a lightweight four-wheeled carriage drawn by a single horse, though occasionally by two. Amish buggies are still regularly in use on the roadways of America. The word &quot;buggy&quot; has become a generic term for &quot;carriage&quot; in America.

Historically, in England a buggy was a two-wheeled vehicle.

== American buggy ==
A buggy is a four-wheeled American carriage made on a rectangular pattern, the body resembling a shallow box. There is a vertical leather dash with a metal rein rail on top. A single seat for two people is mounted in the middle of the box leaving room behind the seat for luggage. It is suspended by two sideways elliptic springs, one over the front axle and the other over the rear axle. The wheels are near equirotal, with the front wheels slightly smaller than the rear. Its turning radius is large, achieving only a quarter-lock before the front wheels touch the sides of the buggy body. There were many varieties built, such as adding a collapsible hood. The auto seat buggy had a curved seat similar to early motor cars.

The simple and lightweight American buggy was mass-produced, manufactured inexpensively, sold at modest prices, and widely distributed throughout the United States. It became the most common carriage in North America. According to the Museums at Stony Brook, &quot;Trade journals praised the American system that allowed the production of the &#x27;cheapest and best light vehicles for the money that are produced in the world&#x27; and boasted that &#x27;every man among us who can afford to keep a horse can afford to have a good buggy&#x27;.&quot;

The buggy was so ubiquitous that the word &quot;buggy&quot; became the generic term for &quot;carriage&quot; in the US lexicon.

Other American vehicles patterned on the same &quot;boxy&quot; style include the Surrey (two or more seats, with or without a canopy or hood), and the spring wagon or road wagon (one or more seats, longer body, two elliptic springs on the rear axle instead of one sideways spring).

== Amish buggy ==
In the 21st century, the buggy is still used as normal, everyday means of transportation by Anabaptists like the Amish, parts of the Old Order Mennonites, a few Old Order River Brethren and parts of the German-speaking &quot;Russian&quot; Mennonites in Latin America but also by the Old Order German Baptist Brethren and Old Brethren German Baptists (both are conservative Schwarzenau Brethren). The different styles of their buggies and the colors of the tops (black, grey, brown, yellow, white) can be used to distinguish one community from another, and even become part of a group&#x27;s identity.

The Amish continue to manufacture buggies for their daily transportation; both open and enclosed designs are made. The open design is similar to how buggies across America have been made for well over a century. The enclosed version is unique to their communities and is enclosed on three sides with leather screens or rolldown blinds. Amish buggies are usually fitted with lamps for night driving and are driven by a single horse, predominantly Standardbreds.

== English buggy ==
Parry and Walrond (both 1979) tell us that in England a gig fitted with a folding leather hood was sometimes called a buggy. According to William Felton (1796), a buggy is a chaise made to carry a single person. Adams (1837) suggests &quot;Buggy&quot;, along with Stanhope and Tilbury, is one of the few English-named carriages, compared to the many French named carriage types such as Cabriolet and Vis-à-vis.

<text>Chŏngjin (; ) is the capital of North Korea&#x27;s North Hamgyong Province (함경북도) and the country&#x27;s third-largest city. It is sometimes called the City of Iron. It is located in the northeast of the country.

==History==


===Prehistory===
According to archaeological findings near the lower areas of the Tumen river, evidence of human living traces back to the paleolithic period.

===Ancient and medieval history===
According to the Records of the Grand Historian, the region was where the tribe kingdoms of Buyeo, Mohe, Okjeo, Yilou, Yemaek and Sushen existed. The region later was the territory of Goguryeo. After the fall of Goguryeo in 668, the region was ruled by the Tang dynasty. During the reign of Balhae, the region was under the subdivision Donggyeongyongwonbu. The region was under the rule of the Jin dynasty and Yuan dynasty after the fall of Balhae by the Khitans.

===Modern history===

Chongjin was a small fishing village prior to the Japanese annexation of Korea; its date of establishment is unknown. The Chinese characters for its name mean &#x27;clear river crossing&#x27;. During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, Japanese forces landed at Chongjin and established a supply base due to its proximity to the front lines in Manchuria. The Japanese remained after the end of the war, and in 1908, declared the city an open trading port both for the transport of Korean resources and as a stopping point for resources from China. The city was known during this period as “Seishin”, after the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese characters for its name. The Imperial Japanese Army’s 19th Division was headquartered in Ranam from 1918, where the Japanese built a new planned city based on a rectangular street grid. In 1930, Nippon Steel built a large steel mill, the Seishin Iron and Steel Works, in the town. Ranam was annexed to Chongjin in 1940, which was elevated to city status. The Soviet Red Army overran the city after brief resistance on 13 August 1945, only two days before the end of World War II. Under the rule of North Korea, Chongjin remained an important military and industrial centre. It was directly administered by the central government from 1960–1967 and from 1977–1988.

In April 1969, a Lockheed EC-121M Super Constellation of the US Navy (135749) was shot down by two North Korean MiG-17 fighters SE of Chongjin over the Sea of Japan. All 31 occupants were killed, making it the deadliest plane crash in North Korean territory. The plane was on a military flight out of Atsugi NAS.

During the North Korean famine of the 1990s, Chongjin was one of the worst affected locations in the country; death rates may have been as high as 20%. Conditions there remain poor in terms of food availability. This problem has caused several instances of civil unrest in Chongjin, a rarity in North Korea. On 4 March 2008, a crowd of women merchants protested in response to tightened market controls. Rising grain prices and government attempts to prohibit &quot;peddling in the market&quot; have been cited as causes for the protests. As a result of the protest, the Chongjin local government &quot;posted a proclamation allowing peddling in the market.&quot; On 24 August 2008, a clash occurred between foot patrol agents and female merchants, which escalated into a &quot;massive protest rally&quot;. It was reported that the Chongjin local government-issued verbal instructions relaxing the enforcement activity until the time of the next grain ration.

== Administrative divisions ==
From 1948 to 1960, 1967 to 1977, and 1987 to present, Ch&#x27;ŏngjin was governed as a part of North Hamgyong Province. From 1960 until 1967, and again from 1977 to 1987, Chongjin was administered as a directly governed city.

Ch&#x27;ŏngjin is divided into seven wards (구역, &quot;kuyŏk&quot;, ).
* Ch&#x27;ŏngam-guyŏk (청암구역, )
* P&#x27;ohang-guyŏk (포항구역, )
* Puyun-guyŏk (부윤구역, )
* Ranam-guyŏk (라남구역, )
* Sinam-guyŏk (신암구역, )
* Songp&#x27;yŏng-guyŏk (송평구역, )
* Sunam-guyŏk (수남구역, )

== Geography ==
Chongjin is located in the northeast of North Korea, in North Hamgyong Province, near the East Korea Bay (Kyŏngsŏng Bay) in the Sea of Japan. The Susong River (수성천) runs through the city; contained in the city are the Sodu Stream (서두수) and Mount Komal (고말산).

=== Climate ===
Chongjin has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dwa&quot;, bordering on &quot;Dwb&quot;) with cold, dry winters and warm, rainy summers.

== Economy ==
Chongjin is one of the DPRK&#x27;s important steel and fiber industry centers. It has a shipyard, a locomotive plant, and a rubber factory. Near the port area are the Chongjin Steel Co., Chemical Textile Co., May 10 Coal Mine Machinery Factory, and Kimchaek Iron &amp; Steel (which was called Nippon Steel during the Japanese occupation); however industrial activities in the city have been severely handicapped due to a lack of resources. Despite this, however, Chongjin is estimated to have a 24 percent share of the DPRK&#x27;s foreign trade and is home to a resident Chinese consul who serves Chinese merchants and businesspersons operating in the northeast of the country. Chongjin also contains Sunam Market, an example of market economics in North Korea.

Because of the heavy concentration of industries in the area, Chongjin is also the DPRK&#x27;s air pollution black spot. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent shortage of oil to generate electricity, many factories have been shuttered. One of the first senior U.N. officials permitted to visit the area, Tun Myat, observed in 1997 when the North Korea economic crisis reached its peak, &quot;Chongjin was like a forest of scrap metal, with huge plants that seem to go on for miles and miles that have been turned into rust buckets. I&#x27;ve been all over the world, and I&#x27;ve never seen anything quite like this.&quot;

Chongjin Bus Factory, established in 1981, supplies a large number of buses and trolleybuses to Chongjin. It also builds the trams used within Chongjin, including one articulated tram. In recent years, the factory has built more trolleybuses that visually resemble the Chollima-321 of the Trolleybuses in Pyongyang.

The city is powered by the Chongjin Thermal Power Plant. The coal used by the power plant is allegedly mined in Kwan-li-so No.22, although since then the prison has apparently been closed. The plant has an estimated generation capacity of 150 MW.

===Other industries===
* Chosun Clothing Factory – makes Vinalon cloth into uniforms
* North Hamgyong Provincial Broadcasting Company
* Majon Deer Company – makes medicine from deer antlers
* Second Metal Construction Company
* Onpho Hot Springs
* Soenggiryong mines – kaolin mine
* North Hamgyong Provincial E-Business Institute

The area has little arable land, so the famine in the 1990s hit the residents of Chongjin particularly hard. During the late 1990s, the city&#x27;s residents experienced some of the highest death rates from famine, which might have been as high as 20 percent of the population. By 1995, the local frog population was wiped out due to overhunting.

===Prisons===
* In Chongjin political prison camp (Kwan-li-so No. 25), a large prison complex in Susong-dong (northern part of Chongjin), more than 3,000 political prisoners are allegedly forced to manufacture bicycles and other consumer goods.
* Chongori reeducation camp (Kyo-hwa-so No. 12) is located halfway between Chongjin and Hoeryong.
* The Nongpo Detention Center, which was built during the Japanese occupation, is still in use but under new management.

===Shipping===
Chongjin&#x27;s port has established itself as a critical component of busy international shipping trade with neighbouring parts of Northeast and Southeast Asia. Of DPRK&#x27;s eight international shipping ports, Chongjin is thought to be the second most economically important (after Nampho port on the west coast) and serves as a base of trade to Russia and Japan. Chongjin also boasts a seamen&#x27;s club which serves to cater for foreign crews as well as a meeting base for North Koreans and foreigners engaged in the shipping trade.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China and Russia have set up their consulates in Chongjin. It is unique for a North Korean city to have a foreign consulate. Chongjin is the administrative centre of the North Hamgyong Province.

== Transport ==
===Air===
Orang Airport located in Orang County 40 kilometres from Chongjin is equipped with a runway on military and civilian dual purpose air station (CHO). North Korea planned to upgrade an old airport near Hamhung as late as 2003, so that it would have a runway, and would act as the nation&#x27;s second international airport. However, it is still not completed.

===Rail===
The Wonson-Rason Railway and Chongjin-Rason Railway (Pyongra Line) electric railways operated by the Korean State Railway connect Rason and capital Pyongyang.

===Urban transit===

Chongjin is the only city in North Korea other than Pyongyang and Wonsan to operate a tram system. These trams are all locally manufactured. It consists of one line built in two phases, phase 1, and phase 2. It has a turning loop in Pongchon and Namchongjin, with the depot located in Sabong.

A trolleybus system also operates with 3 lines: Chongam - Yokchon, Hae&#x27;an - Sabong and Namchongijn - Ranam.
