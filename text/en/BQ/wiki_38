<text>Jack Hody Johnson (born May 18, 1975) is an American singer-songwriter. His music falls into genres like folk, surf-rock, and various other subgenres.

Johnson&#x27;s musicianship has earned him multiple spots on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, reaching number one on the chart with his albums &quot;Sing-A-Longs and Lullabies for the Film Curious George&quot; in 2006, &quot;Sleep Through the Static&quot; in 2008, &quot;To the Sea&quot; in 2010 and &quot;From Here to Now to You&quot; in 2013. His album &quot;In Between Dreams&quot; peaked at number two on the chart in 2005 and again in 2013.

Johnson is active in environmentalism and sustainability, often with a focus on the world&#x27;s oceans. Johnson and his wife Kim created the Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation and the Kōkua Hawaii Foundation. In 2008, Johnson adopted the concept of greening (reduce and reuse), and donated 100% of the proceeds of the &quot;Sleep Through the Static&quot; tour to the Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation. Similarly, the proceeds from the 2010 &quot;To the Sea&quot; album tour went to All at Once, a Johnson-backed collaboration of greening charities promoting fan involvement.

==Early life and education==
The son of surfer Jeff Johnson, Jack was born and grew up on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii. He began to learn how to surf at the age of 5. At 17, he became the youngest invitee to make the finals of the Pipeline Masters, one of surfing&#x27;s most prestigious events, on Oahu&#x27;s North Shore. One week later, however, his stint as a professional surfer ended when he suffered a surfing accident at the Pipeline. He had to have more than 100 stitches in his forehead and a few of his teeth were removed; later the incident became the inspiration for his song &quot;Drink the Water&quot;. He appeared as a surfer in &quot;The Endless Summer II&quot; in 1994.

Jack Johnson graduated from Kahuku High School on the island of Oahu. He later attended the University of California, Santa Barbara graduating in 1997 with a B.A. degree in film studies. While Johnson learned the guitar at the age of 8 and started songwriting at the age of 12, his passion for music grew when he played rhythm guitar for the band Soil (not to be confused with a heavy metal band of the same name) in college.

In 1994, Zach Gill&#x27;s band, Django Reinhardt, released a CD that quickly made Django a favorite band of the Isla Vista, California party scene at UCSB. Django was the rival of Jack Johnson&#x27;s band Soil, but Gill and Johnson developed a strong friendship, eventually becoming bandmates in later years. While part of Soil at UCSB, Johnson opened for acts such as Sublime and Dave Matthews who were then relatively unknown bands.Johnson credits his songwriting influences as Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Radiohead, Otis Redding, G. Love and Special Sauce, Ben Harper, Sublime, the Beatles, Bob Marley, Neil Young, and A Tribe Called Quest. Johnson names Jimi Hendrix as his all-time favorite guitarist.

==Career==
===2000–2003: &quot;Brushfire Fairytales&quot; and &quot;On and On&quot;===
Jack Johnson&#x27;s big break was writing and contributing vocals for the song &quot;Rodeo Clowns&quot; which was featured on G. Love&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Philadelphonic&quot;. Johnson was introduced to G. Love by a mutual friend who was shooting surf films with him then. After hearing &quot;Rodeo Clowns&quot;, G. Love saw Johnson&#x27;s potential and effortless style and invited him to record with him. That led to the now-famous &quot;Rodeo Clowns&quot; recording, launching Johnson&#x27;s career.

In addition to his later success as a musician, Johnson is an accomplished filmmaker. He directed the surf films &quot;Thicker Than Water&quot; (2000) and &quot;The September Sessions&quot; (2002), in which he also starred. He recorded both movie soundtracks and starred in the 2004 surf film &quot;A Brokedown Melody&quot;.

Suela released a four-track demo that caught the attention of Ben Harper&#x27;s producer, J. P. Plunier, who worked with Johnson to produce his debut album &quot;Brushfire Fairytales&quot; during December 2000 with Harper and his Weissenborn lap steel guitar making a guest appearance. &quot;Brushfire Fairytales&quot; was released on February 1, 2001, and led to Johnson becoming the opening act in late February 2001 for the last twenty-three cities of Harper&#x27;s &quot;Innocent Criminals&quot; tour of the United States.

Johnson as well as Adam Topol (drums, percussion) and Merlo Podlewski (bass), who played on &quot;Brushfire Fairytales&quot; to record his second full-length album &quot;On and On&quot;; Mario Caldato Jr. was the producer. It was the first album to be recorded at Johnson&#x27;s Mango Tree Studio in his hometown of North Shore, Oahu as well as the first to be released through The Moonshine Conspiracy Records. &quot;On and On&quot; was released on May 6, 2003. The Moonshine Conspiracy Records became Brushfire Records; Johnson turned the offices and studios of his Los Angeles based record company into a model of eco-friendliness, with solar power, recyclable CD packaging, and power-saving air conditioners.

===2004–2009: &quot;In Between Dreams&quot;, &quot;Curious George&quot;, and &quot;Sleep Through the Static&quot;===

On April 3, 2004, Johnson and Ben Harper performed with Toots and the Maytals on Saturday Night Live (season 29, episode 16).

In October 2004, Johnson returned to the Mango Tree Studio with Topol and Podlewski along with Zach Gill (of Animal Liberation Orchestra) playing accordion, melodica, and piano recording his follow-up to 2003&#x27;s &quot;On and On&quot;. &quot;In Between Dreams&quot; was released on March 1, 2005. &quot;Sing-A-Longs and Lullabies for the Film Curious George&quot; is a soundtrack album by Johnson, released on February 7, 2006. The album also features Harper, G. Love, Merlo Podlewski and Zach Gill. It was the first soundtrack to be number 1 on the chart since the &quot;Bad Boys II soundtrack&quot; in August 2003; it was the first soundtrack for an animated film to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 since the &quot;Pocahontas soundtrack&quot; in July 1995. Johnson enlisted J.P. Plunier to produce his fourth full-length studio album, &quot;Sleep Through the Static&quot;. It was recorded using 100% solar energy at the Solar-Powered Plastic Plant studio in Los Angeles. The album featured Gill (keys), Podlewski (bass), and Topol (drums, percussion). &quot;Sleep Through the Static&quot; was released on February 1, 2008, followed by a world tour. A live album and DVD of Johnson&#x27;s 2008 world tour titled &quot;En Concert&quot;, was released on October 27, 2009. The DVD was directed by Emmett Malloy. Johnson was the headliner for the Friday night of the 2008 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.

Johnson spearheaded the Kōkua Festivals (2004–2008 and 2010). Often occurring around Earth Day, the six years of festivals supported the Kōkua Hawai&#x27;i Foundation, a charitable organization supporting environmental education in the schools and communities of Hawaii. &quot;Kōkua Festival 2004/2005&quot; was a DVD released by Jack Johnson Music showcasing the early Kōkua Festivals. He participated along with Willie Nelson, Jackson Browne, Dave Matthews, Eddie Vedder, and others in the documentary &quot;Kōkua 2008: 5 Years of Change&quot; (2009). It was produced by Brushfire and Three Foot Giant Productions and shown on Sundance Channel. On April 17, 2012, preceding his 2012 Hawaiian Islands tour, he released the live Kōkua Festival compilation &quot;Best of Kōkua Festival&quot;. He produced Animal Liberation Orchestra&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Man of the World&quot;, which was released on February 9, 2010. The album also features vocals from Johnson.

===2010–2011: &quot;To the Sea&quot;===
On February 1, 2010, Johnson&#x27;s official website announced that his fifth studio album, &quot;To the Sea&quot;, was in the recording process at the Mango Tree Studio, with a planned worldwide release during the first week of June 2010. The website also announced an accompanying European, Australian and New Zealand tour to coincide with the album&#x27;s release on midnight May 31. The first single from &quot;To the Sea&quot; was &quot;You and Your Heart&quot;, released on April 6, 2010.

While speaking with the New Zealand radio station ZM, Johnson said that he constantly aiming to build relationships with local pro-environment, non-profit groups. &quot;We try to raise money for a lot of these groups who are doing positive things in the community. We try to focus mostly on environmental education, just trying to get kids out into nature, supporting local farms... &quot; He embarked on a world tour in 2010 with Paula Fuga, a Hawaiian vocalist and ukulele player, performing at a range of venues across the world including Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the U.S., and Japan. On November 1, 2011, Johnson released a stand-alone single called &quot;In The Morning&quot; featuring Paula Fuga and John Cruz.

===2012: Hawaiian Islands tour===

On February 22, 2012, Johnson with John Cruz and Paula Fuga announced a 7-show acoustic tour of the Hawaiian islands during April. At the Stan Sheriff Center on April 14, 2012, during the &quot;Pillars of Peace Hawai&#x27;i: Building Peace on a Foundation of Aloha&quot;, he performed introductory music before Nobel Peace Laureate Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, gave the speech &quot;Educating the Heart&quot;. &quot;Better Together&quot; was one of several songs Johnson performed.

===2013–2018: Bonnaroo, &quot;From Here to Now to You&quot;, and &quot;All the Light Above It Too&quot;===
Johnson released &quot;From Here to Now to You&quot; with his band on September 17, 2013. On June 15, 2013, they performed as headliners at the 2013 Bonnaroo in Tennessee. He played two acoustic concerts, one at London&#x27;s Tabernacle in Notting Hill and the other at New York City&#x27;s Allen Room at Lincoln Center overlooking Central Park, featuring songs from his upcoming album. The From Here to Now to You Tour ran from March through September 2014.

In February 2017, Johnson announced a U.S. tour beginning in Chicago at the Huntington Bank Pavilion on Northerly Island on June 1 and ending with two Kōkua Hawai&#x27;i Foundation benefit concerts at the Waikiki Shell on August 4 &amp; 5. He revealed plans to release an album in the summer of 2017. Later, he added a September 10 concert for the 2017 Ohana Fest at Doheny State Beach in Dana Point, California. On September 8, 2017, he released his seventh studio album &quot;All the Light Above It Too&quot;, which peaked at number 13 on the Billboard chart&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Artist 100&quot;.&quot; In July 2018, Johnson released his greatest hits album &quot;Jack Johnson: The Essentials&quot; only in Japan.

===2019–present: &quot;This Warm December&quot;, &quot;Global Citizen&quot; and &quot;Meet the Moonlight&quot;===
In late 2019, Johnson released a single &quot;New Axe&quot;, featured on the &quot;This Warm December Vol. 3&quot; album. He did a &quot;Together at Home&quot; Instagram Live stream concert on March 28, 2020. His concert was the third most watched on the Global Citizen YouTube. He also performed at the &quot;One World: Together at Home&quot; special; a live version of &quot;Better Together&quot; was featured on the &quot;One World: Together at Home&quot; album. On May 1, 2020, he was featured on Milky Chance&#x27;s new single &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot;. On September 26, 2020, Johnson performed the opening set at &quot;Farm Aid: On the Road&quot;.

On December 4, 2020, Johnson released a new single titled &quot;The Captain Is Drunk&quot;. On April 16, 2021, he released a song titled &quot;If Ever&quot; with Paula Fuga and Ben Harper. The song appeared on Fuga&#x27;s new album &quot;Rain on Sunday&quot;, which is featured on Johnson&#x27;s record label. On June 24, 2022, Johnson released his eighth studio album, &quot;Meet the Moonlight,&quot; his first full-length record in five years. It was produced by Blake Mills, engineered by Joseph Lorge, and recorded both in Los Angeles (at Sound City Studios and EastWest Studios) and at The Mango Tree (Johnson&#x27;s home studio) in Hawaii. The album&#x27;s lead single is titled &quot;One Step Ahead&quot;.

Coinciding with his new album release, Johnson embarked on the &quot;Meet the Moonlight Tour&quot; with 35 stops at major venues across the United States (including Hawaii) and Canada. He was accompanied by various artists including Grammy Award winner (and personal friend) Ziggy Marley. In November 2021, Johnson toured Australia and New Zealand, his first overseas concerts since 2019.

==Personal life==
Johnson married his college girlfriend, Kim Baker on July 22, 2000; they have two sons and a daughter. The couple lives on the North Shore of the island of Oahu in Hawaii. In an interview with Johnson, Ann Donahue from &quot;Billboard&quot; described Johnson&#x27;s family life by saying &quot;There is often trouble in balancing the life of an artist, environmentalist, and family man, but Johnson seems to have the niche for such a challenge. This time around, he&#x27;s found a pace that agrees with him... bringing his family along so he can spend mornings with them sightseeing.&quot; Jack and Kim declined to talk about or release information about their children.

===Charity===
In 2008, Johnson and his wife Kim created the Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation, a non-profit public charity supporting environmental, art, and music education worldwide. Jack and Kim Johnson also founded the Kokua Hawaii Foundation in 2003. Jack and his family work hard every year at festivals and concerts to raise money for causes they feel are most important.

Jack Johnson recorded a cover of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; for the 2007 benefit album &quot;Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur&quot;, which was also included on the 2009 benefit album &quot;Rhythms del Mundo Classics&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;It is a typically generous move from Johnson, who has used his multi-platinum success to support causes he cares about.&quot; Although the Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation is a non-profit organization that &quot;focuses on environmental, arts and music education&quot;, it has raised more than $750,000 from 2009 to 2010 to give away. Johnson was in Osaka, Japan on his To the Sea 2010 World Tour at the time of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in northern Japan. He was in a hotel with his family when it struck. After postponing the rest of his tour, he donated $50,000 to GlobalGiving&#x27;s Japan Earthquake and Tsunami Relief Fund.

Johnson&#x27;s Ohana Charitable Foundation has supported Little Kids Rock, a national nonprofit that works to restore and revitalize music education in disadvantaged U.S. public schools. Johnson decorated a guitar for Little Kids Rock to auction raising funds for its program. On September 22, 2012, he donated his time to play a few songs at Farm Aid 2012 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Later in 2012, Jack donated $50,000 for Hurricane Sandy relief and added links on his website for others to donate:

<text>The Society of the Friends of the People was an organisation in Great Britain that was focused on advocating for parliamentary reform. It was founded by the Whig Party in 1792.

The Society in England was aristocratic and exclusive, in contrast to the &quot;Friends of the People&quot; in Scotland, who increasingly drew on a wider membership. Members wanted parliamentary representatives to reflect the population of Great Britain, which could be achieved by making voting more accessible, by granting more men the right to vote, and by making it possible for a broader variety of men to take part in the government.

The Society disbanded in the mid 1790s as a result of conservative reaction against radical political movements.

==Background==
===Country-party Ideology===
During the 18th century, civic humanism became an important political consideration in England. Civic humanism stresses the importance of abandoning personal gain for the common good. It called for a political balance in order to prevent corruption. In England, civic humanism gave rise to the Country Party, which advocated for a less corrupt government that would work for the good of the people and not for the attainment of wealth. The idea of country-party ideology and civic humanism led to the formation of many reformist movements called for parliamentary reform in order to more accurately reflect the will of the people.

===Influence of the French Revolution===

The end of the 18th century brought political change throughout Europe. Although the French revolution brought about extreme unrest in France, similar ideas were being discussed in Great Britain. The British radicals believed in the idea of the universal rights of man (life, liberty, and property) and democracy. Conservatives wanted to maintain the monarchy and Parliament the way it was. In 1791, Thomas Paine published Rights of Man, which stated that the French Revolution was bringing good change to the political system of France. He also declared that the people of Great Britain should rebel to establish democracy and universal rights for all men in Britain. This paper fueled the radical ideology in Great Britain at the time. It also increased the tension between radicals and conservatives, leading to political uncertainty in Britain.

===Corruption in Parliament===
In 1780, about 3% of the population of England had the right to elect members of Parliament&#x27;s House of Commons. Some of the largest cities were completely unrepresented and more than half of the rotten boroughs were so small as to attract widespread vote buying.

==Friends of the People in England==
On 11 April 1792, a group of reformist Whigs started the Society of the Friends of the People, a group dedicated to parliamentary reform. To gain membership, a prospective member must be proposed by two current members and approved by 90% of the members. Members paid dues of two and a half guineas per year, unless they joined with the intent to start a similar organisation elsewhere, in which case they paid only one. The group met on the first Friday of each month. Notable members and supporters include Reverend Christopher Wyvill, Sir Philip Francis, and George Tierney.

===Beliefs and Publications===
The Society wanted to extend the right of freedom of election to a larger group of men. They also wanted more equal representation in the House of Commons, and they wanted to shorten the maximum interval allowed by law between any two successive elections of members of the House of Commons In 1794, Sir Philip Francis stated in a meeting that the society should support extending the right to vote in elections of the House of Commons to any male adult who was not a convicted criminal or &quot;lunatic&quot;.

====Address to the People of Great Britain====
The Address to the People of Great Britain was written in 1792 by Reverend Christopher Wyvill. The Society feared being potentially linked to radical political movements like those in France or to radical English groups like the London Corresponding Society and the Society for Constitutional Information. As a result, this address denied any association with the political reforms happening in France. They felt that the French reformists were trying to create a new type of government, while the Society was trying to make the current English government the way it was supposed to be. They also stated that their methods were reasonable and moderate in comparison. While the French had found hope in the government and resorted to violence as a means of bringing change, the Society was focused more on moderate reform through intellectual communication.

====The Report on the State of Representation====

The State of the Representation of England and Wales was delivered to the Society on 9 February 1793. This pointed out the unfair manner in which Parliament representatives were chosen and conducted business, and it called for change of these issues. They found that members of parliament were chosen by a minuscule portion of the population, meaning they were not truly representatives for the entire people of England. The number of members were also not assigned to counties in a way that represented the population of England. They found that the right to vote was also limited to a small population, property owning men of a certain income who met religious and other requirements. The Society felt some restrictions should be lifted, allowing the voting population to be more reflective of the actual population. Similarly, they thought that the elections were held in a manner that inconvenienced many people, making it hard for some to vote. Voters often had to travel a great distance to be able to vote, which further dwindles the number of people voting. Also, although candidates theoretically only needed 300 pounds a year to qualify, the operation was set up in such a way to prevent anyone who did not own thousands of pounds from being a candidate. They also found that although Parliament was supposed to last no longer than three years, Parliament itself decided that in 1715, they could hold their seats for seven. The society felt that this duration should return to three, as laid down by law. The Society wanted all of these grievances to spark reform in the way Parliament was elected and operated. The report was given by George Tierney, and would later be used by groups looking for evidence proving the corruption of Parliament. 

===Whig Party Influence===
The membership included 3 Whig Peers and 28 Whig Members of Parliaments, one being Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Charles James Fox was not a member, and it is argued that the society excluded him to separate themselves from the Whig party, with their only goal being the elimination of corrupt election practices. Fox stated that he did not wish to discourage the enthusiasts pressing for &quot;more equal representation of the people in Parliament&quot; and voted for Grey&#x27;s motion in Parliament which was defeated by 284 votes to 41 in May 1793.

The Friends of the People caused divisions inside the Whigs. On 4 June 1792 John Cartwright (a Friends of the People member) made a speech praising Thomas Paine&#x27;s book, &quot;The Rights of Man&quot;. Four Whig MPs resigned from the Whig group in parliament.

===Disbandment of the society===
====William Pitt&#x27;s Reign of Terror====
The Revolution in France sparked fear in the leaders of other European countries. They saw reformists and radicals as having the potential to completely overturn the government and destroy the nation. As a result, William Pitt, the British Prime Minister at the time, wanted to destroy reform in England to avoid an uprising like the French revolution. Instead of using violence to combat reform, he used legislation. He suspended the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act 1794. He passed the Seditious Meetings Act 1795 and the Treason Act 1795; combined, these prevented any meetings that were &quot;seditious and unlawful&quot; and required that a magistrate be notified if a meeting were to occur that included 50 or more people. The Newspaper Publication Act 1798 required that all printing presses be registered in order to prevent the publication of material that criticised the government.
====Spy Infiltration====
The Report on Radical and Reform Societies from 1794 was a document stating that the London Corresponding Society and the Society for Constitutional Information were guilty of threatening the constitution of Great Britain through activities and publications that were consistent with radical reformist ideologies. This was discovered because of the infiltration of conservative spies in the societies, which led to the arrests of the leaders.

During this time, the British Government feared the threat of spies in the country. And so, the government created the Aliens Act 1793, which regulated the number of immigrants who could move into Britain.

====Disbandment====
Although the Society was still advocating for parliamentary reform in 1794 after the arrests of leaders of similar societies, they disbanded some time after that as a result of the 1795 Acts.

===Criticism===
Compared to radical groups of the time, the Society was quite moderate. In fact, they were so scared to be associated with the radical movements of the time that they rarely said anything specific at all. Instead of calling for drastic reform, they focused on listing grievances. As a result, their intentions seemed ambiguous. Francis himself stated that the Society delayed in making it clear what its intentions and feelings were about reform.

===Reform Act 1832===
Forty years after the Society of the Friends of the People was formed, the Reform Act 1832 helped establish the parliamentary reform that the Society had called for. It removed representation from 56 rotten boroughs and lowered representation in areas with lower population from two to one. It also created 67 new boroughs so areas with larger populations had representation in Parliament. It also allowed a wider range of men to vote by loosening the property and tax qualifications to the right to vote.

==Friends of the People in Scotland==
In Scotland &quot;The Friends of the People&quot; Society in Edinburgh was founded in July 1792 with lower subscription rates than the English Society, attracting a wider membership which made it more like the London Corresponding Society. It soon had imitators in towns and villages throughout Scotland.

The rank and file were usually described as &quot;shopkeepers and artisans&quot;, and included most prominently weavers as well as tailors, cobblers, brewers, bakers, tanners, butchers and hairdressers. The membership generally did not include general labourers, agricultural workers, colliers, spinners, foundrymen, masons and the like. The government feared such wider support and outbreaks of rioting in many places in the summer and autumn of 1792 were officially attributed to &quot;an almost universal spirit of reform and opposition to the established government and legal administrators which has wonderfully diffused through the manufacturing towns&quot;, but most of the riots were due to other grievances such as an unpopular turnpike, the Corn laws and the Enclosures. Radical demonstrations were evident, not just in the larger towns such as Perth and Dundee but also in smaller towns such as Auchtermuchty, at each of which a &quot;Tree of Liberty&quot; was erected and there were cries of &quot;Liberty and Equality&quot;, but the &quot;Friends of the People&quot; unhesitatingly condemned these disturbances and threatened to expel from their membership anyone joining the rioters.

Between December 1792 and October 1793 held three &quot;general conventions&quot; of the Societies, the last being open to English delegates. Each convention and its aftermath increasingly frightened the upper middle classes away from the reform movement.

The first convention in December 1792 was well patronised by some of the Edinburgh Advocates, by Lord Daer and by Lieutenant Colonel Dalrymple of Fordell, and given literary backing by the Member of Parliament for Inverness, Colonel Macleod. The effective leader at the radical faction at this convention was the eloquent Glasgow lawyer Thomas Muir who was subsequently sentenced by Lord Braxfield to fourteen years&#x27; transportation to the convict settlement at Botany Bay, Australia. In the second convention a similar rôle was played by the Unitarian minister Thomas Fyshe Palmer from Dundee who suffered a similar fate. The third convention was totally deserted by the lawyers, attended by Lord Daer for a few days only, and publicly renounced by Colonel Macleod.

The third &quot;general convention&quot; in October 1793 was held in Edinburgh and called a &quot;British Convention&quot;, with delegates from some of the English &quot;corresponding societies&quot; attending. The leaders of the convention were Joseph Gerrald and Maurice Margarot, representatives from the London Corresponding Society. The convention issued a manifesto demanding universal male suffrage with annual elections and expressing their support for the principles of the French Revolution. The convention was then broken up by the authorities and a number of men were arrested and tried for sedition, with Gerrald and Margarot being sentenced to fourteen years&#x27; transportation along with Muir.

<text>Xul Solar was the adopted name of Oscar Agustín Alejandro Schulz Solari (14 December 1887 – 9 April 1963), an Argentine painter, sculptor, writer, and inventor of imaginary languages.

==Biography==
Oscar Agustín Alejandro Schulz Solari was born in San Fernando, Buenos Aires Province, to a cosmopolitan family. His father, Elmo Schulz Riga, of Baltic German origin, was born in the Latvian city of Riga, at that time part of Imperial Russia. His mother, originally from Italy, was named Agustina Solari. He was educated in Buenos Aires, first as a musician, then as an architect (although he never completed his architectural studies). After working as a schoolteacher and holding a series of minor jobs in the municipal bureaucracy, on 5 April 1912, he set out on the ship &quot;England Carrier&quot;, supposedly to work his passage to Hong Kong, but he disembarked in London and made his way to Turin. He returned to London to meet up with his mother and aunt, with whom he traveled to Paris, Turin (again), Genoa, and his mother&#x27;s native Zoagli. Over the following few years, despite the onset of World War I, he would move among these cities, as well as Tours, Marseille, and Florence; towards the end of the war he served at the Argentine consulate in Milan.

During the years of the war, he struck up what was to be a lifelong friendship with Argentine artist Emilio Pettoruti, then a young man living in Italy and associated with the futurists. Also around that time, he began to pay more attention to painting, first with watercolor (which would always remain his main medium as a painter), although he gradually began working in tempera and – very occasionally — oils. He also adopted the pen name of Xul Solar. The first major exhibition of his art was in 1920 in Milan, together with sculptor Arturo Martini.

In 1916, Schulz Solari first signed his work &quot;Xul Solar&quot;, ostensibly for the purposes to simplify the phonetics of his name, but an examination of the adopted name reveals that the first name is the reverse of &quot;lux,&quot; which means &quot;light&quot; in Latin. Combined with &quot;solar&quot;, the name reads as &quot;the light of the sun&quot;, and demonstrates the artist&#x27;s affinity for the universal source of light and energy. His father&#x27;s name &quot;Schulz&quot; and &quot;Xul&quot; are pronounced the same in Spanish.
During the years that followed he continued his travels, extending his orbit to Munich and Hamburg. In 1924, his work was exhibited in Paris in a show of Latin American artists. He also struck up an acquaintance with British occultist Aleister Crowley and his mistress Leah Hirsig who held high hopes for his discipleship, but later that year he returned to Buenos Aires, where he promptly became associated with the &quot;avant garde&quot; &quot;Florida group&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Martín Fierro group&quot;), a circle that also included Jorge Luis Borges, with whom he was to keep an association and close friendship. It was in this group that he also met poet and novelist Leopoldo Marechal who would immortalize him as the astrologer Schultze in his famous novel &quot;Adam Buenosayres&quot;. He began to exhibit frequently in the galleries of Buenos Aires, notably in a 1926 exhibition of modern painters that included Norah Borges (sister of Jorge Luis Borges) and Emilio Pettoruti. Throughout the rest of his life, he exhibited regularly in Buenos Aires and Montevideo, Uruguay, but he would not have another major European exhibition until his twilight years. In 1962, a year before his death, he had a major exposition at the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne in Paris. He died at his house in Tigre on 9 April 1963. Pettoruti published his biography five years later.

==Work and interests==
Solar&#x27;s paintings are mainly sculptures, often using striking contrasts and bright colours, typically in relatively small formats. His visual style seems equidistant between Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee on the one hand and Marc Chagall on the other. He also worked in some extremely unorthodox artistic media, such as modifying pianos, including a version with three rows of keys.

The poet Fernando Demaría in an essay &quot;Xul Solar y Paul Klee&quot; (published in the Argentine magazine &quot;Lyra&quot;, 1971), wrote, &quot;It is not easy for the human spirit to elevate itself from astrology to astronomy, but we would be making a mistake if we forget that an authentic astrologer, like Xul Solar, is close to the source of the stars... The primitivism of Xul Solar is anterior to the appearance of the Gods. The Gods correspond to a more evolved form of energy.&quot;

Solar had a strong interest in astrology; at least as early as 1939 he began to draw astrological charts. He also had an interest in Buddhism and believed strongly in reincarnation. He also developed his own set of tarot cards. His paintings reflect his religious beliefs, featuring objects such as stairs, roads and the representation of God.

He invented two fully elaborated imaginary languages, symbols from which figure in his paintings, and was also an exponent of duodecimal mathematics. He said of himself &quot;I am maestro of a writing no one reads yet.&quot; One of his invented languages was called &quot;Neo Criollo&quot;, a poetic fusion of Portuguese and Spanish, which he reportedly would frequently use as a spoken language in talking to people. He also invented a &quot;Pan Lingua&quot;, which aspired to be a world language linking mathematics, music, astrology and the visual arts, an idea reminiscent of Hermann Hesse&#x27;s &quot;glass bead game&quot;. Indeed, games were a particular interest of his, including his own invented version of chess, or more precisely &quot;&quot;non-chess&quot;.&quot;

Outside of Argentina, Solar may best be known for his association with Borges. In 1940, he figured as a minor character in Borges&#x27;s semi-fictional &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot;; in 1944, he illustrated a limited edition (300 copies) of &quot;Un modelo para la muerte&quot;, written by Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares, writing together under the pseudonym B. Suárez Lynch. He and Borges had common interests in German expressionistic poetry, the works of Emanuel Swedenborg, Algernon Charles Swinburne and William Blake, and Eastern philosophy, especially Buddhism and the &quot;I Ching&quot;.

==Discussion of &quot;Entierro&quot; and &quot;Fiordo&quot;==

===&quot;Entierro&quot;, 1914, watercolor on paper===

After a brief experimentation with oils, Xul chose the watercolors and tempera that would become his preferred media. Instead of large-scale canvases, Xul painted on small sheets of paper, sometimes mounting his finished works on sheets of cardboard. One of his early works in what would become his signature format, &quot;Entierro&quot; (&quot;Burial&quot;) demonstrates the confluence of Xul&#x27;s internal thoughts and external influences.

The image is of a funeral procession of beings, possibly celestial, led by an angel-figure floating above the ground. The profiles of the figures suggest Pre-Columbian art, and possibly an ancient Egyptian influence, as well. The angel-figure as well as the mourners have luminous peaks above their heads, in a re-imagining of halos. The shapes of the peaks are repeated by tongues of fire that point up from the bottom edge of the painting. The image strongly suggests an afterworld, but it is not clear from the image whether the environment correlates to tradition Christian understandings of heaven or hell. Xul Solar provides his viewer with a new image of an afterlife.

Two figures hold a shrouded corpse, which is also surrounded by flames. The hands of the corpse are folded, but above the corpse, a figure resembling a fetus emerges. That Xul uses a fetus instead of an image of a deceased person of typical age leads one to read the image as a depiction of reincarnation, representing a break from traditional Catholic ideas of life and death, and demonstrating the investigation into disparate spiritualities which would continue for the rest of Xul&#x27;s life. As the figures recede in the painting, Xul reduces them to geometric shapes. The forms cease to be recognizable as beings, and then are transformed into what can be a tomb, or portal. That all the mourners are of the same color as the temple indicates that they, just like the deceased, will make the same transition someday.

Xul Solar&#x27;s life during his twenties was marked by profound existential crisis. His writings at the time reveal a profound desire for creative expression, and a kind of angst caused by the profusion of ideas and thoughts he entertained, 
&quot;Dazzling light, colors never seen, harmonies of ecstasies and of hell, unheard-of sounds, a new beauty that is mine… If my damaging sorrows are due to labor in childbirth, I am pregnant with an immense, new world!&quot;
Author Mario H. Gradowczyk describes Xul at this point in his life as &quot;a visionary rabidly opposed to the canons reigning in the Buenos Aires of his time&quot;. Like other artistically inclined people of his generation, Xul sought to study in Europe, and settled for a time in Paris while it was an epicenter for avant-garde art. The city was home to the Cubists, while attracting Italian futurists, Russian artists, and participating in the dialogue about German Expressionism. There was also a fashion for sculpture and objects brought back to Europe by anthropologists and traders from African and Pacific Ocean colonies, as well as the Americas.

The artistic canons that Gradowczyk refers to were propagated by the official Argentine art institutions, which favored visual representations associated with national icons. Painters like Carlos P. Ripamonte, Cesáreo Bernaldo de Quirós, and Fernando Fader extolled images of pampas landscapes and rural gaucho culture. The arrival of Spanish intellectuals such as José Ortega y Gasset and Eugenio d&#x27;Ors created a new discourse around art that was disseminated among writers and artists working toward an aesthetic modernity. Entierros firmly places Xul Solar as a member of this modernist Argentine movement. Rather than painting subjects recognizable as Argentine, Xul&#x27;s focus is internal, painting from his own imagination. His early artistic output seems to represent the profusion of ideas and themes that grew out of Xul&#x27;s contemplations. The flat shapes and bold colors used in the painting demonstrate a Cubist influence. The faces of the figures, particularly the eyes and shapes of heads can be seen as owing to the fashion for art and artifacts from Africa and the Americas mentioned above.

===&quot;Fiordo&quot;, 1943, tempera on paper mounted on board===

The severe, bleak, landscape in &quot;Fiordo&quot; suggests ancient Chinese and Japanese prints. Narrow mountains with undulating edges stab up from placid water. Here, Xul communicates his affinity with Asian forms and, in turn, ideas. The ladders that criss-cross the mountains, are described by Gradowczyk as symbolizing spirituality, both of the ascendant nature as well as with the possibility of descent. The single figure in the bottom corner suggests a hermetic existence, a difficult spiritual path that is mirrored in the steep staircases. The figure holds a book in one hand and what appears to be a lantern in the other, representing study and guidance. Xul tells his viewer that while spiritual pursuit can be arduous, others have established a path, and they point the way. A structure appears atop one mountain, ostensibly a temple. None of the ladders lead directly to the mountain peak, however. The path twists and turns, and the doors cut into the mountainsides represent the stages, and possible moments of being waylaid, as one endeavors spiritually.

From 1943 and 1944, Xul&#x27;s painting was influenced by his thoughts on the Second World War. The sudden, powerful emergence of inhumanity and the potential effects on the world at large wore very heavily on the artist. Gradowczyk posits that &quot;Xul reached his highest point of artistic expressivity in these ascetic paintings whose theme corresponded to that anguishing reality&quot;.

==Legacy==

In 1939, Xul initiated a project to establish a &quot;universal club,&quot; which he called &quot;Pan Klub&quot; in Neocriollo. His purpose was to create a type of salon for intellectuals and those of mutual interests, and inaugurated the club at his home. Nearly fifty years later, his widow, Micaela (Lita) Cadenas established the Fundación Pan Klub, based on the original precepts set by Xul during his lifetime. This foundation established the Museo Xul Solar in 1993, in a building whose design was based on Xul&#x27;s work. The museum exhibits works that Xul selected for the Pan Klub, as well as houses objects, sculptures, and the documents compiling his personal archive. The foundation also preserves Xul&#x27;s home, where his extensive library is located.

From 1980 to 1996, an Argentine literary magazine named &quot;Xul&quot; was published. In the essay that accompanied the publication of its anthology, several reasons are given for why the magazine was named as such. The last paragraph of the essay begins, &quot;What should have been first remains for the last: XUL, the name of the magazine, was an homage to Xul Solar, a singularly complex individual, writer among many other things, although he was known mainly as one of the principal plastic artists of Argentina.&quot;

==Quotes==

&quot;I am a world champion of a game that nobody yet knows called panchess (&quot;Panajedrez&quot;). I am master of a script that nobody yet reads. I am creator of a technique, of a musical grafía that allows the piano to be studied in a third of the usual time that it takes today. I am director of a theatre that as yet has not begun working. I am creator of a universal language called panlingua based on numbers and astrology that will help people know each other better. I am creator of twelve painting techniques, some of them surrealist, and others that transpose a sensory, emotional world on to canvas, and that will produce in those that listen a Chopin suite, a Wagnerian prelude, or a stanza sung by Beniamino Gigli. I am the creator, and this is what most interests me at the moment, apart from the exhibition of painting that I am preparing, of a language that is desperately needed by Latin America.&quot;

-From Xul Solar&#x27;s own writings

&quot;Although this is a time when art is more individual and arbitrary than ever, it would be a mistake to call it anarchic. In spite of so much confusion, there exists a well-defined tendency toward simplicity of means, toward clear and solid architecture, toward the pure plastic sense that protects and accents abstract meanings of line, mass, and color, all within a complete liberty of subject and composition…

Let us admit, in any case, that among us now – if mostly still hidden – are many or all of the seeds of our future art, and not in museums overseas, and not in the homes of famous foreign dealers. Let us honor the rare ones, our rebellious spirits who, like this artist, before denying others, find affirmation in themselves; that instead of destroying, seek to build. Let us honor those who struggle so that the soul of our country can be more beautiful.

Because the wars of independence for our America are not yet over…&quot;

<text>Friends of the People is an American sketch comedy television series. It was slated to premiere on TruTV in summer 2014, but was pushed to October 28, 2014, as part of the network&#x27;s shift in their programming direction. Many of the cast members (Jennifer Bartels, Jermaine Fowler, and Lil Rel Howery) were originally reported to be cast members of a planned revival of &quot;In Living Color&quot; which never materialized. The show&#x27;s first season consisted of 10 episodes. This made it the network&#x27;s first sketch comedy show. The series held a TV-14 rating, though select episodes were rated TV-MA — also a first for the truTV network.

<text>Hans Fallada (; born Rudolf Wilhelm Friedrich Ditzen; 21 July 18935 February 1947) was a German writer of the first half of the 20th century. Some of his better known novels include &quot;Little Man, What Now?&quot; (1932) and &quot;Every Man Dies Alone&quot; (1947). His works belong predominantly to the New Objectivity literary style, a style associated with an emotionless reportage approach, with precision of detail, and a veneration for &#x27;the fact&#x27;. Fallada&#x27;s pseudonym derives from a combination of characters found in the Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tales: The titular protagonist of &quot;Hans in Luck&quot; (KHM 83), and Fallada the magical talking horse in &quot;The Goose Girl&quot;.

==Early life==
Fallada was born in Greifswald, Germany, the child of a magistrate on his way to becoming a supreme court judge and a mother from a middle-class background, both of whom shared an enthusiasm for music, and to a lesser extent, literature. Jenny Williams notes in her biography &quot;More Lives than One&quot; (1998), that Fallada&#x27;s father would often read aloud to his children works by authors such as Shakespeare and Schiller.

In 1899, when Fallada was 6, his father relocated the family to Berlin following the first of several promotions he would receive. Fallada had a very difficult time upon first entering school in 1901. As a result, he immersed himself in books, eschewing literature more in line with his age for authors such as Flaubert, Dostoevsky, and Dickens. In 1909 the family again relocated, to Leipzig, following his father&#x27;s appointment to the Imperial Supreme Court.

In 1909 (age 16), he was run over by a horse-drawn cart, then kicked in the face by the horse. This mishap plus the contraction of typhoid in 1910 (age 17) seem to mark a turning point in Fallada&#x27;s life. His lifelong drug problems were born of the pain-killing medications he was taking as the result of his injuries. These issues manifested themselves in multiple suicide attempts.

In 1911 he made a pact with a friend, Hanns Dietrich von Necker, to stage a duel to mask their suicides, feeling that the duel would be seen as more honorable. However, because of both boys&#x27; inexperience with weapons, it was a bungled affair. Dietrich missed Fallada, but Fallada did not miss Dietrich, killing him. Fallada was so distraught that he picked up Dietrich&#x27;s gun and shot himself in the chest, but somehow survived. Nonetheless, the death of his friend ensured his status as an outcast from society.

Although he was found innocent of murder by reason of insanity, from this point on he would undergo multiple stints in mental institutions. At one of these institutions, he was assigned to work in a farmyard, thus beginning his lifelong affinity for farm culture.

==Writing career and encounters with National Socialism==
While in a sanatorium Fallada took to translation and poetry, albeit unsuccessfully, before finally breaking ground as a novelist in 1920 with the publication of his first book &quot;Der junge Goedeschal&quot; (&quot;Young Goedeschal&quot;). During this period he also struggled with morphine addiction, and the death of his younger brother in the First World War.

In the wake of the war, Fallada worked at several farmhand and other agricultural jobs in order to support himself and finance his growing drug addiction. While before the war Fallada relied on his father for financial support while writing, after the German defeat he was no longer able, or willing, to depend on his father&#x27;s assistance. Shortly after the publication of &quot;Anton und Gerda&quot; Fallada reported to prison in Greifswald to serve a 6-month sentence for stealing grain from his employer and selling it to support his drug habit. Less than 3 years later, in 1926, Fallada again found himself imprisoned as a result of a drug and alcohol-fueled string of thefts from employers. In February 1928 he finally emerged free of addiction.

Fallada married Anna &quot;Suse&quot; Issel in 1929 and maintained a string of respectable jobs in journalism, working for newspapers and eventually for the publisher of his novels, Rowohlt. It is around this time that his novels became noticeably political and started to comment on the social and economic woes of Germany. His breakthrough success came in 1930/1931 with &quot;A Small Circus&quot; (German: &quot;Bauern, Bonzen und Bomben&quot;; &quot;Peasants, Bosses and Bombs&quot;) based on the history of the Rural People&#x27;s Movement in Schleswig-Holstein and the farmers&#x27; protest and boycott of the town of Neumünster. Williams notes that Fallada&#x27;s 1930/31 novel &quot;..established [him] as a promising literary talent as well as an author not afraid to tackle controversial issues&quot;. Martin Seymour-Smith said it is one of his best novels, &quot;it remains one of the most vivid and sympathetic accounts of a local revolt ever written.&quot;

The great success of &quot;Kleiner Mann - was nun?&quot; (&quot;Little Man, What Now?&quot;) in 1932, while immediately easing his financial straits, was overshadowed by his anxiety over the rise of national socialism and a subsequent nervous breakdown. Although none of his work was deemed subversive enough to warrant action by the Nazis, many of his peers were arrested and interned, and his future as an author under the Nazi regime looked bleak. A German film of the book was made by Jewish producers at the end of 1932, and this earned Fallada closer attention by the rising Nazi Party. The film, unlike the US film of 1934, bore little resemblance to the novel, and was finally released after many cuts by the Nazi censors in mid-1933.

These anxieties were compounded by the loss of a baby only a few hours after childbirth. However he was heartened by the great success of &quot;Little Man, What Now?&quot; in Great Britain and the United States, where the book was a bestseller. In the U.S., it was selected by the Book of the Month Club, and was even made into a Hollywood movie, &quot;Little Man, What Now?&quot; (1934).

Meanwhile, as the careers, and in some cases the lives, of many of Fallada&#x27;s contemporaries were rapidly drawing to a halt, he began to draw some additional scrutiny from the government in the form of denunciations of his work by Nazi authors and publications, who also noted that he had not joined the Party. On Easter Sunday, 1933, he was jailed by the Gestapo for &quot;anti-Nazi activities&quot; after one such denunciation, but despite a ransacking of his home no evidence was found and he was released a week later.

After Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in 1933, Fallada had to make a few changes to the novel that removed anything that showed the Nazis in a bad light: a &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) thug had to be turned into a soccer thug, for example, and the book stayed in print until 1941, after which war time paper shortages curtailed the printing of novels.

In 2016, a complete edition was published in Germany that added about 100 pages to the original 400 pages in the 1932 edition. The cuts had been made with Fallada&#x27;s consent by his publisher Ernst Rowohlt. German reviewers agreed that the tone and the structure of the novel had not suffered from the cuts, but that the restored sections added &#x27;colour and atmosphere,&#x27; such as a dream-like Robinson Crusoe island fantasy taking the main character away from his drab everyday life, a visit to the cinema to see a Charles Chaplin movie, and an evening at the &quot;Tanzpalast&quot; (Dance Palace).

Although his 1934 novel &quot;Wir hatten mal ein Kind&quot; (&quot;Once We Had a Child&quot;) met with initially positive reviews, the official Nazi publication &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; disapproved. In the same year, the Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda &quot;recommended the removal of &quot;Little Man, What Now?&quot; from all public libraries&quot;. Meanwhile, the official campaign against Fallada was beginning to take a toll on the sales of his books, landing him in financial straits that precipitated another nervous breakdown in 1934.

In September 1935 Fallada was officially declared an &quot;undesirable author&quot;, a designation that banned his work from being translated and published abroad. His novel &quot;Old Heart Goes A-Journeying&quot; caused him problems with the Reich Literary Chamber because it had Christianity instead of Nazism as the unifier of the people. Although this order was repealed a few months later, it was at this point that his writing shifted from an artistic endeavor to merely a much needed source of income, writing &quot;children&#x27;s stories and harmless fairy tales&quot; that would also conveniently avoid the unwanted attention of the Nazis. During this time the prospect of emigration held a constant place in Fallada&#x27;s mind, although he was reluctant because of his love of Germany.

In 1937 the publication and success of &quot;Wolf unter Wölfen&quot; (&quot;Wolf Among Wolves&quot;) marked Fallada&#x27;s temporary return to his serious, realistic style. The Nazis read the book as a sharp criticism of the Weimar Republic, and thus naturally approved. Notably, Joseph Goebbels called it &quot;a super book&quot;. Goebbels&#x27;s interest in Fallada&#x27;s work would lead the writer to a world of worry: he would subsequently suggest the writer compose an anti-Semitic tract, and his praise indirectly resulted in Fallada&#x27;s commission to write a novel that would be the basis for a state-sponsored film charting the life of a German family up to 1933.

The book &quot;Der eiserne Gustav&quot; (&quot;Iron Gustav&quot;) was a look at the deprivations and hardships brought on by World War I, but upon reviewing the manuscript Goebbels would suggest that Fallada stretch the time-line of the story to include the rise of the Nazis and their depiction as solving the problems of the War and Weimar. Fallada wrote several different versions before eventually capitulating under the pressure of both Goebbels and his depleted finances. Other evidence of his surrender to Nazi intimidation came in the form of forewords he subsequently wrote for two of his more politically ambiguous works, brief passages in which he essentially declared that the events in his books took place before the rise of the Nazis and were clearly &quot;designed to placate the Nazi authorities&quot;. 
By the end of 1938, despite the deaths of several colleagues at the hands of the Nazis, Fallada finally reversed his decision to emigrate. His British publisher, George Putnam, had made arrangements and sent a private boat to whisk Fallada and his family out of Germany. According to Jenny Williams, Fallada had actually packed his bags and loaded them into the car when he told his wife he wanted to take one more walk around their smallholding. &quot;When he returned some time later,&quot; Williams writes, &quot;he declared that he could not leave Germany and that Suse should unpack.&quot;

This seemingly abrupt change of plans coincided with an inner conviction that Fallada had long harbored. Years earlier he had confided to an acquaintance that: “I could never write in another language, nor live in any other place than Germany.”

==World War II==
Fallada once again dedicated himself to writing children&#x27;s stories and other non-political material suitable for the sensitive times. Nevertheless, with the German invasion of Poland in 1939 and the subsequent outbreak of World War II, life became still more difficult for Fallada and his family. War rations were the basis for several squabbles between his family and other members of his village. On multiple occasions neighbors reported his supposed drug addiction to authorities, threatening to reveal his history of psychological disturbances, a dangerous record indeed under the Nazi regime.

The rationing of paper, which prioritized state-promoted works, was also an impediment to his career. Nevertheless, he continued to publish in a limited role, even enjoying a very brief window of official approval. This window closed abruptly near the end of 1943 with the loss of his 25-year publisher Rowohlt, who fled the country. It was also at this time that he turned to alcohol and extra-marital affairs to cope with, among other matters, the increasingly strained relationship with his wife. Furthermore, in 1943 he travelled to France and the Reichsgau Sudetenland as Sonderführer (B) by order of the so-called &quot;Reichsarbeitsdienst&quot;.

In 1944, although their divorce was already finalized, a drunk Fallada and his wife were involved in an altercation in which a shot was fired by Fallada, according to Suse Ditzen in an interview she gave late in her life to biographer Jenny Williams. According to Suse Ditzen, she took the gun from her husband and hit him over the head with it before calling the police, who confined him to a psychiatric institution. (The police record of the call to the altercation makes no mention of shots being fired.) Throughout this period Fallada had one hope to cling to: the project he had concocted to put off Goebbels&#x27;s demands that he write an anti-Semitic novel.

It involved the novelization of &quot;a famous fraud case involving two Jewish financiers in the nineteen twenties&quot; which, because of its potential as propaganda, was supported by the government and had eased pressure on him as he worked on other, more sincere projects. Finding himself incarcerated in a Nazi insane asylum, he used this project as a pretext for obtaining paper and writing materials, saying he had an assignment to fulfill for Goebbels&#x27;s office. This successfully forestalled more harsh treatment: the insane were regularly subjected to barbarous treatment by the Nazis, including physical abuse, sterilization, and even death. But rather than writing the anti-Jewish novel, Fallada used his allotment of paper to write — in a dense, overlapping script that served to encode the text — the novel &quot;The Drinker&quot; (&quot;Der Trinker&quot;), a deeply critical autobiographical account of life under the Nazis, and a short diary &quot;In meinem fremden Land&quot; (&quot;A Stranger in My Own Country&quot;). It was an act easily punishable by death, but he was not caught, and was released in December 1944 as the Nazi government began to crumble.

==Postwar life==

Despite a seemingly successful reconciliation with his first wife, only a few months after his release he went on to marry the young, wealthy and attractive Ursula Losch, widow of the artist Kurt Losch, and moved in with her in Feldberg, Mecklenburg. Shortly after, the Soviets invaded the area. Fallada, as a celebrity, was asked to give a speech at a ceremony to celebrate the end of the war. Following this speech, he was appointed interim mayor of Feldberg for 18 months.

The time in the mental institution had taken a toll on Fallada, and, deeply depressed by the seemingly impossible task of eradicating the vestiges of fascism that were now so deeply ingrained in society by the Nazi regime, he once again turned to morphine with his wife, and both soon ended up in hospital. He spent the brief remainder of his life in and out of hospitals and wards. Losch&#x27;s addiction to morphine appears to have been even worse than Fallada&#x27;s, and her constantly mounting debts were an additional source of concern. Fallada wrote &quot;Jeder stirbt für sich allein&quot; (&quot;Every Man Dies Alone&quot;) between September and November 1946 (shortly before his death), whilst in a mental institution. He told his family that he had written &quot;a great novel&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
At the time of Fallada&#x27;s death in February 1947, aged 53, from a weakened heart from years of addiction to morphine, alcohol and other drugs, he had recently completed &quot;Every Man Dies Alone&quot;, an anti-fascist novel based on the true story of a German couple, Otto and Elise Hampel, who were executed for producing and distributing anti-Nazi material in Berlin during the war. According to Jenny Williams, he wrote the book in a &quot;white heat&quot;—a mere 24 days. Fallada died just weeks before the publication of this final novel. He was buried in Pankow, a borough of Berlin, but was later moved to Carwitz where he had lived from 1933 till 1944. After Fallada&#x27;s death, because of possible neglect and continuing addiction on the part of his second wife and sole heir, many of his unpublished works were lost or sold.

Fallada remained a popular writer in Germany after his death. But, although &quot;Little Man, What Now?&quot; had been a great success in the United States and the UK, outside of Germany Fallada faded into obscurity for decades. In Germany, &quot;Every Man Dies Alone&quot; made a great impact. It was filmed for television in both East and West Germany. The novel was brought to the cinema screen in 1976, starring Hildegard Knef and Carl Raddatz. &quot;Every Man Dies Alone&quot; remained untranslated in English until 2009, when it was rediscovered by American publishing house Melville House Publishing and released in the US under the title &quot;Every Man Dies Alone&quot;, in a translation by Michael Hofmann. Melville House licensed it to Penguin Books in the UK, who used the title &quot;Alone in Berlin&quot;. It became a &quot;surprise bestseller&quot; in both the US and UK. It was listed on the official UK Top 50 for all UK publishers, a rare occurrence for such an old book. 

Other German writers who had quit the country when Hitler rose to power felt disgust for those such as Fallada who had remained, compromising their work under the Nazi regime. Most notable of these critics was Fallada&#x27;s contemporary Thomas Mann, who had fled Nazi repression early on and lived abroad. He expressed harsh condemnation for writers like Fallada who, though opponents of Nazism, made concessions which compromised their work. “It may be superstitious belief, but in my eyes, any books which could be printed at all in Germany between 1933 and 1945 are worse than worthless and not objects one wishes to touch. A stench of blood and shame attaches to them. They should all be pulped.”

The Hans Fallada Prize, a literary prize awarded by the city of Neumünster, was named after the author.

In popular culture &quot;Hans Fallada&quot; was one of the protagonists of Colin Wilson&#x27;s 1976 novel, &quot;The Space Vampires,&quot; turned into a major fim, &quot;Lifeforce&quot; in 1985.

<text>Petrus Apianus (April 16, 1495 – April 21, 1552), also known as Peter Apian, Peter Bennewitz, and Peter Bienewitz, was a German humanist, known for his works in mathematics, astronomy and cartography. His work on &quot;cosmography&quot;, the field that dealt with the earth and its position in the universe, was presented in his most famous publications, &quot;Astronomicum Caesareum&quot; (1540) and &quot;Cosmographicus liber&quot; (1524). His books were extremely influential in his time, with the numerous editions in multiple languages being published until 1609. The lunar crater &quot;Apianus&quot; and asteroid 19139 Apian are named in his honour.

== Life and work ==
Apianus was born as Peter Bienewitz (or Bennewitz) in Leisnig in Saxony; his father, Martin, was a shoemaker. The family was relatively well off, belonging to the middle-class citizenry of Leisnig. Apianus was educated at the Latin school in Rochlitz. From 1516–1519 he studied at the University of Leipzig; during this time, he Latinized his name to &quot;Apianus&quot; (lat. &quot;apis&quot; means &quot;bee&quot;; &quot;Biene&quot; is the German word for bee).

In 1519, Apianus moved to Vienna and continued his studies at the University of Vienna, which was considered one of the leading universities in geography and mathematics at the time and where Georg Tannstetter taught. When the plague broke out in Vienna in 1521, he completed his studies with a B.A. and moved to Regensburg and then to Landshut. At Landshut, he produced his &quot;Cosmographicus Liber&quot; (1524), a highly respected work on astronomy and navigation which was to see more than 40 reprints in four languages (Latin; French, 1544; Dutch, 1545; Spanish, 1548) and that remained popular until the end of the 16th century. Later editions were produced by Gemma Frisius.
In 1527, Peter Apianus was called to the University of Ingolstadt as a mathematician and printer. His print shop started small. Among the first books he printed were the writings of Johann Eck, Martin Luther&#x27;s antagonist. This print shop was active between 1543 and 1540 and became well known for its high-quality editions of geographic and cartographic works. It is thought that he used stereotype printing techniques on woodblocks. The printer&#x27;s logo included the motto &quot;Industria superat vires&quot; in Greek, Hebrew, and Latin around the figure of a boy.
Through his work, Apianus became a favourite of emperor Charles V, who had praised &quot;Cosmographicus liber&quot; at the Imperial Diet of 1530 and granted him a printing monopoly in 1532 and 1534. In 1535, the emperor made Apianus an armiger, i.e. granted him the right to display a coat of arms. In 1540, Apianus printed the &quot;Astronomicum Caesareum&quot;, dedicated to Charles V. Charles promised him a truly royal sum (3,000 golden guilders), appointed him his court mathematician, and made him a &quot;Reichsritter&quot; (a free imperial knight) and in 1544 even an Imperial Count Palatine. All this furthered Apianus&#x27;s reputation as an eminent scientist. &quot;Astronomicum Caesareum&quot; is noted for its visual appeal. Printed and bound decoratively, with about 100 known copies, it included several Volvelles that allowed users to calculate dates, the positions of constellations and so on. Apianus noted that it took a month to produce some of the plates. Thirty-five octagonal paper cut instruments were included with woodcuts that are thought to have been made by Hans Brosamer () who may have trained under Lucas Cranach, Sr. in Wittemberg. It also incorporated star and constellation names from the work of the Arab astronomer &quot;Azophi&quot; (Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi Apianus is also remembered for publishing the only known depiction of the Bedouin constellations in 1533. On this map Ursa Minor is an old woman and three maidens, Draco is four camels, and Cepheus was illustrated as a shepherd with sheep and a dog.
Despite many calls from other universities, including Leipzig, Padua, Tübingen, and Vienna, Apianus remained in Ingolstadt until his death. He neglected his teaching duties. Apianus&#x27;s work included in mathematics – in 1527 he published a variation of Pascal&#x27;s triangle, and in 1534 a table of sines – as well as astronomy. In 1531, he observed Halley&#x27;s Comet and noted that a comet&#x27;s tail always point away from the sun. Girolamo Fracastoro also detected this in 1531, but Apianus&#x27;s publication was the first to also include graphics. He designed sundials, published manuals for astronomical instruments and crafted volvelles (&quot;Apian wheels&quot;), measuring instruments useful for calculating time and distance for astronomical and astrological applications.

Apianus married Katharina Mosner, the daughter of a councilman of Landshut, in 1526. They had fourteen children together – five girls and nine sons. One of their children was Philipp Apian (1531–1589), who preserved the legacy of his father, in addition to his own research.

<text>Jason West (born March 26, 1977) is an American politician who served as mayor of the village of New Paltz, New York, from January 1, 2003, to May 31, 2007, and again from June 1, 2011, to May 31, 2015.

A graduate of the State University of New York at New Paltz, West made headlines by solemnizing same-sex marriages in New York. After running as a protest candidate for the New York State Assembly in 2000 and 2002 on the Green Party ticket, West was elected mayor of New Paltz in 2003. He lost his reelection bid on May 1, 2007, to village trustee Terry Dungan.

==Mayoral history==
===Summary===
Elected mayor of New Paltz in 2003 with promises of environmental sustainability, West gained international attention, initially as part of the first Green Party majority elected in New York State and later for risking criminal prosecution to marry 25 same-sex couples.

West was named the &quot;Best New Mayor of 2003&quot; by &quot;Hudson Valley&quot; magazine. He was honored by such organizations as the New York State Senate Democratic Conference, the California State Legislature and community organizations from around the country. He has been profiled in the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;Plenty&quot;, &quot;Out&quot;, &quot;The Advocate&quot;, and &quot;Jane&quot;, among others.

===Same-sex marriages===
On February 27, 2004, West drew national attention to New Paltz when he announced that he would be performing same-sex marriages. On the first day he performed 24 such ceremonies. On March 2, he was charged with 19 misdemeanor counts of &quot;solemnizing marriages without a license&quot; by Ulster County District Attorney Donald Williams. According to Williams, West was not charged for all 25 ceremonies because police only witnessed 19 of them.

West originally announced that he intended to continue performing same-sex weddings; however, on March 5, New York state judge Vincent Bradley issued a temporary restraining order barring West from performing any such ceremonies for a month. West indicated that he would abide by the judicial order while evaluating his legal options. On June 6, Ulster County Supreme Court Judge Michael Kavanagh made the injunction permanent. West later remarked, &quot;Give it 10 or 20 years when we&#x27;re holding state legislatures and Congress. It will just be a nonissue.&quot;

On June 10, New Paltz Town Court Justice Jonathan Katz dismissed the charges against West, ruling that the district attorney had failed to show that the state had a legitimate interest in preventing the marriages, or that the law under which West was charged was constitutional. The district attorney said that he would appeal the ruling.

===Involvement in the United Nations Urban Environmental Accords===
As mayor, West took part in the creation of the United Nations Urban Environmental Accords in San Francisco in the Spring of 2005. He is one of 60 mayors from across the world who signed the original accords.

A signatory to the United States Mayors&#x27; Climate Protection Agreement and the member of the international network Mayors for Peace, West was also a founding member of the Young Elected Officials Network, a nationwide organization of progressive politicians under 35. He also served on its steering committee.

===Defeat in 2007===
West lost his bid for a second four-year term by on May 1, 2007, after a campaign highlighted by an endorsement by Ralph Nader with 514 votes for Dungan to West&#x27;s 379.

===Reelection in 2011===
West was reelected as mayor of New Paltz on May 3, 2011. His salary at the time was $22,500. West requested a $13,000 raise in 2012. The Village of New Paltz Board of Trustees approved the raise. West requested another $13,000 raise in 2013 but instead had his salary returned to the $22,500 level in a revised budget passed 4–0 by the board, with the mayor absent from voting. In response, West sued the board of trustees. The lawsuit was settled by a $12,000 settlement in February 2015.

===Defeat in 2015===
West was defeated by former New Paltz school board member Tim Rogers, who garnered 323 votes, while West received 204 votes. West stated that he was considering the possibility of returning to school for a teaching degree while remaining active in village affairs, and then went about pursuing a Master of Science degree at Bard College.

<doc id="494756" wikidata="Q1145303" url="?curid=494756" title="Multi-booting">
<text>Multi-booting is the act of installing multiple operating systems on a single computer, and being able to choose which one to boot. The term dual-booting refers to the common configuration of specifically two operating systems. Multi-booting may require a custom boot loader.

==Usage==
Multi-booting allows more than one operating system to reside on one computer; for example, if a user has a primary operating system that they use most frequently and an alternate operating system that they use less frequently. Multi-booting allows a new operating system to configure all applications needed and migrate data before removing the old operating system, if desired. Another reason for multi-booting can be to investigate or test a new operating system without switching completely.

Multi-booting is also useful in situations where different software requires different operating systems. A multi-boot configuration allows a user to use all of their software on one computer. This is often accomplished by using a boot loader such as NTLDR, LILO, or GRUB which can boot more than one operating system.

Multi-booting is also used by software developers when multiple operating systems are required for development or testing purposes. Having these systems on one machine is a way to reduce hardware costs.

Multi-booting also allows a user to switch between private and work dedicated systems to maintain access integrity and separation between the two user environments, even if the same operating system is used for each of them.

A possible alternative to multi-booting is virtualization, where a hypervisor is used to host one or more virtual machines running guest operating systems.

==Technical issues==

===Number of operating systems per volume (logical drive)===
In an OS/2 dual-boot configuration, the C drive can contain both DOS and OS/2. The user issues the BOOT command from the DOS or OS/2 command line to do the necessary copy, move and rename operations and then reboot to the specified system on C:. Other systems provide similar mechanisms for alternate systems on the same logical drive.

===Number of operating systems per storage device===

In a multi-boot computer each of the multiple operating systems can reside on its own storage device, or some storage devices might contain more than one operating system in different partitions. The boot loader in or loaded by the MBR displays a menu of logical drives and loads the selected boot loader from the PBR of that drive.

An example of a computer with one operating system per storage device is a dual-booting computer that stores Windows on one disk drive and Linux on another disk drive. In this case a multi-booting boot loader is not strictly necessary because the user can choose to enter BIOS configuration immediately after power-up and make the desired drive first in the boot-order list. However, it is more convenient to have a multi-booting boot loader on one of the drives, set BIOS once to always start booting from (i.e. load the boot loader from) that drive, and then allow the user to choose an operating system from that boot loader&#x27;s menu. No special disk partitioning is necessary when each operating system has its own dedicated disk drive.

An example of a computer with multiple operating systems per storage device is a dual-booting computer that stores both Windows and Linux on the same disk drive but where the BIOS in the system does not let the user boot individual drives and partitions. In this case a multi-booting boot loader &quot;is&quot; necessary. Also, the disk must be partitioned to give each operating system its own partition on the disk drive. This is necessary because each system has its own set of files and operating instructions. Also, when a completely separate operating system is used partitions may need to be formatted to a different format. For example, if a user intends to install both Windows and Linux, then the Windows partition will be most likely formatted in the NTFS format as Windows cannot run off of ext4, and the Linux partition will most likely be formatted in the ext4 file format as Linux cannot run off of NTFS. However, if a user intends to dual-boot two versions of Windows (i.e. Windows 7 and Windows Vista) or two versions of Linux (i.e. Linux Mint and Ubuntu Linux), then the same file system (e.g. NTFS or ext4) can be used across both drives and partitions.

=== Partitioning ===

The basic concept involves partitioning a disk to accommodate each planned installation, usually including separate partitions for boot, root, data storage and backups.

===MBR loader===
An MBR loader, such as Air-Boot, replaces the standard boot code in track 0 with code that displays a selection menu and loads the selected system. Some, e.g., Air-Boot, can be configured either automatically or by the user at boot time, rather than requiring an external configuration menu.

===Linux boot loaders===
Linux loaders such as GRUB and LILO, can reside in the MBR or in a PBR. They use configuration files in /boot to control their selection menus,

===OS/2 Boot Manager===
The OS/2 Boot Manager must be installed in a primary partition. The OS/2 partitioning utilities can configure up to four systems in the menu, each of which can be either in a primary partition or in a logical volume within the extended logical partition. It is possible to include a boot loader such as GRUB in the OS/2 Boot Manager menu, and it is possible to include the OS/2 Boot Manager in the menu for another boot loader. Newer loaders such as Air-Boot, GRUB and LILO offer more flexibility.

===Microsoft Windows and Linux===
One popular multi-boot configuration is to dual-boot Linux and Windows operating systems, each contained within its own partition. Windows does not facilitate or support multi-boot systems, other than allowing for partition-specific installations, and no choice of boot loader is offered. However, most current Linux installers accommodate dual-booting (although some knowledge of partitions is desirable). Commonly installations proceed without incident but upon restart, the boot loader will recognize only one of the two operating systems.

There are some advantages to installing a Linux boot manager/loader (usually GRUB) as the primary bootloader pointed to by the master boot record. Windows operating systems will be found by properly installed Linux bootloaders, but Windows boot managers do not recognize Linux installations (nor does Windows deal natively with Linux file systems). The MBR boot code can be backed up and restored with dd, available on System Rescue CD.

It is often recommended that Windows be installed to the first primary partition. The boot loaders of both Windows and Linux identify partitions with a number derived by counting the partitions. (Note, both Windows and Linux count the partitions according to the ordering of the partitions &quot;in the partition table&quot;, which may be different from the order of the partitions on the disk.) Adding or deleting a partition at the end of a hard drive will have no effect on any partitions prior to it. However, if a partition is added or deleted at the beginning or middle of a hard drive, the numbering of subsequent partitions may change. If the number of the system partition changes, it requires boot loader reconfiguration in order for an operating system to boot and function properly.

Windows must be installed into a primary partition (and in older systems this must be the first partition). Linux can be installed into a partition in any position on the hard drive and can also be installed into logical partitions (within the extended partition). If Linux is installed into a logical partition within the extended partition, it is unaffected by changes in the primary partitions.

===Neutral MBR===
An alternative to storing GRUB in the MBR is keeping Windows&#x27; or other generic PC boot code in the MBR, and installing GRUB or another bootloader into a primary partition other than that of Windows, thus keeping the MBR neutral. Operating system selection at boot time consequently depends on the bootloader configured within the primary partition that has the boot or &quot;active&quot; flag set on its partition table entry, which could be a bootloader of DOS, OS/2, eComStation, ArcaOS or BSD, in addition to Linux or Windows.

With the boot flag set on the Windows primary, the Windows Boot Manager can be used to chainload another installed bootloader through use of a program like EasyBCD. This means the active partition&#x27;s boot manager will first prompt the user for selection what OS to boot, then load another if necessary, such as GRUB, even a bootloader installed to a logical partition, and then GRUB will load the Linux kernel as it normally would were GRUB installed to the MBR.

The active partition could also be one that exists for no purpose other than choosing an operating system to boot, such as the boot manager that shipped with IBM&#x27;s OS/2 Warp and its derivatives.

=== Apple&#x27;s Boot Camp ===
Boot Camp allows owners of Intel-based Apple Macintosh computers to install Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 on their Macs. The software was initially available in beta version as a download from Apple&#x27;s website (which was compatible with Mac OS X version 10.4 (Tiger)), and later came bundled with Mac OS X since version 10.5 (Leopard).

Boot Camp allows non-destructive disk partitioning and resizing of HFS+ filesystems, boot menu options, and an option to burn a CD with necessary device drivers. Since Windows XP is incompatible with Extensible Firmware Interface (the successor to legacy BIOS), the firmware on early Intel Macs needs to be updated to support BIOS emulation first. BIOS emulation is achieved with a compatibility support module (CSM). Apple does not support non-Windows partition formats or drivers so therefore configuring other operating systems is not directly possible through Boot Camp itself. However, any operating system which can utilize the BIOS emulation of Intel Macintosh can be made to work, including non-XP versions of Windows. The Ubuntu Linux distribution is particularly popular for this purpose because they provide an option to use proprietary device drivers along with open source drivers.

<text>David Fraser McTaggart (June 24, 1932 – March 23, 2001) was a Canadian environmentalist who played a central part in the foundation of Greenpeace International.

An excellent all-around athlete, as a young man he won three consecutive Canadian National Badminton Championships in men&#x27;s singles (1956–1958) and represented that country in badminton&#x27;s Thomas Cup (men&#x27;s world team championship) competition. Prior to his involvement in Greenpeace he had prospered as a builder and developer.

In 1972, responding to an ad in the newspapers, he used his personal boat to protest the testing of nuclear weapons in the Pacific by the French government. After getting his boat damaged and being physically hurt by the French Military, his protest succeeded in 1974 when the French announced the end of their atmospheric nuclear testing program. McTaggart spent the next several years pursuing legal action against the French government and assisting in the formation of Greenpeace affiliates across Western Europe. In 1979 he brokered an agreement that led to the formation of Greenpeace International, ending the leadership of the original founding group based in Vancouver, Canada.
He became chairman and chief spokesman for Greenpeace in 1979, retiring in 1991 to live on an olive farm in Paciano, Umbria, Italy.
McTaggart continued to participate in Greenpeace forums after retirement for the rest of his life. He and singer Bryan Adams did a massive postcard campaign to help create the Southern Antarctic Whale Sanctuary. For nearly two years they toured the world asking thousands of concert goers to write to countries involved with whaling to support the sanctuary.
The Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary was established by the IWC in 1994 with 23 countries supporting the agreement and Japan opposing it.

Te Vaka dedicated its song &quot;Sei Ma Le Losa&quot; to McTaggart, who was killed in a car accident on March 23, 2001, near his home in Italy.

In 1987 McTaggart founded the Third Millennium Foundation, a US 501(c)(3) dedicated to continuing his work for disarmament, peace, and a sustainable future. The foundation, headquartered in his former home in Paciano, Italy, continues today promoting local and global projects in his memory.

In 1996 he received the journalistic prize &quot;Golden Doves for Peace&quot; issued by the Italian Research Institute Archivio Disarmo.

<doc id="494767" wikidata="Q4259537" url="?curid=494767" title="Hana Ichi Monme">
<text>is a traditional Japanese children&#x27;s game. The game is similar to the game Red Rover in the Western world, and is often played in kindergartens and elementary schools.

The name &quot;Hana Ichi Monme&quot; means &quot;a flower is one &quot;monme&quot;&quot;, where a &quot;monme&quot; is a historical (Edo period) Japanese coin with a value of 3.75 grams of silver.

Other traditional Japanese children&#x27;s games include &quot;Kagome Kagome&quot; and &quot;Dahrumasan ga Koronda&quot;. Many games have songs that go with them.

==Play==
Players split into two groups, and the members of each group hold hands, so that the teams face each other in two lines. One group steps toward the other in the rhythm of a song that is used only for the game, and the other steps back so that the team lines remain parallel. In each phrase of the song, the team that is stepping back changes, and the team creates a move that associates a swing.

Each time the song ends, the team leaders step forward and do &quot;janken&quot;, a Japanese version of rock paper scissors. The winner goes back to his team, and they discuss who the team wants to add from the other team. After they have decided, they sing another song doing the same movement and announce the person they want. The game ends when one team loses all of its members.

===Variant===
In this variant, the two teams sing alternate lines from a song when advancing. As the word &quot;monme&quot; is sung, that team kicks into the air as if to kick the dirt into the opponents&#x27; faces.

The children then huddle to choose a person from the opposing team and return in line to call out:-
The two named children then step forward to . The loser joins the winning team&#x27;s line. The game ends the same way.

<doc id="494768" wikidata="Q17074907" url="?curid=494768" title="Piastre">
<text>The piastre or piaster () is any of a number of units of currency. The term originates from the Italian for &quot;thin metal plate&quot;. The name was applied to Spanish and Hispanic American pieces of eight, or pesos, by Venetian traders in the Levant in the 16th century.

These pesos, minted continually for centuries, were readily accepted by traders in many parts of the world. After the countries of Latin America had gained independence, pesos of Mexico began flowing in through the trade routes, and became prolific in the Far East, taking the place of the Spanish pieces of eight which had been introduced by the Spanish at Manila, and by the Portuguese at Malacca. When the French colonised Indochina, they began issuing the new French Indochinese piastre (&quot;piastre de commerce&quot;), which was equal in value to the familiar Spanish and Mexican pesos.

In the Ottoman Empire, the word &quot;piastre&quot; was a colloquial European name of Kuruş. Successive currency reforms by debasing the Ottoman currency had reduced the value of the Ottoman piastre by the late 19th century so as to be worth about two pence (2d) sterling. Hence the name &quot;piastre&quot; referred to two distinct kinds of coins in two distinct parts of the world, both of which had descended from the Spanish pieces of eight.

Because of the debased values of the piastres in the Middle East, these piastres became subsidiary units for the Turkish, Lebanese, Cypriot, and Egyptian pounds. Meanwhile, in Indochina, the piastre continued into the 1950s and was subsequently renamed the riel, the kip, and the dong in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam respectively.

==As a main unit==
* French Indochinese piastre
* South Vietnamese piastre (đồng)

==As a sub-unit==
* of the Egyptian pound

* of the Jordanian dinar
* of the Lebanese pound
* of the South Sudanese pound (spelled &quot;piaster&quot;)
* of the Sudanese pound
* of the Syrian pound

===Obsolete currencies===
* of the Cypriot pound
* of the Libyan pound
* of the Turkish lira

==Other usage==

Early private bank currency issues in French-speaking regions of Canada were denominated in piastres, and the term continued in official use for some time as a term for the Canadian dollar. For example, the original French version of the 1867 Constitution of Canada refers to a requirement that senators hold property . 

The term is still unofficially used in Quebec, Acadian, Franco-Manitoban, and Franco-Ontarian language as a reference to the Canadian dollar, much as English speakers say &quot;bucks.&quot; (The official French term for the modern Canadian dollar is .) When used colloquially in this way, the term is often pronounced and spelled (pl. ). It was equivalent to 6 New France livres or 120 , a quarter of which was &quot;&quot;, which is also still in slang for a 25-cent coin.

 was also the original French word for the United States dollar, used for example in the French text of the Louisiana Purchase. Calling the US dollar a piastre is still common among speakers of Cajun French and New England French. Modern French uses for this unit of currency as well. The term is still used as slang for US dollars in the French-speaking Caribbean islands, most notably Haiti.

&quot;Piastre&quot; is another name for kuruş, of the Turkish lira.

The &quot;piastre&quot; is still used in Mauritius when bidding in auction sales, similarly to the way that guineas are used at British racehorse auctions. It is equivalent to 2 Mauritian rupees.

<text>Joscelyn Eve Stoker (born 11 April 1987), known professionally as Joss Stone, is an English singer, songwriter and actress. She rose to prominence in late 2003 with her multi-platinum debut album, &quot;The Soul Sessions&quot;, which made the 2004 Mercury Prize shortlist. Her second album, &quot;Mind Body &amp; Soul&quot; (2004), topped the UK Albums Chart and spawned the top-ten single &quot;You Had Me&quot;, Stone&#x27;s most successful single on the UK Singles Chart to date. Both the album and single received one nomination at the 2005 Grammy Awards, while Stone herself was nominated for Best New Artist, and in an annual BBC poll of music critics, Sound of 2004, was ranked fifth as a predicted breakthrough act of 2004. She became the youngest British female singer to top the UK Albums Chart. Stone&#x27;s third album, &quot;Introducing Joss Stone&quot;, released in March 2007, achieved gold record status by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and yielded the second-ever highest debut for a British female solo artist on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and became Stone&#x27;s first top-five album in the US.

She released her fourth album, &quot;Colour Me Free!&quot;, in 2009, which reached the top 10 on Billboard 200. Stone released her fifth album, &quot;LP1&quot;, in 2011, which reached the top 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot;. Throughout her career, Stone has sold 15 million records worldwide, establishing herself as one of the best-selling soul artists of the 2000s, and the best-selling British artists of her time. Her first three albums have sold over 2,722,000 copies in the US, while her first two albums have sold over 2 million copies in the UK.

Stone has earned several awards including two Brit Awards and one Grammy Award out of five nominations. She made her film acting debut in 2006 with the fantasy adventure film &quot;Eragon&quot;, and made her television debut portraying Anne of Cleves in the Showtime series &quot;The Tudors&quot; in 2009. Stone was the youngest woman on the 2006 &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot;—an annual list of the UK&#x27;s wealthiest people—with £6 million. In 2012, her net worth was estimated to be £10 million, making her the fifth richest British musician under 30. &quot;The Soul Sessions Vol. 2&quot; (2012) is her fourth consecutive album to reach the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Early life==
Joscelyn Eve Stoker was born on 11 April 1987 at Buckland Hospital in Dover, Kent, and spent her teenage years in Ashill, a small village near Cullompton in Devon. She is the third of four children born to Wendy (née Skillin) and Richard Stoker. Her father owns a fruit and nut import–export business Western Commodities; her mother worked as Stone&#x27;s manager until October 2004. Stone attended the Uffculme Comprehensive School, in Uffculme, Devon, where she first performed with a cover version of Jackie Wilson&#x27;s 1957 song &quot;Reet Petite&quot;. Stone has dyslexia and left school at age sixteen with three GCSE qualifications.

Stone grew up listening to a wide variety of music including 1960s and 1970s American R&amp;B and soul music performed by such artists as Dusty Springfield and Aretha Franklin. As a result, she developed a soulful style of singing like her idols. &quot;My first CD that I owned was &quot;Aretha Franklin: Greatest Hits&quot;. And I saw the advert on TV and it was just like little clips of her songs. I had no idea who she was—I was only like 10 so. I said, &#x27;Oh yeah, that looks really good&#x27;, so I wrote it down and I said to my mum, &#x27;Can I have that for Christmas?&#x27; So she told my friend Dennis, who always gets me good music anyway, and he got that for me. So that was one of my first albums that I loved.&quot; She would later tell MTV News: &quot;I kind of clicked into soul music more than anything else because of the vocals. You&#x27;ve got to have good vocals to sing soul music and I always liked it ever since I was little.&quot;

==Career==

===2001–2003: Beginnings and &quot;The Soul Sessions&quot;===

In 2001, aged 13, Stone auditioned for the BBC Television talent show &quot;Star for a Night&quot; in London, singing Aretha Franklin&#x27;s 1968 Goffin-King hit &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot; and Whitney Houston&#x27;s 1999 single, &quot;It&#x27;s Not Right but It&#x27;s Okay&quot;. After passing her audition, she sang Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;On the Radio&quot; for the broadcast, and eventually won the contest. She also appeared on and won &quot;Steps to the Stars&quot; (a TV programme hosted by H &amp; Claire of the group Steps). Stone then performed on a charity show, where she drew the attention of the Boilerhouse Boys, composed of London-based producers Andy Dean and Ben Wolfe, who contacted S-Curve Records founder and CEO, Steve Greenberg in December 2001 telling him &quot;they had just heard the greatest singer they&#x27;d ever heard from their country&quot;. In early 2002, Greenberg flew Stone to New York for an audition, in which she sang to backing tracks of classic soul songs: Otis Redding&#x27;s 1968 &quot;(Sittin&#x27; On) The Dock of the Bay&quot;, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips&#x27; 1973 &quot;Midnight Train to Georgia&quot;, and Franklin&#x27;s &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot;; Greenberg instantly signed her to his label.

After being signed by S-Curve Records, her US market album was released by S-Curve Records and in the international market her album was released by EMI Music. Stone flew to Miami and Philadelphia to start work on her debut album, &quot;The Soul Sessions&quot;, released on 16 September 2003. She collaborated with people with solid credentials in the Miami soul scene such as Betty Wright, Benny Latimore, Timmy Thomas and Little Beaver as well as contemporary acts Angie Stone and the Roots. The album, produced by Steve Greenberg, Mike Mangini and Betty Wright, consists of little-known soul tracks by Franklin, Laura Lee, Bettye Swann and others. Released in late 2003, it reached the top five on the UK Albums Chart as well as the top forty of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The lead single, &quot;Fell in Love with a Boy&quot;, a reworking of the White Stripes&#x27; 2001 &quot;Fell in Love with a Girl&quot;, reached the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart, as did the second single, a cover version of Sugar Billy&#x27;s 1974 song &quot;Super Duper Love (Are You Diggin&#x27; on Me)&quot;. The album eventually went triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry in mid-April 2005 and gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in late March 2004.

===2004–2006: &quot;Mind Body &amp; Soul&quot; and film debut===

After achieving critical acclaim with &quot;The Soul Sessions&quot;, Stone worked on new material, and recorded her second album, &quot;Mind Body &amp; Soul&quot;, which was released on 28 September 2004, produced by the same team as her first album. She called the album her real debut. It debuted at No. one in the UK, breaking the record for the youngest female ever to top the UK Albums Chart, and just missed the top ten of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 after peaking at No. 11. The lead single, &quot;You Had Me&quot;, became her biggest hit to date when it rose to No. 9 in the UK. Follow-up singles &quot;Right to Be Wrong&quot; and &quot;Spoiled&quot; both made the top 40, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Cha Wanna Ride&quot;, the top 20. &quot;Spoiled&quot; landed just outside the top 50 of US Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, peaking at No. 54. In early September 2005, &quot;Mind, Body &amp; Soul&quot; was certified triple platinum by the BPI and platinum by the RIAA.

In April 2004, Stone performed during the VH1&#x27;s benefit concert Divas Live 2004 alongside Ashanti, Cyndi Lauper, Gladys Knight, Jessica Simpson and Patti LaBelle, in support of the Save the Music Foundation. Stone joined Band Aid 20 on 14 November 2004 in benefit of Sudan&#x27;s troubled Darfur region. The group, which included Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin and U2 lead singer Bono, re-recorded the 1984 song &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, written by Band Aid organisers Bob Geldof and Midge Ure. Stone, who was born two years after the release of the original single, was not initially aware of who Bob Geldof was, with media reporting that she repeatedly referred to him as Bob Gandalf. Despite some criticism, the single became the UK&#x27;s biggest-selling single of 2004 as well as the 2004 Christmas number-one single.

At the 2005 BRIT Awards, Stone won for British Female Solo Artist and British Urban Act—entering the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the youngest BRIT Award solo winner at age seventeen, and was nominated for British Breakthrough Act. She also received a nomination for Best UK Act of the Year at the 2005 MOBO Awards, as well as three nominations for the 2005 Grammy Awards—Best New Artist, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;You Had Me&quot;, and Best Pop Vocal Album for &quot;Mind Body &amp; Soul&quot;, where she sang with rock performer Melissa Etheridge, in tribute to blues-rock singer Janis Joplin. Their performance of &quot;Cry Baby/Piece of My Heart&quot; was released as a single, and through the aid of strong digital download sales, became Stone&#x27;s first single to enter the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, when it debuted and peaked at No. 32 the week of 2 April 2005.
In March 2005, Stone was named the spokesperson for the Gap clothing company, replacing the actress Sarah Jessica Parker. She appeared in a television advertisement for that store chain singing a cover of Ray Charles&#x27;s 1958 song &quot;Night Time Is the Right Time&quot; (retitled &quot;The Right Time&quot;). Stone also appeared in one of Gap&#x27;s Fall 2005 &quot;Favorites&quot; commercials, singing the Beach Boys&#x27; 1966 song &quot;God Only Knows&quot;. By that time, rumours circulated about her being dropped from the campaign because she was living with then-25-year-old songwriter and producer Beau Dozier (son of Motown producer and composer Lamont Dozier) in Los Angeles while she was only 17. However, Gap later denied the rumours, stating that they were very happy with Stone and telling BBC Radio 1 that the claims were &quot;absolute tosh&quot; and &quot;a complete fabrication&quot;. On 11 April 2005, Stone performed &quot;Spoiled&quot;, Rufus&#x27; 1974 song &quot;Tell Me Something Good&quot; with John Legend, Otis Redding&#x27;s 1966 song &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot; with Donna Summer, and 1977&#x27;s &quot;Hot Legs&quot; with Rod Stewart at &quot;Save the Music: A Concert to Benefit the VH1 Save the Music Foundation&quot;, in benefit of VH1&#x27;s Save the Music Foundation. Three months later, on 2 July 2005, Stone performed &quot;Super Duper Love&quot;, &quot;I Had a Dream&quot;, and &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot; at the Live 8 concert at Hyde Park, London. Stone was an opening act for the Rolling Stones during their 2005 A Bigger Bang tour.

Stone performed a medley of &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Bag&quot; with James Brown on BBC One&#x27;s chat show &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; on 1 July 2005. Stone collaborated with jazz pianist Herbie Hancock and blues singer-guitarist Jonny Lang on a cover of U2&#x27;s 1988 song &quot;When Love Comes to Town&quot; for Hancock&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Possibilities&quot;. That same year, Stone was featured along with Sean Paul on Santana&#x27;s &quot;Cry Baby Cry&quot;, and worked on a remake of Patti LaBelle&#x27;s 1985 song &quot;Stir It Up&quot; for the soundtrack to the Disney animated film &quot;Chicken Little&quot;. She also collaborated with Lemar in 2006 on his third studio album, &quot;The Truth About Love&quot;, on the track &quot;Anniversary&quot;.

On 5 February 2006, Stone joined Stevie Wonder, India.Arie, and John Legend during the Super Bowl XL pre-game ceremonies to perform a medley of Wonder&#x27;s hits. Three days later, on 8 February, on the night of the 2006 Grammy Awards, she helped perform a medley of Sly &amp; the Family Stone&#x27;s hits alongside Legend, Ciara, Maroon 5, will.i.am, Robert Randolph, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry. Stone made her film debut in the fantasy adventure film &quot;Eragon&quot; (based on the 2003 novel of the same name by Christopher Paolini), directed by Stefen Fangmeier and released on 15 December 2006, playing the fortune teller Angela. At the 2007 Grammy Awards, Stone shared the award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for her collaboration with John Legend and Van Hunt on their 2005 cover of Sly &amp; the Family Stone&#x27;s 1971 chart-topper &quot;Family Affair&quot;.

===2007–2008: &quot;Introducing Joss Stone&quot;===

Stone caused controversy at the 2007 BRIT Awards ceremony on 14 February 2007 while presenting the award for British Male Solo Artist (won by James Morrison). Speaking in an American accent, she circled the podium and gave a speech about Robbie Williams, who had been the target of earlier jokes made by host Russell Brand. Williams had been reported as going into rehabilitation that same week. As her speech continued, she made remarks about Brand, implying that he was heading for rehabilitation himself (while singing a passage of Amy Winehouse&#x27;s hit &quot;Rehab&quot;). In response to the British media&#x27;s reaction, Stone responded, &quot;At the end of the day, I don&#x27;t give a fuck if people have a problem with my accent. That&#x27;s all I can say about it. The words I say do not change. If the way that it sounds is skew-wiff and you don&#x27;t like it, don&#x27;t listen. I&#x27;m not being a cruel person by sounding a different way. And I can&#x27;t help it. I&#x27;ve been [in America working] since I was, like, 14.&quot; Stone later claimed that her record label cancelled all her upcoming press appearances to publicise her upcoming third album as a result of the backlash.
Stone began work on her third studio album, &quot;Introducing Joss Stone&quot;, at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, in May 2006. Released on 12 March 2007, the album was coordinated by A&amp;R Chris Anokute, produced by Raphael Saadiq, and included collaborations with Lauryn Hill, Common, and Joi. Virgin Records describes the album as &quot;an electrifying mix of warm vintage soul, 1970s-style R&amp;B, Motown girl-group harmonies, and hip-hop grooves&quot;. Stone herself describes it as &quot;truly me. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m calling it &quot;Introducing Joss Stone&quot;. These are my words, and this is who I am as an artist.&quot; She also revealed on &quot;The Tavis Smiley Show&quot; that her break-up with Beau Dozier was a source of inspiration while writing &quot;Introducing Joss Stone&quot;. The album debuted and peaked at No. 12 on the UK Albums Chart, not managing to match the success of Stone&#x27;s two previous albums. It nevertheless debuted at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 selling 118,000 copies in its first week, becoming the highest debut for a British solo female artist on the US chart, surpassing the record previously held by Amy Winehouse with &quot;Back to Black&quot; (which in turn would later be outdone by Leona Lewis, whose album &quot;Spirit&quot; debuted at No. 1 the week of 26 April 2008).

&quot;Tell Me &#x27;Bout It&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single, debuted and peaked at No. 28 on the UK Singles Chart. The second single, &quot;Tell Me What We&#x27;re Gonna Do Now&quot;, a collaboration with rapper Common, failed to chart inside the UK top seventy-five. Stone and Common turned the single&#x27;s music video into a Product Red, reverting 100% of the gains from copies of the video purchased from iTunes to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Stone is the first Product Red artist to do so. Stone also sampled Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Respect&quot;, taking the texture and sound of the song, but keeping her own composition. &quot;Baby Baby Baby&quot; was released digitally in December 2007 and physically in January 2008 as the third single. In support of the album, Stone embarked on a North American tour which began on 27 April at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, Connecticut and ended on 13 June at the Filene Center in Vienna, Virginia, visiting sixteen cities in total including Philadelphia, San Francisco, Vancouver, Chicago, Toronto, New York and Boston. Two months later, she went on a North American late-summer tour which kicked off on 27 August at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles and ended on 29 September at the Crossroads in Kansas City, Missouri, covering twelve cities—this time including Mexico City.

===2009–2010: &quot;Colour Me Free!&quot; and departure from EMI===

Stone was photographed by Canadian singer-guitarist and photographer Bryan Adams for Phonak&#x27;s &quot;Hear the World&quot; initiative, whose main goal is to raise global awareness for the topic of hearing and hearing loss. On 7 July 2007, Stone performed at the South African leg of the Live Earth concerts at the Coca-Cola Dome in Johannesburg, to promote awareness of global warming. She sang the &quot;Introducing Joss Stone&quot; tracks &quot;Girl They Won&#x27;t Believe It&quot;, &quot;Headturner&quot;, &quot;Tell Me What We&#x27;re Gonna Do Now&quot;, &quot;Music&quot;, and &quot;Tell Me &#x27;bout It&quot;, as well as &quot;Mind, Body &amp; Soul&quot; &quot;Right to Be Wrong&quot; and &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;, the latter with Angélique Kidjo. In a 2022 interview, Stone said &quot;Right to Be Wrong&quot; is the song she is most attached to as she wrote it with late Betty Wright.

Stone covered Nat King Cole&#x27;s 1965 song &quot;L-O-V-E&quot; for an advertising campaign for Chanel&#x27;s Coco Mademoiselle fragrance.

On 29 November 2007, Stone joined Jeff Beck on a duet of the Impressions&#x27;s 1965 song &quot;People Get Ready&quot; as part of his series of concerts at London&#x27;s Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club, documented on the DVD &quot;Performing This Week: Live at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s&quot;. To raise the awareness of AIDS, Annie Lennox joined forces with twenty-three female acts (including Stone) and recorded the song &quot;Sing&quot;, which was released on World AIDS Day on 1 December 2007, when Lennox performed at one of Nelson Mandela&#x27;s 46664 concerts at Johannesburg&#x27;s Ellis Park Stadium. In mid-December 2007, Stone was named the new Flake girl to star in a series of television adverts for the Cadbury Schweppes product in the spring of 2008. According to the company, she is the first non-model to take the role.

In March 2008, Stone landed the role of lesbian bingo caller Stephanie in the British romantic comedy film &quot;Snappers&quot;, for which she also wrote music. However, the film was never released. Stone made her television debut portraying Henry VIII&#x27;s fourth wife Anne of Cleves in the third season of the Showtime series &quot;The Tudors&quot;. She reprised the role in the show&#x27;s final season in 2010, appearing in two episodes.

Stone launched a legal battle in a bid to leave her record label, EMI, and free her of her current three-album deal with the record label in April 2008. Stone performed at the 19th Annual GLAAD Media Awards at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles on 26 April 2008. She also performed &quot;Right to Be Wrong&quot; at the LA PRIDE 2008—produced by Christopher Street West, a non-profit organisation in West Hollywood, California, on 7 June 2008. On 26 October 2008, Stone sang the British national anthem, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, before the NFL match between the San Diego Chargers and the New Orleans Saints, held at Wembley Stadium in London.
On 7 December 2008, Stone performed the Who&#x27;s 1965 song &quot;My Generation&quot; on CBS&#x27;s Kennedy Center Honors TV special at the Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C., honouring Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey. In 2010, Stone also appeared on Ringo Starr&#x27;s album, &quot;Y Not&quot; on the song &quot;Who&#x27;s Your Daddy&quot; in which she sang and co-wrote with the ex-Beatle; appeared on Jeff Beck&#x27;s album, &quot;Emotion and Commotion&quot; on the songs &quot;There&#x27;s No Other Me&quot; and &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;, being the last one nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at 53rd Grammy Awards. In late 2010, Stone&#x27;s voice and likeness were used for the &quot;Bond girl&quot; character of Nicole Hunter, a jewellery designer and MI6 agent, in the video game &quot;James Bond 007: Blood Stone&quot;. In addition to portraying the character, she also performed the game&#x27;s theme song, &quot;I&#x27;ll Take It All&quot;, which was co-written and performed with Dave Stewart.

In 2010, Stone provided vocals on two songs for the charity-focused audio drama production, &quot;A Voyage For Soldier Miles&quot;. The songs are &quot;Lover Earth&quot; written by Dave Stewart and Mark Warford and &quot;Never Gonna Be The Same&quot; written and performed by Mark Warford and Niels Lan Doky.

Stone&#x27;s fourth studio album was written and recorded in about a week in Devon in early 2008. She said: &quot;It&#x27;s very, very raw. It&#x27;s a bunch of musicians, writers and myself, and we&#x27;re just jamming, basically.&quot; In promotion of the album, entitled &quot;Colour Me Free!&quot;, Stone played concerts throughout the UK in February and March. Originally scheduled for release in April 2009, &quot;Colour Me Free!&quot; was finally released on 20 October 2009. Stone said that her record company also fought her about the original cover of her new album, calling it &quot;offensive&quot;. It was changed to simple text and no picture of Stone on the American edition. The original cover was used on the other editions worldwide. In late August 2010, it was reported that Stone had left EMI and formed her own independent record label, Stone&#x27;d Records. EMI announced in late December that they would be releasing a greatest hits album, &quot;The Best of Joss Stone 2003–2009&quot;. The compilation was released on 30 September 2011.

In 2010, Stone collaborated with Puerto Rican recording artist Ricky Martin for &quot;The Best Thing About Me Is You&quot;, and peaked at No. 74 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and which topped the &quot;Hot Latin Songs&quot; and &quot;Latin Pop Songs&quot; chart, this was Stone&#x27;s first number-one on all two charts, which also made her the first Briton of non-Hispanic origin to reach No. 1 on the &quot;Hot Latin Tracks&quot; and &quot;Latin Pop Songs&quot; chart.

===2011–2018: &quot;LP1&quot;, &quot;The Soul Sessions Vol. 2&quot; and &quot;Water for Your Soul&quot;===

On 14 June 2011, police arrested two men in Cullompton, Devon, near Stone&#x27;s home, for plotting to rob and murder her. After a trial at Exeter Crown Court for conspiracy to rob, murder and commit grievous bodily harm against her, they were found guilty on 3 April 2013.

Stone partnered with Surfdog Records to release &quot;LP1&quot; on 26 July 2011, through her own label Stone&#x27;d Records. The album was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee in six days, where Stone co-wrote and co-produced the album with Eurythmics co-founder, David Stewart The lead single, &quot;Somehow&quot;, was released on 24 June 2011. Stone also joined the supergroup SuperHeavy which was formed by Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones, together with Dave Stewart (credited by Mick with the original idea of SuperHeavy), Damian Marley (the youngest son of Bob Marley) and the Indian musician and producer A.R. Rahman. The album was recorded at Jim Henson Studios in Los Angeles and was released on 20 September 2011 by A&amp;M Records. The debut single, &quot;Miracle Worker&quot;, was released on 19 July 2011.

Released in July 2012, &quot;The Soul Sessions Vol. 2&quot; saw Stone return to her original label, S-Curve Records, who released the album jointly with the artist&#x27;s Stone&#x27;d Records, and features production from Steve Greenberg (producer of the first &quot;Soul Sessions&quot;). The album finds Stone largely covering lesser-known soul songs from the 1970s and 1980s by acts including the Chi-Lites, the Honey Cone, the Dells, Sylvia, Labi Siffre and Linda Lewis. The album reached the top 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the UK album chart. In the UK it was her first top 10 album since 2004&#x27;s &quot;Mind Body &amp; Soul&quot;. In 2013 she performed live shows including Indonesia and the Philippines. She also made an appearance on UK television series &quot;Top Gear&quot;.

Stone announced to newspaper &quot;La Vanguardia&quot; in July 2012 that she would work on a reggae album. She stated that it would be recorded and produced by her and Damian Marley, who previously worked in SuperHeavy. In March 2014, she elaborated that the new album would be a little bit different and &quot;more eclectic&quot; with a &quot;little bit more hip-hop and reggae&quot;. On 31 July 2015 her album &quot;Water for Your Soul&quot; was released, and was the number-one reggae album the week it came out. In April 2014 she began the &quot;Total World Tour&quot; with the intention of performing in as many countries as possible. In November 2017 Stone, along with Nitin Sawhney, Jonathan Shorten, Jonathan Joseph and Cameroonian multi-instrumentalist Étienne M&#x27;Bappé released the &quot;Project Mama Earth&quot;, an 11-track EP comprising full-length songs and interludes, inspired by Mother Nature concept and African rhythms. In the same month, she was co-headliner in Night of the Proms in Nederland and Belgium. In October 2018, Stone was cast as a guest-star in season 5 of musical drama television series &quot;Empire&quot;.

At the beginning of 2019 Stone sang with James Morrison on the song &quot;My Love Goes On&quot;, making it four years since both singers last released studio albums.

Later the same month, she performed in Turkmenistan and North Korea. In July 2019, Stone was denied entry into Iran, the last stop on her tour.

In April 2020, Stone&#x27;s single &quot;Lean On Me&quot; was released, the song was sung with Beverley Knight, for which a music video was made showing the work of National Health Service helpers.

==Artistry==
Stone possesses the vocal range of a mezzo-soprano and contralto. She often performs barefoot and has been described as &quot;the white Aretha Franklin&quot; since her debut in music industry. However, Stone was the subject of some contention in the United States, according to Alexis Petridis, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2003, where, he claims, her audience expected soul artists &quot;to have been born in poverty and have had a rough and painful life&quot; in order to sing soul music due to its emotional nature.

In 2004, Stone began dating Beau Dozier, with whom she co-wrote the song &quot;Spoiled&quot;. Dozier is the son of Motown producer Lamont Dozier, part of the team Holland-Dozier-Holland. The couple ended their relationship in November 2005.

<text>Kerkor Kirk Kerkorian (; June 6, 1917 – June 15, 2015) was an American businessman, investor, and philanthropist. He was the president and CEO of Tracinda Corporation, his private holding company based in Beverly Hills, California. Kerkorian was one of the important figures in the shaping of Las Vegas and, with architect Martin Stern Jr., is described as the &quot;father of the mega-resort&quot;. He built the world&#x27;s largest hotel in Las Vegas three times: the International Hotel (opened in 1969), the original MGM Grand Hotel (1973) and the current MGM Grand (1993). He purchased the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer movie studio in 1969.

Of Armenian descent, Kerkorian provided over $1 billion for charity in Armenia through his Lincy Foundation, which was established in 1989 and particularly focused on helping to rebuild northern Armenia after the 1988 earthquake. Kerkorian also provided money to ensure that a film based on the history of the Armenian genocide would be made. The resulting film, called &quot;The Promise&quot;, premiered in April 2017 in the United States. In 2000 &quot;Time&quot; magazine named him the 10th largest donor in the US. Kerkorian was declared an honorary citizen of Armenia. He was bestowed the title of National Hero of Armenia, the highest state award.

==Early years==
Kirk Kerkorian was born on June 6, 1917, in Fresno, California, to Armenian parents who escaped present-day Turkey via cattle boat during the Armenian Genocide. Armenian was his first language and he &quot;didn&#x27;t learn the English language until he hit the streets.&quot; His family moved to Los Angeles following the depression of 1920–21. Dropping out of school in eighth grade, Kerkorian became a fairly skilled amateur boxer under the tutelage of his older brother Nish Kerkorian, fighting under the name &quot;Rifle Right Kerkorian&quot; to win the Pacific amateur welterweight championship. Kirk Kerkorian also had an older sister, Rose Kerkorian.

==Business career==
===Aviation===
Sensing the onset of World War II, and not wanting to join the infantry, Kerkorian learned to fly at the Happy Bottom Riding Club in the Mojave Desert—adjacent to the United States Army Air Corps&#x27;s Muroc Field, now Edwards Air Force Base. In exchange for flying lessons from pioneer aviator Pancho Barnes, he agreed to milk and look after her cattle.

On gaining his commercial pilot&#x27;s certificate in six months, Kerkorian learned that the British Royal Air Force was ferrying Canadian-built de Havilland Mosquitos over the North Atlantic to Scotland. The Mosquito&#x27;s fuel tank carried enough fuel for , while the trip directly was . Rather than take the safer Montreal–Labrador–Greenland–Iceland–Scotland route (although, going further north could mean the wings icing, and the plane crashing), Kerkorian preferred the direct &quot;Iceland Wave&quot; route, which blew the planes at jet-speed to Europe—but it was not constant, and could mean ditching. The fee was $1,000 per flight. Although accounts claim the risk was that one in four planes failed to make it, the actual rate was closer to one in &quot;forty&quot;. In May 1944, Kerkorian and his Wing Commander John de Lacy Wooldridge rode the wave and broke the old crossing record. Wooldridge got to Scotland in six hours, 46 minutes; Kerkorian, in seven hours, nine minutes. In two and a half years with RAF Ferry Command, Kerkorian delivered 33 planes, logged thousands of hours, traveled to four continents and flew his first four-engine plane.

After the war, having saved most of his wages, Kerkorian spent $5,000 on a Cessna. He worked as a general aviation pilot and made his first visit to Las Vegas in 1944. After spending much time in Las Vegas during the 1940s, Kerkorian quit gambling and in 1947 paid $60,000 for Trans International Airlines, which was a small air-charter service that flew gamblers from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. He then bid on some war surplus bombers, using money on loan from Seagram&#x27;s. Gasoline, and especially airplane fuel, was in short supply at the time, so he sold the fuel from the planes&#x27; tanks, paid off his loan, and still had the airplanes. He operated the airline until 1968 when he sold it for $104 million to the Transamerica Corporation.

Kerkorian then invested in Western Airlines, building up a large stake from 1968 to 1970 and taking control of the board. He remained a major power at Western until 1976, when he sold his remaining stock back to the company. In 1987, MGM funded the launch of MGM Grand Air, an all-premium class airline that flew transcontinental routes.

===Las Vegas===
In 1962, Kerkorian bought in Las Vegas, across the Las Vegas Strip from the Flamingo for $960,000. This purchase led to the building of Caesars Palace, which rented the land from Kerkorian. The rent and eventual sale of the land to Caesars in 1968 made Kerkorian $9 million ($70 million today).

In 1967, he bought of land on Paradise Road in Las Vegas for $5 million and, with architect Martin Stern Jr., built the International Hotel, which at the time was the largest hotel in the world. The first two performers to appear at the hotel&#x27;s enormous &quot;Showroom Internationale&quot; were Barbra Streisand and Elvis Presley. Presley brought in some 4,200 customers (and potential gamblers) every day for 30 days straight, in the process breaking all attendance records in the county&#x27;s history. Kerkorian&#x27;s International Leisure also bought the Flamingo Hotel; eventually, both hotels were sold to the Hilton Hotels Corporation and were renamed the Las Vegas Hilton and the Flamingo Hilton, respectively.

After he purchased the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer movie studio in 1969, Kerkorian (with architect Martin Stern Jr.) opened the original MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, larger than the Empire State Building and the largest hotel in the world at the time it was finished. On November 21, 1980, the original MGM Grand burned in a fire that was one of the worst disasters in Las Vegas history. The Clark County Fire Department reported 84 deaths in the fire; there were 87 deaths total, including three which occurred later as a result of injuries sustained in the fire. After only 8 months the MGM Grand reopened. Almost three months after the MGM fire, the Las Vegas Hilton caught fire, killing eight people.

In 1986, Kerkorian sold the MGM Grand hotels in Las Vegas and Reno for $594 million to Bally Manufacturing. The Las Vegas property was subsequently renamed Bally&#x27;s. Spun off from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, MGM Resorts International owns and operates several properties, including the current MGM Grand, the Bellagio, the New York-New York, Mandalay Bay, The Luxor, Excalibur, Park MGM, the Cosmopolitan and the CityCenter complex in Las Vegas.

MGM sold its Treasure Island Hotel and Casino property to billionaire and former New Frontier owner Phil Ruffin for $750 million.

===MGM===
In 1969, Kerkorian appointed James Thomas Aubrey Jr. as president of MGM. Aubrey downsized the struggling MGM and sold off massive amounts of historical memorabilia, including Dorothy&#x27;s ruby slippers from the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, the majority of MGM&#x27;s backlots in Culver City and overseas operations such as the British MGM studio at Borehamwood. Kerkorian sold MGM&#x27;s distribution system in 1973, and gradually distanced himself from the daily operation of MGM. He also owned minority interest in Columbia Pictures but his holdings were thwarted by the Justice Department who filed an antitrust suit due to his owning stock in two studios. In 1979, Kerkorian issued a statement claiming that MGM was now primarily a hotel company; however, he also managed to expand the overall film library and production system with the purchase of United Artists (UA) from Transamerica in 1981, becoming MGM/UA Entertainment Company. In March 1986, he sold MGM to Ted Turner. After the purchase was made, Turner sold the UA subsidiary back to Kerkorian.

Turner kept ownership of MGM from March 25 to August 26, 1986. He racked up huge debts and Turner simply could not afford to keep MGM under those circumstances. To recoup his investment, Turner sold the production/distribution assets and trademarks of MGM (including its post-April 1986 libraries) to UA while retaining the pre-May 1986 MGM library, Associated Artists Productions (the pre-1950 Warner Bros. Pictures library and Fleischer Studios/Famous Studios &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons) and RKO Radio Pictures libraries, as well as &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; and its animated spin-offs &quot;The New Adventures of Gilligan&quot; and &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Planet&quot;. The MGM studio complex was sold to Lorimar-Telepictures, which was later acquired by Warner Bros.; in 1990, the lot was sold to Sony Corporation&#x27;s Columbia Pictures Entertainment in exchange for the half of Warner Bros.&#x27; lot that it had rented since 1972. Also in 1990, the MGM film company was purchased by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, who then merged the former Cannon with the MGM purchase to create the short-lived MGM-Pathé Communications. Parretti defaulted on the loans he&#x27;d used to buy MGM, leaving MGM in the hands of the French bank, Crédit Lyonnais. Crédit Lyonnais invested significant sums to revive the moribund company and eventually sold it back to Kerkorian in 1996. Kerkorian soon expanded MGM, purchasing Orion Pictures, The Samuel Goldwyn Company and Motion Picture Corporation of America from John Kluge&#x27;s Metromedia in 1997, and bought the pre-April 1996 PolyGram Filmed Entertainment library in 1999 from its parent Philips, which was in the process of selling PolyGram to Seagram.

In 2005, Kerkorian sold MGM once more to a consortium led by Sony. He retained a 55% stake in MGM Mirage.

On November 22, 2006, Kerkorian&#x27;s Tracinda investment corporation offered to buy 15 million shares of MGM Mirage to increase his stake in the gambling giant from 56.3% to 61.7%, if approved.

In May 2009, following the completion of a $1 billion stock offering by MGM Mirage, Kerkorian and Tracinda lost their majority ownership of the gaming company, dropping from 53.8 percent to 39 percent and even after pledging to purchase 10 percent of the new stock offering they now remain minority owners.

===Auto industry===
Kerkorian had an on-again/off-again relationship with the American auto industry. His involvement began in 1995 when with the assistance of retired Chrysler chairman and CEO Lee Iacocca, Kerkorian staged a takeover attempt of the Chrysler Corporation. Chrysler&#x27;s management treated the takeover as hostile, and after a lengthy battle, Kerkorian canceled his plans and sold his Chrysler stake in 1996. As part of the settlement, Iacocca was placed under a gag order forbidding him from discussing Chrysler in public or print for five years. Two years later, Chrysler management agreed to be acquired by German automaker Daimler-Benz. Kerkorian always drove an American vehicle, including a Ford Taurus and Jeep Cherokee.

Kerkorian once owned 9.9 percent of General Motors (GM). According to press accounts from June 30, 2006, Kerkorian suggested that Renault acquired a 20 percent stake in GM to rescue GM from itself. A letter from Tracinda to Rick Wagoner was released to the public, to pressure GM&#x27;s executive hierarchy, but talks failed. On November 22, 2006, Kerkorian sold 14 million shares of his GM stake (it is speculated that this action was due to GM&#x27;s rejection of Renault and Nissan&#x27;s bids for stakes in the company as both of these bids were strongly supported by Kerkorian); the sale resulted in GM&#x27;s share price falling 4.1% from its November 20 price, although it remained above $30/share. The sale lowered Kerkorian&#x27;s holding to around 7% of GM. On November 30, 2006, Tracinda said it had agreed to sell another 14 million shares of GM, cutting Kerkorian&#x27;s stake to half of what it had been earlier that year. By the end of November 2006, he had sold substantially all of his remaining GM shares. After Kerkorian sold, GM lost more than 90% of its value, falling as low as $1/share by May 2009, and filed bankruptcy on June 1, 2009.

On April 5, 2007, Kirk Kerkorian made a $4.58 billion bid for the Chrysler Group, the U.S. arm of Daimler-Chrysler. After Daimler-Chrysler announced they were interested in selling the Chrysler division on February 14, large investors such as Cerberus Capital Management, The Blackstone Group and Magna International each announced intentions to bid on the company. Kerkorian&#x27;s bid, while not expected, was not surprising given his long involvement in the U.S. automobile industry. During the bidding process, he sought the aid of his close associate Jerome York who was a former CFO at both Chrysler and IBM. On May 14, 2007, 80% of the Chrysler arm of Daimler-Chrysler was sold to Cerberus for $7.4 billion.

Kerkorian began buying Ford Motor Company stock in April 2008, and spent about $1 billion to accumulate a 6% stake in the automaker. By October 2008, the investment had lost two-thirds of its value, and he began selling. Tracinda explained, &quot;In light of current economic and market conditions, it sees unique value in the gaming and hospitality and oil and gas industries and has, therefore, decided to reallocate its resources and to focus on those industries.&quot;

On October 21, Tracinda sold the 7.3 million Ford shares at an average price of $2.43, and said it planned to cut further its existing 6.1 percent stake in Ford, for a potential total loss of more than half a billion dollars. Kerkorian sold his remaining stake in Ford on December 29, 2008.

===Wealth===
Kerkorian&#x27;s net worth in 2008 was $16 billion according to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, making him the 41st richest person in the world and the richest person in California at that time. By 2011, Kerkorian was among those hardest hit by the stock market recession as his net worth tumbled to $3.2 billion. In 2013, he was listed as the 412th richest person with a net worth of $3.9 billion.

==Personal life==
Kerkorian was an &quot;intensely private person&quot;. He almost never gave interviews and seldom appeared in public. &quot;Kerkorian rarely attended board meetings and never gave speeches. He was shy, but was a tough negotiator. Those who knew him describe him not as a Hughesian hermit, but as a gentle, gracious, normal guy.&quot;

Kerkorian was an avid tennis player, played in tournaments, associated with other players like Lornie Kuhle, and routinely played with Alex Yemenidjian, a former MGM executive, and former owner of the Tropicana Las Vegas resort. He had a penchant for expensive clothes (especially custom-made outfits by Italian designer Brioni), but drove relatively inexpensive vehicles, such as a Pontiac Firebird, Jeep Grand Cherokee and a Ford Taurus.

Kerkorian died in Beverly Hills, California, on June 15, 2015, nine days after his 98th birthday. He is buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California, near Los Angeles.

===Family===

Kerkorian was married four times, first to Hilda Schmidt from 1942 to 1952. His next marriage, to Jean Maree Hardy, lasted from 1954 to 1984. The two had met at the Thunderbird resort in Las Vegas. Hardy, a dancer from England, traveled the world instructing dance troupes. They met and fell in love while she was sent to check opportunities to choreograph a performance in Las Vegas. The marriage produced Kerkorian&#x27;s two daughters, Tracy and Linda, whose names serve as a portmanteau for Kerkorian&#x27;s personal holding company, Tracinda Corporation, and his charitable organization, the Lincy Foundation. Although divorced, they remained close friends and confidants.

Kerkorian&#x27;s short-lived third marriage (1999) was to professional tennis player Lisa Bonder, 48 years his junior, which lasted only one month. The two had signed a prenuptial agreement before marrying. Kerkorian subsequently was involved in a breach of privacy suit filed against him by Steve Bing. Kerkorian claimed Bing was the father of Bonder&#x27;s daughter, an allegation which was later confirmed by DNA paternity testing. On August 10, 2006, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Kerkorian&#x27;s attorneys were being sued by Bonder because of their connection to former high-profile private investigator Anthony Pellicano, who in 2008 began serving a fifteen-year prison sentence for running a wiretapping scheme. Bonder&#x27;s attorney alleged that Kerkorian&#x27;s lawyers hired Pellicano to wiretap telephone calls between him and Kerkorian&#x27;s ex-wife in order to gain a tactical advantage in the divorce proceedings, an allegation that was later proven true. Pellicano also took a strand of Bing&#x27;s used dental floss (surreptitiously acquired from rubbish) and used it to prove that it was Bing and not Kerkorian who fathered Bonder&#x27;s daughter. Attorney Terry Christensen was subsequently convicted of racketeering for hiring Pellicano to tap Bonder&#x27;s phone, and received a three-year prison sentence that was confirmed on appeal.

Kerkorian&#x27;s short-lived fourth marriage (2014) was to Una Davis, born in 1966. The marriage lasted only 57 days and divorce proceedings were underway when Kerkorian died on June 15, 2015.

===The Lincy Foundation and philanthropic activities===

Kerkorian was active in philanthropy through his charitable foundation, The Lincy Foundation, named after his daughters, Linda and Tracy. The foundation reportedly donated more than $1 billion, though Kerkorian never allowed anything to be named in his honor. The foundation covered half of the cost of an 80-kilometer highway in Armenia. Over the next decade, Kerkorian financed more than $200 million of infrastructure projects in Armenia, including $60 million to the reconstruction of schools and streets and the renovation of many museums, theaters and concert halls.

The Lincy Foundation was dissolved in 2011 after 22 years of charitable activities after dispensing its last $200 million to University of California, Los Angeles. Half was earmarked for medical research, scholarships and other projects while the other half was earmarked to create the &quot;Dream Fund&quot; for charitable causes around the country.

===Estate===
Most of the $2 billion estate was left to charity, with a three-person committee left to distribute the funds within three years. In December 2018, the estate settled with his 4th wife for $12.5 million, along with $10 million and $50 million for two philanthropic foundations, advised by his 4th wife.

==Awards and recognition==
Armenia issued a Kirk Kerkorian stamp in 2017. The city of Gyumri unveiled a statue of Kerkorian in 2018.

<text>Maly Trostenets (Maly Trascianiec, , &quot;Little Trostenets&quot;) is a village near Minsk in Belarus, formerly the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. During Nazi Germany&#x27;s occupation of the area during World War II (when the Germans referred to it as &quot;Reichskommissariat Ostland&quot;), the village became the location of a Nazi extermination site.

Throughout 1942, Jews from Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia were taken by train to Maly Trostenets to be lined up in front of the pits and were shot. From the summer of 1942, mobile gas vans were also used. According to Yad Vashem, the Jews of Minsk were murdered and buried in Maly Trostenets and in another village, Bolshoi Trostinets, between 28 and 31 July 1942 and on 21 October 1943. As the Red Army approached the area in June 1944, the Germans murdered most of the prisoners and destroyed the camp.

The estimates of how many people were murdered at Maly Trostenets vary. According to Yad Vashem, 65,000 Jews were murdered in one of the nearby pine forests, mostly by shooting. Holocaust historian Stephan Lehnstaedt believes the number is higher, writing that at least 106,000 Jews were murdered at the location. Researchers from the Soviet Union estimated there had been around 200,000 murders at the camp and nearby execution sites. Lehnstaedt writes that the estimates include the Jews of the Minsk Ghetto, who numbered 39,000 to almost 100,000.

== Camp establishment and destruction ==

The primary purpose of the camp was the murder of Jewish prisoners of the Minsk Ghetto and the surrounding area. Firing squad was the chief execution method. Mobile gas vans were also deployed. Baltic German SS-&quot;Scharführer&quot; Heinrich Eiche was the camp administrator. As the Red Army approached the camp in June 1944, toward the end of World War II, between June 28 and June 30, the Germans murdered the majority of prisoners by locking them inside of the camps, burning their barracks, and when anyone tried to escape the burning building they were shot. By June 30 the entire camp had been destroyed, however, a few Jewish prisoners were able to escape into the surrounding Blagovshchina forest and survive until July 3 when the approaching Red Army reached the decimated camp.

==After the war==

<text>Diriyah (, &quot;ad-Dir‘īyah&quot;, approximate meaning ‘place of armor’), formerly romanized as Dereyeh and Dariyya, is a town and governorate in Saudi Arabia. Located on the northwestern outskirts of the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Diriyah was the original home of the Saudi royal family, and served as the capital of the Emirate of Diriyah under the first Saudi dynasty from 1727 to 1818. Today, the town is the seat of the Diriyah Governorate, which also includes the villages of Uyayna, Jubayla, and Al-Ammariyyah, among others—and is part of Ar Riyad Province.

The Turaif district, the first capital of Saudis in Diriyah, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010. The layout of the city itself can be studied in the National Museum of Saudi Arabia with the help of a large-scale detailed model of the city on display there. Diriyah also hosts the Diriyah ePrix race for the Formula E championship.

==Location==
The ruins of the old city of Diriyah lay on either side of the narrow valley known as Wadi Hanifa, which continues southwards through Riyadh and beyond. Consisting almost entirely of mud-brick structures, the ruins are divided into three districts, Ghussaibah, Al-Mulaybeed, and Turaif that are set on top of hills overlooking the valley. Of the three, Turaif is the highest, and its bottom is easily accessible to tourists by foot. Part of the city wall, running along the edges of the wadi and also made of mud bricks, are still extant along with some high observation towers.

The modern city is built at a lower altitude at the foot of the hill upon which Turaif is located. To the north of the town, inside the valley, are a number of gardens, palm groves, and small farms and estates. A dam known as Al-Ilb lies further north.

==History==
===During Muhammad&#x27;s era===

In Muhammad&#x27;s time the expedition of Muhammad ibn Maslamah took place here in Muharram, July 627 CE/6AH.

A platoon of thirty Muslims under the leadership of Muhammad bin Maslamah was despatched on a military mission. It headed for the habitation of the Qurata, a sept of the Bakr clan of the Banu Kilab. The platoon attacked that sept and dispersed them in all directions. The Muslims captured war bounty and returned with the chief of the tribe of Banu Hanifa, called Thumamah Bin Uthal al-Hanafi.

===Post 1400===
Although the location is sometimes identified with an ancient settlement mentioned by Yaqut and Al-Hamadani known as &quot;Ghabra&quot;, the history of Diriyah proper dates back to the 15th century. According to the chroniclers of Nejd, the city was founded in 1446–47 by Mani&#x27; Al-Muraydi (), an ancestor of the Saudi royal family. Mani and his clan had come from the area of Al-Qatif in eastern Arabia, upon the invitation of Ibn Dir&#x27; (), who was then the ruler of a group of settlements that now make up Riyadh. Ibn Dir&#x27; is said to have been a relative of Mani&#x27; Al-Mraydi, and Mani&#x27;s clan is believed to have left the area of Wadi Hanifa at some unknown date and were merely returning to their country of origin.

Initially, Mani&#x27; and his clan, known as the Mrudah, settled in Ghusaybah () and Al-Mulaybeed (). The entire settlement was named Al-Dir&#x27;iyah, after Mani&#x27;s benefactor Ibn Dir&#x27;. Later on, the district of Turaif () was settled. Many families from other towns or from the Bedouin tribes of the nearby desert eventually settled in the area and by the 18th century Diriyah had become a well-known town in Nejd.

At that time, Muhammad ibn Saud emerged from a struggle within the ruling family of Al-Diriyah, the Al Miqrin (, sons of Miqrin, a descendant of Mani&#x27;), and became the &quot;emir&quot;, or ruler, of Al-Diriyah. In 1744, Ibn Saud took in a religious scholar named Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, who hailed from the town of Al-Uyaynah, lying on the same wadi some 30 miles upstream. Ibn Saud agreed to implement al-Wahhabi religious views, and what later became known as the First Saudi State, with its capital at Diriyah, was born. Within the next several decades, Ibn Saud and his immediate descendants managed to subjugate all of Nejd, as well as the eastern and western regions of Arabia, and sent raids into Iraq. Diriyah quickly swelled in size and increased in wealth, becoming the largest town in Nejd and a major city in Arabia by the standards of the time. However, the Saudis&#x27; conquest of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina drew the ire of the Ottoman Empire, the major Islamic power at the time, which led to the Ottoman-Saudi War of 1811–1818 and an invasion of Arabia by the Ottoman Empire and Egyptian forces. They brought the Saudi state to an end in 1818, with Diriyah capitulating after a nearly-year-long siege. The leader of the invading force, Ibrahim Pasha, ordered the destruction of Diriyah. However, when a member of the local nobility tried to revive the Wahhabi state in Diriyah, Ibrahim ordered his troops to destroy the town even further and set whatever was left of it on fire. When the Saudis revived their fortunes in 1824 and again in 1902, they made their capital further south in Riyadh, which has remained their capital ever since.

The Ottoman Empire viewed the Arab challenge with caution, especially after the loss of Mecca and Medina, and the removal of the Ottoman emperor&#x27;s name from Friday prayers. An Egyptian army under Ibrahim Pasha was sent to recover lost territory. In 1818 the army entered Diriyah and after a six-month siege penetrated the defences on the Turaif, totally destroyed the houses and cut down every tree in the palm groves. The Egyptians were estimated to have lost 10,000 men in the siege, and the Saudi forces 1,800.

The town&#x27;s original inhabitants left Diriyah after 1818, with the bulk of them moving to Riyadh. In &quot;The Kingdom&quot; (first published in 1981), British author Robert Lacey observed that the Al Saud had &quot;left the shell of their old capital behind them, an enduring reminder of the frontiers of the possible&quot; and compared the old Diriyah to &quot;a sand-blown Pompeii&quot;. However, the area was resettled in the late 20th century, mostly by former nomads (Bedouin), and a new city was founded by the Saudi government in the late 1970s. This new city of Diriyah grew in size and is now a small but modern town and the seat of its own governorate. The ruins remain a tourist attraction and are subject to a slow restoration project on the part of the Saudi government.

==Renovations and development plans==


Saudi Arabia has formed the Diriyah Gate Development Authority (DGDA) to oversee the preservation and development of the historic site. Despite Wahhabi destruction of many Islamic, cultural, and historical sites associated with the early history of Islam and the first generation of Muslims (Muhammad&#x27;s family and his companions), the Saudi government undertook a large scale renovation of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s domain, turning it into a major tourist attraction. In 2018, Jerry Inzerillo, previously the CEO of Forbes Travel Guide, was hired to lead the new authority. In 2019, Inzerillo said that Diriyah would soon be known as &quot;the Beverly Hills of Riyadh.&quot;

Among the rebuilt structures are the bath and guest house, the Qasr Nasr, the Saad bin Saud Palace that was finished by the early 1990s, the Burj Faysal that was a wall tower renovated in the 1980s, major sections of the wall surrounding Turaif, and sections of the outer walls and some watchtowers surrounding the wadi. Outside of the Turaif district, on the opposite side of the wadi Hanifa, the region of the mosque of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab has been completely remodeled, leaving only some of the more recent original structures standing to the north of the complex build on the site of the historic mosque.

The &quot;Turaif District Development Plan&quot; aims to turn the district into a major national, cultural and touristic center. Before turning the complete site into a modern open-air museum documentation and necessary investigations, including excavations especially in places that may need to be remodelled, are planned in three major phases. These will include sites such as:
* Al-Imam Mohammad bin Saud Mosque and Salwa Palace.
* Ibraheem Ibn Saud Palace and Fahad Ibn Saud Palace.
* Farhan Ibn Saud Palace, Torki Ibn Saud Palace, and Qoo&#x27;a Al-Sharia&#x27;a (eastern court of Salwa Palace).
Once finished, there will be a new visitors center as well as a documentation center. Four new museums are planned for the district. 
* A museum of war and defense (as this was the site of a major siege in Saudi Arabia).
* A museum of horses.
* A museum of social life.
* A museum of commerce and finance.
Additionally, a Turaif traditional market will add to the open-air museum experience.

The Saudi government undertook a large scale renovation of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab&#x27;s domain, turning it into a major tourist attraction.

==Main historic sites==

The old city&#x27;s historic structures include:

*Salwa Palace (قصر سلوى) was the residence and first home of the Saʿūdī Amirs and Imāms during the First Saudi State. It is considered the largest palace on the site, rising four stories high. It is composed of five main parts built at different consecutive periods of time. It was probably finished by Saud ibn Abdul Aziz ibn Muhammad ibn Saud, who was Imam from 1803 to 1814. It is now a museum.

*Sa&#x27;ad bin Saʿūd Palace popularly known as the Palace of Saad (قصر سعد بن سعود). One of the largest palaces on the site, it is famous for its courtyard, which was used as a stable. The palace was restored in the late 1980s and is several stories high. Sa&#x27;d ibn Sā&#x27;ud was the son of Imām Abd Allāh bin Saʿūd āl Sāʿūd (d. 1819) and played a prominent role in the battle for the city in 1818.

*The Guest House and At-Turaif Bath House a traditional building consisting of a number of small courtyards surrounded by rooms. The Bath House is famous for its different architectural styles and shows how the building was waterproofed by using different plasters. Both the Guest and Bath Houses were supplied with water from a well in the wadi.
*Imām Muḥammad bin Saʿūd Mosque, a mosque built first during the reign of Imām Mohammad bin Saud (1687–1765), perhaps replacing an earlier structure. Imām Abd al ʿAzīz bin Muḥammad Āl Saʿūd was assassinated here while leading Asr Salat in November 1803. The building fell into ruins after the invasion of 1818 and the disappearance of the first Saudi state; only part of the structure on eastern side survived to the 1970s and is still preserved. A small mosque was built on the south-west corner of the site some time in the first half of 20th century. Subsequently the location was excavated to reveal the large hypostyle mosque of the 18th century. The modern mosque was replaced with a traditional building as part of the development under the UNESCO heritage programme.
*Al-Bujairi (البجيري), one of the districts of the city, directly adjacent to Qasr Salwa on the opposite side of the wadi. It was the religious centre of the historical settlement, surrounded by palm trees. The chief building was mosque of the Shaykh Muḥammad bin ʿAbd al-Wahāb (محمد بن عبد الوهاب), now rebuilt and set in the al-Bujairi Heritage Park. Shaykh Mohammad ibn Abdulwahab used to give lessons about his reformed movement of Islam in this mosque. It became a centre for religious education. Students used to travel to it from all parts of the Arabian Peninsula.
*Ghasiba (غصيبة), a walled historic site and on the edge of Wadi Hanifah, is to the north of old Dir&#x27;iyyah and is thought to date back to the 17th century CE.

==Other notable buildings==
*Qasr al-&#x27;Ujā (قصر العوجا) is a large Saudi royal palace erected adjacent to the old city on the south bank of Wadi Hanifa.
*The mosque of al-Zawiharah (مسجد الظويهرة) is located in the al-Bujairi Heritage Park and is an old traditional building, restored and reopened in 2014. It is notable for the underground chamber or &quot;khālwa&quot;, a feature encountered in the older mosques in the Najd region.
*The mosque of al-Sarikhah (مسجد السريحة) is a modern building made in the traditional central Arabian style. It is located on the west side of the al-Bujairi Heritage Park.
*The mosque of Nakhil al-&#x27;Dhibah (مسجد نخيل العذيبة) is located a short distance to the west of the old city, in the farm of Sultan Bin Salman. It is built in the traditional central Arabian style.

==Museums==
A number of the palaces in the old city have been restored and are used as museums.
*Museum of Bygone Days (متحف السنين الماضية) is located north of al-Bujairi and houses a collection reflecting everyday life in central Arabia in the early and middle twentieth century.

==Public facilities and centres==
*Al-Maarefa University (جامعة المعرفة), is an educational institution to the north of the old city in Al Khalidiyah suburb of Riyadh. 

*Mosim Park, Football ground in the Nakheel area. It is home to football team Mosim FC, who are called The Pride of Dir&#x27;iyah. Mosim Park was erected in 2007 after Mosim FC moved there from their old ground downtown of Riyadh.
*Diriyah Arena opened in 2019 is a sporting venue with a capacity of 15,000 seats.

==Climate==
In Diriyah the summers are long, sweltering, and arid, and the winters are cool and dry. Diriyah has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;).

<text>Steve Jocz (born July 23, 1981), also known as Stevo32 (or simply Stevo), is a Canadian drummer and YouTuber, best known as the original drummer for the Canadian rock band Sum 41.

==Early life and career==
Jocz joined Sum 41 in 1996. Jocz graduated from Exeter High School in 1999.

=== Sum 41 ===
In 1999, the band signed an international record deal with Island Records. The band released their debut EP &quot;Half Hour of Power&quot;, in 2000. Their first album, &quot;All Killer No Filler&quot;, was released in 2001. The band achieved mainstream success with their first single from the album, &quot;Fat Lip&quot;, which reached number-one on the &quot;Billboard Modern Rock Tracks&quot; chart and remains the band&#x27;s most successful single to date. &quot;All Killer No Filler&quot; was certified platinum in the United States, Canada and in the UK. The band released four more studio albums with Jocz: &quot;Does This Look Infected?&quot; (2002), &quot;Chuck&quot; (2004) &quot;Underclass Hero&quot; (2007), and &quot;Screaming Bloody Murder&quot; (2011), the first three having been certified platinum in Canada. Aside from drums, Jocz sang lead vocals and went by the name Pain for the Sum 41 alter-ego heavy metal band Pain For Pleasure, where the members of Sum 41 would parody a 1980s metal band.

Jocz frequently performed over 300 times per year with Sum 41, holding long global concert tours lasting more than a year each. On April 18, 2013, Jocz announced on Facebook and Twitter that he had left Sum 41 with no explanation given.

On May 10, 2023, after hearing that Sum 41 was planning to disband, Jocz posted on Instagram a video of him playing the drums to their song &quot;Still Waiting&quot; as a tribute to the band.

On October 10, 2023, Jocz was interviewed for the first time since his departure from Sum 41 in 2013. During the interview, he revealed to DJ Immortal of 99.9 Punk World Radio FM about his departure from the band, stating: 
=== Other appearances ===
In 2008, Jocz became a contributing member of the Sum 41 spin-off band The Operation M.D., co-created by Sum 41 bassist Jason &quot;Cone&quot; McCaslin before leaving the band in 2012. He helped the band out again in 2017 as a contributing member.

In 2007, Jocz recorded drums for two songs on Avril Lavigne&#x27;s album, &quot;The Best Damn Thing&quot;.

In the summer of 2008, Jocz toured with The Vandals on the Vans Warped Tour.

Jocz again helped The Vandals on drums for some European dates in the summer of 2018. He toured with The Vandals again for some Japanese dates in March 2024.

In June 2024, Jocz began a YouTube channel, called Stevo32Drums.

<text>Towson University (TU or Towson) is a public university in Towson, Maryland, United States. Founded in 1866 as Maryland&#x27;s first training school for teachers, Towson University is a part of the University System of Maryland. Since its founding, the university has evolved into eight subsidiary colleges with over 20,000 students. Its 329-acre campus is situated in Baltimore County, Maryland, eight miles north of downtown Baltimore. Towson is one of the largest public universities in Maryland and produces the most teachers of any university in the state.

== History ==
=== Maryland State Normal School ===

The General Assembly of Maryland established what would eventually become Towson University in 1865, with the allocation of funds directed toward Maryland&#x27;s first teacher-training school, or then called &quot;normal school&quot; (term used from a new French tradition). On January 15, 1866, this institution, known then as the &quot;Maryland State Normal School&quot; (M.S.N.S.), officially opened its doors as part of the substantial modern educational reforms prescribed by the Unionist/Radical Republican Party-dominated Maryland Constitution of 1864 of the Civil War-era state government, which provided for a new state superintendent of public instruction and a Board of Education to be appointed to advise and supervise the counties, in addition to the already progressive public educational system previously established in 1829 in Baltimore City. Located then at Red Man&#x27;s Hall on North Paca Street in Baltimore, the new teachers&#x27; school originally enrolled eleven students and fostered three faculty members. McFadden Alexander Newell served as the school&#x27;s first principal as well as the State Superintendent of Public Instruction and oversaw the first graduating class of sixteen students in June 1866.

As time passed, the enrollment in the school grew exponentially. The State Normal School soon quickly outgrew its temporary facilities in Red Man&#x27;s Hall on Paca Street and moved to another temporary location in 1873 on the northeast corner of North Charles and East Franklin Streets, in the former William Howard Greek Revival mansion (son of famous American Revolutionary War Col. John Eager Howard of the famous &quot;Maryland Line&quot; in the Continental Army who owned most of the land north of Baltimore Town as his estate of &quot;Belvidere&quot; or &quot;Howard&#x27;s Woods&quot;), and his family was now starting to develop and lay out city streets. The landmark mansion, (across the street from the First Unitarian Church of Baltimore), which later was known as the Union Club by 1863 and later became the Athenaeum Club. The following year, the General Assembly appropriated money to construct an exclusive building to house the burgeoning school. In 1876, the Normal School moved its faculty and 206 students to this new landmark facility located in West Baltimore facing Lafayette Square on Carrollton and Lafayette Avenues.

=== Move to Towson ===
The demand for qualified teachers became overwhelming by the turn of the century. The Maryland Department of Education reported an annual need for 350 new teachers, but the Maryland State Normal School was graduating fewer than 100. The facilities in West Baltimore were now inadequate to meet state demands. Principal Sarah Richmond, one of the original eleven graduates, began a campaign to establish a campus where the school could function more appropriately. In 1910, the General Assembly formed a committee to oversee site selection, budget, and design plans for the new campus. John Charles Linthicum was appointed president of the committee, alongside State Superintendent M. Bates Stephens and Sarah Richmond. The committee surveyed locations at Roland Park, Lutherville-Timonium, Mount Washington, Pimlico, Glencoe, and many other areas. Eventually, the committee settled on an site in Towson and the General Assembly financed the $600,000 move in 1912. Construction began in 1913 on the Administration Building, now known as Stephens Hall. In September 1915, the new campus, comprising Stephens Hall, Newell Hall, and the power plant, began classes.

=== Expansions and name changes ===
In 1934, the state decreed that new public school teachers must have baccalaureate degrees instead of two-year teaching certificates, and the school retooled its curriculum to issue Bachelor of Science degrees. The following year, the school changed its name to Maryland State Teachers College at Towson. As the name implied, the college&#x27;s single purpose was to train teachers. In 1946, however, the institution established a junior college to offer two years of college work on a transfer basis. This expansion laid the foundation of what was later to become the art and sciences program. In 1958, the college offered its first graduate program leading to a Master of Education degree. In 1960, the college expanded the art and science programs into four-year courses and began awarding bachelor&#x27;s degrees in these fields. Due to this change in focus, the name changed once more to Towson State College.

Beginning in 1964, the college enrollment rates began a dramatic increase as the baby boomer generation began applying to colleges. Within a decade, Towson State&#x27;s enrollment climbed from 3,537 to 13,399. This expansion led to the construction of the Center for the Arts, University Union, Cook Library, and many other new facilities. Under the presidency of James L. Fisher, the college expanded the courses offered to meet the demands of the growing student body. In 1976, the school&#x27;s name changed again to Towson State University.

Towson joined 10 other public institutions in 1988 in the newly created University System of Maryland. Previously, Towson had been a member of the State University and College System of Maryland with five other public institutions across the state.

Towson dropped the designation &quot;state&quot; from its name and became Towson University on July 1, 1997. The new name recognized shifts in funding and the development and growth of Towson as a metropolitan university.

== Academics ==

Towson University is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and the Maryland State Department of Education. For the Fall 2010 freshmen class, Towson accepted about 57% of their applicants. The average grade point average was a 3.45 and the middle 50% of matriculating students had ACT composite scores between 21 and 25. Towson educates undergraduate and graduate students in thirty academic departments which are subdivided into eight colleges:

* College of Business and Economics
* College of Education
* College of Health Professions
* College of Liberal Arts
* Jess and Mildred Fisher College of Science and Mathematics
* Towson University Honors College
* College of Graduate Studies and Research
* Towson University College of Fine Arts and Communication
** Includes departments for Art; Dance; Electronic Media and Film; Mass Communication; Communication Studies; and Performing Arts. The college&#x27;s performing arts programs provide Music and Theatre Arts and dance performances on and off campus. The college is home to the Asian Arts &amp; Culture Center.

=== Programs ===
The university provides 110 undergraduate majors, and more than 80 graduate degrees and certifications. Other notable undergraduate programs at Towson according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; include business administration, computer science, and nursing. Once students have determined a program of study, they become a member of the academic college administering the program.

Towson&#x27;s gerontology program is one of only 100 such undergraduate programs offered in the United States.

== Enrollment ==
Almost 20,000 full-time and part-time students are enrolled in the university. Their numbers include over 800 international students from 100 nations. There are more than 16,000 undergraduates; approximately 58% are non-white. Also, in 2006 Towson achieved more enrollment in its business school than any other college in the state of Maryland. In 2023, Towson University welcomed 3,047 first-year students, the largest class of freshman in the university&#x27;s history. Compared to the amount of enrolled students, there is a total of 3,115 staff and faculty members, resulting in a 15:1 ratio. The average class size at Towson University is 24.

In terms of demographics, the student population of Towson University is 60% female; 42% White; 30% Black or African American; 10% Hispanic; 7% Asian.

== Student life ==
=== Housing ===
Around 74% of the freshman class, and over 5,000 students among all four classes, reside on campus. The university has 16 residence halls, which include apartment complexes, modern high-rise towers, and more traditional two- and three-story residential buildings. Students can also choose from 10 Residential Learning Communities. While on campus, students have access to a counseling center, an academic advising center, a health center, and a career center.

=== Transportation ===
TU has its own on campus shuttle system that operates free of charge to students. The on-campus shuttle travels to most sections of the school, while the off-campus shuttles travel to housing complexes (The Fairways at Towson, University Village, The Colony, Donnybrook) that students live in that are on the outskirts of the campus. There is also direct access to the MTA Maryland buses with services connecting to the light rail.

=== Campus police ===
The Towson University Police Department (TUPD) is the primary law enforcement agency servicing the students, faculty, and visitors within the campus limits and adjacent streets and roadways. The TUPD is aided by the Baltimore County Police Department as directed by authority. The TUPD is divided into several units such as the Patrol Unit and the Community Crime Reduction Unit. It also includes emergency communications.

== Campus ==
=== Campus Master Plan ===
As a response to the University System of Maryland&#x27;s (USM) desire for Towson University to grow its enrollment, a new Campus Master Plan was developed for the university and approved by the USM board of regents in December 2003. The university found that in the past, it has been guided by master plans that focused inward, resulting in disjointed campus development that was disconnected from the larger Towson community.

The resulting vision, called &quot;TU:2010&quot;. addresses both University System of Maryland requirements and community concerns. It contains over 70 specific initiatives that range from growing diversity to increasing student involvement in service learning projects. Perhaps its most visible development is the creation of academic and student life buildings, as well as roads, parking, utilities, and landscapes to support those buildings.

As part of this vision, Towson&#x27;s campus is undergoing many construction projects set into different phases with staggered completion dates.

=== Campus sustainability ===
In 2007, the university signed onto the American College and Universities Presidents&#x27; Climate Commitment, pledging to become carbon neutral by 2050. The institution has achieved a 48% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The university boast a 44% recycling rate, trayless and strawless dining, 4000 solar panels, 36 E/V charging stations, three green roofs and two bikeshares.

== Athletics ==
The Towson Tigers, formerly the Towson College Knights, are the athletics teams of Towson University. All of the major athletic teams compete in the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) with 20 Division I athletic teams (13 in women&#x27;s sports, 7 in men&#x27;s sports).

Under the leadership of President Bob Caret the university placed a greater emphasis on the athletics program. In September 2010 Caret hired a new director of athletics, Michael P. Waddell, who had significant program building experience at the highest levels of college sports and led the Tigers to unprecedented success during his three years at the helm, including eleven (11) CAA Regular Season &amp; Tournament Championships. Waddell left Towson in 2013 for the University of Arkansas and was replaced by Tim Leonard.

Towson University offers the most comprehensive sports program in the metropolitan Baltimore area, fielding 20 varsity teams that compete in the Colonial Athletic Association. Since joining the league in 2001–02, the Tigers have won CAA titles in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse, men&#x27;s swimming, women&#x27;s swimming, men&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s golf, baseball, track &amp; field and football. During an athletics history that traces its roots to the 1920s, Towson has sent teams and individual student-athletes to NCAA post-season competition in baseball, basketball, football, golf, gymnastics, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, track &amp; field and volleyball.

Eleven Tigers have been named CAA Scholar-Athlete Award Winners for their respective sports, including the 2010 cross country recipient, Brandi Gervais, a senior Biology/Pre-Dentistry Major with a perfect 4.0 GPA. A number of student-athletes have gone on to enjoy professional careers, including Jermon Bushrod, the starting left offensive tackle for the 2009 Super Bowl Champion New Orleans Saints; former Major League Baseball outfielder Casper Wells; and former National Basketball Association shooting guard Gary Neal.

== Towson Tiger ==
Before the 1960s, the name of the sports teams at Towson were known as the &quot;Towson College Knights&quot;. Towson student John Schuerholz pushed for a new mascot, and the tiger was officially adopted in 1962. Schuerholz later became general manager and then president of the Atlanta Braves. The university&#x27;s present baseball complex is named in his honor.

According to school newspaper &quot;The Towerlight&quot;, when the Student Government Association first bought the tiger statue that sits outside Cook Library in 1996, the organization hoped to boost school spirit. Instead, it became subject to vandalism and disrepair. In March 2006, after several acts of vandalism, the statue was completely removed from in front of the library.

In September 2006, the Towerlight reported that a new bronze tiger statue had been unveiled as the centerpiece of the university&#x27;s &quot;Capital Campaign&quot; to raise $50 million. The primary difference between the new statue and previous one is that the new one is made of bronze and all of the legs are on the ground and the tail is wrapped around its legs rather than raised, so it won&#x27;t get damaged by vandals.

The new statue is outside Stephens Hall and was unveiled on February 8, 2007, where Caret said it would be &quot;visible to passersby on York Road as well as students&quot;.

== Traditions ==

=== Tigerfest ===
Tigerfest is TU&#x27;s annual spring festival that features interactive activities for students, as well as live musical entertainment. Tigerfest, which is also open to the public (not just TU students), occurs in late April and was held in Johnny Unitas Stadium for most of the event&#x27;s history. Starting in 2014, the event was moved to Towson&#x27;s brand new basketball arena, TU Arena. Also beginning in 2014 was the festival being held over two days. Day one features events and games on campus, while day two is centered around a concert. Artists such as Lil Yachty, Playboi Carti, Krewella, Kid Cudi, The Used, and Yellowcard have appeared at Tigerfest in the past.

The Division of Economic and Community Outreach (DECO) was established in 2004 as an initiative of President Robert L. Caret. DECO&#x27;s charge is to &quot;provide a focus for engagement with the external community and to provide a path into the university&#x27;s research and project talent.&quot; DECO includes over 130 experts in the following areas: IT Solutions, Mapping Solutions (GIS), Technical Training, Applied Economics and Human Services, Information Assurance, and Business Growth.

=== Cherry Hill Learning Zone ===
The initiative is a partnership among the Baltimore City Public School System, Baltimore City government, Towson University and Cherry Hill&#x27;s community organizations. Together, the programs are trying to rebuild the Cherry Hill neighborhood in southern Baltimore. The program interacts with Cherry Hill&#x27;s civic leaders, community organizations and citizens, the Learning Zone hopes to serve as a resource for the academic progress of Cherry Hill&#x27;s young residents and improvement of the overall environment in the community.

=== Baltimore Urban Debate League ===

The Towson Speech and Debate team has close ties with the Baltimore Urban Debate League and often volunteers people from the team and the university to judge and facilitate the running of the tournaments.

The university often acts as a host for league tournaments at least once a year.

Towson also has what they call an &quot;Urban Debate Scholar&quot; award that they give to one graduating senior every year. The scholarship pays for full tuition and fees at TU. They also offer varying awards between $2,000 – $4,000 to other graduating seniors.

=== Adopt-A-Campus ===
Former President Caret established a program called &quot;Adopt-A-Campus&quot;, which gives local businesses, organizations and others an opportunity to help beautify the TU campus. Every group is assigned a certain section of the campus, and will be encouraged to pick up litter and help keep the area clean of trash and debris.

== Media and publications ==

== Greek life ==
Towson has over 20 Greek letter organizations on campus. In 2022, 7% of undergraduate men and 6% of undergraduate women were active in Towson&#x27;s Greek system.

== Controversies ==

=== 2014 Barry Freundel voyeurism ===

On October 14, 2014, Barry Freundel, a Jewish scholar, rabbi, and religious studies and philosophy professor at Towson University, was suspended after being arrested in connection to allegations that he secretly videotaped women as they used a religious bath known as a &quot;mikvah&quot; near his Georgetown synagogue. One victim was a student of Freundel&#x27;s at Towson, and was encouraged by the professor to take “practice dunks” in the mikvah, though she was not Jewish and had no intention of converting. Authorities reported dozens of students may have also been taken on these “dunking field trips.”

After serving a search warrant on Freundel&#x27;s Towson office, police found a number of computer storage devices, hidden cameras concealed in items such as tissue boxes and a clock radio, and a list of handwritten names. He ultimately pleaded guilty to 52 counts of voyeurism, and was sentenced to years in prison.

<text>The Gateway of India is an arch-monument completed in 1924 on the waterfront of Mumbai (Bombay), India. It was erected to commemorate the landing of George V for his coronation as the Emperor of India in December 1911 at Strand Road near Wellington Fountain. He was the first British monarch to visit India.

The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Islamic style, inspired by elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument by architect George Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a memorial arch made of basalt, which is high, with an architectural resemblance to a triumphial arch as well as Gujarati architecture of the time.

After its construction, the Gateway was used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for important government personnel. The Gateway is also the monument from where the last British troops left in 1948, following Indian independence a year earlier. It is located on the waterfront at an angle, opposite the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel and overlooks the Arabian Sea. Today, the monument is synonymous with the city of Mumbai, and is amongst its prime tourist attractions. The Gateway is also a gathering spot for locals, street vendors, and photographers soliciting services. It holds significance for the local Jewish community as it has been the spot for Hanukkah celebrations, with the lighting of the menorah, since 2003. There are five jetties located at the Gateway, of which two are used for commercial ferry operations.

The Gateway was the site of a terror attack in August 2003, when there was a bomb blast in a taxi parked in front of it. Access to the gateway was restricted after people congregated at its premises following the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which the Taj Hotel opposite the gateway and other locations in its vicinity were targeted.

In March 2019, the Maharashtra State Government proposed a four-step plan to develop the location for the convenience of tourists, following a direction issued by the State Governor in February 2019.

==History and significance==

The Gateway of India was built to commemorate the arrival of George V, Emperor of India and Mary of Teck, Empress consort, in India at Apollo Bunder, Mumbai (Bombay) on 2 December 1911 prior to the Delhi Durbar of 1921 it was the first visit of a British monarch to India. However, they only got to see a cardboard model of the monument, as construction did not begin until 1915. 

The foundation stone for the Gateway was laid on 31 March 1913 by then Governor of Bombay, Sir George Sydenham Clarke with the final design of George Wittet for the Gateway sanctioned in August 1914. Before the Gateway&#x27;s construction, Apollo Bunder used to serve a native fishing ground. Between 1915 and 1919 work continued at the Apollo Bunder to reclaim the land on which the Gateway was to be built, along with the construction of a sea wall. Gammon India had undertaken construction work for the gateway. 

Its foundations were completed in 1920 while construction was finished in 1924. The Gateway was opened to the public on 4 December 1924 by then Viceroy, Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading. Following Indian independence, the last British troops to leave India, the First Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry, passed through the Gateway with a 21-gun salute, as part of a ceremony on 28 February 1948, signalling the end of the British Raj.

N. Kamala, professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, refers to the Gateway as a &quot;jewel in the crown&quot; and a &quot;symbol of conquest and colonisation&quot; which signifies the Indian nation&#x27;s emergence through British colonisation, looking both outward to the imperial traveller and inward to the Indian populace. The monument commemorates the legacy of British colonial rule, namely the first visit of a British monarch to India and its use as an entry point for prominent colonial personnel into British India. Today the Gateway is synonymous with the city of Mumbai. Since its construction, the gateway has remained amongst the first structures visible to visitors arriving in Bombay by the sea.

Since 2003, the Gateway has been the location for the local Jewish community to light the menorah for Hanukkah celebrations every year. This ritual was started by Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg of the chabad in Mumbai (located in Nariman House). It also became a site for prayers following the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks which targeted, amongst others, Nariman House. Rabbi Holtzberg lost his life in the 2008 terror attacks.

==Design and architecture==

The structure, in yellow basalt and concrete, is rectangular, with two long sides and two much shorter ones. Three arched passageways run between the long sides, as well as a single arched passageway between the two shorter sides. The central arch is higher and wider, with an extra storey above, from which four turrets rise. The arches on the short sides are the same size and design as the smaller arches on the long sides. The style of the Gateway of India is Indo-Saracenic architecture, with many details taken from the Gujarati regional style. The façade is reminiscent of Gujarati mosque façades, for example the Jama Mosque, Ahmedabad of 1424, while the basic shape is, in the terminology of classical architecture, an octopylon with a floor plan of eight piers, as used in some triumphal arches and memorials, including the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris. The exterior features restrained but intricate bands of ornament, and jali screens around the smaller arches. 
The Gateway&#x27;s arch has a height of with its central dome being in diameter. The monument is built of yellow basalt and reinforced concrete. The stones were sourced locally while the perforated screens were brought in from Gwalior. The monument faces towards the Mumbai Harbour. There are four turrets on the structure of the gateway, and there are steps constructed behind the arch of the Gateway which lead to the Arabian Sea. The monument features intricate stone latticework (also known as the &quot;jali&quot; work). The Scottish architect, George Wittet combined indigenous architectural elements with elements of 16th-century architecture of Gujarat. The harbour front was realigned in order to make an esplanade, which would sweep down to the centre of the town. On each side of the arch, there are large halls with the capacity to hold 600 people. The cost of the construction was , borne by the then government. Due to a paucity of funds, the approach road was never built. Hence, the Gateway stands at an angle to the road leading up to it.
In February 2019, Seagate Technology and CyArk embarked on a mission to digitally record and preserve the Gateway, by digital scanning and archiving of the monument. The images and data collected will be used to make photo-real three dimensional models. This is a part of CyArk&#x27;s international programme for digitally preserving heritage monuments. It involves aerial surveys conducted with terrestrial laser scanning (LiDAR), drones, and photogrammetry exercises. The drawings and three-dimensional models will inform any future reconstruction works.

==Location and jetties==

The Gateway stands at an angle, opposite to the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel, which was built in 1903. In the grounds of the gateway, opposite the monument, stands the statue of Shivaji, the Maratha warrior-hero who fought against the Mughal Empire to establish the Maratha Empire in the 17th century. The statue was unveiled on 26 January 1961 on the occasion of India&#x27;s Republic Day. It replaced a bronze statue of King-Emperor George V which stood at its place. In 2016, &quot;Mid-Day&quot; reported that the George V statue is kept locked in a tin shed belonging to the Public Works Department, behind Elphinstone College, in Fort, Mumbai. The George V statue was sculpted by G. K. Mhatre, who has over 300 sculptures to his credit in India. Sandeep Dahisarkar, a historian, researcher, and academician, have made efforts to relocate the George V statue to a museum, the latter of whom has reasserted the statue as &quot;swadeshi&quot; art. 
The other statue in the locality of the gateway is that of Swami Vivekananda, an Indian monk who is credited as a key figure in the introduction of Indian philosophies such as Vedanta and Yoga to the west, and with bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century.

There are five jetties located around the monument. The first jetty is exclusive to the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, while the second and third are used for commercial ferry operations, the fourth one is closed, and the fifth is exclusive to the Royal Bombay Yacht Club. The second and third jetties are the starting point for tourists to reach the Elephanta Caves, which are fifty minutes away by boat from the monument. Other routes from the gateway include ferry rides to Rewas, Mandwa, and Alibaug, while cruises also operate from the gateway. These ferries reportedly carry an overload of daily passengers. The Mumbai Port Trust licenses vessels to use the gateway while the Maharashtra Maritime Board issues fitness certificates to them.

==Tourism and development==

The Gateway is amongst the prime tourist attractions in Mumbai. The Gateway is a protected monument in Maharashtra under the aegis of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). It is a regular gathering place for locals, street vendors, and photographers. In 2012, the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation moved the Elephanta Festival of Music and Dance from its original location at Elephanta Caves — where it had been celebrated for 23 years — to the Gateway, due to the increased capacity offered by the venue. The Gateway can host 2,000 to 2,500 people, whereas Elephanta Caves could host only 700 to 800.

By 2012, the Bombay Municipal Corporation increased the plaza area around the Gateway for pedestrians by restoring the area at a cost of 5 crores. It involved the cutting down of trees, reducing the garden area, replacing toilets, and closing the car park. The redevelopment led to a dispute between the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) and the Urban Design Research Institute, and the government was criticised for poor project implementation which critics alleged had failed to conform to the original plans.

In January 2014, Philips Lighting India, in association with the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation, undertook the expenditure of 2 crores to illuminate the gateway, by installing an LED lighting system with sixteen million shades. Philips used products from its Philips Color Kinetics and LED street lighting, and did not receive any branding for the illumination project in which 132 light points were created, which were reportedly sixty-percent more energy efficient than the old lighting system. In August 2014, the state Directorate of Archaeology and Museums had proposed conservation of the Gateway by the ASI, after noting deterioration caused by saline deposits from the sea. An estimate of costs was to be prepared and approved by the ASI. The last such conservation had been undertaken twenty years earlier. An independent study had earlier been conducted at the Gateway, between June 2001 and May 2002, aimed at informing future conservation of the monument understanding the degree of colour changes of stones owing to seasonal weather conditions and saturated colour of minerals. The study found the stones of the monument to appear darker during monsoon than during other seasons while the colour change in the inner portions of the monument rises with variations of seasonal humidity and temperature, given they do not face the sea, rainwater, or sunlight. It concluded with the finding that the alteration degree and overall colour change in the inner portions are higher than those in the outer portions of the monument.

In 2015, the Maharashtra Maritime Board and the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority approved a proposal to construct a passenger jetty near Apollo Bunder and a promenade between the Gateway and the Bombay Presidency Radio Club. The project was aimed at reducing crowding at the Gateway by closing all its jetties and refocusing the location solely as a tourist attraction.

The Gateway has interested companies and corporate houses such as the Tata Group, the RPG Group, and the JSW Group, who have expressed their wish to maintain the Gateway and enhance its facilities. This happened after the state government identified 371 heritage sites under its Maharashtra Vaibhav State Protected Monuments Adoption Scheme (MVSPMAS). Under this scheme, companies and corporates can adopt heritage monuments and give out funds for their maintenance, to satisfy their corporate social responsibility. The scheme also provides sponsors with the opportunity to generate revenue by selling their rights to feature the heritage monuments in commercials and advertisements. Other revenue-generating opportunities include the sale of entry tickets to the site and charging for the use of facilities.

In February 2019, the Maharashtra state government initiated a plan to restore, clean, and beautify the monument. A project plan was to be prepared in a month. The state governor, C. Vidyasagar Rao, directed the Bombay Municipal Corporation commissioner and architects to submit a project plan in a month on measures to be taken for the purpose. In the same month, chemical conservation was proposed by the state archaeology department noting blackening of and algae on stones and surface cracks. Structural stability audit had last been conducted eight years earlier with plant growth on the monument removed annually. In March 2019 the state government agreed on a four-stage plan to manage tourists visiting the site. This involved the physical conservation of the monument, the installation of a sound-and-light show, the relocation of the anchorage around the monument and a streamlined, ticketed entry system. The plan followed UNESCO guidance for protected heritage sites and took into account the views of interested parties, including the Directorate of Museums and Archaeology, which has the monument within its purview; the Mumbai Port Trust, which is entrusted with the land; and the Bombay Municipal Corporation, which controls the location. The task of coming up with a suitable management plan was delegated to architects.

==Events and incidents==

The Gateway was the location of a terror attack on 25 August 2003. The force of the explosion, from a bomb in a taxi parked near the Taj Mahal Hotel, reportedly threw bystanders into the sea. On 13 August 2005, a mentally unstable man stabbed two young girls from Manipur at the gateway premises. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, 2007 a woman was groped by a mob at the Gateway.

Following the November 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, which targeted the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel opposite to the Gateway, among other locations, crowds of people including news television reporters and cameramen congregated at the Gateway premises. Subsequently, public access to the area around was restricted. Fearing further attacks on the Gateway and on the Elephanta caves, the state government proposed the closure of all of the jetties at the Gateway and their replacement with two new piers, to be built near the Bombay Presidency Radio Club. In response to the terror attacks, a solidarity march was held at the Gateway premises on 3 December 2008.

In February 2019, protests were organized at the premises in the wake of the Pulwama attack. In January 2020, the Gateway became a site of spontaneous protests that commenced overnight, under the name of &quot;Occupy Gateway&quot;, in the aftermath of the attack on Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi. Protestors were later relocated from the Gateway premises to Azad Maidan in Mumbai to ease the movement of traffic and people.

==In the media==

The Mumbai-based video game &quot;Mumbai Gullies&quot; is expected to feature the Gateway of India in its fictional map.

Several films, such as &quot;Bhai-Bhai&quot; (1956), &quot;Gateway of India&quot; (1957), &quot;Shararat&quot; (1959), &quot;Hum Hindustani&quot; (1960), &quot;Mr. X in Bombay&quot; (1964), &quot;Sadhu Aur Shaitaan&quot; (1968), &quot;Aansoo Aur Muskan&quot; (1970), &quot;Andaz&quot; (1971), &quot;Chhoti Si Baat&quot; (1976) and &quot;Don&quot; (1978) have been shot at the Gateway of India.

<text>was an amusement park in the Shinsekai district of Naniwa, Osaka, Japan, just beside the Shin-Imamiya Station of the Osaka Loop Line of Nishinihon Japan Railway and Nankai Railway.

Originally the site of a train depot, the park opened in July 1997. The city of Osaka invested in the park, but the theme park was originally managed by a private company which went bankrupt in 2004, and has since been managed by the municipal government of Osaka. In 2007, the local authorities decided to put the property up for sale.

The park was demolished on 19 March 2012. In late 2014, a new building on the site opened containing a Maruhan entertainment center and a Mega Donki outlet.

<doc id="494807" wikidata="Q1025961" url="?curid=494807" title="Capital of Japan">
<text>The capital of Japan is Tokyo. Throughout history, the national capital of Japan has been in locations other than Tokyo. The oldest capital is Nara.

==Legal status==

While no laws have designated Tokyo as the Japanese capital, many laws have defined a that incorporates Tokyo. Article 2 of the of 1956 states: &quot;In this Act, the term &#x27;capital area&#x27; shall denote a broad region comprising both the territory of the Tokyo Metropolis as well as outlying regions designated by cabinet order.&quot; This implies that the government has designated Tokyo as the capital of Japan, although (again) it is not explicitly stated, and the definition of the &quot;capital area&quot; is purposely restricted to the terms of that specific law.

Other laws referring to the &quot;capital area&quot; include the , the , the , the , and the .

In February 2018, Seiji Osaka, a member of the House of Representatives, asked the government where the capital of Japan is. In response, Shinzo Abe stated that while no laws define the capital of Japan, they believed that &quot;the capital of Japan is Tokyo is widely accepted by the people&quot;.

==History==
Traditionally, the home of the Emperor is considered the capital. From 794 through 1868, the Emperor lived in Heian-kyō, modern-day Kyoto. After 1868, the seat of the Government of Japan and the location of the Emperor&#x27;s home was moved to Edo, which it renamed Tokyo. This term for capital was never used to refer to Kyoto. Indeed, &quot;shuto&quot; came into use during the 1860s as a gloss of the English term &quot;capital&quot;.

In 1941, the Ministry of Education published the . The Ministry of Education published a book called &quot;History of the Restoration&quot; in 1941. This book referred to without talking about . A contemporary history textbook states that the Meiji government &quot;moved the capital (&quot;shuto&quot;) from Kyoto to Tokyo&quot; without using the &quot;sento&quot; term.

The proposals to move the capital were conceptualized in 1979, and 16 years later, in 1995, the parliament voted to move the capital away from Tokyo to a place no more than 180 miles and 40 minutes away from the airport, which was planned to be completed in 2010. In 1999, the following sites were proposed: Tochigi and Fukushima prefectures, north of Tokyo; the second candidate is Gifu and Aichi prefectures, south of Tokyo; and the panel recommended the third region near the ancient capitals, Nara, Kyoto, and Shiga prefectures. These plans did not include moving the Imperial Palace, so they were not seen as moving the capital city but rather transferring the government functions. Ryutaro Hashimoto explicitly denied the possibility of moving the capital city (i.e. moving the Imperial Palace) in 1996. The plans for moving were not made later on.

As of 2007, there is a movement to transfer the government functions of the capital from Tokyo while retaining Tokyo as the &quot;de facto&quot; capital, with the Gifu-Aichi region, the Mie-Kio region and other regions submitting bids for a &quot;de jure&quot; capital. Officially, the relocation is referred to as &quot;capital &quot;functions&quot; relocation&quot; instead of &quot;capital relocation&quot;, or as &quot;relocation of the Diet and other organizations&quot;.

In 2023, the Government of Japan moved the Agency for Cultural Affairs to Kyoto. This was the first time that a central government office has been relocated outside Tokyo since Tokyo was designated as the capital.

<text>Berlin Cathedral (), also known as the Evangelical Supreme Parish and Collegiate Church, is a monumental German Protestant church and dynastic tomb (House of Hohenzollern) on the Museum Island in central Berlin. Having its origins as a castle chapel for the Berlin Palace, several structures have served to house the church since the 15th century. The present collegiate church was built from 1894 to 1905 by order of Emperor William II according to plans by Julius Raschdorff in Renaissance and Baroque Revival styles. The listed building is the largest Protestant church in Germany and one of the most important dynastic tombs in Europe. In addition to church services, the cathedral is used for state ceremonies, concerts and other events.

Since the demolition of the Memorial Church &quot;(Denkmalskirche)&quot; section on the north side by the East German authorities in 1975, Berlin Cathedral has consisted of the large Sermon Church &quot;(Predigerkirche)&quot; in the center, and the smaller Baptismal and Matrimonial Church &quot;(Tauf- und Traukirche)&quot; on the south side and the Hohenzollern crypt &quot;(Hohenzollerngruft)&quot;, which covers almost the entire basement. Damaged during the Allied bombing in World War II, the cathedral&#x27;s original interior was restored by 2002. Currently there is discussion about restoring the historical exterior as well.

==Term==
Berlin Cathedral () is the common name for the Supreme Parish and Collegiate Church () in Berlin, Germany.

The Dom is the parish church of the congregation &quot;Gemeinde der Oberpfarr- und Domkirche zu Berlin&quot;, a member of the umbrella organisation Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia. The term &quot;Dom&quot; denotes a collegiate church (equivalent to the Italian &quot;duomo&quot;, or the English &quot;Minster&quot;); however, as most cathedrals are also collegiate churches, the term &quot;Dom&quot; has become the common term for a cathedral in German, though they are not synonymous. Berlin Cathedral has never been a cathedral in the actual sense of that term since it has never been the seat of a bishop. The bishop of the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg (under this name 1945–2003) is based at St. Mary&#x27;s Church and Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in Berlin.

==History==
Berlin Cathedral has a long history starting as a Catholic place of worship in the 15th century.

===Establishment of a Collegiate Church in Berlin (1451–1536)===
The history of today&#x27;s &quot;Supreme Parish and Collegiate Church&quot; and its community dates back to 1451. In that year Prince-Elector Frederick II &quot;Irontooth&quot; of Brandenburg moved with his residence from Brandenburg upon Havel to Cölln (today&#x27;s Fishers&#x27; Island, the southern part of Museums Island) into the newly erected City Palace, which also housed a Catholic chapel. In 1454 Frederick Irontooth, after having returned – via Rome – from his pilgrimage to Jerusalem, elevated the chapel to become a parish church, richly endowing it with relics and altars. Pope Nicholas V ordered Stephan Bodecker, then Prince-Bishop of Brandenburg, to consecrate the chapel to Erasmus of Formiae.

On 7 April 1465 – at Frederick Irontooth&#x27;s request – Pope Paul II attributed to St Erasmus Chapel a canon-law College named &quot;Stift zu Ehren Unserer Lieben Frauen, des heiligen Kreuzes, St. Petri und Pauli, St. Erasmi und St. Nicolai&quot; dedicated to of Nazareth, the Holy Cross, Simon Peter, Paul of Tarsus, Erasmus of Formiae, and Nicholas of Myra. A collegiate church is a church endowed with revenues and earning estates, in order to provide a number of canons, called in canon law a College, with prebends. In this respect a collegiate church is similar to a cathedral, which is why in colloquial German the term &quot;cathedral college&quot; (Domstift), became the synecdoche used – pars pro toto – for all canon-law colleges. So the college of St. Erasmus&#x27; chapel, called &quot;Domstift&quot; in German, bestowed the pertaining church its colloquial naming, &quot;Domkirche&quot; (cathedral church). Frederick Irontooth provided the college with estates, sufficient to supply eight canon prebendaries. On 20 January 1469, Dietrich IV, then Prince-Bishop of Brandenburg, invested eight clergymen, chosen by Frederick Irontooth, as collegiate canons with the prebends.

===The Collegiate Church in the former Black Friars&#x27; Church of St. Paul&#x27;s south of the Palace (1536–1747)===
In 1535, Prince-Elector Joachim II Hector reached the consent of Pope Paul III to shut down the 1297-founded Dominican convent (Black Friars), southerly neighboured to the palace, to acquire the pertaining monastic &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s Church&quot;, built ca. in 1345. On 28 May 1536, most of the Black Friars moved to a Dominican monastery in Brandenburg upon Havel. Joachim II Hector assigned the thus void, three-nave church building to the Collegiate Church of Our Lady, the Holy Cross, the Ss. Peter, Paul, Erasmus and Nicholas and enlarged the College to 12 prebendaries, bestowing two of them to canons taken on from the Dominican convent. 
In 1538, a new western façade with two towers was attached to the collegiate church, which – due to its prior status as a church of a mendicant order – had no tower before. In the next year, Joachim II Hector converted from Catholicism to Lutheranism, as many of his subjects had done earlier. The &quot;collegiate church&quot; thus became Lutheran too, like most of the electoral subjects and all the churches in the Electorate. However, Joachim II Hector&#x27;s ideas of Reformation were different from the modern ones. After his conversion he enriched the collegiate church with luxuriant furnishings, such as paraments, monstrances, relics, chasubles, carpets and antependia. From 1545 on the electoral family of Hohenzollern used the church building as their burial place.

In 1608, the year of his accession to the throne, Prince-Elector John Sigismund, then a crypto-Calvinist, dissolved the college and the church was renamed into Supreme Parish Church of Holy Trinity in Cölln. In 1613, John Sigismund publicly confessed his Calvinist faith (in Germany usually called Reformed Church), but waived his privilege to demand the same of his subjects (Cuius regio, eius religio). So he and his family, except his steadfastly Lutheran wife Anna, converted, while most of his subjects remained Lutherans. While Berlin&#x27;s other churches, subject to Lutheran city-council jurisdiction, remained Lutheran, the &quot;Supreme Parish Church of Holy Trinity&quot;, the Hohenzollern&#x27;s house church, became Berlin&#x27;s first, and until 1695, only Calvinist church, serving from 1632 on as the parish for all Calvinists in town. Being now a Calvinist church, the patronage of the Holy Trinity was increasingly skipped.

In 1667, the dilapidated double-tower façade was torn down and in 1717 Martin Böhme erected a new Baroque façade with two towers. With the effect of 1 January 1710, Cölln was united with Berlin under the latter name. In 1747, the &quot;Supreme Parish Church&quot; was completely demolished to clear space for the baroque extension of Berlin Palace.

===The Supreme Parish Church in its new Building north of the Palace (1750–1893)===
On 6 September 1750, the new baroque Calvinist &quot;Supreme Parish Church&quot; was inaugurated, built by Johann Boumann &quot;the Elder&quot; in 1747–1750. The electoral tombs were transferred to the new building. The new structure covered a space north of the palace, which is still covered by the present building.
In 1817, under the auspices of King Frederick William III of Prussia, the community of the &quot;Supreme Parish Church&quot;, like most Prussian Calvinist and Lutheran congregations joined the common umbrella organization named Evangelical Church in Prussia (under this name since 1821), with each congregation maintaining its former denomination or adopting the new united denomination. The community of the &quot;Supreme Parish Church&quot; adopted the new denomination of the Prussian Union. Today&#x27;s presbytery of the congregation bears the unusual name in , literally &quot;Cathedral College&quot;, thus recalling the history of the church as a collegiate church.

In celebration of the Union Karl Friedrich Schinkel remodeled the interior in the same year and in 1820–1822 the exterior of Boumann&#x27;s church in the neoclassicist style. The &quot;Supreme Parish and Cathedral Church&quot; faced at its southern façade Berlin City Palace, the residence of the Hohenzollerns (severely damaged in World War II and demolished later by the East German government), and the Lustgarten park at its western front, which is still there.

===Modern Berlin Cathedral (1893–present)===

However, in the 19th century, a new building was under discussion, but the post-Napoleonic poverty made its realization impossible. After dismantling the movable interior (altar, paintings, sarcophagi), Boumann&#x27;s building was demolished in 1893 and Julius and , father and son, built the present &quot;Supreme Parish and Cathedral Church&quot; in exuberant forms of high Neo-Renaissance style.

With no separation of Protestant church and state of Prussia, Wilhelm II officiated as the &quot;summus episcopus&quot; (Supreme Governor of the Evangelical State Church of Prussia&#x27;s older Provinces, as it was named since 1875) and the state paid the complete construction cost of 11.5 million Marks. At long, wide and tall, it was much larger than any of the previous buildings and was considered a Protestant counterweight to St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Vatican City. On 27 February 1905, the present building was inaugurated.

In 1940, the blast waves of Allied bombing blew away part of the windows. On 24 May 1944, a bomb of combustible liquids entered the roof lantern of the dome. The fire could not be extinguished at that unreachable section of the dome. So the lantern burnt and collapsed into the main floor. Between 1949 and 1953, a temporary roof was built to enclose the building. On 9 May 1967 the then still undivided Evangelical Church of the Union decided a committee for the reconstruction of the &quot;Supreme Parish and Cathedral Church&quot;, then located in East Berlin. The government of the Eastern German Democratic Republic did not oppose the work of the committee due to the concomitant inflow of Deutsche Marks.
In 1975, reconstruction started, simplifying the building&#x27;s original design and demolishing the north wing, the &#x27;Denkmalskirche&#x27; – Memorial Church. Compared by some to the Medici Chapel, it had survived the war completely intact but was demolished for ideological reasons by the communist government due to it being a hall of honour for the Hohenzollern dynasty. This resulted in scaffolding for restoration appearing on the church while detonation charges were applied to its undamaged rear. The government also demanded the removal of as many crosses as possible. The demolition and redesign cost 800,000 marks, while the restoration (done on the cheap) cost just 50,000 marks. The Berlin Cathedral Building Society now seek to rebuild the Denkmalskirche.

In 1980, the baptistery and wedding church reopened for services. The restoration of the nave began in 1984. On 6 June 1993, the nave was re-inaugurated in an event attended by Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl and televised nationwide in Germany. There has been discussion to restore the dome and surrounding cupolas to their original appearance, but this has not occurred due to a lack of funds.

== Music ==
=== Main organ ===
The pipe organ, built by Wilhelm Sauer, was fully restored during reconstruction. It has 113 stops, including three ranks of 32&#x27; pipes on the pedal division, played by a 4-manual console:
* II/I, III/I, IV/I, Super I, III/II, IV/II, Super II, IV/III, I/P, II/P, III/P, IV/P
* 3 Freie Kombinationen, Mezzoforte, Forte, Tutti, Rohrwerke, Jalousieschweller III. Manual, Jalousieschweller IV. Manual, Jalousieschweller Vox humana, Handregister ab, Rückpositiv ab.
=== Ensembles ===
Contributing to the cathedral&#x27;s comprehensive concert programme is their own set of choirs (Berliner Domkantorei) and a brass ensemble (Berliner Dombläser). Berlin Cathedral is also the main place of activity for the renowned boys&#x27; choir Staats- und Domchor Berlin, an institution of the Berlin University of the Arts. Since Advent 2015, The English Choir Berlin, a multinational SATB adult choir, sings Choral Evensong (Domvesper in anglikanisher Tradition) monthly on a Saturday evening and, from time to time sings at Sunday morning divine services.

<text>Dave Baksh (born July 26, 1980) also known by his stage name Dave Brownsound, is a Canadian musician, singer and songwriter best known as the lead guitarist of rock band Sum 41. Baksh quit Sum 41 in 2006 (not counting a guest appearance on stage in 2008) to pursue his own career in his heavy metal/reggae project Brown Brigade. He rejoined Sum 41 in 2015 and has released three subsequent studio albums with the band. He also played guitar for Organ Thieves, with two of his fellow Brown Brigade members and currently plays with the Canadian deathpunk four-piece Black Cat Attack. In 2019, Baksh co-founded the merchandise company Loud &amp; Immortal. He joined Canadian hardcore punk band Comeback Kid in 2025.

== Early and personal life ==
Baksh grew up in Ajax, Ontario to an Indo-Canadian family of Indo-Guyanese origins. Baksh learned to play guitar alongside his cousin. He went to school with fellow Sum 41 bandmates Deryck Whibley, Jason McCaslin, and former drummer Steve Jocz. Baksh attended Exeter High School and was in the graduating class of 1998. He is a fan of English Premier League club Newcastle United.

== Career ==
=== Sum 41 (1998–2006; 2015–present) ===
Baksh joined Sum 41 as the third member in 1997, after Deryck Whibley and Steve Jocz formed the band in the summer of 1996. In addition to being the lead guitarist, Baksh also provided backing vocals. Baksh also goes by the names &quot;Dave Brownsound&quot; and &quot;Hot Chocolate&quot;, playing off of his Indian heritage and brown sound, the name Eddie Van Halen coined for his own guitar tone. He has stated his favorite Sum 41 songs are &quot;Mr. Amsterdam,&quot; &quot;Machine Gun,&quot; &quot;Pain for Pleasure,&quot; and &quot;The Bitter End&quot;, and his least favorite to play with the band is &quot;Pieces&quot;. Baksh went by the name Pleasure in Sum 41&#x27;s alter-ego heavy metal band Pain For Pleasure, where the members of Sum 41 would parody a 1980s metal band. He played lead guitar on the band&#x27;s debut EP titled &quot;Half Hour of Power&quot; (2000), and on the albums &quot;All Killer No Filler&quot; (2001), &quot;Does This Look Infected?&quot; (2002), and &quot;Chuck&quot; (2004), before leaving the band in 2006.

On July 23, 2015, Sum 41 played their comeback show at the Alternative Press Music Awards, which featured rapper DMC, and Baksh himself as guests. On August 14, 2015, after rumors and speculation, it was announced that Baksh had officially returned to Sum 41, and would appear on the band&#x27;s sixth studio album. The resulting album &quot;13 Voices&quot; was released on October 7, 2016. He remained in the band for their next two albums, &quot;Order in Decline&quot; (2019), and their final album, &quot;Heaven :x: Hell&quot; (2024).

During an interview with &quot;Loudwire&quot; in 2019, Baksh confirmed that he regretted leaving the band after hearing their fifth album, &quot;Screaming Bloody Murder&quot; (2011).

=== Brown Brigade (2006–2008) ===
On May 11, 2006, Baksh announced in a statement through his management company that he was leaving Sum 41 for personal reasons. He explained that he could not keep trying to express himself through guitar skills without being a pain to the band. During the post-&quot;Chuck&quot; hiatus, he decided it was time to move on from Sum 41 and to focus on his side project Brown Brigade, his new band that he founded with his cousin Vaughn Lal and with which he currently plays lead guitar.

Brown Brigade&#x27;s debut album &quot;Into the Mouth of Badd(d)ness&quot; was released September 18, 2007, in Canada and Japan only and became critically successful, even though it was not released widely in the US and have not brought the band any outside attention, the band still continues to tour Canada in support of the album.

Baksh stated that the band is currently working on new and experimental songs to be released for free on the band&#x27;s website. The new songs, unlike the band&#x27;s traditional music, would feature varied music such as punk rock, funk and reggae and not metal like the debut album.

In a show that took place on March 27, 2008, in Toronto, Ontario, Baksh joined Sum 41 to play &quot;Pain for Pleasure&quot; at the end of the show. Some thought this was a hint of him returning to the band, however, Deryck Whibley said that Baksh&#x27;s appearance was a one-off cameo and that he would continue with Brown Brigade.

On September 12, 2008, Baksh announced on the Brown Brigade&#x27;s Myspace page that he would quit singing for the band, but would remain as the lead guitarist. The band was looking for a new lead singer to work on new material. On November 27, 2009, Baksh announced that due to his cousin Vaughn Lal&#x27;s involvement in his business, they intended to keep Brown Brigade strictly a studio act, releasing single songs and collaborating in the studio with many different artists, with a small chance of playing live. Baksh&#x27;s main focus will be Organ Thieves and Vaughn&#x27;s main focus will be his new business.

=== Organ Thieves (2008–2015) ===
In mid-2008, Baksh started recording and producing his fellow Brown Brigade member Chuck Coles&#x27; new project Organ Thieves. By November 2008, Coles had asked Baksh to join the band for a few live shows, resulting in Baksh joining as a full-time member. He recorded the band&#x27;s first EP &quot;God&#x27;s Favorite Sons&quot; in January 2009. The EP was released for free on the band&#x27;s Myspace page and was later released into physical copies in March 2009. On the same month, Baksh also joined Canadian hardcore punk outfit Blackjacket for a short UK tour.

In October 2009, Organ Thieves began pre-production for their first full-length studio album, with former longtime Sum 41 producer/manager Greig Nori. Organ Thieves has since become Baksh&#x27;s main focus as he intends to keep Brown Brigade strictly a studio act.

On April 24, 2012, their first full-length studio album, &quot;Somewhere Between Free Men and Slaves&quot;, was released through MapleMusic Recordings.

== Equipment ==
He recently only plays a Duesenberg Dave Baksh Alliance guitar live on stage, which he co-designed with Duesenberg. He uses Dean Markley and Ernie Ball strings. For his pedals, he uses MXR Effects, a Digitech Whammy, and Dunlop wah Pedals. He uses Marshall Amplification.

<doc id="494833" wikidata="Q1753820" url="?curid=494833" title="The Soul Sessions">
<text>The Soul Sessions is the debut studio album by English singer and songwriter Joss Stone, released on 16 September 2003 by S-Curve Records. The album consists of cover versions of soul songs from the 1960s and 1970s, in addition to a cover of the White Stripes&#x27; 2001 song &quot;Fell in Love with a Girl&quot; (renamed &quot;Fell in Love with a Boy&quot;). In 2004, &quot;The Soul Sessions&quot; was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize and was nominated for a MOBO Award for Best Album.

==Background==
&quot;The Soul Sessions&quot; was produced by Miami soul singer Betty Wright and S-Curve Records chief executive officer Steve Greenberg. Stone worked with veteran Miami soul musicians Benny Latimore, Little Beaver, Timmy Thomas and Wright herself. She also worked with contemporary musicians such as neo soul singer Angie Stone and the alternative hip hop group the Roots.

Stone told MTV News that she felt intimidated by the credentials of the musicians that worked on the album. &quot;It was weird because they&#x27;ve worked with so many great, great singers. I&#x27;m talking the best. I kind of walked in, just like this little girl and started singing.&quot;

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Soul Sessions&quot; received positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 74, based on 15 reviews. Jon Caramanica of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated that &quot;Stone shines on this impressive covers set&quot; and that &quot;[s]he chooses songs wisely.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Thom Jurek wrote that Stone &quot;has unique phrasing and a huge voice that accents, dips, and slips, never overworking a song or trying to bring attention to itself via hollow acrobatics.&quot; Jim Greer from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted that Stone &quot;does have an extraordinary voice&quot;, but added that &quot;the only misguided ploy on &quot;The Soul Sessions&quot; is a Roots-produced slo-mo cover of a White Stripes tune.&quot; Russell Baillie from &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; opined that &quot;with her strong, emotive voice she nails it time and again, and with performances that aren&#x27;t an excuse for the vocal acrobatic show you imagine this would have been had Stone been America&#x27;s next bright young thing.&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Dorian Lynskey described her singing as &quot;rich, mature and agile but not showy&quot;. Nick Duerden of &quot;Blender&quot; magazine commented that &quot;Stone&#x27;s voice is remarkably authentic, and the atmosphere she conjures is smoky and sleazy, pure mid-&#x27;60s Detroit.&quot; Jason MacNeil wrote for PopMatters that her voice is &quot;more of a soulful voice than those so-called soul divas out there today&quot; and that it &quot;oozes sex appeal as Benny Latimore&#x27;s piano weaves some magic.&quot; At &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Keith Phipps remarked that &quot;&quot;Sessions&quot; establishes Stone as a formidable interpreter.&quot; Andrew McGregor of BBC Music felt that the album &quot;seems a bit of an artistic compromise, music from the rule book rather than the heart.&quot; Similarly, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau viewed Stone&#x27;s covers as &quot;the kind of soul marginalia Brits have been overrating since Doris Troy was on Apple&quot;.

==Commercial performance==

&quot;The Soul Sessions&quot; entered the UK Albums Chart at number 89 for the week ending 10 January 2004, peaking at number four in its fifth week on the chart. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified the album triple platinum on 15 April 2005, and by July 2012, it had sold 1,075,492 copies in the United Kingdom. Additionally, it became the 16th best-selling album of 2004 in the UK.

In the United States, &quot;The Soul Sessions&quot; was a sleeper hit. On the issue dated 4 October 2003, the album debuted at number 199 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and at number 76 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, peaking at number 39 on the former and at number 38 on the latter in its 24th week on both charts, on the issue dated 8 May 2004. Prior to that, the album topped the Top Heatseekers chart during the week of 21 February 2004. Sales were high on the East Coast, especially in cities such as New York City, Philadelphia and Boston. Within six months of its release, &quot;The Soul Sessions&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 29 March 2004. The album had sold 981,000 units in the US as of July 2011.

The album was also commercially successful in the rest of Europe, where it reached number four in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Norway, number five in Portugal, number seven in Belgium, number eight in Italy, number 12 in Sweden and number 14 in Switzerland, as well as number four on the European Top 100 Albums. In June 2004, &quot;The Soul Sessions&quot; was awarded a Platinum Europe Award by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) for sales in excess of one million copies across Europe. In Oceania, the album peaked at number 16 in Australia and number eight in New Zealand, earning platinum accreditations from the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) for sales in excess of 70,000 and 15,000 copies, respectively. &quot;The Soul Sessions&quot; had sold five million copies worldwide as of June 2012.

<text>At the top level of administration, Belarus is divided into six regions and one capital city. The six regions are oblasts (also known as &quot;voblastsi&quot;), while the city of Minsk has a special status as the capital of Belarus. Minsk also serves as the administrative center of Minsk Region.

At the second level, the regions are divided into districts (raions).

The layout and extent of the regions were set in 1960 when Belarus (then the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic) was a constituent republic of the Soviet Union.

== History ==
At the start of the 20th century, the boundaries of the Belarusian lands within the Russian Empire were still being defined. In 1900 it was contained within all of the Minsk and Mogilev governorates, most of Grodno Governorate, parts of Vitebsk Governorate, and parts of Vilna Governorate. World War I, the independence of Poland, as well as the 1920–1921 Polish–Soviet War affected the boundaries. In 1921, Belarus had what is now all of Minsk Governorate except for the western fringe, the western part of Gomel Region, a western slice of Mogilev, and a small part of Vitebsk Region. In 1926, the eastern part of Gomel region was added. 
In the Byelorussian SSR, new administrative units, called &quot;oblasts&quot; or &quot;voblastsi&quot; (cognate of Russian word &quot;oblast&quot; with prothetic v-) were introduced in 1938. During World War II, Belarus gained territory to the west, with the Baranavichy, Belastok (Białystok), Brest, Pinsk, and Vileyka oblasts. In 1944, Belastok was eliminated and the new oblasts of Babruysk, Grodno, and Polotsk were created. At that same time, Vileika oblast was renamed Molodechno Oblast.

At different times between 1938 and 1960, the following &quot;oblasts&quot; existed:

* Babruysk Oblast, created 1944, eliminated 1954
* Baranavichy Oblast, created 1939, eliminated 1954
* Belastok Oblast, created 1939, eliminated 1944 (now Białystok in Poland)
* Brest Region, created 1939
* Gomel Oblast, created 1938
* Grodno Oblast, created 1944
* Maladzyechna Oblast renamed from Vileyka Oblast 1944, eliminated 1960
* Mogilev Oblast, created 1938
* Minsk Oblast, created 1938
* Navahrudak Oblast, created 1939, renamed Baranavichy Oblast December 1939
* Pinsk Oblast, created 1939, eliminated 1954
* Polatsk Oblast, created 1944, eliminated 1954
* Polesia Oblast, created 1938, eliminated 1954
* Vitebsk Oblast, created 1938
* Vileyka Oblast, created 1939, renamed to Maladzyechna Oblast 1944

<doc id="494839" wikidata="Q1317521" url="?curid=494839" title="Japanese dolls">
<text>are one of the traditional Japanese crafts.

There are various types of traditional dolls, some representing children and babies, some the imperial court, warriors and heroes, fairy-tale characters, gods and (rarely) demons, and also people of the daily life of Japanese cities. Many have a long tradition and are still made today for household shrines, formal gift-giving, or for festival celebrations such as , the doll festival, or , Children&#x27;s Day. Some are manufactured as a local craft, to be purchased by pilgrims as a souvenir of a temple visit or some other trip.

== History == 

There may be a continuity in the making of the , humanoid figures, by the ancient Jōmon culture in Japan (8000–200 BC), which were associated with fertility or shamanistic rites, at a time when dolls were thought to have souls. Dolls also have continuity from the funerary figures of the subsequent Kofun culture (around 300–600 AD). Expert Alan Pate notes that temple records refer to the making of a grass doll to be blessed and thrown into the river at Ise Shrine in 3 BC; the custom was probably even more ancient, but it is at the root of the modern doll festival, or .

In the early 11th century, around the peak of the Heian period, several types of dolls had already been defined, as known from Lady Murasaki&#x27;s novel &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;. Girls played with dolls and doll houses; women made protective dolls for their children or grandchildren; dolls were used in religious ceremonies, taking on the sins of a person whom they had touched. At that time, it was thought that evil could be ritualistically transferred to a paper image called a , which were then cast to the river or sea; Japanese dolls today may be the result of the combination of and paper dolls children once played with. , though not explicitly mentioned in &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;, were soft-bodied dolls given to young women of age and especially to pregnant women to protect both mother and unborn child. Sources mentioning them by name start appearing in the Heian period, but are more apparent in the Muromachi period.

 are roly-poly toys made from papier-mâché, dating back to at least the 14th century. They are good-luck charms and symbols of perseverance and resilience.

Probably the first professional dollmakers were temple sculptors, who used their skill to make painted wooden images of children (Saga dolls). The possibilities of this art form, using carved wood or wood composition, a shining white &quot;skin&quot; lacquer called made from ground oystershell and glue, and textiles, were vast.

During the Edo period (1603–1867), when Japan was closed to most trade, there developed both fine dollmakers and a market of wealthy individuals who would pay for the most beautiful doll sets for display in their homes or as valuable gifts. Sets of dolls came to include larger and more elaborate figures, and more of them. The competitive trade was eventually regulated by government, meaning that doll makers could be arrested or banished for breaking laws on materials and height.

==Annual doll festival==

Homes and shops put up traditionally-clothed dolls of various sizes, set on a red dais, around 3rd March for the festival of . These feature the emperor and empress, attended by a court retinue: warriors, ministers and so on. Full versions include 15 dolls and apparatus such as utensils for . The most elaborate sets can fetch many millions of yen (tens of thousands of US$). The Doll Festival is celebrated to ensure girls&#x27; future happiness, and this link to daughters is rooted in the use of dolls in children&#x27;s play. However, the Doll Festival itself has been part of Japanese culture only since the Edo period.

== Types ==
It was during the Edo period that most of the traditional doll types known today developed.

* dolls are the dolls for , the doll festival on March 3. They can be made of many materials, but the classic doll has a pyramidal body of elaborate, many-layered textiles stuffed with straw and/or wood blocks, carved wood hands (and in some cases feet) covered with , and a head of carved wood or composite molded wood covered with , with set-in glass eyes (though before about 1850, the eyes were carved into the and painted), and human or silk hair. A full set comprises at least 15 dolls, representing specific characters, with many accessories (), though the basic set is a male-female pair, often referred to as the Emperor and Empress.
* dolls are offered to Japanese children during the holiday, in order to inspire in them the bravery and strength of the legendary Kintarō.
* , or warrior dolls, are usually made of materials similar to the dolls, but the construction is often more complicated, since the dolls represent men (or women) seated on camp chairs, standing, or riding horses. Armor, helmets, and weapons are made of lacquered paper, often with metal accents. There is no specified &quot;set&quot; of such dolls; subjects include Emperor Jimmu, Empress Jingū with her prime minister Takenouchi holding her newborn imperial son, Shoki the Demon-Queller, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and his generals and tea-master, and fairy-tale figures such as Momotarō the Peach Boy or Kintarō the Golden Boy.
* dolls show fat, cute babies in a simplified form. The basic is an almost-naked sitting boy, carved all in one piece, with very white skin, though with elaborate clothing, hairstyle, and accessories, female as well as male, became popular as well. They developed as a gifts associated with the Imperial court, and could be translated &quot;palace&quot; or &quot;court&quot;.
* dolls () are made of wood. The ancestors of dolls are (&quot;willow-wood&quot;) dolls, small dolls carved of willow and decorated with cloth scraps. refers to a method of making dolls. They start with a carved and/or molded base of wood, wood composite, or (in some modern dolls) plastic foam. A design of different patterned cloth scraps is planned out, and the base is grooved so that the edges of the cloth can be hidden in the grooves. The cloth is glued on and the edges tucked in. The head and hands (if any) of the doll are usually finished with ; the hair may be part of the molded head or be a separate wig. These dolls have become a very popular craft and kits with finished heads can be purchased. The method is also used by some of Japan&#x27;s avant-garde dollmakers, who adapt the old materials to new visions.
* , puppets or dolls are mechanical; they include the large figures on festival floats, for festivals like Kyoto&#x27;s Gion Matsuri and smaller entertaining scenes, often with a musical element accompanying the movement. They often depict legendary heroes.
* is a form of theatrical puppet theatre which rivalled and inspired the kabuki theater, and survives today.
* dolls have been made for 150 years, and are from Northern Honshū, the main island of Japan. They were originally made as toys for children of farmers. They have no arms or legs, but a large head and cylindrical body, representing little girls. From a simple toy, it has now become a famous Japanese craft, and now an established souvenir for tourists.
* are life-sized lifelike dolls, that were popular in shows. Artists made that were novel not just for their subjects that shocked viewers—figures lying in pools of their own blood, for example—but for their influence on Japanese dolls. The works of Matsumoto Kisaburō and Yasumoto Kamehachi, in particular, contributed to form an extreme sense of realism.
* dolls () represent little girls or boys, correctly proportioned and usually with flesh-colored skin and glass eyes. The original were named after an 18th-century kabuki actor, and must have represented an adult man, but since the late 19th century the term has applied to child dolls, usually made to hold in the arms, dress, and pose (either with elaborately made joints or with floppy cloth upper arms and thighs). Baby boy dolls with mischievous expressions were most popular in the late 19th and early 20th century, but in 1927 the friendship doll exchange involved the creation of 58 dolls representing little girls, to be sent as a gift from Japan to the United States, and the aesthetic of these dolls influenced dollmakers to emulate this type of a solemn, gentle-looking little girl in elaborate kimono.
* are spherical dolls with red bodies and white faces without pupils. They represent Bodhidharma, an East Indian who founded Zen about 1500 years ago; according to legend, he removed his own eyelids to prevent sleep from breaking his concentration, and his limbs withered after prolonged meditation. dolls are charms to bring good fortune, continued prosperity, and fortitude to accomplish goals. Usually dolls are purchased with blank eyes. One eye is filled when making a wish, the other when the wish is fulfilled. Wishes can be made throughout the year, but it is common in Japan to do it on New Year&#x27;s Day.
* (&quot;shine-shine monk&quot;) are strictly speaking not a type of doll. They are handmade of white paper or cloth, and hung from a window by a string to bring good weather and prevent rain.
* dolls (&quot;crawling child&quot;) are a soft-bodied doll given to young women of age and especially to pregnant women in Japan as a talisman to protect both mother and unborn child.

With the end of the Edo period and the advent of the modern Meiji era in the late 1800s, the art of doll-making changed as well:

* Silk-skinned or &quot;mask-face&quot; dolls became a popular craft in Japan in the 1920s and 1930s, allowing the individual to design elaborate kimono for dolls representing women of various periods of Japanese history, particularly the Edo period. Dolls of this type continued to be made and were a popular item for servicemen and tourists to bring back after World War II, though they also might choose dolls representing similar subjects made with faces.
* Bisque dolls are made of fired clay. Fukuoka is a traditional center of the manufacture of bisque dolls, and are famous throughout Japan.
* and (literally &quot;big sister dolls&quot; and &quot;bookmark dolls,&quot; respectively) are made of washi paper. tend to be three-dimensional, whereas are flat. often have elaborate hairstyles and costumes made of high-quality washi paper. They often lack facial features. Those from Shimane Prefecture are especially famous.
** A hybrid of and , called , has become popular in recent years. are a type of Japanese paper dolls made with figures and scenes and are mounted on , a rectangular fancy cardboard about a square foot (about a tenth of a square meter) in size.
* More recent and less traditional Japanese dolls are ball-jointed dolls (BJDs), whose growth in popularity has spread to the US and other countries since the advent of the Super Dollfie, first made by Volks in 1999. BJDs can be very realistic-looking or based more on the anime aesthetic. They are made of polyurethane resin which makes them very durable. These dolls are highly customizable in that owners can sand them, change out their wig and eye colors, and even change their face paint. Because of this hands-on aspect of customization, they are not only popular with collectors, but also with hobbyists.

==Collectors==

Japanese dolls are broken down into several subcategories. Two of the most prominent are Girl&#x27;s Day, , and the Boy&#x27;s Day , or display dolls, , , and . Collections can be categorized by the material they are made of such as wood dolls ( and ) and clay forms such as , , and .

In the 19th century, were introduced to the West. Doll collecting has since become a popular pastime in the West. Famous well known collectors from the West include individuals such as James Tissot (1836–1902), Jules Adeline (1845–1909), Eloise Thomas (1907–1982), and Samuel Pryor (1898–1985). James Tissot was known to be a religious history painter. In 1862, after attending a London Exhibition, he was drawn to Japanese art. During the 1860s, Tissot was known as one of the most important collectors of Japanese art in Paris. His collections included -style kimono, paintings, bronze, ceramics, screens and a number of (dolls from the late Edo period). Adeline was known as a working artist and he is also known as &quot;Mikika&quot;. Adeline produced many works throughout his career as a working artist. He is best known for his etchings and received the Cross of the Legion of Honor for his Vieux-Roven &quot;Le Parvis Notre-Dame&quot;. Unlike Tissot, Adeline is recognized as a true collector. A majority of Adeline&#x27;s collection consisted of , and only a few prints.

During the Meiji period, three men became pioneers in collecting : Shimizu Seifū (1851–1913), Nishizawa Senko (1864–1914), and Tsuboi Shōgorō (1863–1913). The three men are referred to as (&quot;the three great toy collectors&quot;). They introduced a systematic approach to collecting in an effort to preserve and document the various forms of . Shimizu, an artist and calligrapher, put his artistic ability to use by creating an illustrated catalog of his own collection of 440 dolls. The catalog was published in 1891, under the title . Nishizawa, a banker, gathered a significant collection on . He was an active researcher, collector of stories, documents, and information relating to the development of during the Edo period. Nishizawa&#x27;s son Tekiho (1889–1965) inherited his collection, but a great portion of the collection was lost in the Kanto earthquake of 1923. Tsuboi, founder of the Tokyo Anthropological Society, was the most trained of the three, and he brought a scientific element to the collecting of .

Dolls have been a part of Japanese Culture for many years, and the phenomenon of collecting them is still practiced. Many collections are preserved in museums, including the Peabody Essex Museum, Kyoto National Museum, and the Yodoko Guest House.

<text>Recreational diving or sport diving is diving for the purpose of leisure and enjoyment, usually when using scuba equipment. The term &quot;recreational diving&quot; may also be used in contradistinction to &quot;technical diving&quot;, a more demanding aspect of recreational diving which requires more training and experience to develop the competence to reliably manage more complex equipment in the more hazardous conditions associated with the disciplines. Breath-hold diving for recreation also fits into the broader scope of the term, but this article covers the commonly used meaning of &quot;scuba diving for recreational purposes, where the diver is not constrained from making a direct near-vertical ascent to the surface at any point during the dive&quot;, and risk is considered low.

The equipment used for recreational diving is mostly open circuit scuba, though semi closed and fully automated electronic closed circuit rebreathers may be included in the scope of recreational diving. Risk is managed by training the diver in a range of standardised procedures and skills appropriate to the equipment the diver chooses to use and the environment in which the diver plans to dive. Further experience and development of skills by practice will improve the diver&#x27;s ability to dive safely. Specialty training is made available by the recreational diver training industry and diving clubs to increase the range of environments and venues the diver can enjoy at an acceptable level of risk.

Reasons to dive and preferred diving activities may vary during the personal development of a recreational diver, and may depend on their psychological profile and their level of dedication to the activity. Most divers average less than eight dives per year, but some total several thousand dives over a few decades and continue diving into their 60s and 70s, occasionally older. Recreational divers may frequent local dive sites or dive as tourists at more distant venues known for desirable underwater environments. An economically significant diving tourism industry services recreational divers, providing equipment, training and diving experiences, generally by specialist providers known as dive centers, dive schools, live-aboard, day charter and basic dive boats.

Legal constraints on recreational diving vary considerably across jurisdictions. Recreational diving may be industry regulated or regulated by law to some extent. The legal responsibility for recreational diving service providers is usually limited as far as possible by waivers which they require the customer to sign before engaging in any diving activity. The extent of responsibility of recreational buddy divers is unclear, but buddy diving is generally recommended by recreational diver training agencies as safer than solo diving, and some service providers insist that customers dive in buddy pairs. The evidence supporting this policy is inconclusive: it may or may not reduce average risk to the clients by imposing a burden on some to the advantage of others, and may reduce liability risk for the service provider.

==Scope==

Recreational diving may be considered to be any underwater diving that is not occupational, professional, or commercial, in that the dive is fundamentally at the discretion of the diver, who dives either to their own plan, or to a plan developed in consensus with the other divers in the group, though dives led by a professional dive leader or instructor for non-occupational purposes are also legally classified as recreational dives in some legislations.

The full scope of recreational diving includes breath-hold diving and surface supplied diving – particularly with lightweight semi-autonomous airline systems such as snuba – and technical diving (including penetration diving), as all of these are frequently done for recreational purposes, but common usage is mostly for open water scuba diving with limited decompression.

Scuba diving implies the use of an autonomous breathing gas supply carried by the diver, the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus which provides the name for this mode of diving. Scuba may be the simpler and more popular open circuit configuration or one of the more complex and expensive closed or semi-closed rebreather arrangements. Rebreathers used for recreational diving are generally designed to require a minimum task loading on the diver and as far as possible to fail safe and give the diver ample warning to bail out to open circuit and abort the dive.

Open water is the definitive environment for recreational diving, and in this context implies that there is no physical or physiological barrier to the diver concluding the dive at any time by a direct ascent to the surface, either vertically, or via a clearly visible route adequately illuminated by ambient light. Some organisations extend the scope of recreational diving to allow short decompression obligations which can be done without gas switching. Depth limitations are imposed by the certification agencies, and relate to the competency associated with the specific certification. Entry level divers may be restricted to a depth of , and more advanced divers to 30, 40, 50 or 60 m depending on the certification and agency. Junior divers may be restricted to shallower depths generally confined to a depth of 12 metres (40 ft).

Recreational diving is generally limited to the use of air or a single nitrox mixture with an oxygen fraction not exceeding 40% for the planned dive, but this does not preclude constant oxygen partial pressure nitrox provided by electronically controlled closed circuit rebreathers like the Poseidon Mk6 or variable nitrox mixtures such as provided by the earlier semi-closed circuit Dräger Ray rebreather. Emergency gas supplies are either by sharing with a dive buddy or from a bailout cylinder for open circuit diving, and by bailout to open circuit for rebreather diving.

Most recreational diving officially applies the buddy system, but in reality there are a significant proportion of dives which are either effectively solo dives or where larger groups of nominally paired divers follow a dive leader and may be escorted by another dive leader.

==Reasons to dive==

The reasons to dive for recreational purposes are many and varied, and many divers will go through stages when their personal reasons for diving change, as the initial novelty of the alien environment becomes familiar and skills develop to the point where the diver is able to pay more attention to the surroundings.

Many people start diving for the adventure of experiencing a different environment and the ability to maneuver fairly freely in three dimensions, but the novelty wears off after a while. This may be replaced by the satisfaction of developing the skills to operate in a wider range of environments, and developing excellence in those skills, the addition of compatible interests and activities to complement the basic activity, like underwater photography and an interest in the details of the environment, including exploration and study and recording of aspects of the environment. Experience of the underwater environment varies depending on where the diver has access to suitable sites - there is more to see on a coastal reef than in most freshwater lakes, and scuba diving tourism can make a wide variety of more entertaining and challenging sites available. Exploration can also extend beyond tourism to the search for previously unvisited sites and the satisfaction of being the first to be there and in some cases, tell the story.

Reasons to dive include:
*Tourism and sight-seeing, including visiting a variety of places with different things to see.
*Extreme sport aspect: some divers wish to explore their personal limits and abilities under challenging conditions. This includes some competitive underwater sports, and environmental and physiological challenges.
*Naturalist and underwater life observers. This may be combined with recording the environment and contributing to citizen science databases. 
*Exploration: the underwater environment is relatively unexplored, it is not difficult to find places where no-one has gone before or if they have, no-one has recorded the fact or described or surveyed the site, even quite close to heavily populated areas. The marine ecosystems are largely undescribed, and there are many undiscovered species yet to be found and described. There are shipwrecks and flooded caves to challenge the adventurous and foolhardy.
*Stress management: recreational diving in reasonably good conditions which are comfortably managed by the diver can produce health benefits of mood improvement.

== Activities ==
There are many recreational diving activities, and equipment and environmental specialties which require skills additional to those provided by the entry level courses, These skills were originally developed by trial and error, but training programmes are offered by most diver training agencies for the convenience of the diver, and profit for the agency, or in the case of club oriented systems, for the overall benefit of the club community:

Activities:
* Snorkeling – Swimming at the surface with a diving mask and snorkel to view the shallow underwater environment.
* Free-diving (also called skin diving) – Swimming below the surface on breath-hold.
* Identifying, surveying, and monitoring sea life and freshwater life: This may be associated with citizen science projects and underwater photography (see also marine biology).
* Maritime archeology or Underwater archeology – Also may be associated with citizen science and underwater photography
* Rescue Diver – Usually considered a desirable diving skill, but may be part of the requirements and function of volunteer safety divers, and generally a requirement for any dive leadership certification.
* Underwater navigation – Enhanced competence at following and recording underwater routes, generally excluding the use of a guide-line, which is considered a separate competence, and using a compass and landmarks.
* Underwater photography - Use of photographic equipment designed or modified for underwater use for recording the environment or artistic purposes.
* Underwater search and recovery Knowledge and procedural skills for conducting underwater searches and recovering relatively small objects from underwater.
* Underwater videography – Use of video recording equipment designed or modified for underwater use for recording the environment or artistic purposes.
* Underwater hunting and gathering for sport and food. The ecological impact is variable, but can be severe.

=== Specialties ===
Some recreational diving activities require skills sufficiently beyond the basic recreational open water diving skill set that they are classed by the recreational diver training industry as specialties, and for which further training and certification is available. These can be broadly distinguished as environmental and equipment specialties.

Environmental specialties:
* Altitude diving – Knowledge and skills associated with diving in waters where the surface pressure is significantly below average sea level pressure, and affects decompression. 
* Cave diving – Knowledge and procedural skills related to managing risk in underwater cave environments. 
* Deep diving – Knowledge and procedural skills related to managing risk at greater depths, and the decompression associated with deep exposure.
* Drift diving – Procedures used to dive while transported by currents.
* Ice diving – Knowledge and procedural skills related to managing risk in very cold water and under an ice surface layer.
* Low impact diving – Knowledge and procedural skills intended to minimise the environmental impact of recreational diving, mainly by minimising contact with the sensitive reef life, but it also applies to diving on fragile structure of historical wrecks and in caves with delicate rock formations.
* Night diving – Knowledge and procedural skills related to managing risk while diving in very low levels of natural illumination.
* Underwater surveys and mapping of dive sites, in caves, wrecks and open water reefs. A part of recording exploration, and of archaeological work. 
* Wreck diving – Knowledge and procedural skills related to managing risk while diving inside wrecks.

Equipment specialties:
* Dry suit – Knowledge and procedural skills related to managing risk associated with the use of dry suits, and optimising their usage. 
* Rebreather – Knowledge and procedural skills related to managing risk related to diving with rebreathers. Type certification is often required for the specific model of rebreather.
* Sidemount diving – Knowledge and procedural skills related to use of side-mounted scuba equipment.
* Nitrox diving – Knowledge related to managing risk when using nitrox as a breathing gas.
* Recreational trimix diving – Knowledge related to managing risk when using trimix as a breathing gas. The depths which make trimix a preferred breathing gas also often imply obligatory decompression and gas switching for accelerated decompression.
* Safe use of a diver propulsion vehicle (scooter). This activity is not generally associated with a formal training programme and certification, but some practice and knowledge is necessary for safe and effective use, particularly in combination with other complex or high risk activities or equipment.

Many diver training agencies such as ACUC, BSAC, CMAS, IANTD, NAUI, PADI, PDIC, SDI, and SSI offer training in these areas, as well as opportunities to move into professional dive leadership, instruction, technical diving, public safety diving and others.

== History ==

Recreational scuba diving grew out of related activities such as Snorkeling and underwater hunting. For a long time, recreational underwater excursions were limited by breath-hold time. The invention of the aqualung in 1943 by Émile Gagnan and Jacques-Yves Cousteau and the wetsuit in 1952 by University of California, Berkeley physicist, Hugh Bradner and its development over subsequent years led to a revolution in recreational diving. However, for much of the 1950s and early 1960s, recreational scuba diving was a sport limited to those who were able to afford or make their own kit, and prepared to undergo intensive training to use it.

As the sport became more popular, manufacturers became aware of the potential market, and equipment began to appear that was easy to use, affordable and reliable. Continued advances in SCUBA technology, such as buoyancy compensators, improved diving regulators, wet or dry suits, and dive computers, increased the safety, comfort and convenience of the gear encouraging more people to train and use it.

Until the early 1950s, navies and other organizations performing professional diving were the only providers of diver training, but only for their own personnel and only using their own types of equipment. The first scuba diving school was opened in France to train the owners of the Cousteau and Gagnan designed twin-hose scuba. The first school to teach single hose scuba was started in 1953, in Melbourne, Australia, at the Melbourne City Baths. RAN Commander Batterham organized the school to assist the inventor of the single hose regulator, Ted Eldred. However, neither of these schools was international in nature.

There were no formal training courses available to civilians who bought the early scuba equipment. Some of the first training started in 1952 at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography where Andy Rechnitzer, Bob Dill and Connie Limbaugh taught the first scuba courses in the United States, then in 1953 Trevor Hampton created the first British diving school, the British Underwater Centre and in 1954 when Los Angeles County created an Underwater Instructor Certification Course based on the training that they received from the scientific divers of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Early instruction developed in the format of amateur teaching within a club environment, as exemplified by organizations such as the Scottish Sub Aqua Club and the British Sub Aqua Club from 1953, Los Angeles County from 1954 and the YMCA from 1959.

Professional instruction started in 1959 when the non-profit NAUI was formed, which later effectively was split, to form the for-profit PADI in 1966. The National Association of Scuba Diving Schools (NASDS) started with their dive center based training programs in 1962 followed by SSI in 1970. Professional Diving Instructors College was formed in 1965, changing its name in 1984 to Professional Diving Instructors Corporation (PDIC).

In 2009 PADI alone issued approximately 950,000 diving certifications. Approximately 550,000 of these certifications were &quot;entry level&quot; certifications and the remainder were more advanced certifications.

Scuba-diving has become a popular leisure activity, and many diving destinations have some form of dive shop presence that can offer air fills, equipment sale, rental and repair, and training. In tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world, there is a large market for &#x27;holiday divers&#x27;; people who train and dive while on holiday, but rarely dive close to home.

Technical diving and the use of rebreathers are increasing, particularly in areas of the world where deeper wreck diving is the main underwater attraction. Generally, recreational diving depths are limited by the training agencies to a maximum of between 30 and 40 meters (100 and 130 feet), beyond which a variety of safety issues such as oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis significantly increase the risk of diving using recreational diving equipment and practices, and specialized skills and equipment for technical diving are needed.

== Standard equipment ==
The standard recreational open circuit scuba equipment includes the following items:

Basic equipment, which can be used for most modes of ambient pressure diving:
* a diving mask for underwater vision;
* a snorkel to aid surface swimming;
* a pair of swimfins, for mobility;
* a diving suit, which may be a dry suit, wetsuit or dive skins, or a regular swimsuit, depending on the water temperature and other factors, for thermal and environmental protection;
* a diving weighting system such as a weight belt or BCD integrated weight system, to counteract the buoyancy of the fully equipped diver (mostly the diving suit);
A scuba set, comprising:
* a single diving cylinder (also known as scuba tank), with cylinder valve, to supply breathing air, and a harness to support it. In the past, twin cylinders were also popular.
* a buoyancy compensator, (also known as buoyancy control device or BCD), which is usually part of the harness used to carry the cylinder, to adjust buoyancy by controlled inflation and deflation.
* a diving regulator to reduce the pressure of the air from the cylinder, with:
** a primary second stage, to supply the diver with ambient pressure air on demand;
** a secondary second stage (octopus) to supply emergency air to a buddy diver who needs assistance;
** a submersible pressure gauge (SPG) (also known as contents gauge), to monitor the remaining air supply;
** a low pressure inflation hose for the buoyancy compensator, and if applicable, for the dry suit, to inflate the BCD and suit for buoyancy control and to avoid suit squeeze.
Auxiliary equipment to enhance safety.
* a dive computer (also known as personal decompression computer) or a depth gauge and timer, to monitor the dive profile, avoid decompression obligation and facilitate a controlled ascent;
* a surface marker buoy or other surface detection aid may be standard equipment in some regions to allow the surface crew and boats to monitor the diver&#x27;s position.
* a diver&#x27;s cutting tool should be carried in areas where there is a significant risk of entanglement in ropes, lines, or nets. (usually lost or discarded fishing gear)
For solo diving a bailout cylinder is considered standard for dives where there is an appreciable risk of entrapment, or where a direct controlled emergency swimming ascent is not an acceptable option to manage an out-of-air incident at any point in the planned dive profile.

== Standard procedures ==
Some skills are generally accepted by recreational diver certification agencies as necessary for any scuba diver to be considered competent to dive without direct supervision, and others are more advanced, though some diver certification and accreditation organizations may consider some of these to also be essential for minimum acceptable entry level competence. Divers are instructed and assessed on these skills during basic and advanced training, and are expected to remain competent at their level of certification, either by practice or refresher courses.

The skills include selection, functional testing, preparation and transport of scuba equipment, dive planning, preparation for a dive, kitting up for the dive, water entry, descent, breathing underwater, monitoring the dive profile (depth, time and decompression status), personal breathing gas management, situational awareness, communicating with the dive team, buoyancy and trim control, mobility in the water, ascent, emergency and rescue procedures, exit from the water, un-kitting after the dive, cleaning and preparation of equipment for storage, and recording the dive, within the scope of the diver&#x27;s certification.
A significant amount of harmonization of training standards and standard and emergency procedures has developed over the years, largely due to organisations like World Recreational Scuba Training Council. This allows divers trained by the various certifying organisations to dive together with a minimum of confusion, which enhances safety. Diver communications is a particular aspect where most of the basic hand signals are common to most recreational diver training agencies.
This does not mean that there is no variation. There are some procedures such as emergency donation of air which are quite strongly polarized between those who advocate donation of the secondary (octopus) regulator and those who advocate donating the primary regulator. Length of regulator hose and position of the secondary second stage depend on the donation technique.

There are also variations in procedures for self rescue in an out-of-air situation, and in procedures for bringing an unresponsive casualty to the surface.

Solo diving, once considered technical diving and discouraged by most certification agencies, is now seen by many experienced divers and some certification agencies as an acceptable practice for those divers suitably trained and experienced. Rather than relying on the traditional buddy diving safety system, solo divers rely on self-sufficiency and are willing to take responsibility for their own safety while diving.

Buddy diving is the more generally advocated procedural alternative, on the principle that in case of an emergency, a dive buddy can assist the diver in difficulty, but this is only valid if the buddy is close enough to help, notices the problem, and is competent and willing to assist.

== Training ==
Many recreational diver training organisations exist, throughout the world, offering diver training leading to certification: the issuing of a &quot;diver certification card&quot;, also known as a &quot;C-card,&quot; or qualification card.

Recreational diver training courses range from minor specialties which require one classroom session and an open water dive, and which may be completed in a day, to complex specialties which may take several days to weeks, and require several classroom sessions, confined water skills training and practice, and a substantial number of open-water dives, followed by rigorous assessment of knowledge and skills. Details on the approximate duration of training can be found on the websites of most certification agencies, but accurate schedules are generally only available from the specific school or instructor who will present that course, as this will depend on the local conditions and other constraints.

Diving instructors affiliated to a diving certification agency may work independently or through a university, a dive club, a dive school or a dive shop. They will offer courses that should meet, or exceed, the standards of the certification organisation that will certify the divers attending the course.

=== Diving skills ===
Diver training can be divided into entry-level training, which are those skills and knowledge considered essential for the diver to dive unsupervised at an acceptably low level of risk by the certifying agency, and further skills and knowledge which allow better performance and extend the environmental capacity and equipment choices of the diver.

==== Entry level ====
There is a significant variation in entry-level training, with some training agencies requiring the bare minimum as specified by RSTC and ISO, and others requiring a greater level of competence with associated assumption of lower risk to the diver and dive buddy, and less likelihood of environmental damage. Entry level training may include skills for assisting or rescue of another diver, but this is not always the case. Divers without rescue training are routinely assigned to dive as buddy pairs to follow organizational protocols. This is not generally a contravention of the training agencies&#x27; recommendations.

The initial training for open water certification for a person who is medically fit to dive and a reasonably competent swimmer is relatively short. The minimum number of open-water dives required for certification is usually four, but instructors are generally required by training standards to ensure that the diver is sufficiently skilled to dive safely in the local environment before certification is issued, and this may require further training and experience beyond the required minimum. Many dive shops in popular holiday locations offer courses intended to teach a novice to dive in a few days, which can be combined with diving on the vacation. Other instructors and dive schools will provide more thorough training, which generally takes longer.

====Beyond entry level====
Skills and knowledge beyond the minimum requirement are generally labelled &quot;Advanced skills&quot;, and these may include skills such as competent buoyancy control, which are included in the entry level skills by other agencies. Many skills which are considered advanced by recreational training agencies are considered basic entry-level skills for professional divers.

===Training standards===

Each diver certification agency has its own set of diver training standards for each level of certification that they issue. Although these standards are usually available on request or on the organisation&#x27;s website, the assessment criteria are often not available to the public, making a direct comparison of standards difficult. Most agencies comply with the minimum requirements of the World Recreational Scuba Training Council (WRSTC) or ISO for the relevant certification (ISO 24801-2 Autonomous diver, and ISO 24801-3 Dive leader), but most certification levels are not defined by the international standards.

Under most entry-level programs (SEI, SDI, PADI, BSAC, SSAC, NAUI, SSI, and PDIC), divers can complete a certification with as few as four open water dives. This complies with the minimum requirements of ISO 24801-2 Autonomous diver. Such a qualification allows divers to rent equipment, receive air fills, and dive without supervision to depths typically restricted to 18 meters (60 feet) with an equally qualified buddy in conditions similar to, or easier than those in which they were trained. Certification agencies advise their students to dive within the scope of their experience and training, and to extend their training to suit the conditions in which they plan to dive.

In the 1980s, several agencies with DEMA collaborated to author ANSI Standard Z86.3 (1989), &quot;Minimum Course Content For Safe Scuba Diving&quot; which defines their training as the &quot;Accepted Industry Practices&quot;. The International Standards Organisation has since published ISO 24801 and ISO 24802 which define minimum training standards for two levels of recreational diver and for recreational diving instructors.

A few recreational certification agencies such as GUE, and the commercial diver training standards of several countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, and Canada, consider the competence provided by the recreational diver training industry minimum standard to be inadequate for safe diving, particularly occupational diving, where the diver has a legal duty of care towards other members of the dive team, even though the responsibility for occupational dive planning and safety is held by a professional diving supervisor.

==Risk==

Recreational scuba diving involves physical and psychological risks and therefore can be classified as an extreme sport. Fatality rates of 16.4 deaths per 100,000 persons per year among DAN America members and 14.4 deaths per 100,000 persons per year the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) members were similar and did not change during 2000–2006. This is comparable with jogging (13 deaths per 100,000 persons per year) and motor vehicle accidents (16 deaths per 100,000 persons per year), and within the range where reduction is desirable by Health and Safety Executive (HSE) criteria.

Data for 17 million student-diver certifications during 63 million student dives over a 20-year period from 1989 to 2008 show a mean per capita death rate of 1.7 deaths per 100,000 student divers per year. This was lower than for insured DAN members during 2000–2006 at 16.4 deaths per 100,000 DAN members per year, but fatality rate per dive is a better measure of exposure risk, A mean annual fatality rate of 0.48 deaths per 100,000 student dives per year and 0.54 deaths per 100,000 BSAC dives per year and 1.03 deaths per 100,000 non-BSAC dives per year during 2007. The total size of the diving population is important for determining overall fatality rates, and the population estimates from the 1990s of several million U.S. divers need to be updated.

The most frequent root cause for diving fatalities is running out of or low on gas. Other factors cited include loss of buoyancy control, entanglement or entrapment, rough water, equipment misuse or problems, and emergency ascent, which is often a response to a breathing gas problem. The most common injuries and causes of death were drowning or asphyxia due to inhalation of water, air embolism and cardiac events. Risk of cardiac arrest is greater for older divers, and greater for men than women, although the risks are equal by age 65.

Several plausible opinions have been put forward but have not yet been empirically validated. Suggested contributing factors included inexperience, infrequent diving, inadequate supervision, insufficient predive briefings, buddy separation, and dive conditions beyond the diver&#x27;s training, experience, or physical capacity.

==Legal status==
Legal constraints on recreational diving vary considerably across jurisdictions. In many countries recreational diving is either not mentioned at all in laws and regulations, or specifically excluded from regulations covering occupational diving. In others, only diver training and dive-leading activities where the diver is either employed or takes a leadership position where they are responsible for the safety of others is covered by legislation. At the other extreme, countries such as Israel have statutory law covering all recreational diving activities.

Recreational diver training and dive leading are industry regulated in some countries, and only directly regulated by government in a subset of them. In the UK, HSE legislation includes recreational diver training and dive leading for reward; in the US and South Africa industry regulation is accepted, though non-specific health and safety legislation still applies. In Israel recreational diving activities are regulated by the Recreational Diving Act, 1979.

The legal responsibility for recreational diving service providers is usually limited as far as possible by waivers which they require the customer to sign before engaging in any diving activity. The extent of responsibility of recreational buddy divers is unclear and has been the subject of considerable litigation. It is probable that it varies between jurisdictions. In spite of this lack of clarity, and conflicting evidence, buddy diving is recommended by recreational diver training agencies as safer than solo diving, and some service providers insist that customers dive in buddy pairs.

==Economic impact==
Recreational diving provides a market for the diving equipment industry, the diver training industry and the diver services industry, all of which are interdependent, and at retail level, frequently provided by the same local specialist outlet, thus contributing to the local economy. These activities contribute to generation of revenue through dive tours, certification courses and equipment rentals which in turn, support wages for dive charter captains and crews, and hotel and its employees.

Diving activities aid in marine ecosystem conservation, supporting the development of infrastructure and services like videography, scientific researches and other local businesses, simultaneously promoting tourism.

The combined contribution of recreational scuba diving and snorkeling to the US gross domestic product was estimated at $11 billion in a 2019 report by the Diving Equipment and Marketing Association.

Scuba diving tourism is the industry based on servicing the requirements of recreational divers at destinations other than where they live. It includes aspects of training, equipment sales, rental and service, guided experiences and environmental tourism. Customer satisfaction is largely dependent on the quality of services provided, and personal communication has a strong influence on the popularity of specific service providers in a region.

== Demographics ==

A 2014 survey of American divers indicates with a high level of confidence for the specified population, that about 3.145 million Americans (1.1 percent of population) took part in scuba diving at least once in the survey year, which is a 0.9 percent decrease over 2013, but participation increased by 1.3 percent on average for the previous five years. There were about 2.252 million casual participants who made between one and seven dives per year and 893,000 core participants who dived eight or more times per year. 66% of casual and 74% of core participants were male. The age distribution of casual and core participants differs. Core participants tend to be older. Casual participation tends to gradually rise to a peak in early middle age, then drop markedly after about 45 years old, while core participation tends to continue at a relatively consistent rate over age groups up to about 65 years, after which it drops markedly. Some training agencies will accept trainees as young as 8 years old for participation in supervised scuba experiences, and 10 years for certification. The record age for a scuba dive as of January 2020 is 95 years. Recreational scuba divers appear to be on average wealthier and better educated than the general population, as indicated by earlier surveys. There is a greater tendency than average for scuba divers to participate in other sporting and exercise activities than the general population, but lack of adequate physical fitness is frequently cited as a contributory factor in diving accidents.

The medical literature, anecdotal evidence and a small-scale survey suggest that a significant part of the recreational scuba diving population may have chronic medical conditions that affect their fitness to dive according to the Recreational Scuba Training Council&#x27;s guidelines. This may have an influence on risk, as unfitness and preexisting medical conditions are frequently cited in incident reports where the incident was adequately investigated.

PADI worldwide certification statistics indicate a slow but steady trend of increasing proportion of certification of female divers at all levels from 34.4% in 2013 to 38.0% in 2018, and a decrease in the average age of certifications over the same period.

Personality profiles of recreational divers were analysed in a 2010 study on entry level divers: The participants scored high on self-sufficiency, impulsiveness and boldness and low on warmth, sensitivity and conformity, and differed from the typical extreme sport participant&#x27;s personality profile. Personality types identified include adventurer, dreamer, rationalist and passive-aggressive macho diver, and results suggested that the risk behaviour likely to be exhibited by the diver would depend on their personality type.

== Venues for diving ==

Most types of bodies of water can be used as dive sites:

* Seas and oceans - these consist of salt water and a huge variety of flora and fauna.
* Lakes - small lakes are often used for diver training. Large lakes have many features of seas including wrecks and a variety of aquatic life. Some lakes are high in altitude, and they require special considerations for diving. See altitude diving
* Caves - these are more adventurous and dangerous than normal diving. See cave diving.
* Rivers - are often shallow, murky and may have strong currents.
* Man-made lakes, such as dams and flooded clay pits, gravel pits and quarries.
* Swimming pools are popular as training venues, and for some underwater sports.
Flooded excavations often have low visibility. Disused and flooded quarries are popular in inland areas for diver training as well as recreational diving. Rock quarries may have reasonable underwater visibility - there is often little mud or silt to create mid-water particles that cause low visibility, and the lack of flow allows silt to settle on the bottom, where it may later be kicked up by unskilled divers to temporarily reduce visibility locally. As they are not natural environments, and usually privately owned, quarries may contain objects intentionally placed for divers to explore, such as sunken boats, automobiles, aircraft, or structures like grain silos and gravel chutes. The popularity of a dive site will usually depend on accessibility, known hazards, desirable features, and the variety of alternative options nearby. Sites known for exceptionally desirable features may attract expeditions in spite of major accessibility problems and significant hazards.

=== Dive site features ===

Many types of underwater features make an interesting dive site, for example:

*Wildlife at the site. Popular examples are coral, sponges, fish, sting rays, molluscs, cetaceans, seals, sharks and crustaceans.
* The topography of the site. Coral reefs, drop offs (underwater cliffs), rock reefs, gullies and caves can be spectacular. Deep dive sites mean divers must reduce the time they spend because more gas is breathed at depth and decompression sickness risks increase. Shallow regions can be investigated by snorkeling. Wall diving allows a range of depths in a small area. 
* Historical or cultural items at the site. Shipwrecks and sunken aircraft, apart from their historical value, form artificial habitats for marine fauna making them attractive dive sites.
* Underwater visibility varies widely. Poor visibility is caused by particles suspended in the water, such as silt, plankton and sewage. Dive sites that are close to sources of these particles, such as human settlements and river estuaries, are more prone to poor visibility. Currents and turbulence can stir up particles which had settled, and may keep them in suspension. Diving close to sediments on the bottom can result in the particles being kicked up by wash from the divers fins. Good visibility is a highly desirable characteristic for a dive site, and can significantly influence risk.
* Temperature. Warm water diving is comfortable and convenient. Although cold water is uncomfortable and can cause hypothermia it can be interesting because different species of underwater life thrive in cold conditions. For cold water divers tend to prefer dry suits with inner thermal clothing which offer greater thermal protection, although they require additional knowledge and skill to use safely.
* Currents. Currents can transport nutrients to underwater wildlife increasing the variety and density of that life at the site. Currents can also be dangerous to divers as they can carry them away from their surface support or suitable exit points. Currents that meet large underwater obstructions can cause strong up or down flow that can be dangerous because it may cause the diver to rapidly change depth, with possible loss of buoyancy control and increased risk of barotrauma and decompression sickness.

==Marine citizen science==
Marine citizen science, the scientific research and monitoring projects for which members of the public collect, categorize, transcribe or analyze scientific data,
is an increasingly popular but underutilised collaboration between society and institutionalised scientific research, in which members of the recreational scuba diving community actively participate in marine data acquisition and recording, largely by way of geolocated photographic observations collected during recreational dives, but also in more structured and long term experimental work. Some barriers exist between divers and projects that are beyond the control of either the divers or the project organisers, but other aspects such as access to projects and feedback after participation are amenable to improvement. Recreational scuba divers are generally well disposed towards marine science, and participation could be improved by better management. Stakeholders to be considered are the scuba diving industry and professional intermediaries.

Citizen science can be an effective approach to marine and coastal conservation, and methods of making better use of citizen input for projects relating to policy, education, community capacity building, site management, species management, and research. have been investigated and developed. Marine citizen science projects face different challenges to terrestrial systems. The main challenges are logistical, as people spend very little time in the water. Access often requires expensive boats, diving gear, or transportation to the coast, and safety and liability issues can be complicated. Using citizen scientists can economically increase the temporal and spatial scale of a project. Early involvement of divers in the planning of a project can increase buy-in and avoid errors due to inaccurate assessment of capabilities and interest of volunteers. Training and some field oversight by professionals will usually be necessary to ensure reliable data collection. Retention of volunteers is affected by their perception of the recognition of the value of their work.

The availability of affordable and compact high definition video and easy to operate underwater cameras allows citizen scientists to provide reliable observations that can be archived and reviewed by experts when desirable. Accuracy of geolocation is generally lower than for terrestrial observations as the GPS features available on many digital cameras do not work underwater, and most cameras do not record depth.

<text>Aleksey Andreevich Tupolev (; 20 May 1925 – 12 May 2001) was a Soviet and later Russian aircraft designer who led the development of the first supersonic passenger jet, the Tupolev Tu-144. He also helped design the Buran space shuttle and the long-range heavy bomber Tu-2000, both of which were suspended for lack of funding.

== Biography ==
Aleksey Andreevich Tupolev was born on 20 May 1925 in Moscow. He was the son of the famed Soviet aircraft pioneer Andrei Tupolev.

Aleksey worked at the Tupolev Design Bureau in 1942–1949 as a factory designer. He graduated from the Moscow Aviation Institute in 1949. 

During Soviet leader Khrushchev&#x27;s visit to the U.S. in September 1959, he insisted on taking Tu-114 despite that its maiden long-distance flight only occurred in May. In order to guarantee the safety, Aleksey Tupolev was sent by his father Andrei, along as a sign of his confidence in the plane. Khrushchev later said, &quot;We didn&#x27;t publicize the fact that Tupolev&#x27;s son was with us&quot; for &quot;to do so would have meant giving explanations, and these might have been damaging to our image&quot;. 

His son, Andrey Alekseevich Tupolev, was born in 1961.

Aleksey became chief designer of the Tupolev Design Bureau in 1963 and general designer in 1973.

Aleksey Tupolev died on 12 May 2001. He was buried in Moscow.

<text>Edwin Sandys (; 1519 – 10 July 1588) was an English prelate.
He was Anglican Bishop of Worcester (1559–1570), London (1570–1576) and Archbishop of York (1576–1588) during the reign of Elizabeth I of England. He was one of the translators of the Bishops&#x27; Bible.

==Early years and education==
Edwin was born in 1519 to William Sandys, esq. of Esthwaite Hall and Graythwaite Hall, and Margaret Dixon, daughter of Sir John Dixon.

Sandys&#x27; place of education is not recorded, but historians believe that Edwin Sandys was educated alongside Edmund Grindal at St Bees, and taught by the Marian martyr John Bland. Sandys recalled that he and Grindal lived &quot;familiarly&quot; and &quot;as brothers&quot; and were only separated between Sandys&#x27;s 13th and 18th Years. A branch of the Sandys family lived at Rottington Hall near St Bees, and were known to the heralds in 1563 as &quot;&#x27;...of St Bees in the County of Cumberland&quot;&quot;. Edwin Sandys followed Edmund Grindal in his subsequent career, succeeding him as Bishop of London, and then Archbishop of York. 

Sandys went up to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1539 and then a Doctor of Divinity ten years later. In 1547 he was elected master of Catharine Hall, and by the death of Edward VI in 1553 he was Vice Chancellor of the university.

==Exile==
On the death of King Edward, the Duke of Northumberland sought to avoid a Roman Catholic monarchy by placing Lady Jane Grey on the throne. He and his followers arrived in Cambridge to raise an army in East Anglia and demanded that Edwin Sandys preach a sermon. When the rebellion failed and Mary Tudor took the throne, Edwin was arrested and taken to the Tower of London. For this he is mentioned in &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot;. Later he was moved to more comfortable conditions in Marshalsea prison where he made friends with the prison keeper who connived at his escape.

He went first to Antwerp and then Augsburg and Strasbourg where his wife joined him. His wife and infant son died there of a plague. He then lived in Zürich until the accession of Elizabeth I made it safe for him to return to England; on the day of Elizabeth&#x27;s coronation. On 19 February 1559 he married Cicely Wilford, sister of James Wilford.

==Archbishop of York==
On his return he became successively Bishop of Worcester, Bishop of London and Archbishop of York. He helped in the translation of a new version of the Bishops&#x27; Bible. Sandys&#x27;s own personal copy may be seen in the Hawkshead Grammar School Museum in Cumbria.
Along with other Marian exiles, who returned to positions of wealth and importance, Archbishop Sandys was concerned that true religion and sound learning would forever flourish in the land. They saw the necessity of education for religion&#x27;s sake and the need for the Church of England to hold their own in discussion with Roman Catholics. To these ends Edwin Sandys founded Hawkshead Grammar School in 1585 and endowed it with sufficient land and property for it to offer a free education.

Sandys died on 10 July 1588, and was buried in Southwell Minster in Nottinghamshire.

==Family==

Sandys was twice married. His first wife, Mary Sandys, died in 1558 at Strasbourg. They had one son:
* James Sandys (died 1557, Strasbourg)

On 19 February 1559, Sandys married Cicely Wilford, daughter of Thomas Wilford and sister of James Wilford. They had the following children:
* Sir Samuel Sandys (1560–1623)
* Sir Edwin Sandys (1561–1629), Treasurer of the Virginia Company of London
* Sir Miles Sandys (1563–1645)
* William Sandys (born 1565), died young
* Margaret Sandys (1566–1611), married Anthony Aucher, and gave birth to Elizabeth Archer, who married Sir William Hammond.
* Thomas Sandys (1568–), colonist, a first settler of Jamestown, Virginia
* Anne Sandys (1570–), married Sir William Barne
* Henry Sandys (1572–1626)
* George Sandys (1578–1644), traveller and poet, colonist in Virginia

In 1604 Cicely Sandys enlisted the support of Anne of Denmark in an unsuccessful attempt to found a university at Ripon in Yorkshire.

The Sandys family seat is now Graythwaite Hall, a few miles south of Esthwaite.

<text>Diver communications are the methods used by divers to communicate with each other or with surface members of the dive team. In professional diving, diver communication is usually between a single working diver and the diving supervisor at the surface control point. This is considered important both for managing the diving work, and as a safety measure for monitoring the condition of the diver. The traditional method of communication was by line signals, but this has been superseded by voice communication, and line signals are now used in emergencies when voice communications have failed. Surface supplied divers often carry a closed circuit video camera on the helmet which allows the surface team to see what the diver is doing and to be involved in inspection tasks. This can also be used to transmit hand signals to the surface if voice communications fails. Underwater slates may be used to write text messages which can be shown to other divers, and there are some dive computers which allow a limited number of pre-programmed text messages to be sent through-water to other divers or surface personnel with compatible equipment.

Communication between divers and between surface personnel and divers is imperfect at best, and non-existent at worst, as a consequence of the physical characteristics of water. This prevents divers from performing at their full potential. Voice communication is the most generally useful format underwater, as visual forms are more affected by visibility, and written communication and signing are relatively slow and restricted by diving equipment.

Recreational divers do not usually have access to voice communication equipment, and it does not generally work with a standard scuba demand valve mouthpiece, so they use other signals. Hand signals are generally used when visibility allows, and there are a range of commonly used signals, with some variations. These signals are often also used by professional divers to communicate with other divers. There is also a range of other special purpose non-verbal signals, mostly used for safety and emergency communications.

==Function==
For safety and efficiency, divers may need to communicate with others diving with them, or with their surface support team. The interface between air and water is an effective barrier to direct sound transmission, and the natural water surface is also a barrier to visual communication across the interface due to internal reflection, particularly when not perfectly smooth. The equipment used by divers and the pressurised environment are also hindrances to sound-based communication, and the encumbrance of diving equipment, relatively low light levels, and low visibility of many diving environments also hinders visual communication.

Communication is most critical in an emergency, where high stress levels make effective communication more difficult, and the circumstances of the emergency may make the communication physically more difficult. Voice communication is natural and effective where it is practicable, and most people rely on it for fast and accurate communication in most circumstances. 

The general requirements for an effective system for diver communication are that all the people who will use it have access to the system, that it functions effectively in the specific environment, that the people who wish to use it are familiar enough with it to communicate quickly, accurately and unambiguously with each other, and that the system has sufficient range to work when needed. A simple, logical and widely standardised system of signals is more effective at meeting these requirements. Several such systems have been developed using different equipment and suited for different circumstances. These include sound-based systems, visual systems and tactile systems.

==History==

The original communication between diver and surface attendant was by pulls on the diver&#x27;s lifeline. Later, a speaking tube system, patented by Louis Denayrouze in 1874, was tried; this used a second hose with a diaphragm sealing each end to transmit sound, but it was not very successful. A small number were made by Siebe-Gorman, but the telephone system was introduced soon after this and since it worked better and was safer, the speaking tube was soon obsolete, and most helmets which had them were returned to the factory and converted. In the early 20th century electrical telephone systems were developed which improved the quality of voice communication. These used wires incorporated into the lifeline or air line, and used either headsets worn inside the helmet or speakers mounted inside the helmet. The microphone could be mounted in the front of the helmet or a contact throat-microphone could be used. At first it was only possible for the diver to talk to the surface telephonist, but later double telephone systems were introduced which allowed two-divers to speak directly to each other, while being monitored by the attendant. Diver telephones were manufactured by Siebe-Gorman, Heinke, Rene Piel, Morse, Eriksson, and Draeger among others. This system was well-established by the mid-20th century, has been improved several times as new technology became available, and is still in common use for surface-supplied divers using lightweight demand helmets and full-face masks. The introduction of closed circuit video to monitor the interior of diving bells, and to provide the supervisory team with direct feedback on the diver&#x27;s work activities has expanded the capacity to provide useful advice to the working diver, and to keep track of the stand-by diver or &#x27;s activity in an emergency, making coordinated activity easier and more effective.

More recently, through-water systems have been developed which do not use wires to transmit the signal. They were first developed for the U.S. Navy in the late 1960s. An early system for recreational scuba, the Wet Phone, was launched by Sound Wave Systems in 1977, but failed. By the mid-1980s miniaturized electronics made it possible to use single-sideband modulation, which greatly improved intelligibility in good conditions. By 1988 several systems using single side-band were found satisfactory by the US Navy for intelligibility and range, and mostly satisfactory for ergonomics, reliability and maintainability. Through-water systems allow communications over limited distances between divers and with the surface, usually using a push to talk system, which minimises power consumption by transmitting only on demand. They are not yet in general use by recreational divers due to cost and the need for a full-face mask.

==Scope==

Surface supplied diving uses the widest range of equipment and methods. As of 2021, hard wired (cable) voice communications are still the primary method, supported in major commercial applications by one-way closed circuit video but line pull signals are also used as an emergency backup, and through-water voice systems may be used as emergency backup for closed diving bells. Local communication between divers includes hand signals and text written on slates.

Scuba diving can be done with cable voice communications, but the restriction on mobility makes this an unusual choice as it negates the primary reason for using scuba. Through-water voice communications do not have the same restriction on diver mobility, which is often the reason for choosing scuba for professional diving, but are more complex, more expensive, and less reliable than the hard-wired systems. There are some recreational applications for through-water voice communications for scuba, but this method is usually used for professional applications such as military and scientific diving, and almost all recreational diving relies on hand signals, light signals and writing slates for diver-to-diver communications, with the very few communications between diver and surface restricted to pre-arranged emergency signals. Breath-hold divers use a subset of the recreational diving hand signals where applicable, and have some additional hand-signals specific to freediving.

The presence of divers in the water during a diving operation exposes the divers to risks from passing waterborne traffic, and there are internationally standardised shape, light and flag signals to indicate that the diving support vessel is restricted in its ability to maneuver and that there are divers in the water.

== Voice communications ==


===Equipment===
Both hard-wired (cable) and through-water electronic voice communications systems may be used with surface supplied diving. Wired systems are more popular as there is a physical connection to the diver for gas supply in any case, and adding a cable does not make the system any different to handle. Wired communications systems are still more reliable and simpler to maintain than through-water systems, and do not require the diver to carry a power source. The communications equipment is relatively straightforward and may be of the two-wire or four-wire type. Two wire systems use the same wires for surface to diver and diver to surface messages, whereas four wire systems allow the diver&#x27;s messages and the surface operator&#x27;s messages to use separate wire pairs, allowing simultaneous speech in both directions. A standard arrangement with wired diver communications is to have the diver&#x27;s side normally on, so that the surface team can hear anything from the diver at all times except when the surface is sending a message on a two-wire system. This is considered an important safety feature, as the surface team can monitor the diver&#x27;s breathing sounds, which can give early warning of problems developing, and confirms that the diver is alive.

Through-water communications systems are more suitable for scuba as the diver is not encumbered by a communications cable, but they can be fitted to surface supplied equipment if desired. Most through-water systems have a push to talk system, so that high power is only used to transmit the signal when the diver has something to say. For commercial diving applications this is a disadvantage, in that the supervisor cannot monitor the condition of the divers by hearing them breathe.

Through-water communication systems are of two basic types. Acoustic systems provide one-way communications from the surface to divers. An audio signal emitted by a submerged transducer travels through the water to the divers, who can hear the sound directly, without signal receiving equipment. Amplitude modulated (AM) and single sideband (SSB) systems provide two-way communications between divers and between the surface and divers. Both the AM and SSB systems require electronic transmitting and receiving equipment worn by the divers, and an immersed transducer connected to the surface unit. SSB systems perform better around obstacles, and AM systems give a stronger and often clearer signal for the same power, but are restricted to line-of-sight use.

The diver&#x27;s speech is picked up by the microphone and converted into a high frequency sound signal transmitted to the water by the omnidirectional transducer. The signal can bounce off the bottom and surface and other obstructions, which can extend the range around obstructions, but will also degrade the signal due to interference effects caused by varying path lengths of different routes. When a receiving transducer picks up the signal, the ultrasonic signal is converted to an amplitude modulated electrical signal, amplified and converted to sound by the earphone. The through-water communications sets carried by the divers are battery powered.

The push-to-talk (PTT) method is the most widely available system for through-water communications, but some equipment allows continuous transmission, or voice activated mode (VOX).

Push-to-talk is simple, efficient, and the preferred mode of many divers. It transmits only when the button is pressed, and saves power by not transmitting when the diver has nothing to say, but requires the diver to use a hand to transmit. Users take turns to speak and listen. This is normal communications protocol, and encourages clear communication, but does not allow audio monitoring of the diver between communications.

Voice activated means that the unit is intended to transmit when the diver&#x27;s voice activates the microphone. If there is sufficient sound level generated at the microphone, the unit will transmit. This would run the battery down more rapidly when the background noise level is sufficient to activate transmission, but it allows hands-free communications.

Continuous transmission is a mode where one diver transmits continuously. This is hands free, but all audible noise will be heard by others on the same channel and within range. Open circuit breathing apparatus generally produces considerable exhalation bubble noise.

Through-water systems are also used for back-up to the wired communications via the umbilical generally used in closed diving bells. These systems are used in case of failure of the wired system, and do not rely on the integrity of the bell umbilical, so will work if the umbilical is severed and the bell lost. They operate between a battery powered transducer on the bell and a surface unit using a similar acoustic signal to those used for wireless diver communications. Single side-band suppressed carrier systems may be used, and a 27 kHz frequency with 4.2 kHz bandwidth is typical. Divers breathing helium may need a decoder system (also called unscrambling), which reduces the frequency of the sound to make it more intelligible.

===Voice communication protocol===

Underwater voice communication protocol is like radiotelephony procedure. The parties take turns to speak, use clear, short sentences, and indicate when they have finished, and whether a response is expected. Like radio, this is done to ensure that the message has a fair chance of being understood, and the speaker is not interrupted. When more than one recipient is possible, the caller will also identify the desired recipient by a call up message, and will also usually identify themselves. The surface caller should also give the diver a chance to temporarily suspend or slow down breathing, or stop using noisy equipment, as breathing noise generated by gas flow through the inlet and bubble noise from the exhaust is often so loud that the message can not be heard over it.

===Hyperbaric speech distortion===

The process of talking underwater is influenced by the internal geometry of the life support equipment and constraints on the communications systems as well as the physical and physiological influences of the environment on the processes of speaking and vocal sound production. The use of breathing gases under pressure or containing helium causes problems in intelligibility of diver speech due to distortion caused by the different speed of sound in the gas and the different density of the gas compared to air at surface pressure. These parameters induce changes in the vocal tract formants, which affect the timbre, and a slight change of pitch. Several studies indicate that the loss in intelligibility is mainly due to the change in the formants. 

The difference in density of the breathing gas causes a non-linear shift of low-pitch vocal resonance, due to resonance shifts in the vocal cavities, giving a nasal effect, and a linear shift of vocal resonances which is a function of the velocity of sound in the gas, known as the . Another effect of higher density is the relative increase in intensity of voiced sounds relative to unvoiced sounds. The contrast between closed and open voiced sounds and the contrast between voiced consonants and adjacent vowels decrease with increased pressure. Change of the speed of sound is relatively large in relation to depth increase at shallower depths, but this effect reduces as the pressure increases, and at greater depths a change in depth makes a smaller difference.

Helium speech unscramblers are a partial technical solution. They improve intelligibility of transmitted speech to surface personnel.

==Video communications==
Video cameras are often fitted to the helmets of surface supplied commercial divers to provide information to the surface team of the progress of work done by the diver. This may allow the surface personnel to direct the diver more effectively to facilitate the completion of the task, and can provide a permanent objective record of inspection work, allowing review by experts. Voice communication is always provided when diver video is used. The communications cables for these systems are part of the diver&#x27;s umbilical. Video may also be used to monitor the occupants of a closed diving bell.

== Hand signals ==

Hand signals are a form of sign system used by divers to communicate when underwater. Hand signals are useful whenever divers can see each other, and some can also be used in poor visibility if in close proximity, when the recipient can feel the shape of the signaller&#x27;s hand and thereby identify the signal being given. At night the signal can be illuminated by the diver&#x27;s light. Hand signals are the primary method of underwater communication for recreational scuba divers, and are also in general use by professional divers, usually as a secondary method.

Divers who are familiar with a sign language such as American sign language and equivalents may find it useful underwater, but there are limitations due to the difficulty of performing some of the gestures intelligibly underwater with gloved hands and often while trying to hold something.

===RSTC hand signals===

Member agencies of the Recreational Scuba Training Council (RSTC) in the United States have recognised a standardised set of hand signals intended for universal use, which are taught to diving students early in their entry-level diving courses.

These hand signals provide the following information:

* I am out of breath! Hands indicate rising and falling chest.
* Go that way: Fist with one hand, thumb extended and pointing in the direction indicated.
* Go under, over or around: With palm down, hand motion used to indicate intended route to go under, over or around an obstacle.
=== Other commonly used hand signals and variations ===
Diving signals sometimes differ between groups of divers. There are regional variations and variations that relate to the type of diving. One of the items with the largest range of variations is how divers indicate the remaining gas pressure in their cylinders. Some variations include:
* The throat cut signal: &quot;general danger&quot; or &quot;emergency&quot;.
* Tapping the mouthpiece: &quot;share air&quot;.
* Pointing at the ear: &quot;listen!&quot;
* Hand cupped behind ear: &quot;listen!&quot;
* Pointing at someone changes the reference of the next signal from &quot;I&quot; to the diver pointed at.
* Flat hand swept over top of head, palm down: &quot;I have a ceiling&quot;. This can indicate the diver has gone into or that there is a solid obstruction overhead. When ascending it means &quot;stop here&quot;. (this is my decompression ceiling, or we are ascending too fast, or just generally stop ascending at this depth).
* Moving hand across torso in wave motion: &quot;Current&quot;

Divers sometimes invent local signals for local situations, often to point out local wildlife. For example:
* I see a hammerhead shark: Both fists against sides of head
* I see a lobster: Fist with index and middle finger pointed out horizontally and alternately waggling up and down
* I see an octopus: Back of hand or wrist covering mouth, all fingers pointing outward from mouth and wiggling
* I see a shark: Hand flat, fingers vertical, thumb against forehead or chest
* I see a turtle: Hands flat one on top of each other, palms down, waving thumbs up and down together

Instructor signals:
* You (all) watch me. (usually before demonstrating a skill): Point at diver(s) with forefinger, point at own eyes with forefinger and middle finger, point at own chest with forefinger.
* You try that now, or do it again: Gesture with open hand palm up towards student after a demonstration of a skill.

== Dive light signals ==
The focused beam of a dive light can be used for basic signalling as well.
* OK signal: Drawing a circle on the ground in front of buddy.
* Attention please! Waving the torch up/down.
* emergency! Rapid, repeated, back and forth horizontal motion
Normally a diver does not shine a torch / flashlight in another diver&#x27;s eyes but directs the beam to his or her own hand signal.
== Touch signals ==
There are a few tactile signals in use by penetration divers for controlling a blind passage through an area of extremely low visibility, or where the restrictions do not allow the divers to see each other well enough to use hand signals. The Rimbach system of touch contact signalling:
* Push forward = go, 
* Pull back = back up, 
* Squeeze = stop.

== Line signals ==

Also known as rope signals, these are generally used in conditions of low visibility where a diver is connected to another person, either another diver or a line tender on the surface, by a rope, airline hose or diver&#x27;s umbilical. These date back to the time of the use of standard diving dress. Some of these signals, or pre-arranged variants, can be used with a surface marker buoy. The diver pulls down on the buoy line to make the buoy bob in an equivalent pattern to the rope signal. Effective line signals need a free line without much slack – before attempting a line signal, the slack must be taken up, and the line pulled firmly. Most signals are acknowledged by returning the same signal, which shows that it was received accurately. Persistent failure to acknowledge may indicate a serious problem and should be resolved as a matter of urgency. There are several systems in use, and it is necessary to have agreement between diver and tender before the dive.

===British Sub-Aqua Club===
BS-AC have a very small set of rope signals. Most of them have the same meaning as the equivalent commercial or Royal Navy signal.

Tender to diver
* One pull – Are you OK?
* Two pulls – Stay put. 
* Three pulls – Go down. 
* Four pulls – Come up at normal rate.
* Five or more pulls – Emergency, come up to the surface!

Diver to tender
* One pull – I am OK.
* Two pulls – I am stationary.
* Three pulls – I am going down.
* Four pulls – I am coming up.
* Five or more pulls – Emergency, bring me to the surface! (no reply required)

===Public Safety Divers===
Public safety divers and some recreational divers use the following line signals while conducting circular and arc searches underwater.

Tender to diver
* One pull – Are you OK?
* Two pulls – Stop, take out slack, reverse direction.
* Three pulls – Come to the surface.
* Four pulls – Stop, stand by, don&#x27;t move. (there could be danger ahead or a boat entering the search area)

Diver to tender
* One pull on the line – OK.
* Two pulls – Pay out more line.
* Three pulls – Object found.
* Four or more pulls – Assistance needed.

===Commercial diving===
Rope signals used in the UK and South Africa include the following:

Signals are combinations of &quot;pulls&quot; and &quot;bells&quot;, A pull is a relatively long steady tension on the line. Bells are always given in pairs, or pairs followed by the remaining odd bell. They are short tugs, and a pair is separated by a short interval, with a longer interval to the next pair or the single bell. The technique and nomenclature derive from the customary sounding of the ships bell every half-hour during the watches, which is also performed in pairs, with the odd bell last. One bell is not used as a diving signal as it is difficult to distinguish it from a jerk caused by temporarily snagging the line.

Attendant to diver:

General signals:
*1 pull – Calling for attention, are you OK?
*2 pulls – I am sending down a rope&#x27;s end. (or other pre-arranged item)
*3 pulls – You have come up too far, go back down until we stop you.
*4 pulls – Come up.
*4 pulls and 2 bells – Come to the surface immediately. (often for surface decompression)
*4 pulls and 5 bells – Come up your safety float line.

Direction signals:
*1 pull – Search where you are.
*2 bells – Go out along the or distance line, or straight out away from tender.
*3 bells – Facing shot or tender, go right.
*4 bells – Facing shot or tender, go left.
*5 bells – Come back towards shot or , or back along the jackstay.

Diver to attendant:

General signals:
*1 pull – To call attention, or have completed the last instruction.
*2 pulls – Send down a rope&#x27;s end. (or other pre-arranged item)
*3 pulls – I am going down.
*4 pulls – I wish to come up.
*4 pulls and 2 bells – Help me up.
*5 or more pulls – Emergency, pull me up immediately!
*succession of 2 bells – I am fouled and need standby diver to assist.
*succession of 3 bells – I am fouled but can get clear without assistance.
* 4 pulls and 4 bells – I am trying to communicate on voice comms.

Working signals:
*1 pull – Hold on or stop.
*2 bells – Pull up.
*3 bells – Lower.
*4 bells – Take up slack on the lifeline or lifeline is too tight.
*5 bells – I have found, started or completed the work.

===Royal Navy===
All signals start with a pull to attract attention, and this must be acknowledged before the actual signal is made. Royal Navy (RN) signals include short, paired &quot;bells&quot; and longer &quot;pulls&quot;. The RN signals are almost identical to the rope signals used by commercial divers in the UK and South Africa.

===US Navy===
The US Navy also has a standard set of line signals. These include general signals from diver to tender, search signals, and emergency signals. The signal to change from general to search signals or vice versa is seven pulls, and the meaning of the signals may vary depending on whether it is given by the diver or the tender. Most signals are acknowledged by returning the same signal, confirming that the signal was received correctly.

==Slates==

Written messages on plastic slates can be used to convey complex messages with a low risk of misunderstanding. Slates are available in various sizes and are usually hard white plastic with a matte finish, suitable for writing on with a pencil. They can be stored in various ways, but in a pocket or bungeed to the wrist are popular methods. Clipped to the diver by a lanyard is another method, but there is a greater risk of entanglement. Slates may be used to record information to be used on the dive, such as decompression schedules, to discuss matters of importance for which hand signals are not sufficient, and to record data collected during the dive. Waterproof paper wet-notes are a compact equivalent, and pre-printed waterproof data-sheets and clip-board are routinely used by scientific divers for recording observations.

==Cave line markers==

Cave arrows, Line arrows or Dorff markers (after Lewis Holtzendorff) are plastic arrowhead markers which are hooked onto a cave line by wrapping the line around the arrow through the slots. They are used to indicate the direction to the exit, and can be identified by feel. The message is simple, but of critical importance, as if a diver does not know which way to go at a line junction there is a risk of serious trouble. Line arrows are also used at a junction on the permanent line, and at a tie-off, so when the diver gets back to the tie-off, he or she can identify which way to turn.

Non-directional and hybrid personal line markers are used to indicate the identity of a diver who has passed along the line and has not yet returned to that point. They are attached to the line in the same way as cave arrows, and are deployed on the way into the cave, usually at critical points such as forks or jumps, and are used to indicate to other divers that someone is further in along the line. They are marked to identify the diver, and are recovered by the diver on the way out. Cookies (round markers), rectangular referencing exit markers and clothes pegs are used for this purpose. The round and rectangular markers are attached to the line in the same way as arrows, and may be personalised in any way that the owners can easily recognise. Colour is often used, but as there are a limited number of standard colours available, and they are often poorly distinguishable in the dark, modifications to shape may be used which can be recognised by touch.

Arrows should always be placed on the outbound side of an intersection as this is unambiguous. Sometimes there is more than one exit from an intersection. Both should be marked with arrows, but the preferred exit can be marked with two arrows in series. The arrows always point in the direction along the line towards an exit.

==Light and gas signals for surface supplied dives==
There are emergency signals usually associated with wet and closed bell diving by which the surface and bellman can exchange a limited amount of information which may be critical to the safety of the divers. They are for use when the voice communications system fails, and provide enough information that the bell can be recovered with minimal risk to the divers. These signals are not generally applicable to a diver who is supplied directly by umbilical from the surface, but if the umbilical is snagged and rope signals cannot be transmitted, these signals may be provided by hat light flashes and helmet flush (blowing gas from the helmet in a continuous stream by opening the or pressing the purge button).
* Two light flashes at the bell means that the surface is not receiving voice communications from the bell. The bellman responds by blowing down bell gas twice, creating two large distinct eruptions of bubbles that will be seen at the surface, then recalls the diver and prepares for surfacing.
* When the bell is ready to surface and the voice communications are not functioning, the bellman will blow down bell gas four times.
* If there is a problem during the ascent, a long continuous blow-down is the signal to stop.

==Miscellaneous emergency signals==
Tap codes, made by knocking on the hull, are used to communicate with divers trapped in a sealed bell or the occupants of a submersible or submarine during a rescue.

A scuba diver who deploys a Delayed Surface Marker Buoy (DSMB) at the end of a dive may use a pre-arranged colour code to indicate to the surface support crew if there is a problem for which assistance is required. In some circles a yellow DSMB is considered an emergency signal, and red means OK. In most circles a second DSMB deployed on the same line will indicate a problem. A DSMB can also be used to carry up a slate with a message, but this is unlikely to be noticed unless a special arrangement has been made.

Other minor emergency signals include the use of mirrors, inflatable signal tubes, floating streamers, compressed air sirens, whistles and other noisemakers to alert the surface support personnel of a problem.

VHF radios and personal emergency locator beacons are available which can transmit a distress signal to nearby vessels and are pressure resistant to recreational diving depths, so they can be carried by a diver and activated at the surface if out of sight of the boat.

==Diver down signals==

===Flags===

A diver down flag, or scuba flag, is a flag used on the water to indicate that there is a diver below. Two styles of flag are in use. Internationally, the code flag &quot;alpha&quot;, which has a white hoist and blue swallowtail fly, is used to signal that the vessel has a diver down and other vessels should keep well clear at slow speed. In North America a red flag with a white diagonal stripe from the upper left corner to the lower right corner is customarily used. The purpose of these flags is to notify other boats to steer clear for the safety of the divers and to avert the possibility of a collision with the dive boat which may be unable to maneuver out of the way.

===Light and shape signals===
A vessel supporting a diving operation may be unable to take avoiding action to prevent a collision, as it may be physically connected to divers in the water by lifelines or umbilicals, or may be maneuvering in the close proximity to divers, and is required to indicate this constraint by international maritime law, using the prescribed light and shape signals, and other vessels are obliged to keep clear, both for the safety of the divers, and to prevent collision with the diving support vessel. These signals and the rules for responding to them are specified in Rule 27 of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, also known as COLREGS, and &quot;Rules of the Road&quot;, as quoted below.

A vessel &quot;restricted in her ability to manoeuvre&quot;, except a vessel engaged in mine-clearance operations, shall exhibit:
# three all-round lights in a vertical line where they can best be seen. The highest and lowest of these lights shall be red and the middle light shall be white;
# three day shapes in a vertical line where they can best be seen. The highest and lowest of these shapes shall be balls and the middle one a diamond;
# when making way through the water, a masthead light or lights, sidelights and a sternlight, in addition to the lights prescribed in sub-paragraph 1;
# when at anchor, in addition to the lights or shapes prescribed in sub-paragraphs 1 and 2, the light, lights or shape prescribed in Rule 30.

A vessel engaged in dredging or &quot;underwater operations&quot;, when restricted in her ability to manoeuvre, shall exhibit the lights and shapes prescribed in sub-paragraphs (1, 2 and 3 above) of this Rule and shall in addition, &quot;when an obstruction exists&quot;, exhibit:
# two all-round red lights or two balls in a vertical line to indicate the side on which the obstruction exists;
# two all-round green lights or two diamonds in a vertical line to indicate the side on which another vessel may pass;
# when at anchor, the lights or shapes prescribed in this paragraph instead of the lights or shape prescribed in Rule 30.

Whenever the size of a vessel engaged in &quot;diving operations&quot; makes it impracticable to exhibit all lights and shapes prescribed in paragraph (above) of this Rule, the following shall be exhibited:
# three all-round lights in a vertical line where they can best be seen. The highest and lowest of these lights shall be red and the middle light shall be white;
# a rigid replica of the International Code flag &quot;A&quot; not less than 1 metre (3.3 ft) in height. Measures shall be taken to ensure its all-round visibility.

===Surface marker buoys===

Permanently buoyant or inflatable surface marker buoys may be used to identify and/or mark the presence of a diver below. These may be moored, as a shotline, and indicate the general area with divers, or tethered to one of the divers by a line, indicating the location of the group to people at the surface. This type of buoy is usually brightly coloured for visibility, and may be fitted with one of the diving flag signals. A surface marker buoy (SMB) tethered to a diver is usually towed on a thin line attached to a reel, spool or other device which allows the diver to control the line length to suit the depth, so that excessive slack line can be avoided.

A deployable, or delayed surface marker buoy (DSMB) is an inflatable marker which the diver inflates while underwater and sends up at the end of a line to indicate position, and usually either that he or she is ascending, or that there is a problem. The use of a DSMB is common when divers expect to do decompression stops away from a fixed reference, or will be surfacing in an area with boat traffic, or need to indicate their position to the dive boat or surface team. Divers can carry two differently coloured DSMBs so that they can signal to their surface support for help while decompressing underwater. By one system, a red buoy indicates normal decompression and a yellow buoy indicates a problem, such as shortage of gas, that the surface support should investigate and resolve. In other circles, two buoys of any colour on one line means the same.

A group of moored surface marker buoys may be used to demarcate an area in which diving is taking place. This is more likely to be used by commercial, scientific or public service divers to cordon off a work or search area, or an accident or crime scene.

==Ultrasonic wearables==
The Buddy-Watcher is a wrist mounted buddy alert device which sends an ultrasonic signal when a key is pressed, for at least through the water to the matching unit on the dive buddy, which will produce a silent vibratory and visual signal alerting the diver that their buddy wants attention. There is no direct indication to the sender whether the signal has been received and no indication of distance or direction to the buddy. The device is waterproof to , and therefore is suited for recreational scuba diving use, but not technical diving.

The UDI-28 and UDI-14 wrist mounted decompression computers have a communications feature between wrist units and a surface unit which includes distress signals, a limited set of text messages and a homing signal

== Underwater messaging using smartphones and smartwatches ==
In 2022, University of Washington, developed a software app, AquaApp, for mobile devices that repurposes the microphones and speakers on existing smartphones and watches to enable underwater acoustic communication between divers. The software running on commodity Android smartphones placed in water-proof cases, supports sending one of 240 pre-set messages including SoS beacons and has a range of up to 100 metres.

<text>Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast (), also referred to as Ivano-Frankivshchyna () or simply Frankivshchyna, is an oblast (region) in western Ukraine. Its administrative center is the city of Ivano-Frankivsk. It has a population of 

The area, also known as Prykarpattia, was part of the historical region of Galicia, where the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia flourished. After World War I, the area became part of the Second Polish Republic and was administered as part of Stanisławów Voivodeship until the invasion of Poland. The area was annexed by the Soviet Union and was known as Stanislav Oblast until 1962, when its administrative center was renamed after the Ukrainian writer Ivan Franko. Kolomyia was a historical center of the oblast and remains a major cultural center of Pokuttia, the traditional name for the southern part of the oblast.

==Name==

On November 9, 1962, a decree was issued by the Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada of the UkrSSR, according to which: &quot;Taking into account the wishes of the labor collectives of the city and region, the Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada of the USSR decided to rename the city of Stanislav (Stanislaviv) to Ivano-Frankivsk, and the Stanislav Oblast to Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast.&quot; The renaming was timed to the 300th anniversary of the city&#x27;s founding and in honor of the outstanding Ukrainian writer Ivan Franko.

As with the rest of Ukraine&#x27;s oblasts Ivano-Frankivsk may also be known by its matronymical name &quot;Ivano-Frankivshchyna (&quot;). However, that name did not receive general public acceptance and commonly Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast is almost always called &quot;Prykarpattia&quot; (en. Prekarpathians) – a historic name for the same region. (Geographically the historic region covers a much larger portion of Ukraine than just the Ivano-Frankivsk region.) Formerly as Stanislavshchyna or Stanyslavivshchyna – .

==Geography==
Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast borders Lviv Oblast to its north and west, Zakarpattia Oblast to its south-west, has a 50-km long state border with Romania (Maramureș County) to its immediate south, and it borders Chernivtsi Oblast to the south-east and Ternopil Oblast to the east. It is situated partly in the Eastern European Plain and partly Carpathian Foothills. The oblast may be divided into three regions: mountainous, pre-mountainous, and plains.

The climate is mildly-continental and damp with cool summers and mild winters. The average monthly temperature in June is with in the mountains. The average monthly temperature in January is with in the mountains. Average precipitation varies annually around with in the mountains.

===Relief===
The region is situated between two main regional tectonic plates: Carpathian fold belt and Volhynia-Podillya plate. The most prominent features of the first one are the Carpathian Mountains, while the second one - Dniester river.

The Carpathian Mountains contribute tremendously to the change in relief of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast and their elevation rises from north-east to south-west stretching along the oblast&#x27;s south-western border. The elevation of the oblast varies from 230 m (755 ft) to 2,061 m (6,762 ft) above sea level. The mountains occupy almost one half of the whole Oblast and consist of two main mountain ranges: the Gorgany (highest peak – Mt. Syvulia Major (1,836 m / 6024 ft)) and the Chornohora range (highest peak – Mt. Hoverla (2,061 m / 6,762 ft).

The rest of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast is located within the Dniester river and Prut river valleys. The plains of the oblast are part of the Carpathian Foothills and Opillia Upland (part of Podillia Upland) which are cut through by Dniester. The upland has a temperate-climate habitat mixed with grassland and woodland – also known as the forest steppe. The relief of the region consists mostly of rolling hills of 230-400 m (755-1312 ft) over the sea level. Near river valleys are common canyons and ravines.

A particular feature of the southern region of the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast is Stanislav Canyon, in the so-called Kherson Mountains, a deep cut in the local topography where episodic water flowing into the Baltic has steeply eroded a canyon formation.
The Dniester flows mainly through the Halych Raion and along the administrative border between Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil Oblasts. The territory of the region within immediate proximity to the river is traditionally known as &quot;Opillia&quot;. Opillia, however, stretches far beyond the oblast and only covers two of its raions: Halych Raion and Rohatyn Raion, both located in the north. Relief in the area consists of rolling hills uplands.
The Carpathian foothills consist mostly of low denudation accumulative uplands, while the right bank of Dniester along the border with the Ternopil Oblast depicts karst type relief of Pokuttia Upland. Because of it near that area along Dniester relief shows forms of canyon. Pokuttia Upland between Bystrytsia of Nadvirna and Prut River (Prut-Bystrytsia Upland) serves as drainage divide within the oblast between Dniester and Prut. Carpathian foothills have two depressions: one is at the confluence of Bystrytsia Solotvynska, Bystrytsia Nadvirnianska, Vorona and Bystrytsia rivers, called Bystrytsia Depression, and another is around the city of Kalush, called Kalush Depression.

===Hydrology===

Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast has a plethora of rivers, waterfalls, mountainous brooks, and smaller ponds, but there is almost no other type of bodies of water such as lakes and water reservoirs. Most of rivers either flow into Dniester or Prut River (tributary of Danube). The total water drainage area of the region is . Segments of Dniester and Cheremosh River are used as administrative borders with Ternopil and Chernivtsi oblasts respectfully.

The water drainage divide between Dniester and Prut cuts the region through middle of following districts: Nadvirna Raion, Kolomyia Raion, Tlumach Raion, and Horodenka Raion.

===Nature Reserves===
The region is a home to some 456 preserved areas (on June 1, 2006) of some , 30 out of which are of all-national importance with an area of and the rest of a local importance. In the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast is located a strict nature reserve Gorgany that was created in 1996. There are five national parks in the region. There are numerous natural monuments of feature and habitat management areas (zakaznyks).

==Government==

The government in the region is headed by the chairman of the regional state administration (for simplicity sake - governor) appointed by the President of Ukraine. The governor appoints his deputies forming his regional governing cabinet to supervise the government policies in the region. Aside of the state administration the region has its own council that is headed by its chairman. The composition of the council depends on the popular vote in the region, while the chairman is elected within the elected council.
;Regional State Administration
Regional State Administration consists of the chairman and his deputies (5) supported by the &quot;aparat&quot; of the administration. Within the administration are numerous departments, each of them headed by a chief of department. The Ivano-Frankivsk Region State Administration has 17 departments and other government institutions such as the Children Service, regional state archives, and others.

* Office of State Administration
* Chief Department of Economy
* Chief Financial Department
* Chief Department industry and infrastructure development

==Regional subdivisions==

Since July 2020, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast is administratively subdivided into six districts (raions). 


===Primary divisions (pre-reform)===
The Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast was administratively subdivided into 14 districts (raions) as well as 6 cities (municipalities) which represented a separate raion and in direct subordination to the regional government, among which are Bolekhiv, Kalush, Kolomyia, Yaremche, and the administrative center of the region, Ivano-Frankivsk. Burshtyn became the 6th city of regional importance in 2014. The formation of the region was established in 1921 in the Second Polish Republic and was in majority preserved during the Soviet times. Most of the districts (former powiats) were reestablished as well in 1960s. The major industrial and cultural centers of the region were given a wider form of autonomy and assigned as the cities of regional subordination.

===Secondary divisions===
====City municipalities (councils)/mayors====
The oblast has 15 cities which are (alphabetical order): Bolekhiv, Burshtyn, Dolyna, Halych, Horodenka, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kalush, Kolomyia, Kosiv, Nadvirna, Rohatyn, Sniatyn, Tlumach, Tysmenytsia, and Yaremche. Five of those cities are of regional importance and the other ten are of district importance. All cities have its own council and mayor that represent a local form of self-government allowed by the laws on local administration and the Constitution of Ukraine. City municipalities of the region are independent from any district administration.

====Town municipalities (councils)====
Within the region there are 24 urbanized settlements (towns) which are a special settlement classification inherited from the Soviet municipal organization. Three of those towns serve as administrative centers of their respective districts. Each town has its own council that along with surrounding village councils compose a district administration which has its own executive branch, District State Administration, appointed by the President of Ukraine. Towns do not have a mayoral office and their head of the council serves as the main representative of the whole settlement.

====Village municipalities (councils)====
All other settlements in the region are considered rural and accounted for some 765 localities including villages and 20 selyshches (smaller villages) which are administered by 477 village councils. Some village municipalities consist of several villages, while others are a single-village municipality. There are several villages that are part of city municipalities such as Ivano-Frankivsk, Bolekhiv, and Yaremcha, while all others are spread out across the districts of the region.

===Historical overview of subdivisions===
When on November 27, 1939, the Soviet regime was established in Stanisławów Voivodeship, the Polish administrative division of it was kept almost the same until January 17, 1940. Only two powiats Stryj and Żydaczów were transferred away.

On December 4, 1939, the voivodeship was officially renamed into Stanislav Oblast. In 1940 the oblast was redivided into 37 raions and two municipalities (cities of oblast subordination). The administrative centers of the former raions were following settlements: Bohorodchany (town), Bolekhiv (city), Bilshivtsi (town), Bukachivtsi (village), Burshtyn (town), Voinylov (village), Vyhoda (village), Halych (town), Hvizdets (town), Horodenka (town), Delyatyn (town), Dolyna (city), Zhabie (village), Zhovten (town), Zabolotiv (town), Kalush (city), Kolomyia (city), Korshiv (village), Kosiv (city), Kuty (town), Lanchyn (town), Lysets (town), Nadvirna (city), Novytsia (village), Obertyn (town), Otynia (town), Pechenizhyn (town), Rohatyn (city), Rozhniativ (town), Sniatyn (city), Solotvyn (town), Stanislav (city), Tlumach (city), Tysmenytsia (town), Chernelytsia (town), Yabluniv (town), Yaremcha (village). Two municipalities were cities of Stanislav and Kolomyia. On November 11, 1940, Deliatyn Raion was liquidated. On November 16, 1940, Novytsia Raion was re-administrated under town of Perehinske.

During the World War II the region was occupied by the Nazi Germany (see Operation Barbarossa). Along with Lviv, Drohobych and Tarnopil oblasts, it was reorganized on August 1, 1941, into Distrikt Galizien centered in Lemberg and annexed to the General Government. The area of the former Stanislav Oblast was divided into three kreis (counties): Kalusz, Stanislau, and Kolomea. On July 27, 1944, the region was liberated from the Nazi Germany by the Soviet Army (see Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive).

The administrative division of Stanislav Oblast was reinstated and confirmed on January 1, 1947, with the same 36 raions and two municipalities as their existed before the war. Several settlements, however, had their status elevated. The status of a town obtained Bukachivtsi, Vyhoda, and Yaremcha, while Halych and Horodenka became recognized as cities. The next major changes in the region took place in the late 1950s. In 1957 five raions were liquidated: Vyhoda, Zhovten, Kuty, Pechenizhyn, and Chernelytsia. Then another five were liquidated in 1959: Bukachivtsi, Korshiv, Perehinske, Solotvyn, and Stanislav. On December 30, 1962, within the oblast was created the Verkhovyna Industrial Raion, centered in a town of Verkhovyna.

On October 28, 1963, another major change took place when raions of the oblast were re-administered into the six rural raions, one – industrial, and two municipalities. There were the following administrative centers: Bohorodchany, Halych, Horodenka, Kalush, Kolomyia, Kosiv, Dolyna (municipalities – Ivano-Frankivsk (new name) and Kolomyia). On January 4, 1965, Dolyna Industrial Raion Raion was redesigned into the regular raion, while five other previous raions were recreated: Nadvirna, Rohatyn, Rozhniativ, Sniatyn, and Tlumach. On December 8, 1966, there were created Verkhovyna and Ivano-Frankivsk raions. That was the last major re-administration of the oblast.

On March 20, 1972, in the city of Kalush was created a municipality and it became a city of oblast subordination. On December 30, 1977, the same thing happened to Yaremcha status of which was elevated as well. On March 28, 1982, the Ivano-Frankivsk Raion was re-administrated under the Tysmenytsia Raion. On October 21, 1993, the city of Bolekhiv became of an oblast subordination with its own municipality. On December 14, 2006, Yaremcha was renamed into Yaremche.

<text>Lviv Oblast (, ), also referred to as Lvivshchyna (, ), is an oblast in western Ukraine. The capital of the oblast is the city of Lviv. The current population is 

==History==
===Name===
The region is named after the city of Lviv which was founded by Daniel of Galicia, the King of Galicia, in the 13th century, where it became the capital of Galicia-Volhynia. Daniel named the city after his son, Leo. During this time, the general region around Lviv was known as Galicia–Volhynia — one of the strongest and most stable kingdoms in Eastern Europe of that time.

===Early history===

The oblast strategic position at the heart of central Europe and as the gateway to the Carpathians has caused it to change hands many times over the centuries. In the Early Middle Ages, the territory was inhabited by the Lendians, an old Polish tribe. It was ruled variously by Great Moravia, Poland, Kievan Rus&#x27;, the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia (circa 1200 to 1340; from 1246 under the suzerainty of the Golden Horde), and then ruled by the Kingdom of Poland and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1340 to 1772). Apart from the Polish and Ruthenian population, there were sizeable Scottish and Armenian communities in Lviv and Brody during Polish rule. Following the First Partition of Poland it passed to the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1772 to 1918), then the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and Poland (1919 to 1939), when it was part of the Lwów Voivodeship of the Second Republic of Poland. The region&#x27;s historically dominant Ukrainian population declared the area to be a part of an independent West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic in November 1918 until June 1919, but this endured only briefly. Local autonomy was provided in international treaties but later on those were not honoured by the Polish government and the area experienced much ethnic tension between the Polish and Ukrainian population.

===Establishment===
The oblast was created as part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on 4 December 1939 following the Soviet invasion of eastern Poland and annexation of Eastern Galicia and Volhynia. Several NKVD prisoner massacres were committed in the area in 1941, including at Lviv, Sambir and Dobromyl.

It was occupied by Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1944 following the start of Operation Barbarossa, where most of the local Jewish population were killed. The Germans also established several prisoner-of-war camps with multuple forced labour subcamps in the region for Soviet, French and Belgian POWs, who were subjected to beatings, hunger, epidemics and executions, resulting in a high death rate. Following the end of World War II, the region remained in Soviet hands as was arranged in the Tehran and Yalta conferences. Most local Poles were expelled and Ukrainians expelled from Poland arrived.

As a result of the 1951 Polish–Soviet territorial exchange the area of Belz passed from Poland to the Lviv Oblast, whereas the area of Ustrzyki Dolne passed from the Drohobych Oblast to Poland. In 1959, Drohobych Oblast was incorporated into Lviv Oblast.

===Present day===
Given its historical development, Lviv Oblast is one of the least Russified and Sovietized parts of Ukraine, with much of its Polish and Habsburg heritage still visible today.

In Ukraine today, there are three provinces (oblasts) that formed the eastern part of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. Two of these, Lviv Oblast and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast were entirely contained in the kingdom; the third oblast of Ternopil was mainly in the kingdom apart from four of its most northerly counties (raions). The counties of the Kingdom of Galicia remained largely unchanged when they were incorporated into successor states; with minor changes as detailed below, the current counties are almost co-extensive with those of the Kingdom.

During the 2014 Euromaidan protests, the region is also notable for having declared independence from the central government led by Viktor Yanukovych who started to use active military force against protestors. During Ukraine&#x27;s decommunization process that accelerated after 2014, Lviv Oblast became the first region of Ukraine to remove all its Soviet-era monuments by January 2024.

==Geography==
The terrain of Lviv Oblast is highly varied. The southern part is occupied by the low Beskids mountain chains running parallel to each other from northwest to southeast and covered with secondary coniferous forests as part of the Eastern Carpathians; the highest point is Pikui (1408 m). North from there are the wide upper Dniester river valley and much smaller upper San River valley. These rivers have flat bottoms covered with alluvial deposits, and are susceptible to floods. Between these valleys and Beskyd lies the Precarpathian upland covered with deciduous forests, with well-known mineral spa resorts (see Truskavets, Morshyn). It&#x27;s also the area of one of the earliest industrial petroleum and gas extraction. These deposits are all but depleted by now.

In the central part of the region lie Roztochchia, Opillia, and part of the Podolia uplands. Rich sulphur deposits were mined here during the Soviet era. Roztocze is densely forested, while Opillia and Podolia (being covered with loess on which fertile soils develop) are densely populated and mostly covered by arable land. In the central-north part of the region lies the Small Polesia lowland, geographically isolated from the rest of Polesia but with similar terrain and landscapes (flat plains with sandy fluvioglacial deposits and pine forests). The far North of the region lies on the Volhynia upland, which is also covered with loess; coal is mined in this area.
==Climate==
The climate of Lviv Oblast is moderately cool and humid. The average January temperatures range from in the Carpathians to in the Dniester and San River valleys while in July the average temperatures are from in the Carpathians to in Roztochchia and in the lower part of the Dniester valley. The average annual precipitation is in the lowlands, in the highlands and up to in the Carpathians, with the majority of precipitation occurring in summer. Prolonged droughts are uncommon, while strong rainfalls can cause floods in river valleys. Severe winds during storms can also cause damage, especially in the highlands. The climate is favourable for the cultivation of sugar beets, winter wheat, flax, rye, cabbage, apples, and for dairy farming. It is still too cold to successfully cultivate maize, sunflower, grapes, melon, watermelon or peaches in Lviv Oblast. In the Carpathians conditions are favourable for Alpine skiing 3–4 months a year.

==Subdivisions==



Until the big district reform on July 18, 2020, Lviv Oblast was administratively subdivided into 20 raions (districts), as well as 9 city (municipalities) which are directly subordinate to the oblast government: Boryslav, Sheptytskyi, Drohobych, Morshyn, Novyi Rozdil, Sambir, Stryi, Truskavets, and the administrative center of the oblast, Lviv.
On 18 July 2020, the number of districts was reduced to seven. These are:
# Drohobych Raion (Дрогобицький район), the center is in the town of Drohobych; 
# Lviv Raion (Львівський район), the center is in the city of Lviv;
# Sambir Raion (Самбірський район), the center is in the town of Sambir;
# Sheptytskyi Raion (Шептицький район), the center is in the town of Sheptytsky;
# Stryi Raion (Стрийський район), the center is in the town of Stryi;
# Yavoriv Raion (Яворівський район), the center is in the town of Yavoriv;
# Zolochiv Raion (Золочівський район), the center is in the town of Zolochiv.

In addition, there are the city raions of the city of Lviv.

==Demographics==
* Male/female ratio: 48%/52%
* Nationalities (2001): 94.8% of the region&#x27;s population are Ukrainians; 3.6% (or 92,600 people) are Russians; Poles account for 0.7%; there are also smaller German, Jewish and Romani minorities. Notably, the comparison of the 2001 Ukrainian census (mentioned above), with the last Soviet census of 1989 reveals that in those 12 years the number of Poles in the Lviv Oblast declined by 29.7 percent which, in the opinion of &quot;Wspólnota Polska&quot; Society defies explanation, and could possibly be attributed to the intensive Ukrainization of the Roman Catholic Church.

===Age structure===
: &quot;0-14 years:&quot; 15.7% (male 202,923/female 193,000)
: &quot;15-64 years:&quot; 70.0% (male 867,699/female 897,788)
: &quot;65 years and over:&quot; 14.3% (male 122,906/female 238,016) (2013 official)

===Median age===
: &quot;total:&quot; 38.0 years 
: &quot;male:&quot; 35.2 years 
: &quot;female:&quot; 40.9 years (2013 official)

==Religion==
Fifty-nine percent of the religious organisations active in the Lviv Oblast adhere to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. The Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church is the second largest religious body. The followers of the Latin Church and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) are mostly from the Polish, and Russian or non-Galician Ukrainian minorities respectively.
==Historical and cultural sites==
The city of Lviv contains a well-preserved main square (Rynok) and numerous historical churches. Other sites of interest are the historic Lychakiv Cemetery, the local museum of folklore, and the ruins of the famous Vysokyi Zamok. The name of the castle is closely tied to the name of the city. There is also a museum of military artifacts, the &quot;Arsenal&quot;.

Well-preserved local wooden churches, castles, and monasteries can be found throughout the Oblast. One of them is the Olesko Castle which is first recorded in 1327. Another castle that was built at the end of the 15th century is Svirzh Castle in the village of Svirzh. One more and no less famous castle is the Pidhirtsi Castle. Its architectural complex consists of the three-story palace, Kostel, and small park. In Roztochia is also located the Krekhivsky monastery in the beech-pine grove at the foot of the Pobiina mount. The whole complex consists of the Saint Nicholas Church, the bell tower, numerous service structures, and defensive walls with towers. Another site worth of mentioning is the Tustan city-fortress which is built in the rock. The site was nominated as the historical and as the natural wonder of Ukraine. There also a nature complex in the valley of the Kamianka river in Stryi Raion. Another natural wonder of the region is the Kamin-Veleten (&quot;Rock-Giant&quot; in English) which is located near city of Pidkamin in Zolochiv Raion. The name of the local city means &quot;Under the Rock&quot;. A local museum of Ukrainian art and an institution of higher learning (Ivan Franko State University) are also present.

== Economy ==
The most important research into cereal epidemics in the country is undertaken here. The National Academy of Agrarian Sciences of Ukraine&#x27;s Institute of Agriculture in Obroshino is the center of study for cereal pathogens including powdery mildew of barley. In the early 2000s the most active researchers here were Olga Vronska and G. Kosilovich at the IoA. &quot;Puccinia recondita&quot;, &quot;Erysiphe graminis&quot;, (syn. &quot;Blumeria graminis&quot;) and various &quot;Pseudocercosporella&quot; spp. are present and are significant in winter wheat in this oblast.

Two introduced banded land snails, the Grove Snail (&quot;Cepaea nemoralis&quot;) and White-Lipped Snail (&quot;C. hortensis&quot;) are found here. &quot;C. n.&quot; was intentionally brought here in the late 1800s, but the genetic analysis of Gural-Sverlova &quot;et al.&quot;, 2021 shows continued introductions have also occurred ever since. (The geographic distribution of both suggests they arrive through the gardening trade, as is known from other countries.) This analysis shows several distinct arrivals of &quot;C. n.&quot; yielding several present-day populations in and around Lviv.

<doc id="494877" wikidata="Q1972089" url="?curid=494877" title="Full-face diving mask">
<text>A full-face diving mask is a type of diving mask that seals the whole of the diver&#x27;s face from the water and contains a mouthpiece, demand valve or constant flow gas supply that provides the diver with breathing gas. The full face mask has several functions: it lets the diver see clearly underwater, it provides the diver&#x27;s face with some protection from cold and polluted water and from stings, such as from jellyfish or coral. It increases breathing security and provides a space for equipment that lets the diver communicate with the surface support team.

Full-face masks can be more secure than breathing from an independent mouthpiece; if the diver becomes unconscious or suffers an oxygen toxicity convulsion, the diver can continue to breathe from the mask, unlike a scuba mouthpiece which is normally gripped between the teeth.

Full-face diving masks are often used in professional diving. They are relatively rarely used in recreational diving.

==Function==
The full-face mask provides breathing gas to the diver, and an air space to facilitate underwater vision. There is usually one air space for both breathing and vision, and this is automatically equalised by the breathing gas during descent. However, some models have a mouthpiece isolating the breathing gas supply from the rest of the interior of the mask, or have a divided interior, and the main air space must then be equalised during descent by exhaling through the nose.

Most full-face masks have an open circuit demand gas supply, but free-flow and closed circuit applications also exist and models used in commercial diving may be normally demand supplied, but with a free-flow option selectable by the diver.

===Positive pressure===

For some applications it is desirable for the gas inside the mask or helmet to remain at a pressure slightly above ambient at all times while in the water, as this will prevent any contamination from leaking into the gas space during inhalation if the face or neck seal, or the exhaust valve system, does not seal perfectly. In clean water such a leak is a minor problem, but leaks of contaminated water can be a hazard to health, and even life-threatening. A positive pressure inside a free-flow helmet is easily achieved by slightly increasing the opening pressure of the exhaust valve, provided it is adjustable, but for a demand system the cracking pressure of the demand valve must also be adjusted, so that it delivers gas before the internal pressure drops below external ambient pressure. This is not difficult, as a slight adjustment to second stage valve spring pressure is all that is required. The problem is that when the mask or helmet is off the diver, and the gas supply is pressurised, the demand valve will leak continuously, and a large amount of gas can be lost. The Interspiro Divator Mk II mask has a second stage regulator which has a manual lock on the demand valve to prevent free-flow when the mask is not in use, which unlocks when a breath is taken, and must be reset when the mask is taken off.

==Construction==
A full-face mask consists of a transparent faceplate (lenses, or window) through which the diver can see, a connection to a source of breathing gas, a means of removing any water which may get inside, some facility for the diver to block the nose to equalise the ears, a means of sealing these components to the diver&#x27;s face and preventing ingress of water and a means of securing the assembly to the diver&#x27;s head. Additional components may include communications equipment, lights, alternative breathing gas connections, and a means to defog the interior surface of the faceplate.

Two basic configurations are in common use: Those with a soft elastomer skirt which seals around the periphery of the face, and those with a rigid frame supporting the other components, which is sealed to the face by a soft foam ring which is clamped to the frame by a metal band, to which the straps are secured (band mask)

===Faceplate or lenses===

The faceplate, viewport, or lens is a transparent window, usually flat, which encloses an air space in front of the diver&#x27;s eyes and allows the eyes to focus correctly underwater. 
Several shapes have been used for faceplates and lenses:
* Circular, as in WWII Italian frogman&#x27;s rebreathers and in some early British frogman&#x27;s rebreathers.
* Oval, in some early British frogman&#x27;s rebreathers.
* Triangular with rounded corners, in some Siebe Gorman fullface masks intended for use with an aqualung set, and in the &quot;Jack Browne&quot; band masks made by DESCO for rebreather, open circuit demand, and free-flow applications.
* Some of DESCO&#x27;s fullface mask windows were egg-shaped (wider above).
* Rectangular with the ends of the sides bent back for better sideways visibility, as in the Admiralty Pattern full-face mask made by Siebe Gorman and used on the Siebe Gorman CDBA.
* In some older masks, small separate lenses, like some gasmasks.
* Kidney shaped, as in the Cressi full-face mask, or approximately rectangular, with a deep cut-out for the nose pocket, as in the KM-48.

The shape and maximum size of mask and helmet viewports changed with availability of tougher and easily moulded transparent synthetic materials: Clear acrylic (perspex) became available in 1933 and polycarbonate in 1958. Diving helmet windows had been of glass for a long time, but a rigid helmet supported by the corselet resting on the shoulders can carry glass much thicker, stronger, and heavier than a mask strapped over the face and supported by the neck.

===Frame===
A structural component is needed to connect all the working parts together and hold the mask in shape. Most full-face masks use a rigid frame for this purpose, which directly or indirectly connects the components together and holds the assembly in shape (Kirby Morgan Exo, Supermask and bandmasks, John Browne mask). The rubber moulding which incorporates the skirt seal may also be sufficiently stiff in places to partially perform this function (Cressi-sub, Scubapro), and the faceplate may also be structural (Dräger Panorama, Ocean Reef Neptune, Aga Divator).

===Face seal===
The frame supporting the functional components must be sealed around the face to maintain a leak free internal air space over the eyes, nose, and mouth. Two methods are used. 

====Soft skirt====
The soft skirted full-face mask is the more common arrangement, and is generally considerably lighter and more compact than the more sturdy and rigid band masks. There is usually a plastic frame which supports the faceplate (or lenses) and a demand valve, but in some cases the lenses and demand valve or rebreather mouthpiece may be attached independently to the rubber mask structure, which is integral with the skirt.

====Band-masks====

A band-mask is a type of full-face diving mask with a rigid and relatively heavy frame, to which a face seal is clamped by a metal band. Band-masks generally have a single faceplate, which may be relatively large, firmly mounted to a rigid frame which also holds the demand valve or other gas supply components. The frame may be of metal (often brass), a strong engineering plastic, or a fibre reinforced resin composite. A face seal, and in some cases a neoprene hood, is clamped onto the edge of the frame by the metal band which gives the mask configuration its name. The band may have several protruding buttons, onto which the straps of the rubber mask harness called the &quot;spider&quot; are fastened to secure the mask to the diver&#x27;s head. Where a hood is included, it may have a zipper up the back for ease of fitting, and the spider is secured over the hood. A band mask is generally heavier and more cumbersome to fit than a soft skirted full-face mask, but it provides greater security and protection to the diver, and is lighter and quicker to fit than a helmet, though less secure. 
Most band-masks are fitted with demand systems for gas supply, but can be operated in free-flow mode.

===Straps===
A system of three to five straps is used to secure the mask to the diver&#x27;s head. This component is often referred to as the spider. It is usually a rubber component comprising a group of straps radiating from a central patch or ring, which rests against the back of the diver&#x27;s head, low enough to resist slipping off over the top. The straps may pass through quick-adjust buckles attached to the mask skirt, or may have holes to hook onto the buttons of a band mask. This strap system is more secure than a single double-ended half-mask strap, however, a full-face mask is far more difficult to replace underwater, if dislodged, than a half-mask.

===Internal layout===
Four types of internal layout can be distinguished. 

====Open plan====
The simplest arrangement is a single interior space, with no subdivisions, and no mouthpiece. This is most appropriate to free flow systems.
In this arrangement the diver can talk clearly, including talking with other divers underwater. This allows communications equipment (usually an intercom wire or by modulated ultrasound) to be installed in the mask and is very useful for working divers. If an open plan full-face mask floods underwater, it can be more difficult to clear than with a mouthpiece.

There also is the problem of &quot;dead space&quot; inside some masks causing risk of carbon dioxide retention. Free flow air supply overcomes these problems by providing so much air that the mask is constantly flushed. The cost is high noise level and very inefficient air usage on some models.

====Internal oro-nasal breathing mask====
With a small (oro-nasal) breathing mask enclosing the mouth and nose inside the full-face mask, the dead space is considerably reduced, but the smaller space around the mouth increases the distortion of speech.

====Internal mouthpiece ====
A mouthpiece with bite-grip connects the gas supply directly to the diver&#x27;s mouth inside the mask.
If the mask floods, the diver can continue to breathe while clearing the mask, and it minimises dead space. Many Royal Navy and frogman&#x27;s rebreathers have this mask arrangement. It makes clear talking difficult, but not impossible. For many years British armed forces divers used the Admiralty Pattern full face mask, with a long rectangular window, largely flat, and bent back 90° at the ends, as in the illustration of a diver with a CDBA rebreather. The lower skirt has a hole that a breathing set mouthpiece is fitted through.

====Mouthpiece on a detachable pod====
Kirby-Morgan makes a unique configuration of full-face mask, the KM-48 Supermask, which has some characteristics of a half mask, while retaining many of the advantages of the full face mask: The rigid plastic main frame of the mask has a rubber skirt which seals around the eyes and nose like a standard half-mask, the nose may be pinched through the rubber nose pocket to equalize in the same way as with a half mask, and there is an extension to the skirt which seals around the lower part of the face and encloses the mouth. This mask has a clip-on pod section which carries the demand valve, and this part seals against the lower part of the frame, allowing the diver to remove the regulator pod when on the surface, or to use an alternative gas supply, which can either be mounted on another pod, or be an ordinary Scuba regulator second stage with a standard mouthpiece. This feature makes it possible to use bailout gas supplied by a dive buddy with a standard regulator while wearing a Supermask. An optional pod with a dive/surface valve for use with rebreathers is available to military users.

===Attachment of breathing gas supply components===
Demand valve, twin hoses, rebreather mouthpiece or free-flow air supply hose may connect to the mask in various ways, including:-
* Connection of surface supply and bailout hoses to a bailout block on the mask frame, typically at the right temple. From there integral plumbing takes the air to the integral demand valve and free-flow/defog port.
* Demand valve rigidly connected to the lower part of the frame, with external bailout block.
* Demand valve or rebreather mouthpiece plugged into the lower part of the frame.
* Demand valve plugged into a port on the side of the lower part of the frame (for bailout).
* Twin hoses ported through the lower part of the window, as in the Siebe Gorman aqualunger&#x27;s full-face mask.
* Through the mask&#x27;s flexible skirt at the bottom, as with Siebe Gorman frogman&#x27;s masks, for example the Siebe Gorman CDBA.
* The early DESCO full-face mask&#x27;s twin breathing hoses entered through the skirt at the sides, level with the lower end of the nose, pointing backwards and a bit downwards, to keep the breathing tubes shorter to reduce the risk of snagging.

==Operation==

===Fitting===
The full-face mask is generally the last piece of equipment fitted before the dive, as it is cumbersome and makes fitting other equipment more difficult by restricting the diver&#x27;s field of vision, and the mobility of the head. The fitting may require the help of an attendant, particularly for the heavier band masks. The straps must be tensioned sufficiently to ensure a good seal, and to hold the mask securely to the diver&#x27;s head, but not so tight as to cause discomfort during the dive. It is possible to adjust the fit to some extent during the dive.

===Clearing===
Water which enters the air spaces of the mask may be expelled either under the lower edge of the skirt, or through the exhaust port of the demand valve, or through a drain valve fitted for this purpose.

===Equalising===
The full-face mask must provide a means for the diver to block the nostrils for equalizing the middle ears. This may be provided in several ways. Some masks have a soft rubber nose pocket which allows the diver to pinch the nose directly, some have a soft cushion which can be pressed against the lower part of the nose to occlude the nostrils, and others have a mechanism which applies soft levers to the sides of the nose to pinch it in the same way that it would be done with fingers. The details of these mechanisms varies, but they all work. Some need to be adjusted to suit the individual diver, others are sufficiently flexible to fit almost anyone.

===Defogging===
Most full-face masks do not have fresh airflow directly over the interior of the faceplate, and are to some extent susceptible to fogging by condensation during a dive. This may be minimized by application of a demister surfactant before the dive, by rinsing during the dive, or in those cases where the system allows, by purging the mask through a free-flow/defog valve, which directs a flow of dry air over the inner surface of the faceplate. This facility uses a lot of air, and is usually only available on models intended primarily for surface supplied applications.

Some British Army and Russian gas masks are designed so that when the wearer breathes in, the inflow of air blows over the inside of the mask window and tends to evaporate any mist deposit on it. This feature is also found on the original Kirby Morgan EXO-26 mask, but the later EXO-BR uses an oro-nasal inner mask to reduce dead space.

===Surface breathing===
Full-face masks intended for use with scuba may provide a method of switching to atmospheric air when above the surface, to save breathing gas. Rebreather systems often incorporate a dive/surface valve in the mouthpiece which may provide an opening to the ambient environment when the loop is isolated. Some other full-face masks allow the demand valve to be unplugged on the surface, or provide a &quot;snorkel valve&quot; port which can be opened to allow atmospheric air to enter. The small saving on breathing gas is unimportant with surface-supplied breathing apparatus.

===Bailout===
Emergency provision of an alternative breathing gas source is required in case of a failure of the primary gas supply. This is managed in several ways by full face masks.

The most prevalent method for masks intended for surface supply applications is known as a bailout valve. The surface supplied diver generally carries a bailout gas supply sufficient to reach a place of safety based on the planned dive profile. This gas supply is regulated by a scuba first stage regulator, and plumbed into the primary air supply circuit via a bailout valve before it reaches the demand valve. The full face masks designed for surface supply work usually mount this valve on the side of the mask frame, in the bailout block, where it is convenient and easily reached by the diver. The bailout cylinder valve is normally open during the dive. To switch to bailout, the diver simply opens the bailout valve, and is immediately supplied by gas from the bailout cylinder.

A similar functionality can be provided for masks without an integral bailout block, by mounting an external bailout block at a convenient place on the diver&#x27;s harness. Surface supply and bailout supply hoses are connected to this block, which works exactly the same way as the integral block. The same method can be used for open circuit scuba diving, but this only allows for a single gas switch. Gas manifolds with more than two gas supply options are technically possible, but allow for a wider range of operator error and are therefore considered high risk, as the consequences of switching to a gas unsuitable for the current depth may be fatal. This system does not allow for supply of bailout gas to another diver. This system is used for most full face masks, as they have no other option. Surface supplied divers use the pneumofathometer hose to supply gas to another diver.

Rebreather systems which use a bailout valve on the mouthpiece are often the method of choice for use with full-face masks, as the bailout mechanism is provided in the mouthpiece, and works the same whether used with a full-face mask or a half mask.

A few models of full-face mask are provided with secondary ports to which additional demand valves can be connected, either by screw connector (Ocean Reef) or by bayonet style connector (Dräger). These allow for bailout or decompression gas to be ported to the mask via an entirely independent scuba set, but it is necessary to control which gas is used at any given time by using a valve on the supply line or cylinder. The Dräger Panorama mask also allows the primary demand valve to be unplugged from the mask and a bailout demand valve to be substituted. This can be done underwater with very little water ingress to the mask, and is closely equivalent to switching demand valves with a half mask, but a little slower and more complex.

The Kirby-Morgan KM 48 Supermask is unique, in that the airspace for the eyes is completely separate from the mouth area, and the mask can be worn as a half mask by leaving off the mouthpiece pod, which holds the demand valve or rebreather mouthpiece. This allows bailout to a standard scuba demand valve with mouth grip, but also allows the diver to carry bailout gas fitted to a second pod, which can be clipped to the mask when the primary pod has been unclipped. This can be done underwater, and as there is a standard mouthpiece inside the pod, breathing can commence before the pod is fully connected and sealed. The pod can be cleared of water after sealing, and the eye-space is not affected by the switch. A final alternative sometimes used by recreational divers, is to bail out to a standard demand valve by removing the full face mask completely, and then fitting a backup half mask.

==Safety==

It may take a fairly long time to remove the mask to switch to breathing from the atmosphere. To avoid this, some full-face masks have a valve to switch between breathing from the set and breathing from atmosphere. The &#x27;dive/surface valve&#x27;, or &#x27;snorkel valve&#x27;, should be easily operated by the diver, even if wearing thick diving gloves, but not projecting so far that it can be easily knocked against things in low visibility water or in the dark, or in hand-to-hand combat underwater.

A full-face mask provides better security of breathing gas supply than a half-mask if there is a risk of the diver losing consciousness underwater.

The mask faceplate is generally a high impact strength polymer which is securely attached to the skirt or frame. A failure of the faceplate can be a life-threatening incident with some full face masks, as the water will flood into the oro-nasal inner mask and compromise the air supply. This problem is avoided by the masks which include a mouthpiece.

Not all divers will get a satisfactory seal from the skirt of any given full-face mask, as face shapes and sizes differ, but most divers will be able to find a mask that works for them. A major flood caused by a temporarily dislodged mask is easily drained by purging after replacing it in the correct position, and adjusting the straps if necessary. Lesser leaks will usually drain automatically from the mask through the exhaust valve of the demand valve or a purge valve fitted for that purpose as long as the mask is orientated with the valve at the low point. If there is too much water in the mask to allow inhalation it can usually be cleared using the purge button on the demand valve.

==History==
A full face diving mask was invented by Yves le Prieur in 1933.

The free-flow type of full-face mask is also sometimes referred to as a &quot;Jack Browne&quot; rig, named for a DESCO engineer who designed an early version of a full-face mask with a surface-supplied free-flow air supply.

<text>Zakarpattia Oblast (Ukrainian: Закарпатська область), also referred to as simply Zakarpattia (Ukrainian: Закарпаття; Hungarian: &quot;Kárpátalja&quot;) or Transcarpathia in English, is an oblast located in the Carpathian Mountains in west Ukraine, mostly coterminous with the historical region of Carpathian Ruthenia. Its administrative centre is the city of Uzhhorod. Other major cities within the oblast include Mukachevo, Khust, Berehove, and Chop, the last of which is home to railroad transport infrastructure.

Zakarpattia Oblast was established on 22 January 1946, after Czechoslovakia gave up its claim to the territory of Subcarpathian Ruthenia (Czech and also Slovak: Podkarpatská Rus) under a treaty between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. The territory of Subcarpathian Ruthenia was then taken over by the USSR and became part of the Ukrainian SSR.

During the Ukrainian independence referendum held in 1991, Zakarpatska Oblast voters were given a separate option on whether or not they favoured autonomy for the region. Although a large majority favoured autonomy, it was not granted. However, this referendum was about self-government status, not about autonomy (like in Crimea).

Situated in the Carpathian Mountains of western Ukraine, except the southwestern Hungarian-populated region that belongs to the Hungarian plain, Zakarpattia Oblast is the only Ukrainian administrative division which borders upon four countries: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania. As the Carpathians are an important tourist and travel destination (housing many ski and spa resorts), they play a major part in the oblast&#x27;s economy.

With a land area of almost , the oblast is ranked 23rd by area and 15th by population as according to the 2001 Ukrainian Census, the population of Zakarpatska Oblast was 1,254,614. The current population is This total includes people of many different nationalities of which Hungarians, Romanians, and Rusyns constitute significant minorities in some of the province&#x27;s cities, while in others, they form the majority of the population (as in the case of Berehove).

==Name==
The oblast&#x27;s name Zakarpattia (), which translates as &quot;Transcarpathian&quot; or literally &quot;beyond the Carpathians,&quot; refers to its location on the western side of the Carpathian Mountains, a major mountain range that forms an arc across Central and Southeast Europe. Due to this, the oblast is also often called Transcarpathian Oblast or Transcarpathia, although the historical region of Transcarpathia also includes areas outside the oblast, specifically small parts of Slovakia (mostly in Prešov Region and Košice Region) as well as Poland&#x27;s Lemko Region. Other historical names for both the oblast and broader region include Transcarpathian Ruthenia, Transcarpathian Ukraine, and Carpathian Ruthenia. The region is also sometimes referred to as &quot;Subcarpathian&quot; (which translates literally to &quot;below (or &quot;feet of&quot;) the Carpathians&quot;), such as in Subcarpathian Rus&#x27; and Subcarpathia. This name refers to the area&#x27;s location in the lower elevation Carpathian Basin (also known as the Pannonian Basin) and is also a reference to the largely overlapping physical geographical region of Prykarpattia (the Ukrainian name for Ciscarpathia), which encompasses the northeastern foothills of the Carpathian Mountains.

Many historical names included &quot;Rus&quot;&#x27; or &quot;Ruthenian&quot; when referring to the region because of the area&#x27;s large population of Rusyns (also known as &quot;Carpatho-Rusyns&quot;, &quot;Ruthenians&quot;, or &quot;Rusnaks&quot;), an East Slavic ethnic group that speaks the Rusyn language and descend from the original East Slavic population that had inhabited the northeastern regions of the Eastern Carpathians since the Early Middle Ages. Transcarpathian/Carpathian Ruthenia, Subcarpathian Rus&#x27;, and the Ukrainian diminutive name Rusinko are amongst some of the names that reference the Rusyn-speaking population.

The oblast has various names in other languages, including: 
*; 
*
* (translit. )
* (translit. )
*Rusyn: &quot;Закарпатська область&quot;
*

While the name &quot;Transcarpathia&quot; is a translation of the Ukrainian version of the name, the Hungarian name translates as &quot;Subcarpathia&quot;, in-line with the name of other Hungarian regions such as Alpokalja, a sub-Alpine territory in western Hungary. The &quot;Transcarpathia&quot; name and its variants instead reflect the East Slavic language practice of emphasizing the area&#x27;s location &quot;past&quot; or &quot;beyond&quot; the Carpathians (as opposed to &quot;below&quot;). Western European languages have variously translated from the Hungarian or East Slavic language versions of the name, with the English and French names generally deriving from the Hungarian &quot;Subcarpathia&quot;.

==History==

According to the Chronicon Pictum, the earliest state established in Zakarpattia was Ungvari in 677 AD. The name Ungvar derives from a migration of the Onogurs of Poltava who were ruled by the northern Kubiar sons of Kubrat. The Onogur tribes entered Etelköz through the Verecke Pass. Some of Ungvari&#x27;s Kubiars under Khan-Tuvan eventually joined the Rus&#x27; to form Rus&#x27; Khaganate. In the late 9th century Ungvari&#x27;s ruling Árpád dynasty began to fulfil their ambitions for the Carpathian basin where by 895 they had relocated to rule over the Magyars.

According to the Gesta Hungarorum, as Prince Álmos entered on the castle of &quot;Hung&quot; and there he appointed his son Árpád as the primary ruler, hence he was called of the leader of &quot;Hungvária&quot;, while all of his valiant soldiers as &quot;Hungvárus&quot;, so since then all the Magyars have been known by this name internationally.

In 895 the Hungarian tribes entered the Carpathian Basin from here through the Verecke pass, and the lands of Transcarpathia were influenced by the Principality of Hungary since 895, which transformed the Kingdom of Hungary in 1000. In Transcarpathia, the Voivodeship of Maramureș, granted to a small Romanian nobility, was established in 1343. The region was reorganized into the Máramaros County in 1402.

Since 1867, it was part of the Hungarian side of Austria-Hungary until the latter&#x27;s demise at the end of World War I. It approximately consisted of four Hungarian counties (comitatus): Bereg, Ung, Ugocsa and Maramaros. This region was briefly part of the short-lived West Ukrainian National Republic in 1918. The region was occupied by Romania by the end of that year, mostly the eastern portion such as Rakhiv and Khust. It was later recaptured by the Hungarian Soviet Republic in the summer of 1919. Finally, after the Treaty of Trianon of 1920 it became part of Czechoslovakia with a supposedly equal level of autonomy as the Slovak lands and Bohemia-Moravia-Czech Silesia (Czech lands).
The province has a unique footnote in history as the only region in the former Czechoslovakia to have had an American governor: its first governor was Gregory Zhatkovich, an American citizen who had earlier emigrated from the region and represented the Rusyn community in the U.S. Zhatkovich was appointed governor by Czechoslovakia&#x27;s first president, T. G. Masaryk in 1920, and served for about one year until he resigned over differences regarding the region&#x27;s autonomy. In 1928, it adopted the name of Subcarpathian Rus&#x27; (). Nevertheless, such autonomy was granted as late as in 1938, after detrimental events of the Munich Conference; until then this land was administered directly from Prague by the government-appointed provincial presidents (&#x27;) and/or elected governors (&#x27;).

Following the Munich Agreement, the southern part of the region was awarded to Hungary under the First Vienna Award in 1938. The remaining portion was constituted as an autonomous region of the short-lived Second Czechoslovak Republic. After the Slovak declaration of an independent state on 14 March, the next day Carpatho-Ukraine was proclaimed as an independent republic but was immediately occupied and annexed by Hungary, and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was proclaimed a day after. Voloshyn asked support for recognition in advance from Hitler, but received no answer. The state is known as &#x27;the one-day republic&#x27; because it did not exist more than one day. The military operations and the occupation of Carpatho-Ukraine was finished by the Hungarian troops on March 18.

The Hungarian invasion was followed by a few weeks of terror in which more than 27,000 people were shot dead without trial and investigation. Over 75,000 Ukrainians decided to seek asylum in the Soviet Union; of those almost 60,000 died in Gulag prison-camps. Others joined the Czechoslovak Army.
The major Jewish communities of the region had existed in Mukachevo, Ungvar, and Khust. During the German occupation of Hungary (March–December 1944), almost the entire Jewish population was deported; few survived the Holocaust.

In October 1944, the region was occupied by the Red Army. On 26 November 1944, the First Congress of People&#x27;s Committees of Zakarpattia Ukraine took place in Mukachevo, and sham elections were organized on 10–25 November 1944. On 29 June 1945, Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš, seeking to postpone the inevitable incorporation of Czechoslovakia into the Soviet Bloc, signed a treaty formally ceding the area to the Soviet Union, and the next month it was united with the Ukrainian SSR through the &quot;Manifest for unification with Soviet Ukraine&quot; that was accepted by the 1st Congress of People&#x27;s Committees of Sub-Carpathian Ukraine without any knowledge or approval of the common people. It was then annexed into the Soviet Union as Zakarpattia Oblast.

=== Zakarpattia in the Soviet Union ===
Between 1945 and 1947, the new Soviet authorities fortified the new borders, and in July 1947 declared Transcarpathia as &quot;restricted zone of the highest level&quot;, with checkpoints on the mountain passes connecting the region to mainland Ukraine.

In December 1944, the National Council of Transcarpatho-Ukraine set up a special people&#x27;s tribunal in Uzhgorod to try and condemn all collaborationists with the previous governments – both Hungary and Carpatho-Ukraine. The court was allowed to hand down either 10 years of forced labour, or death penalty. Several Ruthenian leaders, including and , were condemned and executed in May 1946. Avgustyn Voloshyn also died in prison. The extent of the repression showed to many Carpatho-Ruthenian activists that it was not possible to find an accommodation with the coming Soviet regime as it had been with all previous ones.

After breaking the Greek Catholic Church in Eastern Galicia in 1946, Soviet authorities pushed for the return to Orthodoxy of Greek-Catholic parishes in Transcarpathia too, including by engineering the accident and death of recalcitrant bishop Theodore Romzha on 1 November 1947. In January 1949, the Greek Catholic Eparchy of Mukachevo was declared illegal; remaining priests and nuns were arrested, and church properties were nationalised and parcelled for public use or lent to the Russian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) as the only accepted religious authority in the region.

Cultural institutions were also forbidden, including the russophile Dukhnovych Society, the ukrainophile Prosvita, and the Subcarpathian Scholarly Society. New books and publications were circulated, including the &quot;Zakarpatsk″a Pravda&quot; (130,000 copies). The Uzhhorod National University was opened in 1945. Over 816 cinemas were open by 1967 to insure the indoctrination of the population with Marxist-Leninist propaganda. The Ukrainian language was the first language of instruction in schools throughout the region, followed by Russian, which was extensively used at the university level. Most new generations had a passive knowledge of the Rusyn language, but no knowledge about local culture. XIX-century Rusyn intellectuals were labelled as &quot;members of the reactionary class and instruments of Vatican obscurantism&quot;. The Rusyn anthem and hymn were banned from public performance. Carpatho-Rusyn folk culture and songs, which were promoted, were presented as part of Transcarpathian regional culture as a local variant of Ukrainian culture.

As early as 1924, the Comintern had declared all East Slavic inhabitants of Czechoslovakia (Rusyns, Carpatho-Russians, Rusnaks) to be Ukrainians. As of the 1946 census, all Rusyns were recorded as Ukrainians; anyone clinging to the old label was considered a separatist and a potential counter-revolutionary.

Already in February 1945, the National Council proceeded to confiscate 53,000 hectares of land from big landowners and redistribute it to 54,000 peasant households (37% of the population). Forced collectivisation of land started in 1946; around 2,000 peasants were arrested during protests in 1948–49 and sent for forced labour in the Gulag. Collectivisation, including of mountain shepherds, was completed by May 1950. Central planning decisions set Transcarpathia to become a &quot;land of orchards and vineyards&quot; between 1955 and 1965, planting 98,000 hectares with little results. Attempts to cultivate tea and citrus also failed due to climate. Most vineyards were uprooted twenty years later, during Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s anti-alcohol campaign in 1985–87.

The Soviet period also meant the upscaling of industrialisation in Transcarpathia. State-owned lumber mills, chemical and food-processing plants widened, with Mukachevo&#x27;s tobacco factory and Solotvyno&#x27;s salt works as the biggest ones, providing steady employment to the residents of the region, beyond the traditional subsistence agriculture. And while traditional labour migration routes to the fields of Hungary or the factories of the North-West United States were now closed, Carpathian Ruthens and Romanians could now move for seasonal work in Russia&#x27;s North and East.

The inhabitants of the oblast grew steadily in the Soviet period, from 776,000 in 1946 to over 1,2 million in 1989. Uzhgorod increased its residents five-fold, from 26,000 to 117,000, and Mukachevo likewise from 26,600 to 84,000. This population increase also reflected demographic changes. The arrival of the Red Army meant the departure of 5,100 Magyars and 2,500 Germans, while the 15–20,000 Jews survivors of the Holocaust also decided to move out before the borders were sealed. By 1945, around 30,000 Hungarians and Germans had been interned and sent for labour camps in Eastern Ukraine and Siberia; while amnestied in 1955, around 5,000 did not come back. In January 1946, 2,000 more Germans were deported. In return, a large number of Ukrainians and Russians moved to Transcarpathia, where they found jobs in the industry, the military, or the civilian administration. By 1989, around 170,000 Ukrainians (mainly from nearby Galizia) and 49,000 Russians were living in Transcarpathia, mainly in new residential blocks in the main towns of Uzhgorod and Mukachevo, where the dominant language had soon turned from Hungarian and Yiddish to Russian. They kept being considered newcomers (&quot;novoprybuli&quot;) due to their disconnect from the Rusyn- and Hungarian-speaking countryside.

=== Zakarpattia in independent Ukraine ===
After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine held an independence referendum in which the residents of Zakarpattia were asked about the Zakarpattia Oblast Council&#x27;s proposal for self-rule. About 78% of the oblast&#x27;s population voted in favour of autonomy; however, it was not granted.

At the first Presidential elections in Ukraine in 1991, voters from Transcarpathia supported Leonid Kravchuk by 58%.
At the 1994 Ukrainian parliamentary election, Transcarpathia elected 9 independent MPs over 11 to the Rada. The same year, voters in the region supported the incumbent Leonid Kravchuk over Leonid Kuchma by 70.5%
At the 1998 Ukrainian parliamentary election, Transcarpathia turned out to be one of the strongholds (together with Kyiv and L&#x27;viv) of Viktor Medvedchuk&#x27;s Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united), which back then ran on a moderate Ukrainian nationalist ideology.
One year later, at the Presidential elections, Transcarpathian voters supported the re-election of Leonid Kuchma by 85%.

At the 2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election, voters from Transcapathia supported the Our Ukraine Bloc, in line with voters from all Western Ukraine. 
At the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, Transcarpathians voted in majority for Viktor Yushchenko.
At the 2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election, voters from Transcapathia supported the Our Ukraine Bloc and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc, in line with voters in Ciscarpatian East Galizia.
At the 2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election, the Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc linked with former President Viktor Yushchenko won in most of the region, while the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc came out first in Uzhhorod and its raion.

On 7 March 2007, the Zakarpattia Oblast Council recognized the Rusyn ethnicity.

On October 25, 2008, 100 delegates to the Congress of Carpathian Ruthenians declared the formation of the &quot;Republic of Carpathian Ruthenia&quot;. The prosecutor&#x27;s office of Zakarpattia region filed a case against priest Dymytrii Sydor and Yevhen Zhupan (members of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) in Ukraine and in close relations with the Russkiy Mir Foundation), an Our Ukraine deputy of the Zakarpattia regional council and chairman of the People&#x27;s Council of Ruthenians, on charges of encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine. On May 1, 2009, National Union Svoboda blocked the holding of the third European congress of the Carpathian Ruthenians, a pro-Russian entity.
At the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election, Yulia Tymoshenko won in most raions of Transcarpathia save for Mukachevo, Berehove and Vynohradiv, where Viktor Yanukovych gained a majority.

In the 2010 and 2015 local elections, the United Centre won majorities in Transcarpathia. The 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election saw both the United Centre and the Party of Regions win districts in Transcarpathia.

In the 2014 presidential election, Transcarpathia helped elect Petro Poroshenko as president of Ukraine. Turnout in the east of the region was among the lowest in Ukraine, below 40%, while it reached 65% in its west.
At the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election, electoral results in Transcarpathia saw districts being won by Arseniy Yatsenyuk&#x27;s People&#x27;s Front and by the Petro Poroshenko Bloc.

Ukraine&#x27;s 2017 education law makes Ukrainian the required language of study in state schools. Since 2017, relations between Ukraine and Hungary rapidly deteriorated over the issue of the Hungarian minority in Ukraine.

Transcaparthian voters supported Volodymyr Zelensky for president of Ukraine at the 2019 elections.

At the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election, president Zelensky&#x27;s Servant of the People party won a plurality in Transcarpathia. Electoral turnout in the region was the lowest in the country (&lt;42.5%)

==Geography==
The Zakarpattia Oblast has a total area of and is located on southwestern slopes and foothills of the Carpathian Mountains covering around 80% of area in the region. The rest of the region is covered by the Transcarpathian Lowland which is part of the Pannonian plain. Zakarpattia is the only Ukrainian oblast to have boundaries with four countries: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. On the West it borders the Prešov and Košice Regions of Slovakia and Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén and Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg Counties of Hungary, on the South—the Satu Mare and Maramureș Counties of Romania, on the East and Northeast—Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, and on the North—Lviv Oblast and the Subcarpathian Voivodeship of Poland.

The Zakarpattia Oblast mostly consists of mountains and small hills covered with deciduous and coniferous forests, as well as alpine meadows. Mountains cover about 80% of the oblast&#x27;s area, and cross from North-West to South-East.

==Administrative divisions==

On 18 July 2020, the number of raions (districts) was reduced to six.

Zakarpattia Oblast was previously subdivided into 13 raions (districts), as well as 5 cities (municipalities) which are directly subordinate to the oblast government: Berehove (Beregszász), Chop (Csap), Khust, Mukachevo, and the administrative centre of the oblast, Uzhhorod. There are a total of 11 cities, 19 towns, and more than 579 villages.

Zakarpattia Oblast incorporates four unofficial geographic-historic regions (counties): Ung, Bereg, Ugocsa and Northern Maramureș. There is a project for a reform of the current administrative division of the Oblast

Administrative centres of raions may be located within a city of regional importance, while such city is not technically a part of the raion.

Each raion is subdivided into radas (councils). Cities and towns (urban-type settlements) all have own individual councils, while villages and rural settlements may be formed into multiple settlements councils or an individual village council. A city of regional significance may consist of an individual populated place or be complex of several settlements (the city proper and suburbs) which are governed by their own rada (council). All cities are either of regional importance or of district importance.

Villages:
*Batrad
*Halabor

==Symbols==
The coat of arms of Zakarpattia was originally created in the end of the 1920s in the then-Czechoslovakia. The oblast&#x27;s flag was approved at the XXIII plenary session of the Transcarpathian Regional Council. The coat of arms on the flag also appears on the Rusyn flag. The anthem of the Transcarpathian region is a folk musical work arranged by M. Keretsman to a poem attributed by some researchers to Oleksandr Dukhnovych, to the music of controversial Transcarpathian politician (according to other sources, Stepan Fentsyk himself is the author of the words). The Transcarpathian Regional Council approved the anthem of the Transcarpathian region on 22 December 2009.

<text>Boys Be... (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese anthology manga series written by Masahiro Itabashi and illustrated by Hiroyuki Tamakoshi. Three different manga series were serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot;: &quot;Boys Be...&quot; (1991–1996), &quot;Boys Be... 2nd Season&quot; (1996–2000), and &quot;Boys Be... L Co-op&quot; (2000–2001), totaling 58 volumes. Four other manga series have been published: &quot;Boys Be... Pre-season&quot; (2009), &quot;Boys Be... Next Season&quot; (2009–2012), &quot;Boys Be… Adult Season&quot; (2012–2013), and &quot;Boys Be... Young Adult&quot; (2017–2018). In North America, the second manga series was licensed by Tokyopop.

A 13-episode anime television series by Hal Film Maker was broadcast on Wowow in 2000. The anime series was licensed for English release in North America by The Right Stuf International.

==Overview==
&quot;Boys Be...&quot; is an anthology series of short romantic comedy stories. The title refers to the quote &quot;Boys, be ambitious&quot;, said by William S. Clark, which has become a popular motto in Japan.

The series focuses upon the ups and downs, joys and sorrows of first love and teenage romance. While several characters are taken from stories in the manga series, the story of the anime is unrelated to the manga. Each episode begins and ends with a philosophical quote which sums up the episode&#x27;s content. The anime, while centered on Kyoichi and Chiharu, revolves around seven or eight main characters and their love lives.

:A typical high school student who, in the opening episode, realizes he has feelings for a childhood friend, a track star named Chiharu Nitta. Their relationship develops slowly in the series, however, it encounters some turbulence when he goes out of the area to do some summer work, and upon coming back, sees Chiharu kissing another guy. Kyochi is broken hearted and has a brief relationship with Shoko Sayama and dealt with loneliness with the help of another schoolmate. His interests are in the visual arts, mainly drawing. In the final episode, he travels to Hokkaido to clear his mind and work on some sketches, and get a new perspective on relationships.
:
:Yoshihiko is talented in sports (especially baseball), but has no interest in it whatsoever. He also seems to have no interest in girls... until he bumped into Aya Kurihara at the library and kisses her. He meets Natsue Horikawa, who inspires him to keep pursuing baseball and, in getting to know her, and more of himself, they become a couple. He also spent a whole day with pop idol Jyunna Morio when she escaped from her studio taping.
:
:Makoto is the epitome of a girl-obsessed guy, keeping an electronic database of the good-looking girls at Otowa-no-Mori with him, and checking with his guide books and magazines for love advice. Early in the series, he was trying to peep at a short-skirted schoolgirl as she was climbing the stairs of an overpass, and his scooter crashed into a mini-truck. He then had a crush on the nurse intern. Later on, he used a computer dating program which paired him up with Erika Kawai. Since he lacked real dating experience, Makoto went on a mock date with Yumi. However, his actual date does not go well, when Erika sees a photo of him together with Yumi, and promptly dumps him. Makoto ends up being comforted by Yumi when she offers him her self-made cookies, and he realizes that they had a good time together during the mock date, and they end up becoming a couple.
:
:Chiharu is Kyoichi&#x27;s athletic love interest, running for their school&#x27;s track and field team. She has been Kyoichi&#x27;s friend since childhood, but she also has difficulty expressing love, eventually making her move at the end of the first episode by holding Kyoichi&#x27;s hand while they are out. When she goes out to summer training with the track team, she is wooed by a college guy named Okazaki, and struggles with whether she really has a relationship with Kyoichi. Okazaki continued his advances to which they spent a night together at a lookout point, though she says nothing happened between them. She wanted to keep her tryst a secret, but Kyoichi, coming in to visit, saw them kissing, hence a rift formed between them that lasted all summer. Towards the end of the series, as she sees her friends get into relationships, she considers whether to reconcile.
:
:Yumi is a glasses girl with a sarcastic attitude on relationships, usually to counter her friend Aki&#x27;s idealistic sayings. She likes to occasionally dress in odd clothes, such as a sea otter costume at the beach and an animal hat during New Year&#x27;s Eve. After accidentally destroying Makoto&#x27;s laptop, she tries to train Makoto on how to date her friend Erika Kawai, and even goes on a mock date where she holds up X signs and razzes Makoto whenever he makes a mistake. But in the course of the mock date, she realizes she is having a good time, that Makoto has some good qualities, and she ends up falling in love, feeling somewhat lonely that Erika gets to date him for real. However, as fate would have it, Makoto&#x27;s date with Erika did not go well, and she ends up comforting him with her self-baked cookies, and they ended up being a couple.
:
:Aki has a rather idealistic view of romance. In the opening episode, she talks about how she fell in love with a guy on the train in two minutes. In one of the episodes, she reunites with her former middle-school classmate that she used to spend a bunch of time with on his photography hobby and who was totally clueless that she liked him. Her boyfriend is now working in Hokkaido, and they maintain a long-distance relationship. In the New Year&#x27;s Eve episode, she gets worried that the world might really end.

:
:When Makoto broke his leg due to a scooter accident, he was confined to the hospital where Mizuki was an intern, and she became his nurse. At first, Makoto&#x27;s crush on her causes trouble as she makes embarrassing mistakes in front of her superiors. Eventually she warms up to him.
:
:A female student who had a run-in with Yoshihiko when he looked for a ball that went through the library&#x27;s window. When he crawled to look for it, he knocked the stool where she was standing while putting a book back into its proper shelf. He caught her and unintentionally got a feel of her &quot;lumpy&quot; side, but she was grateful for the rescue, and rewarded him with a kiss on the lips. The potential romance was cut short when she transferred back to France, as she was just an exchange student, and Yoshihiko learned the kissing is just a European custom, although it turns out Aya has a different view on the romance.
:
:Tsuyoshi was a classmate of Aki from their third year of junior high. He has a passion for photography, and often spends long hours for the perfect shot, bringing Aki along. But in high school, he lost his passion for photography, until he meets Aki again and she puts some sense into him. They form a long-distance relationship, and he is now working in Hokkaido. His inspiration is none other than Aki herself.
:
:He is Chiharu&#x27;s cousin and Nao&#x27;s overprotective brother, and is Kyoichi&#x27;s and Makoto&#x27;s boss at the summer resort. He is so overprotective (because of her frail health) that he did not see his beloved sister grow up. Mostly he is in conflict with the fresh Makoto.

Trouble is, she is a girl, and girls are not allowed to participate in the tournament. This girl with immature emotional swings did guide Yoshihiko out of his disinterest in the sport, and they become a couple.
:
:He is the charming young man Chiharu Nitta met during summer training camp. He is a city slicker with a beat for nature and many hobbies such as collecting beetles and fishing. At first Chiharu shrugged him off, but because she was lonely, and she is in a fight with Kyoichi, she nearly gave in. Though he had a girlfriend waiting in the city, he continued his advances and managed to make Chiharu fall for him, though, during a date at a spot overlooking the city, Chiharu says nothing happened between them.
:
:She is a renegade student hoping to make it big in the music business. She and Kyoichi get involved after she recruits him to retrieve her confiscated minidisc player. During the time with Kyoichi, she was planning to audition for lead singer in a J-pop band, but loses confidence when she sees a younger rival. She asks Kyoichi out one night, but he does notcome, and she wanders the street soul searching. At the end of the series, she is on the radio with her latest single called &quot;Hatsukoi&quot; (First Love).
:
:Erika is a good friend of Yumi&#x27;s and the girl that Makoto&#x27;s latest matchmaking software selected. Erika comes from a fairly wealthy family and supposedly has refined tastes according to Yumi. Erika and Makoto go on a date, but she notices Makoto has a lot of notes from &quot;training&quot; with Yumi, and that Yumi really does like Makoto, so she quickly dumps him.
:
:Takuya is a schoolmate of Kyoichi, and they work together part-time at the video shop. He wears a cross-shaped earring, which Kyoichi notices after he has been hounded by the same dream involving windmills and downed airplanes. Though soft-spoken and one of the most handsome men at his school, Takuya does nothave a girlfriend, though he was interested in someone. He is so shy he drowns in loneliness, but found the courage to express what he feels for that someone. Makoto thought Kyoichi is getting desperate when he notices he was spending too much time with him.
:
:She is a famous pop idol. Her image is plastered on everything from TV commercials selling bottled water to magazine covers. Yoshihiko mistakes her for a generic girl in a Santa suit distributing flyers. For the rest of the day, Yoshihiko became her unwitting &quot;reindeer&quot; . Earlier in the series, Yoshihiko and his girlfriend Natsue went to one of her concerts.
; / Biker Girl
:She is a Japanese-Finnish girl that Kyoichi met when he travel to Hokkaido, acting as his impromptu tourist guide that &quot;charge one kiss per transaction.&quot; She is more flirtatious, more daring, and freer than the Chiharu he knows, and rides a Harley-Davidson Softail motorcycle.

==Reception==
===Manga===
By 2022, the manga had over 25 million copies in circulation.

Reviewing Tokyopop&#x27;s first volume for &quot;Anime Fringe&quot;, Patrick King commended the realism and depth of the characters and Hiroyuki&#x27;s art style as well, stating: &quot;&quot;Boys Be&quot; is a refreshing series that was written for guys seeking a little romance manga of their own. In that regard, it is easily worth a look if you&#x27;re one such guy&quot;, noting, however, that the stories could appeal to female readers as well. In &quot;&quot;, Jason Thompson commented: &quot;Most of the stories involve kisses or love confessions, or are excuses for women to pose in scanty outfits, but the hero does not always get the girl, and a few of the stories are impressively funny.&quot; Thompson also said that the art &quot;improves as it goes on,&quot; adding, however, that &quot;the repetitive character designs make it difficult to tell one girl from the others.&quot; In a more negative review, Johanna Draper Carlson of &quot;Comics Worth Reading&quot; criticized the series for its repetitiveness, formulaic stories and fanservice, stating as well that the female characters, except for hair length, look alike.

===Anime===
Writing for &quot;Anime News Network&quot;, Patrick King commented that the series is &quot;frequently tender, but never mushy. Its female stars are attractive, but they&#x27;re not pin-ups, nor do they jiggle without reason. Romance and humor are deftly intertwined in this series, but it is not a standard romantic comedy,&quot; adding that the series &quot;depicts the &quot;normal&quot; world quite well, but this show is far from average.&quot; Theron Martin from the same website, said that it is &quot;hardly a dynamic series, and doesn&#x27;t have much for ongoing plot,&quot; but highlighted the &quot;honest, character-driven stories which feel real and avoid going to silly or angsty extremes&quot;. Martin said that the series&#x27; called the series &quot;unsuitable for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have a fair amount of patience, but those that do will find a pleasant and likable slice-of-life series free of the normal anime gimmicks.&quot; Chris Beveridge of &quot;AnimeOnDVD&quot;, made a positive review of the series, stating that it &quot;consistently brought a smile to our face throughout it. Remembrances of experiences past and the ring of real world truth to much of it makes this something that people can connect to in a way they can&#x27;t with a lot of other anime.&quot; 

Enoch Lau of &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot; praised the stories and characters, stating that while they are &quot;slightly stereotyped&quot;, they have a &quot;down-to-earth appeal to the viewer.&quot; Lau also commended the soundtrack and varied range of music. On the other hand, he criticized the art, stating that it is &quot;rather inconsistent when it comes to character design and sometimes gets a bit too simple,&quot; and its short duration. In a more mixed review, Jeff Harris of &quot;IGN&quot; stated that the series&#x27; relationship drama is at times &quot;seriously overdone and rather sappy,&quot; and that it &quot;disappoints more often than not.&quot; Harris concluded: &quot;&quot;Boys Be&quot; is a pretty harmless but overall, a rather tame and vanilla romance anime. The show leaves way too much unsaid, and it feels like barely any progression is made in the story.&quot;

<text>Kyiv Oblast (, ), also called Kyivshchyna (, ), is an oblast (province) in central and northern Ukraine. It surrounds, but does not include, the city of Kyiv, which is administered as a city with special status. However, Kyiv also serves as the administrative center of the oblast. The Kyiv metropolitan area extends out from Kyiv city into parts of the oblast, which is significantly dependent on the urban economy and transportation of Kyiv.

The population of Kyiv Oblast is Its largest city is Bila Tserkva, with a population over 200,000.

Kyiv Oblast was created as part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on February 27, 1932 among the first five original oblasts in Ukraine. It was established on territory that had been known as Ruthenian land.

Earlier historical administrative units that became the territory of the oblast include the Kiev Voivodeship under the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Kiev Viceroyalty and Kiev Governorate under the Russian Empire. The northern part of the oblast belongs to the historical region of Polesia (&quot;Polissia&quot;).

In Kyiv region, there was a specific folk icon-painting style much influenced by the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra painting school. Saints were depicted on the deep purple or black background, their clothes dark, their haloes dark blue, dark green or even black, outlined by thin white dotted contours. The Kyiv region&#x27;s icons collection is the part of the exhibition of the Museum of Ukrainian home icons in the Historical and cultural complex &quot;The Radomysl Castle&quot;.

The current borders of the oblast were set following the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. Administrative oversight of the new city of Slavutych, which was constructed as part of the Chernihiv Oblast, was then transferred to the Kyiv Oblast (&quot;see Chernobyl zone below&quot;).

<doc id="494886" wikidata="Q1366445" url="?curid=494886" title="Spitz (band)">
<text>is a Japanese rock band. The group was originally formed in 1987 by four art school students in Tokyo; it consists of Masamune Kusano (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), Tetsuya Miwa (lead guitar), Akihiro Tamura (bass guitar), and Tatsuo Sakiyama (drums).

In March 1991, Spitz released their first single &quot;Hibari no Kokoro&quot; and the self-titled debut album simultaneously on Polydor Records. Although their early efforts failed to attract public attention, the band eventually came into prominence with the single &quot;Robinson&quot; released in April 1995 which sold more than 1.6 million copies in Japan. It was followed by their 6th studio album &quot;Hachimitsu&quot;, which was released the same year and achieved mainstream success, immediately topping the Japanese Oricon charts and selling approximately 1.7 million copies. It won the Best Album award in the 37th Japan Record Awards by the Japanese Composers Association on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1995, and received a quadruple platinum status from the Recording Industry Association of Japan in 1997.

After their breakthrough in the mid 1990s, Spitz has sustained commercial success in Japanese market for nearly 20 years. They have been listed in the top 30 of the best-selling music acts in history of the Japanese record charts, having sold over 20.8 million copies albums and singles domestically as of December 2013.

Throughout their recording career, the band have released over 20 studio albums and over 40 physical singles. Most of their music has a jangly pop-rock sound, featuring arpeggiated guitar work. They are noted for their melodic compositions, imaginative lyrics, and clear high-pitched vocals by the group&#x27;s singer-songwriter Kusano.

==About Spitz==
Spitz&#x27;s musical style is influenced by Donovan, using electric guitar played with arpeggio, and a steady rhythm. Their simple melodies are influenced by popular songs and use Kusano&#x27;s soft voice.

The band&#x27;s name was proposed by Kusano and means &quot;sharp and pointed&quot; in German. Kusano liked the &quot;sp&quot; sound (as in &quot;special&quot; or &quot;crispy&quot;). He had wanted to use this name since he was a high school student. Their fan club, Spitzbergen, is named after the Norwegian island Spitsbergen.

In 1995, the album &quot;Hachimitsu&quot; sold more than one million copies and became very popular. After that, the singles and also became million sellers.

Spitz have repeatedly stated that they deeply value their connection with their audience. Their policy is not to give a performance at a stage bigger than an ordinary concert hall. After becoming a famous band, Kusano said &quot;We are not thinking of giving a performance at Nippon Budokan.&quot; However, he also said &quot;I didn’t say we won’t do it forever.&quot;

==History==

===1986–1990: Formation and early years===
In spring 1986, Tokyo Zokei University students Masamune Kusano and Akihiro Tamura met for the first time. Along with fellow drummer Atsushi Ono, they formed the band called the Cheetahs, which was named after the nickname of 1960s Japanese female pop icon Kiyoko Suizenji. The trio had usually performed hard rock-renditions of the Japanese kayokyoku and folk-rock tunes from the 1960s and 70s, such as &quot;365-Ho no March&quot; (Suizenji&#x27;s signature song) and &quot;Ichigo Hakusho o Mo Ichido&quot; (a song written by Yumi Arai and originally recorded by the Bang Bang). To focus on the stage performance as a frontman, Kusano recruited another guitarist Taku Nishiwaki, and then the band changed its name to the Spitz. However, after the vocalist transferred from Tokyo Zokei University to Musashino Art University, the band itself broke up .

After transferring colleges, Kusano continued his friendship with Tamura, frequently playing Nintendo video games with each other. Attempting to form a band again, Tamura brought Tetsuya Miwa, who had been his longtime friend since junior high school, on as a bass player. Miwa, who was a student of Bunka Fashion College, also took his old friend Tatsuo Sakiyama into company as a drummer, who had been in the same folk song club at his art school. All four members of Spitz had gathered by 1988, and they have gone on working together without any lineup changes.

From 1988, Spitz started performing gigs at live houses in Tokyo, such as Shinjuku Jam, and Shibuya Yaneura. Kusano was deeply influenced by The Blue Hearts, one of the most successful and influential Japanese punk rock band at the time, both artistically and musically. He had apparently tried to imitate Hiroto Komoto&#x27;s idiosyncratic stage presence and vocalizations, on the band&#x27;s earliest live performances or recordings. A club manager of Shibuya La Mama considered Spitz was just a faceless rip-off of The Blue Hearts. He suggested to the group that they should establish their own artistic identity, or else they would never go anywhere. Afterwards, Kusano stopped acting or writing like Komoto and Masatoshi Mashima, and adapted to acoustic guitar-driven sound that matched with his own wide-ranged soft voice. Songs like &quot;Ai no Uta&quot; and &quot;Hibari no Kokoro&quot; which were officially released, are the earliest materials that Kusano wrote after changing his style of music.

In November 1988, Spitz dropped the self-published single entitled &quot;Tori ni Natte&quot;/&quot;UFO no Mieru Oka&quot; on phonosheet. In 1989, they finally realized their dream of performing live on stage of Shinjuku Loft, a famed live house in Japan at the time. On July 12, 1990, the band performed a solo gig there for the first time, in front of an audience of 300 people. In March 1990, they released the EP entitled &quot;Hibari no Kokoro&quot; independently on a Mistral label distributed by Shinjuku Loft. It was co-recorded by a then-unknown producer Ryo Yoshimata on keyboards.

By around 1990, some A&amp;R people noticed the band&#x27;s talent and tried to contract with them. Due to a reluctance to be controlled by a record company, the group rejected to deal with any major record labels, until they found the proper artist management agency. In summer 1990, Spitz built up a business partnership with Road &amp; Sky, the management for a multi-million selling singer-songwriter Shogo Hamada, and signed to Polydor Japan shortly afterwards.

===1991–1992===
On March 25, 1991, Spitz released their eponymous debut album. Its closing track &quot;Hibari no Kokoro&quot;, remake version of the title track for their independent EP, was issued as a single on the same day. In the following month, the album cut &quot;Ninoude no Sekai&quot; got heavy airplay on radio stations in Osaka. Except for a number of shows　in small venues, they mainly concentrated on studio work for the rest of that year. Their second LP &quot;Namae o Tsuketeyaru&quot; came out just 9 months later from its predecessor, followed by their first concert tour started from February 1992.

In April 1992, they released a collection of five new songs (in Japan, those type of releases have been commonly categorized as &#x27;mini album&#x27; rather than &#x27;EP&#x27;) entitled &quot;Aurora ni Narenakatta Hito no Tame ni&quot; and embarked on its accompanying tour. This symphonic rock-oriented EP was featuring orchestration by its co-producer Tomoki Hasegawa, who previously undertook the strings arrangement of &quot;Majo Tabi ni Deru&quot;, the lead single from their second studio album. In the same year, they recorded their third full-length album &quot;Hoshi no Kakera&quot; which came out only 5-month after. It mostly features distorted guitar sound heavily influenced by grunge and shoegazing.

During this period, neither their singles nor albums even reached inside the top 100 on national record charts. Even worse, despite extensive recording sessions and prolific releases they underwent at that time, the band suffered from declining record sales.

===1993–1996: Commercial breakthrough===
Although they had not originally wanted a mainstream success, members of the band had begun to feel sorry for their management team about a string of commercial disappointment. Therefore, they attempted to craft more commercially &#x27;accessible&#x27; effort on &quot;Crispy&quot;, their 4th album which started its recording in April 1993. The group committed their album&#x27;s production to Masanori Sasaji, who has been well known as a record producer for the Unicorn. However, owing to lack of communication between the artist and a producer, frontman was not able to be satisfied with a result of the recording, particularly disliking Sasaji&#x27;s excessively synthesized sound and brass arrangements. Moreover, at the time of release in September 1993, &quot;Crispy&quot; itself failed to chart again and made them devastated. Kusano, who had disliked his own voice, even started to regard his distinctive vocals as the main cause of the band&#x27;s commercial failure. But after the release of second single from the album, &quot;Kimi ga Omoide ni Naru Mae ni&quot;, the situation turned around. It sold modestly and provided the band with first entry on the Japanese Oricon record chart, peaking there at No. 33. As a result, minor hit single boosted the band&#x27;s ticket sales and enabled them to perform live extensively in larger venues. They reconsidered the partnership with Sasaji, and decided to continue recording together on follow-up album.

In April and July 1994, with as producer, the singles &quot;Sora mo Toberuhazu&quot; and were released and became smash hits. In September, when they installed Sasaji as producer again, they released the 5th album , which ranked 14th when just released. By the way, this year they appeared in Music Station (TV Asahi’s program) with &quot;Kimi ga Omoide ni Naru Mae ni&quot;, in Pop Jam (NHK’s program) with &quot;Aoi Kuruma&quot;, in Count Down TV (TBS’s program) with &quot;Spider&quot;.

In April of the following year, they released the single which placed among the top 10 of the Oricon Charts for the first time and sales exceeded 1.6 million. It ranked in 9th overall in the year. It became a long time seller, which stayed in the top 10 charts for over 30 weeks. In July, the single also ranked 2nd when just released and its sales were 98,000. At first they couldn&#x27;t realize these great hits. It was not until they appeared in &quot;Meet the World Beat &#x27;95&quot; at the Expo in Osaka in July that the members realized they really became stars after hearing great cheers from the audience. In September, they released their 6th album which became a million seller. In October, they started their first long-term tour, and they performed over 40 concerts. In January, the following year, &quot;Sora mo Toberu Hazu&quot; was used as the theme song of Fuji TV network&#x27;s drama . It became a revival hit and ranked No. 1 in Oricon Charts for the first time as a single. More than 1.5 million copies were sold. (The members say this bewildered them.) In April, the single &quot;Cherry&quot; was also a huge hit with sales of 1,610,000 copies. In October, they released their 7th album and started a lengthy tour, which has as many as 70 concerts.

===1997–2000===
By 1997 (their 10th anniversary) Sasaji withdrew as their producer and all the members were in their thirties. Since they felt they couldn&#x27;t depend on keeping their producers forever, they determined to stand on their own feet. They began to wonder if they should change the band&#x27;s course. The band disliked the fact that they had taken on a conventional, orthodox image. So, they held in Osaka, which became an annual event. They performed a secret live concert at Shinjuku Loft where they mainly played their amateur days’ songs. In March 1998, joined them as a co-arranger, and they released their self-produced 8th album . In May 1998, , the keyboardist, joined the all-over-Japan concert tours, and came to be an essential supporting member of their tours since then. During the tour, in August, they recorded , and with Kuji, which were collected in the album &quot;99ep&quot;.

In March 1999, they compiled some unreleased tracks and released a special album entitled with producer　Ryomei Shirai (白井良明). In July of the same year, they appeared in &quot;Meet the World Beet&quot; in Osaka again. Although they didn&#x27;t have plans to release new single at that time, they recorded by themselves inside or outside Japan from September to October. They brought (already tracked down) and to the United States. After recording and , they mixed them down in Miami and mastered them in Los Angeles. Stephen Mackersen, who was in charge of mastering then, would become a necessary engineer for Spitz since 2000, except several singles.

While the members were in America, the recording company decided to sell a &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation album. The members had no intention of releasing a &quot;best of&quot; album until after their break-up or retirement. However, despite their reluctance, the album &quot;Recycle: Greatest Hits of Spitz&quot; was released in December of that year. In the end, it became a very successful album with the sales of more than two million copies. However, officially, the band did not recognize the album and did not include the CD in their official discography.

In 2000, they hired as producer and started recording a new album in earnest. The members said it was a big stimulus to cooperate with a contemporary. In July of the year, they released 9th album , which is distinguished by its harder rock styling and changed their conventional image. They toured for one year with more than 100 performances.

===2001–present===
After Sasaji&#x27;s withdrawal, their producer varied with their work, but they installed Seiji Kameda as producer, who is known as a producer of Ringo Shiina since 2001 and himself is a bassist in Tokyo Jihen. In September 2002, they released the 10th album , which recovered the melody peculiar to Spitz, along with the rock sound of the previous album.

Although they didn&#x27;t release any singles in 2003, was played on TV as the theme song of &quot;Ainori&quot; from that autumn; it was released in January 2004 to rank 1st in Oricon chart and get many fans. In March 2004, they gathered the songs which hadn&#x27;t appeared in any albums since 1999 and released special album . In January of the following year 2005, they also released the 11th album .

In March 2006, when 15 years had passed since their debut, they released an official single collection album &quot;Cycle Hit Spitz Complete Single Collection&quot;. The following year marked their 20th anniversary of organization, and they held . They released the 12th album in October and went on an all-over-Japan tour from December onwards. Their thirteenth album, , was released in October 2010.

<text>Donetsk Oblast, also referred to as Donechchyna (, ), is an oblast in eastern Ukraine. It is Ukraine&#x27;s most populous province, with around 4.1 million residents. Its administrative centre is Donetsk, though due to the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War, the regional administration was moved to Kramatorsk. Historically, the region has been an important part of the Donbas region. From its creation in 1938 until November 1961, it bore the name &quot;Stalino Oblast&quot;, in honour of Joseph Stalin. As part of the de-Stalinization process, it was renamed after the Donets river, the main artery of Eastern Ukraine. Its population is estimated at 

The oblast is known for its urban sprawl of Donetsk–Makiivka and Horlivka–Yenakiieve and it is often associated with the coal mining industry.

In 2014, parts of the oblast, including Donetsk, came under the control of Russian-backed separatists who declared the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic, leading to a war against government forces; the de facto administrative center was subsequently moved to Mariupol and then Kramatorsk. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the oblast again became the site of heavy fighting, and Russia later declared the annexation of the entirety of the oblast as well as three other regions, though the annexation remains internationally unrecognized. About three-fifths of the oblast is under Russian military occupation.

==History==

Donetsk Oblast is located within the historic regions of Zaporizhzhia (western and central part), Sloboda Ukraine (northern part) and Pryazovia (southern part). In the mid-18th-century, the north-eastern outskirts formed part of Slavo-Serbia with its capital in Bakhmut.

Before the establishment of Donetsk Oblast, three districts (okruhas) existed on its territory from 1923 to 1930. The Donets Governorate was terminated in 1925. As part of Soviet Ukraine, Donetsk Oblast was established on 2 July 1932 out of the Kharkiv Oblast, the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, and a number of raions that were under the direct administration of Kharkiv (then-capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic). Artemivsk (today Bakhmut) served as the oblast&#x27;s administrative center for two weeks until 16 July 1932, when the city of Stalino (today Donetsk) took on the role. Until 1938, the Donetsian Oblast included the territories of the modern Donetsk Oblast and the Luhansk Oblast. In June 1938 it was split into the Stalino Oblast (modern Donetsk Oblast) and the Voroshylovhrad Oblast (modern Luhansk Oblast).

During the Nazi German occupation from fall 1941 to fall 1943, Donetsk Oblast was known as Yuzivka Oblast (after the original name of Donetsk). During World War II, it was the site of several war crimes, including the German-perpetrated Artemivsk massacre and Soviet-perpetrated Massacre of Grischino.

As part of de-Stalinization in the Soviet Union, in 1961 Stalino and Stalino Oblast were renamed Donetsk and Donetsk Oblast. 

During the dissolution of the Soviet Union, 83.9% of voters in Donetsk Oblast approved Ukraine&#x27;s declaration of independence in the 1991 referendum.

In the mid-1990s, the region became known for its heightened criminal activity, including the killings of high-profile business people such as Akhat Bragin and Yevhen Shcherban. Donetsk Oblast was also a base for Ukraine&#x27;s main pro-Russian political faction, Party of Regions, which became part of the Ukrainian government in 2002 and paved a way into Ukrainian politics for the powerful &quot;Donetsk Clan&quot;.

In late 2004, the Party of Regions was involved in the creation of a political project, the South-East Ukrainian Autonomous Republic, which was intended to include Donetsk Oblast. Having close ties with the Russian government, the Party of Regions, along with local communists and other pro-Russian activists, instigated the pro-Russian unrest which escalated into the war in Donbas. In May 2014, the Ukrainian government lost control over its border with Russia in Donetsk Oblast.

On 30 September 2022 Russia, amid its invasion of Ukraine, annexed Donetsk (Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic), Luhansk (Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic), Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson Oblasts. The United Nations General Assembly subsequently passed a resolution calling on countries not to recognise what it described as an &quot;attempted illegal annexation&quot;, demanded that Russia &quot;immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw&quot;, while most nations of the world have not recognized the annexations. As of April 2024, Russia controls about 60% of the oblast.

==Geography==
Donetsk Oblast is located in southeastern Ukraine. The area of the oblast (26,517 km2) comprises about 4.4% of the total area of the country. The oblast borders the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts to the southwest, the Kharkiv Oblast to the north, the Luhansk Oblast to the northeast, the Rostov Oblast in Russia to the east, and the Sea of Azov to the south.

Its extent from north to south is 270 km, from east to west – 190 km. The extreme points of the oblast&#x27;s borders are: Bilosarayska Kosa (spit) in the south, Shevchenko of Volnovakha Raion in the west, Verkhnii Kut of Horlivka Raion in the east, and Lozove of Kramatorsk Raion in the north.

The state historic-architectural site near the city of Sviatohirsk with the Sviatohirsk Lavra was nominated for the Seven Wonders of Ukraine.

==Administrative divisions==
Since 2020, Donetsk Oblast has been divided into eight raions (districts), each named after its administrative center:

Each raion is in turn divided up into hromadas.

==Demographics==

In 2013, the population of Donetsk Oblast was 4.43 million, which constituted 10% of the overall Ukrainian population, making it the most populous and most densely populated region of the country, except for the cities with special status (Kyiv and Sevastopol). Its large population is due to the presence of several big industrial cities and numerous villages agglomerated around them.

During the 2004 presidential election, political supporters of Viktor Yanukovych threatened to demand autonomy for Donetsk and neighboring oblasts if the election of their candidate was not recognised. However, no official moves were ever made.

At the 2001 Ukrainian National Census, the ethnic groups within Donetsk Oblast were: Ukrainians – 2,744,100 (56.9%), Russians – 1,844,400 (38.2%), Pontic Greeks – 77,500 (1.6%), Belarusians – 44,500 (0.9%), others (2.3%).

At the 2001 census, the languages spoken within the oblast were: Russian (spoken by 98.6% of Russians living there, 58.7% of Ukrainians, 58.7% of Greeks, and 85.5% of Belarusians) and Ukrainian (spoken by 41.2% of Ukrainians, 1.3% of Russians, 3.2% of Greeks, and 3.9% of Belarusians).

===Median age===
: &quot;total:&quot; 41.9 years 
: &quot;male:&quot; 38.0 years 
: &quot;female:&quot; 45.8 years (2013 official)

==Economy==
===Industry===
Donetsk Oblast accounts for more than one half of the coal, finished steel, coke, cast iron and steel production in Ukraine. Ferrous metallurgy, fuel industry and power industry are in demand in the structure of industry production. There are about 882 industry enterprises that are on independent balance, and 2,095 small industry enterprises in the oblast.
The oblast has a developed transport infrastructure which includes the Donetsk railway (covers 40% of national transportation), the Mariupol Port, the Donetsk International Airport, passenger airports in Mariupol and Kramatorsk, and dense road systems. In Donetsk Oblast two special economic zones have been created, &quot;Donetsk&quot; and &quot;Azov&quot;, which have a privileged tax regime.

===Agriculture===
In 1999, the gross grain yield in the oblast was about 999.1 thousand tons, sugar beets – 27.1 thousand tons, sunflower seeds – 309.4 thousand tons, and potatoes – 380.2 thousand tons. Also, 134.2 thousand tons of meat, 494.3 thousand tons of milk and 646.4 million eggs have been produced. At the beginning of 1999 there were 2108 farms within the oblast.

==Geology==

Donetsk Oblast&#x27;s climate is mostly continental, which is characterised by hot summers and relatively cold winters with changeable snow surfaces. East and southeast strong winds, high temperatures and heavy rain showers are typical in the summer. The average annual rainfall is 524 mm.

The basic minerals found here are: coal (reserves – 25 billion tons), rock salt, lime carbonate, potassium, mercury, asbestos, and graphite. The area is also rich in fertile black earth.

Important resources for recreation within the area are: the mild climate, the Sea of Azov coast, curative mud, sources of minerals, and radon and table water. Due to these numerous recreation resources, many resort hotels and camps are located here. There are about 26 health centres and pensions, 52 rest homes and boarding houses, and rest camps for children in the oblast.

The curative areas in the oblast include the Slovyansk salt lakes and mineral water sources. The oblast also contains many park zones, some of which are of great national value. They include the Khomutivsky steppe and the Azov sea coast. Overall, Donetsk Oblast contains about 70 protected park and nature attractions including branches of the Ukrainian steppe park, six state reserves, ten memorials of nature, landscapes, and six park tracts.

==Polls==
During the 1991 referendum, 83.90% of votes in Donetsk Oblast were in favour of the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine, fourth lowest in the country after Crimea, Sevastopol and Luhansk Oblast. A survey conducted in December 2014 by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found 18.5% of the oblast&#x27;s population supported their region joining Russia, 53.8% did not support the idea, 22.5% were undecided, and 5.2% did not respond; insurgent-controlled areas (which hold over 50% of the population) were not polled.

<doc id="494890" wikidata="Q75858" url="?curid=494890" title="Jörg Immendorff">
<text>Jörg Immendorff (14 June 1945 – 28 May 2007) was a German painter, sculptor, stage designer and art professor. He was a member of the art movement &quot;Neue Wilde&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Immendorff was born in Bleckede, Lower Saxony, near Lüneburg on the west bank of the Elbe. When he was 11 years old, his father left the family. This traumatic experience has been used to explain Immendorff&#x27;s later feelings of inadequacy and emotional remoteness. 
He attended the boarding School ←Ernst-Kalkuhl Gymnasium as a student. At the age of sixteen he had his first exhibition in a jazz cellar in Bonn.

Beginning in 1963, Immendorff studied at the Art Academy in Düsseldorf (&quot;Kunstakademie Düsseldorf&quot;). Initially he studied for three terms with the theater designer Teo Otto. After Otto threw him out of his class for refusing to let one of his paintings serve as stage-set decoration, Immendorff was accepted as a student by Joseph Beuys. The academy expelled him because of some of his (left-wing) political activities and neo-dadaist actions.

From 1969 to 1980, Immendorff worked as an art teacher at a public school, and then as a free artist, holding visiting professorships all over Europe. 
In 1989, he became professor at the Städelschule in Frankfurt am Main and in 1996 he became professor at the Art Academy in Düsseldorf—the same school that had dismissed him decades earlier as a student. His master students at the Düsseldorf Art Academy included Oda Jaune and Renata Jaworska.

==Work==

Jörg Immendorff often worked in &quot;grand cycles of paintings&quot; that often lasted years at a time and were political in nature. Notable cycles include &quot;LIDL, Maoist Paintings, Cafè Deutschland ,&quot; and &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress.&quot;

===LIDL===
The first body of work that Immendorff gave a name to were his LIDL paintings, sculptures, performances, and documents, that he executed during 1968–1970. The name, &quot;LIDL&quot; was inspired by the sound of a child&#x27;s rattle makes and much of his work from this period included the iconography of new beginnings and innocence. LIDL is comparable to Dadaist but unlike the Dadist movement it never became an established group but rather consisted of a variety of artists (including James Lee Byars, Marcel Broodthaers, Nam June Paik, and Joseph Beuys) participating in actions and activities. The art-historian Pamela Kort wrote this of Immendorf&#x27;s &quot;LIDL&quot; works:

&quot;&quot;LIDL&quot; ridiculed elitist art traditions, the cult of creative &#x27;genius&#x27;, and the precious aesthetic object. The artist countered these hierarchies by assembling a body of pretentious iconographic motifs drawn from the make-believe world of the child – turtles, dogs, goldfish, playhouses, and polar bears – which he transformed into the &#x27;working material&#x27; of what he hoped would be a new functional art form.&quot; 

In January 1968 he appeared in front of the West German Parliament in Bonn with a wood block labeled “Lidl” tethered to his ankle and painted in the colors of the German flag; he was subsequently arrested for defaming the flag.

===&quot;Café Deutschland&quot; series===
Best known is his &quot;Café Deutschland&quot; series of sixteen large paintings (1977–1984) that were inspired by Renato Guttuso’s &quot;Caffè Greco&quot;; in these crowded colorful pictures, Immendorff had disco-goers symbolize the conflict between East and West Germany. Since the 1970s, he worked closely with the painter A. R. Penck from Dresden (in East Germany). Immendorff was a member of the German art movement Neue Wilde.

===Other activities===
Immendorff created several stage designs, including two for the Salzburg Festival. He designed sets for the operas &quot;Elektra&quot; and &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;. The latter also inspired a series of paintings in which he cast himself as the rake.

In 1984, Immendorff opened the bar &quot;La Paloma&quot; near the Reeperbahn in Hamburg St. Pauli and created a large bronze sculpture of Hans Albers there. He also contributed to the design of André Heller&#x27;s avant-garde amusement park &quot;Luna, Luna&quot; in 1987. For three months, from 1987 until 1988, Immendorff was the foreign artist in residence at the Auckland Art Gallery in New Zealand, attracting a lot of attention in the local scene there.
Immendorff created various sculptures; one spectacular example is a 25 m tall iron sculpture in the form of an oak tree trunk, erected in Riesa in 1999.

In 2006, Immendorff selected 25 of his paintings for an illustrated Bible. In the foreword he described his belief in God.

==Exhibitions==
A major 2019 survey began at the Haus der Kunst in Munich and later traveled later to the Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid and the Fondazione Querini Stampalia in Venice, curated by Francesco Bonami.

==Personal life==
In 2000, Immendorff married his former student Oda Jaune. The two had a daughter, Ida, who was born on 13 August 2001.

In August 2003, Immendorff was caught in the luxury suite of the Steigenberger Parkhotel in Düsseldorf with seven prostitutes (and four more on their way) and some cocaine. More cocaine was found in his studio; all in all, the found substances contained 6.6 grams of pure cocaine, above the legal threshold for personal use. In interviews, Immendorff attempted to explain his actions with his terminal illness and as an expression of his &quot;orientalism&quot; that provided inspiration for his work. He also complained about prostitutes &quot;who don&#x27;t understand that a good whore does not divulge anything about her clients.&quot; He cooperated with the prosecution, admitted to having taken cocaine since the early 1990s and supplied the name of his dealer. At the trial in July 2004, he admitted to having organized 27 similar orgies between February 2001 and August 2003. He was sentenced to 11 months on probation and was fined €150,000. The mild sentence was justified with Immendorff&#x27;s illness and his extensive confession. He had been suspended from his position at the university but was reinstated after the verdict.

In March 2004, a woman attempted to blackmail Immendorff, threatening to divulge further details of the orgies. Immendorff notified the police and she was arrested. Her trial started in September 2004.

===Disease and death===
Immendorff was diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease) in 1998. When he could not paint with his left hand any more, he switched to the right. In 2004 he funded a stipend to research the disease.

In November 2005, he was treated by emergency physicians and was admitted to a hospital, where a tracheotomy had to be performed to help him breathe. As of 2006, he used a wheelchair full-time and did not paint anymore; instead he directed his assistants to paint following his instructions.

On 27 May 2007, at the age of 61, he succumbed to the disease. He died in Düsseldorf and his ashes were scattered in the Mediterranean Sea. In his will, he left his entire estate, estimated at €15–18 million, to his wife. A 12-year-old son from a former relationship who never knew his father went to court over the size of his legitime.

==Recognition==
In 1997, Immendorf won the world&#x27;s best endowed art prize at the time, the MARCO prize of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Monterrey, Mexico. In the following year he received the merit medal (&quot;Bundesverdienstkreuz&quot;) of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Immendorf was considered a friend and the favorite painter of former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who chose him to paint his official portrait for the Federal Chancellery. The portrait, which was completed by Immendorff&#x27;s assistants, was revealed to the public in January 2007; the massive work has ironic character, showing the former Chancellor in stern heroic pose, in the colors of the German flag, painted in the style of an icon, surrounded by little monkeys. These &quot;painter monkeys&quot; were a recurring theme in Immendorff&#x27;s work, serving as an ironic commentary on the artist&#x27;s business.

==Art market==
In 2008, the Estate of the Artist contested the authenticity of a work that was offered at an auction, and the work was withdrawn from the sale. The artist&#x27;s widow sought permission to have the work destroyed, which was granted in 2012 after the work was declared a fake. The original owner of the piece contested this ruling, and in 2014 the High Regional Court of Düsseldorf overruled the decision, claiming the authenticity of the work was “irrelevant.”

The most expensive painting by the artist in the art market was &quot;Ende gut, alles gut (All&#x27;s Well that Ends Well)&quot; (1983), who sold at Sotheby&#x27;s London, on 7 February 2007, by $567,272.

<text>The Welsh Highland Railway (WHR; ) is a restored narrow-gauge heritage railway in the Welsh county of Gwynedd. It runs from Caernarfon to Porthmadog, and passes through a number of popular tourist destinations including Beddgelert and the Aberglaslyn Pass. At Porthmadog it connects with the Ffestiniog Railway and to the Welsh Highland Heritage Railway. In Porthmadog it uses the United Kingdom&#x27;s only mixed gauge flat rail crossing.

The restoration, which had the civil engineering mainly built by contractors and the track mainly built by volunteers, received a number of awards. Originally running from , near Caernarfon, to , the current line includes an additional section from Dinas to Caernarfon. The original line also had a branch to and the slate quarries around Moel Tryfan, which has not been restored. (This branch forms a footpath &quot;rail trail&quot;, the lower section of which has been resurfaced and supplied with heritage notice-boards.)

There is also the long Welsh Highland Heritage Railway which runs from Porthmadog along the trackbed of the former Cambrian Railways exchange siding and connects to the WHR main line at Pen-y-Mount junction.

== History ==

The original Welsh Highland Railway was formed in 1922 from the merger of two companies – the North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways (NWNGR) and the Portmadoc, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway (PBSSR), successor to the Portmadoc, Croesor and Beddgelert Tram Railway. It was never a commercial success; the carriages of the 1890s were outdated and uncomfortable for so long a ride, the journey took too long and the service had a reputation for being unreliable.

=== Forerunners: 1863–1921 ===
The Croesor Tramway had run from Porthmadog since 1863 up into the Croesor Valley and the slate quarries in this area. This was a horse-worked line laid to a nominal gauge.

The NWNGR had originally built a narrow-gauge line from a junction with the London and North Western Railway line at Dinas to Bryngwyn with a branch from Tryfan Junction via Waunfawr to Llyn Cwellyn (Snowdon Ranger). The line was opened in 1877 and was extended to South Snowdon (Rhyd Ddu) in 1881, a total of . This closed to passengers in 1914 but goods traffic continued up to its absorption by the WHR in 1922.

In 1902, the newly formed PBSSR took over the failed Portmadoc, Croesor and Beddgelert Tram Railway with the aim of extending it to South Snowdon slate quarry in the Nant Gwynant Pass. Work was abandoned by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, although the tunnels through the Aberglaslyn Pass were mostly completed.

=== Formation and construction: 1921–1923 ===
The name Welsh Highland Railway first appeared in 1921 when a 1914 light railway order (LRO) was processed. It was originally drawn up by the local Caernarfonshire authorities and aimed to link the PGSSR and NWNGR but had been delayed by the First World War. It was revived by two local politicians and a Scottish distillery owner, Sir John Henderson Stewart. In July 1921, Stewart also obtained control of the Festiniog Railway, to obtain extra rolling stock for the WHR.
The LRO was passed in 1922, following a public inquiry. The budget was £75,000 and much of the funding was borrowed from the Ministry of Transport and local authorities. According to the historian Peter Johnson, this would become a burden as the railway needed to generate the unlikely sum of £3,750 profit each year to service the debt.

Two further LROs enabled improvements to the railway&#x27;s alignment at Beddgelert, a new station site in Porthmadog and a link to the Festiniog Railway. McAlpine &amp; Sons were contracted to refurbish the existing lines and complete the link between Rhyd Ddu and Croesor Junction, thus creating a railway that ran from Dinas to join the Festiniog Railway at Porthmadog. Like the modern day WHR, the railway was opened in stages. The former NWNGR section re-opened on 31 July 1922 and the remainder on 1 June 1923.

=== Fall into receivership: 1923–1933 ===
The WHR venture was not a success and was beset with problems from the start. Indeed, 1923 was its most successful year. Much hoped-for revenue from quarry traffic never materialised as the slate industry had fallen into decline. Its passenger services were also unsuccessful and could not compete with the local bus services, which often took half the time to complete the same journey. Its rolling stock was out of date, it lacked locomotives and carriages and its marketing was inadequate. In 1924, winter passenger services were discontinued due to poor traffic. A dispute with the Great Western Railway over the costs of the crossing over its line at Porthmadog also caused problems, despite the crossing having been used since 1867 without any charges or problems. The railway even had to resort to escorting passengers across the crossing on foot.

After 1923, it was unable to pay debenture interest and, in 1927, the county council sued and put the railway into receivership. Services continued and by 1933, it was run down and the local authorities decided to close it.

=== Control by the Festiniog Railway Company: 1934–1937 ===
In 1934, the company agreed to lease the line to the Festiniog Railway Company for 42 years. It was a disaster, with the FR forced to pay rent even if the WHR made a loss.

The FR Co. attempted to change the line&#x27;s fortunes by re-focussing on the tourist market. This included painting the carriages bright colours, including yellow and blue and promoting the Aberglaslyn Pass as a destination by renaming Nantmor station as Aberglaslyn. They also tried to promote round trip (return) journeys, with passengers taking the standard gauge line to Dinas, travelling on the WHR and the Festiniog Railway to Blaenau Ffestiniog and then changing again to take the standard gauge railway to their original starting point.

Despite these attempts, the FR Co. were unsuccessful, the last passenger train ran in 1936 and the last goods service in 1937. The early tourist industry did not provide sufficient visitors to make the railway pay, especially during the Depression. Competition from buses which ran a faster and more regular service from Caernarfon and Beddgelert also played a part. The last passenger train ran on 5 September 1936 and, in February 1937, the FR decided not to run the WHR again.

=== Fall into liquidation 1937–1941 ===
As there was no provision for the Ffestiniog Railway Company to hand back its lease and the WHR was bankrupt, the line became dormant. In 1941, the authorities decided to requisition the movable assets for use in the Second World War. Much of the rolling stock was sold off and most of the track was lifted. The Croesor Tramway section was left intact in case the slate quarries re-opened and remained until finally lifted in 1948–9.

In 1943, the Ffestiniog Railway surrendered its lease and, in exchange for £550 compensation, it was allowed to keep &#x27;Single Fairlie&#x27; &quot;Moel Tryfan&quot; (although it only paid £150).

Various legal manoeuvres followed this, including a serious application to turn the route into a long-distance footpath. Although these plans were ultimately unfruitful, the statutory powers ensured that the trackbed was kept mainly intact, rather than sold off bit by bit, which would have made restoration much more difficult and potentially expensive. However, some parts, such as the sites of and stations, were sold off.

=== Restoration ===
The Welsh Highland Railway&#x27;s restoration has a long, complicated and controversial history and includes several court cases and public inquiries.

The origins of the WHRL restoration efforts, tentatively began in 1961 when disagreements within the volunteers of the Festiniog Railway and a group of like-minded railway enthusiasts, joined to form &quot;The Welsh Highland Railway Society&quot;. This group is the precursor of what eventually became WHR Ltd., which owns and operates the Welsh Highland Heritage Railway (WHHR). Legal problems meant they were unable to take over the old company so, in the 1970s, the group purchased the former standard gauge exchange sidings (the &quot;Beddgelert Siding&quot;) near Tremadog Road, Porthmadog, from British Railways to use as a base. In 1980, they began running passenger services over the line that is now known as the Welsh Highland Heritage Railway. They also acquired an original WHR locomotive &quot;Russell&quot;, which began working passenger services in 1987.

In the mid-1980s, a number of FR Co. employees became concerned about impact of possible competition from a rebuilt WHR and passed this view on to the FR management. In 1987, this resulted in a confidential offer to buy the WHR track bed from the official receiver for £16,000 to prevent the WHR being developed. In 1989, the offer became public, causing a backlash against the FR Co.

In 1990, a change of directors resulted in the FR Co.&#x27;s decision to take over the restoration of the WHR. After a long legal battle between the two companies, the FR Co. won control of the WHR track bed and it re-opened the railway in stages, starting in 1997. The line was completed in 2011.

=== Extension ===
With Caernarfon Council having a longer-term plan to reinstate the town&#x27;s rail transport link to Bangor, speculation mounted that the FR/WHR would potentially later extend itself. However, the Ffestiniog Railway wrote to the council in January 2014 to confirm that they would not themselves be supportive of such a scheme in narrow gauge, but supported the reconnection of the town to the national rail network using standard gauge.

== The present day WHR ==
The modern Welsh Highland Railway is a tourist railway owned and operated by the Festiniog Railway Company. It is longer than the original line and starts from Caernarfon rather than Dinas. The extension was built on the trackbed of the former standard gauge railway. Dinas station is also built on the standard gauge railway site, rather than the original narrow-gauge site, with the line moving onto the original WHR alignment just south of the station.

It is marketed by the FR Co. as &quot;The Welsh Highland Railway&quot; and &quot;Rheilffordd Eryri&quot; (In the Welsh language, &quot;Eryri&quot; = &quot;Snowdonia&quot;). The WHR&#x27;s connection to the Ffestiniog Railway means that the FR Co. controls almost 40 miles of narrow-gauge railway and it promotes both lines jointly as the &quot;Ffestiniog and Welsh Highland Railways&quot; or &quot;Rheilffyrdd Ffestiniog ac Eryri&quot;.

== The Welsh Highland Heritage Railway ==
The Welsh Highland Heritage Railway (Welsh: &quot;Rheilffordd Ucheldir Cymru&quot;) is a long narrow-gauge heritage railway owned and operated by Welsh Highland Railway Ltd. (WHR Ltd.). It operates from its main station at Tremadog Road, Porthmadog to its terminus at Pen-y-Mount, where it connects to the Ffestiniog Railway Company owned Welsh Highland Railway.

WHR Ltd&#x27;s primary focus is on recreating the atmosphere of the original Welsh Highland Railway. This includes replicas of original buildings, using original and replica carriages and rolling stock and the staff wearing period costume. It also has a museum at its Gelert&#x27;s Farm Works and every train halts there on the return journey to allow passengers to visit it. There is also a miniature railway and a tea room at its main Porthmadog station.

=== Relationship with the Festiniog Railway Company ===

Although WHR Ltd lost the battle for control of the WHR to the Festiniog Railway Company, they have also been involved in its restoration.

On 12 January 1998, both companies signed an agreement, commonly known as the &quot;98 agreement&quot;. In return, for dropping its objections to the Festiniog Railway Company&#x27;s application to restore the railway; WHR Ltd would be allowed to construct the section of the railway from to Pont Croesor and then operate their own services over it until such time as the &quot;Head of Steel&quot; arrived at Pont Croesor from the north. The Pen y Mount to Pont Croesor section would then be handed over to the FR&#x27;s construction company for incorporation into the rest of the WHR. Finally, in between its principal services, the FR would then operate trains from the WHR Ltd&#x27;s Porthmadog (WHHR) railway station, to unspecified destinations on the WHR, using WHR Ltd locomotives, rolling stock and (where possible) WHR Ltd staff. Revenue from these trains would be retained by the FR, but they would, in turn, pay a hire fee for the use of the locomotive and rolling stock and a track access fee for the use of WHR Ltd&#x27;s line between Porthmadog (WHR) and Pen y Mount.

Another key part of the agreement defined the names of the two companies&#x27; operations during the period that the line was restored. The FR Co. promoted their section as &quot;The Welsh Highland Railway (Caernarfon) (WHR C)&quot; and WHR Ltd. changed its operational name from &quot;The Welsh Highland Railway&quot; to &quot;The Welsh Highland Railway (Porthmadog) (WHR P)&quot;. When the two sections were connected in 2008, WHR Ltd. changed its operational name to &quot;The Welsh Highland Heritage Railway&quot; and the FR Co. started to promote their operation as &quot;The Welsh Highland Railway&quot; or, in a largely Welsh-speaking area, &quot;Rheilffordd Eryri.

In the end, WHR Ltd was only able to build around a third of the way to Pont Croesor, with trains terminating at a location known as Traeth Mawr Loop (opened in 2007). The reasons behind this and the consequences, continue to be a subject of debate and led directly to a breakdown of relations between the two companies in 2008. Since then efforts have been made to improve relations and these are still ongoing.

== Welsh name ==
The original railway did not have an official Welsh translation of its name, despite the fact that North Wales has always been a heartland for the Welsh language. Local people tended to refer to it by informal names such as &quot;Y Lein Bach&quot; or &quot;Lein Bach Beddgelert&quot; (the little Beddgelert railway).

The restored railway is known as &quot;Rheilffordd Eryri&quot;.

=== Original locomotives ===
Two locomotives were inherited from the predecessor companies: &quot;Moel Tryfan&quot; and &quot;Russell&quot;. When these proved insufficient, Baldwin &quot;590&quot; was acquired by H.F. Stephens and several Festiniog Railway locomotives saw regular use on the Welsh Highland Railway throughout its entire pre-closure existence from 1923 to 1937. &quot;590&quot; was planned to be part of a larger fleet to replace &quot;Moel Tryfan&quot; and &quot;Russell&quot; but it gained so little popularity that Stephens never bought another. By 1936 &quot;Moel Tryfan&quot; was out of use at Boston Lodge. When &quot;Russell&quot; and &quot;590&quot; were withdrawn the following year, they were placed in Dinas shed, but when the Second World War broke out, the Ministry of War came to see about appropriating them for the war effort. After some examination of the engines and questioning of those who had worked them, &quot;Russell&quot; (regarded as a good engine) was removed for further use, and &quot;590&quot; (seen as an unreliable, rough rider with difficult controls and inadequate adhesion) was broken up at Dinas. Despite the unpopularity of &quot;590&quot;, the WHHR (Porthmadog) is currently refurbishing a similar Baldwin to act as a replica.

During the ownership of the WHR by the Festiniog Railway Company, &quot;Moel Tryfan&quot; and &quot;Russell&quot; were cut down to allow them to traverse the Festiniog Railway to Blaenau Ffestiniog. &quot;Moel Tryfan&quot; proved suitable, but &quot;Russell&quot;, even in cut down form, was not low or narrow enough to fit the FR&#x27;s highly restrictive loading gauge. &quot;Russell&quot; is now owned by WHR Ltd and has been restored to its original profile. &quot;590&quot; notably retained its original form until its demise.

== Operation ==
The railway is a single track line with passing loops at , , , and halt. There is also a loop at , which is normally locked out of use as a stabling point for engineering trains.

As with any single track railway, there are strict rules managing the movement of trains to prevent more than one entering a section. The line is managed from a single &quot;Control&quot; office at Boston Lodge Works, which also performs the same task for the Ffestiniog Railway. Control is responsible for the safe and efficient operation of trains, logs train movements on a train graph and acts as a single point of contact in emergencies. A system of tokens is used to control train access to single line sections.

Communication between train crew and Control always occurs using a landline at stations. There is no in-cab radio system and current regulations forbid use of such whilst in motion. As a backup system only, the guard carries a company mobile telephone for use in an emergency. This is not a primary system as cellular coverage is intermittent over the length of the line. His Majesty&#x27;s Railway Inspectorate, the organisation responsible for safety on British railways, insists on landlines as the main form of safety critical communication.

=== Signalling ===

The signalling on the WHR is much simpler than that used on the Ffestiniog Railway or the UK national rail network.

To enter any section of line, the train crew must obtain permission from Control and the relevant token. Each section of line is a token &quot;block section&quot;. The WHR uses the traditional Staff and Ticket system in which trains can either be issued with the section token staff or a numbered ticket. Tickets allow multiple trains to pass one-at-a-time through a section in one direction. The Controller advises the train crew which method they will be using. Tickets are kept in a locked box opened by a key on the token staff. This means the last train must use the token staff to pass through the section, so it can be used for trains to travel in the opposite direction. For additional protection, both the footplate crew and the guard must see the token or ticket before the train can depart.

At some stations an additional &quot;Shunt&quot; token is used to allow shunting to take place (such as a locomotive &quot;running round&quot; a train). They are provided at Dinas, Rhyd Ddu, Beddgelert and at Pont Croesor. The shunt token can only be withdrawn (used) with permission from Control and if there are no trains approaching the station in the adjacent single line sections. Withdrawing the token causes two yellow lights to go out on a red warning board on the line approaching the station, preventing other trains from entering the station.

The majority of the points at passing loops are operated automatically using the Automatic Train Operated Trailable (ATOTP) system, rather than a manually operated lever or point motor. There are also no signals to indicate that a train can enter a section. A &quot;Stop&quot; board at the end of the platform orders the train to stop until the train crew have obtained permission to proceed from control and a token. At the end of the section, the train can proceed into the platform provided the lights are lit on the home (shunt token warning) board, the point indicator is lit and the relevant platform is clear.

==== Future signalling – ETS ====
One of the disadvantages of the staff and ticket system is that it is very inflexible. If a locomotive fails in a station, for example, a token staff may be at the wrong end of a section and will have to be moved by road. This situation does not occur under the Electric Token System (ETS), a more advanced system in which tokens can be obtained at either end of a section from a token instrument.

ETS has been used on the Ffestiniog Railway for many years and the FR Co. were anxious to obtain enough ETS instruments to equip the WHR. After a long search, sufficient ETS equipment to operate the entire railway has been obtained from the Irish railway company Iarnród Éireann. The equipment became redundant after Iarnród Éireann modernised its signalling systems in the early 2000s.

As the WHR has no telephone cabling to connect the system, the FR Co. is developing a more modern alternative method of connecting the ETS machines. Until the system is finished, the WHR will continue using its current token systems.

==== Cae Pawb – The Cambrian crossing ====
Just outside Porthmadog, the railway crosses the Network Rail-owned Cambrian Coast line using a flat crossing. It existed on the old Welsh Highland Railway and was the source of much conflict between the old company and the Great Western Railway over the cost of WHR trains using the crossing. On the modern WHR, the crossing is called Cae Pawb. Cae Pawb means &quot;everybody&#x27;s field&quot; and is a reference to the nearby field of allotments.

Information, from the engineers involved, is that the Network Rail line crosses on solid steel billets to the same head, foot and height measurements as the adjacent standard gauge rail, but that the narrow gauge crosses on rail of a similar section which is joined on either side in succession to 80 lb/yd (36 kg/m)rail and then to the normal 60 lb/yd (30 kg/m) rail used for the narrow gauge.

Cae Pawb is at the north-western end of the Network Rail Harlech to Porthmadog signalling section, which is controlled from Machynlleth Control Centre. Standard gauge trains are protected by signals and wide-to-gauge trap points on the WHR line, which are interlocked with the standard gauge European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) signalling. The crossing is activated locally and ERTMS automatically gives permission for WHR trains to cross provided the standard gauge section is available. A crossing controller operates the crossing when passenger trains are running, with operation at other times being carried out by the train crew.

A set of replica white wooden crossing gates separate the narrow-gauge line from the standard gauge track and continue the Network Rail boundary fencing. They are left open when a crossing controller is present. The gates open inwards to prevent them blocking the standard gauge line. A replica signal box was constructed for this crossing but has now been installed at Pen y Mount to control the junction with the Welsh Highland Heritage Railway.

==== Porthmadog cross-town link ====

South of the Cambrian crossing, WHR cross town link trains move direct to Porthmadog Harbour, where passengers alight.

At Harbour Station there is a platform between the Welsh Highland and Ffestiniog lines so that passengers may transfer from one train to the other. There are also the usual facilities including a respectable eating house.

=== Timetable ===
Historically, the WHR was split into two operational sections:
* Dinas to Beddgelert and Beddgelert to Porthmadog (using present day form)

For the 2009 timetable operation, a &quot;two set&quot; operation was employed, with rolling stock being based at Dinas. During the year, operations were extended from Rhyd Ddu, first to Beddgelert on 7 April 2009, and then to Hafod y Llyn on 21 May 2009, site of a small halt on the original line. Although passengers could board and alight at Hafod-y-Llyn, its remote location meant that it could only be accessed by self-sufficient walkers and cyclists as there were no parking or other facilities at the halt and the platform was very short. It closed when was opened in 2010.

The Festiniog Railway Company had, at one point, planned to open the entire railway in 2007. Delays from government processes, a foot-and-mouth epidemic and funding restrictions meant that the opening was repeatedly delayed, with the full opening not happening until 2011. The line could not be opened to Beddgelert until the track left the national park at Pont Ynysferlas; this restriction was imposed by the Snowdonia National Park Authority to be sure that the railway really meant what it said, but this suspicious attitude lost the railway a year&#x27;s income from Beddgelert. From the end of May 2010, the line was extended a further to . Shortly thereafter the railway announced that as it had approval for service by the Safety Directorate of the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR), the remaining section would be completed before the end of September 2010. The cause of this sudden rush was the transition from legislation enshrined in the Railways and Other Transport Systems (Approval of Works, Plant and Equipment) Regulations 1994 (ROTS) to new legislation enshrined in the Railways and Other Guided Transport Systems (Safety) Regulations 2006 (ROGS). This should have happened in 2006, but heritage railways gained an extension of the transition period to 1 October 2010. It was foreseen that this change in regime would bring additional costs to the railway, so it was decided to complete the line before that date. A minor delay was incurred by the necessity to build a new culvert where the new Porthmadog A487 bypass road was being built.

Following the visit from the ORR on 15 October 2010, approval was given for passenger operation. On 30 October 2010 the first passenger trains, departing from Caernarfon to Porthmadog and return, were operated for the benefit of sponsors of the project. The commissioning of the ERTMS signalling on the Cambrian Line was completed during a possession from Harlech to Pwllheli between 24 and 27 October.

As a result of the A487 Porthmadog bypass works, the Ffestiniog Railway was severed just east of Minffordd station from 3 January to 16 February 2011 to build a new bridge. Therefore, the regular Winter FR trains were scheduled to operate from Porthmadog to . The first through services between Caernarfon and Porthmadog Harbour station began on 19 February 2011, with regular services recommencing from 27 March 2011.

=== Whole of line operations ===
Although, with completion of the main track laying it is now possible to run trains from through to , there are initially no plans to do so on a regular basis. The WHR is built to a slightly larger loading gauge than the Ffestiniog Railway and therefore through trains would, of necessity, be exclusively of FR stock.

=== Accidents and incidents ===
*On 4 March 1881, a passenger train was blown off the line near Snowdon Ranger Halt. The sole passenger on board was injured.
*On 10 June 2018, whilst hauling a passenger train, locomotive 143 was derailed near Clogwyn y Gwin South foot crossing due to the failure of part of the suspension of the front bogie. There were no injuries amongst the 74 passengers and seven staff on board.
*On 16 April 2019, the diesel locomotive &quot;Vale of Ffestiniog&quot; passed a signal at danger and entered a single line section without authority while travelling light engine from Dinas to Porthmadog. The locomotive did not have sufficient brake force to stop on the steep downhill gradient through Beddgelert, as a result of in-house modifications to the brake system and poor adhesion conditions. There were no injuries, and no damage was caused.
*On 19 December 2021 a derailment occurred on the bogie of the 4th passenger coach (no 125), just after crossing Brynyfelin River Bridge. The line was closed for 2 days to recover the train.

<text>Cherkasy Oblast (, ), also referred to as Cherkashchyna (, ) is an oblast (province) in central Ukraine located along the Dnieper River. The administrative center of the oblast is the city of Cherkasy. The current population of the oblast is 

==Geography==

Spanning , Cherkasy Oblast is the 18th largest oblast of Ukraine, comprising about 3.5% of the area of the country. The south flowing Dnieper River with the hilly western bank and the plain eastern bank divides the oblast into two unequal parts. The larger western part belongs to the Dnieper Upland. The low-lying eastern part of the oblast used to be subject to the frequent Dnieper flooding before the flow of the river became controlled by multiple dams of Hydroelectric Power Plants constructed along the river in the 20th century.
The oblast extends for 245 km from south-west to north-east, and for 150 km from north to south. The northernmost point of the oblast is located is near the village of Kononivka in Zolotonosha Raion (district), the southernmost point near the village of Kolodyste in Zvenyhorodka Raion, the westernmost point near the village of Korytnya in Uman Raion, and the easternmost point near the village of Stetsivka in Cherkasy Raion. The geometric centre of the oblast is located near the village Zhuravky of Horodyshche Raion. The oblast borders Kyiv Oblast to the north, Kirovohrad Oblast to the south, Poltava Oblast to the east, and Vinnytsia Oblast to the west.

==History==
Cherkasy Oblast was created as part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on 7 January 1954 by the ukase of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. On 26 April 1954 the ukase was approved by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. 

The oblast&#x27;s territory was the major cities of Cherkasy, Smila and Uman, their corresponding &quot;raions&quot; (districts), as well as 30 former &quot;raions&quot; of the Vinnytsia, Kyiv, Kirovohrad and Poltava Oblasts.

Archaeological discoveries have shown that people have inhabited the valley of the Dnieper River since time immemorial. The oldest objects excavated on the territory of the region date back to the Stone Age – the Palaeolithic period.

==Administrative divisions==
Since July 2020, Cherkasy Oblast is administratively subdivided into 4 &quot;raions&quot; (districts). These are further divided into 66 &quot;hromadas&quot; (communities).

The following data incorporates the number of each type of administrative divisions of Cherkasy Oblast:

* Administrative Center — 1 (Cherkasy)
* Raions — 4
* Hromadas — 66, including:
** Urban hromadas — 16
** Settlement hromadas — 10
** Rural hromadas — 40
***

The local administration of the oblast is controlled by the Cherkasy Oblast Rada. The governor of the oblast is the Cherkasy Oblast Rada speaker, appointed by the President of Ukraine.

Since July 2020, Cherkasy Oblast consists of four raions:

The region has 16 populated places designated as cities (towns). The only one with the population over 100 thousands is Cherkasy. Uman and Smila are in the range between 80 and 90 thousands, and all others are below 30 thousands.

==Demographics==

The current estimated population is 1,335,064 (as of 2006).

According to the 2001 Ukrainian census, the oblast&#x27;s population is almost equally divided between the urban and rural areas (53.7% and 46.3%, respectively). The demographic situation in this largely agricultural territory is somewhat complicated by population ageing.

By ethnic composition, Ukrainians represent the overwhelming majority of the oblast&#x27;s population (93.1%). Ethnic Russians are the second group of population (5.4%), and are concentrated mainly in the city of Cherkasy.

===Age structure===
: &quot;0-14 years:&quot; 13.4% (male 87,557/female 82,340)
: &quot;15-64 years:&quot; 69.1% (male 417,426/female 457,390)
: &quot;65 years and over:&quot; 17.5% (male 72,835/female 147,711) (2013 official)

===Median age===
: &quot;total:&quot; 41.7 years 
: &quot;male:&quot; 38.4 years 
: &quot;female:&quot; 45.0 years (2013 official)

==Economy==

The economy of the Cherkasy Oblast is largely dominated by agriculture. While the winter wheat and sugar beets are the main products grown in the oblast, barley, corn, tobacco and hemp are also grown. Cattle breeding is also important.

The industry is mainly concentrated in Cherkasy, the oblast&#x27;s capital and the largest city. A chemical industry was developed in the city in late 1960s in addition to machine building, furniture making and agricultural processing.

==Nomenclature==

Most of Ukraine&#x27;s oblasts are named after their capital cities, officially referred to as &quot;oblast centers&quot; (). The name of each oblast is a relative adjective, formed by adding a feminine suffix to the name of respective center city: &quot;Cherkasy&quot; is the center of the &quot;Cherkaska oblast&quot; (Cherkasy Oblast). Most oblasts are also sometimes referred to in a feminine noun form, following the convention of traditional regional place names, ending with the suffix &quot;-shchyna&quot;, as is the case with the Cherkasy Oblast, &quot;Cherkashchyna&quot;.

==Education==
There are 5 universities in the region:
* The Bohdan Khmelnytsky National University of Cherkasy
* Cherkasy State Technological University 
* Uman National University Of Horticulture
*  Pavlo Tychyna Uman State Pedagogical University
* East European University of Economics and Management (private)

<text>Kharkiv Oblast (, ), also referred to as Kharkivshchyna (), is an oblast (province) in eastern Ukraine.

Kharkiv borders Luhansk Oblast to the east, Donetsk Oblast to the southeast, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast to the southwest, Poltava Oblast to the west, Sumy Oblast to the northwest and Russia&#x27;s Belgorod Oblast to the north. Its area is , or 5.2% of the total territory of Ukraine.

The oblast is the third-most populous of Ukraine, with a population of 2,598,961 in 2021, more than half (1.42 million) of whom live in the city of Kharkiv, the oblast&#x27;s administrative center.

==Nomenclature==

Most of Ukraine&#x27;s oblasts are named after their capital cities, officially called &quot;oblast centers&quot; (, translit. &quot;oblasnyi tsentr&quot;). The name of each oblast is a relative adjective, formed by adding a feminine suffix to the name of respective center city: &quot;Kharkiv&quot; is the center of the &quot;Kharkivs’ka oblast’&quot; (Kharkiv Oblast). Most oblasts are also sometimes referred to in a feminine noun form, following the convention of traditional regional place names, ending with the suffix &quot;-shchyna&quot;, as is the case with the Kharkiv Oblast, &quot;Kharkivshchyna&quot;.

==Geography==
The oblast borders Russia (Belgorod Oblast) to the north, Luhansk Oblast to the east, Donetsk Oblast to the southeast, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast to the southwest, Poltava Oblast to the west and Sumy Oblast to the northwest.

The northern and central parts are part of historic Sloboda Ukraine, and the southern part is part of historic Zaporizhzhia.

==History==
During the Soviet administrative reform of 1923–1929, the Kharkov Governorate was abolished in 1925 leaving its five okruhas: Okhtyrka (originally Bohodukhiv), Izium, Kupiansk, Sumy, and Kharkiv. Introduced in the Soviet Union in 1923, a similar subdivisions existed in Ukraine back in 1918. In 1930 all okruhas were also abolished with raions becoming the first level of subdivision of Ukraine until 1932.

The modern Kharkiv Oblast was established on 27 February 1932. In the summer of 1932, some parts of the oblast were included in the newly created Donetsk Oblast originally centered in Artemivsk (later in Stalino). Then in the fall, some territories of the Kharkiv Oblast were used in the creation of Chernihiv Oblast. More territories became part of Poltava Oblast in fall of 1937 and Sumy Oblast in winter of 1939.

During the Holodomor the population of the Kharkiv Oblast together with Kyiv Oblast suffered the most. During World War II, it was the site or large Soviet massacres of Poles (Piatykhatky) and German massacres of Jews (Drobytsky Yar). The region saw major fighting during World War II in several Battles of Kharkov between 1941 and 1943.

During the 1991 referendum, 86.33% of votes in Kharkiv Oblast were in favor of the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine. A survey conducted in December 2014 by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found 4.2% of the oblast&#x27;s population supported their region joining Russia, 71.5% did not support the idea, and the rest were undecided or did not respond.

Following the Euromaidan, there was pro-Russian unrest in the region, and central government buildings were taken over by separatists in a failed attempt to create a separatist &#x27;Kharkov&#x27;s People&#x27;s Republic&#x27;. The region also became a very popular destination for refugees from the Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk Oblast regions.

=== Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
As part of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian military launched a major military offensive in the region, which resulted in the occupation of parts of the oblast. By late August, about one third of the territory of Kharkiv Oblast was occupied including Izium and Kupiansk. In July 2022, the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic signed a memorandum to &quot;liberate Kharkiv from Ukraine&quot;.

In early September 2022, the Ukrainian military commenced a counteroffensive in the region. Several settlements in the region were recaptured from Russian control. By 10 September 2022, Ukraine had recaptured Kupiansk and Izium. On 11 September, Russia had retreated from many of the settlements it previously occupied in the oblast and the Russian Ministry of Defense announced a formal withdrawal of Russian forces from most of Kharkiv Oblast stating that an &quot;operation to curtail and transfer troops&quot; was underway.&quot; By 12 September 2022, as the Russian front lines in Kharkiv Oblast continued to collapse, Ukrainian forces had managed to push back to the northeastern border with Russia in some areas of the region. By 3 October 2022, Russian forces had almost completely withdrawn from Kharkiv Oblast. As of 2023, fighting continues in the easternmost parts of the oblast in the Battle of the Svatove–Kreminna line. In May 2024, Russia launched a renewed offensive in Kharkiv Oblast.
