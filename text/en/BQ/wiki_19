<text>Calvin University, formerly Calvin College, is a private Christian university in Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States. Founded in 1876, Calvin University is an educational institution of the Christian Reformed Church and stands in the Reformed (Calvinist) tradition. Known as Calvin College for most of its history, the school is named after John Calvin, the 16th-century Protestant Reformer.
==History==
The Christian Reformed Church in North America founded the school on August 4, 1876, as part of Calvin College and Theological Seminary (with the seminary becoming Calvin Theological Seminary) to train church ministers. The college and seminary began with seven students, in a rented upper room on Spring Street, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, with Geert Boer as the docent. The initial six-year curriculum included four years of literary studies and two years of theology. In 1892, the campus moved to the intersection of Madison Avenue and Franklin Street (Fifth Avenue) in Grand Rapids. In September 1894, the school expanded the curriculum for those who were not pre-theological students, effectually making the institution a college preparatory school. In 1900, the curriculum further broadened, making it more attractive to students interested in teaching or preparing for professional courses at universities, and Albertus Rooks became the school&#x27;s principal. In 1901, Calvin admitted the first women to the school.

In 1906, the literary department of the college became known as &quot;John Calvin Junior College&quot; and the college held its first commencement. The student newspaper &quot;Chimes&quot; was first published in 1907. Around 1910, the west Michigan cities of Muskegon and Kalamazoo fought to have Calvin relocate to their respective cities. Muskegon offered US$10,000 (approximately $260,000 in 2015 dollars) and a tract of land to attract the college. The city of Grand Rapids countered with its own $10,000 offer and the junior college chose to stay in Grand Rapids. In time, the two-year college became a four-year college. In 1917, John Calvin Junior College moved to the Franklin Street Campus, which was the southeast edge of Grand Rapids at the time. Two years later the college appointed its first official president, the Rev. J.J. Hiemenga.

Then a year later, in 1920, the college officially transitioned into a four-year college following the liberal arts philosophy of the Free University in Amsterdam as laid out by Dutch theologian and statesman Abraham Kuyper. The next year the college awarded its first bachelor&#x27;s degree. In 1924, with the opening of Grand Rapids Christian High School, the college offered its last year of college preparatory education, turned its focus exclusively to higher education, and opened its first dormitory. In 1925, the college began a teacher training program and, in 1926, appointed its first female faculty member, Johanna Timmer, as Dean of Women. The college dedicated its library, the Hekman Library on March 8, 1928. The college later dedicated its seminary building at the Franklin Street Campus on October 29, 1930. Still under the leadership of Rev. Hiemenga the college faced significant trouble during the Great Depression as financial hardship beset the college.

Although the school grew slowly in those early years, by 1930 it had reached its pre-World War I size of 350–450 students. Like many colleges in the United States, the end of the war led to the fastest enrollment increase in Calvin&#x27;s history. By 1950 the enrollment had climbed to 1,270 and Calvin joined the M.I.A.A. The enrollment increase led to space limitations at the Franklin Campus. William Spoelhoef became president of Calvin in 1951.

In 1956, the Synod of the Christian Reformed Church authorized the college to purchase the Knollcrest Farm from J.C. Miller for $400,000 (approximately $3.6 million in 2018). Located beyond the Grand Rapids city limits at the time, the Knollcrest farm increased Calvin&#x27;s campus from approximately one large city block to with a nature preserve. Many were reticent about the project and the college&#x27;s ability to finance it, but Spoelhof pursued the initiative. The Theological Seminary was first to move to the new campus since it did not need to be close to the rest of the college, building a new academic building and holding classes there starting in 1960. As space constraints became more noticeable on the Franklin campus, the college built its first academic building on the Knollcrest Campus and first held classes there in 1962. For the next 10 years, the college continued to operate at both the Knollcrest and Franklin campuses, until fully transitioning to the Knollcrest Campus in 1973. During the latter decades of the 20th century, Calvin grew to around 4,200 students. In 1991, the seminary and the college established separate boards of trustees.

At the turn of the millennium, Calvin began several new construction projects. Among these were a new communications and political science building, a conference center and hotel. In 2006, Calvin announced an expansion of the Fieldhouse which was completed in the spring of 2009. Shortly after, in 2010, Calvin completed an extensive renovation and expansion of the Fine Arts Center, thereafter rededicated as the Covenant Fine Arts Center.

The school made national headlines in 2005 when US President George W. Bush served as commencement speaker. Reactions among students and faculty were mixed. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, more than 800 faculty members, alumni, students and friends of the school signed a full-page ad in the &quot;Grand Rapids Press&quot;, saying that Bush&#x27;s policies &quot;...violate many deeply held principles of Calvin College.&quot;

In the summer of 2008, &quot;The Capella of Calvin College&quot;, the concert choir of Calvin under the direction of professor Joel Navarro, earned two third prizes in the Mixed and Free Category at the 37th Florilege Vocal de Tours Competition in Tours, France.

In August 2009, the college&#x27;s board of trustees issued a controversial memo to all employees that said that faculty were prohibited from teaching, writing about, or advocating on behalf of homosexuality or homosexual issues such as same-sex marriage. Many faculty members were critical of the policy and of the way it was adopted without consultation by the board. The Faculty Senate, by a vote of 36–4, asked the Board to withdraw the memo. The official policy of the college continues to be that the &quot;proper place&quot; for sexual relations is a &quot;marriage relationship between a man and a woman&quot;.

In June 2012, the Synod of the Christian Reformed Church of North America voted to appoint Michael K. Le Roy as the president of Calvin College, succeeding President Gaylen J. Byker. Within months of assuming office, President Le Roy disclosed that Calvin faced a financial crisis, with $117 million in debt at the time. As part of the debt reduction plan, Calvin successfully raised $25 million in eight months to reduce its long-term debt to $90 million and continues to implement cost-cutting measures. In September 2015, four lightly enrolled majors were reduced to minors and one minor eliminated, marking the final step in academic division prioritization.

Calvin College renamed itself Calvin University on July 10, 2019, a date that matches the 510th birthday of John Calvin, the college&#x27;s namesake. As an institution that already had numerous departments and centers, it was hoped that a name change to Calvin University would make the college more attractive to potential students as, internationally, colleges are considered a lower academic category than a university.

In 2021, the university ended several &quot;underperforming&quot; majors and minors, citing financial strain. The programs cut included the astronomy minor, Chinese major and minor, classical studies major and minor, Greek minor, Latin minor, Dutch major and minor, German major, and global development studies major and minor. This included dismissing tenured faculty members.

President Le Roy announced he would step down on June 10, 2021. On March 8, 2022, the Calvin University Board of Trustees announced the appointment of Wiebe Boer as the 12th president of Calvin College, succeeding Michael Le Roy.

In July 2023, the university announced that it was acquiring the Compass College of Film and Media in the fall of 2023. It will become part of the university&#x27;s communication school.

In February 2024, Wiebe Boer resigned from the position of president facing allegations of &quot;concerning and inappropriate conduct&quot;. Vice President of Advancement Gregory Elzinga was appointed interim president. Boer and his wife Joanna retaliated in April with a federal lawsuit against Calvin University, alleging defamation and breach of contract, including a list of complaints against Calvin in its handling of his resignation and its actions prior. In June, the Boers dropped their suit against Calvin. The Calvin Board of Trustees and the Boers issued a joint statement, saying that &quot;the Board and the Boers had resolved the matter, and the Boers have dropped their legal actions.&quot;

In October 2024, the Calvin board of trustees announced that Gregory Elzinga would serve as Calvin&#x27;s 13th president after serving as the university&#x27;s interim president since February 2024.

==Academics==
Calvin University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Calvin offers majors or minors in over 100 academic or pre-professional fields and ten graduate programs. Its most popular undergraduate majors, in terms of 2023 graduates, were:
::Engineering (79)
::Registered Nurse/Registered Nursing (66)
::Elementary Education &amp; Teaching (40)
::Accounting (31)
::Computer Science (30)
::Lay Ministry (30)

Calvin is a member of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities and as an institution in the Calvinist tradition, subscribes to a robust theology that produces a high regard for participating in and forming culture.

===Admissions===

For the Class of 2025 (enrolled fall 2021), Calvin University received 3,267 applications and accepted 2,992 (91.6%). Of those accepted, 736 enrolled, a yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend the university) of 24.6%. Calvin University&#x27;s freshman retention rate is 86%, with 77.1% going on to graduate within six years.

Of the 61% of the incoming freshman class who submitted SAT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite scores were 1130–1330. Of the 24% of enrolled freshmen in 2021 who submitted ACT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite score was between 24 and 30.

Together with Michigan State University, Michigan Technological University, Wayne State University, Hillsdale College, Kalamazoo College, and Hope College, Calvin University is one of the seven college-sponsors of the National Merit Scholarship Program in the state. The university sponsored 5 Merit Scholarship awards in 2020. In the 2020–2021 academic year, 7 freshman students were National Merit Scholars.

===Core curriculum===

Calvin university has a core curriculum with four parts: Foundations, Competencies &amp; Skills, Knowledge &amp; Understanding, and Cross-Disciplinary Integrations. The average student takes 45 hours of core courses in the course of a four-year degree at Calvin, though engineering majors and students in other professional programs have flexible ways to meet core requirements because some majors now require a higher number of credits to confer a degree.

The &quot;Capstone&quot; course, generally taken during the senior year, draws together themes and concepts from the core curriculum. Some Capstone courses are intended for students of specific majors, while others may be unrelated to a student&#x27;s chosen major(s) and minor(s), such as PHIL 205: Ethics, which can qualify as the capstone course for students of any major, including non-philosophy majors.

===Off-campus programs===
Calvin offers a large number of off-campus programs and ranks 2nd among baccalaureate institutions for the number of students who study abroad each year.

====Semester programs====
Calvin runs 11 of its own off-campus semester programs. These programs are led by Calvin faculty to ensure that students receive the same caliber of education that they would receive on campus. These programs are offered in the United Kingdom, China, France, Germany, Ghana, Honduras, Hungary, Peru, Spain, and Washington, D.C.

Additionally, Calvin works with numerous other colleges to offer dozens of other off-campus programs around the world.

====Off-campus interim====
Calvin also offers a variety of off-campus programs during the one-month interim term that takes place each May. In 2017, Calvin offered 33 different off-campus programs around the world (this number fluctuates slightly each year).

==Campus==

Calvin acquired the property in the mid-1950s and began a process of turning a biologically diverse farm into a center for Christian higher education. The master plan for the site was developed in 1957 by William Beye Fyfe, an adherent of the Prairie School of architecture. Working with President Spoelhof, Fyfe came up with a set of design principles for the campus aimed to symbolically represent and physically promote such ideals as the integration of faith and learning; integration of administration, faculty, and students; and the inter-relatedness of all the disciplines.

===Academic buildings===
Calvin has nine academic buildings on campus.

The first to be constructed was Hiemenga Hall, named after John Hiemenga and built in 1961. Hiemenga Hall houses academic departments including modern languages, history, philosophy, classical languages, gender studies, and religion. The building also houses some programs and offices. It is connected to the campus chapel and the Spoelhof Center via tunnels.

The Spoelhof Center, named after president emeritus William Spoelhof, houses the art, education, social work and sociology departments, the Office of the President, and several other administrative departments. The Gezon Auditorium is also housed in the Spoelhof Center. Dedicated in 1974, the Gezon Auditorium primarily serves as the main stage for the Calvin Theatre Company. Like the CFAC, it has flexible lighting and sound systems and serves as a venue for concerts, lectures and other events. The Spoelhof Center connects to the Science Building and Hiemenga Hall via tunnels.

The Science Building houses many of the science departments at Calvin, including engineering, physics, astronomy, psychology and nursing. The building also includes half of the Calvin-Rehoboth Robotic Observatory. When there are favorable skies, the observatory is open to the public on most weeknights. The Science Building is also distinctive for having been designed in the shape of a hexagon, emulating the benzene ring. In 2009, it was the backdrop for scenes of the film &quot;The Genesis Code&quot;.

Constructed in 1998, DeVries Hall houses classrooms, faculty offices, research labs and a greenhouse. In addition to the biology and chemistry departments, the building houses the West Michigan Regional Lab, a consortium between the college and local hospital, Spectrum Health.

Attached to DeVries Hall and the Science Building is North Hall, which houses several departments including economics, business, geology, geography, environmental studies, computer science, and mathematics.

To the west of North Hall is the Engineering Building which consists of the Prince Engineering Design Center and the Vermeer Engineering Projects Center. The Engineering Building was constructed in 1999 and houses faculty and student research facilities, metal and wood shops, a wind tunnel, a three-dimensional printer, and an anechoic chamber.

The Spoelhof Fieldhouse Complex, located on the north end of campus, houses a number of classrooms and the Kinesiology department. The fieldhouse underwent a major renovation and expansion in 2009.

The Covenant Fine Arts Center is one of the most recognizable buildings on campus, given its giant heptagon shape. Designed around the central auditorium, which seats 1,011, the CFAC houses the music and English departments. The CFAC auditorium is the preeminent musical performance space on campus featuring exceptional acoustics. At the back of the stage is the 39 rank, 32 stop mechanical action organ built by Schlicker Organ Company in 1966. Since its opening, the CFAC has hosted over 18,000 events. The auditorium is designed for versatility and is equipped with acoustical curtains, shifting acoustic deflection panels, a stage lift, and three catwalks. The building was closed for 2009–2010 for extensive remodeling.

In 2002, the DeVos Communication Center was constructed across the East Beltline Road. It is connected to west campus by the Calvin Crossing bridge. The building&#x27;s upper-level houses department and faculty offices for both the political science and communications arts and sciences departments. Additionally, there is a suite of audiology and speech pathology classrooms and facilities including a working clinic. The lower level of the building features media production and consumption facilities such as the Bytwerk Video Theatre, an audio studio, sound stage, control room, and editing suites for audio and video production. The ground floor features classrooms, a public atrium, and a snack shop.

In March 2021, the university began construction on a new building to house the Calvin University School of Business. The building resides on the east side of the campus, next to the DeVos Communication Center. The Business Department Chair envisions classrooms designed specifically for case studies, a new computer lab, breakout rooms, a hospitality area, seminars with local businesspeople, and study spaces.

===Hekman Library===
Beginning in 1917 with 3,500 volumes, Calvin&#x27;s &quot;library room&quot; eventually became the modern Hekman Library now holding over one million volumes. The collection&#x27;s emphasis is on works in the traditional liberal arts disciplines. The library&#x27;s strongest collections are in Theology, Religion, American literature, British literature, and Philosophy.

In terms of books, serial backfiles, and other paper materials held, Hekman Library, as of 2013, is the largest private academic library in the state.

The H. Henry Meeter Center for Calvin Studies is located in the Hekman Library. The center specializes in John Calvin and Calvinism. With many rare items, books, manuscripts, articles and literature, the Meeter Center is the largest collection of Calvin materials in North America.

===Athletic facilities===
The Spoelhof Fieldhouse Complex is home to the combined health, physical education, recreation, dance and sport department. In Spring 2007, the college began a $50 million construction project to renovate and expand the Calvin Fieldhouse. The fieldhouse reopened in Spring 2009 as the Spoelhof Fieldhouse Complex. The facility includes a new 5,000-seat arena (Van Noord Arena) which is currently the largest arena in a Division III school, an Olympic-regulation swimming pool (Venema Aquatic Center) which seats about 550, a tennis and track center (Huizenga Tennis and Track Center) containing 4 tennis courts and a 200-meter track, of weight training rooms and a custom made rock climbing wall. The Hoogenboom Health and Recreation Center contains the original renovated gym that is now used for basketball, volleyball, PE classes, intramurals, and concerts. The Hoogenboom Center has two dance studios as well as racquetball courts and exercise science laboratories.

===Chapel===

Though always part of the master plan, the chapel was not built until the late 1980s. It holds daily services in a protected time slot to ensure that all students and faculty members are able to attend the 20 minute worship services if they so choose. Chapel services follow a weekly rhythm and each day of the week has a different theme (Believe, Behold, Belong, Be Still, and Be Loud).

Designed by GMB Architects, the chapel sits at the highest point of the academic circle and its spire rises above all of the academic buildings. Shaped as an octagon, with seating in the round, the chapel offers exceptional acoustics for both instrumental and vocal music, in addition to the spoken word. The chapel also features a large organ built by Dobson Pipe Organ Builders. The three manual instrument uses mechanical key action with a detached console. The facade pipes, made of 75% burnished tin, conceal some 2,500 pipes. In addition to the sanctuary, the chapel has small prayer rooms, meeting spaces, a kitchen, theatre storage and rehearsal spaces.

A tunnel system connecting to the Spoelhof Center creates an outdoor plaza at ground level and the multi-use Lab Theatre below. The Lab Theatre is a blackbox theatre built in 1988 as a part of the chapel building project.

===Bunker Interpretive Center===
The Bunker Interpretive Center is located in Calvin&#x27;s nature preserve and serves as the home base for formal programs and an educational resource for the approximately 5,000 casual visitors that the Calvin University Ecosystem Preserve &amp; Native Gardens receives annually. The Bunker Interpretive Center is Gold LEED certified.

=== Bruce Dice Mineralogical Museum ===
The Bruce Dice Mineralogical Museum is located on the first floor of North Hall. It opened in 2012 after a collection of over 300 minerals and fossils was donated by 1948 alumnus Bruce B. Dice. The Museum serves as a home for the collection and an outreach resource for local school and hobby groups, as well as hosting casual visitors during open hours. The Museum is known for its collection of Cretaceous fossils from Lebanon.

== Centers and institutes ==
Centers include the Calvin Center for Christian Scholarship (CCCS), the Calvin Center for Faith and Writing (CCFW), the Calvin Center for Innovation in Business (CCIB), the Center for Social Research (CSR), the H. Henry Meeter Center for Calvin Studies, and the Van Lunen Center: Executive Management in Christian Schools. Institutes include the Calvin Institute of Christian Worship (CICW), The Clean Water Institute (CWI), the Kuyers Institute for Christian Teaching and Learning, the Nagel Institute for the Study of World Christianity, and the Paul B. Henry Institute for the Study of Christianity and Politics.

==Student life==

===Student body===

In 2021, Calvin University had approximately 3,307 students, 54% female and 46% male. The average class size was 23 and there was a 13:1 student/faculty ratio. Michigan residents comprised 55% of the student body and 12% of the students were from other countries. 224 full-time faculty taught at the college and 90.6% had obtained the terminal degree in their field.

===Residence life===
Calvin has six residence halls on campus which house the majority of the freshman and sophomore classes, as the college has a policy that requires most first and second year students to live on campus. First and second year students may live off-campus if they lodge with their parents, it has been more than two years since their high school graduation date, or if they qualify for a rare exception. The university also has two residence halls dedicated to upper-class housing, as well as eight upper-class apartment complexes on the east side of campus.

Kalsbeek-Huizenga-van Reken Hall houses three Living-Learning communities, each aligned with one of Calvin&#x27;s signature Cohorts. Each Living-Learning floor has a specific theme and a co-ed residence structure, along with theme-specific programming and events. Students who wish to live on one of the three floors must usually submit a separate application the spring semester before moving onto the floor.

One of the most notable events put on by residence life is &quot;Chaos Day&quot;, during which the residents of each of the halls have their own theme, decorate their dorm, and dress in costumes to compete in a number of relay races and similar games. The dorm building Schultze-Eldersveld has traditionally dominated the Chaos Day competition and has the most victories of any hall.

===Student Activities Office and The Calvin Concert Series===
The Student Activities Office at Calvin plans and hosts many films, concerts, and lectures to foster cultural engagement and discernment in a Christian context. The Student Activities Office shows a wide variety of popular and lesser-known films throughout the year. Admission to these films, hosted in the Covenant Fine Arts Center, is $1.

Calvin is also notable for its extensive concert series. Before each concert, Calvin hosts a question and answer session with students and the artist. These sessions are meant to give artists a way to converse with students about their music and art. Calvin has hosted a variety of acts including: Fun., Switchfoot, Death Cab for Cutie, Sufjan Stevens, MuteMath, Gungor, MGMT, the Soil &amp; the Sun, Twin Forks, Ingrid Michaelson, Home Free, Regina Spektor, Over the Rhine, Anberlin, Jon Foreman, Peter Rollins and David Bazan, Kishi Bashi, All Sons &amp; Daughters, NEEDTOBREATHE, Shad, Miracles of Modern Science, Diego Garcia, San Fermin, The Brilliance, Delorean, Pop Scholars, Okkervil River, The Head and The Heart, The National, Julianna Barwick, Lone Bellow, The Milk Carton Kids, Lily &amp; Madeleine, and Lecrae. The January Series also offers a wide selection of authors, singers, and musicians.

Because of its extensive and varied concert series, the Student Activities Office has faced controversy over the years. In September 2010, the college canceled a concert by Canadian indie rock band, The New Pornographers. According to an official statement released by Calvin, the concert was cancelled after several complaints were made due to the band&#x27;s name referring to pornography. Fun.&#x27;s advocacy of gay marriage was also met with significant controversy when Calvin hosted them in 2012.

===Safety===
Campus security and parking policy enforcement services are provided by Calvin University&#x27;s Campus Safety Department. Some Calvin University campus safety officers have been armed with firearms since 2008, a decision that the Campus Safety Department director William Corner describes as a response to concerns that the college was not adequately prepared to respond to a similar event following the 2007 Virginia Tech campus shooting. Initially, only Campus Safety supervisors who were former law enforcement and fully licensed to carry firearms on a school campus were permitted to carry firearms on Calvin&#x27;s campus. At that time, all campus safety supervisors were issued collapsible batons, chemical spray, and handcuffs as standard policy, even if they were not armed with a firearm.

At the time and until 2017, non-supervisory Campus Safety officers were student employees who performed their duties unarmed. In 2017, the Campus Safety Department discontinued hiring students for non-supervisory campus safety officer roles, electing instead to hire former law enforcement officers who were licensed to carry firearms on campus. The department continued to employ students as dispatchers, building security officers, and customer service staff. The Campus Safety Department director, William Corner, stated that student officers were not fully qualified for the risk level of some of the incidents they were responding too. “We were putting the students in positions that, honestly, I was not comfortable with for their safety and their level of experience.”

In September 2014, full-time, non-student Calvin College campus safety personnel began wearing body cameras while on duty. Officers are required to turn on the cameras in specific circumstances.

In 2016, Calvin College was described as being a model for the arming of campus security staff at other smaller college institutions in the United States.

A Calvin College campus safety supervisor was criminally charged with &quot;reckless use of a firearm&quot; after a November 2016 on-duty incident. The armed supervisor, Lee Swafford, allegedly did not fire his duty firearm in the incident that resulted in his arrest, but after a routine review of body camera footage by the Campus Safety Department director, William Corner, the college placed Swafford on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation. After the investigation, Calvin College dismissed Swafford on December 6, 2016. The college forwarded its evidence to the Grand Rapids Police Department and Kent County prosecutors then laid charges in February 2017. After the police issued a warrant for his arrest, Swafford turned himself in and was released on bail. In an open letter to college students, faculty, staff and visitors, college president Michael Le Roy described the officer&#x27;s actions as &quot;deeply disappointing to me.&quot; He also stated that the incident had involved a campus visitor, not a student or staff member. Swafford pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of reckless use of firearms on June 5, 2017 and was sentenced to a $300 fine.

Calvin University implemented a &quot;one button&quot; campus lockdown system in 2017. The new Lenel system can lock down every exterior door on the college campus with the push of a single button. The college has also offered active shooter response training to some staff and students.

==Athletics==

Calvin University fields 10 men&#x27;s and 11 women&#x27;s intercollegiate teams and several club sports, known as the Calvin Knights. Men&#x27;s volleyball became the 22nd varsity sport in the 2023–2024 school year.

==Publications==
Students at Calvin publish a weekly student newspaper, &quot;Chimes&quot;, and a biannual journal of arts and letters commentary, &quot;Dialogue&quot;. A yearbook, &quot;Prism&quot;, is also published for each school year. Student filmmakers have also made many short films and videos, like the popular Lipdub at Calvin College and the super-low-budget adaptation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, &quot;Meynin&quot;, both in 2010.

The school distributes &quot;Knightfile&quot;, a seasonal magazine on sports at the college, &quot;Uncompressed&quot;, a cultural discussion publication, and &quot;Spark&quot;, a magazine for alumni and friends.

<doc id="490399" wikidata="Q2925167" url="?curid=490399" title="Bridgeport, Chicago">
<text>Bridgeport is one of the 77 community areas in Chicago, on the city&#x27;s South Side, bounded on the north by the South Branch of the Chicago River, on the west by Bubbly Creek, on the south by Pershing Road, on the east by the Union Pacific railroad tracks, and on the northeast by the Dan Ryan Expressway. Neighboring communities are Pilsen across the river to the north, McKinley Park to the west, Canaryville to the south, and Armour Square to the east. Bridgeport has been the home of five Chicago mayors. Once known for its racial intolerance, Bridgeport today ranks as one of the city&#x27;s most diverse neighborhoods.

==History==

Bridgeport was initially called the &quot;Portage de Checagou&quot; (or Portage des Chenes), and Fr. Jacques Marquette and trader Louis Joliet traveled through in 1673. It technically remained under French control until 1763, then British control until 1783 or 1795 (since British traders based out of Detroit or Canada used it).

A settler named Charles Lee or Leigh came from Virginia and settled along the south fork of the Chicago River by 1804, but soon moved nearer to Lake Michigan after Fort Dearborn was completed. In April 1812, two of his tenants escaped to Fort Dearborn when visiting Winnebago proved unfriendly and massacred others at the trading post. The Leigh farm remained uninhabited as hostilities escalated into the Fort Dearborn massacre by summer&#x27;s end and remained so until the U.S. Army rebuilt Fort Dearborn in 1816. Then a Detroit firm sponsored a trader, John Crafts, who rebuilt the trading post and named it &quot;Hardscrabble&quot;. It grew to several cabins and a dormitory beside the trading post by the time of the Blackhawk War. Other residents who later became prominent included metis trader Alexander Robinson, schoolteacher Russell E. Heacock (who became the only dissenter to the plan to incorporate the Town of Chicago which was incorporated on August 12, 1833), and Jean Baptiste Beaubien (the second non-indigenous Chicago resident, an incorporation proponent and the town&#x27;s first militia leader lived here 1840-1858).

Heacock became a vocal proponent of the proposed Illinois and Michigan Canal, which led to the area&#x27;s development in the 1830s, although others since the voyageur era had previously seen the potential replacing the portage with a canal. A limestone quarry was established in 1832 or 1833, which provided stone to improve the Chicago harbor. In 1836 the area was renamed Bridgeport, the first Chicago neighborhood.
In the 1830s, large numbers of immigrants from Ireland started settling in this working-class neighborhood, which became an Irish-American enclave. Many of them had earlier helped build the Erie Canal, then arrived to work on the Illinois and Michigan Canal. Funding remained a problem, and the State of Illinois began issuing &quot;Land Scrip&quot; to the workers rather than paying them with money. A large number of those Irish-Americans who received the scrip used it to purchase canal-owned land at the northern end of the canal where it meets the south branch of the Chicago River. The original Bridgeport village, named &quot;Hardscrabble&quot;, was centered around what is now the section of Throop Street north of 31st Street.

Bridgeport also reflects its proximity to a bridge on the Chicago River, which was too low to allow safe passage for boats, forcing cargo to be unloaded there. Finley Peter Dunne later wrote about this area in popular sketches around the turn of the 20th century. Dunne&#x27;s protagonist, Mr. Dooley, lived on &quot;Archey Road&quot; (present day Archer Avenue).
Although the Irish are Bridgeport&#x27;s oldest and arguably most famous ethnic group, Bridgeport has also been home to many other groups. Bridgeport has also been home to many Italian-Americans, as has its smaller neighbor to the east, Armour Square. Many Lithuanian-Americans settled along Lituanica Avenue, which runs between 31st Street and 38th Place one block west of Halsted Street in what was once called &quot;Lithuanian Downtown&quot; and the center of Lithuanian settlement in Chicago. More recently, large numbers of first and second generation Mexican-Americans and Chinese-Americans arrived. Like the 19th century Irish immigrants, they found affordable housing in Bridgeport and appreciated its proximity to their work.

Bridgeport&#x27;s Polish history is most visibly represented in its two churches in the Polish Cathedral style: St. Mary of Perpetual Help, and St. Barbara. The Art Institute of Chicago performed restoration work on the paintings in the Shrine Altars at St. Mary of Perpetual Help which date back to 1890, with further plans calling for restoration of the stained glass windows and to complete the painting of the interior ceilings and rotunda.

The Chinese influence in Bridgeport has also followed in other ethnic groups in establishing neighborhood places of worship; the Ling Shen Ching Tze (真佛宗美) Buddhist Temple on West 31st Street was established in 1992.

==Politics==
Bridgeport has been the home or birthplace of five mayors of Chicago, representing all but 10 years between 1933 and 2011, illustrating the neighborhood&#x27;s influence on Chicago politics for most of the 20th century. These five men were Edward Joseph Kelly, mayor of Chicago from 1933 to 1947; Martin H. Kennelly, mayor of Chicago from 1947 to 1955; Richard J. Daley, mayor of Chicago from 1955 until his death in 1976; Michael A. Bilandic, initially appointed by City Council to finish Richard J. Daley&#x27;s term as mayor, the former Bridgeport alderman won the special election in 1977 and served until 1979; and Richard M. Daley, mayor of Chicago from 1989 until 2011.

Kelly, Kennelly, the elder Daley, and Bilandic comprised an unbroken, 46-year period (1933–1979) in which Bridgeport was home to the city&#x27;s mayor. Richard J. Daley is widely acknowledged as being the architect of the Chicago&#x27;s &#x27;machine politics&#x27; for a large part of the 20th century. Daley&#x27;s base was rooted largely in Bridgeport&#x27;s working-class Irish population with the 11th Ward as his vanguard. The 11th Ward Democratic party, which is headquartered in Bridgeport near 36th Street and Halsted, remains a stronghold of the Daley family today, until recently represented by Alderman Patrick Daley Thompson and still represented on the Cook County Board of Commissioners by his uncle John P. Daley. John Daley is also the Democratic Committeeman for the 11th ward. Alderman Thompson represents the third generation of the Daley family to serve in Chicago politics. He is the grandson of Richard J. Daley and the nephew of Richard M. Daley. Thompson was sworn into office in May 2015 (serving until a criminal conviction in February 2022 disqualified him from public office).

In the 2016 presidential election, Bridgeport went for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump by a two-to-one margin. Residents cast 7,471 votes for Clinton, 2,859 votes for Trump, and approximately 550 ballots for third party candidates. In 2012, Barack Obama won Bridgeport by a larger margin of nearly three-to-one. The area cast 6,988 votes for Obama, 2,352 votes for Mitt Romney, and approximately 200 votes were cast for third party candidates.

Bridgeport is represented in the Illinois Senate by Tony Muñoz and in the Illinois House of Representatives by Theresa Mah.

==Education==
Chicago Public Schools operates several primary schools in Bridgeport: Mark Sheridan Academy, Philip D. Armour School, Robert Healy School, Charles N. Holden School, and George B. McClellan School. Neighborhood residents are zoned to Tilden High School in the Canaryville neighborhood just south of Bridgeport.

Neighborhood Parochial elementary schools in Bridgeport operate under supervision of the Archdiocese of Chicago: Bridgeport Catholic Academy, Santa Lucia School, St. Jerome School, St. Mary School and St. Therese School Bridgeport Campus (formerly St Barbara School). In 2018 the archdiocese announced that St. Barbara School would merge into St. Therese as their respective parishes were also merging. In 2019 the St. Barbara School became the St. Therese Bridgeport campus.

The Richard J. Daley Branch of the Chicago Public Library system is located at 3400 South Halsted Street.

==Culture==

In 2008 the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; listed Bridgeport as one of the four most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in Chicago, alongside Albany Park, West Ridge, and Rogers Park.
A traditionally working-class neighborhood, with a diverse ethnic heritage, Bridgeport&#x27;s cultural history has left an indelible mark on Chicago cuisine. While pizza is well represented in Bridgeport, it is the breaded-steak sandwich served by most of the neighborhood&#x27;s pizzerias, that the neighborhood can claim as an original. Chinese and Mexican fare are also well represented, particularly along 31st Street, Halsted Street, and Archer Avenue. Bridgeport in the early 21st century has also begun to experience an upswing in new restaurants, with a few recent additions serving a wide range of items.

The neighborhood is served by the &quot;Bridgeport News&quot;, a community newspaper delivered weekly on Wednesdays to homes throughout the neighborhood.
==Television==
Fictional Chicago Police Department Sergeant Hank Voight lives in Bridgeport.

<text>The gray-bellied night monkey (Aotus lemurinus), also called the grey-legged douroucouli or lemurine owl monkey, is a small New World monkey of the family Aotidae. Native to tropical and subtropical forests of South America, the gray-bellied night monkey faces a significant threat from hunting, harvesting for use in pharmaceutical research and habitat destruction.

==Taxonomy==
There have been up to four subspecies of the gray-bellied night monkey. All but the nominate subspecies have been elevated to full species rank. The three species formally considered subspecies are:
* Brumback&#x27;s night monkey, &quot;Aotus brumbacki&quot;
* Gray-handed night monkey, &quot;Aotus griseimembra&quot;
* Panamanian night monkey, &quot;Aotus zonalis&quot;

Additionally, Hershkovitz&#x27;s night monkey &quot;Aotus hershkovitzi&quot; is now considered to be a junior synonym for &quot;A. lemurinus&quot;.

==Description==
Like other members of their genus, this species is nocturnal; its small, round head is striped with black and is dominated by two large, brown eyes. The overall effect is not unlike an owl; the monkey&#x27;s eyes shine a reddish orange by reflected light. Its white eyebrows are bushy, with a patch of darker fur between them. Its grey fur is described as dense and woolly, with the animal&#x27;s underside being yellow to orange in colour. Its brownish black to orange tail is not prehensile and invariably tipped with black.

The gray-bellied night monkey has slender limbs with long, delicate fingers; its fingertip pads are wide. Adults may attain a weight of 1.3 kilograms; there is no sexual dimorphism observed.

==Habitat and diet==
Found in both dry and moist areas, the gray-bellied night monkey occupies all levels of the forest canopy; however, it is seldom found on the ground. It prefers dense vegetation with tangles of vines where the trees are evenly dispersed. Its range is from Colombia and north-eastern Argentina to Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama; it is also found in the tropical Andes.

By day the monkey slumbers in the cavities of trees or in dense thickets; by night, it searches the canopy for a variety of food items. Primarily a frugivore (fruit-eating), this monkey also eats vegetation, insects, nectar, and even other small mammals and birds when fruit is scarce.

==Behaviour and reproduction==
Most active during twilight hours and periods of bright moonlight, the gray-bellied night monkey troop consists of a mated pair and their offspring, up to five individuals in total. This species is noted for the monogamous pair-bond it forms; parental duties are shared between the lead pair and the juveniles. However, it is the male who assumes the bulk of care giving and rearing responsibilities; the female serves only to nurse the infants. Remarkably, even if the male dies the female will refuse to take over from him.

Characteristically vociferous, the monkey produces a range of calls: from soft clicks and low-pitched guttural rumblings to owl-like hoots and high-pitched shrieks when threatened. When not feeding, the monkey is typically inactive. Like other members of its genus, the gray-bellied night monkey claims a relatively small territory of about 0.1 km². Scent is central to this monkey&#x27;s intraspecies communication; territories are marked with brown, oily secretions from the base of the tail.

Birthing peaks at the end of the dry season and in the midst of the wet season. Gestation averages 133 days, usually resulting in a single infant; twins are a rarity. There is only one litter per year. Sexual maturity is reached at 2.5 to 3.5 years of age, at which point the offspring disperse; that is, they leave the troop in search of an unattached mate.

<text>Maria Lucélia dos Santos (born 20 May 1957) is a Brazilian actress, director and producer. She received international acclaim for her leading role in the 1976 Rede Globo telenovela &quot;Isaura, The Slave Girl&quot;, broadcast in over 80 countries.

==Biography==
Maria Lucélia dos Santos was born in Santo André, São Paulo, to Maurílio Simões dos Santos and Maria Moura dos Santos. Her parents were both blue collar workers. She has two siblings: Maurílio Wagner and Cristina Santos, also an actress.

At age 9, Lucélia heard actress Cacilda Becker on the radio calling children to do an audition for a role in one of her plays, but her mother did not allow her to perform. She had developed a taste for performing arts since she had seen the play &quot;A Moreninha&quot;, starred by Marília Pêra, in a school trip. Lucélia was completely fascinated by the show and decided that she would be an actress for the rest of her days.

==Career==
She made her stage debut at the age of 14, in the children&#x27;s play &quot;Dom Chicote Mula Manca e seu fiel companheiro Zé Chupança&quot;, replacing actress Débora Duarte, which had moved to Rio de Janeiro in order to star in the Rede Globo telenovela &quot;Bicho do Mato&quot;. She was then invited by Eugênio Kusnet to participate in his intensive two-year performing arts course. After the course, Lucélia acted in a production of &quot;Godspell&quot;, which was presented in a circus tent in the Rio de Janeiro neighborhood of Botafogo. She finished high school in Rio, where she took the vestibular test for Medicine by an imposition of her father. She failed to enter in the University, since she was already deeply involved with her acting career.

Lucélia worked as a receptionist in a weight-loss clinic. before starring in productions of the plays &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; and &quot;Transe no 18&quot;, Due to her early stage success, Lucélia was invited to star in the film &quot;Paranóia&quot; in 1976, at the age of 19. After three other small roles in unsuccessful films, that same year she landed the leading role in &quot;Escrava Isaura&quot;, which tells the story of the struggle of a white-skinned black slave to find happiness during the Brazilian Empire. The telenovela, based on the novel of the same name by 19th century abolitionist writer Bernardo Guimarães, is the most dubbed program in the history of world television, according to a research conducted by &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Prior to being invited for the leading role by writer Gilberto Braga and director Herval Rossano, Lucélia had been turned down by Globo several times. She even landed a role in &quot;Estúpido Cupido&quot;, but that was wrapped up due to financial reasons.

&quot;Escrava Isaura&quot; achieved worldwide success. It became the most popular program in the history of Polish television at the time of its original broadcast, reaching more than 81 percent of share. It was the first show starred by a non-Chinese leading actress broadcast in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, in addition to being the first telenovela shown in the former Soviet Union, where it had a broad appeal. The word &quot;fazenda&quot; () jokingly became a synonym for the small land properties given by the government through its perestroika economic program. In the show, &quot;fazenda&quot; is used as a synonym for plantation.

In 1980, in an attempt to break with the image of &quot;Brazil&#x27;s sweetheart&quot;, acquired with her role in the telenovela, she posed nude for the Brazilian version of &quot;Playboy&quot;. The April issue of the magazine sold extremely well. It was, however, in the movies that her attempt would succeed. Controversial playwright Nelson Rodrigues invited Lucélia to star in the film adaptation of his play &quot;Bonitinha mas Ordinária&quot;. Knowing that was the perfect chance to break the good girl stigma, she accepted. She would later act in two other adaptations of Rodrigues&#x27; plays: &quot;Engraçadinha&quot; and &quot;Álbum de família&quot;.

In 1981, Lucélia posed naked for &quot;Playboy&quot; again, in order to promote the film &quot;Luz del Fuego&quot;, which tells the story of the eponymous ballerina which shocked the Brazilian society of the early 1950s by founding the a naturist political party and creating the first clothes-free area in Brazil at an island in Baía de Guanabara. The film is one of the favorites of Fidel Castro, who owns a VHS copy of it.

After the success of &quot;Escrava Isaura&quot;, Lucélia continued making popular Rede Globo telenovelas, such as &quot;Locomotivas&quot; (1977), &quot;Dancin&#x27; Days&quot; (1978), &quot;Água Viva&quot; (1980), &quot;Ciranda de Pedra&quot; (1981), &quot;Guerra dos Sexos&quot; (1986), &quot;Vereda Tropical&quot; (1984), and &quot;Sinhá Moça&quot; (1986). She also starred the network&#x27;s series &quot;Ciranda Cirandinha&quot; (1978) and miniseries &quot;Meu Destino é Pecar&quot; (1984), also based in Rodrigues&#x27; work. In 1987 she left Globo to star as the titular character in Rede Manchete&#x27;s &quot;Carmem&quot;.

In 1990, Lucélia starred in SBT&#x27;s &quot;Brasileiros e Brasileiras&quot;. She also took the lead in the network&#x27;s &quot;Sangue do Meu Sangue&quot; in 1995. In 1996 she decided to take the lead role in SBT&#x27;s controversial telenovela &quot;Dona Anja&quot;, about a brothel owner in a small Rio Grande do Sul town during the military dictatorship. In 1997 she directed the television documentary &quot;O ponto de Mutaçâo da China Hoje&quot; about life in current China, which was aired in Manchete. In 2001, she returned to Globo for the 2001 season of teen series &quot;Malhação&quot;.

Also in 2001, after the Independence of East Timor, Lucélia directed the documentary &quot;Timor Lorosae - O Massacre Que o Mundo Não Viu&quot;, which investigates the killings of political activists by Indonesian forces. It was banned from the Jakarta International Film Festival.

In August 2007, Lucélia started playing Suzana Mayer in &quot;Donas de Casa Desesperadas&quot;, the Brazilian version of the &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, broadcast by RedeTV!. Her most recent role is as Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&#x27;s primary teacher in &quot;Lula, o filho do Brasil&quot;.

==Personal life==
She was married to classical composer and conductor John Neschling, whom she divorced. Their son, Pedro Neschling (born June 28, 1982), is also an actor.

Lucélia has always been a friend of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, since her parents&#x27; house was located in front of the Santo André labor union headquarters, where then metallurgist Lula began his political career. Her involvement with the Workers&#x27; Party emerged in the late 1970s, when some outlawed from the military regime began to return to Brazil and continues until the present day. She was engaged in all of Lula&#x27;s presidential campaigns. In addition to her support of the Workers&#x27; Party, Lucélia was also one of the first artists to support the Green Party, raising awareness to the problems of deforestation. She has also supported Diretas Já and breastfeeding.

<text>The Argentine Navy (ARA; ) is the navy of Argentina. It is one of the three branches of the Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic, together with the Army and the Air Force.

The Argentine Navy day is celebrated on May 17, anniversary of the victory in 1814 at the Battle of Montevideo over the Spanish fleet during the war of Independence.

==History==
===1810–1909===
The Argentine Navy was created in the aftermath of the May Revolution of May 25, 1810, which started the war for independence from Spain. The navy was first created to support Manuel Belgrano in the Paraguay campaign, but those ships were sunk by ships from Montevideo, and did not take part in that conflict. Renewed conflicts with Montevideo led to the creation of a second fleet, which participated in the capture of the city. As Buenos Aires had little maritime history, most men in the navy were from other nations, such as the Irish-born admiral William Brown, who directed the operation. As the cost of maintaining a navy was too high, most of the Argentine naval forces were composed of privateers.

Brown led the Argentine navy in further naval conflicts at the War with Brazil and the Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata.

In the 1870s the Argentine Navy began modernizing itself. At the close of the century, the force included:

* 5 armoured cruisers
* 4 coastal defence ironclads
* 3 second-class, high-speed, British-built cruisers
* 7 modern small cruisers and gunboats
* 4 destroyers
* 22 torpedo boats

The most powerful ships at this time included the Italian-built and her sister ships: , , and , each at over 6,000 tons. Three older ironclads, , , and dated from the 1880s and early 1890s.

The navy&#x27;s ships were built primarily in Italy, Britain, France, and Spain, and were operated by over 600 officers and 7,760 seamen. These were supported by a battalion of marines and an artillery battery.

===1910–1982===

A naval arms race between Argentina, Brazil and Chile, the most powerful and wealthy countries in South America, began when the Brazilian government ordered three dreadnoughts. The first, &quot;Minas Geraes&quot;, was commissioned into the Brazilian Navy in 1910.

For most of both world wars, Argentina was neutral, only declaring war on the Axis in March 1945. In 1940 Argentina&#x27;s navy was ranked the eighth most powerful in the world (after the European powers, Japan, and the United States) and the largest in Latin America. A ten-year building programme costing $60 million had produced a force of 14,500 sailors and over a thousand officers. The fleet included two First World War-era (but modernized) American-built s, three modern cruisers, a dozen British-built destroyers, and three submarines, plus minelayers, minesweepers, coastal defence ships, and gunboats. A naval air force was also in operation.

In the postwar period, Naval Aviation and Marine units were put under direct Navy command. With Brazil, Argentina is one of two South American countries to have operated two aircraft carriers: the and .

The Argentine Navy has been traditionally heavily involved in fishery protection, helping the Coast Guard: most notably in 1966 a destroyer fired on and holed a Soviet trawler that had refused to be escorted to Mar del Plata, in the 1970s there were four more incidents with Soviet and Bulgarian ships followed by other incidents such as the sinking of the Chian-der 3.

The Navy also took part in all military coups in Argentina through the 20th century. During the 1976 to 1983 dictatorship, Navy personnel were involved in the Dirty War in which thousands of people were kidnapped, tortured and killed by the forces of the military junta, similar to practices which are now known as enforced disappearance. The Navy School of Mechanics, known as ESMA, was a notorious centre for torture. Among their more well-known victims were the Swedish teenager Dagmar Hagelin, and French nuns Alice Domon and Léonie Duquet (In October 2007 the Argentine Navy formally handed possession of the school to human rights groups to turn it into a memorial museum).

During this regime, the Navy was also the main supporter of a military solution for the country&#x27;s two longest-standing disputes: the Beagle Conflict with Chile and the Falkland Islands () with the United Kingdom.

===Falklands War, 1982===

During the 1982 Falklands War the main Argentine naval fleet consisted of modernised World War II era ships (one GUPPY-type submarine, one British-built carrier, a cruiser, and four destroyers), and newer vessels: two Type 42 destroyers, three French-built corvettes, and one German-built Type 209 submarine. This fleet was supported by several ELMA tankers and transports, as well as an ice breaker and a polar transport ship.

New German MEKO type destroyers, corvettes, and Thyssen-Nordseewerke (Type TR-1700) submarines were still under construction at the time.

After leading the invasion of the Falkland Islands, the Argentine fleet played only a small part in the subsequent conflict. After sank , the Argentine surface fleet did not venture from a 12-mile (22.2 km) coastal limit imposed by the British.

The Argentine Navy&#x27;s contribution to the war was principally the initial amphibious assaults on 2 and 3 April; naval aviation Super Étendards armed with Exocet missiles, which sank and the ; Skyhawks, which sank ; and the Marines, with the 5th Marine Corps Battalion defending Mount Tumbledown. In addition, the Type 42 destroyer , operated off Isla de los Estados (en: Staten Island). A land-based Exocet battery outside Port Stanley scored a direct hit on on 11 June; and a Marine Tigercat SAM put a Royal Air Force Harrier (XW 919) out of action on 12 June. Naval aviation also carried out intensive maritime patrols, searching to locate the British fleet for the strike aircraft and British submarines for the anti-submarine Sea King helicopters, while their Lockheed L-188 Electra and Fokker F-28 Fellowship transports reinforced the Port Stanley garrison and evacuated the wounded.

The submarine also played a strategic role, nearly sinking the frigate on 10 May, although she scored no hits. The submarine , after a successful resupply mission, was attacked and disabled off South Georgia, where her crew then surrendered along with the Argentine detachment at Grytviken. She was later scuttled by the British.

===Aftermath of the Falklands War===

The core of the fleet was reformed with the retirement of all the World War II-era and s and their replacement with the MEKO 360 and 140 classes designed by the German shipyard Blohm + Voss.

Also, the submarine force greatly reinforced its assets with the introduction of the Thyssen-Nordseewerke (TR-1700) class. Although the original programme called for six units with the last four to be built in Argentina, only the two built in Germany were delivered.

The amphibious force was drastically affected with the retirement of their only LST landing ship and replacement by a modified cargo vessel, the . This situation was expected to improve in 2006 with the delivery by France of the first of the LPD s but the whole operation was placed on hold by the Argentine Government due to asbestos concerns. In 2010 France offered the instead.

France also transferred the , now , multi-product replenishment ship (AOR).

In 1988 the A-4 Skyhawk aircraft were withdrawn, leaving the Super Étendard as the only fighter jets in the navy inventory. The already-paid-for A-4Hs bought in Israel as their replacement could not be delivered due to the embargo imposed by the United States after the war. Instead IAI used the money to refurbish the S-2E Trackers to the S-2T Turbo Tracker variant currently in service.

In the 1990s, the embargo was lifted and the Lockheed L-188 Electras (civilian aircraft converted for maritime patrol) were finally retired and replaced with similar P-3B Orions and civilian Beechcraft King Air Model 200 were locally converted to the MP variant.

In 2000 the aircraft carrier was decommissioned without replacement, although the navy maintains the air group of Super Étendard jets and S-2 Trackers that routinely operated from the Brazilian Navy aircraft carrier or United States Navy carriers when they are in transit in the south Atlantic during Gringo-Gaucho manoeuvers.

===Gulf War and nineties===
Argentina was the only Latin American country to participate in the 1991 Gulf War, sending a destroyer and a corvette in a first deployment and a supply ship and another corvette later to participate in the United Nations blockade and sea control effort in the Persian Gulf. &quot;Operación Alfil&quot; (&quot;&quot;), as it was known, carried out more than 700 interceptions and sailed 25,000 miles in the operations theatre.

From 1990 to 1992, the s were deployed under UN mandate ONUCA to the Gulf of Fonseca in Central America. In 1994, the three s participated in Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti.

=== 21st century ===
In 2003, for the first time, the Argentine Navy (classified as major non-NATO ally) interoperated with a United States Navy battle group when the destroyer joined the Carrier Strike Group and Destroyer Squadron 18 as a part of Exercise &quot;Solid Step&quot; during their tour in the Mediterranean Sea.

In 2010 the construction of four 1,800 ton offshore patrol ships was announced, but never started. Instead, Argentina ultimately opted to acquire four Gowind-class offshore patrol vessels from France. The decision was motivated by the meeting between Argentine President Mauricio Macri and French President Emmanuel Macron at the annual World Economic Forum summit in Davos, Switzerland in 2018. In November 2018, Argentina confirmed the purchase of the patrol vessels. The purchase included the already-built , which in 2016 visited the region on a marketing trip, as well as three new-build vessels. Following their construction in France, all four ships had been delivered to Argentina by 2022.

In October 2012 the Navy&#x27;s sail training ship was seized under court order in Ghana by creditors of Argentina&#x27;s debt default in 2002.
On 15 December 2012 the UN International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ruled unanimously that the ship had immunity as a military vessel, and ordered that &quot;Ghana should forthwith and unconditionally release the frigate ARA &quot;Libertad&quot;&quot; Four days later &quot;Libertad&quot; was released from Tema and arrived to the port of Mar del Plata on 9 January 2013.

The Argentine Navy is under-funded and struggling to meet maintenance and training requirements; as a result, only 15 of its 42 vessels are in a condition to sail. The 2013 defence budget allowed for the 15 operational vessels to each spend less than 11 days at sea, while the submarines averaged just over 6 hours submerged in the whole of 2012. spent 73 days in late 2012 stranded in South Africa for lack of spares. The s are short of spares and their ordnance has expired, while the Antarctic patrol ship had been under repair for 10 years because of a fire. On 23 January 2013 the Type 42 destroyer sank at her moorings after having been mothballed for ten years.

The Argentine Navy participates in joint exercises with other friendly navies including Brazil, United States, Spain, France, Canada, South Africa, Italy, Uruguay, and, since the 1990s, Chile. The exercises are routinely held to develop a common operational doctrine. Every year the Argentine and Chilean Navies participate in the &quot;Patrulla Antártica Naval Combinada&quot; () to guarantee safety to all tourist and scientific ships in transit within the Antarctic Peninsula, where the Navy is also directly responsible for maintaining the Argentine bases there.

==== &quot;San Juan&quot; Disaster and Submarine Fleet Renewal Problem ====

On 15 November 2017, the ARA &quot;San Juan&quot; (S-42) stopped communicating during a routine transit to port following a military exercise. A search was launched by ISMERLO, however after 15 days of searching the Argentine Navy declared the end of the rescue operation, and solely focused on the recovery of the submarine—not the crew. 44 personnel were on the submarine when it disappeared. The final report made by Argentine congressmen stated that president Mauricio Macri and his defence minister had political responsibilities about what happened to ARA San Juan. Lack of funding for maintenance and personnel training had been identified as a chronic problem for the submarine service. After the &quot;San Juan&quot; disaster, the submarine service no longer maintained any active vessels.

In 2019, the governments of Brazil and Argentina were working on a transfer deal of the four Tupi IKL209/1400 submarines currently operated by the Brazilian Navy. Two of the Brazilian submarines are currently non operational pending repairs, the other two are still active pending their replacement by the 4 Scorpene type submarines currently under construction. However, in the early 2000s they had been upgraded with new combat systems by Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems and Sensors. This gave the submarines the ability to carry and fire the MK 48 MOD 6AT ADCAP Torpedo. Although there are some reservations about the deal, the defense ministers and admirals of the Argentine Navy were enthusiastic about moving forward with it. The submarines were to be repaired and serviced in the Tandanor drydock facility. If the deal moves forward it would allow Argentina to restore its submarine capability which is currently defunct. As an alternative, in 2021 a Russian delegation visited the TANDANOR shipyard and other defence facilities, reportedly also making an offer to supply either the Improved Kilo-class submarine or the export variant of the Lada-class submarine to the Argentine Navy.

In July 2022, in the context of Argentina&#x27;s desire to replace its submarine fleet, defence minister Jorge Taiana paid a visit to the Naval Group shipyard in Cherbourg to examine the construction process for the Scorpène-class submarine. Minister Taiana also visited Germany for a meeting with his ministerial counterpart, in order to explore the possibility of acquiring German-built submarines, either independently or in tandem with an interim acquisition of the Brazilian Navy&#x27;s &quot;Tupi&quot;-class boats. However, it still remained unclear whether Argentina had either the financial resources or the political will to pursue any submarine replacement.

==== Maritime Patrol Aircraft Replacement ====

In 2019, Argentina was also pursuing the procurement of four P-3C Orion aircraft from US Navy surplus stocks since Argentina&#x27;s fleet of P-3B&#x27;s were no longer operational since 2019. The package deal was approved in September 2019. The US State Department has cleared the transaction of $78.03m to be carried out as part of a foreign military sale. It includes the delivery of related equipment and services. Argentina will receive four turboprop engines for the aircraft and an additional four turboprop engines. It will also receive communications and radar equipment, Infrared/Electro-optic equipment, and aviation life support systems. The US will provide spares plus repairs, aircraft depot maintenance, and logistical support. Contractors for the deal include Logistic Services International, Lockheed Martin, Rockwell Collins and Eagle Systems. These newer Orions will be up to the latest Orion standard, and provide Argentina with a much needed boost in anti-submarine and maritime surveillance missions.

However, in the aftermath of the inauguration of Alberto Fernández as president in December 2019, the deal appeared to be in limbo with the Navy now apparently considering completing the refurbishment of its older P-3B fleet pending the outcome of further discussions around the P-3C acquisition. As of early 2021, it was planned that, after upgrades, the P-3B would be returned to service starting in 2022. In December 2022, it was reported that the refurbishment of the P-3B was proceeding slower than anticipated and while a revised delivery date of the first upgraded P-3B had been projected for September 2023, that schedule might now face delays. In February 2023 it was reported that Argentina was negotiating with Norway to purchase three or four of its surplus P-3Cs. The agreement to purchase four aircraft was signed in October 2023. It had been hoped that the aircraft would be delivered in late 2023. However, by years end the aircraft had not been delivered due to an Argentine failure to make the required payment. In March 2024, it was reported that initial payments had been made. Delivery of the first aircraft took place in September 2024, with the remaining aircraft to follow in 2025.

==== Future of the Fleet ====
In 2020, the Argentine national government created an interministerial committee with the objective of reassuring national oceans&#x27; sovereignty. In 2020, the Ministry of Defence informed Congress of a desire to acquire a Landing Platform Dock (LPD) as well as two naval transport vessels to increase logistical capacity, including in relation to the country&#x27;s claims and presence in the Antarctic. In March 2023, an agreement was signed by Defence Minister Jorge Taiana for the Tandanor and Río Santiago shipyards to develop a multipurpose landing ship for the Argentine Navy. A polar ship and floating dock were also planned. As of early 2024, the prospective projects remained under evaluation.

Foreign overfishing is a serious concern and, in 2020, the Argentine Navy captured at least two foreign ships allegedly illegally fishing in the South Atlantic. Foreign, mostly Chinese, illegal fishing in Argentine territorial waters has been estimated to cost Argentina between US$1 billion and $2.6 billion per year. In 2016, the Argentine Coast Guard chased and sank a Chinese fishing boat that was reported to have been fishing illegally in Argentine waters. Partially to address this, a project for the re-focus of two Espora-class corvettes on patrol duties was reportedly under development. One of the corvettes subsequently selected for conversion to the offshore patrol role was ARA &quot;Parker&quot;. Subsequently in June 2024, the chief of the Argentine Navy, Vice Admiral Carlos María Allievi, suggested that the idea of converting any additional Espora-class vessels to the offshore patrol role had been abandoned.

It remained to be determined how the several envisaged new-acquisition projects would be funded. For instance, the proposed submarine acquisition from Brazil would require extensive refurbishment of the vessels prior to being ready for renewed operational service with the Argentine Navy. As of the end of 2022, the mooted submarine deal with Brazil had not yet been finalised and the process of refurbishment not yet begun. In 2021, one analyst noted that over the past thirty years the Argentine navy has lost many core capabilities, including its aircraft carrier (along with most of its fixed-wing combat aviation), submarines and area air defence vessels. Most of these seemed unlikely to be reconstituted.

== Structure ==

The Argentine navy has four main commands: High Seas Fleet, Submarine Force, Naval Aviation, and Naval Infantry (Marines). Additionally, on January 1, 2022, a Joint Maritime Command was established under the Joint Chiefs of Staff to defend Argentina&#x27;s maritime sovereignty.

=== Sea Fleet ===

Puerto Belgrano Naval Base (, abbreviated &quot;BNPB&quot;) is the largest naval base of the Argentine Navy, situated next to Punta Alta, near Bahía Blanca, about 700 km (435 mi) south of Buenos Aires. Most of the fleet is based there.

=== Submarine Force ===

The Submarine Force Command (, abbreviated &quot;COFS&quot;) was created when the Navy first started using submarines in 1927. The Tactical Divers Group is under the submarine force command structure. However, as of 2020 there were no operational submarines in service.

=== Naval Aviation ===

The Naval Aviation Command (, abbreviated &quot;COAN&quot;) is the naval aviation branch. Argentina is one of two South American countries to have operated two aircraft carriers. However, neither remain in service. During the Falkland&#x27;s War, Argentine naval aviation employed the Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard fighter and its Exocet air-to-surface missiles being responsible for the destruction of both HMS Sheffield as well as the merchant vessel Atlantic Conveyor. Efforts to upgrade and retain the Super Etendard in service were initially reported to have been abandoned in 2023 due to a combination of U.K. sanctions impacting the ability to obtain spare parts for the Martin Baker Mk. 6 ejection seats and due France&#x27;s inability to provide other spare parts for the aging aircraft. Five refurbished aircraft had been delivered from France in 2019. However, these aircraft have not been brought into service due to the spare parts problem. Subsequent to the report that that aircraft would not be brought into service, the Argentine Navy issued a statement that the process had not in fact been abandoned. In early 2024, it was reported that the Navy was still working to restore at least two of the aircraft to flying condition.

=== Naval Infantry ===

The Naval Infantry Command () is the Argentine Navy&#x27;s marine branch. Naval infantry have the same rank, insignia, and titles as the rest of the Navy, and are deployed abroad on UN peacekeeping missions.

=== Hydrographic Service ===
The Argentine Naval Hydrographic Service (, abbreviated &quot;SHN&quot;) provides national hydrographics services.

=== Joint Maritime Command ===
The Joint Maritime Command (CCM, in Spanish) was established on January 1, 2022 and brings together Argentine Army, Navy and Air Force assets to combat maritime crime and to control ocean and river areas under its jurisdiction. Its principal maritime assets are the navy&#x27;s patrol vessels, including its Gowind-class offshore patrol vessels.

==Ranks==

===Officers===
Rank insignia consists of a variable number of gold-braid stripes worn on the sleeve cuffs or on shoulder-boards. Officers may be distinguished by the characteristic loop of the top stripe (in the manner of British Royal Navy officers). Combat uniforms may include metal pin-on or embroidered collar rank insignia. Rank insignia is worn on the chest when in shipboard or flying coveralls.

Officers are commissioned in either the Command (line) Corps (those who attend the Escuela Naval Militar- Military Naval College) or the Staff Corps (Professional Officers who only attend a short course in the Naval Academy after getting a civilian degree, except for the Paymasters who instead attend the Naval College).

The Line Corps is divided into three branches: the Naval branch (including Surface Warfare, Submarine Warfare and Naval Aviation sub-branches), the Marine Corps branch, and Executive -Engineering- branch. Line Corps&#x27; reserve officers are considered Restricted Line ( &quot;Escalafon Complementario&quot; ) officers in any of the Warfare Communities (Surface, Submarine, Marines, Aviation and Propulsion), and can only raise to OF-4 rank ( &quot;Capitan de Fragata&quot; ).

All Line Corps officers wear distinctive branch/sub-branch insignia on the right breast. Some Staff Corps officers also wear specialisation badges (Aviation, Surface, Submarine and Marines). Other common insignia is the Naval War College insignia, parachute wings, etc., also worn on the right breast. Medals and Ribbons, if awarded, are worn on the left breast, just above the chest pocket. The rank insignia of Staff Corps&#x27; officers is placed over a background colour denoting the wearer&#x27;s field, such as purple (Chaplains), blue (Engineers), red (Health Corps), white (Paymasters), green (Judge Advocate Officers), brown (Technical Officers, promoted from the ranks) and grey (special branch). The background colour for Command Corps officers is navy blue/black.

===Enlisted ratings and Non-Commissioned Officers===
Other ranks&#x27; insignia (not including Seamen) is worn on either shoulderboards or breast or sleeve patches. Seamen and Seamen Recruits wear their insignia on their sleeves. The shoulderboards denote the wearer&#x27;s specialty.

== Uniform ==

===Beards===
Following a global trend, Argentine armed forces have prohibited beards since the 1920s. This was reinforced in the Cold War era when they were deemed synonymous with leftist leanings. The only exception were Antarctic service within the three armed forces as a protection from cold weather, and submarine service within the Navy as a way of saving water. However, shaving was mandatory upon return to headquarters.

In 2000 the Navy broke with this tradition within the Argentine armed forces as Adm. Joaquín Stella, then Navy Chief of Staff allowed beards for officers with ranks above &quot;Teniente de Corbeta&quot; (Second Lieutenant), according to Section 1.10.1.1 of the Navy Uniform regulations (R.A-1-001). Adm. Stella gave the example himself by becoming the first bearded Argentine admiral since Adm. Sáenz Valiente in the 1920s. Non commissioned officers can wear beards from &quot;Suboficial Segundo&quot; rank, and upwards. However, beards were prohibited again in 2016, except for some specific office positions.

<text>The Battle of Nashville was a two-day battle in the Franklin-Nashville Campaign that represented the end of large-scale fighting west of the coastal states in the American Civil War. It was fought at Nashville, Tennessee, on December 15–16, 1864, between the Confederate Army of Tennessee under Lieutenant General John Bell Hood and the Union Army of the Cumberland (Dept. of the Cumberland) (AoC) under Major General George H. Thomas. In one of the largest victories achieved by the Union Army during the war, Thomas attacked and routed Hood&#x27;s army, largely destroying it as an effective fighting force.

== Military situation ==


Hood followed up his defeat in the Atlanta Campaign by moving northwest to disrupt the supply lines of Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman from Chattanooga, hoping to challenge Sherman into a battle that could be fought to Hood&#x27;s advantage. After a brief period in which he pursued Hood, Sherman decided instead to cut his main army off from these lines and &quot;live off the land&quot; in his famed March to the Sea from Atlanta to Savannah. By doing so, he would avoid having to defend hundreds of miles of supply lines against constant raids, through which he predicted he would lose &quot;a thousand men monthly and gain no result&quot; against Hood&#x27;s army. Sherman disengaged and turned east, leaving the matter of Hood&#x27;s army and the defense of Tennessee to Thomas. Hood devised a plan to march into Tennessee and defeat Thomas&#x27;s force while it was geographically divided. He pursued Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield&#x27;s army from Pulaski to Columbia and then attempted to intercept and destroy it at Spring Hill. Schofield had been tasked by Thomas with delaying Hood as much as possible, without losing his army, while Thomas pulled in his forces to concentrate at Nashville. Because of a series of Confederate command miscommunications and solid U.S. Army leadership in the Battle of Spring Hill (November 29, 1864), Schofield was able to withdraw from Columbia and slip past Hood&#x27;s army at Spring Hill relatively unscathed.

Furious at his failure at Spring Hill, Hood pursued Schofield to the north and encountered the Union at Franklin behind strong fortifications. In the Battle of Franklin on November 30, Hood ordered almost 31,000 of his men to assault the Union works before Schofield could withdraw across the Harpeth River and escape to Nashville. Schofield and his men were intent on getting across the Harpeth and really did not expect Hood and his army to attack; the fact that they did attack with such ferocity soon made the U.S. troops realize that they had changed from a delaying action to a desperate fight for survival. The Union soldiers repulsed multiple assaults and inflicted over 6,000 casualties on the Confederates, which included a large number of key Confederate generals, doing heavy damage to the leadership of the Army of Tennessee.

Schofield withdrew from Franklin during the night and marched into the defensive works of Nashville on December 1, there coming under the command of Thomas, who now had a combined force of approximately 55,000 men. By and large, his troops were veterans, the IV Corps under Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Wood and Schofield&#x27;s XXIII Corps having fought in the Atlanta campaign and Maj. Gen. Andrew J. Smith&#x27;s &quot;Detachment of the Army of the Tennessee&quot; (a part of the recently discontinued XVI Corps had been redesignated with this unusual name on December 6) having fought at Vicksburg, in the Red River Campaign, at Tupelo against S.D. Lee and Nathan Bedford Forrest, and in Missouri against Sterling Price. While Wilson&#x27;s cavalry had combat experience, most of it had been of the wrong kind at the hands of Nathan Bedford Forrest, John Hunt Morgan, or Joe Wheeler. Only Maj. Gen. James B. Steedman&#x27;s Division lacked experience fighting together. It was composed of garrison troops and railroad guards from Tennessee and Georgia and included eight regiments of United States Colored Troops.

Union forces had been constructing defensive works around Nashville since the time the city was occupied in February 1862. By 1864, a 7-mile-long semicircular Union defensive line on the south and west sides of the city protected Nashville from attacks from those directions. The line was studded with forts, the largest being Fort Negley. The trench line was extended to the west after December 1. The Cumberland River formed a natural defensive barrier on the north and east sides of the city. Smith&#x27;s troops had arrived by river on November 30, and their transports had been escorted by a powerful fleet of tinclad and ironclad gunboats. Thus, the river barrier was well-defended.

From east to west the defensive line was manned by Steedman&#x27;s division, the XXIII Corps, the IV Corps, and Smith&#x27;s XVI Corps Detachment. During the amassing of his forces and the construction of his defenses, Thomas&#x27; troops punctuated their entrenching with small offensive operations and raids.Given the fact that the Union Army was composed of troops from the Army of the Cumberland, the Army of the Ohio, the Army of the Tennessee, the District of Etowah, and the Post of Nashville, the force in Nashville had no official name.

Hood&#x27;s Army of Tennessee arrived south of the city on December 2 and took up positions facing the Union forces within the city. As he was not nearly strong enough to assault the Union fortifications, Hood opted for the defensive. Rather than repeating his fruitless frontal attack at Franklin, he entrenched and waited, hoping that Thomas would attack him. Then, after Thomas had smashed his army against the Confederate entrenchments, Hood could counterattack and take Nashville.

The Confederate line of about four miles of fortifications faced the southerly facing portion of the Union line (the part occupied by Steedman and Schofield). From right to left were the corps of Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Cheatham, Lt. Gen. Stephen D. Lee, and Lt. Gen. Alexander P. Stewart. Cavalry commanded by Brig. Gen. James R. Chalmers was off to the southwest of the city. The Confederate left flank was secured by five small detached redoubts, each having two to four guns with garrisons of about 150 men each. The weather turned cold and many Confederate soldiers took shelter in simple pits which were just big enough for two or three men to sleep alongside each other with a small fire at one end. Alabama soldier Edgar Jones wrote that while he enjoyed the warmth of his new home it gave him &quot;a sort of graveyard feeling&quot; since the shelters were remarkably similar to graves.

Hood made a serious strategic error before the battle. On December 2, he sent the three brigades of William B. Bate&#x27;s Division of Cheatham&#x27;s Corps to attack the Nashville &amp; Chattanooga Railroad between Nashville and Murfreesboro as well as the Union garrison in the latter city. Three days later, he sent an additional two brigades of infantry and two divisions of cavalry, all under Forrest&#x27;s command, to reinforce Bate. Hood believed this diversion would draw Thomas out of the Nashville fortifications, allowing Hood to either defeat Thomas in detail or to seize Nashville by a coup de main once its garrison was depleted. While the railroad between Nashville and Murfreesboro was broken in a number of places, the Murfreesboro garrison drove off the Confederates in the Third Battle of Murfreesboro (also called the Battle of the Cedars) on December 7. Furthermore, Thomas was not fooled by this diversion, and remained in his fortifications until he was ready to attack on his own terms. Bate&#x27;s Division and one of the two attached infantry brigades returned to Nashville, but Hood had seriously diminished his already outnumbered forces, and he had also deprived his army of its strongest and most mobile unit, Forrest and his cavalry.

==Opposing forces==
===Union===

The Union force (of about 55,000 men), was a conglomerate of units from several different departments provisionally attached to Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas&#x27; Department of the Cumberland or Army of the Cumberland and consisted of:

* IV Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Wood, with divisions commanded by Brig. Gens. Nathan Kimball, Washington Lafayette Elliott, and Samuel Beatty;
* Army of the Ohio, commanded by Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield, with divisions commanded by Maj. Gen. Darius N. Couch and Brig. Gen. Jacob D. Cox;
* &quot;Detachment of the Army of the Tennessee&quot; (former &quot;Right Wing, XVI Corps)&quot;, commanded by Maj. Gen. Andrew J. Smith, with divisions commanded by Brig. Gens. John McArthur and Kenner Garrard and Col Jonathan B. Moore;
* Provisional Detachment (District of the Etowah), commanded by Maj. Gen. James B. Steedman, with a division (named &quot;Provisional Division&quot;) commanded by Brig. Gen. Charles Cruft, two brigades of U.S.C.T. reporting directly to Steedman, and the Post of Nashville commanded by Brig. Gen. John F. Miller.
* Cavalry Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. James H. Wilson, with divisions commanded by Brig. Gen. Edward M. McCook, Edward Hatch, Richard W. Johnson, and Joseph F. Knipe.

===Confederate===

The Confederate Army of Tennessee under command of Gen. John B. Hood fielded approximately 30,000 men and consisting of 3 infantry army corps and 1 cavalry corps:

* Lee&#x27;s Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. Stephen D. Lee with 3 divisions;
* Stewart&#x27;s Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. Alexander P. Stewart with 3 divisions;
* Cheatham&#x27;s Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Cheatham with 3 divisions;
* Cavalry Corps, (detached at Murfreesboro and not engaged at Nashville) commanded by Maj. Gen. Nathan B. Forrest with 3 divisions.

==Thomas prepares to attack==
Although Thomas&#x27;s forces were much stronger, he could not ignore Hood&#x27;s army. Despite the severe beating it had suffered at Franklin, Hood&#x27;s Army of Tennessee presented a threat by its mere presence and ability to maneuver. Thomas knew he had to attack, but he prepared cautiously. His cavalry corps, commanded by the energetic young Brig. Gen. James H. Wilson, was poorly armed and mounted, and he did not want to proceed to a decisive battle without effective protection of his flanks. This was particularly important, since Wilson would be facing the horsemen of the formidable Forrest. Refitting the Union cavalry took time.

Meanwhile, Washington fumed at the seeming procrastination. When Sherman proposed his March to the Sea, Ulysses S. Grant and Henry Halleck had objected to it on the grounds that Hood would use the opportunity to invade Tennessee. In response, Sherman airily indicated that this was exactly what he wanted and that if Hood &quot;continues to march North, all the way to Ohio, I will supply him with rations.&quot; However, when the ever-confident Sherman disappeared into the heart of Georgia, Grant once again became concerned about an invasion of Kentucky or Ohio. Grant later said of the situation, &quot;If I had been Hood, I would have gone to Louisville and on north until I came to Chicago.&quot; His concern doubtless reflected Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s concern. Lincoln had little patience for slow generals and remarked of the situation, &quot;This seems like the McClellan and Rosecrans strategy of do nothing and let the rebels raid the country.&quot;

While pressure from Washington continued, a bitter ice storm struck Nashville on December 8, which precluded any offensive action. Sub-freezing weather continued through December 12. This was explained to Grant, but when Thomas had still not moved by December 13, Grant directed that Maj. Gen. John A. Logan proceed to Nashville and assume command if, upon his arrival, Thomas had not yet initiated operations. Logan made it as far as Louisville by December 15, but on that day the Battle of Nashville had finally begun. Grant himself left Petersburg on December 14 to take personal command and had only gotten as far as Washington when the battle began. He proceeded no further.

===Naval actions===

The Confederates set up batteries at Bell&#x27;s Bend on the Cumberland River below Nashville on December 2, 1864. They met with immediate success, capturing that day two Union transports carrying horses, mules and fodder. The Union naval squadron at Nashville responded on the night of December 3–4. While the bulk of the squadron engaged the upper battery, two ships, the ironclad &quot;Carondelet&quot; and the tinclad &quot;Fairplay&quot;, proceeded to the lower battery where they recaptured and brought off the two transports.

The Union squadron commander, Lt. Cmdr. LeRoy Fitch was ordered to break the river blockade. On December 7, he took his two heaviest ships, the ironclad USS &quot;Carondelet&quot; and the river monitor &quot;Neosho&quot;, downstream to engage the batteries. The action was inconclusive, although the &quot;Neosho&quot; sustained considerable superficial damage. Two &quot;Neosho&quot; sailors were awarded the Medal of Honor for going out onto the shell swept deck and raising the ship&#x27;s flag after it had been shot down.

The Confederate batteries effectively closed the river below Nashville to supply traffic until they finally were driven off by Union cavalry on December 15.

==Battle==
===December 15===

====Actions on the Confederate right====
Thomas&#x27;s plan was to launch a diversionary attack on the Confederate right that would distract them from the main attack on their left and perhaps cause them to divert troops from their left to their right. The attacking force consisted of two brigades drawn from Steedman&#x27;s Provisional Division: the First Colored Brigade, consisting of three regiments of United States Colored Troops (who had previously served as garrison troops or railroad guards), and a brigade composed of rear echelon white troops described by their commander as &quot;new conscripts, convalescents, and bounty jumpers.&quot;

The Confederate right was anchored on the west side of a deep cut on the Nashville &amp; Chattanooga Railroad. A weak skirmish line was posted east of the tracks, and on December 14 this was supplemented by a stout four-gun lunette manned by Granbury&#x27;s (Houghton&#x27;s after Granbury&#x27;s death at Franklin) Texas Brigade. Granbury&#x27;s lunette was well masked by trees and brush.

The two Union brigades advanced and overran the skirmish line. They then came under heavy artillery fire from a Confederate battery on the west side of the railroad. When the brigades passed Granbury&#x27;s Lunette, they were struck by very heavy close range enfilading fire. Both brigades retreated in some disorder, but they were reformed and continued for the rest of the day to fire on the Confederate works from the former skirmish line. The attack failed in its purpose, since the Confederates were not distracted and in fact had sent brigades from both Lee&#x27;s and Cheatham&#x27;s Corps to bolster the threatened left flank, however, Steedman&#x27;s attack did take the fortifications which made Hood&#x27;s left untenable and led to his withdrawal at nightfall.

====Actions on the Confederate left====
Thomas planned a huge wheeling movement that would ultimately come down on the Confederates&#x27; exposed left flank. Wilson&#x27;s Cavalry Corps moved west on Charlotte Pike, passing through the area of the Belle Meade Plantation, where a cavalry action involving three to four hundred troopers ensued.

Once an early morning fog dissipated, driving off the Confederate cavalry patrolling the area between the Confederate left and the Cumberland River. Smith&#x27;s XVI Corps detachment followed, turning south after a mile or so towards the Confederate flank. The cavalrymen formed on Smith&#x27;s right flank. Schofield&#x27;s XXIII followed in reserve, and as the assault moved south a gap opened between Smith and Wilson which Schofield was directed to fill. At about 2:30 pm, the Union troops attacked the five redoubts guarding the Confederate left. Four brigades, two of cavalry and two of infantry, overran Redoubt No. 4 and then Redoubt No. 5, notwithstanding the spirited resistance of the defenders of Redoubt No. 4. Another of Smith&#x27;s brigades captured Redoubt No. 3; however, its commander, Col. Sylvester G. Hill, was killed by Confederate artillery firing from Redoubt No. 2. He was the highest-ranking Union officer killed in the battle. Smith&#x27;s troops proceeded to Redoubt No. 2, which was quickly captured.

In the meantime, the IV Corps had been tasked with making a frontal assault from Granny White and Hillsboro Pikes on the left end of the Confederate line. The assault was to begin once Smith&#x27;s troops began their assault on the left flank redoubts. The Confederate line was supposed to lie on Montgomery Hill on the north side of Brown&#x27;s Creek. While the Confederates had originally established their line there, they had withdrawn to equally strong positions on the south side of Brown&#x27;s Creek, as the original positions were exposed to artillery fire from the Nashville forts. The IV Corps proceeded deliberately up Montgomery Hill, only to find that it was defended by a thin skirmish line. They stopped to reorganize, and at about the same time that Smith&#x27;s Detachment was rolling up the Confederate redoubts, they advanced on the main Confederate line.

Thus it happened that Redoubt No. 1, the last bastion on the Confederate left flank, was captured by troops coming from the north, south, and west. Stewart&#x27;s corps had been wrecked by the day&#x27;s fighting and retreated to a new line of defense a mile or two to the south. Rearguard actions by reinforcements from Lee&#x27;s Corps kept the retreat from becoming a rout. With the collapse of the Confederate left, Cheatham&#x27;s and Lee&#x27;s Corps followed to the new line.

===December 16===
====New disposition of Confederate army====

The Confederates&#x27; new line was much stronger and more compact than the first day&#x27;s line. It was anchored on the east on Peach Orchard Hill. The western flank ran along a line of hills leading south from Compton&#x27;s Hill, which after the day&#x27;s battle would be called Shy&#x27;s Hill after Col. William M. Shy, the Confederate officer commanding the 20th Tennessee Infantry, who died defending it. The center followed a series of sturdy dry stack stone walls enhanced by entrenching.

Hood put Lee&#x27;s Corps on the right flank. With the exception of two brigades, this corps had seen no action on the previous day, and indeed had seen very little action at the bloodletting at Franklin two weeks before. Lee&#x27;s line ran from the hill well into the Confederate center. Stewart&#x27;s Corps, decimated by heavy casualties at Franklin and in the December 15 actions, occupied the Confederate center. Cheatham&#x27;s Corps, badly hurt at Franklin, was on the Confederate left flank, which included Shy&#x27;s Hill and the line of hills to its south. Rucker&#x27;s cavalry brigade patrolled to the south of Cheatham&#x27;s Corps.

The Confederate line defenses atop Shy&#x27;s Hill appeared to be quite strong, as the steep hill dominated all of the surrounding terrain. However, appearances were deceiving. First, the defenses at the crest were a salient, and were exposed to Union artillery fire from all directions except the southeast. Second, the fortifications had been built overnight by tired troops and consisted of shallow trenches with no head logs or abatis. Third, and most fateful, the trenches were constructed on the geographical crest of the hill and not on the military crest commanding the slopes, so that attacking troops could escape fire until they were almost at the crest.

====Thomas&#x27;s plan====
Thomas repeated his tactics of the previous day. An attack would be made on the Confederate right to draw Confederate troops from the left. Then Schofield&#x27;s XXIII Corps would deliver a hammer blow on the left flank.

====Union attack on Peach Orchard====

The attacks on Peach Orchard Hill were made in much greater strength than those of December 15. Two brigades from Beatty&#x27;s division of Wood&#x27;s IV Corps and two brigades from Steedman&#x27;s Provisional Division made the attack at about 3 p.m. Concentrated musket and artillery fire from the entrenched Confederates quickly broke up the attack. The trailing regiment in the 2nd Colored Brigade of Steedman&#x27;s Division, the 13th United States Colored Troops, went in essentially on its own and gained the Confederate parapet, losing one of its flags and 220 officers and men in the process, about 40% of the regiment&#x27;s strength.

The attack on Peach Orchard Hill had the desired effect. Hood sent two of Cheatham&#x27;s brigades to reinforce Lee. The thin Confederate line on Shy&#x27;s Hill and the surrounding heights got thinner.

====Union attack on Shy&#x27;s Hill====
During this time Wilson&#x27;s cavalry was very active on the Confederate left and rear, reaching past Granny White Pike. In response, Cheatham stretched his corps further and further to the south. Thomas, who was with Schofield, directed Schofield to make an attack on the western face of Shy&#x27;s Hill. Schofield, imagining that he was outnumbered and in danger of an attack on his southern flank, demurred, requested that Smith send him additional divisions. Thomas directed Smith to comply with this request. Smith sent a division, and still Schofield did nothing.

Sunset was rapidly approaching, and if no attack was made before then Hood would be in a position to either strengthen his position overnight or safely retreat south.

Brig. Gen. John McArthur, one of Smith&#x27;s division commanders, was aware of this. He also saw that the Confederate lines were being badly battered by Union artillery, which was firing on them from nearly every direction. At about 3:30 p.m. he sent a message to Smith and Thomas that unless he were given orders to the contrary, his division was going to attack Shy&#x27;s Hill and the Confederate line immediately to its east in the next five minutes.

The three brigade attack began on McArthur&#x27;s timetable. One brigade went up and over Shy&#x27;s Hill. Because of the misplacement of the Confederate trenches, only the regiment on the east sustained significant casualties from Confederates, who were firing from the plain to its left. McArthur&#x27;s second brigade hit these Confederates while they were so distracted. The third brigade, attacking to the east of Granny White Pike caught a large body of Confederate skirmishers outside of their lines and went into the Confederate lines with them.

====Confederate left flank disintegrates====
The Confederate left flank suddenly disintegrated. The Confederate line was rolled up west to east. Granny White Pike had been blocked by Wilson&#x27;s cavalry. The Confederates retreated to the south by the Franklin Pike and a gap in the Overton Hills through the Otter Creek bottom. A part of Lee&#x27;s Corps maintained good order and covered the retreat on Franklin Pike. Rucker&#x27;s Confederate cavalry brigade performed the same service in a nighttime melee in the rain on Granny White Pike.

===Hood&#x27;s retreat===
On the night of December 16, what was left of Hood&#x27;s army headed south towards Franklin on two roads, Franklin Pike and Granny White Pike. Rucker having blunted for the time being the Union pursuit on Granny White Pike, the main pursuit was by Union cavalry on Franklin Pike. Lee&#x27;s rearguard held off the attacks.

At this point, the pursuit slowed because Thomas had sent his pontoon bridge train towards Murfreesboro rather than Franklin and Columbia, and his artillery and supply trains could not cross the Harpeth River until the pontoon train arrived. This did not stop Wilson&#x27;s cavalry from aggressively pursuing the Confederates as they retreated to Columbia. Wilson badly hurt Carter L. Stevenson&#x27;s rearguard division in actions on December 17 and 18, but was forced to stop because of the lack of supplies. Wilson&#x27;s problems were compounded when Forrest and his two cavalry divisions arrived in Columbia from Murfreesboro on December 18.

On December 19 the Confederate infantry and artillery crossed the Duck River at Columbia, destroying the bridges behind them. Forrest took charge of the rearguard, attaching an ad hoc infantry division under Brig. Gen. Edward C. Walthall to his Cavalry Corps.

Because of the misdirected pontoon train, Thomas was not able to cross the Duck River until December 23. Wilson continued his vigorous pursuit, but was stymied by Forrest over the next three days in hard-fought rearguard actions at Richland Creek, Anthony&#x27;s Hill, and Sugar Creek. Hood was able to get his army across the Tennessee River on a pontoon bridge near Bainbridge, Alabama by December 28. Thomas had asked Rear Admiral S. P. Lee, commanding the Tennessee River naval squadron, to destroy the Confederate bridge. However, low water and Confederate artillery prevented Union tinclad gunboats from interdicting the crossing.

Steedman&#x27;s Provisional Division was sent by rail from Nashville to Chattanooga and from there by river boat to Decatur, Alabama, to cut off Hood&#x27;s retreat. His force arrived too late to interfere with the crossing. However, Steedman&#x27;s cavalry under the command of Colonel William Jackson Palmer captured the Confederate pontoon train on December 30 along with a large number of supply wagons.

That marked the end of the Union pursuit.

==Aftermath==
===Casualties===
Federal casualties in the battle totaled 387 killed, 2,562 wounded, and 112 missing.

As only a few of the Confederate units submitted reports on the battle, Confederate casualties are difficult to determine. Thomas reported capturing 4,561 prisoners in the battle itself, with an unknown number captured during the retreat. One historian made an educated guess that 2,500 Confederates were killed and wounded at Nashville.
The Army of Tennessee had gone into Middle Tennessee campaign with approximately 38,000 men, exclusive of Forrest&#x27;s cavalry. The Army had sustained severe casualties at Spring Hill, Franklin, and Nashville, and suffered at least 2,000 desertions in the latter part of the campaign. On January 20 Hood reported an effective strength of 18,742, again exclusive of Forrest&#x27;s cavalry. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard, Hood&#x27;s nominal superior, advised the Confederate President on January 13 that the Army of Tennessee had fewer than 15,000 men.

===Reactions and effects===
The Battle of Nashville marked the effective end of the Army of Tennessee. Historian David Eicher remarked, &quot;If Hood mortally wounded his army at Franklin, he would kill it two weeks later at Nashville.&quot; Although Hood blamed the entire debacle on his subordinates and the soldiers themselves, his career was over. He retreated with his army to Tupelo, Mississippi, resigned his command on January 13, 1865, and was not given another field command.

==Battlefield preservation==
The Nashville battlefield is huge by Civil War standards, encompassing almost all of south and west Nashville. Nashvillians who live in the Green Hills, Forest Hills, Oak Hill, Lipscomb, or Brentwood neighborhoods are living on top of a battlefield.

In the earlier part of the twentieth century there was some talk of creating a National Battlefield Park in Nashville. This movement failed, due to lack of support from Nashville&#x27;s civic leaders, who as Southerners were not particularly interested in commemorating a battle that was such a profound Confederate defeat. As a result, much like Atlanta, most of the Nashville battlefield has been lost to development. However, the battle is memorialized and small parts of it have been preserved.

===Battlefield memorials===
A Battle of Nashville monument was created in 1927 by Giuseppe Moretti, who was commissioned by the Ladies Battlefield Association. Erected in the years immediately following World War I, the monument honors the soldiers of both sides and celebrated a united nation. The monument was severely damaged by a tornado in 1974, and during the 1980s interstate highway construction left the monument landlocked on a small plot of ground overlooking the massive highway interchange of I-65 and I-440. In 1999 the monument was relocated to the Nashville Battlefield Park at the intersection of Granny White Pike and Clifton Lane, just north of the Confederate line on the first day of the battle.

====Minnesota monuments====
In 1920 the State of Minnesota erected a large monument in the Nashville National Cemetery honoring its soldiers who were buried there. Minnesota lost more men at the Battle of Nashville than in any other Civil War battle.

====United States Colored Troops monument====
In 2006 a group of private citizens erected a monument in the Nashville National Cemetery honoring soldiers of the United States Colored Troops buried there, many of whom fought in the Battle of Nashville.

====Shy&#x27;s Hill memorials====
Erected by the Battle of Nashville Preservation Society, this honors the troops of both sides who fought on and around Shy&#x27;s Hill. The memorial consists of three flags, an American flag, a Confederate national flag, and a Minnesota state flag (honoring the four regiments of Minnesotans who were instrumental in capturing the hill).

A marker was placed on the slope of Shy&#x27;s Hill in late 2014 in honor of the contributions to the Minnesota regiments that fought in the battle. It was dedicated by members of the Minnesota Civil War Commemoration Task Force and the Battle of Nashville Preservation Society on November 16, 2014.
===Historic homes and buildings===
* Belle Meade Plantation: A skirmish was fought on the front lawn, scars on the columns on the front porch are believed to be bullet holes from the battle.
* Belmont Mansion: Served as Union General Thomas Woods&#x27;s headquarters. The Belmont Water Tower on the grounds of the mansion served as a signal station.
* Travellers Rest: Served as headquarters of the Army of Tennessee.
* Sunnyside: This antebellum home in the 12 South District of Nashville lay between the Union and Confederate lines. It was used as a hospital after the first day&#x27;s battle. It is the headquarters of the Metropolitan Historical Commission and has not been completely restored.
* Glen Leven: This Greek Revival home on Franklin Pike was built in 1857. It was used as a hospital by the Union during and after the battle. The home and the surrounding were donated by the Thompson family to the Land Trust for Tennessee in 2007. It is closed to the public except for special events.
* Downtown Presbyterian Church: Served as a hospital after the battle.
* Metropolitan Board of Parks and Recreation
* Fort Negley: This large masonry fortification was built in 1862–1863 by African-Americans forcibly impressed by the Union military government. Guns placed there fired the first shots in the battle. The fort is a ruin, but has been stabilized and interpreted.
* Nashville City Cemetery: Union dead from the battle (and some Confederate dead) were buried in an annex to this ante-bellum cemetery.
* Kelley&#x27;s Point: This is a short but attractive greenway that runs from a Lowe&#x27;s Super Center parking lot on Charlotte Pike at its intersection with Davidson Road to the site of a Confederate battery on the Cumberland River. The remains of earthworks are faintly visible.

===Privately owned but publicly accessible sites===
* Granbury&#x27;s Lunette. Owned by the Joseph E. Johnston Camp, Sons of Confederate Veterans. Located at 190 Polk Avenue. Played an important role in repelling the Union attack on the Confederate right on the first day of the battle. The lunette was partly destroyed by railroad construction in the early 1900s.
* Redoubt No. 1. Owned by the Battle of Nashville Preservation Society. Captured in the first day of the battle by troops from the IV Corps and XVI Corps. Located on Benham Avenue in Green Hills. This has been preserved and interpreted. Earthworks are clearly visible.
* Redoubt No. 4. The Battle of Nashville Preservation Society has an historic easement on the remnants of this fortification, consisting of the remnants of its northern face. It is located in the Abbottsford development off of Abbott–Martin Road in Green Hills. The remainder of the redoubt, which extended to Hobbs Road, was destroyed during home construction in the 1950s.
* Shy&#x27;s Hill. This is owned by the Battle of Nashville Preservation Society and is located just off of Battery Lane on Benton Smith Drive. Its fall on the second day of the battle precipitated the Confederate rout. It is well-interpreted. Earthworks on top of the hill were destroyed when a water tower (now removed) was erected in the early 1950s; Confederate trench lines on the east and south slopes are clearly visible.
* Mount Olivet Cemetery. Under the direction of the Ladies&#x27; Memorial Society of Nashville, Confederates killed or mortally wounded in the battle were removed from battlefield graves and City Cemetery in 1868 and reinterred at Confederate Circle at Mount Olivet. A large monument was erected on the site in 1889.

<doc id="490417" wikidata="Q777892" url="?curid=490417" title="Titlo">
<text>Titlo is an extended diacritic symbol initially used in early Cyrillic and Glagolitic manuscripts, e.g., in Old Church Slavonic and Old East Slavic languages. The word is a borrowing from the Greek , &quot;title&quot; and is a cognate of the words &quot;tittle&quot; and &quot;tilde&quot;. The titlo still appears in inscriptions on modern icons and in service books printed in Church Slavonic.

The titlo is drawn as a line over a text. In some styles of writing the line is drawn with serifs, so that it may appear as a zigzag. The usual form in this case is short stroke up, falling slanted line, short stroke up; an alternative resembles a volta bracket: short stroke up, horizontal line, short stroke down.

The titlo has several meanings depending on the context:

A titlo is used as a scribal abbreviation mark for frequently written long words and also for nouns describing sacred persons. In place of , for example, &#x27;God&#x27; was written under the titlo and &#x27;[he] speaks&#x27; is abbreviated as . Fig. 3 shows a list of the most common of these abbreviations in current use in printed Church Slavonic. Fig. 2 shows &#x27;Lord&#x27; abbreviated to its first letter and stem ending (also a single letter here, in the nominative case). Around the 15th century, titla in most schools came to be restricted to a special semiotic meaning, used exclusively to refer to sacred concepts, while the same words were otherwise spelled out without titla, and so, for example, while &quot;God&quot; in the sense of the one true God is abbreviated as above, &quot;god&quot; referring to &quot;false&quot; gods is spelled out; likewise, while the word for &quot;angel&quot; is generally abbreviated, &quot;angels&quot; is spelled out in &quot;performed by evil angels&quot; in Psalm 77. This corresponds to the Nomina sacra (Latin: &quot;Sacred names&quot;) tradition of using contractions for certain frequently occurring names in Greek Scriptures.

A short titlo is placed over a single letter or over an entire abbreviation; a long titlo is placed over a whole word.

A further meaning was in its use in manuscripts, where the titlo was often used to mark the place where a scribe accidentally skipped the letter, if there was no space to draw the missed letter above.

Titlos are also used to mark letters when they are used as Cyrillic numerals, a quasi-decimal system analogous to Greek numerals.

Titlo is encoded in Unicode as , and .

<doc id="490420" wikidata="Q34063" url="?curid=490420" title="José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia">
<text>José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia y Velasco () (6 January 1766 – 20 September 1840) was a Paraguayan lawyer and politician, and the first dictator (1814–1840) of Paraguay following its 1811 independence from the Spanish Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. His official title was &quot;Supreme and Perpetual Dictator of Paraguay&quot;, but he was popularly known as &quot;El Supremo&quot;.

He is considered to be the chief ideologue and political leader of the faction that advocated for the full independence of Paraguay from the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata and from the Empire of Brazil.

== Early life and education ==
Francia was born in Yaguarón, in modern-day Paraguarí Department. Francia&#x27;s father was an officer turned tobacco planter from São Paulo, and his mother was a Paraguayan descended from Spanish colonists. He was christened Joseph Gaspar de Franza y Velasco but later used the more popular name &quot;Rodríguez&quot;, and changed &quot;Franza&quot; to the more Spanish &quot;Francia&quot;. Although his father was simply García Rodríguez Francia (Portuguese: &quot;Garcia Rodrigues França&quot;), the dictator inserted the article &quot;de&quot; to style himself &quot;Rodríguez de Francia y Velasco&quot;. He was of Portuguese descent.

He studied at the monastery school of San Francisco, Asunción, originally in training for the Catholic priesthood, but never became a priest. On 13 April 1785, after four years studying, he became a doctor of theology and master of philosophy at the College of Monserrat at the National University of Córdoba in what would soon become Argentina.

Although he was dogged by suggestions that his father, a Brazilian tobacco exporter, was a mulatto, Francia was awarded a coveted chair of theology at the Seminary of San Carlos in Asunción in 1790. His radical views made his position as a teacher there untenable, and he soon gave up theology to study law. Eventually, he became a lawyer and learned five languages: Guarani, Spanish, French, Latin, and some English.

During his studies, he was influenced by the ideas of Enlightenment and then the French Revolution. Francia was disgusted by Paraguay&#x27;s &quot;casta system&quot;, which was imposed by Spain, and as a lawyer, he would defend the less fortunate against the affluent. A devotee of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, a keen reader of Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and the French Encyclopedists, Francia had the largest library in Asunción. His interest in astronomy, combined with his knowledge of French and other subjects considered arcane in Asunción, caused some superstitious Paraguayans to regard him as a wizard who could predict the future.

== Political career ==

He demonstrated an early interest in politics. He became a provincial &quot;cabildo&quot; member in 1807, fiscal officer in 1808 and attained with difficulty the position of &quot;alcalde del primer voto&quot;, or head of the Asunción &quot;cabildo&quot;, by August 1809, the highest position he could aspire to as a &quot;criollo&quot; (a native-born White). He had tried in 1798 but failed because of his humble background. Other significant members included Fulgencio Yegros; Pedro Juan Caballero; Manuel Atanasio Cabañas; and the last colonial governor, Bernardo de Velasco.

After the May Revolution in Buenos Aires, Governor Velasco convened the Congress of the province on 24 July 1810. Francia shocked the other members by saying it was irrelevant which king they had. When Paraguay&#x27;s independence was declared on 15 May 1811, he was appointed secretary to the three-man ruling &quot;junta&quot; and included in the five-man governing junta by Congress meeting on 17 June 1811. On 1 August, he resigned because of the army&#x27;s dominance over Congress. He retired to the countryside, where he spread rumours that the country was going to be betrayed by the incompetent government. He was one of the few men in the country with any significant education and soon became the country&#x27;s real leader. Only one other Paraguayan had a doctorate: Juan Bogarin, one of the five &quot;junta&quot; members.

From his retirement in his modest &quot;chacra&quot; (farm or country estate) at Ibaray near Asunción, he told countless ordinary citizens who came to visit him that their revolution had been betrayed, the change in government had only traded a Spanish-born elite for a &quot;criollo&quot; one, and the government was incompetent and mismanaged. He returned to the &quot;junta&quot; in October if Bogarin was removed and resigned again on 15 December. He did not return again until 16 November 1812 and then only if he was in charge of foreign policy and half of the army.

Paraguayans often referred to him simply as &quot;Dr. Francia&quot; or &quot;Karai Guasu&quot; (&quot;great lord&quot; in Guarani). A few Indians believed that he had supernatural powers: when some saw him measuring the stars with his theodolite, they thought he was talking to night demons. Francia would later use it to straighten the streets of Asunción.

On 1 October 1813, Congress named Francia and Fulgencio Yegros as alternate consuls for a year. Francia was given an initial term of four months. Francia&#x27;s initial term was followed by a four-month term for Yegros, which was then followed by a second four-month term for Francia. Each consul controlled half of the army. On 12 October 1813 Paraguay declared independence from the Spanish Empire.

In March 1814, Francia imposed a law that no Spaniard may intermarry with another Spaniard, and that they may only wed mestizos, Amerindians, or Africans. This was done to eliminate any socioeconomic disparities along racial lines, and also to end the predominantly criollo and peninsulare influence in Paraguay. De Francia himself was not a mestizo, but feared that racial disparities would create tensions that could threaten his absolute rule.

===Dictator===
On 1 October 1814, Congress named him as sole consul, with absolute powers for three years. He consolidated his power to such an extent that on 1 June 1816, another Congress voted him absolute control over the country for life. For the next 24 years, he ran the country with the aid of only three other people. According to the historian Richard Alan White, the congresses were actually very progressive for the era; all men over 23 could vote for them. From 1817, he appointed &quot;cabildo&quot; members, but in 1825, he decided to end the &quot;cabildo&quot;.

== Policies ==
One Latin American scholar, Antonio de la Cova, summarised Francia&#x27;s rule as follows:
&quot;... we find a strange mixture of capacity and caprice, of far-sighted wisdom and reckless infatuation, strenuous endeavours after a high ideal and flagrant violations of the simplest principles of justice. He cut off Paraguay from the rest of the world by stopping foreign commerce, but carefully fostered its internal industries and agriculture under his personal supervision. Dr. Francia disposed to be hospitable to strangers from other lands, and kept them prisoners for years; lived a life of republican simplicity, and severely punished the slightest want of respect. As time went on he appears to have grown more arbitrary and despotic. Deeply imbued with the principles of the French Revolution, he was a stern antagonist of the church. He abolished the Inquisition, suppressed the college of theology, did away with the tithes, and inflicted endless indignities on the priests. He kept the aristocracy in subjection and discouraged marriage both by precept and example, leaving behind him several illegitimate children. For the extravagances of his later years the plea of insanity has been put forward.&quot;
Francia aimed to found a society on the principles of Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Social Contract&quot; and was also inspired by Robespierre and Napoleon. To create such a utopia, he imposed a ruthless isolation upon Paraguay, interdicting all external trade, and he fostered national industries.

Francia in some ways resembles the &quot;caudillos&quot; of the post-colonial era, but he deviated from the elitist tendencies of most of his contemporaries. Instead, he attempted to reorganize Paraguay in accordance with the wishes of the lower classes and other marginalized groups. He greatly limited the power of the Church and the landed elites in favor of giving peasants a way to make a living on state-run &quot;estancias&quot;. He is criticized by some scholars for being entirely against the Church, he wanted only to diminish the institution&#x27;s all-encompassing political control. He actually built new churches and supported religious festivals using state funds. Francia&#x27;s government also took over services usually under church supervision, such as orphanages, hospitals, and homeless shelters, to manage them more efficiently. Francia and his policies were in fact very well received by the majority of Paraguayans, excluding the small ruling classes, and his neutrality in foreign affairs kept peace in a period of turmoil.

Francia&#x27;s authoritarian regime built the foundations of a strong and dirigiste state in order to undertake the economic modernization of the country. Paraguay thus instituted rigorous protectionism at a time when most other countries were adopting the free-trade system promoted by the United Kingdom while entrusting their national bourgeoisie with the task of piloting wealth creation. This model, continued after Francia&#x27;s death by his successors Carlos Antonio López and Francisco Solano López, made Paraguay one of the most modern and socially advanced countries in Latin America: the redistribution of wealth was so great that many foreign travelers reported that the country had no begging, hunger or conflict. The agrarian reform has allowed for a fairly equitable distribution of land. Asunción was one of the first capitals on the continent to inaugurate a railroad network. The country had a growing industry and a merchant fleet made up of ships built in national shipyards, had a trade surplus and was debt-free.

== 1820 uprising and police state ==

In February 1820, Francia&#x27;s political police called the &quot;Pyraguës&quot; (&quot;hairy feet&quot;) uncovered and quickly crushed a plot by the elites and many leading independence figures to assassinate him. Juan Bogarin, the only conspirator who was still free, confessed the plot to his priest and then Francia. Almost 200 prominent Paraguayans were arrested by Francia, who executed most of them. On 9 June 1821, a letter detailing an anti-Francia conspiracy was found by two slaves and Francia&#x27;s priest, who had knowledge of the plot from the confessions of a conspirator. Francia had all 200 Spaniards arrested and made them stand in the plaza while he read the letter out. They were released 18 months later only when they had paid 150,000 &quot;pesos&quot; (by comparison, the 1820 budget was 164,723 &quot;pesos&quot;). The arch-conspirators, Fulgencio Yegros and Pedro Caballero, were arrested and imprisoned for life. Caballero committed suicide on 13 July 1821, and Yegros was executed four days later.

Francia outlawed all opposition and established a secret police force. His underground prison was known as the &quot;chamber of truth&quot;, and most of Paraguay&#x27;s manufactures were made with prison labor. He abolished flogging, but his implementation of the death penalty was brutal, as he insisted all executions be carried out at a &quot;banquillo&quot; (&quot;stool&quot;) under an orange tree outside his window. To avoid wasting bullets, most victims were bayoneted, and their families were not allowed to collect the corpses until they had been lying there all day to make sure that they were dead.

Many prisoners were also banished to Tevego, a prison camp away from any other settlements, surrounded by a large swamp on the east, and by the Gran Chaco desert on the west. Upon his death, there were 606 prisoners in Paraguay&#x27;s jails, who were mainly foreigners.

In 1821, Francia ordered the arrest and imprisonment of the famous French botanist and explorer Aimé Bonpland, who was running a private farm harvesting Yerba mate on the banks of the Paraná, which was seen to be a threat to the Paraguayan economy. Francia later granted Bonpland clemency because of his value as a physician and allowed him to live in a house if he acted as a doctor to the local garrison.

=== Military ===
Francia believed the states of Latin America should form a confederation based on equality of nations and joint defence.
He created a small but well-equipped army, which was equipped largely with the confiscated Jesuit arsenal. The size of the army varied compared to the magnitude of the threat. In 1824, for example, the army had over 5,500 troops, but in 1834, it had only 649. Francia deliberately misled foreigners into thinking that the army was over 5,000 strong, but it rarely exceeded 2,000. He maintained a large militia of 15,000 reservists. The first Paraguayan-built warship was launched in 1815, and by the mid-1820s, a navy of 100 canoes, sloops and flatboats had been built. People had to remove their hats when meeting any soldier, and Indians who could not afford headgear wore nothing but a hat brim so that they could obey this rule. Cash could be exported only in exchange for arms and ammunition, and in 1832, 2000 muskets and sabres were imported from Brazil.

No wars were fought, but there were disputes over Candelaria with Argentina. Francia initially abandoned it in 1815, but in 1821, he built a fort on the border, another the next year, and a third in 1832. In 1838, the army again occupied Candelaria on the grounds that Francia was protecting the native Guaraní people who lived there.

Paraguayan soldiers saw action only on the outposts of the frontier, which frequently came under attack from the Guaycurú. In 1823, Francia allowed Brazilian merchants to trade in Candelaria. Francia would spend most of the state&#x27;s budget on the army, but soldiers were also used for labour on public projects.

=== Education ===
Francia abolished higher education on the grounds that it was the nation&#x27;s financial priority to fund the army and that private study could be freely conducted in his library. Francia closed the country&#x27;s only religious seminary in 1822, mainly because of the bishop&#x27;s mental illness but also because of his purge of the power of the Church. Nevertheless, he made state education compulsory for all males in 1828, but he neither helped nor hindered private schools. However, illiteracy decreased, and the pupil-teacher ratio grew, with one teacher to 36 pupils by 1825, according to Richard Alan White. In 1836, Francia opened Paraguay&#x27;s first public library, which was stocked with books confiscated from his opponents. Books were one of the few duty-free items, munitions being another.

=== Agriculture ===
In October 1820, a plague of locusts destroyed most of the crops. Francia ordered a second harvest planted. It proved abundant and so from then on, Paraguay&#x27;s farmers planted two crops a year. Throughout the decade, Francia nationalised half the land in four stages. He started by confiscating the lands of traitors and continued with clerics (1823), squatters (1825) and finally unused land (1828). The land was run directly by soldiers to make their own supplies, or it was leased to the peasants. By 1825, Paraguay was self-sufficient in sugarcane, and wheat was introduced. At the end of his life, Francia ruthlessly confined all cattle at Ytapua to stop a plague spreading from Argentina until it died out.

=== Refugees ===
Contrary to popular belief, Paraguay was not completely isolated. Francia welcomed political refugees from various countries. José Artigas, the hero of Uruguay&#x27;s independence, was given asylum in 1820, along with 200 of his men. Artigas stayed in Paraguay even after Francia&#x27;s death on a pension of $30 a month and was pursued by Francisco Ramírez, who saw one of his warships also desert to Paraguay. In 1820, Francia ordered for runaway slaves to be given refuge and for refugees from Corrientes to be given canoes and land. In 1839, a whole company of Brazilian deserters was welcomed. Many ex-slaves were also sent to guard the penal colony of Tevego.

=== Relationship with the Catholic Church ===
Francia inherited the &quot;Patronato Regio&quot; (Regal Patronage) of the Spanish Empire, that was originally given to the colonial viceroys and governors. He used this Regal Patronage in a severe way, controlling every aspect of the Catholic Church in Paraguay; however, there is no evidence nor tangible proof that Francia provoked a schism with the Pope. At most, Paraguay&#x27;s isolation, forced both by external pressures and by Francia himself, made it very difficult for the Vatican to establish communications with priests of the country.

Taking the prerrogatives of the &quot;Real Patronato&quot; to an extreme, in mid-June 1816, Francia ordered all nighttime processions to be banned except that of &quot;Corpus Christi&quot;. In 1819, the bishop was persuaded to transfer authority to the vicar-general, and in 1820, friars were secularised. On 4 August 1820, all clergy were forced to swear allegiance to the state, and their clerical immunities were withdrawn. The four monasteries in the country were nationalised in 1824, with one later demolished and another becoming a parish church. The remaining two became an artillery park and barracks, and three convents also became barracks.

== Personal life ==

Francia took several precautions against assassination. He would lock the palace doors himself, unroll the cigars that his sister made to ensure there was no poison, prepare his own yerba mate, and sleep with a pistol under his pillow. Even so, a maid tried to poison him with a piece of cake. No one could come within six paces of him or even bear a cane near him. Whenever he would go out riding, he had all bushes and trees along the route uprooted so that assassins could not hide, all shutters had to be closed, and pedestrians had to prostrate before him as he passed.

Francia lived a spartan lifestyle, and apart from some books and furniture, his only possessions were a tobacco case and a pewter confectionery box. Francia left the state treasury with at least twice as much money in it as when he took office, including 36,500 &quot;pesos&quot; of his unspent salary, the equivalent of several years&#x27; pay.

The final chapter of Rengger &amp; Longchamps&#x27; work published in English in 1827 describes details of his personal life. This work seems to have had great impact in the English-speaking world, for many of its claims and descriptions have been accepted and used in other works. Thus, White&#x27;s fictional account of Francia relies heavily on snippets of the work (e.g., one sentence in a footnote dealing with a tailor and cloth becomes an almost tragi-comic scene in &quot;El Supremo&quot;). The work is cited by historians to this day, as one of the few personal accounts, even if biased against him.

== Legacy ==
His reputation abroad was negative: Charles Darwin, for one, hoped he would be overthrown, though Thomas Carlyle (himself no friend to democracy) found material to admire even in the publications of Francia&#x27;s detractors. Carlyle wrote in an 1843 essay that &quot;Liberty of private judgement, unless it kept its mouth shut, was at an end in Paraguay&quot;, but considered that under the social circumstances this was of little detriment to a &quot;Gaucho population ... not yet fit for constitutional liberty.&quot;

Francia imbued Paraguay with a tradition of autocratic rule that lasted, with only a few breaks, until 1989. He is still considered a national hero, with a museum dedicated to his memory in Yaguarón. It contains portraits of him and his daughter as well as his sweets box, candlestick and tobacco case. Paraguayan author Augusto Roa Bastos wrote an ambivalent depiction of the life of Francia, a novel entitled &quot;Yo el Supremo&quot; (&quot;I, the Supreme&quot;).

The American author Edward Lucas White published a historical work of fiction regarding Francia and Paraguay of the mid-1810s in 1916. The author reworks some history in a playful fashion. For example, he has an almost comedic section (Chapter XX, &quot;Gold Combs in Church&quot;) where the protagonist helps two friends whose family members were humiliated at the big Cathedral Sunday Mass by being removed for wearing corsets and gold combs in their hair. In the next chapter, &quot;Service By Edict&quot;, Francia forces the Catholic clerics he assembles to hold a third Sunday Mass before noon and give public prominence to the two women, who are allowed their corsets but not their gold hair combs: 

* &quot;El Supremo: A Romance of the Great Dictator of Paraguay&quot; (E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., 1916)
== Popular Culture ==

The character of &quot;El Supremo&quot; in the novel The Happy Return was loosely based on José Rodríguez de Francia.
&quot;The Happy Return&quot; was the first installment of the popular Horatio Hornblower book series by C. S. Forester 

Actor Alec Mango portrayed &quot;El Supremo&quot; in the 1951 film version of Forester&#x27;s novel.

<text>is a series of role-playing video games developed and published by Konami. Created by Yoshitaka Murayama, the games are loosely based on the classical Chinese novel &quot;Water Margin&quot;, whose title is rendered as in Japanese. Each individual game centers on themes of politics, corruption, revolution, mystical crystals known as &quot;True Runes&quot;, and the &quot;108 Stars of Destiny&quot;—the 108 protagonists who are loosely interpreted from the source material.

Although the events of the games are not chronological, the entire series (except for &quot;Tierkreis&quot; and &quot;Tsumugareshi Hyakunen no Toki&quot;) takes place within the same world, among continuing and overlapping histories. In some cases, several characters appear in multiple installments.

A spiritual successor to the series titled &quot;Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes&quot; was released on 23 April 2024. A high-definition remaster of the first two games&#x27; port on the PlayStation Portable under the title &quot;Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars&quot; is set for release on 6 March 2025.

=== Gameplay ===
In the Suikoden series, the player takes control of a battle party having a maximum of six people (consisting of the protagonist and 5 other characters), &quot;Suikoden IV&quot;, however, reduces the party to four fighters and one support. The goal of the game is for the protagonist to defeat the opponents who are trying to oppose his/her team. This becomes possible as every game in the series revolves around the recruitment of the &quot;108 Stars of Destiny&quot;; wherein the fighter characters recruited from the bunch can be used as members for the battle party; every game in the series has their respective &quot;Stars of Destiny&quot;. The series practically makes use of running around towns on different islands and into dungeons filled with monsters or enemies. A base or headquarters will also be obtained by the player which is usually abandoned, monster-infested castles which turns into bustling communities when captured.

==== Battle modes ====
The most typical form of battle in the series is the turn-based battle wherein the 6-man team faces the opponents. However, it is not the sole form of battle featured in the games. There are 3 different types of battle present which and have been accustomed to every game. They are: &#x27;Basic Battle&#x27;, &#x27;One-on-one Duel&#x27; and &#x27;Strategic War Battle&#x27;.

# Basic Battle: It is the most common form of battle. It is when the protagonist&#x27;s 6-man team will have to battle out. This mode allows the player to control the 6 party members with different commands such as the &#x27;Fight&#x27; where the player designates the action he/she wants the characters to perform, &#x27;Run&#x27; to escape, &#x27;Bribe&#x27; to use the party&#x27;s money called &quot;Potch&quot; to bribe the enemy for escape and the &#x27;Auto&#x27; command in which the game automatically designates the &#x27;Attack&#x27; command for every character.
# One-on-one Duel: A battle where only a single character fights and happens only in special events. It is a turn-based duel in which the player chooses command to attack (instead of manually controlled fighting). Duels in the series is typically not time-based except &quot;Suikoden V&quot; wherein choosing a command is timed for 3 seconds. Duels are usually accompanied by dialogue exchange between the player and the enemy, with the dialogue giving clues to what command the enemy will choose next (Essentially rock, paper scissors with the enemy commentary telling the player which they chose).
# Strategic War Battle: A turn-based strategic battle between the protagonist&#x27;s side and the enemy. In more accurate terms, this is a battle between armies of the protagonist and the enemy. The protagonist&#x27;s army is made up of many units which could be organized by the player however he/she desires. Every game in the series has different forms of war battles most notably in &quot;Suikoden IV&quot;, where the battles are done in the sea. &quot;Suikoden V&quot; however, is the first game to make use of real-time strategy.

== Development ==
The &quot;Suikoden&quot; series was created, written, produced, and overseen by Yoshitaka Murayama, who left Konami near the end of &quot;Suikoden III&quot;&#x27;s development. Noritada Matsukawa took over as Senior Director of &quot;Suikoden III&quot; following Murayama&#x27;s departure. &quot;Suikoden IV&quot; was directed by Matsukawa as well but was produced by Junko Kawano, who was the chief designer in &quot;Suikoden I&quot;. &quot;Suikoden V&quot; was directed by Takahiro Sakiyama, a relative newcomer to RPGs.

=== Future ===
In an interview conducted by Japanese website 4gamers.net regarding the RPG Frontier Gate, Konami developers revealed that the &quot;Suikoden&quot; development team has been disbanded with members scattered about teams within Konami and elsewhere. This led to speculation that the franchise had indeed been abandoned following disappointing sales of the latest entries in the series.

Despite these rumours, Konami presented a trailer for a new Suikoden game on Tokyo Game Show 2011: Genso Suikoden: The Woven Web of a Century (&quot;Genso Suikoden Tsumugareshi Hyakunen no Toki&quot;). It came out in Japan for PSP on February 12, 2012 to generally lackluster reviews.

According to an article published by &quot;The Nikkei&quot; in 2015, development on the series has been halted.

In 2020, one of &quot;Suikoden&quot;&#x27;s development crew left Konami and named a new studio called Rabbit &amp; Bear, founded by some of the key creative minds behind the classic PlayStation-era roleplaying series, including Yoshitaka Murayama, director and writer on the first two &quot;Suikoden&quot; games, and the creative team also includes Junko Kawano, the lead artist on &quot;Suikoden 1&quot; and &quot;4&quot;; Junichi Murakami, art director on &quot;Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow&quot;; &quot;Suikoden Tactics&quot; director Osamu Komuta; and composers Motoi Sakuraba and Michiko Naruke. Murayama directed a Suikoden spiritual successor titled &quot;Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes&quot;, released in 2024; Murayama died during development.

== World, setting, and concepts ==
Essentially, each game follows the plot formula of a coup d&#x27;état by corrupt power holder(s) and the protagonist is an exile from his/her home. The plot also follows the disastrous misuse of the &quot;True Runes&quot; while the hero struggles, despite overwhelming odds, to bring peace to the land alongside his/her friends, and the climactic showdown with the corrupted True Rune incarnation.

=== The 27 True Runes ===
The &quot;27 True Runes&quot; are powerful sources of all magic and primal forces in the world of Suikoden. Wholly sentient and possessing their own will, the True Runes hold immeasurable power, and are the equivalents of gods in the Suikoden world. Many wars have been fought over them in the past, some instigated by the will of the runes themselves. True Runes are often sought by the powerful and influential due to their shared property of granting immortality to those who will bear them. All bearers of True Runes stop aging and become immune to disease and all other natural causes of death, though they can still die from physical trauma such as accidents or murder.

The True Runes often attach themselves to living beings. Doing so gives the True Rune holder great power over the aspect of nature the Rune governs, as well as immortality so long as they bear the Rune. Bearing a True Rune can also have negative consequences, as in the case of the bearer of the Moon Rune being transformed into a vampire. A True Rune can also take the shape of a physical object, as is the case with the Star Dragon Sword being a manifestation of the Night Rune. They can also incarnate themselves unattached from a host, as the Beast Rune did during the Highland-Jowston conflict, self-activating and then feeding of its own will.

Origin of True Runes and the Creation of the Suikoden universe

The story of the creation of the &quot;Suikoden&quot; universe can be found in books discovered in most games. The story from &quot;Old Book Vol.1&quot; from &quot;Suikoden I&quot; reads:
Identified True Runes
* &quot;Gate Rune&quot;
* &quot;Rune of Life and Death&quot; (also known as the &quot;Soul Eater&quot;)
* &quot;Rune of the Beginning &quot;
* &quot;Rune of Punishment &quot;
* &quot;True Elemental Runes (Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, and Lightning)&quot;
* &quot;Sun Rune&quot;
* &quot;Sovereign Rune&quot;
* &quot;Hachifusa (Eight-Fold) Rune&quot;
* &quot;Circle Rune &quot;
* &quot;Rune of Change&quot;
* &quot;Moon Rune &quot;
* &quot;Night Rune &quot;
* &quot;Beast Rune&quot;
* &quot;Dragon Rune&quot;

=== The 108 Stars of Destiny ===

A concept borrowed from the Chinese novel &quot;Shui Hu Zhuan&quot;, each &quot;Suikoden&quot; game has featured 108 characters who band together to ward off a threat. In each main &quot;Suikoden game&quot; (excluding the &quot;Suikogaiden&quot; games and &quot;Suikoden Tactics&quot;), there are 108 notable characters, all of which are recruitable except for in Suikoden III, where several of the stars of destiny were the antagonist characters. While recruiting all of the Stars of Destiny is not a requirement to finishing the game, recruiting all of them gives certain bonuses that affect the story of the game.

=== Geography ===
The &quot;Suikoden&quot; series is set in a world with many countries. The political geography has changed over the series chronology; while the most recent game in the setting is &quot;Suikoden V&quot;, chronologically, &quot;Suikoden IV&quot; is the earliest game while &quot;Suikoden III&quot; occurs latest within the time span of the series.

&quot;Suikoden&quot;, &quot;Suikoden II&quot; and &quot;Suikoden III&quot; are set on the Northern Continent, a land mass composed of several regions. &quot;Suikoden&quot; takes place in the Scarlet Moon Empire, which is located on southeastern coast of the Northern Continent, and is composed primarily of the Toran region, with Lake Toran at its centre. Notable locations in this area include Gregminister, the empire&#x27;s capital situated in Arlus, the Warrior&#x27;s Village in the Lorimar region, and the Great Forest. At the end of &quot;Suikoden&quot;, the empire is replaced by the Toran Republic.

&quot;Suikoden II&quot; is set in the Dunan region, north-west of the Toran Republic, and initially comprises the Highland Kingdom in the east and the Jowston City-States, a confederation of politically autonomous states, in the west. Significant locations in Jowston include the cities-states of South Window, Greenhill, Muse, and Two River, and the Knightdom of Matilda. Following the Dunan Unification War, the Highland Kingdom falls and it, along with the Jowston City-States unite to form the Dunan Republic. The Tinto region lying in the west, separated from Dunan by mountains, chooses to remain politically independent and becomes the Tinto Republic.

Sharing Dunan&#x27;s western border and north of Tinto are the Grasslands, which stretch from the centre of the Northern Continent to a small portion of the continent&#x27;s west coast. The area is composed of the six clans: the Lizard, Duck, Karaya, Chisha, Safir, and the Alma Kinan. Directly west of the Grasslands and bordered in the east by Tinto is the Zexen Confederacy, located on the west coast of the Northern Continent and historically an offshoot of the Grasslands. Important locations include the Zexen capital Vinay del Zexay and Budehuc Castle, which lies close to the Grasslands border in northwest Zexen. The primary conflict of &quot;Suikoden III&quot; occurs in these areas. The northwestern portion of the continent, due north of the Grasslands and Zexen, is the Knightdom of Camaro and the surrounding Nameless Lands.

The largest country in the north is the Holy Kingdom of Harmonia, located in the northeastern portion of the continent. Since its establishment, it has assimilated various neighbouring countries, such as Sanadia, as well as a portion of the Grasslands – the Kanaa clan of the Grasslands became Le Buque under Harmonian rule after the First Fire Bringer War. Notably, the Scarlet Moon Empire originally formed after obtaining political autonomy from Harmonia and taking Harmonia&#x27;s old capital as its own, renaming it Gregminister, resulting in Harmonia establishing a new capital at the Crystal Valley. Harmonia is also home to the Tower, a location reserved for training and housing members of the Howling Voice Guild.

Other major areas on the Northern Continent include the Kooluk region and Kanakan. The Kooluk region was originally the Kooluk Empire during the course of &quot;Suikoden IV&quot; and eventually dissolved in &quot;Suikoden Tactics&quot; to be left as a group of independent settlements. It takes up most of the southern edge of the Northern continent and directly borders the Toran Republic in the east and the Dunan Republic in the north. Off the eastern coast of Toran is the island of Kanakan.

Lying directly south of the Northern Continent is the ocean and several islands, including Obel, Middleport, and Razril. At the end of &quot;Suikoden IV&quot;, most of these islands are unified to become the Island Nations Federation. The largest island in the area, the Dukedom of Gaien, remains independent. West of Gaien is the island nation of the Kingdom of Zelant.

Due south of the Island Nations is the Southern Continent, a landmass composed primarily of three countries: the Queendom of Falena, and its neighbours, the theocracy of Nagarea in the southwest and the New Armes Kingdom in the southeast. As the setting for &quot;Suikoden V&quot;, Falena has a large network of rivers and lakes throughout the country and the Ashtwal Mountains in its northern region. Key locations include the cities of Stormfist and Doraat in the west; Rainwall, Estrise, and Sable, located on the Armes border, in the east; Lelcar, Lordlake, and Sauronix in the south; and the Falenan capital, Sol-Falena, and the holy land of Lunas, governed by the Oracle, in the north. Falena has been protected from the militant theocracy Nagarea since the mountain pass between the nations was destroyed, though Armes continues to remain a threat throughout &quot;Suikoden V&quot;.

Northeast of Falena also appears portion of a landmass of considerable size. West of the Northern and Southern Continents and the Island Nations is a landmass referred to as the Western Continent, of which few details are known. Scattered across the world are mysterious ruins attributed to the lost Sindar race, which is a recurring theme throughout the Suikoden series.

<text>Fogo Island (&quot;Fogo&quot;, Portuguese for &quot;Fire&quot;) is the largest of the offshore islands of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It lies off the northeast coast of Newfoundland, northwest of Musgrave Harbour across Hamilton Sound, just east of the Change Islands. The island is about long and wide. The total area is . It is home to the Town of Fogo Island, which encompasses Fogo, Joe Batt&#x27;s Arm-Barr&#x27;d Islands-Shoal Bay, Seldom-Little Seldom, Tilting, and previously unincorporated areas of Fogo Island.

Though migratory French fishermen visited Fogo Island from the early 16th century until 1718, the first permanent settlement of the island took place in the 18th century. Fogo Harbour and Tilting Harbour were the first settlements on the island. The English and Irish descendants of the first inhabitants retained traces of their Elizabethan English and Old Irish dialects, which can be heard on the island today. The island has many ancient folk customs brought from England and Ireland, but they are disappearing.

==History==
Fogo Island is one of the oldest named features on the coast of Newfoundland. The Bertius map from 1606 shows Fogo Island as one of only about a dozen important features around the coast of Newfoundland. On French maps of the 16th to 18th centuries, the island is referred to as &quot;Ile des Fougues&quot;. The island was likely named by Portuguese explorers and early fishing crews in the 16th century (&quot;Fogo&quot; means &quot;Fire&quot; in Portuguese).

Until 1783, Fogo Island was on an area of the coast called the French Shore. Though English and Irish were not supposed to settle here, under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, they did settle; by 1750, Fogo was a thriving part of the British mercantile system of fisheries, based out of West Country English towns such as Poole, in Dorset.

Tilting Harbour on Fogo Island is a National Cultural Landscape District of Canada and is Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s first Provincial Heritage District. Tilting is unique for its Irish culture and, some people say, its Irish dialect. The Irish Cemetery in Tilting may be the oldest in North America.

Local oral history indicates that Tilting was originally a French harbour before becoming a venue of Irish settlement. This is highly likely, given the traditional commercial and cultural links between southern Irish and northern French fishing ports. The first Irish settled in Tilting in the 1750s, and uniquely for Newfoundland, Tilting evolved into an exclusively Irish and Catholic town by the 1780s.

Beothuk traversed Fogo Island for many hundreds of years before Irish and English settlers arrived. The Beothuk pursued the seal and salmon fisheries in the area. They also travelled out to the Funk Islands to collect feathers and eggs from the birds there. In the early years of European settlement at Fogo, there were incidents of violence between the Beothuk and the Europeans. This contact ended around the year 1800. The Beothuk became extinct as a people in the late 1820s.

Fogo Island first attracted Europeans because of the extensive opportunities for commodity harvesting, including seal skins and oil, lumber, fur-bearing animals, salmon and of course cod. Over time, settlers on the island concentrated on processing dried cod, mainly because that was the product that most interested the merchants who dealt in the region of Fogo. From about 1850 until the widespread depletion of fish stocks in the 1990s, cod was king. In recent years, the economy of the island has seen diversification away from solely fishing to tourism and cultural industries.

Fishing has always been a hard life. Before Confederation with Canada, the mercantile classes of St John&#x27;s, Newfoundland became rich by holding a near-monopoly stranglehold on both the supply of goods to the Newfoundland outports and on the sale of fish from them.

In the early 20th century, the Fisherman&#x27;s Protective Union was formed in an attempt to break this stranglehold. It was a form of co-operative with general stores owned by fishermen for fishermen. One of the Fishermen&#x27;s Union stores still stands at Seldom-Come-By on Fogo Island, now open as a museum complete with general store, port installations, fishing implements and equipment for the manufacture of cod-liver oil.

Today, the Fogo Island Cooperative continues to successfully stake footholds in new fish markets. Communities began recognising the appeal of their land and heritage as cultural tourism opportunities.

Crab and lobster fisheries have largely replaced the cod fishery; a fish-packing plant remains in operation in the town of Fogo.

A Marconi radio transmitting station was once operational atop a hill near the town of Fogo; operating with a spark-gap transmitter to establish maritime communications, the station was forced to close around the time that radio became common for household use as the spark-gap design generated unacceptable levels of radio interference. Efforts to rebuild this station as a historic site commenced in 2002.

In 1967, the island played a key role in the development of what came to be known as the &quot;Fogo Process,&quot; a model for community media as a tool for addressing community concerns, when an Extension field worker from Memorial University, Fred Earle, and Colin Low shot 27 films with Fogo Islanders as part of the National Film Board of Canada&#x27;s Challenge for Change program.

Residents defeated the Smallwood government&#x27;s plans to resettle elsewhere Fogo Islanders in the 1950s but by 1967 a downturn in the inshore fishery had forced many to turn to welfare support. The northern cod fishery closed in 1992. While the island did recover from the downturn (in part owing to the Fogo Process), the depleted state of the fishery adversely affected islanders.

From 1792 there was always a physician on the island. The last physician was due to leave the island in June 2022; medical care then only being available via a six-hour round trip by ferry, weather permitting. This follows economic problems and population decrease in Newfoundland and Labrador following the 1990s collapse in the cod fishery.

==Communities==
*Town of Fogo Island:
**Fogo
**Joe Batt&#x27;s Arm
**Seldom
**Little Seldom
**Tilting
**Stag Harbour
**Island Harbour
**Deep Bay
**Fogo Island Central
**Shoal Bay
**Barr&#x27;d Islands

On March 1, 2011, the towns of Fogo, Joe Batt&#x27;s Arm-Barr&#x27;d Islands-Shoal Bay, Seldom-Little Seldom and Tilting and the Fogo Island Region (Stag Harbour, Island Harbour, Deep Bay, and Fogo Island Central) amalgamated to form the Town of Fogo Island.

==Name==

Fogo Island was once called Ilha do Fogo, meaning Isle of Fire. There are a number of theories for the name:

*Many accidental or natural forest fires destroyed the dense forests of the northern part of the island.
*European mariners often saw the burning fires of the Beothuk natives, when they were visiting from across the Atlantic.
*The island may have been named Fogo after the Cape Verde Island&#x27;s active volcano. Note that many Newfoundland geographical features were named by the Spanish, the Portuguese and the French before anglophones (the English, the Irish and the Scots) arrived. Cape Bonavista, Cape Spear, Cape Race, Trinity Bay, Placentia Bay, Notre Dame Bay, Cape St Francis, Baccalieu Island, Baie Verte, Taslow, Baie l&#x27;Argente and even St John&#x27;s or Catalina are place names that were originally named by non-English-speakers.

==Transportation==
Fogo Island is connected to mainland Newfoundland by the ferry MV &quot;Veteran&quot;, and is served by the Fogo Aerodrome airport. The primary roads on the island are Route 333 (Fogo Island Road) and Route 334 (Joe Batt’s Arm Road), as well as Deep Bay Road and Island Harbour Road.

==Tourism and attractions==
The island attracts a wide range of visitors interested in its history, local wildlife and other attractions. It has seven hiking trails, such as Lion&#x27;s Den, Brimstone Head, Turpin&#x27;s and Joe Batt&#x27;s Point Trail. It also has ten Town-owned local museums and heritage properties, including the Marine Interpretation Centre, the Lane House Museum, and the Bleak House Museum. There are also museums run by local individuals, including Mona&#x27;s Quilts &amp; Jams and the Museum of the Flat Earth, now closed.

Fogo Island Arts (launched in 2008) provides a platform for contemporary art on the island, via a series of residencies hosted at different studios around Fogo.

==Literature==

Fogo Island appears in fictional form in the novel &quot;Blaze Island&quot; by Catherine Bush.

<doc id="490442" wikidata="Q45559" url="?curid=490442" title="Geometer moth">
<text>The geometer moths are moths belonging to the family Geometridae of the insect order Lepidoptera, the moths and butterflies. Their scientific name derives from the Ancient Greek &quot;geo&quot; γεω (derivative form of or &quot;the earth&quot;), and &quot;metron&quot; &quot;measure&quot; in reference to the way their larvae, or inchworms, appear to measure the earth as they move along in a looping fashion. Geometridae is a very large family, containing around 23,000 described species; over 1400 species from six subfamilies are indigenous to North America alone. A well-known member is the peppered moth, &quot;Biston betularia&quot;, which has been the subject of numerous studies in population genetics. Several other geometer moths are notorious pests.

==Caterpillars==
The name &quot;Geometridae&quot; ultimately derives from Latin &quot;&quot; from Greek (&quot;geometer&quot;, &quot;earth-measurer&quot;). This refers to the means of locomotion of the larvae or caterpillars, which lack the full complement of prolegs seen in other caterpillars, with only two or three pairs at the posterior end instead of the usual five pairs. Equipped with appendages at both ends of the body, a caterpillar clasps with its front legs and draws up the hind end, then clasps with the hind end (prolegs) and reaches out for a new front attachment, creating the impression that it measures its journey. The caterpillars are accordingly called &quot;loopers&quot;, &quot;spanworms&quot;, or &quot;inchworms&quot; after their characteristic looping gait. The cabbage looper and soybean looper are not inchworms but caterpillars of a different family. In many species of geometer moths, the inchworms are about long. They tend to be green, grey, or brownish and hide from predators by fading into the background or resembling twigs. When disturbed, many inchworms stand erect and motionless on their prolegs, further increasing this resemblance. Some have humps or filaments, or cover themselves in plant material. They are gregarious and are generally smooth. Some eat lichen, flowers, or pollen, while some, such as the Hawaiian species of the genus &quot;Eupithecia&quot;, are carnivorous. Certain destructive inchworm species are referred to as &quot;cankerworms&quot;.

In 2019, the first geometrid caterpillar in Baltic amber was discovered by German scientists. Described under &quot;Eogeometer vadens&quot;, it measured about and was estimated to be 44 million years old, dating back to the Eocene epoch. It was described as the earliest evidence for the subfamily of &quot;Ennominae&quot;, particularly the tribe &quot;Boarmiini&quot;.

==Adults==
Many geometrids have slender abdomens and broad wings which are usually held flat with the hindwings visible. As such, they appear rather butterfly-like, but in most respects they are typical moths. The majority fly at night. They possess a frenulum to link the wings, and the antennae of the males are often feathered. They tend to blend into the background, often with intricate, wavy patterns on their wings. In some species, females have reduced wings (e.g. winter moth and fall cankerworm). Most are of moderate size, about in wingspan, but a range of sizes occur, from , and a few (e.g., &quot;Dysphania&quot; species) reach an even larger size. They have distinctive paired tympanal organs at the base of the abdomen (these are absent in flightless females).

==Systematics==
The placement of the example species follows a 1990 systematic treatment; it may be outdated. Subfamilies are tentatively sorted in a phylogenetic sequence, from the most basal to the most advanced. Traditionally, the Archiearinae were held to be the most ancient of the geometer moth lineages, as their caterpillars have well-developed prolegs. However, it now seems that the Larentiinae are actually older, as indicated by their numerous plesiomorphies and DNA sequence data. They are either an extremely basal lineage of the Geometridae – together with the Sterrhinae – or might even be considered a separate family of Geometroidea. As regards the Archiearinae, some species that were traditionally placed therein actually seem to belong to other subfamilies; altogether it seems that in a few cases, the prolegs which were originally lost in the ancestral geometer moths re-evolved as an atavism.

Larentiinae – about 5,800 species, includes the pug moths, mostly temperate, might be a distinct family.

Sterrhinae – about 2,800 species, mostly tropical, might belong to same family as the Larentiinae.

<text>The Carnegie Foundation () is an organization based in The Hague, Netherlands. It was founded in 1903 by Andrew Carnegie in order to manage his donation of US$1.5 million, which was used for the construction, management and maintenance of the Peace Palace. The Peace Palace was built to house the Permanent Court of Arbitration and a library of international law.

The foundation became the legal owner of the Peace Palace because the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which is based there along with its library, could not own the building under Dutch law.

The foundation has five Dutch board members, of whom four are chosen by the Dutch monarch and one by the Supervisory Board of the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The current chairman of the Carnegie Foundation is Bernard Bot.

Since 1931, the foundation has been entrusted with the annual awarding of the Wateler Peace Prize.

The Carnegie Foundation is a member of the Hague Academic Coalition. This is a consortium of institutions in the fields of international relations, international law and international development, based in The Hague. The Carnegie Foundation is one of the founding partners of The Hague Institute for Global Justice, a research institute in The Hague.

<text>Gonzalo Frasca (born 1972) is a game designer and academic researcher focusing on serious and political videogames. His blog, Ludology.org, was cited by NBC News as a popular designation for academic researchers studying video games. For many years, Frasca also co-published Watercoolergames with Ian Bogost, a blog about serious games.

Frasca was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, where he established Powerful Robot Games, a video game studio. He is Chief Design Officer at DragonBox, a Norwegian pedagogy studio which produces math-learning videogames. Frasca is also a professor at Universidad ORT Uruguay.

In video game theory, Frasca belongs to the group of &quot;ludologists&quot; who consider video games to be simulations based on rules. They see video games as the first simulational media for the masses - which means a paradigm shift in media consumption and production.

Frasca&#x27;s game studies are influenced by the work of Norwegian game academic Espen J. Aarseth. Beginning in December 2004, Frasca studied games at the Center for Computer Games Research at the IT University of Copenhagen. He received his PhD in Videogames studies in August 2007.

His most famous game is the art game, September 12, a response to the September 11 attacks. It is based on the political argument that a direct military response will only increase the likelihood of further terrorist attacks on the West. Despite being controversial at its launch, it is now recognized as a notable early example of both political videogame and newsgame (a term Frasca is credited with coining to refer to a videogame based on real, newsworthy events). In 2009 it received a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Knight Foundation.

==&quot;Simulation versus Narrative: Introduction to Ludology&quot; (2003)==

This work expands on concepts of narratology and ludology as modes for framing game analysis. These concepts were established initially by Frasca in his 1999 text Ludology meets Narratology: Similitude and differences between video games and narrative. He defines ludology as the play-oriented aspects of games, such as mechanics and control schemes. Narrative aspects provide a context for the play-oriented features within the gamespace. As noted in the text&#x27;s introductory paragraphs, Frasca&#x27;s writing on ludology was spurred by a desire to address the inadequacies of games studies literature. He states that games studies literature of the late 1990s and early 2000s involved the framing of game analysis within dramatic and narrative frameworks. This could include the framing of games within understandings of film and written literature. There was no existing model to consider games on their own terms (namely play and interactivity); a significant limitation in academically engaging with the medium. Interactivity is an intrinsic facet of the medium, however, no formal academic discipline existed which could address it.
Through the proposition of a ludic framework, Frasca aims to encourage analysts to consider how play elements interact and convey meaning. This model of game analysis works similarly to Espen Aarseth&#x27;s theoretical framework of digital textual analysis involving the reading of texts as cybernetic systems.

===Simulation versus representation===

Frasca distinguishes between simulational and representational media, with videogames being part of the former and &#x27;traditional&#x27; media being the latter. The key difference, he argues, is that simulations react to certain stimuli, such as configurative input data (button presses etc.), according to a set of conditions. Generally, representational media (he provides the example of a photograph) produce a fixed description of traits and sequences of events (narrative), and cannot be manipulated. 
He places emphasis on the importance of serious games, most notably the use of games for political purposes. Unlike traditional modes of storytelling, simulation is not binary by nature. According to Frasca, this has benefits when applied to the political propaganda simulation. 

Simulation output is also discussed, with Frasca drawing attention to the argument that the sequence of signs produced by the film and the simulation look exactly the same. Frasca notes that what these commentators have failed to understand is that simulation cannot be understood solely through its output; the player&#x27;s direct input is a fundamental part of simulation. 
This is reminiscent of Aarseth&#x27;s work on user engagement in games and simulations. He argues that it is insufficient to &quot;merely observe the audiovisual output from someone else&#x27;s playing...&quot;, and that in order to fully understand an interactive digital text one must experience it first-hand.

===Paidia and ludus===

Frasca draws links to the game-type categorisations established by Roger Caillois in Man, Play and Games (1961). Specifically, he engages with concepts of ludus and paideia; that is, play and game, or the rule based structures of games. Frasca expands on Caillois&#x27; original definitions, and positions them in relation to narratology, ludology and contemporary games. According to Frasca, &quot;ludus&quot; is associated with more linear, narrative oriented with clearly defined goals and grounded in a set of rules. &quot;Paidia&quot;, while also based in a system of rules, is more abstract. Players are able to create their own goals within the game world in the style of emergent gameplay.

Drawing on his redefined concepts of padia and ludus, Frasca establishes varying levels in simulations which can be manipulated in order to convey ideology.

# Simulation shared with narrative and deals with representation and events. – For example, characteristics of objects, characters, etc. He notes that &quot;a simple switching of character skins could turn Quake into a deathmatch between Israeli&#x27;s and Palestinians...the rules of the game remain unchanged...only the characters and settings are modified. However, on an ideological level, this game completely differs from the original...&quot;
# Manipulation of game rules. – What a player can do within a particular game model. This relates directly to the concepts of paidia and emergence; modes of exploratory play. He notes the ideological differences between narratively guided actions and emergent, player-driven actions.
# Goal rules. – Aspects of gameplay which are a mandatory condition for &#x27;winning&#x27;. This is in line with ludus&#x27; rule based structure.
# Meta rules – Modification of the game world. Open source, modding etc. Frasca uses the meta-rule simauthor as a point of contrast to the author of traditional narratives.

==Influences and responses==

While Frasca maintains the importance of play elements in games and simulation, he acknowledges the narratological paradigm should not be disregarded. He posits that it is necessary to understand the structure and elements of games, creating typologies and models for explaining game mechanics.

Since the establishment of ludology as a formal approach to reading games and simulation, numerous academics have framed their works within the ludic and narratological paradigm. However, unlike Frasca&#x27;s work, scholarship has emerged which discounts the significance of the narrative. In ′Ludologists love stories, too: Notes from a debate that never took place′ (a response to misinterpretation of Frasca&#x27;s position on ludology and narratology), Frasca cites Rune Klevjer&#x27;s critical misunderstanding of ludic principles. Klevjer suggests that the ludologist deems anything other than pure game mechanics as essentially alien to the medium&#x27;s true aesthetic form, and that games should shift toward a more abstract and play oriented models.

Frasca&#x27;s ludic and narratological principles have also influenced scholarship on the cultural colonialisation of videogames. This area of study deems the common practice of framing games within filmic traditions as detrimental to game analysis, as games should &quot;reject any intervention from other disciplines...&quot; Furthermore, it is argued that cinema is a highly privileged medium due to the fact that it can be used to frame game analysis.

Other pro-ludic arguments have claimed that contemporary videogames are unable to effectively model player actions within the narrative. Particular areas of games studies suggest that games are unable to create a coherent ludonarrative. One of the most notable examples of this is Clint Hocking&#x27;s blog post on ludonarrative dissonance. Such dissonance, according to Hocking, occurs when a game exhibits conflicting ideas expressed via narrative and gameplay means. Specifically, using the example of Irrational&#x27;s Bioshock, he argues that the game&#x27;s core theme of Randian self-interest (explored through the Little Sister mechanic, whereby the player has the choice to harvest a powerful substance known as ADAM from these NPCs or free them) is undermined by Jack&#x27;s aiding of Atlas; a scripted and predetermined narrative sequence.

<text>Baron Leigh has been created twice as a hereditary title, once in the Peerage of England and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The writer Jane Austen is associated with this dynasty. 

The first creation came in the Peerage of England 1643 when Sir Thomas Leigh, 2nd Baronet, was created Baron Leigh, of Stoneleigh in the County of Warwick. 

The Leigh Baronetcy, of Stoneleigh in the County of Warwick, had been created in 1611 for his grandfather and namesake Thomas Leigh Sr. The latter was the second son of Sir Thomas Leigh (d. 1571) and his wife Alice née Barker, an hieress of Sir Rowland Hill. Thomas Lee Sr. was Lord Mayor of London in 1558) and his third son Sir William Leigh was the grandfather of Francis Leigh, 1st Earl of Chichester. 

The titles became extinct on the death of the fifth Baron Leigh in 1786.

The barony was revived in 1839 when the poet Chandos Leigh was created Baron Leigh, of Stoneleigh in the County of Warwick, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was a descendant of Rowland Leigh, eldest son of the aforementioned Sir Thomas Leigh (d. 1571), himself of a cadet branch of the ancient Leighs of West Hall, High Legh. Both Lord Leigh&#x27;s son, the second Baron, and grandson, the third Baron, served as Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire. The third Baron was succeeded by his nephew, the fourth Baron. the title is held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the sixth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2003.

Sir Edward Chandos Leigh, second son of the first Baron, was a cricketer and barrister. James Wentworth Leigh, third son of the first Baron, was Dean of Hereford. Gilbert Leigh, eldest son and heir of the second Baron, who sat as Member of Parliament for Warwickshire South predeceased his father. Theophilus Leigh, who belonged to a junior branch of the family, married Mary Brydges, sister of The 1st Duke of Chandos, and was the father of Thomas Leigh (died 1764): Thomas, in turn, was the father of Cassandra Leigh, mother of Jane Austen.

The family seat was Stoneleigh Abbey, near Kenilworth, Warwickshire. In 1960, a serious fire broke out at Stoneleigh Abbey and caused considerable damage to the fabric of the house. Some time thereafter the 4th Baron Leigh (1908-1979) transferred the ownership of Stoneleigh Abbey to a charitable trust. but members of the Leigh family continued to reside at Stoneleigh Abbey until 1990. The current family seat of the Barons Leigh is the Adlestrop Park Estate, near Moreton-in-Marsh, in the Gloucestershire Cotswolds. This estate was transferred by the 4th Baron Leigh to his eldest son and heir, the subsequent 5th Baron Leigh (1935-2003) in 1960, and remains in the ownership of the present 6th Baron Leigh (b.1960) and his family.

<text>Gallery or Menalto Gallery is an open-source project enabling management and publication of digital photographs and other media through a PHP-enabled web server. Photo manipulation includes automatic thumbnails, resizing, rotation, and flipping, among other things. Albums can be organized hierarchically and individually controlled by administrators or privileged users.

==History==
Gallery 3 is the current release of Gallery. It is a complete rewrite of Gallery 2 intended to be small, intuitive, fast, and easily customizable. Gallery 3.0 was released on October 5, 2010. Gallery 3.0.9 was released on June 28, 2013. Since 2017, Gallery 3 development has continued on GitHub. Support was transferred to the Gallery 3 Users Forum. On November 14, 2021, Gallery 3 version 3.1.5 was released to include support for PHP 8.

Gallery 2 was publicly released on September 13, 2005. Gallery 2.3.1 included support for PHP 5.3 and was released on December 17, 2009. Development of Gallery 2 ceased in 2012.

Gallery 1 was released in April 2001 and was developed for seven years, the last release being version 1.5.10 on November 21, 2008.

Gallery participated in the Google Summer of Code in 2006, 2007, and 2008. Gallery also participated in OpenUsability&#x27;s Season of Usability in 2008 and 2009.

In 2003, Gallery was SourceForge&#x27;s October Project of the Month.

==Requirements==
Gallery 3 Requires:
*Apache version 2.2 or greater
*MySQL 5.0 or greater
*PHP 5.4 or greater

== Controversy ==
In 2010, Gallery announced the use of some proprietary Adobe tools to build some components of Gallery 3 in Adobe Flash. Several users expressed great concern that proprietary software was being used in an open-source project and that Flash components were being included in an open-source package. A rebuttal to the controversy included a disclosure that Adobe Flash objects had previously been used for file uploading functionality in Gallery only seemed to further ignite the controversy. In 2019 Gallery 3.1.0 was released which replaced the Flash-based uploader with modern open source code.

== Revival ==
In June 2013 the developers of Gallery 3 released version 3.0.9 code-named &quot;Chartres&quot; and in June 2014 announced that they would suspend further development of Gallery 3. The GPL license allowed for continued development by others or the creation of a fork of Gallery based on the existing code. In 2019 a group of long-time Gallery 3 users developed and released Gallery 3.1.1 to keep the program viable on servers running PHP 7 and 8 which also included additional technical and feature improvements. Version 3.1.5 of Gallery 3 was released on November 14, 2021.

<doc id="490467" wikidata="Q103841" url="?curid=490467" title="Candelaria, Quezon">
<text>Candelaria, officially the Municipality of Candelaria (), is a municipality in the province of Quezon, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 137,881 people.

It is the third most populous settlement of Quezon after Lucena City and Sariaya. Among the municipalities in Quezon Province, Candelaria has the most desiccated coconut factories and oil refineries, such as Peter Paul Philippine Corporation, Primex Coco Products Inc., Pacific Royal Basic Foods, SuperStar Corporation, Tongsan Industrial Development Corporation, and others, which employ thousands of people.

==History==

===Foundation===
Prior to 1885, the pioneering barangays of Candelaria in its western part, Taguan (Bukal), Kinatihan and Masin were parts of the Municipality of Tiaong, while Malabanban, Mangilag and Santa Catalina in the east, were under the jurisdiction of the town of Sariaya.
Sr. Don Ciriaco Nadres, a local leader of Barangay Masinand his wife Sra. Doña Baltazara Bustamante, with the support of Don Simeon Nadres and wife Doña Everista Ona, Don Justo Argao, Don Elino de Gala, Don Apolinario Gonzales, Don Tomas Cabuñag, Don Ignacio de Ramos, Don Domingo de Alday, Don Tomas Regidor, Don Juan del Valle, Don Ambrocio Salazar, Don Buenaventura Cedeño and Don Hipolito Martinez, proposed the establishment of an independent government over these barangays. They became known as the founding families of the town.
It was on December 26, 1878, that a permit was granted by the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands, Domingo Moriones y Murillo for the establishment of an independent government over these barangays. Its boundaries were fixed by means of a treaty signed by the notable leaders of Tiaong, Sariaya and the founding families of Candelaria.

King Alfonso XII of Spain finally approved the establishment of Candelaria as an independent town on August 5, 1879.

===American Era and Japanese Occupation===
In 1902, after the cessation of the general hostilities against the Americans, administration of Candelaria was merged with the neighboring town of Sariaya. In 1907, Candelaria was again managed independently, as a fourth-class municipality. During the American regime, the town progressed by leaps and bounds. Many houses and public edifices were constructed, and commerce and industries grew, until the Japanese invasion brought a further wave of destruction.

The playground will be lit with lighting standards. The fundraising for the project will be accomplished through a 1000 Points of Light campaign where each point of light will be represented by a Candelarian or friends of Candelaria contributing Php5000 or more. Inauguration is scheduled for February 2, 2013, CANDLE FESTIVAL celebration. Ground breaking is targeted for August 4, 2012, ARAW NG CANDELARIA.

<text>The Tonton Macoute () or simply the Macoute, was a Haitian paramilitary and secret police force created in 1959 by dictator François &quot;Papa Doc&quot; Duvalier. Haitians named this force after the Haitian mythological bogeyman, (&quot;Uncle Gunnysack&quot;), who kidnaps and punishes unruly children by snaring them in a gunny sack () before carrying them off to be consumed for breakfast. The Macoute were known for their brutality, state terrorism, and assassinations. In 1970, the militia was renamed the &#x27; (VSN, ). Though formally disbanded in 1986, its members continued to terrorize the country.

==History==
After the July 1958 Haitian coup attempt against President François Duvalier, he purged the army and law enforcement agencies in Haiti and executed numerous officers perceived to be a threat to his regime. To counteract such activity, he created a military force that bore several names. In 1959, his paramilitary force was called the (&quot;Hooded Men&quot;). They were renamed to (&quot;Civilian Militia&quot;) and, after 1962, (&quot;Volunteers of the National Security&quot;, or VSN). They began to be called the when people started to disappear or were found killed for no apparent reason. This group answered to him only.

Duvalier authorized the to commit systematic violence, terrorism, and human rights abuses to suppress political opposition. They were responsible for unknown numbers of murders and rapes in Haiti. Political opponents often disappeared overnight, or were sometimes attacked in broad daylight. stoned and burned people alive. Many times they put the corpses of their victims on display, often hung in trees for everyone to see and take as warnings against opposition. Family members who tried to remove the bodies for proper burial often disappeared. Anyone who challenged the VSN risked assassination. Their unrestrained state terrorism was accompanied by corruption, extortion, and personal aggrandizement among the leadership. The victims of could range from a woman in the poorest of neighborhoods who had previously supported an opposing politician to a businessman who refused to comply with extortion threats (ostensibly taken as donations for public works, but which were in fact the source of profit for corrupt officials and even President Duvalier). The murdered between 30,000 and 60,000 Haitians.

Luckner Cambronne led the throughout the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s. His cruelty earned him the nickname &quot;Vampire of the Caribbean&quot;. He extorted blood plasma from locals for sale for his profit. Cambronne did this through his company &quot;Hemocaribian&quot;; he shipped five tons of plasma per month to US Labs. He also sold cadavers to medical schools after buying them from Haitian hospitals for $3 per corpse. When the Hospital could not supply bodies, he used local funeral homes. 

In 1971, after Duvalier died, his widow Simone and son Jean-Claude &quot;Baby Doc&quot; Duvalier ordered Cambronne into exile. Cambronne moved to Miami, Florida, US, where he lived until his death in 2006.

When François Duvalier came to power in 1957, Vodou was becoming celebrated as authentic Haitian culture by intellectuals and the griots, after it had been dropped for years by those with education. The were strongly influenced by Vodou tradition and adopted denim uniforms resembling clothing like that of Azaka Medeh, the patron of farmers. They carried and used machetes in symbolic reference to Ogun, a great general in Vodou tradition.

Some of the most important members of the were Vodou leaders. This religious affiliation gave the a kind of unearthly authority in the eyes of the public. From their methods to their choice of clothes, Vodou always played an important role in the paramilitary&#x27;s actions. The wore straw hats, blue denim shirts and dark glasses, and were armed with machetes and guns. Both their allusions to the supernatural and their physical presentations were used to instill fear and respect among the common people, including any opposition actors. Their title of Tonton Macoute was embedded in Haitian lore of a bogeyman who took children away in his sack, or Makoute.

The were a ubiquitous presence at the polls in 1961, when Duvalier held a presidential referendum in which the official vote count was an &quot;outrageous&quot; and fraudulent , electing him to another term. They appeared in force again at the polls in 1964, when Duvalier held a constitutional referendum that declared him president for life.

==Legacy==
From 1985, the United States began to stop funding aid to Haiti, cutting nearly a million dollars within a year. Nonetheless, the Baby Doc regime pushed forward and even had a national party for the . day was 29 July 1985; among the festivities, the group was bestowed new uniforms and was honored by all of Baby Doc&#x27;s cabinet. In the exuberance, the went out into the streets and shot 27 people for the national party.

The lack of funds going to the was a result of those funds being intercepted by the Duvalier dynasty. It sometimes took nearly 80 percent of international aid to Haiti, but paid only 45 percent of the country&#x27;s debts. This continued until the was left on its own when &quot;Baby Doc&quot; fled the country with an estimated $900 million.

The remained active even after the presidency of Baby Doc ended in 1986, at the height of the Anti-Duvalier protest movement. Massacres led by paramilitary groups spawned from the r-Macoutes continued during the following decade. The most feared paramilitary group during the 1990s was the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haïti (FRAPH), which &quot;Toronto Star&quot; journalist Linda Diebel described as modern &quot;Tonton Macoutes&quot;, and not the legitimate political party it claimed to be.

Led by Emmanual Constant, FRAPH differed from the in its denial to submit to the will of a single authority and its cooperation with regular military forces. FRAPH extended its reach far outside that of the Haitian state and had offices present in New York City, Montreal, and Miami until its disarmament and disbandment in 1994.

<text>Baron Londesborough, of Londesborough in the East Riding of the County of York, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1850 for the diplomat and Whig politician Lord Albert Denison. He was the third son of Henry Conyngham, 1st Marquess Conyngham, and his wife Elizabeth Denison. Born Albert Denison Conyngham, he assumed by royal licence the surname of Denison in lieu of Conyngham in 1849 on inheriting the vast fortune of his maternal uncle William Joseph Denison (1770–1849). Before his elevation to the peerage, Denison had represented Canterbury in Parliament. His eldest son, the second Baron, sat as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Beverley and Scarborough. In 1887 he was created Viscount Raincliffe, of Raincliffe in the North Riding of the County of York, and Earl of Londesborough, in the County of York. These titles were also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. However, the viscountcy and the earldom became extinct on the death of his grandson, the fourth Earl, in 1937.

The barony was inherited by the late Earl&#x27;s second cousin once removed, the sixth Baron. He was the son of Rear-Admiral the Hon. Albert Denison, second son of the first Baron. On his death this line of the family failed, and the title passed to his first cousin, the seventh Baron. He was the only son of Commander the Hon. Conyngham Albert Denison, fourth son of the first Baron. When he died this line of the family also failed. He was succeeded by his first cousin, the eighth Baron. He was the only son of the Hon. Harold Albert Denison, fifth son of the first Baron. , the title is held by his only son, the ninth Baron, who succeeded in 1968. As a male-line descendant of the first Marquess Conyngham, he is also in remainder to this peerage and its subsidiary titles.

<doc id="490476" wikidata="Q596073" url="?curid=490476" title="Dugout canoe">
<text>A dugout canoe or simply dugout is a boat made from a hollowed-out tree. Other names for this type of boat are logboat and monoxylon. &quot;Monoxylon&quot; (&quot;μονόξυλον&quot;) (pl: &quot;monoxyla&quot;) is Greek&quot;mono-&quot; (single) + &quot; xylon&quot; (tree)and is mostly used in classic Greek texts. In German, they are called Einbaum (&quot;one tree&quot; in English). Some, but not all, pirogues are also constructed in this manner.

Dugouts are the oldest boat type archaeologists have found, dating back about 8,000 years to the Neolithic Stone Age. This is probably because they are made of massive pieces of wood, which tend to preserve better than others, such as bark canoes.

==Construction==
Construction of a dugout begins with the selection of a log of suitable dimensions. Sufficient wood must be removed to make the vessel relatively light in weight and buoyant, yet still strong enough to support the crew and cargo. Specific types of wood were often preferred based on their strength, durability, and density. The shape of the boat is then fashioned to minimize drag, with sharp ends at the bow and stern.

First, the bark is removed from the exterior. Before the appearance of metal tools, dugouts were hollowed out using controlled fires. The burnt wood was then removed using an adze. Another method using tools is to chop out parallel notches across the interior span of the wood, then split out and remove the wood from between the notches. Once hollowed out, the interior was dressed and smoothed out with a knife or adze.

More primitive designs keep the tree&#x27;s original dimensions, with a round bottom. However, it is possible to carefully steam the sides of the hollow log until they are pliable, then bend to create a more flat-bottomed &quot;boat&quot; shape with a wider beam in the centre.

For travel in the rougher waters of the ocean, dugouts can be fitted with outriggers. One or two smaller logs are mounted parallel to the main hull by long poles. In the case of two outriggers, one is mounted on either side of the hull.

==Africa==
The Dufuna canoe from Nigeria is an 8000-year-old dugout, the oldest boat discovered in Africa, and is, by varying accounts, the second or third-oldest ship worldwide.
The well-watered tropical rainforest and woodland regions of sub-Saharan Africa provide both the waterways and the trees for dugout canoes, which are commonplace from the Limpopo River basin in the south through East and Central Africa and across to West Africa. African teak is the timber favoured for their construction, though this comprises a number of different species, and is in short supply in some areas. Dugouts are paddled across deep lakes and rivers or punted through channels in swamps (see &quot;makoro&quot; or &quot;mtumbwi&quot;) or in shallow areas, and are used for transport, fishing, and hunting, including, in the past, the very dangerous hunting of hippopotamus. Dugouts are called pirogues in Francophone areas of Africa.

A Nok sculpture portrays two individuals, along with their goods, in a dugout canoe. Both of the anthropomorphic figures in the watercraft are paddling. The Nok terracotta depiction of a dugout canoe may indicate that Nok people utilized dugout canoes to transport cargo, along tributaries (e.g., Gurara River) of the Niger River, and exchanged them in a regional trade network. The Nok terracotta depiction of a figure with a seashell on its head may indicate that the span of these riverine trade routes may have extended to the Atlantic Coast. In the maritime history of Africa, there is the earlier Dufuna canoe, which was constructed approximately 8000 years ago in the northern region of Nigeria; as the second earliest form of water vessel known in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Nok terracotta depiction of a dugout canoe was created in the central region of Nigeria during the first millennium BCE.

The engineering and methodology (e.g., cultural valuations, use of iron tools) used in the construction of West African dugout canoes (e.g., rounded point sterns and pointed bows with 15° - 50° angle above water surface, increased stability via partly rounded or flat base, v-shaped hull, shallow draft for sailing water depths less than one foot, occasionally spanning more than one hundred feet in length) contributed to the capability of the canoes to be able to persist and navigate throughout the interconnected river system that connected the Benue River, Gambia River, Niger River, and Senegal River as well as Lake Chad; this river system connected diverse sources of water (e.g., lakes, rivers, seas, streams) and ecological zones (e.g., Sahara, Sahel, Savanna), and allowed for the transport of people, information, and economic goods along riverine trade networks that connect various locations (e.g., Bamako, Djenne, Gao, Mopti, Segou, Timbuktu) throughout West Africa and North Africa. The knowledge and understanding (e.g., hydrography, marine geography, how canoe navigation is affected by the depth of the water, tides in the ocean, currents, and winds) of West African canoers facilitated the skillful navigation of various channels of the regional river system, while engaging in activities such as trade and fishing. The construction schema for West African dugout canoes were also used among canoes in the Americas constructed by the African diaspora. The sacredness of canoe-making is expressed in a proverb from Senegambia: &quot;The blood of kings and the tears of the canoe-maker are sacred things which must not touch the ground.&quot; In addition to possessing economic value, West African dugout canoes also possessed a sociocultural and psychospiritual value.

In 1735 CE, John Atkins observed: &quot;Canoos are what used through the whole Coast for transporting Men and Goods.&quot; European rowboats, which frequently capsized, were able to be outmaneuvered and outperformed in terms of speed by West African dugout canoes. Barbot stated, regarding West African canoers and West African dugout canoes, the &quot;speed with which these people generally make these boats travel is beyond belief.&quot; Alvise da Cadamosto also observed how &quot;effortlessly&quot; Portuguese caravels were outperformed by Gambian dugout canoes. The skill of Kru canoers to be able to navigate the challenging conditions of the sea was also observed by Charles Thomas.

Amid the 1590s CE, Komenda and Takoradi in Ghana served as production areas for dugout canoes made by the Ahanta people. By 1679 CE, Barbot observed Takoradi to be &quot;a major canoe-producing center, crafting dugouts capable of carrying up to eight tons.&quot; Between the 17th century CE and 18th century CE, a production area and/or marketplace of dugout canoes was in Shama, which later became only a marketplace on Supome Island. Amid the 1660s CE, in addition to other local canoers manufacturing dugout canoes, the Fetu people were observed by Muller as having bought dugout canoes that were made by the Ahanta people.

West Africans (e.g., Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Senegal) and western Central Africans (e.g., Cameroon) independently developed the skill of surfing. Amid the 1640s CE, Michael Hemmersam provided an account of surfing in the Gold Coast: &quot;the parents &#x27;tie their children to boards and throw them into the water. In 1679 CE, Barbot provided an account of surfing among Elmina children in Ghana: &quot;children at Elmina learned &quot;to swim, on bits of boards, or small bundles of rushes, fasten&#x27;d under their stomachs, which is a good diversion to the spectators.&quot; James Alexander provided an account of surfing in Accra, Ghana in 1834 CE: &quot;From the beach, meanwhile, might be seen boys swimming into the sea, with light boards under their stomachs. They waited for a surf; and came rolling like a cloud on top of it. But I was told that sharks occasionally dart in behind the rocks and &#x27;yam&#x27; them.&quot; Thomas Hutchinson provided an account of surfing in southern Cameroon in 1861: &quot;Fishermen rode small dugouts &#x27;no more than six feet in length, fourteen to sixteen inches in width, and from four to six inches in depth.

==Asia==

An 8000-year-old dugout canoe was found by archaeologists in Kuahuqiao, Zhejiang Province, in east China. This is the earliest canoe found in Asia.

The Moken, an ethnic group that lives in Myanmar&#x27;s Mergui Archipelago and the north of Thailand as sea nomads, still builds and uses dugout canoes. According to the Moken&#x27;s accounts of their people&#x27;s origin, a mythical queen punished the forbidden love of their ancestral forefather for his sister-in-law by banishing him and his descendants to life on sea in dugout canoes with indentations fore and aft (&quot;a mouth that eats and a rear that defecates&quot;), symbolizing the unending cycle of ingestion, digestion and evacuation.

A centuries-old unfinished dugout boat, a big banca (five tons, measuring by by ) was accidentally retrieved in November 2010 by Mayor Ricardo Revita at Barangay Casanicolasan, Rosales, Pangasinan, Philippines, in Lagasit River, near Agno River. It is now on display in front of the Municipal Town Hall.
Dugout canoes are one of the most used traditional fishing vessels in India. Forest Department at Kolleru Lake held various contests with the dugout canoe among local fishing communities. In an era where the traditional canoe faces extinction, the boat race saw 22 participants. They also noted that within two decades, there were over 1,000 dugout canoes employed for fishing in the lake. Now, their count has dwindled to less than a hundred.

==Europe==

In ancient Europe many dugouts were made from linden wood, for several reasons. First, linden trees were abundant in the Paleolithic after the melting of the Weichselian glaciation and readily available. Secondly, linden grew to be one of the tallest trees in the forests of the time, making it easier to build longer boats. Linden wood also lends itself well to carving and doesn&#x27;t split or crack easily. It is also lighter than most other tree types in European old-growth forests, and for this reason, boats made from linden wood have a better cargo capacity and are easier to carry.

The Pesse canoe, found in the Netherlands, is a dugout which is believed to be the world&#x27;s oldest boat, carbon dated to between 8040 BCE and 7510 BCE. Other dugouts discovered in the Netherlands include two in the province of North Holland: in 2003, near Uitgeest, dated at 617-600 BC; and in 2007, near Den Oever, dated at 3300-3000 BC.

Dugouts have also been found in Germany. In German, the craft is known as &quot;Einbaum&quot; (one-tree). In the old Hanseatic town of Stralsund, three log-boats were excavated in 2002. Two of the boats were around 7,000 years old and are the oldest boats found in the Baltic area. The third boat (6,000 years old) was long and holds the record as the longest dugout in the region. The finds have partly deteriorated due to poor storage conditions.

In 1991, remains of a linden wood log-boat of nearly were found at Männedorf-Strandbad in Switzerland at Lake Zürich. The boat has since been dated to be 6,500 years old.

In 1902 an oak logboat over long and wide, was found at Addergoole Bog, Lurgan, County Galway, Ireland, and delivered to the National Museum of Ireland. The Lurgan boat radiocarbon date was 3940 +/- 25 BP. The boat has holes suggesting that it had an outrigger or was joined to another boat.

In 2012, at Parc Glyndwr, Monmouth, Monmouthshire, Wales, UK, an excavation by the Monmouth Archeological Society, revealed three ditches suggesting a Neolithic dugout trimaran of similar length to the Lurgan log boat, carbon dated to 3700+/-35 BP.

&quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; details how the Slavs built monoxyla that they sold to Rus&#x27; in Kiev. These boats were then used against the Byzantine Empire during the Rus&#x27;–Byzantine Wars of the 9th and 10th centuries. They used dugouts to attack Constantinople and to withdraw into their lands with bewildering speed and mobility. Hence, the name of Δρομίται (&quot;people on the run&quot;) applied to the Rus in some Byzantine sources. The monoxyla were often accompanied by larger galleys, that served as command and control centres. Each Slavic dugout could hold from 40 to 70 warriors.

The Cossacks of the Zaporozhian Host were also renowned for their artful use of dugouts, which issued from the Dnieper to raid the shores of the Black Sea in the 16th and 17th centuries. Using small, shallow-draft, and highly maneuverable galleys known as &quot;chaiky&quot;, they moved swiftly across the Black Sea. According to the Cossacks&#x27; own records, these vessels, carrying a 50 to 70 man crew, could reach the coast of Anatolia from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours.

More than 40 pre-historic log-boats have been found in the Czech Republic. The latest discovery was in 1999 of a long log-boat in Mohelnice. It was cut out of a single oak log and has a width of . The log-boat has been dated to around 1000 BC and is kept at the Mohelnice Museum (Museum of National History). Geographically, Czech log-boat sites and remains are clustered along the Elbe and Morava rivers.

Poland is known for so-called &quot;Lewin&quot;-type log-boats, found at Lewin Brzeski, Koźle and Roszowicki Las accordingly, and associated with the Przeworsk culture in the early centuries CE. Lewin logboats are characterized by a square or trapezoidal cross-section, rectangular hull-ends and low height of the sides in relation to vessel length. In addition, nearly all the Lewin-type boats have a single hole in the bow and two at the stern. The low height is a result of the parent log being split lengthwise in half, in order to obtain two identical timbers from a single trunk. The advantage lies in the resulting identical twin hulls, which are then joined to form a double-hulled raft. The paired hulls were joined by transverse poles, which did not go through the holes in the platform ends but were fastened to the top walls or in special grooves at the hull ends. These vessels were typically – in length, and the largest of them could carry up to 1.5 tons of cargo because of the special design.

Many pre-historic dugout boats have been found in Scandinavia. These boats were used for transport on calmer bodies of water, fishing and maybe occasionally for whaling and sealing. Dugouts require no metal parts, and were common amongst the Stone Age people in Northern Europe until large trees suitable for making this type of watercraft became scarce. Length was limited to the size of trees in the old-growth forests—up to in length. In Denmark in 2001, and some years prior to that, a few dugout canoes of linden wood, was unearthed in a large-scale archaeological excavation project in Egådalen, north of Aarhus. They have been carbon dated to the years 5210-4910 BCE and they are the oldest known boats in Northern Europe. In Scandinavia, later models increased freeboard (and seaworthiness) by lashing additional boards to the side of the dugout. Eventually, the dugout portion was reduced to a solid keel, and the lashed boards on the sides became a lapstrake hull.

In the United Kingdom, two log boats were discovered in Newport, Shropshire, and are now on display at Harper Adams University Newport. The Iron Age residents of Great Britain, were known to have used longboats for fishing and basic trade. In 1964, a logboat was uncovered in Poole Harbour, Dorset. The Poole Logboat dated to 300 BC, was large enough to accommodate 18 people and was constructed from a giant oak tree. It is currently located in the Poole Museum. An even older logboat (the Hanson log boat) was unearthed in 1998 in Shardlow south of Derby. It has been dated to the Bronze Ages around 1500 BCE and is now exhibited at Derby Museum and Art Gallery. There was another pre-historic boat at the same location, but it was buried &quot;in situ&quot;.

In Northern Europe, the tradition of making dugout canoes survived into the 20th and 21st centuries in Estonia, where seasonal floods in Soomaa, a wilderness area, make conventional means of transportation impossible. In recent decades, a new surge of interest in crafting dugouts (Estonian &quot;haabjas&quot;) has revitalized the ancient tradition. In December 2021 dugout boat culture of Estonia&#x27;s Soomaa region was added to UNESCO&#x27;s Intangible Cultural Heritage list.

==The Americas==


Dugout canoes were constructed by indigenous people throughout the Americas, where suitable logs were available.

The Native Americans of the Pacific Northwest were and are still very skilled at crafting wood. Best known for totem poles up to tall, they also construct dugout canoes over long for everyday use and ceremonial purposes. In the state of Washington, dugout canoes are traditionally made from huge cedar logs (such as Pacific red cedar) for ocean travelers, while natives around smaller rivers use spruce logs. Cedar logs have a resilience in salt water much greater than spruce.

In 1978, Geordie Tocher and two companions sailed a dugout canoe (the &quot;Orenda II&quot;), based on Haida designs (but with sails), from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to Hawaii. The dugout was long, made of Douglas fir, and weighed . The mission was launched to add credibility to stories that the Haida had travelled to Hawaii in ancient times. Altogether, the group ventured some after two months at sea.

==Oceania==

===Pacific Islands===
The Pacific Ocean has been the nursery for many different forms of dugout sailing craft. They differ in their sail plan (i.e., crab-claw or half-crab-claw, Latin, or triangular), hull formats (single, double, catamaran or proa), the absence or presence of a beam (a bridge for a double hull). Hull shapes and end forms vary greatly. Masts can &quot;be right or made of double spars.&quot; Hulls can be constructed by assembling boards or digging out tree trunks. Intended use (fish, war, sea voyage) and geographical features (beach, lagoon, reefs) are reflected in the design. Importantly, there is an important dividing line: some craft use a tacking rig; others &quot;shunt&quot; that is change tack &quot;by reversing the sail from one end of the hull to the other.&quot; Tacking rigs are similar to those seen in most parts of the world, but shunting rigs change tack by reversing the sail from one end of the hull to the other and sailing in the opposite direction (the &quot;Pushmi-pullyu&quot; of the sailing world).

In the Pacific Islands, dugout canoes are very large, made from whole mature trees and fitted with outriggers for increased stability in the ocean, and were once used for long-distance travel.

===New Zealand===
The very large waka is used by Māori people, who came to New Zealand probably from East Polynesia in about 1280. Such vessels carried 40 to 80 warriors in calm sheltered coastal waters or rivers. It is believed that trans-ocean voyages were made in Polynesian catamarans and one hull, carbon-dated to about 1400, was found in New Zealand in 2011. In New Zealand smaller waka were made from a single log, often totara, because of its lightness, strength and resistance to rotting. Larger waka were made of about seven parts lashed together with flax rope. All waka are characterized by very low freeboard. In Hawaii, &quot;waa&quot; (canoes) are traditionally manufactured from the trunk of the koa tree. They typically carry a crew of six: one steersman and five paddlers.

===Australasia===

The Australian Aboriginal people began using dugout canoes from around 1640 in coastal regions of northern Australia. They were brought by Buginese fishers of sea cucumbers, known as trepangers, from Makassar in South Sulawesi. In Arnhem Land, dugout canoes are used by the local Yolngu people, called &quot;lipalipa&quot; or &quot;lippa-lippa&quot;.

Torres Strait Islander people used a double outrigger, unique to their area and probably introduced from Papuan communities and later modified. It was about long, with two bamboo masts and sails made of pandanus-mat. They could sail as far as and carry up to 12 people.

===Solomon Islanders===
The Solomon Islanders have used and continue to use dugout canoes to travel between islands. In World War II these were used during the Japanese occupation - with their small visual and noise signatures these were among the smallest boats used by the Allied forces in World War II. After the sinking of &quot;PT-109&quot;, Biuku Gasa reached the shipwrecked John F. Kennedy by dugout.

<doc id="490484" wikidata="Q3217022" url="?curid=490484" title="Land Ordinance of 1785">
<text>The Land Ordinance of 1785 was adopted by the United States Congress of the Confederation on May 20, 1785. It set up a standardized system whereby settlers could purchase title to farmland in the undeveloped west. Congress at the time did not have the power to raise revenue by direct taxation, so land sales provided an important revenue stream. The Ordinance set up a survey system that eventually covered over three-quarters of the area of the continental United States.

The earlier Land Ordinance of 1784 was a resolution written by Thomas Jefferson calling for Congress to take action. The land west of the Appalachian Mountains, north of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi River was to be divided into ten separate states. However, the 1784 resolution did not define the mechanism by which the land would become states, or how the territories would be governed or settled before they became states. The Ordinance of 1785 put the 1784 resolution in operation by providing a mechanism for selling and settling the land, while the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 addressed political needs.

The 1785 ordinance laid the foundations of land policy until passage of the Homestead Act of 1862. The Land Ordinance established the basis for the Public Land Survey System. The initial surveying was performed by Thomas Hutchins. After he died in 1789, responsibility for surveying was transferred to the Surveyor General. Land was to be systematically surveyed into square townships, on a side, each divided into thirty-six sections of or . These sections could then be subdivided for re-sale by settlers and land speculators.

The ordinance was also significant for establishing a mechanism for funding public education. Section 16 in each township was reserved for the maintenance of public schools. Many schools today are still located in section sixteen of their respective townships, although a great many of the school sections were sold to raise money for public education. In later States, section 36 of each township was also designated as a &quot;school section&quot;.

The Point of Beginning for the 1785 survey was where Ohio (as the easternmost part of the Northwest Territory), Pennsylvania and Virginia (now West Virginia) met, on the north shore of the Ohio River near East Liverpool, Ohio. There is a historical marker just north of the site, at the state line where Ohio State Route 39 becomes Pennsylvania Route 68.



==History==
The Confederation Congress appointed a committee consisting of the following men:

* Thomas Jefferson (Virginia)
* Hugh Williamson (North Carolina)
* David Howell (Rhode Island)
* Elbridge Gerry (Massachusetts)
* Jacob Read (South Carolina)

On May 7, 1784, the people reported &quot;An ordinance for ascertaining the mode of locating and disposing of lands in the western territories, and for other purposes therein mentioned.&quot; The ordinance required the land be divided into &quot;hundreds of ten geographical miles square, each mile containing 6086 and 4-10ths of a foot&quot; and &quot;sub-divided into lots of one mile square each, or 850 and 4-10ths of an acre&quot;, numbered starting in the northwest corner, proceeding from west to east, and east to west, consecutively. After debate and amendment, the ordinance was reported to Congress April 26, 1785. It required surveyors &quot;to divide the said territory into townships seven miles square, by lines running due north and south, and others crossing these at right angles. — The plats of the townships, respectively, shall be marked into sections of one mile square, or 640 acres.&quot; This is the first recorded use of the terms &quot;township&quot; and &quot;section.&quot;

On May 3, 1785, William Grayson of Virginia made a motion seconded by James Monroe to change &quot;seven miles square&quot; to &quot;six miles square.&quot; The ordinance was passed on May 20, 1785. The sections were to be numbered starting at 1 in the southeast and running south to north in each tier to 36 in the northwest. The surveys were to be performed under the direction of the Geographer of the United States (Thomas Hutchins). The Seven Ranges, the privately surveyed Symmes Purchase, and, with some modification, the privately surveyed Ohio Company of Associates, all of the Ohio Lands were the surveys completed with this section numbering.
The Act of May 18, 1796, provided for the appointment of a surveyor-general to replace the office of Geographer of the United States, and that &quot;sections shall be numbered, respectively, beginning with number one in the northeast section, and proceeding west and east alternately, through the township, with progressive numbers till the thirty-sixth be completed.&quot; All subsequent surveys were completed with this boustrophedonical section numbering system, except the United States Military District of the Ohio Lands which had five mile (8 km) square townships as provided by the Act of June 1, 1796, and amended by the Act of March 1, 1800.

Howe and others give Thomas Hutchins credit for conceiving the rectangular system of lots of one square mile in 1764 while a captain in the Sixtieth, or, Royal American, Regiment, and engineer to the expedition under Col. Henry Bouquet to the forks of the Muskingum, in what is now Coshocton County, Ohio. It formed part of his plan for military colonies north of the Ohio, as a protection against Indians. The law of 1785 embraced most of the new system. Treat, on the other hand, notes that tiers of townships were familiar in New England, and insisted on by the New England legislators.

==Public education==
Support for public schooling was established in the Land Ordinance through &quot;school lands&quot; which granted Section 16 (one square mile) of every township to be used for public education: &quot;There shall be reserved the Lot No. 16, of every township, for the maintenance of public schools within said township.&quot; Section 16 was located near the center of the township. (For states surveyed under the federal rectangular system, survey townships and civil townships usually have the same boundaries, but there are many exceptions.) Section 36 was also subsequently added as a school section in western states. The various states and counties ignored, altered or amended this provision in their own ways, but the general (intended) effect was a guarantee that local schools would have an income and that the community schoolhouses would be centrally located for all children.

The School Lands are part of the Ohio Lands, comprising land grants in Ohio from the United States federal government for public schools. According to the &quot;Official Ohio Lands Book&quot;, &quot;by 1920, 73,155,075 acres of public land had been given by the federal government to the public land states in support of public schooling.&quot;

In the Land Ordinance of 1785 provision was also made by land grant for higher education (the College Lands).

==Layout of townships==
Each western township contained thirty-six square miles of land, planned as a square measuring six miles on each side, which was further subdivided into thirty-six lots, each lot containing one square mile of land. The mathematical precision of the planning was the concerted effort of surveyors. Each township contained dedicated space for public education and other government uses, as five of the thirty-six lots were reserved for government or public purposes. The thirty-six lots of each township were numbered accordingly on each township&#x27;s survey. The centermost land of each township corresponded to lot numbers 15, 16, 21 and 22 on the township survey, with lot number 16 dedicated specifically to public education. As the Land Ordinance of 1785 stated: &quot;There shall be reserved the lot No. 16, of every township, for the maintenance of public schools within the said township.&quot;

Knepper notes: &quot;Sections number 8, 11, 26, and 29 in every township were reserved for future sale by the federal government when, it was hoped, they would bring higher prices because of developed land around them. Congress also reserved one third part of all gold, silver, lead, and copper mines to its own use, a bit of wishful thinking as regards Ohio lands.&quot; The ordinance also said &quot;That three townships adjacent to Lake Erie be reserved, to be hereafter disposed of by Congress, for the use of the officers, men, and others, refugees from Canada, and the refugees from Nova Scotia, who are or may be entitled to grants of land under resolutions of Congress now existing.&quot; This was not possible, as the area next to Lake Erie was property of Connecticut, so the Canadians had to wait until the establishment of the Refugee Tract in 1798.

The ordinance determined that some townships should be sold entire, and other townships should be sold by lots. It was specified that this would be done in such a way that all townships contiguous to one sold entire would be sold by lots, and vice versa. The same applied to the fractional parts of the townships.

==Influence==
Many historians recognize the influences of the colonial experience in the land ordinances of the 1780s. The committees that formulated these ordinances were inspired by the individual colonial experiences of the states that they represented. The committees attempted to implement the best practices of such states to solve the task at hand. The surveyed townships of the Land Ordinance of 1785, writes historian Jonathan Hughes, &quot;represented an amalgam of the colonial experience and ideals.&quot; Two geographically and ideologically distinct colonial land systems were competing at such time in history – the New England system and the Southern system. While the primary influence on the Land Ordinance of 1785 was the New England land system of the colonial era, marked by its emphasis on community development and systematic planning, the exceedingly individualistic Southern land system also played a role.

Even though Jefferson&#x27;s committee had a Southern majority, it recommended the New England survey system. The highly planned and surveyed western townships established in the Land Ordinance of 1785, were heavily influenced by the New England settlements of the colonial era, particularly the land grant provisions of the Ordinances which dedicated land towards public education and other government uses. In colonial times, New England settlements contained dedicated public space for schools and churches, which often held a central role in the community. For instance, the 1751 royal charter for Marlboro Vermont provides: &quot;one Shear [share] for the First Settled Minister one Shear for the benefit of the School forever.&quot; By the time the Land Ordinance of 1785 was enacted, the New England states had used land grants for over a century to support public education and build new schools. The clause in the Land Ordinance of 1785 which dedicated &quot;Lot Number 16&quot; of each western township for public education reflected this regional New England experience.

In addition, the use of surveyors to precisely chart out the new townships in the westward expansion was directly influenced by the New England land system, which similarly relied on surveyors and local committees to clearly delineate property boundaries. Defined property boundary lines and an established land title system, provided colonials with a sense of security in their land ownership, by minimizing the likelihood of ownership or boundary disputes. This was an important consideration in the Land Ordinance of 1785. One of the primary purposes of the Ordinance was to raise funds for the increasingly insolvent government. Providing land speculators security in their purchases encouraged additional demand for the western lands. In addition, the organized and communal nature of the western settlements, allowed the government to reserve a number of well-defined plots of land for future government development. Since the rest of the township would have been developed by the time the government decided to develop such reserved lands, there was an already built-in assurance of land value appreciation for the reserved lands. This had the effect of increasing the value of government assets without much further investment by the government.

The New England land system, while the primary influence on the great land ordinances of the 1780s, was not the only land system influence. The Southern land system, marked by individualism and personal initiative, also helped shape the ordinance. While the New England land system was premised on community-based development, the Southern land system was premised on individual frontiersman appropriating undeveloped land to call their own. The Southern pioneer claimed property and the local surveyor would demarcate it for him. The system did not protect people from competing claims or set up an orderly chain of title. The process was called &#x27;indiscriminate location&quot;. This system encouraged individuals to amass large plantations instead of settling into dense communal development. This system was supported by the use of slave labor. Perhaps the committee&#x27;s resistance against indiscriminate location and support for limited and disciplined land settlement was an implicit attempt to create a structural barrier to developing a plantation economy that was dependent on slave labor. The committee could have been attempting to effectively eradicate slavery in the West after Jefferson failed to outlaw it in the Land Ordinance of 1784.

While the Land Ordinance of 1785 created a New England style land system, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 determined how the townships would be administered. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787, like the Land Ordinance of 1785, was inspired by the New England colonial settlements, and manifested this influence by further encouraging the worship of religion and the spread of education. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 stated, &quot;Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.&quot; However, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also contained Southern characteristics of municipal governance. The Southern influence can be felt in the Western townships in that once the federal land was dedicated to the particular township, the township was relatively free of the influence of the federal government, and the local municipality was left to govern itself. This manifested itself in public education as well. Once the land was dedicated, the actual development of the public schools was the responsibility of the local township or the particular state. Although the great Ordinances of the 1780s set the framework for a national system of schools by dedicating land across the West, the devolved development and administration by the state and local government led to unique results.

Retaining central land in each township ensured that these lands would create value for the federal government and the safety of the people. Instead of disbursing funds to the new states to create public education systems, dedicating a central lot in each township provided the new townships with the means to develop educational institutions without any transfer of funds. This was a practical and necessary way to achieve the committee&#x27;s goal in a pre-Constitution America. Aside from raising funds for a financially struggling government, the westward expansion outlined in the Land Ordinances of the 1780s also provided a framework for spreading democratic ideals. Jefferson proposed an article in the Ordinance that would have outlawed slavery in the new states after the year 1800. However he could not amass enough votes to pass the anti-slavery article. Later Jefferson did succeed, however, in ensuring public funding of education by dedicating land to education in the Land Ordinance of 1785. Public education was an ideal already developed in the New England colonial settlements. New Englanders provided for public education in their land grants due to a belief that public education could be used to further unite the young nation and spread democratic ideals.

The systematic and highly organized westward settlements, with their local governments and central square dedicated towards public education, were a concerted effort to inspire civic duty and participation in the democratic process. Usher relates this initiative to &quot;the Supreme Court in Cooper v. Roberts (1855), &#x27;plant in the heart of every community the same sentiments of grateful reverence for the wisdom, forecast, and magnanimous statesmanship of those who framed the institutions of these new States.&quot; The westward expansion therefore was not only a tool for raising much needed funds, but also a tool in a grand socializing experiment to inoculate the settlers to democratic ideals. The hope was that the unique planning of each township with a public school centrally located, coupled with the obligation of each township&#x27;s local citizens to take part in the civic process of governing the township, teaching and building the schools, and maintaining order, would instill the democratic ideals crucial to the nation&#x27;s success.

==Criticism==
The economist Murray Rothbard wrote a critical review of George B. DeHuszar and Thomas Hulbert Stevenson, &#x27; &quot;A History of the American Republic, 2 vols&quot; &#x27; in which he states that the authors failed to realise that the handing over of western lands to the federal government resulted in huge unearned property to the federal government&#x27;s unearned &quot;public domain&quot;:
The Ordinance of 1785 was a dictatorial intrusion into the western region, which set too high a minimum land sale and price, thus restricting settlement, and also enforced rectangular surveying, thus forcing the purchase of submarginal land within an otherwise good “rectangle,” instead of conforming, as in the Southern methods of surveying, to the natural topography of the land in question. In colonial days, unowned land was free to all settlers, and this represented a sharp change in the direction of étatist restriction of land settlement and increasing government revenue from land. DeHuszar shows no sign of realizing this significance of the ordinance. Furthermore, the Ordinance of 1785 foisted public schools upon each township in the region, thus taking the first step toward public schools and toward federal dictation over education. None of this seems to impress DeHuszar or dampen his enthusiasm for the ordinance.

<text>Aerodramus is a genus of small, dark, cave-nesting birds in the Collocaliini tribe of the swift family. Its members are confined to tropical and subtropical regions in southern Asia, Oceania and northeastern Australia. Many of its members were formerly classified in &quot;Collocalia&quot;, but were first placed in a separate genus by American ornithologist Harry Church Oberholser in 1906.

This is a taxonomically difficult group of very similar species. Echolocation, DNA sequencing and parasitic lice have all been used to establish relationships, but some problems, such as the placement of the Papuan swiftlet are not fully resolved. These swiftlets can pose major identification problems where several species occur.

What distinguishes &quot;Aerodramus&quot; swiftlets from other swifts, and indeed almost all other birds, is their ability to use a simple but effective form of echolocation. This enables them to navigate within the breeding and roosting caves.

The nests of &quot;Aerodramus&quot; swiftlets are constructed with saliva as a major component. In two species, saliva is the only material used, and the nests are collected for the famous Chinese delicacy &#x27;bird&#x27;s nest soup&#x27;, the over-collection of which puts pressure on the swiftlet populations.

==Distribution==
The range of these swiftlets is confined to tropical southern Asia, Oceania, northeastern Australia and the Indian Ocean, with the greatest diversity in Southeast Asia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Several of the species are restricted to small islands, and their limited range can make them vulnerable, like the Seychelles, Whitehead&#x27;s and Guam swiftlets. The Mangaia swiftlet is a recently extinct species known only from fossils.

==Description==

&quot;Aerodramus&quot; swiftlets are in many respects typical swifts, having narrow wings for fast flight, and a wide gape and small reduced beak surrounded by bristles for catching insects in flight. They have dull plumage which is mainly in shades of black, brown, and grey. Members of this genus typically have dark brown upper wings and upper body, sometimes with a paler rump, light brown underparts, a paler throat, and brownish-white under-wings with dark brown &quot;armpits&quot;. Males and female plumages are similar in appearance, as is that of the juvenile, for those species for which it has been described; in some species the juvenile shows pale fringes to the flight feathers.

The legs, as with many swifts, are very short, preventing the birds from perching, but allowing them to cling to vertical surfaces. The flight is mainly gliding due to very long primary feathers and small breast muscles. &quot;Aerodramus&quot; swiftlets, depending on species, weigh 8–35 grammes (0.28–1.23 oz) and are 9–16 centimetres (0.28–1.23 in) long. These swiftlets are very similar, and where several species occur, such as Borneo, New Guinea and the Philippines, may not be separable in the field.

==Behaviour==

&quot;Aerodramus&quot; swiftlets are aerial insectivores, which take prey like flies on the wing. They roost and breed in caves; during the day they leave the caves to forage for food, and return to roost at night. They are monogamous and both partners take part in caring for the nestlings. Males perform aerial displays to attract females and mating occurs at the nest. The breeding season overlaps the wet season, which corresponds to an increased insect population.

Clutch size depends on the location and the food source, but generally &quot;Aerodramus&quot; swiftlets lay one or two eggs. The eggs are a dull white, and are laid every other day. Many, if not all, species are colonial nesters; some build their nests in high, dark corners on cave walls.

Most &quot;Aerodramus&quot; swiftlets live in the tropical Indo-Pacific region and do not migrate. These birds usually remain in one cave or other roosting/nesting site. Examples of cave sites include the Niah Caves and Gunung Mulu National Park, which are both located in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo.

Characteristics of behaviour, such as what materials apart from saliva the nests contain, can be used to differentiate between certain species of &quot;Aerodramus&quot;.

==Echolocation==

The genus &quot;Aerodramus&quot; is of special interest due to its use of echolocation. The swiftlets use this technique to navigate in darkness through the chasms and shafts of the caves where they breed and roost at night. Apart from swiftlets, the only other avian species to use echolocation is the unrelated oilbird.

The &quot;Aerodramus&quot; swiftlets&#x27; echolocating double clicks are within the normal human hearing range and up to 3 milliseconds apart, with the interval becoming shorter in darker locations. Unlike the rest of the genus (for those species which have been studied), the Atiu swiftlet, &quot;Aerodramus sawtelli&quot;, and the black-nest swiftlet, &quot;A. maximus&quot;, emit only single clicks. The former species also uses echolocation outside its caves.

The use of echolocation was once used to separate &quot;Aerodramus&quot; from the other non-echolocating cave swiftlet genera &quot;Collocalia&quot; and &quot;Hydrochous&quot; (virtually nothing is known about &quot;Schoutedenapus&quot;). However, recently, the pygmy swiftlet, &quot;Collocalia troglodytes&quot;, was discovered making similar clicking noises both inside and outside its roosting cave.

It has recently been determined that the echolocation vocalizations do not agree with evolutionary relationship between swiftlet species as suggested by DNA sequence comparison. This suggests that as in bats, echolocation sounds, once present, adapt rapidly and independently to the particular species&#x27; acoustic environment.

A study suggested that the echolocation subunits were mainly located in the central nervous system, while the subunits in the vocal apparatus were already present and capable of use before echolocation even evolved. This study supports the hypothesis of independent evolution of echolocation in &quot;Aerodramus&quot; and &quot;Collocalia&quot;, with the subsequent evolution of complex behaviour needed to complement the physical echolocation system, or just possibly that the vocal apparatus-parts of the echolocation system might even be inherited from some prehistoric nocturnal ancestor.

It has been suggested that the giant or waterfall swiftlet, &quot;Hydrochous gigas&quot;, which cannot echolocate, may be descended from an echolocating ancestor.

==Saliva nests==

The intricately constructed saliva nests of this swiftlet genus, which in some species contain no other material, are collected to make the delicacy bird&#x27;s nest soup. They therefore command extremely high prices.

Authentic bird&#x27;s nest soup is made from the nests of the edible-nest swiftlet (or white-nest swiftlet), &quot;Aerodramus fuciphagus&quot;, and the black-nest swiftlet, &quot;Aerodramus maximus&quot;. Instead of incorporating twigs, feathers and straw like others in the genus, these two swiftlets make their nest only from strands of their gummy saliva, which harden when exposed to air. Once the nests are harvested, they are cleaned and sold to restaurants. Over the past twenty years, the high demand for the nests of these &quot;Aerodramus&quot; species has had an adverse effect on their populations. The Niah caves population of black-nest swiftlets plunged from around 1.5 million pairs in 1959 to 150,000–298,000 pairs in the early 1990s through over-harvesting.

Early authors had doubts about the material used to make the nest, with whale and fish sperm and sea foam being proposed as the basis for construction. Even in the 1830s, when the use of saliva had been fairly well established, it was believed that it was only a cement to bind a sea plant which provided the bulk of the gelatinous material of the nest.

==Lice==
As with other taxonomically difficult groups, ectoparasites can give information on relationships. A study of swiftlet parasites in northern Borneo involved transferring lice between closely related swiftlet species. The survival of lice in most of these transfers was significantly reduced in proportion to the mean difference in feather barb size between the donor and recipient species of hosts. Thus, adaptation to a particular resource on the body of the host appears to govern the specificity of swiftlet lice. In transfers where lice survived, the lice moved to different areas on the body of the host where the mean barb diameter of the feathers on which the lice occurred had the required value.

==Papuan swiftlet==
The Papuan swiftlet, &quot;Aerodramus papuensis&quot;, has three toes instead of the usual four in this group. It has the ability to echolocate, but whereas other previously studied species use echolocation primarily while flying in their caves, the Papuan swiftlet appears to be nocturnal or crepuscular and uses echolocation while active outside at night. It uses single, not double, clicks. DNA sequence data provides strong support for a basal relationship between &quot;A. papuensis&quot; and other &quot;Aerodramus&quot; taxa and suggest that this species and the waterfall swift &quot;Hydrochous gigas&quot;, are sister taxa, a relationship that would indicate paraphyly of the genus &quot;Aerodramus&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Aerodramus&quot; was introduced (as a subgenus of &quot;Collocalia&quot;) in 1906 by the American ornithologist Harry C. Oberholser. He designated the type species as &quot;Collocalia innominata&quot; Hume. This taxon is now considered as a subspecies of the Himalayan swiftlet (&quot;Aerodramus brevirostris&quot;). The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;aēr&quot; meaning &quot;air&quot; with &quot;-dromos&quot; meaning &quot;-racer&quot; (from &quot;trekhō&quot; &quot;to run&quot;).

The genus now contains 25 species:
* Seychelles swiftlet, &quot;Aerodramus elaphrus&quot;
* Mascarene swiftlet, &quot;Aerodramus francicus&quot;

<doc id="490508" wikidata="Q141690" url="?curid=490508" title="Back Bay, Boston">
<text>Back Bay is an officially recognized neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, built on reclaimed land in the Charles River basin. Construction began in 1859, as the demand for luxury housing exceeded the availability in the city at the time, and the area was fully built by around 1900. It is most famous for its rows of Victorian brownstone homes—considered one of the best preserved examples of 19th-century urban design in the United States—as well as numerous architecturally significant individual buildings, and cultural institutions such as the Boston Public Library, and Boston Architectural College. Initially conceived as a residential-only area, commercial buildings were permitted from around 1890, and Back Bay now features many office buildings, including the John Hancock Tower, Boston&#x27;s tallest skyscraper. It is also considered a fashionable shopping destination (especially Newbury and Boylston Streets, and the adjacent Prudential Center and Copley Place malls) and home to several major hotels.

The Neighborhood Association of the Back Bay considers the neighborhood&#x27;s bounds to be &quot;Charles River on the North; Arlington Street to Park Square on the East; Columbus Avenue to the New York New Haven and Hartford right-of-way (South of Stuart Street and Copley Place), Huntington Avenue, Dalton Street, and the Massachusetts Turnpike on the South; Charlesgate East on the West.&quot;

== History ==
Before its transformation into buildable land by a 19th-century filling project, the Back Bay was a bay, west of the Shawmut Peninsula (on the far side from Boston Harbor) between Boston and Cambridge, the Charles River entering from the west. This bay was tidal: the water rose and fell several feet over the course of each day, and at low tide much of the bay&#x27;s bed was exposed as a marshy flat.
As early as 5,200 years before present, Native Americans built fish weirs here, evidence of which was discovered during subway construction in 1913 (&quot;see&quot; Ancient Fishweir Project and Boylston Street Fishweir).

In 1814, the Boston and Roxbury Mill Corporation was chartered to construct a milldam, which would also serve as a toll road connecting Boston to Watertown, bypassing Boston Neck. The dam prevented the natural tides from flushing sewage out to sea, creating severe sanitary and odor problems. With costs higher and power lower than expected, in the end, the project was an economic failure, and in 1857 a massive project was begun to &quot;make land&quot; by filling the area enclosed by the dam.

The firm of Goss and Munson extended railroad lines to quarries in Needham, Massachusetts, away; a 35-car train carrying gravel and other fill arrived every 45 minutes, day and night. When the Needham gravel pits were exhausted, additional fill was found in Canton, Dedham, Hyde Park, and Westwood. William Dean Howells recalled &quot;the beginnings of Commonwealth Avenue, and the other streets of the Back Bay, laid out with their basements left hollowed in the made land, which the gravel trains were yet making out of the westward hills.&quot;

Present-day Back Bay itself was filled by 1882; the project reached existing land at what is now Kenmore Square in 1890, and finished in the Fens in 1900. Much of the old mill dam remains buried under present-day Beacon Street. The project was the largest of a number of land reclamation projects which, beginning in 1820, more than doubled the size of the original Shawmut Peninsula.

Completion of the Charles River Dam in 1910 converted the former Charles estuary into a freshwater basin; the Charles River Esplanade was constructed to allow residents to enjoy the view of the new lagoon. The Esplanade has since undergone several changes, including the construction of Storrow Drive.

== Roads ==
The Back Bay is traversed by five east–west corridors: Beacon Street, Marlborough Street, Commonwealth Avenue, Newbury Street and Boylston Street. These are interrupted at regular intervals by northsouth streets named alphabetically: Arlington (along the western border of the Boston Public Garden), Berkeley, Clarendon, Dartmouth, Exeter, Fairfield, Gloucester and Hereford Streets. All of the west–east streets, except Commonwealth Avenue, are one-way streets.

In the 1960s, the &quot;High Spine&quot; design plan, in conjunction with development plans, gave way to the construction of high-rise buildings along the Massachusetts Turnpike, which in turn allowed the development of major projects in the area.

== Architecture ==
=== Building guidelines ===
The plan of Back Bay, by Arthur Gilman of the firm Gridley James Fox Bryant, was greatly influenced by Haussmann&#x27;s renovation of Paris. It featured wide, parallel, tree-lined avenues unlike anything seen in other Boston neighborhoods. Five east–west corridors—Beacon Street (closest to the Charles), Marlborough Street, Commonwealth Avenue (actually two one-way thoroughfares flanking the tree-lined pedestrian Commonwealth Avenue Mall), Newbury Street and Boylston Street—are intersected at regular intervals by north–south cross streets: Arlington (along the western edge of the Public Garden), Berkeley, Clarendon, Dartmouth, Exeter, Fairfield, Gloucester, and Hereford. An 1874 guidebook noted the trisyllabic-disyllabic alternation of that alphabetic sequence; the series continues in the adjacent Fenway neighborhood with Ipswich, Jersey, and Kilmarnock Streets. West of Hereford are Massachusetts Avenue (a regional thoroughfare crossing the Harvard Bridge to Cambridge and far beyond) and Charlesgate, which forms the Back Bay&#x27;s western boundary.

Setback requirements and other restrictions, written into the lot deeds of the newly filled Back Bay, produced harmonious rows of dignified three- to five-story residential brownstones (though most along Newbury Street are now in commercial or mixed use). The Back Bay is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is considered one of the best-preserved examples of 19th-century urban architecture in the United States. In 1966, the Massachusetts Legislature, &quot;to safeguard the heritage of the city of Boston by preventing the despoliation&quot; of the Back Bay, created the Back Bay Architectural District to regulate exterior changes to Back Bay buildings.

Since the 1960s, the concept of a High Spine has influenced large-project development in Boston, reinforced by zoning rules permitting high-rise construction along the axis of the Massachusetts Turnpike, including air rights siting of buildings.

=== Buildings around Copley Square ===

Copley Square features Trinity Church, the Boston Public Library, the John Hancock Tower, and numerous other notable buildings.

* Trinity Church (1872–1877, H.H. Richardson), &quot;deservedly regarded as one of the finest buildings in America.&quot;
* The first monumental structure in Copley Square was the original Museum of Fine Arts, begun 1870 and opened 1876. After the museum moved to the Fenway neighborhood in 1909 its red Gothic Revival building was demolished to make way for the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel (1912–present).
* The Boston Public Library (1888–1892), designed by McKim, Mead, and White, is a leading example of Beaux-Arts architecture in the US. Sited across Copley Square from Trinity Church, it was intended to be &quot;a palace for the people.&quot; Baedeker&#x27;s 1893 guide terms it &quot;dignified and imposing, simple and scholarly,&quot; and &quot;a worthy mate... to Trinity Church.&quot; At that time, its 600,000 volumes made it the largest free public library in the world.
* The Old South Church, also called the New Old South Church (645 Boylston Street on Copley Square), 1872–75, is located across the street from the Boston Public Library. It was designed by the Boston architectural firm of Cummings and Sears in the Venetian Gothic style. The style follows the precepts of the British cultural theorist and architectural critic John Ruskin (1819–1900) as outlined in his treatise &quot;The Stones of Venice&quot;. Old South Church remains a significant example of Ruskin&#x27;s influence on architecture in the US. Charles Amos Cummings and Willard T. Sears also designed the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.
* There were at various times three different &quot;Hancock buildings&quot; in the Back Bay, culminating in a skyscraper flanking Trinity Church:
** The Stephen L. Brown Building (Parker, Thomas &amp; Rice, 1922) was the first of the three Hancock buildings:
** The Old John Hancock Building (Cram and Ferguson, 1947) was the tallest building in Back Bay until construction of the Prudential Tower. (Sometimes called the Berkeley Building, though not to be confused with the actual Berkeley Building, &quot;below&quot;.)
** The John Hancock Tower (I. M. Pei, 1972), New England&#x27;s tallest building at 60 stories, is a dark-blue reflective glass tower with a footprint in the form of a narrow parallelogram. Admirers assert that it does not diminish the impact of Trinity Church; a critic said it &quot;may be nihilistic, overbearing, even elegantly rude, but it&#x27;s not dull.&quot;

=== Other prominent buildings ===
* The 52-story Prudential Tower, thought to be a marvel in 1964, is now considered ugly by some critics. Although the Prudential Tower has garnered scant architectural acclaim, the Prudential Center overall was awarded the Urban Land Institute&#x27;s &quot;Award for Best Mixed Use Property&quot; in 2006.
* 111 Huntington Avenue (2002), a 36-story tower south of the Prudential Center, is Boston&#x27;s eighth-tallest building. The building is crowned by an open dome frame and an enclosed &quot;Wintergarden&quot;, and features a fully landscaped South Garden. It was nominated for the 2002 Emporis Skyscraper Award, and received third place &quot;bronze&quot;.
* Arlington Street Church (Arthur Gilman, 1861), inspired by London&#x27;s St Martin-in-the-Fields, was the first church built in the newly filled Back Bay. (Architect Gilman also designed Back Bay&#x27;s grid-style street plan.)
* Berkeley Building (Constant-Désiré Despradelle, 1905) features a white terra cotta Beaux-Arts architecture facade on a steel frame. 
*Boston Park Plaza (George B. Post, 1927), a prototype of the grand American hotel, it was the first hotel in the world to offer in-room radio in every room.
* Church of the Covenant (Richard M. Upjohn, 1865–1867) is a Presbyterian church of Roxbury puddingstone in Gothic Revival style, which its designer intended as &quot;a high gothic edifice ... which no ordinary dwelling house would overtop.&quot;
* The Colonnade Hotel (1971), with its row of columns, delineates the &quot;back side&quot; of the Prudential Center complex. 
* The First Church of Christ, Scientist (1894; extended 1904), the centerpiece of the Christian Science Plaza, which also features a reflecting pool.
* The Gibson House (1860), preserved very much as it was in the 19th century, is now a museum.
* The Mary Baker Eddy Library and Mapparium museum and Library
* The New England Life Building (now called the Newbry Building) occupies the site of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s first home, the Rogers Building (1866–1939) by William G. Preston. On the same block (and also by Preston) is the original home of Boston Society of Natural History; the Society is now Boston&#x27;s Museum of Science—located elsewhere—but the building remains, now in retail use.
* The Saint Clement Eucharistic Shrine (Arthur F. Gray, 1922), today a Roman Catholic church, was originally built for the Second Universalist Society.

== Cultural and educational institutions ==

Prominent cultural and educational institutions in the Back Bay include:
*Alliance française, on Marlborough Street
*Berklee College of Music, which occupies a number of older and newly built Back Bay buildings
*Boston Architectural College, the oldest independent architecture school in the US 
*Boston Conservatory, with buildings on Hemenway Street and The Fenway
*Goethe Institute, on Newbury Street
*New England College of Optometry, the oldest optometry school in the US, located on Beacon Street
*New England Conservatory, on Huntington Avenue
*New England Historic Genealogical Society, whose archive and research center is at 99 Newbury Street

== Parkland ==

* The Back Bay Fens is a large picturesque park on Back Bay&#x27;s south edge that forms part of Boston&#x27;s Emerald Necklace.
* The Charles River Reservation runs between Storrow Drive and the Charles River at Back Bay&#x27;s northern border.
* Commonwealth Avenue, which runs through the center of Back Bay, has a large center mall.
* Copley Square, named for painter John Singleton Copley, is a public square in southeast Back Bay.
== Transportation ==
Back Bay is served by the Green Line&#x27;s Arlington, Copley, Hynes Convention Center, and Prudential stations, and the Orange Line&#x27;s Back Bay station (which is also an MBTA Commuter Rail and Amtrak station).

<text>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston, Massachusetts is a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School and one of the founding members of Beth Israel Lahey Health. It was formed out of the 1996 merger of Beth Israel Hospital (founded in 1916 by the Jewish community) and New England Deaconess Hospital (founded in 1896 by Methodist deaconesses). Among independent teaching hospitals, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center has ranked in the top three recipients of biomedical research funding from the National Institutes of Health. Research funding totals nearly $200 million annually. BIDMC researchers run more than 850 active sponsored projects and 200 clinical trials. The Harvard-Thorndike General Clinical Research Center, the oldest clinical research laboratory in the United States, has been located on this site since 1973.

==Overview==
BIDMC is one of the largest hospitals in New England, is affiliated with Joslin Diabetes Center and is a research partner of Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, the largest cancer institution in the country. The hospital is part of the Boston MedFlight consortium and supports a Level I trauma center through the use of its rooftop helipad.

Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center has affiliates in the Boston-area towns of Needham, Milton, Plymouth, Chestnut Hill, Chelsea and Lexington, as well as through numerous primary care practices and community health centers.

BIDMC is the official hospital of the Boston Red Sox. Under the 32-year leadership of Mitchell T. Rabkin, it was the first hospital in the nation to create and adopt a Patient Bill of Rights.

Peter J. Healy joined Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center as president in 2017.

==History==
New England Deaconess Hospital was founded In 1896 by Methodist deaconesses to care for Boston&#x27;s residents. The revival of the office of the Christian deaconess, which started in Germany in 1836, was spurred by a group of Christian women dedicating themselves to the care of the sick and the poor. The first 14-bed infirmary was opened in a converted five-story brownstone at 691 Massachusetts Avenue. Although the hospital was originally staffed by the Deaconesses, in 1922 it added a permanent medical and surgical staff. In 1927, the New England Deaconess Association opened the Palmer Memorial Hospital, a cancer treatment facility. During the 1960s, Deaconess&#x27; residency programs gained accreditation and it affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Deaconess had a leading role in the early studies of the cause, course and treatment of AIDS. Deaconess was also a pioneer in organ transplantation and immunological research.

During an era of religious separatism and anti-Semitism, Boston&#x27;s Jewish community founded Beth Israel Hospital in 1916 to meet the needs of the growing Jewish immigrant population. Its first hospital on Townsend Street in Roxbury held 45 beds. The new hospital addressed the needs of immigrants who spoke Yiddish without speaking English and for patients who kept a kosher diet. In 1928, Beth Israel established relationships with Tufts University and the Harvard Medical School and relocated to a new facility in the Longwood area of Boston. During the Depression, Beth Israel was one of only two hospitals in Boston that treated welfare recipients. Researchers at Beth Israel discovered vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in 1983.

The two neighboring hospitals merged in 1996, continuing the patient care, educational and research components of both predecessors. In 2003, BIDMC researchers identified the source of preeclampsia, a life-threatening complication of pregnancy.

In January 2014, Jordan Hospital joined the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center family of hospitals and became Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital-Plymouth. It was founded in 1899 when a group of leading citizens from Plymouth saw a need to build a hospital to serve residents and pursued the idea of &quot;a hospital on the hill&quot;. They approached retail tycoon, philanthropist, and summer resident Eben Jordan of the Jordan Marsh &amp; Company who donated $20,000 to build was to become Jordan Hospital. In December 1903, Jordan Hospital opened its doors to the first patients and has remained a community hospital ever since. It remains a private, not-for-profit hospital serving the communities of Bourne, Carver, Duxbury, Halifax, Kingston, Lakeville, Pembroke, Plympton, Plymouth, Marshfield, Middleboro, Sandwich and Wareham.

===Boston Marathon Bombing===
BIDMC received and cared for 21 victims of the Boston Marathon bombing, as well as receiving Dzhokhar Tsarnaev after he was arrested by police. Of the 21 victims received, 17 had serious injuries and seven required emergency surgery. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was also brought to BIDMC where attempts were made to resuscitate him, and where he was ultimately pronounced dead.

===Merger with Lahey Hospital &amp; Medical Center===
In January 2017, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported of a letter of intent for a merger between Beth Israel Deaconess and Lahey Hospital &amp; Medical Center with this partnership creating the largest hospital merger in more than 20 years. The combined system would be counteraction to Partners HealthCare, Massachusetts&#x27; largest network of hospitals and doctors with a market share of 22% in the eastern part of the state.

In December 2017, a group called the Make Healthcare Affordable Coalition came out in opposition to the proposed merger of Lahey Health and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center stating that the &quot;mega merger&quot; would lead to higher costs and the closing of health clinics serving minority communities.

In March 2019, Beth Israel Lahey Health was formed by the merger of Lahey Health and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Beth Israel Lahey Health is composed of Addison Gilbert Hospital, Anna Jaques Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital—Milton, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital—Needham, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital—Plymouth, Beverly Hospital, Lahey Hospital &amp; Medical Center, Lahey Medical Center-Peabody, Mount Auburn Hospital, New England Baptist Hospital, and Winchester Hospital.

===Partnership With Dana-Farber===

In September 2023, the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute announced a new partnership with BIDMC and plans to build a new standalone hospital focused on treating adult cancer patients. This includes a departure from their current home and longtime affiliation with Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital, which had been recognized among U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s top cancer care facilities for 23 consecutive years.

==Structure==
Since the Beth Israel–Deaconess merger, the hospital has consisted of two campuses, the East (former Beth Israel) and the West (former Deaconess). The East Campus retained most primary care, outpatient, clinical and administrative functions, while the emergency department, inpatient care, the department of human resources, and many specialists are located on the West Campus. The medical center has more than 6,000 full-time employees.

The merger coincided with the completion of the ten-story Clinical Center, located at the corner of Brookline and Longwood Avenues, in space formerly occupied by the Massachusetts College of Art. The Clinical Center houses most of the hospital&#x27;s outpatient services. The East Campus is located at 330 Brookline Avenue in the Longwood Medical Area.

The nation&#x27;s oldest clinical research laboratory, the Harvard–Thorndike Laboratory, has been at this site since 1973.

The West Campus is nearly diagonally across the street, at 1 Deaconess Road. A number of other non-clinical, administrative offices (e.g. payroll, accounts payable, telecommunications) are located offsite in offices scattered throughout the area.

==Major affiliates==

==In popular culture==
A stylized version of Beth Israel Hospital serves as the setting for the novel &quot;The House of God&quot;, a satirical account of one physician&#x27;s training in the Harvard medical system in the 1970s.

The hospital&#x27;s intensive care unit served as the basis and subject of Frederick Wiseman&#x27;s 1989 documentary &quot;Near Death&quot;. The film explores the &quot;complex interrelationships among patients, families, doctors, nurses, hospital staff, and religious advisors&quot; as they are confronted with the implications of continuing life-sustaining treatment on individual patients approaching the end of their lives. It is Wiseman&#x27;s longest documentary at a length of six hours, and is regarded as one of the longest cinematic films of all time.

<doc id="490528" wikidata="Q171477" url="?curid=490528" title="VLC media player">
<text>VLC media player (previously the VideoLAN Client and commonly known as simply VLC) is a free and open-source, portable, cross-platform media player software and streaming media server developed by the VideoLAN project. VLC is available for desktop operating systems and mobile platforms, such as Android, iOS and iPadOS. VLC is also available on digital distribution platforms such as Apple&#x27;s App Store, Google Play, and Microsoft Store.

VLC supports many audio- and video-compression-methods and file-formats, including DVD-Video, Video CD, and streaming-protocols. It is able to stream media over computer networks and can transcode multimedia files.

The default distribution of VLC includes many free decoding and encoding libraries, avoiding the need for finding/calibrating proprietary plugins. The libavcodec library from the FFmpeg project provides many of VLC&#x27;s codecs, but the player mainly uses its own muxers and demuxers. It also has its own protocol implementations. It also gained distinction as the first player to support playback of encrypted DVDs on Linux and macOS by using the libdvdcss DVD decryption library; however, this library is legally controversial and is not included in many software repositories of Linux distributions as a result. It is available on iOS under the MPLv2.

==History==
The VideoLAN software originated as a French academic project in 1996. VLC used to stand for &quot;VideoLAN Client&quot; when VLC was a client of the VideoLAN project. Since VLC is no longer merely a client, that initialism no longer applies. It was intended to consist of a client and server to stream videos from satellite dishes across a campus network. Originally developed by students at the École Centrale Paris, it is now developed by contributors worldwide and is coordinated by VideoLAN, a non-profit organization. Rewritten from scratch in 1998, it was released under GNU General Public License on February 1, 2001, with authorization from the headmaster of the École Centrale Paris. The functionality of the server-program, &quot;VideoLan Server&quot; (VLS), has mostly been subsumed into VLC and has been deprecated. The project name has been changed to &quot;VLC media player&quot; because there is no longer a client/server infrastructure.

The cone icon used in VLC is a reference to the traffic cones collected by École Centrale&#x27;s Networking Students&#x27; Association. The cone icon design was changed from a hand drawn low resolution icon to a higher resolution CGI-rendered version in 2005, illustrated by Richard Øiestad.

In 2007 the VLC project decided, for license compatibility reasons, not to upgrade to the just-released GPLv3. After 13 years of development, version 1.0.0 of VLC media player was released on July 7, 2009. Work began on VLC for Android in 2010 and it has been available for Android devices on the Google Play store since 2011. In September 2010, a company named &quot;Applidium&quot; developed a VLC port for iOS under GPLv2 with the endorsement of the VLC project, which was accepted by Apple for their App Store. In January 2011, after VLC developer Rémi Denis-Courmont&#x27;s complaint to Apple about the licensing conflict between the VLC&#x27;s GPLv2 and the App store&#x27;s policies, the VLC had been withdrawn from the Apple App Store by Apple. Subsequently, in October 2011 the VLC authors began to relicense the engine parts of VLC from the GPL-2.0-or-later to the LGPL-2.1-or-later to achieve better license compatibility, for instance with the Apple App Store. In July 2013 the VLC application could be resubmitted to the iOS App Store under the MPL-2.0. Version 2.0.0 of VLC media player was released on February 18, 2012. The version for the Windows Store was released on March 13, 2014. Support for Windows RT, Windows Phone and Xbox One were added later. VLC is the third in the sourceforge.net overall download count, and there have been more than 6 billion downloads.

Version 3.0 was in development for Windows, Linux and macOS since June 2016 and released in February 2018. It contains many new features including Chromecast output support (except subtitles), hardware-accelerated decoding enabled by default, 4K and 8K playback, 10-bit and HDR playback, 360° video and 3D audio, audio passthrough for HD audio codecs, BD-J menu support, and local network drive browsing.

In December 2017 the European Parliament approved a budget that funds a bug bounty program for VLC to improve the EU&#x27;s IT infrastructure.

===Release history===
Starting with version 1.1.0, VLC release codenames refer to characters from Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; novels; an exception is release 2.2.1, which came out shortly after Pratchett&#x27;s death on March 12, 2015, and which was codenamed &quot;Terry Pratchett&quot; in honor of the author himself.

==Design principles==
===Modular design===
VLC, like most multimedia frameworks, has a very modular design which makes it easier to include modules/plugins for new file formats, codecs, interfaces, or streaming methods. VLC 1.0.0 has more than 380 modules. The VLC core creates its own graph of modules dynamically, depending on the situation: input protocol, input file format, input codec, video card capabilities and other parameters. In VLC, almost everything is a module, like interfaces, video and audio outputs, controls, scalers, codecs, and audio/video filters.

===Interfaces===
The default GUI is based on Be API on BeOS, Cocoa for macOS, and Qt 5 for Linux and Windows, but all give a similar standard interface. The old default GUI was based on wxWidgets on Linux and Windows. VLC supports highly customizable skins through the skins2 interface, and also supports Winamp 2 and XMMS skins. Skins are not supported in the macOS version. VLC has ncurses, remote control, and telnet console interfaces. There is also an HTTP interface, as well as interfaces for mouse gestures and keyboard hotkeys.

==Features==

=== Effects (desktop version) ===
The desktop version of VLC media player has some filters that can distort, rotate, split, deinterlace, and mirror videos as well as create display walls or add a logo overlay during playback. It can also output video as ASCII art.

An interactive zoom feature allows magnifying into video during playback. Still images can be extracted from video at original resolution, and individual frames can be stepped through, although only in forward direction.

Playback can be gamified by splitting the picture inside the viewport into draggable puzzle pieces, where the row and column count can be set as desired.

For audio playback, this feature includes an equalizer and other filters that help customize sound quality.

=== Formats ===
Because VLC is a packet-based media player it plays almost all video content. Even some damaged, incomplete, or unfinished files can be played, such as those still downloading via a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. It also plays m2t MPEG transport streams (.TS) files while they are still being digitized from an HDV camera via a FireWire cable, making it possible to monitor the video as it is being recorded. The player can also use libcdio to access .iso files so that users can play files on a disk image, even if the user&#x27;s operating system cannot work directly with .iso images.

VLC supports all audio and video formats supported by libavcodec and libavformat. This means that VLC can play back H.264 or MPEG-4 Part 2 video as well as support FLV or MXF file formats &quot;out of the box&quot; using FFmpeg&#x27;s libraries. Alternatively, VLC has modules for codecs that are not based on FFmpeg&#x27;s libraries. VLC is one of the free software DVD players that ignore DVD region coding on RPC-1 firmware drives, making it a region-free player. However, it does not do the same on RPC-2 firmware drives, as in these cases the region coding is enforced by the drive itself, however, it can still brute-force the CSS encryption to play a foreign-region DVD on an RPC-2 drive.

VLC media player can play high-definition recordings of D-VHS tapes duplicated to a computer using . This offers another way to archive all D-VHS tapes with the DRM copy freely tag. Using a FireWire connection from cable boxes to computers, VLC can stream live, unencrypted content to a monitor or HDTV. VLC media player can display the playing video as the desktop wallpaper, like Windows DreamScene, by using DirectX, only available on Windows operating systems. VLC media player can record the desktop and save the stream as a file, allowing the user to create screencasts. On Microsoft Windows, VLC also supports the Direct Media Object (DMO) framework and can thus make use of some third-party DLLs (Dynamic-link library). On most platforms, VLC can tune into and view DVB-C, DVB-T, and DVB-S channels. On macOS the separate EyeTV plugin is required, on Windows it requires the card&#x27;s BDA Drivers.

VLC can be installed or run directly from a USB flash drive or other external drive. VLC can be extended through scripting; it uses the Lua scripting language. VLC can play videos in the AVCHD format, a highly compressed format used in recent HD camcorders. VLC can generate a number of music visualization displays. The program is able to convert media files into various supported formats.

Both desktop and mobile releases are equipped with an audio equalizer.

=== Christmas logo ===
A red Santa hat appears on top of VLC&#x27;s traffic-cone logo during Christmas seasons.

=== Keyboard shortcuts ===

The keyboard shortcuts are described in the VLC media player &quot;Preferences&quot;.
On a Microsoft Windows PC open the Preferences by pressing Ctrl + p. Then click on the &quot;Hotkeys&quot; menu (top right of the screen).

There are single-button shortcuts in VLC that don&#x27;t require Ctrl or Alt button.

For example, pressing keys F and G while a video file is running in VLC shifts the file&#x27;s audio/video sync for 50 millisecond per adjustment. This is useful to fix an issue with the sound being ahead or lagging behind the video.

==Operating system compatibility==
VLC media player is cross-platform, with versions for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, tvOS, ChromeOS, Windows Phone, various BSD-based systems, Solaris, BeOS, OS/2, and Syllable. However, forward and backward compatibility between versions of VLC media player and different versions of OSes are not maintained over more than a few generations. 64-bit builds are available for 64-bit Windows, starting with version 2.0.1.

===Windows 8 and 10 support===
The VLC port for Windows 8 and Windows 10 is backed by a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter to add support for a new GUI based on Microsoft&#x27;s Metro design language, that will run on the Windows Runtime. All the existing features including video filters, subtitle support, and an equalizer are present in Windows 8. A beta version of VLC for Windows 8 was released to the Microsoft Store on March 13, 2014. A universal app was created for Windows 8, 8.1, 10, Windows Phone 8, 8.1 and Windows 10 Mobile.

===Android support===

In May 2012, the VLC team stated that a version of VLC for Android was being developed. The stable release version 1.0 was made available on Google Play on December 8, 2014.

==Use of VLC with other programs==
===Bindings===
Several APIs can connect to VLC and use its functionality:

* libVLC API – the VLC Core, for C and C++
* VLCKit – an Objective-C framework for macOS
* LibVLCSharp – Crossplatform .NET bindings to libVLC (C#/F#/VB)
* JavaScript API – the evolution of ActiveX API and Firefox integration
* D-Bus controls
* Go bindings
* Python controls
* Java API
* DirectShow filters
* Delphi/Pascal API: PasLibVlc by Robert Jędrzejczyk
* Free Pascal bindings and an OOP wrapper component, via the libvlc.pp and vlc.pp units. This comes standard with the Free Pascal Compiler as of November 6, 2012.
* The Phonon multimedia API for Qt and KDE applications can optionally use VLC as a backend.

=== Applications that use libVLC ===
VLC can handle some incomplete files and in some cases can be used to preview files being downloaded. Several programs make use of this, including eMule and KCeasy. The free/open-source Internet television application Miro also uses VLC code. HandBrake, an open-source video encoder, used to load libdvdcss from VLC Media Player. Easy Subtitles Synchronizer, a freeware subtitle editing program for Windows, uses VLC to preview the video with the edited subtitles.

==Legality==
The VLC media player software installers for the macOS platform and the Windows platform include the libdvdcss DVD decryption library, even though this library may be legally restricted in certain jurisdictions.

===India===
In May 2022, it was reported by MediaNama that VLC was banned in India and its website was inaccessible from India under the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Neither the developers nor the Indian government offered any explanation to the ban, according to &quot;India Today&quot;. The official VideoLAN Twitter account stated in August that the website was blocked in India from 13 February 2022. A report by &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; indicated that the ban could be due to links with China. India had in 2020 banned over 200 Chinese apps following the 2020–2022 China–India skirmishes.

Another Hindustan Times report from April quoting Symantec said that Chinese hackers were depending on VLC to launch malware they had previously installed on Windows machines. The technique they used is called DLL side-loading, in which an external library that a legitimate program loads at runtime is substituted with a modified version containing the malware.

VideoLan president and lead developer Jean-Baptiste Kempf said that the block was most likely a result of a misunderstanding of the Chinese security issue, although the Indian Government did not provide for a reason as to why it was blocked. In October 2022, VideoLan, with assistance from the Indian digital rights organization Internet Freedom Foundation sent a legal notice to the Indian government asking for an explanation for the block order, following which the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology removed the ban in November 2022.

===United States===
The VLC media player software is able to read audio and video data from DVDs that incorporate Content Scramble System (CSS) encryption, even though the VLC media player software lacks a CSS decryption license. The unauthorized decryption of CSS-encrypted DVD content or unauthorized distribution of CSS decryption tools may violate the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

Decryption of CSS-encrypted DVD content has been temporarily authorized for certain purposes (such as documentary filmmaking that uses short portions of DVD content for criticism or commentary) under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act anticircumvention exemptions that were issued by the US Copyright Office in 2010. However, these exemptions do not change the DMCA&#x27;s ban on the distribution of CSS decryption tools; including those distributed with VLC.

<text>Kuyavia (; ), also referred to as Cuyavia, is a historical region in north-central Poland, situated on the left bank of Vistula, as well as east from Noteć River and Lake Gopło. It is divided into three traditional parts: north-western (with the capital in Bydgoszcz, ethnographically regarded often as non-Kuyavian), central (the capital in Inowrocław or Kruszwica), and south-eastern (the capital in Włocławek or Brześć Kujawski).

==Etymology==

The name Kuyavia first appeared in written sources in the 1136 Bull of Gniezno (, Latin: &quot;Ex commisso nobis&quot;) issued by Pope Innocent II, and was then mentioned in many documents from medieval times. It is also mentioned in the chronicles of Wincenty Kadłubek.

==Geography==
In the north, Kuyavia borders with the historic regions of Gdańsk Pomerania (Pomerelia) and Chełmno Land, in the west with proper (exact) Greater Poland, in the south with Łęczyca Land and in the east with Masovia and Dobrzyń Land. The borders of Kuyavia stretch out on the left bank of Vistula River: from the mouth of Skrwa Lewa in the south-east, almost to the mouth of the Wda River to the north. The borders of Kuyavia spread out to the west from Koronowo and Nakło to the Noteć River where they turn south-west, cross Trląg Lake, and on to Strzelneński Forest, reaching Skulski Lake and the upper Noteć River. The borders also enclose Brdowski Lake, Przedecz and Lubień Kujawski through the Skrwa Lewa, ending at the Vistula River.
===General description===
The Kuyavian lowlands have an average elevation of 100–130 meters above sea level. It is post-glacial landscape, slightly undulating, in some places there are moraine hills and sandy gravel embankments. In deep dykes and depressions there are approximately 600 lakes larger than 1 km2. Under the glacial formations there are layers of rock-salt and potassium, and under Tertiary Period sediments there is lignite and ceramic clay. In Kuyavia there are black fertile soils, thanks to which Kuyavia is called &quot;the granary of Poland&quot;.

===Capital and region===

The episcopal see of Kuyavia was probably Kruszwica, and later Włocławek (after the episcopal see in the early 12th century): the Diocese of Włocławek became the &quot;Diocese of Cuiavia-Kalisz&quot; from 1818 to 1925. The capital of this Duchy, and - from the late 14th century - the residences of the &quot;Voivode&quot; governors were Inowrocław, Brześć Kujawski, and Radziejów as the seat of the shared regional &quot;Sejmik&quot; council of the two voivodeships. Today, the biggest center of Kuyavia is Bydgoszcz. Also the southern part of Toruń (Podgórz) lies in the historical region.

Some ethnographers and historians, for example Oskar Kolberg and Zygmunt Gloger, count the lands of Dobrzyń and Chełmno north-east of the Vistula as parts of the Kuyavia region.

==History==
The Linear Pottery culture existed in the area. The earliest solid evidence of cheese-making, dating to 5,500 BC, was found in Kuyavia.

===Middle Ages===

The beginnings of the state in Kuyavia are connected with the tribal state of the West Slavic Goplans. The Goplans, which some researchers identify with the Mazowszanie-Kłobianie or simply with the Kuyavians, had created a country with the main centers in Kruszwica on the northern shore of Lake Gopło. During the 10th century, their territory was conquered by another West Slavic tribe, the Polans settling in the adjacent Greater Polish land around Poznań and Gniezno and upon the death of Duke Mieszko I of Poland in 992, the Kuyavia lands were part of the early Duchy of Poland, mentioned as &quot;Civitas Schinesghe&quot; as circumscribed in the &quot;Dagome iudex&quot; papal regesta.

According to Andrzej Bańkowski, the Polans had moved into the region of Greater Poland after they had to leave together with the Morawianie, their former Pannonian territories, conquered by the Avars. According to some sources, during the war with the Goplans, the Polans were supported by a Great Moravian army. As a result of occupation of the Goplans&#x27; territory, the lands of Kuyavia were under the strong influence of the Pannonian culture and they lost their primary Masovian spirit.

When the name &quot;Cuiavia&quot; arose for the first time in the 1136 Bull of Gniezno, it referred to the lands east of Greater Poland around Kruszwica and Włocławek, bordering with the Vistula river. The bull confirmed the position of the Bishopric of Kuyavia at Włocławek as a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Gniezno.

In the times of the Polish fragmentation upon the 1138 Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty, Kuyavia at first became part of the Duchy of Masovia under Bolesław IV the Curly and his son Leszek; it was claimed by the Polish High Duke Casimir II the Just in 1186, contested by his elder brother Mieszko III the Old and his son Bolesław. Casimir&#x27;s son Duke Konrad I of Masovia in 1233 created the Duchy of Kuyavia for his second son Casimir I. When Casimir&#x27;s elder brother Duke Bolesław I of Masovia died in 1248, he took the occasion and took Dobrzyń Land east of the Vistula River from the heritage of his younger brother Siemowit I. Upon Casimir&#x27;s death 1267, the Duchy of Kuyavia was divided by his sons Leszek II the Black (d. 1288), Ziemomysł (d. 1287) and Władysław I the Elbow-high into the two separate duchies of Inowrocław and Brześć Kujawski.
In 1306 Ziemomysł&#x27;s son Casimir II swore allegiance to his uncle Władysław I, who began to re-unite the Lands of the Polish Crown under his rule. The duchy was devastated during the Polish–Teutonic War of 1326–32, culminating in the 1331 Battle of Płowce, but was finally restored to Poland by the Teutonic Knights in the 1343 Treaty of Kalisz. With the death of Casimir&#x27;s son Władysław the White in 1388, the Kuyavian line of the Piast dynasty became extinct. After the reunification of Polish lands in the 14th century, the division into provinces and counties was introduced. That division finalized in the 15th century, existed until the dissolution of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795. Kuyavia was divided into the two administrative divisions of Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship and Inowrocław Voivodeship. The Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship was further divided into five powiats (counties): Brześć, Kowal, Kruszwica, Przedecz and Radziejów, while the Inowrocław Voivodeship was divided into the Bydgoszcz and Inowrocław powiats and Dobrzyń Land east of the Vistula. Both voivodeships formed part of the larger Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Battle of Koronowo of the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War was fought in the region on 10 October 1410, and ended in a Polish victory.

===Partitions of Poland===
As a result of the First Partition of Poland in 1772 the Kingdom of Prussia took a considerable part of Inowrocław Voivodeship and the western part of Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship, and included it within its newly formed Netze District. After the Second Partition of 1793 the whole of Kuyavia was taken by Prussia and incorporated into the newly formed province of South Prussia. Upon the 1807 Treaties of Tilsit, it was part of the Napoleonic Duchy of Warsaw and administered within the Bydgoszcz Department.

In 1815 under the provisions of the Congress of Vienna, Kuyavia was divided between the Kingdom of Poland (Congress Poland remaining in a personal union with the Russian Empire, from 1831 direct part of Russian Empire) and the Kingdom of Prussia. While the Brześć Kujawski province (counties: Aleksandrów, Radziejów and Włocławek) remained with the Masovia Governorate of Congress Poland in Russian Empire, Inowrocław (&quot;Hohensalza&quot;) and Bydgoszcz (&quot;Bromberg&quot;) was incorporated into the Prussian Grand Duchy of Posen. The Polish population resisted anti-Polish policies, which included forced Germanisation and Russification, and took part in several uprisings incl. the Greater Poland uprising of 1848 and January Uprising of 1863–1864. That division outlasted the 1871 unification of Germany until the end of World War I.

===Republic of Poland===
Following World War I, Poland regained independence and control of the region. Within the Second Polish Republic, from 1918, the western part of Kuyavia belonged to Poznań Voivodeship, and the eastern part belonged to the Warsaw Voivodeship. In 1938 almost all Kuyavia became a part of Pomeranian Voivodeship. In 1934 the Muzeum Nadgoplańskie in Kruszwica was built. It was opened in 1939, and it had valuable collection of ethnographical objects, inter alia: furniture and clothing.

Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, it was occupied by Nazi Germany. During the occupation, almost all of Kuyavia was annexed into the newly formed province of Reichsgau Wartheland, except the northwestern part with the city of Bydgoszcz that was annexed to the newly formed province of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia. The Polish population was subjected to various crimes, such as mass arrests, imprisonment, slave labor, expulsions, kidnapping of children, deportations to Nazi concentration camps and extermination, incl. the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;. Major sites of massacres of Poles in the region included Gniewkowo, Fordon, Otorowo, Buszkowo, Tryszczyn, Odolion and Borówno. The Germans also operated subcamps of the Potulice and Stutthof concentration camps in Bydgoszcz, and the large Stalag XX-A prisoner-of-war camp for Polish, British, French, Australian and Soviet POWs in southern Toruń. In 1945, the German occupation ended and the region was restored to Poland.

In the years 1945-1975 Kuyavia was in the borders of Bydgoszcz Voivodeship. The Włocławek Voivodeship was created in 1975, and the western part of Kuyavia remained in the Bydgoszcz Voivodeship. In 1999 almost the whole of Kuyavia was joined to the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. Furthermore, small parts of the region were included in the borders of the Masovian Voivodeship (regions between the border of the province and Skrwa Lewa River) and Greater Poland Voivodeship (Przedecz, Wierzbinek).

== Main cities and towns ==

<doc id="490537" wikidata="Q4913523" url="?curid=490537" title="Billy the Cat (British comics)">
<text>Billy the Cat is a fictional character first published in the British comic magazine &quot;The Beano&quot; in 1967. He is a vigilante dressed in a &quot;cat suit&quot; who stars in his eponymous adventure story, and occasionally teams with Katie Cat. A popular character, Billy the Cat is a prolific figure in DC Thomson&#x27;s comic magazines, his character appearing in a variety of series and issues of non-&quot;Beano&quot; magazines.

== Background ==
In &quot;The Beano&quot; 1967 Easter issue, a DC Thomson advert announced a new superhero would feature in the magazine soon. The advert read: &quot;Look at this chap! It&#x27;s the amazing Billy the Cat! Follow his strange, exciting adventures in the big city—starting in &quot;The Beano&quot; next week!&quot; as the artwork depicted a figure in a black outfit running across a roof. Superheroes were not new to &quot;The Beano&quot;, but Billy the Cat&#x27;s pre-production developments are unknown. Lew Stringer noted Billy the Cat published when the &quot;Batman&quot; television adaptation aired, but the character having a secret identity as a schoolboy was similar to Spider-Man&#x27;s characterisation.

== Synopsis ==
William Grange is the orphaned son of police officers who died in a car accident. He lives with his Aunt Mabel and attends Burnham Academy, but he is inspired by his parents&#x27; legacy to fight crime as well. When his peers are distracted, he disguises as a masked vigilante to help Burnham&#x27;s police force catch criminals in his town. The disguise, Billy the Cat, is a catsuit and a hard helmet with cat ears, whiskers, and/or designed with eyes on the front. As the disguise, Grange becomes superhumanly agile: jumping off the ground onto roofs, and somersaulting great lengths; and strong enough to defeat adult criminals in hand-to-hand combat. His gadget rucksack is also well-equipped with gadgets, as well as rope and grappling hooks so he can swing around the town. The police and the armed forces admire the hero, willingly following his lead and are inspired by his fighting techniques.

== Publication history ==
=== Official runs ===
&quot;Billy the Cat&quot; was part of &quot;The Beano&quot; adventure story genre: text comics with photorealistic artwork of adventure stories starring men and boys who depicted hobbies and interests the male readers stereotypically had. Although the genre had featured in the magazine since the first issue, the paragraphs of text under each panel would eventually become unpopular with readers who preferred the visual and humorous comic strips. Grange would become the last adventure story character to debut in the magazine but his &quot;Billy the Cat&quot; stories looked similar to an American superhero comic. Stories were episodic, rarely expanding beyond one issue, and authors were uncredited, but the artists have been retroactively revealed.

The first series spanned from issues 1289 to 1332, drawn by David Sutherland. The second and third series was illustrated by frequent adventure story artist Sandy Calder (also illustrated for &quot;General Jumbo&quot; and &quot;Danny&#x27;s Deep-Sea Iron Fish&quot;). The third series finished in 1971 in issue 1494. Thirty-two years later, &quot;Billy the Cat&quot; reappeared in issue 3195 with a new series designed by Wayne Thomson, which ran for a month until issue 3200. Nigel Dobbyn illustrated the 2005 nine-issue reboot, and Barrie Appleby illustrated the 2008 reboot, which featured after Laura Howell&#x27;s one-off strip from the 70th anniversary issue.

Grange would return in his original 20th century run in &quot;Billy the Cat and Katie&quot;. Illustrated by Sandy Calder, Grange is joined by his cousin Kathleen, whose parents are visiting the United States and is sent to stay with him until they return. She is made Katie the Cat (sometimes Katie Cat) with an identical uniform, and identical abilities and gadgets. The stories had two series that finished Billy the Cat&#x27;s 20th century sagas, ending in issue 1677. The second was the only serialised story Billy the Cat would have in the magazine, in which Kathleen and William go on a school trip cruise.

=== Subsequent appearances ===
==== &quot;The Beano&quot; ====
The superhuman vigilante did not stop featuring in the &quot;Beano&quot; franchise after he disappeared in 1974. The &quot;Billy the Cat&quot; stories have featured frequently in &quot;The Beano Annual&quot; from since 1969. 2008&#x27;s edition was a notorious three-part story where Billy the Cat discovers the antagonist is General Jumbo, mind-controlled by his army model Private Pike. 2010&#x27;s edition featured &quot;William the Cat&quot;, a similar-themed superhero strip set in the Victorian era, revealed to be Grange&#x27;s imagination during a school trip to a museum. He and Katie Cat joined 253 characters on a double-page spread in 2019&#x27;s annual in celebration of the 80th anniversary.

He also appeared in &quot;The Beano Summer Special&quot;s of 1968, 1970, 1972, 1973, and 1988.

==== DC Thomson ====
Grange&#x27;s series has been revived frequently throughout DC Thomson&#x27;s history, notably showing him in other stages in his life. Although Grange (and cousin Kathleen)&#x27;s age was never specified, &quot;Buddy&quot; &quot;Billy the Cat&quot; series depicted him as looking notably older, possibly his late teens, and the story relocated to Marham, finishing in issue 128.

In 2013, &quot;The Digital Dandy&quot; shared universe story &quot;Retro Active&quot; featured Kathleen in her Katie Cat persona joining the superhero team, and an adult William had a supporting role, revealing he was now a police officer in charge of the force&#x27;s Costumed Crime Division. Years before, Billy the Cat appeared in &quot;The Dandy&quot; Comic Cuts section between November 1986 and March 1988.

A reprint featured in issue 171 of &quot;Classics from the Comics&quot; along with other reprints from several superheroes by DC Thomson.

== Reception and legacy ==
Billy the Cat and his series was popular enough to be passed amongst DC Thomson&#x27;s children&#x27;s magazines. However, readers became curious about Grange&#x27;s history before his parents&#x27; deaths. Former reader David Carman wrote online fanfiction to give William and Kathleen an (unofficial) origin story, which DC Thomson approved.

<doc id="490538" wikidata="Q7154948" url="?curid=490538" title="Paulina Luisi">
<text>Paulina Luisi Janicki (1875–1950) was a leader of the feminist movement in Uruguay. She was born in Colón, Argentina, on 22 September 1875 into a family of educators. In 1909, she became the first Uruguayan woman to earn a medical degree.

Luisi represented Uruguay in international women&#x27;s conferences and traveled throughout Latin America and Europe. She is considered one of the principal figures in the Pan-American feminist movement, having helped to found the Pan-American Women’s Auxiliary. However, she frequently clashed with other major figures in the movement, including members of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA) such as Carrie Chapman Catt and Bertha Lutz.

Several prominent Uruguayan advocacy organizations were founded with Luisi&#x27;s support, including the ( Telephone Operators Union) and the ( Women&#x27;s Alliance for Women&#x27;s Rights), which championed women&#x27;s suffrage in Uruguay. She also supported eugenic reforms, as well as regulations governing the sex industry. She worked with the League of Nations to combat sex trafficking and advance the rights of children.

During the 1930s, Luisi was a regular announcer on the Uruguayan radio station , an &quot;all-woman&quot; radio station where she adopted the nickname ( Grandmother). She also worked with various organizations to oppose the rise of fascism in Uruguay and abroad and advocated for sexual education in schools. She died on 16 July 1950.

==Early life and education==
Paulina Luisi was born in Colón, Argentina, on 22 September 1875. Her mother, Maria Teresa Josefina Janicki, was a women&#x27;s suffrage activist of Polish descent, and her father, Angel Luisi, was a socialist and educator of Italian ancestry. Shortly after her birth, the family moved to Uruguay, where they worked as teachers and founded multiple educational establishments, including the Luisi Institute, the ( Liberal Center), and the ( Paysandú Athenaeum). Luisi had seven siblings, including two notable sisters: Clotilde Luisi, who was the first female lawyer in Uruguay, and Luisa Luisi, who was a famous poet.

Luisi earned a teaching degree in 1890 and, in 1899, became the first woman in Uruguay to earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree. In 1908, she became the first woman to graduate from the Medical School of the University of the Republic of Uruguay, and soon after she became the head of the gynecology clinic of the university&#x27;s Faculty of Medicine. At the time Luisi was starting her medical career, there were only four female doctors in Uruguay, compared to 305 male doctors. Luisi benefited from her specialization in the treatment of women, as many women preferred being treated by other women due to prevailing social prejudices held by male doctors.

Luisi was introduced to the Latin American feminist movement during her time at university, with Argentine feminist Petrona Eyle writing to her to recruit her to join her organization, ( Argentine Association of University Women). In a letter dated May 1, 1907, Eyle encouraged Luisi and her female colleagues in the university to form an Uruguayan branch of the Universitarias, stating that “although there aren’t many of you now, you will always be the nucleus around which others will come together”. The Uruguayan branch of the Universitarias was founded in 1907.

==Activism and career==
===Early activism===

During the 1910s, Luisi took part in numerous conferences and other activities with the aim of advancing the feminist movement both in Uruguay and abroad. In 1910, she participated in the Universitarias-organized ( Women&#x27;s Congress) held in Buenos Aires. The conference was attended by over 200 women from Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, Paraguay, and Chile. While there, she became acquainted with prominent Argentine feminists such as Alicia Moreau de Justo and Cecilia Grierson, as well as other future leaders of the feminist movement in Latin America. Later, she traveled to Europe, where she became acquainted with members of the French feminist movement such as Avril de Sainte-Croix, president of the Moral Unity Committee of the International Council of Women, and Julie Siegfried, president of the National Council of French Women.

In 1915, Luisi helped to found the Pan-American Women’s Auxiliary, which met at the same time as the Second Pan-American Scientific Congress in Washington, D.C. The Auxiliary, headed by the wives of high-ranking U.S. officials, advocated for the &quot;social and economic betterment&quot; of women and children. Then, in 1916, Luisi founded the  (CONAMU, National Women&#x27;s Council of Uruguay) along with Isabel Pinto de Vidal and Francisca Beretervide. She served as the primary editor of the CONAMU bulletin ( Feminine Action), which primarily focused on topics concerning women&#x27;s values and equality. She also gave the keynote address before the First Pan-American Child Congress in 1916, emphasizing the importance of democracy and women&#x27;s rights, including the right to vote, in the Americas. While there, she introduced several resolutions advocating for sex education and public health.

Luisi also began advocating for working-class women around this time. In 1918, she assisted in the creation of the ( Telephone Operators Union), the first women&#x27;s union in Uruguay, and intervened on their behalf to reduce workloads by decreasing the number of phone lines at the telephone company Montelco from 100 to 80. The intervention failed, with the number of phone lines going up between 1918 and 1922.

===Conflict with IWSA and CONAMU===
Divisions began to emerge in CONAMU around 1918, with Luisi alienating members of the Batllista faction of the Colorado Party, including fellow CONAMU founder Pinto de Vidal, by aligning herself with socialist political positions. Because of these divisions, Luisi helped to found the Alianza de Mujeres para los Derechos Femeninos, which split off from CONAMU in 1919. Initially, the Alianza&#x27;s primary focus was women&#x27;s suffrage and access to government positions, and it frequently pressured elected officials to grant women various political rights. In one notable instance, it worked with Deputy Alfeo Brum to get the General Assembly to pass a bill authorizing women’s suffrage at the municipal level so that women could fulfill their &quot;legitimate social duty of rendering service to the different domains of public welfare&quot;. The bill did not pass, and with suffrage stalled, the Alianza expanded its agenda to include women’s economic and civil rights. Luisi resigned from CONAMU in 1921, citing the group&#x27;s &quot;unethical and conspiratorial behavior&quot;. Pinto de Vidal became the new head of the organization in her stead, but Luisi returned to the organization soon after her resignation to work in other capacities.

Luisi also came into conflict with the IWSA, the parent organization of the Alianza, during the 1920s. She specifically opposed the leadership of Carrie Chapman Catt and Bertha Lutz, whose attitudes toward Latin American feminists she viewed as being condescending and imperialistic. As she became more distant from the IWSA, Luisi began associating more closely with the ( International League of Iberian and Latin American Women) and its founder Elena Arizmendi Mejía. The conflict reached a crisis point in 1923 at the IWSA conference in Rome, with Luisi opposing a motion supported by Lutz to reintegrate the IWSA with the International Council of Women (ICW), which she viewed as being more conservative. She also opposed the merger on the grounds that it would privilege European recognition over inter-American solidarity. While the merger ultimately did not pass, the personal rivalry between Luisi and Lutz for influence in the organization continued to escalate.

Luisi clashed once again with CONAMU leadership in 1923, expressing anger over CONAMU&#x27;s alleged rewriting of her work, publicly criticizing them for their conservative views in the newspaper . Soon after, Luisi was discharged from her role as CONAMU&#x27;s external secretary. Later, in 1925, Pinto de Vidal resigned from her position as the organization&#x27;s president. and ceased publication.

===Work on sex trafficking===
Luisi was strongly opposed to sex work, viewing it as a degrading &quot;social evil&quot; according to historian Magaly Rodriguez Garcia. However, she also saw it as a product of economic hardship and saw the correlation between prostitution and low wages. The sex trade in general was seen as a growing problem in Latin America and around the world, with many women being forced to participate against their will. In 1919, Luisi delivered a well-known lecture at the University of Buenos Aires titled &quot;The White Slave Trade and the Problem of Reglamentation&quot;. Not long after the conference, the Argentine-Uruguayan Abolitionist Committee was formed. She also collaborated with the Municipal Council of Buenos Aires in 1919 to outlaw brothels and provide work opportunities, legal protection, and hostels for sex workers seeking to leave the trade.

Luisi worked extensively with the League of Nations&#x27; Committee on the Traffic of Women and Children, serving as the Uruguayan delegate and helping to ratify the League of Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children in Uruguay in 1921. She also attended the League of Nations&#x27; International Labour Conference in 1922 as a representative from Uruguay. While there, she proposed the demographic separation of men and women and of different age groups in data about human trafficking so that it would better reflect the vulnerability of women and children to being trafficked, noting in her proposal that &quot;a large number of girl emigrants are sent to South America from countries like Poland, Russia, Spain and Italy for immoral purposes, under the pretext of being hired for ordinary domestic work&quot;. The proposal was ultimately withdrawn, but the International Labour Organization did promise that it would coordinate with the advisory committee on more precise age and sex classifications.

Luisi also helped to pass the Children&#x27;s Code in 1934 in collaboration with the Uruguayan National Council of Women. The code placed the responsibility for protecting children on the state while also granting care and social security for pregnant women. It also addressed problems stemming from illegitimate births.

===Later activism===
In her later years, Luisi&#x27;s feminist activism began to take the form of radio broadcasting. During the 1930s, she was a regular announcer on , an &quot;all-woman&quot; radio station in Uruguay. On air, Luisi urged feminists to remain active, arguing that women could make a difference acting as &quot;mediators and peacemakers&quot;. Luisi adopted the nickname &quot;Abuela&quot; while hosting, giving her a sense of authenticity and authority that resonated with women in Uruguay. A milestone in Luisi&#x27;s radio career occurred in 1942, when she encouraged women to vote in the 1942 elections to prove that women were worthy of citizenship.

Luisi also became an advocate for disarmament and developed an intolerance for fascism during the 1930s and 1940s. She opposed the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in 1933. She also opposed the Uruguayan &quot;Revolution of March&quot; led by Gabriel Terra in 1933, briefly fleeing to Europe but returning to Uruguay shortly after. In 1934, she established the (UFG, Union of Women Against War), an Uruguayan branch of the (CMF). She also collaborated with various communist-aligned groups, viewing the rise of fascism as a means for capitalists to maintain control over the working class. In 1935, Luisi gave a speech before the Uruguayan parliament opposing the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Then, in 1936, she helped to enlist women&#x27;s aid for the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War. She also helped support Terra&#x27;s ouster in 1938, though she expressed concern that Uruguay still &quot;suffer[ed] from a de facto government which leans toward fascism&quot;.

Luisi&#x27;s belief in sex education, first enumerated in 1916, became a more prominent part of her later advocacy as well. She spoke extensively about its importance from the 1930s to the 1950s, positing that sex education would help foment responsibility and ethical behavior. Her suggestions earned her the label of &quot;anarchist&quot; and &quot;revolutionary&quot; from some. Nevertheless, in 1944, many of her suggestions for sexual education were incorporated into the Uruguayan public school system. In her 1950 book ( Pedagogy and Sexual Behavior), she &quot;defined sex education as the pedagogic tool to teach the individual subject to sexual drives to the will of an instructed, conscientious, responsible intellect&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
In 1947, the ( First Inter-American Women’s Conference) in Guatemala paid tribute to Luisi, recognizing her as the &quot;mother&quot; of inter-American feminism. Luisi died in Montevideo three years later on 16 July 1950. Many of her papers remain in various archives across Montevideo. She is remembered by historian Estela Ibarburu as &quot;a person who marked a milestone in the process of women&#x27;s empowerment&quot;.

==Views==
Luisi is strongly associated with the feminist movement in Latin America. Her feminist views were influenced by figures within the Western liberal tradition, including Olympe de Gouges, the writer of the &quot;Declaration of the Rights of Woman&quot;, and Josephine Butler, the 19th-century English moral reformer. Butler&#x27;s fight against the Contagious Disease Act of 1864 and her foundation of the International Abolitionist Federation (IAF) in Geneva to curb the white slave trade was particularly inspiring to Luisi.

In addition to fighting for women’s rights in Uruguay, Luisi aspired to create a Pan-American feminist movement that would benefit all countries in the Americas. Luisi traveled to the United States hoping to develop Pan-American feminism alongside American feminists, but she emerged disappointed in American women’s unwillingness to work alongside Latin American women as equal partners. However, with the outbreak of World War II, she returned to her earlier Pan-American stance, once again advocating for &quot;sisterhood&quot; between the two groups.

Luisi was a supporter of eugenics, publishing an article in the Buenos Aires ( Journal of Philosophy) titled &quot;Sobre Eugenia&quot; ( About Eugenics) in 1916. In the article, she called for the &quot;protection of racial reproduction against mental and physical degeneration&quot;, including by &quot;imposition of controls on the reproduction of the hereditarily unfit&quot;, as well as a variety of social reforms aimed at reducing alcoholism, drug abuse, and other health-related issues that were perceived as being hereditary.

Luisi has also been associated with the moral reform movement. She espoused an ideal of &quot;moral unity&quot;, which was characterized by its opposition to sex work and the spread of venereal diseases, as well as its general concern with elevating the role of women in society. She was also a self-identified socialist, calling for individual social responsibility and a &quot;collective social consciousness&quot;. She praised the  ( Socialist Party of Uruguay) for being the &quot;only party that proclaims the equality of the sexes&quot;, and she ran for the Chamber of Representatives on the Socialist ticket in 1942, though she ultimately withdrew her candidacy because of opposition from the Socialist leadership to her feminist politics.

<doc id="490539" wikidata="Q7254703" url="?curid=490539" title="Pseudocopulation">
<text>Pseudocopulation is a behavior similar to copulation that serves a reproductive function for one or both participants but does not involve actual sexual union between the individuals. It is most generally applied to a pollinator attempting to copulate with a flower adapted to mimic a potential female mate. The resemblance may be visual, but the key stimuli are often chemical and tactile. The form of mimicry in plants that deceives an insect into pseudocopulation is called Pouyannian mimicry after the French lawyer and amateur botanist Maurice-Alexandre Pouyanne.

A non-mimetic form of pseudocopulation has been observed in some parthenogenetic, all-female species of lizard. The behaviour does not appear to be necessary to trigger parthenogenesis.

== Definition ==

In zoology, pseudocopulation is attempted copulation that serves a reproductive function for one or both participants but does not involve actual sexual union between the individuals. 

== In orchids ==

Pseudocopulation by an insect on a flower is a result of Pouyannian mimicry, named after the French lawyer and amateur botanist Maurice-Alexandre Pouyanne. . This occurs in several orchids, whose flowers mimic the female mating signals of specific pollinator insects, such as bees. The mimicry results in attempted copulation by males of the pollinator species, facilitating pollen transfer. Bee orchids (&quot;Ophrys apifera&quot;) and fly orchids (&quot;Ophrys insectifera&quot;), specifically, utilize flower morphology, coloration, and scent to deceive their respective pollinators. These orchids have evolved traits matching the preferences of specific pollinator niches, leading to adaptive speciation. Although bee and fly orchids are visual mimics of their pollinators, visual traits are not the only (nor the most important) ones mimicked to increase attraction.

== In lizards ==

Some lizard species, such as the Laredo striped whiptail (&quot;Aspidoscelis [Cnemidophorus] laredoensis&quot;) and the Desert grassland whiptail lizard (A. uniparens), consist only of females, which reproduce by parthenogenesis. Some of these species have been observed to practise pseudocopulation in captivity, but it does not appear to be required to trigger parthenogenesis.&#x27;

<doc id="490549" wikidata="Q3998983" url="?curid=490549" title="Triple Alliance (1788)">
<text>The Triple Alliance of 1788 was a military alliance between Great Britain, Prussia and the Dutch Republic. Great Britain saw it as necessary to maintain the balance of power, and Prussia was hoping for the territorial gains. The alliance was primarily aimed at the Russian Empire, which stood to increase its influence with its looming victory over the Ottoman Empire. Due to efforts of Russian diplomacy (Ochakov Affair), particularly in fostering parliamentary dissent in Great Britain, where the main proponent of action against Russia, William Pitt the Younger, lost support, the Alliance fell apart before it was ready to engage in planned military action against Russia. The destruction of the Triple Alliance is considered a major success of the Russian diplomacy.

==Formation==
In April 1788 Prussia secured a credit in case of a war with Russia from the Dutch Republic. In return, Prussia provided military backing for the unstable Dutch government. On 13 August 1788, the Anglo-Prussian military alliance was signed. This marked the formation of the Triple Alliance.

From the British perspective, the Alliance was formed to maintain the balance of power in Europe, particularly with regards to France and Russia, and the potentially unstable regions of the Baltics, the Balkans and the Netherlands. Prussia, on the other hand, was hoping for some territorial gains in the Baltic region, through war (with Russia) or diplomacy (from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth), or a combination of the above. With regards to the Balkans, the Triple Alliance aimed at restraining the Russian Empire, as well as the Austrian Empire, then in alliance (Austro-Russian alliance), and there were expectations of a war between the Alliance and Russia (and possibly Austria) around 1791.

==Evolution==

Great Britain did not want war, in so much as it would be content if Russia would retreat from its war with the Ottomans without any territorial changes, but it realized this was an unlikely outcome. Starting in August 1790, British and Prussian diplomats in Russia started pressuring the Russians to begin negotiations with the Ottomans, with no luck.

Realizing that William Pitt the Younger was seriously considering hardline politics towards Russia, and that a war with Prussia and Great Britain would likely end up with a loss, Russian Empress Catherine the Great ordered her ambassador in London, Semyon Vorontsov, to aid Pitt&#x27;s opponent, Charles Fox, in the British Parliament. Vorontsov and other members of the Russian diplomatic staff had arranged, on occasion through bribery, for support from many members of the British establishment.

The Dutch Republic was much less interested in a war with Russia, as Russia had significant debts to Dutch bankers, which the war could jeopardize. William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland, British ambassador to the Dutch Republic, was on good terms with local Russian diplomatic staff, and tended to argue against any action that would involve hostilities with Russia.

Britain also failed at improving its relations with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which at that point considered itself on good terms with Russia and did not want to jeopardize those relations by getting closer to the Triple Alliance. The end of the Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790) also meant one less potential ally for the Triple Coalition, as the king of Sweden was not willing to reopen the Russian front.

By early 1791, around February, Prussian diplomacy managed to secure an agreement with Austria. Although Austria refused to switch sides, it also agreed to remain neutral in case of a war between Russia and Prussia. This convinced Pitt to assure Frederic that Britain would send a fleet to the Baltic, and to craft an ultimatum to Russia, requiring it to retreat from its war with the Ottomans or face an Anglo-Prussian intervention; by late March this position got royal approval and the debate in British parliament was to take place soon. In the meantime, in early March, Frederic Wilhelm II assured an Ottoman representative of his desire to attack Russia as soon as the Royal Navy appeared in the Baltic Sea, and encouraged him, in a handwritten letter, to continue the ongoing war with Russia and undertake a new offensive in the Balkans. Prussia&#x27;s military preparations were very advanced, with about 90,000 troops massing on the border, and plans for three corps to advance on Riga. Russia itself was gearing itself to defend the Baltic sea border against the expected invasion.

Aware of the significance of the debate to take place in the British parliament in late March, Russian diplomats in London pulled out all stops to mobilize allies to oppose an Anglo-Russian conflict. Russian diplomats spent significant funds on diplomacy and propaganda. It had assured the support of about twenty British newspapers, and begun printing and distribution of many leaflets arguing against the &quot;Russian armament&quot; proposal of Pitt the Younger, as the issue became known in contemporary British discourse. Russian supporters included merchants with influence at the London Stock Exchange, writers and publicists such as John Paradise (&quot;Doctor Johnson&quot;), as well as members of the British Parliament, such as the son of Thomas Dimsdale, Charles Fox, Edmund Burke and others.

In the days before the British debate, the Dutch had offered to negotiate between Russia and the Triple Alliance, and Auckland reported that he saw documents in which Frederick Wilhelm questioned the need for the war and expressed concerns over the militant Austrian attitude (according to Polish historian Jerzy Łojek, that was either Auckland&#x27;s own or Russian misinformation, or a combination of both). The debate begun on March 29. Despite criticism from the minority opponents, like Charles Fox, the House of Commons expressed its approval for the war with Russia thrice on that day. However, over the next two or three days, debates within Pitt&#x27;s own government resulted in a drastic change of plans. The specific reasons for this sudden conflict within Pitt&#x27;s government are not fully understood; Łojek suggests it was through the influence of Fox, Auckland and the Russian diplomacy on several of its members. Pitt could have forced the issue by creating a new government, but he decided that was not a viable solution, as a crisis in the government could result in an unpredictable shift of power. By mid- and late April, with William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville replacing Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds as the Foreign Secretary, the British policy was now set as pro-Russian, and anti-French.

A British courier with an ultimatum and a joint British-Prussian declaration to Russia arrived in Berlin on the night of April 3 to 4, but before he left, was intercepted on April 8 by another courier ordering a delay. It was only in early June that Prussia realized that British politics had taken a significant shift, and Britain no longer desired a war with Russia. This meant the end of the Triple Alliance.

==Aftermath==
The end of the alliance was cemented by the British-Netherlands-Prussian-Russian treaty of 26 July 1791, in which the Triple Alliance &quot;de facto&quot; capitulated to all Russian demands, accepting all Russian territorial demands on Ottomans. Within two years all the signatories of the alliance were at war with France following the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War.

Łojek notes that historiography of the fall of the Triple Alliance is sparse, as it was overshadowed by the interest in issues related to the French Revolution; as he notes, a war that never started is much less interesting than the revolution that changed the world. He notes that the end of the alliance was a triumph of the Russian diplomacy, and failure of the British one, as well as a personal failure of Pitt, who since this defeat removed himself from the British foreign policy. From the Polish perspective, he notes that the failure of the Polish diplomacy to pursue an alliance with the Triple Alliance was another major factor which resulted in its weakening, and by correspondingly strengthening Russia, this Polish inactivity contributed to the fall of Poland. He notes that although some Poles, like Antoni Augustyn Deboli, argued for an alliance with Great Britain, king Stanisław August Poniatowski, who controlled most of Polish diplomacy, refused to stand in opposition to Russia, which in hindsight was a major blow for Poland.

<text>The deal porters were a specialist group of workers in London&#x27;s docks. They handled baulks of softwood or &quot;deal&quot;, stacking them up to 60 feet (18 m) high in quayside warehouses. This was a demanding and dangerous job. It required physical strength, dexterity and a head for heights, to such an extent that they were nicknamed &quot;Blondins&quot; after the famous acrobat, Charles Blondin. Deal porters wore special leather headgear (backing hats) with long &quot;aprons&quot; over their shoulders in order to protect their heads and necks from wooden splinters.

Their trade was a notably hazardous one. The &quot;New Survey of London Life and Labour&quot;, published in 1928, noted:

:&quot;Deal portering is heavy and dangerous work which cannot safely be undertaken by any save experienced men. The shoulder of an experienced deal porter is said to develop a callosity which enables it to bear the weight and friction of a load of planks. But even with a hardened shoulder the deal porter has an unenviable task. To carry over a shaking slippery plankway a bundle of shaking slippery planks, when a fall would almost certainly mean serious injury, is work for specialists.&quot;

Most of the deal porters worked at the Surrey Commercial Docks in Rotherhithe, which specialised in timber. The workers were represented by the Port of London Deal Porters&#x27; Union. They were eventually rendered obsolete by the 1940s as mechanisation provided a better and cheaper way of moving timber cargo, and less arduous jobs became available elsewhere.

There are a number of commemorations of the deal porters in Rotherhithe. At Canada Water there is a sculpture in their honour, designed by Philip Bews. There is a street named &quot;Deal Porters Way&quot;, a street named &quot;Blondin Way&quot;, a path named &quot;Deal Porters Walk&quot;, and a public square alongside Canada Water Library named &quot;Deal Porters Square&quot;. The Compass pub in Rotherhithe Street was formerly named &quot;The Deal Porter&quot;.

<doc id="490568" wikidata="Q6618921" url="?curid=490568" title="List of entertainment affected by the September 11 attacks">
<text>The September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001 had a significant impact on broadcast and venue entertainment businesses, prompting cancellations, postponements, and changes in content. In the United States and several other countries, planned television screenings of films and fictional programs where terrorism, plane crashes, bombs, or other related disasters that were the primary subject were postponed or cancelled.
==Films==
Numerous films that were in production were cancelled, and many films were edited. There were various reasons given for the alterations, including keeping material up-to-date, as a gesture of respect for those who died, and to avoid trauma for those emotionally affected by the attack. There are also many films which notably were not edited.

Roughly 45 films were edited or postponed because of the September 11 attacks.

===Edited films===
====With the World Trade Center removed====
* &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002) – A teaser trailer of the film was recalled, as it featured Spider-Man capturing a helicopter filled with criminals in a web spun between the Twin Towers. A poster with the World Trade Center reflected in Spider-Man&#x27;s eyes was also recalled, while the short teaser trailer of the film also removed the towers from Spider-Man&#x27;s eye reflection. Sony removed any mentions of the Twin Towers from the teaser images and trailer on the website. A shot of the World Trade Center (WTC) was deleted from the film, but it can be found on the Sony Stock Footage website. The home video release of &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; had the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trailer removed as well. Two scenes were added to the film in response to the attacks: in the first, a group of New Yorkers attack the Green Goblin over the Queensboro Bridge, with one saying, &quot;You mess with Spidey, you mess with New York!&quot;, and another saying &quot;You mess with one of us, you mess with &quot;all&quot; of us!&quot;. The second, a scene of Spider-Man hanging onto a flagpole with a large American flag, was seen in later trailers and at the end of the film.
* &quot;Zoolander&quot; (2001) – The WTC was digitally deleted from skyline shots in the film, which was theatrically released nearly three weeks after the attacks.
* &quot;Don&#x27;t Say a Word&quot; (2001) – The film was theatrically released nearly three weeks after the attacks, and the filmmakers contemplated delaying its release, but decided against it. However, they cut out and replaced shots of the towers from the edit, such as the opening shot, which shows Brooklyn instead.
* &quot;Men in Black II&quot; (2002) – It originally featured a climax that included the WTC, but the scene was changed to the Statue of Liberty.
* &quot;Changing Lanes&quot; (2002) – Director Roger Michell had the WTC towers digitally removed from the opening main title sequence in the film. In the DVD commentary, he admitted that it was a mistake to erase them, and pretend they did not exist.
*&quot;Mr. Deeds&quot; (2002) – Shots of the World Trade Center were partially seen: one was shot in the helicopter for the scene where Longfellow Deeds arrives in New York City, and one was shot in the Upper West Side, which shows the entire Manhattan skyline. The towers were digitally removed in the scene where Deeds and Chuck Cedar play tennis, which was shot on Roosevelt Island in spring 2001.
* &quot;Stuart Little 2&quot; (2002) – Shots of the World Trade Center were digitally removed.
*&quot;Serendipity&quot; (2001) — Shots containing the World Trade Center were removed.
* &quot;Kissing Jessica Stein&quot; (2001) – Shots of the WTC were removed before the film&#x27;s release.
* &quot;People I Know&quot; (2002) – Scenes of the WTC were removed, but it can be found on the DVD release in the deleted scenes featurette.
* &quot;Armageddon&quot; (1998) – The scene in which the World Trade Center gets hit by meteors and catches on fire was edited out of many television broadcasts of the film after the attacks.
* &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; (1992) – It features a scene atop the WTC, which was edited out on several television channels. However, as of Christmas 2018, the scene with the WTC was restored.

====Other changes related to the September 11 attacks====
* &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (2002 re-release) – The dialogue &quot;You&#x27;re not going as a terrorist&quot; (spoken by the mother) was replaced with &quot;You&#x27;re not going as a hippie.&quot;
* &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; (2000, aired on ABC Family) – The scene near the end in which Greg gets into an argument with the airline stewardess and his subsequent interrogation by an airline official removes all references to Greg mentioning the word &quot;bomb&quot; on the airplane.
* &quot;Spy Game&quot; (2001) – The level of smoke shown following a bombing was reduced because of its similarity to the smoking WTC wreckage.
* &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (2002) – A scene where debris from the destroyed moon crashes into a building was edited due to its resemblance to the attacks.
* &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; (2002) – The film originally showed Stitch, Jumba, Pleakley, and Nani hijacking a Boeing 747 to chase down Captain Gantu and rescue Lilo through the streets of Honolulu. However, this scene was changed to show them taking Jumba&#x27;s spaceship and chasing Gantu around Hawaii&#x27;s mountains. The original scene was included on the special edition DVD.
*&quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; (2000) – The scene where Max saves Tank from a burning fire was edited on post-9/11 versions and Disney Channel due to the fire being too similar to the attacks, however the original scene was still intact in the Disney+ version.
* &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; (2002) was extensively reshot due to the fear of the CIA as the antagonist being wrongly interpreted as anti-Americanism. Due to the insistence of Matt Damon and Doug Liman, the footage wasn&#x27;t included. On the special edition DVD are descriptions of how and why the film was changed.
*&quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot; (2002) – A scene resembling the tragedy, with people falling from a toppling building and being ultimately saved by the Powerpuff Girls, was rethought and adjusted to avoid making a direct reference to the World Trade Center.
* Fox shelved previously scheduled airings of &quot;The X-Files&quot; movie (1998) and &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996) on September 14 and 16, respectively. They were replaced by respective airings of &quot;Nine Months&quot; (1995) and &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; (1998). &quot;The Peacemaker&quot; (1997) was also removed from ABC on the same day as &quot;Independence Day&quot;.
*&quot;Die Another Day&quot; (2002) – The film was originally going to end with a North Korean satellite attack on Manhattan, which was moved to the Korean Demilitarized Zone after the attacks.
* &quot;The Incredibles&quot; (2004) – Early versions of the film featured a scene where Mr. Incredible vents his emotions on an abandoned building, but ends up accidentally damaging a neighboring building as well. It was considered to be too reminiscent of the World Trade Center collapse and was replaced with a scene where Mr. Incredible and Frozone rescue trapped civilians from a burning building.
* &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; (2001) – The film originally depicted the CDA blowing up a sushi restaurant as part of a decontamination effort, but the scene was replaced with the restaurant being quarantined under a dome of plasma instead. The filmmakers described the decision to alter the film in the Blu-ray &quot;round-table discussion&quot; bonus feature.
* &quot;Sidewalks of New York&quot; (2001) – The WTC was removed from the promotional poster, but the buildings remained in the film itself.

===Delayed films===
* &quot;View from the Top&quot; (2003) - was originally scheduled for Christmas 2001, but due to the fact that the story revolves around a flight attendant on numerous planes, the release was pushed back to March 21, 2003.
* &quot;Collateral Damage&quot; (2002) – The film was postponed for four months after being slated for release October 5, 2001, and features a terrorist bombing in front of a Los Angeles building. The film subsequently failed at the box office, which likely was a result of the public who felt the film (with its subject matter involving terrorists) was released too soon after the attacks.
* &quot;Training Day&quot; (2001) - originally scheduled for release on September 21, but was delayed to October 5.
* &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (2002) – The film was delayed by three months from its original December 2001 release, because of an eventually-deleted scene where a meteor shower destroys New York City. 
* &quot;Big Trouble&quot; (2002) – The film was postponed seven months because it involved a nuclear bomb being smuggled on board an aircraft; it was slated for September 21.
* &quot;Bad Company&quot; (2002) - Its release date December 25, 2001 pushed back several months because the plot involved a criminal mastermind planning to detonate a bomb in the Grand Central Terminal.
* &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; (2002) - The movie&#x27;s release date was intended for Christmas 2001, but due to the September 11 attacks it was delayed until a year later.
* &quot;Deuces Wild&quot; (2002) – Slated for release in September 2001 but was pushed back due to the attacks and storyline about violence in New York, and was eventually released in May 2002.
* &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; (2003) – Premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2001 but its wide release was pushed back two years until 2003 due to war themes.
* &quot;Windtalkers&quot; (2002) – Originally slated for a Christmas 2001 release but due to its war theme it was pushed back until June 2002 and was re-edited for depictions of violence.
* &quot;Hart&#x27;s War&quot; (2002) – Originally planned for release in December 2001 due to war themes its release was postponed until February 2002.

===Cancelled films===
* A Jackie Chan film called &quot;Nosebleed&quot;, about a window washer on the WTC who foils a terrorist plot, was due to start filming on September 11, 2001. Snopes questioned the suggestion that this was any kind of &quot;narrow escape&quot;, pointing out the uncertain nature of film development and noting &quot;it was almost certainly as part of a plan drawn up and abandoned long before September 2001&quot;.
* James Cameron planned to make a sequel to &quot;True Lies&quot;, but canceled the project after the attacks, saying that &quot;terrorism is no longer something to be taken lightly&quot;.
* There were plans to have a sequel to &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, but after the attacks, Eric Roth, Robert Zemeckis, and Tom Hanks said that the story was no longer &quot;relevant&quot; and it felt &quot;meaningless&quot;.
* Peter Berg had been set to direct heist film &quot;Truck 44&quot; for Fox 2000 Pictures, which would have followed a group FDNY firefighters who accidentally start a blaze in a ritzy Manhattan apartment building while robbing it, until Fox decided to shelve it in the wake of the attacks. In March 2002, Berg attempted to get the project restarted at Radar Pictures by rewriting it so it took place in Miami.
*Columbia Pictures had scheduled &quot;Tick Tock&quot;, an action thriller written by Anthony Bagarozzi and Charles Mondry to be directed by Stephen Norrington and star Jennifer Lopez, to start production in January 2002, however due to the plot which centered around an FBI agent investigating an amnesiac man and his connection to a serial bomber targeting shopping malls Los Angeles during Christmas the movie was cancelled.

===Non-altered films===
Some films released after 9/11 kept scenes of the WTC in them.
* &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; (2001) – Director Cameron Crowe retained shots of the buildings in the film&#x27;s final cut as a tribute despite the producers asking for them to be removed. Crowe told the Associated Press &quot;The idea of wiping them away by the computer — I couldn&#x27;t do it [...] They&#x27;ve already been taken away once; they&#x27;ll stay in the movie. Hopefully, the audience will understand it&#x27;s a tribute.&quot;
* &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; (2001) – The film contains scenes in which parts of a plane fall from the sky, and it has been suggested that the film&#x27;s darker themes were responsible for its poor box office, but it nonetheless went on to become a cult classic in the years following.
* &quot;Delivering Milo&quot; (2001) – The WTC is seen from Ellis Island, while he rides in the boat.
* &quot;Crazy Little Thing&quot; (2002) - Shots of the WTC remained in the film.
* &quot;Spider-Man – Once Upon a Time The Super Heroes!&quot; (2001 documentary) – A shot of the towers was retained as a tribute. It was not edited for the DVD release on June 17, 2002.
* &quot;A.I.: Artificial Intelligence&quot; (2001) – released less than three months before the attacks, a scene set thousands of years in the future which features a badly damaged WTC was not edited for its video release.
* &quot;Death to Smoochy&quot; (2002) – The North Tower is seen when Rainbow Randolph is dancing on the small bench in Duane Park. In the DVD commentary, Danny DeVito explained that it was the only shot in the movie that the WTC was in and he designed the shot. This movie was filmed from January to May 2001, four months before the 9/11 attacks.
* &quot;City by the Sea&quot; (2002) - The movie has some shots of the World Trade Center that were not edited out.
* &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; (2002) – The film ends with the New York City skyline containing the Twin Towers. The filmmakers had filmed the shot before the 9/11 attacks and later debated whether to have the towers dissolve out from the shot to signify their disappearance, or to remove the sequence entirely.
*&quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; (2001) – Several scenes where a bomb explodes at the United States Consulate General were not edited for its video release.
*&quot;It&#x27;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie&quot; (2002) – Although shot after the September 11th attacks, one scene set in a version of 2003 where Kermit was never born shows the Twin Towers visible in the background. This was due to the backdrop used in the film being created prior to the attacks. Years after the film&#x27;s release, this detail gained viral attention, inspiring jokes that the creation of Kermit the Frog somehow indirectly led to 9/11.

==Television==
===News coverage===
The television coverage of the September 11 attacks and their aftermath was the longest uninterrupted news event in U.S. television history, with the major U.S. broadcast networks on the air for 93 continuous hours. From the moment the news was broadcast that the first plane hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center, all programs and commercials were suspended, with all four networks broadcasting uninterrupted news coverage. At the end of the night, Nielsen estimated that at least 80 million Americans watched the evening news, while an estimate by the University of Georgia held that about two billion people either watched the attacks in real time or through the news.

The September 11 attacks were also the first time since the assassination of John F. Kennedy that television networks announced that there would be no television commercials or programs for an indefinite period of several days after the attacks, since it was widely felt that it was an inappropriate time for &quot;fun and entertainment&quot; programs to be shown when so much death and destruction was being seen live on television. During the week of the attacks, the networks&#x27; evening news broadcasts nearly doubled its average viewership audience, and it was estimated that American adults watched an average of eight hours of television a day, nearly doubling the average viewership audience. To keep up with the constant flow of information, many news networks began running continuous updates in a news ticker, which soon became a permanent fixture of many networks.

On the day of the attacks and afterwards, news broadcasters scrambled to report accurate information, though erroneous information was occasionally broadcast. An examination of CNN&#x27;s coverage of September 11, 2001 (which was replayed online, virtually in its entirety, on the fifth anniversary of the attacks in 2006) revealed that after the attack on the Pentagon, the network had also reported that a fire had broken out on the National Mall, and that according to a wire report, a car bomb had exploded in front of the State Department. It also broadcast an interview with a witness to the Pentagon attack who said it was a helicopter (not a plane) that hit the building. CNN was not alone in airing these or similar inaccurate reports, as subsequent examinations of coverage by other networks has shown.

====Reaction of various networks====
* The major television stations in New York City provided local coverage of the World Trade Center attacks, though primarily through local cable systems, as their transmission facilities atop the WTC were destroyed, and they had to deal with six station engineers killed in the attacks.
* As WCBS-TV&#x27;s and WXTV&#x27;s transmitting facilities were atop the Empire State Building at the time, their signals remained accessible over the air.
* Some cable networks suspended normal programming and simulcast news coverage from other networks. For example, Viacom-owned VH1 and MTV simulcast the feed from corporate sibling CBS, and Disney-owned ESPN and ESPN2 utilized the feed from corporate sibling ABC.
* Some cable networks continued broadcasting their regularly scheduled programming without interruption, particularly those geared toward children&#x27;s entertainment, such as Nickelodeon and AOL Time Warner-owned Cartoon Network. Several other networks such as Food Network, HGTV, along with shopping channels QVC and HSN, paused programming to display still images conveying sympathies and condolences.
* At 12:00 pm, Brazil&#x27;s Rede Globo broadcast a special edition of Jornal Hoje (afternoon national newscast). Normally the program would air after local newscasts and a sports news show. When Jornal Hoje ended, Globo decided to restart its normal programming for the second time, with occasional breaks for the news division to announce updates about the situation.
* At 8:15 pm, Jornal Nacional (Globo&#x27;s evening newscast) started a special edition. The program broke the record of most-watched newscast of the year. According to official numbers later released, for each 100 televisions being watched at the time, 74 were tuned into Jornal Nacional. The special edition had William Bonner and Fátima Bernardes as hosts and had the participation of correspondents in New York (live), Washington DC, London and Beirut. Correspondent Jorge Pontual was praised by critics after a memorable report right by the WTC. In October 2002, that edition of the Jornal Nacional was nominated for the 30th International Emmy Awards.

====Use of pictures====
When asked for her thoughts on the attacks, First Lady Laura Bush stated that &quot;we need to be very careful about our children&quot;. She warned parents not to let their children see the frightening images of destruction in a constant loop, and recommended that parents turn off the television and do something constructive, reassuring, and calming with their children.

===Programming===
The most immediate impact to television was the loss of David Angell, a co-creator and co-executive producer from the NBC show &quot;Frasier&quot;, who with his wife, was among the passengers on American Airlines Flight 11.

In the United States, the start of the 2001–2002 television season was put on hold due to the extensive news coverage (several series, such as NBC&#x27;s &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot;, were originally scheduled to debut on September 11), with mid-September premieres delayed until later in the month. Late-night talk shows such as &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; were also off the air; Letterman was already dark for the week for a pre-season vacation. Even after regular programming resumed, several talk shows remained off the air for several more days as writers and hosts determined how best to approach the sensitive situation. David Letterman was quoted on CNN as questioning whether he would even continue hosting his show. Ultimately, Letterman, Jay Leno, Jon Stewart, and other talk show hosts based in New York and Los Angeles returned to the airwaves with emotional initial broadcasts, with Letterman punctuating his thoughts by asking his audience how the attacks &quot;made any goddamn sense.&quot; This was the second of four instances where the start of the television season was delayed due to issues outside of the control of the major television networks; the other instances were the 1988–89 season (as a result of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike) the 2020–21 season (due to television production being halted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), and the 2023–24 season (as a result of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike and 2023 SAG-AFTRA strikes).

Several television series, most notably &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;Third Watch&quot;, produced special episodes addressing the attacks; &quot;Third Watch&quot; devoted an episode to interviewing first responders, many of whom were advisors to the series, while &quot;West Wing&quot; presented an off-continuity episode in which the characters discuss an unspecified but similar attack with a group of students. &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and its spinoff series all began their fall season premieres with a tribute to the victims. Shows such as the military based &quot;JAG&quot; and &quot;Third Watch&quot; (a series about New York City first responders) made major changes to their ongoing storylines to incorporate the event&#x27;s aftermath. The season eight premiere of the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; was dedicated to the &quot;people of New York City&quot;. Characters in the HBO crime drama &quot;The Sopranos&quot; discussed the attacks in several episodes, and the overall mood of the show became darker; the Twin Towers were also removed from the opening credits. The HBO show &quot;Sex and the City&quot; removed the twin towers from its title sequence in the next season. &quot;Alias&quot;, a series set within the espionage world that debuted in the fall of 2001, began adding references to terrorism and the Department of Homeland Security (an entity created after 9–11).

On September 17, 2001, &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; host Bill Maher&#x27;s guest Dinesh D&#x27;Souza disputed President George Bush&#x27;s label of the terrorists being &quot;cowards&quot;, saying that the terrorists were warriors. Maher agreed and, according to a transcript, replied, &quot;We have been the cowards, lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away. That&#x27;s cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building, say what you want about it, it&#x27;s not cowardly.&quot; The comments were widely condemned, and the show was cancelled the following June, which Maher and many others saw as a result of the controversy; however, ABC denied that the controversy was a factor, and said the show was cancelled due to declining ratings. Maher said that the show struggled for advertisers in its final months.

&quot;Family Guy&quot; creator and animator Seth MacFarlane was going to board Flight 11 to Los Angeles, but missed his flight due to drunkenness the night before.

====Delayed or cancelled entertainment awards shows====
* The 53rd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards, scheduled for September 16, were delayed to October 7. However, the United States began to bomb Afghanistan on that day, and the Emmy Awards were again postponed. They finally aired on November 4, with a somewhat somber atmosphere after surviving rumors of cancellation. Due to the delay, the event was relocated from the originally scheduled Shrine Auditorium venue to the smaller Shubert Theatre. The 2006 drama &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot; featured flashbacks to this time, where two of the characters on the show were fictionally nominated for awards at this event.
* The 2nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards, which was scheduled for September 11, was cancelled immediately after the attacks. After many discussions about rescheduling the ceremony, The Latin Recording Academy determined it would be impossible to do so. Instead, the winners were announced at a press conference on October 30 at the Conga Room. The cancellation of the event cost the organizers an estimate of $2 million in losses. Some of the winners were acknowledged at the 44th Grammy Awards. Furthermore, the attacks influenced the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences to hold the 2003 Grammy Awards ceremony in New York City as part of the &quot;healing process&quot;.

The postponements and cancellations of various entertainment programs sparked rumors that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were postponing or even canceling the 74th Academy Awards ceremony. However, in a written statement released by president Frank Pierson, he denied any rumors that the attacks would affect the scheduling of the awards presentation saying that &quot;the terrorists will have won&quot; if they cancelled it. Nevertheless, the show went on as planned on March 24, 2002. The security was much tighter than in previous years, and the show had a more somber tone. According to &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, there were 26 references to the attacks during the telecast. On October 16, 2006, the awards event itself was designated a National Special Security Event by the United States Department of Homeland Security.

Reflecting the significant and enduring impact of September 11 on popular culture, months and years after the attacks, events were still impacted, with the 2003 Grammy Awards being held at Madison Square Garden instead of Staples Center as planned. Blockbuster Entertainment terminated their awards ceremony permanently shortly after the second delay of the Emmys.

====Other changes====
* 13 of the first 30 episodes of &quot;Power Rangers Time Force&quot; edited some of its footage after 9/11 due to some scenes sharing higher resemblance to the attacks.
* The &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; episode &quot;Paris&quot; had a joke about the Taliban&#x27;s destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan removed from its original broadcast on September 14, 2001. However, the material was restored on home media and streaming versions of the episode.
* The second episode of the first season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; was originally scheduled to air on September 12, but was delayed to September 19 as CBS cleared the week&#x27;s schedule to cover 9/11&#x27;s aftermath. Host Phil Keoghan admitted that he doubted the show would be renewed since he didn&#x27;t believe there would be demand for a reality show centered on traveling in the immediate aftermath. Casting director, Lynne Spillman, and television producer, Ghen Maynard, however, stated that they believed the series acted as a celebration of the modern world, the joys of travel, and a chance to see different cultures and were confident it would last. In addition, Season 2 of the Amazing Race was in process of location scouting in September 2001, but it was paused until late October. Season 2&#x27;s filming was initially planned to start in November 2001, but was delayed to January 2002.
* The was initially planned to premiere in mid-September, but was delayed to October 11th. In addition, the (which would be filmed from November to December 10th) was initially planned to take place in Jordan. The producers had scouted the area for months, planned challenges, and had been cleared for filming by King Abdullah II who personally approved of the project. After 9/11, Producer Mark Burnett deemed the political climate in the Middle East to be too tense and the filming location was changed to the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia. 
* The &quot;101 Dalmatians: The Series&quot; episode, &quot;Alive N&#x27; Chicken&quot;, was pulled from circulation due to a scene centering around Spot Chicken flying a contraption into a windmill with the Dalmatians on top with the contraption falling into a sack of flour. The episode, along with &quot;Prima Doggy&quot; had been banned for less than nineteen years until the ban was finally lifted in June 2020, when the show became available on Disney+.
* In the &quot;Friends&quot; episode &quot;The One Where Rachel Tells...&quot;, Chandler and Monica could not get on their flight for their honeymoon because Chandler joked about a bombing in the airport. After the attacks, the story was rewritten and reshot. As the show was set in New York, a disclaimer reading &quot;Dedicated to the People of New York City&quot; was added to the end of the episode &quot;The One After &#x27;I Do&#x27;&quot;, which was the first episode of the series to be broadcast after the attacks. In several subsequent episodes, Joey and other members of the crew are seen wearing NYPD and FDNY apparel; Joey is seen wearing a T-shirt that says &quot;Captain Billy Burke&quot;, referring to an NYC firefighter who died in the attack.
* The opening credits of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;″s first three seasons featured a shot of the Twin Towers visible in Tony Soprano&#x27;s rearview mirror. It was replaced with a generic shot beginning in the show&#x27;s fourth season.
* New material was quickly added to PBS&#x27;s &quot;Sesame Street&quot; following the attacks to address issues raised. The first episode of the season involves a grease fire at Hooper&#x27;s Store which traumatizes Elmo until he meets some real-life firefighters. Big Bird has to deal with his xenophobic pen pal Gulliver, who does not believe birds should be friendly to other species.
* The syndicated version of the &quot;Married... with Children&quot; episode &quot;Get Outta Dodge&quot; features a scene of two Arabs with a ticking bomb at the front door of Al Bundy&#x27;s house offering to buy his Dodge clunker car for $40 and asking for directions to the Sears Tower.
* &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; had their opening credits modified at the start of their third season on September 28 to remove an establishing shot of the World Trade Center.
* A shot of the New York City skyline in the opening montage of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; was altered to remove the Twin Towers when the new season began on September 29. A shot of an American flag was also added.
* &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson&quot;, which premiered roughly four years before the attacks and was partially set at the World Trade Center, was temporarily pulled from syndication by some carriers. The episode later returned to syndication in 2006.
* In the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Road to Rhode Island&quot; (which aired a year before the attacks), Osama bin Laden distracts a security guard at the airport while the X-ray machine detects weapons. This scene was cut after the September 11 attacks and was also removed from the &quot;Family Guy: Volume 1&quot; DVD; however, the episode remains intact on the &quot;Family Guy: The Freakin&#x27; Sweet Collection&quot; DVD. The episode &quot;A Fish out of Water&quot; was originally scheduled to premiere on September 12, 2001, but was delayed to September 19 following the attacks.
* The &quot;King of the Hill&quot; episodes &quot;Propane Boom&quot; and &quot;Death of a Propane Salesman&quot; were temporarily pulled from syndication for the remainder of September, due to the depiction of the explosion of the Mega Lo Mart and the aftermath that followed, both episodes later returned to syndication in October 2001.
* The &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; episode &quot;Just One Bite&quot; originally featured a scene in which Squidward Tentacles attempts to get to the &quot;Patty Vault&quot; by bypassing the Krusty Krab&#x27;s security system, which consists of a bucket of gas and a match that eventually burns him. Despite this scene being removed after the episode&#x27;s initial broadcast on October 5, 2001, it remains distributed internally among the fanbase. The episode re-aired in 2002 with the original scene replaced with a zoom-in towards the &quot;Patty Vault&quot; in the back of the Krusty Krab. This change was initially thought to have been made either out of respect the victims of the September 11 attacks (which occurred less than a month before the episode aired), or to prevent children from attempting to use and/or ignite gas. However, in 2018, Vincent Waller confirmed on Twitter that it was ultimately due to Nickelodeon, the show&#x27;s network, being against the idea of a gag involving a match and gasoline.
* The &quot;Invader Zim&quot; episode &quot;Door to Door&quot; was delayed from airing in the United States and edited to remove some scenes of a burning city after an Irken invasion. While the unedited version of the episode was aired in Australia, only the edited version has been released on DVD.
* The &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; episode &quot;Malcolm&#x27;s Girlfriend&quot; originally had a subplot where Francis took refuge with a mad bomber in a remote Canadian cabin. The episode was to have guest starred Stacy Keach and the storyline was supposedly filmed, but due to the September 11 attacks it had to be re-filmed with a subplot involving Francis in an Alaskan prison witnessing a live soap opera.
* The &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; episode &quot;The Sky&#x27;s The Limit&quot; was temporarily removed from repeat showings due to the final scene showing a plane nearly crashing into Nelson Mandela House.
* According to the outtakes of &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; season 2, the director and other crew members put a flag sticker on the clapperboard during production as a tribute to the victims.
* &quot;Sex and the City&quot; had a theme change where the Empire State Building replaced the Twin Towers as the opening credits with the name of Sarah Jessica Parker being shown.
* &quot;The Zeta Project&quot; had almost been cancelled after season one due to the events of 9/11; however, season 2 was made on the caveat they cut the word &quot;terrorist&quot; and make it lighter in tone.

====TV shows with the WTC digitally added====
* &quot;Angels in America&quot;, set in 1985, had the WTC towers digitally re-inserted.
* &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, set primarily in 1973, shows a digitally-inserted World Trade Center in several episodes. The time traveling main character first realises he is in the past when he sees the WTC towers.
* &quot;Fringe&quot; depicted an intact World Trade Center in a parallel universe. The buildings were revealed in the finale of season one.
* The episode &quot;Adrift&quot; from the ABC series &quot;Lost&quot; added the World Trade Center in the second airing of the episode in order to establish the timeframe of the flashback.
* &quot;&quot; showed the Twin Towers in two episodes: one with the Grammys as Selena Quintanilla was with her husband Chris Perez and sister Suzette, along with the latter&#x27;s husband. Another episode called &quot;When All the World is Sleeping&quot; had the same towers seen again, but not before Selena&#x27;s death.

====Non-altered shows====
* Reruns of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; showed the Twin Towers on Game Show Network, especially the nighttime scene, during the opening.

==Music and radio==
* Program directors from radio stations throughout the United States retooled their playlists in response to the attacks. Common changes included the heavy rotation of songs such as &quot;God Bless the USA&quot; by Lee Greenwood and Whitney Houston&#x27;s rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; from Super Bowl XXV. Meanwhile, songs such as U2&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, Drowning Pool&#x27;s &quot;Bodies&quot;, and Dave Matthews Band&#x27;s &quot;Crash Into Me&quot; were excluded from playlists. Additionally, Clear Channel (now known as iHeartMedia) came under scrutiny for distributing a list of 150 potentially sensitive songs that were not recommended for broadcast immediately after the attacks, including every Rage Against the Machine song.
* NPR&#x27;s weekly comedic news quiz show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; did not record or broadcast a show for the weekend of September 15–16.
* Christian rap metal band P.O.D. released their album &quot;Satellite&quot; on September 11, 2001, spurring success for the album and its lead single &quot;Alive&quot;, which was seen as having a positive message in the aftermath of the attacks. Other bands associated with genres such as nu metal and rap metal experienced a downturn in sales due to the attacks; these genres continued to decline in popularity in the following years.
* Thrash metal band Slayer released their album &quot;God Hates Us All&quot; on September 11, 2001. Due to the name of the album and its lyrical themes and content, it has been interpreted by some as a premonition of the attacks. 
* According to Arrogant Worms band member Trevor Strong, the song &quot;Worst Seat on the Plane&quot; was never performed live due to &quot;Idiot Road&quot; (the album it was featured on) being released on September 18, 2001.
* American alternative rock band Jimmy Eat World voluntarily changed the name of their album &quot;Bleed American&quot;, which was released on July 18, 2001, out of concern that the title may be misinterpreted. It was re-released as the eponymous &quot;Jimmy Eat World&quot;, and its title track was renamed &quot;Salt Sweat Sugar&quot;. In 2008, a deluxe version of the album was released, reverting both the album and song to their original &quot;Bleed American&quot; title.
* Hungarian composer Robert Gulya, who lived in the United States from 2000 to 2002, began to work on a guitar concerto shortly after the September 11 attacks. Gulya chose a theme for the concerto&#x27;s first movement, which is reminiscent of the terror attacks. 
* The cover artwork of Dream Theater&#x27;s live album &quot;Live Scenes from New York&quot;, released on September 11, 2001, originally depicted the skyline of New York City in flames. The album was recalled and re-released with a different cover. The band later performed &quot;Sacrificed Sons&quot; on the album &quot;Octavarium&quot; as a tribute to the victims of the attacks. Keyboardist Jordan Rudess even did the album &quot;4NYC&quot; as a charity album for the tragedy. The band changed the name of one song from their 2002 album &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot;: &quot;The Great Debate&quot;, which discusses stem-cell research controversies, was originally titled &quot;Conflict at Ground Zero&quot; based on the lyrics in the chorus, but was renamed as news reports began to refer to the site of the attacks as &quot;Ground Zero&quot;. The band was in a Manhattan studio conducting final mixes of the album on the day in question.
* English rock band Bush changed the name of the lead single off their 2001 album &quot;Golden State&quot; from &quot;Speed Kills&quot; to &quot;The People That We Love&quot;. Also changed was the original cover art for the album, which featured a commercial airplane.
* The San Francisco Symphony continued with a previously planned program of Mahler&#x27;s 6th Symphony, the &quot;Tragic,&quot; on September 12–15. The subsequent recording was highly acclaimed and garnered the 2003 Grammy Award for Best Orchestral Performance.
* Janet Jackson postponed a concert in Tampa, Florida, scheduled for the day, and cancelled the entire European leg of her All for You Tour due to travel concerns after the attacks.
* Before the 9/11 attacks, American DJ and media personality Khaled Mohamed Khaled often referred to himself as &quot;DJ Khaled - The Arab Attack&quot; before dropping the tag line out of concern about offending victims.
* The American compact disc release of The Strokes&#x27; debut album, &quot;Is This It&quot;, was delayed from September 25 to October 9 and had its track list amended, with the song &quot;New York City Cops&quot; being removed and replaced with the newly written track &quot;When It Started&quot;.
* Hip-hop band The Coup&#x27;s album &quot;Party Music&quot; originally featured art depicting two of the band&#x27;s members apparently bombing the World Trade Center, and was scheduled for release in September 2001. The album was delayed to November so the band could create new cover art.
* In London, the last night of the BBC Proms summer concert series, on Saturday September 15, was greatly toned down from its usual noisy and bombastic celebration, with major program revisions including the removal of John Adams&#x27;s &quot;Short Ride in a Fast Machine&quot;.
* The music video the song &#x27;Piece by Piece&#x27; by welsh band Feeder was changed. The original video depicted animated characters of the band playing in a New York skyscraper with the World Trade Center in the background and planes flying nearby.
* The lyrics for Sean Altman&#x27;s accapella song &quot;Zombie Jamboree&quot; was changed from &quot;There&#x27;s a high-wire zombie between the World Trades&quot; to &quot;There&#x27;s an accapella zombie singing down Broadway&quot;.

==Theme parks==
* The Walt Disney World attraction &quot;The Timekeeper&quot;, a 360-degree film presentation that featured a panoramic view of New York City (including the Twin Towers) closed on September 11, 2001, and updated the scene of New York City so that the titular character was sent to 2000, a year before the attacks, which caused all references to the WTC to be removed. The attraction closed five years later.

==Sports==
Many major sporting events in North America were cancelled. These included:
* National Football League (NFL): In the wake of the attacks, the NFL&#x27;s week 2 games (September 16 and 17) were postponed and rescheduled to the end of the regular season (the weekend of January 6 and 7, 2002). The playoffs began 5 days later on January 12 and ended on February 3, 2002, with the Super Bowl, making it the first time the NFL&#x27;s championship game was played in the month of February.
* Major League Baseball (MLB): Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig called off games for one day, extended cancellations for three days, then eventually postponed all games through September 16, 2001. The New York Mets&#x27; home series against the Pittsburgh Pirates from September 17–19 was moved to Pittsburgh due to security concerns, with the Mets functioning as the series&#x27; designated home team. The games were tacked onto the end of the regular season, delaying the postseason until October 9. As a result, the 2001 World Series became the first World Series to extend into November. This was the third time in MLB history that games were cancelled due to war or national security reasons. Games were previously cancelled on D-Day, and the 1918 season was shortened due to World War I.
* All Minor League Baseball championship series were cancelled. Teams that had led their respective series were awarded league championships, or teams which were scheduled to play in such series (such as the Midwest League, which utilizes half-season championships to position the championship series) were awarded co-championships.
* The Major League Soccer (MLS)&#x27;s final two weeks of the 2001 season were cancelled, with some teams only playing 26 or 27 matches instead of the planned 28. The playoffs, whose spots were already decided, were played as scheduled, beginning on September 20 and ending with the MLS Cup on October 21.
* The remaining three matches of the 2001 Women&#x27;s U.S. Cup, featuring the United States women&#x27;s national soccer team, were cancelled.
* NCAA Division I college football games originally scheduled to be played on September 13 and 15, 2001 were called off.
* USA Cycling cancelled the BMC Software Tour of Houston, a key event in that year&#x27;s Pro Cycling Tour that had been scheduled for September 16. The decision was made in spite of athletes, staff, and equipment being actively en route to Houston from the inaugural San Francisco Grand Prix, which was held on September 9.
* The Félix Trinidad vs. Bernard Hopkins world Middleweight championship boxing fight, which was to take place on September 15 at Madison Square Garden in New York, was postponed until September 29 due to the attacks. Also, a wrestling show was cancelled at the Madison Square Garden around the same date.

The following sports events were delayed:
* The UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup matches that were scheduled for September 12 and 13 were postponed to October 10 and September 20, 2001, respectively. Matches scheduled on the September 11 proceeded for logistical reasons, with a minute&#x27;s silence observed and black armbands worn at the matches.
* World Wrestling Entertainment, then named the World Wrestling Federation, had a live taping scheduled for the upcoming episode of SmackDown! on September 11, 2001, however due to the events of September 11th, the taping was delayed until September 13, 2001, in Houston, Texas. The live episode of SmackDown was the first large public assembly since the attacks. 
* NASCAR delayed the 2001 New Hampshire 300, moving the race (and the entire weekend) from September 16 to November 23, 2001. Several cars ran American flag themed liveries for the race, which was won by Robby Gordon.

Sporting events that were not delayed despite the attacks include:
* The 2001 American Memorial was a Championship Auto Racing Teams motor race held four days after the attacks at the EuroSpeedway Lausitz. It was not delayed, but was renamed from &quot;German 500&quot; by CART following the aftermath of the attacks.
*Formula One&#x27;s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile, announced that the 2001 Italian Grand Prix would proceed as scheduled. Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo said that his team would approach the race as a normal racing event instead of a traditional Ferrari festival. Furthermore, di Montezemolo stated Formula One should continue its normal schedule and not cancel races. The Automobile Club d&#x27;Italia urged fans and spectators to behave &quot;in keeping with the gravity of the situation and in collective participation in the pain of American citizens.&quot; Podium celebrations were cancelled and all pre-race ceremonies including a flypast by the Italian Tricolour Arrows display team were called off. Three teams altered their car&#x27;s liveries as a mark of respect. Ferrari stripped their cars of all advertising and painted their nose cones black, Jaguar fitted black engine covers to their R2 cars on Saturday morning, and Jordan sponsor Deutsche Post replaced its branding with the American flag on the Jordan cars&#x27; engine covers on Sunday morning. Michael Schumacher was reluctant to take part in the race, and said in 2002 that he felt it was a &quot;bad sign&quot; to be driving after the September 11 attacks.

==Video games==
* The release of blockbuster title &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; was delayed almost a month to make last-minute changes, since the game was set in a city loosely based on New York City. Development was also delayed due to Rockstar&#x27;s offices being based near Ground Zero. The paint scheme of the city&#x27;s police cars was changed from a blue-and-white design reminiscent of the New York City Police Department to a black-and-white design reminiscent of the Los Angeles Police Department. Other relatively minor changes included altering an AI plane&#x27;s flight path which went near skyscrapers, and removing a few lines of pedestrian dialogue and talk radio.
* &quot;Syphon Filter 3&quot;&#x27;s cover art was changed before release. It originally had Gabe Logan, viewed from an angle, pointing a gun at the camera with a look of anger while Lian swung into frame, guns a-blazing and with the American flag prominently displayed. It was changed to a generic head-view of Gabe and Lian.
* Activision delayed the release of &quot;Spider-Man 2: Enter: Electro&quot; in order to remove the Twin Towers and 9/11 references.
* Neversoft quickly edited the Airport level in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot; a month prior to its release as it previously depicted a terrorist plot involving a bombing of a passenger airplane. The terrorists were instead reskinned as pickpockets and certain objectives renamed for sensitivity reasons.
* An art designer for the PlayStation 2 game &quot;Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies&quot; realized an image that was about to release on the game&#x27;s promotional website, depicting a battleship sinking near a populated cityscape, looked similar to the smoke plume from the Twin Towers&#x27; collapse. The designer discussed this with the staffer in charge of the website, and erased the city buildings from the image. Namco also suspended its broadcast of a Japanese TV spot for the game.
* &quot;Eternal Darkness: Sanity&#x27;s Requiem&quot; was delayed as Joseph De Molay, a Templar Knight during the crusades, was removed from the game. Textures that had Arabic writing were also removed.
* &quot;Metal Wolf Chaos&quot; was not localized into other languages and remained unreleased outside of Japan due to the political climate that followed the attacks. However, it was eventually re-released worldwide as &quot;Metal Wolf Chaos XD&quot; in 2019.
* &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;, a blockbuster title which was released in North America and Japan two months after the attack, featured the Pentagon and the World Trade Center during its climax. After the Sept. 11 attacks, a scene showing the destruction of the Statue of Liberty and parts of Manhattan was cut from the game. Dialogue about terrorists targeting Manhattan was also removed.
* The Game Boy Advance game &quot;Advance Wars&quot; was delayed in Europe, Japan, and Australia after having been released in North America. The game would release in Australia in 2001, Europe in 2002, and Japan in 2004.
* The Dreamcast game &quot;Propeller Arena&quot; was completed and due to be released on September 19, 2001, but was cancelled and never officially released. The video game was about dogfighting in planes and one level takes place around a city of skyscrapers.
* The Xbox launch game &quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot; depicted the World Trade Center in the background on its initial box cover art, which was already printed to retailers as display cases. After the attacks, the artwork was altered before the game was released.
* The PlayStation 2 game &quot;Savage Skies&quot; was originally conceived as a licensed tie-in game based on the music and likeness of heavy metal musician Ozzy Osbourne under the name &quot;Ozzy&#x27;s Black Skies&quot; with a song written specifically for the game called &quot;Black Skies&quot;. Developer iRock Interactive was later forced to drop the Osbourne branding and retool the game as &quot;Savage Skies&quot; both due to concerns about the game&#x27;s original title and premise being in poor taste in the aftermath of the attacks as well as licensing expenses, finally releasing the game in 2002; Osbourne would later include the song &quot;Black Skies&quot; as a bonus track on the single &quot;Dreamer&quot;.
* During its development, &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; featured an airplane crashing into a high-rise apartment, which was cut following the attacks.

==Other==
* An advertisement published in 1979 (21 years before 9/11), in several French magazines for Pakistan International Airlines and their flights between Paris and New York showed a photograph of a flying jetliner&#x27;s shadow projected onto the Twin Towers. When this image was rediscovered on the internet in the years after the attacks, it was noted for its coincidental use of imagery invoking the attack, particularly for the fact that Osama bin Laden hid in Pakistan and was later shot and killed there in 2011.
* &quot;Mad&quot; magazine&#x27;s issue No. 411 was already at the printer with a gag front cover depicting the mascot Alfred E. Neuman having taken a wrong turn away from the New York Marathon route (an event occurring in October, when the issue was to be released) and jogging into a murder scene, where he cluelessly broke through yellow crime scene tape in triumph. The cover, which depicted downtown Manhattan and a corpse, was no longer appropriate in light of the September 11 attacks, but the magazine had just one deadline day to produce a replacement cover. This was accomplished with a closely cropped headshot of Neuman, with his trademark tooth gap filled in by a small American flag.
* The 2001 Boshears Skyfest was cancelled due to closed airspace following the attacks.
* Broadway theatre went dark until September 13, 2001, when shows resumed with dimmed marquees.
* Toys &quot;R&quot; Us in Times Square sold a Barbie doll exclusive to this location in 2001. The initial release featured a depiction of the Twin Towers on its packaging, but was revised to remove them following the September 11 attacks.
* Mattel&#x27;s Max Steel toyline was censored in its packaging because people noticed a similarity between the action figure of the Max Steel villain, Vitriol, with the 9/11 attacks, the description of the back of the box said Vitriol was going to attack the World Trade Center, this was also worsened by the fact the character was a terrorist, the back of the Vitriol action figure&#x27;s box was later censored by Mattel, as well as other action figures at the time such as Max Steel himself and the cyborg villain Psycho, who was also a terrorist as well, a toy helicopter was removed from US stores as well. 
* George Carlin&#x27;s 17th album and twelfth HBO stand-up special, &quot;Complaints and Grievances&quot;, originally given the working title &quot;I Kinda Like It When a Lot of People Die,&quot; was heavily reworked and retitled following the September 11 attacks.

<doc id="490572" wikidata="Q849328" url="?curid=490572" title="Contra (video game)">
<text>is a 1987 run and gun video game developed and published by Konami for arcades. A home version was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988, along with ports for various home computer formats, including the MSX2. The arcade and computer versions were localized as Gryzor in Europe, and the NES version as Probotector in the PAL region.

The arcade game was a commercial success worldwide, becoming one of the top four highest-grossing dedicated arcade games of 1987 in the United States. The NES version was also a critical and commercial success, with &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; awarding it for being the Best Action Game of 1988. Several &quot;Contra&quot; sequels were produced following the original game.

==Gameplay==
===Overview===
&quot;Contra&quot; employs a variety of playing perspectives, which include a standard side view, a pseudo-3D view (in which the player proceeds by shooting and moving towards the background, in addition to left or right) and a fixed screen format (in which the player has their gun aimed upwards by default). Up to two people can play simultaneously, with one player as Bill (the blond-haired commando wearing a white tank top and blue bandana), and the other player as Lance (the shirtless dark-haired commando with a red bandana).

===Controls===
The controls consists of an eight-way joystick and two action buttons for shooting (left) and jumping (right). When one of the protagonists jumps, he curls into a somersault instead of doing a conventional jump like in other games. The joystick controls not only the player&#x27;s movement while running and jumping, but also his aiming. During side view stages, the player can shoot leftward, rightward or upward while standing, as well as horizontally and diagonally while running. The player can also shoot in any of eight directions, including downwards, while jumping. Pressing the joystick downwards while standing will cause the character to lie down on his stomach, allowing him to avoid enemy fire and shoot low targets. When the jump button is pressed while crouching on a higher platform, the character will drop down to a lower level.

===Weapons===
The player&#x27;s default weapon is a rifle with unlimited ammunition that can be upgraded into one of four other guns. These can be obtained by destroying the pill box sensors and flying item capsules containing them, or by defeating the red-clad guards in the enemy bases. These consist of a machine gun that fires rapidly when the fire button is held down, a laser gun that shoots a powerful beam, a fireball gun that shoots its rounds in a corkscrew pattern, and a spread gun that shoots five individual bullets in individual directions. There are also two auxiliary power-ups that only appear in certain areas when the character is armed: a rapid-bullets upgrade that increases the firing speed of the gun&#x27;s shots and a barrier that makes the character invulnerable for a limited period. With the exception of the machine gun and the laser gun, each item comes in the form of a Falcon-shaped symbol marked with a letter representing its function (F, S, R, and B).

===Player lives===
The player loses a life if their character (Bill or Lance) comes into contact with enemies or their missiles, fails to complete a base stage before the time limit, or falls into a bottomless pit. When that happens, the character will revert to his default weapon on his next life. After losing all lives, the player can continue by inserting more coins (if necessary) and pressing Start, but only up to three times. A second player can join in anytime, but if one player loses all of their lives, they must wait until the other player loses their lives as well to continue together.

===Stages===
The arcade version of &quot;Contra&quot; consists of seven stages (the number of stages and level structures vary in later versions). The first stage is a side-scrolling level where the player character is dropped into the jungle and must fend off the enemy&#x27;s initial line of defense until he reaches the entrance of the first base, where he must destroy a large sensor to enter the base. The game switches to a 3D view for the second stage, where the player character must fight his way through a series of passageways inside the base before time runs out (a display at the top of the screen shows the map of the base and the time remaining). The player must destroy a generator at the other side of each passageway in order to deactivate the electric current preventing access. The third stage is set in the core of the base in a fixed screen, where the player must destroy the enemy&#x27;s defense system in order to expose the final target, a giant eyeball that shoots fireballs.

Stages 4 through 6 proceed similarly to the first three stages. Stage 4 is a vertically-scrolling level where the player must jump their way to the top of a waterfall until reaching the entrance of the second base, where the player must destroy a large diamond-shaped sensor guarded by a defense system in order to clear the stage. Stage 5 is another 3D stage set inside another base, while Stage 6 is another boss battle, this time against a pair of heads that split into two images each. The heads can only be damaged when their split images align together.

The seventh and final stage returns to the side-scrolling format of the first stage, as the player fights through the enemy&#x27;s final line of defense (which includes a hovercraft, armored trucks, and giant helmeted soldiers) while proceeding through areas such as a snowfield, an energy plant and a hangar, to eventually reach the alien&#x27;s lair, where the regular enemy soldiers are replaced with otherworldly creatures. The player must fight a giant alien head that spawns larvae from its mouth before reaching the final target, a cardiac creature that must be destroyed in order to complete the mission.

===Releases===
The arcade game was released in three versions. The Japanese and American versions are virtually identical, aside from the Japanese version using kanji characters to spell the game&#x27;s title. However, the European version, titled &quot;Gryzor&quot;, only allows two players to play the game alternating rather than simultaneously.

==Plot==
&quot;Contra&quot; is set in the distant future of the year 2633 A.D., when the evil Red Falcon Organization have set a base on the fictional Galuga archipelago near New Zealand in a plot to wipe out humanity. Two commandos, Bill Rizer and Lance Bean of the Earth Marine Corp&#x27;s Contra unit (an elite group of soldiers specializing in guerrilla warfare), are sent to the island to destroy the enemy forces and uncover the true nature of the alien entity controlling them.

===Differences in the US release===
The promotional materials for the US arcade version downplays the futuristic setting of the game, with the manual for the later NES and home computer versions changing the game&#x27;s setting from the future to the present day and the location from Galuga to the Amazon Jungle.

==Release==
===Home computers===
Under license from Konami, Ocean Software produced ports under the title of &quot;Gryzor&quot; (the European arcade title) for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Amstrad CPC, which were released in Europe in 1988. The Commodore 64 version was released in North America under the &quot;Contra&quot; title. Ocean&#x27;s ports were patterned after the original arcade version of the game. An IBM PC version was developed by Banana Development Inc and released in North America. This version was released in Europe under the &quot;Gryzor&quot; name. The cover illustration of Ocean&#x27;s &quot;Gryzor&quot; ports by Bob Wakelin was inspired by the then upcoming film &quot;Predator&quot; starring actor Arnold Schwarzenegger . The illustration was later used for the packaging of the NES version. The Japanese MSX2 version had an exclusive photo cover; despite that, Wakelin&#x27;s illustration was used in the back cover. The other character was inspired by the 1982 film &quot;Rambo starring actor Sylvester Stallone.&quot;

===Nintendo Entertainment System===
&quot;Contra&quot; was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in February 1988. This version was produced in-house by Konami, and features several differences from the arcade release in order to better suit the NES&#x27;s hardware. This version was released for arcades by Nintendo in 1988.

====Graphics====
For example, sprites for effects (like explosions) are shown at 30fps instead of 60fps to work around the sprite limitations of the system. Another game to use this technique is &quot;Recca&quot;.

The game can be played by one or two players, but due to the graphical limitations of the NES, Bill and Lance lost their individualized character designs. Instead, they are both depicted as shirtless commandos distinguished by the colors of their pants (blue for Bill and red for Lance). When one player loses all of their lives, they are given the option to use the other player&#x27;s stock to keep fighting.

====Weapons====
The power-up icons for the Machine Gun and Laser Gun were also changed and are now represented by letter-based falcon symbols (M and L) used by the other weapons. The Rapid Bullets and Barrier power-ups are also more common in this version, since unlike the arcade game, the flying item capsules now appear regardless of which weapon the player character currently possesses. The NES version introduces a seventh item that clears the screen of all on-screen enemies when obtained.

====Reworked Stages====
The NES version recomposes the seven stages of the arcade version into eight stages. Stages 2 and 3 were combined into one stage, resulting in the renumbering of the Waterfall level from Stage 4 to Stage 3, while Stages 5 and 6 were combined into the new Stage 4. The final four stages of the NES version (the Snowfield, Energy Zone, Hangar, and Alien Lair) are based on the different areas featured in the arcade version&#x27;s final stage.

The level designs themselves are drastically different from the arcade version too. The two base stages for example (Stage 2 and 4), no longer have their mazelike structures, nor is there any time limit involved. The boss of the waterfall stage was also changed from a diamond-shaped sensor to an alien statue.

====The Konami Code====
&quot;Contra&quot; was one of the early NES games to feature the Konami Code. Inputting the code at the title screen starts the player with thirty lives instead of the usual three. The cheat remains in effect when the player runs out of lives and uses a continue to retry a stage.

===Famicom version===
&quot;Contra&quot; was released for the Famicom in Japan on February 9, 1988. While the gameplay remains identical to the NES version released around the same month, the Famicom version has a custom-made Multi-Memory Controller that Konami produced called the VRC2 (in contrast to the UNROM board used by its NES counterpart). This allowed for the inclusion of cutscenes and a few graphical effects that were not possible in the NES version. Additionally, the Famicom version contains cutscenes, an additional music track, and environment effects which are not included in the NES version.

The game begins with a prologue sequence explaining the game&#x27;s backstory, followed by a map of the Galuga archipelago, which is shown at the start of every stage to indicate the player&#x27;s progress. Cutscenes are also shown between stages, depicting Bill (or Lance) giving a status report of his current situation to headquarters, and, in later stages, shooting his gun towards the screen.

The ending sequence is also slightly different. And if the player holds the select and start buttons during the credits sequence, a secret message will be displayed after the Konami logo. Other differences include the addition of a sound test mode, added background animations in certain stages (such as windblown palm leaves in Stage 1 and a snowstorm in Stage 5), a different stage clear jingle when the player clears the final stage, and a level select cheat code.

===PAL version===
Probotector is a modified version of the NES &quot;Contra&quot; that was released for the PAL region on December 28, 1990. This version redesigns the human protagonists and some of the enemy characters to give them a robotic appearance. This was done to circumvent the BPjM&#x27;s censorship laws in Germany, which prohibits the sales of violent video games to minors. Subsequent &quot;Contra&quot; games for home consoles followed suit, all being released in the PAL region under the &quot;Probotector&quot; title and featuring similar modifications. Beginning with &quot;&quot;, Konami abandoned the &quot;Probotector&quot; title and localized most of the further games with minimal changes.

===MSX2===
An MSX2 version of &quot;Contra&quot; was released by Konami exclusively in Japan on May 26, 1989. The MSX2 version greatly differs from the arcade and NES versions. Due to hardware limitations of the MSX2, the game does not scroll but instead uses flip-screens like other MSX2 games such as &quot;Metal Gear&quot; and &quot;Vampire Killer&quot;. The game uses the SCC sound chip.

Rather than one-hit kills, there is an energy gauge, which allows Bill Rizer to take more than one shot or hit before losing a life. There are two main power-ups in the MSX2 version, a Falcon-shaped power-up that increases the player&#x27;s running and shooting speed, as well as a gun-shaped power-up which allows the player to change their current weapon. After picking up the weapon power-up, the player can choose between the default Normal Gun or four other weapons. The Spread Gun is not featured in this version, replaced by the Rear Gun similar to the tailgun in &quot;Gradius II&quot;, which fires in two directions at the same time.

The MSX2 version &quot;Contra&quot; is composed of 19 stages. Stages 1 through 6 are drawn directly from the arcade version, whereas Stages 7 through 9 are based on the different areas featured in the final stage of the arcade version in a matter similar to the final four stages of the NES version. Stages 10 through 19 are new to this version and take place primarily in an underground facility underneath the Galuga Archipelago.

Unlike the arcade and NES versions, the MSX2 version is single-player only (Lance Bean does not appear in any form), and has no continuation feature; if a player loses all lives, the game will end immediately. However, the Game Master II utility cartridge can be used to save progress via its S-RAM backup feature.

==Reception==
In Japan, the arcade game topped the &quot;Game Machine&quot; chart for table arcade cabinets in April 1987. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Gryzor&quot; was a blockbuster hit in the arcades and the home computer versions topped the Gallup charts. In the United States, &quot;Contra&quot; became one of the top four highest-grossing dedicated arcade games of 1987, and then the 1988 Nintendo Entertainment System port became and remained widely popular and remembered. Much of the game&#x27;s popularity came from its two-player simultaneous co-op gameplay.

The arcade game received generally favorable reviews from critics upon release. Peter Shaw of &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; called &quot;Gryzor&quot; one of his &quot;favourite&quot; games at the time. Clare Edgeley of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; said &quot;Lots of shooting and no time for a breather makes &quot;Gryzor&quot; one hell of a tiring game to play.&quot;

The NES version received a positive reception from critics. Arnie Katz, Bill Kunkel and Joyce Worley of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; called &quot;Contra&quot; on the NES &quot;a truly outstanding action epic&quot; set on a &quot;scrolling and beautifully drawn playfield&quot;. Japanese gaming magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave the Famicom (NES) version of the game a score of 27 out of 40. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; awarded it for being the Best Action Game of 1988. &quot;AllGame&quot; editor Skyler Miller praised &quot;Contra&quot;, touting that the game &quot;became the standard by which future platform shooters would be judged&quot;. The MS-DOS version of the game received a negative review in &quot;Dragon&quot; by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column in 1989; they criticized Konami&#x27;s copy protection which prevented the game from booting up on their computer.

In 2004, the NES version of &quot;Contra&quot; was inducted into GameSpot&#x27;s list of the greatest games of all time. &quot;Contra&quot; was voted by gaming website IGN as being the &quot;Toughest Game to Beat&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; ranked it as the seventh best NES game, calling it one of the best multiplayer NES games. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; listed the NES version as the 45th best console video game of all time, similarly saying that it &quot;set the standard for all two-player simultaneous action games to follow.&quot; &quot;GamesRadar&quot; ranked it the 10th best NES game ever made, considering it possibly superior to the arcade version. &quot;Game Informer&quot; also included it in their list of best games ever at number 13. The staff noted that while not revolutionary, it was fun. In 2017, &quot;Contra&quot; ranked 82nd in &quot;The Scientifically Proven Best Video Games of All Time&quot;, a statistical meta-analysis compiled by Warp Zoned of 44 &quot;top games&quot; lists published between 1995 and 2016.

==Legacy==
&quot;Contra&quot; was followed by &quot;Super Contra&quot; later the same year. It is the only &quot;Contra&quot; sequel for the arcades developed in-house by Konami. Following the success of the NES adaptations of both the original and its sequel (which was retitled &quot;Super C&quot; in its American release), subsequent sequels were produced specifically for the home console market such as &quot;Contra III: The Alien Wars&quot; for the Super NES and &quot;&quot; for the Genesis, becoming one of Konami&#x27;s flagship series. , the series has 13 installments.

The music from the arcade version of &quot;Contra&quot; is one of the soundtracks included in the video game album &quot;Konami Game Music Vol.4: A Jax&quot;, which was released by Alfa Records on May 10, 1988, in CD (catalog no. 28XA-201), cassette (ALC-22922), and vinyl (ALR-22922).

In April 2017, Beijing Starlit Movie and TV Culture announced they were producing a live-action film version of &quot;Contra&quot; in China. Wei Nan is listed as the screenwriter. The project was scheduled for release on June 6, 2018, but it did not meet that release date.

While the Konami code was first introduced with the home versions of &quot;Gradius&quot;, larger awareness of the code&#x27;s existence in Konami&#x27;s games grew significantly with its inclusion in the home versions of &quot;Contra&quot; (where it gave the player 30 extra lives to help complete the difficult game).

A board game adaptation was developed by Blacklist Games and Kess Co. and was released in 2022.

<text>One More Car, One More Rider is the eighth live album by Eric Clapton, released on 5 November 2002 on Duck / Reprise Records. It is also his third double live album. The album contains songs performed during Clapton&#x27;s 2001 world tour. The recordings on this album are from two nights at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, 18 &amp; 19 August 2001. Accompanying Clapton on this album are guitarist Andy Fairweather-Low, drummer Steve Gadd, bassist Nathan East and keyboardists Billy Preston, Greg Phillinganes and David Sancious (who also plays guitar and melodica). Clapton claimed that this would be his last world tour, making this album initially more valuable. However, he has since toured the world several times, both on his own and with Steve Winwood.

There is also a DVD version of this album. The DVD features &quot;Will It Go Round in Circles&quot; sung by Billy Preston, which is not included on the CD. The DVD was directed by Brian Lockwood and Danny O&#x27;Bryen.

The album was released on vinyl for the first time on Record Store Day in 2019, on Limited Edition 3-LP clear vinyl. The first 4 songs of the CD were on side one, with 3 songs on each of the other 5 sides of the 3 albums, the full 19 songs from the 2-CD set appearing across the 6 sides.

<doc id="490585" wikidata="Q932795" url="?curid=490585" title="Kumite">
<text>Kumite (, literally &quot;grappling hands&quot;) is one of the three main sections of karate training, along with kata and kihon. Kumite is the part of karate in which a person trains against an adversary.

Kumite can be used to develop a particular technique or a skill (e.g. effectively judging and adjusting one&#x27;s distance from one&#x27;s opponent) or it can be done in competition.

==Types==

Since the word &quot;kumite&quot; refers to forms of sparring, it covers a vast range of activities. In traditional Shotokan karate, the first type of kumite for beginners is &quot;gohon kumite&quot;. The defender steps back each time, blocking the attacks and performing a counterattack after the last block. This activity looks nothing like the &quot;jiyu kumite&quot; (or &quot;free sparring&quot;) practiced by more advanced practitioners.

Types:
* &quot;Ippon kumite&quot; - one step sparring, typically used for self-defense drills
* &quot;Sanbon kumite&quot; - three-step sparring, typically used to develop speed, strength, and technique
* &quot;Gohon kumite&quot; - five-step sparring, pre-arranged attack and counter exercises
* &quot;Kiso kumite&quot; - structured sparring drawn from a kata
* &quot;Jiyu kumite&quot; - free sparring
* &quot;Jiyu ippon kumite&quot; - one step semi-free sparring
*Iri Kumi - free sparring in Okinawan dialect, used in Gōjū-Ryū
*Jiyu Kobo - old version of Jiyu Kumite in Uechi-Ryū used by Uechi Kanbun&#x27;s Wakayama dojo

==Delivering strikes==

Many schools feel it is important that karateka &quot;pull their punches&quot;. Karate training is designed to give its practitioners the ability to deliver devastating power through techniques like punches and kicks. Often the aim of training is that each single strike should be enough to subdue the opponent. However, this clearly would make it difficult to train due to the possibility of injury. Many beginners, while sparring, will be instructed to develop control and accuracy first, then speed and power later. In doing this, it may seem like the student is pulling his punches, when actually, he is developing technique first. For injury purposes, certain targets are discouraged, like strikes to the knee and face contact for low ranks. Many schools prohibit strikes to the groin, while others allow it completely. Some schools might limit contact to light contact all around, while others may employ power usage at higher grades.

All types of sparring allow the martial artist to develop both control and experience in delivering powerful strikes against an opponent. In full contact karate, punches are often &quot;pulled&quot; to some slight extent in training, to minimize the occurrence of injuries that would interrupt practice. However, some karate schools use protective gear in free sparring, so that strikes can be delivered closer to their full power. Most karate clubs and most styles of karate combine some controlled full-contact sparring and some sparring with protective gear (from gloves to feet pads and up to full head and even chest guards such as in taekwondo). 

However, a few more traditional clubs that never use protective gear for sparring (except groin and mouth guards that protect against accidental injuries) argue that a karateka will not be able to make their most powerful strike when sparring in the dojo (against a friend whom they no doubt do not want to injure) even if this opponent is wearing protective clothing. Therefore, the karateka will still be using some level of control, as is obviously necessary, and cannot truly capture the spirit of one lethal strike whilst sparring. Except for a life or death self-defense situation, the spirit and power of the single lethal strike can only be achieved when a karateka does not have to avoid injuring their training partner. The traditionalists therefore argue that there is no benefit to sparring with more forceful strikes.

However, in Kyokushin Karate no padding is used and fighters do not &quot;pull their punches&quot; as fights are finished by knockdown.

==Competition==
In some forms of competition kumite, punching (&quot;tsuki&quot;) and kicking (&quot;keri&quot;) techniques are allowed at the head (&quot;jodan&quot;) and abdomen (&quot;chudan&quot;). In some tournaments, face contact is allowed, sometimes limited to senior practitioners. One example of a scoring system is that the first competitor to take eight points in three minutes wins the bout.

Kumite is an essential part of karate training, and free sparring is often experienced as exciting, because both opponents have to react and adapt to each other very quickly.

In tournaments kumite often takes place inside of a &#x27;ringed&#x27; area similar to that of a boxing ring. If a karateka steps out of the ring, they are given a warning. If they step out of the ring two times, the other person gains a point. Many international tournaments use a &quot;point sparring&quot; form of kumite that requires control (&#x27;pulling punches&#x27;) and therefore warnings can be dealt for excessive force on techniques to the head, or sensitive areas. Full contact is permitted to the torso area of the body only. Some tournament rules allow for light contact to the head, whereas other rules do not allow this.

Kumite also includes a series of guidelines that, if followed correctly, result in a clean and safe fight. These are some of those guidelines:

*A karateka must remain in some form of proper fighting stance and in the &quot;kamae-te&quot; position (hands up, ready to fight position)
*A karateka must be aware of all obstacles around him/her
*A karateka must never deliberately endanger themselves by turning their back to their opponent
*A practiced and well trained karateka must concentrate on stance and footwork

For the last point about stance and footwork: it is often taught that a karateka who wishes to be fast and agile while competing in kumite should always be &#x27;pulsing&#x27;. Pulsing is where the karateka remains almost bouncing on the balls of their feet to maintain minimal frictional contact with the ground, allowing them to move quickly.

Another aspect of kumite which is often seen in international tournaments, as well as many local competitions is what is referred to as clashing. Clashing is where both opponents throw techniques against each other at the same time, often resulting in both getting hit with the techniques. This creates a problem for referees as they are unable to make out which technique was quick, on target and recoiled - all the things that constitute a clean technique that is scored. Because of clashing, most modern day karateka are taught to practice kumite in a &#x27;one for one&#x27; situation where one attacks, then the other attacks and so on. However, due to the speed of these techniques, and the speed of the footwork of each karateka, to the casual observer it may appear that they are still clashing when in fact they are not. When opponents are considered to be clashing, the head referee should declare &quot;aiuchi&quot; which means &quot;simultaneous hit&quot;. When a winner is decided, the referee will announce &quot;~ no kachi&quot; which means &quot;~&#x27;s win&quot;.

The tournament rules of full contact or &quot;knockdown&quot; styles of karate often don&#x27;t award any points for controlled techniques delivered to the opponent. In fact, they usually don&#x27;t award points for full-force techniques delivered to the opponent either. Instead, points are only awarded for knocking, sweeping, or throwing your opponent to the floor. Kyokushinkai and its &quot;offshoot&quot; karate organizations are the styles usually known to promote knockdown tournament rules. They believe this type of tournament competition is closer to &quot;real life&quot; personal combat, although still in a tournament setting with rules.

There are three criticisms to date. First, is the quickness versus skill argument. The tournament fighter learns how to shoot in quickly but deliver an unimpressive strike that gains him or her a point. Also, the question of discoloration of face due to contact, which can allow for disqualification. It is often difficult to gauge the true intensity of the attack, so this could cause questioning. Last, it is seen as sport and sport alone. Traditionalists may dismiss it as &quot;useless&quot;, but modern dojos often band with other dojos to form organizations that utilize a tournament circuit as a way to promote their dojos.

== WKF Kumite Ruleset ==

International competition under the World Karate Federation (also known as the WKF) also includes the following point scoring:

: 1 point (&quot;YUKO&quot;): A straight punch to the face or torso of the opponent (but not to the back of their head or body) 
: 2 points (&quot;WAZARI&quot;): A kick delivered to the adversary&#x27;s torso (including the back, sides and front).
: 3 points (&quot;IPPON&quot; - A) : Any scoring technique (such as a stomp or punch) to a grounded opponent. A &quot;grounded opponent&quot; is defined by the WKF as having any body part (except for the feet) touching the ground, and includes an opponent who has been knocked down by a legal strike or swept/taken down. (Any sweep/takedown that is not followed up with a technique may be ruled to be a dangerous technique that can result in a warning against the instigator of that sweep/takedown.) OR a kick delivered to the head of a standing opponent.
If the opponent is rendered unable to continue the fight due to a legal technique, then the one who delivered this technique should be announced the winner of the bout by KIKEN (or forfeiture) of the fight.

Bouts are 3 minutes long for men, and 2 minutes long for Junior competitors and women. If, at any point during the bout, a competitor accumulates an 8 point lead over their opponent, or if their opponent is disqualified then they will also be declared as the winner of the fight.

Contact to the body is allowed from all ages during competition. When a competitor turns 16 years old, then they will be allowed a &quot;skin touch&quot; (light contact) to the opponents head for both punches or kicks, which stays the same from this age upwards. Prior to this age, no head contact is permitted whatsoever. Ages below 14 years old are required to stop their kicks at least 10 cm away from the opponents head, whereas during the ages between 14 years old and 16 years old, this distance is reduced to 5cm away from the head. Punches for both age groups must be stopped just before the head/ face and not make contact. As previously mentioned, light contact to the head/ face is permitted from the age of 16 years old and upwards.

The rule of KIKEN (or forfeiture) is commonly only found with blows to the body. If a (legal) punch or kick is delivered to the body, and causes an athlete to forfeit the bout (as they cannot continue), then the opposition is announced as the winner. When an athlete is legally downed (if they fall or are knocked down by their opponent) and does not immediately get up after the referee calls &quot;YAME&quot; (stop) then the referee will call for the tournament doctor and count to 10 out loud in English (identical to the 10 count in boxing) for the athlete to rise. If they do not rise within 10 seconds, then the opponent wins the bout by KIKEN (or forfeiture). However, blows to the head rarely ever win by forfeiture, as it is normally deemed as excessive contact which results in a disqualification. 

There are a list of 15 possible fouls or penalties recognised by the WKF; should a competitor receive a total of four of these warnings, then they will be disqualified from the match, or (depending on the severity of the offences) perhaps even the whole competition by the referee. A full, up to date list of competition regulations (including forbidden techniques) is available on the official WKF website.

<text>Bernard Taub Feld (December 21, 1919 – February 19, 1993) was a professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He helped develop the atomic bomb, and later led an international movement among scientists to banish nuclear weapons.

==Early life==
Feld was born in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from the City College of New York with a bachelor of science degree in 1939. He began graduate school at Columbia University, but suspended his studies to join the American war effort. He spent the war serving as an assistant to Enrico Fermi and Leó Szilárd working on the Manhattan Project. After World War II, he returned to Columbia University to receive his PhD in 1945 with thesis advisor Willis Lamb.

==Career==

Feld was on the faculty of MIT from 1948 until he retired in 1990. During this time, he was President of the Albert Einstein Peace Prize Foundation, editor of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and head of the American Pugwash Committee.

Feld was a Ford Foundation Fellow and a visiting scientist at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland.

The Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995. Feld was a leader in these conferences, serving as U.S. Chairman from 1963 to 1973 and as International Chairman from 1973 to 1978. It was in this role that he attracted the anger of Richard Nixon&#x27;s White House. He was eleventh on Nixon&#x27;s list of enemies, a fact that pleased him tremendously.

&quot;One month after the election of Ronald Reagan, Feld being an editor of &#x27;Bulletin of the American Atomic Scientists&#x27; reported that his publication had decided to move the hands on the Doomsday Clock featured on its cover from seven to four minutes to midnight, because, as &#x27;the year drew to a close, the world seemed to be moving unevenly but inexorably closer to nuclear disaster.&#x27; &quot;

<text>The Festival of Seven Herbs or Nanakusa no sekku () is the long-standing Japanese custom of eating seven-herb rice porridge (七草粥, &quot;nanakusa-gayu&quot;, lit. &quot;7 Herbs Rice-Congee&quot;) on January 7 (人日, &quot;Jinjitsu&quot;); one of the &quot;Gosekku&quot;.

==History==
The seventh of the first month has been an important Japanese festival since ancient times. Jingchu Suishiji, written in the Six Dynasties China, recorded the Southern Chinese custom of eating a hot soup that contains seven vegetables to bring longevity and health and ward off evil on the 7th day of the first month of the Chinese calendar. Since there is little green at that time of the year, the young green herbs bring color to the table and eating them suits the spirit of the New Year. The custom was present in Taiwan until the mid-Qing Dynasty, and is still present in parts of rural Guangdong province.

==Seven spring flowers==
The &quot;nanakusa&quot; (), or more specifically, &quot;haru no nanakusa&quot; (), spring&#x27;s seven flowers (or herbs), are seven edible wild herbs of spring. Traditionally, they are:

There is considerable variation in the precise ingredients, with common local herbs often being substituted.

On the morning of January 7, or the night before, people place the &quot;nanakusa&quot;, rice scoop, and/or wooden pestle on the cutting board and, facing the good-luck direction, chant &quot;Before the birds of the continent (China) fly to Japan, let&#x27;s get nanakusa&quot; while cutting the herbs into pieces. The chant may vary from place to place.

=== Musical accompaniment ===
==Seven autumn flowers==

The spring-time &quot;nanakusa&quot; are mirrored by &quot;aki no nanakusa&quot; (), meaning autumn&#x27;s seven flowers. They are listed below:

The seven flowers of autumn are bush clover (&quot;hagi&quot;), miscanthus (&quot;obana&quot;, &quot;Miscanthus sinensis&quot;), kudzu, large pink (&quot;nadeshiko&quot;, &quot;Dianthus superbus&quot;), yellow-flowered valerian (&quot;ominaeshi&quot;, &quot;Patrinia scabiosifolia&quot;), boneset (&quot;fujibakama&quot;, &quot;Eupatorium fortunei&quot;), and Chinese bellflower (&quot;kikyō&quot;, &quot;Platycodon gradiflorus&quot;). These seven autumn flowers provide visual enjoyment. Their simplicity was very much admired: they are small and dainty yet beautifully colored. They are named as typical autumn flowers in a verse from the Man&#x27;yōshū anthology.

Unlike their spring counterparts, there is no particular event to do anything about the seven flowers of autumn. The autumn flowers are not intended for picking or eating, but for appreciation, despite each one is believed to have medical efficacy in traditional Chinese medicine. Tanka and haiku theming &quot;hanano&quot; (, lit. flower field), meaning fields where the autumn wildflowers are in full bloom, have a centuries-old history.

==Cautionary note==
The Japanese parsley (&quot;Oenanthe javanica&quot;) species of the &quot;Oenanthe&quot; (water dropworts) genus is closely related to and easily confused with toxic water hemlock. Although accidental poisoning is rare, caution should be exercised when dealing with oenanthe species. As &quot;Oenanthe javanica&quot; is not found outside of Asia unless specifically cultivated, wild-growing varieties of water dropworts should be considered lethal, even in small amounts.

<text>or just is a fusion of the ancient Japanese belief in ancestral spirits and a Japanese Buddhist custom to honor the spirits of one&#x27;s ancestors. This Buddhist custom has evolved into a family reunion holiday during which people return to ancestral family places and visit and clean their ancestors&#x27; graves when the spirits of ancestors are supposed to revisit the household altars. It has been celebrated in Japan for more than 500 years and traditionally includes a dance, known as .

The festival of Obon lasts for three days; however, its starting date varies within different regions of Japan. When the lunar calendar was changed to the Gregorian calendar at the beginning of the Meiji era, the localities in Japan responded differently, which resulted in three different times of Obon. Traditionally, Obon was celebrated on the 15th day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar.

Obon is now observed during one of the following periods:

* July 15 of the Gregorian calendar (Shichigatsu Bon or &quot;Bon in July&quot;): Observed in Tokyo and some urban areas of the Tōhoku region and Hokuriku region regions where agricultural busy seasons do not overlap with the festival dates. This practice is sometimes referred to as &quot;Tokyo Obon.&quot;
* August 15 of the Gregorian calendar (Hachigatsu Bon or &quot;Bon in August&quot;; Tsukiokure Bon or &quot;Month Later Obon&quot;): This is the most commonly celebrated time across Japan.
* 15th day of the seventh lunar month (Kyū Bon or &quot;Old Bon&quot;): Observed in Okinawa and the Amami Islands, this version follows the lunar calendar, so the dates change yearly on the Gregorian calendar, sometimes extending into September.

These days are not listed as public holidays, but it is customary for people to be given leave.

==History of ==
The Japanese Obon Festival is heavily influenced by the Ghost Festival of Buddhism and the Chinese Taoist () Festival.

Before Buddhism came to Japan, there was already a custom in place to beckon the deceased home to their families twice a year, both in spring and autumn, on the night of the full moon. This custom already had a close connection to the ancestor-veneration characteristic it has in modernity.

The Buddhist tradition originates from the story of Maha Maudgalyayana (Mokuren), a disciple of the Buddha, who used his supernatural powers to look upon his deceased mother only to discover she had fallen into the Realm of Hungry Ghosts and was suffering. Greatly disturbed, he went to the Buddha and asked how he could release his mother from this realm. Buddha instructed him to make offerings to the many Buddhist monks who had just completed their summer retreat on the fifteenth day of the seventh month. Mokuren did this and, thus, saw his mother&#x27;s release. He also began to see the true nature of her past selflessness and the sacrifices she had made for him during her lifetime. The disciple, happy because of his mother&#x27;s release from suffering and grateful for her many kindnesses, danced with joy. From this dance of joy comes the or &quot;Bon Dance&quot;, a time during which ancestors and their sacrifices are remembered and appreciated. See also: Ullambana Sutra.

In recorded history, &quot;Obon&quot; was practised as a Buddhist tradition first under the reign of Empress Suiko (592—628). By 733, it seems to have been introduced as a customary Buddhist holiday in Japan within the court.

===Etymology===
The Japanese word is composed of the honorific prefix and the word . The portion is from the longer Japanese names or , in turn from the Chinese terms () or ().

The Chinese terms are often described as deriving from Sanskrit meaning &quot;hanging upside down&quot;, in reference to souls suffering in hell. However, the Sanskrit word was sparse, if at all, attested; in addition, it would be the present participle of verb Sanskrit (&quot;to hang&quot;, intransitive), with no inherent &quot;upside-down&quot; meaning.

Moreover, neither the purported meaning of &quot;hanging upside-down&quot; nor the verifiable meaning of &quot;hanging&quot; match the semantics very well, given that the ceremonies are about helping the dead, closer in meaning to the &quot;helping&quot; sense of the Pali verb (&quot;raising, helping&quot;), present participle of (&quot;to raise up, to help&quot;). This suggests that explanations of the dead hanging upside-down in hell are more likely to be folk etymologies based on a mistaken connection to the Sanskrit verb, rather than a more direct semantic link to the Pali. Alternatively, Takakusu Junjiro propounded that the origin was in fact Pali , a colloquial corruption of the Pali (&quot;raising up; saving; helping&quot;), and that the etymology was mistakenly attributed to Sanskrit.

== Practices ==


, meaning simply &quot;Bon dance&quot;, is a style of dancing performed during Obon. It is a folk entertainment, which has a history of nearly 600 years. Originally a folk dance to welcome the spirits of the dead, the style of celebration varies in many aspects from region to region. Each region has a local dance, as well as different music. The music can be songs specifically pertinent to the spiritual message of Obon, or local folk songs. Consequently, the Bon dance appears different from region to region. Hokkaidō is known for the folk-song . The song takes its namesake from the capital of Japan. in Gujō in Gifu Prefecture is famous for all night dancing. is a folk song from Shiga Prefecture. Residents of the Kansai area will recognize the famous . Tokushima in Shikoku is very famous for its , and in the far south, one can hear the of Kagoshima.
The way in which the dance is performed is also different in each region, though the typical Bon dance involves people lining up in a circle around a high wooden scaffold made especially for the festival called a . The is usually also the bandstand for the musicians and singers of the Obon music. Some dances proceed clockwise, and some dances proceed counter-clockwise around the . Some dances reverse during the dance, though most do not. At times, people face the and move towards and away from it. Still some dances, such as the Kagoshima dance, and the Tokushima , simply proceed in a straight line through the streets of the town.
The dance of a region can depict the area&#x27;s history and specialization. For example, the movements of the dance of the (the &quot;coal mining song&quot;) of old Miike Mine in Kyushu show the movements of miners, i.e. digging, cart pushing, lantern hanging, etc.; the above-mentioned mimics the work of fishermen such as hauling in the nets. All dancers perform the same dance sequence in unison.

There are other ways in which a regional Bon dance can vary. Some dances involve the use of different kinds of fans, others involve the use of small towels called which may have colourful designs. Some require the use of small wooden clappers, or , during the dance.

The music that is played during the Bon dance is not limited to Obon music and ; some modern hits and kids&#x27; tunes written to the beat of the are also used to dance to during Obon season.
The Bon dance tradition is said to have started in the later years of the Muromachi period as a public entertainment. In the course of time, the original religious meaning has faded, and the dance has become associated with summer.

The Bon dance performed in the Okinawa Islands is known as . Similarly, the Yaeyama Islands have .

=== Altar ===
The altar in Japanese households, &quot;kamidana&quot;, are given care by the families with decorations and offerings such as flowers and straw figures of animals and food. They do this not only for their own deceased but for the souls of the households who no longer have relatives within their vicinity. The offerings are placed in front of the tablets with the deceased person&#x27;s name on it.

=== Lights ===
Families who have lost a family member during a current year are known to give special attention to the preparations of &quot;Obon&quot;. They will light a small fire on the first evening of the festival to guide the souls back home. In the past people would lit a line of lights towards the cemetery to make sure the souls would find their way.
On the third day of the festivities the souls are sent back to the other side with fires to see them off, this is referred to as &quot;Okuribi&quot; (&quot;sending fire&quot;), or, in a larger scale, the Burning of the Character Big in the mountain. In this practice small lanterns are used that float down a river. This symbolises the way of the souls back to the world of the dead. Both these fires mark the commencement (mukaebi) as well of the closing of the festival.

=== Shōryō Uma and Ushi Uma ===
Another significant ritual practiced during the Obon festival in Japan is to craft a cucumber horse and eggplant cow, known as or , that act as a vessel for the ancestors to come back home and return, respectively.

=== Clothing ===
As Obon occurs in the heat of the summer, participants traditionally wear , a kind of light cotton kimono. Many Obon celebrations include a huge carnival with rides, games, and summer festival foods.

==Festivals of shared origin==

=== Buddhism ===
==== Korea ====
The Korean version of the Obon celebration is known as . Participants present offerings at Buddhist shrines and temples, and masked dances are performed. It is as much an agricultural festival as a religious one.

==== Vietnam ====
===Hinduism===
 (literally &quot;fortnight of the ancestors&quot;) is a 16–lunar day period in Hindu calendar when Hindus pay homage to their ancestors (), especially through food offerings. is considered by Hindus to be inauspicious, given the death rite known as or performed during the ceremony.

== Celebrations outside Japan ==
=== Philippines===
In the Philippines, Filipinos of Japanese descent, with support from the Philippine Nikkei Jin Kai Inc., Philippine Nikkei Jin Kai International School, Mindanao Kokusai Daigaku, and various other Japanese Filipino-based organizations, hold an Obon festival every year along with other Japanese-based Filipino festivals, to celebrate the ancestors of Filipinos of Japanese descent, and to celebrate the friendship between Japan and the Philippines.

=== Argentina ===
In Argentina, the Obon Festival is celebrated by Japanese communities during the summer of the southern hemisphere. The biggest festival is held in Colonia Urquiza, in La Plata. It takes place on the sports ground of the La Plata Japanese School. The festival also includes shows and typical dances.

=== Brazil ===

Obon Festival is celebrated every year in many Japanese communities all over Brazil, as Brazil is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan. São Paulo is the main city of the Japanese community in Brazil, and also features the major festival in Brazil, with street dancing and dance. It also features and contests. The festival also features a variety of Japanese food and drink, art and dance. Obon is also celebrated in communities of Japanese immigrants and their descendants and friends throughout South America: Obon festivals can be found in the states of Santa Catarina, São Paulo, Goiás, Amazonas, Pará (Tomé-Açu), Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Pernambuco, Bahia, Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul and Brasília.

=== Malaysia ===
In Malaysia, Obon Festival is also celebrated every year in Esplanade, Penang, Shah Alam Stadium in Shah Alam, Selangor, and also Universiti Malaysia Sabah at Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. This celebration, which is a major attraction for the state of Selangor, is the brainchild of the Japanese Expatriate &amp; Immigrant&#x27;s Society in Malaysia. In comparison to the celebrations in Japan, the festival is celebrated on a much smaller scale in Penang, Selangor and Sabah, and is less associated with Buddhism and more with Japanese culture. Held mainly to expose locals to a part of Japanese culture, the festival provides the experience of a variety of Japanese food and drinks, art and dance, with the vast number of Japanese companies in Malaysia taking part to promote their products.

=== United States and Canada ===
Obon festivals are also celebrated in North America, particularly by Japanese-Americans or Japanese-Canadians affiliated with Buddhist temples and organizations. Buddhist Churches of America (BCA) temples in the U.S. typically celebrate Obon Festival with both religious Obon observances and traditional dancing around a . Many temples also concurrently hold a cultural and food bazaar providing a variety of cuisine and art, also to display features of Japanese culture and Japanese-American history. Performances of taiko by both amateur and professional groups have recently become a popular feature of Bon Odori festivals. Obon festivals are usually scheduled anytime between July and September.

 melodies are also similar to those in Japan; for example, the dance from Kyushu is also performed in the U.S. In California, due to the diffusion of Japanese immigration, dances also differ from Northern to Southern California, and some are influenced by American culture, such as &quot;Baseball &quot;.
The &quot;Obon season&quot; is an important part of the present-day culture and life of Hawaii. It was brought there by the plantation workers from Japan, and now the Bon dance events are held among the five major islands (Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui and Hawaii) on weekend evenings from June to August. They are held usually at Buddhist missions, but sometimes at Shintoist missions or at shopping centres. At some Buddhist missions, the dance is preceded by a simple ritual where the families of the deceased in the past year burn incense for remembrance, but otherwise the event is non-religious. The songs played differ among the regions - one or two hour Bon dance in the Western part of the Big Island (in and around Kailua Kona), for example, typically starts with , continues with songs such as (using wooden clappers), (using given at the donation desk), and from Okinawa Prefecture (reflecting the fact that many Okinawan descendants live in Hawaii), for children, zumba songs for the young, &quot;Beautiful Sunday&quot;, etc., and ends with , celebrating abundant harvest. The participants, Japanese descendants and the people of all races, dance in a big circle around the , the central tower set up for the dance, from which recorded songs are broadcast and, most of the time, the group accompany the songs playing drums. In larger cities, Bon dance lessons are given by volunteers before the actual events.

Some Japanese museums may also hold Obon festivals, such as the Morikami Museum in Florida.

In St. Louis, Missouri, the Botanical Garden has hosted an Obon festival over Labor Day weekend every year since 1977. Known as the Japanese festival, it is a collaboration with several Japanese-American organizations, and hosts thousands of people over a three-day period. The festival provides authentic Japanese music, art, dance, food, and entertainment including dancing around a , sumo wrestling, drums, bonsai demonstrations, music played on traditional instruments, several bazaars, food courts with authentic Japanese foods, tea ceremonies, candlelit lanterns released on the lake in the gardens Japanese garden and much more.

In Salt Lake City, Utah, the Salt Lake Buddhist Temple holds an Obon festival in mid-July with food, temple tours, taiko performances, and a Japanese goods store.

<text>The king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) is the second largest species of penguin, smaller than but somewhat similar in appearance to the emperor penguin. 

King penguins mainly eat lanternfish, squid, and krill. On foraging trips, king penguins repeatedly dive to over , and have been recorded at depths greater than . Predators of the king penguin include giant petrels, skuas, the snowy sheathbill, the leopard seal, and the orca.

The king penguin breeds on the subantarctic islands at the northern reaches of Antarctica, South Georgia, southern Argentina, and other temperate islands of the region. It also lives on Macquarie Island in the Southern Ocean and the Falkland Islands.

This bird was exploited commercially in the past for its blubber, oil, meat, and feathers. Today it is fully protected.

==Taxonomy==
In 1778, the English illustrator John Frederick Miller included a hand-coloured engraving of the king penguin in his &quot;Icones animalium et plantarum&quot;. He coined the binomial name &quot;Aptenodytes patagonica&quot; and specified the type locality as the &quot;Mari antarctico&quot;, the Antarctic Ocean. The locality was restricted to South Georgia by Gregory Mathews in 1911. 

The International Ornithologists&#x27; Union considers the species monotypic, recognizing no subspecies. However, some taxonomic authorities recognize two subspecies, &quot;A. p. patagonicus&quot; and &quot;A. p. halli&quot;; in this system, &quot;patagonicus&quot; is found in the South Atlantic and &quot;halli&quot; in the South Indian Ocean (at the Kerguelen Islands, Crozet Island, Prince Edward Islands, and Heard Island and McDonald Islands) and at Macquarie Island.

==Appearance==

The king penguin stands at tall and weighs from . Although female and male king penguins look alike, they can be separated by their calls. Males are also slightly larger than females. The mean body mass of adults from Marion Island was for 70 males and for 71 females. Another study from Marion Island found that the mean mass of 33 adults feeding chicks was . The king penguin is approximately 25% shorter and weighs around a third less than the emperor penguin.

At first glance, the king penguin appears similar to the larger, closely related emperor penguin, with a broad cheek patch contrasting with surrounding dark feathers and yellow-orange plumage at the top of the chest. However, the cheek patch of the adult king penguin is a solid bright orange whereas that of the emperor penguin is yellow and white, and the upper chest tends to be more orange and less yellowish in the king species. Both have colourful markings along the side of their lower mandible, but these tend towards pink in emperor penguin and orange in king penguin.

Emperor and king penguins typically do not inhabit the same areas in the wild, with the possible exception of vagrants at sea, but the two can be distinguished from one another by the king&#x27;s longer, straighter bill, larger flippers, and noticeably sleeker body. The juvenile king penguin with its long bill and heavy dark brown down is completely different in appearance from the mostly grey emperor chick with its black and white mask. Once moulted of its brown juvenile plumage, the king chick resembles the adult, but is somewhat less colourful.

The king penguin often breeds on the same large circumpolar islands as other penguin species, but it is easily distinguished from other species by its much larger size and taller frame, colorful markings, and grizzled sooty-greyish rather than blackish back.

==Distribution and habitat==
King penguins breed on subantarctic islands between 45 and 55°S, at the northern reaches of Antarctica, as well as Tierra del Fuego (Argentinian part), the Falkland Islands, and other temperate islands of the region. The total population is estimated to be 2.23 million pairs and is increasing. The largest breeding populations are on the Crozet Islands, with around 455,000 pairs, 228,000 pairs on the Prince Edward Islands, 240,000–280,000 on the Kerguelen Islands, and over 100,000 in the South Georgia archipelago. 

By the early 1920s, the king penguin population in South Georgia and the Falklands was nearly wiped out by whalers on these islands. As the Falklands and South Georgia had no trees to use for firewood, the whalers burned millions of oily, blubber-rich penguins as fuel. Constant fires were required to boil whale blubber for extraction of the oil. The whalers also used penguin oil for lamps, heating and cooking, in addition to eating the birds and their eggs. Macquarie Island currently has around 70,000 pairs. The non-breeding range is unknown; many vagrant birds have been seen on the Antarctic peninsula as well as in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.

One of the largest known king penguin colonies, on Île aux Cochons in the Crozet Islands, experienced a massive drop in its population over the last few decades, from about half a million breeding pairs in the 1980s to about 60,000 breeding pairs in 2017. The cause of this decline may be changes in the ecosystem related to climate change as their primary source of food is moving farther away from places where the penguins can breed. This may result in population declines and shifts in the locations of the king penguin breeding grounds.

The Nature Protection Society released several king penguins at Gjesvær in Finnmark and Røst in Lofoten in northern Norway in August, 1936. Penguins were seen in the area several times during the 1940s; there were a few unconfirmed sightings of penguins in the area during the early 1950s, but none have been officially recorded since 1949.

==Ecology and behavior==

American zoologist Gerry Kooyman revolutionized the study of penguin foraging behaviour in 1971 when he published his results from attaching automatic dive-recording devices to emperor penguins, and recording a dive of by a king penguin in 1982. The current maximum dive recorded is 343 metres in the Falkland Islands region, and a maximum time submerged of 552 seconds was recorded at the Crozet Islands. The king penguin dives during daylight hours to depths of 100–300 meters (350–1000 feet), spending around five minutes submerged, and to less than at night.

The majority (around 88% in one study) of dives undertaken by king penguins are flat-bottomed; that is, the penguin dives to a certain depth and remains there for a period of time hunting (roughly 50% of total dive time) before returning to the surface. They have been described as U-shaped or W-shaped, relating to the course of the dive. The remaining 12% of dives have a V-shaped or &quot;spike&quot; pattern, in which the bird dives at an angle through the water column, reaches a certain depth, and then returns to the surface. In contrast, other penguins dive in this latter foraging pattern. Observations at Crozet Islands revealed most king penguins were seen within of the colony. Using the average swimming speed, Kooyman estimated the distance travelled to foraging areas at .

The king penguin&#x27;s average swimming speed is 6.5–10 km/h (4–6 mph). On shallower dives under , it averages descending and ascending, while on deeper dives over deep, it averages in both directions. King penguins also &quot;porpoise&quot;, a swimming technique used to breathe while maintaining speed. On land, the king penguin alternates between walking with a wobbling gait and tobogganing—sliding over the ice on its belly, propelled by its feet and wing-like flippers. Like all penguins, it is flightless.

===Diet===

King penguins eat various species of small fish, squid, and krill. Fish constitute roughly 80% of their diet, except in the winter months of July and August, when they make up only around 30%. Lanternfish are the main fish taken, principally the species &quot;Electrona carlsbergi&quot; and &quot;Krefftichthys anderssoni&quot;, as well as &quot;Protomyctophum tenisoni&quot;. Slender escolar (&quot;Paradiplospinus gracilis&quot;) of the Gempylidae and &quot;Champsocephalus gunneri&quot; are also consumed. Cephalopods consumed include those of the genus &quot;Moroteuthis&quot;, the hooked squid (&quot;Moroteuthopsis longimana&quot;), the sevenstar flying squid (&quot;Martialia hyadesii&quot;), young &quot;Gonatus antarcticus,&quot; and &quot;Onychoteuthis&quot; species.

=== Predators ===
The king penguin&#x27;s predators include other seabirds and aquatic mammals:
* Giant petrels take many chicks of all sizes and some eggs. They will also occasionally kill adult king penguins, but very likely mostly sick or injured birds. Giant petrels also scavenge adult king penguins and chicks which have died from other causes.
* Skua species (&quot;Stercorarius&quot; spp.) take smaller chicks and eggs. Some studies may have overstated the effect skua predation has on king penguin colonies, but large numbers of chicks and eggs are taken in areas where skua nest close to penguin colonies.
* The snowy sheathbill (&quot;Chionis alba&quot;) and kelp gull (&quot;Larus dominicanus&quot;) scavenge for dead chicks and unattended eggs.
* The leopard seal (&quot;Hydrurga leptonyx&quot;) takes adult birds and fledglings at sea.
* Orcas also hunt king penguins.
* Male and especially pre-adult male Antarctic fur seals on Marion Island have also been observed chasing, killing, and eating king penguins on the beach.

===Courtship and breeding===
The king penguin is able to breed at three years of age, although only a very small minority (5% recorded at Crozet Islands) actually do then; the average age of first breeding is around 5–6 years. King penguins are serially monogamous. They have only one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is less than 30%. The unusually long breeding cycle probably contributes to this low rate.

The king penguin has a prolonged breeding cycle, taking around 14–16 months from laying to offspring fledging. Although pairs will attempt to breed annually, they are generally only successful one year in two, or two years in three in a triennial pattern in South Georgia. The reproductive cycle begins in September to November, as birds return to colonies for a prenuptial moult. Those that were unsuccessful in breeding the previous season will usually arrive earlier. They then return to the sea for around three weeks before coming ashore in November or December.
The female penguin lays one pyriform (pear-shaped) white egg weighing 300 g (⅔ lb). It is initially soft but hardens and darkens to a pale greenish colour. It measures around . The egg is incubated for around 55 days with both birds sharing incubation in shifts of 6–18 days each. Like the closely related emperor penguin, the king penguin balances the egg on its feet and incubates it in a brood pouch.

Hatching may take up to 2–3 days to complete and chicks are born semi-altricial and nidicolous: they have only a thin covering of down, and are entirely dependent on their parents for food and warmth. The &quot;guard phase&quot; begins with the hatching of the chick. Like that of the emperor penguin, the young king penguin chick spends its time balanced on its parents&#x27; feet, sheltered in the brood pouch formed from the abdominal skin of the latter. During this time, the parents alternate every 3–7 days, one guarding the chick while the other forages for food. The guard phase lasts for 30–40 days. By then the chick has grown much larger and is better able to both keep warm and protect itself against most predators. King chicks are very curious and will wander far when exploring their surroundings. The chicks form a group called a crèche and are watched over by only a few adult birds; most parents leave their chick in these crèches to forage for themselves and their chick. Other species of penguins also practice this method of communal care for offspring.

By April, the chicks are almost fully grown but lose weight while fasting over the winter months, gaining it again during spring in September. Fledging then takes place in late spring/early summer.

King penguins form huge breeding colonies; for example, the colony on South Georgia Island at Salisbury Plain holds over 100,000 breeding pairs and the colony at St. Andrew&#x27;s Bay holds over 100,000 birds. Because of the long breeding cycle, colonies are occupied year-round with both adult birds and chicks. During breeding, king penguins do not build nests, although they show strong territorial behaviour and keep a pecking distance to neighbouring penguins. Penguin positions in breeding colonies are highly stable over weeks and appear regularly spaced.

The king penguin feeds its chicks by eating fish, digesting it slightly, and regurgitating the food into the chick&#x27;s mouth.

Because of their large size, king penguin chicks take 14–16 months before they are ready to go to sea. This is markedly different from smaller penguins, who rear their chicks through a single summer when food is plentiful. King penguins time their mating so the chicks will develop over the harshest season for fishing. In this way, by the time the young penguins are finally mature enough to leave their parents, it is summer when food is plentiful and conditions are more favorable for the young to survive alone at sea.

==Conservation==
===Impact of climate change===

70% of king penguins are expected to disappear in less than eighty years. Considered sensitive indicators of changes in marine ecosystems, king penguins serve as a key species for understanding the effects of climate change on the marine biome, especially throughout the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic areas.

King penguins primarily feed at the Antarctic Convergence, which provides 80% of their food biomass. King penguins currently travel 300–500 km over the course of over a week to complete the journey. However, ocean warming could easily move these fronts further away from breeding grounds. Continuous ocean warming could cause the convergence zone to move polewards, away from king penguin breeding sites like the Falklands and the Crozet Islands. It has been suggested that if carbon emissions continue to rise at their current rate, king penguins will need to travel an additional 200 km in order to reach their feeding areas. Breeding grounds will also suffer from the rise of emissions. Nearly half of the total population will likely lose their breeding grounds by the year 2100.

===Resource competition===
King penguins are also threatened by large-scale commercial fishing that could deplete their main source of food: myctophid fish. Over 200,000 tons of myctophid fish were commercially exploited by the beginning of the 1990s in the South Georgia region. Ongoing attempts to further develop this fishery for human consumption close to key penguin foraging areas are likely to have negative impacts on food provisioning.

===Research and management===

The Pew Charitable Trust recommends the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) implement &quot;large-scale, fully protected marine reserves in the waters surrounding Antarctica.&quot; The Trust also recommends precautionary management of the Antarctic krill fishery in order to protect king penguins&#x27; main source of food. The CCAMLR is made up of 24 countries (plus the European Union); among those are the United States and China, which have been withholding the authority to enact such protective measures. It has also been suggested that in conservation modeling, special attention be paid to the southernmost breeding locations, given the predicted rise in water temperature in the Southern Ocean, and that complete regular censuses of breeding populations be carried out to detect temporal trends and environmental changes.

The species is classified as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature&#x27;s Red List of Threatened Species. Since 2004, the IUCN has reported that the population size is large and has increased its breeding rates. Adult king penguins have maintained high survival rates since the 1970s. The steady population of king penguins is due largely to current conservation efforts to protect nesting habitats. Ecotourism and public access to all king penguin breeding sites are heavily restricted in order to prevent outbreaks of disease and general disturbance. All of the colonies in Crozet and Kerguelen Islands are protected under the oversight of the Reserve Naturelle Nationales des Terres australes et Antarctiques Françaises. South Georgian penguins reside in a &quot;special protected area within the Environmental Management Plan for South Georgia.&quot; And in the Falklands, all wildlife—including the king penguin—is protected under the Conservation of Wildlife and Nature Bill of 1999.

==Relationship with humans==
===In captivity===
The king penguin is considered a flagship species in zoos and aquaria, and 176 individuals were counted in captivity in North America in 1999. The species is exhibited at SeaWorld Orlando, Indianapolis Zoo, Detroit Zoo, Saint Louis Zoo, Kansas City Zoo, Newport Aquarium in Newport, Kentucky, Edinburgh Zoo and Birdland in the United Kingdom, Berlin Zoological Garden in Germany, Zurich Zoo and Zoo Basel in Switzerland, Diergaarde Blijdorp in the Netherlands, Antwerp Zoo in Belgium, 63 Seaworld in Seoul, South Korea, Melbourne Aquarium in Australia, Mar del Plata Aquarium in Argentina, Loro Parque in Spain and Ski Dubai in United Arab Emirates, Calgary Zoo and the  Montreal Biodome in Canada, Odense Zoo in Denmark, Asahiyama Zoo in Hokkaido, Japan, and many other collections.

===Notable king penguins===
* Major General Sir Nils Olav was the Edinburgh-based mascot and colonel-in-chief of the Royal Norwegian Guard.
* The king penguin is also the species of penguin represented by the popular character Pondus, an image found on various paraphernalia in many retail stores throughout Canada. Pondus originates in Danish children&#x27;s books written and photographed by Ivar Myrhøj and published in 1997 by Lademann publisher in the late 1960s. These penguins appeared in the production of &quot;Batman Returns&quot;.
* Lala the Penguin became a viral video star after an Animal Planet special featured him venturing to a nearby market in Japan to fetch a fish with a specially made backpack. Lala had been accidentally caught by a fisherman. The fisherman and his family nursed Lala back to health and then adopted him as a pet.
* Pesto (hatched 30 January 2024) is a king penguin living in Sea Life Melbourne Aquarium who gained notability in September 2024 due to his exceptionally large size.

<doc id="490610" wikidata="Q129784" url="?curid=490610" title="Sixth generation of video game consoles">
<text>In the history of video games, the sixth generation era (in rare occasions called the 128-bit era; see &quot;bits and system power&quot; below) is the era of computer and video games, video game consoles, and handheld gaming devices available at the turn of the 21st century, starting on November 27, 1998. &quot;Platforms&quot; in the sixth generation include consoles from four companies: the Sega Dreamcast (DC), Sony PlayStation 2 (PS2), Nintendo GameCube (GC), and Microsoft Xbox. This era began on November 27, 1998, with the Japanese release of the Dreamcast, which was joined by the PlayStation 2 on March 4, 2000, the GameCube on September 14, 2001 and the Xbox on November 15, 2001, respectively. The Dreamcast was among the first to be discontinued in 2001, followed by GameCube in 2007, Xbox in 2009, and PlayStation 2 in 2013. Meanwhile, the seventh generation of consoles started on November 22, 2005, with the launch of the Xbox 360.

The major innovation of this generation was of full utilization of the internet to allow a fully online gaming experience. While the prior generation had some systems with internet connectivity, such as the Apple Pippin, these had little market penetration and thus had limited success in the area. Services such as Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Live became industry standard in this, and future, generations. Other innovations of the Xbox was its being the first system with an internal ethernet port and the first to utilize an internal hard disk drive to store game data. This led to many improvements to the gaming experience, including the ability to store program data (rather than just save game data) that allowed for faster load times, as well as the ability to download games directly from the internet rather than to purchase physical media such as a disk or cartridge. Soon after its release other systems, like the Sony PlayStation 2, produced peripheral storage devices to allow similar capabilities, and by the next generation internal storage became industry standard.

Bit ratings (i.e. &quot;64-bit&quot; or &quot;32-bit&quot; for the previous generation) for most consoles largely fell by the wayside during this era, with the notable exceptions being promotions for the Dreamcast and PS2 that advertised &quot;128-bit graphics&quot; at the start of the generation. The number of &quot;bits&quot; cited in this way in console names refers to the CPU word size, and had been used by hardware marketing departments as a &quot;show of power&quot; for many years. However, there is little to be gained from increasing the word size much beyond 32 or 64 bits because, once this level is reached, performance depends on more varied factors, such as processor clock speed, bandwidth, and memory size.

The sixth generation of handhelds began with the release of Bandai&#x27;s WonderSwan, launched in Japan in 1999. Nintendo maintained its dominant share of the handheld market with the release in 2001 of the Game Boy Advance, which featured many upgrades and new features over the Game Boy. The Game Boy Advance was discontinued in early 2010. The next generation of handheld consoles began in November 2004, with the North American introduction of the Nintendo DS.

The last official Dreamcast games were released in 2002 (North America and Europe) and 2007 (Japan). The last GameCube games were released in 2006 (Japan) and 2007 (North America and Europe). The last Xbox games were released in 2006 (Japan), 2007 (Europe) and 2008 (North America). The last PlayStation 2 games were released in 2013; The last game released in Japan was &quot;Final Fantasy XI: Seekers of Adoulin&quot; in March, the last game released in North America was &quot;FIFA 14&quot; in September, and last game released in Europe was &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 2014&quot; in November, marking the end of this generation.

==Home systems==

The PlayStation 2 achieved sales dominance in this generation, becoming the best-selling console in history, with over 160 million units sold . The Microsoft Xbox had sold over 24 million units as of May 2006, and the GameCube had sold 22 million units as of September 2010. The Sega Dreamcast, which arrived prior to all of the others and was discontinued in 2001, came in fourth with 9.13 million sold.

The sixth generation began to end when the Xbox was succeeded by the Xbox 360 in late 2005. GameCube hardware was still being produced when the Wii was released in late 2006, but as of June 2008 had also been ceased. PlayStation 2 sales continued to be strong through to the end of 2010, due to the system&#x27;s large software library, continuing software support, and affordable price.

In February 2008, the PlayStation 2 outsold both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in the United States. Games were still being produced for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube as of 2008, while Dreamcast games were officially discontinued in 2003. There were still a few games being produced for the Dreamcast in 2004, but they are essentially NAOMI arcade ports released only in Japan, with small print runs. The PlayStation 2 was still being produced after the launch of the Wii U in 2012, making the sixth generation the second longest generation of all time.

===Dreamcast===

Sega&#x27;s Dreamcast is the first console of the generation and had several features to show an advantage from the competition, including Internet gaming as an optional feature through its built-in modem, and a web browser.

The console is credited with restoring Sega&#x27;s reputation, which had been damaged by the earlier failures of the Sega Saturn, Sega 32X, Genesis Nomad and Sega CD. Despite this, the Dreamcast was discontinued prematurely due to numerous factors. The impending and much-hyped PlayStation 2 slowed Dreamcast sales, mostly due to the fact that the PlayStation 2 had a built-in DVD player and a huge number of PS1 owners looking to upgrade to the new, backward compatible console. In addition, Sega&#x27;s short-lived support/success of its post-Mega Drive products the Mega-CD, 32X and Saturn had left developers and customers skeptical, with some holding out to see whether the Dreamcast or PlayStation 2 would come out on top.

Sega&#x27;s decision to implement a GD-ROM (though publicly advertised as a CD-ROM) for storage medium did save costs but it did not compare well against the PS2&#x27;s much-touted DVD capabilities. Sega was either unable or unwilling to spend the advertising money necessary to compete with Sony, who themselves took massive losses on the PlayStation 2 to gain market share. With the announcements of the Xbox and GameCube in late 2000, Sega&#x27;s console was considered by some to be outdated only two years after its release. The previous losses from the Saturn, 32X, and Sega/Mega-CD, stagnation of sales due to the PlayStation 2, and impending competition from Microsoft and Nintendo caused Sega&#x27;s revenue to shrink and announce their intention on killing the system in early 2001, dropping the system entirely and leaving the console market in early 2004 in Japan and much earlier in other countries. Sega also announced it would shut down SegaNet, an online gaming community that supported online-capable Dreamcast titles. Due to user outcry over the decision, Sega delayed the service&#x27;s closure by an additional 6 months. Since the Dreamcast&#x27;s discontinuation, Sega transitioned to software developing making games as a third-party company.

===PlayStation 2===

The brand Sony had established with the original PlayStation was a major factor in the PlayStation 2&#x27;s dominance, both in terms of securing a consumer base and attracting third-party developers, with the gradual increase in one reinforcing the other. The PlayStation 2 was also able to play DVDs and was backward compatible with PlayStation games, which many say helped the former&#x27;s sales. Sony Computer Entertainment secured licensing for key games such as &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, and &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;, enabling the PS2 to outperform its competitors&#x27; launches. The console ended up becoming the top-selling console of this generation, while its competing consoles, the Xbox and the GameCube, went on to be modestly successful consoles.

===GameCube===

Nintendo struggled with conflicting brand images, particularly the family-friendly one developed during the 1990s. Its arsenal of franchises and history in the industry, though earning it a loyal fan base, failed to give it an advantage against the Xbox and PlayStation 2 which captured audiences seeking &#x27;Mature&#x27; titles of which Nintendo had fewer. Nintendo also made little headway into online gaming (releasing a small handful of online-capable games, the most popular of which was &quot;Phantasy Star Online Episode I and II&quot;, which was an enhanced port of the Dreamcast game with various new features and content), instead emphasizing Game Boy Advance connectivity. As a result, the GameCube failed to match the sales of its predecessor, the Nintendo 64, but the console wasn&#x27;t a financial failure. Nintendo did however rejuvenate its relationship with many developers, often working in close collaboration with them to produce games based upon its franchises, in contrast to the past where it was frequently seen as bullying developers in the late 1980s, back when the Nintendo Entertainment System was out on the market. As a result, the GameCube had more first and second party releases than its competitors, whose most successful titles were mainly products of third-party developers.

===Xbox===

Although the Xbox had the formidable financial backing of Microsoft, it was unable to significantly threaten the dominance of the PlayStation 2 as market leader. However, the Xbox attracted a large fanbase and strong third-party support in the United States and Europe and became a recognizable brand amongst the mainstream. The Xbox Live online service with its centralized model proved particularly successful, prompting Sony to boost the online capabilities of the PlayStation 2. Xbox Live also gave the Xbox an edge over the GameCube, which had a near-total lack of online games. The flagship of Xbox Live was the game &quot;Halo 2&quot;, which was the best-selling Xbox game with over 8 million copies sold worldwide. However, the Xbox failed to gain a following in Japan, with reasons cited including lack of brand recognition, lack of commitment to the console from Japanese publishers and developers, failure of Microsoft staff to fully understand important cultural differences, and ethnocentric preferences of the Japanese public for native products.

=== Comparison ===
===Worldwide sales standings===

===Other consoles===
These consoles were created for the mass market, like the 4 consoles listed above. However, they are less often noted, never saw a worldwide release, and/or have sold fewer units overall, and are therefore listed as &#x27;Other&#x27;.
==Bits and system power==
Bit ratings for consoles largely fell by the wayside after the fifth generation (32/64-bit) era. The number of &quot;bits&quot; cited in console names referred to the CPU word size, but there was little to be gained from increasing the word size much beyond 32 bits; performance depended on other factors, such as central processing unit speed, graphics processing unit speed, channel capacity, data storage size, and memory speed, latency, and size.

The importance of the number of bits in the modern console gaming market has thus decreased due to the use of components that process data in varying word sizes. Previously, console manufacturers advertised the &quot;&quot;n&quot;-bit talk&quot; to overemphasize the hardware capabilities of their system. The Dreamcast and the PlayStation 2 were the last systems to use the term &quot;128-bit&quot; in their marketing to describe their capability.

It is not easy to compare the relative &quot;power&quot; of the different systems. Having a larger CPU word size does not necessarily make one console more powerful than another. Likewise, the operating frequency (clock rate, measured in terms of Hertz) of a system&#x27;s CPU is not an accurate measure of performance either, except between systems of the same or similar architecture.

The Microsoft Xbox uses a 32-bit (general purpose) CISC x86 architecture CPU, with an instruction set equal to that of the Coppermine core Mobile Celeron, though it has less cache (128 kB) than the PC equivalent. It has 64 MB RAM (shared) and runs at 733 MHz. Because the Pentium 3 introduced SSE, the Xbox also had 128-bit SIMD capabilities. Its &quot;NV2A&quot; GPU, which is very similar to the GeForce 3 series of desktop GPUs, makes it the only console in its time with traditional vertex and pixel shaders.

The GameCube&#x27;s CPU is a PowerPC CPU codenamed Gekko that runs at 485 MHz and was built by IBM. Its graphics processor, codenamed &quot;Flipper&quot;, is comparable to the original ATI Radeon. The console has 43 MB of non-unified memory (24 MB of 1T-SRAM, 3 MB embedded 1T-SRAM, and 16 MB DRAM).

The PlayStation 2&#x27;s CPU (known as the &quot;128-bit Emotion Engine&quot;) has a 64-bit core with a 32-bit FPU. Coupled to two 128-bit Vector Units, this hybrid R5900 CPU is based on MIPS architecture. The PS2 also has an internal 10 Channel DMA Bus which is fully 128 bits wide. Paths between the Emotion Engine, RAM and the Graphics Synthesizer (GS) are also 128 bits wide. The PS2&#x27;s unique hardware arrangement with no less than 10 processing units were difficult to come to grips with. Many developers struggled initially with programming the hardware. The PS2&#x27;s Graphics Synthesizer (GS) has fast dedicated video memory, though it is limited in the amount of data it can hold. The 10 Channel 128 bit wide DMA bus could pump data to GS Memory as fast as the screen could update. Consequently, with the main memory being limited to 32MB, many of the PS2&#x27;s games have reduced textures compared with versions for other consoles. It also does not have a hardware dedicated transform and lighting unit like the ones found in the Xbox and GameCube GPUs.

However the PS2&#x27;s design allows a remarkable degree of flexibility and choice. For example, program control and general arithmetic could be handled by the CPU, while the Vector Units 0 and 1, could provide parallel processing of physics, clipping and transform and lighting to the scene. The Vector units were noted to be so versatile that &quot;Shadow of The Colossus&quot; used one of the vector units to do full Pixel shading for the fur of the Collossi.

The Dreamcast features a SuperH-4 32-bit reduced instruction set computing (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA) using 16-bit fixed-length instructions, alongside a 64-bit double-precision superscalar unit, a 64-bit data bus allowing a variable width of either 8, 16, 32 or 64-bits, and a 128-bit floating-point bus. The PowerVR 2DC CLX2 chipset uses a unique method of rendering a 3D scene called Tile Based Deferred Rendering (TBDR): while storing polygons in triangle strip format in memory, the display is split into tiles associated with a list of visibly overlapping triangles onto which, using a process similar to ray tracing, rays are cast and a pixel is rendered from the triangle closest to the camera. After calculating the depths associated with each polygon for one tile row in 1 cycle, the whole tile is flushed to video memory before passing on to render the next tile. Once all information has been collated for the current frame, the tiles are rendered in turn to produce the final image.

==Handheld systems==
During the sixth generation era, the handheld game console market expanded with the introduction of new devices from many different manufacturers. Nintendo maintained its dominant share of the handheld market with the release in 2001 of the Game Boy Advance, which featured many upgrades and new features over the Game Boy. Two redesigns of this system followed, the Game Boy Advance SP in 2003 and the Game Boy Micro in 2005. Also introduced was the Bandai&#x27;s WonderSwan, launched in Japan in 1999. South Korean company Game Park introduced its GP32 handheld in 2001, and with it came the dawn of open source handheld consoles. The Game Boy Advance line of handhelds has sold 81.51 million units worldwide as of September 30, 2010.

A major new addition to the market was the trend for corporations to include a large number of &quot;non-gaming&quot; features into their handheld consoles, including cell phones, MP3 players, portable movie players, and PDA-like features. The handheld that started this trend was Nokia&#x27;s N-Gage, which was released in 2003 and doubled primarily as a mobile phone. It went through a redesign in 2004 and was renamed the N-Gage QD. A second handheld, the Zodiac from Tapwave, was released in 2004; based on the Palm OS, it offered specialized gaming-oriented video and sound capabilities, but it had an unwieldy development kit due to the underlying Palm OS foundation.

A fairly uncommon handheld of the 6th generation was the vtech V.SMILE Pocket. A handheld version of their V.SMILE home console.

With more and more PDAs arriving during the previous generation, the difference between consumer electronics and traditional computing began to blur and cheap console technology grew as a result. It was said of PDAs that they were &quot;the computers of handheld gaming&quot; because of their multi-purpose capabilities and the increasingly powerful computer hardware that resided within them. This capability existed to move gaming beyond the last generation&#x27;s 16-bit limitations; however, PDAs were still geared towards the typical businessman, and lacked new, affordable software franchises to compete with dedicated handheld gaming consoles.

==Trends==

===Market convergence===
Major publishers, such as Activision, Electronic Arts, and Ubisoft adopted a cross-platform strategy, releasing versions of their games for PC, all major consoles, and in some cases, handhelds as well. The sixth generation was the first to help console and computer software grow closer together as well as outperform the arcade market in features, graphics and business. The Dreamcast, which had an official Windows CE Development Kit to help porting games from PCs to Dreamcast, and the Xbox, which was made from off-the-shelf PC parts and hosted many PC ports, factored into this also.

===Controversial games===

While the sixth generation was not the first to have its share of controversial games, this generation was noted to have extensive criticism by public figures of &quot;objectionable&quot; content in gaming such as sex, crime, violence, profanity, and drug use as well as topics of debate such as religion, politics and economics.

The sixth generation was also notable because it saw the continuation of lawmakers taking actions against the video game industry. The most famous were Rockstar Games&#x27; &quot;Manhunt&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; games (&quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;) facing lawsuits over allegedly influencing minors to commit crimes, while &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; was briefly given an adult rating and removed from most stores over the availability of an abandoned sex mini-game using the Hot Coffee mod.

The sixth generation also coincided with the September 11 attacks in New York City and the Pentagon, which had a huge impact on the entertainment industry, including the video game industry; in the subsequent market climate, multiple games were edited in response to the sensitivity surrounding the event. Prior to its release, &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; depicted a submersible mobile fortress hijacked by terrorists destroying a good portion of Manhattan in view of the twin towers (this can be found in the &quot;Document of Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; making-of feature). Similarly, several undisclosed modifications were made in &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, such as a change to the police cars&#x27; color scheme (the old scheme resembled that of NYPD&#x27;s older blue and white design) and altered cover art (the European release featured the original artwork); Rockstar Games estimates that the changes amounted to 1% in changed content. The Dreamcast game &quot;Propeller Arena&quot; was never officially released, possibly due to a certain level which was visually very similar to the September 11 attacks.

===Emulation and retro gaming===

Because of the increased computing power of video game consoles and the widespread usage of emulators, the sixth generation saw the rise of console emulation and retro gaming on a vast scale. Many games for older systems were updated with superior graphics or sound and re-released for current consoles. Commonly emulated games included those released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the Mega Drive/Genesis, the PlayStation (the PS2 can play PS1 games natively), and the Nintendo 64.

Also during this generation, the computing power of handheld consoles became capable of supporting games made for some of the earliest gaming consoles and several companies released remakes of classic games for the handhelds. Nintendo introduced a line of NES and SNES games for its Game Boy Advance handheld, including remakes such as &quot;Final Fantasy I &amp; II: Dawn of Souls&quot; and Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Also, an increasing number of third-party developers, including Midway Games, Capcom, Namco, Atari, Tecmo, and Sega, released anthology collections of some of their old games. Additionally, many video games and video game series that were originally confined to Japan were released in North America and Europe for the first time.

===Rise of online gaming===
Online gaming, which in previous generations had been almost an exclusive domain of PC games, became more prominent in video game consoles during this generation. The Dreamcast initiated this change with its built in modem, internet browsing software, and ability to play certain games online. The PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube also offered online gaming, though their approaches and commitment to it varied greatly. The Xbox offered an integrated service called Xbox Live that cost $50 per year and was only compatible with a broadband internet connection. Its ability to connect gamers for online multi-player matches and its ideal experience was a considerable factor in allowing the Xbox to gain a foothold in the western market, especially in the first-person shooter genre. The PlayStation 2 left its online gaming service up to each individual game publisher, and though it was free to use, it was not always an ideal experience, especially with games published by small developers. The &quot;SOCOM&quot; series was one of the most popular online competitive games for the PS2. The GameCube did not offer online play for any of its first-party titles, with only Sega&#x27;s &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; series and &quot;Homeland&quot; making official use of the console&#x27;s online capabilities. In addition, online capability was not out-of-the-box; an adapter was needed to hook the GameCube to the internet.

===Mergers===
Many game publishing companies with a long established history merged with their competitors: Microsoft bought second-party developer Rare in 2002; Square merged with Enix to form Square Enix in 2003 and then later bought Taito; Sega merged with Sammy to form Sega Sammy Holdings in 2004; Konami bought a majority share of Hudson Soft; Namco merged with Bandai to form Bandai Namco Holdings in 2006.

<text>Peter Charles Lemon (born June 5, 1950) is a former United States Army soldier and a recipient of the United States military&#x27;s highest award for valor, the Medal of Honor. He received the award for his actions on April 1, 1970, while serving in Tây Ninh Province during the Vietnam War. He dedicates his award to the three comrades he lost in the battle for which he received the award: Casey Waller, Nathan Mann, Brent Street. Lemon is the only Canadian-born United States citizen to be presented the medal for fighting in the Vietnam War. He is the eighth-youngest living Medal of Honor recipient.

==Early life and education==
Lemon was born in Toronto, Canada, on June 5, 1950. He is a 1968 graduate from the Tawas Area High School, Tawas City, Michigan. Viewing the Vietnam War as necessary to stop the spread of communism, he volunteered to enter the United States Army at the East Tawas Post Office, East Tawas, Michigan. After his army service, he entered Colorado State University, graduating in 1979 with a degree in Speech. He received his Master&#x27;s of Science in Business Administration from the University of Northern Colorado two years later, and in 1998 he was proclaimed the university&#x27;s &quot;Humanitarian Alumni of the Year.&quot;

==Career==

Lemon was a motivational speaker, the author of the book &quot;Beyond the Medal&quot;, and executive producer of the PBS special &quot;Beyond the Medal of Honor&quot;. His book and documentary have been donated to every high school in the United States to inspire American children &quot;to be worthy citizens.&quot;

Lemon has also run several corporations, including American Hospitality Association, Inc.; Darnell-Lemon, Inc.; and Probus, Inc.

On May 1, 2009, Lemon was presented with the &quot;Outstanding American by Choice&quot; award by President Barack Obama at the White House, recognizing his life of professional achievement and civic contribution. This is the first time the award was presented by the President of the United States.

Lemon is an inductee in the elite Ranger Hall of Fame. A marble tribute honoring Lemon is present in Veteran&#x27;s Park in Tawas City, Michigan.

The state of Michigan, directed by the governor, dedicated highway US 23 in Tawas City to Mr. Lemon reading “Peter C. Lemon Highway - Congressional Medal of Honor, Outstanding American by Choice.”

In October 2024, Lemon joined 15 other Medal of Honor recipients in publicly endorsing Donald Trump for president.

<doc id="490619" wikidata="Q1355051" url="?curid=490619" title="Greenery Day">
<text>The present observation of as a public holiday in Japan stems from the celebration of the birthday of the Emperor Shōwa (Hirohito, who lived from 1901 to 1989) on April 29 every year during the Shōwa era (1926–1989). In 1989, following the ascension of the Emperor Akihito to the Chrysanthemum Throne, the name of the holiday was changed from &quot;Birthday of the Emperor&quot; to &quot;Greenery Day&quot;. Officially, as its name suggests, it is a day to commune with nature and to be thankful for blessings. The day was renamed to &quot;Greenery Day&quot; to acknowledge the controversial wartime emperor&#x27;s love for plants without directly mentioning his name. However, in practice it is seen as just another day that expands the Japanese Golden Week vacation.

In 2007, Greenery Day moved to May 4, and April 29 was changed to Shōwa Day in accordance with a 2005 revision of the law pertaining to public holidays. The Shōwa Emperor reigned for 62 years and 2 weeks. On May 3, 1947, he became a symbol of Japan by the new constitution of the country.
