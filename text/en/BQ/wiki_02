<text>The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) is the foundation of the system of military justice of the armed forces of the United States. The UCMJ was established by the United States Congress in accordance with their constitutional authority, per Article I Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, which provides that &quot;The Congress shall have Power . . . to make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval forces&quot; of the United States.

==History==
On June 30, 1775, the Second Continental Congress established 69 Articles of War to govern the conduct of the Continental Army. 

Effective upon its ratification in 1788, Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution provided that Congress has the power to regulate the land and naval forces. On 10 April 1806, the United States Congress enacted 101 Articles of War, which were not significantly revised until over a century later. Discipline in the sea services was provided under the Articles for the Government of the United States Navy, commonly referred to as &quot;Rocks and Shoals&quot;. 

The Articles of War evolved during the first half of the twentieth century and were amended in 1916 and 1920. In 1948, Congress substantially reformed the Articles pursuant to the Selective Service Act of 1948, but its naval counterpart remained little changed. The military justice system continued to operate under the Articles of War and Articles for the Government of the Navy until May 31, 1951, when the Uniform Code of Military Justice came into effect. 

The UCMJ was passed by Congress on 5 May 1950, and signed into law by President Harry S. Truman the next day. It took effect on May 31, 1951. The word &quot;uniform&quot; in the Code&#x27;s title refers to its consistent application to all the armed services in place of the earlier Articles of War, Articles of Government, and Disciplinary Laws of the individual services. Apart from consolidation of the existing military law, the UCMJ introduced United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. 

The UCMJ, the Rules for Courts-Martial (RCM) (analogous to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure), and the Military Rules of Evidence (analogous to the Federal Rules of Evidence) have evolved since their implementation. They have often paralleled the development of the federal civilian criminal justice system. In some ways, the UCMJ has been ahead of changes in the civilian criminal justice system. For example, a rights-warning statement similar to the &quot;Miranda&quot; warnings (and required in more contexts than in the civilian world where it is applicable only to custodial interrogation) was required by a decade and a half before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot;. Article 38(b) continued the 1948 Articles of War guarantee that qualified defense counsel be provided to all accused without regard to indigence (and at earlier stages than required in civilian jurisdictions), whereas the U.S. Supreme Court only guaranteed the provision of counsel to indigents in &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot;. 

The role of what was originally a court-martial&#x27;s non-voting &quot;law member&quot; developed into the present office of military judge whose capacity is little different from that of an Article III judge in a U.S. district court. At the same time, the &quot;court-martial&quot; itself, the panel of officers hearing the case and weighing the evidence, has converted from being essentially a board of inquiry/review presiding over the trial, into a jury of military service-members.

In 2013, at the Department of Defense&#x27;s Judicial Proceedings Panel, Cortney Lollar testified that the UCMJ needed to be updated to improve the sections regarding sexual assault.

The current version of the UCMJ is printed in the latest edition of the &quot;Manual for Courts-Martial&quot; (2019), incorporating changes made by the President (executive orders) and National Defense Authorization Acts of 2006 and 2007.

==Jurisdiction==

===Courts-martial===

Courts-martial are conducted under the UCMJ and the &quot;Manual for Courts-Martial&quot; (MCM). If the trial results in a conviction, the case is reviewed by the convening authority – the commanding officer who referred the case for trial by court-martial. The power of the convening authority was reduced in 2014. 

If the sentence, as approved by the convening authority, includes death, a bad conduct discharge, a dishonorable discharge, dismissal of an officer, or confinement for one year or more, the case is reviewed by an intermediate court. There are four such courts – the Army Court of Criminal Appeals, the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals, the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals, and the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals. 

After review by any of these intermediate courts, the next level of appeal is the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF). The Supreme Court of the United States has discretion under to review cases under the UCMJ on direct appeal where the CAAF has conducted a mandatory review (death penalty and certified cases), granted discretionary review of a petition, or otherwise granted relief. If the CAAF denies a petition for review or a writ appeal, consideration by the Supreme Court may be obtained only through collateral review (e.g., a writ of habeas corpus). Since 2007, several bills have been introduced into Congress to expand the accessibility of service members to the Supreme Court. See also Equal Justice for United States Military Personnel legislation.

===Personal jurisdiction===
Within the exceptions below, as codified in Article 2 of the UCMJ, personal jurisdiction attaches, regardless of the physical global location of the service member, over all members of the Uniformed Services of the United States: the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Space Force, Coast Guard, NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps, and Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. 

While the Coast Guard is administered under Title 14 of the United States Code when not operating as part of the U.S. Navy, individuals commissioned or enlisted in the Coast Guard are subject to the UCMJ as an armed force. Commissioned members of the NOAA and PHS, as uniformed services, are only subject to the UCMJ when attached or detailed to a military unit by competent orders, or when militarized by Presidential executive order during a national emergency or declaration of war.

Members of the military Reserve Components under Title 10 of the United States Code (Army Reserve, Marine Forces Reserve, Navy Reserve, and Air Force Reserve), or Title 14 of the United States Code, Coast Guard Reserve when not operating as part of the U.S. Navy, are subject to the UCMJ when they are:

# Full-Time Support (FTS) personnel on active duty orders serving pursuant to the authority of 10 USC 10211 or 10 USC 12310, including:
## Army/Air Force &quot;Active Guard and Reserve (AGR),&quot;
## Navy &quot;Full-time Support (FTS),&quot;
## Marine Corps &quot;Active Reserve (AR),&quot; or
## Coast Guard &quot;Reserve Program Administrators (RPA).&quot;
# &quot;Traditional&quot; reservists performing either:
## Full-time active duty service under orders for a specific period, i.e., Annual Training, Active Duty for Training, Active Duty for Operational Support, Active Duty Special Work, Mobilization or Recall to Active Duty, Canvasser Recruiter, etc., or
## Performing part-time Inactive Duty, i.e., Inactive Duty Training, Inactive Duty Travel and Training, Unit Training Assembly, Additional Training Periods, Additional Flying Training Periods, Reserve Management Periods, etc., all of which are colloquially known as &quot;drills.&quot;
## Retired Reservists who are either recalled to active duty pursuant to secretarial authority, or who are receiving medical treatment in an armed forces hospital (see below).

Soldiers and airmen in the National Guard of the United States are subject to the UCMJ only if activated (mobilized or recalled to active duty) in a federal capacity under Title 10 by an executive order issued by the President, or during their annual training periods, which are orders issued under Title 10, during which periods of duty they are federalized into the National Guard of the United States. Otherwise, members of the National Guard are usually exempt from the UCMJ. However, under Title 32 orders, or State Active Duty orders issued directly under State authority, individual members of the Army National Guard and Air National Guard are still subject to their respective state codes of military justice, which often resemble the UCMJ very closely, and/or their state civil and criminal laws.

Several States also authorize either naval or military organized militia forces. These are collectively known as the State Guard. State Guard organizations are organized, trained, equipped, armed, disciplined, and administered under each State&#x27;s own sovereign authority, and are not subject to a Federal recall to active duty, nor are the individual members subject to the UCMJ in their capacities as members of the State Guard. State Guard organizations typically are organized similarly to a military force, and usually report to the senior National Guard officer in each State, known as the Adjutant General. 

In this sense, the State Guard are auxiliaries to each State&#x27;s Constitutionally authorized organized militia forces, the Army and Air National Guard. The State Guard is often specialized, based on each state&#x27;s requirements, for missions such as wilderness search and rescue, light aviation, forest firefighting, law enforcement, or general emergency management roles. Under each state&#x27;s own authorities, State Guard members may be ordered to State Active Duty (SAD), in a status similar to National Guard members in a Title 32 status but solely under state authority and discipline, and also may be provided with the training, equipment, and authority to act as law enforcement officers with powers of arrest. 

Each state sets the requirements to join, remain, be promoted or rewarded, and conditions of employment such as a minimum amount of duty performed in a year, and whether any duty is paid or unpaid, and whether the individuals are covered by various civil service or retirement pension plans. Most State Guard duty is performed without pay, in a volunteer status. While the State Guard organizations are subject to recall to SAD, or other workforce requirements as imposed by their state, they are not subject to either partial or full mobilization authorities under Title 10. 

However, the individual State Guard members often have dual-status as both State Guard &quot;and&quot; a federally recognized uniformed services member, such as a Texas State Guard officer who is also a retired U.S. military officer. Such an individual could be recalled to active duty under both SAD as a State Guard member, or under one of the various authorities to recall retired or reserve military members to active duty (10 USC 688, various 10 USC 123XX authorities, and others), but not both because a federal status trumps a state status. State Guard members could thus be subject to the UCMJ at all times under their federal status, and under specific state military and civil/criminal codes under their state status.

Cadets and midshipmen at the United States Military Academy, United States Naval Academy, United States Air Force Academy, and United States Coast Guard Academy, are subject to the UCMJ at all times because they are in an active duty status as members of the regular component while serving at a Military Service Academy, per Article 2(a)(2) of UCMJ. Army and Air Force Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) cadets are not subject to the UCMJ, except while on inactive or active duty training. Midshipmen of the United States Merchant Marine Academy and Navy ROTC (including marine-option) midshipmen are also subject to the UCMJ when on inactive or active duty for training orders.

Members of military auxiliaries such as the Civil Air Patrol and the Coast Guard Auxiliary are not subject to the UCMJ, even when participating in missions assigned by the military or other branches of government. However, members of the Coast Guard Auxiliary can be called by the Commandant of the Coast Guard into the Temporary Reserve of the Coast Guard, in which case they become subject to the UCMJ.

Additionally, the following categories of service members are subject to the UCMJ as indicated:

# Retired members of the regular component who are entitled to retirement pay, per Article 2(a)(4) of UCMJ, regardless of the authority under which retired from active service and transferred to the retired list of their respective service&#x27;s regular component,
# Retired members of the reserve component, whether entitled to retired pay or awaiting retired pay at age 60 as a gray area reserve retiree, who are receiving hospital care from an armed force, per Article 2(a)(5) of UCMJ,
# Members of the Fleet Reserve/Fleet Marine Corps Reserve (FR/FMCR), as enlisted retired Navy or Marine Corps personnel who have not yet served a total of 30 years of combined active, fleet reserve, and retired service, per Article 2(a)(6) of UCMJ. Both regular component and reserve component enlisted retirees are transferred to the FR/FMCR upon retirement if they have less than 30 total years, but more than 20 cumulative years of active service, and remain subject to the UCMJ in that status until they complete 30 total years of active and fleet reserve service, and are transferred to their respective original Service Retired List (regular component or retired reserve). The FR/FMCR is not applicable to any officers, any service member retired for disability and transferred to the Temporary or Permanent Disability Retired Lists, nor any enlisted retirees except those of the Navy and Marine Corps as noted above.
# Persons in custody of the U.S. Armed Forces serving a sentence imposed by a court-martial, per Article 2(a)(7) of UCMJ,
# Members of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Public Health Service, and other organizations, when assigned to and serving with the armed forces, per Article 2(a)(8) of UCMJ,
# Prisoners of War (POW)/Enemy Prisoners of War (EPW) in the custody of the U.S. Armed Forces, per Article 2(a)(9) of UCMJ, 
# In time of declared war or a contingency operation, persons serving with or accompanying a U.S. armed force in the field, per Article 2(a)(10), and
# Detained medical personnel and military chaplains in the custody of the U.S. Armed Forces.

Civilians are not subject to UCMJ. However, the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over crimes committed on a military installation. A military investigation may be conducted to determine whether or not to prosecute a civilian who commits a crime on a military base. Civilians are not otherwise subject to military law, even when the crime is committed against a service member. When a civilian bus driver murdered an Army private off post in 1942, for example, the post commander was unable to investigate.

====Military contractors====
Historically, the UCMJ applied to &quot;persons serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field&quot; and thus included military contractors &quot;in time of war.&quot; In the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007, which was enacted in 2006, Congress expanded the UCMJ&#x27;s applicability to cover contractors during a &quot;declared war or contingency operation.&quot; The change came following the Nisour Square massacre perpetrated by Blackwater Security personnel. 

In 2008, the first contractor was prosecuted under the new provision, marking the first time since 1968 that a contractor had been charged under military law. The civilian defendant, a dual Canadian-Iraqi citizen, was charged with stabbing a co-worker, another Iraqi civilian. The contractor ultimately pleaded guilty.

===Non-judicial punishment===

Under Article 15 of the Code (Subchapter III), specified military commanders have the authority to exercise non-judicial punishment (NJP) over their subordinates for minor breaches of discipline. These punishments are carried out after a hearing before the commander but without a judge and jury. Punishments are limited to a reduction in rank for enlisted members, loss of pay, restriction of privileges, extra-duty, reprimands, and, aboard ships, confinement. Guidelines for the imposition of NJP are contained in Part V of the &quot;Manual for Courts-Martial&quot; and the various service regulations.

===Complaints of wrongs and loss of property===
The UCMJ provides that any service member may bring a &quot;complaint of wrongs&quot; against their commanding officer to the next senior officer exercising general court-martial authority over their commander. That officer will investigate the complaint of wrongs, and then report the findings of the investigation to the service Secretary (i.e., Secretary of the Army, Navy, Air Force) concerned. Following said findings an investigation board can be convened to investigate and adjudicate claims of willful damage, destruction, or theft of personal property, only if both parties are subject to the Code.

==Current subchapters==
The UCMJ is found in Title 10, Subtitle A, Part II, Chapter 47 of the United States Code.

===General provisions===
Subchapter I, &quot;General Provisions&quot; has six sections (articles):

Article 1 (Definitions), defines the following terms used in the rest of the UCMJ: Judge Advocate General, the Navy, officer in charge, superior commissioned officer, cadet, midshipman, military, accuser, military judge, law specialist, legal officer, judge advocate, record, classified information, and national security. This article also provides that, &quot;The Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard when it is operating as a service in the Navy, shall be considered as one armed force&quot; for the purposes of the UCMJ.

===Pre-trial procedure===
Under Article 31, coercive self-incrimination is prohibited as a right under the Fifth Amendment. Apprehending officers utilize the Article 31 warning and waiver to prevent this self-incrimination, much like the &quot;Miranda&quot; warning. Article 31 was already well-established before &quot;Miranda&quot;.

Article 32 refers to the pre-trial investigation and hearing conducted before charges are referred to trial for court-martial. It may be conducted by a Judge Advocate General (JAG) officer or non-JAG officer.

===Punitive articles===
Subchapter X, &quot;Punitive Articles&quot;, is the subchapter that details offenses under the uniform code. The 2019 MCM incorporates both major and minor changes to certain articles, and relocates many articles; careful examination of the source document is required to ensure full understanding, and previous &quot;cheat sheets&quot; and training materials may therefore be outdated. Those articles with a title annotated by &quot;*&quot; were changed from the 2016 MCM:

====General article (Article 134)====
The general article (Article 134) authorizes the prosecution of offenses not specifically detailed by any other article: &quot;...all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces, all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces, and crimes and offenses not capital, of which persons subject to this chapter may be guilty.&quot;

Clause 1 of the article involves disorders and neglect, &quot;...to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces.&quot; Clause 2 involves, &quot;...conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.&quot; Clause 3 deals with non-capital offenses violating other federal law; under this clause, any such offense created by federal statute may be prosecuted under Article 134. &quot;United States v. Perkins&quot;, 47 C.M.R. 259 (Air Force Ct. of Military Review 1973).

The most recent version of the &quot;Manual for Courts-Martial&quot; lists the following offenses commonly prosecuted under Article 134:
* Animal abuse
* Bigamy
* Check, worthless making and uttering – by dishonorably failing to maintain funds
* Child pornography
* Dishonorably failing to pay debt
*Disloyal statement
* Disorderly conduct, drunkenness
* Extramarital sexual conduct
* Discharging firearm through negligence
* Fraternization
* Gambling with subordinate
* Negligent homicide
* Indecent conduct
* Indecent language
* Pandering and prostitution
* Self-injury without intent to avoid service
* Sexual act with an animal

<doc id="487400" wikidata="Q6490431" url="?curid=487400" title="Larry Grossman (politician)">
<text>Lawrence Sheldon &quot;Larry&quot; Grossman, (December 2, 1943 – June 22, 1997) was a politician in Ontario, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly as a Progressive Conservative from 1975 to 1987, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of Bill Davis and Frank Miller. Grossman was leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservatives from 1985 to 1987.

==Background==
Born in Toronto, Grossman was the son of Allan Grossman, a former insurance agent who had represented a downtown Toronto riding in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario for twenty years after defeating Ontario&#x27;s last Communist Member of Provincial Parliament, J. B. Salsberg. Grossman&#x27;s family was of Polish Jewish origin. He attended Forest Hill Collegiate and went to University of Toronto and the Osgoode Hall Law School. He was admitted to the bar in 1969.

==Politics==
Grossman&#x27;s first foray into politics was in the Toronto municipal election of 1972. He competed for alderman in Ward 11, but lost, coming third behind Anne Johnston and David Smith.

When his father retired, Grossman contested and won in the riding of St. Andrew—St. Patrick in the 1975 election, defeating Ontario New Democratic Party candidate Barbara Beardsley by 429 votes. He was re-elected in the 1977, 1981, and 1985 elections.

After serving as parliamentary assistant to the Attorney General from 1975 to 1977, Grossman was appointed to cabinet on September 21, 1977 as Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations. On October 18, 1978, Grossman was shuffled to Minister of Industry and Tourism.

Grossman was promoted to the high-profile position of Health Minister on February 18, 1982, and was named Provincial Treasurer and Minister of Economics on July 6, 1983.
In cabinet, Grossman&#x27;s progressive views earned him a reputation as a Red Tory, and he clashed with his own party after then-Health Minister Frank Miller closed the Kensington Hospital in Grossman&#x27;s riding.

===Cabinet posts===

===Leadership===
When Davis announced his resignation as leader of the party and premier of the province, Grossman ran to succeed him. He was widely regarded as the most progressive candidate, and was endorsed by members of the party&#x27;s Toronto-based Big Blue Machine. His supporters included Susan Fish, Russ Ramsay, Phil Gillies, Bruce McCaffrey and George Taylor. However, delegates to the party&#x27;s January 1985 leadership convention chose the more conservative Frank Miller as leader. Grossman placed third on the first ballot, ahead of Roy McMurtry, but behind Miller and Dennis Timbrell. With the support of the McMurtry campaign, Grossman moved six votes ahead of Timbrell on the second ballot. It was confirmed in 1987 by Dr. John Balkwill that the Miller campaign did not want the prospect of facing Timbrell on the final ballot, since their tracking of delegate intentions showed that their candidate would lose decisively to Timbrell, so about 30-40 Miller delegates voted strategically for Grossman to ensure Timbrell&#x27;s elimination.

Timbrell, who was a bitter rival of Grossman but also wanted to prevent a Miller victory, reluctantly endorsed Grossman after the results were confirmed by a recount. He did not bring enough delegates on the third ballot, however, and Grossman lost to Miller. Grossman remained the Provincial Treasurer in Miller&#x27;s government.

Miller ran a disastrous campaign in the 1985 election, and the party was reduced to a fragile minority government. Grossman was appointed as Minister of Education and Minister of Colleges and Universities after the election, but was unable to accomplish anything of significance before the Liberals and New Democrats joined forces to topple Miller&#x27;s government in the legislature.

Miller quickly resigned as leader, and Grossman was chosen as the new leader over Dennis Timbrell and Alan Pope at a second leadership convention on November 16, 1985. Pope was forced on the defensive when one of his workers was caught polling party members as to whether religion would make a difference in the leadership race, which was seen as a reference to Grossman&#x27;s Jewish background. Timbrell lost support when he declared his opposition to the full funding of Catholic schools, causing Norm Sterling to defect to Grossman&#x27;s campaign. Grossman defeated Timbrell by only 19 votes on the second ballot, in a campaign that was marked by considerable acrimony.

Grossman became Leader of the Opposition to the Liberal Premier David Peterson.

Grossman&#x27;s political hero was Benjamin Disraeli, whose portrait was displayed on his office wall. Shortly after winning the leadership of the Ontario Progressive Conservatives, he criticized American &quot;neo-Conservatism&quot; as &quot;a shallow reconstitution of laissez-faire liberalism.&quot;

===Opposition===
The Peterson government was very popular, and Grossman&#x27;s Tories, in opposition for the first time since 1943, had a difficult time adjusting to their new role. When the Liberals called an early election for the fall of 1987, Grossman&#x27;s Tories tried to campaign on a right-wing platform of tax cuts and reduced government spending. Grossman&#x27;s history as a Red Tory made for a poor contrast with the party&#x27;s new platform. Peterson won a strong majority government in the 1987 election, and the Conservatives were reduced from 52 seats to 16, falling to third place behind the NDP—their worst showing in over half a century. Grossman lost his own seat to Liberal challenger Ron Kanter and promptly resigned. The party selected Andy Brandt as interim leader.

==Retirement and last years==
He assisted new party leader Mike Harris in the 1990 provincial election, and coached him to stay &quot;on-message&quot; with the issue of tax cuts.

In the early 1990s, Grossman hosted a weekend talk show on radio station CFRB.

In 1997, Larry Grossman died at the age of 53 from brain cancer. A few days before his death, he invited TVOntario cameras into his house to help with TVO&#x27;s membership campaign. He was named to the Order of Ontario shortly before his death. He left behind his three children Melissa, Jaimie and Robbie. He was divorced from Carole, their mother, at the time of his death.

In 2004, the Forest Hill Arena, a local Toronto hockey and skating rink where his children played, was renamed the Larry Grossman Forest Hill Memorial Arena in his honour.

<doc id="487403" wikidata="Q4637271" url="?curid=487403" title="40-bit encryption">
<text>40-bit encryption refers to a (now broken) key size of forty bits, or five bytes, for symmetric encryption; this represents a relatively low level of security. A forty bit length corresponds to a total of 240 possible keys. Although this is a large number in human terms (about a trillion), it is possible to break this degree of encryption using a moderate amount of computing power in a brute-force attack, &quot;i.e.&quot;, trying out each possible key in turn.

==Description==
A typical home computer in 2004 could brute-force a 40-bit key in a little under two weeks, testing a million keys per second; modern computers are able to achieve this much faster. Using free time on a large corporate network or a botnet would reduce the time in proportion to the number of computers available. With dedicated hardware, a 40-bit key can be broken in seconds. The Electronic Frontier Foundation&#x27;s Deep Crack, built by a group of enthusiasts for US$250,000 in 1998, could break a 56-bit Data Encryption Standard (DES) key in days, and would be able to break 40-bit DES encryption in about two seconds.

40-bit encryption was common in software released before 1999, especially those based on the RC2 and RC4 algorithms which had special &quot;7-day&quot; export review policies, when algorithms with larger key lengths could not legally be exported from the United States without a case-by-case license. &quot;In the early 1990s ... As a general policy, the State Department allowed exports of commercial encryption with 40-bit keys, although some software with DES could be exported to U.S.-controlled subsidiaries and financial institutions.&quot; As a result, the &quot;international&quot; versions of web browsers were designed to have an effective key size of 40 bits when using Secure Sockets Layer to protect e-commerce. Similar limitations were imposed on other software packages, including early versions of Wired Equivalent Privacy. In 1992, IBM designed the CDMF algorithm to reduce the strength of 56-bit DES against brute force attack to 40 bits, in order to create exportable DES implementations.

==Obsolescence==
All 40-bit and 56-bit encryption algorithms are obsolete, because they are vulnerable to brute force attacks, and therefore cannot be regarded as secure. As a result, virtually all Web browsers now use 128-bit keys, which are considered strong. Most Web servers will not communicate with a client unless it has 128-bit encryption capability installed on it.

Public/private key pairs used in asymmetric encryption (public key cryptography), at least those based on prime factorization, must be much longer in order to be secure; see key size for more details.

As a general rule, modern symmetric encryption algorithms such as AES use key lengths of 128, 192 and 256 bits.

<text>Črneče () is a village on the right bank of the Drava River in the Municipality of Dravograd in the Carinthia region in northern Slovenia.

==Church==
The local church in the centre of the settlement is dedicated to Saint Andrew and Saint James and dates to the early 15th century with some later rebuilding.

==Castle==
Close to the church there is a castle from the 15th century, first mentioned in 1408. In 1432, the castle was mentioned under the name &quot;Tscherberg&quot;. In the second half of the 17th century, the castle was owned by Adam Seyfrid Waldner. In 1936, ownership was transferred to Catholic nuns from Slovenska Bistrica. After the Second World War it was nationalized, and a cultural hall and apartments were arranged in the castle.

==Lake Dravograd==
Lake Dravograd () lies east of the village. This reservoir was created after the Dravograd Hydroelectric Power Plant was built in 1944 and is located between Črneče and Dravograd. The shallow southern part on the Črneče side contains several shallow branches of the Drava River with reed-covered islands, and the main course of the river is to the north, below Dravograd.

The southern wetlands are an important natural habitat, because of which the area of Lake Dravograd was included in Natura 2000 as a protected area. More than 150 bird species have been observed here, the most common including the mute swan, grey heron, mallard Eurasian coot, sedge warbler, great reed warbler, common moorhen, and great crested grebe. The lake is an important stop for migrating birds, and a spawning ground for native fish and amphibians. Common fish species found here are the tench, common carp, European chub, common bream, common barbel, and northern pike. Fishing is widespread in the area and is also allowed around the lake. Typical amphibians of the region include the common toad, common frog, and European tree frog. Reptile species commonly found in the region include the grass snake, dice snake, horned viper, Aesculapian snake, European green lizard, and common wall lizard. Around 2000, the Eurasian beaver spread from lower parts of the Drava River and settled around the lake.

The flora is also diverse, and more than 160 plant species are known in the area. The dominant plant on the islands between the main flow and branches is reeds, forming extensive reed beds. Other typical plants from the area include &quot;Rumex aquaticus&quot;, yellow iris, celery-leaved buttercup, sweet flag, cowbane, common bulrush, willow, and common aspen.

==History==

During World War II, German forces attacked the Kingdom of Yugoslavia on April 6, 1941. On April 10, German forces reached Dravograd, crossed the Drava River on April 11, and continued their breakthrough towards Slovenj Gradec and Celje. Resistance was provided by scant Yugoslav forces along the Rupnik Line, which crossed Črneče and Dravograd, and could not significantly delay the advance of the Germans.

Later during the war, Russian prisoners of war building the Dravograd Hydroelectric Power Plant were stationed near Črneče. About 400 prisoners were transferred here from the POW camp in Wolfsberg. The prisoners lived in poor conditions and more of 100 of them died in just two months due to hunger and exhaustion. A memorial to 197 Russian prisoners is located in Črneče.

==Notable people==
Notable people that were born or lived in Črneče include:
* Berta Jereb (born 1925), pediatric oncologist

<text>The Valerianaceae Batsch, the valerian family, was a family of flowering plants that is now considered part of the Caprifoliaceae. Plants are generally herbaceous, and their foliage often has a strong, disagreeable odor. They are found native in most regions of the world except for Australia. Some species are cultivated as ornamentals or used in herbal medicine for inducing relaxation and sleep.

The genera that were placed in this family, along with some species, include:

* &quot;Centranthus&quot;
:: &quot;C. ruber&quot; (red valerian, spur valerian or red spur valerian)

* &quot;Fedia&quot;
:: &quot;F. cornucopiae&quot; (African valerian, horn of plenty)

* &quot;Nardostachys&quot;
:: &quot;N. jatamansi&quot; (Spikenard)
:: &quot;N. chinensis&quot;

* &quot;Patrinia&quot;
* &quot;Plectritis&quot;
* &quot;Valeriana&quot;
:: &quot;V. dioica&quot; (marsh valerian)
:: &quot;V. officinalis&quot; (valerian)

* &quot;Valerianella&quot;
:: &quot;V. locusta&quot; (corn salad, lamb&#x27;s lettuce)

DNA studies have found &quot;Valeriana&quot; to be paraphyletic with respect to &quot;Centranthus&quot; and &quot;Valerianella&quot;, and &quot;Valerianella&quot; with respect to &quot;Fedia&quot;. Some sources now include &quot;Centranthus&quot;, &quot;Fedia&quot; and &quot;Valerianella&quot; within &quot;Valeriana&quot;.

<text>Andrew S. Brandt (June 11, 1938 – December 22, 2023) was a Canadian politician and public administrator who served in a number of roles in the province of Ontario. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Progressive Conservative from 1981 to 1990, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of Bill Davis and Frank Miller. He later served as interim leader of the Progressive Conservative Party from 1987 to 1990 before being appointed chairman and CEO of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario.

==Background==
Andrew S. Brandt was born June 11, 1938, in London, Ontario. Brandt was educated at the University of Waterloo, and was a businessman and musician before entering political life.

==Politics==
Brandt ran for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1972 federal election as a Progressive Conservative, but lost to Liberal Bud Cullen by 1,465 votes in Sarnia—Lambton. Brandt served as an alderman in Sarnia from 1971 to 1974, and as mayor of the city from 1975 to 1980.

Brandt ran for the Ontario legislature in the 1977 provincial election, but lost to Liberal Paul Blundy, who had immediately preceded Brandt as Mayor of Sarnia, by 257 votes in the provincial electoral district of Sarnia. He ran again in the 1981 election and defeated Blundy by 3,029 votes, as the Progressive Conservatives won a majority government under Bill Davis. After serving as a parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Labour, Brandt was promoted to cabinet on July 6, 1983, as Minister of the Environment.

Brandt was originally neutral in the Progressive Conservative Party&#x27;s 1985 leadership convention, but surprised delegates by endorsing Frank Miller from the convention podium. When Miller became Premier of Ontario on February 8, 1985, he appointed Brandt as his Minister of Industry and Trade. Brandt was easily returned in the 1985 provincial election. The Progressive Conservatives were reduced to a minority government, however, and soon lost a vote of confidence in the legislature. In opposition, Brandt served as his party&#x27;s critic for Environment and Industry.

The 1987 provincial election proved disastrous for the Progressive Conservative Party, which was reduced to only sixteen seats out of 130 in the legislature. Brandt defeated Liberal Joan Link-Mellon by 2,661 votes. Party leader Larry Grossman was defeated in his own riding so Brandt was selected as interim leader on November 3, 1987, and held the position until Mike Harris was chosen as full-time leader on May 12, 1990. Brandt did not run in the 1990 election.

===Cabinet positions===



==After politics==
In 1991, Bob Rae appointed Brandt as chairman and CEO of the LCBO, the agency that owns and operates Ontario&#x27;s publicly owned liquor stores. He was reappointed to the position four times by Rae, Harris and Ernie Eves, retaining the position for fifteen years, and remains the longest serving chair and CEO in LCBO history. He was noted for modernizing the LCBO&#x27;s operations as well as convincing the provincial government not to privatize the service. He was accused of accepting inappropriate luxury trips in 1999, but was defended in the legislature and was soon after reappointed to a fourth term as chair and CEO.

In 2000, Brandt supported Stockwell Day for the leadership of the Canadian Alliance on the second ballot of the newly formed party&#x27;s leadership contest.

Brandt retired as LCBO chairman on February 5, 2006, after fifteen years at the helm. During his time in the position, annual sales went from $1.8 billion in 1991 to a projected $3.6 billion in 2006.

Brandt died on December 22, 2023, at the age of 85.

<text>ENU, also known as &quot;N&quot;-ethyl-&quot;N&quot;-nitrosourea (chemical formula C3H7N3O2), is a highly potent mutagen. For a given gene in mice, ENU can induce 1 new mutation in every 700 loci. It is also toxic at high doses.

The chemical is an alkylating agent, and acts by transferring the ethyl group of ENU to nucleobases (usually thymine) in nucleic acids. Its main targets are the spermatogonial stem cells, from which mature sperm are derived.

==Background of discovery of ENU as a mutagen==
Bill Russell (1951) created a landmark in the field of mouse genetics by creating a specifically designed mouse strain, the &quot;T&quot; (test) stock that was used in genetic screens for testing mutagens such as radiations and chemicals. The &quot;T&quot;-stock mouse harbors 7 recessive, viable mutations affecting easily recognizable traits. At the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Russell&#x27;s initial goal was to determine the rate of inheritable gene mutations in the germ line induced by radiations. Thus he decided to use &quot;T&quot;-stock mice in order to define how often a set of loci could be mutated with radiations. Since the mutations in the &quot;T&quot;-stock mouse were recessive, the progeny would have a wild type phenotype (as a result of crossing a mutant [e.g.&quot;s&quot;/&quot;s&quot; mutant male] to a wild type female [&quot;+&quot;/&quot;+&quot;]). Thus with any progeny carrying a mutation induced by radiation at one of the 7 loci, would exhibit the mutant phenotype in the first generation itself. This approach, the specific locus test (SLT) allowed Russell to study a wide range of specific mutations and to calculate the mutation rates induced by radiations.

In addition to studying the effect of radiation for SLT, Russell et al. were also interested in studying the effect of chemical mutagens such as procarbazine and ethylnitrosourea for SLT. At that time, procarbazine was the most potent chemical mutagen known to cause a significant spermatogonial mutagenesis in an SLT, although at a rate one-third of that of X-rays. Russell&#x27;s earlier mutagenesis work on &quot;Drosophila&quot; using diethylnitrosoamine (DEN) triggered them to use DEN for the SLT. However, DEN needs to be enzymatically converted into an alkylating agent in order to be mutagenic and probably this enzymatic activation was not sufficient in mammals. This could be illustrated by the extremely low mutation rate in mice given by DEN (3 in 60,179 offspring). To overcome this problem, a new mutagen, &quot;N&quot;-ethyl &quot;N&quot;-nitrosourea (ENU), an alkylating agent, which does not need to be metabolised, was suggested to be used by Ekkehart Vegel to Russell et al. The ENU (250 mg/kg) induced mice underwent a period of sterility for 10 weeks. After recovery, 90 males were crossed to the &quot;T&quot;-stock females and 7584 pups were obtained. Their results showed that a dose of 250 mg/kg of ENU was capable of producing a mutation rate 5 times higher than that obtained with 600R (1R = 2.6 x10^-4 coulombs/kg) of acute X-irradiation. This rate was also 15 times higher to that obtained with procarbazine (600 mg/kg).

To overcome the problem of initial period of sterility, the Russell group showed that instead of injecting one large dose of ENU, a fractionated dose (100 mg/kg) on a weekly schedule permitted a total higher dose (300–400 mg/kg) to be tolerated. This further showed that the mutation frequency improved to be 12 times that of X-rays, 36 times that of procarbazine and over 200 times that of spontaneous mutations. When the mutation rate was averaged across all 7 loci, ENU was found to induce mutations at a frequency of one per locus in every 700 gametes.

==Summary of properties and advantages of ENU mutagenesis==
# ENU is an alkylating agent and has preference for A-&gt;T base transversions and also for AT-&gt;GC transitions. However it is also shown to cause GC-&gt;AT transitions.
# It is known to induce point mutations, which implies that by mapping for the desired phenotype, the researcher can identify a single candidate gene responsible for the phenotype.
# The point mutations are at approximately 1-2 Mb (Mega-base-pair) interval and occur at an approximate rate of 1 per 700 gametes.
# ENU targets spermatogonial stem cells.

==ENU - A genetic tool in mutagenesis screens: Overview==
Ever since the discovery of ENU as the most potent mutagen by Russell et al. it has been used in forward (phenotype based) genetic screens with which one can identify and study a phenotype of interest. As illustrated in Figure 1, the screening process begins with mutagenising a male mouse with ENU. This is followed by systematic phenotypic analysis of the progeny. The progeny are assessed for behavioral, physiological or dysmorphological changes. The abnormal phenotype is identified. Identification of the candidate gene is then achieved by positional cloning of the mutant mice with the phenotype of interest.

==Types of screens==
ENU is used as a genetic tool by designing a variety of genetic screens suitable to the researchers&#x27; interests.
Depending on the region being assessed, forward genetic screens can be classified as illustrated in Figure 2 as:
# Region Specific screens: Studies are designed specifically to obtain a gradient of phenotypes by generating an allelic series which are helpful in studying the region of interest.
# Genome-wide screens: These are simple dominant or recessive screens and are often useful in understanding specific genetic and biochemical pathways.

===Region-specific screens===
Region specific can be classified as follows:
===Non-complementation screens===
Complementation is the phenomenon which enables generation of the wild type phenotype when organisms carrying recessive mutations in different genes are crossed. Thus if an organism has one functional copy of the gene, then this functional copy is capable of complementing the mutated or the lost copy of the gene. In contrast, if both the copies of the gene are mutated or lost, then this will lead to allelic non-complementation (Figure 3) and thus manifestation of the phenotype.

The phenomenon of redundancy explains that often multiple genes are able to compensate for the loss of a particular gene. However, if two or more genes involved in the same biological processes or pathways are lost, then this leads to non-allelic non-complementation.
In a non-complementation screen, an ENU-induced male is crossed with a female carrying a mutant allele (&quot;a&quot;) of the gene of interest (A). If the mutation is dominant, then it will be present in every generation. However, if the mutation is recessive or if the G1 progeny are non-viable, then a different strategy is used to identify the mutation. An ENU-treated male is crossed with a wild type female. From the pool of G1 individuals, a heterozygous male is crossed to a female carrying the mutant allele (&quot;a&quot;). If the G2 progeny are infertile or non-viable, they can be recovered again from the G1 male.
===Deletion screens===
Deletions on chromosomes can be spontaneous or induced. In this screen, ENU-treated males are crossed to females homozygous for a deletion of the region of interest. The G1 progeny are compound heterozygotes for the ENU-induced mutation (Figure 4). Also, they are haploid with respect to the genes in the deleted region and thus loss-of-function or gain-of-function due to the ENU-induced mutation is expressed dominantly. Thus deletion screens have an advantage over other recessive screens due to the identification of the mutation in the G1 progeny itself.

Rinchik &quot;et al&quot;. performed a deletion screen and complementation analysis and were able to isolate 11 independent recessive loci, which were grouped into seven complementation groups on chromosome 7, a region surrounding the albino (&quot;Tyr&quot;) gene and the pink-eyed dilution (&quot;p&quot;) gene.

*c. Balancer screens

A chromosome carrying a balancer region is termed as a balancer chromosome. A balancer is a region which prevents recombination between homologous chromosomes during meiosis. This is possible due to the presence of an inverted region or a series of inversions. Balancer chromosome was primarily used for studies in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; genetics. Monica Justice &quot;et al.&quot; (2009) efficiently carried out a balancer screen using a balancer chromosome constructed by Allan Bradley &quot;et al.&quot; on mouse chromosome 11. In this screen, an ENU-induced male is crossed with a female heterozygous for the balancer chromosome. The mice carrying the balancer chromosome have yellow ears and tail. The G1 heterozygotes are (Figure 5) are crossed to females carrying the rex mutation (&quot;Rex&quot; in figure 5), which confers a curly coat. In G2, homozygotes for the balancer are non-viable and are not recovered. Mice carrying the rex mutation trans to the balancer or ENU-induced mutation have a curly coat and are discarded. The ENU mutant + rex mutant mice are discarded in order to prevent recombination between those two chromosomes during the next breeding step, which is generating homozygous mutants. Mice that are compound heterozygotes for the balancer and the ENU-induced mutation are brother-sister mated to obtain homozygotes for the ENU-induced mutation in G3.

===Genome-wide screens===
Genome-wide screens are most often useful for studying genetic diseases in which multiple genetic and biochemical pathways may be involved. Thus with this approach, candidate genes or regions across the genome, that are associated with the phenotype can be identified.

*a. Conventional screens
These screens can be designed to identify simple dominant and recessive phenotypes. (Figure 6). Thus an ENU-induced G0 male is crossed with a wild type female. The G progeny can be screened to identify dominant mutations. However, if the mutation is recessive, then G3 individuals homozygous for the mutation can be recovered from the G1 males in two ways:
*A] The G1 male is crossed with a wild type female to generate a pool of G2 progeny. The G3 individuals can be obtained by crossing the G1 male to the G2 daughters. This will yield a proportion of the G3 individuals which resemble the G1 male to a large extent.
*B] G1 male is crossed to a wild type female to obtain a pool of G2 animals., which are then brother-sister mated to obtain the G3 progenies. This approach yields a variety of mutants in the G3 progeny.
A number of organizations around the world are performing genome-wide mutagenesis screens using ENU. Some of them include the Institute of Experimental Genetics at the German Research Center for Environmental Health (GSF), Munich, Germany; The Jackson Laboratory, Maine, USA; the Australian Phenomics Facility at the Australian National University, Canberra, Australia; the Department of Neurobiology and Physiology at Northwestern University, Illinois, USA; the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee, USA; the Medical Research Council (MRC) Harwell, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom; the Department of Genetics at The Scripps Research Institute, California, USA; the Mouse Mutagenesis Center for Developmental Defects at Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, USA; and others.

*b. Modifier screens
A modifier such as an enhancer or suppressor can alter the function of a gene. In a modifier screen, an organism with a pre-existing phenotype is selected. Thus, any mutations caused by the mutagen (ENU) can be assessed for their enhancive or suppressive activity. Screening for dominant and recessive mutations is performed in a way similar to the conventional genome-wide screen (Figure 7).
A number of modifier screens have been performed on &quot;Drosophila&quot;. Recently, Aliga et al. performed a dominant modifier screen using ENU-induced mice to identify modifiers of the Notch signaling pathway. Delta 1 is a ligand for the Notch receptor. A homozygous loss-of-function of Delta 1 (&quot;Dll1lacZ/lacZ&quot;) is embryonically lethal. ENU-treated mice were crossed to &quot;Dll1lacZ&quot; heterozygotes. 35 mutant lines were generated in G1 of which 7 revealed modifiers of the Notch signaling pathway.

===Sensitized screens===
In the case of genetic diseases involving multiple genes, mutations in multiple genes contributes to the progression of a disease. Mutation in just one of these genes however, might not contribute significantly to any phenotype. Such &quot;predisposing genes&quot; can be identified using sensitized screens. In this type of a screen, the genetic or environmental background is modified so as to sensitize the mouse to these changes. The idea is that the predisposing genes can be unraveled on a modified genetic or environmental background.
Rinchik et al. performed a sensitized screen of mouse mutants predisposed to Diabetic nephropathy. Mice were treated with ENU on a sensitized background of type-1 diabetes. These diabetic mice had a dominant &quot;Akita&quot; mutation in the insulin-2 gene (&quot;Ins2Akita&quot;). These mice developed albuminuria, a phenotype that was not observed in the non-diabetic offsprings.

==Stability==
Generally speaking, ENU is fairly unstable, which makes it easier to inactivate when used as an experimental mutagen, compared to moderately more stable mutagens like EMS. Pure crystalline ENU is sensitive to light and moisture, so should be stored at in cold and dry conditions, and freshly prepared into solutions when needed. In aqueous solutions, ENU rapidly degrades at a basic pH, and protocols call for inactivation of ENU solutions with an equal volume of 0.1M KOH for 24 hours, with or without ambient light exposure to supplement inactivation.

<text>Alkylation is a chemical reaction that entails transfer of an alkyl group. The alkyl group may be transferred as an alkyl carbocation, a free radical, a carbanion, or a carbene (or their equivalents). Alkylating agents are reagents for effecting alkylation. Alkyl groups can also be removed in a process known as dealkylation. Alkylating agents are often classified according to their nucleophilic or electrophilic character. In oil refining contexts, alkylation refers to a particular alkylation of isobutane with olefins. For upgrading of petroleum, alkylation produces a premium blending stock for gasoline. In medicine, alkylation of DNA is used in chemotherapy to damage the DNA of cancer cells. Alkylation is accomplished with the class of drugs called alkylating antineoplastic agents.

==Nucleophilic alkylating agents==
Nucleophilic alkylating agents deliver the equivalent of an alkyl anion (carbanion). The formal &quot;alkyl anion&quot; attacks an electrophile, forming a new covalent bond between the alkyl group and the electrophile. The counterion, which is a cation such as lithium, can be removed and washed away in the work-up. Examples include the use of organometallic compounds such as Grignard (organomagnesium), organolithium, organocopper, and organosodium reagents. These compounds typically can add to an electron-deficient carbon atom such as at a carbonyl group. Nucleophilic alkylating agents can displace halide substituents on a carbon atom through the SN2 mechanism. With a catalyst, they also alkylate alkyl and aryl halides, as exemplified by Suzuki couplings.
 The SN2 mechanism is not available for aryl substituents, where the trajectory to attack the carbon atom would be inside the ring. Thus, only reactions catalyzed by organometallic catalysts are possible.

==Alkylation by carbon electrophiles==
===C-alkylation===
C-alkylation is a process for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds. The largest example of this takes place in the alkylation units of petrochemical plants, which convert low-molecular-weight alkenes into high octane gasoline components. Electron-rich species such as phenols are also commonly alkylated to produce a variety of products; examples include linear alkylbenzenes used in the production of surfactants like LAS, or butylated phenols like BHT, which are used as antioxidants. This can be achieved using either acid catalysts like Amberlyst, or Lewis acids like aluminium. On a laboratory scale the Friedel–Crafts reaction uses alkyl halides, as these are often easier to handle than their corresponding alkenes, which tend to be gasses. The reaction is catalysed by aluminium trichloride. This approach is rarely used industrially as alkyl halides are more expensive than alkenes.

===N-,P-, S- alkylation===
N-, P-, and S-alkylation are important processes for the formation of carbon-nitrogen, carbon-phosphorus, and carbon-sulfur bonds,

Amines are readily alkylated. The rate of alkylation follows the order tertiary amine &lt; secondary amine &lt; primary amine. Typical alkylating agents are alkyl halides. Industry often relies on green chemistry methods involving alkylation of amines with alcohols, the byproduct being water. Hydroamination is another green method for N-alkylation.

In the Menshutkin reaction, a tertiary amine is converted into a quaternary ammonium salt by reaction with an alkyl halide. Similar reactions occur when tertiary phosphines are treated with alkyl halides, the products being phosphonium salts.
Thiols are readily alkylated to give thioethers via the thiol-ene reaction. The reaction is typically conducted in the presence of a base or using the conjugate base of the thiol. Thioethers undergo alkylation to give sulfonium ions.

===O-alkylation===
Alcohols alkylate to give ethers: 
:&lt;chem&gt;R-OH + R&#x27;-X -&gt; R-O-R&#x27;&lt;/chem&gt;
When the alkylating agent is an alkyl halide, the conversion is called the Williamson ether synthesis.
Alcohols are also good alkylating agents in the presence of suitable acid catalysts. For example, most methyl amines are prepared by alkylation of ammonia with methanol. The alkylation of phenols is particularly straightforward since it is subject to fewer competing reactions.
:&lt;chem&gt;Ph-O- + Me2-SO4 -&gt; Ph-O-Me + Me-SO4-&lt;/chem&gt;
:(with as a spectator ion)

More complex alkylation of a alcohols and phenols involve ethoxylation. Ethylene oxide is the alkylating group in this reaction.

===Oxidative addition to metals===
In the process called oxidative addition, low-valent metals often react with alkylating agents to give metal alkyls. This reaction is one step in the Cativa process for the synthesis of acetic acid from methyl iodide. Many cross coupling reactions proceed via oxidative addition as well.

===Electrophilic alkylating agents===

Electrophilic alkylating agents deliver the equivalent of an alkyl cation. Alkyl halides are typical alkylating agents. Trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate and triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate are particularly strong electrophiles due to their overt positive charge and an inert leaving group (dimethyl or diethyl ether). Dimethyl sulfate is intermediate in electrophilicity.

===Methylation with diazomethane===
Diazomethane is a popular methylating agent in the laboratory, but it is too hazardous (explosive gas with a high acute toxicity) to be employed on an industrial scale without special precautions. Use of diazomethane has been significantly reduced by the introduction of the safer and equivalent reagent trimethylsilyldiazomethane.

===Hazards===
Electrophilic, soluble alkylating agents are often toxic and carcinogenic, due to their tendency to alkylate DNA. This mechanism of toxicity is relevant to the function of anti-cancer drugs in the form of alkylating antineoplastic agents. Some chemical weapons such as mustard gas (sulfide of dichloroethyl) function as alkylating agents. Alkylated DNA either does not coil or uncoil properly, or cannot be processed by information-decoding enzymes.

===Catalysts===

Electrophilic alkylation uses Lewis acids and Brønsted acids, sometimes both. Classically, Lewis acids, e.g., aluminium trichloride, are employed when the alkyl halide are used. Brønsted acids are used when alkylating with olefins. Typical catalysts are zeolites, i.e. solid acid catalysts, and sulfuric acid. Silicotungstic acid is used to manufacture ethyl acetate by the alkylation of acetic acid by ethylene:
:&lt;chem&gt;C2H4 + CH3CO2H -&gt; CH3CO2C2H5&lt;/chem&gt;

==In biology==

Alkylation in biology causes DNA damage. It is the transfer of alkyl groups to the nitrogenous bases. It is caused by alkylating agents such as EMS (Ethyl Methyl Sulphonate). Bifunctional alkyl groups which have two alkyl groups in them cause cross linking in DNA. Alkylation damaged ring nitrogen bases are repaired via the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway.
==Commodity chemicals==
Several commodity chemicals are produced by alkylation. Included are several fundamental benzene-based feedstocks such as ethylbenzene (precursor to styrene), cumene (precursor to phenol and acetone), linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (for detergents).
==Gasoline production==
In a conventional oil refinery, isobutane is alkylated with low-molecular-weight alkenes (primarily a mixture of propene and butene) in the presence of a Brønsted acid catalyst, which can include solid acids (zeolites). The catalyst protonates the alkenes (propene, butene) to produce carbocations, which alkylate isobutane. The product, called &quot;alkylate&quot;, is composed of a mixture of high-octane, branched-chain paraffinic hydrocarbons (mostly isoheptane and isooctane). Alkylate is a premium gasoline blending stock because it has exceptional antiknock properties and is clean burning. Alkylate is also a key component of avgas. By combining fluid catalytic cracking, polymerization, and alkylation, refineries can obtain a gasoline yield of 70 percent. The widespread use of sulfuric acid and hydrofluoric acid in refineries poses significant environmental risks. Ionic liquids are used in place of the older generation of strong Bronsted acids.

==Dealkylation==
Complementing alkylation reactions are the reverse, dealkylations. Prevalent are demethylations, which are prevalent in biology, organic synthesis, and other areas, especially for methyl ethers and methyl amines.

<text>The Atelidae are one of the five families of New World monkeys now recognised. It was formerly included in the family Cebidae. Atelids are generally larger monkeys; the family includes the howler, spider, woolly, and woolly spider monkeys (the latter being the largest of the New World monkeys). They are found throughout the forested regions of Central and South America, from Mexico to northern Argentina.

==Characteristics==
The Atelidae family consists of monkeys that are small to moderate in size, usually 34 to 72 cm in head-body length, with the howler monkeys being the largest members of the group, and the spider monkeys being the smallest. They have long prehensile tails with a sensitive, almost hairless, tactile pad on the underside of the distal part. The tail is frequently used as &#x27;fifth limb&#x27; while moving through the trees where they make their homes. They also have nails on their fingers and toes, enabling them to climb. Most species have predominantly dark brown, grey, or black fur, often with paler markings.

These are arboreal and diurnal animals, with most species restricted to dense rain forest, although some howler monkey species are found in drier forests, or wooded savannah. They mainly eat fruit and leaves, although the smaller species, in particular, may also eat some small insects. They have the dental formula: 

Females give birth to a single infant (or, rarely, twins) after a gestation period of 180 to 225 days. In most species, individuals give birth every one to three years, and there is little, if any, seasonal peak in the number of births.

Atelid monkeys are typically polygamous, and live in social groups with anything up to twenty five adults, depending on species. Where groups are relatively small, as is common amongst the howler monkeys, a single male monopolises a &#x27;harem&#x27; of females, but larger groups will contain several males, with a clear hierarchy of dominance.

==Classification==

Currently, 26 species of extant atelid monkey are recognized, grouped into four genera, and two subfamilies. In addition, a number of extinct species from the fossil record have been identified as being within or closely related to this family.

<text>The Meža (Slovene) or Mieß (German; ) is a river in the Austrian state of Carinthia and in Slovenia, a right tributary of the Drava. It is long, of which are in Slovenia. Its catchment area is , of which in Slovenia.

==Name==
The Meža River was attested as &quot;Mis&quot; in 1361, &quot;Mys&quot; in 1424, and &quot;Miß&quot; in 1476. The name is etymologically related to Czech &quot;Mže&quot; and the Russian river names &quot;Mzha&quot; and &quot;Mozha&quot;, derived from Slavic &quot;*mьz′a&quot; &#x27;dripping, drizzling&#x27;.

==Course==
It has its source on the Austrian side of the border north of Mount Olševa in the Karawanks range, becomes subterranean a kilometre from its source, and reappears on the surface in Koprivna west of Črna na Koroškem in Slovenia. From Črna the river turns northwards and flows between the slopes of the Peca massif and the St. Ursula Mountain to Mežica and Poljana. From here the river again flows eastwards to Prevalje, and Ravne na Koroškem, and into the Drava at Dravograd.

In its first part the Meža falls rapidly and is a typical Alpine river with its tributaries from the Kamnik Alps and the Karawanks mountain range. After Črna it becomes a slow meandering lowland river. Its main tributary is the Mislinja River, which joins the Meža River northwest of the village of Otiški Vrh near Dravograd, only a couple hundred meters before the Meža joins the Drava River.
The Meža Valley ( or ) within the southern Karawanks range was part of the Austrian Duchy of Carinthia up to 1919, before it was ceded to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes according to the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Together with the adjacent Mislinja Valley and Upper Drava Valley, it has formed the traditional Carinthia () region of independent Slovenia since 1991.

The Meža has been the most polluted river in Slovenia. In 1982 the singer-songwriter wrote a song about it titled &quot;&quot; (The Dead River). This song has even been published in primary school textbooks. The main polluter has been the Mežica lead mine and the Ravne Steelworks () conglomerate.

<text>Baron Joicey, of Chester-le-Street in the County of Durham, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1906 for the coal mining magnate and former Liberal Member of Parliament for Chester-le-Street, Sir James Joicey, 1st Baronet. He had already been created a baronet, of Longhirst and of Ulgham, both in the County of Northumberland, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom in 1893. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He was High Sheriff of County Durham in 1910. The second baron lost his son young, and on his death his younger brother succeeded to the barony. The third Baron was an army officer, whose elder son died in WWII without male issue, and he was thus succeeded by his younger son, the fourth baron. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s eldest son, the fifth Baron, who succeeded in 1993.

John Joicey, uncle of the first Baron, was a Liberal politician and coal owner.

The family seat is Etal Manor on the Ford Castle and Etal Castle estate.

<text>Micron Technology, Inc. is an American producer of computer memory and computer data storage including dynamic random-access memory, flash memory, and solid-state drives (SSDs). It is headquartered in Boise, Idaho. Micron&#x27;s consumer products, including the Ballistix line of consumer &amp; gaming memory modules, are marketed under the Crucial brand. Micron and Intel together created IM Flash Technologies, which produced NAND flash memory. It owned Lexar between 2006 and 2017. Micron is the only U.S.-based manufacturer of memory.

== History ==

=== 1978–1999 ===
Micron was founded in Boise, Idaho, in 1978 by Ward Parkinson, Joe Parkinson, Dennis Wilson, and Doug Pitman as a semiconductor design consulting company. Startup funding was provided by local Idaho businessmen Tom Nicholson, Allen Noble, Rudolph Nelson, and Ron Yanke. Later it received funding from Idaho billionaire J. R. Simplot, whose fortune was made in the potato business. In 1981, the company moved from consulting to manufacturing with the completion of its first wafer fabrication unit (&quot;Fab 1&quot;), producing 64K DRAM chips.

In 1984 the company had its initial public offering.

Micron sought to enter the market for RISC processors in 1991 with a product known as FRISC, targeting embedded control and signal processing applications. Running at 80 MHz and described as &quot;a 64-bit processor with fast context-switching time and high floating-point performance&quot;, the design supported various features for timely interrupt handling and featured an arithmetic unit capable of handling both integer and floating-point calculations with a claimed throughput of 80 MFLOPS for double-precision arithmetic. Micron aimed to provide a &quot;board-level demonstration supercomputer&quot; in configurations with 256 MB or 1 GB of RAM. Having set up a subsidiary and with the product being designed into graphics cards and accelerators, Micron concluded in 1992 that the effort would not deliver the &quot;best bang for the buck&quot;, reassigning engineers to other projects and discontinuing the endeavour.

In 1994 founder Joe Parkinson retired as CEO and Steve Appleton took over as Chairman, President, and CEO.

A 1996 3-way merger among ZEOS International, Micron Computer, and Micron Custom Manufacturing Services (MCMS) increased the size and scope of the company; this was followed rapidly with the 1997 acquisition of NetFrame Systems, in a bid to enter the mid-range server industry. Between 1998 and 2000, the company was the main sponsor of the MicronPC Bowl, or MicronPC.com Bowl.

=== Since 2000 ===
In 2000 Gurtej Singh Sandhu and Trung T. Doan at Micron initiated the development of atomic layer deposition high-k films for DRAM memory devices. This helped drive cost-effective implementation of semiconductor memory, starting with 90 nm node DRAM. Pitch double-patterning was also pioneered by Gurtej Singh Sandhu at Micron during the 2000s, leading to the development of 30-nm class NAND flash memory, and it has since been widely adopted by NAND flash and RAM manufacturers worldwide.

In 2002 Micron put its personal computer business up for sale. The company found the business difficult as the number 12 American computer maker with only 1.3 percent of the market.

Micron and Intel created a joint venture in 2005, based in IM Flash Technologies in Lehi, Utah. The two companies formed another joint venture in 2011, IM Flash Singapore, in Singapore. In 2012 Micron became sole owner of this second joint venture. In 2006 Micron acquired Lexar, an American manufacturer of digital media products.

The company again changed leadership in June 2007 with COO Mark Durcan becoming president. In 2008 Micron converted the Avezzano chip fab, formerly a Texas Instruments DRAM fab, into a production facility for CMOS image sensors sold by Aptina Imaging.

In 2008 Micron spun off Aptina Imaging, which was acquired by ON Semiconductor in 2014. Micron retained a stake in the spinoff. However, the core company suffered setbacks and had to layoff 15 percent of its workforce in October 2008, during which period the company also announced the purchase of Qimonda&#x27;s 35.6 percent stake in Inotera Memories for $400 million. The trend of layoffs and acquisitions continued in 2009 with the termination of an additional 2,000 employees, and the acquisition of the FLCOS microdisplay company Displaytech. Micron agreed to buy flash-chip maker Numonyx for $1.27 billion in stock in February 2010.

On 3 February 2012 CEO Appleton died in a plane crash shortly after takeoff from the Boise Airport. He was the pilot and sole occupant of the Lancair IV aircraft. Mark Durcan replaced Appleton as the CEO shortly thereafter, eliminating his former title of President.

In 2013 the Avezzano chip fab was sold to LFoundry. In the 2012 to 2014 period, Micron again went through an acquisition-layoff cycle, becoming the majority shareholder of Inotera Memories, purchasing Elpida Memory for $2 billion and the remaining shares in Rexchip, a PC memory chip manufacturing venture between Powerchip and Elpida Memory for $334 million, while announcing plans to lay off approximately 3,000 workers. Through the Elpida acquisition, Micron became a major supplier to Apple Inc. for the iPhone and iPad. In December 2016 Micron finished acquiring the remaining 67 percent of Inotera, making it a 100 percent subsidiary of Micron.

In April 2017 Micron announced Sanjay Mehrotra as the new president and CEO to replace Mark Durcan. In June 2017 Micron announced it was discontinuing the Lexar retail removable media storage business and putting some or all it up for sale. In August of that year the Lexar brand was acquired by Longsys, a flash memory company based in Shenzhen, China.

In May 2018 Micron Technology and Intel launched QLC NAND memory to increase storage density. The company ranked 150th on the Fortune 500 list of largest United States corporations by revenue.

In February 2019 the first microSD card with a storage capacity of 1 terabyte (TB) was announced by Micron. As of March 2020 3.84TB Micron 5210 Ion is the cheapest large-capacity SSD in the world. In September 2020 the company introduced the world&#x27;s fastest discrete graphics memory solution. Working with computing technology leader Nvidia, Micron debuted GDDR6X in the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 and GeForce RTX 3080 graphics processing units (GPUs). In November 2020, the company unveiled a new 176-layer 3D NAND module. It offers improved read and write latency and is slated to be used in the production of a new generation of solid-state drives.

On 22 October 2021, Micron closed the sale of IM Flash&#x27;s Lehi, Utah fab to Texas Instruments for a sale price of US$900 million. With the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, Micron announced its pledge to invest billions in new manufacturing within the US. In September 2022, Micron announced they would invest $15 billion in a new facility in Boise, Idaho. In October 2022 Micron announced a $100 billion expansion in Clay, New York.

Micron Technology owed Netlist $445 million in damages for infringing Netlist&#x27;s patents related to memory-module technology for high-performance computing. The jury found that Micron&#x27;s semiconductor-memory products violated two of Netlist&#x27;s patents willfully, potentially allowing the judge to triple the damages. Netlist had sued Micron in 2022, accusing three of its memory-module lines of patent infringement, which Micron denied, also arguing the patents&#x27; invalidity. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office invalidated one patent in April 2024.

===Lawsuits===
====Fujian Jinhua====
On 5 December 2017 Micron sued rivals United Microelectronics Corporation and Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co. (JHICC) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging infringement on its DRAM patents and intellectual property rights. The U.S. Justice Department in 2018 announced an indictment against Fujian Jinhua, and authorities added the Chinese firm to the Entity List the same year. Fujian Jinhua vehemently denied the claims, saying it had not stolen any technology, and that &quot;Micron regards the development of Fujian Jinhua as a threat and adopts various means to hamper and destroy the development of Fujian Jinhua,&quot;

In May 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China barred major Chinese information infrastructure firms from purchasing Micron products, citing significant national security risks. The move was seen as retaliation against US sanctions on China&#x27;s semiconductor industry and related export controls. In November 2023 Chinese chipmaker Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp (YMTC) filed a lawsuit against Micron alleging infringement of eight of its patents.

On February 27, 2024, Judge Maxine Chesney of the U.S. Federal District Court in San Francisco acquitted Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, whom Micron had sued for IP theft, of the charge in a non-jury verdict, believing that there was insufficient evidence to support the charge.

<text>Baron Jeffreys is a title that has been created twice, once in the Peerage of England and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The first creation came in the Peerage of England on 16 May 1685 when the lawyer and later Lord Chancellor, Sir George Jeffreys, 1st Baronet, was made Baron Jeffreys, of Wem. He had already been created a Baronet, of Bulstrode in the County of Buckingham, in the Baronetage of England in 1681. The titles became extinct on the death of his son, the second Baron, in 1702, who had no male heir: his daughter, the writer Henrietta Fermor, married the 1st Earl of Pomfret. The estates passed to Jeffreys&#x27;s widow, Lady Charlotte Herbert, who later remarried as Viscountess Windsor.

The next creation came in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1952 when General George Jeffreys was made Baron Jeffreys, of Burkham in the County of Southampton. He had also served as Conservative Member of Parliament for Petersfield. Jeffreys&#x27;s father Arthur Frederick Jeffreys had previously represented Basingstoke in Parliament, and had been admitted to the Privy Council in 1902. Lord Jeffreys was succeeded by his grandson, the second Baron, his son and heir Captain Christopher John Darell Jeffreys (1907–1940) having been killed in action in May 1940. the title is held by the second Baron&#x27;s eldest son, the third Baron, who succeeded in 1986.

The family seat is Bottom Farm, near Grantham, Lincolnshire.

<text>Action 52 is an unlicensed multicart video game compilation developed by Active Enterprises for the Nintendo Entertainment System and by FarSight Technologies for the Sega Genesis. The NES version was released in 1991, followed by the Genesis version in 1993. The multicart consists of 52 games in a variety of genres, mostly scrolling shooters and platformers. The &quot;featured&quot; game is &quot;The Cheetahmen&quot;, which was part of Active&#x27;s failed attempt to create a franchise similar to the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;. Active Enterprises was legally incorporated in The Bahamas, but the offices and development were located in Miami, Florida while the company&#x27;s product warehousing was located in Orlando, Florida.

The NES version of &quot;Action 52&quot; sold poorly and became infamous among gamers for the poor quality and functionality of its games; it is often considered to be one of the worst games of all time. The Genesis version is widely considered superior, though still of subpar quality. Many video game collectors value &quot;Action 52&quot; for its notoriety and rarity. It initially retailed for the comparatively high price of US$199 ().

==Gameplay==
===NES===

The NES version of &quot;Action 52&quot; includes games that cover a variety of genres, the most common types being vertical shooters set in outer space, and platformers. The games have major programming flaws, and some of them freeze or crash, while others include incomplete or endless levels, confusing design, and unresponsive controls.

Each game is given a brief description in the manual for &quot;Action 52&quot;. Some of the descriptions cover games from the early development of &quot;Action 52&quot; that were very different from the games of corresponding titles; for example, &quot;Jigsaw&quot; is described as a game involving a jigsaw puzzle, but the game titled as such on the final product is a platformer involving a construction worker avoiding construction tools.

While most games made no reference to real-world events, &quot;Storm Over The Desert&quot;, one of two games on the cartridge with a proper title screen, is about the Gulf War. The title screen features a rendition of Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. and Saddam Hussein staring at each other from opposite sides of the screen, with the real-life flag of the United States and 1963 flag of Iraq on their respective sides.

The opening sequence of the NES version uses a Yeah! Woo! drum break sampled from Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock&#x27;s song &quot;It Takes Two.&quot;

===Sega Genesis===

Few of the games from the NES version of &quot;Action 52&quot; appear in the Sega Genesis version; although many of the titles have been retained, the games themselves have been rebuilt from scratch for the most part. For example, &quot;Haunted Hills&quot; appears in both versions, but the player character&#x27;s gender is different (female in the NES version and male in the Genesis version), as is the setting, which is inside a haunted house in the NES version, and outside of one in the Genesis version. In the Genesis version of &quot;The Cheetahmen&quot;, the titular characters rescue cheetah cubs from Dr. Morbis and his minions.

Many - though not all - of the numerous technical issues with the NES version have been fixed in the Genesis version, which also takes advantage of the Genesis&#x27;s superior hardware. Each game is color-coded on the main menu screen; &quot;Beginner&quot; games are green, &quot;Intermediate&quot; games are purple, &quot;Expert&quot; games are yellow, &quot;Challenge&quot; games are white, and multiplayer games are blue. The 52nd game, also titled &quot;Challenge&quot;, consists of a random sequence of the highest levels of the other single-player games. Also included in the Genesis version are the Randomizer, which selects a game at random, and a music demo mode.

==Development==
The creator of &quot;Action 52&quot; was Vince Perri, a businessman from Miami, Florida, and the owner and founder of Active Enterprises. According to Perri, &quot;I happened to see my son playing an illegal product made in Taiwan that had 40 games on it. The whole neighborhood went crazy over it ... I figured I&#x27;d do it legally. It&#x27;s obvious when you see something like that, you know there&#x27;s something there&quot;. Perri met Mario González at a recording studio in Miami, Florida where González was working as a sound engineer. He overheard Perri talking to the owner of the studio about him wanting to create a cartridge similar to the bootleg one his son had that contained 52 original games. González informed Perri that he and his friends, Javier Pérez and Albert Hernández, were into making games; the trio created a &quot;Tetris&quot; clone called &quot;Megatris&quot; as proof of their abilities. Perri was impressed with the game and, alongside Raúl Gomila, hired them as well as an unknown fourth developer to create the game, with Hernández acting as the main programmer, González composing the music, and González, Pérez, and the fourth developer working on the graphics.

In 1993, Perri showcased &quot;Action 52&quot; at the International Winter Consumer Electronics Show. He claimed to have raised $5 million for the multicart from private backers in Europe and Saudi Arabia. The developers, who used an Atari ST, were given three months to complete &quot;Action 52&quot;, leaving little time for playtesting and fixing bugs. Technical work was contracted out to Cronos Engineering, Inc., a Boca Raton company who had previously done work for IBM. González, one of the programmers, says that &quot;Action 52&quot;″s developers were flown to Salt Lake City, Utah, where they were trained for a week on using an NES development kit by a video game company, the name of which he does not remember. However, he does recall that the company was developing an NES adaptation of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;; this would identify the company as Sculptured Software. Corroborating this is &quot;Action 52&quot;″s use of Sculptured Software&#x27;s NES music engine. Several pieces of music in the NES version of &quot;Action 52&quot; were plagiarized from sample music composed by Ed Bogas for &quot;The Music Studio&quot;, published by Activision for the Atari ST. Games with plagiarized music include &quot;Fuzz Power&quot;, &quot;Silver Sword&quot;, &quot;French Baker&quot;, &quot;Streemerz&quot;, &quot;Time Warp Tickers&quot; and &quot;Ninja Assault&quot;. González also confirms that, in addition to many unused tiles, &quot;Action 52&quot; has 8 extra game templates, because the distributor configured the cartridges to contain 60 games by default.

According to González, the gaming press&#x27;s characterization of &quot;Action 52&quot; as a &quot;scam&quot; is incorrect. He says that Perri, inspired by his neighborhood&#x27;s reaction to the Taiwanese compilation, fully intended, at least in the beginning, to create and market a legitimate multicart. However, Perri knew little about the video game business when he launched his venture, and as a result made serious errors, such as entrusting the project to programmers who had too little experience, and giving them an insufficient length of time to develop &quot;Action 52&quot;. Perri&#x27;s expectation that the multicart would launch a multimedia &quot;Cheetahmen&quot; franchise was similarly not well-founded, given the game&#x27;s low quality.

===Commercial plans===
&quot;The Cheetahmen&quot; is the featured game of &quot;Action 52&quot;, and was intended to launch a multimedia franchise and an accompanying line of merchandise: a Cheetahmen animated television series, a comic book series and T-shirts were planned. An advertisement for action figures, which included concept art, appeared in a promotional comic book included in the &quot;Action 52&quot; package. However, these plans were eventually cancelled.

Active Enterprises advertised a contest involving &quot;Ooze&quot;, one of the games of &quot;Action 52&quot;. Players who could complete Level 6 of the game could enter a draw for $104,000 ($52,000 cash and a scholarship with the same value). &quot;Ooze&quot; was reported to consistently crash on Level 2; therefore, it was impossible to qualify for the contest without using an emulator. After the contest had been cancelled, a second version of &quot;Action 52&quot; was released which fixed this crashing problem, among some others.

===Sega Genesis development===
The Sega Genesis version of &quot;Action 52&quot; was developed by FarSight Technologies, under the direction of Jay Obernolte, using a Macintosh LC. FarSight&#x27;s experienced programmers, along with the returning Pérez and Hernández (González opted not to participate, in order to spend more time with his girlfriend, whom he would eventually marry), were allowed to spend a year developing this version. FarSight insisted that Active Enterprises playtest it before its release; thus, the resulting multicart had far fewer glitches than the NES version released two years before. Mark Steven Miller and Jason Scher of Nu Romantic Productions composed the music for the Genesis version, in 48 hours. A version of the game for the SNES was planned for release in October 1993 but was canceled. Active Enterprises also planned to have FarSight develop another multicart titled &quot;Sports 5&quot;, but Active folded without releasing either game soon after, and no copies of them are known to exist.

==Reception==
Critical reaction to &quot;Action 52&quot; has been consistently negative. AllGame editor Skyler Miller described the game as an &quot;unlicensed but legal multicart&quot; containing &quot;NES games of extremely poor quality.&quot; Destructoid gave a highly critical review, noting that &quot;there&#x27;s nothing worth playing in the lot.&quot; A Rock, Paper, Shotgun retrospective review in 2019 delivered the similar criticism, stating that &quot;all the games in the collection were creatively bankrupt rush jobs&quot; and that the best games in the collection could be described as &quot;minigames which functioned.&quot;

Atlas Obscura gave similar criticism and noted that there was a remake project in 2010 to remake all of the games in the cartridge due to their low quality and that 23 were completed, but no updates have come from the project since then.

==Legacy==
The 2024 game &quot;UFO 50&quot; had a similar idea behind it, being a compilation of 50 retro-style games. The development team included the creators of &quot;Spelunky&quot; and &quot;Downwell&quot;.

The entirety of &quot;Action 52&quot; has also been covered in a video review by the internet personality and YouTube content creator James Rolfe (as his persona, the Angry Video Game Nerd), which was originally released at Cinemassacre.com on April 30, 2010. Despite his comedic exaggerations, the review pointed out severe cases of repeating themes, crashing or non-functional games, critical bugs, and misleading titles.

<text>Károly Kerényi (, ; 19 January 1897 – 14 April 1973), also known as Karl Kerényi and Karl Kerenyi, was a Hungarian scholar in classical philology and one of the founders of modern studies of Greek mythology.

== Life ==
=== Hungary, 1897–1943 ===
Kerényi was born in Temesvár, Austria-Hungary (now Timișoara, Romania), to Hungarian parents of partly German origin. His father’s family was of Swabian peasant descent. His mother was Karolina Halász. Kerényi learnt German as a foreign language at school, and later chose it as his language for scientific work. He identified himself with the city of Arad, where he attended secondary school, because of its liberal spirits as the city of the 13 martyrs of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848/49. He moved on to study classical philology at the University of Budapest where he mostly appreciated the teaching of the Latinist Géza Némethy as well as of the Indo-Germanist Josef Schmidt. 

After graduation, he travelled extensively in the Mediterranean region and spent time as a visiting student at the Universities of Greifswald, Berlin and Heidelberg, learning from the professors of antiquity and classical philology: Eduard Norden, Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff and Franz Boll. In 1919, Kerényi earned his doctorate in Budapest with a dissertation on &quot;Plato and Longinus, Investigations in Classical Literary and Aesthetic History&quot;. 

Subsequently, he taught Greek and Latin in a secondary school. He earned his postdoctoral lecture qualification (habilitation) in 1927, and was asked in 1934 to become a professor of classical philology and ancient history &quot;(Griechische und Lateinische Philologie und Alte Geschichte)&quot; at the University of Pécs. In Budapest, he continued to lecture as private docent on the history of religions, classical literature and mythology. These were weekly events that were attended by many intellectuals because of their liberal connotations.

After Hungary experienced a strong move to the political right in 1940, the University system was reformed, submitting itself to political pressure. Professors who didn’t subordinate themselves were concentrated at the University of Szeged. Correspondingly, Kerényi was sent there in 1941 against his will, to teach classical antiquity. 

The liberal, pro-western prime minister Miklós Kállay attempted in 1943 to reverse the Nazi-friendly politics of the prior years. He started to send liberal scientists who had already made themselves a name to Western Europe, to show that a liberal, anti-fascist Hungary also existed. As part of this push, the foreign ministry offered Kerényi the opportunity to spend a year in Switzerland with diplomatic status. He accepted on condition that he would stay in Ticino, on the shore of Lago Maggiore, instead of the capital Bern. 

When the Germans entered Hungary in 1944 and installed a right-wing government, Kerényi returned his passport. Like many other Hungarians at the time residing in Switzerland with diplomatic status, he thereby became overnight a stateless, political refugee.

=== Switzerland, 1943–1973 ===
Since 1941, Károly Kerényi was lecturing at the Eranos-conferences in Ascona (Switzerland), to which he had been invited by Carl Gustav Jung. This regular contact with the Swiss psychologist had originally established the connection to Switzerland, which ultimately led to the permanent emigration to the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino. During 1946/47 Kerényi lectured on Hungarian language and literature at the University of Basel. In 1947, he travelled to Hungary to give his inauguration speech at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, with the intent of contributing to the democratic development of Hungary. However, due to warnings of the imminent communist overthrow under Mátyás Rákosi, Kerényi immediately left Budapest again. During the following Stalinist dictatorship, he was discredited and banned by the political propaganda under György Lukács, the leading communist ideologist. His academic title was withdrawn and only as late as 1989 it was reinstated post mortem.

In Switzerland, between 1945 and 1968, the substantial body of his work was written and published. Despite the fact that he was considered an academic outsider, it was during that time that he developed his largest influence as one of the latest representatives of the great tradition of humanistic scholars of antiquity. Over the course of two decades, from 1934 to 1955, Kerényi maintained an active correspondence with the German writer Thomas Mann on many topics, including mythology, religion, humanism and psychology. Since his emigration, Kerényi additionally held positions as visiting professor at several universities, including Bonn (1955/56), Oslo and Rome (1960), Zurich (1961) and Genoa (1964). Between 1960 and 1971, he held annual lectures at conferences of the institute of philosophy of the University of Rome. From 1948 until 1966, Kerényi was co-founder and research director at the C. G. Jung Institute in Küsnacht/Zurich, where he held lectures on mythology until 1962. During these years, he lived near the Monte Verità in Ascona. In 1962, he received Swiss citizenship.

Károly Kerényi died on 14 April 1973 in Kilchberg/Zurich and he is buried in the cemetery of Ascona. His second wife, Magda Kerényi, dedicated her subsequent life to the maintenance and promotion of Kerényi’s legacy. Since her death in 2004, all documentation of Kerényi’s life (photos, correspondence, manuscripts, etc.) that hadn’t been destroyed in Budapest during the war, are archived and accessible at the German Archive for Literature in Marbach (near Stuttgart). His comprehensive library and the estate of Magda Kerényi are at the University of Pécs, where a street has also been named after him.

== Scientific work and philosophical body of thought ==

=== Philological foundation ===
In early years, Károly Kerényi was mainly influenced by philosophers like Schopenhauer, Bachofen and Nietzsche, writers like Hölderlin and Rilke, and scholars like Wilhelm von Humboldt. At the time of his studies of classical philology, Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff was the most influential philologist. However, for Kerényi, Erwin Rohde’s line of thought on the fictional literature in antiquity was more important. This led to his first book &quot;Die griechisch-orientalische Romanliteratur in religionsgeschichtlicher Beleuchtung. Ein Versuch (The Greek-Oriental Romances in the Light of the History of Religions)&quot;, with which he earned his postdoctoral qualification. 

Early afterwards, in 1929, Kerényi grew weary of the official scholarly line of philology. He increasingly saw the objective of philology in critically analyzing the written record of antiquity as a representation of real life, just like archeology is dedicated to the record of antiquity through actual touch. The first steps away from the official line were his early books &quot;Apollon&quot; (a collection of essays) and &quot;Die antike Religion (Religion in Antiquity)&quot;. Throughout his life, Kerényi explored every classical site of the entire Mediterranean. In 1929, he met Walter F. Otto in Greece for the first time, who would prove to influence him greatly. Otto inspired Kerényi to focus on the religious element of human life in antiquity as the core element, thereby combining the historical with the theological focus. This is highlighted in his works &quot;Mythologie der Griechen&quot; and &quot;Mysterien der Eleusis (Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter)&quot;.

=== Dissociation from Wilamowitz and the German idea of &quot;myth&quot; ===
Thereafter, Károly Kerényi consciously started to distance himself from the philology taught by Wilamowitz. In Kerényi’s understanding, Wilamowitz’ approach stood for an authoritarianism that lay beneath the emergence of National Socialism in Germany, which he couldn’t ethically support. Kerényi hence developed an increasingly hostile position towards the German idea of myth, which was used as reference by Nazi-Germany. As early as 1934, he expressed his clear-sighted horror at the radicalizing developments in Germany. It became a continuous objective of Kerényi to establish a liberal and human-psychological idea of myth that could not be abused for nationalistic ideology. This also influenced his position towards several of his scientific mentors. With regards to Wilamowitz, this was most pronounced, but later, Kerényi also started to distance himself from those aspects in Otto’s and Mann’s understanding of myth that he saw reflected in German nationalism.

=== Psychological expansion of mythology ===
Károly Kerényi’s scientific interpretation of the figures of Greek mythology as archetypes of the human soul was in line with the approach of the Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung. Together with Jung, he endeavored to establish mythology as a science in its own right. Jung described Kerényi as having &quot;supplied such a wealth of connections [of psychology] with Greek mythology that the cross-fertilization of the two branches of science can no longer be doubted.&quot; Kerényi compiled in collaboration with Jung the two editions &quot;Das göttliche Kind in mythologischer und psychologischer Beleuchtung (The Myths of the Divine Child)&quot; and &quot;Das göttliche Mädchen (The Divine Maiden)&quot;, which were published together under the title &quot;Einführung in das Wesen der Mythologie (Essays on a Science of Mythology)&quot; in 1941. Kerényi saw the theory of religion as a human and humanistic topic which coined his reputation as humanist further. For him, every view of mythology had to be a view of man – and hence &quot;theology&quot; always had to be at the same time, &quot;anthropology&quot;. In this humanist spirit, Kerényi defined himself as &quot;philological-historical&quot; as well as &quot;psychological scholar&quot;. In later years, Kerényi evolved his psychological interpretation further and replaced the concept of archetypes with one that he labeled &quot;’Urbild’&quot;. This became particularly clear in some of his most important publications: &quot;Prometheus,&quot; as well as in &quot;Dionysos&quot;, likely Kerényi’s most crucial work, which he had started as an idea in 1931 and finished writing in 1969. Kerényi hence looked at the appearances in Greek religion not as curiosities, but as expressions of real human experience. As a historian of myth as it was embedded in the details of Hellenic culture, its &quot;characteristic social existence&quot; as he put it, Kerényi opposed his &quot;differentiated thinking about the concrete realities of human life&quot; with the &quot;summary thinking&quot; that represented for him the influence of Sir James Frazer on the study of the peoples of antiquity and Greek religion especially.

=== Kerényi as cultural anthropologist ===
Not least as a result of his own personal experience, Károly Kerényi highlighted the role of the philologist as &quot;interpreter&quot;, whereby &quot;the better he interprets, the more he becomes himself the subject, both as receiver as well as messenger. His whole essence and being, his structure and his own experiences, become a factor that cannot be overlooked for interpretation.” In this sense, Kerényi’s understanding of science was very modern in 1944. In a time when human sciences were trying to establish themselves as objective-scientific, he recognized that the only means by which to achieve scientific objectivity was by disclosing each scholar&#x27;s own individual subjectivity. Kerényi also anticipated a paradigm shift of the late 20th century, by subscribing to an interdisciplinary approach that combined the subjects of human sciences including literature, art, history, philosophy and religion. The inclusion of fictional writing into his studies of mythology and humanism is also documented by the publications of his correspondence with Thomas Mann and Hermann Hesse. Kerényi published a further series of thoughts on European humanism in 1955 with the title &quot;Geistiger Weg Europas (Europe’s Intellectual Journey)&quot;. Among the numerous personalities with whom Kerényi maintained important personal and scholarly interaction were the Hungarian poets László Németh, Antal Szerb and Pál Gulyás, the psychologist Leopold Szondi, the writer Otto Heuschele and the historian Carl Jacob Burckhardt. Thanks to his essay-style, Kerényi managed to speak a language that was easily understandable, but it also meant he remained relatively isolated in academic philology.

In Hungary, Károly Kerényi’s scientific achievements remained during his lifetime only known to a small circle of intellectuals. Of all his publications, only few have been published in Hungarian. As a prominent member of the former Hungarian intellectual establishment and the bearer of an aristocratic name, he was banished from Hungarian cultural life since the 1940s for being too liberal, first by the right-wing pro-Nazi governments, and later by the communist regime. Even though Kerényi was fiercely defended by famous Hungarian writers like Laszlo Németh and Antal Szerb, it took until the 1980s before his complete moral and scholarly rehabilitation took place. The Hungarian writer Antal Szerb has modeled some features of Károly Kerényi into the figure Rudi Waldheim in his novel Journey by Moonlight.

<text>The Toronto-Dominion Centre, or TD Centre, is an office complex of six skyscrapers in the Financial District of downtown Toronto owned by Cadillac Fairview. It serves as the global headquarters for its anchor tenant, the Toronto-Dominion Bank, and provides office and retail space for many other businesses. The complex consists of six towers and a pavilion covered in bronze-tinted glass and black-painted steel. Approximately 21,000 people work in the complex, making it the largest commercial office complex in Canada.

The project was the inspiration of Allen Lambert, former president and chairman of the board of the Toronto-Dominion Bank. Sister-in-law Phyllis Lambert recommended Ludwig Mies van der Rohe as design consultant to the architects, John B. Parkin and Associates and Bregman + Hamann, and the Fairview Corporation as the developer. The towers were completed between 1967 and 1991. An additional building was built outside the campus and purchased in 1998. As Mies was given &quot;virtually a free hand to create Toronto-Dominion Centre&quot;, the complex, as a whole and in its details, is a classic example of his unique take on the International style and represents the end evolution of Mies&#x27;s North American period.

==Background==
After the 1955 merger of the Bank of Toronto and the Dominion Bank solidified in 1962, the Toronto-Dominion bank directors decided to commission a new headquarters to demonstrate the bank&#x27;s emergence as a reputable national institution. Allen Lambert, past-president and chairman of the board of the Toronto-Dominion Bank, secured a cooperative partnership in the late 1950s with the Bronfman-owned developer, Fairview Corporation (now Cadillac Fairview); this marked a first for the development process in Canada, in that a bank, rather than creating its head office alone, had aligned itself with real estate interests and the city to influence urban space. The partnership was established as a 50–50 relationship, with the bank having the final say on the design of the complex and Phyllis Lambert—sister-in-law to Allen Lambert and a member of the Bronfman family—was called in as an advisor on the TD Centre competition. Gordon Bunshaft, then chief designer of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, was hired by the consortium. His proposal called for exterior structural supports for the main office tower, which then necessitated piston-like slip joints at the roof level to deal with weather-related expansion and contraction of the structure. Phyllis Lambert objected to this submission, later stating in an interview that it &quot;was a ridiculous proposal on many levels... Even in a milder climate, it would have been problematic.&quot; Bunshaft, due to his refusal to redesign, was relieved of his commission.

This left John Parkin, the local architect who would have worked with the American Bunshaft, to design Toronto-Dominion Centre. His firm put forward a model showing a 100-storey, all-concrete tower—to be the largest in the Commonwealth—standing over a plaza with a sunken courtyard containing a circular banking pavilion. It was at this point that Phyllis Lambert insisted that Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (whom she knew from having been the director of planning on his Seagram Building) be called for an interview. Mies was unimpressed by Parkin&#x27;s concept and wondered why one would design a building to be entered through its basement. With this, the Parkin proposal was scrapped and Allen Lambert was convinced to bring Mies on board. Though he was technically commissioned as the design consultant to the local architects (who were still John B. Parkin and Associates, but partnered with Bregman + Hamann Architects), the project was essentially Mies&#x27;s design in its entirety, demonstrating all the key characteristics of the architect&#x27;s unique style.

The choice of Mies and his design gave the project the added significance of being a symbol of Toronto&#x27;s emergence as a major city. It also marked Mies&#x27;s last major work before his death in 1969. This followed the precedent set by the previous incarnation of the Toronto-Dominion Bank: the Bank of Toronto&#x27;s 1862 office at Wellington and Church Streets had been designed by William Kauffman and its 1913 Beaux-Arts headquarters were conceived by Carrère and Hastings. Both firms were the most renowned and respected architects of their times.

==History==
===Construction===

The development of the TD Centre required Fairview to acquire a full city block of downtown Toronto, except for some frontages on Bay Street and at the corner of King and York Streets. Among notable losses from the subsequent demolition were the Rossin House Hotel, which dated to the 1850s and was once one of the city&#x27;s preeminent hotels. The Carrère and Hastings Bank of Toronto headquarters, at the southwest corner of King and Bay Streets, was also razed despite protests urging that the Beaux-Arts building be incorporated into the new centre. Fairview officials brushed these aside and said that it &quot;did not fit in&quot;. Elements of the old edifice can still be found as relics in Guild Park and Gardens, in Scarborough.

The first structure completed was the Toronto-Dominion Bank Tower (now the TD Bank Tower) in 1967. Though the complex remained unfinished, the official opening took place on 16 May of that year to coincide with the Canadian Centennial celebrations, with Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy, presiding, accompanied by her husband, Sir Angus Ogilvy.

At , the tower was the tallest building in Canada when completed. The completion of the banking pavilion and the Royal Trust Tower (now the TD North Tower) followed in 1968 and 1969, respectively. The Commercial Union Tower (now the TD West Tower) was added in 1974 and was the first on the site not conceived by Mies in his plan. It was followed by the IBM Tower (now the TD South Tower), built south of Wellington Street across from the original campus in 1985. The 23-storey building at 95 Wellington Street was completed in 1987 and contains . Cadillac Fairview acquired it in 1998 and incorporated it into Toronto-Dominion Centre. Finally with little available space left on or near the block, the final building—the Ernst &amp; Young Tower (now 222 Bay Street)—was constructed in 1992 over the existing 1930s Toronto Stock Exchange.

===1960s–2000===

From November 27–30, 1967, the 54th floor of the newly finished Toronto-Dominion Bank Tower was the venue of the centennial year Confederation of Tomorrow conference, a summit of provincial premiers (except for W.A.C. Bennett) convened by Ontario Premier John Robarts. It was an unsuccessful attempt to achieve a provincial agreement for amendments to the constitution of Canada proposed by Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson.

In 1993, Garry Hoy, a 39-year-old lawyer of Holden Day Wilson, plunged 24 floors to his death after repeatedly charging a window while attempting to demonstrate its strength to a group of visiting law students.

=== 21st century ===

The original three buildings and the plazas of Toronto–Dominion Centre were together recognized as a part of Ontario&#x27;s built heritage in 2005, when an Ontario Heritage Trust plaque was unveiled by Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, his wife, Sophie, Countess of Wessex, and former lieutenant governor of Ontario Lincoln Alexander. The complex has been designated under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act since 2003. The designation notes &quot;The Toronto-Dominion Centre is an outstanding example of the International Style of architecture.&quot; The concrete foundations, the load-bearing black-painted steel frames, the bronze-tinted glass curtain walls with mullions and a grid of exposed and painted steel I-beams, the revolving doors at the bases and, on the towers, the pilotis, are noted architectural features on the exterior of the buildings. Inside, &quot;the interior finishes (granite, marble, travertine, and oak) and custom-built fittings in the Banking Pavilion, in the lobbies of the Toronto-Dominion Bank Tower and the Royal Trust Tower&quot; are recognized heritage attributes.

In 2007, the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada declared the TD Centre a masterpiece of the twentieth century.

In May 2017, to mark the 50th anniversary of the complex and Canada&#x27;s 150th birthday, the buildings became the canvas of an art exhibition by Montreal artist Aude Moreau in which the buildings were used as a canvas to spell out “LESS IS MORE OR,” a take on Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s famous expression. While this type of installation had been done elsewhere, this was the largest undertaking of its kind in the world.

==Site==
As with the Seagram Building and a number of Mies&#x27;s subsequent projects, the Toronto-Dominion Centre follows the theme of the darkly coloured, steel and glass edifice set in an open plaza, itself surrounded by a dense and erratic, pre-existing urban fabric. The TD Centre, however, comprises a collection of structures spread across a granite plinth, all regulated in three dimensions and from the largest scale to the smallest, by a mathematically ordered, grid.

Three structures were conceived: a low banking pavilion anchoring the site at the corner of King and Bay Streets, the main tower in the centre of the site, and another tower in the northwest corner, each structure offset to the adjacent by one bay of the governing grid, allowing views to &#x27;slide&#x27; open or closed as an observer moves across the court. The rectilinear pattern of Saint-Jean granite pavers follows the grid, serving to organize and unify the complex, and the plaza&#x27;s surface material extends through the glass lobbies of the towers and the banking pavilion, blurring the distinction between interior and exterior space. The remaining voids between the buildings create space for the plaza and lawn.

Phyllis Lambert wrote of the centre and the arrangement of its elements within the site:
More towers were added over the ensuing decades, outside the periphery of the original site—as they were not part of Mies&#x27;s master plan for the TD Centre—but still positioned close enough, and in such locations, as to visually impact the sense of space within areas of the centre, forming Miesian western and southern walls to the lawn and a tall eastern flank to the plaza.

===Pavilion===

The banking pavilion is a double-height structure housing the main branch of the bank. It contains fifteen modules within a single interior space, with smaller areas inside the pavilion cordoned off using counters and cabinets, all built with the typical rich materials of Mies&#x27;s palette—marble, English oak, and granite. The roof of the building is made of deep steel I-sections, each beam supported on only one steel I-section column at each end, all combined to create a waffle-grid ceiling resting on a row of corresponding, equally spaced columns around the periphery. This structure was both a further development on the post office pavilion of the Federal Center in Chicago—which has fewer expressed columns and a second level balcony—and a precursor to the Neue Nationalgalerie completed in Berlin in 1968—which had a similar roof supported on only eight large steel columns. The TD Centre pavilion was described by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; as &quot;among the best spaces Mies ever made&quot;.

The banking pavilion&#x27;s living roof was installed as part of Cadillac Fairview&#x27;s goal of having the entire complex LEED-certified by 2013. It is intended to help protect the building from solar heat gain, reduce storm runoff, and contributes to air quality.

==== TD Conference Centre ====

The area below the Pavilion serves as the TD Bank Conference Centre, completed in 2018.

The space was originally home to a 690-seat Famous Players movie theatre, which would prove to be one of the most fertile palettes for Mies&#x27;s minimalist aesthetic. The first screenings were &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; and &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot;. The cinema was used for gala events such as the Canadian Film Awards, now the Canadian Screen Awards, and the Toronto International Film Festival. The theatre operated for approximately one decade until, in 1978, the space was repurposed in light of the proliferation of multiplexes throughout the city. The space was used for offices and storage until its eventual transformation into a conference centre.

=== Public space ===

Between the towers are two large expanses, collectively known as Oscar Peterson Place. The northern space contains a more formal tract of granite, while the southern space contains the lawn and features &quot;The Pasture&quot;, a sculpture by Saskatchewan artist Joe Fafard, who died in early 2019. In addition to serving as sanctuaries for building occupants, the plazas have hosted events spanning music, athletics, entertainment and fundraising. The plazas were the first examples of privately provided large-scale public outdoor spaces within the urban core of Toronto. The space was named as part of the Toronto Legacy Project; Montreal-born jazz legend Oscar Peterson was on-hand for the ceremony.

===Towers===

The height of each of Mies&#x27;s two towers is proportioned to its width and depth. All, save for 95 Wellington Street West, are of similar construction and appearance: the frame is of structural steel, including the core (containing elevators, stairs, washrooms, and other service spaces), and floor plates are of concrete poured on steel deck. The lobby is a double-height space on the ground floor, articulated by large sheets of plate glass held back from the exterior column line, providing for an overhang around the perimeter of the building, behind which the travertine-clad elevator cores are the only elements to touch the ground plane. Above the lobby, the building envelope is curtain wall made of bronze-coloured glass in a matte-black painted steel frame, with exposed I-sections attached to the vertical mullions and structural columns; the modules of this curtain wall are by , thereby conforming to the overall site template.

The south side of the 54th floor houses Canoe, an Oliver &amp; Bonacini restaurant.

The 55th floor of the TD Bank Tower is now leased office space but was originally a large public indoor observation platform. This promontory allowed uninterrupted views of the development of the downtown core that the TD Centre had itself helped to spark, as well as Lake Ontario to the south. The floor was repurposed to office space when the CN Tower was completed in 1976, offering a viewing height of .

====Technical details====
=== Underground concourse ===

The shopping concourse was seamlessly integrated beneath the towers — the first such mall in Canada — and was the genesis of Toronto&#x27;s PATH system. Extending into this area was Mies&#x27;s strict design sense; it was fitted in the same black aluminum and travertine as the main lobbies above. To maintain the clean and ordered aesthetic of the environment, Mies stipulated, with the backing of Phyllis and Alan Lambert, that the storefronts consist only of the glass panels and black aluminium that he specified. Even signage graphics were restricted to only white backlit letters within a black aluminium panel and only in the specific font that Mies had designed for the TD Centre. Renovations to the mall, beginning in the late 1990s, caused some controversy within the architectural community as building management, under pressure from retail tenants seeking greater visibility, relaxed the strict design guidelines and allowed more individual signage. Ceilings were also renovated from the original flat drywall planes with recessed lights to coffered ceilings.

==Occupants==
The Toronto-Dominion Bank serves as the anchor tenant of the office complex.

=== TD Gallery of Inuit Art ===
The TD Gallery of Inuit Art is a permanent gallery located in the southern half of the TD South Tower lobby. It is open to the public, free, through a partnership between TD Bank, the world&#x27;s largest collector of Inuit art, and Cadillac Fairview, the property owner in whose lobby space the gallery is hosted.

The bank&#x27;s association with Inuit art can be traced to the Northwest Territories, where branch manager Allen Lambert oversaw its Yellowknife operation from 1946 to 1947. The branch was a two-room log cabin, with Lambert working in the front and living in the back. Lambert developed a keen interest in the art being produced by local artists. Twenty years later, as Chairman of the Toronto-Dominion Bank, he launched a Centennial project that would establish the bank as a strong ally in providing Inuit art with exposure within the organization and beyond.

=== Design Exchange ===
The easternmost tower, 222 Bay Street, contains in its base the historic Toronto Stock Exchange building, built in 1937. Since 1994, it has been home to the Design Exchange (‘DX&#x27;), Canada’s only museum dedicated to &quot;design excellence&quot;. The genesis of the Design Exchange was a citizen movement seeking a centre that would celebrate the role of design in society. The group worked with the city for several years to bring the concept to fruition and, in 1994, the Design Exchange was officially opened by Prime Minister Jean Chrétien.

Design Exchange has mounted hundreds of exhibitions, seminars, lectures, conferences and educational programs related to the role of design in culture, industry, and business. In 2017, DX launched a 10-day festival called Expo for Design, Innovation &amp; Technology (EDIT), in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme.

== Branding system and signage ==

The TD Centre represents one of commercial real estate&#x27;s most comprehensive branding systems. Sans Copperplate Gothic was Mies&#x27;s signature font, as he believed it reflected the calmness and order of the architecture, and he decreed that it be used universally throughout the TD Centre. To this day, the font is used not just on exterior signs and wayfinding, but also for such communications as artwork captions, fire hose cases and designated smoking areas.

Originally, the branding system extended to the stores in the underground shopping mall, such that all of the storefronts displayed their names in an identical font in white against black. However, in the late 1990s, under pressure from retail tenants seeking greater visibility, building management relaxed its requirements and allowed stores to customize their signage to their individual brands. This caused some controversy within the design and architecture community.

There was further controversy in 2015 when TD Bank affixed its green-and-white logo atop two of the towers. Although these signs contravene Mies&#x27;s strict minimalist vision, the city could not and did not officially oppose the move because the two towers in question were built after Mies&#x27;s death and are not designated as historic. TD Bank had previously been the sole member of the Big Five banks not to have its logo visible on the Toronto skyline, until a green-and-white &quot;TD&quot; logo was added to spire of the Canada Trust Tower in 2000. 

==Programs==
The TD Centre often participates in the annual Doors Open Toronto, providing visitors with behind-the-scenes access to various parts of the property. The 54th-floor executive office space is often showcased but, for 2019, the focus was the recently completed conference centre.

=== Environment ===
The TD Centre has developed one of the most comprehensive environmental programs in the Canadian real estate industry, “promoting sweeping sustainability initiatives across the complex.” In 2004, the TD Centre was one of the founding sponsors of the Enwave Deep Lake Cooling System, which significantly reduces the need for air conditioning during the summer months. In 2009, a living roof consisting of 11,000 grass plants was installed atop the 22,000 ft² banking pavilion through a partnership with TD Bank. The planter boxes maintain the 1.5m² grid pattern of the pavilion&#x27;s ceiling below, allowing the roof to also give new life to Mies&#x27;s original vision. The property has a waste diversion rate of 84%, almost double the industry average. It has reduced its annual carbon footprint by over 50%, from 12over 50,000 tCO2e in 2008 to 19,500 tCO2e in 2018. It has reduced irrigation water usage by 60% through a wireless Nano-Climate system. It was an early adopter of daytime cleaning, which led to reduced energy usage and improved quality of life for the complex&#x27;s 180 cleaning staff. By 2015, all six towers were certified to LEED EB: O&amp;M Platinum and BOMA BEST (three Gold, three Platinum). In 2017, the 222 Bay Street Tower received WELL gold-level certification, the first existing building in North America to do so. Also in 2017, the TD Centre was the first existing building in Canada to achieve Platinum under the Wired standard. The TD Centre has been publishing an annual sustainability report since 2013.

==In popular culture==

The TD Bank Tower is used for exterior shots of Jabot Cosmetics&#x27; headquarters on the CBS daytime soap opera, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;.

The TD Bank Tower and TD North Tower are used for exterior and lobby shots of the Pierce &amp; Pierce offices in the 2000 film &quot;American Psycho&quot;.

<doc id="487467" wikidata="Q692136" url="?curid=487467" title="1920 Carinthian plebiscite">
<text>The Carinthian plebiscite (, ) was held on 10 October 1920 in the area in southern Carinthia predominantly settled by Carinthian Slovenes. It determined the final border between the Republic of Austria and the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslavia) after World War I. The predominantly Slovene-speaking plebiscite area voted to remain part of Austria with a 59% majority.

==Background==
After the defeat of the multi-ethnic Austria-Hungary and the ruling Habsburg dynasty in World War I, new states arose in its former territory. Among these there was an internationally unrecognized State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which was created in the final days of the war according to the 1917 Corfu Declaration, and merged with the Kingdom of Serbia to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes on December 1, 1918.

Determination of borders between the new countries was complex and difficult, and not always peaceful: While the northwestern border with the Kingdom of Italy along the &quot;Julian March&quot; was already determined by the 1915 Treaty of London, the demarcation line between Yugoslavia and the rump state of German-Austria was a difficult and highly disputed matter. The principle of self-determination, championed by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, was taken up by both Slovenes and German-Austrians in the Carinthian, Styrian and Carniolan lands of the defunct Habsburg empire. The rising tensions culminated in clashes of arms, as on Marburg&#x27;s Bloody Sunday in Lower Styria and the continued fighting of paramilitary groups in southeastern Carinthia.

In particular the &quot;Carinthian question&quot; had become an issue in the closing days of World War I, when events developed rapidly, beginning with territorial claims by the Slovenian National Assembly on October 17, 1918. These claims were rejected by the Carinthian provisional &quot;Landtag&quot; assembly on 25 October 1918, declaring the state&#x27;s accession to German-Austria. From November 5, Yugoslav forces moved into the settlement area of the Carinthian Slovenes from the Karawanks mountain range down to the Drava River and beyond. The &quot;Landtag&quot; assembly fled from Klagenfurt to the northwestern town of Spittal an der Drau and on 11 November officially demanded self-determination, which in this case amounted to demanding a plebiscite for a region with a mixed population.

With the occupation of southeastern Carinthia by Yugoslav troops, the confrontation evolved into armed clashes. The provisional Carinthian government under Governor decided to take up arms to preserve the southern Carinthian border on the Karawanks range. The bitter fighting of paramilitary groups around Arnoldstein and Ferlach alarmed the Entente powers. They arbitrated a ceasefire, whereafter a nine-day U.S. Army commission under Lt.Col. Sherman Miles scouted the disputed region in January and February 1919 and made the crucial recommendation that the Karawanks frontier should be retained, thus opening the possibility of a plebiscite. Yugoslav representatives urged for a border on the Drava; American delegates however spoke in favor of preserving the unity of the Klagenfurt Basin and convinced the British and French delegations. Until May 7, all occupied Carinthian territories were vacated. When Yugoslav forces under General Rudolf Maister made an attempt to re-enter the region on 28 May 1919, they were forced to withdraw by the Entente authorities.

The question was whether the considerable Slovene-speaking majority in the state&#x27;s southeastern region, adjoining the Karawanks range, would carry the vote for union with Austria or whether that majority wished to join a newly created South Slavic state. This was to a large extent a consequence of rising romantic nationalism under the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy and the idea of an autonomy of the &quot;Slovene lands&quot;, referring to the early medieval Slavic principality of Carantania, which had perished in the ninth century. A common state with other South Slavic peoples seemed the most acceptable compromise toward fulfillment of nationalist strivings.

==Plebiscite==

The Treaty of Saint-Germain with the Republic of Austria, signed on 10 September 1919, should have determined the Austrian-Yugoslav border. It ascertained that some small parts of Carinthia—i.e. the Meža Valley () with the town of Dravograd (&quot;Unterdrauburg&quot;) and the Jezersko (&quot;Seeland&quot;) municipal area—should be incorporated into the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, while the fate of wider southeastern Carinthia area down to the Klagenfurt basin was to be determined by a plebiscite.

Wanting to resolve the conflict peacefully, the Allied victors in World War I divided southeastern Carinthia into two zones, &quot;A&quot; in the south and &quot;B&quot; in the north. A two-stage referendum was to be held to determine annexation by either Austria or the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, in the smaller Zone B only if a majority of the people in Zone A had voted for Yugoslavia. The population of Zone A was predominantly Slovene-speaking: according to the pre-war Austrian census of 1910, people in these municipalities who used Slovene as their primary language represented nearly 70% of the population; while the number of ethnic Slovenes was probably higher. German speakers were concentrated in the town of Völkermarkt and certain smaller localities, especially around Bleiburg () and Ferlach (&quot;Borovlje&quot;).

Before the plebiscite, both sides waged intensive propaganda campaigns. Austrian propaganda emphasized the economic benefits of maintaining the unity of the Klagenfurt Basin and appealed to feelings of Carinthian unity and brotherhood between the Slovene- and German-speaking peoples of Carinthia. Conducted in the Slovene Carinthian dialect, Austrian propaganda promised that the Slovene language and national identity would be treated as equal to the German in Austria, officially confirmed by the Carinthia &quot;Landtag&quot; assembly two weeks before the plebiscite was held. It nevertheless also had an anti-Yugoslav tendency, picturing the conditions in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes as chaotic. Yugoslav propaganda almost exclusively used arguments emphasizing Slovene national awareness. It took an aggressive anti-German view from the beginning and turned to economic issues only in the last few weeks before the plebiscite. The campaigners were not capable of using the political instability of the young Austrian republic and its then unenviable position in the international community for advantage.

Despite the six-months term determined by the Treaty of Saint-Germain, the referendum was not held in Zone A until October 10, 1920. In addition to changing the date of the plebiscite, other terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain allegedly were ignored or changed: an Austrian representative was accepted into the commission, and the plebiscite commission changed rules by not allowing the Yugoslav military to control the border between Zones A and B on 8 June 1920. Instead the Yugoslav army had to withdraw from Zone A in accord with the decision of the plebiscite commission on 18 September 1920. Changes may also have been made in electoral registers which allowed people from northern Zone B voting in Zone A, backing the Austrian side. In the following decades both sides would continue to interpret and instrumentalize the plebiscite&#x27;s circumstances in their own way.

==Results==
The outcome of the plebiscite held on 10 October, was 22,025 votes (59.1% of the total cast) in favor of adhesion to Austria and 15,279 (40.9%) in favor of annexation by the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. Assuming that the whole German-speaking minority had voted for Austria, half of all Carinthian Slovenes had also decided to remain with the Republic. While a majority in the remote Alpine villages on the slopes of the Karawanks range voted for Yugoslavia, the inhabitants of the densely settled Klagenfurt Basin were motivated by their evolved social and cultural, not least economic ties to the central Carinthian region. 
After the Austrian option had gained a majority of votes in predominantly Slovene Zone A, the second stage of the referendum in northern Zone B, populated chiefly by German speakers, was not carried out. Another Yugoslav foray was fiercely rejected by the Entente powers. The Carinthian Plebiscite region was placed under Austrian administration on 18 November 1920 and declared part of the sovereign Austrian Republic on November 22. Up to today, October 10 is a public holiday in the State of Carinthia.

The plebiscite ultimately determined the border between Austria and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. The border remained unchanged after World War II, even as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia gave way to Tito&#x27;s Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia, though at the end of the war Yugoslav Partisans again briefly occupied the area, including the capital city of Klagenfurt. Since the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the border has separated Austria and Slovenia.

==Yugoslav resistance==
The Yugoslav government in Belgrade initially declared victory in the plebiscite. After it became clear that the residents had voted in favor of Austria, Yugoslavia moved troops into the zone and occupied several towns; the military commanders stated that they did not recognize the authority of the plebiscite commission. At the same time, it was reported that there were riots, looting of shops, and beatings of ethnic Germans in nearby Maribor, which had a large German population but had been awarded to Yugoslavia in 1919. In late October, the Yugoslav government agreed to honor the outcome of the plebiscite and withdraw its troops from the zone.

===Libeliče===
The residents of Libeliče (), the easternmost village of Zone A, were pro-Yugoslav and helped organize pro-Yugoslav rallies throughout Zone A prior to the plebiscite. On the day of the plebiscite, a large majority of the village voted for Yugoslavia; however, along with the rest of Zone A it was placed under Austrian administration. The people of the village were unwilling to accept the outcome. On a daily basis, the barbed wire on the border was cut and boundary stones were removed. Regular rallies in the village and its surroundings encouraged increasingly more people to join the rebellion, deliberately ignoring any Austrian law passed after the plebiscite. The coordinators of the rebellion managed to establish contact with high-ranking politicians in Ljubljana and later also in Belgrade. Finally, the governments of Austria and Yugoslavia managed to agree on a territorial exchange: Austria ceded to Yugoslavia the territory of Libeliče and received in compensation an equally sized area on the left bank of the Drava, consisting of the predominantly German-speaking settlements of Rabenstein () and Lorenzenberg (), which are today cadastral communities within the market town of Lavamünd. The handover of the territories took place on October 1, 1922. This was the final demarcation between Austria and Yugoslavia (and its current legal successor Slovenia), still effective as of today.

<doc id="487471" wikidata="Q2507783" url="?curid=487471" title="GOST (block cipher)">
<text>The GOST block cipher (Magma), defined in the standard GOST 28147-89 (RFC 5830), is a Soviet and Russian government standard symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 64 bits. The original standard, published in 1989, did not give the cipher any name, but the most recent revision of the standard, GOST R 34.12-2015 (RFC 7801, RFC 8891), specifies that it may be referred to as Magma. The GOST hash function is based on this cipher. The new standard also specifies a new 128-bit block cipher called Kuznyechik. 

Developed in the 1970s, the standard had been marked &quot;Top Secret&quot; and then downgraded to &quot;Secret&quot; in 1990. Shortly after the dissolution of the USSR, it was declassified and it was released to the public in 1994. GOST 28147 was a Soviet alternative to the United States standard algorithm, DES. Thus, the two are very similar in structure.

==The algorithm==

GOST has a 64-bit block size and a key length of 256 bits. Its S-boxes can be secret, and they contain about 354 (log2(16!8)) bits of secret information, so the effective key size can be increased to 610 bits; however, a chosen-key attack can recover the contents of the S-boxes in approximately 232 encryptions.

GOST is a Feistel network of 32 rounds. Its round function is very simple: add a 32-bit subkey modulo 232, put the result through a layer of S-boxes, and rotate that result left by 11 bits. The result of that is the output of the round function. In the adjacent diagram, one line represents 32 bits.

The subkeys are chosen in a pre-specified order. The key schedule is very simple: break the 256-bit key into eight 32-bit subkeys, and each subkey is used four times in the algorithm; the first 24 rounds use the key words in order, the last 8 rounds use them in reverse order.

The S-boxes accept a four-bit input and produce a four-bit output. The S-box substitution in the round function consists of eight 4 × 4 S-boxes. The S-boxes are implementation-dependent, thus parties that want to secure their communications using GOST must be using the same S-boxes. For extra security, the S-boxes can be kept secret. In the original standard where GOST was specified, no S-boxes were given, but they were to be supplied somehow. This led to speculation that organizations the government wished to spy on were given weak S-boxes. One GOST chip manufacturer reported that he generated S-boxes himself using a pseudorandom number generator.

For example, the Central Bank of Russian Federation used the following S-boxes: 

However, the most recent revision of the standard, GOST R 34.12-2015, adds the missing S-box specification and defines it as follows.

==Cryptanalysis of GOST==

The latest cryptanalysis of GOST shows that it is secure in a theoretical sense. In practice, the data and memory complexity of the best published attacks has reached the level of practical, while the time complexity of even the best attack is still 2192 when 264 data is available.

Since 2007, several attacks have been developed against reduced-round GOST implementations and/or weak keys.

In 2011 several authors discovered more significant flaws in GOST, being able to attack the full 32-round GOST with arbitrary keys for the first time. It has even been called &quot;a deeply flawed cipher&quot; by Nicolas Courtois. Initial attacks were able to reduce time complexity from 2256 to 2228 at the cost of huge memory requirements, and soon they were improved up to 2178 time complexity (at the cost of 270 memory and 264 data).

In December 2012, Courtois, Gawinecki, and Song improved attacks on GOST by computing only 2101 GOST rounds. Isobe had already published a single key attack on the full GOST cipher, which Dinur, Dunkelman, and Shamir improved upon, reaching 2224 time complexity for 232 data and 236 memory, and 2192 time complexity for 264 data.

Since the attacks reduce the expected strength from 2256 (key length) to around 2178, the cipher can be considered broken. However, this attack is not feasible in practice, as the number of tests to be performed 2178 is out of reach.

Note that for any block cipher with block size of n bits, the maximum amount of plaintext that can be encrypted before rekeying must take place is 2n/2 blocks, due to the birthday paradox, and none of the aforementioned attacks require less than 232 data.

==GOST 2-128==
GOST 2-128 was released in 2016. It has exactly the same design but has twice as many S-tables and uses 64-bit integers instead of 32-bit integers. It no longer works on 64-bit blocks but on 128-bit blocks like AES.
The two S-tables are those of the Central Bank of Russian Federation and that of the GOST R 34.12-2015 standard.
GOST had 256-bit keys that were reused as subkeys. In GOST 2-128, subkeys are generated by a one-way hash function, representing 4096 bits. Thus, no weak keys exist and attacks against GOST do not work in GOST 2-128.

<doc id="487473" wikidata="Q235639" url="?curid=487473" title="Billie Burke">
<text>Mary William Ethelbert Appleton &quot;Billie&quot; Burke (August 7, 1884 – May 14, 1970) was an American actress who was famous on Broadway and radio, and in silent and sound films. She is best known to modern audiences as Glinda the Good Witch of the North in the MGM film musical &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939)

Burke was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Emily Kilbourne in &quot;Merrily We Live&quot; (1938). She had appearances in the &quot;Topper&quot; film series.

She was married to Broadway producer and impresario Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. from 1914 until his death in 1932.

==Early life==
Burke was born in Washington, D.C., the daughter of Blanche (née Beatty) and her second husband, William &quot;Billy&quot; Ethelbert Burke. She toured the United States and Europe with her father, a singer and clown who worked for the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. Her family settled in London where she attended plays in the West End. She began acting on stage in 1903, making her debut in London in &quot;The School Girl&quot;. Her other London shows included &quot;The Duchess of Dantzic&quot; (1903) and &quot;The Blue Moon&quot; (1904). She eventually returned to America to star in Broadway musical comedies.

==Career==

Burke went on to play leads on Broadway in &quot;Mrs. Dot&quot;, &quot;Suzanne&quot;, &quot;The Runaway&quot;, &quot;The &quot;Mind the Paint&quot; Girl&quot;, and &quot;The Land of Promise&quot; from 1910 to 1913, along with a supporting role in the revival of Sir Arthur Wing Pinero&#x27;s &quot;The Amazons&quot;. There she met producer Florenz Ziegfeld, marrying him in 1914. Two years later they had a daughter, author Patricia Ziegfeld Stephenson (1916–2008).

Burke was signed for the movies and made her cinematic debut in the title role of &quot;Peggy&quot; (1915). Her success was phenomenal, and she was soon earning what was reputedly the highest salary of any film actress up to that time. She followed her first feature with the 15-part serial &quot;Gloria&#x27;s Romance&quot; (1916). By 1917, she was a favorite with silent-movie fans, rivaling Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish, Clara Kimball Young and Irene Castle. She starred primarily in provocative society dramas and comedies, similar in theme to &quot;The &quot;Mind-the-Paint&quot; Girl&quot;, her most successful American play. Her girlish charm rivaled her acting ability, and as she dressed to the hilt in fashionable gowns, furs and jewelry, her clothes sense also won her the devotion of female audiences. Among the films in which she appeared during this period were &quot;Arms and the Girl&quot; (1917), &quot;The Mysterious Miss Terry&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get a Divorce&quot; (1918), &quot;Good Gracious, Annabelle&quot; (1919), &quot;Away Goes Prudence&quot; (1920) and &quot;The Frisky Mrs. Johnson&quot; (1920). As a nod to himself for his wife appearing for Zukor and Lasky, Ziegfeld insisted on promotions for each of the films to carry the tag &quot;By Special Arrangement with Florenz Ziegfeld&quot;. 

Burke&#x27;s beauty and taste made her a major trendsetter throughout the 1910s and 20s. As early as 1909, following her Broadway performance in &quot;My Wife&quot; (1909), department stores began carrying the &quot;Billie Burke Dress&quot; with a signature flat collar and lace trim. During this time, much of Burke&#x27;s on- and off-screen wardrobe was provided by the leading European couturier Lucile (in private life, Lady Duff Gordon), whose New York branch was the fashion Mecca of socialites and entertainment celebrities. Burke reflected on her reputation as &quot;a new kind of actress, carefree, and red-headed, and I had beautiful clothes.&quot;

In 1917, Burke endorsed &quot;Pond’s Vanishing Cream&quot;.

Despite her success in film, Burke eventually returned to the stage, appearing in &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1919), &quot;The Intimate Strangers&quot; (1921), &quot;The Marquise&quot; (1927) and &quot;The Happy Husband&quot; (1928).

When the family&#x27;s investments were wiped out in the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Burke and her husband moved to the west coast so that Burke could resume screen acting to aid their debt.

Burke made her Hollywood comeback in 1932, when she starred as Margaret Fairfield in &quot;A Bill of Divorcement&quot;, which was directed by George Cukor. She played Katharine Hepburn&#x27;s mother in the film, which was Hepburn&#x27;s debut. Despite the death of her husband Florenz Ziegfeld during the film&#x27;s production, she resumed acting shortly after his funeral.

In 1933, Burke was cast as Millicent Jordan, a scatterbrained high-society woman hosting a dinner party in the comedy &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot;, directed by George Cukor, co-starring with Lionel Barrymore, Marie Dressler, John Barrymore, Jean Harlow and Wallace Beery. The movie was a great success and revitalized her career. She subsequently starred in many comedies and musicals, typecast as a ditzy, feather-brained upper-class matron, with her high-pitched voice.

In 1936, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer filmed a biopic of Florenz Ziegfeld (&quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;), a film that won Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actress (Luise Rainer as Ziegfeld&#x27;s common-law wife, Anna Held). William Powell played Ziegfeld and Myrna Loy played Burke; this infuriated Burke, who was under contract to the studio and believed she could have played herself. MGM, however, considered her too old to cast in the part of her younger self.

Burke appeared in &quot;Topper&quot; (1937) in which she played the twittering and puritanical Clara Topper, who is married to a man haunted by socialite ghosts played by Cary Grant and Constance Bennett. She returned to the role in the film&#x27;s sequels. Her next performance as Emily Kilbourne in &quot;Merrily We Live&quot; (1938) resulted in her only Oscar nomination. In 1938, she was chosen to play Glinda the Good Witch of the North in the musical &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939), directed by Victor Fleming, starring Judy Garland. She had previously worked with Garland in the film &quot;Everybody Sing&quot;, in which she played Judy&#x27;s histrionically hysterical actress-mother. Director George Cukor offered her the role of Aunt Pittypat in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), but she declined it. The role went to Laura Hope Crews, in a performance that Cukor wanted to be played in a &quot;Billie Burke-ish manner&quot; with &quot;the same zany feeling&quot;. Another successful film series followed with &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (1950) and &quot;Father&#x27;s Little Dividend&quot; (1951), both directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring Spencer Tracy, Joan Bennett, and Elizabeth Taylor. Burke also portrayed Mrs. Ernest (Daisy) Stanley in the 1942 film &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot;.

Burke wrote two autobiographies, both with Cameron Shipp, &quot;With a Feather on My Nose&quot; (Appleton 1949) and &quot;With Powder on My Nose&quot; (Coward McCann, 1959).

===Radio and television===

On CBS Radio, &quot;The Billie Burke Show&quot; was heard on Saturday mornings from April 3, 1943, until September 21, 1946. Sponsored by Listerine, this situation comedy was initially titled &quot;Fashions in Rations&quot; during its first year. Portraying herself as a featherbrained Good Samaritan who lived &quot;in the little white house on Sunnyview Lane,&quot; she always offered a helping hand to those in her neighborhood. She worked often in early television, appearing in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Doc Corkle&quot; (1952). She was a guest star on several TV and radio series, including &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;.

On television, Burke starred in her own talk show, &quot;At Home with Billie Burke&quot;, which ran on the DuMont Television Network from June 1951 through the spring of 1952. She was one of the first female talk show hosts, after the hostesses of the earlier DuMont series &quot;And Everything Nice&quot; (1949–50) and &quot;Fashions on Parade&quot; (1948–49) which both include talk show segments.

Billie Burke starred in an adaptation of &quot;Dr. Heidegger&#x27;s Experiment&quot; on the TV version of &quot;Lights Out&quot; on November 20, 1950.

===Return to stage and final film===
Burke tried to make a comeback on the New York stage. She starred in two short-lived productions: &quot;This Rock&quot; and &quot;Mrs. January and Mr. X&quot;. Although she got good reviews, the plays did not. She also appeared in several plays in California, although her mind became clouded, and she had trouble remembering lines. In the late 1950s, her failing memory led to her retirement from show business, although her explanation at the time was, &quot;Acting just wasn&#x27;t any fun anymore.&quot;

Burke made her final screen appearance in &quot;Sergeant Rutledge&quot; (1960), a Western film directed by John Ford.

==Personal life==

Among Burke&#x27;s early suitors was the operatic tenor Enrico Caruso. 

In 1910, Burke bought the Kirkham estate on Broadway in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, and renamed the mansion, &quot;Burkeley Crest&quot;.

In April 1914, Burke married Florenz Ziegfeld. In 1916, Burke had a daughter, Patricia Burke Ziegfeld. 

In 1921, Burke retired to raise her daughter Patricia, but resumed work after the Wall Street Crash of 1929.

In 1932, Burke moved from New York to Beverly Hills, California, after the death of Ziegfeld.

Burke died in Los Angeles of natural causes on May 14, 1970, at the age of 85, and she was interred beside Ziegfeld at Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, Westchester County, New York. 

==Legacy==
For many years, Burke&#x27;s framed photo was displayed above the exit staircase at New York City&#x27;s Ziegfeld Theatre, but it disappeared after renovations. An opening-night program bearing a picture of her from her 1912 triumph &quot;The Mind the Paint Girl&quot; (Sir Arthur Wing Pinero) is displayed in the lobby of the Lyceum Theatre in Manhattan.

For her contributions to the film industry, Burke was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 with a motion pictures star at 6617 Hollywood Boulevard.

The Academy Film Archive houses the Florenz Ziegfeld-Billie Burke Collection, which consists primarily of home movies.

On November 4, 2015, the crater Burke, near the north pole of the planet Mercury, was named after Billie Burke.

Burke is referenced in the horror film &quot;The Exorcist III&quot; (1990). The character Kinderman says, &quot;I have hobbies. In the meantime, we have cancer and mongoloid babies and murderers, monsters prowling the planet, even prowling this neighborhood, Father... right now, while our children suffer... and our loved ones die, and your God goes waltzing blithely through the universe like some kind of cosmic Billie Burke.&quot;

<text>The 16th (Irish) Division was an infantry division of the British Army, raised for service during World War I. The division was a voluntary &#x27;Service&#x27; formation of Lord Kitchener&#x27;s New Armies, created in Ireland from the &#x27;National Volunteers&#x27;, initially in September 1914, after the outbreak of the Great War. In December 1915, the division moved to France, joining the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), under the command of Irish Major General William Hickie, and spent the duration of the war in action on the Western Front. Following enormous losses at the Somme, Passchendaele and Ypres, the 16th (Irish) Division required a substantial refit in England between June and August 1918, which involved the introduction of many non-Irish battalions.

==History==
Moved by the fate of Belgium, a small and Catholic country, John Redmond had called on Irishmen to enlist &quot;in defence of the highest principles of religion and morality and right&quot;. More Catholic Irish enlisted than Protestants.

The 16th Division began forming as part of the K2 Army Group towards the end of 1914 after Irish recruits in the early days of the war from England and Belfast first filled the ranks of the 10th (Irish) Division before being assigned to the 16th Division, formed around a core of National Volunteers. Initial training began in Ireland at Fermoy, Munster; recruits also trained at Buttevant. The division moved to Aldershot in Hampshire, England for more intensive training in September 1915. After thirteen weeks, the division was deployed to Étaples in France, joining the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), then commanded by Field Marshal Sir John French, but later replaced by General Sir Douglas Haig. From there the division left on 18 December for that part of the front in the Loos salient, under the command of Irish Major General William Hickie, who had distinguished himself earlier in the war as a staff officer and brigade commander, and spent the rest of the war on the Western Front.

Until March 1916 the 16th Division was part of IV Corps, commanded by the staunch unionist, Lieutenant General Sir Henry Wilson. Wilson, who had called the division &quot;Johnnie Redmond&#x27;s pets&quot;, inspected them over the course of a few days over Christmas 1915, noting that they &quot;appear to be inferior&quot; and that &quot;at least 50p.c. are quite useless, old whiskey-sodden militiamen&quot;. Hickie agreed that he had &quot;a political Divn of riff raff Redmondites&quot;. Wilson thought the 47th Brigade had &quot;old officers, old &amp; useless men, &quot;very&quot; bad musketry, rotten boots, and altogether a very poor show&quot;. Wilson reported to his superior, General Sir Charles Monro (6 January) that the division, despite having been training since September–October 1914, would not be fit to serve in an active part of the line for six weeks. Although–in the opinion of Wilson&#x27;s biographer Keith Jeffery–political prejudice probably played a part in these views, Wilson also attributed much of the difference in quality between his divisions to training, especially of officers, in which he took a keen personal interest, opposing Haig&#x27;s wish to delegate training from corps to division level. Hickie was–in public–much more diplomatic and tactful and spoke of the pride which his new command gave him.

At Loos, in January and February 1916, the division was introduced to trench warfare and suffered greatly in the Battle of Hulluch. Personnel raided German trenches all through May and June. In late July they were moved to the Somme Valley where they were intensively engaged in the Battle of the Somme. Lieutenant General Hubert Gough, the British Fifth Army commander, had asked, at the end of 1915, for the division to be placed under his command, and had established the first corps school for the training of young officers. The 16th Division played an important part in capturing the towns of Guillemont and Ginchy, although they suffered massive casualties. During these successful actions between 1 and 10 September casualties amounted to 224 officers and 4,090 men; despite these very heavy losses the division gained a reputation as first-class shock troops. Out of a total of 10,845 men, it had lost 3,491 on the Loos sector between January and the end of May 1916, including heavy casualties from bombardment and a gas attack at Hullach in April. Bloodletting of this order was fatal to the division&#x27;s character, for it had to be made good by drafts from England.

In early 1917, the division took a major part in the Battle of Messines alongside the 36th (Ulster) Division, adding to both their recognition and reputation. Their major actions ended in the summer of 1917 at the Battle of Passchendaele after, again, coming under the command of Gough and the Fifth Army. In July 1917, during the Third Battle of Ypres, although both divisions were completely exhausted after 13 days of moving weighty equipment under heavy shelling, Gough ordered the battalions to advance through deep mud towards well fortified German positions left untouched by totally inadequate artillery preparation. By mid August, the 16th had suffered over 4,200 casualties, the 36th almost 3,600, or more than 50% of their numbers. Haig, now a field marshal, was very critical of Gough for &quot;playing the Irish card&quot;.

The 16th Division held an exposed position from early 1918 at Ronssoy where they suffered more heavy losses during the German Army&#x27;s Spring Offensive in March and being practically wiped out in the retreat which followed Operation Michael. Haig wrote in his diary (22 March 1918) that the division was &quot;said not to be so full of fight as the others. In fact, certain Irish units did very badly and gave way immediately the enemy showed&quot;. In fact the division&#x27;s casualties were the highest of any BEF division at this time, and records of the German 18th and 50th Reserve Divisions show that the Irish fought hard. The corps commander, Lieutenant General Walter Congreve, wrote &quot;the real truth is that their reserve brigade did not fight at all and their right brigade very indifferently&quot;. One battalion was greeted at the rear with cries of &quot;There go the Sinn Feiners!&quot; A report by Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, now the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), concluded that there was no evidence that the men had not fought well, but pointed out that only two-thirds of the men were of Irish birth. The matter affected the debate over the introduction of conscription of Ireland.

The remnants of the division were later transferred to XIX Corps of the Third Army. The 16th helped to finally halt the German attack prior to the Battle of Hamel. The decision was then made to break up the division, the three surviving Service battalions were posted to other formations.

On 14 June the division returned to England for reconstitution. The Conscription Crisis of 1918 in Ireland meant that fewer Irish recruits could be raised so that the 16th Division which returned to France on 27 July contained five English battalions, two Scottish battalions and one Welsh battalion. The only original battalion left was the 5th Royal Irish Fusiliers.

The dispersion of the Irish battalions throughout the BEF in 1918, despite its practical considerations, appears to suggest that the Irish units were increasingly distrusted by the military authorities.

<text>Oakes Ames (January 10, 1804 – May 8, 1873) was an American businessman, investor, and politician. He was a member of the United States House of Representatives from Massachusetts. As a congressman, he is credited by many historians as being the single most important influence in the building of the Union Pacific portion of the transcontinental railroad. He is also noted for the subsequent scandal that alleged the improper sale of stock of the railroad&#x27;s construction company.

==Biography==
Ames was born in Easton, Massachusetts, the son of Susanna (Angier) Ames and Oliver Ames Sr., a blacksmith who had built a business of making shovels, the Ames Shovel Shop, and became nicknamed &quot;King of Spades&quot;. In his youth, he obtained a public school education and later worked in the family workshops to learn each step of the manufacturing process. He eventually became a partner in the business, and with his brother Oliver Ames Jr. he established the firm Oliver Ames &amp; Sons. Driven by the settlement of the Midwest, by the discovery of gold in California and Australia, as well as by railroad construction, the shovel manufacturing business boomed. During the Civil War, the firm prospered with contracts for swords, shovels, and other tools and implements. Ames made a large fortune.

He was influential in the establishment of the Republican Party in Massachusetts. In 1860, he became a member of the executive council of Massachusetts, and from 1863 to 1873 he served in Congress as a U.S. Representative for the Second District of Massachusetts. While there, he became a member of the Committee on Railroads during the early building of the transcontinental railroad. In 1865, President Abraham Lincoln appealed to him to take control of the Union Pacific (UP) portion of the project, which had become mired down because of the war, and had built only of track.

Through his influence he obtained contracts for his family firm in the construction of the Union Pacific and staked nearly all the family&#x27;s holdings as capitalization for the project. The contracts were later transferred to the Credit Mobilier Company of America after Ames ousted its founder Thomas Durant. His brother Oliver was appointed president of the UP in 1866. The railroad was completed in 1869.

In 1872, it was disclosed Ames sold shares in Credit Mobilier to fellow congressmen at a price greatly below the market value of the stock. The subsequent public scandal led to a House investigation, which formally recommended expulsion. On February 28, 1873, the House passed a resolution formally censuring Ames &quot;in seeking to secure congressional attention to the affairs of a corporation in which he was interested, and whose interest directly depended upon the legislation of Congress, by inducing members of Congress to invest in the stocks of said corporation.&quot; Detractors referred to him as &quot;Hoax Ames&quot;. Ames died soon afterward at North Easton, Massachusetts, May 5, 1873, due to a stroke.

On May 10, 1883, the 14th anniversary of the completion of the railroad, the state legislature of Massachusetts passed a resolution exonerating Ames. His son Oliver Ames served as Governor from 1887 to 1890.

==Honors==

The contributions of Ames and his brother Oliver in the building of the Union Pacific are commemorated in the Oliver and Oakes Ames Monument at Sherman Summit, near Laramie, Wyoming, along the original route. The pyramidal monument was designed by famous architect Henry Hobson Richardson (who designed a number of projects for the Ames family) with sculpted plaques of the Ames brothers by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. At the time of its construction, the monument was located at the highest point attained by the UP&#x27;s transcontinental route. With a change in the route of the railroad, the monument today is not on any major transportation route.

The city of Ames, Iowa is named for Oakes, as is likely the community of Ames, Nebraska, and Ames Avenue in Omaha.

<doc id="487486" wikidata="Q2563691" url="?curid=487486" title="The Mystery of the Yellow Room">
<text>The Mystery of the Yellow Room (in French &quot;Le mystère de la chambre jaune&quot;) is a mystery novel written by French author Gaston Leroux. One of the first locked-room mystery novels, it was first published serially in France in the periodical &quot;L&#x27;Illustration&quot; from September 1907 to November 1907, then in its own right in 1908.

It is the first novel starring fictional reporter Joseph Rouletabille and concerns a complex, and seemingly impossible, crime in which the criminal appears to disappear from a locked room. Leroux provides the reader with detailed, precise diagrams and floorplans illustrating the crime scene. The story provides an intellectual challenge to the reader.

The novel finds its continuation in the 1908 novel &quot;The Perfume of the Lady in Black&quot;, wherein a number of the characters familiar from this story reappear.

==Plot Summary==
Reporter and amateur sleuth Joseph Rouletabille is sent to investigate a criminal case at the Château du Glandier and takes along his friend the lawyer Sainclair, who narrates. Mathilde Stangerson, the 30-something daughter of the castle&#x27;s owner, Professor Joseph Stangerson, was found near-critically battered in a room adjacent to his laboratory on the castle grounds, with the door still locked from the inside. She recovers slowly but can give no useful testimony. Rouletabille meets and interrogates several characters: the castle&#x27;s concierges Mr &amp; Mrs Bernier, the old servant Jacques, an unfriendly inn landlord and a womanising gamekeeper, and begins a friendly rivalry with France&#x27;s top police detective Frédéric Larsan, who has been assigned the case. Larsan suspects Ms Stangerson&#x27;s fiancé, another scientist called Robert Darzac, to Rouletabille&#x27;s dismay.

More attempts are made on Ms Stangerson&#x27;s life despite Rouletabille and Larsan&#x27;s protection, and the perpetrator appears to vanish on two occasions when they are closing in on him, echoing Professor Stangerson&#x27;s research into &quot;matter dissociation&quot;. The gamekeeper is murdered during the second attempt. Ultimately, Larsan arrests Darzac who is charged with murder attempts. Rouletabille suspects that Darzac has secret reasons not to defend himself and he disappears to make further investigations.

Two-and-a-half months later, as Darzac&#x27;s trial opens, Rouletabille reappears sensationally and tells the court that the culprit is Frédéric Larsan himself, whom he accuses of being an alter-ego of a master criminal called Ballmeyer. Larsan appeared to vanish on the two occasions he was nearly collared as he was one of the pursuers. Darzac is released when it emerges that Larsan has vanished after Rouletabille warned him he would accuse him in court. The mystery of the locked Yellow Room is explained thus: Larsan assaulted Ms Stangerson earlier in the day than originally thought, but she hid the traces of the attack and locked herself away. During the night, traumatised by the event, she fell off her bed and inflicted the gravest of the wounds by hitting her temple on the corner of her bed-side table.

The background to these events is kept secret in court but finally explained by Sainclair. Ballmeyer, in a different guise, had seduced Ms Stangerson in her youth and married her secretly in the United States. They had a child before he was arrested and his identity revealed to her. Ms Stangerson had arranged for her son&#x27;s care and education and hidden the whole saga from her father; her silence and Robert Darzac&#x27;s behaviour were motivated by her desperation to keep him from finding out. Ballmeyer however, hearing that she was engaged, had decided to reappear in her life and claim her as his wife once more, by force if necessary.

==Reception==
John Dickson Carr, a writer of locked-room mysteries, has his detective Dr. Gideon Fell declare this the &quot;best detective tale ever written&quot;, in his novel &quot;The Hollow Man&quot; (1935).

Agatha Christie praised &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room&quot; through the mouthpiece of her detective Hercule Poirot in her 1963 novel &quot;The Clocks&quot;:

And here is &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room&quot;. That - ah, that is really a &quot;classic&quot;! I approve of it from start to finish. Such a logical approach! There were criticisms of it, I remember, which said it was unfair. But it is not unfair, my dear Colin. No, no. Very nearly so, perhaps, but no not quite. There is the hair&#x27;s breadth of difference. No. All through there is truth, concealed with a careful and cunning use of words. Everything should be clear at that supreme moment when the men meet at the angle of the three corridors.&quot; He laid it down reverently. &quot;Definitely a masterpiece, and, I gather, almost forgotten nowadays.

In a 1981 poll by Edward D. Hoch of 17 mystery writers and reviewers, this novel was voted the third-best locked-room mystery of all time, behind Hake Talbot&#x27;s &quot;Rim of the Pit&quot; (1944) and John Dickson Carr&#x27;s &quot;The Hollow Man&quot; (1935).

The popular 1946 Japanese detective novel &quot;The Honjin Murders&quot; (本陣殺人事件, Honjin satsujin jiken) by Seishi Yokomizo refers to &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room&quot; numerous times, the narrator quipping that Leroux&#x27;s novel &quot;bears the closest resemblance&quot; to the story recounted in the novel.

<doc id="487493" wikidata="Q202224" url="?curid=487493" title="Group 8 element">
<text>Group 8 is a group (column) of chemical elements in the periodic table. It consists of iron (Fe), ruthenium (Ru), osmium (Os) and hassium (Hs). &quot;Group 8&quot; is the modern standard designation for this group, adopted by the IUPAC in 1990. It should not be confused with &quot;group VIIIA&quot; in the CAS system, which is group 18 (current IUPAC), the noble gases. In the older group naming systems, this group was combined with groups 9 and 10 and called group &quot;VIIIB&quot; in the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) &quot;U.S. system&quot;, or &quot;VIII&quot; in the old IUPAC (pre-1990) &quot;European system&quot; (and in Mendeleev&#x27;s original table). The elements in this group are all transition metals that lie in the d-block of the periodic table.

While groups (columns) of the periodic table are usually named after their lightest member (as in &quot;the oxygen group&quot; for group 16), iron group has historically been used differently; most often, it means a set of adjacent elements on period (row) 4 of the table that includes iron, such as chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, and nickel, or only the last three, or some other set, depending on the context.

Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in electron configuration, especially in the outermost shells, resulting in trends in chemical behavior.

==Basic properties==
The following is copied from the pages of Iron, Ruthenium, Osmium, and Hassium respectively.

Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are a mirror-like silvery-gray. Iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to produce brown-to-black hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. Unlike the oxides of some other metals that form passivating layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing more fresh surfaces for corrosion. High-purity irons (e.g. electrolytic iron) are more resistant to corrosion.

Because it hardens platinum and palladium alloys, ruthenium is used in electrical contacts, where a thin film is sufficient to achieve the desired durability. With its similar properties to and lower cost than rhodium, electric contacts are a major use of ruthenium. The ruthenium plate is applied to the electrical contact and electrode base metal by electroplating or sputtering.

Osmium is a hard but brittle metal that remains lustrous even at high temperatures. It has a very low compressibility. Correspondingly, its bulk modulus is extremely high, reported between 395 and 462 GPa, which rivals that of diamond (443 GPa). The hardness of osmium is moderately high at 4 GPa. Because of its hardness, brittleness, low vapor pressure (the lowest of the platinum-group metals), and very high melting point (the fourth highest of all elements, after carbon, tungsten, and rhenium), solid osmium is difficult to machine, form, or work.

Very few properties of hassium or its compounds have been measured; this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that hassium (and its parents) decays very quickly. A few singular chemistry-related properties have been measured, such as enthalpy of adsorption of hassium tetroxide, but properties of hassium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available. Though despite its radioactivity, chemists have formed hassium tetroxide and sodium hassate(VII) through various means.

== Occurrence and production ==
In terms of mass, iron is the fourth most common element within the Earth&#x27;s crust. It is found in many minerals, such as hematite, magnetite, and taconite. Iron is commercially produced by heating these minerals in a blast furnace with coke and calcium carbonate.

Ruthenium is a very rare metal in Earth&#x27;s crust. It is often found in minerals such as pentlandite and pyroxinite. It can be commercially obtained as a waste product from refining nickel.

Osmium is found in osmiridium. It can also be obtained as a waste product from refining nickel.

Hassium is extremely radioactive, and as such is not found naturally in the Earth&#x27;s crust. It is produced via the bombardment of lead-208 atoms with iron-58 atoms.

== Biological role ==
Iron is a mineral used in the human body that is essential for good health. It is a component in the proteins of hemoglobin and myoglobin, both of which are responsible for transporting oxygen around the body. Iron is a part of some hormones as well. A lack of iron in the body can cause iron deficiency anemia, and an excess of iron in the body can be toxic.

Some ruthenium-containing molecules may be used to fight cancer. Normally, however, ruthenium plays no role in the human body.

Both osmium and hassium have no known biological roles.

<doc id="487497" wikidata="Q208107" url="?curid=487497" title="Group 9 element">
<text>Group 9, by modern IUPAC numbering, is a group (column) of chemical elements in the d-block of the periodic table. Members of Group 9 include cobalt (Co), rhodium (Rh), iridium (Ir) and meitnerium (Mt). These elements are among the rarest of the transition metals.

Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in electron configuration, especially in the outermost shells, resulting in trends in chemical behavior; however, rhodium deviates from the pattern.

==History==
&quot;Group 9&quot; is the modern standard designation for this group, adopted by the IUPAC in 1990. In the older group naming systems, this group was combined with group 8 (iron, ruthenium, osmium, and hassium) and group 10 (nickel, palladium, platinum, and darmstadtium) and called group &quot;VIIIB&quot; in the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) &quot;U.S. system&quot;, or &quot;VIII&quot; in the old IUPAC (pre-1990) &quot;European system&quot; (and in Mendeleev&#x27;s original table).

===Cobalt===
Cobalt compounds have been used for centuries to impart a rich blue color to glass, glazes, and ceramics. Cobalt has been detected in Egyptian sculpture, Persian jewelry from the third millennium BC, in the ruins of Pompeii, destroyed in 79 AD, and in China, dating from the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD) and the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 AD).

Swedish chemist Georg Brandt (1694–1768) is credited with discovering cobalt c. 1735, showing it to be a previously unknown element, distinct from bismuth and other traditional metals. Brandt called it a new &quot;semi-metal&quot;. He showed that compounds of cobalt metal were the source of the blue color in glass, which previously had been attributed to the bismuth found with cobalt. Cobalt became the first metal to be discovered since the pre-historical period. All other known metals (iron, copper, silver, gold, zinc, mercury, tin, lead and bismuth) had no recorded discoverers.

===Rhodium===
Rhodium was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston, soon after he discovered palladium. He used crude platinum ore presumably obtained from South America. His procedure dissolved the ore in aqua regia and neutralized the acid with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). He then precipitated the platinum as ammonium chloroplatinate by adding ammonium chloride (). Most other metals like copper, lead, palladium, and rhodium were precipitated with zinc. Diluted nitric acid dissolved all but palladium and rhodium. Of these, palladium dissolved in aqua regia but rhodium did not, and the rhodium was precipitated by the addition of sodium chloride as . After being washed with ethanol, the rose-red precipitate was reacted with zinc, which displaced the rhodium in the ionic compound and thereby released the rhodium as free metal.

===Iridium===
Chemists who studied platinum dissolved it in aqua regia (a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids) to create soluble salts. They always observed a small amount of a dark, insoluble residue. In 1803, British scientist Smithson Tennant (1761–1815) analyzed the insoluble residue and concluded that it must contain a new metal. Vauquelin treated the powder alternately with alkali and acids and obtained a volatile new oxide, which he believed to be of this new metal—which he named &quot;ptene&quot;, from the Greek word &quot;ptēnós&quot;, &quot;winged&quot;. Tennant, who had the advantage of a much greater amount of residue, continued his research and identified the two previously undiscovered elements in the black residue, iridium and osmium. He obtained dark red crystals (probably of ]·&quot;n&quot;) by a sequence of reactions with sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid. He named iridium after Iris (), the Greek winged goddess of the rainbow and the messenger of the Olympian gods, because many of the salts he obtained were strongly colored. Discovery of the new elements was documented in a letter to the Royal Society on June 21, 1804.

===Meitnerium===
Meitnerium was first synthesized on August 29, 1982, by a German research team led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research (Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung) in Darmstadt. The team bombarded a target of bismuth-209 with accelerated nuclei of iron-58 and detected a single atom of the isotope meitnerium-266:

This work was confirmed three years later at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna (then in the Soviet Union).

==Properties==

[*] Predicted.

The first three elements are hard silvery-white metals:

* Cobalt is a metallic element that can be used to turn glass a deep blue color. Cobalt is primarily used in lithium-ion batteries, and in the manufacture of magnetic, wear-resistant and high-strength alloys. The compounds cobalt silicate and cobalt(II) aluminate (CoAl2O4, cobalt blue) give a distinctive deep blue color to glass, ceramics, inks, paints and varnishes. Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable isotope, cobalt-59. Cobalt-60 is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a radioactive tracer and for the production of high-energy gamma rays. Cobalt is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst when refining crude oil. This is to clean it of its sulfur content, which is very polluting when burned and causes acid rain.
* Rhodium can be used in jewelry as a shiny metal. Rhodium is a hard, silvery, durable metal that has a high reflectance. Rhodium metal does not normally form an oxide, even when heated. Oxygen is absorbed from the atmosphere only at the melting point of rhodium but is released on solidification. Rhodium has both a higher melting point and lower density than platinum. It is not attacked by most acids as it is completely insoluble in nitric acid and dissolves slightly in aqua regia.
* Iridium is mainly used as a hardening agent for platinum alloys. Iridium is the most corrosion-resistant metal known as it is not attacked by acids, including aqua regia. In the presence of oxygen, it reacts with cyanide salts. Traditional oxidants also react, including the halogens and oxygen at higher temperatures. Iridium also reacts directly with sulfur at atmospheric pressure to yield iridium disulfide.

All known isotopes of meitnerium are radioactive with short half-lives. Only minute quantities have been synthesized in laboratories. It has not been isolated in pure form, and its physical and chemical properties have not been determined yet. Based on what is known, meitnerium is considered a homologue to iridium.

==Biological role==

Of the group 9 elements, only cobalt has a biological role. It is a key constituent of cobalamin, also known as vitamin B, the primary biological reservoir of cobalt as an ultratrace element. Bacteria in the stomachs of ruminant animals convert cobalt salts into vitamin B, a compound which can only be produced by bacteria or archaea. A minimal presence of cobalt in soils therefore markedly improves the health of grazing animals, and an uptake of 0.20 mg/kg a day is recommended, because they have no other source of vitamin B.

Proteins based on cobalamin use corrin to hold the cobalt. Coenzyme B12 features a reactive C-Co bond that participates in the reactions. In humans, B12 has two types of alkyl ligand: methyl and adenosyl. MeB12 promotes methyl (−CH3) group transfers. The adenosyl version of B12 catalyzes rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine. Methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase (MUT) converts MMl-CoA to Su-CoA, an important step in the extraction of energy from proteins and fats.

<doc id="487500" wikidata="Q2527546" url="?curid=487500" title="Gideon Fell">
<text>Dr. Gideon Fell is a fictional character created by John Dickson Carr. He is the protagonist of 23 mystery novels from 1933 through 1967, as well as a few short stories. Carr was an American who lived most of his adult life in England; Dr. Fell is an Englishman who lives in the London suburbs.

Dr. Fell is supposedly based upon G. K. Chesterton (author of the Father Brown stories), whose physical appearance and personality were similar to those of Doctor Fell.

==Biography==

Dr. Fell is a corpulent man with a moustache who wears a cape and a shovel hat and walks with the aid of two canes. His age is not specified; in his first appearance, in a 1933 novel, he is said to be &quot;not too old&quot; but with a kind of ancient quality about him. He is frequently described as bringing the spirit of Father Christmas or Old King Cole into a room. In his early appearances he was portrayed as a lexicographer, but this description gradually disappeared and he was thereafter mostly referred to as working on a monumental history of the beer-drinking habits of the English people.

He is an amateur sleuth, frequently called upon by the police, whom he frustrates in the usual manner of fictional detectives by refusing to reveal his deductions until he has arrived at a complete solution to the problem. The most frequently recurring police character is Superintendent Hadley. Most of Fell&#x27;s exploits concern the unravelling of locked room mysteries or of &quot;impossible crimes&quot;. When he himself becomes frustrated, he is likely to cry out, &quot;Archons of Athens!&quot;

When Dr. Fell is not traveling, he lives with his wife in a somewhat cluttered house. The wife&#x27;s name is never given, and little of her character is revealed, except that she is rather eccentric as well. She goes unmentioned in many of the books, but an allusion to her late in the series indicates that the couple&#x27;s domestic life is unchanged. The Fells have no children.

Chapter 17 of the novel &quot;The Three Coffins&quot; contains Dr. Fell&#x27;s &quot;locked room lecture&quot;, in which he delineates many of the methods by which apparently locked-room or impossible-crime murders might be committed. In the course of his discourse, he states, off-handedly, that he and his listeners are, of course, characters in a book.

==Adaptations==
===Television===
&quot;The Seat of the Scornful&quot; was adapted as a 1956 episode of the BBC Sunday Night Theatre. Fell was portrayed by Finlay Currie.

===Radio===
Fell appeared in several original BBC radio dramas written by Carr. The first was a three-part serial, &quot;Who Killed Matthew Corbin?&quot; broadcast on 7 December 1939 (part 1), 7 January 1940 (part 2) and 14 January 1940 (part 3). This was followed a month later by &quot;The Black Minute&quot; broadcast on 14 February 1940 and then &quot;The Devil in the Summerhouse&quot; broadcast on 14 October 1940. Fell returned in &quot;The Dead Sleep Lightly&quot; broadcast by the BBC on 23 August 1943. Carr&#x27;s &quot;The Clock Strikes Eight&quot; (which includes a clue recycled from &quot;Who Killed Matthew Corbin?&quot;) was broadcast on 18 May 1944, for the anthology series &quot;Appointment with Fear&quot;. Richard George played Fell.

&quot;The Hollow Man&quot; was adapted for Saturday Night Theatre, with Norman Shelley as Fell.

Donald Sinden played Dr. Fell in a series of eight BBC Radio adaptations of Carr&#x27;s novels.

<text>Tai Lam Country Park, established on 23 February 1979, is a country park located in Tai Lam, at the south of Yuen Long Town, Kam Tin and Shek Kong and east of Tuen Mun Town, in the western New Territories of Hong Kong. This country park has an area of 54 km².

==Etymology==
The country park is named after Tai Lam where the park is located nearby. A river stream also named after the area as Tai Lam Chung (). Due to the construction of a dam, the water flows into the Tai Lam Chung Reservoir. The reservoir is entirely surrounded by the country park. The reservoir is managed by the Water Supplies Department. Tai Lam Tunnel and Tai Lam railway tunnel pass through the country park underground. A village, as well as two prisons: Tai Lam Centre for Women and , all outside the boundary of the country park, are named after Tai Lam.

The &quot;tai&quot; () in Tai Lam means large. There is another area known as Siu Lam, which &quot;siu&quot; () means small in Chinese.

==Highlights==
A series of barbecue and picnic sites are provided along Route Twisk, the Shek Kong, Pat Heung catchwater and the Tuen Mun catchwater. In addition, there are a lot of trails. For example, the MacLehose Trail and the Kap Lung Forest Trail start from the top of Route Twisk near the Country Park Management Centre. The Twisk Nature Trail near the Country Park Management Centre introduces the natural environment and human impacts in the area.

The fitness trail at So Kwun Wat catchwater provides 14 sets of fitness equipment for visitors and morning walkers.

<doc id="487510" wikidata="Q191875" url="?curid=487510" title="Group 12 element">
<text>Group 12, by modern IUPAC numbering, is a group of chemical elements in the periodic table. It includes zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and copernicium (Cn). Formerly this group was named &quot;IIB&quot; (pronounced as &quot;group two B&quot;, as the &quot;II&quot; is a Roman numeral) by CAS and old IUPAC system.

The three group 12 elements that occur naturally are zinc, cadmium and mercury. They are all widely used in electric and electronic applications, as well as in various alloys. The first two members of the group share similar properties as they are solid metals under standard conditions. Mercury is the only metal that is known to be a liquid at room temperature – as copernicium&#x27;s boiling point has not yet been measured accurately enough, it is not yet known whether it is a liquid or a gas under standard conditions. While zinc is very important in the biochemistry of living organisms, cadmium and mercury are both highly toxic. As copernicium does not occur in nature, it has to be synthesized in the laboratory.

Due to their complete d-shell they are sometimes excluded from the transition metals.

==Physical and atomic properties==
Like other groups of the periodic table, the members of group 12 show patterns in its electron configuration, especially the outermost shells, which result in trends in their chemical behavior:
The group 12 elements are all soft, diamagnetic, divalent metals. They have the lowest melting points among all transition metals. Zinc is bluish-white and lustrous, though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish. Zinc is also referred to in nonscientific contexts as &quot;spelter&quot;. Cadmium is soft, malleable, ductile, and with a bluish-white color. Mercury is a liquid, heavy, silvery-white metal. It is the only common liquid metal at ordinary temperatures, and as compared to other metals, it is a poor conductor of heat, but a fair conductor of electricity.

The table below is a summary of the key physical properties of the group 12 elements. The data for copernicium is based on relativistic density-functional theory simulations.

Zinc is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure. The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between . Above , the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating. Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity. For a metal, zinc has relatively low melting () and boiling points (). Cadmium is similar in many respects to zinc but forms complex compounds. Unlike other metals, cadmium is resistant to corrosion and as a result it is used as a protective layer when deposited on other metals. As a bulk metal, cadmium is insoluble in water and is not flammable; however, in its powdered form it may burn and release toxic fumes. Mercury has an exceptionally low melting temperature for a d-block metal. A complete explanation of this fact requires a deep excursion into quantum physics, but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electronic configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d and 6s subshells. As such configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gas elements, which form weak bonds and thus easily melting solids. The stability of the 6s shell is due to the presence of a filled 4f shell. An f shell poorly screens the nuclear charge that increases the attractive Coulomb interaction of the 6s shell and the nucleus (see lanthanide contraction). The absence of a filled inner f shell is the reason for the somewhat higher melting temperature of cadmium and zinc, although both these metals still melt easily and, in addition, have unusually low boiling points. Gold has atoms with one less 6s electron than mercury. Those electrons are more easily removed and are shared between the gold atoms forming relatively strong metallic bonds.

Zinc, cadmium and mercury form a large range of alloys. Among the zinc containing ones, brass is an alloy of zinc and copper. Other metals long known to form binary alloys with zinc are aluminium, antimony, bismuth, gold, iron, lead, mercury, silver, tin, magnesium, cobalt, nickel, tellurium and sodium. While neither zinc nor zirconium are ferromagnetic, their alloy exhibits ferromagnetism below 35 K. Cadmium is used in many kinds of solder and bearing alloys, due to a low coefficient of friction and fatigue resistance. It is also found in some of the lowest-melting alloys, such as Wood&#x27;s metal. Because it is a liquid, mercury dissolves other metals and the alloys that are formed are called amalgams. For example, such amalgams are known with gold, zinc, sodium, and many other metals. Because iron is an exception, iron flasks have been traditionally used to trade mercury. Other metals that do not form amalgams with mercury include tantalum, tungsten and platinum. Sodium amalgam is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis, and is also used in high-pressure sodium lamps. Mercury readily combines with aluminium to form a mercury-aluminium amalgam when the two pure metals come into contact. Since the amalgam reacts with air to give aluminium oxide, small amounts of mercury corrode aluminium. For this reason, mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances because of the risk of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft.

==Chemistry==
Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first three members of the group 12. The chemistry of copernicium is not well established and therefore the rest of the section deals only with zinc, cadmium and mercury.

===Periodic trends===
All elements in this group are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly from top to bottom of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.

Zinc and cadmium are electropositive while mercury is not. As a result, zinc and cadmium metal are good reducing agents. The elements of group 12 have an oxidation state of +2 in which the ions have the rather stable d10 electronic configuration, with a full sub-shell. However, mercury can easily be reduced to the +1 oxidation state; usually, as in the ion , two mercury(I) ions come together to form a metal-metal bond and a diamagnetic species. Cadmium can also form species such as [Cd2Cl6]4− in which the metal&#x27;s oxidation state is +1. Just as with mercury, the formation of a metal-metal bond results in a diamagnetic compound in which there are no unpaired electrons; thus, making the species very reactive. Zinc(I) is known mostly in the gas phase, in such compounds as linear Zn2Cl2, analogous to calomel. In the solid phase, the rather exotic compound decamethyldizincocene (Cp*Zn–ZnCp*) is known.

===Classification===
The elements in group 12 are usually considered to be d-block elements, but not transition elements as the d-shell is full. Some authors classify these elements as main-group elements because the valence electrons are in ns2 orbitals. Nevertheless, they share many characteristics with the neighboring group 11 elements on the periodic table, which are almost universally considered to be transition elements. For example, zinc shares many characteristics with the neighboring transition metal, copper. Zinc complexes merit inclusion in the Irving-Williams series as zinc forms many complexes with the same stoichiometry as complexes of copper(II), albeit with smaller stability constants. There is little similarity between cadmium and silver as compounds of silver(II) are rare and those that do exist are very strong oxidizing agents. Likewise the common oxidation state for gold is +3, which precludes there being much common chemistry between mercury and gold, though there are similarities between mercury(I) and gold(I) such as the formation of linear dicyano complexes, [M(CN)2]−. According to IUPAC&#x27;s definition of transition metal as &quot;an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell&quot;, zinc and cadmium are not transition metals, while mercury is. This is because only mercury is known to have a compound where its oxidation state is higher than +2, in mercury(IV) fluoride (though its existence is disputed, as later experiments trying to confirm its synthesis could not find evidence of HgF4). However, this classification is based on one highly atypical compound seen at non-equilibrium conditions and is at odds to mercury&#x27;s more typical chemistry, and Jensen has suggested that it would be better to regard mercury as not being a transition metal.

===Relationship with the alkaline earth metals===
Although group 12 lies in the d-block of the modern 18-column periodic table, the d electrons of zinc, cadmium, and (almost always) mercury behave as core electrons and do not take part in bonding. This behavior is similar to that of the main-group elements, but is in stark contrast to that of the neighboring group 11 elements (copper, silver, and gold), which also have filled d-subshells in their ground-state electron configuration but behave chemically as transition metals. For example, the bonding in chromium(II) sulfide (CrS) involves mainly the 3d electrons; that in iron(II) sulfide (FeS) involves both the 3d and 4s electrons; but that of zinc sulfide (ZnS) involves only the 4s electrons and the 3d electrons behave as core electrons. Indeed, useful comparison can be made between their properties and the first two members of group 2, beryllium and magnesium, and in earlier short-form periodic table layouts, this relationship is illustrated more clearly. For instance, zinc and cadmium are similar to beryllium and magnesium in their atomic radii, ionic radii, electronegativities, and also in the structure of their binary compounds and their ability to form complex ions with many nitrogen and oxygen ligands, such as complex hydrides and amines. However, beryllium and magnesium are small atoms, unlike the heavier alkaline earth metals and like the group 12 elements (which have a greater nuclear charge but the same number of valence electrons), and the periodic trends down group 2 from beryllium to radium (similar to that of the alkali metals) are not as smooth when going down from beryllium to mercury (which is more similar to that of the p-block main groups) due to the d-block and lanthanide contractions. It is also the d-block and lanthanide contractions that give mercury many of its distinctive properties.
===Compounds===

All three metal ions form many tetrahedral species, such as . Both zinc and cadmium can also form octahedral complexes such as the aqua ions [M(H2O)6]2+ which are present in aqueous solutions of salts of these metals. Covalent character is achieved by using the s and p orbitals. Mercury, however, rarely exceeds a coordination number of four. Coordination numbers of 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 are also known.

==History==
The elements of group 12 have been found throughout history, being used since ancient times to being discovered in laboratories. The group itself has not acquired a trivial name, but it has been called &quot;group IIB&quot; in the past.

===Zinc===
Zinc has been found being used in impure forms in ancient times as well as in alloys such as brass that have been found to be over 2000 years old. Zinc was distinctly recognized as a metal under the designation of &quot;Fasada&quot; in the medical Lexicon ascribed to the Hindu king Madanapala (of Taka dynasty) and written about the year 1374. The metal was also of use to alchemists. The name of the metal was first documented in the 16th century, and is probably derived from the German for the needle-like appearance of metallic crystals.

The isolation of metallic zinc in the West may have been achieved independently by several people in the 17th century. German chemist Andreas Marggraf is usually given credit for discovering pure metallic zinc in a 1746 experiment by heating a mixture of calamine and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal. Experiments on frogs by the Italian doctor Luigi Galvani in 1780 with brass paved the way for the discovery of electrical batteries, galvanization and cathodic protection. In 1799, Galvani&#x27;s friend, Alessandro Volta, invented the Voltaic pile. The biological importance of zinc was not discovered until 1940 when carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active site.

===Cadmium===
In 1817, cadmium was discovered in Germany as an impurity in zinc carbonate minerals (calamine) by Friedrich Stromeyer and Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann. It was named after the Latin &quot;cadmia&quot; for &quot;calamine&quot;, a cadmium-bearing mixture of minerals, which was in turn named after the Greek mythological character, Κάδμος Cadmus, the founder of Thebes. Stromeyer eventually isolated cadmium metal by roasting and reduction of the sulfide.

In 1927, the International Conference on Weights and Measures redefined the meter in terms of a red cadmium spectral line (1 m = 1,553,164.13 wavelengths). This definition has since been changed (see krypton). At the same time, the International Prototype Meter was used as standard for the length of a meter until 1960, when at the General Conference on Weights and Measures the meter was defined in terms of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in vacuum.

===Mercury===
Mercury has been found in Egyptian tombs which have been dated back to 1500 BC, where mercury was used in cosmetics. It was also used by the ancient Chinese who believed it would improve and prolong health. By 500 BC mercury was used to make amalgams (Medieval Latin amalgama, &quot;alloy of mercury&quot;) with other metals. Alchemists thought of mercury as the First Matter from which all metals were formed. They believed that different metals could be produced by varying the quality and quantity of sulfur contained within the mercury. The purest of these was gold, and mercury was called for in attempts at the of base (or impure) metals into gold, which was the goal of many alchemists.

Hg is the modern chemical symbol for mercury. It comes from &quot;hydrargyrum&quot;, a Latinized form of the Greek word Ύδραργυρος (&quot;hydrargyros&quot;), which is a compound word meaning &quot;water-silver&quot; (hydr- = water, argyros = silver) — since it is liquid like water and shiny like silver. The element was named after the Roman god Mercury, known for speed and mobility. It is associated with the planet Mercury; the astrological symbol for the planet is also one of the alchemical symbols for the metal. Mercury is the only metal for which the alchemical planetary name became the common name.

===Copernicium===
The heaviest known group 12 element, copernicium, was first created on February 9, 1996, at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany, by Sigurd Hofmann, Victor Ninov et al. It was then officially named by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) after Nicolaus Copernicus on February 19, 2010, the 537th anniversary of Copernicus&#x27; birth.

==Occurrence==
Like in most other d-block groups, the abundance in Earth&#x27;s crust of group 12 elements decreases with higher atomic number. Zinc is with 65 parts per million (ppm) the most abundant in the group while cadmium with 0.1 ppm and mercury with 0.08 ppm are orders of magnitude less abundant. Copernicium, as a synthetic element with a half-life of a few minutes, may only be present in the laboratories where it was produced.
Group 12 metals are chalcophiles, meaning the elements have low affinities for oxides and prefer to bond with sulfides. Chalcophiles formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions of the early Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The commercially most important minerals of group 12 elements are sulfide minerals. Sphalerite, which is a form of zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60–62% zinc. No significant deposits of cadmium-containing ores are known. Greenockite (CdS), the only cadmium mineral of importance, is nearly always associated with sphalerite (ZnS). This association is caused by the geochemical similarity between zinc and cadmium which makes geological separation unlikely. As a consequence, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct from mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and, to a lesser degree, lead and copper. One place where metallic cadmium can be found is the Vilyuy River basin in Siberia. Although mercury is an extremely rare element in the Earth&#x27;s crust, because it does not blend geochemically with those elements that constitute the majority of the crustal mass, mercury ores can be highly concentrated considering the element&#x27;s abundance in ordinary rock. The richest mercury ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury (12,000 times average crustal abundance). It is found either as a native metal (rare) or in cinnabar (HgS), corderoite, livingstonite and other minerals, with cinnabar being the most common ore.

While mercury and zinc minerals are found in large enough quantities to be mined, cadmium is too similar to zinc and therefore is always present in small quantities in zinc ores from where it is recovered. Identified world zinc resources total about 1.9 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States with the largest reserves in Iran. At the current rate of consumption, these reserves are estimated to be depleted sometime between 2027 and 2055. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and one estimate found that about 109 million tonnes of that remains in use. In 2005, China was the top producer of mercury with almost two-thirds global share followed by Kyrgyzstan. Several other countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents. Because of the high toxicity of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning.

==Production==
Zinc is the fourth most common metal in use, trailing only iron, aluminium, and copper with an annual production of about 10 million tonnes. Worldwide, 95% of the zinc is mined from sulfidic ore deposits, in which sphalerite (ZnS) is nearly always mixed with the sulfides of copper, lead and iron. Zinc metal is produced using extractive metallurgy. Roasting converts the zinc sulfide concentrate produced during processing to zinc oxide. For further processing two basic methods are used: pyrometallurgy or electrowinning. Pyrometallurgy processing reduces zinc oxide with carbon or carbon monoxide at into the metal, which is distilled as zinc vapor. The zinc vapor is collected in a condenser. Electrowinning processing leaches zinc from the ore concentrate by sulfuric acid. After this step electrolysis is used to produce zinc metal.

Cadmium is a common impurity in zinc ores, and it is most isolated during the production of zinc. Some zinc ores concentrates from sulfidic zinc ores contain up to 1.4% of cadmium. Cadmium is isolated from the zinc produced from the flue dust by vacuum distillation if the zinc is smelted, or cadmium sulfate is precipitated out of the electrolysis solution.

The richest mercury ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury, with cinnabar (HgS) being the most common ore in the deposits.
Mercury is extracted by heating cinnabar in a current of air and condensing the vapor.

Superheavy elements such as copernicium are produced by bombarding lighter elements in particle accelerators that induces fusion reactions. Whereas most of the isotopes of copernicium can be synthesized directly this way, some heavier ones have only been observed as decay products of elements with higher atomic numbers. The first fusion reaction to produce copernicium was performed by GSI in 1996, who reported the detection of two decay chains of copernicium-277 (though one was later retracted, as it had been based on data fabricated by Victor Ninov):

==Applications==
Due to the physical similarities which they share, the group 12 elements can be found in many common situations. Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti-corrosion (galvanization) agents as they will attract all local oxidation until they completely corrode. These protective coatings can be applied to other metals by hot-dip galvanizing a substance into the molten form of the metal, or through the process of electroplating which may be passivated by the use of chromate salts. Group 12 elements are also used in electrochemistry as they may act as an alternative to the standard hydrogen electrode in addition to being a secondary reference electrode.

In the US, zinc is used predominantly for galvanizing (55%) and for brass, bronze and other alloys (37%). The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water from corrosion.
Zinc is used as an anode material for batteries such as in zinc–carbon batteries or zinc–air battery/fuel cells.
A widely used alloy which contains zinc is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, depending upon the type of brass. Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper and has superior corrosion resistance. These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves. Other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium solder, and commercial bronze. Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. Roughly one quarter of all zinc output in the United States (2009) is consumed in the form of zinc compounds, a variety of which are used industrially.

Cadmium has many common industrial uses as it is a key component in battery production, is present in cadmium pigments, coatings, and is commonly used in electroplating. In 2009, 86% of cadmium was used in batteries, predominantly in rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries. The European Union banned the use of cadmium in electronics in 2004 with several exceptions but reduced the allowed content of cadmium in electronics to 0.002%. Cadmium electroplating, consuming 6% of the global production, can be found in the aircraft industry due to the ability to resist corrosion when applied to steel components.

Mercury is used primarily for the manufacture of industrial chemicals or for electrical and electronic applications. It is used in some thermometers, especially ones which are used to measure high temperatures. A still increasing amount is used as gaseous mercury in fluorescent lamps, while most of the other applications are slowly phased out due to health and safety regulations, and is in some applications replaced with less toxic but considerably more expensive Galinstan alloy. Mercury and its compounds have been used in medicine, although they are much less common today than they once were, now that the toxic effects of mercury and its compounds are more widely understood. It is still used as an ingredient in dental amalgams. In the late 20th century the largest use of mercury was in the mercury cell process (also called the Castner-Kellner process) in the production of chlorine and caustic soda.

Copernicium has no use other than research due to its very high radioactivity.

==Biological role and toxicity==
The group 12 elements have multiple effects on biological organisms as cadmium and mercury are toxic while zinc is required by most plants and animals in trace amounts.

Zinc is an essential trace element, necessary for plants, animals, and microorganisms. It is &quot;typically the second most abundant transition metal in organisms&quot; after iron and it is the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes. There are 2–4 grams of zinc distributed throughout the human body, and it plays &quot;ubiquitous biological roles&quot;. A 2006 study estimated that about 10% of human proteins (2800) potentially bind zinc, in addition to hundreds which transport and traffic zinc. In the U.S., the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is 8 mg/day for women and 11 mg/day for men. Harmful excessive supplementation may be a problem and should probably not exceed 20 mg/day in healthy people, although the U.S. National Research Council set a Tolerable Upper Intake of 40 mg/day.

Mercury and cadmium are toxic and may cause environmental damage if they enter rivers or rain water. This may result in contaminated crops as well as the bioaccumulation of mercury in a food chain leading to an increase in illnesses caused by mercury and cadmium poisoning.

<text>This is a list of [[bookstore]] chains with brick-and-mortar locations.

In the United Kingdom and many parts of the English speaking world, they are known as &quot;Bookshops&quot; and &quot;newsagents&quot;.

In American English, they are called &quot;bookstores&quot;, or sometimes &quot;newsstands&quot;, as they also usually carry newspapers and magazines. This list includes both current and defunct businesses, and also includes large independent bookstores that have multiple locations, but that use a different business model than most business chains.

==Current==

<doc id="487517" wikidata="Q955236" url="?curid=487517" title="Transboundary protected area">
<text>A transboundary protected area (TBPA) is an ecological protected area that spans boundaries of more than one country or sub-national entity. Such areas are also known as transfrontier conservation areas (TFCAs) or peace parks.

TBPAs exist in many forms around the world, and are established for various reasons. The preservation of traditional animal migration patterns, ensuring sufficient food and water sources for population growth, is a critical reason for the creation of TBPAs. However, TBPAs also encourage tourism, economic development and goodwill between neighbouring countries, as well as making it easier for indigenous inhabitants of the area to travel.

== Types of transboundary protected areas ==
TBPAs exist in various types of geographic configuration, with various levels of ecological protection, and with various levels of international cooperation. Additionally, different organizations employ different definitions for TBPAs. Julia Marton-Lefevre broadly defines TBPAs as &quot;areas that involve a degree of cooperation across one or more boundaries between (or within) countries.&quot; The Southern Africa Development Community&#x27;s Protocol on Wildlife Conservation and Law Enforcement defines Transfrontier Conservation Area as &quot;the area or the component of a large ecological region that straddles the boundaries of two or more countries, encompassing one or more protected areas, as well as multiple resources use areas.&quot; The Global Transboundary Protected Areas Network (GTPAN) lists four types of &quot;transboundary conservation areas:&quot;

* Type 1: transboundary protected area;
* Type 2: transboundary conservation landscape and/or seascape;
* Type 3: transboundary conservation migration area; and
* Special designation: park for peace.

GTPAN defines a transboundary protected area as &quot;a clearly defined geographical space that includes protected areas that are ecologically connected across one or more international boundaries and involves some form of cooperation.&quot; GTPAN defines a transboundary conservation landscape and/or seascape as &quot;an ecologically connected area that includes both protected areas and multiple resource use areas across one or more international boundaries and involves some form of cooperation.&quot;

GTPAN defines a transboundary conservation migration area as &quot;wildlife habitats in two or more countries that are necessary to sustain populations of migratory species and involve some form of cooperation.&quot;

GTPAN defines a &quot;park for peace&quot; as &quot;any of the three types of transboundary conservation areas [that is] dedicated to the promotion, celebration and/or commemoration of peace and cooperation.&quot;

In many instances, individual TBPAs are part of broader international environmental or cultural programs. TBPAs can be World Heritage Sites, Ramsar Wetlands, and/or UNESCO Biosphere Reserves.

==History of transboundary protected areas==

In 1932, the governments of Canada and the United States passed legislation creating the first international peace park: Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park. This action followed from a joint resolution of the Rotary Clubs of Montana and Alberta calling for the creation of the peace park.

On 1 February 1997, Anton Rupert, together with Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands and Nelson Mandela, founded the Peace Parks Foundation as a nonprofit organisation to facilitate the establishment of transfrontier conservation areas (TFCAs).

A 2001 study by the World Conservation Union found &quot;there were 166 existing transboundary protected area complexes worldwide comprising 666 individual conservation zones.&quot;

In 2007, the Global Transboundary Conservation Network published a global inventory of transboundary protected areas identifying 227 transboundary protected areas.

==Areas in the conceptual phase==

TBPA advocates by 2006 had identified additional sites for protection. Professor Saleem Ali of the University of Vermont noted that &quot;numerous ecologically sensitive areas remain unprotected&quot; and cites a 2006 &quot;geographic information systems (GIS) study&quot; that &quot;found 104 transboundary wild areas involving 61 countries that are not formally part of any conservation park.&quot; Specific sites for proposed TBPAs include:

*Liuwa Plain – Kameia TFCA (Angola/Zambia)
*Niassa Reserve – Selous TFCA (Mozambique/Tanzania)
*Mnazi Bay – Quirimbas Transfrontier Marine Conservation Area (Mozambique/Tanzania)
*The demilitarised zone between North and South Korea is a potential TBPA/peace park. Professor Salem Ali notes that the DMZ has &quot;become a sanctuary for wildlife, since there is no development activity occurring in the area.&quot; Nelson Mandela traveled to South Korea to promote such an idea. Ted Turner likewise traveled to the Korean peninsula to promote the idea in 2005.
*The Siachen Glacier region between India and Pakistan has been proposed as a peace park.
*A project for the Green Line Peace Park in Cyprus, between the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot territories, is being researched by Dr Anna Grichting at Harvard University.

As awareness of the importance of conserving the pristinity and ecology of Arctic region has increased, there has been a global call to declare the Arctic region as a global sanctuary/international peace park. The Save the Arctic campaign by Greenpeace, an environmental nonprofit organisation, has received online support from more than 5 million citizens from around the world.

== Impacts on peace and conflict ==
Transboundary protected areas are also termed peace parks. They are supposed to facilitate cooperation and exchange between (adversary) countries, to improve livelihoods of local populations, to demonstrate the possibility of positive-sum interactions, and hence to support more peaceful international relations. There are several cases documented in which trans-boundary conservation contributed to conflict resolution (although it was not the main driver), such as in the Virunga region between the DR Congo, Rwanda and Uganda, around the Trifinio region between El Salvador and Honduras, and in the Cordillera del Cóndor region between Ecuador and Peru. According to a statistical analysis published in 2014, states that share a trans-boundary protected area are slightly less likely to engage with militarized disputes with each other. But the question remains whether the TBPA is a driver or consequence on better interstate relations in these cases. A more recent analysis triangulates data from various sources to show that international environmental cooperation (in the form of TBPAs and water treaties) increases the likelihood for reconciliation between states in conflict. The effect is, however, modest and contingent on a number of context factors such as high levels of environmental attention, internal political stability, a tradition of environmental cooperation and already ongoing processes of reconciliation.

However, a number of authors criticize that peace parks have a very limited impact on formal relations between states, but can accelerate conflicts on the local level, for instance by extending (authoritarian) state control, by prioritizing business and tourism over the interests of local populations, and by excluding local people from the protected areas. TBPAs can also stimulate (low-level) international conflicts, for instance about the sharing of revenues or the presence of human populations in the parks.

== Massive Online Open Course on Peace Park Development and Management==
A Massive Online Open Course on Peace Park Development and Management was developed by the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (SCBD), its Peace and Biodiversity Dialogue Initiative in partnership with UNDP and the NBSAP Forum. This &quot;free&quot; three-week course offered in five languages: English, French, Spanish, Russian and Arabic. Financial support is provided by the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity&#x27;s Peace and Biodiversity Dialogue Initiative funded by the Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Korea.

This course will:
* offer a comprehensive guide on Peace Park establishment; 
* teach participants to make a strong case for Peace Park development; 
* develop the skills to effectively plan, establish and manage Peace Parks; 
* address the challenges associated with the creation and management of these transboundary protected areas.

The course is designed for Peace Park development practitioners and environmental peacebuilding enthusiasts but is open to everyone. Participants must create an account on Learning for Nature before registering for the course.

<doc id="487518" wikidata="Q205253" url="?curid=487518" title="Group 10 element">
<text>Group 10, numbered by current IUPAC style, is the group of chemical elements in the periodic table that consists of nickel (Ni), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), and darmstadtium (Ds). All are d-block transition metals. All known isotopes of darmstadtium are radioactive with short half-lives, and are not known to occur in nature; only minute quantities have been synthesized in laboratories.

==Characteristics==

=== Chemical properties ===

The ground state electronic configurations of palladium and platinum are exceptions to Madelung&#x27;s rule. According to Madelung&#x27;s rule, the electronic configuration of palladium and platinum are expected to be [Kr] 5s2 4d8 and [Xe] 4f14 5d8 6s2 respectively. However, the 5s orbital of palladium is empty, and the 6s orbital of platinum is only partially filled. The relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital is the explanation to the predicted electron configuration of darmstadtium, which, unusually for this group, conforms to that predicted by the Aufbau principle. In general, the ground state electronic configurations of heavier atoms and transition metals are more difficult to predict.

Group 10 elements are observed in oxidation states of +1 to +4. The +2 oxidation state is common for nickel and palladium, while +2 and +4 are common for platinum. Oxidation states of -2 and -1 have also been observed for nickel and platinum, and an oxidation state of +5 has been observed for palladium and platinum. Platinum has also been observed in oxidations states of -3 and +6. Theory suggests that platinum may produce a +10 oxidation state under specific conditions, but this remains to be shown empirically.

=== Physical properties ===

Darmstadtium has not been isolated in pure form, and its properties have not been conclusively observed; only nickel, palladium, and platinum have had their properties experimentally confirmed. Nickel, platinum, and palladium are typically silvery-white transition metals, and can also be readily obtained in powdered form. They are hard, have a high luster, and are highly ductile. Group 10 elements are resistant to tarnish (oxidation) at STP, are refractory, and have high melting and boiling points.

==Occurrence and production==
Nickel occurs naturally in ores, and it is the earth&#x27;s 22nd most abundant element. Two prominent groups of ores from which it can be extracted are laterites and sulfide ores. Indonesia holds the world&#x27;s largest nickel reserve, and is also its largest producer.

== History ==

=== Discoveries of the elements ===

==== Nickel ====
The use of nickel, often mistaken for copper, dates as far back as 3500 BCE. Nickel has been discovered in a dagger dating to 3100 BCE, in Egyptian iron beads, a bronze reamer found in Syria dating to 3500–3100 BCE, as copper-nickel alloys in coins minted in Bactria, in weapons and pots near the Senegal river, and as agricultural tools used by Mexicans in the 1700s. There is evidence to suggest that the use of nickel in antiquity came from meteoric iron, such as in the Sumerian name for iron &quot;an-bar&quot; (&quot;fire from heaven&quot;) or in Hittite texts that describe iron&#x27;s heavenly origins. Nickel was not formally named as an element until A. F. Cronstedt isolated the impure metal from &quot;kupfernickel&quot; (Old Nick&#x27;s copper) in 1751. In 1804, J. B. Richter determined the physical properties of nickel using a purer sample, describing the metal as ductile and strong with a high melting point. The strength of nickel-steel alloys were described in 1889 and since then, nickel steels saw extensive use first for military applications and then in the development of corrosion- and heat-resistant alloys during the 20th century.

==== Palladium ====
Palladium was isolated by William Hyde Wollaston in 1803 while he was working on refining platinum metals. Palladium was in a residue left behind after platinum was precipitated out of a solution of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid as (NH4)PtCl6. Wollaston named it after the recently discovered asteroid 2 Pallas and anonymously sold small samples of the metal to a shop, which advertised it as a &quot;new noble metal&quot; called &quot;Palladium, or New Silver&quot;. This raised doubts about its purity, source, and the identity of its discoverer, causing controversy. He eventually identified himself and read his paper on the discovery of palladium to the Royal Society in 1805.

==== Platinum ====
Prior to its formal discovery, platinum was used in jewelry by native Ecuadorians of the province of Esmeraldas. The metal was found in small grains mixed with gold in river deposits, which the workers sintered with gold to form small trinkets such as rings. The first published report of platinum was written by Antonio de Ulloa, a Spanish mathematician, astronomer, and naval officer who observed &quot;platina&quot; (little silver) in the gold mines of Ecuador during a French expedition in 1736. Miners found the &quot;platina&quot; difficult to separate from gold, leading to the abandonment of those mines. Charles Wood (ironmaster) brought samples of the metal to England in 1741 and investigated its properties, observing its high melting point and its presence as small white grains in black metallic sand. Interest in the metal grew after Wood&#x27;s findings were reported to the Royal Society. Henrik Teofilus Scheffer, a Swedish scientist, referred to the precious metal as &quot;white gold&quot; and the &quot;seventh metal&quot; in 1751, reporting its high durability, high density, and that it melted easily when mixed with copper or arsenic. Both Pierre-François Chabaneau (during the 1780s) and William Hyde Wollaston (during the 1800s) developed a powder metallurgy technique to produce malleable platinum, but kept their process a secret. However, their platinum ingots were brittle and tended to crack easily, likely due to impurities. In the 1800s, furnaces capable of sustaining high temperatures were invented, which eventually replaced powder metallurgy and introduced melted platinum to the market.

==Applications==
The group 10 metals share several uses. These include:
* Decorative purposes, in the form of jewelry and electroplating.
* Catalysts in a variety of chemical reactions.
* Metal alloys.
* Electrical components, due to their predictable changes in electrical resistivity with regard to temperature.
* Superconductors, as components in alloys with other metals.

==Biological role and toxicity==
Platinum complexes are commonly used in chemotherapy as anticancer drugs due to their antitumor activity. Palladium complexes also show marginal antitumor activity, yet its poor activity is labile compared to platinum complexes.

<doc id="487522" wikidata="Q2790732" url="?curid=487522" title="The Case of the Constant Suicides">
<text>The Case of the Constant Suicides, first published in 1941, is a detective story by John Dickson Carr. Like much of Dickson Carr&#x27;s work, this novel is a locked room mystery, in addition to being a whodunnit. Unlike most of the other Dr. Fell novels, this story has a high humour level, reminiscent of the Henry Merrivale works.

==Plot summary==

Members of a large and widespread Scottish family are brought together at a highland castle in order to resolve various pieces of family business following a death. Suspicious events soon begin to occur, the body count rises, and a verdict of suicide is not necessarily to be trusted. Enter the gargantuan Doctor Gideon Fell, who applies his substantial powers of deduction to the problem of how men can be indirectly murdered while they&#x27;re inside locked, sealed and inaccessible rooms.

==Characters in &quot;The Case of the Constant Suicides&quot;==
*Gideon Fell – medical doctor and amateur detective, protagonist
*Dr. Alan Campbell (M.A. Oxon, Ph.D. Harvard) – professor of history
*Dr. Kathryn Campbell – teaches history at the Harpenden College for Women
*Dr. Colin Campbell
*Miss Elspat Campbell
*Charles E. Swan
*Alec Forbes
*Alistair Duncan
*Walter Chapman
*Jock Fleming

==Literary significance and criticism==
&quot;This has been called &#x27;Carr at his best&#x27; by someone in the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;. The statement is true, for this tale offers a few characters and a few problems that are soberly and adroitly dealt with, instead of being enveloped in a mixture of highjinks and red herrings as the author likes to do with his good situations and brilliant solutions.&quot;

<text>Barrett Firearms Manufacturing is an Australian-owned, American manufacturer of firearms and ammunition located in Christiana, Tennessee. It was founded in 1982 by Ronnie G. Barrett for the purpose of building semi-automatic rifles chambered for the .50 BMG (12.7×99mm NATO) ammunition, originally developed for and used in M2 Browning machine guns. Barrett began this work in the early 1980s, and the first working rifles were available in 1982, hence the designation M82. Barrett personally designed every part of the weapon. He marketed the weapon and mass-produced it utilizing private funds. He continued to develop the rifle through the 1980s, and developed the improved M82A1 rifle by 1986. Barrett was acquired by the NIOA Group on 17 January 2023, solidifying the long-standing relationship between the two companies.

==History==
Barrett introduced the M82 in 1982 but did not have significant sales until 1989. These first large sales were to Sweden. Soon afterward, the M82 was purchased by the United States armed forces, and it was deployed in the Gulf War. The company has since gained contracts with dozens of countries to supply sniper rifles.

The success of the M82A1 led the company to develop several other models of .50 BMG rifles, including the M95, M99, and M99-1. These are lighter and lower cost bolt-action and single-shot rifles.

An early customer of the M82 (or &quot;Barrett Light Fifty&quot;) was the IRA, which conducted a sniper campaign against the British Armed Forces in Northern Ireland in the 1990s. An unidentified IRA volunteer, quoted by author Toby Harnden, said that:

What&#x27;s special about the Barrett is the huge kinetic energy... The bullet can just walk through a flak jacket. South Armagh was the prime place to use such weapon because of the availability of Brits. They came to dread it and that was part of its effectiveness. 

The US military uses the M82A3 and a newer version, the M107, as an anti-materiel rifle. It is used by explosive ordnance disposal teams with special military HEIAP ammunition. 

Barrett also manufactured the REC7 upper receiver for the AR-15 style rifle, chambered in 6.8 mm Remington SPC, which was one of the weapons the US Army reviewed in 2008 while drafting requirements for a potential M4 carbine replacement.

In response to California&#x27;s ban of civilian ownership of .50 BMG rifles, Barrett suspended sales and service to all law enforcement agencies in California. In October 2008, Barrett introduced the new M98B. The M98B was a bolt-action rifle chambered in .338 Lapua Magnum, which went on sale in 2009. On February 26, 2016, Tennessee named the Barrett M82 the official rifle of the State of Tennessee.

In 2021, Barrett secured a $50 million contract for the United States Army Precision Sniper Rifle initiative.

In January 2023, Barrett was acquired by Australian defense contractor NIOA. Long-serving Barrett Chief Operating Officer Bryan James became president. Barrett founder Ronnie Barrett said: &quot;Today marks the beginning of a new chapter in the Barrett story. Rob and the NIOA team have great respect for the legacy Barrett has created as the leader in long range precision rifles. It&#x27;s reassuring to know Barrett will be in good hands with a family-owned company that is focused on manufacturing and delivering world-class firearms and munitions to a global network.&quot;

<text>Search/Retrieve Web service (SRW) is a web service for search and retrieval. SRW provides a SOAP interface to queries, to augment the URL interface provided by its companion protocol Search/Retrieve via URL (SRU). Queries in SRU and SRW are expressed using the Contextual Query Language (CQL).

Standards for SRW, SRU, and CQL are promulgated by the United States Library of Congress.

The SRW service and SRU protocol were both created by as part of the ZING (Z39.50 International: Next Generation) initiative as successors to the Z39.50 protocol.

<doc id="487530" wikidata="Q2883027" url="?curid=487530" title="Business Development Bank of Canada">
<text>The Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC; ) is a Crown corporation and national development bank wholly owned by the Government of Canada, mandated to help create and develop Canadian businesses through financing, growth and transition capital, venture capital and advisory services, with a focus on small and medium-sized enterprises.

Founded in 1944, its corporate headquarters is located in Montreal and it has more than 123 business centres working with 60,000 clients. BDC&#x27;s debt obligations, secured by the Government of Canada, are issued to public and private sector institutions.

==History==
The bank was established by an Act of Parliament as the Industrial Development Bank (IDB) in September 1944. IDB was initially an arm of the Bank of Canada, and the Governor of the Bank was also Chief Executive Officer of the IDB. During its first years, the bank&#x27;s main role was to help small &quot;industrial enterprises&quot; convert from military production to peacetime operations after World War II. IDB was one of the first and largest development banks in the world.

The &quot;Industrial Development Bank Act&quot; was first amended in 1952 to allow the bank to offer financing to companies in the commercial airlines industry. By the mid-1950s, one in ten planes in Canada was financed by IDB. Later, the &quot;Industrial Development Bank Act&quot; was amended twice more to allow the bank to lend to companies in almost all industries.

By 1964, 20 years after its foundation, IDB had 22 branches across Canada, covering main cities such as Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary and Vancouver, including operations in relatively rural areas. In the mid-1970s, the bank added consulting and training to its financial offerings to help entrepreneurs better manage their businesses.

In 1975, its name was changed to Federal Business Development Bank (FBDB), and its venture capital operations were started. At the time, the bank was known as &quot;a lender of last resort&quot;—supporting businesses in difficulty.

In 1995, the &quot;Business Development Bank of Canada Act&quot; was passed, leading to a new name and mission for the bank. It mandated BDC to promote entrepreneurship, focusing on the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to fill gaps in the market and maximize financing alternatives for businesses by offering services that were complementary to those available from other financial institutions.

BDC is financially self-sustaining. Since 1998, it has been profitable and paid a total of more than $746 million in dividends to its sole shareholder, the Government of Canada. On June 8, 2022, BDC’s Board of Director authorized the repurchase of $5.0 billion of its common shares.
Every ten years, the Minister of Industry must conduct a review of the provisions and operations of the BDC Act. The last legislative review was completed in December 2014.

In April 2021, the Bank announced the appointment of Isabelle Hudon as President and Chief Executive Officer as of August of the same year, at the end of the term of current CEO Michael Denham. In 2023, current and former staff raised concerns about spending at the bank, including expenditure on consulting services from McKinsey &amp; Company and air transport for a private chauffeur.

==Services==
BDC offers loans and advisory services with a focus on small and medium-sized companies. It reports to Parliament through the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development. BDC Capital, a subsidiary of BDC, offers specialized financing, including venture capital, equity as well as growth and business transition capital.

BDC&#x27;s Venture Capital arm makes strategic investments in Canadian companies through its Energy/Cleantech Fund, Healthcare Fund and IT Fund. Notable investments include GradeSlam, Q1 Labs, Radian6, Canopy Labs, D-Wave Systems, CoolIT Systems, Protiva Biotherapeutics, Sanctuary AI and Klipfolio Dashboard.

BDC is a complementary lender, offering commercial loans and investments that fill out or complete services available from private-sector financial institutions. It also provides advice to businesses through its advisory services division.

Launched by FBDB in 1979, Small Business Week is a yearly celebration of entrepreneurs and their contribution to Canadian society. It became a nationwide event in 1981.

==Tax Exemption==
BDC is exempt from taxes imposed by the Income Tax Act.

==Recognition==
BDC was named among Canada&#x27;s Top 100 employers from 2007 to 2018.

BDC Capital won multiple Deal of the Year Awards from the Canadian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association in the venture capital category. It won in 2011, for its investment in Radian6 Technologies Inc.; in 2012, for its investment in Q1 Labs Inc.; and again in 2014, for its investment in Layer 7 Technologies.

<doc id="487538" wikidata="Q37530" url="?curid=487538" title="Australian Terrier">
<text>The Australian Terrier is a small breed of dog of the terrier type. The breed was developed in Australia, although the ancestral types of dogs from which the breed descends were from Great Britain.

== Appearance ==
The Australian Terrier is a small dog with short legs, weighing around and standing about at the withers, with a medium length shaggy harsh double coat that is not normally trimmed. Fur is shorter on the muzzle, lower legs, and feet, and there is a ruff around the neck. The coat colours are blue or silver and tan with a lighter coloured topknot, and with markings on face, ears, body and legs of a colour described in the breed standard as &quot;tan, never sandy&quot;, or a solid red with a sandy variation. The tail was traditionally docked, in order to protect the dog from spinal injury while working and hunting in the field.

== History ==
The Australian Terrier is descended from the rough coated type terriers brought from Great Britain to Australia in the early 19th century. The ancestral types of all of these breeds were kept to eradicate mice and rats. The Australian Terrier shares ancestors with the Cairn Terrier, Shorthaired Skye Terrier, and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier; Yorkshire Terriers and Irish Terriers were also crossed into the dog during the breed&#x27;s development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark/Brace&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of the breed began in Australia about 1820, and the dogs were at first called the Rough Coated Terrier. The breed was officially recognised in 1850, and later renamed as the Australian Terrier in 1892. The Australian Terrier was shown at a dog show for the first time in 1906 in Melbourne, and was also shown in Great Britain about the same time.

==Health==
The Australian Terrier is known to be susceptible to the auto-immune disease Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome.

A 2002 survey by the Australian Terrier Club of America found that the top three causes of death were old age (17%), cancer (15%), and diabetes (13%). The most common conditions affecting dogs were diabetes mellitus (10%), luxating patella (9%), ear infections (5%), cataracts (5%), flea allergy dermatitis (5%), ruptured cranial cruciate ligament (4%), and hypothyroidism (4%).

===Life expectancy===
Life expectancy in the 2002 American survey was 11 years. Bitches lived roughly a year longer than dogs. A survey in the UK of breed club members found the Australian Terrier to have a median life expectancy of just above 12 years.

==Temperament==
The breed standard describes the ideal Australian Terrier temperament as spirited, alert, &quot;with the natural aggressiveness of a ratter and hedge hunter&quot;. The Australian Terrier ranks 34th in Stanley Coren&#x27;s &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot;, being of above average &quot;Working and Obedience&quot; intelligence, indicating good trainability.

<doc id="487539" wikidata="Q1192560" url="?curid=487539" title="Mount Tarawera">
<text>Mount Tarawera is a volcano on the North Island of New Zealand within the older but volcanically productive Ōkataina Caldera. Located 24 kilometres southeast of Rotorua, it consists of a series of rhyolitic lava domes that were fissured down the middle by an explosive basaltic eruption in 1886. While the 1886 eruption was basaltic, study has shown there was only a small basalt component to the previous recent rhyolitic predominant eruptions. This eruption was one of New Zealand&#x27;s largest historical eruptions, and killed an estimated 120 people. The fissures run for about northeast–southwest.

The volcano&#x27;s component domes include Ruawahia Dome (the highest at 1,111 metres), Tarawera Dome and Wahanga Dome. It is surrounded by several lakes, most of which were created or drastically altered by the 1886 eruption. These include Lakes Tarawera, Rotomahana, Rerewhakaaitu, Ōkataina, Ōkareka, Tikitapu / Blue and Rotokākahi / Green. The Tarawera River runs northeastwards across the northern flank of the mountain from Lake Tarawera.

In 2000, the mountain was ceded to the Ngāti Rangitihi sub-tribe of Te Arawa. In 2002, the group and their lessee stopped previously free public access to the mountain. This decision caused angst among Rotorua residents.

The eruption that generated the Ōkareka Tephra has been dated to 23,535 ± 300 years before the present. It had a tephra volume of about but may be less, generated in days or weeks at the most. The associated eruption mountain building appears to have been at both ends of the complex and includes present features at the eastern end such as the Rotomahana Dome () and Patiti Island (peak is high) which is in the middle of Lake Rotomahana. Lava fields at the western end came from sources most likely buried in the Waiohau eruption, have a volume of at least , and would have taken several years to form. The Ōkareka Embayment is a separate, but adjacent volcanic structure in the Ōkataina Caldera responsible for the Rotorua Tephra.

===Rerewhakaaitu eruption===
The Rerewhakaaitu eruption has been recently re-dated forward to 17,496 ± 462 years ago, at about the time of the last glacial termination, with a tephra volume of about . Other historic sources suggested a higher volume. It involved three rhyolite magmas with a total volume of about with the Rerewhakaaitu Tephra having 15 rhyolitic fall units. The Southern () and Western () Domes were formed at this time and the lava excursion of again lasted for several years after the much shorter tephra phase of the eruption.

===Waiohau eruption===
The Waiohau eruption occurred 14,009 ± 155 years ago (recently re-dated backward). The Kanakana () and Eastern () Domes were formed. The estimated total volume of the fifteen or more Waiohau Tephra eruptions and some lava is . During one of the eruptions structural collapse of the then mountain occurred.

===Kaharoa eruption===
Mount Tarawera erupted 1314±12 CE in the Kaharoa eruption. This was just a few years after the first Māori settlement about 1280 CE although more widespread settlement is now believed to have not taken place until 1320 to 1350 AD. The Plinian phase of this eruption consisted of 11 discrete episodes of VEI 4 although there are possibly two more discrete sub-Plinian phases in a two-stage eruption from at least two different vents along a long fissure. The total dense rock equivalent (DRE) was at least . It distributed the Kaharoa Tephra, very low in the essential mineral cobalt (lack of cobalt is a factor in New Zealand bush sickness), from the east coast of the Northland Peninsula, down the Coromandel Peninsula and through beyond Tarawera to northern Hawke Bay at the Māhia Peninsula. The total volume of material erupted was more than 5 times that of the 1886 eruption and has been stated to be at least of tephra. The Ruawahia (), Tarawera(), Wahanga () and Crater () Domes were formed.

===1886 eruption=== 
Shortly after midnight on the morning of 10 June 1886, a series of more than 30 increasingly strong earthquakes were felt in the Rotorua area and by 2:45 am Mount Tarawera&#x27;s three peaks had erupted, blasting three distinct columns of smoke and ash thousands of metres into the sky At around 3.30 am, the largest phase of the eruption commenced; vents at Rotomahana produced a pyroclastic surge that destroyed several villages within a 6 kilometer radius, and the Pink and White Terraces appeared to be obliterated. Recent research using mathematical modelling of events during the later Rotomahana eruption phase, is consistent with eyewitness accounts; describing it resembling a pot boiling over.
Settlements inhabited by Ngāti Rangitihi and Tūhourangi around the Ariki arm of Lake Tarawera, including Moura, Koutu, Kokotaia, Piripai, Pukekiore and Otuapane, Tapahoro, Te Wairoa, Totarariki, and Waingongoro, were buried or destroyed. Of these, Te Wairoa is now a tourist attraction and is described as the &quot;buried village&quot;. The official death toll was reported as 153, and many more were displaced, making the eruption the most deadly in New Zealand history.

The eruption was also believed to have destroyed the world-famous Pink and White Terraces. However, 125 years after the eruption a small portion of the Pink Terraces was reportedly rediscovered under Lake Rotomahana. This was due to the discovery of a previously unknown 1859 survey of Lake Rotomahana by Ferdinand von Hochstetter, which was deciphered and published between 2016 and 2019. This unique primary data indicate the Pink, Black and White Terrace locations now lie along the present lake shores. There is a prospect the terraces or sections of them, may lie buried, and as a result the terraces can no longer be assumed destroyed.

==The phantom waka==
One legend surrounding the 1886 eruption is that of the phantom &quot;waka&quot; (canoe). Eleven days before the eruption, a boat full of tourists returning from the Terraces saw what appeared to be a waka approach their boat, only to disappear in the mist half a mile from them. One of the witnesses was a clergyman, a local Maori man from the Te Arawa iwi. Nobody around the lake owned such a war canoe, and nothing like it had been seen on the lake for many years.
It is possible that the rise and fall of the lake level caused by pre-eruption fissures had freed a burial waka from its resting place. Traditionally, the dead were tied in an upright position. A number of letters have been published from the tourists who experienced the event.

Though skeptics maintained that it was a freak reflection seen on the mist, tribal elders at Te Wairoa claimed that it was a &quot;waka wairua&quot; (spirit canoe) and was a portent of doom. It has been suggested that the waka was actually a freak wave on the water, caused by seismic activity below the lake, but locals believe that a future eruption will be signalled by the reappearance of the waka. 

==Geology==

It is within the Ōkataina Caldera of the Ōkataina Volcanic Centre in the central segment of the Taupō Volcanic Zone. This rhyolitic segment is dominated by explosive caldera. The actual basaltic dyke of the 1886 eruption is long and extends from the eruptive fissure of Mount Tarawera to Lake Rotomahana and has a remnant hydrothermal hot spot in the Waimangu Volcanic Rift Valley. The dyke and linear line of vents align with the Taupō Rift at this point.

<doc id="487540" wikidata="Q386597" url="?curid=487540" title="Prime ring">
<text>In abstract algebra, a nonzero ring &quot;R&quot; is a prime ring if for any two elements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; of &quot;R&quot;, &quot;arb&quot; = 0 for all &quot;r&quot; in &quot;R&quot; implies that either &quot;a&quot; = 0 or &quot;b&quot; = 0. This definition can be regarded as a simultaneous generalization of both integral domains and simple rings.

Although this article discusses the above definition, prime ring may also refer to the minimal non-zero subring of a field, which is generated by its identity element 1, and determined by its characteristic. For a characteristic 0 field, the prime ring is the integers, and for a characteristic &quot;p&quot; field (with &quot;p&quot; a prime number) the prime ring is the finite field of order &quot;p&quot; (cf. Prime field).

==Equivalent definitions==
A ring &quot;R&quot; is prime if and only if the zero ideal {0} is a prime ideal in the noncommutative sense.

This being the case, the equivalent conditions for prime ideals yield the following equivalent conditions for &quot;R&quot; to be a prime ring:
*For any two ideals &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; of &quot;R&quot;, &quot;AB&quot; = {0} implies &quot;A&quot; = {0} or &quot;B&quot; = {0}.
*For any two &quot;right&quot; ideals &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; of &quot;R&quot;, &quot;AB&quot; = {0} implies &quot;A&quot; = {0} or &quot;B&quot; = {0}.
*For any two &quot;left&quot; ideals &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; of &quot;R&quot;, &quot;AB&quot; = {0} implies &quot;A&quot; = {0} or &quot;B&quot; = {0}.

Using these conditions it can be checked that the following are equivalent to &quot;R&quot; being a prime ring:
*All nonzero right ideals are faithful as right &quot;R&quot;-modules.
*All nonzero left ideals are faithful as left &quot;R&quot;-modules.

== Examples ==

* Any domain is a prime ring.
* Any simple ring is a prime ring, and more generally: every left or right primitive ring is a prime ring.
* Any matrix ring over an integral domain is a prime ring. In particular, the ring of 2 × 2 integer matrices is a prime ring.
== Properties ==

* A commutative ring is a prime ring if and only if it is an integral domain.
* A nonzero ring is prime if and only if the monoid of its ideals lacks zero divisors.
* The ring of matrices over a prime ring is again a prime ring.

<text>In abstract algebra, a matrix ring is a set of matrices with entries in a ring &quot;R&quot; that form a ring under matrix addition and matrix multiplication. The set of all matrices with entries in &quot;R&quot; is a matrix ring denoted M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) (alternative notations: Mat&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) and ). Some sets of infinite matrices form infinite matrix rings. A subring of a matrix ring is again a matrix ring. Over a rng, one can form matrix rngs.

When &quot;R&quot; is a commutative ring, the matrix ring M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) is an associative algebra over &quot;R&quot;, and may be called a matrix algebra. In this setting, if &quot;M&quot; is a matrix and &quot;r&quot; is in &quot;R&quot;, then the matrix &quot;rM&quot; is the matrix &quot;M&quot; with each of its entries multiplied by &quot;r&quot;.

== Examples ==
* The set of all square matrices over &quot;R&quot;, denoted M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;). This is sometimes called the &quot;full ring of &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrices&quot;.
* The set of all upper triangular matrices over &quot;R&quot;.
* The set of all lower triangular matrices over &quot;R&quot;.
* The set of all diagonal matrices over &quot;R&quot;. This subalgebra of M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) is isomorphic to the direct product of &quot;n&quot; copies of &quot;R&quot;.
* For any index set &quot;I&quot;, the ring of endomorphisms of the right &quot;R&quot;-module formula_1 is isomorphic to the ring formula_2 of column finite matrices whose entries are indexed by and whose columns each contain only finitely many nonzero entries. The ring of endomorphisms of &quot;M&quot; considered as a left &quot;R&quot;-module is isomorphic to the ring formula_3 of row finite matrices.
* If &quot;R&quot; is a Banach algebra, then the condition of row or column finiteness in the previous point can be relaxed. With the norm in place, absolutely convergent series can be used instead of finite sums. For example, the matrices whose column sums are absolutely convergent sequences form a ring. Analogously of course, the matrices whose row sums are absolutely convergent series also form a ring. This idea can be used to represent operators on Hilbert spaces, for example.
* The intersection of the row-finite and column-finite matrix rings forms a ring formula_4.
* If &quot;R&quot; is commutative, then M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) has a structure of a *-algebra over &quot;R&quot;, where the involution * on M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) is matrix transposition. 
* If &quot;A&quot; is a C*-algebra, then M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is another C*-algebra. If &quot;A&quot; is non-unital, then M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is also non-unital. By the Gelfand–Naimark theorem, there exists a Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; and an isometric *-isomorphism from &quot;A&quot; to a norm-closed subalgebra of the algebra &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) of continuous operators; this identifies M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) with a subalgebra of &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;⊕&quot;n&quot;). For simplicity, if we further suppose that &quot;H&quot; is separable and &quot;A&quot; formula_5 &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) is a unital C*-algebra, we can break up &quot;A&quot; into a matrix ring over a smaller C*-algebra. One can do so by fixing a projection &quot;p&quot; and hence its orthogonal projection 1 − &quot;p&quot;; one can identify &quot;A&quot; with formula_6, where matrix multiplication works as intended because of the orthogonality of the projections. In order to identify &quot;A&quot; with a matrix ring over a C*-algebra, we require that &quot;p&quot; and 1 − &quot;p&quot; have the same &quot;rank&quot;; more precisely, we need that &quot;p&quot; and 1 − &quot;p&quot; are Murray–von Neumann equivalent, i.e., there exists a partial isometry &quot;u&quot; such that and . One can easily generalize this to matrices of larger sizes.
* Complex matrix algebras M&quot;n&quot;(C) are, up to isomorphism, the only finite-dimensional simple associative algebras over the field C of complex numbers. Prior to the invention of matrix algebras, Hamilton in 1853 introduced a ring, whose elements he called biquaternions and modern authors would call tensors in , that was later shown to be isomorphic to M2(C). One basis of M2(C) consists of the four matrix units (matrices with one 1 and all other entries 0); another basis is given by the identity matrix and the three Pauli matrices.
* A matrix ring over a field is a Frobenius algebra, with Frobenius form given by the trace of the product: .

== Structure ==
* The matrix ring M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) can be identified with the ring of endomorphisms of the free right &quot;R&quot;-module of rank &quot;n&quot;; that is, . Matrix multiplication corresponds to composition of endomorphisms.
* The ring M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) over a division ring &quot;D&quot; is an Artinian simple ring, a special type of semisimple ring. The rings formula_7 and formula_8 are &quot;not&quot; simple and not Artinian if the set &quot;I&quot; is infinite, but they are still full linear rings.
* The Artin–Wedderburn theorem states that every semisimple ring is isomorphic to a finite direct product formula_9, for some nonnegative integer &quot;r&quot;, positive integers &quot;n&quot;&quot;i&quot;, and division rings &quot;D&quot;&quot;i&quot;.
* When we view M&quot;n&quot;(C) as the ring of linear endomorphisms of C&quot;n&quot;, those matrices which vanish on a given subspace &quot;V&quot; form a left ideal. Conversely, for a given left ideal &quot;I&quot; of M&quot;n&quot;(C) the intersection of null spaces of all matrices in &quot;I&quot; gives a subspace of C&quot;n&quot;. Under this construction, the left ideals of M&quot;n&quot;(C) are in bijection with the subspaces of C&quot;n&quot;.
* There is a bijection between the two-sided ideals of M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) and the two-sided ideals of &quot;R&quot;. Namely, for each ideal &quot;I&quot; of &quot;R&quot;, the set of all matrices with entries in &quot;I&quot; is an ideal of M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;), and each ideal of M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) arises in this way. This implies that M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) is simple if and only if &quot;R&quot; is simple. For , not every left ideal or right ideal of M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) arises by the previous construction from a left ideal or a right ideal in &quot;R&quot;. For example, the set of matrices whose columns with indices 2 through &quot;n&quot; are all zero forms a left ideal in M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;).
* The previous ideal correspondence actually arises from the fact that the rings &quot;R&quot; and M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) are Morita equivalent. Roughly speaking, this means that the category of left &quot;R&quot;-modules and the category of left M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;)-modules are very similar. Because of this, there is a natural bijective correspondence between the &quot;isomorphism classes&quot; of left &quot;R&quot;-modules and left M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;)-modules, and between the isomorphism classes of left ideals of &quot;R&quot; and left ideals of M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;). Identical statements hold for right modules and right ideals. Through Morita equivalence, M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) inherits any Morita-invariant properties of &quot;R&quot;, such as being simple, Artinian, Noetherian, prime.

== Properties ==
* If &quot;S&quot; is a subring of &quot;R&quot;, then M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) is a subring of M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;). For example, M&quot;n&quot;(Z) is a subring of M&quot;n&quot;(Q).
* The matrix ring M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) is commutative if and only if , , or &quot;R&quot; is commutative and . In fact, this is true also for the subring of upper triangular matrices. Here is an example showing two upper triangular matrices that do not commute, assuming in &quot;R&quot;:
*:: formula_10
*: and
*:: formula_11
* For , the matrix ring M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) over a nonzero ring has zero divisors and nilpotent elements; the same holds for the ring of upper triangular matrices. An example in matrices would be
*:: formula_12
* The center of M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) consists of the scalar multiples of the identity matrix, &quot;I&quot;&quot;n&quot;, in which the scalar belongs to the center of &quot;R&quot;.
* The unit group of M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;), consisting of the invertible matrices under multiplication, is denoted GL&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;).
* If &quot;F&quot; is a field, then for any two matrices &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; in M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;F&quot;), the equality implies . This is not true for every ring &quot;R&quot; though. A ring &quot;R&quot; whose matrix rings all have the mentioned property is known as a stably finite ring .

== Matrix semiring ==
In fact, &quot;R&quot; needs to be only a semiring for M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) to be defined. In this case, M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) is a semiring, called the matrix semiring. Similarly, if &quot;R&quot; is a commutative semiring, then M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) is a .

For example, if &quot;R&quot; is the Boolean semiring (the two-element Boolean algebra with ), then M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) is the semiring of binary relations on an &quot;n&quot;-element set with union as addition, composition of relations as multiplication, the empty relation (zero matrix) as the zero, and the identity relation (identity matrix) as the unity.

<text>Guadalupe Mountains National Park is a national park of the United States in the Guadalupe Mountains, east of El Paso, Texas. The mountain range includes Guadalupe Peak, the highest point in Texas at , and El Capitan used as a landmark by travelers on the route later followed by the Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach line. The ruins of a stagecoach station stand near the Pine Springs visitor center. The restored Frijole Ranch contains a small museum of local history and is the trailhead for Smith Spring. The park covers in the same mountain range as Carlsbad Caverns National Park, about to the north in New Mexico. The Guadalupe Peak Trail winds through pinyon pine and Douglas-fir forests as it ascends over to the summit of Guadalupe Peak, with views of El Capitan and the Chihuahuan Desert.

The McKittrick Canyon trail leads to a stone cabin built in the early 1930s as the vacation home of Wallace Pratt, a petroleum geologist who donated the land. Dog Canyon, on the northern park boundary at the Texas-New Mexico State line, is accessed via Carlsbad, New Mexico or Dell City, Texas. Camping is available at the Pine Springs campground and at Dog Canyon. A public corral for livestock is available by reservation. The park observes Mountain Time.

The Gypsum sand dunes lie on the west side of the park near Dell City. A rough four-wheel drive road leads to the Williams Ranch.

==Park purpose==
As stated in the foundation document:
==History==

The Guadalupe Mountains give their name to the Guadalupian series in the Permian period. The International Commission on Stratigraphy estimates the mountain range&#x27;s age at 272–260 Mya. The mountains have had a tumultuous history for thousands of years. Archaeological evidence shows that people have lived there for over 10,000 years in and among the many caves and alcoves. Hunter-gatherers followed large game and collected edible vegetation, as evidenced by the discovery of projectile points, baskets, pottery and rock art.

The first Europeans to arrive in the area were the Spanish in the 16th century, but they did not make serious attempts to settle in the area. The Spanish introduced horses; nomadic indigenous tribes like the Apaches soon found them an asset for hunting and migrating. Mescalero Apaches followed game and harvested the agave (or mescal) for food and fiber (Mescalero is Spanish for mescal-maker). Agave roasting pits and other artifacts of Mescalero culture can be found in the park.
The Mescalero Apaches occupied the mountains through the mid-19th century, but were challenged by an American transportation route at the end of the American Civil War. During the 1840s and 1850s, many immigrants travelled west crossed the area. In 1858, Pinery Station was constructed near Pine Springs for the Butterfield Overland Mail. The Butterfield Overland Mail crossed Guadalupe Pass, located at above sea level. The 9th Cavalry Regiment was ordered to the area to stop Indian raids on settlements and the mail stage route. During the winter of 1869, Lt. H.B. Cushing led his troops into the Guadalupe Mountains and destroyed two Mescalero Apache camps. They were eventually driven out of the area and into US reservations.
Felix McKittrick was one of the first European settlers in the Guadalupe Mountains; he worked cattle during the 1870s. McKittrick Canyon is thought to be named after him. Frijole Ranch was the first permanent ranch house, constructed in 1876 by the Rader brothers. It became the only major building in the region and served as a community center and regional post office from 1916 to 1942. Today, it has been restored and serves as a cultural museum. In 1908 Williams Ranch House was built, and it was named after one of its inhabitants, James Adolphus Williams. Judge J.C. Hunter from Van Horn, Texas consolidated most of the smaller ranches in the area into the Guadalupe Mountain Ranch.
In 1921, Wallace Pratt, a geologist for Humble Oil and Refining Company, was impressed by the beauty of McKittrick Canyon and bought the land to build two houses there. 

The two houses were:

* Wallace Pratt Lodge
* Wallace E. Pratt House (Ship on the Sea)

Both were used as summer homes by Pratt and his family up until 1960. Wallace Pratt donated about of McKittrick Canyon which became part of Guadalupe Mountains National Park, which was dedicated and formally opened to the public in September 1972.

In 1978, the United States Congress designated 46,850 acres (190 km2) of the park as a wilderness area.

==Geography==

The Guadalupe Mountains reach their highest point at Guadalupe Peak, the highest point in Texas, with an elevation of . The range lies southeast of the Sacramento Mountains and east of the Brokeoff Mountains. The mountain range extends north-northwest and northeast from Guadalupe Peak in Texas into New Mexico. The northeastern extension ends about southwest of Carlsbad, near Carlsbad Caverns National Park; the southwest tip ends with El Capitan about east of El Paso. The mountains rise more than above the arid floor of the Chihuahuan Desert. The Guadalupe Mountains are surrounded by the South Plains to the east and north, Delaware Mountains to the south, and Sacramento Mountains to the west.
The northwestern extension, bounded by a dramatic escarpment known as &quot;The Rim&quot;, extends much further into New Mexico, approaching close to the Sacramento Mountains. The range is bordered on the north by Four Mile Canyon; on the east by the valley of the Pecos River; and on the west by Piñon Creek, Big Dog Canyon, Valley Canyon, Middle Dog Canyon and West Dog Canyon. Much of the range is built from the ancient Capitán Reef, formed at the margins of a shallow sea during the Permian Period. As the range is built up almost entirely of limestone, upland areas have little or no surface water. The only significant surface water is McKittrick Creek, in McKittrick Canyon, which emerges from the eastern side of the massif, just south of the New Mexico border. Elevations at the base of the range vary from above sea level on the western side to on the east. Several peaks on the southern end exceed .

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Guadalupe Mountains National Park has a cold semi-arid climate (BSk). The plant hardiness zone on Guadalupe Peak is 7b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of 6.1 °F (-14.4 °C).

The Guadalupe Mountains experience relatively hot summers, calm, mild autumn weather, and cool to cold weather in winter and early spring. Snow storms, sleet storms, freezing rain, or fog may occur in winter or early spring. Frequent high wind warnings are issued during winter through spring. Late summer monsoons produce thunderstorms. Nights are cool, even in summer.

==Ecology==

Three major ecosystems are contained within the park. The Chihuahuan Desert exhibits salt flats, creosote bushes, and honey mesquite on the western side of the park, with low elevations on the eastern side covered with grassland, pinyon pine, and junipers. The canyon interiors, including McKittrick, Bear, and Pine Springs Canyon, exhibit bigtooth maple, velvet ash, chinkapin oak, and other deciduous trees that are fed by springs recharged by mountain streams. Finally, alpine areas more than above sea level contain forests of ponderosa pine, Arizona pine, southwestern white pine, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, alligator juniper, and small stands of quaking aspen.

The range contains many large cave systems, including Carlsbad Caverns and Lechuguilla Cave. The history of the range includes occupation by ancient Pueblo and Mogollon peoples, and by the Apache and various outlaws in the 19th century.

===Flora===
The park is home to over 1000 species of plants, some of which include cacti, succulents, wildflowers, grasses and shrubs. &quot;Viola guadalupensis&quot;, the Guadalupe Mountains violet, is a rare plant that is endemic to the park.

===Fauna===
Mammals that inhabit this national park include elk, javelina, gray fox, American black bear, coyote, bobcat, striped and hog-nosed skunk, badger, sixteen species of bat, mule deer, and mountain lion. Birds of this park include great horned owl, chickadee, sparrow, woodpecker, turkey vulture, greater roadrunner, hummingbird, peregrine falcon, golden eagle, wren, and grosbeak.

<doc id="487553" wikidata="Q2452027" url="?curid=487553" title="Province of Maryland">
<text>The Province of Maryland was an English and later British colony in North America from 1634 until 1776, when the province was one of the Thirteen Colonies that joined in supporting the American Revolution against Great Britain. In 1781, Maryland was the 13th signatory to the Articles of Confederation. The province&#x27;s first settlement and capital was in St. Mary&#x27;s City, located at the southern end of St. Mary&#x27;s County, a peninsula in the Chesapeake Bay bordered by four tidal rivers.

The province began in 1632 as the Maryland Palatinate, a proprietary palatinate granted to Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, whose father, George, had long sought to found a colony in the New World to serve as a refuge for Catholics at the time of the European wars of religion. Palatines from the Holy Roman Empire also immigrated to Maryland, with many settling in Fredrick County, with Maryland Palatines () reaching a population of 50,000 by 1774.

Provincial Maryland served as an early pioneer of religious toleration in the English colonies. However, religious strife among Anglicans, Puritans, Catholics, and Quakers was common in the early years and Puritan rebels briefly seized control of the province. Later, in 1689, the year following the Glorious Revolution in Great Britain, John Coode led a rebellion that removed Lord Baltimore, a Catholic, from power in Maryland. That power was restored to the Baltimore family in 1715 after Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, declared in public that he was a Protestant.

Despite early competition with the colony of Virginia to its south, and the Holland Dutch colony of New Netherland to its north, the province of Maryland developed along similar lines to Virginia. Its early settlements and population centers tended to cluster around the rivers and other waterways that empty into the Chesapeake Bay, and, like Virginia, Maryland&#x27;s economy quickly became centered on the cultivation of tobacco for sale in Europe.

However, after tobacco prices collapsed, the need for cheap labor to accommodate the mixed farming economy that followed led to a rapid expansion of the Atlantic slave trade and the concomitant American enslavement of Africansas well as the expansion of indentured servitude and British penal transportation. Maryland received a larger felon quota than any other province.

Maryland was an active participant in the events leading up to the American Revolution, echoing events in New England by establishing committees of correspondence and hosting its own tea party similar to the one that took place in Boston. By 1776 the old order had been overthrown as Maryland&#x27;s colonial representatives signed the Declaration of Independence, presaging the end of British colonial rule.

==Origins in the 17th century==
===Founding charter===
The Catholic George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore (1579–1632), former Secretary of State to King Charles I of England, wished to create a haven for English Catholics in the New World. After having visited the Americas and founded a colony in the future Canadian province of Newfoundland called &quot;Avalon&quot;, he convinced the King to grant him a second territory in more southern, temperate climes. Upon Baltimore&#x27;s death in 1632 the grant was transferred to his eldest son Cecil, the 2nd Baron Baltimore.

On June 20, 1632, Charles granted the original charter for Maryland, a proprietary colony of about twelve million acres (49,000 km2), to the 2nd Baron Baltimore. Some historians view this grant as a form of compensation for the 2nd Lord Baltimore&#x27;s father&#x27;s having been stripped of his title of Secretary of State upon announcing his Catholicism in 1625. 

Whatever the reason for granting the colony specifically to Lord Baltimore, however, the King had practical reasons to create a colony north of the Potomac in 1632. The colony of New Netherland begun by England&#x27;s great imperial rival in this era, the United Provinces, specifically claimed the Delaware River valley and was vague about its border with Virginia. Charles rejected all the Dutch claims on the Atlantic seaboard, but was anxious to bolster English claims by formally occupying the territory. The new colony was named after the devoutly Catholic Queen Henrietta Maria, by an agreement between the 1st Lord Baltimore and King Charles I.

Colonial Maryland was considerably larger than the present-day State of Maryland. The original charter granted the Calverts a province with a boundary line that started &quot;from the promontory or headland, called Watkin&#x27;s Point, situate upon the bay aforesaid near the river Wighco on the West, unto the main ocean on the east; and between that boundary on the south, unto that part of the bay of Delaware on the north, which lyeth under the 40th degree of north latitude from the aequinoctial, where New England is terminated.&quot;p. 116 The boundary line would then continue westward along the fortieth parallel &quot;unto the true meridian of the first fountain of the river Pattowmack&quot;. From there, the boundary continued south to the southern bank of the Potomac River, continue along the southern river bank to the Chesapeake Bay, and &quot;thence by the shortest line unto the aforesaid promontory, or place, called Watkin&#x27;s Point.&quot;p. 38. Based on this deceptively imprecise description of the boundary, the land may have comprised up to , 50% larger than today&#x27;s State.

===Early settlement===

In Maryland, Baltimore sought to create a haven for English Catholics and to demonstrate that Catholics and Protestants could live together peacefully, even issuing the Act Concerning Religion in matters of religion. The 1st Lord Baltimore was himself a convert to Catholicism, a considerable political setback for a nobleman in 17th-century England, where Catholics could easily be considered enemies of the crown and potential traitors to their country. Like other aristocratic proprietors, he also hoped to turn a profit on the new colony.
The Calvert family recruited Catholic aristocrats and Protestant settlers for Maryland, luring them with generous land grants and a policy of religious toleration. To try to gain settlers, Maryland used what is known as the headright system, which originated in Jamestown. Settlers were given of land for each person they brought into the colony, whether as settler, indentured servant, or slave.

Of the 200 or so initial settlers who traveled to Maryland on the ships &quot;Ark&quot; and &quot;Dove,&quot; the majority were Protestant. On November 22, 1633, Lord Baltimore sent the first settlers to the new colony, and after a long voyage with a stopover to resupply in Barbados, the &quot;Ark&quot; and the &quot;Dove&quot; landed on March 25, 1634 (thereafter celebrated as &quot;Maryland Day&quot;), at Blackistone Island, thereafter known as St. Clement&#x27;s Island, off the northern shore of the Potomac River, upstream from its confluence with the Chesapeake Bay and Point Lookout. The new settlers were led by Lord Baltimore&#x27;s younger brother the Honorable Leonard Calvert, whom Baltimore had delegated to serve as governor of the new colony.

 The Native Americans in Maryland were a peaceful people who welcomed the English. At the time of the founding of the Maryland colony, approximately forty tribes consisting of 8,000 – 10,000 people lived in the area. They were fearful of the colonists&#x27; guns, but welcomed trade for metal tools. The Native Americans who were living in the location where the colonists first settled were called the Yaocomico Indians. The colonists gave the Yaocomico Indians cloth, hatchets, and hoes in exchange for the right to settle on the land. The Yaocomico Indians allowed the English settlers to live in their houses, a type of longhouse called a witchott. The Indians also taught the colonists how to plant corn, beans, and squash, as well as where to find food such as clams and oysters.

Here at St. Clement&#x27;s Island they raised a large cross, and led by Jesuit Father Andrew White celebrated Mass. The new settlement was called &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s City&quot; and it became the first capital of Maryland. It remained so for sixty years until 1695 when the colony&#x27;s capital was moved north to the more central, newly established &quot;Anne Arundel&#x27;s Town (also briefly known as &quot;Providence&quot;) and later renamed as &quot;Annapolis&quot;.
More settlers soon followed. The tobacco crops that they had planted from the outset were very successful and quickly made the new colony profitable. However, given the incidence of malaria and typhoid, life expectancy in Maryland was about 10 years less than in New England.

&quot;Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City&quot; (a historic preservationist/tourism agency) has been established to protect what is left of the ruins of the original 17th-century village, and several reconstructed, government buildings, little of which remained intact. With the exception of several periods of rebellion by early Protestants and later colonists, the colony/province remained under the control of the several Lords Baltimore until 1775–1776, when it joined with other colonies in rebellion against Great Britain and eventually became the independent and sovereign U.S. State of Maryland.

===Relations with the Susquehannock===

The establishment of the Province of Maryland disrupted the trade relationship between Virginia colonists and the Susquehannock, an Iroquoian-speaking tribe that lived in the lower Susquehanna River valley. Following a raid on a Jesuit mission in 1641, the Governor of Maryland declared the Susquehannock &quot;enemies of the province.&quot; A few attempts were made to organize a military campaign, however, it was not until 1643 that an ill-fated expedition was mounted. The Susquehannock inflicted numerous casualties on the English and captured two cannon. 15 prisoners were taken and afterwards tortured to death.

 Raids on Maryland continued intermittently until 1652. In the winter of 1652, the Susquehannock were attacked by the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois), and although the attack was repulsed, it led to the Susquehannock negotiating the Articles of Peace and Friendship with Maryland. The Susquehannock relinquished their claim to territory on either side of Chesapeake Bay, and reestablished a trading relationship with the English.

A Haudenosaunee raid in 1660 led Maryland to expand its treaty with the Susquehannock into an alliance. The Maryland assembly authorized armed assistance, and described the Susquehannock as &quot;a Bullwarke and Security of the Northern Parts of this Province.&quot; A detachment of 50 soldiers was sent to help defend the Susquehannock town against Haudenosaunee attacks. Despite suffering a smallpox epidemic in 1661, the Susquehannock easily withstood a siege in 1663, and destroyed a Haudenosaunee war party in 1666.

By 1675, epidemics and years of war had taken their toll on the Susquehannock. They abandoned their village on the Susquehanna River and moved south into Maryland. Governor Charles Calvert invited them to settle on the Potomac River above the Great Falls, however, the Susquehannock instead chose to occupy a site on Piscataway Creek where they erected a palisaded fort. In July 1675, a group of Virginians chasing Doeg raiders crossed the Potomac into Maryland and mistakenly killed several Susquehannock. Subsequent raids in Virginia and Maryland were blamed on the tribe. In September 1675, a thousand-man expedition against the Susquehannock was mounted by militia from Virginia and Maryland led by John Washington and Thomas Truman. After arriving at the Susquehannock town, Truman and Washington summoned five sachems to a parley, but then had them summarily executed. Sorties during the ensuing six-week siege resulted in 50 English deaths. In early November, the Susquehannock escaped the siege under cover of darkness, killing ten of the militia as they slept.

Most of Susquehannock crossed the Potomac and took refuge in the Piedmont of Virginia. Two encampments were established on the Meherrin River near the village of the Siouan-speaking Occaneechi. In January 1676, the Susquehannock raided plantations in Virginia, killing 36 colonists. Nathaniel Bacon, unhappy with Governor Sir William Berkeley&#x27;s response to the raids, organized a volunteer militia to hunt down the Susquehannock. Bacon persuaded the Occaneechi to attack the closest Susquehannock encampment. After the Occaneechi returned with Susquehannock prisoners, Bacon turned on his allies and indiscriminately massacred Occaneechi men, women and children.

Other Susquehannock refugees fled to hunting camps on the North Branch of the Potomac or took refuge with the Lenape. Some refugees returned to the Susquehanna River in 1676 and established a palisaded village near the site of their previous village. This village was also abandoned when the inhabitants merged with the Haudenosaunee a few years later.

===Border disputes===
====With Virginia====
In 1629, George Calvert, 1st Lord Baltimore, &quot;driven by &#x27;the sacred duty of finding a refuge for his Catholic brethren&#x27;&quot;, applied to Charles I for a royal charter to establish a colony south of Virginia. He also wanted a share of the fortunes being made in tobacco in Virginia, and hoped to recoup some of the financial losses he had sustained in his earlier colonial venture in Newfoundland.

In 1631, William Claiborne, a Puritan from Virginia, received a royal trading commission granting him the right to trade with the natives in all lands in the mid-Atlantic where there was not already a patent in effect. Claiborne established a trading post on Kent Island on May 28, 1631.

Meanwhile, back in London, the Privy Council persuaded Lord Baltimore to accept instead a charter for lands north of the Virginia colony, in order to put pressure on the Dutch settlements further north along the Delaware and Hudson Rivers. Calvert agreed, but died in 1632 before the charter was formally signed by King Charles I. The Royal Grant and Charter for the new colony of Maryland was then granted to his son, Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, on June 20, 1632. This placed Claiborne on Calvert land. Claiborne refused to recognize Lord Baltimore&#x27;s charter and rights, or the authority of his brother Leonard as governor.

Following the arrest of one of his agents for trading in Maryland waters without a license in 1635, Claiborne fitted out an armed ship. There ensued a naval battle on April 23, 1635, by the mouth of the Pocomoke River during which three Virginians were killed. Following this battle, Leonard Calvert captured Kent Island by force in February 1638.

In 1644, during the English Civil War, Claiborne led an uprising of Protestants in what came to be called the Plundering Time, also known as &quot;Claiborne and Ingle&#x27;s Rebellion&quot;, and retook Kent Island. Meanwhile, privateer Captain Richard Ingle (Claiborne&#x27;s co-commander) seized control of St. Mary&#x27;s City, the capital of the Maryland colony. Catholic Governor Calvert escaped to the Virginia Colony which remained nominally loyal to the crown until 1652. The Protestant pirates began plundering the property of anyone who did not swear allegiance to the Parliament of England, mainly Catholics. The rebellion was put down in 1647 by Governor Calvert.

The victory of Parliament in England renewed old tensions. This led to the 1655 Battle of the Severn, at the settlement of &quot;Providence&quot; (present-day Annapolis, Maryland). Moderate Protestants and Catholics loyal to Lord Baltimore, under the command of William Stone,
met Puritans loyal to the Commonwealth of England from Providence under the command of Captain William Fuller. 17 of Stone&#x27;s men and two Puritans were killed, resulting in victory for the Puritans.

The issue of the ongoing Claiborne grievance was finally settled by an agreement reached in 1657. Lord Baltimore gave Claiborne amnesty for all of his offenses, Virginia laid aside any claim it had to Maryland territory, and Claiborne was indemnified with extensive land grants in Virginia for his loss of Kent Island.

&quot;Multiple colonial charters, two negotiated settlements by the states in 1785 and 1958, an arbitrated agreement in 1877, and several Supreme Court decisions have defined how Maryland and Virginia would deal with the Potomac River as a boundary line, and shaped the boundary on the Eastern Shore (separating Accomack County, Virginia, from Worcester and Somerset counties in Maryland).&quot;

====With Pennsylvania====

The border dispute with Pennsylvania continued and led to Cresap&#x27;s War, a conflict between settlers from Pennsylvania and Maryland fought in the 1730s. Hostilities erupted in 1730 with a series of violent incidents prompted by disputes over property rights and law enforcement, and escalated through the first half of the decade, culminating in the deployment of military forces by Maryland in 1736 and by Pennsylvania in 1737. The armed phase of the conflict ended in May 1738 with the intervention of King George II, who compelled the negotiation of a cease-fire. A provisional agreement had been established in 1732.

Maryland lost some of its original territory to Pennsylvania in the 1660s when King Charles II granted the Penn family, owners of Pennsylvania, a tract that overlapped the Calvert family&#x27;s Maryland grant. For 80 years the powerful Penn and Calvert families had feuded over overlapping Royal grants. Surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon mapped the Maryland-Pennsylvania border in 1767, setting out the Mason–Dixon line.

====With New York====
In 1672, Lord Baltimore declared that Maryland included the settlement of Whorekills on the west shore of the Delaware Bay, an area under the jurisdiction of the Province of New York (as the British had renamed New Netherland after taking possession in 1664). A force was dispatched which attacked and captured this settlement. New York could not immediately respond because New York was soon recaptured by the Dutch. This settlement was restored to the Province of New York when New York was recaptured from the Dutch in November, 1674.

==Government==

===The Lords Baltimore===
* George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore (1579–1631), Secretary of State under King James I, applied in 1629 for a charter to establish a colony in the Mid-Atlantic area of North America, but died five weeks before it was issued.
* Caecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (1605–1675), inherited both his father&#x27;s title and his charter, which was granted in 1632. He was named for Sir Robert Cecil, first Earl of Salisbury, principal Secretary of State to Queen Elizabeth, whom Calvert had met during an extended trip to Europe between 1601 and 1603. Rather than go to the colony himself, Baltimore stayed behind in England to deal with the political opposition raised by supporters of the Virginia Colony and sent his next younger brother Leonard in his stead. Caecilius never travelled to Maryland.
* Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore (1637–1715), sailed to Maryland in 1661 as a young man of 24, becoming the first member of the Calvert family to take personal charge of the colony. He was appointed deputy governor by his father and, when the 2nd Lord Baltimore died in 1675, Charles inherited Maryland, becoming governor in his own right. During his tenure the price of tobacco began to decline, causing economic hardship especially among the poor. A hurricane in 1667 devastated the tobacco crop. In 1684, the 3rd Lord Baltimore traveled to England in regard to a border dispute with William Penn. He never returned to Maryland. In his absence the Protestant Revolution of 1689 took control of the colony. That year the family&#x27;s royal charter was also withdrawn, and Maryland became a Royal Colony.

* Benedict Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore (1679–1715) understood that the chief impediment to the restoration of his family&#x27;s title to Maryland was the question of religion. In 1713 he converted to Anglicanism, despite his father cutting off his support. He also withdrew his son Charles from a Jesuit school, largely for political reasons. Henceforth father and son would worship within the Church of England, much to the disgust of his father Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore, who maintained his Catholic faith despite the political drawbacks, until his death in February 1715. Benedict became the Fourth Lord Baltimore upon his father&#x27;s death in February 1715 and immediately petitioned King George I to reinstate the family&#x27;s charter. However, the 4th Lord Baltimore survived his father by only two months, dying himself in April 1715. 
* Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore (1699–1751) was the great-grandson of Charles II of England through his maternal grandmother, Charlotte Lee, Countess of Lichfield, the illegitimate daughter of the king&#x27;s mistress, Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland. The Province of Maryland was restored to the control of the Calvert family by King George I when around 1715 Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, swore publicly that he was a Protestant and had embraced the Anglican faith.
* Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore (1731–1771) inherited from his father the title Baron Baltimore and the Proprietary Governorship of the Province of Maryland in 1751. The 6th Lord Baltimore wielded immense power in Maryland, which was then a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain, administered directly by the Calverts. Frederick&#x27;s inheritance coincided with a period of rising discontent in Maryland, amid growing demands by the legislative assembly for an end to his family&#x27;s authoritarian rule. Frederick, however, remained aloof from the colony and never set foot in it in his lifetime. He lived a life of leisure, writing verse and regarding the Province of Maryland as little more than a source of revenue. The colony was ruled through governors appointed by the 6th Lord Baltimore. His frequent travels made him difficult to contact and meant that Maryland was largely ruled without him. His personal life was extremely scandalous by the standards of the time, and this contributed to growing unrest in his colony. In 1758, his wife &quot;died from a hurt she received by a fall out of a Phaeton carriage&quot; while accompanied by her husband. Although Frederick was suspected of foul play, no charges were ever brought.

Frederick died in 1771, by which time relations between Britain and her American colonies were fast deteriorating. In his will, Frederick left his proprietary Palatinate of Maryland to his eldest illegitimate son, Henry Harford, then aged just 13. The colony, perhaps grateful to be rid of Frederick at last, recognized Harford as Calvert&#x27;s heir. However, the will was challenged by the family of Frederick&#x27;s sister, Louisa Calvert Browning, who did not recognize Harford&#x27;s inheritance. Before the case could grind its way through the Court of Chancery, Maryland had become engulfed by the American Revolution and by 1776 was at war with Britain. Henry Harford would ultimately lose almost all his colonial possessions.

===Proprietarial rule===
Lord Baltimore held all the land directly from the King for the payment of &quot;two Indian arrowheads annually and one fifth of all gold and silver found in the colony.&quot; Maryland&#x27;s foundation charter was drafted in feudal terms and based on the practices of the ancient County Palatine of Durham, which existed until 1646. He was given the rights and privileges of a Palatine lord, and the extensive authority that went with it. The Proprietor had the right and power to establish courts and appoint judges and magistrates, to enforce all laws, to grant titles, to erect towns, to pardon all offenses, to found churches, to call out the fighting population and wage war, to impose martial law, to convey or lease the land, and to levy duties and tolls.

However, as elsewhere in English North America, English political institutions were re-created in the colonies, and the Maryland General Assembly fulfilled much the same function as the House of Commons of England. An act was passed providing that:
:&quot;from henceforth and for ever everyone being of the council of the Province and any other gentleman of able judgement summoned by writ (and the Lord of every Manor within this Province after Manors be erected) shall and may have his voice, seat, and place in every General Assembly. together with two or more able and sufficient men for the hundred as the said freedmen or the major part of them ... shall think good&quot;.
In addition, the Lord Proprietor could summon any delegates whom he was pleased to select.

In some ways the General Assembly was an improvement upon the institutions of the mother country. In 1639, noting that Parliament had not been summoned in England for a decade, the free men of Maryland passed an act to the effect that &quot;assemblies were to be called once in every three years at the least,&quot; ensuring that their voices would be regularly heard.

Due to immigration, by 1660 the population of the Province had gradually become predominantly Protestant. Political power remained concentrated in the hands of the largely Catholic elite. Most councilors were Catholics and many were related by blood or marriage to the Calverts, enjoying political patronage and often lucrative offices such as commands in the militia or sinecures in the Land Office.

==Religious conflict==
Although Maryland was an early pioneer of religious toleration in the British colonies, religious strife among Anglicans, Puritans, Catholics, and Quakers was common in the early years, and Puritan rebels briefly seized control of the province. In 1644 the dispute with William Claiborne led to armed conflict. Claiborne seized Kent Island while his associate, the pro-Parliament Puritan Richard Ingle, took over St. Mary&#x27;s. Both used religion as a tool to gain popular support. From 1644 to 1646, the so-called &quot;Plundering Time&quot; was a period of civil unrest aggravated by the tensions of the English Civil War (1641–1651). Leonard Calvert returned from exile with troops, recaptured St. Mary&#x27;s City, and eventually restored order.

In 1649 Maryland passed the Maryland Toleration Act, also known as the Act Concerning Religion, a law mandating religious tolerance for trinitarian Christians. Passed on September 21, 1649, by the assembly of the Maryland Colony, it was the first law requiring religious tolerance in the English North American colonies. In 1654, after the Third English Civil War (1649–1651), Parliamentary (Puritan) forces assumed control of Maryland for a time.

When dissidents pressed for an established church, Caecilius Calvert&#x27;s noted that Maryland settlers were &quot;Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptists, and Quakers, those of the Church of England as well as the Romish being the fewest ... it would be a most difficult task to draw such persons to consent unto a Law which shall compel them to maintaine ministers of a contrary perswasion to themselves.&quot;

In 1650, Maryland had 10 churches with regular services which included all 5 Catholic churches in the colonies at the time, 4 Anglican churches, and 1 Congregational church. Following the First Great Awakening (1730–1755), the number of regular places of worship in Maryland grew to 94 in 1750 (50 Anglican, 18 Presbyterian, 15 Catholic, 4 Baptist, 4 Dutch Reformed, and 3 Lutheran), with the colony gaining an additional 110 regular places of worship to a total of 204 by 1776 (51 Episcopal, 30 Catholic, 29 Presbyterian, 26 Friends, 21 Methodism, 16 German Reformed, 16 Lutheran, 5 Baptist, 5 German Baptist Brethren, 2 Dutch Reformed, 2 Moravian, and 1 Mennonite).

==The Protestant Revolution of 1689==

In 1689, Maryland Puritans, by now a substantial majority in the colony, revolted against the proprietary government, in part because of the apparent preferment of Catholics like Colonel Henry Darnall to official positions of power. Led by Colonel John Coode, an army of 700 Puritans defeated a proprietarial army led by Colonel Darnall. Darnall later wrote: &quot;Wee being in this condition and no hope left of quieting the people thus enraged, to prevent effusion of blood, capitulated and surrendered.&quot; The victorious Coode and his Puritans set up a new government that outlawed Catholicism, and Darnall was deprived of all his official roles. Coode&#x27;s government was, however, unpopular; and William III installed a Crown-appointed governor in 1692. This was Lionel Copley who governed Maryland until his death in 1694 and was replaced by Francis Nicholson.

After this &quot;Protestant Revolution&quot; in Maryland, Darnall was forced, like many other Catholics, to maintain a secret chapel in his home in order to celebrate the Catholic Mass. In 1704, an Act was passed &quot;to prevent the growth of Popery in this Province&quot;, preventing Catholics from holding political office.

Full religious toleration would not be restored in Maryland until the American Revolution, when Darnall&#x27;s great-grandson Charles Carroll of Carrollton, arguably the wealthiest Catholic in Maryland, signed the American Declaration of Independence.

==Plantations and economy==


Early settlements and population centers tended to cluster around the rivers and other waterways that empty into Chesapeake Bay. In the 17th century, most Marylanders lived in rough conditions on small farms. While they raised a variety of fruits, vegetables, grains, and livestock, the main cash crop was tobacco, which soon dominated the province&#x27;s economy.

The Province of Maryland developed along lines very similar to those of Virginia. Tobacco was used as money, and the colonial legislature was obliged to pass a law requiring tobacco planters to raise a certain amount of corn as well, in order to ensure that the colonists would not go hungry. Like Virginia, Maryland&#x27;s economy quickly became centered around the farming of tobacco for sale in Europe. The need for cheap labor to help with the growth of tobacco, and later with the mixed farming economy that developed when tobacco prices collapsed, led to a rapid expansion of indentured servitude and, later, forcible immigration and enslavement of Africans.

By 1730 there were public tobacco warehouses every fourteen miles. Bonded at £1,000 sterling, each inspector received from £25 to £60 as annual salary. Four hogsheads of 950 pounds were considered a ton for London shipment. Ships from English ports did not need port cities; they called at the wharves of warehouses or plantations along the rivers for tobacco and the next year returned with goods the planters had ordered from the shops of London.

Outside the plantations, much land was operated by independent farmers who rented from the proprietors, or owned it outright. They emphasized subsistence farming to grow food for their large families. Many of the Irish and Scottish immigrants specialized in rye-whiskey making, which they sold to obtain cash.

==The 18th century==

Maryland developed into a plantation colony by the 18th century. In 1700 there were about 25,000 people and by 1750 that had grown more than 5 times to 130,000. By 1755, about 40% of Maryland&#x27;s population was black. Maryland planters also made extensive use of indentured servants and penal labor. An extensive system of rivers facilitated the movement of produce from inland plantations and farms to the Atlantic coast for export. Baltimore, on the Patapsco River, leading to the Chesapeake Bay, was the second-most important port in the 18th-century South, after Charleston, South Carolina.

Dr. Alexander Hamilton (1712–1756) was a Scottish-born doctor and writer who lived and worked in Annapolis. Leo Lemay says his 1744 travel diary &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Progress: The Itinerarium of Dr. Alexander Hamilton&quot; is &quot;the best single portrait of men and manners, of rural and urban life, of the wide range of society and scenery in colonial America.&quot;

The Abbé Claude C. Robin, a chaplain in the army of General Rochambeau, who travelled through Maryland during the Revolutionary War, described the lifestyle enjoyed by families of wealth and status in the colony:
:[Maryland houses] are large and spacious habitations, widely separated, composed of a number of buildings and surrounded by plantations extending farther than the eye can reach, cultivated ... by unhappy black men whom European avarice brings hither. ...Their furniture is of the most costly wood, and rarest marbles, enriched by skilful and artistic work. Their elegant and light carriages are drawn by finely bred horses, and driven by richly apparelled slaves.&quot;

The first printing press was introduced to the Province of Maryland in 1765 by a German immigrant, Nicholas Hasselbach, whose equipment was later used in the printing of Baltimore&#x27;s first newspapers, &quot;The Maryland Journal&quot; and &quot;The Baltimore Advertiser&quot;, first published by William Goddard in 1773.

In the late colonial period, the southern and eastern portions of the Province continued in their tobacco economy, but as the American Revolution approached, northern and central Maryland increasingly became centers of wheat production. This helped drive the expansion of interior farming towns like Frederick and Maryland&#x27;s major port city of Baltimore.

===The American Revolution===

Up to the time of the American Revolution, the Province of Maryland was one of two colonies that remained an English proprietary colony, Pennsylvania being the other. Maryland declared independence from Britain in 1776, with Samuel Chase, William Paca, Thomas Stone, and Charles Carroll of Carrollton signing the Declaration of Independence for the colony. In the 1776–77 debates over the Articles of Confederation, Maryland delegates led the party that insisted that states with western land claims cede them to the Confederation government, and in 1781 Maryland became the last state to ratify the Articles of Confederation. It accepted the United States Constitution more readily, ratifying it on April 28, 1788.

Maryland also gave up some territory to create the new District of Columbia after the American Revolution.

<doc id="487555" wikidata="Q1193126" url="?curid=487555" title="Halosaur">
<text>Halosaurs are eel-shaped fishes found only at great ocean depths. As the family Halosauridae, halosaurs are one of two families within the order Notacanthiformes; the other being the deep-sea spiny eels, Notacanthidae. Halosaurs are thought to have a worldwide distribution, with some 17 species in three genera represented. Only a handful of specimens have been observed alive, all in chance encounters with Remotely operated underwater vehicles.

The term &quot;halosaur&quot; refers to the type genus, &quot;Halosaurus&quot;, which is a Greek compound word, &quot;hals&quot; meaning &quot;sea&quot; and &quot;sauros&quot; meaning &quot;lizard&quot;. Halosaurs have a spotty fossil record, the oldest known genus being &quot;Echidnocephalus&quot; from the Late Cretaceous (Campanian) strata of Westphalia, Germany, and the second-oldest known genus, &quot;Laytonia&quot;, from Miocene strata of California and Oregon. The fossil specimens already bear strong resemblance to the modern genera. The halosaurs&#x27; greatly elongated bodies end in whip-like tails; their scales are large. One small dorsal fin is close to the sharply pointed, mostly scaleless head. The tail fin is greatly reduced, with the anal fin being the largest fin. Their pectoral fins are slender and greatly elongated. Their mouths are somewhat large, with the lower jaw shorter than the upper jaw. The swim bladder is absent in all known species, except for &quot;Aldrovandia oleosa&quot;, which has a very small bladder.

The largest species, the 90-cm (3-ft) long abyssal halosaur (&quot;Halosauropsis macrochir&quot;) is also one of the most deep-living fish, recorded at depths of 3,300 m (11,000 ft). Halosaurs have developed certain adaptations to life at these extreme depths, where no light penetrates. Their lateral line system enabling the detection of vibrations in the water is highly developed; the pores run the length of the fish&#x27;s body. Some species are also known to hold their elongated pectorals erect and forward, possibly providing a further means of detection.

Halosaurs are benthic fish, spending their time cruising over or resting on the sea floor, where temperatures may be just 2–4 °C. They propel themselves with rhythmic, lateral undulations of their bodies, not unlike sea snakes. Halosaurs are thought to prey mainly on benthic invertebrates, such as polychaete worms, echinoderms, and crustaceans such as copepods, but they may also consume small fishes and cephalopods.

In life, most halosaurs are grey to bluish-black in colour. Like other notacanthiform fish, halosaurs are able to regenerate their tails easily if lost. This adaptation can be likened to certain terrestrial reptiles, such as the glass lizard, which sacrifices its tail to evade predators.

==Genera==
Halosurs are classified into the following genera:
The genus &quot;Enchelurus&quot; is sometimes considered a halosaur, but has more recently been found to either be sister to the Anguilliformes and Notacanthiformes as a whole, or a stem-member of the Anguilliformes.

<doc id="487561" wikidata="Q153312" url="?curid=487561" title="Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium">
<text>Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, commonly known as RFK Stadium and originally known as District of Columbia Stadium, is a defunct multi-purpose stadium in Washington, D.C. It is located about due east of the U.S. Capitol building, near the west bank of the Anacostia River and next to the D.C. Armory. Opened in 1961, it was owned by the federal government until 1986.

RFK Stadium was home to a National Football League (NFL) team, two Major League Baseball (MLB) teams, five professional soccer teams, two college football teams, a bowl game, and a USFL team. It hosted five NFC Championship games, two MLB All-Star Games, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s World Cup matches, nine men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s first-round soccer games of the 1996 Olympics, three MLS Cup matches, two MLS All-Star games, and numerous American friendlies and World Cup qualifying matches. It hosted college football, college soccer, baseball exhibitions, boxing matches, a cycling race, an American Le Mans Series auto race, marathons, and dozens of major concerts and other events.

RFK was one of the first major stadiums designed to host both baseball and football. Although other stadiums already served this purpose, such as Cleveland Stadium (1931) and Baltimore&#x27;s Memorial Stadium (1950), RFK was one of the first to employ what became known as the circular &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; design.

It is owned and operated by Events DC, the successor agency to the DC Armory Board, a quasi-public organization affiliated with the city government, under a lease that runs until 2038 from the National Park Service, which owns the land.

In September 2019, Events DC officials announced plans to demolish the stadium due to maintenance costs. In September 2020, the cost was estimated at $20 million. Demolition of the surrounding area began in 2023, and on May 2, 2024, it was announced that the stadium was set to be demolished. However, demolition of the stadium itself has not begun as of 2024.

A bill extending the lease by 99 years passed the House on February 28, 2024, passed the Senate on December 21, 2024, and was signed by Joe Biden on January 6, 2025. This gives the Washington Commanders an option to return to Washington, D.C. to play in a rebuilt RFK Stadium after their lease at Northwest Stadium expires in 2027.

Josh Harris, owner of the Washington Commanders, has stated that he expects the new RFK Stadium will be completed by 2030; Harris plans to have the Commanders return to the stadium as tenants following completion.

==History==
===Planning===
The idea of a stadium at this location originated in 1930 when plans were developed by the &quot;Allied Architects of Washington, in cooperation with the Fine Arts and National Capital Park and Planning Commissions and the Board of Trade.&quot; Plans were further developed in 1932 when the Roosevelt Memorial Association (RMA) proposed a National Stadium for the site and Allied Architects, a group of local architects organized in 1925 to secure large-scale projects from the government, made designs for it. A &quot;National Stadium&quot; in Washington was an idea that had been pursued since 1916, when Congressman George Hulbert of New York proposed the construction of a 50,000-seat stadium at East Potomac Park for the purpose of attracting the 1920 Olympics. It was thought that such a stadium could attract Davis Cup tennis matches, polo tournaments and the annual Army-Navy football game. A later effort by DC Director of Public Buildings and Parks Ulysses S. Grant III and Congressman Hamilton Fish of New York sought to turn the National Stadium into a 100,000-seat memorial to Theodore Roosevelt, suitable for hosting inaugurations, possibly on the National Mall or Theodore Roosevelt Island. This attracted the attention of the RMA, which suggested the East Capital location. This would allow the Lincoln Memorial, then under construction west of the Capitol, and the Roosevelt memorial to become bookend monuments to the two great Republican presidents. The effort lost steam when Congress chose not to fund the stadium in time to move the 1932 Olympics from Los Angeles.

The idea of a stadium gained support in 1938, when Senator Robert Reynolds of North Carolina pushed for the creation of a municipal outdoor stadium within the District, citing the &quot;fact that America is the only major country not possessing a stadium with facilities to accommodate the Olympic Games&quot;. The following year a model of the proposed stadium, to be located near the site of the future RFK Stadium, was presented to the public. By 1941, the National Capital Planning Commission had begun buying property for a stadium, purchasing the land between East Capitol, C, 19th and 21st NE. A few years later, on December 20, 1944, Congress created a nine-man National Memorial Stadium Commission to study the idea. They intended the stadium to be a memorial to the veterans of the World Wars. The commission wrote a report recommending that a 100,000-seat stadium be built near the site of RFK in time for the 1948 Olympics, but it failed to get funding.

Ignored in the early 1950s, a new stadium again drew interest in 1954. Congressman Charles R. Howell of New Jersey proposed legislation to build a stadium, again with hopes of attracting the Olympics. He pushed for a report, completed in 1956 by the National Capital Planning Commission entitled &quot;Preliminary Report on Sites for National Memorial Stadium&quot;, which identified the &quot;East Capitol Site&quot; to be used for the stadium. In September 1957, &quot;The District of Columbia Stadium Act&quot; was introduced and authorized a 50,000-seat stadium to be used by the Senators and Redskins at the Armory site. It was signed into law by President Eisenhower on July 29, 1958, with an estimated cost of $7.5 to $8.6 million. The lease for the stadium was signed by the D.C. Armory Board and the Department of the Interior on December 12, 1958. The stadium, the first major multisport facility built for both football and baseball, was designed by George Dahl, Ewin Engineering Associates (since 1954 part of what became Volkert, Inc.) and Osborn Engineering. Groundbreaking for the venue was in 1960 on July 8, and construction proceeded over the following 14 months. The existing venue for baseball (and football) in Washington was Griffith Stadium, about northwest.

While Redskins&#x27; owner George Preston Marshall was pleased with the stadium, Senators&#x27; owner Calvin Griffith was not. It wasn&#x27;t where he wanted it to be (he had preferred to play at a site in Washington&#x27;s Northwest Quadrant) and he&#x27;d have to pay rent and let others run the parking and concessions. The Senators&#x27; attendance figures had suffered after the arrival of the Baltimore Orioles in 1954 and Griffith then grew to prefer the less racially-defined demographics and profit potential of the Minnesota market. In 1960, when the American League granted the city of Minneapolis an expansion team, Griffith proposed that he be allowed to move his team to Minneapolis-Saint Paul and give the expansion team to Washington. Upon league approval, the team moved to Minnesota after the 1960 season and Washington fielded a &quot;new Senators&quot; team, entering the junior circuit in with the Los Angeles Angels.

===Opening===

The stadium opened in autumn 1961 as District of Columbia Stadium, often shortened to D.C. Stadium. The new venue opened for football even though construction was not completed until the following spring.

Its first official event was an NFL regular season game on October 1, ten days after the final MLB baseball game at Griffith Stadium. The Redskins lost that game to the New York Giants 24–21 before 36,767 fans, including President John F. Kennedy. This was slightly more than the attendance record at Griffith Stadium of 36,591 on October 26, 1947 (in a game vs the Bears).

At a college football game labeled the &quot;Dedication Game,&quot; the stadium was dedicated on October 7. George Washington University became the first home team to win at the stadium with a 30–6 defeat of VMI.

Its first sell-out came on November 23, 1961, for the first of what were to be annual Thanksgiving Day high-school football games between the D.C. public school champion and the D.C. Catholic school champion: Eastern defeated St. John&#x27;s 34–14.

The first Major League Baseball game was played on April 9, 1962, after two exhibition games against the Pirates had been cancelled. President John F. Kennedy threw out the ceremonial first pitch in front of 44,383 fans, who watched the Senators defeat the Detroit Tigers 4–1 and Senators shortstop Bob Johnson hit the first home run. The previous Washington baseball attendance record was 38,701 at Griffith Stadium on October 11, 1925, at the fourth game of the World Series, and was the largest ever for a professional sports event in Washington. The previous largest baseball opening day figure had been 31,728 (on April 19, 1948).

When it opened, D.C. Stadium hosted the Redskins, the Senators, and the GWU Colonials football team, all of whom had previously used Griffith Stadium: the GWU Colonials shut down their football team at the end of the 1966 season, while the Senators moved to Dallas-Fort Worth at the end of the 1971 season, and became the Texas Rangers, playing in Arlington Stadium.

=== Early years ===
In 1961, Washington Redskins owner George Preston Marshall refused to integrate his team with black players, but President Kennedy forced his hand by refusing to allow the team to play in the stadium, which was on Federal land, unless he desegregated the organization. In 1962, Marshall relented and selected Ernie Davis first overall in the 1962 draft. However, Davis refused to play for the team and was traded for Bobby Mitchell, with Marshall later signing four other black players for the season as the last NFL owner to integrate.

In 1961 and 1962, D.C. Stadium hosted the annual city title game, matching the D.C. Public Schools champion and the titleholder for the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference, played before capacity crowds on Thanksgiving Day. The November 22, 1962, game between St. John&#x27;s, a predominantly white school in Northwest D.C., and Eastern, a majority-black school just blocks from the stadium, ended in a racially motivated riot.

In 1964, the stadium emerged as an element in the Bobby Baker bribery scandal. Don B. Reynolds, a Maryland insurance businessman, made a statement in August 1964 which he claimed that Matthew McCloskey, a former Democratic National Committee chairman and Kennedy&#x27;s ambassador to Ireland, paid a $25,000 kickback through Reynolds and at the instruction of Baker to the Kennedy-Johnson campaign as payback for the stadium construction contract. Baker later went to jail for tax fraud, and the FBI investigated the awarding of the stadium contract, although McCloskey was never charged.

===Renaming the stadium===
The stadium was renamed in January 1969 for U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated in Los Angeles seven months earlier. The announcement was made by Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall on January 18, in the last days of the Johnson Administration. The dedication ceremony at the stadium was held several months later on June 7.

===Senators depart===
The Senators&#x27; final game was at RFK on Thursday night, September 30, 1971, with less than 15,000 in attendance. Rains from Hurricane Ginger threatened the event, but the game proceeded. Fan favorite Frank &quot;Hondo&quot; Howard hit a home run (RFK&#x27;s last until 2005) in the sixth inning to spark a four-run rally to tie the game; the Senators scored two more in the eighth to go up but the game was forfeited to the Yankees after unruly fans stormed the field with two outs in the top of the ninth. Subsequent efforts to bring baseball back to RFK, including an attempt to attract the San Diego Padres in , and a plan to have the nearby Baltimore Orioles play eleven home games there in 1976, all failed. The former was derailed by lease issues with the city in San Diego, and the latter was shot down by commissioner Bowie Kuhn, who had planned to expand the league with four teams (aiming for Seattle, New Orleans, Toronto and Washington that would see an 14-team NL and AL). The expansion for was later reduced to two teams to be placed in the American League with Toronto and Seattle, and the next wasn&#x27;t until (speculation for expansion had started as early as 1989 with Washington as a city in mind, but it proved fruitless). In the mid-1990s RFK was planned to be the home of the yet-to-be-named Washington team, a charter franchise of the United League (UL) which was planned to be a third major league, competing with the two existing leagues of Major League Baseball (MLB).

For much of the 1970s and 1980s, RFK was primarily known as the home of the Redskins, where they played during their three Super Bowl championship seasons. It also hosted several short-lived professional soccer teams and in 1983–1984 the Washington Federals of the USFL. In 1980, it hosted the Soccer Bowl, the championship game of the NASL.

===D.C. United moves in, Redskins move out, Nationals come and go===
Major changes to the stadium came in 1996. Following the success of hosting matches in the 1994 World Cup and 1996 Summer Olympics, RFK became home to one of the charter teams of the new Major League Soccer. On April 20, 1996, it played host to the first home match of D.C. United, a 2–1 loss to the LA Galaxy.

However, later that year the stadium hosted the Redskins&#x27; final home game in Washington, D.C. After nearly a decade of negotiating for a new stadium with Mayors Sharon Pratt Kelly and Marion Barry, abandoning them in 1992 and 1993 in search of a suburban site and then having a 1994 agreement collapse in the face of neighborhood complaints, environmental concerns and a dispute in Congress (over what some members viewed as the team&#x27;s racially insensitive name and the use of federal land for private profit), Jack Kent Cooke decided to move his team to Maryland. On December 22, 1996, the Redskins won their last game at RFK Stadium 37–10 over the Dallas Cowboys, reprising their first win there in 1961, before 56,454, the largest football crowd in stadium history. The Redskins then moved east to Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in 1997, leaving D.C. United as the stadium&#x27;s only major tenant for much of the next decade, though from 2001 to 2003 they were joined by the Washington Freedom of the short-lived Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association.

After hosting 16 exhibition games after the Senators&#x27; departure, baseball returned to RFK temporarily in 2005. That year the National League&#x27;s newly renamed Washington Nationals made it their home while a new permanent home, Nationals Park, was constructed. On April 14, 2005, before a crowd of 45,496 including President Bush and MLB Commissioner Bud Selig, the Nationals beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 5–3 victory in their first game at RFK. President George W. Bush, formerly a part-owner of the Texas Rangers (the former Senators), threw out the first pitch becoming the last president, and the first since Richard Nixon, to do so in RFK Stadium. Bush threw a ball saved by former Senators pitcher Joe Grzenda from that teams ill-fated final home game—the ball Grzenda would have pitched to Yankee second baseman Horace Clarke when fans rioted and forced the forfeit. The last MLB game at RFK, a 5–3 Nationals win over the Phillies, was played on September 23, 2007, and in 2008 the Nationals moved to their new stadium.

===The last team leaves===
In 2008, RFK was once again primarily the host of D.C. United, though it also hosted a college football bowl game, the Military Bowl, from 2008 to 2012, before it moved to in Annapolis, Maryland in 2013. On July 25, 2013, the District of Columbia and D.C. United announced a tentative deal to build a $300 million, 20,000–25,000-seat stadium at Buzzard Point. Groundbreaking on the new soccer stadium, Audi Field, occurred in February 2017, and on October 22, 2017, RFK hosted its last MLS match, a 2–1 D.C. United loss to the New York Red Bulls.

===Demolition===
On September 5, 2019, Events DC announced plans to demolish the stadium by 2021. Officials said the decision would save $2 million a year on maintenance and $1.5 million a year on utilities. One year later, they hired a contractor to oversee the demolition, which was expected to begin in 2022 and cost $20 million. In July 2022, Events DC announced that the removal of hazardous materials had begun and would &quot;take several months,&quot; and that demolition would &quot;be completed by the end of 2023.&quot; In the same month, several fires occurred inside the stadium. The District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department firefighters and emergency workers responded and extinguished them. They indicated that the fires were in &quot;below grade levels&quot;. No injuries were reported, and cause of the fires is unknown. In November 2022, a sale of stadium seats was announced ahead of the demolition, still planned for 2023. In 2023 crews had begun gutting areas of the site, though structural demolition has not begun. On May 2, 2024, the NPS announced that it had determined the stadium could be demolished with no significant impacts on the natural, cultural and human environment, meaning they could issue a permit to the District to demolish the stadium. 

On January 11, 2025, Events DC announced that structural demolition would commence in late January and that hazardous materials abatement and selective demolition of interior elements of the stadium were previously completed.
==Name==
The stadium opened in October 1961 named the District of Columbia Stadium, but the media quickly shortened that to D.C. Stadium and sometimes, in the early days, as &quot;Washington Stadium&quot;. On January 18, 1969, in the last days of the Johnson Administration, Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall announced that the stadium would be renamed Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, in Kennedy&#x27;s honor. The official renaming ceremony was held but by then many had already been referring to it as &quot;RFK Stadium&quot; or simply &quot;RFK&quot;. Coincidentally, following the death of John F. Kennedy in 1963, the Armory Board had directed that the stadium be renamed for him, but the plan faltered when a few weeks later the Philadelphia city council passed a bill renaming Philadelphia Stadium as &quot;John F. Kennedy Stadium&quot;.

Robert Kennedy was not without connection to the stadium; as attorney general in the early 1960s, his Justice Department played a role in the Redskins&#x27; racial integration. Along with Udall, Kennedy threatened to revoke the team&#x27;s lease at the federally owned stadium until it promised to sign African American players. His brother John attended the first event there and threw out the first pitch. In 2008, a nearby bridge was renamed for Ethel Kennedy, Robert Kennedy&#x27;s wife.

On April 14, 2005, just before the Nationals&#x27; home opener, the D.C. Sports and Entertainment Commission announced an agreement with the Department of Defense under which the military would pay the city about $6 million for naming rights and the right to place recruiting kiosks and signage in the stadium. In return, the stadium would be dubbed &quot;Armed Forces Field at RFK Stadium&quot;. This plan was dropped within days, however, after several prominent members of Congress questioned the use of public funds for a stadium sponsorship.

Similar proposals to sell the naming rights to the National Guard, ProFunds (a Bethesda, Maryland investment company), and Sony were formed and discarded in 2005 and 2006.

==Tenants==
===George Washington Colonials (1961–1966)===

The other team to move from Griffith to D.C. Stadium was the George Washington University Colonials college football team. The stadium was dedicated during the October 7, 1961, game against VMI, the first college football game there, which GWU won 30–6. The Colonials were forced to play their first three games on the road to allow the stadium to be completed. In the following years, because the Senators had priority, GWU waited until October (when baseball season was over) to schedule games. From 1961 to 1964 they played road games in September, and in 1965 and 1966 they played at high school stadiums in Arlington and Alexandria, Virginia.

The Colonials had no real success at D.C. Stadium. GWU was during its D.C. Stadium years and never posted a winning record. The Colonials weren&#x27;t much better at D.C. Stadium where their record was , facing off against Army twice and against a Liberty Bowl-bound West Virginia in 1964 (all losses). Perhaps their biggest win was the 1964 upset of Villanova, which came to Washington with a 6–1 record. Sophomore quarterback Garry Lyle, the school&#x27;s last NFL draftee, led the Colonials to a 

The final George Washington football game to date, and the last at D.C. Stadium, came on Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 1966, when the team lost to , 16–7.

After the season was over, GW President Dr. Lloyd H. Elliott chose to reevaluate GW&#x27;s football program. On December 19, 1966, head coach Jim Camp, conference coach of the year, resigned citing the uncertainty. The next day, a member of the Board of Trustees announced that the school would drop football. On January 19, 1967, the decision became official. GW decided to use the football program&#x27;s funding to eventually build the Charles E. Smith Center for the basketball team. Poor game attendance and the expense, estimated at $254,000 during the 1966 season, contributed to the decision. Former GW player Harry Ledford believed that most people were unwilling to drive on Friday nights to D.C. Stadium, which was perceived as an unsafe area and lacked rail transit. Maryland and Virginia were nationally competitive teams that drew potential suburban spectators away from GW.

===Washington Redskins (1961–1996)===

RFK Stadium was home to the Washington Redskins for 36 seasons, from 1961 through 1996. The football field was aligned northwest to southeast, along the first baseline.

The Redskins&#x27; first game in D.C. Stadium was its first event, a 24–21 loss to the New York Giants on October 1, 1961. The first win in the stadium came at the end of the season on December 17, over its future archrival, the struggling second-year Dallas Cowboys. The Redskins played 266 regular-season games at RFK, compiling a record, including an impressive record in the playoffs.

In its twelfth season, RFK hosted its first professional football playoff game on Christmas Eve 1972, a 16–3 Redskins&#x27; win over the Green Bay Packers. It was the city&#x27;s first postseason game in three decades, following the NFL championship game victory in 1942. The stadium hosted the NFC Championship Game five times (1972, 1982, 1983, 1987, and 1991), 2nd only to Candlestick Park, and the Redskins won them all. They are the only team to win five NFC titles at the same stadium. In the subsequent Super Bowls, Washington won three (XVII, XXII, XXVI).

The Redskins&#x27; last game at the stadium was a victory, as 56,454 saw a win over the division champion Cowboys on December 22, 1996.

===Washington Senators (1962–1971)===

The Washington Senators of the American League played at RFK Stadium from 1962 through 1971. They played their first season in 1961 at Griffith Stadium.

In its ten seasons as the Senators&#x27; home field, RFK Stadium was known as a hitters&#x27; park, aided by the stagnant heat (and humidity) of Washington summers. Slugger Frank Howard, (, ), hit a number of &quot;tape-measure&quot; home runs, a few of which landed in the center field area of the upper deck. The seats he hit with his home runs are painted white, rather than the gold of the rest of the upper deck. Howard came to the Senators from the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1965. He hit the Senators&#x27; final RFK homer, in the sixth inning on September 30, 1971. With two outs in the top of the ninth, a fan riot turned a 7–5 Senators lead over the New York Yankees into a 9–0 forfeit loss, the first in the majors in 17 years.

These Senators&#x27; only winning season came in 1969 at ; they never made the postseason. They had a home record at RFK of representing the most games, wins, and losses by any team at RFK in any sport. The stadium hosted the All-Star Game twice, in 1962 (first of two) and 1969, both won by the visiting National League. Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon all attended games there. President Johnson was scheduled to throw out the first pitch in 1968, but the opening game was delayed following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., so Vice President Hubert Humphrey got the privilege. President Nixon was to throw out the first ball at the 1969 game to celebrate baseball&#x27;s centennial, but it was postponed due to rain and so Nixon chose instead to greet the Apollo 11 astronauts. Vice President Spiro Agnew filled in.

===Washington Whips (1967–68) ===

In 1967, D.C. Stadium became the home of its first professional soccer team, the Washington Whips. They played 23 regular-season games at D.C. Stadium over 16 months, putting together a home record as well as losing an exhibition against Pelé and his standout Brazilian club Santos FC, for a total RFK record of . 20,189 fans attended the Santos exhibition, more than three times as large as a typical Whips match, making it the most heavily attended soccer game in DC history at the time. The game was heavily promoted in the local press and the Whips, who were struggling to attract fans to their regular matches, provided additional incentive through a &quot;Meet Pelé&quot; contest.

RFK served as the venue for the inaugural match of the United Soccer Association (USA), a May 26, 1967, match between the Whips and the Cleveland Stokers, won by the Stokers.

In their first season, the Whips were one of the league&#x27;s top teams and they were staffed by the Aberdeen Football Club of the Scottish Football League or the Aberdeen Dons. They finished 5–2–5, good enough to win the Eastern Division and play for the USA Championship against the Los Angeles Wolves.

The owners estimated that they needed to attract 16,000 fans per game, but they never broke 10,000 and averaged only 6,200. Towards the end of the 1967 season, the Whips resorted to organizing British Isles sporting contests such as cricket, hurling, and rugby before games in hopes of luring expatriates.

In 1968, to stay viable, they negotiated a reduction in the lease payment and reduced admission prices by one-third; among other discounts. The USA merged with the National Professional Soccer League to form the new North American Soccer League. Despite problems on and off the field, the team found itself in a battle for a playoff spot and towards the end of the season crowds swelled to as much as 14,227 in what proved to be the deciding match for the NASL Atlantic Division title. This September 7, 1968, match against the Atlanta Chiefs was the last for the Whips at D.C. Stadium. That season, the team went 15–10–7 drawing an average of 6,586 fans. After a tour of Europe, the Whips folded in October 1968.

=== Howard Bison (1970–2016) ===

No team has a longer history with RFK Stadium than the Howard Bison football team, who played there 42 times over nearly 46 years (the Detroit Tigers are 2nd by ~8 months, having played their first game there April 9, 1962, and their last on June 20, 2007). Between their first game in 1970 and last, in 2016, they earned a record, winning more games at RFK than any other college football program.

Looking to play on a bigger stage than Howard Stadium, they began scheduling games at RFK. Howard&#x27;s first RFK game was a 24–7 victory over Fisk on October 24, 1970. From 1974 to 1976, Howard played all but one of their home games at RFK and in 1977 they played half their home games there. After the 1977 season they returned to Howard Stadium, but continued to play their annual homecoming game at RFK through 1985. After the 1985 season, Howard Stadium was refurbished and renamed, and for the next 7 years, Howard played all of their home games there.

In 1992, they returned to RFK for a game against Bowie State that was marked by taunting and a game-ending scuffle. From 1993 to 1999 Howard played at least one game a year at RFK including the Greater Washington Urban League Classic, at one point called the Hampton-Howard Classic, against Hampton from 1994 to 1999. In 2000 that game moved to Giants Stadium and Howard spent more than a decade away from RFK.

Starting in 2011 and through the 2016 season, Howard played in the Nation&#x27;s Football Classic at RFK, matching up against Morehouse at first and then Hampton again. In 2017, Events DC announced that they would discontinue the Classic and thus the last Bison game at RFK Stadium was a 34–7 loss to Hampton on September 16, 2016.

===Washington Diplomats (1974–1981 and 1988–1990)===

Between 1974 and 1990, three soccer teams played at RFK under the name Washington Diplomats. In 1974, two Maryland businessmen purchased the rights to the Baltimore Bays of the semi-professional American Soccer League, moved the team to the District and renamed it the Washington Diplomats. They signed a lease calculating that an average of 12,000 spectators would allow them to break even. Despite white flight, owners thought that recent completion of the Beltway, the stadium&#x27;s 12,000 parking spaces and future completion of a Metro station would facilitate attendance. Games were scheduled for Saturday and prices were set low. The Diplomats inaugural game was on May 4 with an attendance of 10,175; Mayor Walter Washington ceremonially kicked off the game, but the Dips lost 5–1 to the defending NASL champion Philadelphia Atoms. Attendance dropped throughout the season.

In 1975, the Diplomats were informed that the recently installed natural turf at RFK would not be ready for opening day, so they scheduled their first two home games that season for W.T. Woodson High School in Fairfax, Virginia. After the games attracted more than 10,000 fans each, the Diplomats moved most of their home games to Woodson, but then moved the last five back to RFK once soccer superstar Pelé was added to the roster of the New York Cosmos. Pelé was so popular that the 1975 Cosmos-Diplomats match broke the NASL attendance record at 35,620. Even with the success of the Cosmos game, attendance declined again and before the 1976 season the Diplomats announced that they had scheduled every home game, except the one against the Cosmos, at Woodson. During the season, they moved that game to Woodson.

After averaging 5,963 at Woodson, the Diplomats decided to ramp up their marketing and move back to RFK in 1977. The team changed everything from the uniforms to the cheerleaders, but the team&#x27;s disappointing on-the-field performance hurt attendance (a ~31,000 fan game against Pelé and the Cosmos notwithstanding). In 1978, attendance continued to fall, even though the Dips made the playoffs. Success on the field during the 1978 and 1979 seasons (including a franchise-best 19 wins in &#x27;79) did not translate to ticket sales and even with a negligible amount of revenue from &quot;indoor Dips&quot; games at the D.C. Armory during the offseason, the franchise continued to lose money.

In 1980, they signed Dutch international superstar Johan Cruyff, the Pelé of the Potomac, from the Los Angeles Aztecs. Needing 20,000 fans per game to break even, they managed to attract 24,000 for the opener and a District record 53,351 for the game against the Pelé-less Cosmos (the fifth-largest soccer crowd at RFK ever), but the team failed to break-even financially. After racking up debts of $5 million, the first incarnation of the Dips folded.

Three months later, the Detroit Express announced a move to D.C. for 1981, and that they would also be the Diplomats. They had trouble attracting fans; and soon folded.

The Diplomats of the NASL, racked up an impressive record at RFK, the best winning percentage of any RFK home team, and were in the playoffs.

In 1987, a new soccer team also called the Washington Diplomats, was formed. They played at RFK, and sometimes at the RFK auxiliary field, for three seasons as part of the ASL and then the APSL. They won the ASL Championship in 1988 but often drew fewer than 1000 fans. In 1990 they finished last in the Southern Division of the APSL East, were unable to pay the rent and folded in October 1990. Over the course of 4 seasons they were at RFK, and 2–0 at the RFK auxiliary field.

===Team America (1983)===

Team America was a professional version of the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team which played like a franchise in the North American Soccer League (NASL) during the 1983 season. The team played its home games at RFK Stadium and was intended by the NASL and the United States Soccer Federation to build fan support for the league and create a cohesive and internationally competitive national team. However, the team finished in last place drawing 12,000 fans per game.

Team America played 19 games at RFK. In those games they went 5–10 in NASL matches and tied three friendlies against Watford F.C. (from the United Kingdom), FC Dinamo Minsk (from the Soviet Union), and Juventus FC (from Italy) for a final record of .

The team&#x27;s attendance averaged 19,952 through the first seven home matches, including the 50,108 who attended a match vs. Fort Lauderdale that featured a free Beach Boys concert. Losses led to declining attendance as the season wore on. Attendance averaged 13,002 for the entire 1983 season, having played only a single season.

===Washington Federals (1983–1984)===

Washington&#x27;s only USFL team, the Washington Federals, played two seasons at RFK and during that time, they had the league&#x27;s worst record each season, and, in 1984, the lowest per-game attendance. For the opening game, 38,000 fans showed up to see the return of former Redskins coach George Allen, the coach of the Chicago Blitz, in a game the Federals lost, 28–7. But attendance quickly dropped off, with as few as 7,303 showing up for a late-season game against the Boston Breakers. The team went 4–14 in 1983 and 3–15 in 1984, averaging 7,700 fans.

With six games remaining in the 1984 season, owner Berl Bernhard sold the team to Florida real estate developer Woody Weiser. In the off-season, that deal fell through. Donald Dizney bought the team, moved it to Orlando and renamed it the Renegades.

After going overall, and at RFK, the Federals ended their run with a 20–17 win over the New Orleans Breakers on June 24, 1984.

===D.C. United (1996–2017)===
D.C. United of Major League Soccer played over 400 matches at RFK Stadium from the team&#x27;s debut in 1996 until 2017, when they moved to a new stadium. During that time, RFK hosted three MLS Cup finals, including the 1997 match won by D.C. United. At RFK, they compiled a record, winning more games at RFK than any team other than the Senators.

With its new stadium, Audi Field, opening in 2018, D.C. United played its final game at RFK on October 22, 2017, completing 22 seasons at the stadium, during which the team won four league titles. At the time, RFK Stadium was the longest-used stadium in MLS and the only one left from the league&#x27;s debut season. When they shared the stadium with the Nationals from 2005 to 2007, the playing surface and the dimensions of the field that resulted from baseball use drew criticism. D.C. United&#x27;s departure left RFK with no professional sports tenant; however, after moving to Audi Field, D.C. United continued to use the outer practice fields at RFK for training and leased locker room and basement space there.

===Washington Freedom (2001–2003)===

For three seasons, RFK was home to the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association team, the Washington Freedom. On April 14, 2001, the Freedom defeated the Bay Area CyberRays 1–0 in WUSA&#x27;s inaugural match before 34,198 fans, the largest crowd in WUSA history and the largest crowd to watch a women&#x27;s professional sports event in DC history (the largest crowd for a women&#x27;s sporting event was 45,946 for the 1996 women&#x27;s Olympic soccer tournament, also at RFK). Over three years, the Freedom racked up a 15–9–6 record at RFK and finished as one of the league&#x27;s top teams. They came in 2nd in 2002 and won the league&#x27;s Founder&#x27;s Cup in 2003. They played all of their home games at RFK, except for one in 2001 at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis to avoid the Washington Grand Prix. Their last game at RFK as part of WUSA was on August 2, 2003, when they defeated the San Jose Cyber Rays. They won the final Founder&#x27;s Cup in August 2003 and returned to RFK a few days later – minus the players who were playing in the 2003 Women&#x27;s World Cup – for a victory celebration with the fans, which would be their final WUSA event at RFK. WUSA suspended operation the next month. Their victory in the Founders Cup means that the Freedom won both the first and last games in WUSA history. For a time, their championship banner hung in RFK, but when the Nationals moved in, the banner was moved to the Maryland Soccerplex.

The Freedom continued, first as an exhibition team called the Washington Freedom Soccer Club, and then as a member of the W-League and the Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer league in 2006. Their home stadium was the Maryland Soccerplex, but they continued to play a few games at RFK. In 2004 they played an exhibition against Nottingham Forest, which they won 8–0. They returned on June 22, 2008, in a W-League match, which they won 5–0, against the Richmond Kickers Destiny that was part of a doubleheader with DC United. In 2009, the Freedom moved to the WPS and while they continued to play most of their home games in Maryland, they played 3 of 10 home games at RFK in 2009 and one game there in 2010. In the years after WUSA suspended operations, the Freedom went 5–0–1 at RFK, bringing their combined RFK total to . After the 2010 season, the Freedom&#x27;s owners had had enough and sold the team to Dan Borislow, owner of the phone service MagicJack. He moved them to Boca Raton, Florida for the team&#x27;s last season. The Freedom&#x27;s final game at RFK was a 3–1 victory over Saint Louis Athletica on May 1, 2010.

===Washington Nationals (2005–2007)===

After playing as the Montreal Expos from 1969 to 2004, the Expos franchise moved to Washington, D.C., to become the Washington Nationals for the 2005 season. The Nationals played their first three seasons (2005–2007) at RFK, then moved to Nationals Park in 2008. While the Nationals played at RFK, it was the fourth-oldest active stadium in the majors, behind Fenway Park, Wrigley Field and Yankee Stadium.

During the Nationals&#x27; three seasons there, RFK then became known as a pitchers&#x27; park. While Frank Howard hit at least 44 home runs for three straight seasons at RFK for the second Washington Senators franchise from 1968 through 1970, the 2005 Nationals had only one hitter with more than 15 home runs, José Guillén with 24. However, in his lone season with the team in 2006, Alfonso Soriano hit 46 home runs.

During their three seasons at RFK, the Nationals failed to make the playoffs or post a winning record. They went 41–40 at home in 2005 and 2006 and 40–41 in 2007 to finish with a record at RFK.

==Design==
The stadium&#x27;s design was circular, attempting to facilitate both football and baseball. It was the first to use the so-called &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; concept, an approach also used in Philadelphia, New York, Houston, Atlanta, St. Louis, San Diego, Cincinnati, Oakland, and Pittsburgh.

While the perimeter of the stadium is circular, the front edge of the upper and lower decks form a &quot;V&quot; shape in deference to the baseball configuration. The rows of seating in the upper and lower decks follow the &quot;V&quot; layout, and the discrepancy between the shapes of the inner and outer rings permits more rows of seats to be inserted along the foul lines than at home plate and in the outfield. As a result, the height of the outside wall rises and falls in waves, and this is echoed in the roof, resulting in a &quot;butterfly&quot; appearance when seen at ground level from the west. This feature is unique among the circular stadiums of the 1960s, and it was reused by the Kingdome and Tropicana Field for their seating layouts.

The upper deck is cantilevered so that there are no columns from the lower deck obstructing views there. Such a design is less compatible with the later demand for luxury boxes, due to weight; in contrast, Northwest Stadium has columns that obstruct views. The design at RFK allowed the upper deck to shake when fans stomped in unison.

In 1961, the stadium represented a new level of luxury. It offered 50,000 seats, each wide (at a time when the typical seat was only ), air-conditioned locker rooms and a lounge for player&#x27;s wives. It had a machine-operated tarpaulin to cover the field, yard-wide aisles, and ramps that made it possible to empty the stadium in just 15 minutes. The ticket office was connected to the ticket windows by pneumatic tubes. The press boxes could be enclosed and expanded for big events. The stadium had a holding cell for drunks and brawlers. It had 12,000 parking spaces and was served by 300 buses. It had lighting that was twice as bright as Griffith Stadium.

It was not ideal for either sport, due to the different geometries of the playing fields. As the playing field dimensions for football and baseball vary greatly, seating had to accommodate the larger playing surface. This would prove to be the case at nearly every multi-purpose/cookie-cutter stadium.

As a baseball park, RFK was a target of scorn from baseball purists, largely because it was one of the few stadiums with no lower-deck seats in the outfield. The only outfield seats were in the upper deck, above a high wall. According to &quot;Sporting News&quot; publications in the 1960s, over 27,000 seats—roughly 60% of the listed capacity of 45,000 for baseball—were in the upper tier or mezzanine levels. The lower-to-upper proportion improved for the Redskins with end-zone seats. The first ten rows of the football configuration were nearly at the field level, making it difficult to see over the players. The baseball diamond was aligned due east (home plate to center field), and the football field ran along the first baseline (northwest to southeast).

A complex conversion was necessary, at a cost of $40,000 each time, to change the stadium from a football configuration to baseball and back again; in its final form, this included rolling the third-base lower-level seats into the outfield along a buried rail, dropping the hydraulic pitcher&#x27;s mound into the ground, and laying sod over the infield dirt. Later facilities were designed so the seating configuration could be changed more quickly and at a lower cost. The conversion was required several times per year during the Senators&#x27; joint tenancy with the Redskins (1962–71) but became much more frequent during the Nationals/D.C. United era; in 2005, the conversion was made over twenty times.

Originally the seats located behind the stadium&#x27;s third-base dugout were removed for baseball games and put back in place when the stadium was converted to the football (and later soccer) configuration. When these sections were in place, RFK seated approximately 56,000. With the Nationals&#x27; arrival in 2005, this particular segment of the stands was permanently removed to facilitate the switch between the baseball and soccer configurations. These seats were not restored following the Nationals&#x27; move to Nationals Park, leaving the stadium&#x27;s seating capacity at approximately 46,000. The majority of the upper-deck seats normally were not made available for D.C. United matches, so the stadium&#x27;s reduced capacity normally was not problematic for the club.
During the years when the stadium was without baseball (1972–2004), the rotating seats remained in the football configuration. If an exhibition baseball game was scheduled, the left-field wall was only from home plate, and a large screen was erected in left field for some games.
Some of RFK&#x27;s quirks endear the venue to fans and players. The large rolling bleacher section is less stable than other seating, allowing fans to jump in rhythm to cause the whole area to bounce. Also, despite its small size (it never seated more than 58,000), because of the stadium&#x27;s design and the proximity of the fans to the field when configured for football, the stadium was extremely loud when the usual sell-out Redskins crowds became vocal. Legend has it that Redskins head coach George Allen would order a large rolling door in the side of the stadium to be opened when visiting teams were attempting field goals at critical moments in games so that a swirling wind from off the Potomac and Anacostia rivers might interfere with the flight of the kicked ball.

Since the stadium is on a direct sightline with the Washington Monument and the U.S. Capitol, light towers were not allowed; instead, arc lights were placed on its curved, dipping roof.

Events D.C.—the city agency which operates RFK Stadium—began a strategic planning process in November 2013 to study options for the future of the stadium, its campus and the nonmilitary portions of the adjacent D.C. Armory. Events D.C. said one option to be studied was demolition within a decade, while another would be the status quo. The strategic planning process also included the design and development of options. The agency said that RFK Stadium has generated $4 million to $5 million a year in revenues since 1997, which did not cover operating expenses. In August 2014, Events D.C. chose the consulting firm of Brailsford &amp; Dunlavey to create the master plan.

===Seating capacity===



===Dimensions===

The dimensions of the baseball field were down the foul lines, to the power alleys and to center field during the Senators&#x27; time. The official distances when the Nationals arrived were identical, except for two additional feet to center field. After complaints from Nationals hitters it was discovered in July 2005 that the fence had actually been put in place incorrectly, and it was to the power alleys in left; to the right-field power alley; and to center field. The section of wall containing the sign was moved closer to the foul lines to more accurately represent the distance shown on the signs but no changes were made to the actual dimensions.

The approximate elevation of the playing field is above sea level.

==Sports events==

===Baseball===
Two major league teams called RFK home, the Senators (1962–71) and the Nationals (2005–07). In between, the stadium hosted an assortment of exhibition games, old-timer games, and at least one college baseball exhibition game. In addition, from 1988 to 1991 the RFK auxiliary field served as the home stadium of the George Washington Colonials college baseball team, and hosted some Howard University and Interhigh League and D.C. Interscholastic Athletic Association championship baseball games.

* April 9, 1962: The Washington Senators defeated the Detroit Tigers 4–1 in the first baseball game played at D.C. Stadium. President John F. Kennedy – the brother of the stadium&#x27;s future namesake, then-United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy – threw out the ceremonial first pitch.
* July 10, 1962: With 45,480 in attendance, D.C. Stadium hosted its first All-Star Game, the first of two during the season. President Kennedy threw out the first pitch and the National League won 3–1.
* June 12, 1967: The Senators defeated the Chicago White Sox 6–5 in the longest night game to date in major league history. The 22-inning game lasted 6 hours and 38 minutes and ended at 2:43 a.m. EDT.
* April 7, 1969: With President Richard Nixon and about 45,000 on hand on Monday afternoon, rookie manager Ted Williams made his debut with the Senators, an 8–4 loss to the New York Yankees.
* June 7, 1969: The stadium was renamed for Robert Kennedy on January 18; while the Senators were away at Minnesota, the rededication ceremony 
* July 23, 1969: The stadium hosted its second and last All-Star Game, a National League 9–3 victory before 45,259. Postponed by a rainout the night before, the game was on Wednesday the final MLB All-Star Game to conclude during daylight. President Nixon was scheduled to throw out the first pitch the evening before; because of the postponement, he missed the game to personally greet the returning Apollo 11 crew aboard the USS &quot;Hornet&quot;. Vice President Spiro Agnew threw out the first pitch.
* September 30, 1971: In the Senators&#x27; final game (on a Thursday night), they led the New York Yankees 7–5 with two outs in the top of the ninth. After an obese teenager ran onto the field, picked up first base, and ran off, fans stormed the field and tore up bases, grass patches, and anything else for souvenirs. Washington forfeited the game, the first forfeit in the majors in seventeen years. It was the last MLB home game at RFK until 2005.
* July 19, 1982: At the first Cracker Jack Old Timers Baseball Classic exhibition game, attended by nearly thirty thousand, 75-year-old Hall of Famer Luke Appling hit a home run against the National League&#x27;s Although he had a .310 lifetime batting average, Appling only hit 45 home runs in 20 seasons. However, because the stadium had not been fully reconfigured, it was just to the left-field foul pole, far shorter than normal, and Spahn applauded him as he rounded the bases. Five more Cracker Jack All Star games were hosted at RFK, until summer construction at RFK in 1988 moved it north to Buffalo. During that time, Hall of Famers and stars such as Joe Dimaggio, Bob Feller, Stan Musial, Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Sandy Koufax, Roger Maris, Whitey Ford, and Washington favorite Frank Howard would take the field. There was even a conversation about allowing then-Vice President George H. W. Bush, who&#x27;d captained Yale&#x27;s College World Series team, to play one year.
* April 5, 1987: RFK Stadium hosted an exhibition game between the Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Mets, the first MLB game played in Washington, D.C., since a pair of exhibition games in . The game was a sell-out, with 45,614 tickets sold, and a crowd of 38,437 actually attended on a cold, rainy afternoon. Mets pitcher Sid Fernandez threw a one-hitter, and the Mets won, 1–0.
* April 3, 1988: The Mets and Orioles met at RFK for an exhibition game watched by 36,123 as the Mets won 10–7 off a three-run homer by Darryl Strawberry.

The Stadium was in its baseball configuration for the first time since September 30, 1971. 43,624 watched the Orioles lose the 2nd game 6–5, and Vice President Dan Quayle threw out the first pitch.
* April 4–5, 1992: The Red Sox and Orioles met at RFK for an exhibition game watched by 20,551 as the Sox won 4–3. The next day the Red Sox played the Phllies at RFK in a game watched by 16,823.
* April 3, 1998: The Orioles and Mets met for an exhibition game.
* April 2 and 4, 1999: Montreal Expos and St. Louis Cardinals met in a pair of exhibition games. The stadium was restored to its full baseball configuration for the first time since the 1991 exhibition. Rumors already swirled then that the Expos could soon call RFK home, a possibility that came to pass after the 2004 season.
* April 3, 2005: The Washington Nationals (formerly the Montreal Expos) lost to the Mets 4–3 in an exhibition game before a paid crowd of 25,453 in their first game in Washington. It was the first MLB home game at RFK since 1971. Mayor Anthony Williams threw out the first pitch.
* April 14, 2005: The Washington Nationals defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 5–3 before a crowd of 45,596 in their first regular season game in President George W. Bush threw out the first pitch, and Washington swept the three-game series to improve It is the largest baseball crowd at RFK ever, and the largest-ever home crowd for the Nationals. 
* June 18, 2006: Nationals third baseman Ryan Zimmerman, who became known as &quot;Mr. Walk-Off&quot; for his penchant for hitting game-ending home runs, hit his first walk-off home run off New York Yankees pitcher Chien-Ming Wang in the bottom of the ninth inning for a 3–2 Nats victory.
* September 16, 2006: The Nationals&#x27; Alfonso Soriano stole second base in the first inning against the Milwaukee Brewers and became the fourth player to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in a season.
* September 23, 2007: The Nationals defeated the Philadelphia Phillies before 40,519 in the final major league game (and final baseball game) played at RFK Stadium. The win gave the Nationals an overall home record of in three seasons at the stadium.

===Football===

RFK was the home of two professional football teams, two college football teams, a bowl game and more than one college all-star game. It hosted neutral-site college football games, various HBCU games, and high school regular season and championship games.

====Professional football====
* November 27, 1966: The Washington Redskins beat the New York Giants 72–41. The 113 combined points are the most ever scored in an NFL game.
* December 14, 1969: The Redskins defeat the New Orleans Saints 17–14 in what would be Vince Lombardi&#x27;s last victory. The Redskins would lose the next week at Dallas, and Lombardi would die just before the start of the 1970 season.

===Soccer===


Although not designed for soccer, RFK Stadium, starting in the mid-1970s, became a center of American soccer, rivaled only by the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, in terms of its history as a soccer venue. It is the only facility in the world to have hosted the FIFA World Cup (in 1994), the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup (in 2003), Olympic group stages for men and women (in 1996), the MLS Cup (in 1997, 2000, and 2007), the North American Soccer League&#x27;s Soccer Bowl (in 1980) and CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup matches (in 1988 and 1998). The United States men&#x27;s national soccer team played more of its matches at RFK stadium than at any other site, and D.C. United played 347 regular-season matches there.

Winners are listed first.

===Motorsports===

On July 21, 2002, the Grand Prix of Washington, D.C., was run over a temporary circuit laid out in the RFK stadium parking lot. The 140-lap race was the American Le Mans Series&#x27; first event in the District of Columbia, and the city&#x27;s first major motor sports event in 80 years.

Before the race, residents living near the stadium expressed concerns about traffic, parking, and the noise the lengthy event would create. Two months before the race, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that District officials had ignored laws and regulations requiring an environmental impact assessment for the race, and that Le Mans officials had lied to the city about noise levels. After the race, American Le Mans officials reneged on a promise to remove the Jersey barriers outlining the racecourse, leaving the unsightly structures in the parking lots for removal at the city&#x27;s expense. When the American Le Mans organization tried to hold a second race at RFK in 2003, outraged residents forced D.C. officials to cancel the city&#x27;s 10-year lease with the company. No more races were ever held.

The venue saw a return to racing in the 2014 Global Rallycross Championship. Much like most of the circuits for GRC at the time, the track was a temporary circuit laid out across the stadium&#x27;s parking lot. Patrik Sandell won the first race, and the event returned for 2 more years.

With the reconfiguration of the stadium, it was replaced by a series of dark-green banners over the center-field and right-field fences in order to make room for out-of-town scoreboards and advertising signage. There are 15 separate panels honoring 82 figures. Nationals Park also hosts a smaller version of the display.
* Panel 1 (furthest to the left when viewed from home plate, names read there from left to right are listed from top of display to bottom): Redskins football players Cliff Battles, Charley Taylor, Bobby Mitchell, Chris Hanburger, Jerry Smith, Len Hauss, Sammy Baugh and Pat Fischer.
* Panel 2: Redskins Brig Owens, Larry Brown, Sonny Jurgensen, team founder-owner George Marshall, Vince Lombardi (who coached them for one season before his death), Dave Butz, Art Monk and Dick James.
* Panel 3: Redskins Vince Promuto, Russ Grimm, Joe Jacoby, Mark Moseley, Doug Williams, John Riggins, coach George Allen and Ken Houston.
* Panel 4: Redskins Joe Theismann, Billy Kilmer, Wayne Millner, Sam Huff, Gene Brito, Eddie LeBaron, Charlie Justice and Bill Dudley.
* Panel 5: Edward Bennett Williams, Arthur &quot;Dutch&quot; Bergman and Jack Kent Cooke. Williams and Cooke were Redskins owners. Bergman coached in D.C. at The Catholic University of America, and then ran the corporation that lobbied for the building of RFK Stadium.
* Panel 6: &quot;New Senators&quot; manager Gil Hodges, &quot;Old Senators&quot; player and manager Joe Cronin, New Senator Frank Howard, Old Senator owner Clark Griffith, and Old Senators Goose Goslin and George Case.
* Panel 7: Josh Gibson, Bucky Harris, Walter Johnson, Chuck Hinton, Eddie Yost and George Selkirk. Gibson played for the Homestead Grays of the Negro leagues. Harris, Johnson and Yost played for the Old Senators. Harris also managed the Old Senators. Hinton played for the New Senators. Selkirk, who played for the Yankees, was the general manager of the New Senators.
* Panel 8: &quot;Old Senators&quot; Mickey Vernon, Roy Sievers, Cecil Travis, Early Wynn, Joe Judge, Harmon Killebrew, Ossie Bluege and Grays star Walter &quot;Buck&quot; Leonard. Vernon also managed the New Senators.

Auerbach played in D.C. for George Washington University and coached the Capitols. Pollin owned the Baltimore Bullets and moved them to Washington, where they became the &quot;Capital Bullets&quot;, &quot;Washington Bullets&quot; and now the &quot;Washington Wizards.&quot; He also founded the NHL&#x27;s Washington Capitals and built two area arenas: The now-extinct Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland, and the MCI Center (now the Capital One Arena) in downtown Washington. Ferry played for the Bullets in Baltimore and was their general manager in Washington. Chenier, Unseld and Hayes played for the Bullets in both cities. Unseld later coached them.
* Panel 10: Olympic swimming gold medalist Melissa Belote, broadcaster Jim Gibbons, and golf figures Lee Elder and Deane Beman.

* Panel 14: &quot;Heroes of September 11th.&quot;

To the right of Panel 15 were four banners honoring D.C. United&#x27;s MLS Cup wins: 1996, 1997, 1999 and 2004. To the right of these banners was D.C. United&#x27;s &quot;Tradition of Excellence&quot; banner, which honors John Harkes and Marco Etcheverry. To the left of those banners were four banners honoring D.C. United&#x27;s MLS Supporters Shield wins: 1997, 1999, 2006 and 2007. Those moved to Audi Field with D.C. United.

<text>The State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs ( / ; ) was a political entity that was constituted in October 1918, at the end of World War I, by Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (Prečani) residing in what were the southernmost parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Although internationally unrecognised, this was the first incarnation of a Yugoslav state founded on the Pan-Slavic ideology. Thirty-three days after it was proclaimed, the state joined the Kingdom of Serbia to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

== Name ==
The state&#x27;s name derives from the three main South Slavic ethnic groups that inhabited it: the Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs.

The Croats identified in the name were those residing in the preceding kingdoms of Croatia-Slavonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Dalmatia (including Boka Kotorska).

The Serbs identified in the name were those residing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia-Slavonia, Dalmatia (including Boka Kotorska and Montenegrin Littoral), not those residing in the Kingdom of Serbia (which included the territory of the present-day North Macedonia), nor those living in the Kingdom of Montenegro or Vojvodina (including Banat, Bačka, Baranya).

The Slovenes identified in the name were the residents of the Duchy of Carniola, Duchy of Styria, Duchy of Carinthia and Prekmurje.

== Creation ==
=== Background ===
In 1918, the final year of the War, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was suffering from an internal crisis accompanied by unrest amongst the multiple Slavic peoples within its borders. The South Slavic peoples were divided between various subdivisions of the monarchy:
* Cisleithania: The Austrian Littoral, Duchy of Carniola and the Kingdom of Dalmatia were under Austrian jurisdiction. The neighbouring duchies of Styria and the Carinthia also included a significant South Slavic population.
* Transleithania: The Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia and Fiume (corpus separatum) were under Hungarian jurisdiction. The Kingdom of Hungary itself included a significant South Slavic populations in Prekmurje, Međimurje, Baranja and territories that had been part of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar.
* The Austro-Hungarian Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Activities of the pro-Yugoslav forces in the Transleithanian Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia on 30 May 1917 resulted in adoption of the May Declaration by the Yugoslav Club, a group of Croatian and Slovene deputies in the &quot;Reichsrat&quot; (the legislature of Cisleithania in Vienna). The Declaration sought the unification of all the lands in the Habsburg monarchy populated by Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs in one independent entity.

On 2–3 March 1918, a grass-roots meeting was held in Zagreb that included representatives of various aspects of public life as well as members of several political parties, primarily the Mile Starčević faction of the Party of Rights led by Ante Pavelić and the Slovene People&#x27;s Party. The ruling Croat-Serb Coalition and its opposition the Croatian People&#x27;s Peasant Party, however, were excluded. The meeting produced the Zagreb Resolution that proclaimed the unity of the people of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (a &quot;unified nation&quot; with the latter described as equal &quot;tribes&quot; whose peculiar historical positions and desires are to be accommodated), demanded a right of self-determination and possession of the territory they occupied, including the whole of Cisleithania.

In July and August 1918, the so-called &quot;People&#x27;s organizations of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs&quot; were formed in Split (for Dalmatia), Sušak (for the Croatian Littoral) and Ljubljana (for the Slovene lands) to advance these policies. In late August, the Croatia-Slavonia parties met again in Zagreb to discuss how to proceed and, in particular, how to gain the support of the Croat-Serb Coalition.

On 14 September 1918, Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Stephan Burián von Rajecz issued a statement advocating a settlement of World War I by peace treaty and it became apparent that the war was coming to an end. By early October, the Slovene-Croat-Serb movement were planning to set up a National Assembly. Svetozar Pribićević, the leader of the Croat-Serb Coalition, confronted Srđan Budisavljević, one of the leaders of this movement, in an effort to determine whether these plans were meant to undermine the Coalition, and the two reached an understanding whereby the Coalition would be invited to join any future National Council before a National Assembly was formed. At the same time, the organizers obtained support from the Croatian People&#x27;s Peasant Party and the Serb People&#x27;s Radical Party. On 5 and 6 October, a provisional assembly was convened and the formation of executive committees begun. Seats were apportioned to members of all parties, but not without acrimony over the &quot;ad hoc&quot; nature of the proceedings.

=== Establishment ===

The People&#x27;s Council (, ) was established on 5–8 October 1918 in Zagreb, pursuant to the decisions reached in March 1918. The Council declared itself a political representative body of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs living in Croatia-Slavonia, Fiume, Dalmatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Istria, Trieste, Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Styria, Carinthia, Bačka, Banat, Baranya, Međimurje and elsewhere in southwest Hungary. The Council established its own Central Committee and Presidency, while one member of the Council was to be representative of a 100,000 people. In addition, it comprised five representatives of Croatian Sabor, the Diet of Bosnia and Reichsrat for a total of 95 representatives. 32 voting members were required to form the quorum, and two-thirds majority was needed for any decisions. Members of regional parliaments were allowed to attend as non-voting observers. The Council elected up to 30 Central Committee members, who could appoint a further 10 to the committee by a two-thirds vote.

The Kingdom of Hungary signed a truce with the Allies on 13 October 1918. Pavelić and others started negotiating with the Serbian envoy to the National Assembly Dušan T. Simović as soon as Simović had said that their military victory and the treaty with Hungary gave them right to most of the territory of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, whereas Pavelić said that they want unification with Serbia, but that they needed a federal state as well as a delineation of Croatian and Serbian population that would assume a population transfer. Simović rejected the talk of federalization and Pavelić yielded, and there was no further discussion on either issue.

On 14 October 1918, Austrian foreign minister Burián asked for an armistice based on the &quot;Fourteen Points&quot; outlined in January 1918 by American president Woodrow Wilson, whose Point 10 read: &quot;The people of Austria-Hungary, whose place among the nations we wish to see safeguarded and assured, should be accorded the freest opportunity to autonomous development.&quot; Two days later, Emperor Karl issued a proclamation (&quot;Imperial Manifesto of 16 October 1918&quot;), which envisaged a significant modification the structure of the Empire by granting wide autonomy to its peoples, including federalization of Cisleithania. Karl&#x27;s proposal was rejected on 18 October by U.S. Secretary of State Robert Lansing who said autonomy for the nationalities was no longer enough. On 19 October, the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs declared itself the supreme representative body of all South-Slavic peoples in the monarchy.

On 21 and 22 October, members of the Pure Party of Rights who still advocated a trialist monarchy secured formal support for a trialist manifesto from Emperor Karl and Prime Minister Sándor Wekerle in Hungary, but the latter was deposed the next day.

Numerous mass rallies were held in Zagreb in support the Yugoslav cause, especially on 22 October. 
On 28 October, Gyula Andrássy the Younger sent a peace note to the American government while the Ban of Croatia, Antun Mihalović, reported to the Emperor and was dismissed with the instruction &quot;Do as you please&quot;. The Ministry of War had also decided to allow the local military commands to approach the people&#x27;s councils in order to help maintain law and order. All this was taken as a sign that the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was disintegrating and that the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs was an attainable goal.

The state was proclaimed officially on 29 October 1918. Its first president was a Slovene, Anton Korošec. The two vice presidents were a Serb, Svetozar Pribićević, and a Croat, Ante Pavelić.

The new state aspired to include all those territories of the former Austria-Hungary that were inhabited by Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. Those representing the Serbs in Vojvodina, howeverincluding those in Banat, Bačka and Baranjaobjected and formed their own administration under the supreme authority of the Serbian National Board in Novi Sad. Vojvodina then joined the Kingdom of Serbia on 25 November 1918. One day earlier, on 24 November 1918, the region of Syrmia, which had become part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, seceded and also joined the Kingdom of Serbia.

== Conflict with Italy ==

In order to avoid handing them to the Entente Powers, Emperor Karl assigned the entire Austro-Hungarian Navy, the Austro-Hungarian merchant fleet and all Austro-Hungarian harbours, arsenals and shore fortifications to the National Council. The National Council sent diplomatic notes to the Entente governments notifying them that they had taken control of these assets and were not at war. The fleet, however, was soon attacked and dismembered by the Italian navy, the Regia Marina.

Austria-Hungary reached an armistice with Italy through the Armistice of Villa Giusti signed on 4 November 1918. This agreement stipulated that Italy could occupy large parts of the territory that had been included in the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. Italian troops then occupied Istria and much of Dalmatia within the occupation of the eastern Adriatic and remained there until 1921, when the Treaty of Rapallo came into effect.

== Creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes ==


The State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs did not obtain international diplomatic recognition before it ceased to exist. In a note of 31 October, the National Council informed the governments of the United Kingdom, France, Italy and the United States that the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs was constituted in the South-Slavic areas that had been part of Austria-Hungary, and that the new state intended to form a common state with Serbia and Montenegro. The same note was sent to the government of the Kingdom of Serbia and the Yugoslav Committee in London. Serbia&#x27;s prime minister Nikola Pašić responded to the note on 8 November, recognizing the National Council in Zagreb as &quot;legal government of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes living in the territory of the Austria-Hungary&quot;, and notified the governments of the United Kingdom, France, Italy and the United States asking them to do the same.

On 23–24 November, the National Council declared &quot;unification of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs formed on the entire, contiguous South-Slavic area of the former Austria-Hungary with the Kingdom of Serbia and Montenegro into a unified State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs&quot;. 28 members of the council were appointed to implement that decision based on National Council&#x27;s adopted directions on implementation of the agreement of organization of the unified state with the government of the Kingdom of Serbia and representatives of political parties in Serbia and Montenegro. The instructions were largely ignored by the delegation members who negotiated with Regent Alexander instead.

Stjepan Radić&#x27;s Peasant Party participated in the National Council, but after it decided to merge with Serbia, they started to back off, calling the move foolish, and disputing the decision based on the fact that the Croatian Parliament never explicitly approved it.

On 1 December, Regent Alexander proclaimed unification of &quot;Serbia with lands of the independent State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs into a unified Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes&quot;. As the National Council ceased to operate, it never formally ratified the proclamation, nor did the Parliament of Serbia, which took note of the declaration on 29 December 1918.

The National Council&#x27;s final important task was to appoint representatives to the Temporary National Representation in early 1919.

<text>Field Marshal Studholme Hodgson (1708 – 20 October 1798) was a British Army officer who served during the 18th century. After serving as an Aide-de-Camp to the Duke of Cumberland at the Battle of Fontenoy during the War of the Austrian Succession and at the Battle of Culloden during the Jacobite Rebellion, he became correspondent to William Barrington, the Secretary at War, during the French and Indian War. He went on to command the British expedition which captured Belle Île in June 1761 during the Seven Years&#x27; War so enabling the British Government to use the island as a bargaining piece during the negotiations leading up to the Treaty of Paris in 1763.

==Military career==
Born the son of John Hodgson, a merchant from Carlisle, and educated at Carlisle Grammar School, Hodgson was commissioned as an ensign in the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards and lieutenant in the Army on 2 January 1728. He was promoted to captain in his regiment and lieutenant in the Army on 3 February 1741.

Hodgson was appointed Aide-de-Camp to the Duke of Cumberland in early 1745 and fought under Cumberland at the Battle of Fontenoy in May 1745 during the War of the Austrian Succession. He also fought under Cumberland at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746 during the Jacobite Rebellion. Promoted to captain in his regiment and lieutenant colonel in the Army on 18 May 1747, he became correspondent to William Barrington, the Secretary at War, in 1755 during the French and Indian War.

Hodgson raised a new regiment (later the 50th Regiment of Foot) in 1756 and served under Sir John Mordaunt, as a brigade commander, during the unsuccessful Raid on Rochefort in September 1757 during the Seven Years&#x27; War. Promoted to major-general on 15 September 1759, he became colonel of the 5th Regiment of Foot in October 1759.

Hodgson led a British raid on Belle Île, off the coast of France. After the initial British attack was repulsed a second attempt forced a beachhead. A second landing was made and, after a six-week siege, the island&#x27;s main citadel at Le Palais was stormed, consolidating British control of the island in June 1761. He was much congratulated by both the King and William Pitt, Secretary of State for the Southern Department, as this &quot;important and critical operation&quot; enabled the British Government to use Belle Île as a bargaining piece during the negotiations leading up to the Treaty of Paris in 1763. Promoted to lieutenant general on 23 March 1765, he became Governor of Fort George and Fort Augustus in September 1765.

Hodgson became colonel of the 4th Regiment of Foot in November 1768 and, having been promoted to full general on 2 April 1778, he became colonel of the 7th Dragoon Guards in June 1782 and colonel of the 11th Light Dragoons in March 1789.

Hodgson was promoted to field marshal on 30 July 1796. He died at his home in Old Burlington Street in London on 20 October 1798 and was buried at St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly on 26 October 1798.

==Family==

In July 1756 Hodgson married Catherine Howard, sister of Field Marshal Sir George Howard; they had three sons and two daughters, including John Hodgson (b. 16 March 1759).

<doc id="487567" wikidata="Q3064318" url="?curid=487567" title="Howdy Doody">
<text>Howdy Doody is an American children&#x27;s television program (with circus and Western frontier themes) that was created and produced by Victor F. Campbell and E. Roger Muir. It was broadcast on the NBC television network in the United States from December 27, 1947, until September 24, 1960. It was a pioneer of children&#x27;s programming and set the pattern for many similar shows. One of the first television series produced at NBC in Rockefeller Center, in Studio 3A, it pioneered color production in 1956 and NBC (then owned by RCA Television) used the show to promote color television sets in the late 1950s.

==Story==

Buffalo Bob Smith created Howdy Doody during his days as a radio announcer on WNBC. At that time, Howdy Doody was only a voice Smith performed on the radio. When Smith made an appearance on NBC&#x27;s television program &quot;Puppet Playhouse&quot; on December 27, 1947, the reception for the character was great enough to begin a demand for a visual character for television. Frank Paris, a puppeteer whose puppets appeared on the program, was asked to create a Howdy Doody puppet.

Bob Smith, the show&#x27;s host, was dubbed &quot;Buffalo Bob&quot; early in the show&#x27;s run (a reference to the historical American frontier character Buffalo Bill as well as to Smith&#x27;s hometown of Buffalo, New York). At first the set was supposed to be a circus tent, but it was soon changed to a western town. Smith wore cowboy garb, as did the puppet. The name of the puppet &quot;star&quot; was derived from the expression &quot;howdy doody&quot;/&quot;howdy do,&quot; a commonplace corruption of the phrase &quot;How do you do?&quot; used in the Western United States and in Britain as well (e.g. &quot;Here&#x27;s a howdy-do&quot; from &quot;The Mikado&quot;). (The straightforward use of that expression was also in the theme song&#x27;s lyrics.) Smith, who had gotten his start as a singing radio personality in Buffalo, frequently used music in the program. Cast members Lew Anderson and Robert &quot;Nick&quot; Nicholson were both experienced jazz musicians.

As both the character and TV program grew in popularity, demand for Howdy Doody-related merchandise began to surface. By 1948, toymakers and department stores had been approached with requests for Howdy Doody dolls and similar items. Macy&#x27;s department store contacted Frank Paris to ask about rights for a Howdy Doody doll. However, while Paris had created the puppet, Bob Smith owned the rights to the character. An argument ensued between the two men, Paris claiming he felt he was being cheated out of any financial benefits. After one such disagreement, Paris took the puppet and angrily left the NBC studios about four hours before the show was to air live - leaving the program with no &quot;star&quot;. It was not the first time this had happened.

With Paris&#x27;s past disappearances, impromptu excuses regarding the whereabouts of Howdy Doody had been hastily concocted. This time, an elaborate explanation was offered—that Howdy was busy with elections on the campaign trail. NBC hurriedly constructed a map of the United States, which allowed viewers, with the help of Smith, to learn where Howdy was on the road. The explanation continued that while on the campaign trail, Howdy decided to improve his appearance with some plastic surgery. This made it possible for the network to hire Disney animator Mel Shaw and his business partner Bob Allen to design (refer to U.S. Patent D156687 for a &quot;new, original, and ornamental design&quot; for the puppet) and Velma Wayne Dawson to build and operate a visual character more handsome and appealing than Paris&#x27;s original, which Bob Smith had called &quot;the ugliest puppet imaginable&quot;. Since Paris did not provide the character&#x27;s voice, Howdy&#x27;s voice remained the same after his appearance changed. The puppet remembered as the &quot;original&quot; Howdy Doody replaced Paris&#x27;s original.
===Howdy Doody===
Howdy Doody himself was a freckle-faced boy marionette with 48 freckles, one for each state of the union at the time of his creation (up until January 3, 1959, when Alaska became the 49th state), and originally was voiced by Smith. The &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; show&#x27;s various marionettes were created and built by puppeteers Dawson, Scott Brinker (the show&#x27;s prop man), and Rufus Rose throughout the show&#x27;s run. The redheaded Howdy marionette on the original show was operated with 11 strings: two heads, one mouth, one eye, two shoulders, one back, two hands and two knees. Three strings were added when the show returned—two elbows and one nose. The original marionette now resides at the Detroit Institute of Arts. There were duplicate Howdy Doody puppets, designed to be used expressly for off-the-air purposes (lighting rehearsals, personal appearances, etc.), although surviving kinescope recordings clearly show that these duplicate puppets were indeed used on the air occasionally. &quot;Double Doody&quot;, the Howdy stand-in, is in the entertainment collection at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.

Photo Doody is the near-stringless marionette that was used in personal appearances, photos, parades, and the famed NBC test pattern. He was sold by Leland&#x27;s Sports Auction House in 1997 for more than $113,000 to a private art collector, TJ Fisher.

==Characters==
===Puppet characters===
Besides Howdy Doody, the other characters in this show included:

* Heidi Doody – Introduced as a stranger who saved Buffalo Bob&#x27;s life in Africa, she was adopted as Howdy&#x27;s sister.
* Phineas T. Bluster – Resident skinflint, mayor of Doodyville and nemesis of Howdy; one of the Bluster triplets.
* Petey Bluster – Phineas&#x27;s nephew.
* Don José Bluster – The South American Bluster brother.
* Thaddeus Bluster – Another Bluster brother.
* Hector Hamhock Bluster – The British Bluster brother.
* Princess Summerfall Winterspring – Introduced as a puppet, then played by actress Judy Tyler, who afterwards appeared opposite Elvis Presley in the 1957 film &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;. After she was killed in a car accident on July 3, 1957, the character was portrayed by a marionette.
* Dilly Dally – Howdy&#x27;s naive boyhood friend.
* Inspector John J. Fadoozle – &quot;America&#x27;s No. 1 private eye&quot; whose character was revealed as the mysterious &quot;Mr. X&quot; who used the pseudonym to run against Howdy for the office of President of All the Boys and Girls of America. Children could vote by using ballots attached to the wrappers of loaves of Wonder Bread, a major sponsor of the show.
* Chief Thunderthud and Chief Featherman – Two of several Native American characters used to emphasize the show&#x27;s western theme.
* J. Cornelius Cobb – The shopkeeper (played by Nick Nicholson), who had a strong dislike for clowns.
* Sandra the Witch
* Capt. Windy Scuttlebut
* Flub-a-Dub – A hybrid of eight animals. He had a duck&#x27;s bill, a cat&#x27;s whiskers, a spaniel&#x27;s ears, a giraffe&#x27;s neck, a dachshund&#x27;s body, a seal&#x27;s flippers, a pig&#x27;s tail, and an elephant&#x27;s memory.

===Animal puppets===
The show also featured animal puppets such as:

* Hyde and Zeke – Twin bears.
* Mambo – An African elephant.
* Tizzy – A dinosaur.
* Paddle – A gnu.
* Tommy Turtle – A slow-talking turtle who is not very bright.

===Human characters===

There also were several human characters, most notably:

* Clarabell – The mute clown who communicated in mime, by honking horns on his belt, and by squirting seltzer. Originally played by Bob Keeshan, who went on to create the children&#x27;s TV character Captain Kangaroo, he was later played by Robert &quot;Nick&quot; Nicholson and finally by Lew Anderson. Clarabell did not talk because the actor would have to be paid scale, and it was a low-budget show. 
* J. Cornelius Cobb (played by &quot;Nick&quot; Nicholson concurrently with the role of Clarabell and then exclusively when Lew Anderson took over the Clarabell role)
* Sir Archibald (played by Dayton Allen) – An explorer.
* Chief Thunderthud (portrayed by Bill Le Cornec) – Head of the Ooragnak (&quot;kangaroo&quot; spelled backward) tribe of American Indians. Edward Kean originated Thunderthud&#x27;s greeting &quot;!&quot;—a nonsense word that eventually became part of the California surfer culture lexicon.
* Oil Well Willie (portrayed by Bill Le Cornec) – A bearded oil exploration driller who always came up dry. 
* Princess Summerfall Winterspring (portrayed by Judy Tyler) – As a teenager, Tyler began her career with this supporting role, which she played from 1950 to 1956. The opportunity led to Tyler breaking out to starring roles on Broadway and eventually Hollywood, where she notably co-starred with Elvis Presley in &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; before her death in an auto accident.
* Gus Gasbags (played by Ed Alberian) – A man who made animal balloons.
The characters inhabited the fictional town of Doodyville. Several characters (including Ugly Sam, the world&#x27;s worst wrestler, and Pierre the Chef) were played by comedian Dayton Allen, who would become a cast regular on NBC&#x27;s prime time &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;.

The &quot;Howdy&quot; show&#x27;s non-televised rehearsals were renowned for including considerable double-entendre dialogue between the cast members (particularly the witty Dayton Allen) and the puppet characters. Corny Cobb was played by Bobby &quot;Nick&quot; Nicholson in 1952, by puppeteer Rufus Rose in 1953 and 1954 while Nicholson assumed the role of Clarabell, and again by Nicholson from early 1955 until the end of the show.

Clarabell was first played by Bob Keeshan (who also played The Featherman). Keeshan continued in that role until December 1952, when he, Dayton Allen, puppeteer Rhoda Mann, and Bill LeCornec left the show over a salary dispute. The role of Clarabell was then taken by Nicholson, who played it for about 22 months. In January 1955, the role was turned over to Anderson, who kept it until the series ended and for all subsequent revivals and specials, while Nicholson took on the role of J. Cornelius &quot;Corny&quot; Cobb. Each of the cast members also played other roles as required.

At the end of the final episode, telecast on September 24, 1960, Clarabell broke his series-long silence to say the final words of the final broadcast: &quot;Goodbye, kids.&quot;

==Dolls==
Howdy Doody dolls and marionettes of Howdy Doody and Flub-a-dub were sold commercially. There were also two other marionettes, Don José and Hector Hamhock Bluster, brothers of Phineas T.

==Replicas of Howdy==
In addition to the original vintage puppets, puppet maker Alan Semok (at the request of Bob Smith in the early 1990s) created several precise replicas of Howdy, including—thanks to improved materials and new molding techniques—a more exact marionette replica than had ever been produced, as well as a new Photo Doody which Smith used in personal appearances until his death from cancer on July 30, 1998, at the age of 80. One of Semok&#x27;s marionette duplicates appears on a 2005 cover of &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine as part of a series recreating classic covers from the magazine&#x27;s history. The cover featured Howdy with TV host Conan O&#x27;Brien dressed as Buffalo Bob Smith. Another of the Semok duplicates resides in the International Museum and Library of the Conjuring Arts, the private museum owned by illusionist David Copperfield.

==Custody battle==
After Bob Smith&#x27;s death, a fierce legal and custody battle for the original Howdy Doody puppet erupted among his heirs, the Rufus Rose estate, and a museum to which the marionette had been bequeathed. Howdy was in the news once again, with his face and story making headline broadcast, wire, talk show and print news around the world. For a while during the tug-of-war fight, the puppet was held in a bank safe deposit box while the saga played out in the federal courts.

During one day of deposition, puppet maker Semok (who had performed various maintenance and repainting of the original Howdy marionette beginning in 1989) was called upon to unseal a trap door on the back of the puppet&#x27;s head; Velma Dawson, the puppet&#x27;s original builder, who was 88 at the time of the deposition, was present and given the opportunity to examine the inside of the head in an effort to verify that the puppet in question was the original she created. Despite 50 years of numerous repairs, repaints, and replaced body parts, Dawson eventually declared the head of the puppet to be the one she originally made in 1948. The Detroit Institute of Arts ultimately prevailed and has custody of the original Howdy.

==Broadcast history==
Originally an hour on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays (at 5 p.m. Eastern), the show moved to Monday - Friday, 5:30 to 6 p.m. EST in August 1948. During part of its run, it was preceded by the 15-minute &quot;The Gabby Hayes Show&quot;, hosted by veteran cowboy sidekick actor George &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes. In June 1956, it began to be shown on Saturday mornings only (10-10:30 Eastern), continuing until its final broadcast on September 24, 1960, with the last years pre-recorded on color videotape.

==Peanut gallery==
A distinctive feature was the Peanut Gallery, onstage bleachers seating about 40 children. Each show began with Buffalo Bob asking, &quot;Say kids, what time is it?&quot; and the kids yelling in unison,&quot;It&#x27;s Howdy Doody Time!&quot; The kids then sang the show&#x27;s theme song (to the tune of &quot;Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay&quot;):

:It&#x27;s Howdy Doody time,
:It&#x27;s Howdy Doody time,
:Bob Smith and Howdy, too,
:Say &quot;Howdy do&quot; to you.
:Let&#x27;s give a rousing cheer
:’Cause Howdy Doody&#x27;s here.
:It&#x27;s time to start the show
:So kids, let&#x27;s go!

It was thus one of the first television shows with audience participation as a major component.

In many of the 1949–1954 episodes released on DVD by Mill Creek Entertainment in 2008, the children also can be heard singing jingles for commercial breaks, with Buffalo Bob or Howdy leading them and the lyrics appearing on screen. Colgate toothpaste, Halo Shampoo, 3 Musketeers candy bars, Tootsie Rolls and Poll Parrot Shoes are among the products advertised this way, as well as series-long sponsor Wonder Bread.
The popularity of Howdy Doody and its Peanut Gallery led executives at United Features Syndicate to use the name &quot;Peanuts&quot; for syndication of Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Li&#x27;l Folks&quot; comic strip, reportedly to the lifelong chagrin of Schulz.

==Smith&#x27;s absence==

In September 1954, Bob Smith suffered a heart attack and was ordered to recuperate at home. NBC managed to keep the show going with guest hosts, including Gabby Hayes and New York disc jockey Ted Brown as Bison Bill, explaining to kids that Smith was vacationing at Pioneer Village. While kids generally were satisfied with the explanation, show sponsors insisted they wanted Smith himself to hawk their products. In response, NBC set up a special studio at Smith&#x27;s home so he could appear live &quot;from Pioneer Village&quot; to do commercials. During Smith&#x27;s absence from the show, Howdy was voiced by Allen Swift. Swift continued to voice the character for the remainder of the show&#x27;s run, even after Smith&#x27;s return in September 1955.

==Final episode==
The final episode, &quot;Clarabell&#x27;s Big Surprise&quot;, was broadcast September 24, 1960. The hour-long episode was mostly a fond look back at highlights of the show&#x27;s past. Meanwhile, in the midst of it all, Clarabell has what he calls a &quot;big surprise.&quot; The rest of the cast attempts to find out what it is throughout the entire show, with only Mayor Phineas T. Bluster succeeding and promising to keep it a secret. (&quot;But,&quot; he says upon leaving, &quot;it&#x27;s not gonna be easy to keep something like &quot;this&quot; a secret for long!!&quot;)

Finally, in the show&#x27;s closing moments, the surprise was disclosed through pantomime to Buffalo Bob and Howdy Doody; as it turned out, Clarabell the mute clown actually could talk. Amazed, Bob frantically told Clarabell to prove it, as this was his last chance. An ominous drum roll began as Clarabell faced the camera as it came in for an extreme closeup. His lips quivered as the drumroll continued. When it stopped, Clarabell simply said softly, &quot;Goodbye, kids.&quot; A tear could be seen in his right eye as the picture faded to black, and some children in the Peanut Gallery could faintly be heard sobbing immediately before the credits music played.

The show quietly ended with a roll of credits over an empty, darkened set as &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; was played on a Celesta, followed by an announcement that &quot;The Shari Lewis Show&quot; would be seen in its place at that time next week followed by a spot for the TV series &quot;National Velvet&quot;.

The restored color videotape of the final broadcast is available commercially.

==Merchandising and licensing==
Three Musketeers candy bars offered a promotion early in 1950 in which sending in 10 cents and one wrapper from a Three Musketeers bar obtained a Howdy Doody puppet. The show had two one-minute announcements about the promotion on consecutive weeks. The first announcement resulted in 80,000 requests; the second increased the total number of requests to 240,000. In the early 1960s, William Rosenberg founded a fast food chain, Howdy Beefburgers (later Howdy Beef n&#x27; Burger), in Massachusetts, locating many of its restaurants beside Dunkin&#x27; Donuts shops so they could share common parking lots to compete with larger chains such as McDonald&#x27;s for retail space and customer draw. Howdy Beefburgers was inspired by The Howdy Doody Show that had run on television from 1947 to 1960, and even adopted Howdy Doody as its mascot. Serving such products as hamburgers, French fries, fish sandwiches and New England clam chowder, the chain had restaurants in as many as 27 locations throughout New England before dissolving toward the end of the 1970s.
A 1955 merchandise catalog had 24 pages showcasing the range of products licensed by the show. The extensive merchandising included the aforementioned puppet, toys and clothing, plus tie-ins with cereals and other food products. Dell published a comic book from 1950 to 1956 along with Little Golden Books and Tell-a-Tale books, many written by Doody head writer Edward Kean. In addition Dell scribe John Stanley contributed scripts for the comic book. Kean also did some scripting (along with Stan Lee) of a Sunday-only Doody comic strip through United Feature Syndicate which ran from October 15, 1950, to June 21, 1953. Milt Neil and Chad Grothkopf were the initial art team through December 3, 1950, after which Grothkopf handled the art solo.

===Cartoon===
UPA was hired to do an animated cartoon (&quot;Howdy Doody and his Magic Hat&quot;), the first directorial effort of Gene Deitch and long thought lost until a print turned up at the Library of Congress in 2010. On April 15 of that year, the film was posted online.

==Home media==
On February 20, 2001, NBC Home Video licensed Image Entertainment to release four individual discs, each containing four episodes. These shows came from the latter part of the series run, from 1957 to 1960. One show from April 1, 1953, was also included.

On November 4, 2008, Mill Creek Entertainment (under license from NBCUniversal) released &quot;Howdy Doody Show: 40 Episodes 1949–1954&quot; on DVD in Region 1. The five-disc set features 40 of the best episodes from the series as selected by fans as well as the final color episode (also on the Image discs) and bonus features.

Early episodes of Howdy Doody are available in the public domain and are online for audiences to view.

==Howdy Doody&#x27;s return==

The 1970s brought a wave of nostalgia interest in an idealized representation of the 1950s, and with it films such as &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and the TV show &quot;Happy Days&quot;. An episode of &quot;Happy Days&quot; was entitled &quot;The Howdy Doody Show&quot; (number 33 of the series; original airdate February 18, 1975) during the series&#x27; second season, having a Howdy Doody storyline featuring Smith as Buffalo Bob with actor Bob Brunner as Clarabell.

===&quot;The New Howdy Doody Show&quot;===
Shortly thereafter, Nicholson-Muir Productions (owned by Nick Nicholson and E. Roger Muir) acquired from NBC the rights to produce the New Howdy Doody Show, an attempt by Buffalo Bob and most of the old cast to recreate their past fame. For this incarnation, which aired in first-run syndication, the Howdy Doody marionette had actual hair in a contemporary 1970s style and was operated by puppeteer Pady Blackwood.

New cast members included:

* Nicholson Muir (portrayed by Bill LeCornec) – The flamboyant fictional producer of the show. He is named for the production company.
* Corny Cobb (portrayed by Nick Nicholson) – He is now working as a &quot;prop man&quot; rather than a shopkeeper.
* Jackie Davis (Himself) – The band leader.
* Happy Harmony (portrayed by Marilyn Patch, then Dr. Marilyn Plavocos Arnone) – A teacher in Doodyville who fills the same role as the Princess Summerfall Winterspring character.
* Lew Anderson returned as Clarabell.

Crew members:
* Art Director – Milt Neal
* Costumer – Valerie E. Naiman

It was staged before a larger Peanut Gallery of children and their parents originating from and taped in Florida. The revived series was not as successful as its predecessor, lasting only 130 episodes; the show debuted at the start of August 1976 and was canceled six months later at the end of January 1977.

Reruns of the show later aired on Sundays on Cozi TV. Recently, Amazon Prime began offering 20 episodes online.

===&quot;It&#x27;s Howdy Doody Time: A 40-Year Celebration&quot;===
A decade later, the show celebrated its 40th anniversary with a two-hour syndicated TV special, &quot;It&#x27;s Howdy Doody Time: A 40-Year Celebration&quot;, featuring Smith, Anderson, Nicholson and LeCornec, who reprised his former role of Chief Thunderthud.

Late in life, Bob Smith befriended New York-based fan Jack Roth, who already was quite familiar with Smith&#x27;s gallery of puppet characters. Since Smith&#x27;s death in 1998, Roth usually has provided the voice for Howdy in TV appearances and live venues. Actor-puppeteer Alan Semok, who was approached by Smith to re-create the Howdy marionette, also has voiced Howdy.

==International versions==
Like the later &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, Canadian, Cuban, and Mexican spin-off shows were licensed using local casts and duplicate puppets.

===&quot;La Hora de Jaudi Dudi&quot;===
In March 1953, the Kagran Corporation, the organization which produced the original &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; for NBC, started production on &quot;La Hora de Jaudi Dudi,&quot; a daily Spanish-language version of the program filmed in Mexico City. The program aired over Canal 2 in Mexico and, beginning on April 27, CMQ-TV in Havana, Cuba. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, the series featured a freckleless Howdy puppet and a new puppet named Don Burro. While the aim was to produce a series to distribute to the entirety of Latin America, the company halted production after six months due to unforeseen production difficulties (at the time, Mexican television programming was scarce and often improvised, unlike the American-influenced Cuban market, apart from the fact that Mexican broadcasters weren&#x27;t interested in foreign production) and market considerations (until 1960, most South American countries did not have television services or supermarkets; by 1953, the only ones in the region were located in Havana and Lima, Peru). 96 half-hour episodes were filmed.

Cuban television later launched its own local version, named &quot;Club Chirikin&quot;, which lasted through 1959 or early 1960 over CMQ. It was a Monday-Saturday show produced by Stone Associates, a company formed by former Kagran president Martin Stone.

===&quot;The&quot; Canadian &quot;Howdy Doody Show&quot;===
The Canadian &quot;Howdy Doody Show&quot; was produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and first aired on November 15, 1954. The CBC built its own Doodyville in a Toronto studio, and the show was set in Canada’s north. It was more low-budget than its American counterpart, with less raucous plots and fewer villainous villains, as well as a more educational orientation.

Most of the puppet characters, including Phineas T. Bluster, the cranky mayor and chief killjoy of Doodyville, Dilly Dally, a foolish carpenter who was usually the butt of Bluster&#x27;s plots, Flub-a-dub, a beast with a duck&#x27;s head, cat&#x27;s whiskers, and the parts of several other animals, Heidi Doody, Howdy&#x27;s sister, and Howdy himself, of course, were retained from the U.S. production.

But it had some major differences from its American cousin. Other puppets included Percival, a parrot, and Mr. X, who zipped through time and space in his &quot;whatsis box,&quot; traits that British-based expatriate Sydney Newman is believed to have loved so much as to inspire him to create such a character of his own in the UK, creating what has since become the &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; holder for the longest-running science-fiction television series: &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The show had Howdy and Clarabell, but most of the human performers differed in the CBC version. There was no Buffalo Bob, for instance. The show&#x27;s host was Timber Tom, a forest ranger, played by Peter Mews.

Mews later appeared in the films &quot;The Unforeseen&quot;, &quot;Folio&quot; and &quot;First Performance&quot;. He also appeared on television in the 1954 production of &quot;Delilah&quot;, and the 1974 mini-series &quot;The National Dream&quot;. One of his most notable works was as Matthew Cuthbert in the Charlottetown Festival’s production of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, which he played for over twenty years. Peter Mews died on November 24, 1984, at the age of 63.

Clarabell was played by Alfie Scopp. Like the American Clarabell, he communicated in mime, by honking horns on his belt, and by squirting seltzer.

Scopp was born in London England in 1919, and came to Canada with his family when they immigrated to Montreal. Scopp has had a long and glorious career in both television and film. One of his most notable roles was the bookseller Avram in the 1971 film &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. He is also known for being the voice of “Charlie-in-the-Box” on the 1964 television Christmas special, &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;.

Toby Tarnow played Princess Pan of the Forest, generally referred to as Pan. Tarnow was born in Gravelbourg Saskatchewan in 1937. She started studying acting at the Lorne Green Academy of Radio Arts at the age of eight, and by the age of ten she was already performing professionally on CBC radio. In 1954, she became the first actress to play Anne in the live televised production of the musical adaptation of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;.

Following her role as Princess Pan on &quot;Howdy Doody&quot;, she had a recurring role on the CBC children’s program &quot;Mr. Dressup&quot; (the spinoff from Fred Rogers’ &quot;Misterrogers&quot;, after he took his neighborhood to Pittsburgh).  Tarnow’s wide career encompassed radio, television, film, theater, and writing.

After moving to the United States, she founded the Riverbend School of Theater Arts for the Boys and Girls Club in New Hampshire. In 2010, she was awarded the Children and Youth Theater Award by the New Hampshire Theater Awards.

Barbara Hamilton was Willow the Witch, an absent-minded white witch with a good heart. Known for her work on Canadian stage and television, she was once labelled the funniest woman in Canada.

Born in Kingston Ontario, Hamilton attended the University of Toronto before embarking on a career in theatre arts. Her first big break came with a role in &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; at Toronto&#x27;s historic Royal Alexandra Theatre. From there, she went on to perform in theatres across the country, in works that ranged from classical tragedies to modern comedies.

She originated the role of Marilla Cuthbert in both the Canadian and London West End productions of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, and was later a regular on the CBC’s &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot;, and appeared in many other roles in film and television.

Larry D. Mann played good-natured pirate Cap&#x27;n Scuttlebutt. In Canada, the Cap’n was a live character, unlike the American Cap’n, which was a puppet. Mann was also the voice of Flub-a-Dub on the show.

Mann was a character actor whose face and acting were often recognizable. Born in Toronto on December 18, 1922, Mann was a disc jockey on radio station 1050 CHUM before he began his acting career. In his four decades of performing, Mann’s many credits included &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;The Man from Uncle&quot;, &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, and &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard,&quot; to mention just a few of his TV appearances. Two of his most prominent movie roles were &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Sting&quot; (1973). Larry Mann died in Los Angeles California on January 6, 2014, at the age of 91.

Another famous person that appeared on the Canadian &quot;Howdy&quot; was the famous singer and later Broadway star Robert Goulet. He played the character Trapper Pierre.

The Canadian show had one other Princess, named Haida, who had the powers of a Medicine Man. The character was played by actress Caryl McBain. Other characters on the show included Jean Cavall as Papa La Touke and Drew Thompson as Mendel Mason.

Some sources credit James Doohan (Scotty on the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;) as being the first host of the show, playing Ranger Bill for a short time at the beginning of the series. As the story goes, after the chief forest ranger called him away to fight a forest fire in November 1954, Timber Tom, played by Peter Mews, took his place. However, in his autobiography Doohan never credits himself in the role. And the show’s first public episode was November 15, so his time on the show was probably very short-lived.

Another actress started out playing Princess Pan in 1954. That was Maxine Miller, who later went on to play Nurse Farmer in the first three seasons of &quot;Misterrogers&quot;, the previously mentioned Canadian precursor to &quot;Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood&quot; in the U.S. She has since appeared in over 120 movies and television shows.

A young William Shatner (later to go on to fame as &quot;Star Trek’s&quot; Captain Kirk). would in 1954 be featured on the show as the character Ranger Bob.

One of the shows characters was named Mr. X. Not to be confused with the American &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; character with the same name, the Canadian Mr. X would teach history to the children watching. To do so, he would travel through space and time in what he called his “Whatsis Box”.

The actors who voiced the different puppet characters on the Canadian &quot;Howdy Doody Show&quot; included Claude Rae (Howdy Doody, Phineas T. Bluster and Mr. X), Jacqueline White (Howdy Doody), Norma MacMillan (Heidi Doody), Donna Miller (Prunella Bluster and Heidi Doody), and Jack Mather (Dilly Dally, Percival Parrot, and other characters). And Larry Mann, who already had experience working with puppets with CBC’s Uncle Chichimus, was the voice of Flub-a-dub. The puppeteers who worked the strings were Hal and Renée Marquette.

In addition to the adventures of the citizens of Doodyville and the Peanut Gallery, the show also featured film presentation on nature or travel. The scripts were adapted by Cliff Braggins, who also wrote music for the show. Quentin Maclean provided organ music. The program was produced by Paddy Sampson. After nearly five years on the air, the CBC decided to cancel the show to develop children&#x27;s programming of its own. The Canadian Howdy Doody’s last broadcast was on June 26, 1959.

==Cultural references==
Woody from the film franchise &quot;Toy Story&quot; is based on Howdy Doody.

Howdy Doody made his cameo appearance in the sixteenth episode of The Simpsons’ tenth season, “&quot;Make Room for Lisa&quot;”.

In the musical &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, during the song &quot;Somewhere That&#x27;s Green&quot;, the character Audrey sings, &quot;The kids play Howdy Doody as the sun sets in the west&quot;.

&quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; drew from &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; during its successful run on CBS from 1986 to 1991.

In the 2008 film &quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot;, the character Hellboy is seen watching an episode of Howdy Doody in a flashback scene of him as a child. The show is referenced again when Hellboy encounters the titular Golden Army at the film&#x27;s climax.

In &quot;Wally&#x27;s Gang&quot;, a 1989 episode of &quot;Hard Time on Planet Earth&quot;, Control shows Jesse the &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; intro as an example of Earth&#x27;s &quot;most highly revered&quot; electronic teachers.

In the 1988 film &quot;Scrooged&quot;, Bill Murray witnesses himself as a child watching the show on Christmas Eve in the mid-1950s.

The 1990 film &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; features the Howdy Doody opening.

In the 2008 film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, Indiana Jones stumbles into a nuclear test facility where the show is playing in one of the houses. He takes cover in a refrigerator as the explosion slowly drowns out the sound of the Howdy Doody theme song.

The 1975 &quot;Chicago&quot; song &quot;Old Days&quot; (from &quot;Chicago VIII&quot;) mentions the show in the lyrics.

In episode 3 of the fourth season of the American horror anthology television series &quot;American Horror Story&quot;, subtitled Freak Show, the character Dandy flies into a rage when his mother gifts him a Howdy Doody costume for Halloween.

<text>Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll, 1st Earl of Ilay, (June 1682 – 15 April 1761) was a Scottish nobleman, politician, lawyer, businessman, and soldier. He was known as Lord Archibald Campbell from 1703 to 1706, and as the Earl of Ilay from 1706 until 1743, when he succeeded to the dukedom. He was the dominant political leader in Scotland in his day, and was involved in many civic projects.

==Early life and career==
Born at Ham House, Petersham, Surrey, he was the second son of Archibald Campbell, 10th Earl and 1st Duke of Argyll (1658–1703) and his wife Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Sir Lionel Tollemache, 3rd Baronet of Helmingham, Suffolk. He was the first cousin once removed of Lord William Campbell.

He was educated at Eton College and later at the University of Glasgow and Utrecht University, where he studied civil law. On his father being created a Duke in 1703 he joined the army, and served for a short time under the Duke of Marlborough. He was appointed Lord High Treasurer of Scotland by Queen Anne in 1705.

He supported his brother, John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll (on many topics, most notably the Act of Union), earning him the title of Earl of Ilay in 1706. Following the treaty of union he was elected as one of the sixteen Scottish peers to sit in the House of Lords.

His military career, which was less successful than his brother&#x27;s, was somewhat distinguished. He obtained the colonelcy of the newly formed 36th Regiment of Foot in 1709 (until 1710) and assisted his brother at the 1715 Battle of Sheriffmuir.

==Political power==

In 1711 he was appointed to the Privy Council. Many called him the &quot;most powerful man in Scotland&quot;, at least until the era of Henry Dundas. Prime Minister Robert Walpole gave Campbell control over the royal patronage in Scotland. That became his base of power; he used it to control the votes of the other Scottish peers in the election of 16 representative peers to the British Parliament in London. He was appointed Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland in 1721, and was afterwards entrusted with the principal management of Scottish affairs. In 1733 he was made Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland, an office which he held until his death.
Lord Ilay played a critical role in establishing The Faculty of Medicine at the University of Edinburgh in 1726.

He was one of the founders of the Royal Bank of Scotland in 1727, and acted as the bank&#x27;s first governor. His portrait has appeared on the front of all Royal Bank of Scotland banknotes, and as a watermark on the notes, since they were redesigned in 1987. The portrait is based on a painting by Allan Ramsay, in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.

He was also one of the founders of the British Linen Company, founded in 1746. He acted as the company&#x27;s first Governor until his death in 1761 and held an instrumental role in the promotion of the Linen manufacture in Scotland.

==Duke of Argyll==
He succeeded his brother to the title of Duke of Argyll in October 1743. He worked on Inveraray Castle, his brother&#x27;s estate, which was finished in the 1750s; however, he never lived in it, and he died in 1761. He is buried at Kilmun Parish Church.

He was married to Anne Whitfield about 1712, but had no legitimate male issue at his death. In his will, he left his English property to his mistress Ann (née Shireburn) Williams. His titles passed to his cousin, John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll, the son of his father&#x27;s brother John Campbell of Mamore.

The Duke established an estate at Whitton Park, Whitton in Middlesex in 1722 on land that had been enclosed some years earlier from Hounslow Heath. The Duke was an enthusiastic gardener and he imported large numbers of exotic species of plants and trees for his estate. He was nicknamed the &quot;Treemonger&quot; by Horace Walpole. On his death, many of these, including mature trees, were moved by his nephew, John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, to the Princess of Wales&#x27; new garden at Kew. This later became Kew Gardens and some of the Duke&#x27;s trees are still to be seen there to this day. The Duke of Argyll&#x27;s Tea Tree is an imported shrub named after him which has become established in hedgerows in some parts of England.

==In literature ==
In Neil Munro&#x27;s novel &quot;Doom Castle&quot; (1901), Archibald Campbell features as the 3rd Duke of Argyll and returns in &quot;The New Road&quot; (1914) as the Earl of Ilay.

<doc id="487581" wikidata="Q7408348" url="?curid=487581" title="Sam Woo Restaurant">
<text>Sam Woo Restaurant () is a restaurant chain that serves Hong Kong–style cuisine. It has many locations in predominantly overseas Chinese communities of Southern California, in Las Vegas, and in the suburbs of Toronto. &quot;Sam Woo&quot; is a romanization of the Cantonese pronunciation for &quot;triple harmonies,&quot; in reference to &quot;feng shui&quot; principles, including the synthesis of heaven, earth, and humanity. The complete Chinese name () literally means &quot;Three Harmonies Roast Meats and Noodle House.&quot;

==History==

The first delicatessen was opened in 1979 by an elderly immigrant from Hong Kong in the Los Angeles Chinatown and later spread to other locations in California, including Monterey Park and Alhambra. The first Sam Woo has since relocated to a newer building within Chinatown to include a restaurant and delicatessen.

Two other locations in the San Gabriel Valley opened only to later change hands or close. One restaurant opened in Montebello, which was renamed to &quot;A-1&quot; (now closed) when an employee purchased it from the Sam Woo owners (though the menu remains the same). In 2004 a Sam Woo also opened in the suburb of Covina, California, but it failed the following year and was replaced by a similar family-style restaurant.

There are two types of Sam Woo restaurants. The first is named Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant ().

The restaurant chain operates in suburban areas in Southern California, mostly in communities where there are many immigrants from China and Taiwan, such as San Gabriel, Rowland Heights, and Irvine. Several, but not all, Sam Woo Restaurants in Southern California are located in shopping centers anchored by 99 Ranch Market stores. The popular Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant as well as the anchor tenant 99 Ranch Market has contributed to the development of the spectacular Chinatown, Las Vegas.

Sam Woo Restaurants are generally popular even though long waits to be seated are common.

In 1992, presidential candidate Bill Clinton held a fundraiser at a now-defunct Sam Woo Seafood Restaurant in San Gabriel, California. The restaurant was highly popular for its dim sum. However, in 2003, the restaurant received some less favorable media attention when it and surrounding Chinese businesses in San Gabriel were at the center of the SARS panic. Due to an unsubstantiated internet rumor, customer patronage declined and the restaurant closed. Unlike in Hong Kong or Toronto, there was no actual verified case of SARS reported in San Gabriel or Los Angeles.

In Southern California, hoping to capitalize on the success of Sam Woo Restaurants, restaurateurs have opened imitations with similar names in English and Chinese. Examples include the long-gone Sam Doo Restaurant in San Gabriel and the current S.W. Seafood Restaurant in Irvine. In the early 1990s, a similar concept to Sam Woo Restaurant, the now-defunct Luk Yue Restaurant, also started in Los Angeles Chinatown and like Sam Woo, it expanded into the Chinese community of Monterey Park, Rowland Heights, and Cerritos. The chain has since folded while Sam Woo Restaurant remains popular in the Chinese communities of Southern California and Toronto.

<doc id="487585" wikidata="Q646944" url="?curid=487585" title="Cerebral peduncle">
<text>The cerebral peduncles (In Latin, &quot;ped-&quot; means &#x27;foot&#x27;.) are the two stalks that attach the cerebrum to the brainstem. They are structures at the front of the midbrain which arise from the ventral pons and contain the large ascending (sensory) and descending (motor) tracts that run to and from the cerebrum from the pons. Mainly, the three common areas that give rise to the cerebral peduncles are the cerebral cortex, the spinal cord and the cerebellum. The region includes the tegmentum, crus cerebri and pretectum. By this definition, the cerebral peduncles are also known as the basis pedunculi, while the large ventral bundle of efferent fibers is referred to as the cerebral crus (&quot;crus&quot; means ‘leg’ in Latin.) or the pes pedunculi (&quot;pes&quot; means &#x27;foot&#x27; in Latin.).

The cerebral peduncles are located on either side of the midbrain and are the frontmost part of the midbrain, and act as the connectors between the rest of the midbrain and the thalamic nuclei and thus the cerebrum. As a whole, the cerebral peduncles assist in refining motor movements, learning new motor skills, and converting proprioceptive information into balance and posture maintenance. 
Important fiber tracts that run through the cerebral peduncles are the corticospinal, corticopontine, and corticobulbar tracts.
Damage to the cerebral peduncles results in unrefined motor skills, imbalance, and lack of proprioception.

==Structure==
The descending upper fibers from the internal capsule continue on through the midbrain and are then seen as the fibers in the cerebral peduncles. 
The corticopontine fibers are found in the outer and inner third of the cerebral peduncle, these are the cortical input to the pontine nuclei. The corticobulbar and corticospinal fibers are found in the middle third of the cerebral peduncle. The corticospinal tract exits the internal capsule and is seen in the mid portion of the cerebral peduncles.

===Cranial nerves===
Cranial nerve III (oculomotor nerve) appears ventrally between the two cerebral peduncles in the interpeduncular fossa. Cranial nerve IV (trochlear nerve) wraps around the lowest part of the cerebral peduncle.

<doc id="487591" wikidata="Q5288063" url="?curid=487591" title="Doe v. Chao">
<text>Doe v. Chao, 540 U.S. 614 (2004), is a decision by the United States Supreme Court that interpreted the statutory damages provision of the Privacy Act of 1974.

Prior to the case, lower federal courts had split over whether plaintiffs whose rights were violated were automatically entitled to the statutory minimum damages award of $1000, or whether those plaintiffs had to prove that they had suffered at least some actual damage from the privacy breach (which would then be raised to $1000 if their actual damages were less than that).

The Court&#x27;s 6–3 decision determined that the latter interpretation was correct; as a result, it will be more difficult for a plaintiff to prevail as he or she must now prove both a violation and some damages before being entitled to recovery.

This result is generally applauded by proponents of greater freedoms for the press, as a contrary result may have made government agencies more reluctant to release information out of fear of lawsuits.

==Background of the case==
The plaintiff in the case, coal miner Buck Doe (a pseudonym), filed for benefits under the federal Black Lung Benefits Act. The Department of Labor, which ran the benefits program, required applicants to provide a Social Security number as a part of the application. The government&#x27;s practice was to use the number for identification purposes, and as a result, claimants such as Doe had their Social Security numbers displayed on various legal documents and published in case reports and online legal research databases.

Doe, along with six other black lung claimants, sued the Department of Labor for violating their rights under the Privacy Act. The government conceded that it had violated the statute. At trial, Doe testified that he suffered &quot;distress&quot; from the release of his private information. The district court awarded Doe $1000, which was the statutory minimum amount of damages that could be awarded under the statute.

The Fourth Circuit reversed. It interpreted the statute to require a plaintiff to show some actual damages before the statutory minimum damages could be awarded. Further, it found that plaintiff&#x27;s testimony about his &quot;distress&quot; was not legally sufficient to show that he had been damaged by the disclosure.

This decision conflicted with decisions of the First, Fifth, Ninth, Eleventh, and District of Columbia circuits, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve the dispute.

==Statutory language==
The statutory language at issue provided that if a government agency violated the act &quot;in a manner which was intentional or willful, the United States shall be liable to the individual in an amount equal to the sum of actual damages sustained by the individual as a result of the refusal or failure, but in no case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000.&quot;

==Supreme Court==
The Court, in an opinion written by Justice David Souter, agreed with the Fourth Circuit&#x27;s interpretation as a matter of &quot;straightforward textual analysis.&quot;

The Court supported its interpretation with an analysis of the history of the statute, which showed that Congress specifically removed language from the bill that explicitly would have awarded $1000 without proof of any damages. (Justice Antonin Scalia, an opponent of using legislative history in interpreting statutes, did not join this paragraph of the opinion).

===Dissenting opinions===
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a dissenting opinion, arguing that a &quot;sensible&quot; reading of the statutory language supported Doe&#x27;s position. She also noted that reading the statute to require some proof of actual damages would have little practical effect. She noted that it would be very easy for a plaintiff to prove actual damages in a similar case merely by purchasing a credit report following the publication of his Social Security number. This small amount of damages would then be raised to $1000 by operation of the statute.

Justice Stephen Breyer also dissented, noting that the government&#x27;s stated fear of large damage awards under a more permissive reading of the statute would likely not materialize, as courts had interpreted the statute to only permit damages where the government released private information in bad faith (as opposed to accidentally).

<doc id="487592" wikidata="Q2571194" url="?curid=487592" title="Delaware Colony">
<text>The Delaware Colony, officially known as the three Lower Counties on the Delaware, was a semiautonomous region of the proprietary Province of Pennsylvania and a &quot;de facto&quot; British colony in North America. Although not royally sanctioned, Delaware consisted of the three counties on the west bank of the Delaware River Bay. 

In the early 17th century, the area was inhabited by Lenape and possibly Assateague Native American Indian tribes. The first European settlers were Swedes, who established the colony of New Sweden at Fort Christina in present-day Wilmington, Delaware, in 1638. The Dutch captured the colony in 1655 and annexed it to New Netherland to the north. England subsequently took control of it from the Dutch in 1664. In 1682, William Penn, the Quaker proprietor of the Province of Pennsylvania to the north leased the three lower counties on the Delaware River from James, the Duke of York, who went on to become King James II. 

The three lower counties on the Delaware River were governed as part of the Province of Pennsylvania from 1682 to 1701, when the lower counties petitioned for and were granted an independent colonial legislature; the two colonies shared the same governor until 1776. The English colonists who settled in Delaware were mainly Quakers. In the first half of the 18th century, New Castle and Philadelphia became the primary ports of entry to the new world for a quarter of a million Protestant immigrants from Ulster, referred to as Scotch-Irish in America and Ulster Scots in Ireland. Delaware had no established religion at this time.

The American Revolutionary War began in April 1775, and on June 15, 1776, the Delaware Assembly voted to break all ties with Great Britain, creating the independent State of Delaware. On July 4, 1776, Delaware joined 12 other British colonies to form the United States of America.

==Dutch and Swedish settlements==
From the early Dutch settlement in 1631 to the colony&#x27;s rule by Pennsylvania in 1682, the land that later became the U.S. state of Delaware changed hands many times. Because of this, Delaware became a heterogeneous society made up of individuals who were diverse in country of origin and religion.

The first European exploration of what would become known as the Delaware Valley was made by the Dutch ship &quot;Halve Maen&quot; under the command of Henry Hudson in 1609. He was searching for what was believed to be a Northwest Passage to Asia. Hudson sailed into what now is the Delaware Bay. He named it the South River, but this would later change after Samuel Argall came across the mouth of the river in 1610, after being blown off course. Argall later renamed this waterway as the river Delaware, after Thomas West, Lord De La Warr, the second governor of Virginia. 

Follow-up expeditions by Cornelius May in 1613 and Cornelius Hendrickson in 1614 mapped the shoreline of what would become the colony and state of Delaware for inclusion in the New Netherland colony. Initial Dutch settlement was centered up the Delaware River at Fort Nassau at Big Timber Creek, south of what is now Gloucester City, New Jersey.

Neither the Dutch nor the English showed any early interest in establishing settlement on this land. It was not until 1629 that agents of the Dutch West India Company, Gillis Hossitt and Jacob Jansz, arrived to negotiate with the Native Americans to purchase land for a colony. (The Dutch always purchased land from the Native Americans, rather than take it by force, but the peoples had differing concepts of property and use. The Native Americans often considered the Dutch &quot;payments&quot; to be gifts in keeping with their Native custom, and expected to share use of the common land.) Hossitt and Jansz secured a treaty granting the Dutch a parcel of land running along the shore eight Dutch miles long and half a Dutch mile deep (roughly 29 by just under 2 US miles). This nearly coincided with the length of the coast of modern Sussex and Kent counties in Delaware.

In 1631 the Dutch sent a group of twenty-eight men to build a fort inside Cape Henlopen on Lewes Creek to establish the Zwaanendael Colony. This first colony was intended to take advantage of the large whale population in the bay and to produce whale oil. A cultural misunderstanding with the Native Americans resulted in their killing of these 28 colonists before a year had passed. Patroon David Pietersz. de Vries arrived shortly thereafter with an additional 50 settlers. Although he concluded a treaty with the Indians, de Vries, his partners in Holland, and the Dutch West India Company decided the location was too dangerous for immediate colonization. They took the additional settlers to New Amsterdam (New York) instead.

In March 1638, the Swedish colony of New Sweden was established as the first permanent European settlement in Delaware. The &quot;Kalmar Nyckel&quot; anchored at a rocky point on the Minquas Kill. Today this site is called Swedes&#x27; Landing; it is located in Wilmington, Delaware. The expedition was led, and had been instigated by Peter Minuit, the founding governor of New Netherland. He had been dismissed by the Dutch West India Company, which operated the colony as a concession. Minuit resented the company and was well aware that the Dutch had little settlement in the &quot;Zuyd&quot; (Delaware) river valley. New Sweden was a multicultural affair, with Finns, Dutch, Walloons (Belgians), and Germans, in addition to Swedes among the settlers.

The first outpost of the Swedish settlement was named Fort Christina (now Wilmington) after Queen Christina of Sweden. The Swedes introduced log cabin construction to the New World and the humble house form was later spread to the American backcountry by Scotch-Irish immigrants who entered the colony through the port of New Castle. Swedish colonial Governor Johan Björnsson Printz administered the colony of New Sweden from 1643 to 1653. He was succeeded by Johan Classon Risingh, the last governor of New Sweden. The Dutch had never accepted the Swedish colony as legitimate, and the Dutch West India Company competed with the officials and backers of New Sweden. In 1651, New Netherland Governor Peter Stuyvesant had Fort Nassau dismantled and reassembled downriver of Fort Christina as Fort Casimir. This meant that the Dutch effectively encircled the Swedish colony. The Swedes abandoned Fort Beversreede, a short-lived attempt to establish a foothold at the end of the Great Minquas Path (in modern Philadelphia). 

Three years later, the New Sweden colony attacked and seized Fort Casimir, renaming it Fort Trinity. The struggle finally came to an end in September 1655. With the Second Great Northern War raging in Europe, Stuyvesant assembled an army and naval squadron sufficient to capture the Swedish forts, thus re-establishing control of the colony. The Dutch renamed Fort Casimir/Trinity as New Amstel (later translated to New Castle). It became their center for fur trading with Native Americans and the colony&#x27;s administration headquarters. The area&#x27;s European population grew rapidly.

==English conquest==
In 1664, after English Colonel Richard Nicolls captured New Amsterdam, Robert Carr was sent to the Delaware River settlements. He took over New Amstel, pillaging it and mistreating its settlers, some of whom he sold into slavery in Virginia. Carr translated the name of the post from Dutch into English and it has been known since as New Castle. Carr and his troops continued down the shore, ravaging and burning settlements, including a Mennonite utopian community led by Pieter Corneliszoon Plockhoy near present-day Lewes, Delaware. This effectively ended the Dutch rule of the colony and, for that matter, ended their claims to any land in colonial North America. The English took over New Netherland, renaming it New York. Delaware was thenceforth claimed by New York under a Deputy of the Duke of York from 1664 to 1682, but neither the Duke nor his colonists controlled it. The proprietors of Maryland took action to take advantage of this situation.

== Durham County, Maryland ==

Between 1669 and 1672, Delaware was an incorporated county under the Province of Maryland. When the Duke of York made use of his charter on behalf of courtier William Penn, through conveyances made by the governor of New York, there was a brief conflict of interest between the Catholic, Tory, and sometime Jacobite sympathizer Lord Baltimore with his friend the aforesaid Duke. A hard-fought court battle was subsequently relegated to a proprietary dispute between the Calvert and Penn families since both were held in favor by both the King and Prince James. By 1768, the Mason-Dixon line is said to have legally resolved vague outlines in the overlap between Maryland and Pennsylvania. By this boundary, Delaware was substantially awarded to Pennsylvania. Eventually, Delaware gained its own independence from Pennsylvania and fended off Maryland.

== New Castle, Kent, and Sussex Counties, Pennsylvania ==

The area now known as Delaware was owned by William Penn, the Quaker owner of Pennsylvania. In contemporary documents from the early Revolutionary period, the area is generally referred to as &quot;The Three Lower Counties on the Delaware River&quot; (&quot;Lower Counties on Delaware&quot;) or by the names of the three counties.

After William Penn was granted the province of Pennsylvania by King Charles II in 1681, he asked for and later received the lands of Delaware from the Duke of York. Penn had a very hard time governing Delaware because the economy and geology resembled those of the Chesapeake Bay colonies more than that of Pennsylvania. The lowland areas were developed for tobacco plantations and dependent on enslaved Africans and African Americans for labor. Penn attempted to merge the governments of Pennsylvania and the lower counties of Delaware. Representatives from each area clashed strongly and, in 1701 Penn agreed to allow two assemblies to be elected and conduct their separate affairs. Delawareans would meet in New Castle, and Pennsylvanians would gather in Philadelphia. Delaware, like Philadelphia and more so than Maryland, continued to be a melting pot of sorts. It was home to Swedes, Finns, Dutch, and French, in addition to the English, who constituted the dominant culture.

<doc id="487599" wikidata="Q7269435" url="?curid=487599" title="Quasi-Monte Carlo method">
<text>In numerical analysis, the quasi-Monte Carlo method is a method for numerical integration and solving some other problems using low-discrepancy sequences (also called quasi-random sequences or sub-random sequences) to achieve variance reduction. This is in contrast to the regular Monte Carlo method or Monte Carlo integration, which are based on sequences of pseudorandom numbers.

Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo methods are stated in a similar way.
The problem is to approximate the integral of a function &quot;f&quot; as the average of the function evaluated at a set of points &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;N&quot;:

:formula_1

Since we are integrating over the &quot;s&quot;-dimensional unit cube, each &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a vector of &quot;s&quot; elements. The difference between quasi-Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo is the way the &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; are chosen. Quasi-Monte Carlo uses a low-discrepancy sequence such as the Halton sequence, the Sobol sequence, or the Faure sequence, whereas Monte Carlo uses a pseudorandom sequence. The advantage of using low-discrepancy sequences is a faster rate of convergence. Quasi-Monte Carlo has a rate of convergence close to O(1/&quot;N&quot;), whereas the rate for the Monte Carlo method is O(&quot;N&quot;−0.5).

The Quasi-Monte Carlo method recently became popular in the area of mathematical finance or computational finance. In these areas, high-dimensional numerical integrals, where the integral should be evaluated within a threshold ε, occur frequently. Hence, the Monte Carlo method and the quasi-Monte Carlo method are beneficial in these situations.

== Approximation error bounds of quasi-Monte Carlo ==
The approximation error of the quasi-Monte Carlo method is bounded by a term proportional to the discrepancy of the set &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;N&quot;. Specifically, the Koksma–Hlawka inequality states that the error

:formula_2
is bounded by 
:formula_3

where &quot;V&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) is the Hardy–Krause variation of the function &quot;f&quot; (see Morokoff and Caflisch (1995) for the detailed definitions). &quot;D&quot;&quot;N&quot; is the so-called star discrepancy of the set (&quot;x&quot;1...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;N&quot;) and is defined as

:formula_4

where &quot;Q&quot; is a rectangular solid in [0,1]&quot;s&quot; with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The inequality formula_5 can be used to show that the error of the approximation by the quasi-Monte Carlo method is formula_6, whereas the Monte Carlo method has a probabilistic error of formula_7. Thus, for sufficiently large formula_8, quasi-Monte Carlo will always outperform random Monte Carlo. However, formula_9 grows exponentially quickly with the dimension, meaning a poorly-chosen sequence can be much worse than Monte Carlo in high dimensions. In practice, it is almost always possible to select an appropriate low-discrepancy sequence, or apply an appropriate transformation to the integrand, to ensure that quasi-Monte Carlo performs at least as well as Monte Carlo (and often much better).

== Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo for multidimensional integrations ==

For one-dimensional integration, quadrature methods such as the trapezoidal rule, Simpson&#x27;s rule, or Newton–Cotes formulas are known to be efficient if the function is smooth. These approaches can be also used for multidimensional integrations by repeating the one-dimensional integrals over multiple dimensions. However, the number of function evaluations grows exponentially as &quot;s&quot;, the number of dimensions, increases. Hence, a method that can overcome this curse of dimensionality should be used for multidimensional integrations. The standard Monte Carlo method is frequently used when the quadrature methods are difficult or expensive to implement. Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo methods are accurate and relatively fast when the dimension is high, up to 300 or higher.

Morokoff and Caflisch studied the performance of Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo methods for integration. In the paper, Halton, Sobol, and Faure sequences for quasi-Monte Carlo are compared with the standard Monte Carlo method using pseudorandom sequences. They found that the Halton sequence performs best for dimensions up to around 6; the Sobol sequence performs best for higher dimensions; and the Faure sequence, while outperformed by the other two, still performs better than a pseudorandom sequence.

However, Morokoff and Caflisch gave examples where the advantage of the quasi-Monte Carlo is less than expected theoretically. Still, in the examples studied by Morokoff and Caflisch, the quasi-Monte Carlo method did yield a more accurate result than the Monte Carlo method with the same number of points. Morokoff and Caflisch remark that the advantage of the quasi-Monte Carlo method is greater if the integrand is smooth, and the number of dimensions &quot;s&quot; of the integral is small.

== Drawbacks of quasi-Monte Carlo ==
Lemieux mentioned the drawbacks of quasi-Monte Carlo:
* In order for formula_6 to be smaller than formula_11, formula_12 needs to be small and formula_13 needs to be large (e.g. formula_14). For large &quot;s&quot;, depending on the value of &quot;N&quot;, the discrepancy of a point set from a low-discrepancy generator might be not smaller than for a random set.
* For many functions arising in practice, formula_15 (e.g. if Gaussian variables are used).
* We only know an upper bound on the error (i.e., &quot;ε&quot; ≤ &quot;V&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) &quot;D&quot;&quot;N&quot;) and it is difficult to compute formula_16 and formula_17.
In order to overcome some of these difficulties, we can use a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo method.

== Randomization of quasi-Monte Carlo ==
Since the low discrepancy sequence are not random, but deterministic, quasi-Monte Carlo method can be seen as a deterministic algorithm or derandomized algorithm. In this case, we only have the bound (e.g., &quot;ε&quot; ≤ &quot;V&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) &quot;D&quot;&quot;N&quot;) for error, and the error is hard to estimate. In order to recover our ability to analyze and estimate the variance, we can randomize the method (see randomization for the general idea). The resulting method is called the randomized quasi-Monte Carlo method and can be also viewed as a variance reduction technique for the standard Monte Carlo method. Among several methods, the simplest transformation procedure is through random shifting. Let {&quot;x&quot;1...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;N&quot;} be the point set from the low discrepancy sequence. We sample &quot;s&quot;-dimensional random vector &quot;U&quot; and mix it with {&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;N&quot;}. In detail, for each &quot;x&quot;&quot;j&quot;, create

: formula_18

and use the sequence formula_19 instead of formula_20. If we have &quot;R&quot; replications for Monte Carlo, sample s-dimensional random vector U for each replication. Randomization allows to give an estimate of the variance while still using quasi-random sequences. Compared to pure quasi Monte-Carlo, the number of samples of the quasi random sequence will be divided by &quot;R&quot; for an equivalent computational cost, which reduces the theoretical convergence rate. Compared to standard Monte-Carlo, the variance and the computation speed are slightly better from the experimental results in Tuffin (2008)
