<doc id="505470" wikidata="Q337217" url="?curid=505470" title="Cooperativity">
<text>Cooperativity is a phenomenon displayed by systems involving identical or near-identical elements, which act dependently of each other, relative to a hypothetical standard non-interacting system in which the individual elements are acting independently. One manifestation of this is enzymes or receptors that have multiple binding sites where the affinity of the binding sites for a ligand is &quot;apparently&quot; increased, positive cooperativity, or decreased, negative cooperativity, upon the binding of a ligand to a binding site. For example, when an oxygen atom binds to one of hemoglobin&#x27;s four binding sites, the affinity to oxygen of the three remaining available binding sites increases; i.e. oxygen is more likely to bind to a hemoglobin bound to one oxygen than to an unbound hemoglobin. This is referred to as cooperative binding.

We also see cooperativity in large chain molecules made of many identical (or nearly identical) subunits (such as DNA, proteins, and phospholipids), when such molecules undergo phase transitions such as melting, unfolding or unwinding. This is referred to as subunit cooperativity. However, the definition of cooperativity based on apparent increase or decrease in affinity to successive ligand binding steps is problematic, as the concept of &quot;energy&quot; must always be defined relative to a standard state. When we say that the affinity is increased upon binding of one ligand, it is empirically unclear what we mean since a non-cooperative binding curve is required to rigorously define binding energy and hence also affinity. A much more general and useful definition of positive cooperativity is: A process involving multiple identical incremental steps, in which intermediate states are statistically &quot;underrepresented&quot; relative to a hypothetical standard system (null hypothesis) where the steps occur independently of each other.

Likewise, a definition of negative cooperativity would be a process involving multiple identical incremental steps, in which the intermediate states are &quot;overrepresented&quot; relative to a hypothetical standard state in which individual steps occur independently. These latter definitions for positive and negative cooperativity easily encompass all processes which we call &quot;cooperative&quot;, including conformational transitions in large molecules (such as proteins) and even psychological phenomena of large numbers of people (which can act independently of each other, or in a co-operative fashion).

==Cooperative binding==
When a substrate binds to one enzymatic subunit, the rest of the subunits are stimulated and become active. 
Ligands can either have positive cooperativity, negative cooperativity, or non-cooperativity.
An example of positive cooperativity is the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin. One oxygen molecule can bind to the ferrous iron of a heme molecule in each of the four chains of a hemoglobin molecule. Deoxy-hemoglobin has a relatively low affinity for oxygen, but when one molecule binds to a single heme, the oxygen affinity increases, allowing the second molecule to bind more easily, and the third and fourth even more easily. The oxygen affinity of 3-oxy-hemoglobin is ~300 times greater than that of deoxy-hemoglobin. This behavior leads the affinity curve of hemoglobin to be sigmoidal, rather than hyperbolic as with the monomeric myoglobin. By the same process, the ability for hemoglobin to lose oxygen increases as fewer oxygen molecules are bound. &quot;See also Oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve.

Negative cooperativity means that the opposite will be true; as ligands bind to the protein, the protein&#x27;s affinity for the ligand will decrease, i.e. it becomes less likely for the ligand to bind to the protein. An example of this occurring is the relationship between glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

Homotropic cooperativity refers to the fact that the molecule causing the cooperativity is the one that will be affected by it. Heterotropic cooperativity is where a third party substance causes the change in affinity. Homotropic or heterotropic cooperativity could be of both positives as well as negative types depend upon whether it support or oppose further binding of the ligand molecules to the enzymes.

==Subunit cooperativity==
Cooperativity is not only a phenomenon of ligand binding, but also applies anytime energetic interactions make it easier or more difficult for something to happen involving multiple units as opposed to with single units. (That is, easier or more difficult compared with what is expected when only accounting for the addition of multiple units). For example, unwinding of DNA involves cooperativity: Portions of DNA must unwind in order for DNA to carry out replication, transcription and recombination. Positive cooperativity among adjacent DNA nucleotides makes it easier to unwind a whole group of adjacent nucleotides than it is to unwind the same number of nucleotides spread out along the DNA chain. The cooperative unit size is the number of adjacent bases that tend to unwind as a single unit due to the effects of positive cooperativity. This phenomenon applies to other types of chain molecules as well, such as the folding and unfolding of proteins and in the &quot;melting&quot; of phospholipid chains that make up the membranes of cells. Subunit cooperativity is measured on the relative scale known as Hill&#x27;s Constant.

==Hill equation==
A simple and widely used model for molecular interactions is the Hill equation, which provides a way to quantify cooperative binding by describing the fraction of saturated ligand binding sites as a function of the ligand concentration.

==Hill coefficient==
The Hill coefficient is a measure of ultrasensitivity (i.e. how steep is the response curve).

From an operational point of view the Hill coefficient can be estimated as:

:formula_1.

where &lt;chem&gt;EC90&lt;/chem&gt; and &lt;chem&gt;EC10&lt;/chem&gt; are the input values needed to produce the 10% and 90% of the maximal response, respectively.

==Response coefficient== 
Global sensitivity measures such as the Hill coefficient do not characterise the local behaviours of the s-shaped curves. Instead, these features are well captured by the response coefficient measure defined as:

:formula_2

In systems biology, such responses are referred to as elasticities.

==Link between Hill coefficient and response coefficient== 
Altszyler et al. (2017) have shown that these ultrasensitivity measures can be linked by the following equation:

:formula_3

where formula_4 denoted the mean value of the variable x over the range [a,b].

==Ultrasensitivity in function composition==
Consider two coupled ultrasensitive modules, disregarding effects of sequestration of molecular components between layers. In this case, the expression for the system&#x27;s dose-response curve, , results from the mathematical composition of the functions, formula_5, which describe the input/output relationship of isolated modules formula_6:

:formula_7

Brown et al. (1997) have shown that the local ultrasensitivity of the different layers combines multiplicatively:

:formula_8.

In connection with this result, Ferrell et al. (1997) showed, for Hill-type modules, that the overall cascade global ultrasensitivity had to be less than or equal to the product of the global ultrasensitivity estimations of each cascade&#x27;s layer,

:formula_9,

where formula_10 and formula_11 are the Hill coefficient of modules 1 and 2 respectively.

Altszyler et al. (2017) have shown that the cascade&#x27;s global ultrasensitivity can be analytically calculated:

:formula_12

where formula_13 and formula_14 delimited the Hill input&#x27;s working range of the composite system, i.e. the input values for the i-layer so that the last layer (corresponding to formula_15 in this case) reached the 10% and 90% of it maximal output level. It followed this equation that the system&#x27;s Hill coefficient could be written as the product of two factors, formula_16 and formula_17, which characterized local average sensitivities over the relevant input region for each layer: formula_18, with formula_6 in this case.

For the more general case of a cascade of modules, the Hill coefficient can be expressed as:

:formula_20,

===Supramultiplicativity===
Several authors have reported the existence of supramultiplicative behavior in signaling cascades (i.e. the ultrasensitivity of the combination of layers is higher than the product of individual ultrasensitivities), but in many cases the ultimate origin of supramultiplicativity remained elusive. Altszyler et al. (2017) framework naturally suggested a general scenario where supramultiplicative behavior could take place. This could occur when, for a given module, the corresponding Hill&#x27;s input working range was located in an input region with local ultrasensitivities higher than the global ultrasensitivity of the respective dose-response curve.

<doc id="505472" wikidata="Q5449225" url="?curid=505472" title="Filter binding assay">
<text>In biochemistry or chemistry, filter binding assay is a simple way to quickly study many samples. One of the ways to learn about an interaction between two molecules is to determine the binding constant, which is a number that describes the ratio of unbound and bound molecules. This information reveals the affinity between the two molecules and allows prediction of the amount bound given any set of initial conditions.

In order to measure a binding constant, one must find a way to measure the amount of complex formed over a range of starting concentrations. This can be achieved by &quot;labeling&quot; one of the species with a fluorescent, or in this case, a radioactive tag. The DNA is &quot;labeled&quot; by the addition of radioactive phosphate derived from adenosine triphosphate.

== Description ==

A filter binding assay measures affinities between two molecules (often protein and DNA) using a filter. The filter is constructed of nitrocellulose paper, which is negatively charged. Since most proteins have a net positive charge, nitrocellulose paper is ideal for immobilizing proteins. DNA is negatively charged due to the phosphate backbone and will not &quot;stick&quot; to the nitrocellulose on its own, however, any DNA that has been bound by protein will stick. The exact amount of DNA &quot;stuck&quot; to the nitrocellulose is quantified by measuring the amount of radioactivity on the filter using a scintillation counter.

Protein and DNA are mixed in a series of microfuge tubes in which the amount of DNA is kept constant, but the amount of protein is incrementally increased. These samples are allowed to equilibrate. After equilibration, an equal volume from each tube is squirted onto small, round, nitrocellulose filters which are arranged on a vacuum plate (a flat surface that has a vacuum applied from below to suck fluid downward). All of the protein will stick, but only the protein that has bound DNA will register in the scintillation counter.

Now, you will have a number that describes the amount of DNA bound for each concentration of protein used, this information can be plotted on a binding curve to determine the binding constant.

This assay is no longer used widely, but it is rapid and simple, and can give a lot of information. It would be used for relatively detailed analysis of a particular protein-DNA interaction, for example.

Measure the equilibrium constant:

*Incubate labeled DNA with protein.
*Allow enough time to allow the system to reach equilibrium.
*Filter the mixture through a filter disk made of nitrocellulose. Proteins bind to nitrocellulose, but DNA does not.
*Any DNA that is retained on the filter is there because it is interacting with the protein.
*Dry the filters and count.

Measure the off-rate:

*Take the filter with DNA-protein complex bound on it
*Wash the filter with buffer
*Quantify the amount of DNA remained on filter after it has been washed for a certain amount of time.

Another way of measuring off-rate:

*Radioactive labeled DNA and protein were pre-incubated together in high concentrations
*At time 0, the mixture was diluted
*Aliquotes were assayed at various times using nitrocellulose filters

<text>The Daybreak Star Indian Cultural Center is a Native American cultural center in Seattle, Washington, described by its parent organization United Indians of All Tribes as &quot;an urban base for Native Americans in the Seattle area.&quot; Located on 20 acres (81,000 m2) in Seattle&#x27;s Discovery Park in the Magnolia neighborhood, the center developed from activism by Bernie Whitebear and other Native Americans, who staged a generally successful self-styled &quot;invasion&quot; and occupation of the land in 1970. Most of the former Fort Lawton military base had been declared surplus by the U.S. Department of Defense. &quot;The claim [Whitebear and others made] to Fort Lawton was based on rights under 1865 U.S.-Indian treaties promising reversion of surplus military lands to their original owners.&quot;

The existing building, a work of modern architecture incorporating many elements of traditional Northwest Native architecture, was designed by Arai Jackson Architects and Planners and completed in 1977. In 2004, plans were approved to supplement it with a complex of three additional related buildings, to be known as the People&#x27;s Lodge. This was Whitebear&#x27;s final dream project before he died of cancer in 2000. But in 2006, after agreements had been reached between the tribes, the city and nearby residents on a reduced size for the new project, the Center decided to postpone construction indefinitely for lack of funds.

Daybreak Star, a major nucleus of Native American cultural activity in its region, functions as a conference center, a location for pow wows, the location for a Head Start school program, and an art gallery. The center&#x27;s permanent art collection includes a variety of large art works by and about Native Americans, notably &quot;Blue Jay&quot;, a 30-foot (9 m) wide, 12 foot (3.7 m) high sculpture by Lawney Reyes, Whitebear&#x27;s brother. It was commissioned by and hung prominently for more than 30 years at the Bank of California building in downtown Seattle. (After the Bank of California merged with Union Bank in 1996 to form Union Bank of California, the work was donated to the Daybreak Star Center.) Also included in that donation was a major oil painting by Guy Anderson, based on a traditional Northwest Native representation of a whale.

Bernie Whitebear is memorialized by the Bernie Whitebear Memorial Ethnobotanical Garden next to the Center building.

==History==
In 1970, the U.S. federal government was in the process of reviewing military needs and planned to declare as surplus much of the grounds of Fort Lawton, located on Puget Sound in the northwestern section of the Magnolia neighborhood. The state&#x27;s two U.S. Senators, Henry M. &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson and Warren G. Magnuson amended the U.S. Land and Water Conservation Act of 1965, reducing the previous 50-100 percent cost of acquiring surplus federal government property to 0-50 percent, so that such property might be acquired by bodies other than real estate developers. The property would initially be transferred to the city but was not constrained in use. In that period of Indian activism, many of Seattle&#x27;s urban Indians were concerned to gain a land base within the city. (As of the early 21st century, about 25,000 Indians from a variety of tribes live in the Seattle area.)

A group arose, initially identifying as &quot;Kinatechitapi&quot;, Blackfoot for &quot;All Indians&quot;; the name referred to the Indians of All Tribes (IAT), a group of mostly student activists then occupying Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay. Joe DeLaCruz, leader of the Quinault, conducted outreach to every tribe in Washington State to try to gain their support for gaining land in Seattle.

Kinatechitapi&#x27;s first efforts to open discussions about the property with the City of Seattle, in advance of surplus land being transferred to the city, failed. The city, under mayor Wes Uhlman, said it would not open discussions until it had acquired the land, and referred the group to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). As Whitebear later wrote, &quot;This action displayed their ignorance of both the BIA&#x27;s restricted service policy, which excluded urban Indians, and also the disregard and disfavor urban Indians held for the BIA.&quot; The City said that the Indian Center in a former church near Stewart Street downtown was an adequate facility for Seattle&#x27;s Indians. The members of the Magnolia Community Club, a group with significant political clout, were opposed to an Indian presence on the Fort Lawton land.

Kinatechitapi members split between a faction that called for direct action and one that preferred to wait until the city acquired the land, in order to conduct negotiations. Prominent among those who preferred to wait was Pearl Warren, founder of the American Indian Women&#x27;s Service League, who was concerned that a militant attitude would result in the city&#x27;s reducing its provision of services to urban Indians. Members agreed that those who wished to take more extreme action would not use the name &quot;Kinatechitapi.&quot; Warren lost the next election for presidency of the Service League to Joyce Reyes, who was aligned with those promoting direct action. All significant Seattle Indian organizations agreed on taking action.

===Direct action===
The more militant faction, led by Bernie Whitebear, soon adopted the name &quot;American Indian Fort Lawton Occupation Forces&quot;. The faction included Bob Satiacum, initially a rival to Whitebear for the top leadership role. A group vote settled on Whitebear as leader. Some of the Indians of All Tribes traveled to Seattle from Alcatraz for the action, including Richard Oakes, leader of that action; other activists came from Canada. Grace Thorpe, daughter of athlete Jim Thorpe, also arrived to give support. Local activists Ella Aquino and Ramona Bennett helped plan the occupation. The group planned to invade the base from two directions, with one group scaling the bluffs from Elliott Bay while another scaled the fence near the Lawton Wood community on the north side of the base. The group committed to nonviolence in this action.

American Indian soldiers and others were protesting at Fort Lewis, near Tacoma, linking native rights to opposition to the Vietnam War. At the behest of the Fort Lewis coalition, actress Jane Fonda came to Seattle at the time of the invasion of Fort Lawton. According to Whitebear, her presence 
&quot;captured the imagination of the world press. American Indians were attacking active military forts along with one of the nation&#x27;s leading opponents of United States involvement in the Vietnam War.&quot; Her presence transformed &quot;an effort to secure a land base for urban Indians&quot; into &quot;a bizarre, ready-for-prime-time, movie scenario, complete with soldiers, modern-day Indians, and anti-war activists. Without really appreciating it at the time, the Indian movement had achieved through Jane Fonda&#x27;s presence, a long-sought credibility which would not have been possible otherwise.&quot;

On the evening of March 7, 1970, at a pow-wow held at the Filipino Community Hall in south Seattle, invasion plans were announced. The following day, March 8, 1970, about 100 &quot;Native Americans and sympathizers&quot; confronted military police in riot gear at the fort, while about 500 supporters staged a legal protest outside the gates. Some of the invaders reached the base chapel, where a Sunday service was in progress, but in general, skirmish lines were quickly formed and the military police contained the invasion. Some of the invaders failed to maintain non-violence, especially when confronted by what Whitebear characterized as &quot;overly aggressive handling by the MPs&quot;. MPs (Military Police), aided by regular Army troops and Seattle Police, initially placed the invaders in the fort stockade, then ejected them from the fort. The Indian activists established a tipi encampment outside the fort. Mayor Uhlman and Senator Jackson held a press conference about the Fort Lawton property, promising a city park at the site above Puget Sound. They did not refer to the Indian action.

===United Indians of All Tribes Foundation===
Organizing as the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation (UIATF) with Whitebear as executive director, the Indians used tactics ranging from politicking to occupation of land to celebrity appearances to gain more support. For three months, activists engaged in what Whitebear later described as &quot;Invasion, arrests, jailings, letters of expulsion from military property, physical escort off the fort, re-invasion.&quot; The Army cordoned off the fort with concertina wire, brought in two companies of troops from Fort Lewis to prevent incursions, and dug foxholes.

By this time more than 40 non-Indian organizations in King County supported the Indians&#x27; efforts. Gary and Beverly Beaver, Randy Lewis, Grace Thorpe, Douglas Remington, and Bernie Whitebear testified before a congressional committee chaired by Morris Udall, and received support from US congressman Brock Adams from Seattle. Whitebear forged a relationship with Tom McLaughlin, deputy regional director of the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and through him with Buck Kelley, the regional director and top political appointee for HEW in the region. UIATF, which had previously avoided dealing with the BIA, now went through the National Congress of American Indians to approach the BIA and request a freeze on plans to transfer land at Fort Lawton until the issue between UIATF and the city was resolved. BIA commissioner Louis Bruce imposed such a freeze for a time, but eventually backed off at the behest of his boss, the Department of the Interior.

When the federal government officially put the surplus land up for offers, UIATF filed to acquire a portion of the fort directly from the federal government. Thanks to Whitebear&#x27;s maneuvering, UIATF&#x27;s application to acquire part of the land was technically filed prior to the city&#x27;s application for the whole parcel. The federal General Services Administration, which handled the surplus process, ultimately insisted that the City and UIATF come up with a joint plan for the property. In November 1971, the parties agreed that the city would grant UIATF with a 99-year lease on 20 acres (81,000 m2) in what would become Seattle&#x27;s Discovery Park, with options for renewal without renegotiation. In addition, the City granted $600,000 to the American Indian Women&#x27;s Service League for a social services center.

Whitebear was soon elected as CEO of the UIATF, and undertook fundraising (including a one million dollar grant from the state), and supervision of design and construction. Whitebear&#x27;s brother Lawney Reyes joined with architects of Arai Jackson to design the facility, which used traditional Native American elements in a modern building. It opened in 1977.

In the same era when Daybreak Star was being constructed, Whitebear was appointed to the Seattle Arts Commission. The UIATF was granted an $80,000 arts grant for the center. The center has wireless Internet access (&quot;UIATF-A&quot;).

<doc id="505484" wikidata="Q36961" url="?curid=505484" title="Spermatogenesis">
<text>Spermatogenesis is the process by which haploid spermatozoa develop from germ cells in the seminiferous tubules of the testicle. This process starts with the mitotic division of the stem cells located close to the basement membrane of the tubules. These cells are called spermatogonial stem cells. The mitotic division of these produces two types of cells. Type A cells replenish the stem cells, and type B cells differentiate into primary spermatocytes. The primary spermatocyte divides meiotically (Meiosis I) into two secondary spermatocytes; each secondary spermatocyte divides into two equal haploid spermatids by Meiosis II. The spermatids are transformed into spermatozoa (sperm) by the process of spermiogenesis. These develop into mature spermatozoa, also known as sperm cells. Thus, the primary spermatocyte gives rise to two cells, the secondary spermatocytes, and the two secondary spermatocytes by their subdivision produce four spermatozoa and four haploid cells.

Spermatozoa are the mature male gametes in many sexually reproducing organisms. Thus, spermatogenesis is the male version of gametogenesis, of which the female equivalent is oogenesis. In mammals it occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the male testes in a stepwise fashion. Spermatogenesis is highly dependent upon optimal conditions for the process to occur correctly, and is essential for sexual reproduction. DNA methylation and histone modification have been implicated in the regulation of this process. It starts during puberty and usually continues uninterrupted until death, although a slight decrease can be discerned in the quantity of produced sperm with increase in age (see Male infertility).

Spermatogenesis starts in the bottom part of seminiferous tubes and, progressively, cells go deeper into tubes and moving along it until mature spermatozoa reaches the lumen, where mature spermatozoa are deposited. The division happens asynchronically; if the tube is cut transversally one could observe different maturation states. A group of cells with different maturation states that are being generated at the same time is called a spermatogenic wave.

== Purpose ==
Spermatogenesis produces mature male gametes, commonly called &quot;sperm&quot; but more specifically known as &quot;spermatozoa&quot;, which are able to fertilize the counterpart female gamete, the oocyte, during conception to produce a single-celled individual known as a zygote. This is the cornerstone of sexual reproduction and involves the two gametes both contributing half the normal set of chromosomes (haploid) to result in a chromosomally normal (diploid) zygote.

To preserve the number of chromosomes in the offspring – which differs between species – one of each gamete must have half the usual number of chromosomes present in other body cells. Otherwise, the offspring will have twice the normal number of chromosomes, and serious abnormalities may result. In humans, chromosomal abnormalities arising from incorrect spermatogenesis results in congenital defects and abnormal birth defects (Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome) and in most cases, spontaneous abortion of the developing foetus.

==Location in humans==
Spermatogenesis takes place within several structures of the male reproductive system. The initial stages occur within the testes and progress to the epididymis where the developing gametes mature and are stored until ejaculation. The seminiferous tubules of the testes are the starting point for the process, where spermatogonial stem cells adjacent to the inner tubule wall divide in a centripetal direction—beginning at the walls and proceeding into the innermost part, or &quot;lumen&quot;—to produce immature sperm. Maturation occurs in the epididymis. The location [Testes/Scrotum] is specifically important as the process of spermatogenesis requires a lower temperature to produce viable sperm, specifically 1°-8 °C lower than normal body temperature of 37 °C (98.6 °F). Clinically, small fluctuations in temperature such as from an athletic support strap, causes no impairment in sperm viability or count.

==Duration==
For humans, the entire process of spermatogenesis is variously estimated as taking between 72 and 74 days (according to tritium-labelled biopsies) and approximately 120 days (according to DNA clock measurements). Including the transport on ductal system, it takes 3 months. Testes produce 200 to 300 million spermatozoa daily. However, only about half or 100 million of these become viable sperm.

== Stages ==
The entire process of spermatogenesis can be broken up into several distinct stages, each corresponding to a particular type of cell in humans. In the following table, ploidy, copy number and chromosome/chromatid counts are for one cell, generally prior to DNA synthesis and division (in G1 if applicable). The primary spermatocyte is arrested after DNA synthesis and prior to division.

=== Spermatocytogenesis ===

Spermatocytogenesis is the male form of gametocytogenesis and results in the formation of spermatocytes possessing half the normal complement of genetic material. In spermatocytogenesis, a diploid spermatogonium, which resides in the basal compartment of the seminiferous tubules, divides mitotically, producing two diploid intermediate cells called primary spermatocytes. Each primary spermatocyte then moves into the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous tubules and duplicates its DNA and subsequently undergoes &quot;meiosis I&quot; to produce two haploid secondary spermatocytes, which will later divide once more into haploid spermatids. This division implicates sources of genetic variation, such as random inclusion of either parental chromosomes, and chromosomal crossover that increases the genetic variability of the gamete. The DNA damage response (DDR) machinery plays an important role in spermatogenesis. The protein FMRP binds to meiotic chromosomes and regulates the dynamics of the DDR machinery during spermatogenesis. FMRP appears to be necessary for the repair of DNA damage.

During spermatocytogenesis, meiosis employs special DNA repair processes that remove DNA damages and help maintain the integrity of the genome that is passed on to progeny. These DNA repair processes include homologous recombinational repair and non-homologous end joining

Each cell division from a spermatogonium to a spermatid is incomplete; the cells remain connected to one another by bridges of cytoplasm to allow synchronous development. Not all spermatogonia divide to produce spermatocytes; otherwise, the supply of spermatogonia would run out. Instead, spermatogonial stem cells divide mitotically to produce copies of themselves, ensuring a constant supply of spermatogonia to fuel spermatogenesis.

=== Spermatidogenesis ===

Spermatidogenesis is the creation of spermatids from secondary spermatocytes. Secondary spermatocytes produced earlier rapidly enter meiosis II and divide to produce haploid spermatids. The brevity of this stage means that secondary spermatocytes are rarely seen in histological studies.

=== Spermiogenesis ===

During spermiogenesis, the spermatids begin to form a tail by growing microtubules on one of the centrioles, which turns into basal body. These microtubules form an axoneme. Later the centriole is modified in the process of centrosome reduction. The anterior part of the tail (called midpiece) thickens because mitochondria are arranged around the axoneme to ensure energy supply. Spermatid DNA also undergoes packaging, becoming highly condensed. The DNA is packaged firstly with specific nuclear basic proteins, which are subsequently replaced with protamines during spermatid elongation. The resultant tightly packed chromatin is transcriptionally inactive. The Golgi apparatus surrounds the now condensed nucleus, becoming the acrosome.

Maturation then takes place under the influence of testosterone, which removes the remaining unnecessary cytoplasm and organelles. The excess cytoplasm, known as &quot;residual bodies&quot;, is phagocytosed by surrounding Sertoli cells in the testes. The resulting spermatozoa are now mature but lack motility. The mature spermatozoa are released from the protective Sertoli cells into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule in a process called &quot;spermiation&quot;.

The non-motile spermatozoa are transported to the epididymis in &quot;testicular fluid&quot; secreted by the Sertoli cells with the aid of peristaltic contraction. While in the epididymis the spermatozoa gain motility and become capable of fertilization. However, transport of the mature spermatozoa through the remainder of the male reproductive system is achieved via muscle contraction rather than the spermatozoon&#x27;s recently acquired motility.

== Role of Sertoli cells ==
At all stages of differentiation, the spermatogenic cells are in close contact with Sertoli cells which are thought to provide structural and metabolic support to the developing sperm cells. A single Sertoli cell extends from the basement membrane to the lumen of the seminiferous tubule, although the cytoplasmic processes are difficult to distinguish at the light microscopic level.

Sertoli cells serve a number of functions during spermatogenesis, they support the developing gametes in the following ways:
* Maintain the environment necessary for development and maturation, via the blood-testis barrier
* Secrete substances initiating meiosis
* Secrete supporting testicular fluid
* Secrete androgen-binding protein (ABP), which concentrates testosterone in close proximity to the developing gametes
** Testosterone is needed in very high quantities for maintenance of the reproductive tract, and ABP allows a much higher level of fertility
* Secrete hormones affecting pituitary gland control of spermatogenesis, particularly the polypeptide hormone, inhibin
* Phagocytose residual cytoplasm left over from spermiogenesis
* Secretion of anti-Müllerian hormone causes deterioration of the Müllerian duct 
* Protect spermatids from the immune system of the male, via the blood-testis barrier
* Contribute to the spermatogonial stem cell niche

The intercellular adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and soluble ICAM-1 have antagonistic effects on the tight junctions forming the blood-testis barrier. ICAM-2 molecules regulate spermatid adhesion on the apical side of the barrier (towards the lumen).

== Influencing factors ==
The process of spermatogenesis is highly sensitive to fluctuations in the environment, particularly hormones and temperature. Testosterone is required in large local concentrations to maintain the process, which is achieved via the binding of testosterone by androgen binding protein present in the seminiferous tubules. Testosterone is produced by interstitial cells, also known as Leydig cells, which reside adjacent to the seminiferous tubules.

Seminiferous epithelium is sensitive to elevated temperature in humans and some other species, and will be adversely affected by temperatures as high as normal body temperature. In addition, spermatogonia do not achieve maturity at body temperature in most of mammals, as β-polimerase and spermatogenic recombinase need a specific optimal temperature. Consequently, the testes are located outside the body in a sac of skin called the scrotum. The optimal temperature is maintained at 2 °C (man) (8 °C mouse) below body temperature. This is achieved by regulation of blood flow and positioning towards and away from the heat of the body by the cremasteric muscle and the dartos smooth muscle in the scrotum.

One important mechanism is a thermal exchange between testicular arterial and venous blood streams. Specialized anatomic arrangements consist of two zones of coiling along the internal spermatic artery. This anatomic arrangement prolongs the time of contact and the thermal exchange between the testicular arterial and venous blood streams and may, in part, explain the temperature gradient between aortic and testicular arterial blood reported in dogs and rams. Moreover, reduction in pulse pressure, occurring in the proximal one third of the coiled length of the internal spermatic artery. Moreover, the activity of spermatogenic recombinase decreases, and this is supposed to be an important factor of testicles degeneration.

Dietary deficiencies (such as vitamins B, E and A), anabolic steroids, metals (cadmium and lead), x-ray exposure, dioxin, alcohol, and infectious diseases will also adversely affect the rate of spermatogenesis. In addition, the male germ line is susceptible to DNA damage caused by oxidative stress, and this damage likely has a significant impact on fertilization and pregnancy. According to the study by Omid Mehrpour et al exposure to pesticides also affects spermatogenesis.

== Hormonal control ==
Hormonal control of spermatogenesis varies among species. In humans the mechanism is not completely understood; however it is known that initiation of spermatogenesis occurs at puberty due to the interaction of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and Leydig cells. If the pituitary gland is removed, spermatogenesis can still be initiated by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone. In contrast to FSH, luteinizing hormone (LH) appears to have little role in spermatogenesis outside of inducing gonadal testosterone production.

FSH stimulates both the production of androgen binding protein (ABP) by Sertoli cells, and the formation of the blood-testis barrier. ABP is essential to concentrating testosterone in levels high enough to initiate and maintain spermatogenesis. Intratesticular testosterone levels are 20–100 or 50–200 times higher than the concentration found in blood, although there is variation over a 5- to 10-fold range amongst healthy men. Testosterone production does not remain constant throughout the day, but follows a circadian rhythm. The maximum peak of testosterone occurs at 8 a.m., which explains why men frequently suffer from morning erections. In younger men, testosterone peaks are higher. FSH may initiate the sequestering of testosterone in the testes, but once developed only testosterone is required to maintain spermatogenesis. However, increasing the levels of FSH will increase the production of spermatozoa by preventing the apoptosis of &quot;type A spermatogonia&quot;. The hormone inhibin acts to decrease the levels of FSH. Studies from rodent models suggest that gonadotropins (both LH and FSH) support the process of spermatogenesis by suppressing the proapoptotic signals and therefore promote spermatogenic cell survival.

The Sertoli cells themselves mediate parts of spermatogenesis through hormone production. They are capable of producing the hormones estradiol and inhibin. The Leydig cells are also capable of producing estradiol in addition to their main product testosterone. Estrogen has been found to be essential for spermatogenesis in animals. However, a man with estrogen insensitivity syndrome (a defective ERα) was found produce sperm with a normal sperm count, albeit abnormally low sperm viability; whether he was sterile or not is unclear. Levels of estrogen that are too high can be detrimental to spermatogenesis due to suppression of gonadotropin secretion and by extension intratesticular testosterone production. The connection between spermatogenesis and prolactin levels appears to be moderate, with optimal prolactin levels reflecting efficient sperm production.

==Disorders==
Disorders of spermatogenesis may cause oligospermia, which is semen with a low concentration of sperm and is a common finding in male infertility.

<doc id="505486" wikidata="Q2080364" url="?curid=505486" title="Consett">
<text>Consett is a town in the County Durham district, in the ceremonial county of Durham, England, about south-west of Newcastle upon Tyne. It had a population of 27,394 in 2001 and an estimate of 25,812 in 2019.

==History==
Consett sits high on the edge of the Pennines. Its name originates in the Old English &quot;Cunecesheafod&quot; (&quot;heafod&quot; means headland, the meaning of &quot;cunec&quot; is less clear but is thought to derive from the Brittonic &quot;conyge&quot; or &quot;hill&quot;), first recorded in the 13th century. In 1841, it was a village community of only 145, but it was about to become a boom town: below the ground were coking coal and blackband iron ore, and nearby was limestone. These three ingredients were needed for blast furnaces to produce iron and steel.

The town is perched on the steep eastern bank of the River Derwent and owes its origins to industrial development arising from lead mining in the area, together with the development of the steel industry in the Derwent Valley, which is said to have been initiated by immigrant German cutlers and sword-makers from Solingen, who settled in the village of Shotley Bridge during the 17th century.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Derwent Valley was the cradle of the British steel industry, helped by the easy availability of coal in the area and the import of high quality iron ore from Sweden via the port of Newcastle upon Tyne. However, after the invention of the Bessemer process in the 19th century, steel could be made from British iron ore (hitherto too heavily contaminated by phosphorus) and the Derwent Valley&#x27;s geographical advantage was lost, allowing Sheffield to become the leading centre of the British steel industry.

Consett railway station opened in 1896. It remained open for passengers until 1955 and mineral trains continued to pass through the site until 1980 on their way to the steelworks. In November 2020, the Department for Transport approved funding for an initial feasibility study into restoring a rail link to the town.

==Governance==
Consett is part of the Blaydon and Consett parliament constituency.
It was previously part of the North West Durham Parliamentary Constituency, last represented by Richard Holden of the Conservative Party after the 2019 general election. Since 2024 it is part of Blaydon and Consett Parliamentary Constituency, represented by Liz Twist. Before 1983, the town gave its name to its parliamentary constituency: Consett (UK Parliament constituency).

Consett was part of Derwentside District Council, which merged into the Durham County Council unitary authority on 1 April 2009. The Consett area is currently divided into four electoral divisions (Benfieldside; Consett North; Delves Lane and Consett South; and Leadgate and Medomsley), each electing two county councillors.

The town unlike most other towns and villages in County Durham is unparished and has no town council.

Consett was part of the constituency of North East England in the European Parliament until 2020.

==Geography==
Consett sits above the rural Derwent valley near the boundary of County Durham and Northumberland. The Derwent Reservoir just west of the town makes a popular leisure attraction and beauty spot.

At about 900 ft (270 metres) above sea level, Consett is the third highest market town in England and one of the highest towns in the United Kingdom. This makes Consett typically at least 2 °C colder than nearby cities such as Durham and Newcastle, and more prone to frost, ice and snow in the winter months.

Consett has amenities such as shops, pubs and night clubs that also serve several villages in its immediate surroundings, some such as Shotley Bridge and Blackhill contiguous and some not, for example Moorside and Castleside.

==Economy==
The Consett Iron Company was established in 1864 as a successor to the original Derwent Iron Company of 1840, when the first blast furnaces were introduced. Over the next 100 years, Consett became one of the world&#x27;s most prominent steel-making towns, manufacturing the steel for Blackpool Tower and some of the UK&#x27;s nuclear submarines.

Steel dominated Consett&#x27;s economy for 140 years, with the steelworks&#x27; tall cooling towers and other large plant looming over rows of terraced houses. During the iron and steel era a pall of red dust hung over the town, consisting of airborne iron oxide from the steel-making plant. At its peak in the 1960s, the Consett steel works employed 6,000 workers. It was nationalised to become part of the large British Steel Corporation. Although there was intense competition in the 1970s from British firms and from abroad, Consett steelworks remained relatively successful and still profitable even in the year it closed. As the rolling mills were closed in the 1970s, despite local opposition, there were discussions over the future of the plant as a whole.

===Steelworks closure===
Consett steelworks had always avoided closure, even in difficult economic times, but in 1980 it was closed with the loss of 3,700 jobs and many more from the knock-on effects in ancillary industries. The unemployment rate in Consett became double the national average. A major plan to restructure steel-making in the UK saw light in the mid-1970s, based on concentrating it in five UK coastal locations, to allow easy import of raw materials and export of finished goods. BSC Consett was not one of the locations, despite being serviced by a well-established rail network, producing high-quality boron steel and being in profit in 1980, the year it was closed.

A deputation of steelworkers lobbied the government in London. The social impact of the decision was often characterised by many of the local people at the time as &quot;The Murder of a Town&quot;. After closure of the steel works the town became one of the worst unemployment black spots in Britain. In 1981, it peaked at 36 per cent – one of the worst unemployment rates of any town in the United Kingdom and around three times the national average at the time. The closure marked the end of the Derwent Valley steel heritage, and the decline of Consett as an industrial town. Along with the closure of coal mines, it was also a first step in the decline of all heavy industry in the Derwent Valley.

The last steel ingot from the Consett ironworks was made into a cross and is kept at St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, Blackhill.

===Regeneration===
Regeneration in the 1990s, through Project Genesis, went only some way towards repairing the damage done to the local economy by these closures. Unemployment came down to the national average, but this was partly due to outward migration and economic inactivity due to long-term illness, neither of which were included in the government statistics. In 2011 Durham County Council, which provides a lot of employment for local people, commenced a three-year plan to reduce its workforce by 1600.

Alongside the public sector, small and medium-sized businesses now provide jobs in the area. The Phileas Fogg Company (County Durham), with its factory in Consett, were mildly famous for a few years from 1988 for their snack food &quot;Made in Medomsley Road, Consett&quot; television adverts. It is now owned by KP Snacks (originally part of United Biscuits). The Explorer Group, based in Consett, is the United Kingdom&#x27;s second-largest manufacturer of caravans. Elddis Transport Limited is based in the town.

Since 2000, there have been several new housing developments on the former steelworks site and surrounding areas. Derwentside College, formerly sited at Park Road, moved to a new campus at Berry Edge in September 2002 and more recently, major retailers have moved in and the site which once made steel for Blackpool Tower and Britain&#x27;s nuclear submarines is now home to rival Tesco and Morrisons stores, a string of high street outlets and fast food restaurants.

New industrial units are also to be built on the former steel works site, after the Project Genesis Trust secured investment of £358,968 from the Rural Growth Network (RGN) to develop bespoke business premises and offices on part of the site. (The Project Genesis Trust is a body created to regenerate the former steelworks site).

The population soared to 39,000, higher than in the days of steel, and unemployment plummeted. In August 2015, only 420 people were receiving Jobseekers&#x27; Allowance, with an official unemployment rate of 1.7 per cent, markedly lower than the rest of County Durham. The wider claimant count of people on out-of-work benefits was 6.3 per cent, half the County Durham average, although it omits those receiving disability benefits, which will be a significant number, given the town&#x27;s industrial legacy.

A large area formerly used by Shotley Bridge Hospital was sold to a property developer, which began to build a further 400 homes in 2013–2014. This development has now become the multi-award-winning Woodlands Estate. This has further aided Consett&#x27;s recovery as a top commuter town due to its convenient location between Durham and Newcastle.

Along with the housing developments of the last few years (some still ongoing), there has also been major investment in local amenities, such as a £44-million sports complex in Medomsley Road, near the old sports facilities. This is shared with Consett Academy, which was given a brand new £5.7 million building.

In June 2020, the MP for North West Durham, Richard Holden, sponsored a bid to the &quot;Ideas Fund&quot; of the Department for Transport&#x27;s &quot;Restoring Your Railway Fund&quot;, hoping to access up to £50,000 to cover the cost of an initial study into the feasibility of restoring a rail link between Consett and Blaydon. In November 2020 it was announced that the requested funds would be provided for such a study into reinstating a rail service between Consett and , although it was unclear where the Consett terminus of such a rail link would be located and whether this study would focus on the former Derwent Valley Railway or also include the former route via Birtley.

==Education==
Consett&#x27;s secondary school is Consett Academy. However, near to Consett in Lanchester is St Bede&#x27;s Catholic School and Sixth Form College and in Stanley North Durham Academy, which along with Consett Academy is part of the New College Durham Academies Trust (NCDAT) managed by New College Durham.

==Culture==
Consett is home to the Empire Theatre, one of County Durham&#x27;s oldest theatres. Recently refurbished, it stages variety acts, plays and a Christmas pantomime. It also screens films at times when there are no live performances.

===Belle Vue Leisure Centre===
The Belle Vue Leisure Centre, including a gym, swimming pool, five-a-side football, tennis and babminton courts is situated on Medomsley Road. 

===Other Entertainment===
There are several well known pubs in Consett town centre including &quot;The Turf&quot; (which periodically hosts live music, also called &quot;Turfed Oot Café&quot;), &quot;The Fountain&quot;, &quot;Bellamy&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Black Horse&quot;, &quot;The Traveller&#x27;s Rest&quot;, &quot;The Duke of Wellington&quot; and the real ale pub, &quot;The Grey Horse&quot;, the latter of which hosts the &quot;Consett Ale Works&quot; microbrewery. Additionally, &quot;The Company Row&quot;, a Wetherspoons pub, sits on the junction of Victoria Road and Front Street.

Also well known is Consett&#x27;s &quot;Steel Club&quot; north of the bus station.

===Salvation Army Band===
Consett was the first in the world to have a Salvation Army Corps Band, formed in December 1879 to play on the streets at Christmas. The original four musicians were Edward Lennox and his bandsmen George Storey, James Simpson and Robert Greenwood.

<text>Metlink was the marketing body and umbrella brand for public train, tram and bus transport operators in Melbourne, Australia. On 2 April 2012, the operations of Metlink were transferred to the newly created public transport planning and management authority, Public Transport Victoria.

==History==
In 1999, the public transport system in Melbourne was disaggregated and privatised. Immediately after privatisation, there was no active system-wide branding or marketing. As a result, branding, marketing and the provision of customer information became fragmented and disjointed.

In 2003, the Victorian Government and operators joined forces to create ‘Metlink’ which provided a single identity for Melbourne&#x27;s public transport system. Metlink involved the provision of integrated signage, consumer information and advertising.

==Responsibilities==
Metlink was responsible for the promotion of travel by public transport. It published timetables, maps and guides, operated a multi-modal website, provided a journey planner, call centre, market research and data collection. Metlink also accepted and processed customer feedback, and tracked lost property.

As well as establishing a common brand for Melbourne&#x27;s public transport network, the Metlink initiative was intended to better integrate information about train, tram and bus transport in Melbourne, and therefore provide passengers with better information about connecting services.

Following changes to the privatisation of Melbourne&#x27;s public transport system in April 2004, the Metlink brand was transferred to a new company, Metlink Victoria Pty Ltd, the role of which was also to perform several minor functions previously performed by the State Government and the franchise operators. Metlink&#x27;s ownership was then handed over to the two remaining major metropolitan operators - Yarra Trams and Connex Melbourne - the latter replaced by new train franchisee Metro Trains Melbourne in 2009. Representatives of the Bus Association of Victoria and V/Line had input into Metlink, but they did not have a controlling interest.

Metlink also had responsibility for the Revenue Clearing House, the passenger information website (formerly Victrip), the 131 638 (131 MET) telephone information service, and the public transport information centre &quot;Met Shop&quot; on Swanston Street.

==Branding==

Metlink developed a master style guide for timetables, maps and other customer information, to complement the graphic design style of signage. The Metlink brand signage was implemented in 2003, with progressive replacement of the heterogeneous signage previously used by the various (some defunct) public transport operators at railway stations, tram and bus stops throughout Melbourne.

Under the Metlink branding system, railway station signage and timetables were colour-coded Blue, tram stop signs and timetables were colour-coded Green, and the bus network was colour-coded Orange. Additionally, the regional train and coach network was colour-coded Purple. This colour scheme has also been adopted by the successor public transport operator, Public Transport Victoria.

==Marketing==
Metlink also acted as a marketing entity for public transport, and released several television advertisements. However, this was not an exclusive arrangement, as a separate set of TV advertisements was produced by former train operator Connex (featuring Sheena Easton and a trainload of passengers singing her 1980 hit &quot;Morning Train (9 to 5)&quot;) during April and May 2004. In mid-2005 Connex launched another independent print and television advertising campaign, this time focusing on its safety initiatives, and featuring Humpty Dumpty. In 2006, Connex launched a TV campaign &quot;Don&#x27;t Hold Others Back&quot; focusing on encouraging courtesy on the Melbourne Rail Network.

Metlink was also active in encouraging use of &quot;value Metcards&quot; (pre-purchased multi-trip and periodical tickets) and ran a humorous campaign promoting this called BATBYGOBSTOPL (Buying A Ticket Before You Get On Board Saves Time Or Problems Later). In July 2007, Metlink launched a new campaign, &quot;I Highly Recommend You Get on the Bus&quot;, featuring comedian Frank Woodley, to promote improvements in bus services and, following that, the &quot;Take it Easy, Take the bus&quot; campaign.

==Viclink==

Victoria&#x27;s regional bus and rail services were brought under an associated brand to Metlink called Viclink. Related signage upgrades at regional railway stations began in October 2006, and were also rolled out for major regional city bus networks. The Viclink brand was subsumed by the new public transport umbrella organisation, Public Transport Victoria, on 2 April 2012.

==Legislation and governance==
===Transport Integration Act===
The prime transport-related statute in Victoria is the Transport Integration Act 2010. The act established the Department of Transport as the integration agency for Victoria&#x27;s transport system. The act also establishes and sets the charters of the State agencies charged with providing public transport rail services and managing network access for freight services, namely the former Director of Public Transport and V/Line. In addition, the act establishes VicTrack which owns the public rail network and associated infrastructure. Another important statute is the Rail Management Act 1996 which confers powers on rail operators and provides for an access scheme for the state&#x27;s rail network.

===Rail Safety Act===
The safety of rail transport operations in Melbourne is regulated by the Rail Safety Act 2006 which applies to all commercial passenger operations. The Act establishes a framework containing safety duties for all rail industry participants and requires operators who manage infrastructure and rolling stock to obtain accreditation prior to commencing operations. Accredited operators are also required to have a safety management system to guide their operations. Sanctions applying to the safety scheme established under the Rail Safety Act are contained in the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983. The safety regulator for the rail system in Melbourne including trams is the Director, Transport Safety (trading as Transport Safety Victoria) whose office is established under the Transport Integration Act 2010.

===Ticketing and conduct===
Ticketing requirements for trains, trams and buses in Melbourne are mainly contained in the Transport (Ticketing) Regulations 2006 and the Victorian Fares and Ticketing Manual. Rules about safe and fair conduct on trains, trams and buses in Melbourne are generally contained in the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983 and the Transport (Conduct) Regulations 2005.

<text>dnaC is a loading factor that complexes with the C-terminus of helicase dnaB and inhibits it from unwinding the dsDNA at a replication fork. A dnaB and dnaC associate near the dnaA bound origin for each of the ssDNA. One dnaB-dnaC complex is oriented in the opposite direction to the other dnaB-dnaC complex due to the antiparallel nature of DNA. Because they are oriented in opposite directions, one dnaB-dnaC complex will complex with dnaA from the N-terminus of dnaB whereas the other dnaB-dnaC complex will complex with dnaA from the dnaC. After the assembly of dnaG onto the N-terminus of dnaB, dnaC is released and dnaB will be allowed to begin unwinding dsDNA to make room for DNA polymerase III to begin synthesizing the daughter strands.

This interaction of dnaC with dnaB requires the hydrolysis of ATP.

<text>DnaG is a bacterial DNA primase and is encoded by the &quot;dnaG&quot; gene. The enzyme DnaG, and any other DNA primase, synthesizes short strands of RNA known as oligonucleotides during DNA replication. These oligonucleotides are known as primers because they act as a starting point for DNA synthesis. DnaG catalyzes the synthesis of oligonucleotides that are 10 to 60 nucleotides (the fundamental unit of DNA and RNA) long, however most of the oligonucleotides synthesized are 11 nucleotides. These RNA oligonucleotides serve as primers, or starting points, for DNA synthesis by bacterial DNA polymerase III (Pol III). DnaG is important in bacterial DNA replication because DNA polymerase cannot initiate the synthesis of a DNA strand, but can only add nucleotides to a preexisting strand. DnaG synthesizes a single RNA primer at the origin of replication. This primer serves to prime leading strand DNA synthesis. For the other parental strand, the lagging strand, DnaG synthesizes an RNA primer every few kilobases (kb). These primers serve as substrates for the synthesis of Okazaki fragments.

In &quot;E. coli&quot; DnaG associates through noncovalent interactions with bacterial replicative helicase DnaB to perform its primase activity, with three DnaG primase proteins associating with each DnaB helicase to form the primosome. Primases tend to initiate synthesis at specific three nucleotide sequences on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) templates and for &quot;E. coli&quot; DnaG the sequence is 5&#x27;-CTG-3&#x27;.

DnaG contains three separate protein domains: a zinc binding domain, an RNA polymerase domain, and a DnaB helicase binding domain. There are several bacteria that use the DNA primase DnaG. A few organisms that have DnaG as their DNA primase are &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (&quot;E. coli&quot;), &quot;Bacillus stearothermophilus&quot;, and &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; (MTB). E. coli DnaG has a molecular weight of 60 kilodaltons (kDa) and contains 581 amino acids.

==Function==


DnaG catalyzes the synthesis of oligonucleotides in five discrete steps: template binding, nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) binding, initiation, extension to form a primer, and primer transfer to DNA polymerase III. DnaG performs this catalysis near the replication fork that is formed by DnaB helicase during DNA replication. DnaG must be complexed with DnaB in order for it to catalyze the formation of the oligonucleotide primers.

The mechanism for primer synthesis by primases involves two NTP binding sites on the primase protein (DnaG). Prior to the binding of any NTPs to form the RNA primer, the ssDNA template sequence binds to DnaG. The ssDNA contains a three nucleotide recognition sequence that recruits NTPs based on Watson-Crick base pairing. After binding DNA, DnaG must bind two NTPs in order to generate an enzyme-DNA-NTP-NTP quaternary complex. The Michaelis constant&#x27;s (km) for the NTPs vary depending on the primase and templates. The two NTP binding sites on DnaG are referred to as the initiation site and elongation site. The initiation site is the site at which the NTP to be incorporated at the 5&#x27; end of the primer binds. The elongation site binds the NTP that is added to the 3&#x27; end of the primer.

Once two nucleotides are bound to the primase, DnaG catalyzes the formation of a dinucleotide by forming a phosphodiester bond via dehydration synthesis between the 3&#x27; hydroxyl of the nucleotide in the initiation site and the α-phosphate of the nucleotide in the elongation site. This reaction results in a dinucleotide and breaking of the bond between the α and β phosphorus, releasing pyrophosphate. This reaction is irreversible because the pyrophosphate that is formed is hydrolyzed into two inorganic phosphate molecules by the enzyme inorganic pyrophosphatase. This dinucleotide synthesis reaction is the same reaction as any other enzyme that catalyzes the formation of DNA or RNA (DNA Polymerase, RNA Polymerase), therefore DnaG must always synthesize oligonucleotides in the 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; direction. In &quot;E. coli&quot;, primers begin with a triphosphate adenine-guanine (pppAG) dinucleotide at the 5&#x27; end.

In order for further elongation of the dinucleotide to occur, oligonucleotide must be moved so that the 3&#x27; NTP is transferred from the elongation site to the initiation site, allowing for another NTP to bind to the elongation site and attach to the 3&#x27; hydroxyl of the oligonucleotide. Once an oligonucleotide of appropriate length has been synthesized from the elongation step of primer synthesis, DnaG transfers the newly synthesized primer to DNA polymerase III for it to synthesize the DNA leading strand or Okazaki fragments for the lagging strand. The rate limiting step of the primer synthesis occurs after NTP binding but before or during dinucleotide synthesis.

== Structure ==
The E. Coli DnaG primase is a 581 residue monomeric protein with three functional domains, according to proteolysis studies. There is an N-terminal Zinc-binding domain (residues 1–110) where a zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated between one histidine and three cysteine residues, which plays a role in recognizing sequence specific DNA binding sites. The central domain (residues 111–433) displays RNA polymerase activities, and is the site of RNA primer synthesis. The C-terminal domain (residues 434–581) is responsible for the noncovalent binding of DnaG to the DnaB helicase protein.

=== Zinc-Binding Domain ===
The zinc-binding domain, the domain responsible for recognizing sequence specific DNA binding sites, is conserved across all viral, bacteriophage, prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA primases. The primase zinc-binding domain is part of the subfamily of zinc-binding domains known as the zinc ribbon. Zinc ribbon domains are characterized by two β-hairpin loops which form the zinc-binding domain. Typically, zinc ribbon domains are thought to lack α-helices, distinguishing them from other zinc-binding domains. However, in 2000 DnaG&#x27;s zinc-binding domain was crystallized from &quot;Bacillus stearothermophilus&quot; revealing that the domain consisted of a five stranded antiparallel β sheet adjacent to four α helices and a 310 helix on the c-terminal end of the domain.

The zinc-binding site of &quot;B. stearothermophilus&quot; consists of three cysteine residues, Cys40, Cys61, and Cys64, and one histidine residue, His43. Cys40 and His43 are located on the β-hairpin between the second and third β sheet. Cys61 is located on the fifth β sheet, and Cys64 is on the β-hairpin between the fourth and fifth β sheet. These four residues coordinate the zinc ion tetrahedrally. The zinc ion is thought to stabilize the loops between the second and third β sheet as well as the fourth and fifth β sheet. The domain is further stabilized by a number of hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic inner surface of the β sheet which is packed against the second and third α helices. The outer surface of the β sheet also has many conserved hydrophobic and basic residues. These residues are Lys30, Arg34, Lys46, Pro48, Lys56, Ile58, His60 and Phe62.

==== DNA Binding ====
It is thought that the function of the zinc binding domain is for sequence specific DNA recognition. DNA primases make RNA primers which are then used for DNA synthesis. The placement of the RNA primers is not random, suggesting that they are placed on specific DNA sequences. Indeed, other DNA primases have been shown to recognize triplet sequences; the specific sequence recognized by &quot;B. stearothermophilus&quot; has not yet been identified. It has been shown that if the cystine residues that coordinate the zinc ion are mutated, the DNA primase stops functioning. This indicates that the zinc-binding domain does play a role in sequence recognition. In addition, the hydrophobic surface of the β sheet, as well as the basic residues which are clustered primarily on one edge of the sheet, serve to attract single stranded DNA, further facilitating DNA binding.

Based on previous studies of DNA binding by DNA Primases, it is thought that DNA binds to the zinc-binding domain across the surface of the β sheet, with the three nucleotides binding across three strands of the β sheet. The positively charged residues in the sheet would be able to form contacts with the phosphates and the aromatic residues would form stacking interactions with the bases. This is the model of DNA binding by the ssDNA-binding domain of replication protein A (RPA). It is logical to assume that &quot; B. stearothermophilus’ &quot; zinc-binding domain binds DNA in a similar manner, as the residues important for binding DNA in RPA occur in structurally equivalent positions in &quot;B. stearothermophilus&quot;.

=== RNA Polymerase Domain ===

As its name suggests, the RNA polymerase domain (RNAP) of DnaG is responsible for synthesizing the RNA primers on the single stranded DNA. In-vivo, DnaG is able to synthesis primer fragments of up to 60 nucleotides, but in-vivo primer fragments are limited to approximately 11 nucleotides. During the synthesis of the lagging strand DnaG synthesizes between 2000 and 3000 primers at a rate of one primer per-second.

RNAP domain of DnaG has three subdomains, the N-terminal domain, which has a mixed α and β fold, the central domain consisting of a 5 stranded β sheet and 6 α helices, and finally the C-terminal domain which is made up of a helical bundle consisting of 3 antiparallel α helices. The central domain is made up in part of the toprim fold, a fold that has been observed in many metal-binding phosphotransfer proteins. The central domain and the N-terminal domain form a shallow cleft, which makes up the active site of the RNA chain elongation in DnaG. The opening of the cleft is lined by several highly conserved basic residues: Arg146, Arg221, and Lys229. These residues are part of the electrostatically positive ridge of the N-terminal subdomain. It is this ridge that interacts with the ssDNA and helps guide it into the cleft, which consists of the metal binding center of the toprim motif on the central subdomain, and the conserved primase motifs of the N-terminal domain. The metal binding site of the toprim domain is where the primer is synthesized. The RNA:DNA duplex then exits through another basic depression.

=== C-Terminal Domain ===

Unlike both the zinc-binding domains, and the RNA polymerase domains, the C-terminal domains of DNA primases are not conserved. In prokaryotic primases, the only known function of this domain is to interact with the helicase, DnaB. Thus, this domain is called the helicase binding domain (HBD). The HBD of DnaG consists of two subdomains: a helical bundle, the C1 subdomain, and a helical hairpin, the C2 subdomain. For each of the two to three DnaG molecules that bind the DnaB hexamer, the C1 subdomains of the HBDs interact with DnaB at its N-terminal domains on the inner surface of the hexamer ring, while the C2 subdomains interact with the N-terminal domains on the outer surface of the hexamer.

Three residues in &quot;B. stearothermophilus&quot; DnaB have been identified as important for formation of the DnaB, DnaG interface. Those residues include Tyr88, Ile119, and Ile125. Tyr88 is close in proximity to, but does not make contact with, the HBD of DnaG. Mutation of Tyr88 inhibits the formation of the N-terminal domain helical bundle of DnaB, interrupting the contacts with the HBD of DnaG. The hexameric structure of DnaB is really a trimer of dimers. Both Ile119 and Ile125 are buried in the N-terminal domain dimer interface of DnaB and mutation of these residues inhibits formation of the hexameric structure and thus the interaction with DnaG. One other residue that has been identified as playing a crucial role in the interaction of DnaB and DnaG is Glu15. Mutation of Glu15 does not disrupt the formation of the DnaB, DnaG complex, but instead plays a role in modulating the length of primers synthesized by DnaG.

==Inhibition of DnaG==
Inhibitors of DNA primases are valuable compounds for the elucidation of biochemical pathways and key interactions, but they are also of interest as lead compounds to design drugs against bacterial diseases. Most of the compounds known to inhibit primases are nucleotide analogs such as AraATP (see Vidarabine) and 2-fluoro-AraATP. These compounds will often be used as substrates by the primase, but once incorporated synthesis or elongation can no longer occur. For example, &quot;E. coli&quot; DnaG will use 2&#x27;,3&#x27;-dideoxynucleoside 5&#x27;-triphosphates (ddNTPs) as substrates, which act as chain terminators due to the lack of a 3&#x27; hydroxyl to form a phosphodiester bond with the next nucleotide.

The relatively small number of primase inhibitors likely reflects the inherent difficulty of primase assays rather than a lack of potential binding sites on the enzyme. The short length of products synthesized and the generally slow rate of the enzyme compared to other replication enzymes make developing high-throughput screening (HTS) approaches more difficult. Despite the difficulties, there are several known inhibitors of DnaG that are not NTP analogues. Doxorubicin and suramin are both DNA and NTP competitive inhibitors of &quot;Mycobacterium Tuberculosis&quot; DnaG. Suramin is also known to inhibit eukaryotic DNA primase by competing with GTP, so suramin is likely to inhibit DnaG via a similar mechanism.

<doc id="505501" wikidata="Q21119136" url="?curid=505501" title="DNA polymerase III holoenzyme">
<text>DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is the primary enzyme complex involved in prokaryotic DNA replication. It was discovered by Thomas Kornberg (son of Arthur Kornberg) and Malcolm Gefter in 1970. The complex has high processivity (i.e. the number of nucleotides added per binding event) and, specifically referring to the replication of the &quot;E.coli&quot; genome, works in conjunction with four other DNA polymerases (Pol I, Pol II, Pol IV, and Pol V). Being the primary holoenzyme involved in replication activity, the DNA Pol III holoenzyme also has proofreading capabilities that corrects replication mistakes by means of exonuclease activity reading 3&#x27;→5&#x27; and synthesizing 5&#x27;→3&#x27;. DNA Pol III is a component of the replisome, which is located at the replication fork.

==Components==

The replisome is composed of the following:
*2 DNA Pol III enzymes, each comprising α, ε and θ subunits. (It has been proven that there is a third copy of Pol III at the replisome.)
**the α subunit (encoded by the dnaE gene) has the polymerase activity.
**the ε subunit (dnaQ) has 3&#x27;→5&#x27; exonuclease activity.
**the θ subunit (holE) stimulates the ε subunit&#x27;s proofreading.
*2 β units (dnaN) which act as sliding DNA clamps, they keep the polymerase bound to the DNA.
*2 τ units (dnaX) which act to dimerize two of the core enzymes (α, ε, and θ subunits).
*1 γ unit (also dnaX) which acts as a clamp loader for the lagging strand Okazaki fragments, helping the two β subunits to form a unit and bind to DNA. The γ unit is made up of 5 γ subunits which include 3 γ subunits, 1 δ subunit (holA), and 1 δ&#x27; subunit (holB). The δ is involved in copying of the lagging strand.
* Χ (holC) and Ψ (holD) which form a 1:1 complex and bind to γ or τ. X can also mediate the switch from RNA primer to DNA.

==Activity==
DNA polymerase III synthesizes base pairs at a rate of around 1000 nucleotides per second. DNA Pol III activity begins after strand separation at the origin of replication. Because DNA synthesis cannot start &quot;de novo&quot;, an RNA primer, complementary to part of the single-stranded DNA, is synthesized by primase (an RNA polymerase):

===Addition onto 3&#x27;OH===
As replication progresses and the replisome moves forward, DNA polymerase III arrives at the RNA primer and begins replicating the DNA, adding onto the 3&#x27;OH of the primer:

===Synthesis of DNA===
DNA polymerase III will then synthesize a continuous or discontinuous strand of DNA, depending if this is occurring on the leading or lagging strand (Okazaki fragment) of the DNA. DNA polymerase III has a high processivity and therefore, synthesizes DNA very quickly. This high processivity is due in part to the β-clamps that &quot;hold&quot; onto the DNA strands.

===Removal of primer===
After replication of the desired region, the RNA primer is removed by DNA polymerase I via the process of nick translation. The removal of the RNA primer allows DNA ligase to ligate the DNA-DNA nick between the new fragment and the previous strand. DNA polymerase I &amp; III, along with many other enzymes are all required for the high fidelity, high-processivity of DNA replication.

<text>Jennifer Noel Wyatt (born December 10, 1965) is a Canadian professional golfer who played on the LPGA Tour.

Wyatt was born in Vancouver, British Columbia and starting playing golf at an early age in Richmond, British Columbia out of the Quilchena Golf &amp; Country Club In 1983 she was the medalist at the 1983 Women&#x27;s Western Junior Golf Championship and in 1984 she was the British Columbia Junior champion and ranked as the second best junior golfer in Canada. From 1985–1987, she was the number one ranked player in Canada. In 1987, she was a member of the gold-medal winning team at the Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, New Zealand. She attended Lamar University on a full scholarship and played on the Lamar golf team in the NCAA for five years before graduating in 1988 with a degree in Graphic Design.

Wyatt joined the LPGA Tour in 1989 after qualifying on her first try, and played on tour until 1998. During her 10 years on tour she won one tournament, made US$372,471, and was the ranked the 7th best putter in 1996 and the 4th best in sand saves in the same year.

In the off-season, she competed on the ALPG Tour (Australian Ladies Professional Golf Tour) from 1988 to 1995. She had one win on the ALPG tour and nine top-10 finishes in her eight seasons on the tour.

<doc id="505525" wikidata="Q1154692" url="?curid=505525" title="DNase footprinting assay">
<text>A DNase footprinting assay is a DNA footprinting technique used in molecular biology/biochemistry that detects DNA-protein interaction by leveraging the fact that a protein bound to DNA often protects it from enzymatic cleavage. This makes it possible to locate a protein binding site on a particular DNA molecule. The method uses an enzyme, deoxyribonuclease (DNase, for short), to cut the end-labeled DNA radioactively, followed by gel electrophoresis to detect the resulting cleavage pattern.

For example, the DNA fragment of interest may be amplified by PCR using a 32P 5&#x27; labeled primer, with the result being many DNA molecules with a radioactive label on one end of one strand of each double-stranded molecule. Cleavage by DNase will produce fragments. The smaller fragments, relative to the 32P-labelled end, will appear further on the gel than the longer fragments. The gel is then placed against a special photographic film to detect the radioactive signal.

The cleavage pattern of the DNA in the absence of a DNA binding protein (typically referred to as free DNA) is compared to that in the presence of a DNA binding protein. If the protein binds to DNA, the binding site is protected from enzymatic cleavage. This protection will result in a clear area on the gel that is referred to as the &quot;footprint&quot;.

By varying the concentration of the DNA-binding protein, the binding affinity of the protein can be estimated according to the minimum concentration of protein at which a footprint is observed.

This technique was developed in 1977 by David J. Galas and Albert Schmitz at the University of Geneva.

<text>HAKMEM, alternatively known as AI Memo 239, is a February 1972 &quot;memo&quot; (technical report) of the MIT AI Lab containing a wide variety of hacks, including useful and clever algorithms for mathematical computation, some number theory and schematic diagrams for hardware – in Guy L. Steele&#x27;s words, &quot;a bizarre and eclectic potpourri of technical trivia&quot;.
Contributors included about two dozen members and associates of the AI Lab. The title of the report is short for &quot;hacks memo&quot;, abbreviated to six upper case characters that would fit in a single PDP-10 machine word (using a six-bit character set).

== History ==
HAKMEM is notable as an early compendium of algorithmic technique, particularly for its practical bent, and as an illustration of the wide-ranging interests of AI Lab people of the time, which included almost anything other than AI research.

HAKMEM contains original work in some fields, notably continued fractions.

<doc id="505527" wikidata="Q732266" url="?curid=505527" title="Terrell Davis">
<text>Terrell Lamar Davis (born October 28, 1972) is an American former professional football player who was a running back for the Denver Broncos of the National Football League (NFL) from 1995 to 2001. He is the Broncos all-time leading rusher and still holds the record for most postseason single-season touchdowns (eight), which he achieved in 1997. He is also credited with starting the &quot;Mile High Salute&quot;, a celebratory tradition among Denver Broncos players after scoring a touchdown. Davis was elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017. Despite his short seven-year tenure (with four full seasons), Davis is often regarded as one of the greatest running backs of all time.

Davis was selected by the Broncos in the sixth round (196th pick overall) of the 1995 NFL draft. He is the Denver Broncos&#x27; all-time leading rusher, with 7,607 rushing yards. Davis still holds the NFL record for most rushing touchdowns in a single postseason, scoring eight in the 1997 playoffs, culminating in him winning the Super Bowl MVP award. In 1998, he became only the fourth NFL player to rush for over 2,000 yards in a season. As a player, he was given the nickname &quot;T. D.&quot; by players, fans and the media; this denoted both the initials of his first and last name as well as being an abbreviation for &quot;touchdown&quot;.

==Early life==
Davis was born to nurse Kateree Davis, a mother of eight children, and father Joe Davis. His father died when Terrell was 14 years old.

In his senior year at Lincoln High School, the coaches gave him a chance at fullback, in a three-back formation. He was given playing time in other positions, including kicker, and helped lead his team to a 12–2 record. Davis set the Lincoln Prep record in the discus throw as a member of the track team. After graduation, Davis went on to play baseball at Long Beach State University. His brother Reggie Webb was a tailback there before him, and he persuaded the school to grant Davis a scholarship.

==College career==
At Long Beach State, Davis joined the football team that was coached by former Washington Redskins coach George Allen. He redshirted his freshman year in order to give him an extra year of eligibility. Davis never played an official game for coach Allen because Allen died after the end of the 1990 season. Davis played the following season and rushed for 262 yards on 55 carries.

Long Beach State eliminated its football program due to budget concerns at the end of the 1991 season. Davis transferred to the University of Georgia. During his first season with the Bulldogs, Davis backed up future NFL starting running back Garrison Hearst. After Hearst graduated, Davis became the top running back during the 1993 season, and rushed for 824 yards on 167 carries. Davis&#x27; senior season at Georgia got off to a rocky start when he aggravated a tear in his hamstring muscle against Tennessee early in the season, which took him out of the lineup for three games. Davis ran for 445 yards on 67 carries that year, but in his last two games, he rushed for 113 and 121 yards, respectively. After the season, he was invited to the Blue–Gray Football Classic game. Davis&#x27; reputation for being injury-prone hurt his standing in the NFL draft, along with the fact that Coach Goff denied scouts game film of Davis. Davis graduated from the University of Georgia with a Bachelor of Science degree in Consumer Economics.

===Statistics===
==Professional career==

In 1995, newly appointed Denver Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan drafted Davis in the sixth round of the 1995 NFL Draft. Davis entered training camp as the sixth string tailback and was a longshot to make the team. He managed to impress the Broncos coaching staff after his second pre-season game, most notably with a crushing hit as a member of special teams. Davis kept improving with each pre-season game and was promoted to starting running back for the season&#x27;s opening game. With Davis at running back, the Broncos possessed the potent running attack that they had previously lacked. Davis started 14 games during the 1995 season, carrying the ball 237 times, averaging 4.7 yards per run, and scoring eight touchdowns. Davis finished his season with a total of 1,117 rushing yards, becoming the lowest drafted player to ever gain over 1,000 yards rushing in his rookie season.

In 1996, Davis signed, what was at that time a lucrative new five-year contract with the Broncos that was worth $6.8 million. That season, he rushed for a total of 1,538 yards and set a Denver Broncos record for rushing touchdowns with 13. The Broncos ended that season with a 13–3 record, tied with the Green Bay Packers for the best in the NFL that year. In the postseason, Davis ran for 6.5 yards per attempt in a loss to Jacksonville. Davis was selected as a first-team All-Pro and Pro Bowl for the first of three consecutive seasons.

===1997, Super Bowl XXXII===

In 1997, Davis broke his own records with 1,750 yards and a league-leading 15 rushing touchdowns. The 12–4 Broncos again faced Jacksonville in their first playoff game; this time Davis had 184 yards rushing and 2 touchdowns in the 42–17 blowout. By rushing for over 100 yards rushing in all four of Denver&#x27;s postseason games, Davis joined John Riggins as the only player to rush for over 100 yards a game four times in a single postseason. Additionally, Davis was named Super Bowl MVP in Super Bowl XXXII against the then-world champion Green Bay Packers, with 157 rushing yards and a Super Bowl record three rushing touchdowns despite having to sit out the second quarter due to a migraine. Prior to this 31–24 victory, the Broncos had lost each of their four previous Super Bowl appearances, and the AFC had a 13-year losing streak.

===1998, Super Bowl XXXIII===

In 1998, Davis rushed for 2,008 yards becoming a member of the 2000 rushing yards club, the fourth-highest rushing total in history at the time. This performance earned him league MVP honors, his third straight AFC rushing title, his first NFL rushing title, and his second time being named NFL Offensive Player of the Year by the Associated Press. At the end of the season, the Broncos beat the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII, with Davis recording 102 rushing yards and 50 receiving yards.

Super Bowl XXXIII was the last postseason game in which Davis would play. In his 8 postseason games from 1996 to 1998, his numbers were staggering: 204 carries for 1,140 yards and 12 touchdowns, along with 19 receptions for 131 yards. This included a streak of 7 consecutive games with over 100 rushing yards, all of which the Broncos won, breaking the previous record for consecutive 100 rushing yard postseason games held by John Riggins (6). Even in the sole playoff game in which Davis didn&#x27;t gain 100 rushing yards, he still had an impressive performance, rushing for 91 yards and a touchdown and catching 7 passes for 27 yards.

Davis was sent to the Pro Bowl in the 1996, 1997, and 1998 seasons. Nicknamed &quot;TD&quot;, Davis popularized the &quot;Mile High Salute&quot;, a military-style salute given to fans and teammates in celebration of a touchdown; Davis explained in 2017 that he felt the &quot;mentality&quot; needed to play running back was similar to that for soldiers, and the gesture was a &quot;sign of respect&quot; for service members.

===Later career===
After the 1998 season, Davis was plagued with injuries and saw action infrequently. In 1999, Davis tore the anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament of his right knee while trying to make a tackle on an interception thrown against the New York Jets, during the fourth game of the season. This injury kept him out for the remainder of the year.

In the 2000 season, Davis was sidelined for all but five games because of a stress reaction injury in his lower leg. In 2001, he only played in eight games because of arthroscopic surgery on both knees.

Davis retired during the preseason of 2002. He walked through the tunnel in uniform for the final time during a preseason Denver–San Francisco 49ers matchup held at Invesco Field at Mile High. To a standing ovation, he gave a mile-high salute to the fans and was hugged by his teammates. After walking to midfield as the lone Broncos player at the coin toss, Davis retreated to the sideline. He spent the second half in street clothes. The following week, upon his request, he was placed on injured reserve, ending his season and effectively ending his career.

Through his first four seasons, Davis rushed for 6,413 yards (4.8 yards per carry) and 56 touchdowns. Among the 24 modern-era Hall of Fame halfbacks and fullbacks, only Earl Campbell (6,457, 4.6 yards per carry) and Eric Dickerson (6,968, 4.8 yards per carry) had more rushing yards during their first four seasons; no member of the Hall of Fame matched Davis&#x27; first-four-season 56 rushing touchdowns. Davis was selected for ESPN&#x27;s All-Time 40-Man Super Bowl roster as a running back for his performances in Super Bowls XXXII and XXXIII.

Overall, Davis finished his seven NFL seasons with 7,607 rushing yards, 169 receptions for 1,280 yards, and 65 touchdowns (60 rushing and 5 receiving). He, John Elway, and Peyton Manning are the only three Broncos to be named league MVP. Davis is one of only six players ever to rush for more than 1,000 yards in the postseason (1,140), and out of the six he is the only one to do so in a career that lasted less than 12 seasons. Davis finished his career with 12 playoff rushing touchdowns, good for fourth all-time tied with Marshawn Lynch and John Riggins.

==Honors and awards==

In 2004, Davis was inducted into the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame. Davis was one of the semifinalists for the 2007 Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.

On July 27, 2007, it was announced that Davis would be inducted into the Denver Broncos Ring of Fame. His induction ceremony took place at Invesco Field at Mile High on September 23, 2007, in a Broncos home game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. In 2006, Davis was inducted into the Breitbard Hall of Fame. On February 7, 2016, Davis and John Elway served as the Broncos&#x27; honorary captains at Super Bowl 50 in Santa Clara, California. They also appeared at the pre-game ceremony honoring the past 50 Super Bowl MVPs. Davis was also one of the players who did the Trophy Presentation when the Broncos won the Super Bowl. On August 4, 2017, Davis was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his eleventh year of eligibility.

==Television career==
After playing in the NFL, Davis worked for NFL Network as a correspondent and studio host for NFL Total Access. He also served as a color commentator for some NFL Europe games covered by NFL Network.

===Other appearances===
Davis appeared on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in a skit with Elmo, Telly Monster, and a talking football. Elmo called Davis &quot;the man&quot; and Davis responded, &quot;Thank you, thank you. I try!&quot; The episode was filmed in December 1998 in New York, and Davis said on the episode of &quot;America&#x27;s Game: The Super Bowl Champions&quot; profiling the 1998 Broncos that he was originally supposed to film the episode the day after Denver&#x27;s Week 15 matchup with the New York Giants which was played in Giants Stadium in New Jersey. The plan was for Davis to stay behind in New York for the day while the rest of the team flew home, assuming that the Broncos would win. However, because the Giants defeated the Broncos, Davis had to return to Denver for a Monday practice/film session with the team and then fly back to New York the next day to film his parts.

Davis guest-starred on Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;The Jersey&quot;, in an episode called &quot;They Say It&#x27;s Your Birthday&quot; along with other sports stars Shannon Sharpe, Tim Brown, Hardy Nickerson, and Tony Siragusa. The episode originally aired on October 21, 2000.

Davis appeared on the season 5 finale of the sitcom &quot;Sister, Sister&quot; at the twins&#x27; graduation to give a speech.

Davis appeared on the August 29, 2008 episode of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; to analyze the acceptance speech given by U.S. Democratic Party nominee Barack Obama at Invesco Field at Mile High a day earlier.

In 2023, Davis made a special guest appearance on an episode of Paramount Network&#x27;s &quot;Bar Rescue&quot;, hosted by Jon Taffer, along with current NFL players Courtland Sutton, Justin Simmons, Kareem Jackson, and Bradley Chubb.

==Personal life==
Davis resides in Temecula, California, with his wife Tamiko Nash. They have three children: sons Jackson and Myles, and daughter Dylan. He wrote an autobiography, &quot;TD: Dreams in Motion&quot;, after his first Super Bowl victory. A chapter was later added to the book covering his NFL MVP season and second championship win.

Davis was on the cover of the video game &quot;NFL GameDay 99&quot; by 989 Sports. He made an appearance in &quot;Madden NFL 2006&quot;, serving as the player&#x27;s mentor in the new NFL Superstar Mode and adds his voice to the game.

===Legal disputes===
In 2001, Davis was named in the Atlanta&#x27;s Gold Club federal prostitution, fraud and racketeering trial. The owner, Steve Kaplan, initially denied accusations of arranging dancers for athletes, claiming that he was unaware of any sexual encounters. Employee Jana Pelnis testified that she had sex with Davis in the club. Kaplan later pleaded guilty and was fined $5 million. A sentence of three years in jail was put on the table, but Kaplan instead received a sentence of 16 months and 400 hours of community service. Davis was never charged with any criminal wrongdoing. However, Campbell Soups dropped him from their advertising shortly thereafter.

In September 2006, Davis filed a lawsuit against Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Co. for breach of contract over its refusal to defend him in a lawsuit related to a tussle at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. In the lawsuit against the hotel, Davis claimed he was assaulted by two bouncers during a party at the hotel&#x27;s Tropicana Bar in October 2005. Davis said he suffered a bruised neck and damage to a surgically repaired hip. Davis and the insurance company reached a settlement, so the case was dismissed in January 2007.

In July 2024, Davis was accused of hitting a United Airlines flight attendant while traveling with his wife and children from Denver. When the plane arrived at John Wayne Airport in California, an FBI agent placed him in handcuffs and removed him from the plane. After interviewing Davis and other passengers, the FBI released him from custody when it was determined the flight attendant had made an inaccurate accusation. United apologized for the incident and claimed it took the flight attendant &quot;out of rotation&quot; while the matter was investigated. On July 23, Davis&#x27; legal team released a video of their client being removed from the plane and said it would be filing a lawsuit against United. By July 30, United said the flight attendant was no longer employed with the company and Davis had been removed from its no-fly list.

<doc id="505528" wikidata="Q862150" url="?curid=505528" title="Bill Gosper">
<text>Ralph William Gosper Jr. (born April 26, 1943), known as Bill Gosper, is an American mathematician and programmer. Along with Richard Greenblatt, he may be considered to have founded the hacker community, and he holds a place of pride in the Lisp community. The Gosper curve and Gosper&#x27;s algorithm are named after him.

==Becoming a hacker==
In high school, Gosper was interested in model rockets until one of his friends was injured in a rocketry accident and contracted a fatal brain infection. Gosper enrolled in MIT in 1961, and he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics from MIT in 1965 despite becoming disaffected with the mathematics department because of their anti-computer attitude.

In his second year at MIT, Gosper took a programming course from John McCarthy and became affiliated with the MIT AI Lab.

His contributions to computational mathematics include HAKMEM and the MIT Maclisp system. He made major contributions to Macsyma, Project MAC&#x27;s computer algebra system. Gosper later worked with Symbolics and Macsyma, Inc. on commercial versions of Macsyma.

In 1974, he moved to Stanford University, where he lectured, and worked with Donald Knuth.

Since that time, he has worked at or consulted for Xerox PARC, Symbolics, Wolfram Research, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, and Macsyma Inc.

==Key contributions==

===Conway&#x27;s Game of Life===

He became intensely interested in the Game of Life shortly after John Horton Conway had proposed it. Conway conjectured the existence of infinitely growing patterns, and offered a reward for an example. Gosper was the first to find such a pattern, the glider gun, and won the prize. Gosper was also the originator of the Hashlife algorithm that can speed up the computation of Life patterns by many orders of magnitude.

===Packing problems===
Gosper has created numerous packing problem puzzles, such as &quot;Twubblesome Twelve&quot;.

===Symbolic computation===
Gosper was the first person to realize the possibilities of symbolic computation on a computer as a mathematics research tool, whereas computer methods were previously limited to purely numerical methods. In particular, this research resulted in his work on continued fraction representations of real numbers and Gosper&#x27;s algorithm for finding closed form hypergeometric identities.

In 1985, Gosper briefly held the world record for computing the most digits of pi with 17 million digits. See chronology of computation of π.

===Space-filling curves===
In the continuity of early 20th century examples of space-filling curves—the Koch-Peano curve, Cesàro and Lévy C curve, all special cases of the general de Rham curve—and following the path of Benoit Mandelbrot, Gosper discovered the Peano-Gosper curve, before engaging with variations on the Harter-Heighway dragon. In the late 80s, Gosper independently discovered the Gosper-Lafitte triangle.

<text>Language transfer is the application of linguistic features from one language to another by a bilingual or multilingual speaker. Language transfer may occur across both languages in the acquisition of a simultaneous bilingual. It may also occur from a mature speaker&#x27;s first language (L1) to a second language (L2) they are acquiring, or from an L2 back to the L1. Language transfer (also known as L1 interference, linguistic interference, and [[crosslinguistic influence]]) is most commonly discussed in the context of English language learning and teaching, but it can occur in any situation when someone does not have a native-level command of a language, as when translating into a second language. Language transfer is also a common topic in bilingual child language acquisition as it occurs frequently in bilingual children especially when one language is dominant.

==Types of language transfer==

When the relevant unit or structure of both languages is the same, linguistic interference can result in correct language production called &quot;positive transfer&quot;: here, the &quot;correct&quot; meaning is in line with most native speakers&#x27; notions of acceptability. An example is the use of cognates. However, language interference is most often discussed as a source of errors known as &quot;negative transfer&quot;, which can occur when speakers and writers transfer items and structures that are not the same in both languages.

===Negative transfer===
Within the theory of contrastive analysis, the systematic study of a pair of languages with a view to identifying their structural differences and similarities, the greater the differences between the two languages, the more negative transfer can be expected. For example, in English, a preposition is used before a day of the week: &quot;I&#x27;m going to the beach &quot;on&quot; Friday.&quot; In Spanish, instead of a preposition the definite article is used: &quot;Voy a la playa el viernes.&quot; Novice Spanish students who are native English-speakers may produce a transfer error and use a preposition when it is not necessary because of their reliance on English. According to Whitley, it is natural for students to make such errors based on how the English words are used. Another typical example of negative transfer concerns German students trying to learn English, despite being part of the same Germanic language family. Since the German noun &quot;Information&quot; can also be used in the plural – &quot;Informationen&quot; – German students will almost invariably use &quot;informations&quot; in English, too, which would break the rules of uncountable nouns.
From a more general standpoint, Brown mentions &quot;all new learning involves transfer based on previous learning&quot;. That could also explain why initial learning of L1 will impact L2 acquisition.

===Positive transfer===
The results of positive transfer go largely unnoticed and so are less often discussed. Nonetheless, such results can have an observable effect. Generally speaking, the more similar the two languages are and the more the learner is aware of the relation between them, the more positive transfer will occur. For example, an Anglophone learner of German may correctly guess an item of German vocabulary from its English counterpart, but word order, phonetics, connotations, collocation, and other language features are more likely to differ. That is why such an approach has the disadvantage of making the learner more subject to the influence of &quot;false friends&quot;, words that seem similar between languages but differ significantly in meaning. This influence is especially common among learners who misjudge the relation between languages or mainly rely on visual learning.

In addition to positive transfer potentially resulting in correct language production and negative transfer resulting in errors, there is some evidence that any transfer from the first language can result in a kind of technical, or analytical, advantage over native (monolingual) speakers of a language. For example, L2 speakers of English whose first language is Korean have been found to be more accurate with perception of unreleased stops in English than native English speakers who are functionally monolingual because of the different status of unreleased stops in Korean from English. That &quot;native-language transfer benefit&quot; appears to depend on an alignment of properties in the first and the second languages that favors the linguistic biases of the first language, rather than simply the perceived similarities between two languages.

==Conscious and unconscious transfer==

Language transfer may be conscious or unconscious. Consciously, learners or unskilled translators may sometimes guess when producing speech or text in a second language because they have not learned or have forgotten its proper usage. Unconsciously, they may not realize that the structures and internal rules of the languages in question are different. Such users could also be aware of both the structures and internal rules, yet be insufficiently skilled to put them into practice, and consequently often fall back on their first language. The unconscious aspect to language transfer can be demonstrated in the case of the so-called &quot;transfer-to-nowhere&quot; principle put forward by Eric Kellerman, which addressed language based on its conceptual organization instead of its syntactic features. Here, language determines how the speaker conceptualizes experience, with the principle describing the process as an unconscious assumption that is subject to between-language variation. Kellerman explained that it is difficult for learners to acquire the construal patterns of a new language because &quot;learners may not look for the perspectives peculiar to the [target/L2] language; instead they may seek the linguistic tools which will permit them to maintain their L1 perspective.&quot;

The conscious transfer of language, on the other hand, can be illustrated in the principle developed by Roger Andersen called &quot;transfer-to-somewhere,&quot; which holds that &quot;a language structure will be susceptible to transfer only if it is compatible with natural acquisitional principles or is perceived to have similar counterpart (a somewhere to transfer to) in the recipient language.&quot; This is interpreted as a heuristic designed to make sense of the target language input by assuming a form of awareness on the part of the learner to map L1 onto the L2. An analogy that can describe the differences between the Kellerman&#x27;s and Anderson&#x27;s principles is that the former is concerned with the conceptualization that fuels the drive towards discovering the means of linguistic expression whereas Andersen&#x27;s focused on the acquisition of those means.

== Acceleration and deceleration ==
The theories of acceleration and deceleration are bilingual child language acquisition theories based on the known norms of monolingual acquisition. These theories come from comparisons of bilingual children&#x27;s acquisition to that of their monolingual peers of similar backgrounds.

Acceleration is a process similar to that of bootstrapping, where a child acquiring language uses knowledge and skills from one language to aid in, and speed up their acquisition of the other language.

Deceleration is a process in which a child experiences negative effects (more mistakes and slower language learning) on their language acquisition due to interference from their other language.

== Literacy development ==
Language transfer is often referred to as &quot;cross-language transfer&quot;, the ability to use skills acquired in one language and to use those skills to facilitate learning of a new language. Cross-language transfer has been researched and analyzed by many scholars over the years, but the focus on cross-language transfer in literacy research expanded in the 1990s. It is a topic that has been gaining lots of interest from scholars due to the increasing number of bilingual and multilingual people, especially students, around the world. In the USA alone, English Language Learners (ELL) account for over 10% of the students enrolled in public schools.

The Linguistic Interdependence Hypothesis claims that language transfer can occur from L1 (First language) to L2 (Second language), but there first must be a level of proficiency in L1 literacy skills for the skills to transfer over into L2. In other words, there must be some prior knowledge of literacy skills in L1 to assist with acquiring literacy skills in  L2. The acquisition of L2 literacy skills can be facilitated and gained with greater ease by having more time, access, and experience  with L1 literary skills. Over time, through formal exposure and practice with literacy skills, L2 learners have been able to catch up with their monolingual peers. However, literacy skills acquired in L2 can also be used to assist with literacy skills in L1 because cross-language transfer is bidirectional.

Most studies have indicated that literacy cross-language transfer can occur regardless of the L1 and the L2 languages, but Chung et al. (2012) state that cross-language transfer is less likely to occur when the languages do not share similar orthography systems. For example, using literacy skills acquired in English may be accessed and used with more ease in Spanish because English and Spanish follow similar orthography (they use letters). Whereas, using literacy skills acquired in English to facilitate ease of learning Korean would be more difficult because those languages do not follow a similar orthography system (English uses letters, and Korean uses symbols).

Cross-language transfer can also occur with deaf bilinguals who use sign language and read written words. People may think that both American Sign Language (ASL) and English are the same language, but they are not. According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communications Disorders  &quot;“ASL is a language completely separate and distinct from English. It contains all the fundamental features of language, with its own rules for pronunciation, word formation, and word order&quot;&quot;. Because sign languages are considered to be their own language, most deaf people are considered to be bilingual because they speak in one language (sign language) and read in other (English, Spanish, Arabic, etc.). It should also be noted that not all sign languages are the same. The sign languages are American Sign Language (ASL), Mexican Sign Language (LSM), British Sign Language (BSL), Spanish Sign Language (LSE), and many more.  

==In comprehension==

Transfer can also occur in polyglot individuals when comprehending verbal utterances or written language. For instance, German and English both have relative clauses with a noun-noun-verb (=NNV) order but which are interpreted differently in both languages:

German example: &quot;Das Mädchen, das die Frau küsst, ist blond&quot;

If translated word for word with word order maintained, this German relative clause is equivalent to

English example: &quot;The girl that &quot;(or &quot;whom&quot;)&quot; the woman is kissing is blonde.&quot;

The German and the English examples differ in that in German the subject role can be taken by &quot;das Mädchen&quot; (the girl) or &quot;die Frau&quot; (the woman) while in the English example only the second noun phrase (the woman) can be the subject. In short, because German singular feminine and neuter articles exhibit the same inflected form for the accusative as for the nominative case, the German example is syntactically ambiguous in that either &quot;the girl&quot; or &quot;the woman&quot; may be doing the kissing. In the English example, both word-order rules and the test of substituting a relative pronoun with different nominative and accusative case markings (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;whom&quot;/&quot;who&quot;*) reveal that only &quot;the woman&quot; can be doing the kissing.

The ambiguity of the German NNV relative clause structure becomes obvious in cases where the assignment of subject and object role is disambiguated. This can be because of case marking if one of the nouns is grammatically male as in &quot;Der Mann, den die Frau küsst...&quot; (The man that the woman is kissing...) vs. &quot;Der Mann, der die Frau küsst&quot; (The man that is kissing the woman...) because in German the male definite article marks the accusative case. The syntactic ambiguity of the German example also becomes obvious in the case of semantic disambiguation. For instance in &quot;Das Eis, das die Frau isst...&quot; (The ice cream that the woman is eating...) and &quot;Die Frau, die das Eis isst...&quot; (The woman that is eating the ice cream...) only &quot;die Frau&quot; (the woman) is a plausible subject.

Because in English relative clauses with a noun-noun-verb structure (as in the example above) the first noun can only be the object, native speakers of English who speak German as a second language are likelier to interpret ambiguous German NNV relative clauses as object relative clauses (= object-subject-verb order) than German native speakers who prefer an interpretation in which the first noun phrase is the subject (subject-object-verb order). This is because they have transferred their parsing preference from their first language English to their second language German.

==Broader effects==
With sustained or intense contact between native and non-native speakers, the results of language transfer in the non-native speakers can extend to and affect the speech production of the native-speaking community. For example, in North America, speakers of English whose first language is Spanish or French may have a certain influence on native English speakers&#x27; use of language when the native speakers are in the minority. Locations where this phenomenon occurs frequently include Québec, Canada, and predominantly Spanish-speaking regions in the US. For details on the latter, see the map of the Hispanophone world and the list of U.S. communities with Hispanic majority populations. The process of translation can also lead to the so-called hybrid text, which is the mixing of language either at the level of linguistic codes or at the level of cultural or historical references.

<text>Pirate spiders, members of the family Mimetidae, are araneomorph spiders which typically feed on other spiders.

The family Mimetidae contains roughly 200 species divided among 12 genera, of which &quot;Mimetus&quot; and &quot;Ero&quot; are the most common. Mimetids are usually yellow and brown and are usually long. Mimetids can be recognized by the rows of spine-like hairs on their long front legs; the rows consist of a long spine, followed by a series of progressively shorter ones.

Mimetidae usually hunt by picking at the strands on their prey&#x27;s web to simulate the movements of either a trapped insect or a potential mate. When their prey comes to investigate, they are instead captured and eaten. Some mimetids have been observed to feed on insects as well. The spider-feeding habit presents problems in mating, and little is known about how the males court females to avoid being eaten. However, some male mimetids in the genus &quot;Gelanor&quot;, found in South America, have enormously long appendages which they use to inseminate females.

==Distribution==
Pirate spiders are found in forests all around the globe, wherein the highest diversity is found in Central and Tropical South America.

==Genera==
The categorization into subfamilies follows Joel Hallan&#x27;s Biology Catalog.

<text>A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation of whole blood components). A donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly (apheresis). Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.

Today in the developed world, most are unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a community supply. In some countries, established supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when family or friends need a transfusion (directed donation). Many donors donate for several reasons, such as a form of charity, general awareness regarding the demand for blood, increased confidence in oneself, helping a personal friend or relative, and social pressure. Despite the many reasons that people donate, not enough potential donors actively donate. However, this is reversed during disasters when blood donations increase, often creating an excess supply that will have to be later discarded. In countries that allow paid donation some people are paid, and in some cases there are incentives other than money such as paid time off from work. People can also have blood drawn for their own future use (autologous donation). Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have bruising where the needle is inserted or may feel faint.

Potential donors are evaluated for anything that might make their blood unsafe to use. The screening includes testing for diseases that can be transmitted by a blood transfusion, including HIV and viral hepatitis. The donor must also answer questions about medical history and take a short physical examination to make sure the donation is not hazardous to their health. How often a donor can donate varies from days to months based on what component they donate and the laws of the country where the donation takes place. For example, in the United States, donors must wait 56 days (eight weeks) between whole-blood donations but only seven days between platelet apheresis donations and twice per seven-day period in plasmapheresis.

The amount of blood drawn and the methods vary. The collection can be done manually or with automated equipment that takes only specific components of the blood. Most of the components of blood used for transfusions have a short shelf life, and maintaining a constant supply is a persistent problem. This has led to some increased interest in autotransfusion, whereby a patient&#x27;s blood is salvaged during surgery for continuous —or alternatively, is self-donated prior to when it will be needed. Generally, the notion of donation does not refer to giving to one&#x27;s self, though in this context it has become somewhat acceptably idiomatic.

== History ==

Charles Richard Drew (1904–1950) was an American surgeon and medical researcher. His research was in the field of blood transfusions, developing improved techniques for blood storage, and applied his expert knowledge to developing large-scale blood banks early in World War II. This allowed medics to save thousands of lives of the Allied forces. As the most prominent African American in the field, Drew protested against the practice of racial segregation in the donation of blood, as it lacked scientific foundation, and resigned his position with the American Red Cross, which maintained the policy until 1950.

== Types of donation ==

Blood donations are divided into groups based on who will receive the collected blood. An &quot;allogeneic&quot; (also called &quot;homologous&quot;) donation is when a donor gives blood for storage at a blood bank for transfusion to an unknown recipient. A &quot;directed&quot; donation is when a person, often a family member, donates blood for transfusion to a specific individual. Directed donations are relatively rare when an established supply exists. A &quot;replacement donor&quot; donation is a hybrid of the two and is common in developing countries. In this case, a friend or family member of the recipient donates blood to replace the stored blood used in a transfusion, ensuring a consistent supply. When a person has blood stored that will be transfused back to the donor at a later date, usually after surgery, that is called an &quot;autologous donation&quot;. Blood that is used to make medications can be made from allogeneic donations or from donations exclusively used for manufacturing.

Sometimes there are specific reasons for preferring one form or the other. Allogeneic donations have a lower risk of some complications than blood from a family member. Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia may require a transfusion from the mother&#x27;s own platelets. Autologous (self) donations may be preferred for someone with a rare blood type for a planned surgery.

Blood is sometimes collected using similar methods for therapeutic phlebotomy, similar to the ancient practice of bloodletting, which is used to treat conditions such as hereditary hemochromatosis or polycythemia vera. This blood is sometimes treated as a blood donation, but may be immediately discarded if it cannot be used for transfusion or further manufacturing.

The actual process varies according to the laws of the country, and recommendations to donors vary according to the collecting organization. The World Health Organization gives recommendations for blood donation policies, but in developing countries many of these are not followed. For example, the recommended testing requires laboratory facilities, trained staff, and specialized reagents, all of which may not be available or too expensive in developing countries.
A &quot;blood drive&quot; or a &quot;blood donor session&quot; is an event in which donors come to donate allogeneic blood. These can occur at a blood bank, but they are often set up at a location in the community, such as a shopping center, workplace, school, or house of worship.

==Screening==

Donors are typically required to give consent for the process, and meet a certain criteria such as weight and hemoglobin levels, and this requirement means minors cannot donate without permission from a parent or guardian. In some countries, answers are associated with the donor&#x27;s blood, but not name, to provide anonymity; in others, such as the United States, names are kept to create lists of ineligible donors. If a potential donor does not meet these criteria, they are &#x27;deferred&#x27;. This term is used because many donors who are ineligible may be allowed to donate later. Blood banks in the United States may be required to label the blood if it is from a therapeutic donor, so some do not accept donations from donors with any blood disease. Others, such as the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, accept blood from donors with hemochromatosis. It is a genetic disorder that does not affect the safety of the blood.

The donor&#x27;s race or ethnic background is sometimes important since certain blood types, especially rare ones, are more common in certain ethnic groups. Historically, in the United States donors were segregated or excluded on race, religion, or ethnicity, but this is no longer a standard practice.

===Recipient safety===


Donors are screened for health risks that could make the donation unsafe for the recipient. Some of these restrictions are controversial, such as restricting donations from men who have sex with men (MSM) because of the risk of transmitting HIV. In 2011, the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) reduced its blanket ban on MSM donors to a narrower restriction which only prevents MSM from donating blood if they have had sex with other men within the past year. A similar change was made in the US in late 2015 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In 2017, the UK and US further reduced their restrictions to three months. In 2023, the FDA announced new policies easing restrictions on gay and bisexual men donating blood. These updated guidelines stipulate that men in monogamous relationships with other men, or who have not recently had sex, can donate. Individuals who report having sex with people who are HIV positive or have had sex with a new partner who has engaged in anal sex are still barred from blood donation. Autologous donors are not always screened for recipient safety problems since the donor is the only person who will receive the blood. Since the donated blood may be given to pregnant women or women of child-bearing age, donors taking teratogenic (birth defect-causing) medications are deferred. These medications include acitretin, etretinate, isotretinoin, finasteride, and dutasteride.

Donors are examined for signs and symptoms of diseases that can be transmitted in a blood transfusion, such as HIV, malaria, and viral hepatitis. Screening may include questions about risk factors for various diseases, such as travel to countries at risk for malaria or variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD). These questions vary from country to country. For example, while blood centers in Québec and the rest of Canada, Poland, and many other places defer donors who lived in the United Kingdom for risk of vCJD, donors in the United Kingdom are only restricted for vCJD risk if they have had a blood transfusion in the United Kingdom. Australia removed its UK-donor deferral in July 2022.

Directed donations from family members (e.g., a father donating blood to his child) carry extra risks for the recipient. Any blood transfusion carries some risk of a transfusion reaction, but between genetically related family members, there are additional risks. The donated blood must be irradiated to prevent a potentially deadly graft-versus-host disease, which is more likely between genetically related people. Not all healthcare facilities have the equipment to do this on site. Alloimmunization is a particular risk for directed granulocyte donations. It is a common misconception that directed donations are safer for the recipient; however, family members and close friends, especially parents who have not previously donated blood, frequently feel pressured into lying about disqualifying risk factors (e.g., drug use or prior sexual relationships) and their eligibility, which can result in a higher risk of infection with bloodborne pathogens. Additionally, in the less common case of a person with leukemia or other bone marrow disease, a familial blood transfusion can trigger the production of alloantibodies against HLA proteins, which can cause a bone marrow transplant from that donor to fail in the future. (Closely related family members are usually the best match for a bone marrow transplant.) A directed donation from an unrelated friend, however, would not have the same risk.

===Donor safety===
The donor is also examined and asked specific questions about their medical history to make sure that donating blood is not hazardous to their health. The donor&#x27;s hematocrit or hemoglobin level is tested to make sure that the loss of blood will not make them anemic, and this check is the most common reason that a donor is ineligible. Accepted hemoglobin levels for blood donations, by the American Red Cross, is 12.5g/dL (for females) and 13.0g/dL (for males) to 20.0g/dL, anyone with a higher or lower hemoglobin level cannot donate. Pulse, blood pressure, and body temperature are also evaluated. Elderly donors are sometimes also deferred on age alone because of health concerns. In addition to age, weight and height are important factors when considering the eligibility for donors. For example, the American Red Cross requires a donor to be or more for whole blood and platelet donation and at least (males) and at least (females) for power red donations (double red erythrocytapheresis). The safety of donating blood during pregnancy has not been studied thoroughly, and pregnant women are usually deferred until six weeks after the pregnancy. Donors with aortic stenosis have traditionally been deferred out of concern that the acute volume depletion (475 mL) of blood donation might compromise cardiac output.

=== Blood testing ===

The donor&#x27;s blood type must be determined if the blood will be used for transfusions. The collecting agency usually identifies whether the blood is type A, B, AB, or O and the donor&#x27;s Rh (D) type and will screen for antibodies to less common antigens. More testing, including a crossmatch, is usually done before a transfusion. Type O negative is often cited as the &quot;universal donor&quot; but this only refers to red cell and whole blood transfusions. For plasma and platelet transfusions the system is reversed: AB positive is the universal platelet donor type while both AB positive and AB negative are universal plasma donor types.

Most blood is tested for diseases, including some STDs. The tests used are high-sensitivity screening tests and no actual diagnosis is made. Some of the test results are later found to be false positives using more specific testing. False negatives are rare, but donors are discouraged from using blood donation for the purpose of anonymous STD screening because a false negative could mean a contaminated unit. The blood is usually discarded if these tests are positive, but there are some exceptions, such as autologous donations. The donor is generally notified of the test result.

Donated blood is tested by many methods, but the core tests recommended by the World Health Organization are these four:
* Hepatitis B surface antigen
* Antibody to hepatitis C
* Antibody to HIV, usually subtypes 1 and 2
* Serologic test for syphilis

The WHO reported in 2006 that 56 out of 124 countries surveyed did not use these basic tests on all blood donations.

A variety of other tests for transfusion transmitted infections are often used based on local requirements. Additional testing is expensive, and in some cases the tests are not implemented because of the cost. These additional tests include other infectious diseases such as West Nile fever and babesiosis. Sometimes multiple tests are used for a single disease to cover the limitations of each test. For example, the HIV antibody test will not detect a recently infected donor, so some blood banks use a p24 antigen or HIV nucleic acid test in addition to the basic antibody test to detect infected donors. Cytomegalovirus is a special case in donor testing in that many donors will test positive for it. The virus is not a hazard to a healthy recipient, but it can harm infants and other recipients with weak immune systems.

Blood testing in the US takes at least 48 hours. Because of the time required for testing, directed donations are not practical in emergencies.

==Obtaining the blood==
There are two main methods of obtaining blood from a donor. The most frequent is to simply take the blood from a vein as whole blood. This blood is typically separated into parts, usually red blood cells and plasma, since most recipients (other than trauma patients) need only a specific component for transfusions.

The amount of blood donated in one session – generally called a &#x27;unit&#x27; – is defined by the WHO as 450 millilitres. Some countries like Canada follow this standard, but others have set their own rules, and sometimes there is variation even among different agencies within a country. For example, whole blood donations in the United States are in the 460–500 ml range, while those in the EU must be in the 400-500 ml range. Other countries have smaller units – India uses 350 ml, Singapore 350 or 450 ml, and Japan 200 or 400 ml. Historically, donors in the People&#x27;s Republic of China would donate only 200 ml, though larger 300 and 400 ml donations have become more common, particularly in northern China and for heavier donors. In any case, an additional 5-10 ml of blood may be collected separately for testing.

The other method is to draw blood from the donor, separate it using a centrifuge or a filter, store the desired part, and return the rest to the donor. This process is called apheresis, and it is often done with a machine specifically designed for this purpose. This process is especially common for plasma, platelets, and red blood cells.

For direct transfusions a vein can be used but the blood may be taken from an artery instead. In this case, the blood is not stored, but is pumped directly from the donor into the recipient. This was an early method for blood transfusion and is rarely used in modern practice. It was phased out during World War II because of problems with logistics, and doctors returning from treating wounded soldiers set up banks for stored blood when they returned to civilian life.

===Site preparation and drawing blood===

The blood is drawn from a large arm vein close to the skin, usually the median cubital vein on the inside of the elbow. The skin over the blood vessel is cleaned with an antiseptic such as iodine or chlorhexidine to prevent skin bacteria from contaminating the collected blood and also to prevent infections where the needle pierced the donor&#x27;s skin.

A large needle (16 to 17 gauge) is used to minimize shearing forces that may physically damage red blood cells as they flow through the needle. A tourniquet is sometimes wrapped around the upper arm to increase the pressure of the blood in the arm veins and speed up the process. The donor may also be prompted to hold an object and squeeze it repeatedly to increase the blood flow through the vein.

===Whole blood===

The most common method is collecting the blood from the donor&#x27;s vein into a container. The amount of blood drawn varies from 200 millilitres to 550 millilitres depending on the country, but 450 millilitres is typical. The blood is usually stored in a flexible plastic bag that also contains sodium citrate, phosphate, dextrose, and adenine. This combination keeps the blood from clotting and preserves it during storage up to 42 days. Other chemicals are sometimes added during processing.

The plasma from whole blood can be used to make plasma for transfusions or it can also be processed into other medications using a process called fractionation. This was a development of the dried plasma used to treat the wounded during World War II and variants on the process are still used to make a variety of other medications.

===Apheresis===
Apheresis is a blood donation method where the blood is passed through an apparatus that separates out one particular constituent and returns the remainder to the donor. Usually the component returned is the red blood cells, the portion of the blood that takes the longest to replace. Using this method an individual can donate plasma or platelets much more frequently than they can safely donate whole blood. These can be combined, with a donor giving both plasma and platelets in the same donation.

Platelets can also be separated from whole blood, but they must be pooled from multiple donations. From three to ten units of whole blood are required for a therapeutic dose. Plateletpheresis provides at least one full dose from each donation.

During a platelet donation, the blood is drawn from the patient and the platelets are separated from the other blood components. The remainder of the blood, red blood cells, plasma, and white blood cells are returned to the patient. This process is completed several times for a period of up to two hours to collect a single donation.

Plasmapheresis is frequently used to collect source plasma that is used for manufacturing into medications much like the plasma from whole blood. Plasma collected at the same time as plateletpheresis is sometimes called &quot;concurrent plasma&quot;.

Apheresis is also used to collect more red blood cells than usual in a single donation (commonly known as &quot;double reds&quot;) and to collect white blood cells for transfusion.
==Recovery and time between donations==

Donors are usually kept at the donation site for 10–15 minutes after donating since most adverse reactions take place during or immediately after the donation. Blood centers typically provide light refreshments, such as orange juice and cookies, or a lunch allowance to help the donor recover. The needle site is covered with a bandage and the donor is directed to keep the bandage on for several hours. In hot climates, donors are advised to avoid dehydration (strenuous exercise and games, alcohol) until a few hours after donation.

Donated plasma is replaced after 2–3 days. Red blood cells are replaced by bone marrow into the circulatory system at a slower rate, on average 36 days in healthy adult males. In one study, the range was 20 to 59 days for recovery. These replacement rates are the basis of how frequently a donor can donate blood.

Plasmapheresis and plateletpheresis donors can donate much more frequently because they do not lose significant amounts of red cells. The exact rate of how often a donor can donate differs from country to country. For example, plasmapheresis donors in the United States are allowed to donate large volumes twice a week and could nominally donate 83 litres (about 22 gallons) in a year, whereas the same donor in Japan may only donate every other week and could only donate about 16 litres (about 4 gallons) in a year.

Iron supplementation decreases the rates of donor deferral due to low hemoglobin, both at the first donation visit and at subsequent donations. Iron-supplemented donors have higher hemoglobin and iron stores. On the other hand, iron supplementation frequently causes diarrhea, constipation and epigastric abdominal discomfort. The long-term effects of iron supplementation without measurement of iron stores are unknown.

==Complications==
Donors are screened for health problems that would put them at risk for serious complications from donating. First-time donors, teenagers, and women are at a higher risk of a reaction.
One study showed that 2% of donors had an adverse reaction to donation. Most of these reactions are minor. A study of 194,000 donations found only one donor with long-term complications. In the United States, a blood bank is required to report any death that might possibly be linked to a blood donation. An analysis of all reports from October 2008 to September 2009 evaluated six events and found that five of the deaths were clearly unrelated to donation, and in the remaining case they found no evidence that the donation was the cause of death.
Hypovolemic reactions can occur because of a rapid change in blood pressure. Fainting is generally the worst problem encountered. Falls due to loss of consciousness may result in injuries in rare cases. The risk for developing dizziness with fainting is increased in female and young donors. 

The process has similar risks to other forms of phlebotomy. Bruising of the arm from the needle insertion is the most common concern. One study found that less than 1% of donors had this problem. A number of less common complications of blood donation are known to occur. These include arterial puncture, delayed bleeding, nerve irritation, nerve injury, tendon injury, thrombophlebitis, and allergic reactions.

Donors sometimes have adverse reactions to the sodium citrate used in apheresis collection procedures to keep the blood from clotting. Since the anticoagulant is returned to the donor along with blood components that are not being collected, it can bind the calcium in the donor&#x27;s blood and cause hypocalcemia. These reactions tend to cause tingling in the lips, but may cause convulsions, seizure, hypertension, or more serious problems. Donors are sometimes given calcium supplements during the donation to prevent these side effects.

In apheresis procedures, the red blood cells are returned. If this is done manually and the donor receives the blood from a different donor, a transfusion reaction can take place. Manual apheresis is extremely rare in the developed world because of this risk and automated procedures are as safe as whole blood donations.

The final risk to blood donors is from equipment that has not been properly sterilized. In most cases, the equipment that comes in direct contact with blood is discarded after use. Re-used equipment was a significant problem in China in the 1990s, and up to 250,000 blood plasma donors may have been exposed to HIV from shared equipment.

==Storage, supply and demand==
===Storage and blood shelf life===
The collected blood is usually stored in a blood bank as separate components, and some of these have short shelf lives. There are no storage methods to keep platelets for extended periods of time, though some were being studied as of 2008. The longest shelf life used for platelets is seven days.

Red blood cells (RBC), the most frequently used component, have a shelf life of 35–42 days at refrigerated temperatures. For (relatively rare) long-term storage applications, this can be extended by freezing the blood with a mixture of glycerol, but this process is expensive and requires an extremely cold freezer for storage. Plasma can be stored frozen for an extended period of time and is typically given an expiration date of one year and maintaining a supply is less of a problem.

===Demand for blood===

The American Red Cross states that in the United States, someone needs blood every two seconds, and someone needs platelets every thirty seconds. There is not a consistent demand for each blood type. One type of blood being in stock does not guarantee that another type is. Blood banks may have some units in stock but lack others, ultimately causing the patients that need units for specific blood types to have delayed or canceled procedures. Additionally, every year there is an increase of around 5-7% for transfusions without an increase of donors to balance it as well as a growing population of elderly people that will need more transfusions in the future without a predicted increase in donations to reflect those growing numbers. This was supported in 1998 where blood donations to the Red Cross increased to 8%, totaling 500,000 units but hospitals&#x27; need for donations increased by 11%.

Blood donations tend to always be high in demand with numerous accounts repeatedly stating periodic shortages over the decades. However, this trend is disrupted during national disasters. The trend demonstrates that people are donating the most during catastrophes when, arguably, donations are not as needed compared to periods without disasters. From 1988 to 2013, it has been reported that during every national disaster, there was a surplus of donations; a surplus that consisted of over 100 units. One of the most notable examples of this pattern was the September 11th attacks. A study observed that compared to the four weeks before September 11, there was an estimated increase of 18,700 donations from first-time donors for the first week after the attack: 4,000 was the average of donations from first-time donors before the attack which increased to about 22,700 donations; while repeat donors increased their donations by 10,000 per week: initially, donations were estimated to be around 16,400 which increased to 26,400 donations after September 11. Therefore, in the first week after the attack on 9/11, there was an overall estimated 28,700 increase in donations compared to the average weekly donations made four weeks prior to the attack. Increases in donations were observed in all blood donation centers, beginning on the day of the attack. While blood donations were above average after the first few weeks following 9/11, the number of donations fell from an estimated 49,000 donations in the first week to 26,000–28,000 donations between the second and fourth weeks after 9/11. Despite the substantial increase of donors, the rate that first-time donors would become repeat donors were the same before and after the attack.

The limited storage time means that it is difficult to have a stockpile of blood to prepare for a disaster. The subject was discussed at length after the September 11 attacks in the United States, and the consensus was that collecting during a disaster was impractical and that efforts should be focused on maintaining an adequate supply at all times. Blood centers in the U.S. often have difficulty maintaining even a three-day supply for routine transfusion demands.

===Donation levels===
The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes World Blood Donor Day on 14 June each year to promote blood donation. This is the birthday of Karl Landsteiner, the scientist who discovered the ABO blood group system. The theme of the 2012 World Blood Donor Day campaign, &quot;Every blood donor is a hero&quot; focuses on the idea that everyone can become a hero by giving blood. Based on data reported by 180 countries between 2011 and 2013, the WHO estimated that approximately 112.5 million units of blood were being collected annually.

In the United States it is estimated that 111 million citizens are eligible blood donors, or 37% of the population. However less than 10% of the 37% eligible blood donors donate annually. In the UK the NHS reports blood donation levels at &quot;only 4%&quot; while in Canada the rate is 3.5%.

==Donator&#x27;s incentive and deterrence==
Multiple studies have shown that the main reason people donate is due to prosocial motivators (e.g., altruism, selflessness, charity), general awareness regarding the demand for blood, increased confidence in oneself, helping a personal friend/relative, and social pressure. On the other hand, lack of blood donations can occur due to fear, lack of faith in the medical professionals, inconvenience, and the lack of consideration for donating, or perceived racial discrimination. Pathologist Leo McCarthy states that blood shortages routinely occur in the United States between July 4 and Labor day and between Christmas and New Year.

=== Donor health benefits ===
In patients prone to iron overload, blood donation prevents the accumulation of toxic quantities. Donating blood may reduce the risk of heart disease for men, but the link has not been firmly established and may be from selection bias because donors are screened for health problems.

Research published in 2012 demonstrated that in patients with metabolic syndrome, repeated blood donation is effective in reducing blood pressure, blood glucose, HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein ratio, and heart rate.

A study published in JAMA Network Open tracked PFAS levels in a clinical trial and showed that regular blood or plasma donations resulted in a significant reduction in PFAS levels for the participants.

===Donor compensation===

The World Health Organization set a goal in 1997 for all blood donations to come from unpaid volunteer donors, but as of 2006, only 49 of 124 countries surveyed had established this as a standard. Some countries, such as Tanzania, have made great strides in moving towards this standard, with 20 percent of donors in 2005 being unpaid volunteers and 80 percent in 2007, but 68 of 124 countries surveyed by WHO had made little or no progress. Most plasmapheresis donors in the United States are still paid for their donations. Donors are now paid between $25 and $50 per donation. In some countries, for example Brazil and the United Kingdom, it is illegal to receive any compensation, monetary or otherwise, for the donation of blood or other human tissues.

Regular donors are often given some sort of non-monetary recognition. Time off from work is a common benefit. For example, in Italy, blood donors receive the donation day as a paid holiday from work. In 2023, Poland introduced legislation that secured two days off work for employed persons when they donate - the donation day and the subsequent next day. Blood centers will also sometimes add incentives such as assurances that donors would have priority during shortages, free T-shirts, first aid kits, windshield scrapers, pens, and similar trinkets. There are also incentives for the people who recruit potential donors, such as prize drawings for donors and rewards for organizers of successful drives. Recognition of dedicated donors is common. For example, the Singapore Red Cross Society presents awards for voluntary donors who have made a certain number of donations under the Blood Donor Recruitment Programme starting with a &quot;bronze award&quot; for 25 donations. In Ireland the Irish Blood Transfusion Service awards a silver pin or pendant for 10 donations, a gold pin or pendant for 20 donations, a gold lapel pin for 50 donations while those reaching 100 donations attend a dinner ceremony where they are presented with a small porcelain statue depicting the logo of the IBTS (a pelican). The government of Malaysia also offers free outpatient and hospitalization benefits for blood donors, for example, 4 months of free outpatient treatment and hospitalization benefits after every donation. In Poland, after donating a specific amount of blood (18 litres for men and 15 for women), a person is gifted with the title of &quot;Distinguished Honorary Blood Donor&quot; as well as a medal. In addition, a popular privilege in larger Polish cities is the right to free use of public transport, but the conditions for obtaining a privilege may vary depending on the city. Also in Poland, Poznań&#x27;s theatre Teatr Nowy offers theatregoers standing discounts on theatre tickets. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many US blood centers advertised free COVID-19 antibody testing as an incentive to donate; however, these antibody tests were also useful for blood centers in determining which donors could be flagged for convalescent plasma donations.

Most allogeneic blood donors donate as an act of charity and do not expect to receive any direct benefit from the donation. The sociologist Richard Titmuss, in his 1970 book &quot;The Gift Relationship: From Human Blood to Social Policy&quot;, compared the merits of the commercial and non-commercial blood donation systems of the US and the UK, coming down in favor of the latter. The book became a bestseller in the US, resulting in legislation to regulate the private market in blood. The book is still referenced in modern debates about turning blood into a commodity. The book was republished in 1997 and the same ideas and principles are applied to analogous donation programs, such as organ donation and sperm donation.

In low-resource countries, directed donation from family members and friends is common, because there is no other realistic option. The practice causes ethical challenges, because the donor may feel coerced or may be receiving undisclosed payments. Additionally, relying on a social network means that people with large networks of healthy adults have a better chance of receiving life-saving treatment than people without the same social privileges.

<text>Prince Karim Al-Husseini Aga Khan (; 13 December 1936 – 4 February 2025), known as the Aga Khan IV (), was a religious leader, businessman, and socialite best known as the 49th imam of Isma&#x27;ilism from 1957 until his death in 2025. He inherited the Nizari imamate and the title of Aga Khan at the age of 20 upon the death of his grandfather, the Aga Khan III. He was also known by the religious title Mawlānā Hazar Imam by his Isma&#x27;ili followers.

The Aga Khan&#x27;s net worth was estimated at over US$13.3 billion by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in 2013. &quot;Forbes&quot; described the Aga Khan as one of the world&#x27;s fifteen richest royals. He was the founder and chairman of the Aga Khan Development Network, one of the largest private development networks in the world. The Aga Khan was a business magnate with citizenship of the UK, France, Switzerland, Portugal and Canada (honorary) as well as a racehorse owner and breeder.

From the time of his accession to the Imamate of the Nizari Ismailis in 1957, the Aga Khan was involved in complex political and economic changes which affected his followers, including the independence of African countries from colonial rule, the expulsion of Asians from Uganda, the independence of Central Asian countries such as Tajikistan from the former Soviet Union and the continuous turmoil in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

==Early life and education==
Aga Khan IV was born in Geneva, Switzerland, on 13 December 1936, as Prince Karim, the eldest son of Prince Aly Khan (1911–1960) and his first wife, Princess Taj-ud-dawlah Aga Khan, formerly Joan Yarde-Buller (1908–1997). His mother was the eldest daughter of the British peer John Yarde-Buller, 3rd Baron Churston.

The prince was declared healthy despite being born prematurely. His brother, Amyn Aga Khan, was born a year later in 1937. In 1949, his parents divorced in part due to Prince Aly Khan&#x27;s extramarital affairs, and shortly after, Prince Aly Khan married American actress Rita Hayworth – with whom he had a daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, the half-sister of Aga Khan IV.

The Aga Khan IV also had a half-brother, Patrick Benjamin Guinness (1931–1965), from his mother&#x27;s first marriage, as Joan Yarde-Buller was previously married to Loel Guinness of the banking Guinnesses.

Prince Karim spent the war years in Nairobi, Kenya, where his early education was by private tutoring. Prince Karim later attended the Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland, the most expensive boarding school in the world, for nine years where he achieved, in his words, &quot;fair grades&quot;. Prince Karim was admitted to MIT and wanted to study science, but his grandfather, Aga Khan III, vetoed the decision and Prince Karim attended Harvard University, where he was elected a member of The Delphic Club and majored in Islamic history.

When his grandfather died, the young prince was thrust into the position of the Aga Khan. A university student who was known to be humble by peers became the new Nizari imam. He said about it: &quot;Overnight, my whole life changed completely. I woke up with serious responsibilities toward millions of other human beings. I knew I would have to abandon my hopes of studying for a doctorate in History&quot;. He graduated from Harvard University in 1959, two years after becoming imam, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history (with Cum Laude honours) and his varsity H for the Harvard Crimson men&#x27;s soccer team.

The young Aga Khan was a competitive downhill skier, representing Great Britain at the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1962 and then Iran in the 1964 Winter Olympics.

==Ascension to Nizari Ismaili Imamat==
Following the death of his grandfather the Aga Khan III, Prince Karim, at the age of 20, became the 49th Imam of the Nizari Ismailis and Aga Khan IV, bypassing his father, Prince Aly Khan, and his uncle, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, who were in direct line to succession. In his will, the Aga Khan III explained the rationale for choosing his eldest grandson as his successor (which marked the second time in the history of the Nizari Ismaili chain of Imamat that a grandson of the preceding Imam – instead of one of his sons – was made the next imam):

In view of the fundamentally altered conditions in the world has provoked many changes, including the discoveries of atomic science, I am convinced that it is in the best interests of the Nizari Ismaili community that I should be succeeded by a young man who has been brought up and developed during recent years and in the midst of the new age, and who brings a new outlook on life to his office.

In light of his grandfather&#x27;s will, the Aga Khan IV was sometimes referred to by Nizari Ismailis as the &quot;Imam of the Atomic Age&quot;. The will of the Aga Khan III added that the next Aga Khan, in the first several years of his Imamat, should look to his grandmother, Begum Om Habibeh Aga Khan, for guidance on general matters pertaining to the Imamat.

==Nizari Ismaili Imamat==

Upon taking the position of imam, the Aga Khan IV stated that he intended to continue the work his grandfather had pursued in building modern institutions to improve the quality of life of the Nizari Ismailis. &quot;Takht nashini&quot; (installation of the new imam) ceremonies occurred at several locations over the course of 1957 and 1958. During this time, the Aga Khan emphasized to his followers the importance of fostering positive relations with different ethnicities – a highly appropriate message considering the racially tense atmosphere in East Africa at the time between Blacks and South Asians. During the Aga Khan&#x27;s installation ceremonies on the Indian subcontinent, the Aga Khan stressed his commitment to improving the standard of living of Nizari Ismailis and encouraged co-operation with individuals of other religions.

In 1972, under the regime of President Idi Amin, people of South Asian origin, including Nizari Ismailis, were expelled from Uganda. The South Asians, some of whose families had lived in Uganda for over 100 years, were given 90 days to leave the country. The Aga Khan phoned his long-time friend, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Trudeau&#x27;s government agreed to allow thousands of Nizari Ismailis to immigrate to Canada. The Aga Khan also undertook urgent steps to facilitate the resettlement of Nizari Ismailis displaced from Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, and Burma to other countries. Most of these Nizari Ismailis found new homes in Asia, Europe, and North America. Most of the initial resettlement problems were overcome rapidly by Nizari Ismailis due to their educational backgrounds and high rates of literacy, as well as the efforts of the Aga Khan and the host countries, and with support from Nizari Ismaili community programmes.

The Aga Khan encouraged Nizari Ismailis settled in the industrialised world to contribute towards the progress of communities in the developing world through various development programmes. He described his role as imam as being partly to uplift the material and spiritual wellbeing of Nizari Ismailis – a duty that required an understanding of Nizari Ismailis in the context of their geographic location and their time. He elaborated on this concept in a 2006 speech in Germany, saying &quot;The role and responsibility of an Imam, therefore, is both to interpret the faith to the community, and also to do all within his means to improve the quality, and security, of their daily lives and the people with whom Ismailis share their lives.&quot; This engagement of the Aga Khan with Nizari Ismailis was said to extend to the people with whom the Nizari Ismailis share their lives, locally and internationally.

The Aga Khan was one of several Shia signatories of the 2004 Amman Message which gives a broad foundation for defining those denominations of Islam that should be considered as part of the wider Muslim &quot;Ummah.&quot;

During the Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy of 2006, he said:

I have two reactions to the pope&#x27;s lecture: There is my concern about the degradation of relations and, at the same time, I see an opportunity. A chance to talk about a serious, important issue: the relationship between religion and logic.

When the Aga Khan IV was asked about his view on the consumption of alcohol in a 1965 interview with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, he said, in line with Muslim teaching:

Our belief is that the thing which separates man from the animals is his power of thought. Anything that impedes this process is wrong. Therefore, alcohol is forbidden. I have never touched alcohol. But this, to me, is not a puritan prohibition. I don&#x27;t want to drink. I&#x27;ve never wanted to drink. There&#x27;s no pressure being placed on me by my religion.

Aga Khan IV became the first faith leader to address the Joint Session of the Parliament of Canada on 27 February 2014.

=== Silver Jubilee Year of Imamat ===
From 11 July 1982 to 11 July 1983 – to celebrate the Aga Khan&#x27;s Silver Jubilee, marking the 25th anniversary of his accession to the Imamat – many new social and economic development projects were launched. These range from the establishment of the US$450 million international Aga Khan University with its Faculty of Health Sciences and teaching hospital based in Karachi, the expansion of schools for girls and medical centres in the Hunza region (one of the remote parts of Northern Pakistan bordering China and Afghanistan that is densely populated with Nizari Ismailis), to the establishment of the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme in Gujarat, India – and the extension of existing urban hospitals and primary health care centres in Tanzania and Kenya.

=== Golden Jubilee Year of Imamat ===
11 July 2007 to 13 December 2008 marked the 50th Anniversary of the Aga Khan&#x27;s reign as imam (Golden Jubilee). On this occasion, leaders representing Nizari Ismailis from different areas of the world gathered at his residence to pay homage to the imam. As part of the Golden Jubilee, the Aga Khan made official visits to various countries – using the visits to recognize the friendship and longstanding support of certain leaders of state, government, and others, to the Aga Khan and his Nizari Ismaili community, as well as to lay the foundations for certain future initiatives and programmes. Areas of the world visited included the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa. During his visit to Houston, Texas, US, he announced the establishment of the Ismaili Center Houston.

In 2008, as one of the initiatives of the Golden Jubilee, the Aga Khan organized the Jubilee Games: a Nizari Ismaili sports meet in Kenya, to which teams of Nizari Ismailis from different areas of the world came to compete. The event was first named the Golden Jubilee Games but continued as the Jubilee Games. The second Jubilee Games were held in Dubai, UAE, in July 2016.

=== Diamond Jubilee Year of Imamat ===

11 July 2017 to 11 July 2018 was designated the Diamond Jubilee Year of the Aga Khan&#x27;s 60th year of reign. The Aga Khan travelled throughout the Diamond Jubilee year to countries where his humanitarian institutions operate to launch new programmes that help alleviate poverty and increase access to education, housing and childhood development. The Aga Khan&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee opening ceremony was held in his Aiglemont estate. On 8 March 2018, Queen Elizabeth II hosted the Aga Khan at Windsor Castle at a dinner to mark his Diamond Jubilee. He visited a number of countries including the United States, UAE, India, Pakistan, Canada, France, UK, Kenya, and others. The Diamond Jubilee was hosted in Lisbon, Portugal, on and around 11 July 2018. Ismailis from around the world came to Lisbon to celebrate with their worldwide community. There were many concerts, a Jubilee Arts festival, and other events planned for tens of thousands of people. Following a historic agreement with the Portuguese Republic in 2015, the Aga Khan officially designated the premises located at Rua Marquês de Fronteira in Lisbon – the Henrique de Mendonça Palace – as the Seat of the Ismaili Imamat on 11 July 2018, and declared that it be known as the &quot;Diwan of the Ismaili Imamat&quot;.

=== Ismaili Constitution ===

In 1986, Aga Khan introduced a universal constitution for his international followers, later amended in 1998. Its preamble affirmed core Islamic beliefs while emphasizing the imamate&#x27;s role. It highlighted the imam&#x27;s &quot;ta&#x27;lim&quot; (authoritative teaching), which guides Nizari Ismailis in both spiritual and material matters. The constitution reaffirmed the imam&#x27;s full authority over religious and communal affairs, to ensure structured guidance and adaptability in practicing their faith amid changing circumstances.

==Business activities==

===Thoroughbred horse racing===
The Aga Khan&#x27;s racing horse businesses brought in considerable income. He owned and operated the largest horse racing and breeding operation in France, the French horse auction house, Arqana, Gilltown Stud near Kilcullen in Ireland, and other breeding/stud farms in Europe.

The Aga Khan operated a large horse racing and breeding operation at his estate &quot;Aiglemont&quot;, in the town of Gouvieux in the Picardy region of France – about 4 kilometres ( miles) west of the Chantilly Racecourse. In 1977, he paid £1.3 million for the bloodstock owned by Anna Dupré and in 1978, £4.7 million for the bloodstock of Marcel Boussac. He was said to be France&#x27;s most influential owner-breeder and record winner of The Prix de Diane, sometimes referred to as the French Oaks.

The Aga Khan owned Gilltown Stud near Kilcullen, Ireland, and the Haras de Bonneval breeding farm at Le Mesnil-Mauger in France. In March 2005, he purchased the Calvados stud farms, the Haras d&#x27;Ouilly in Pont-d&#x27;Ouilly and the Haras de Val-Henry in Livarot. Haras d&#x27;Ouilly had been owned by such horsemen as the Duc Decazes, François Dupré, and Jean-Luc Lagardère.

In 2006 the Aga Khan became the majority shareholder of French horse auction house Arqana.

On 27 October 2009 it was announced that Sea the Stars, regarded by many as one of the greatest racehorses of all time, would stand stud at the Aga Khan&#x27;s Gilltown Stud in Ireland.

His unbeaten homebred filly, Zarkava, won the 2008 Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe. His homebred colt, Harzand, won the 2016 Epsom Derby and the 2016 Irish Derby.

The Aga Khan was the lead owner of Shergar, the Irish racehorse that was kidnapped from Ballymany stud farm in County Kildare, Ireland, by masked men in 1983 and held for ransom. The Aga Khan and the other co-owners refused to pay a ransom, and the horse was not recovered. The Aga Khan, the police, and the public suspected the Provisional Irish Republican Army of the abduction, though the IRA denied all involvement. In 1999, former IRA member Sean O&#x27;Callaghan published an autobiography in which he implicates the IRA as being responsible for the abduction. Shergar had become a national symbol in Ireland, and the IRA had underestimated the public outpouring of support for the horse and the backlash for the IRA even among Irish republicans who had historically supported the IRA, leading the IRA to deny involvement.

===Other business ventures===
The Aga Khan was involved in multiple business ventures, in such areas as communications media and luxury hotels. In 1959 he founded the Kenyan media company Nation Media Group, which among others owns &quot;Daily Nation&quot; and &quot;Sunday Nation&quot;.

In the 1990s, the Aga Khan had a group of US$400 a night Italian luxury hotels, called Ciga. Through his for-profit AKFED, the Aga Khan was the largest shareholder in the Serena Hotels chain.

==Other activities==
===Aga Khan Development Network===

The Aga Khan was the founder and chairman of the Aga Khan Development Network, which coordinates the activities of over 200 agencies and institutions, employing approximately 80,000 paid staff, the majority of whom are based in developing countries. AKDN is partly funded by his followers and donor partners that include numerous governments and several international organisations. AKDN agencies operate in the fields of health, education, culture, rural development, institution-building, and the promotion of economic development, with a special focus on countries of the Developing Nations. It is dedicated to improving living conditions and opportunities for the poor, without regard to their faith, origin or sex.

AKDN includes the Aga Khan University, the University of Central Asia, the for-profit Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development, the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, the Aga Khan Foundation, the Aga Khan Health Services, the Aga Khan Education Services, the Aga Khan Planning and Building Services, and the Aga Khan Agency for Microfinance. One of the companies that the AKFED is the main shareholder of is the Serena Hotels Group – a chain of luxury hotels and resorts primarily located in Africa and Asia. The Aga Khan Award for Architecture is the largest architectural award in the world. The Aga Khan was also the chairman of the Board of Governors of the Institute of Ismaili Studies, which he founded in 1977. He was also a vice-president of the Royal Commonwealth Society.

Focus Humanitarian Assistance, an affiliate of the AKDN, is responsible for emergency response in the face of disaster. Recent disasters that FOCUS was involved in helping address include the 2005 earthquake in Pakistan (AKDN earthquake response) and the South Asian tsunami.

Significant recent or current projects that are related to the development and that were being led by the Aga Khan include the Delegation of the Ismaili Imamat and the Global Centre for Pluralism in Ottawa, the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto, the Al-Azhar Park in Cairo, the Bagh-e Babur restoration in Kabul,the Sunder Nursery in Delhi and a network of full IB residential schools known as the Aga Khan Academies.

The Aga Khan expressed concern about the work of the AKDN being described as philanthropy. In his address to the Evangelische Akademie Tutzing, when he was awarded their Tolerance Prize in 2006, he described this concern:
Reflecting a certain historical tendency of the West to separate the secular from the religious, they often describe [the work of the AKDN] either as philanthropy or entrepreneurship. What is not understood is that this work is for us a part of our institutional responsibility – it flows from the mandate of the office of Imam to improve the quality of worldly life for the concerned communities.

===Promotion of Islamic architecture===
In 1977, the Aga Khan established the Aga Khan Award for Architecture, an award recognising excellence in architecture that encompasses contemporary design and social, historical, and environmental considerations. It is the largest architectural award in the world (prize money for which is a million US dollars) and is granted triennially. The award grew out of the Aga Khan&#x27;s desire to revitalise creativity in Islamic societies and acknowledge creative solutions for buildings facilities and public spaces. The prize winner is selected by an independent master jury convened for each cycle.

In 1979, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) established the Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture (AKPIA), which is supported by an endowment from Aga Khan. These programs provide degree courses, public lectures, and conferences for the study of Islamic architecture and urbanism. Understanding contemporary conditions and developmental issues are key components of the academic program. The program engages in research at both institutions and students can graduate with a Master of Science of Architectural Studies specialising in the Aga Khan program from MIT&#x27;s Department of Architecture.

==Personal life==

In 1964, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; wrote that despite the Aga Khan&#x27;s reputation as &quot;a gallivanting jet-setter who wants his horses, cars and women to be fast&quot;, he avoided most parties, never appeared in gossip columns, and had been associated with only one woman for the previous five years (&quot;an exquisite, publicity-avoiding blonde named Annouchka von Mehks&quot;). In 1969, the Aga Khan married former British model Sarah Frances Croker Poole, who assumed the name &quot;Begum Salimah Aga Khan&quot; upon marrying him. Sarah Frances was a divorcee, having previously been married to Lord James Charles Crichton-Stuart, son of John Crichton-Stuart, 5th Marquess of Bute. The wedding ceremonies were held on 22 October 1969 (civil) and 28 October 1969 (religious) at Karim Aga Khan&#x27;s home in Paris. By 1984, the Aga Khan and Begum Salimah had taken to living separate lives. The Aga Khan and Begum Salimah had one daughter and two sons together, Zahra Aga Khan (born 18 September 1970), Rahim Aga Khan (born 12 October 1971), and Hussain Aga Khan (born 10 April 1974). In 1994, the couple&#x27;s divorce was made public.

On 30 May 1998, the Aga Khan married for the second time at his walled compound and chateau, Aiglemont, in Gouvieux, France. The bride was Gabriele Renate Thyssen, who assumed the name &quot;Begum Inaara Aga Khan&quot; at her wedding. Born to Roman Catholic German entrepreneur parents in 1963, Gabriele was twenty-seven years younger than the Aga Khan. She was also a divorcee, having previously been married to Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen, by whom she had a daughter, Teresa. On 7 March 2000, two years after the wedding, a son, Aly Muhammad Aga Khan, was born. On 8 October 2004, after six years of marriage, the couple announced they would be getting divorced. In September 2011, seven years later, a divorce settlement was reached between them in the French courts, and the divorce settlement amount was agreed upon in March 2014.
The Aga Khan was an ardent yachtsman. He co-founded the Yacht Club Costa Smeralda in Porto Cervo, Sardinia, in 1967. He also owned a 164-foot yacht, &quot;Alamshar&quot;, named after a prized racehorse of his, with a price tag of £100 million.

The Aga Khan owned two Bombardier jets. In 2005, it was reported that he owned a Bombardier Global Express and another transcontinental jet.

===Personal finances===
In 2009, &quot;Forbes&quot; reported that the Aga Khan&#x27;s net worth was US$1 billion. In 2013, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; estimated his fortune to be well over US$1 billion. &quot;Forbes&quot; described the Aga Khan as one of the world&#x27;s fifteen richest royals, and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; said that an estimate of his net worth made shortly before January 2013 was $13.3 billion. He was unique among the richest royals in that he does not preside over a geographic territory. He owned hundreds of racehorses, valuable stud farms, an exclusive yacht club on Sardinia, Bell Island in the Bahamas, two Bombardier jets, a £100 million high speed yacht &quot;Alamshar&quot;, and several estates around the world, with his primary residence at Aiglemont estate in the town of Gouvieux, France, north of Paris. The Aga Khan&#x27;s philanthropic non-profit institutions spend about US$600 million per year – mainly in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

== Death ==
Aga Khan IV died in Lisbon, Portugal, on 4 February 2025, at the age of 88. In his will, he designated his son Prince Rahim Al-Hussaini to succeed him as Aga Khan V, the 50th imam of Isma&#x27;ilism. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai and United Nations secretary-general António Guterres were among those publicly paying tribute to the Aga Khan following his death.

A private funeral ceremony was held for him in Lisbon on 8 February. Portuguese officials including president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa and mayor of Lisbon Carlos Moedas were among the attendees, alongside community leaders and foreign dignitaries including Trudeau and former Spanish king Juan Carlos I. On 9 February, he was buried at the Mausoleum of Aga Khan in Aswan, Egypt, also his grandfather&#x27;s resting place.

== Titles, styles and honours ==
The titles of Prince and Princess are used by the Aga Khans and their children by virtue of their descent from Shah Fath Ali Shah of the Persian Qajar dynasty. The title was officially recognised by the British government in 1938.

Author Farhad Daftary wrote of how the honorific title &quot;Aga Khan&quot; (from Agha and Khan) was first given to Aga Khan I at the age of thirteen after the murder of his father: &quot;At the same time, the Qajar monarch bestowed on him the honorific title (laqab) of Agha Khan (also transcribed as Aqa Khan), meaning lord and master.&quot; Daftary additionally commented, &quot;The title of Agha Khan remained hereditary amongst his successors.&quot; On the other hand, in a legal proceeding, the Aga Khan III noted that &quot;Aga Khan&quot; is not a title, but, instead a sort of alias or &quot;pet name&quot; that was given to Aga Khan I when he was a young man.

The style of His Highness was formally granted to the Aga Khan IV by Queen Elizabeth II in 1957 upon the death of his grandfather Aga Khan III, based on his strong expressed desire to see the British monarchy award the non-hereditary title to his successor. Additionally, the style of His Royal Highness was granted in 1959 by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, later overthrown in the Iranian Revolution of 1979, but the Aga Khan preferred to use the style of His Highness. Over the years, the Aga Khan received numerous honours, honorary degrees, and awards.

<text>Richard D. Greenblatt (born December 25, 1944) is an American computer programmer. Along with Bill Gosper, he may be considered to have founded the hacker community, and holds a place of distinction in the communities of the programming language Lisp and of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

==Early life==
Greenblatt was born in Portland, Oregon on December 25, 1944. His family moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania when he was a child. He later moved to Columbia, Missouri with his mother and sister when his parents divorced.

==Career==
===Becoming a hacker===
Greenblatt enrolled in MIT in the fall of 1962, and around his second term as an undergraduate student, he found his way to MIT&#x27;s famous Tech Model Railroad Club. At that time, Peter Samson had written a program in Fortran for the IBM 709 series machines, to automate the tedious business of writing the intricate timetables for the Railroad Club&#x27;s vast model train layout. Greenblatt felt compelled to implement a Fortran compiler for the PDP-1, which then lacked one. There was no computer time available to debug the compiler, or even to type it into the computer. Years later, elements of this compiler (combined with some ideas from fellow TMRC member Steven Piner, the author of a very early PDP-4 Fortran compiler while working for Digital Equipment Corporation) were typed in and &quot;showed signs of life&quot;. However, the perceived need for a Fortran compiler had evaporated by then, so the compiler was not pursued further. This and other experiences at TMRC, especially the influence of Alan Kotok, who worked at DEC and was the junior partner of the design team for the PDP-6 computer, led Greenblatt to the AI Lab, where he proceeded to become a &quot;hacker&#x27;s hacker&quot; noted for his programming acumen as described in Steven Levy&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, and as acknowledged by Gerald Jay Sussman and Harold Abelson when they said they were fortunate to have been apprentice programmers at the feet of Bill Gosper and Richard Greenblatt.

Indeed, he spent so much time programming the Programmed Data Processor (PDP) machines there that he failed out of MIT as a first-term junior and had to take a job at a firm, Charles Adams Associates, until the AI Lab hired him about 6 months later.

===Lisp Machines, Inc.===
In 1979, he and Tom Knight were the main designers of the MIT Lisp machine. He founded Lisp Machines, Inc. (later renamed Gigamos Systems), according to his vision of an ideal hacker-friendly computer company, as opposed to the more commercial ideals of Symbolics.

==Significant software developed==
He was the main implementor of Maclisp on the PDP-6. He wrote Mac Hack, the first computer program to play tournament-level chess and the first to compete in a human chess tournament. AI skeptic Hubert Dreyfus, who famously made the claim that computers would not be able to play high-quality chess, was beaten by the program, marking the start of &quot;respectable&quot; computer chess performances. In 1977, unbeaten chess champion Bobby Fischer played three games in Cambridge, Massachusetts against Greenblatt&#x27;s computer program, and Fischer won all of them. Greenblatt, along with Tom Knight and Stewart Nelson, co-wrote the Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS), a highly influential time-sharing operating system for the PDP-6 and PDP-10 used at MIT.

<doc id="505552" wikidata="Q182170" url="?curid=505552" title="Martin P6M SeaMaster">
<text>The Martin P6M SeaMaster was an experimental strategic bomber flying boat built by the Glenn L. Martin Company for the United States Navy that almost entered service; production aircraft were built and Navy crews were undergoing operational training, with service entry expected in about six months, when the program was cancelled on 21 August 1959. Envisioned as a strategic nuclear weapon delivery system for the Navy, the SeaMaster was eclipsed by the Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). Due to the political situation at the Pentagon and weapon system choices made amid budgetary constraints, the Navy promoted the P6M primarily as a high speed minelayer.

==Design and development==
In the immediate postwar defense climate, the United States Air Force&#x27;s Strategic Air Command was the linchpin of the United States&#x27; security as the sole means of delivery of the nation&#x27;s nuclear arsenal. The Navy saw its strategic role being eclipsed by the Air Force and knew both its prestige and budgets were at stake.

Its first attempt to address this came in the form of the , a large supercarrier intended to launch Navy strategic bombers. This was cancelled in 1950 shortly after her keel was laid down, a victim of budget cuts and US Air Force interference. In response, the Navy chose to create a &quot;Seaplane Striking Force&quot;, useful for both nuclear and conventional warfare, including reconnaissance and minelaying. Groups of these planes supported by seaplane tenders or special submarines could be located close to the enemy, and being mobile, they would be hard to neutralize.

The requirement issued in April 1951 was for a seaplane able to carry a warload over a range of from its aquatic base. The aircraft was to be capable of a low altitude dash at Mach 0.9 (1,100 km/h). Both Convair and Martin submitted proposals, and the Martin proposal was chosen as more promising. An order for two prototypes was issued which was projected to lead to six pre-production aircraft and a projected twenty-four production aircraft.

Originally the plane was to have a Curtiss-Wright turbo-ramjet engine, but this ran into problems and a more conventional Allison J71-A-4 turbojet was employed, fitted in pairs in overwing pods to keep the spray out of the intakes. Wings swept at 40° were used; they displayed a notable anhedral and were designed with tip tanks that doubled as floats on the water. Many features of Martin&#x27;s XB-51 bomber prototype were used, including an all-flying &quot;T&quot; tail and a rotating bomb bay—pneumatically sealed against seawater in the P6M.

==Operational history==


The first flight of the XP6M-1 came on 14 July 1955, but early tests showed that the engines were mounted too close to the fuselage and scorched it when afterburners were used, leading to angling the engines slightly outward in subsequent aircraft. Flight testing was initially successful, but, on 7 December 1955, a control system fault destroyed the first prototype with the loss of all aboard. The first prototype, BuNo &quot;138821&quot;, c/n XP-1, disintegrated in flight at due to the horizontal tail going to full up due to a control malfunction, subjecting the airframe to 9 g stress as it began an outside loop, crashing into the Potomac River near the junction of St. Mary&#x27;s River, killing four crew members.

Eleven months later, on 9 November 1956, the second prototype, BuNo &quot;138822&quot;, c/n XP-2, first flown on 18 May 1956, was also destroyed, due to a change made in the horizontal stabilizer control system without adequate evaluation before test flying the design. The crash occurred at 15:36 near Odessa, Delaware due to a faulty elevator jack. As the seaplane nosed up at ~ and failed to respond to control inputs, the crew of four ejected. The airframe broke up after falling to before impact.

The first pre-production YP6M-1 was completed about a year later, with testing resuming in January 1958.

Five more were built in 1958 when the Navy announced that Harvey Point Defense Testing Activity in Hertford, North Carolina, would serve as the testing grounds for the fleet of Martin P6M SeaMasters. These aircraft were fitted with test versions of the full combat equipment suite and were used for bombing, mine laying and reconnaissance evaluations. The J71 engines were unreliable and the aircraft had spray ingestion problems at higher gross weights, which limited takeoffs to ideal conditions. The P6M-1 also had a serious control deficiency due to porpoising under some trim settings. These deficiencies resulted in the P6M-1 program being cut as it was no longer considered possible for it to be successfully developed.

The Navy and Martin felt that a new version, the P6M-2, would provide a useful aircraft. The first was rolled out in early 1959. Changes included new, more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney J75 engines, an aerial refueling probe, improved avionics, and a canopy with better visibility. A &quot;buddy refueling&quot; drogue kit had also been developed to fit in the bomb bay. Three had been built by summer 1959 and Navy crews were moving them through operational conversion when the program was abruptly canceled in August of that year.

The P6M-2 was an impressive aircraft; its Mach 0.9 (1,100 km/h) performance &quot;on the deck&quot; could be equaled by few aircraft of the time. The aircraft were heavily built, with the skin at the wing roots over thick. The normally docile and pleasant handling characteristics of the P6M-1 were replaced by some severe compressibility effects above Mach 0.8. These included rapid changes in directional trim, severe buffeting, and wing drop requiring high control inputs to counter. Until those problems were fixed, the P6M-2 could not be considered for use by the fleet. The problems were identified as being caused by the larger engine nacelles required for the J75s. There were also problems on the water, including a tendency for the tip floats to dig in under certain situations, and engine surges. These problems were eventually solved, but time had run out just as the first crews were training for its operational debut. Eisenhower&#x27;s administration was making major defense budget cuts that forced the Navy to make choices. In August 1959 Martin was told to halt operations and the program was about to be canceled. Seaplane operations were a small component of U.S. naval aviation, and the P6M was significantly over budget and behind schedule and competing with aircraft carriers for funding. The Navy had also developed a potentially superior system for the nuclear strike role, the ballistic missile submarine.

In the age of the ICBM and SLBM, 

All examples were scrapped although some tail sections were retained for testing, and one of these is now in the Glenn L. Martin Maryland Aviation Museum.

Martin tried unsuccessfully to market the technology in the civilian market, with a version called the SeaMistress but there were no takers, and the company soon abandoned the aircraft business entirely to focus on missiles and electronics. The P6M was the final aircraft built by the Glenn L. Martin Company.

==Variants==
;XP6M-1: prototypes, two built (BuNos 138821, 138822). Both crashed.
;YP6M-1: pre-production model, six built (BuNos 143822-143827). All six examples were scrapped when the program was cancelled.
;P6M-2: production model, eight built (BuNos 145876-145899). 145877-145879 were completed and flown, 145876 and 145880-145883 were completed but not flown. Contracts for 145884-145899 were cancelled.

<text>Transnationality is the principle of acting at a geographical scale larger than that of states, so as to take into account the interests of a supranational entity. 

Transnational policies or programmes are not simply aggregations of national policies or programmes, but seek to submerge these within a greater whole. According to Aihwa Ong, the term differs from that of transnationalism, as transnationalism refers &quot;to the cultural specificities of global processes, tracing the multiplicity of the uses and conceptions of &#x27;culture&#x27;&quot; whereas transnationality is &quot;the condition of cultural interconnectedness and mobility across space&quot;.

Transnationality is practised by organisations such as the United Nations and the European Union. The EU&#x27;s principle of subsidiarity holds that actions should be carried out at the lowest feasible governmental level, and therefore much scope is left to individual Member States. The EU institutions thus concern themselves principally with transnational policies and actions.

<doc id="505567" wikidata="Q157756" url="?curid=505567" title="Hibiscus syriacus">
<text>Hibiscus syriacus is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. 
It is native to areas of east Asia, but widely introduced elsewhere, including much of Europe and North America. It was given the epithet &quot;syriacus&quot; because it had been collected from gardens in Syria.
Common names include the [[rose of Sharon]], (especially in North America), Syrian ketmia,
shrub althea
(or simply althea), 
and rose mallow (in the United Kingdom). It is the national flower of South Korea and is mentioned in the South Korean national anthem.

==Description==
&quot;Hibiscus syriacus&quot; is a hardy deciduous shrub. It is upright and vase-shaped, reaching in height, bearing large trumpet-shaped flowers with prominent yellow-tipped white stamens.
The flowers are often pink in color, but can also be dark pink (almost purple), light pink or white. Individual flowers are short-lived, lasting only a day. However, numerous buds produced on the shrub&#x27;s new growth provide prolific flowering over a long summer blooming period. The soil in which the Hibiscus thrives is moist but well-drained, and organically rich.
&quot;Hibiscus syriacus&quot; is highly tolerant of air pollution, heat, humidity, poor soil and drought.
The species has naturalized very well in many suburban areas and might even be termed slightly invasive, so frequently does it seed.

===Growth===
The branches are thin and gray, white-lenticeled, with raised leaf scars and small buds. Stems and branches do not branch very much unless pruned, resulting in many long, straight stems that originate from about above the ground, giving rise to the shrub&#x27;s overall vase shape.
The leaves appear unusually late in the season, in May. They are usually green or yellowish green, alternate, broadly ovate, palmately veined, and long. They have three distinct lobes with coarsely-toothed margins.

===Flowers===

&quot;Hibiscus syriacus&quot; has 5-petaled flowers (to diameter) in solid colors of white, red, purple, mauve, violet, or blue, or bicolors with a different colored throat, depending upon the cultivar. Extending from the base of these five petals is the pistil at the center, with the stamen around it. These basic characteristics give the &quot;H. syriacus&quot; flower and its many variants their distinctive form. The plant can bloom continuously from July through September, usually at night. With maturity, flexible plant stems become weighted under the load of prolific summer flowers, and bend over halfway to the ground.

===Fruits and seeds ===
Most modern cultivars are virtually fruitless. The fruits of those that have them are green or brown, unornamental 5-valved dehiscent capsules, which persist throughout much of the winter. They split over the course of the dormant season and spread their easily germinating seeds around the base of the parent plant, thus forming colonies with time.

==Cultivation==

Though it has no fall color and can be stiff and ungainly if badly pruned, &quot;H. syriacus&quot; remains a popular ornamental shrub today, with many cultivars. Full-grown plants can tolerate a wide range of conditions, including frost, drought and urban pollution. However, the best results are produced in a warm, sheltered position; a well-drained neutral soil; and full sun.

===Propagation===
&quot;Hibiscus syriacus&quot; is fairly easily propagated from either seeds, with variable results, or by layering or cuttings, cloning the original.

===Pests and diseases===
Old shrubs can develop trunk cankers that may eventually prove fatal to the plant. The plant has some susceptibility to leaf spots, blights, rusts and canker. Japanese beetles, whiteflies and aphids are occasional insect visitors. Japanese beetles can severely damage foliage if left unchecked.

===Cultivars===
The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit: 

*&#x27;Blue Chiffon&#x27; (&#x27;Notwood3&#x27;) (blue, semi-double)
*&#x27;Diana&#x27; (single, white)
*&#x27;Hamabo&#x27; (pale pink, red centre)
*&#x27;Lavender Chiffon&#x27; (&#x27;Notwoodone&#x27;) (pale lilac)
*&#x27;Meehanii&#x27; (pink, variegated leaves)
*&#x27;Oiseau Bleu&#x27;(&#x27;Blue Bird&#x27;) (blue-violet, maroon centre)
*&#x27;Red Heart&#x27; (white, red centre)
*&#x27;White Chiffon&#x27; (&#x27;Notwoodtwo&#x27;) (white, double)
*&#x27;William R. Smith&#x27; (white, single)
*&#x27;Woodbridge&#x27; (deep pink)
==National flower==

&quot;Hibiscus syriacus&quot;, also known as the Korean rose, is the national flower of South Korea. The flower appears in various national emblems, and Korea is compared poetically to the flower in the South Korean national anthem. The flower&#x27;s name in Korean is &quot;mugunghwa&quot; (), which translates to &quot;eternal blossom that never fades&quot;. It is also known as &quot;mokkeunhwa&quot; (). Professor emeritus at Ohio State University, Chan E. Park, notes that, to many Koreans, the flower was a symbol of resistance to Japanese colonial rule. South Korean law also defined the flagpole used for hoisting national flag should be surmounted by a ball that has the shape of the flower&#x27;s calyx.

== History and culture ==

&quot;Hibiscus syriacus&quot; was originally endemic to Korea. It was brought to Japan in the 8th century and cultivated for horticulture. According to records, it was prolific on the Korean Peninsula before the 1st century. Its leaves were brewed into a herbal infusion and its flowers eaten in Korea. Later on it was introduced and grown in the gardens of Europe as early as the 16th century, though as late as 1629 John Parkinson thought it was tender and took great precautions with it, thinking it &quot;would not suffer to be uncovered in the Winter time, or yet abroad in the Garden, but kept in a large pot or tubbe in the house or in a warme cellar, if you would have them to thrive.&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;) By the end of the 17th century, some knew it to be hardy: Gibson, describing Lord Arlington&#x27;s London house noted six large earthen pots coddling the &quot;tree hollyhock&quot;, as he called it, &quot;that grows well enough in the ground&quot;. By the 18th century the shrub was common in English gardens and in the North American colonies, known as &quot;Althea frutex&quot; and &quot;Syrian ketmia&quot;.

<doc id="505568" wikidata="Q725776" url="?curid=505568" title="Byron Nelson">
<text>John Byron Nelson Jr. (February 4, 1912 – September 26, 2006) was an American professional golfer between 1935 and 1946, widely considered one of the greatest golfers of all time.

Nelson and two other legendary champions of the time, Ben Hogan and Sam Snead, were born within seven months of each other in 1912. Although he won many tournaments in the course of his relatively brief career, he is mostly remembered today for having won 11 consecutive tournaments and 18 total tournaments in 1945. He retired officially at the age of 34 to be a rancher, later becoming a commentator and lending his name to the Byron Nelson Classic, the first PGA Tour event to be named for a professional golfer. As a former Masters champion he continued to play in that annual tournament, placing in the top-10 six times between 1947 and 1955 and as high as 15th in 1965.

In 1974, Nelson received the Bob Jones Award, the highest honor given by the United States Golf Association in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf, and was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. He became the second recipient of the PGA Tour Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997. He received the 1994 Old Tom Morris Award from the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America, that organization&#x27;s highest honor. Nelson was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2006.

==Early life==
Born near Waxahachie, Texas, Byron Nelson was the son of Madge Allen Nelson (1893–1992) and John Byron Nelson Sr. (1889–1965). His parents set a precedent for him not only in their long lives — Madge Nelson lived to age 98, and her husband to age 77 — but also in their religious commitment. Madge, who had grown up Baptist, was baptized in the Church of Christ at age 18, and John Byron Sr., raised Presbyterian, was baptized in the Church of Christ soon after meeting Madge. The senior Byron Nelson went on to serve as an elder in the Roanoke Church of Christ, and the younger Byron Nelson was a committed member of that congregation, even performing janitorial services there from time to time long after he became famous. He placed his membership at the Hilltop Church of Christ in Roanoke from 1989 until 2000, when he moved his membership to the Richland Hills Church of Christ in North Richland Hills, Texas.

When Nelson was 11 years old, the family moved to Fort Worth, where he barely survived typhoid fever after losing nearly half his body weight to the disease, which also left him unable to sire children. Soon after his baptism at age 12, he started caddying at Glen Garden Country Club. On his caddying days, Nelson said, &quot;I knew nothing about caddying at first, but it wasn&#x27;t difficult to learn. The other caddies, though, didn&#x27;t like to see any new ones, because that might mean they wouldn&#x27;t get a job sometime.&quot; An article on Nelson in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; noted that initially caddies were not permitted to play at the club: &quot;[H]e would often practice in the dark, putting his white handkerchief over the hole so he could find it in the darkness.&quot; The club later changed its policy and sponsored a caddie tournament, where a 14-year-old Nelson beat fellow caddie and future golf great Ben Hogan by a single stroke after a nine-hole playoff. Nelson and Hogan were rivals but close friends in their teen years, and for the first part of their professional careers as well, but Nelson&#x27;s early success was difficult for the struggling Hogan to deal with, and they gradually grew apart, while retaining mutual respect.

In 1934, Nelson was working as a golf pro in Texarkana, Arkansas, when he met his future wife Louise Shofner, to whom he was married for 50 years before she died in 1985 after two severe strokes.

==Professional career==

===Championship heyday===
After turning professional in 1932, Nelson served as a club professional in Texas and played as many significant tournaments as he could afford, to develop his game. Money was tight, as Texas was hit very hard by the Great Depression. A pair of top-three finishes in important Texas events encouraged him. He then took a club professional&#x27;s job at the Ridgewood Country Club in New Jersey in 1935. He worked hard on his game, having earlier realized that with the technological change from hickory to steel shafts, which was gathering momentum in the early 1930s, that the golf swing would have to adapt as well. Nelson was among the first of a new generation of players who developed a full swing with increased leg drive leading the downswing; this is the forerunner of modern golf technique as practiced by top players, right to the present day. Nelson is sometimes credited as being the father of the modern golf swing. He refined the changes for a couple of years, and then took his game to the highest level of competition, the PGA Tour. Nelson&#x27;s first significant victory was in 1935 at the New Jersey State Open. He followed this up with a win at the Metropolitan Open the following year. He reportedly won this tournament with &quot;$5 in my pocket&quot;.

In 1937, Nelson was hired as the head professional at the Reading Country Club in Reading, Pennsylvania, and worked there until 1940, when he took a new job as head pro at the Inverness Club in Toledo, Ohio. While at Inverness, Nelson coached and mentored the promising young player Frank Stranahan, who would go on to stardom over the next two decades.

===Wins major championships===
Nelson won his first major title at The Masters in 1937, two shots ahead of runner-up Ralph Guldahl. During this tournament, he shot a first-round 66, which was the lowest first-round score at the Masters until 1976, when Raymond Floyd shot a 65 en route to his victory. Nelson won four more majors, the U.S. Open in 1939, the PGA Championship in 1940 and 1945, and a second Masters in 1942.

====World War II years====
Nelson had a blood disorder that caused his blood to clot four times slower than normal, which kept him out of military service during World War II. It has sometimes mistakenly been reported that he had hemophilia. During the war, Nelson gave hundreds of golf exhibitions across the country to raise money for charitable causes, often partnering with Harold &quot;Jug&quot; McSpaden, who was also exempt from military service.

==Career highlights==

In his career, Nelson won 52 professional events, and, along with McSpaden, was one of golf&#x27;s &quot;Gold Dust Twins&quot;.

Nelson won the Vardon Trophy in 1939. He played on two Ryder Cup teams, in 1937 and 1947, and was non-playing captain in 1965. After 1946, Nelson curtailed his schedule, although he continued to make regular appearances at The Masters as a competitor, played occasional Tour events, appeared in a few overseas tournaments, and later served as a ceremonial starter for many years.

===Record-breaking year===
In 1945, Nelson enjoyed a record-breaking year, winning 18 PGA tournaments out of the 30 he played, including 11 in a row that he played in. Both records are yet to be beaten. Nelson&#x27;s run of 11 wins started in March with the Miami International Four-Ball, where he partnered Jug McSpaden. He then won 10 individual events ending with the Canadian Open in August, a run that finished when he finished tied for fourth place in the Memphis Invitational. During this run, he won the 1945 PGA Championship, the only major championship played that year. The week after the PGA Championship he missed the St. Paul Open with a back injury. There has been debate as to how impressive these results are, as it was believed to be a weakened tour due to the war. But in reality many of the leading golfers of that time, including Sam Snead and Ben Hogan still played a full or at least part schedule that year. Snead won 6 times in 1945 while Hogan won 5 times in the latter part of the year. During this year Nelson finished second another 7 times, set a record for the scoring average (68.33 for 18 holes) that was broken by Tiger Woods in 2000, a record 18 hole score (62), and a record 72-hole score (259, which beat the previous record set by Ben Hogan earlier that year). This year is now known as the greatest single year by a player on the PGA Tour, as Arnold Palmer said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think that anyone will ever exceed the things that Byron did by winning 11 tournaments in a row in one year.&quot; Even more recently, Tiger Woods referred to the year as &quot;one of the great years in the history of the sport&quot;.

===Cut streak===
Nelson&#x27;s record of 113 consecutive cuts made is second only to Tiger Woods&#x27; 142. The PGA Tour defines a &quot;cut&quot; as receiving a paycheck, even if an event has no cut &quot;per se&quot;. In Nelson&#x27;s era, only the top 20 in a tournament received a check. In reality, Nelson&#x27;s &quot;113 consecutive cuts made&quot; are representative of his unequaled 113 consecutive top 20 tournament finishes. Almost half of those top 20s were during the weakened tour war years of 1944 &amp; 1945. In fact, 26 of Nelson&#x27;s 52 tour wins were during those two weakened tour years of 1944 &amp; 1945. Before 1944 he had never won more than 4 events in any year.

===First to win 50 PGA Tour events===
With his win at the 1946 Columbus Invitational, Nelson became the first player to reach 50 career PGA Tour wins. This feat has since been matched by Ben Hogan, Sam Snead, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Billy Casper, and Tiger Woods.

===Notable performances===
Nelson achieved several notable performances of scoring and accuracy at key moments in major championships:
* 1937 Masters: Nelson scored a birdie and an eagle on holes 12 and 13 in the final round, making up six strokes on his main rival Ralph Guldahl, who played those same holes with a double bogey and a bogey; Nelson went on to win.
* 1939 U.S. Open: Nelson hit the flagstick six times on approach shots during the regulation 72 holes and the 36 playoff holes, he won the championship.
* 1945 PGA Championship: In the semi-final 36-hole match against Jim Turnesa, Nelson was down four holes with five holes remaining. He played those finishing holes with an eagle and four birdies to win the match; Turnesa scored a birdie and four pars over those holes; Nelson won the title the next day.

==Retirement==
Nelson retired officially at the relatively early age of 34 to become a rancher, buying a ranch in Roanoke, Texas.

Nelson later became a television golf commentator, during the 1960s and 1970s.

===Byron Nelson Classic===
From 1968, Nelson lent both his name and support to the Byron Nelson Golf Classic in Dallas; this was the first regularly-held PGA Tour event to be named for a professional golfer; the tournament had been previously staged as the Dallas Open.

===Late-career competition, wins===
As a former Masters champion, he continued to play in that annual tournament, placing in the top-10 six times between 1947 and 1955, and as high as 15th in 1965, at age 53. From 1947 to 1955 Nelson played in 12 majors and won none.

Nelson did win the 1951 Bing Crosby Pro-Am, a PGA Tour event that he had not won before. He also won the 1955 French Open. Nelson gave paid golf exhibitions for many years after he retired from the Tour, notably after his 1951 Crosby victory.

===Writes memoirs===
Nelson published his memoir &quot;How I Played The Game&quot; in 1993 (by Taylor Publishing, Dallas).

Over nearly 70 years in the sport, Nelson played with many celebrities and well-known personalities, including: Roone Arledge, Bing Crosby, James Garner, Bob Hope, Bobby Knight, Randolph Scott, Ed Sullivan, Johnny Weissmuller, Lawrence Welk, and Babe Zaharias.

===Coach and mentor===
Among the rising golf talents Nelson coached and mentored, from the 1950s to the 1970s, are World Golf Hall of Fame members Ken Venturi and Tom Watson, along with Marty Fleckman (who won the 1965 NCAA title and one PGA Tour event), and the dominant amateur Harvie Ward.

==Death and legacy==
Nelson died Tuesday, September 26, 2006. According to a family friend, Nelson died at his Roanoke, Texas home around noon. He was survived by Peggy, his wife of nearly 20 years, sister Margaret Ellen Sherman (1920–2007), and brother Charles (1926–2018), a professor emeritus at Abilene Christian University, where Byron Nelson had been a trustee and benefactor. Nelson met his second wife, the former Peggy (McDonald) Simmons of Toledo, Ohio, when she volunteered at the Bogie Busters celebrity golf tournament in Dayton, Ohio in 1985.

Nelson was often referred to as &quot;Lord Byron&quot;, after the English poet by that name, in recognition of his reputation for gentlemanly conduct, a nickname given him by Atlanta sports journalist O. B. Keeler. Many of his obituaries referenced this reputation.

Nelson had several successful years as a television golf commentator. Among the memorable events he broadcast was the 1966 U.S. Open for ABC Sports. Nelson&#x27;s comments as Arnold Palmer let slip a big lead to Billy Casper on the final nine holes: &quot;A few holes ago, everybody thought this championship was over. Golf is the strangest game in the world.&quot; It was at the 1974 U.S. Open that Nelson met Watson for the first time, and the two connected after Watson let a big lead get away in the final round.

Nelson was ranked as the fifth greatest golfer of all time by &quot;Golf Digest&quot; magazine in 2000. On this list, Jack Nicklaus was first, Nelson&#x27;s longtime rivals Ben Hogan and Sam Snead were second and third respectively, and Bobby Jones was fourth. A 2009 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; panel ranked him seventh on its list of all-time greatest golfers, behind Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Jones, Hogan, Snead, and Arnold Palmer.

The &quot;Iron Byron&quot; electro-mechanical machine or robot, developed by Battelle Memorial Institute and True Temper Sports and used by the United States Golf Association and golf manufacturers to compare and test clubs and balls for conformity to standards, was named for Nelson, honoring the consistency of his swing.

In Jack Nicklaus&#x27;s 1978 book &quot;On and Off the Fairway&quot;, Nicklaus wrote that Nelson was the straightest golfer he ever saw. The two never played competitively (except at the Masters; Nicklaus won in 1965, Nelson finished tied for 15th), but a 14-year-old Nicklaus was in the crowd at the 1954 U.S. Junior Amateur, when Nelson gave an exhibition hitting golf shots.

==Posthumous honors==
State Highway 114 Business through Roanoke, Texas is named Byron Nelson Boulevard, in honor of Nelson&#x27;s residence; the street he lived on was recently changed to Eleven Straight Lane in honor of his 1945 record. In Irving, Texas a street immediately adjacent to the Four Seasons Resort and Club, where the HP Byron Nelson Championship is played each year, is named Byron Nelson Lane. A street in Southlake, Texas, Byron Nelson Parkway, was named in his honor, as was a street in a residential neighborhood in McAllen, Texas.

On September 29, 2006, the United States Senate approved Senate Resolution 602 awarding Byron Nelson the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest award bestowed by the Legislative Branch of the United States government. The resolution cites Mr. Nelson&#x27;s &quot;significant contributions to the game of golf as a player, a teacher, and a commentator&quot;. Representative Michael C. Burgess (R-TX) sponsored the resolution, originally proposed on March 8, 2006, well before Nelson&#x27;s death. On June 27, 2007, Peggy Nelson, Byron Nelson&#x27;s surviving wife, was presented with the medal.

On April 23, 2007, the Northwest Independent School District named their second high school Byron Nelson High School. This is the first high school named in honor of Byron Nelson and opened in the fall of 2009. The school is located in Trophy Club, Texas, near Nelson&#x27;s hometown of Roanoke.

Artist Chelle Adams painted two portraits of Byron Nelson in dedication which hang in the school&#x27;s auditorium. Orange County Choppers built three choppers in dedication which were auctioned off.

<text>Torres is a German-style board game designed by Wolfgang Kramer and Michael Kiesling and published in 1999 by FX Schmid in German and by Rio Grande Games in English. The game strongly influenced Kramer and Kiesling&#x27;s Mask Trilogy of games, but is not considered to be a part of the trilogy. The game has since been reprinted (in 2005).

==Game play==
Game play revolves around constructing an abstract set of castles set on a grid. Each player is allotted several knight pieces, which are placed within the castles. The higher the knights&#x27; placement during a scoring round, the greater the payoff for the controlling player.

The number of points a player receives per phase is based on the height times the surface area of the highest point of the castle that the knight is standing upon. If the knight is on the 3rd level of a castle, and the castle occupies 5 squares on the board, the player receives 15 points. A King piece is also placed on the board and acts as a bonus modifier to any knights that occupy the same level and castle as the King at the end of a phase.

The game is composed of three different phases, with each phase having three to four rounds each depending on the number of players. Each player has five action points (AP) to spend during a round. The following moves may be performed during a round:
*Place a new knight (2 AP) All new knights must be adjacent to existing knights, and may only occupy a level equal to or lower than the existing knight on the board.
*Place a new castle piece (1 AP) Castle pieces must be placed next to or on top of existing castle pieces. A castle&#x27;s level cannot exceed the surface area, i.e., a castle occupying two squares on the map may only reach two levels in height. New castle pieces may not join two existing castles.
*Pick up an action card (1 AP) There are 40 different action cards which allow the player to perform special moves, such as moving the King piece, moving castle pieces, or moving knights diagonally. In the master version, each player begins with a full set of action cards in their hand. Purchasing an action card is no longer a possible action.
*Move a knight (1 AP/square) Knights may move one square per AP point spent, but may only move up one level, and may not move diagonally. Knights can go down any number of levels without spending AP.
*Gain one victory point (1 AP) Action points may be exchanged for victory points on a one-to-one basis.

Players receive three or four stacks of castle pieces per phase with two or three pieces per stack, depending on the current phase and number of players. A player may only use pieces from one stack per phase, but may transfer unused pieces to another stack for the next phase. After the last phase is reached all unused castle pieces are returned to the common supply and points are calculated. The king gives a bonus of five, ten, or fifteen points based on the scoring phase.

The number of victory points per player is kept by individual markers on the edge of the game board. Since no two markers can occupy the same victory point number, the last player to occupy the space will automatically be moved ahead by one victory point. The person in last place after each scoring phase may then move the King piece to another castle.

After the third phase, all victory points are calculated and the person with the highest number of points wins the game.

==Reception==
The game won the Spiel des Jahres.

<doc id="505575" wikidata="Q863983" url="?curid=505575" title="Phosphodiester bond">
<text>In chemistry, a phosphodiester bond occurs when exactly two of the hydroxyl groups () in phosphoric acid react with hydroxyl groups on other molecules to form two ester bonds. The &quot;bond&quot; involves this linkage . Discussion of phosphodiesters is dominated by their prevalence in DNA and RNA, but phosphodiesters occur in other biomolecules, e.g. acyl carrier proteins, phospholipids and the cyclic forms of GMP and AMP (cGMP and cAMP).

== Phosphodiester Backbone of DNA and RNA ==
Phosphodiester bonds make up the backbones of DNA and RNA. In the phosphodiester bonds of nucleic acids, a phosphate is attached to the 5&#x27; carbon of one nucleoside and to the 3&#x27; carbon of the adjacent nucleoside. Specifically, it is the phosphodiester bonds that link the 3&#x27; carbon atom of one sugar molecule and the 5&#x27; carbon atom of another (hence the name 3&#x27;, 5&#x27; phosphodiester linkage used with reference to this kind of bond in DNA and RNA chains). The involved saccharide groups are deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA. In order for the phosphodiester bond to form, joining the nucleosides, the tri-phosphate or di-phosphate forms of the nucleotide building blocks are broken apart to give off energy required to drive the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. In DNA replication, for example, formation of the phosphodiester bonds is catalyzed by a DNA polymerase enzyme, using a pair of magnesium cations and other supporting structures. Formation of the bond occurs not only in DNA and RNA replication, but also in the repair and recombination of nucleic acids, and may require the involvement of various polymerases, primers, and/or ligases. During the replication of DNA, for example, the DNA polymerase I leaves behind a hole between the phosphates in the newly formed backbone. DNA ligase is able to form a phosphodiester bond between the nucleotides on each side of the gap.

Phosphodiesters are negatively charged at pH 7. The negative charge attracts histones, metal cations such as magnesium, and polyamines [needs citation]. Repulsion between these negative charges influences the conformation of the polynucleic acids.

== Breaking the Phosphodiester Bond ==
Hydrolysis (breaking) of phosphodiester bonds can be promoted in several ways. Phosphodiesterases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond. These enzymes are involved in repairing DNA and RNA sequences, nucleotide salvage, and in the conversion of cGMP and cAMP to GMP and AMP, respectively. Hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond also occurs chemically and spontaneously, without the aid of enzymes. For example, simple ribose (in RNA) has one more hydroxyl group than deoxyribose (in DNA), making the former less stable and more susceptible to alkaline hydrolysis, wherein relatively high pH conditions induce the breaking of the phosphodiester linkage between two ribonucleotides. The relative instability of RNA under hydroxyl attack of its phosphodiester bonds makes it inadequate for the storage of genomic information, but contributes to its usefulness in transcription and translation.

<doc id="505593" wikidata="Q667252" url="?curid=505593" title="Blue monkey">
<text>The blue monkey or diademed monkey (Cercopithecus mitis) is a species of Old World monkey native to Central and East Africa, ranging from the upper Congo River basin east to the East African Rift and south to northern Angola and Zambia. It sometimes includes Sykes&#x27;, silver, and golden monkeys as subspecies.

==Subspecies==
Several subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;Cercopithecus mitis boutourlinii&quot; – Boutourlini&#x27;s blue monkey, found in Western Ethiopia
* &quot;Cercopithecus mitis elgonis&quot; – Elgon blue monkey
* &quot;Cercopithecus mitis heymansi&quot; – Lomami River blue monkey, found in Congo
* &quot;Cercopithecus mitis kolbi&quot; – Kolb&#x27;s monkey, found in Kenya
* &quot;Cercopithecus mitis mitis&quot; – Pluto monkey, found in Angola
* &quot;Cercopithecus mitis moloneyi&quot; – Moloney&#x27;s blue monkey
* &quot;Cercopithecus mitis opitsthosticus&quot;
* &quot;Cercopithecus mitis schoutedeni&quot; – Schouteden&#x27;s blue monkey, found in Congo
* &quot;Cercopithecus mitis stuhlmanni&quot; – Stuhlmann&#x27;s blue monkey
At times, some of these have been regarded as full species, and additional subspecies have been considered valid, while others are not recognized by all authorities.

==Description==

Despite its name, the blue monkey is not noticeably blue; it has little hair on its face, and this does sometimes give a blue appearance, but it never has the vivid blue appearance of a mandrill, for example. It is mainly olive or grey apart from the face (which is dark with a pale or yellowish patch on the forehead – the &quot;diadem&quot; from which the species derives its common name), the blackish cap, feet, and front legs, and the mantle, which is brown, olive, or grey depending on the subspecies. Typical sizes range from 50 to 65 cm in length, (not including the tail, which is almost as long as the rest of the animal), with females weighing a little over 4 kg and males up to 8 kg.

==Ecology==
===Habitat===
The blue monkey is found in evergreen forests and montane bamboo forests, and lives largely in the forest canopy, coming to the ground infrequently. It is very dependent on humid, shady areas with plenty of water. It eats mainly fruit and leaves, but will take some slower-moving invertebrates. It prefers to live in tall trees, which provide both food and shelter, and is, therefore, like almost all guenons, suffering from the loss of its natural habitat. Where pine plantations replace natural forest, the monkey may be treated as a threat by foresters, since it sometimes strips bark from exotic trees in a search for food or moisture. It is also hunted for bushmeat and as payback for crop-raiding.

===Diet===
Blue monkeys eat fruits, figs, insects, leaves, twigs, and flowers. &quot;They are primarily frugivores, with 50% of their diet consisting of fruit, with leaves or insects as their main source of protein, with the rest of the diet being made up of seeds, flowers, and fungi. They rarely eat vertebrates. They eat a variety of plants, but concentrate on a few species, which means their population density is generally dependent on plant species&#x27; richness and diversity&quot;.

==Behavior==
&quot;Cercopithecus mitis&quot; joins with the &quot;C. ascanius&quot; (red-tailed monkey) for extra protection. Its interactions with red-tailed monkeys include interspecies grooming. Their social system is mainly female because the males leave once they are mature. The males have little to no interaction with the young. &quot;C. mitis&quot; is very territorial, so the young males must leave quickly to help themselves become more successful. They challenge the dominant male of another family. If they defeat the dominant male, they take over the leadership of that family, and this offers a place to live, socialization, and food supplies for the young males.&quot; &quot;C. mitis&quot; is said to be nomadic.

===Social structure===

The blue monkeys live in female-philopatric social systems where females stay in their natal groups, while males disperse once they reach adulthood. As a result, blue monkey groups usually consist of one male with several females and infants, giving rise to matrilinear societies. Occasionally, solitary males are observed, which are probably transient, having left their natal group in search of a new group.

====Social relationships====
In these female-bonded societies, only 5–15% of monkeys&#x27; activity budget is occupied by social interactions and the most common social interactions within a group are grooming and playing. Relationships between group members vary: infants interact most frequently with their peers and adult or juvenile females and are rarely seen near adult males.

Alloparenting is common among blue monkeys. The most common infant handlers are juvenile females, and usually one infant is carried by a number of alloparents. One hypothesis is that this allows the infant to learn to socialise at an early stage in life.

Interesting female-female relationships exist among blue monkeys. This relationship is believed to be shaped by their feeding ecology, which, in turn, is shaped by between-group and within-group competition. Blue monkey females exhibit strong, aggressive competition between groups and between other species because of their territorial character, but milder though more frequent competition within groups. Though earlier beliefs were that blue monkeys are not territorial, more current extended research shows that earlier researchers misinterpreted the results because social interactions overall are infrequent. Moreover, overall agonism rates in blue monkeys are very low. Within-group conflicts are mild and infrequent because females distance themselves from one another and feed at different sites to avoid competition. Although blue monkeys were believed to be egalitarian, current extended research confirms that linear dominance hierarchy occurs in female blue monkeys, which becomes more apparent when food resources are scarce.

===Reproduction===
The mating system is polygynous, with a corresponding sexual dimorphism in size, as the males are the substantially larger sex. Females normally give birth every two years, during the onset of the warm, rainy season; gestation is around five months, and the infants are born with fur and with their eyes open. Group sizes range from 10 to 40, containing only a single adult male. It is often found in groups with other species of monkeys such as the red-tailed monkey and various red colobus monkeys.

&quot;C. mitis&quot; males mate with more than one female, but the females only mate with one male. The female attracts males to copulate with her through body language. They breed throughout the year. &quot;The groups can have up to 40 members and the females usually help to care for all of the young, not just their own.&quot;

<text>John Robert Wooden (October 14, 1910 – June 4, 2010) was an American basketball coach and player. Nicknamed &quot;the Wizard of Westwood&quot;, he won ten National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) national championships in a 12-year period as head coach for the UCLA Bruins, including a record seven in a row. No other team has won more than four in a row in Division I college men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s basketball. Within this period, his teams won an NCAA men&#x27;s basketball record 88 consecutive games. Wooden won the prestigious Henry Iba Award as national coach of the year a record seven times and won the Associated Press award five times.

As a guard with the Purdue Boilermakers, Wooden was the first college basketball player to be named an All-American three times, and the 1932 Purdue team on which he played as a senior was retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA tournament national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. He played professionally in the National Basketball League (NBL). Wooden was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a player (1960) and as a coach (1973), the first person to be enshrined in both categories.

One of the most revered coaches in the history of sports, Wooden was beloved by his former players, among them Lew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and Bill Walton. Wooden was renowned for his short, simple inspirational messages to his players (including his &quot;Pyramid of Success&quot;) many of which were directed at how to be a success in life as well as in basketball. Wooden&#x27;s 29-year coaching career and overwhelming critical acclaim for his leadership have created a legacy not only in sports but also extending to business, personal success, and organizational leadership.

==Early life and playing career==
John Robert Wooden was born on October 14, 1910, in Hall, Indiana, the son of Roxie (1887–1959) and Joshua Wooden (1882–1950), and moved with his family to a small farm in Centerton in 1918. He had three brothers: Maurice, Daniel, and William, and two sisters, one (unnamed) who died in infancy, and another, Harriet Cordelia, who died from diphtheria at the age of two.

When he was a boy, Wooden&#x27;s role model was Fuzzy Vandivier of the Franklin Wonder Five, a legendary team that dominated Indiana high school basketball from 1919 to 1922. After his family moved to the town of Martinsville when he was 14, Wooden led his high school team to a state tournament title in 1927. He was a three-time All-State selection.

After graduating from high school in 1928, he attended Purdue University and was coached by Ward &quot;Piggy&quot; Lambert. The 1932 Purdue team on which he played as a senior was retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA tournament national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Poretta Power Poll. John Wooden was named All-Big Ten and All-Midwestern (1930–32) while at Purdue, and he was the first player ever to be named a three-time consensus All-American. In 1932, he was awarded the Big Ten Medal of Honor, recognizing one student athlete from the graduating class of each Big Ten member school, for demonstrating joint athletic and academic excellence throughout their college career. He was also selected for membership in the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. Wooden is also an honorary member of Alpha Phi Omega National Service Fraternity. Wooden was nicknamed &quot;The Indiana Rubber Man&quot; for his suicidal dives on the hardcourt. He graduated from Purdue in 1932 with a degree in English.

After college, Wooden spent several years playing professional basketball in the NBL with the Indianapolis Kautskys, Whiting Ciesar All-Americans, and Hammond Ciesar All-Americans, while he taught and coached in the high school ranks. During one 46-game stretch, he made 134 consecutive free throws, which is still a professional record to this day (the NBA record is 97 made by Micheal Williams in 1993). One notable instance made after hitting his 100th consecutive free throw had Kautskys owner Frank Kautsky pay $100 to Wooden directly during a game after briefly stopping it to celebrate his 100th professional free throw made in a row. He was named to the All-NBL First Team for the 1937–38 season.

During World War II in 1942, he joined the United States Navy. He served until 1946 and left the service as a lieutenant.

==Coaching career==

===High school===

Wooden coached two years at Dayton High School in Dayton, Kentucky. His first year at Dayton, the 1932–33 season, marked the only time he had a losing record (6–11) as a coach. After Dayton, he returned to Indiana, where he taught English, coached basketball and served as the athletic director at South Bend Central High School until entering the Armed Forces. Wooden spent two years at Dayton and nine years at Central. His high school coaching record over 11 years was 218–42.

===Indiana State University===
After World War II, Wooden coached at Indiana State Teachers College, later renamed Indiana State University, in Terre Haute, Indiana, from 1946 to 1948, succeeding his high school coach, Glenn M. Curtis. In addition to his duties as basketball coach, Wooden also coached baseball (1948 season, 7-7 record) and served as athletic director, all while teaching and completing his master&#x27;s degree in education. In 1947, Wooden&#x27;s basketball team won the Indiana Intercollegiate Conference title and received an invitation to the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball (NAIB) National Tournament in Kansas City. Wooden refused the invitation, citing the NAIB&#x27;s policy banning black players. One of Wooden&#x27;s players, Clarence Walker, was a black man from East Chicago, Indiana.

That same year, Wooden&#x27;s alma mater Purdue University asked him to return to campus and serve as an assistant to then-head coach Mel Taube until Taube&#x27;s contract expired, when Wooden would take over the program. Citing his loyalty to Taube, Wooden declined the offer, because this would have effectively made Taube a lame-duck coach.

In 1948, Wooden again led Indiana State to the conference title. The NAIB had reversed its policy banning black players that year, and Wooden coached his team to the NAIB National Tournament final, losing to Louisville. This was the only championship game a Wooden-coached team ever lost. That year, Walker became the first black player to play in any post-season intercollegiate basketball tournament.

===UCLA===
In the 1948–1949 season, Wooden was hired by the University of California, Los Angeles, to be the fourth basketball coach in the school&#x27;s history. He succeeded Fred Cozens, Caddy Works, and Wilbur Johns; Johns became the school&#x27;s athletic director. Wooden signed a three-year contract for $6,000 in the first year. Prior to being hired at UCLA, he had been pursued for the head coaching position at the University of Minnesota, and it was his and his wife&#x27;s desire to remain in the Midwest, but inclement weather in Minnesota prevented Wooden from receiving the scheduled phone offer from the Golden Gophers. Thinking that they had lost interest, Wooden instead accepted the head coaching job with the Bruins. Officials from the University of Minnesota contacted Wooden immediately after he accepted the position at UCLA, but he declined their offer because he had already given his word to UCLA.

Wooden had immediate success, fashioning the mark of the rarest of coaches, an &quot;instant turnaround&quot; for an undistinguished, faltering program. Part of this success was due to his unique offensive system, the same system that countless coaches use today. John Wooden stated, &quot;I believe my system is perfectly suited to counter all the modern defenses I have seen, and that includes run-and-jump, 1–3–1 trapping, box-and-one, triangle-and-two, and switching man-to-man.&quot;

Prior to Wooden&#x27;s arrival at UCLA, the basketball program had only had two conference championship seasons in the previous 18 years. In his first season, he took a Bruins team that had posted a 12–13 record the previous year and transformed it into a Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) Southern Division champion with a 22–7 record, the most wins in a season for UCLA since the school started playing basketball in 1919. He surpassed that number the next season with 24–7 and a second division title and overall conference title in 1950, and would add two more in his first four years. Up to that time, UCLA had collected a total of two division titles since the PCC began divisional play, and had not won a conference title of any sort since winning the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in 1927.
In spite of these achievements, Wooden reportedly did not initially enjoy his position, and his wife did not favor living in Los Angeles. When Mel Taube left Purdue in 1950, Wooden&#x27;s inclination was to return to West Lafayette and finally accept the head coaching job there. He was ultimately dissuaded when UCLA officials reminded him that it was he who had insisted upon a three-year commitment during negotiations in 1948. Wooden felt that leaving UCLA prior to the expiration of his contract would be tantamount to breaking his word, even though Purdue offered more money, a car and housing.

By the 1955–56 season, Wooden had established a record of sustained success at UCLA. That year, he guided the team to its first undefeated PCC conference title and a 17-game winning streak that came to an end only at the hands of Phil Woolpert&#x27;s University of San Francisco team (who had Bill Russell and K.C. Jones) that eventually won the 1956 NCAA tournament. However, UCLA was unable to advance from this level over the immediately ensuing seasons, finding itself unable to return to the NCAA Tournament, as the Pete Newell-coached teams of the California Golden Bears took control of the conference and won the 1959 NCAA tournament. Also hampering the fortunes of Wooden&#x27;s team during that time period was a probation that was imposed on all UCLA sports teams in the aftermath of a scandal that involved illegal payments made to players on the school&#x27;s football team. The probation was also extended to three additional schools: the University of Southern California, California and Stanford. The scandal resulted in the dismantling of the PCC conference.

By the 1961–1962 season, the probation was no longer in place and Wooden returned his team to the top of the conference. This time, however, they would take the next step, and in so doing, unleash a run of dominance unparalleled in the history of college basketball. UCLA reached the Final Four of the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history. A narrow loss, due largely to a controversial foul call in a 1962 semi-final game against Ed Jucker&#x27;s eventual national champion Cincinnati team, convinced Wooden that his Bruins were ready to contend for national championships. Two seasons later in 1964, the final piece of the puzzle fell into place when assistant coach Jerry Norman persuaded Wooden that the team&#x27;s small-sized players and fast-paced offense would be complemented by the adoption of a zone press defense, which increased the probability of turnovers by the opposing team. The result was a dramatic increase in scoring, giving UCLA a powerhouse team that went 30–0 on its way to the school&#x27;s first basketball national championship and first undefeated season as the Bruins beat Vic Bubas&#x27; taller and slower racially segregated Duke team 98–83 in the final. Walt Hazzard fouled out of the game late in the second half on a player control foul, but this proved to be insignificant when he cut down the net in celebration and was named tournament most valuable player. Gail Goodrich (27 points), Keith Erickson, Fred Slaughter, Jack Hirsch, and reserve Kenny Washington (26 points, 12 rebounds) contributed to the UCLA win. With no player taller than 6 feet, 5 inches, the Bruins&#x27; speed and zone press forced 29 turnovers and nullified the height advantage of Duke&#x27;s Hack Tison and Jay Buckley, two 6-foot, 10-inch players.

In the 1964–1965 campaign, the defending NCAA champions got off to an ominous start when UCLA lost to Illinois by 27 points in its opening game. It was all uphill after that as the squad repeated as national champions with Gail Goodrich, Kenny Washington, and Doug McIntosh. The Bruins upended Dave Strack&#x27;s Michigan team 91–80 in the finals of the NCAA tournament. Goodrich shared Player of the Year honors with Princeton&#x27;s Bill Bradley. The 1966 squad was denied a chance at a triple crown when it finished second to Oregon State in the Athletic Association of Western Universities (now the Pac-12). UCLA was ineligible to play in the NCAA tournament that year because in those days only conference champions received a bid to the tournament. The Bruins&#x27; 1967 incarnation returned with a vengeance with sophomore star Alcindor, reclaiming not only the conference title, but the national crown with another 30–0 season, and then retaining it every season but one until Wooden&#x27;s retirement immediately following the 1975 NCAA championship.

The resurgence of the Bruins under Wooden made it obvious that they needed a new home. Since 1932, the Bruins had played at the Men&#x27;s Gym. It normally seated 2,400, but had been limited to 1,500 since 1955 by order of the city fire marshal. This forced the Bruins to move games to Pan Pacific Auditorium, the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and other venues around Los Angeles when they were expected to attract larger crowds—something that happened fairly often after the Bruins&#x27; first national title. At Wooden&#x27;s urging, a much larger on-campus facility, Pauley Pavilion, was built in time for the 1965–66 season. The building in Westwood was christened on November 27, 1965, in a special game that pitted the UCLA varsity against the UCLA freshmen. It was Lew Alcindor&#x27;s (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) freshman season (freshmen were ineligible to play on the varsity in those days). UCLA was the defending national champion and ranked number 1 in the pre-season poll. The freshmen easily won the game by a score of 75–60. It was a powerful indication of things to come.

A rule change was instituted for the 1967–1968 season, primarily because of Alcindor&#x27;s towering play near the basket. The dunk shot was outlawed and would not be reinstated until the 1976–1977 season, which was shortly after Wooden&#x27;s retirement. This was at least the second time that the rules committee had initiated change in response to the domination of a superstar player; in 1944, the goaltending rule was instituted to counter George Mikan&#x27;s dominant defensive play near the basket. In January, UCLA took its 47-game winning streak to the Astrodome in Houston, where the Bruins met Guy Lewis&#x27; Houston squad, who had Elvin Hayes, Don Chaney, and Ken Spain, in the Game of the Century in the nation&#x27;s first nationally televised regular season college basketball game. Houston upset UCLA 71–69, as Hayes scored 39 points. In a post-game interview, Wooden said, &quot;We have to start over.&quot; UCLA went undefeated the rest of the year and thrashed Houston 101–69 in the semi-final rematch of the NCAA tournament en route to the national championship. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; ran the front cover headline &quot;Lew&#x27;s Revenge. The rout of Houston&quot;. UCLA limited Hayes to only 10 points; he had been averaging 37.7 points per game. Wooden credited Norman for devising the diamond-and-one defense that contained Hayes. The Game of the Century is also remembered for an incident involving Wooden and Edgar Lacy. Lacy was ineffective on defense against Elvin Hayes, and Wooden benched him after 11 minutes. Lacy never re-entered the game. Furious with Wooden, Lacy quit the team three days later, telling the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve never enjoyed playing for that man.&quot; UCLA&#x27;s talent during the 1968 NCAA tournament was so overwhelming that they placed four players on the All-Tournament team. In addition to Alcindor, Lucius Allen, Mike Warren, and &quot;Lefty&quot; Lynn Shackelford were given accolades. Kenny Heitz was also a member of UCLA&#x27;s 1968 team.

Lew Alcindor finished his career at UCLA in 1969 with a third consecutive national championship when the Bruins beat George King&#x27;s Purdue team 92–72 in the title game. The three straight titles were matched by three consecutive MVP awards in the tournament as Alcindor established himself as college basketball&#x27;s superstar during the three-peat performance. Alcindor and Wooden would continue their communication even after he left UCLA. In 2017, Jabbar wrote a book, &quot;Coach Wooden and Me&quot;, which details their long-standing friendship.

A sportswriter commented that everybody outside of UCLA would be happy that glorious day in June when Alcindor finally graduated and college basketball could go back to the routine method of determining a national champion. This prophecy would prove to be ludicrous over the next six years. The 1970 squad proved that nobody was indispensable to the success of the UCLA program, not even Alcindor, as Sidney Wicks, Henry Bibby, Curtis Rowe, John Vallely, and Kenny Booker carried the Bruins to their fourth consecutive NCAA title with an 80–69 win over upstart Jacksonville, coached by Joe Williams. Wicks and Rowe double teamed 7-foot Artis Gilmore on defense and shut down the high-powered Jacksonville offense, which had been averaging 100 points per game. Gilmore and 5&#x27;10&quot; Rex Morgan had been dubbed &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; by the press.

In the 1971 NCAA championship game, Steve Patterson outscored Howard Porter of Jack Kraft&#x27;s scandal-plagued Villanova squad as UCLA won 68–62. The following year, UCLA had its closest game in all of Wooden&#x27;s 10 championships, beating Hugh Durham&#x27;s Florida State team 81–76 to take the 1972 title. After the game, Bill Walton said, &quot;We didn&#x27;t play well.&quot;
The 1972–1973 season was one of the most memorable campaigns in the history of UCLA basketball. Freshmen became eligible to play varsity ball again, and the Bruins went 30–0 and stretched their winning streak to a record 75 straight in breezing through the NCAA tournament by blowing out Gene Bartow&#x27;s Memphis State team 87–66 in the final, as Bill Walton hit an incredible 21 of 22 field goal attempts. Walton and Wooden were everybody&#x27;s Player and Coach of the Year again. Keith Wilkes, Greg Lee, and Larry Hollyfield were members of that team, and Wilkes would go on to win four NBA championships as well.

UCLA&#x27;s two big streaks came to an end during the 1973–1974 season. In January, the winning streak stopped at 88 games when Digger Phelps&#x27;s Notre Dame squad upended the Bruins 71–70 in South Bend. Two months later, Norm Sloan&#x27;s North Carolina State team defeated UCLA 80–77 in double overtime in the semifinals of the NCAA tournament. David Thompson was NC State&#x27;s All-American, and Tom Burleson did an excellent job on defense against Bill Walton. UCLA had beaten the Wolfpack by 18 points early in the season, but things were different when they met in March.

Wooden coached what would prove to be his final game in Pauley Pavilion on March 1, 1975, a 93–59 victory over Stanford. Four weeks later, following a 75–74 overtime victory over former player and former assistant coach Denny Crum and Louisville in the 1975 NCAA Tournament semifinal game, Wooden announced that he would retire at age 64 immediately after the championship game. His legendary coaching career concluded triumphantly when Richard Washington and David Meyers combined for 52 points as UCLA responded with a 92–85 win over Joe B. Hall and Kentucky to claim Wooden&#x27;s first career coaching victory over the Wildcats and his unprecedented 10th national championship. Marques Johnson and Andre McCarter were also key contributors on Wooden&#x27;s final championship team. The success of Wooden&#x27;s last team was particularly impressive because it had no marquee stars such as Alcindor, Walton, Hazzard, and Goodrich; the team was a group of rugged opportunists.

Andy Hill, who was on three Bruin teams under Wooden that won NCAA championships from 1970 to 1972, decades later co-wrote with Wooden the 2001 book &quot;Be Quick—But Don&#x27;t Hurry! Finding Success in the Teachings of a Lifetime&quot;. The bestseller details how Hill applied his experience as a player under Wooden to achieve success in his career as a television executive. His goal was to demonstrate the relevance of Wooden&#x27;s coaching style to the business world. The book also delves into his personal relationship with Wooden as his coach and mentor.

In 2004, a 93-year-old Wooden stated that he would not mind coming back as an assistant who could help players with practices and other light duties.

During his tenure with the Bruins, Wooden became known as &quot;the Wizard of Westwood&quot;, though he personally disdained the nickname. He gained lasting fame with UCLA by winning 620 games in 27 seasons and 10 NCAA titles during his last 12 seasons, including seven in a row from 1967 to 1973. His UCLA teams also established an NCAA men&#x27;s basketball record winning streak of 88 games and four perfect 30–0 seasons. They also won 38 straight games in NCAA tournaments and 98 straight home wins at Pauley Pavilion, where Wooden compiled a 150–3 record over 10 seasons.

&quot;He never made more than $35,000 a year salary (not including camps and speaking engagements), including 1975, the year he won his 10th national championship, and never asked for a raise&quot;, wrote Rick Reilly of ESPN. He was given a Bruin powder blue Mercedes that season as a retirement gift. According to his own writings, Wooden turned down an offer to coach the Los Angeles Lakers from owner Jack Kent Cooke that may have been ten times what UCLA was paying him.

===Association with Sam Gilbert===
During Wooden&#x27;s time at UCLA, and after his retirement in 1975, he faced criticism for the program&#x27;s relationship with local businessman and booster Sam Gilbert, known by many of Wooden&#x27;s players as &quot;Papa Sam.&quot; Gilbert, a multi-millionaire contractor, was known for forging close financial relationships with UCLA players, supplying them with cars, clothes, stereos, travel, and apartments, as well as allegedly arranging abortions for players&#x27; girlfriends. He represented several UCLA stars, including Lew Alcindor and Bill Walton, as an agent after they turned pro.

A 1981 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; investigation, interviewing 45 people affiliated with the basketball program, revealed the extent of Gilbert&#x27;s involvement, describing him as &quot;a one-man clearinghouse who has enabled players and their families to receive goods and services usually at big discounts and sometimes free.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; investigation found that Gilbert&#x27;s involvement in the program began in 1967, when UCLA stars Alcindor and Lucius Allen were considering transferring to Michigan State. They approached former UCLA star Willie Naulls, who introduced them to Gilbert. Gilbert met with the two players, and both remained at UCLA. Alcindor, later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, said later that he would have stayed regardless but called Gilbert &quot;like my surrogate father.&quot; Allen credited Gilbert with dissuading him from transferring: &quot;There were two people I listened to. Coach Wooden as long as we were between the lines. Outside the court — Sam Gilbert.&quot; Allen said Gilbert paid for multiple abortions for players&#x27; girlfriends, including one of his own. &quot;Everybody knew what was going on,&quot; UCLA player David Greenwood said. &quot;Nobody was so naive. It was common knowledge in the whole town.&quot;

UCLA assistant Jerry Norman, who coached under Wooden from 1957 to 1968, recalled that Gilbert began &quot;to come around our program right when I was ready to leave. What normally happens is, alumni come to you and say, &#x27;Coach, is there any way I can help?&#x27; Well, maybe. A lot of kids want summer jobs. But Gilbert started going behind the coaches. Alcindor calls me one day in the spring. I ask him, &#x27;Where are you?&#x27; and he says, &#x27;I&#x27;m in Mr. Gilbert&#x27;s office.&#x27;&quot; In his autobiography &quot;Giant Steps&quot;, Abdul-Jabbar called Gilbert &quot;that odd combination, a cagey humanitarian with a lot of muscle. Guys would go to him when they were in trouble, and he would find a way to fix it...Sam steered clear of John Wooden, and Mr. Wooden gave him the same wide berth. Both helped the school greatly...once the money thing got worked out, I never gave another thought to leaving UCLA.&quot;

&quot;The way Sam explained it to me, it was within the rules,&quot; Allen said in a 2007 documentary. &quot;But it wasn&#x27;t.&quot; In 1973, freshman center Richard Washington told &quot;The New York Times&quot; the reason he&#x27;d chosen UCLA: &quot;I took a dip in Sam Gilbert&#x27;s pool and it cooled me off and that was the convincer.&quot;

In 1978, NCAA field investigator J. Brent Clark testified before a Congressional subcommittee that he had begun investigating Gilbert&#x27;s activities the year before but was told to back off by a superior at the NCAA, Bill Hunt. &quot;If I had spent a month in Los Angeles, I could have put them [UCLA] on indefinite suspension,&quot; Clark said later, but &quot;as long as Wooden was there, the NCAA would never have taken any action.&quot; Clark told Congress: &quot;The conclusion I draw is that it is an example of a school that is too big, too powerful, and too well respected by the public, that the timing was not right to proceed against them.

Wooden was aware of Gilbert&#x27;s closeness with his players. In 1972, Wooden said &quot;I personally hardly know Sam Gilbert...I think he&#x27;s a person who&#x27;s trying to be helpful in every way that he can. I sometimes feel that in his interest to be helpful it&#x27;s in direct contrast with what I would like to have him do to be helpful. I think he means very well and, for the most part, he has attached himself to the minority-race players. I really don&#x27;t want to get involved in saying much about that, to be honest with you.&quot;

Despite concerns about Gilbert, Wooden said he chose not to ask players to cut off contact, telling the &quot;Times&quot; in 1981: &quot;There&#x27;s as much crookedness as you want to find. There was something Abraham Lincoln said — he&#x27;d rather trust and be disappointed than distrust and be miserable all the time. Maybe I trusted too much.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; reporters, Mike Littwin and Alan Greenberg, concluded: &quot;Wooden knew about Gilbert. He knew the players were close to Gilbert. He knew they looked to Gilbert for advice. Maybe he knew more. He should have known much more. If he didn&#x27;t, it was only because he apparently chose not to look.&quot;

Wooden did pass along his concerns to UCLA athletic director J. D. Morgan, but Morgan did not pursue the matter aggressively, in part because he believed Gilbert was connected to the Mafia. Former UCLA chancellor Charles E. Young recalled Morgan &quot;saying to me in that deep voice of his, &#x27;Chuck, you don&#x27;t know about Sam Gilbert. Do you want to end up on a block of concrete at the bottom of the ocean?&#x27; J. D.&#x27;s view of him was that if you cross Sam, you&#x27;re likely to be killed, literally.&quot;

Gene Bartow, who succeeded Wooden as UCLA coach, felt similarly. In 1991, he wrote a letter to an NCAA official thanking him for suppressing Brent Clark&#x27;s investigation into Gilbert. &quot;I want to say &#x27;thank you&#x27; for possibly saving my life...I believe Sam Gilbert was Mafia-related and was capable of hurting people. I think, had the NCAA come in hard while I was at UCLA, Gilbert and others associated with the program would have felt I had reported them, and I would have been in possible danger...Without question, he put out some front-end money to recruits in a few cases, and I think that could have been proven.&quot;

In 1981, after Wooden&#x27;s retirement, an NCAA investigation sanctioned UCLA for its relationship with Gilbert, putting the program on probation for two seasons and ordering the school to disassociate itself from him. Three players at other universities told NCAA investigators that Gilbert had offered them cars to commit to UCLA.

In 1987, Gilbert was indicted in Florida for conspiracy, racketeering, and money laundering as part of a drug smuggling scheme, but he died of heart failure before he could be prosecuted. His son, Michael Gilbert, was convicted on four counts in the case. Trial testimony revealed that Sam Gilbert had used Miami drug money to build The Bicycle Hotel &amp; Casino in Bell Gardens, California.

==Legacy==

When Wooden arrived at UCLA for the 1948–1949 season, he inherited a little-known program that played in a cramped gym. He left it as a national powerhouse with 10 national championships— the most successful rebuilding project in college basketball history. John Wooden ended his UCLA coaching career with a 620–147 overall record and a winning percentage of .808. These figures do not include his two-year record at Indiana State prior to taking over the duties at UCLA.

In 2009, Wooden was named &quot;The Sporting News&quot; &quot;Greatest Coach of All Time&quot;.

==Honors==
Wooden was recognized numerous times for his achievements. He was named NCAA College Basketball&#x27;s Coach of the Year in 1964, 1967, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1973. In 1967, he was the Henry Iba Award USBWA College Basketball Coach of the Year. In 1972, he shared &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; award with Billie Jean King. In 1960, he was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame for his achievements as a player and as a coach in 1973, becoming the first to be honored as both a player and a coach.

After his coaching career ended, UCLA continued to honor Wooden with the title of Head Men&#x27;s Basketball Coach Emeritus. On November 17, 2006, Wooden was recognised for his impact on college basketball as a member of the founding class of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. He was one of five people—along with Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell, Dean Smith and Dr. James Naismith—who were selected to represent the inaugural class. In 2009, he was inducted into the Missouri Valley Conference Athletics Hall of Fame in St. Louis. Coach Wooden was the ninth honouree in the Missouri Valley Conference&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement category. Wooden said the honour he was most proud of was &quot;Outstanding Basketball Coach of the U.S&quot;. by his denomination, the Christian Church.

Since 1977, the John R. Wooden Award has been the most coveted of the four college basketball player-of-the-year awards. This award has attained the status of being the equivalent of football&#x27;s Heisman Trophy for college basketball, with the winner announced during a ceremony held at the Los Angeles Athletic Club. The MVP award for the McDonald&#x27;s All-American Game in high-school basketball is named the &quot;John R. Wooden Most Valuable Player Award&quot;. The Wooden Legacy is held in his honour.

In 1998 the Coach Wooden &quot;Keys to Life&quot; Award was created to be given to a former player or coach who exemplifies character, leadership and faith. This Award is presented at the Legends of the Hardwood Breakfast, which is held each year at the Final Four and is hosted by Athletes in Action.

On February 3, 1984, Wooden was inducted into the Indiana State University Athletic Hall of Fame.
In 2000, Wooden was honored with the &quot;Lombardi Award of Excellence&quot; from the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. The award was created to honor Coach Lombardi&#x27;s legacy, and is awarded annually to an individual who exemplifies the spirit of the Coach.

Wooden has schools and athletic facilities named after him. The gym at his alma mater Martinsville High School bears his name, and in 2005 a high school in the Los Angeles Unified School District was renamed to John R. Wooden High School. In 2003, UCLA dedicated the basketball court in Pauley Pavilion in honor of John and Nell Wooden. Named the &quot;Nell &amp; John Wooden Court&quot;, Wooden asked for the change from the original proposal of the &quot;John &amp; Nell Wooden Court&quot;, insisting that his wife&#x27;s name should come first. In 2008, Indiana State also bestowed this honour on Wooden by naming their home court in the Hulman Center the &quot;Nellie and John Wooden Court&quot;. The student recreation centre at UCLA is also named in his honor. Also in 2008, Wooden was honoured with a commemorative bronze plaque in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Memorial Court of Honor because his UCLA basketball teams played six seasons in the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. On November 8, 2008, Indiana State officially named the floor at the Hulman Centre The Nellie and John Wooden Court in honor of the legendary coach and his late wife, Nellie. The ceremony included taped comments from Coach Wooden and the participation of members of his 1946–47 and 1947–48 teams. The Sycamores christened the newly named floor by defeating the Albion College (MI) Britons in an exhibition game.

On July 23, 2003, John Wooden received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian honor. It was presented by George W. Bush after a three-year campaign by Andre McCarter, who was on Wooden&#x27;s 1975 National Championship team. The Ukleja Center for Ethical Leadership at California State University, Long Beach established the John Wooden Ethics in Leadership Award in 2009, with Wooden being the inaugural recipient. In 1986, John Wooden was honored as an Outstanding Alumnus of the School of Liberal Arts at Purdue University – the first year the award was given.

In 1976, Wooden received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

On May 17, 2004, Wooden was awarded the Ambassador Award of Excellence by the LA Sports &amp; Entertainment Commission at the Riviera Country Club.

On Wooden&#x27;s 96th birthday in 2006, a post office in Reseda, California, near where Wooden&#x27;s daughter lives, was renamed the Coach John Wooden Post Office. This act was signed by President George W. Bush based on legislation introduced by Congressman Brad Sherman.

In July 2010, Wooden&#x27;s alma mater, Purdue University, named a street on campus after him.

On October 14, 2010, the Undergraduate Student Association Council of UCLA held a &quot;John Wooden Day Celebration&quot; to honor Wooden&#x27;s 100th birthday and to commemorate his contributions to the university. A portion of the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame at Morgan Centre is a recreation of Wooden&#x27;s den office in honor of his memory on campus.

&quot;Golf Digest&quot; lists Wooden as one of four people to score both a double eagle and a hole in one in the same round of golf. The feat was accomplished in 1947 at the South Bend Country Club in South Bend, Indiana.

The flagship leadership development program of Wooden&#x27;s fraternity, Beta Theta Pi, is named &quot;The John and Nellie Wooden Institute for Men of Principle&quot; after Coach Wooden and his wife, Nellie. Coach Wooden&#x27;s maxims and creed are central to the teaching of leadership development at the institute.

On October 26, 2012, a bronze statue of Wooden by sculptor Blair Buswell was dedicated at the newly renovated Pauley Pavilion.

&quot;Wooden&#x27;s Legacy&quot;, a 2012 public artwork statue by Jeffrey Rouse, is exhibited in Indianapolis, Indiana.

The United States Postal Service will honor Wooden as the subject of a first class forever postage stamp to be issued in 2024.

==Following Wooden==
Three of Wooden&#x27;s former players would take over the program and leave within a few years. Gene Bartow, Gary Cunningham, Larry Brown, and Larry Farmer were the four coaches who entered and left UCLA in the nine years following Wooden. One former UCLA head coach, former ESPN analyst and former St. John&#x27;s head coach Steve Lavin (fired from UCLA in 2003), has said &quot;The mythology and pathology of UCLA basketball isn&#x27;t going to change&quot; due to Wooden&#x27;s legacy and believes that every basketball coach will eventually be fired or forced out from UCLA.

Bartow, Wooden&#x27;s immediate successor at UCLA, went 28–5 in 1976, but was blown out twice that season by Bob Knight&#x27;s eventual undefeated national-champion Indiana Hoosiers, the second time in the Final Four, and lost 76–75 in the 1977 West Region semifinals to Idaho State.
Bartow won 85.2% of his games (compared to Wooden&#x27;s 80.8%) in two years, yet supposedly received death threats from unsatisfied UCLA fans.

Wooden himself often joked about being a victim of his own success, calling his successors on the phone and playfully identifying himself ominously as &quot;we the alumni...&quot; In his autobiography, Wooden recounts walking off the court in 1975 after his last game as a coach, having just won his tenth title, only to have a UCLA fan walk up and say, &quot;Great win coach, this makes up for letting us down last year&quot; (UCLA had lost in the semifinals in double overtime in 1974 to eventual national champion North Carolina State).

Bartow&#x27;s successor, Wooden protege Gary Cunningham, posted an even better two-year record after Bartow, .862 (50–8) and No. 2 rankings each year, but could not proceed past two wins in the NCAAs, and left. Larry Brown came next, racking up more losses, 17, in two years than UCLA had experienced the previous four. With a near-magical end-of-season run typical of his career, he managed to coach UCLA into the title game in 1980, where the Bruins lost to Louisville, coached by Denny Crum. Coincidentally, Crum had played for Wooden at UCLA before working for him there as an assistant coach. Brown then left UCLA. Former UCLA players Larry Farmer and Walt Hazzard then took turns directing the UCLA program from 1981 to 1988. Hazzard&#x27;s 1985 team won the National Invitation Tournament.

UCLA went 20 years after Wooden&#x27;s retirement before winning another national championship, finally hanging a banner again in 1995 under coach Jim Harrick, when Ed O&#x27;Bannon starred for the Bruins as they beat Arkansas 89–78 in the title game and denied Nolan Richardson back-to-back titles. In 2006, Ben Howland led the team back to the national championship game for the first time since the 1995 title game, but they were defeated 73–57 by the Florida Gators and their star player Joakim Noah. Harrick was the only coach of John Wooden&#x27;s nine successors who has guided the Bruins to an NCAA championship.

==Personal life==
Wooden met his future wife, Nellie &quot;Nell&quot; Riley, when he was a freshman in high school They were both 21 years of age when they married in a small ceremony in Indianapolis in August 1932 and afterward attended a Mills Brothers concert at the Circle Theatre to celebrate. The couple had a son, James Hugh Wooden, and a daughter, Nancy Anne Muehlhausen. Nellie died on March 21, 1985 from cancer at age 73.

Wooden remained devoted to Nellie&#x27;s memory until his own death 25 years after her passing. He kept to a monthly ritual—health permitting—on the 21st of every month, when he would visit her crypt in the mausoleum, then write a love letter to her. After completing each letter, he placed it in an envelope and added it to a stack of similar letters that accumulated over the years on the pillow she slept on during their life together. Wooden stopped writing the letters because of failing eyesight in the last months of his life.

In mourning Nellie&#x27;s death, Wooden was comforted by his faith. He was a devout Christian, considering his beliefs more important to him than basketball: &quot;I have always tried to make it clear that basketball is not the ultimate. It is of small importance in comparison to the total life we live. There is only one kind of life that truly wins, and that is the one that places faith in the hands of the Savior.&quot; Wooden&#x27;s faith strongly influenced his life. He read the Bible daily and attended the First Christian Church. He said that he hoped his faith was apparent to others: &quot;If I were ever prosecuted for my religion, I truly hope there would be enough evidence to convict me.&quot;

In a 2009 interview, he described himself politically as a &quot;liberal&quot;, who had voted for some Republican presidential candidates.

==Final years and death==

Wooden was in good physical health until the later years of his life. On April 3, 2006, he spent three days in a Los Angeles hospital, receiving treatment for diverticulitis. He was hospitalized again in 2007 for bleeding in the colon, with his daughter quoted as saying her father was &quot;doing well&quot; upon his subsequent release. Wooden was hospitalized on March 1, 2008, after a fall in his home. He broke his left wrist and his collarbone in the fall, but remained in good condition according to his daughter and was given around-the-clock supervision. In February 2009, he was hospitalized for four weeks with pneumonia.

On May 26, 2010, Wooden was admitted to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center after suffering from dehydration. He remained hospitalized there and died of natural causes at age 99 on June 4, 2010. He was survived by his son, daughter, three grandsons, four granddaughters, and 13 great-grandchildren. Following a private ceremony, Wooden was interred with his wife Nellie in an outdoor community mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. A public memorial service was held two weeks later at UCLA&#x27;s Pauley Pavilion.

==Seven Point Creed==
John Wooden&#x27;s Seven Point Creed was given to him by his father Joshua upon his graduation from grammar school:

# Be true to yourself.
# Make each day your masterpiece.
# Help others.
# Drink deeply from good books, especially the Bible.
# Make friendship a fine art.
# Build a shelter against a rainy day.
# Pray for guidance and give thanks for your blessings every day.

Wooden also lectured and authored a book about the Pyramid of Success. The Pyramid of Success consists of philosophical building blocks for succeeding at basketball and at life. In his later years he was hired by corporations to deliver inspirational lectures and even appeared in commercials for Hartford Insurance and the NCAA. Following his death in June 2010—shortly after the basketball season— all UCLA sports teams wore either a patch or helmet sticker with the initials &quot;JRW&quot; inside a black pyramid for the remainder of the season, in honor of his philosophy. Furthermore, the men&#x27;s basketball team continues to wear the patch as of 2019, though not in black. It is generally known that he received lecture fees that exceeded the salaries he was paid as a coach. Wooden proudly claimed that these late in life windfalls allowed him to set up education accounts for all of his grandchildren. At the top of the Pyramid of Success was &quot;Competitive Greatness&quot; which Wooden defined as &quot;Perform at your best when your best is required. Your best is required each day.&quot;

Wooden was also the author of several other books about basketball and life.

<doc id="505606" wikidata="Q141903" url="?curid=505606" title="Gaspé, Quebec">
<text>Gaspé () is a city at the tip of the Gaspé Peninsula in the Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine region of eastern Quebec in Canada. Gaspé is about northeast of Quebec City and east of Rimouski. Gaspé has a total population of 15,063, as of the 2021 Canadian Census.

Gaspé is where Jacques Cartier took possession of New France (now part of Canada) in the name of François I of France on July 24, 1534.

The most common assumption is that &quot;Gaspé&quot; may come from the Miꞌkmaq word &quot;Gespeg&quot; which means &quot;Land&#x27;s end&quot;. Other theories hold that the name may be a mutation of the Basque word &quot;geizpe&quot; or &quot;kerizpe&quot; which means &quot;shelter&quot; or &quot;place of refuge&quot;. Another theory is that it is named after Portuguese explorer Gaspar Corte-Real, who explored the Labrador in 1500.

In 1600, Englishman Richard Hakluyt used the name &quot;Gaspay&quot; in his translation of &quot;Cosmosgraphie&quot; by Jean Alfonse, which became the common spelling in the early 17th century. Thereafter, many other spellings appeared, such as &quot;Gachepé, Gachepay, Gaschepay, Gaspey, Gaspèche&quot;, and &quot;Gapèche&quot;.
==History==
Gaspé claims the title of &quot;Cradle of French America&quot;, because on June 24, 1534, explorer Jacques Cartier halted in the bay after losing an anchor during a storm and claimed possession of the area by planting a wooden cross with the king&#x27;s coat of arms and the sentence &quot;Vive le Roi de France&quot; (&quot;Long live the King of France&quot;). Cartier met there an indigenous tribe that called the territory &quot;Honguedo&quot;, probably a Mi&#x27;kmaq word meaning &quot;meeting place&quot;.

Following the Treaty of Paris in 1763, British officers and soldiers acquired free land in Gaspé. In 1784, they were joined by many Loyalist settlers. From then on, Gaspé became an important commercial fishing centre, especially of cod. In 1804, its post office opened.

In 1833 in Gaspé County there were only ten farmers, all in the Gaspé Bay area (of whom seven were also involved in the fishery), four whalers in Gaspé Bay, five shipbuilders (one a Jersey firm), one blacksmith, two lumber merchants, five shipowners (all of whom were Jerseymen), 18 fish merchants (13 of whom were Jerseymen) and 32 major fishing establishments (of which 16 were Jersey-owned).

Gaspé was incorporated as a village municipality in 1855. From 1861 to 1866, the port of Gaspé was a duty-free port, making shipping the primary economic activity. With 40 to 50 European ships docking annually, many countries opened consulates in Gaspé, including Italy, the United States, Brazil, Portugal, and Norway. By 1911, the railway reached Gaspé. But the town&#x27;s ambition to become an international shipping and transportation hub ended with the growing importance of the Montreal and Halifax harbours.

During World War II, 3,000 soldiers were stationed at a naval base built at Sandy Beach to patrol the Gulf of Saint Lawrence against German submarines.

In 1959, Gaspé gained city status. In 1971, the city was greatly expanded when it amalgamated these 11 surrounding municipalities (with year of original incorporation):

* Baie-de-Gaspé-Nord (1855)
* Baie-de-Gaspé-Sud (1855)
* Douglastown (1855)
* Grande-Grève (1944)
* Haldimand (1953)
* L&#x27;Anse-aux-Griffons (1870)
* Rivière-au-Renard (1933)
* Saint-Alban-du-Cap-des-Rosiers (1896)
* Saint-Majorique (1966)
* Saint-Maurice (1923)
* York (1866)
In subsequent years, the city&#x27;s area was further expanded by absorbing large tracts of adjacent unorganized territory.

A representation of a small village, with a dozen houses serving as a historical site, was opened in 2015 in front of the Place Jacques-Cartier mall and above the boardwalk along the York River. The village is a monument to Cartier and serves as a museum for tourists and locals.

== Geography ==
In addition to the city, Gaspé&#x27;s territory includes the communities of Cap-aux-Os, Cap-des-Rosiers, Douglastown, Haldimand, Jersey Cove, L&#x27;Anse-à-Fugère, L&#x27;Anse-à-Valleau, L&#x27;Anse-au-Griffon, Penouille, Petit-Cap, Petite-Rivière-au-Renard, Pointe-Jaune, Rivière-au-Renard, Rivière-Morris, Sandy Beach, Saint-Majorique, Saint-Maurice-de-l&#x27;Échouerie, Wakeham, and York Centre. The city&#x27;s territory occupies and borders the sea and the St. Lawrence River for some . French is the first language of most of Gaspé&#x27;s population, where nearly 90% of the population is of French-Canadian origin.

===Climate===
In spite of its coastal position, Gaspé experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with vast seasonal differences in temperature. Summers are warm but relatively short, whereas winters are cold and long, but still far warmer than inland areas of the province given its coastal position. It stays above the subarctic range due to the seasonal lag keeping September temperatures above in daily mean. As a result of the seasonal lag, March is a proper winter month and is far colder than November. As typical of Quebec, precipitation and resulting snowfall is high due to the reliable winter temperatures below freezing.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Gaspé was on 27 June 2003. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 26 January 1897.

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Gaspé had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Economy==

The regional hospital is the main employer in the city. Tourism is a very important part of the city and the region&#x27;s economy. Many visitors come to the city to enjoy the environment and the surrounding attractions, such as Forillon National Park that is fully within the city&#x27;s boundaries. One of the main summer attractions for tourists is salmon fishing. The York River, Saint John&#x27;s River, and the Dartmouth River are where tourists and locals come to fish. It is not required to have a guide while fishing these rivers but a private guide can be hired upon request. Other tourist attractions include Haldimand Beach, Jacques Cartier&#x27;s Cross (stone monument), and a local museum which shelters the World War I and World War II cenotaph commemorating Gaspesian veterans.

Another big employer is the LM Wind Power Canada Inc. factory that makes the windmill blades to then have them transported elsewhere. The windmill factory is a tourist attraction where tourist can see the big size of the blades and have the opportunity to take a picture next to one. The factory was expanded in 2015 by a joint venture with Senvion to produce long-blade turbine components for the Mesgi&#x27;g Ugju&#x27;s&#x27;n wind farm, developed by Longueuil, Quebec-based Innergex in Avignon Township. The $365-million project, one of over two dozen financed by Hydro-Quebec and the provincial government, was completed on time in December 2016.

==Attractions==
===Cross of Gaspé===
In 1934, the Canadian government commissioned the installation of a monolithic granite cross in Gaspé, for the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Jacques Cartier in Gaspé as of July 24, 1534. This high monolithic cross had been cut from a block of gray granite extracted from the stone quarry of Augustus Dumas, in Rivière-à-Pierre in the Portneuf region, on North Shore of the Saint Lawrence River. The Cross of Gaspé weighs more than 42 tons and was transported by two railcars of the Canadian National Railway from Rivière-à-Pierre. The cross was carried on a coaster to the Gaspé wharf. The cross was erected on its base using a rail system of pulleys and cables, driven by horses. The original craftsmen would be listed at the top of the cross. This cross is the largest monolithic granite cross crafted in Canada.

A commemorative plaque located at the foot of the Cross in Gaspé was inaugurated on August 23, 2009, in memory of artisans from Rivière-à-Pierre who extracted and cut the block of granite. A replica of the Cross of Gaspé was crafted by Rivière-à-Pierre craftsmen and erected in the heart of the village of Rivière-à-Pierre. That granite cross is half the height of the original cross.

==Infrastructure==

Gaspé is accessible by automobile or Orléans Express bus service via Quebec Route 132, and the Michel-Pouliot Gaspé Airport.

The town is also accessible by Quebec Route 198 that passes through the interior of the peninsula. Select travellers can also access the town during the winter via one of the many snowmobile trails that run through the interior and connect with many other towns on the northern and southern coasts of the peninsula. In the summer the same trails are open to all-terrain vehicle travellers as well.
Via Rail&#x27;s Montreal–Gaspé train was terminated due to unsafe trackage sometime in 2013. The VIA Rail Train to Gaspé was being turned in New Carlisle, west of Gaspé. Via was offering bus service between New Carlisle and Gaspé. The line was undergoing repairs since December 2011. At present time Via has no plans to reinstate service on this line.

The Port of Gaspé has a two-sided wharf; on the one, it measures , with a depth of , and on the other measures with a depth of . The Port of Gaspé is accessible year-round with the occasional help of an icebreaker.

Its near neighbour Chandler is a port of call for &quot;Le Vacancier&quot;, a ferry which links Montréal to the Îles-de-la-Madeleine.

<doc id="505638" wikidata="Q2568387" url="?curid=505638" title="Jus ad bellum">
<text>( or ), literally &quot;right to war&quot; in Latin, refers to &quot;the conditions under which States may resort to war or to the use of armed force in general&quot;. Jus ad bellum is one pillar of just war theory. Just war theory states that war should only be condoned under &#x27;just&#x27; conditions. Jus ad bellum simply limits the causes for which war can be considered justifiable. The other parts of just war theory include jus in bello (just actions in war) and jus post bellum (justice after war).

== Historical background ==
The history of jus ad bellum dates back to early religious and philosophical ideas. There are references to the idea of morally fought wars dating back to ancient civilizations. Thousands of years later, these ideas still stand in today&#x27;s society. 

=== Early foundations ===
Many of the ancient civilizations have shown some degree of understanding of just war. One example can be found in Ancient Egypt. Early Egyptians viewed themselves as the cosmological center of civility. Therefore they put their faith in the gods alongside the pharaoh to have just reasons to engage in war. These include self defense, defense of their allies and against evil powers. Beyond the Egyptians, there have also been tracings of these core just war and jus ad bellum elements in Ancient Mesopotamia, Anatolia, the Levant and Hatti.

=== Christian just war ===
Many philosophers in the early centuries have dabbled in defining what is ethically and morally acceptable in war. However, St. Augustine is considered to be the father of just war theory. St. Augustine was a Roman Catholic who constructs the idea from a Christian perspective. He is the credited founder of the term jus ad bellum itself. Later came philosopher St. Thomas Aquinas with his Summa Theologiae&quot;.&quot; Aquinas lists criteria from the Christian perspective that were intended to protect civilians and guarantee that wars were not just fought for the interest of private parties.

=== Renaissance period ===
Francisco de Vitoria and Hugo Grotius grew the idea of just war theory into international law. Vitoria&#x27;s main argument presented that war should serve the common good. States should not be going to war for revenge or power. Hugo Grotius was another key thinker within the evolution of just war. He has been named father of international law. In his work, &quot;On the Law of War and Peace,&quot; Grotius emphasized the need for proportionality and accountability.

=== Modern international law ===
Today organizations such as League of Nations and United Nations stand to prevent unjust wars. The League of Nations was one of the first international organization established with a primary goal of maintaining world peace. It was established in 1920 after the World War I in order to protect the world from dealing with such tragedies again. Unfortunately they were not entirely successful in that mission due to the occurrence World War II. Thus the United Nations was born. In the UN Charter, Article 2, paragraph 4 states: &quot;All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.&quot; Article 51 of the UN Charter later clarifies: &quot;Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations.&quot; These put the idea of jus ad bellum into writing by requiring states to agree that they will only use armed force in self-defense, or with the approval of the United Nations Security Council. 

Since the 1950s, declarations of jus ad bellum have dropped dramatically. In &quot;Why States No Longer Declare War&quot; Tanisha Fazal notes the drop in formal declarations of war since the 1950s. This may be as a result of the nuance of war in modern times, given the rise of non-state actors such as terrorist groups.

==== Cyberspace ====
One of the more recent topics being discussed in scholarship is the application if international law in the realm of cyberspace. As cyber attacks continue to increase across the globe, a conversation needs to be had about the jurisdiction of cyber crimes. When is the use of force justified in these uncharted spaces? 

== Core principles ==

=== Just cause ===
According to the principle of right intention, the aim of war must not be to pursue narrowly defined national interests, but rather to re-establish a just peace. This state of peace should be preferable to the conditions that would have prevailed had the war not occurred. Wars cannot be fought simply to annex property or install a regime change. Current doctrines of &quot;anticipatory self-defense&quot; or preemptive strikes, sometimes associated with the Bush Doctrine, have challenged concepts of right intention/just cause. Right cause includes humanitarian intervention, particularly when actions &quot;shock the conscience&quot;. The responsibility to protect covers more in depth the nature of humanitarian intervention.

=== Legitimate authority ===
The principle of right authority suggests that a war is just only if waged by a legitimate authority. Such authority is rooted in the notion of state sovereignty. In his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot; St. Thomas Aquinas notes that to be a just war, war has not only to be declared publicly, but also must be declared by the proper authority.

Proper authority is what differentiates war from murder: &quot;It is the rules of warfare that give the practice meaning, that distinguish war from murder and soldiers from criminals.&quot; A soldier is treated as a prisoner of war and not a criminal because they are operating under the proper authority of the state and cannot be held individually responsible for actions committed under the orders of their military leadership.

=== Probability of success ===
According to this principle, there must be good grounds for concluding that aims of the just war are achievable. This principle emphasizes that mass violence must not be undertaken if it is unlikely to secure the just cause. This criterion is to avoid invasion for invasion&#x27;s sake and links to the proportionality criteria. One cannot invade if there is no chance of actually winning. However, wars are fought with imperfect knowledge, so one must simply be able to make a logical case that one can win; there is no way to know this in advance. These criteria move the conversation from moral and theoretical grounds to practical grounds. Essentially, this is meant to gather coalition building and win approval of other state actors.

=== Last resort ===
The principle of last resort stipulates that all non-violent options must first be exhausted before the use of force can be justified. Diplomatic options, sanctions, and other non-military methods must be attempted or validly ruled out before the engagement of hostilities. Further, in regard to the amount of harm—proportionally—the principle of last resort would support using small intervention forces first and then escalating rather than starting a war with massive force such as carpet bombing or nuclear warfare.

=== Proportionality ===
The principle of Proportionality is the idea of maintaining a balance. The desire to go to war must balance with the destruction or loss of life that the war will cause. If one is more than the other that is a breach in proportionality. There should never be extreme damage and loss of life for a cause that isn&#x27;t equally productive.

<doc id="505653" wikidata="Q3836001" url="?curid=505653" title="Lockheed EC-130H Compass Call">
<text>The EC-130H Compass Call is an electronic attack aircraft flown by the United States Air Force. Based on the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, the aircraft is heavily modified to disrupt enemy command and control communications, perform offensive counterinformation operations, and carry out other kinds of electronic attacks. Planned upgrades will add the ability to attack early warning and acquisition radars. Based at Davis-Monthan AFB in Arizona, EC-130Hs can be deployed worldwide at short notice to support U.S. and allied strategic and tactical air, surface, and special operations forces.

The EC-130H is one of the three main U.S. electronic warfare aircraft, along with the Boeing EA-18G Growler, and F-16CJ Fighting Falcon, all of which can suppress enemy air defenses while jamming communications, radar, and command-and-control targets.

In September 2017, the Air Force announced that L3 Technologies will serve as the lead systems integrator for a future Compass Call aircraft based on the Gulfstream G550 business jet. The new Compass Call platform was designated as EA-37B by Air Combat Command on November 14, 2023. The EC-130H is based on the C-130 Hercules, which is a mid-sized four turboprop engine military transport originally developed in the 1950s, but has been upgraded many times and been the basis for many specialized versions including for electronic warfare. (see Lockheed EC-130)

== Design ==

=== Crew ===

The EC-130H aircraft carries a combat crew of 13 people. Four members handle aircraft flight and navigation (aircraft commander, co-pilot, navigator, and flight engineer), while nine members operate and employ the EA mission equipment permanently integrated into the cargo/mission compartment. The mission crew includes the mission crew commander (electronic warfare officer), weapon system officer (electronic warfare officer), mission crew supervisor (an experienced cryptologic linguist), four analysis operators (linguists), one acquisition operator, and an airborne maintenance technician.

=== Aircraft ===

The EC-130H fleet is composed of a mix of Baseline 1 and 2 aircraft.

The Block 35 Baseline 1 EC-130H provides the Air Force with additional capabilities to jam communication, Early Warning/Acquisition radar, and navigation systems through higher effective radiated power, extended frequency range, and insertion of digital signal processing compared to earlier EC-130Hs.

Baseline 1 aircraft have the flexibility to keep pace with adversary use of emerging technology. It promotes enhanced crew proficiency, maintenance, and sustainment with a common fleet configuration, new operator interface, increased reliability, and better fault detection.

Baseline 2 has several upgrades to ease operator workload and improve effectiveness. Improved external communications allow Compass Call crews to maintain situational awareness and connectivity in dynamic operational and tactical environments. Aircraft communication capabilities are improved with the expansion of satellite communications connectivity compatible with emerging DoD architectures, increased multi-asset coordination nets, and upgraded data-link terminals.

Delivery of Baseline-2 provides the Air Force with the equivalent of a &quot;fifth generation electronic attack capability,&quot; providing improved aircraft performance and survivability.

A majority of the improvements found in the EC-130H Compass Call Baseline-2 are classified modifications to the mission system that enhance precision and increase attack capabilities.

== Operational history ==

The Compass Call had its first flight in 1981, was delivered to the Air Force in 1982, and reached initial operating capability in 1983.

All EC-130H Compass Call aircraft are assigned to Air Combat Command. The EC-130H is operated by the 55th Electronic Combat Group (ECG) consisting of two operational squadrons (41st and 43rd Electronic Combat Squadron (ECS)), a formal training unit (the 42nd ECS), the 755th Operations Support Squadron (OSS), and the 755th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS). The 55th ECG is a tenant unit of the 355th Fighter Wing at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona. Although located at Davis-Monthan, the group reports to the 55th Wing at Offutt AFB, Nebraska.

Compass Call has been used in Yugoslavia, Haiti, Panama, Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.

From 2002 to 2015, EC-130Hs participating in Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan and Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel flew over 40,000 hours during 6,900 combat sorties.

On 15 January 2020, the first EC-130H Compass Call (serial number 73-01587) was retired from active service. The aircraft was the first EC-130H Compass Call delivered to the Air Force in March 1982.

<text>Christl Haas (19 September 1943 – 8 July 2001) was an Austrian Alpine skier. She competed at the 1964 and 1968 Winter Olympics and won a gold and a bronze medal, respectively.

==Biography==
Haas grew up in Hahnenkamm, Kitzbühel, known for its alpine skiing courses. At the World Cup she won four downhill competitions in total. At the Alpine skiing World Championship 1962 in Chamonix, France, she won gold in the downhill competition.

Haas became a national hero as a twenty-year-old Olympic champion in the downhill event at the first Innsbruck Winter Olympics. She became an instant superstar in her homeland as she won the gold medal in her home nation. Haas followed up her success at Innsbruck with a bronze medal at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France.

After retiring from competitions Haas became a ski instructor and opened a sporting goods store in Sankt Johann. As an Austrian gold medalist, Haas was selected with luger Josef Feistmantl to light the Olympic torch for the opening of the 1976 Winter Olympics on 4 February 1976. In 2001, she had a heart attack while swimming in the Mediterranean Sea at Antalya, Turkey and died as a result.

<doc id="505664" wikidata="Q366371" url="?curid=505664" title="Adore (album)">
<text>Adore is the fourth studio album by the American alternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins, released on June 2, 1998, by Virgin Records. After the multi-platinum success of &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; and a subsequent world tour, &quot;Adore&quot; was considered &quot;one of the most anticipated albums of 1998&quot; by MTV. Recording the album proved to be a challenge as the band members struggled with lingering interpersonal problems, musical uncertainty in the wake of three increasingly successful rock albums, and the departure of drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Frontman Billy Corgan would later characterize &quot;Adore&quot; as made by &quot;a band falling apart&quot;. Corgan was also going through a divorce and the death of his mother while recording the album.

The result was a much more subdued and electronica-tinged sound that Greg Kot of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine called &quot;a complete break with the past&quot;. The album divided the Smashing Pumpkins fan base and was not as commercially successful as their previous two albums. However, similar to the band&#x27;s other releases across the decade, the album was critically acclaimed, with praise directed at Corgan&#x27;s vocal performance, Iha&#x27;s more subtle guitar work, atmospheric sound, and more mature songwriting.
It became the bands third straight album to be nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Performance and has retrospectively gained a cult following. A remastered and expanded version of the album was released on CD and vinyl in September 2014 as a part of the band&#x27;s project to reissue their back catalogue from 1991 to 2000. This is their only album to be recorded as trio and their first album not to feature an official drummer.

==Background==

The Smashing Pumpkins had cemented their place as a cultural force with 1995&#x27;s multi-platinum &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;. Feeling the limitations of their guitar-driven hard rock sound, the band had started to branch out during the making of &quot;Mellon Collie&quot;, and, after the chart-topping success of the electronic-leaning &quot;1979&quot;, the band zeroed in on electronica.
As the sprawling and massively successful &quot;Infinite Sadness&quot; tour wound down, Billy Corgan found himself facing many difficult issues, including musical burnout, the absence of his &quot;best friend and musical soul mate in the band&quot; Jimmy Chamberlin, the end of his marriage, and the death of his mother to cancer.

During this period, the band released two new singles on movie soundtracks—&quot;Eye&quot; and &quot;The End Is the Beginning Is the End&quot;. Both songs incorporated electronic elements, yet retained the hard rock elements of the band&#x27;s previous material; one reviewer called the two singles &quot;balls-out, full-energy chargers&quot; and wrote off the Pumpkins&#x27; previous remarks that the upcoming album would &quot;rock&quot; less. However, the new album material Corgan was writing consisted mainly of simple acoustic songs. Corgan, James Iha, D&#x27;arcy Wretzky, and Matt Walker spent a few days in the studio in February 1997 laying down demos mostly as live takes, and the band hoped to quickly record an entire album in such a manner. Corgan, hoping to maintain the band&#x27;s progressive rock-inspired experimentation, soon had second thoughts about this approach and began envisioning a hybrid of folk rock and electronica that was at once &quot;ancient&quot; and &quot;futuristic&quot;.

==Recording==

The Smashing Pumpkins started demoing in February 1997 and recorded 30 songs for the album which, at one point, looked set to be a double album. The band subsequently cut the number of tracks on the album to 14.

After playing several festival dates in summer 1997, the band began working at a variety of Chicago studios with producer Brad Wood—with whom Corgan previously had worked in the early 1990s. While &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; had mostly been recorded with the full participation of all the band members, the band dynamics during the new sessions soon muddled as Corgan, uninspired by his bandmates, worked mostly alone. Wood, too, was leaving Corgan unsatisfied, so, after six weeks in Chicago, the band—minus Wood and Matt Walker—relocated to Los Angeles and started work at Sunset Sound, with Corgan now the de facto producer.

The band rented a house and hoped living communally would foster good relations and a happier recording environment. According to Corgan, Iha refused to live in the house and rarely visited. The recording sessions continued to be slow-moving and heavily technical. In the absence of a drummer, the band used a drum machine as it had in its earliest incarnation. The band also enlisted Joey Waronker, of Beck&#x27;s band, and Matt Cameron, of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, for a few songs each. Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb contributed electronic sequencing and sounds to eight album tracks, with the band giving him mostly free rein.

At the behest of the band&#x27;s management, Rick Rubin was brought in to produce one song, &quot;Let Me Give the World to You&quot;, but the song was left off the album, later to be re-recorded for &quot;Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music&quot;. With around thirty songs recorded, Corgan began to see an end and enlisted &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; co-producer Flood to help finish the recording, pull the album together, and mix the songs.

Art direction for the album is credited to Frank Olinsky, Billy Corgan, and Corgan&#x27;s then-girlfriend and frequent collaborator Yelena Yemchuk. The artwork for the album and its singles consisted almost entirely of black-and-white photographs shot by Yemchuk, many of which featured model Amy Wesson.

===Music===

Corgan was deliberately setting out to widen his band&#x27;s sound and message, explaining that he was not &quot;talking to teenagers anymore. I&#x27;m talking to everyone now. It&#x27;s a wider dialogue. I&#x27;m talking to people who are older than me and younger than me, and our generation as well.&quot; He said much of the record was &quot;an attempt to go back to what&#x27;s important at a musical core and build it outward&quot;. He would later reflect that he was &quot;stuck on the idea that [he] needed to prove [he] was an artist, which is the death knell of any artist&quot;.

The music on &quot;Adore&quot; has been categorized by reviewers as electronic rock, gothic rock, art rock, synth-pop, and industrial rock. Distorted guitars and live drums, the previous hallmarks of the Pumpkins sound, took a back seat in a sonic palette that included much more synthesizers, drum programming, acoustic guitar, and piano. At least five songs on the album are driven chiefly by piano.

&quot;Tear&quot; was written for the &quot;Lost Highway&quot; soundtrack but was rejected by David Lynch in favor of &quot;Eye&quot;. &quot;Pug&quot; was originally recorded as a &quot;minor key blues death march&quot; with drums by Matt Cameron, while the album version uses drum programming. The only song on the album to feature Cameron, &quot;For Martha&quot;, is a tribute to Corgan&#x27;s mother that was primarily recorded as one live take.

Apart from being the first album without Jimmy Chamberlin, &quot;Adore&quot; was the first album to not include writing contributions from James Iha, who was concurrently working on his solo album &quot;Let It Come Down&quot;. However, he did contribute the track &quot;Summer&quot; to the &quot;Perfect&quot; single.

==Promotion and release==

The lead-up to &quot;Adore&quot; was marked by conflicting statements as to the album&#x27;s sound—Corgan initially said the band was heading in the direction of the heavy-metal-guitar-and-electronic music-driven &quot;The End Is the Beginning Is the End&quot; in summer 1997. while the band&#x27;s management reported the album would be all acoustic. In early 1998, Corgan called the sound &quot;arcane night music&quot;, elaborating, &quot;The people that say it&#x27;s acoustic will be wrong. The people that say it&#x27;s electronic will be wrong. The people that say it&#x27;s a Pumpkins record will be wrong. I will try to make something that is indescribable&quot;. Further complicating the situation was the record label&#x27;s initial insistence to use the Rick Rubin-produced, upbeat, poppy song &quot;Let Me Give the World to You&quot; as the album&#x27;s lead single, something Corgan strongly objected to, fearing it would give listeners the wrong first impression of the album. Corgan had to drop the song off the track list altogether to avoid using it as a single.

&quot;Adore&quot; was released on June 2, 1998, in most of the world, the same day the video for first single &quot;Ava Adore&quot; premiered. The album booklet and music video showcased the band&#x27;s new gothic look. The second single, &quot;Perfect&quot;, was also accompanied by a music video, which debuted on August 16.

==Touring==

After the release of &quot;Adore&quot;, the band embarked on a scaled-back 14-show world tour entitled &quot;An Evening with the Smashing Pumpkins&quot; to support &quot;Adore&quot;. Abroad, the Pumpkins played at what had been called an &quot;eclectic mix of interesting venues&quot;, among them the rooftop of a FNAC record store in Paris, France, in the botanic gardens of Brussels, Belgium, at the Cannes Film Festival, and at an International Shipping Harbor in Sydney, Australia. In the United States, the Pumpkins donated 100% of their ticket profits to local charities (yet one stop on the tour, Minneapolis, was a free concert and underestimated the attendance of the show). In the end, the Pumpkins, with the help of their fans, raised over $2.8 million in this manner.

The lineup was the most expansive yet, including former John Mellencamp and Melissa Etheridge drummer Kenny Aronoff, percussionists Dan Morris and Stephen Hodges, and David Bowie pianist Mike Garson. Violinist Lisa Germano was also set to appear, but did not ultimately appear in the touring lineup. The set was mainly &quot;Adore&quot; material, with only a handful of reworked &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; songs and no songs from prior to 1995, eliminating many of their radio hits and fan favorites, with the exception of some shows performed in South American countries like Brazil and Chile, where they played for the first time, so they included old hits like &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Disarm&quot;.

In retrospect, Corgan regretted the decision to hire the two percussionists to play alongside Aronoff, instead of having the drummer play along with loops from the album. &quot;That drove Kenny up the wall because Kenny has perfect time and one guy played on top and the other behind. I remember Kenny saying, &#x27;I feel like I&#x27;m tripping on LSD&#x27; because he kept hearing things that were not in time, and it drove him crazy,&quot; said Corgan in the &quot;Adore&quot; reissue liner notes. Performing with Garson was also challenging because, according to Corgan, &quot;he made a decision 40 years ago that he would live in the intuitive flow of what he was feeling, so he literally cannot play the same thing twice. So we&#x27;d have gigs where he&#x27;d have that same magic as on &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; and the next night he&#x27;d come and play the extreme opposite style—like honkytonk. I really respect Mike, but to play with him was always challenging; precisely because he is such a supreme musician.&quot;

==Reception==

Critical reception to &quot;Adore&quot; was generally positive. Greg Kot of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine regarded &quot;Adore&quot; as &quot;the most intimate album the Pumpkins have ever made and also the prettiest, a parade of swooning melodies and gentle, unfolding nocturnes&quot;. Ryan Schreiber of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described the album as &quot;the Pumpkins&#x27; best offering since &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described &quot;Adore&quot; as &quot;a hushed, elegiac album that sounds curiously out of time&quot;. &quot;Adore&quot; was considered one of &quot;an inspiring range of 25 classic alternative American albums&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. The lyrics received particular praise from critics—Jim DeRogatis of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, who in 1993 had criticized Corgan&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;too often sound[ing] like sophomoric poetry&quot;, said Corgan &quot;took a big leap forward as a lyricist&quot; starting with &quot;Adore&quot;. Schreiber, who criticized &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; as &quot;lyrical rock-bottom&quot;, called &quot;Adore&quot;″s lyrics &quot;poetic&quot;, particularly singling out &quot;To Sheila&quot;. Greg Kot emphasized the &quot;oblique, private longings, and weighty, sometimes awkward conceits&quot; in the lyrics, while David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called them &quot;unsettled and unsettling&quot;. The contributions of Wretzky and Iha also received praise, with Kot noting that &quot;Iha&#x27;s quirky guitar accents and Wretzky&#x27;s unflashy resolve [...] give &quot;Adore&quot; a warmth and camaraderie no other Pumpkins album can match.&quot;

Despite this, public reception to &quot;Adore&quot; was lukewarm. &quot;Adore&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number two with 174,000 units of the album sold in its first week, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) five weeks later, but the album soon departed the charts, leaving &quot;Adore&quot; far short of the sales figures of its predecessors. Two additional promotional singles, &quot;Crestfallen&quot; and &quot;To Sheila&quot;, were released to radio stations but failed to gain traction and were never released as commercial singles. As of May 2005, &quot;Adore&quot; has sold 1.1 million units in the US and at least three times as many copies worldwide.

Corgan blamed himself for the record&#x27;s reception with the public, saying he &quot;made the mistake of telling people it was a techno record&quot; and that if he &quot;would have told everyone &quot;Adore&quot; was the Pumpkins&#x27; acoustic album we would have never had the problems that we had&quot;. Corgan wrote on the band&#x27;s website that the album&#x27;s title was &quot;misunderstood&quot; and &quot;a joke that no one ever got&quot;, explaining that &quot;Adore&quot; was meant as a play on &quot;A Door&quot;, meaning the album would offer a new entrance to the band&#x27;s career. In 2005, Corgan would call the making of the album &quot;one of the most painful experiences of my life&quot;.

===2014 CD/DVD reissue===

As part of Virgin/Universal Music&#x27;s reissue campaign, a special edition of the album was released on September 23, 2014. The release consists of the original album remastered and 91 bonus tracks of previously unreleased material, demos and alternate versions of &quot;Adore&quot;-era songs. It was released in five formats: the physical box set containing all 107 tracks, the digital deluxe edition containing 74 of the bonus tracks, as well as single disc CD and double-LP versions containing only the stereo remaster of the album. The digital version of the reissue was released on October 3, 2014.

The actual &quot;Adore&quot; album was remastered by Bob Ludwig. The entire set includes session outtakes and a mono version of the album, with Corgan saying the new mixes contain &quot;elements from the original sessions that were stored digitally, but never used; such as some of the work done by Bon Harris&quot;.

The package also includes a DVD consisting of footage of the band&#x27;s show from August 4, 1998, at the Fox Theater in Atlanta, Georgia.

<doc id="505670" wikidata="Q233362" url="?curid=505670" title="Helen Reddy">
<text>Helen Maxine Reddy (25 October 194129 September 2020) was an Australian-American singer, actress, television host, and activist. Born in Melbourne to a show business family, Reddy started her career as an entertainer at age four. She sang on radio and television and won a talent contest on the television program &quot;Bandstand&quot; in 1966; her prize was a ticket to New York City and a record audition, which was unsuccessful. After a short and unsuccessful singing career in New York, she eventually moved to Chicago, and subsequently, Los Angeles, where she made her debut singles &quot;One Way Ticket&quot; and &quot;I Believe in Music&quot; in 1968 and 1970, respectively. The B-side of the latter single, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know How to Love Him&quot;, reached number eight on the pop chart of the Canadian magazine &quot;RPM&quot;. She was signed to Capitol Records a year later.

During the 1970s, Reddy enjoyed international success, especially in the United States, where she placed 15 singles on the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Six made the top 10 and three reached number one, including her signature hit &quot;I Am Woman&quot;. 
She placed 25 songs on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart; 15 made the top 10 and eight reached number one, six consecutively. In 1974, at the inaugural American Music Awards, she won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist. On television, she was the first Australian to host a one-hour weekly primetime variety show on an American network, along with specials that were seen in more than 40 countries.

Between the 1980s and 1990s, as her single &quot;I Can&#x27;t Say Goodbye to You&quot; (1981) became her last to chart in the US, Reddy acted in musicals and recorded albums such as &quot;Center Stage&quot; before retiring from live performance in 2002. She returned to university in Australia, earned a degree, and practised as a clinical hypnotherapist and motivational speaker. In 2011, after singing &quot;Breezin&#x27; Along with the Breeze&quot; with her half-sister, Toni Lamond, for Lamond&#x27;s birthday, Reddy decided to return to live performing.

Reddy&#x27;s song &quot;I Am Woman&quot; played a significant role in popular culture, becoming an anthem for second-wave feminism. She came to be known as a &quot;feminist poster girl&quot; or a &quot;feminist icon&quot;. 
In 2011, &quot;Billboard&quot; named her the number-28 adult contemporary artist of all time (the number-9 woman). In 2013, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; dubbed her the &quot;Queen of &#x27;70s Pop&quot;.

==Early years==
Helen Maxine Reddy was born into a well-known Australian showbusiness family in Melbourne. Her mother was Stella Campbell (née Lamond), an actress, singer and dancer; her father was Maxwell David Reddy (born 1914 in Melbourne, Victoria), a writer, producer and actor. Her mother performed at the Majestic Theatre in Sydney and was best-known as a regular cast member on the television programs &quot;Homicide&quot; (1964), &quot;Bellbird&quot; (1967) and &quot;Country Town&quot; (1971). During Reddy&#x27;s childhood, she was educated at Tintern Grammar and later Stratherne Girls&#x27; School in Hawthorn for a short time (mostly to study drama). Her half-sister Toni Lamond and her nephew Tony Sheldon are actor-singers.

Reddy had Irish, Scottish and English ancestry. Her great-great-grandfather, Edward Reddy, was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1855. Her Scottish great-grandfather, Thomas Lamond, was a one-time mayor of Waterloo, New South Wales, whose patron was Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead. Patsy Reddy, a former New Zealand governor-general, is a distant cousin.

Reddy was born during World War II. Her father was a sergeant in the Australian Army with a unit of entertainers, serving in New Guinea with one of his actor friends, Peter Finch, at the time of Reddy&#x27;s birth. Her father returned to service during the Korean War.

At age four, Reddy joined her parents on the Australian vaudeville circuit, singing and dancing; she recalled: &quot;It was instilled in me: &#x27;You will be a star&#x27;. So between the ages of 12 and 17, I got rebellious and decided this was not for me. I was going to be a housewife and mother.&quot; At age 12, owing to her parents&#x27; constant touring nationwide and their arguing, Reddy went to live with her paternal aunt, Helen &quot;Nell&quot; Reddy, &quot;who was her role model&quot;; as her aunt, &quot;she gave her niece stability, a sense of morality, and strength&quot; for her future career as a singer who motivated women. The younger Helen&#x27;s teenaged rebellion in favour of domesticity manifested as marriage to Kenneth Claude Weate, a considerably older musician and family friend; divorce ensued, and to support herself as a single mother to daughter Traci, she resumed her performing career, concentrating on singing, since health problems precluded dancing (she had a kidney removed at 17). She sang on radio and television, eventually winning a talent contest on the Australian pop music TV show &quot;Bandstand&quot;, the prize ostensibly being a trip to New York City to cut a single for Mercury Records. After arriving in New York in 1966, she was informed by Mercury that her prize was only the chance to &quot;audition&quot; for the label and that Mercury considered the &quot;Bandstand&quot; footage to constitute her audition, which was deemed unsuccessful. Despite having only and a return ticket to Australia, she decided to remain in the United States with three-year-old Traci and pursue a singing career.

==Music career==
===1966–1968: Early career===
Reddy recalled her 1966 appearance at the Three Rivers Inn in Syracuse, New York—&quot;[T]here were like twelve people in the audience&quot;—as being typical of her early US performing career. Her lack of a work permit made it difficult to obtain singing jobs and she was forced to make trips to Canada which did not require work permits for citizens of Commonwealth countries. In 1968, Martin St James, an Australian stage hypnotist she had met in New York City, threw Reddy a party with an admission price of to enable Reddy—then down to her last —to pay her rent. On this occasion, Reddy met her future manager and husband, Jeff Wald, a 22-year-old secretary at the William Morris Agency who crashed the party. Reddy told &quot;People&quot; in 1975, &quot;[Wald] didn&#x27;t pay the five dollars, but it was love at first sight.&quot;

Wald recalled that Reddy and he married three days after meeting and, along with daughter Traci, the couple took up residence at the Hotel Albert in Greenwich Village. Reddy later stated that she married Wald &quot;out of desperation over her right to work and live in the United States&quot;. According to &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, Wald was fired from William Morris soon after having met Reddy and &quot;Helen supported them for six months doing $35-a-night hospital and charity benefits. They were so broke that they snuck out of a hotel room carrying their clothes in paper bags.&quot; Reddy recalled: &quot;When we did eat, it was spaghetti, and we spent what little money we had on cockroach spray.&quot; They left New York City for Chicago, where Wald landed a job as talent coordinator at Mister Kelly&#x27;s. While in Chicago, Reddy gained a reputation singing in local lounges, including Mister Kelly&#x27;s, and in 1968 she landed a deal with Fontana Records, a division of major-label Chicago-based Mercury Records. Her first single, &quot;One Way Ticket&quot;, on Fontana was not an American hit but it did give Reddy her first appearance on any chart as it peaked at number 83 in her native Australia.

===1969–1975: &quot;I Am Woman&quot; era and stardom===
Within a year, Wald moved Reddy and Traci to Los Angeles, where he was hired at Capitol Records, the label under which Reddy was to attain stardom; however, Wald was hired and fired the same day. At the same time, in 1969, Reddy enrolled at the University of California Los Angeles to study psychology and philosophy part-time.

Reddy became frustrated as Wald found success managing acts such as Deep Purple and Tiny Tim without making any evident effort to promote her; after 18 months of career inactivity, Reddy gave Wald an ultimatum: &quot;he [must] either revitalise her career or get out... Jeff threw himself into his new career as Mr. Helen Reddy. Five months of phone calls to Capitol Records executive Artie Mogull finally paid off; Mogull agreed to let Helen cut one single if Jeff promised not to call for a month. She did &quot;I Believe in Music&quot; penned by Mac Davis backed with &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know How to Love Him&quot; from Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. The A-side fell flat, but then some Canadian DJs flipped the record over and it became a hit – number 13 in June 1971 – and Helen Reddy was on her way.&quot;

Reddy&#x27;s stardom was solidified when her single &quot;I Am Woman&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in December 1972. The song was co-written by Reddy with Ray Burton; Reddy attributed the impetus for writing &quot;I Am Woman&quot; and her early awareness of the women&#x27;s movement to expatriate Australian rock critic and pioneer feminist Lillian Roxon. Reddy is quoted in Fred Bronson&#x27;s &quot;The &quot;Billboard&quot; Book of Number One Hits&quot; as having said that she was looking for songs to record which reflected the positive self-image she had gained from joining the women&#x27;s movement but could not find any, so &quot;I realised that the song I was looking for didn&#x27;t exist, and I was going to have to write it myself.&quot;
&quot;I Am Woman&quot; first appeared on her debut album &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know How to Love Him&quot;, released in May 1971. A new recording of the song was released as a single in May 1972 but barely dented the charts. Female listeners soon adopted the song as an anthem and began requesting it from their local radio stations in droves, resulting in its September chart re-entry and eventual number-one peak. &quot;I Am Woman&quot; earned Reddy a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. At the awards ceremony, Reddy concluded her acceptance speech by famously thanking God &quot;because She makes everything possible&quot;. The success of &quot;I Am Woman&quot; made Reddy the first Australian singer to top the US charts.

Three decades after her Grammy, Reddy discussed the song&#x27;s iconic status: &quot;I think it came along at the right time. I&#x27;d gotten involved in the women&#x27;s movement, and there were a lot of songs on the radio about being weak and being dainty and all those sort of things. All the women in my family, they were strong women. They worked. They lived through the Depression and a world war, and they were just strong women. I certainly didn&#x27;t see myself as being dainty&quot;, she said.

Over the next five years following her first success, Reddy had more than a dozen US top-40 hits, including two more number-one hits. These tracks included Kenny Rankin&#x27;s &quot;Peaceful&quot; (number 12), the Alex Harvey country ballad &quot;Delta Dawn&quot; (number one), Linda Laurie&#x27;s &quot;Leave Me Alone (Ruby Red Dress)&quot; (number three), Danny Janssen &amp; Bobby Hart&#x27;s &quot;Keep on Singing&quot; (number 15), Paul Williams&#x27; &quot;You and Me Against the World&quot; (featuring daughter Traci reciting the spoken bookends) (number 9), Alan O&#x27;Day&#x27;s &quot;Angie Baby&quot; (number one), Véronique Sanson and Patti Dahlstrom&#x27;s &quot;Emotion&quot; (number 22), Harriet Schock&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Way to Treat a Lady&quot; (number eight) and the Richard Kerr/Will Jennings-penned &quot;Somewhere in the Night&quot; (number 19). She also had two Australian number-one singles, while &quot;Angie Baby&quot; was her only UK top-40 hit.
On 23 July 1974, Reddy received a star, located at 1750 Vine Street, on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her work in the music industry.

In late 1975, Reddy toured East Asia, Australia and New Zealand and collected 16 gold records, including 6 gold records in Australia and 6 gold records in New Zealand.

At the height of her fame in the mid 1970s, Reddy was a headliner, with a full chorus of backup singers and dancers to standing-room-only crowds on the Las Vegas Strip. Among her opening acts were Joan Rivers, David Letterman, Bill Cosby and Barry Manilow. In 1976, Reddy recorded the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot; for the musical documentary &quot;All This and World War II&quot;.

Reddy was also instrumental in supporting the career of friend Olivia Newton-John, encouraging her to move from England to the United States in the early 1970s, giving her professional opportunities that did not exist in the United Kingdom. At a dinner party at Reddy&#x27;s house, Newton-John met producer Allan Carr, who offered her the starring role in the hit film version of the musical &quot;Grease&quot;.

===1976–1990: Career decline===
Reddy was most successful on the Easy Listening chart, scoring eight number-one hits there over a three-year span, from &quot;Delta Dawn&quot; in 1973 to &quot;I Can&#x27;t Hear You No More&quot; in 1976. However, the latter track evidenced a sharp drop in popularity for Reddy, with a number-29 peak on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Reddy&#x27;s 1977 remake of Cilla Black&#x27;s 1964 hit &quot;You&#x27;re My World&quot; indicated comeback potential, with a number-18 peak, but this track – co-produced by Kim Fowley – would prove to be Reddy&#x27;s last top-40 hit. Its source album, &quot;Ear Candy&quot;, Reddy&#x27;s 10th album, became her first album to not attain at least gold status since her second full-length release, 1972&#x27;s &quot;Helen Reddy&quot;.

In 1978, Reddy sang as a backup singer on Gene Simmons&#x27;s solo album on the song &quot;True Confessions&quot;. That year also saw the release of Reddy&#x27;s only live album, &quot;Live in London,&quot; recorded at the London Palladium.

Of Reddy&#x27;s eight subsequent single releases on Capitol, five reached the Easy Listening top 50 – including &quot;Candle on the Water&quot;, from the 1977 Disney film &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; (which starred Reddy). Only three ranked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100: &quot;The Happy Girls&quot; (number 57) – the follow-up to &quot;You&#x27;re My World&quot;, and besides &quot;I Am Woman&quot;, Reddy&#x27;s only chart item that she co-wrote – and the disco tracks &quot;Ready or Not&quot; (number 73) and &quot;Make Love to Me&quot; (number 60), the latter a cover of an Australian hit by Kelly Marie, which gave Reddy a lone R&amp;B chart ranking at number 59. Reddy also made it to number 98 on the Country chart with &quot;Laissez les bon Temps Rouler&quot;, the B-side to &quot;The Happy Girls&quot;.

Without the impetus of any major hits, Reddy&#x27;s four Capitol album releases subsequent to &quot;Ear Candy&quot; failed to chart. In 1981, she said: &quot;I signed [with Capitol] ten years ago ... And when you are with a company so long you tend to be taken for granted. For the last three years, I didn&#x27;t feel I was getting the support from them.&quot;

May 1981 had the release of &quot;Play Me Out&quot;, Reddy&#x27;s debut album for MCA Records, which she said had &quot;made me a deal we [Reddy and Wald] couldn&#x27;t refuse&quot;; &quot;we shopped around and felt the most enthusiasm at MCA&quot;. Reddy&#x27;s new label affiliation would result in only one minor success; her remake of Becky Hobbs&#x27;s 1979 country hit &quot;I Can&#x27;t Say Goodbye to You&quot; returned her for the last time to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 88; it also returned Reddy to the charts in the UK and Ireland (her sole previous hit in both was &quot;Angie Baby&quot;). Her 14 November 1981 &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; performance brought &quot;I Can&#x27;t Say Goodbye to You&quot; into the UK top 50; the track would rise there no higher than number 43, but in Ireland reached number 16, giving Reddy her final high placing on a major national chart. MCA released one further Reddy album, &quot;Imagination&quot;, in 1983; it would prove to be Reddy&#x27;s final release as a career recording artist.

The unsuccessful &quot;Imagination&quot; was released just after the finalisation of Reddy&#x27;s divorce from Wald, whose alleged subsequent interference in her career she blamed for the decline of her career profile in the mid-1980s: &quot;Several of my performing contracts were cancelled, and one promoter told me he couldn&#x27;t book me in case a certain someone &#x27;came after him with a shotgun&#x27;.&quot; Reddy states that she was effectively being blacklisted from her established performance areas, which led to her pursuing a career in theatre where Wald had no significant influence.

===1990s–2000: Later recordings===
In 1990, Reddy issued &quot;Feel So Young&quot; on her own labelan album that includes remakes of her repertoire favourites. Meanwhile, her one recording in the interim had been the 1987 dance maxisingle &quot;Mysterious Kind&quot;, on which Reddy had vocally supported Jessica Williams. The 1997 release of &quot;Center Stage&quot; was an album of show tunes which Reddy recorded for Varèse Sarabande; the track &quot;Surrender&quot;originating in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;was remixed for release as a dance maxisingle. Reddy&#x27;s final album was the 2000 seasonal release &quot;The Best Christmas Ever&quot;. In April 2015, Reddy released a cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; for the album &quot;Keep Calm and Salute The Beatles&quot; on the Purple Pyramid label.

===2002–2010: Retirement===

Reddy announced her retirement from performing in 2002, giving her farewell performance with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra. The same year, she moved from her longtime residence in Santa Monica, California, back to her native Australia to spend time with her family, living first on Norfolk Island before taking up residence in Sydney.

Reddy also earned a degree in clinical hypnotherapy and neuro-linguistic programming. She was a practising clinical hypnotherapist and patron of the Australian Society of Clinical Hypnotherapists.

At a ceremony in August 2006, Reddy was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame by actress singer, Toni Collette, who described her song, &quot;I Am Woman&quot;, as &quot;timeless&quot;. The song was performed by fellow Australian, Vanessa Amorosi.

In April 2008, Reddy was reported to be living &quot;simply and frugally off song royalties, pension funds, and social security ... [renting] a 13th-floor apartment with a 180° view of Sydney Harbour&quot;. Her apartment had been recently appraised, causing Reddy concern over its future affordability; however, the New York-based landlord learned his tenant&#x27;s identity and wrote her: &quot;I had no idea it was &quot;the&quot; Helen Reddy who was living in my unit. Because of what you have done for millions of women all over the world, I will not sell or raise your rent. I hope you&#x27;ll be very happy living there for years to come.&quot;

For several years, Reddy maintained that she would not return to the stage. In 2008, she stated, &quot;It&#x27;s not going to happen. I&#x27;ve moved on&quot;, and explained that her voice had deepened to a lower key and she was not sure if she would be able to sing some of her hits. She also said that she had simply lost interest in performing, saying that &quot;I have very wide-ranging interests&quot;. In 2011 she was interviewed by Australian television and said she was very happy to be retired from show business.

===2011–2020: Brief comeback to concerts===
In 2011, Reddy decided to return to performing after being buoyed by the warm reception she received when she sang at her sister&#x27;s 80th birthday party. &quot;I hadn&#x27;t heard my voice in 10 years, and when I heard it coming over the speaker, it was like: &#x27;Oh, that&#x27;s not bad. Maybe I should do that again,&#x27;&quot; Reddy explained in 2013.

Being more in control of her performances also appealed to Reddy, who said, &quot;I have more leeway in the songs that I choose to sing. I&#x27;m not locked into what the record company wants.&quot; She explained, &quot;One of the reasons that I&#x27;m coming back to singing is because I&#x27;m not doing the greatest hits. I&#x27;m doing the songs that I always loved. So many are album cuts that never got any airplay, and they&#x27;re gorgeous songs.&quot; She also performed many of her best-known songs, including, &quot;Angie Baby&quot;, &quot;You and Me Against the World&quot;, a medley of &quot;Delta Dawn&quot;/&quot;Ain&#x27;t No Way to Treat a Lady&quot;, and &quot;I Am Woman&quot;, reasoning on the latter that the audience &quot;comes to hear&quot; it.

She said she refused to sing &quot;Leave Me Alone (Ruby Red Dress)&quot; because she disliked the monotony of the repeated chorus. &quot;They used to have a contest on the radio that you could get two free tickets to Helen Reddy&#x27;s show if you could tell us how many times she sang &quot;leave me alone&quot;. I think it was like 42 times,&quot; she said.

Reddy appeared in downtown Los Angeles at the 2017 Women&#x27;s March on 21 January. The march for women&#x27;s rights and unity following the inauguration of Donald Trump brought out 750,000 people. Reddy was introduced by actress Jamie Lee Curtis and sang an &quot;a cappella&quot; version of &quot;I Am Woman&quot;.

In August 2015, unnamed sources revealed that Reddy was diagnosed with dementia and had moved into the Motion Picture and Television Fund&#x27;s Samuel Goldwyn Center, where she was cared for by family and friends.

==Film, theatre and television==

A frequent guest on talk shows and variety programs of the 1970s and early 1980s – with credits including &quot;The Bobby Darin Show&quot;, &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; and &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; – Reddy helmed the 1973 summer replacement series for &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot; (Reddy had become friends with Flip Wilson when she worked the Chicago club circuit early in her career); the series, &quot;The Helen Reddy Show&quot;, provided early national exposure for Albert Brooks and the Pointer Sisters. She also served as the semiregular host of the late-night variety show &quot;The Midnight Special&quot; in 1975 and 1976.

Reddy&#x27;s film career included a starring role in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot;, introducing the Oscar-nominated song &quot;Candle on the Water&quot; and the role of a nun in &quot;Airport 1975&quot;, singing her own composition &quot;Best Friend&quot;. For her part in &quot;Airport 1975&quot;, Reddy was nominated for a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer – Female. Reddy was one of many musical stars featured in the all-star chorale in the film &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1978). She later played cameo roles in the films &quot;Disorderlies&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Perfect Host&quot; (2010).

Despite her late 1970s decline on the music charts, Reddy still had sufficient star power in 1979 to host &quot;The Helen Reddy Special&quot;, broadcast that May on ABC-TV, of which Jeff Wald was the producer. In September 1981, Reddy announced she would be shooting the pilot for her own TV sitcom, in which she would play a single mother working as a lounge singer in Lake Tahoe, but the project was abandoned. She was an occasional television guest star as an actress, appearing on the television programs &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; (as herself), &quot;&quot; and &quot;BeastMaster&quot;.

In the mid-1980s, Reddy embarked on a new career in the theatre. She mostly worked in musicals, including &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, &quot;Call Me Madam&quot;, &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; and – both on Broadway and the West End – &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;. She also appeared in four productions of the one-woman show &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot;.

Reddy&#x27;s notable stage roles included:

* &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot; – as Shirley, which she performed in numerous venues across the US in 1997.
* &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; – as Mrs Johnstone – Broadway (1995), West End and Liverpool.
* &quot;Love, Julie&quot; – as Gail Sinclair.
* &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; – as Edwin Drood/Miss Alice Nutting – Sacramento Music Circus.
* &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; – as Mrs Sally Adams – Sacramento Music Circus (August 1986).
* &quot;Anything Goes&quot; – as Reno Sweeney
** Long Beach Civic Light Opera (July 1987).
** Sacramento Music Circus (July 1985).
* &quot;Senior Entourage&quot; – as Helen – (May 2021).

In 2007, Reddy had a voice cameo as herself in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; television show&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; parody, &quot;Blue Harvest&quot;. In 2011, she guest-starred on &quot;Family Guy&quot; again, singing the opening theme song for the show&#x27;s fictional Channel 5 News telecast.

==Personal life==
===Political service, citizenship===
Reddy became a naturalised American citizen in 1974, saying after the ceremony, &quot;I feel like I&#x27;d like to have a cup of tea and a good cry.&quot; She resumed her Australian citizenship subsequently, when the opportunity to maintain dual American–Australian citizenship became available.

Reddy was active in community affairs:
* In the 1970s, she helped raise millions of dollars for Democratic political candidates.
* In July 1977, Californian governor Jerry Brown appointed Reddy to the nine-member commission overseeing the California Department of Parks and Recreation. Her nomination was unanimously approved. She served on the commission until 1980.

===Family===

Three of Reddy&#x27;s forebears left Ireland and went to Canada, Australia and New Zealand. A distant cousin, former New Zealand governor-general Patsy Reddy, is descended from their mutual New Zealand forebear.

Reddy was an enthusiastic genealogist; she researched her family&#x27;s history extensively and founded the Tasmanian Genealogical Society. &quot;Genealogy is addictive; it begins as an interest, becomes a hobby, then a passion, and finally an obsession. Not only with each generation uncovered does the number of people to investigate double, but so too does the desire to understand the forces that shaped them,&quot; she wrote in her autobiography. She was asked in an interview whether her name had any connection to the Reddy caste from India. Her response was: &quot;I have done some research on my father&#x27;s side; most of my research has been done on my mother&#x27;s side. His father was born in Ireland, but his great-grandfather served with an Irish regiment stationed in India, so it is possible that I have Indian ancestry. But it has not yet been established.&quot;

At age 20, Reddy married Kenneth Claude Weate, an older musician and family friend whom she says she wed to defy her parents, who wished her to follow them into show business. The couple separated not long after the birth of their daughter, Traci.

In 1968, she married Jeff Wald, a native of the Bronx. She converted to Judaism before marrying Wald, with whom she had a son, Jordan, born in 1972.

In a 1975 &quot;People&quot; interview, Reddy admitted that her relationship with then-husband and manager Wald was volatile, with the couple having &quot;huge, healthy fights&quot;, but that she owed her success (she was then the world&#x27;s biggest-selling female vocalist for two consecutive years) to Wald: &quot;He runs it all. Naturally, when the moment of performance comes I have to deliver – but everything else is him. It&#x27;s not my career; it&#x27;s our career.&quot;

By 2 January 1981, Reddy and Wald had separated and he had moved into a Beverly Hills treatment facility to overcome an eight-year cocaine addiction, a US$100,000-per-year habit (US$ in ). Reddy subsequently filed for divorce, yet withdrew her petition the day after filing it, stating: &quot;After 13 years of marriage, a separation of one month is too short to make a decision.&quot; In 1982, after finding evidence of Wald&#x27;s continued substance abuse, Reddy again separated from him and initiated divorce proceedings, which this time went through in January 1983. They agreed to shared custody of their son Jordan, but later became embroiled in a court battle after both filed for sole custody. Her son later changed his surname to Sommers and became her assistant.

In June 1983, she married Milton Ruth, a drummer in her band; the couple divorced in 1995.

===Death===
Reddy died at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital in Los Angeles on 29 September 2020, at the age of 78. She suffered from Addison&#x27;s disease and dementia in her later years. No cause of death was given.

Reddy&#x27;s second husband and former manager, Jeff Wald, died on November 12, 2021, at the age of 77.

==Portrayals==
A biographical film about Reddy titled &quot;I Am Woman&quot; was released in 2019, in which Reddy is played by Tilda Cobham-Hervey.

<doc id="505673" wikidata="Q548823" url="?curid=505673" title="Denis Villeneuve">
<text>Denis Villeneuve (; ; born October 3, 1967) is a Canadian filmmaker. He has received seven Canadian Screen Awards as well as nominations for four Academy Awards, five BAFTA Awards, and two Golden Globe Awards. Villeneuve&#x27;s films have grossed more than $1.8 billion worldwide.

Villeneuve began his career in Quebec cinema, directing four French-language dramas: &quot;August 32nd on Earth&quot; (1998); &quot;Maelström&quot; (2000); &quot;Polytechnique&quot; (2009), a dramatization of the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre; and &quot;Incendies&quot; (2010). The last of these gained him international prominence and earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film. He subsequently expanded into English-language films, directing the thrillers &quot;Prisoners&quot; (2013), &quot;Enemy&quot; (2013), and &quot;Sicario&quot; (2015).

Villeneuve has since gained wider recognition for directing science fiction films. His work on &quot;Arrival&quot; (2016) earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director. This was followed by &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; (2017), which was critically lauded but financially unsuccessful. His next projects were &quot;Dune&quot; (2021) and &quot;&quot; (2024), a two-part adaptation of Frank Herbert&#x27;s novel of the same name. Both films were critically and commercially successful, earning him two nominations for the Academy Award for Best Picture in addition to a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay for &quot;Dune&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Villeneuve was born on October 3, 1967, in the village of Gentilly in Bécancour, Quebec, to Nicole Demers, a homemaker, and Jean Villeneuve, a notary. He is the eldest of four siblings. His younger brother, Martin, also became a filmmaker.

Villeneuve attended the Séminaire Saint-Joseph de Trois-Rivières and later studied science at the Cégep de Trois-Rivières. He studied cinema at the Université du Québec à Montréal. After becoming established as a filmmaker, Villeneuve received an honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts from Concordia University in Montreal on June 6, 2024.

==Career==
=== 1991–2012: Early films and breakthrough ===
Villeneuve began his career making short films and won Radio-Canada&#x27;s youth film competition, &quot;La Course Europe-Asie&quot;, in 1991. &quot;August 32nd on Earth&quot; (1998), Villeneuve&#x27;s feature film directorial debut, premiered in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival. Alexis Martin won the Prix Jutra for Best Actor. The film was selected as the Canadian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 71st Academy Awards, but was not nominated.

His second film, &quot;Maelström&quot; (2000), attracted further attention and screened at festivals worldwide, ultimately winning eight Jutra Awards and the award for Best Canadian Film from the Toronto International Film Festival. He followed that up with the controversial, but critically acclaimed black and white film &quot;Polytechnique&quot; (2009) about the shootings that occurred at the University of Montreal in 1989. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and received numerous honours, including nine Genie Awards, becoming Villeneuve&#x27;s first film to win the Genie (now known as a Canadian Screen Award) for Best Motion Picture.

Villeneuve&#x27;s fourth film &quot;Incendies&quot; (2010) garnered critical acclaim when it premiered at the Venice and Toronto International Film Festivals in 2010. &quot;Incendies&quot; was subsequently chosen to represent Canada at the 83rd Academy Awards in the category of Best Foreign Language Film and was eventually nominated for the award, though it did not win. The film went on to win eight awards at the 31st Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture, Best Direction, Best Actress (Lubna Azabal), Best Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Editing, Overall Sound, and Sound Editing. &quot;Incendies&quot; was chosen by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of the top 10 best films of that year. In January 2011, he was selected by &quot;Variety&quot; as one of the top ten filmmakers to watch. Also in 2011, Villeneuve won the National Arts Centre Award.

=== 2013–2016: Established work and acclaim ===

Villeneuve followed &quot;Incendies&quot; with the crime thriller film &quot;Prisoners&quot; (2013), starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. The film screened at festivals across the globe, won several awards, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography in 2014. Following &quot;Incendies&quot; and &quot;Prisoners&quot;, Villeneuve won Best Director for his sixth film, the psychological thriller &quot;Enemy&quot; (2014), at the 2nd Canadian Screen Awards. The film was awarded the $100,000 cash prize for best Canadian film of the year by the Toronto Film Critics Association in 2015.Later that year, Villeneuve directed the crime thriller film &quot;Sicario&quot;, scripted by Taylor Sheridan, and starring Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro, Daniel Kaluuya, and Josh Brolin. The film competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, though it did not win. It screened at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2015 and went on to gross nearly $80 million worldwide.

Villeneuve subsequently directed his eighth film, &quot;Arrival&quot; (2016), based on the short story &quot;Story of Your Life&quot; by author Ted Chiang, from an adapted script by Eric Heisserer, with Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner starring. Principal photography began on June 7, 2015, in Montreal, and the film was released in 2016. &quot;Arrival&quot; grossed $203 million worldwide and received critical acclaim, specifically for Adams&#x27;s performance, Villeneuve&#x27;s direction, and the film&#x27;s exploration of communicating with extraterrestrial intelligence. &quot;Arrival&quot; appeared on numerous critics&#x27; best films of the year lists, and was selected by the American Film Institute as one of ten films of the year. It received eight nominations at the 89th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, ultimately winning one award for Best Sound Editing. It was also awarded the Ray Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 2017.

=== 2017–present: Science fiction films ===

In February 2015, it was announced that Villeneuve would direct &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;, the sequel to Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982). Scott served as the film&#x27;s executive producer on behalf of Warner Bros. It was released to critical acclaim on 6 October 2017, but underperformed at the box office. David Ehrlich of &quot;IndieWire&quot; wrote, &quot;Few filmmakers of the 21st century have risen to prominence and prestige with the forcefulness of &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; director Denis Villeneuve, whose seemingly unstoppable career has been bolstered by a steady balance of critical respect and commercial success. In fact, Christopher Nolan is the only other person who comes to mind, and the similarities between the two of them are hard to ignore.&quot;

In December 2016, it was announced Villeneuve would direct &quot;Dune&quot;, a new adaptation of the 1965 novel for Legendary Pictures with Villeneuve, Eric Roth, and Jon Spaihts writing the screenplay. Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Stellan Skarsgård, Jason Momoa, and Zendaya starred in the film. The film was released on 22 October 2021, by Warner Bros. Pictures to critical acclaim. The sequel, &quot;&quot;, was greenlit after the success of the first film and was released on March 1, 2024, to widespread critical acclaim, became his highest-grossing film to date, and one of the top five highest-grossing films of 2024.

Villeneuve was a producer for both films, which producer Mary Parent said as
: &quot;... big and as epic as this film is, there were many times where it almost felt like you were on the set of an independent film&quot;
and that &quot;... he’s very very smart about where to spend money.&quot; He is in the process of writing a third &quot;Dune&quot; film, based on &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;. &quot;Deadline&quot; reported in February 2025 that filming is expected to begin in Summer 2025 with a scheduled release in 2026.

Villeneuve is also attached to direct a historical drama about Cleopatra for Sony Pictures (based on by Stacy Schiff) and an adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke″s science fiction novel &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot; for Alcon Entertainment. He has also confirmed a secret project is in the works, on which he said
: &quot;... one of them is a secret project that I cannot talk about right now, but that needs to see the light of day quite quickly. So it would be a good idea to do something in between projects, before tackling &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; and &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. All these projects are still being written, so we&#x27;ll see where they go, but I have no control over that.&quot;

In April 2024, it was reported that Villeneuve was in talks to potentially reunite with Legendary Pictures on a film adaptation of the Annie Jacobsen non-fiction book &quot;Nuclear War: A Scenario&quot; as a director or producer.

He was the recipient of the Prix Iris Tribute Award at the 26th Quebec Cinema Awards.

==Influences and style==
Starting with &quot;Polytechnique&quot;, Villeneuve became known for a visual style based on long takes, precise mise-en-scène, steady camerawork, periods of wordless silence to emphasize moody atmosphere, and shallow focus, high-contrast cinematography. Amongst a core theme of Villeneuve&#x27;s films are characters who struggle with their identities in worlds of isolation, such as the case with &quot;Sicario&quot; (Kate Macer), &quot;Enemy&quot; (Adam Bell), &quot;Arrival&quot; (Louise Banks), &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; (Officer K), and the &quot;Dune&quot; movies (Paul Atreides).

Villeneuve has cited Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock, the Coen brothers, Paul Thomas Anderson, Ridley Scott, Sam Mendes, Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Ingmar Bergman, Yorgos Lanthimos, and Christopher Nolan as his main cinematic influences.

==Personal life==
Villeneuve is married to Tanya Lapointe, a journalist and filmmaker, and he has three children from a previous relationship. His daughter Salomé Villeneuve is also a filmmaker, whose debut short film &quot;III&quot; premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival. Previously, Villeneuve had a relationship with Macha Grenon.

Villeneuve is an active supporter of the arts in Quebec and Canada, encouraging young filmmakers.

<doc id="505674" wikidata="Q1422880" url="?curid=505674" title="Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music">
<text>Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music is the sixth studio album by the American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins. It was released for free on the Internet on September 5, 2000. Plans for a standard physical release, bundled with the first part &quot;Machina/The Machines of God&quot;, were revealed to happen sometime in 2013, but was postponed due to legal setbacks. In an Instagram Q&amp;A in 2018, the band&#x27;s frontman, Billy Corgan, revealed that all legal issues had been resolved. The two albums are planned to be remastered and released as a deluxe reissue; however, no release date has been announced.

The album itself, a double LP, was packaged with three EPs full of B-sides and alternate versions. The album&#x27;s artwork was created by Carlos Segura. Both &quot;Machina&quot; albums are loose concept albums telling the story of &quot;a rock star gone mad&quot;. &quot;Machina II&quot; was the last Smashing Pumpkins studio album until the band reformed in 2006, their final studio album to feature guitarist James Iha until his return in 2018, as well as the final album to feature their original line-up, as bassist D&#x27;arcy Wretzky departed during the recording of both &quot;Machina&quot; albums and didn&#x27;t return when the band reformed.

==Background==
Near the conclusion of the &quot;Machina&quot; sessions, it was Billy Corgan&#x27;s wish to release a double album of material, but Virgin Records was unwilling to do so following the disappointing sales of &quot;Adore&quot;. After the release and poor sales of the single-disc &quot;Machina/The Machines of God&quot;, Corgan then wanted to release the second &quot;Machina&quot; album separately, but Virgin declined this as well. The band nonetheless returned to the Chicago Recording Company in July 2000 to finish what would become &quot;Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music&quot;, which was subsequently released on Corgan&#x27;s own Constantinople Records label. Only twenty-five vinyl copies were made, and were given mostly to friends of the band in addition to radio station Q101. A few of the 25 copies were shipped to prominent fans in the online community with instructions to rip and redistribute the album on the Internet free of charge. Because of this, all publicly available digital copies of the album are vinyl rips.

==Promotion==
The Pumpkins performed a track from the album (&quot;Cash Car Star&quot;) on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, which also ended up being the band&#x27;s final television appearance until their 2007 revival. A previous live performance of the song, in an earlier and slightly different-than-final-version form, had been broadcast as a portion of Kiss&#x27; 1998 &quot;Psycho Circus&quot; Halloween special, where The Smashing Pumpkins served as the opening act.

==Musical style==
&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; stated that &quot;Machina II&quot; reflects &quot;Corgan&#x27;s obsession with dream-pop, Cure- and Depeche Mode-styled synth-goth, and glam-tinged heavy metal.&quot; The album picks up the thematic elements of &quot;Glass and The Machines of God&quot; started in &quot;Machina/The Machines of God&quot;. Songs like &quot;Glass&#x27; Theme&quot;, &quot;Cash Car Star&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;, and the B-side &quot;Speed Kills&quot; are related to Corgan&#x27;s story. The first three songs (&quot;Glass&#x27; Theme&quot;, &quot;Cash Car Star&quot;, and &quot;Dross&quot;), considerably more intense than much of the Pumpkins&#x27; other releases, are a hearkening to the earlier, famous Smashing Pumpkins sound, blending dream pop with arena rock, while &quot;Let Me Give the World to You&quot; has a melodic, radio-friendly sound. &quot;Real Love&quot;, which would later appear on the band&#x27;s &quot;Rotten Apples&quot;, has a sound reminiscent of My Bloody Valentine. &quot;Home&quot; has been called &quot;simply gorgeous&quot; and compared to U2. The album&#x27;s closing track, &quot;Here&#x27;s to the Atom Bomb&quot;, has been compared favorably to the Pumpkins&#x27; biggest hit, &quot;1979&quot;.

==Reception==
Because it was not released conventionally, few professional reviews of the album were published; however, those that surfaced were generally positive. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called it an &quot;artistic high&quot; for the band. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; opined that while the band sounded &quot;energized and at a creative peak&quot;, &quot;there isn&#x27;t really any new ground broken here, but the band revisits nearly every style they&#x27;ve adopted over the years&quot;, ultimately concluding that listeners should &quot;take this as a proper farewell to the Smashing Pumpkins&quot; and that &quot;it&#x27;s a nice album to remember them by&quot;. AllMusic stated that &quot;As a high-class artifact and a gift to a loyal fan base, &quot;Machina II&quot; is a winner.&quot; The &quot;Michigan Daily&quot; also published a review calling the music &quot;some of the best Pumpkins material to date&quot;.

In April 2010, Billy Corgan commented on the album&#x27;s reception, stating that: &quot;I think the fan response at the time was very positive, as the fans who were around at the time seemed to like &quot;Machina II&quot; better than &quot;Machina I&quot;. That said, &quot;Machina I&quot; is proving now to be the more influential part of the work for many of the younger bands that I&#x27;ve talked to. [...] At the time I saw [releasing the album for free] as a one-time thing. I never thought we would see a near collapse of the music business and its dominant control on how music reaches people.&quot;

==Track listing==


* The two-LP set is the album itself. Corgan has said that the three EPs are &quot;technically the B-sides.&quot; CR-01, CR-02, etc. all refer to their released on Constantinople Records (Constantinople Records-Released 1, etc.). The only other Constantinople release, CR-05, was &quot;Live at Cabaret Metro 10-5-88&quot;, a gift given to fans exiting their farewell concert at the Cabaret Metro. The songs &quot;Let Me Give the World to You&quot;, &quot;Saturnine&quot;, and &quot;Cash Car Star&quot; were originally written and recorded for &quot;Adore&quot;. The original &quot;Let Me Give the World to You&quot; was produced by Rick Rubin, and was later released on the deluxe edition of the 2014 reissue of &quot;Adore&quot;, alongside demos and remixes of &quot;Saturnine&quot; and a remixed version of Cash Car Star.

==Personnel==
* Billy Corgan – vocals, guitars, bass, keyboards, piano
* James Iha – guitars, bass, vocals on &quot;Go&quot;
* D&#x27;Arcy Wretzky – bass guitar
* Jimmy Chamberlin – drums, percussion

==Release sources==

A number of a release sources exist for &quot;Machina II&quot;. All of them are sourced from vinyl (except for the noted commercial releases of select tracks).

Virgin promos
This source is from in-house promo CDs made for internal use at Virgin Records (sourced from the vinyl records), made before &quot;Machina II&quot; was released to the public over the Internet. Two versions of the promos exist, a UK (type I) and U.S. (type II) version, both with four CDs corresponding to the vinyl copies. As it was done in-house at a record company, it is generally assumed to be a high-quality transfer, though some of the faint voices which can be heard in the background before some of the EP songs are cut off, and in general, it is missing a considerable amount of audio between song transitions.

Q101 transfer
As mentioned above, the radio station Q101 received one of the 25 vinyl copies. It was subsequently transferred to two CDs by the station (one CD containing the EP tracks and one containing the LP tracks). The transfer was done by a high-profile radio station (presumably with high-end equipment and professional oversight) and spectral analysis shows the transfer to be of good quality. Copies were given away as prizes from the station. It is worth noting that this transfer is the only one to have been digitally mastered.

SPIFC transfer
The SPIFC transfer was produced from a vinyl copy by a member of the SPIFC. A transfer was eventually performed onto two CDs with &quot;high-end&quot; equipment. The SPIFC offers MP3 downloads of the transfer to members and held a contest giving away CD-R copies. The SPIFC transfer shows a 21 kHz tone which casts some doubt on the quality of the transfer.

MP3 web releases
Following the vinyl release a number of MP3 versions quickly surfaced on the web. A select number of people involved in the Smashing Pumpkins online fan community received one of the 25 releases. Using audio equipment they had immediate access to, these tracks were recorded, encoded to MP3, and quickly released for the masses. Later MP3 releases may be from one of the CD sources listed above or newer lesser known transfers. The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; official site also had the full 25 tracks for download in both mp3 format (at 320 kbit/s) and in RealAudio format. In 2007, the album was once again posted for download on the newly reopened SmashingPumpkins.com.

Commercial releases
Four tracks from &quot;Machina II&quot; have been released commercially. These are of specific note, because these versions were sourced from the master tapes rather than amateur vinyl transfers. &quot;Real Love&quot; was featured on &quot;Rotten Apples&quot;. &quot;Lucky 13&quot; and &quot;Slow Dawn&quot; appeared on &quot;Judas O&quot;, which was included with early copies of &quot;Rotten Apples&quot;. The &quot;Machina II&quot; version of &quot;Try, Try, Try&quot; was one of the B-sides to the &quot;Untitled&quot; single, titled &quot;Try&quot; (Alternate Version). The studio banter that precedes &quot;Try, Try, Try&quot; on &quot;Machina II&quot; has been removed from this version

<doc id="505704" wikidata="Q2535379" url="?curid=505704" title="Zentradi">
<text>The are a fictional alien race of militaristic giants. They are antagonists in the &quot;Macross&quot; franchise and its &quot;Robotech&quot; adaptation.

It is transliterated as &quot;Zentradi&quot;, &quot;Zjentohlauedy&quot;, &quot;Zentrady&quot;, and &quot;Zentraedi&quot; for the Japanese &quot;Macross&quot; series, with the &quot;Zentraedi&quot; spelling being the one most used commonly in the English-dubbed &quot;Robotech&quot; adaptation. The &quot;Robotech&quot; novels and comics added the occasional spelling &quot;T&#x27;sentraeti&quot;. In both the &quot;Macross&quot; and &quot;Robotech&quot; settings, humans and Zentradi are capable of interbreeding. Physically, most of them also resemble humans with pointy ears, though some have unique skin and hair colors. Prior to their first encounter with the human race, all members of the Zentradi race were artificially created through cloning.

==Conception and development==
The idea of extraterrestrial humanoid enemies was first conceived by Shōji Kawamori, inspired by the trend of militaristic alien antagonists from previous science fiction shows like &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; (1974).

After the Studio Nue staff developed the final concept of what would become the Zentradi giant warrior race, artists Kazutaka Miyatake and Kawamori himself were in charge of designing the enemies&#x27; alphabet, machines and ships, while Haruhiko Mikimoto developed the Zentradi uniforms and the different alien characters.

==Appearances==

===In &quot;Macross&quot;===
In the original &quot;Macross&quot; anime the Zentradi were created as a spacefaring race of giant humanoid proxy warriors by the first advanced humanoid civilization in the galaxy, the humanoid Protoculture, 497,500 years ago. They contributed greatly to the expansion of the Protoculture Civilization&#x27;s sphere of influence and the creation of an &quot;Interstellar Republic&quot; (akin to a galactic empire) that controlled most of the Milky Way.

As war broke out with &quot;The Supervision Army&quot; centuries later, the Zentradi entered into combat with their fearsomely powerful force of millions of space warships and mecha produced in thousands of huge automated factories scattered across the galaxy and legions of expendable giant clone troops. After the end of the war with the Supervision Army, the Zentradi fleets travelled the galaxy in search of Supervision Army survivors until they encountered the human race, an event that caused Space War I (2009–2010).

In order to better maintain control of the Zentradi, the Protoculture trained them only in the limited mix of skills which were necessary for the soldier&#x27;s particular role in the Zentradi military. It seems that no Zentradi were trained in the repair and maintenance of their equipment, making them dependent on easily controlled supply stations and factory asteroids. The Zentradi were also segregated so that males and females could not mix, which might lead to love and/or natural procreation. Male Zentradi are also called &quot;Zentran&quot;, which means &quot;male&quot; in the Zentradi language. Also, Female Zentradi are called Meltrandi, the word &quot;Meltran&quot; meaning &quot;female&quot; as well. Finally, the Zentradi were forbidden culture, and were instilled with orders to never interfere with culture-bearing planets and civilizations, again apparently to suppress independent thought and keep an iron loyalty in all the Zentradi forces.

The downfall of the Zentradi nomadic warrior civilization came during Space War I (2009), when the technologically inferior but culturally and spiritually superior &quot;Micronians&quot; (humans) were able to reach the buried emotions of the Zentradi through terrestrial culture and humane actions, especially music and acts of love and kindness.

After 2012, the Zentradi are estimated to have 1000–2000 fleets of sizes similar to the 4.8-million-ship Boddole Zer Main Fleet in Space War I. However, the UN government of allied Humans and Zentradi became the reigning hegemony in near-Earth galactic space.

The average Zentradi are five times the size of Earth Humans, but some of them use ancient miniaturizing cloning technology known as the to coexist with humanity. Many integrated into each other&#x27;s population where many families became a mix of both Human and Zentradi individuals.

Before the Zentradi and modern Humans made contact, the average Zentradi had the equivalent intelligence of Human primary school children, only needing to be intelligent enough to perform their assigned tasks. Since their exposure to Human society and knowledge, their potential intelligence and learning capacity has been shown to be higher.

In the first &quot;Macross&quot; TV series it was revealed that Commander Type Zentradi are bigger, stronger and more intelligent than the rest, while some are even able to survive in the vacuum of space for limited amounts of time. This makes it possible for them to endure hand-to-hand combat against human mecha like the VF-1 Valkyrie.
In the original &quot;Macross&quot; TV series the Zentradi possessed a fictional alien alphabet which was developed by Kazutaka Miyatake of the Studio Nue staff but their dialogue was automatically translated into Japanese language. However, in the &quot;&quot; animated film, the Zentradi were actually shown speaking a fictional extraterrestrial language (that also was developed for the movie by the Studio Nue production staff) as subtitles were provided for the audience.

The Zentradi alphabet from the original &quot;Macross&quot; TV series and the spoken form of the Zentradi language from the &quot;Macross: Do You Remember Love?&quot; film appeared again in the &quot;Macross 7: Encore&quot; OVA and the &quot;Macross Frontier&quot; animated television series. Both the fictional Zentradi language and its alphabet have been used in several video games that take place in the &quot;Macross&quot; universe.

In &quot;Macross 7&quot; (2045), the Zentradi are noted to be especially fearful towards other alien creatures known as the &quot;Protodeviln&quot; to the point of it being a reflex.

During the third Macross TV series, &quot;Macross Frontier&quot; (2059), the Zentradi are shown to live among humans in both macronized (giant) and micronized (human sized) form in the outer space colonies. This includes having Zentradi sized buildings and facilities, including shopping malls with similarly sized products. They also seem to change sizes at will using the cloning technology described before. In the new series, some Zentradi-Human hybrids also share the ability to have their hair move on its own according to their feelings, as well as having an above-average resistance to space vacuum.

====Meltlandi====
In the &quot;Macross&quot; setting, Meltlandi or Meltlan is the term for female Zentradi, a giant humanoid alien warrior race segregated by gender.

In the first &quot;Macross&quot; animated TV series, the female Zentradi collaborated with the male Zentradi in Space War I against the Humans, but the two genders were segregated into separate fleets to prevent direct interaction. The segregated fleets shared the same ship types (with different color schemes), but employed different armor and vehicle complements. Neither the word &quot;Meltlandi&quot; nor any derivative was coined or used in this series.

&quot;Macross: Do You Remember Love?&quot; reimagined the female Zentradi as their own faction fighting against the male Zentradi for millennia. The movie also introduced the term &quot;Meltlan&quot; as the term for &quot;female&quot; in the Zentradi language (a language created for the movie). The corresponding term in the Zentradi language for &quot;male&quot; is &quot;Zentran&quot;. The later series &quot;Macross 7&quot;, incorporated the term &quot;Meltlan&quot; in its dialogue to refer to female Zentradi. The liner notes for the series explained the term was popularized among Humans by a 2031 movie depicting Space War I.

Probably the best known female Zentradi is Milia Fallyna Jenius, the most renowned Zentradi pilot that the humans have encountered. The spelling and pronunciation of these terms is difficult to interpret, as the Japanese language uses a series of characters that split the difference, phonetically, between the English letters &quot;L&quot; and &quot;R&quot;, and thus can be transliterated as either.

===In &quot;Robotech&quot;===

In the American adaptation of the series (Harmony Gold, 1985) the Zentraedi were originally a genetically engineered race of giant clones that served the people of the habitable moon Tirol from their inhospitable mother planet Fantoma. In time, the ruling leaders of Tirol became the Robotech Masters, and the Zentraedi were transformed from miners to soldiers for the Masters&#x27; galactic empire.

The traits and behaviors of the Robotech Zentraedi are substantially the same as those of their Macross counterparts. However, although segregation by gender remains a central premise, the word &quot;Zentraedi&quot; refers equally to males and females in Robotech, with no use of the word &quot;Meltrandi&quot; occurring. Additionally, in Robotech continuity, the near-totality of Zentraedi in existence is found between Dolza&#x27;s Main Fleet of 4.8 million warships destroyed by the SDF-1, the unified forces of Breetai and Azonia that fight alongside the SDF-1, and one additional substantive fleet led by Commander Reno and tasked with protecting the Robotech Factory Satellite. With the defeat of both Dolza and Reno, and enormous losses suffered by the allied forces in the course of their campaigns, very few of a race that once numbered into billions are known to remain alive by the end of Robotech&#x27;s Macross Saga—a significant difference from the Macross continuity, where thousands of fleets on par with Dolza&#x27;s said to exist.

==Reception==
In Anime Classics Zettai! Brian Clamp and Julie Davis describe the Zentradi as &quot;a parody of tendencies in human civilisation&quot; and compare them to the Laputans from Gulliver&#x27;s Travels.

<doc id="505717" wikidata="Q56933" url="?curid=505717" title="Image segmentation">
<text>In digital image processing and computer vision, image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple image segments, also known as image regions or image objects (sets of pixels). The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. Image segmentation is typically used to locate objects and boundaries (lines, curves, etc.) in images. More precisely, image segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics.

The result of image segmentation is a set of segments that collectively cover the entire image, or a set of contours extracted from the image (see edge detection). Each of the pixels in a region are similar with respect to some characteristic or computed property, such as color, intensity, or texture. Adjacent regions are significantly different with respect to the same characteristic(s). When applied to a stack of images, typical in medical imaging, the resulting contours after image segmentation can be used to create 3D reconstructions with the help of geometry reconstruction algorithms like marching cubes.

== Applications ==
Some of the practical applications of image segmentation are:

* Content-based image retrieval
* Machine vision
* Medical imaging, and imaging studies in biomedical research, including volume rendered images from computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, as well as volume electron microscopy techniques such as FIB-SEM.
** Locate tumors and other pathologies 
** Measure tissue volumes
** Diagnosis, study of anatomical structure
** Surgery planning
** Virtual surgery simulation
** Intra-surgery navigation
** Radiotherapy
* Object detection
** Pedestrian detection
** Face detection
** Brake light detection
** Locate objects in satellite images (roads, forests, crops, etc.)
* Recognition Tasks
** Face recognition
** Fingerprint recognition
** Iris recognition
** Prohibited Item at Airport security checkpoints
* Traffic control systems
* Video surveillance
*Video object co-segmentation and action localization

Several general-purpose algorithms and techniques have been developed for image segmentation. To be useful, these techniques must typically be combined with a domain&#x27;s specific knowledge in order to effectively solve the domain&#x27;s segmentation problems.

== Classes of segmentation techniques==
There are two classes of segmentation techniques.
* Classical computer vision approaches
* AI based techniques

== Groups of image segmentation ==

* Semantic segmentation is an approach detecting, for every pixel, the belonging class. For example, in a figure with many people, all the pixels belonging to persons will have the same class id and the pixels in the background will be classified as background.
* Instance segmentation is an approach that identifies, for every pixel, the specific belonging instance of the object. It detects each distinct object of interest in the image. For example, when each person in a figure is segmented as an individual object.
* Panoptic segmentation combines both semantic and instance segmentation. Like semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation is an approach that identifies, for every pixel, the belonging class. Moreover, like in instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation distinguishes different instances of the same class.

== Thresholding ==

The simplest method of image segmentation is called the thresholding method. This method is based on a clip-level (or a threshold value) to turn a gray-scale image into a binary image.

The key of this method is to select the threshold value (or values when multiple-levels are selected). Several popular methods are used in industry including the maximum entropy method, balanced histogram thresholding, Otsu&#x27;s method (maximum variance), and k-means clustering.

Recently, methods have been developed for thresholding computed tomography (CT) images. The key idea is that, unlike Otsu&#x27;s method, the thresholds are derived from the radiographs instead of the (reconstructed) image.

New methods suggested the usage of multi-dimensional fuzzy rule-based non-linear thresholds. In these works decision over each pixel&#x27;s membership to a segment is based on multi-dimensional rules derived from fuzzy logic and evolutionary algorithms based on image lighting environment and application.

== Clustering methods ==
The K-means algorithm is an iterative technique that is used to partition an image into &quot;K&quot; clusters. The basic algorithm is

# Pick &quot;K&quot; cluster centers, either randomly or based on some heuristic method, for example K-means++
# Assign each pixel in the image to the cluster that minimizes the distance between the pixel and the cluster center
# Re-compute the cluster centers by averaging all of the pixels in the cluster
# Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence is attained (i.e. no pixels change clusters)

In this case, distance is the squared or absolute difference between a pixel and a cluster center. The difference is typically based on pixel color, intensity, texture, and location, or a weighted combination of these factors. &quot;K&quot; can be selected manually, randomly, or by a heuristic. This algorithm is guaranteed to converge, but it may not return the optimal solution. The quality of the solution depends on the initial set of clusters and the value of &quot;K&quot;.

The Mean Shift algorithm is a technique that is used to partition an image into an unknown apriori number of clusters. This has the advantage of not having to start with an initial guess of such parameter which makes it a better general solution for more diverse cases.

== Motion and interactive segmentation ==

Motion based segmentation is a technique that relies on motion in the image to perform segmentation.

The idea is simple: look at the differences between a pair of images. Assuming the object of interest is moving, the difference will be exactly that object.

Improving on this idea, Kenney et al. proposed interactive segmentation . They use a robot to poke objects in order to generate the motion signal necessary for motion-based segmentation.

Interactive segmentation follows the interactive perception framework proposed by Dov Katz and Oliver Brock .

Another technique that is based on motion is rigid motion segmentation.

== Compression-based methods ==

Compression based methods postulate that the optimal segmentation is the one that minimizes, over all possible segmentations, the coding length of the data. The connection between these two concepts is that segmentation tries to find patterns in an image and any regularity in the image can be used to compress it. The method describes each segment by its texture and boundary shape. Each of these components is modeled by a probability distribution function and its coding length is computed as follows:

# The boundary encoding leverages the fact that regions in natural images tend to have a smooth contour. This prior is used by Huffman coding to encode the difference chain code of the contours in an image. Thus, the smoother a boundary is, the shorter coding length it attains.
# Texture is encoded by lossy compression in a way similar to minimum description length (MDL) principle, but here the length of the data given the model is approximated by the number of samples times the entropy of the model. The texture in each region is modeled by a multivariate normal distribution whose entropy has a closed form expression. An interesting property of this model is that the estimated entropy bounds the true entropy of the data from above. This is because among all distributions with a given mean and covariance, normal distribution has the largest entropy. Thus, the true coding length cannot be more than what the algorithm tries to minimize.

For any given segmentation of an image, this scheme yields the number of bits required to encode that image based on the given segmentation. Thus, among all possible segmentations of an image, the goal is to find the segmentation which produces the shortest coding length. This can be achieved by a simple agglomerative clustering method. The distortion in the lossy compression determines the coarseness of the segmentation and its optimal value may differ for each image. This parameter can be estimated heuristically from the contrast of textures in an image. For example, when the textures in an image are similar, such as in camouflage images, stronger sensitivity and thus lower quantization is required.

== Histogram-based methods ==

Histogram-based methods are very efficient compared to other image segmentation methods because they typically require only one pass through the pixels. In this technique, a histogram is computed from all of the pixels in the image, and the peaks and valleys in the histogram are used to locate the clusters in the image. Color or intensity can be used as the measure.

A refinement of this technique is to recursively apply the histogram-seeking method to clusters in the image in order to divide them into smaller clusters. This operation is repeated with smaller and smaller clusters until no more clusters are formed.

One disadvantage of the histogram-seeking method is that it may be difficult to identify significant peaks and valleys in the image.

Histogram-based approaches can also be quickly adapted to apply to multiple frames, while maintaining their single pass efficiency. The histogram can be done in multiple fashions when multiple frames are considered. The same approach that is taken with one frame can be applied to multiple, and after the results are merged, peaks and valleys that were previously difficult to identify are more likely to be distinguishable. The histogram can also be applied on a per-pixel basis where the resulting information is used to determine the most frequent color for the pixel location. This approach segments based on active objects and a static environment, resulting in a different type of segmentation useful in video tracking.

== Edge detection ==

Edge detection is a well-developed field on its own within image processing. Region boundaries and edges are closely related,
since there is often a sharp adjustment in intensity at the region boundaries. Edge detection techniques have therefore been used as the base of another segmentation technique.

The edges identified by edge detection are often disconnected. To segment an object from an image however, one needs closed region boundaries. The desired edges are the boundaries between such objects or spatial-taxons.

Spatial-taxons are information granules, consisting of a crisp pixel region, stationed at abstraction levels within a hierarchical nested scene architecture. They are similar to the Gestalt psychological designation of figure-ground, but are extended to include foreground, object groups, objects and salient object parts. Edge detection methods can be applied to the spatial-taxon region, in the same manner they would be applied to a silhouette. This method is particularly useful when the disconnected edge is part of an illusory contour

Segmentation methods can also be applied to edges obtained from edge detectors. Lindeberg and Li developed an integrated method that segments edges into straight and curved edge segments for parts-based object recognition, based on a minimum description length (MDL) criterion that was optimized by a split-and-merge-like method with candidate breakpoints obtained from complementary junction cues to obtain more likely points at which to consider partitions into different segments.

== Isolated Point Detection ==

The detection of isolated points in an image is a fundamental part of image segmentation. This process primarily depends on the second derivative, indicating the use of the Laplacian operator. The Laplacian of a function formula_1 is given by:

:formula_2

The Laplacian operator is employed such that the partial derivatives are derived from a specific equation. The second partial derivative of formula_1 with respect to formula_4 and formula_5 are given by:

:formula_6

:formula_7

These partial derivatives are then used to compute the Laplacian as:

:formula_8

This mathematical expression can be implemented by convolving with an appropriate mask. If we extend this equation to three dimensions (x,y,z), the intensity at each pixel location around a central pixel at (x, y, z) is replaced by their corresponding values. This equation becomes particularly useful when we assume that all pixels have unit spacing along each axis.

A sphere mask has been developed for use with three-dimensional datasets. The sphere mask is designed to use only integer arithmetic during calculations, thereby eliminating the need for floating-point hardware or software.

When applying these concepts to actual images represented as arrays of numbers, we need to consider what happens when we reach an edge or border region. The function formula_9 is defined as:

:formula_10

This above equation is used to determine whether a point in the image is an isolated point based on the response magnitude formula_11 and a threshold value formula_12. If the response magnitude is greater than or equal to the threshold, the function returns 1, indicating the presence of an isolated point; otherwise, it returns 0. This helps in the effective detection and segmentation of isolated points in the image.

== Application of Isolated Point Detection in X-ray Image Processing ==

The detection of isolated points has significant applications in various fields, including X-ray image processing. For instance, an original X-ray image of a turbine blade can be examined pixel-by-pixel to detect porosity in the upper-right quadrant of the blade. The result of applying an edge detector’s response to this X-ray image can be approximated. This demonstrates the segmentation of isolated points in an image with the aid of single-pixel probes.

== Dual clustering method ==

This method is a combination of three characteristics of the image: partition of the image based on histogram analysis is checked by high compactness of the clusters (objects), and high gradients of their borders. For that purpose two spaces have to be introduced: one space is the one-dimensional histogram of brightness &quot;H&quot; = &quot;H&quot;(&quot;B&quot;); the second space is the dual 3-dimensional space of the original image itself &quot;B&quot; = &quot;B&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;). The first space allows to measure how compactly the brightness of the image is distributed by calculating a minimal clustering kmin. Threshold brightness T corresponding to kmin defines the binary (black-and-white) image – bitmap &quot;b&quot; = &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;), where &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = 0, if &quot;B&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) &lt; &quot;T&quot;, and &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = 1, if &quot;B&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) ≥ &quot;T&quot;. The bitmap &quot;b&quot; is an object in dual space. On that bitmap a measure has to be defined reflecting how compact distributed black (or white) pixels are. So, the goal is to find objects with good borders. For all &quot;T&quot; the measure &quot;M&quot;DC = &quot;G&quot;/(&quot;k&quot; × &quot;L&quot;) has to be calculated (where &quot;k&quot; is difference in brightness between the object and the background, &quot;L&quot; is length of all borders, and &quot;G&quot; is mean gradient on the borders). Maximum of MDC defines the segmentation.

== Region-growing methods ==

Region-growing methods rely mainly on the assumption that the neighboring pixels within one region have similar values. The common procedure is to compare one pixel with its neighbors. If a similarity criterion is satisfied, the pixel can be set to belong to the same cluster as one or more of its neighbors. The selection of the similarity criterion is significant and the results are influenced by noise in all instances.

The method of Statistical Region Merging (SRM) starts by building the graph of pixels using 4-connectedness with edges weighted by the absolute value of the intensity difference. Initially each pixel forms a single pixel region. SRM then sorts those edges in a priority queue and decides whether or not to merge the current regions belonging to the edge pixels using a statistical predicate.

One region-growing method is the seeded region growing method. This method takes a set of seeds as input along with the image. The seeds mark each of the objects to be segmented. The regions are iteratively grown by comparison of all unallocated neighboring pixels to the regions. The difference between a pixel&#x27;s intensity value and the region&#x27;s mean, formula_13, is used as a measure of similarity. The pixel with the smallest difference measured in this way is assigned to the respective region. This process continues until all pixels are assigned to a region. Because seeded region growing requires seeds as additional input, the segmentation results are dependent on the choice of seeds, and noise in the image can cause the seeds to be poorly placed.

Another region-growing method is the unseeded region growing method. It is a modified algorithm that does not require explicit seeds. It starts with a single region formula_14—the pixel chosen here does not markedly influence the final segmentation. At each iteration it considers the neighboring pixels in the same way as seeded region growing. It differs from seeded region growing in that if the minimum formula_13 is less than a predefined threshold formula_12 then it is added to the respective region formula_17. If not, then the pixel is considered different from all current regions formula_18 and a new region formula_19 is created with this pixel.

One variant of this technique, proposed by Haralick and Shapiro (1985), is based on pixel intensities. The mean and scatter of the region and the intensity of the candidate pixel are used to compute a test statistic. If the test statistic is sufficiently small, the pixel is added to the region, and the region&#x27;s mean and scatter are recomputed. Otherwise, the pixel is rejected, and is used to form a new region.

A special region-growing method is called formula_20-connected segmentation (see also lambda-connectedness). It is based on pixel intensities and neighborhood-linking paths. A degree of connectivity (connectedness) is calculated based on a path that is formed by pixels. For a certain value of formula_20, two pixels are called formula_20-connected if there is a path linking those two pixels and the connectedness of this path is at least formula_20. formula_20-connectedness is an equivalence relation.

Split-and-merge segmentation is based on a quadtree partition of an image. It is sometimes called quadtree segmentation.

This method starts at the root of the tree that represents the whole image. If it is found non-uniform (not homogeneous), then it is split into four child squares (the splitting process), and so on. If, in contrast, four child squares are homogeneous, they are merged as several connected components (the merging process). The node in the tree is a segmented node. This process continues recursively until no further splits or merges are possible. When a special data structure is involved in the implementation of the algorithm of the method, its time complexity can reach formula_25, an optimal algorithm of the method.

== Partial differential equation-based methods ==
Using a partial differential equation (PDE)-based method and solving the PDE equation by a numerical scheme, one can segment the image. Curve propagation is a popular technique in this category, with numerous applications to object extraction, object tracking, stereo reconstruction, etc. The central idea is to evolve an initial curve towards the lowest potential of a cost function, where its definition reflects the task to be addressed. As for most inverse problems, the minimization of the cost functional is non-trivial and imposes certain smoothness constraints on the solution, which in the present case can be expressed as geometrical constraints on the evolving curve.

=== Parametric methods ===
Lagrangian techniques are based on parameterizing the contour according to some sampling strategy and then evolving each element according to image and internal terms. Such techniques are fast and efficient, however the original &quot;purely parametric&quot; formulation (due to Kass, Witkin and Terzopoulos in 1987 and known as &quot;snakes&quot;), is generally criticized for its limitations regarding the choice of sampling strategy, the internal geometric properties of the curve, topology changes (curve splitting and merging), addressing problems in higher dimensions, etc.. Nowadays, efficient &quot;discretized&quot; formulations have been developed to address these limitations while maintaining high efficiency. In both cases, energy minimization is generally conducted using a steepest-gradient descent, whereby derivatives are computed using, e.g., finite differences.

=== Level-set methods ===
The level-set method was initially proposed to track moving interfaces by Dervieux and Thomasset in 1979 and 1981 and was later reinvented by Osher and Sethian in 1988. This has spread across various imaging domains in the late 1990s. It can be used to efficiently address the problem of curve/surface/etc. propagation in an implicit manner. The central idea is to represent the evolving contour using a signed function whose zero corresponds to the actual contour. Then, according to the motion equation of the contour, one can easily derive a similar flow for the implicit surface that when applied to the zero level will reflect the propagation of the contour. The level-set method affords numerous advantages: it is implicit, is parameter-free, provides a direct way to estimate the geometric properties of the evolving structure, allows for change of topology, and is intrinsic. It can be used to define an optimization framework, as proposed by Zhao, Merriman and Osher in 1996. One can conclude that it is a very convenient framework for addressing numerous applications of computer vision and medical image analysis. Research into various level-set data structures has led to very efficient implementations of this method.

=== Fast marching methods ===
The fast marching method has been used in image segmentation, and this model has been improved (permitting both positive and negative propagation speeds) in an approach called the generalized fast marching method.

== Variational methods ==
The goal of variational methods is to find a segmentation
which is optimal with respect to a specific energy functional. The functionals consist of a data fitting term and a regularizing terms. A classical representative is the Potts model defined for an image formula_26 by
:formula_27
A minimizer formula_28 is a piecewise constant image which has an optimal tradeoff between the squared L2 distance to the given image formula_26 and the total length of its jump set. The jump set of formula_28 defines a segmentation. The relative weight of the energies is tuned by the parameter formula_31. The binary variant of the Potts model, i.e., if the range of formula_32 is restricted to two values, is often called Chan-Vese model. An important generalization is the Mumford-Shah model given by
:formula_33
The functional value is the sum of the total length of the segmentation curve formula_34, the smoothness of the approximation formula_32, and its distance to the original image formula_26. The weight of the smoothness penalty is adjusted by formula_37. The Potts model is often called piecewise constant Mumford-Shah model as it can be seen as the degenerate case formula_38. The optimization problems are known to be NP-hard in general but near-minimizing strategies work well in practice. Classical algorithms are graduated non-convexity and Ambrosio-Tortorelli approximation.

== Graph partitioning methods ==
Graph partitioning methods are an effective tools for image segmentation since they model the impact of pixel neighborhoods on a given cluster of pixels or pixel, under the assumption of homogeneity in images. In these methods, the image is modeled as a weighted, undirected graph. Usually a pixel or a group of pixels are associated with nodes and edge weights define the (dis)similarity between the neighborhood pixels. The graph (image) is then partitioned according to a criterion designed to model &quot;good&quot; clusters. Each partition of the nodes (pixels) output from these algorithms are considered an object segment in the image; see Segmentation-based object categorization. Some popular algorithms of this category are normalized cuts, random walker, minimum cut, isoperimetric partitioning, minimum spanning tree-based segmentation, and segmentation-based object categorization.

=== Markov random fields ===

The application of Markov random fields (MRF) for images was suggested in early 1984 by Geman and Geman. Their strong mathematical foundation and ability to provide a global optimum even when defined on local features proved to be the foundation for novel research in the domain of image analysis, de-noising and segmentation. MRFs are completely characterized by their prior probability distributions, marginal probability distributions, cliques, smoothing constraint as well as criterion for updating values. The criterion for image segmentation using MRFs is restated as finding the labelling scheme which has maximum probability for a given set of features. The broad categories of image segmentation using MRFs are supervised and unsupervised segmentation.

==== Supervised image segmentation using MRF and MAP ====
In terms of image segmentation, the function that MRFs seek to maximize is the probability of identifying a labelling scheme given a particular set of features are detected in the image. This is a restatement of the maximum a posteriori estimation method.

The generic algorithm for image segmentation using MAP is given below:
==== Optimization algorithms ====
Each optimization algorithm is an adaptation of models from a variety of fields and they are set apart by their unique cost functions. The common trait of cost functions is to penalize change in pixel value as well as difference in pixel label when compared to labels of neighboring pixels.

===== Iterated conditional modes/gradient descent =====

The iterated conditional modes (ICM) algorithm tries to reconstruct the ideal labeling scheme by changing the values of each pixel over each iteration and evaluating the energy of the new labeling scheme using the cost function given below,

:formula_39

where is the penalty for change in pixel label and is the penalty for difference in label between
neighboring pixels and chosen pixel. Here formula_40 is neighborhood of pixel i and is the Kronecker delta function. A major issue with ICM is that, similar to gradient descent, it has a tendency to rest over local maxima and thus not obtain a globally optimal labeling scheme.

===== Simulated annealing (SA) =====

Derived as an analogue of annealing in metallurgy, simulated annealing (SA) uses change in pixel label over iterations and estimates the difference in energy of each newly formed graph to the initial data. If the newly formed graph is more profitable, in terms of low energy cost, given by:

: formula_41

:formula_42

the algorithm selects the newly formed graph. Simulated annealing requires the input of temperature schedules which directly affects the speed of convergence of the system, as well as energy threshold for minimization to occur.

===== Alternative algorithms =====

A range of other methods exist for solving simple as well as higher order MRFs. They include Maximization of Posterior Marginal, Multi-scale MAP estimation, Multiple Resolution segmentation and more. Apart from likelihood estimates, graph-cut using maximum flow and other highly constrained graph based methods exist for solving MRFs.

==== Image segmentation using MAP and expectation–maximization ====

The expectation–maximization algorithm is utilized to iteratively estimate the a posterior probabilities and distributions of labeling when no training data is available and no estimate of segmentation model can be formed. A general approach is to use histograms to represent the features of an image and proceed as outlined briefly in this three-step algorithm:

1. A random estimate of the model parameters is utilized.

2. E step: Estimate class statistics based on the random segmentation model defined. Using these, compute the conditional probability of belonging to a label given the feature set is calculated using naive Bayes&#x27; theorem.

:formula_43

Here formula_44, the set of all possible labels.

3. M step: The established relevance of a given feature set to a labeling scheme is now used to compute the a priori estimate of a given label in the second part of the algorithm. Since the actual number of total labels is unknown (from a training data set), a hidden estimate of the number of labels given by the user is utilized in computations.

:formula_45
where formula_46 is the set of all possible features.

==== Disadvantages of MAP and EM based image segmentation ====
# Exact MAP estimates cannot be easily computed.
# Approximate MAP estimates are computationally expensive to calculate.
# Extension to multi-class labeling degrades performance and increases storage required.
# Reliable estimation of parameters for EM is required for global optima to be achieved.
# Based on method of optimization, segmentation may cluster to local minima.

== Watershed transformation ==

The watershed transformation considers the gradient magnitude of an image as a topographic surface. Pixels having the highest gradient magnitude intensities (GMIs) correspond to watershed lines, which represent the region boundaries. Water placed on any pixel enclosed by a common watershed line flows downhill to a common local intensity minimum (LIM). Pixels draining to a common minimum form a catch basin, which represents a segment.

== Model-based segmentation ==

The central assumption of model-based approaches is that the structures of interest have a tendency towards a particular shape. Therefore, one can seek a probabilistic model that characterizes the shape and its variation. When segmenting an image, constraints can be imposed using this model as a prior. Such a task may involve (i) registration of the training examples to a common pose, (ii) probabilistic representation of the variation of the registered samples, and (iii) statistical inference between the model and the image. Other important methods in the literature for model-based segmentation include active shape models and active appearance models.

== Multi-scale segmentation ==

Image segmentations are computed at multiple scales in scale space and sometimes propagated from coarse to fine scales; see scale-space segmentation.

Segmentation criteria can be arbitrarily complex and may take into account global as well as local criteria. A common requirement is that each region must be connected in some sense.

=== One-dimensional hierarchical signal segmentation ===

Witkin&#x27;s seminal work in scale space included the notion that a one-dimensional signal could be unambiguously segmented into regions, with one scale parameter controlling the scale of segmentation.

A key observation is that the zero-crossings of the second derivatives (minima and maxima of the first derivative or slope) of multi-scale-smoothed versions of a signal form a nesting tree, which defines hierarchical relations between segments at different scales. Specifically, slope extrema at coarse scales can be traced back to corresponding features at fine scales. When a slope maximum and slope minimum annihilate each other at a larger scale, the three segments that they separated merge into one segment, thus defining the hierarchy of segments.

=== Image segmentation and primal sketch ===

There have been numerous research works in this area, out of which a few have now reached a state where they can be applied either with interactive manual intervention (usually with application to medical imaging) or fully automatically. The following is a brief overview of some of the main research ideas that current approaches are based upon.

The nesting structure that Witkin described is, however, specific for one-dimensional signals and does not trivially transfer to higher-dimensional images. Nevertheless, this general idea has inspired several other authors to investigate coarse-to-fine schemes for image segmentation. Koenderink proposed to study how iso-intensity contours evolve over scales and this approach was investigated in more detail by Lifshitz and Pizer. Unfortunately, however, the intensity of image features changes over scales, which implies that it is hard to trace coarse-scale image features to finer scales using iso-intensity information.

Lindeberg studied the problem of linking local extrema and saddle points over scales, and proposed an image representation called the scale-space primal sketch which makes explicit the relations between structures at different scales, and also makes explicit which image features are stable over large ranges of scale including locally appropriate scales for those. Bergholm proposed to detect edges at coarse scales in scale-space and then trace them back to finer scales with manual choice of both the coarse detection scale and the fine localization scale.

Gauch and Pizer studied the complementary problem of ridges and valleys at multiple scales and developed a tool for interactive image segmentation based on multi-scale watersheds. The use of multi-scale watershed with application to the gradient map has also been investigated by Olsen and Nielsen and been carried over to clinical use by Dam. Vincken et al. proposed a hyperstack for defining probabilistic relations between image structures at different scales. The use of stable image structures over scales has been furthered by Ahuja and his co-workers into a fully automated system. A fully automatic brain segmentation algorithm based on closely related ideas of multi-scale watersheds has been presented by Undeman and Lindeberg and been extensively tested in brain databases.

These ideas for multi-scale image segmentation by linking image structures over scales have also been picked up by Florack and Kuijper. Bijaoui and Rué associate structures detected in scale-space above a minimum noise threshold into an object tree which spans multiple scales and corresponds to a kind of feature in the original signal. Extracted features are accurately reconstructed using an iterative conjugate gradient matrix method.

== Semi-automatic segmentation ==

In one kind of segmentation, the user outlines the region of interest with the mouse clicks and algorithms are applied so that the path that best fits the edge of the image is shown.

Techniques like SIOX, Livewire, Intelligent Scissors or IT-SNAPS are used in this kind of segmentation. In an alternative kind of semi-automatic segmentation, the algorithms return a spatial-taxon (i.e. foreground, object-group, object or object-part) selected by the user or designated via prior probabilities.

== Trainable segmentation ==
Most of the aforementioned segmentation methods are based only on color information of pixels in the image. Humans use much more knowledge when performing image segmentation, but implementing this knowledge would cost considerable human engineering and computational time, and would require a huge domain knowledge database which does not currently exist. Trainable segmentation methods, such as neural network segmentation, overcome these issues by modeling the domain knowledge from a dataset of labeled pixels.

An image segmentation neural network can process small areas of an image to extract simple features such as edges. Another neural network, or any decision-making mechanism, can then combine these features to label the areas of an image accordingly. A type of network designed this way is the Kohonen map.

Pulse-coupled neural networks (PCNNs) are neural models proposed by modeling a cat&#x27;s visual cortex and developed for high-performance biomimetic image processing. In 1989, Reinhard Eckhorn introduced a neural model to emulate the mechanism of a cat&#x27;s visual cortex. The Eckhorn model provided a simple and effective tool for studying the visual cortex of small mammals, and was soon recognized as having significant application potential in image processing. In 1994, the Eckhorn model was adapted to be an image processing algorithm by John L. Johnson, who termed this algorithm Pulse-Coupled Neural Network. Over the past decade, PCNNs have been utilized for a variety of image processing applications, including: image segmentation, feature generation, face extraction, motion detection, region growing, noise reduction, and so on. A PCNN is a two-dimensional neural network. Each neuron in the network corresponds to one pixel in an input image, receiving its corresponding pixel&#x27;s color information (e.g. intensity) as an external stimulus. Each neuron also connects with its neighboring neurons, receiving local stimuli from them. The external and local stimuli are combined in an internal activation system, which accumulates the stimuli until it exceeds a dynamic threshold, resulting in a pulse output. Through iterative computation, PCNN neurons produce temporal series of pulse outputs. The temporal series of pulse outputs contain information of input images and can be utilized for various image processing applications, such as image segmentation and feature generation. Compared with conventional image processing means, PCNNs have several significant merits, including robustness against noise, independence of geometric variations in input patterns, capability of bridging minor intensity variations in input patterns, etc.

U-Net is a convolutional neural network which takes as input an image and outputs a label for each pixel. U-Net initially was developed to detect cell boundaries in biomedical images. U-Net follows classical autoencoder architecture, as such it contains two sub-structures. The encoder structure follows the traditional stack of convolutional and max pooling layers to increase the receptive field as it goes through the layers. It is used to capture the context in the image. The decoder structure utilizes transposed convolution layers for upsampling so that the end dimensions are close to that of the input image. Skip connections are placed between convolution and transposed convolution layers of the same shape in order to preserve details that would have been lost otherwise.

In addition to pixel-level semantic segmentation tasks which assign a given category to each pixel, modern segmentation applications include instance-level semantic segmentation tasks in which each individual in a given category must be uniquely identified, as well as panoptic segmentation tasks which combines these two tasks to provide a more complete scene segmentation.

== Segmentation of related images and videos==
Related images such as a photo album or a sequence of video frames often contain semantically similar objects and scenes, therefore it is often beneficial to exploit such correlations. The task of simultaneously segmenting scenes from related images or video frames is termed co-segmentation, which is typically used in human action localization. Unlike conventional bounding box-based object detection, human action localization methods provide finer-grained results, typically per-image segmentation masks delineating the human object of interest and its action category (e.g., &quot;Segment-Tube&quot;). Techniques such as dynamic Markov Networks, CNN and LSTM are often employed to exploit the inter-frame correlations.

== Other methods ==

There are many other methods of segmentation like multispectral segmentation or connectivity-based segmentation based on DTI images.

<text>Philadelphia City Hall is the seat of the municipal government of the City of Philadelphia in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. Built in the ornate Second Empire style, City Hall houses the chambers of the Philadelphia City Council and the offices of the Mayor of Philadelphia.

This building is also a courthouse, serving as the seat of the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania. It houses the Civil Trial and Orphans&#x27; Court Divisions of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. It also houses the Philadelphia facilities for the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (which also holds session and accepts filings in Harrisburg and Pittsburgh).

Built using brick, white marble and limestone, Philadelphia City Hall is the world&#x27;s largest free-standing masonry building and was the world&#x27;s tallest habitable building upon its completion in 1894. It was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1976; in 2006, it was also named a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

==History and description==
The building was designed by Scottish-born architect John McArthur Jr. (1823–1890), and Thomas Ustick Walter (1804–1887). in the French Second Empire style of architecture, and was constructed from 1871 to 1901 at a cost of $24 million dollars (late 19th century value of American money). The City Hall&#x27;s tower was completed by 1894, although the interior was not finished until 1901. Designed to be the world&#x27;s tallest building, it was surpassed during the phase of construction by the Washington Monument (of Washington, D.C.), the Eiffel Tower (in Paris, France), and the Mole Antonelliana. The Mole Antonelliana was a few feet taller and was the tallest masonry (i.e. without the use of steel) building in the world until 1953. In that year a storm caused the spire to collapse and so the Philadelphia City Hall then became the tallest masonry building in the world (excluding monuments). Upon completion of its tower in 1894, it became the world&#x27;s tallest habitable building. It was also the first secular building to have this distinction, as all previous world&#x27;s tallest buildings were religious structures, including European cathedrals and—for the previous 3,800 years—the Great Pyramid of Giza; even the Mole Antonelliana was supposed to be a religious building—a synagogue—but then received a different use.

The location chosen was one of the five center city urban park squares dedicated by William Penn, that geometrically is the center to the other four squares within Center City renamed as Penn Square. City Hall is a masonry building whose weight is borne by granite and brick walls up to thick. The principal exterior materials are limestone, granite, and marble. The original design called for virtually no sculpture. The stonemason William Struthers and sculptor Alexander Milne Calder were responsible for the more than 250 sculptures, capturing artists, educators, and engineers who embodied American ideals and contributed to this country&#x27;s genius. The final construction cost was $24 million.

At , including the statue of city founder William Penn atop its tower, City Hall was the tallest habitable building in the world from 1894 to 1908. It remained the tallest in Pennsylvania until it was surpassed in 1932 by the Gulf Tower in Pittsburgh; it is now the 16th tallest. It was the tallest in Philadelphia until 1986 when the construction of One Liberty Place surpassed it, ending the informal gentlemen&#x27;s agreement that had limited the height of buildings in the city to no higher than the Penn statue.

It was constructed over the time span from 1871 to 1901 and includes 700 rooms dedicated for uses of various governmental operations. The building structure used over 88 million bricks and thousands of tons of marble and granite. With almost 700 rooms, City Hall is the largest municipal building in the United States and one of the largest in the world. The building houses three branches of government: the city&#x27;s executive branch (the Mayor&#x27;s Office), its legislature (the Philadelphia City Council), and a substantial portion of the judicial activity in the city (the Civil Division and Orphan&#x27;s Court of the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas for the First Judicial District are housed there, as well as chambers for some criminal judges and some judges of the Philadelphia Municipal Court).

It was the tallest clock tower in the world when it was completed; it was surpassed by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower in 1912, and is currently the 5th tallest building of this type. The tower features a clock face on each side that is in diameter. The clock faces are larger in diameter than those on Big Ben which measure . City Hall&#x27;s clock was designed by Warren Johnson and built in 1898. The 1937 Philadelphia Guide noted that &quot;shortly after the clock was installed the city inaugurated a custom which still continues. Every evening at three minutes of nine the tower lights are turned off, and then turned on again on the hour. This enables those within observation distance, though unable to see the hands, to set their timepieces. There are four bronze eagles, each weighing three tons with wingspans, perched above the tower&#x27;s four clocks.

City Hall&#x27;s observation deck is located directly below the base of the statue, about above street level. Once enclosed with chain-link fencing, the observation deck is now enclosed by glass. It is reached in a 6-person elevator whose glass panels allow visitors to see the interior of the iron superstructure that caps the tower and supports the statuary and clocks. Stairs within the tower are only used for emergency exit. The ornamentation of the tower has been simplified; the huge garlands that festooned the top panels of the tower were removed.

In the 1950s, the city council investigated tearing down City Hall for a new building elsewhere, but abandoned the plan due to the high cost of the demolition.

Beginning in 1992, Philadelphia City Hall underwent a comprehensive exterior restoration, planned and supervised by the Historical Preservation Studio of Vitetta Architects &amp; Engineers, headed by renowned historical preservation architect Hyman Myers. The majority of the restoration was completed by 2007, although some work has continued, including the installation of four new ornamental courtyard gates, based on an original architectural sketch, in December 2015.

The building was voted 21st on the American Institute of Architects&#x27; list of Americans&#x27; 150 favorite U.S. structures in 2007.

==William Penn statue==
The center of municipal government building is topped by a bronze statue weighing of state and city founder William Penn (1644–1718), one of the 250 sculptures created by Alexander Milne Calder (1846–1923), that adorn the building inside and out. The statue was cast at the Tacony Iron Works of Northeast Philadelphia and hoisted to the top of the tower in fourteen sections in 1894, seven years before the building was declared completed in 1901. The William Penn statue is the tallest atop any building in the world. 

Despite its lofty perch, the city has mandated that the statue be cleaned about every decade / ten years to remove corrosion and reduce metal deterioration due to weathering, with the latest cleaning done in May 2017. Penn&#x27;s statue is hollow, and a narrow access tunnel through it from beneath in the stone / masonry and steel framing of the clock tower leads to a hatch atop the hat.

Artist / sculptor Calder wished the statue to face south towards the Delaware River and Bay, so that its face would be lit by the sun most of the day, and the better to reveal the details of his work. But the statue in reality, actually faces to the northeast, towards Penn Treaty Park in the Fishtown section of the city, which commemorates the site where Penn signed a treaty with the local Native American tribe. Pennsbury Manor, Penn&#x27;s country home in Bucks County, is also located to the northeast.

By the terms of a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement that forbade any other structure later built in the city from rising above the hat on the famous William Penn statue, so for decades, the Philadelphia City Hall remained the tallest building in the city until it was surpassed by the skyscraper One Liberty Place in 1986. The abrogation of this municipal agreement in local folklore of the nicknamed Curse of Billy Penn, supposedly brought down a curse onto local professional sports teams. Twice during the 1990s, the statue was partially clothed in a major league sports team&#x27;s uniform when they were in contention for a championship: a Philadelphia Phillies baseball cap in 1993 and a Philadelphia Flyers ice hockey team jersey in 1997—both teams lost however. The supposed curse ended 22 years later when the Philadelphia Phillies professional Major League Baseball team in the National League won the 2008 World Series, a year and four months after a small William Penn statuette had been affixed to the final steel beam of the Comcast Center during its topping out ceremony in June 2007. Another Penn statuette was placed on the topmost beam of the Comcast Technology Center in November 2017, and the Eagles won the Super Bowl a few months later.

== Centre Square ==
City Hall is situated on land that was reserved as a public square upon the city&#x27;s founding in 1682. Originally known as Centre Square—later renamed Penn Square—it was used for public gatherings until the construction of City Hall began in 1871. Centre Square was one of the five original squares of Philadelphia laid out on the city grid by William Penn. The square had been located at the geographic center of Penn&#x27;s city plan, but the Act of Consolidation in 1854 created the much larger and coterminous city and county of Philadelphia. Though no longer at the exact center of the city, the square remains situated in the center of the historic area between the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers; an area which is now called Center City.

Penn had intended that Centre Square be the central focus point where the major public buildings would be located, including those for government, religion, and education, as well as the central marketplace. However, the Delaware riverfront would remain the de facto economic and social heart of the city for more than a century.

== Film appearances ==
City Hall has been a filming location for several motion pictures including &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976), &quot;Blow Out&quot; (1981), &quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983), &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (1993), &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (1995), &quot;National Treasure&quot; (2004), &quot;&quot; (2009), and &quot;Limitless&quot; (2011).

== Notes ==
: The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (an authority on the official height of tall buildings worldwide) provides the following criteria for defining the completion of a building: &quot;topped out structurally and architecturally, fully-clad, and open for business, or at least partially occupiable.&quot; Philadelphia City Hall was occupied by the mayor beginning in 1889 and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania beginning in 1891, and the building was topped out in 1894. City Hall was the tallest &quot;habitable&quot; building in the world until 1908 when surpassed by the Singer Building. City Hall was surpassed during its construction by the Washington Monument and the Eiffel Tower, and is slightly lower by about than the Mole Antonelliana (completed in 1889); however, none of those three structures are considered habitable buildings.

<text>A wolfdog is a canine produced by the mating of a domestic dog (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;) with a gray wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;), eastern wolf (&quot;Canis lycaon&quot;), red wolf (&quot;Canis rufus&quot;), or Ethiopian wolf (&quot;Canis simensis&quot;) to produce a hybrid.

==Admixture==

There are a range of experts who believe that they can tell the difference between a wolf, a dog, and a wolfdog, but they have been proven to be incorrect when providing their evidence before courts of law.

Admixture between domestic dogs and other subspecies of gray wolves are the most common wolfdogs since dogs and gray wolves are considered the same species, are genetically very close and have shared vast portions of their ranges for millennia. Such admixture in the wild have been detected in many populations scattered throughout Europe and North America, usually occurring in areas where wolf populations have declined from human impacts and persecutions.

At the same time, wolfdogs are also often bred in captivity for various purposes. A mixture of dogs and two other North American wolf species have also occurred historically in the wild, although it is often difficult for biologists to discriminate the dog genes in the eastern timber and red wolves from the gray wolf genes also present in these wolf species due to their historical overlaps with North American gray wolves as well as with coyotes, both of which have introgressed into the eastern timber and red wolf gene pools.
At the same time, because many isolated populations of the three wolf species in North America have also mixed with coyotes in the wild,
it has been speculated by some biologists that some of the coywolf hybrids in the northeastern third of the continent may also have both coydogs and wolfdogs in their gene pool.
Hybrids between dogs and Ethiopian wolves discovered in the Ethiopian Highlands likely originated from past interactions between free-roaming feral dogs and Ethiopian wolves living in isolated areas.

Recognized wolfdog breeds by the FCI are the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog and the Saarloos Wolfdog.

==History==
Whole genome sequencing has been used to study gene flow between wild and domestic species. There is evidence of widespread gene-flow from dogs into wolf populations, and very few deliberate crossings of wolves with dogs, such as the Saarloos Wolfdog. However, the global dog population forms a genetic cluster with little evidence for gene flow from wolves into dogs. Ancient DNA shows that dogs from Europe over 5,000 years ago also show little evidence of interbreeding with wild canids.

===Prehistoric wolfdogs===
A 1982 study of canine skulls from Wyoming dating back 10,000 years ago identified some that match the morphology of wolfdogs.
This study was rebutted as not providing convincing evidence four years later.

===Teotihuacan wolfdogs===
In 2010, archeologists found the remains of wolf-dogs in a warrior&#x27;s burial in Mexico&#x27;s central valley that date about two thousand years ago, therefore what was once thought as coyotes depicted in Teotihuacan civilization art are being re-examined.

===New World black wolves===

Genetic research revealed that wolves with black pelts owe their distinctive coloration to a mutation that entered the wolf population through admixture with the domestic dog.
Adolph Murie was among the first wolf biologists to speculate that the wide color variation in wolves was due to interbreeding with dogs;

In 2008, it was discovered that a gene mutation responsible for the protein beta-defensin 3 is responsible for the black coat color in dogs.
The same mutation was responsible for black wolves in North America and the Italian Apennines, with the mutation having arisen in dogs 13,000 to 120,000 years ago, with a preferred date of 47,000 years ago after comparing large sections of wolf, dog, and coyote genomes. Robert K. Wayne, a canine evolutionary biologist, stated that he believed that dogs were the first to have the mutation. He further stated that even if it originally arose in Eurasian wolves, it was passed on to dogs who, soon after their arrival, brought it to the New World and then passed it to wolves and coyotes.
Black wolves with recent dog ancestry tend to retain black pigment longer as they age.

===North American gray wolf-domestic dog admixture===
As of 1999 in the United States, over 100,000 wolfdogs exist.
In first-generation wolfdogs, gray wolves are most often crossed with wolf-like dogs (such as German Shepherd Dogs, Siberian Huskies, and Alaskan Malamutes) for an appearance most appealing to owners desiring an exotic pet.

==Documented breeding==
The first record of wolfdog breeding in Great Britain comes from the year 1766 when what is thought was a male wolf mated with a dog identified in the language of the day as a &quot;Pomeranian&quot;, although it may have differed from the modern Pomeranian breed. The union resulted in a litter of nine pups. Wolfdogs were occasionally purchased by English noblemen, who viewed them as a scientific curiosity. Wolfdogs were popular exhibits in British menageries and zoos.

Six breeds of dog exist that acknowledge a significant amount of recent wolf-dog admixture in their creation. One breed is the &quot;wolamute&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;malawolf&quot;, a cross between an Alaskan Malamute and a timber wolf. Four breeds were the result of intentional crosses with German Shepherd Dogs and have distinguishing characteristics of appearance that may reflect the varying subspecies of wolf that contributed to their foundation stock. Other, more unusual crosses have occurred; recent experiments in Germany were conducted in the crossing of wolves and Poodles. The intent behind creating the breeds has ranged widely from simply the desire for a recognizable companion high-content wolfdog to professional military working dogs.

=== The Saarloos Wolfdog ===
In 1932, Dutch breeder Leendert Saarloos crossed a male German Shepherd dog with a female European wolf. He then bred the female offspring back with the male German Shepherd, creating the Saarloos wolfdog. The breed was created to be a hardy, self-reliant companion and house dog.
The Dutch Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1975. To honor its creator they changed the name to &quot;Saarloos Wolfdog&quot;. In 1981, the breed was recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI).

=== The Czechoslovakian Wolfdog ===

In the 1950s, the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog was also created to work on border patrol in the countries now known as Slovakia and the Czech Republic. It was originally bred from lines of German Shepherds with Carpathian grey wolves. It was officially recognized as a national breed in Czechoslovakia in 1982, and later was recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, the American Kennel Club&#x27;s Foundation Stock Service and the United Kennel Club, and today is used in agility, obedience, search and rescue, police work, therapy work, and herding in Europe and the United States.

=== Volkosob ===
The Volkosob (, plural: ) was initially developed in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union. Russian border guards wanted a dog that would possess the trainability and pack mentality of the German Shepherd, combined with the strength, superior senses and cold-resistance of a wild wolf, able to cope in the harsh conditions of the vast Russian borders. In 2000, a Caspian Steppe Wolf, noted for being unusually friendly and cooperative towards humans, was bred with German Shepherds of an East European Shepherd line, until an F3 generation was standardised. Unlike the previous hybrids, the Volkosob was the only breed that was an effective border guardian as they are renowned for not being too shy.

==Livestock guardian dogs==
A 2014 study found that 20% of wolves and 37% of dogs shared the same mitochondrial haplotypes in Georgia. More than 13% of the studied wolves had detectable dog ancestry and more than 10% of the dogs had detectable wolf ancestry. The results of the study suggest that admixture between wolves and dogs is a common event in the areas where large livestock guardian dogs are held in a traditional way, and that gene flow between dogs and gray wolves was an important force influencing gene pool of dogs for millennia since early domestication events.

==Wolfdogs in the wild==
Hybridization between wolves and dogs typically occurs when the wolf population is under strong hunting pressure and its structure is disrupted due to a high number of free-ranging dogs. Wolves typically display aggressiveness toward dogs, but a wolf can change its behaviour and become playful or submissive when it becomes socially isolated.

Admixture in the wild usually occurs near human habitations where wolf density is low and dogs are common.
However, there were several reported cases of wolfdogs in areas with normal wolf densities in the former Soviet Union.
Wild wolfdogs were occasionally hunted by European aristocracy, and were termed &quot;lycisca&quot; to distinguish them from common wolves.
Noted historic cases (such as the Beast of Gévaudan) of large wolves that were abnormally aggressive toward humans, may be attributable to wolf-dog mating.
In Europe, unintentional mating of dogs and wild wolves have been confirmed in some populations through genetic testing. As the survival of some Continental European wolf packs is severely threatened, scientists fear that the creation of wolfdog populations in the wild is a threat to the continued existence of European wolf populations.
However, extensive admixture between wolf and dog is not supported by morphological evidence, and analyses of mtDNA sequences have revealed that such mating is rare.

In 1997, during the Mexican Wolf Arizona Reintroduction, controversy arose when a captive pack at Carlsbad designated for release was found by Roy McBride to be largely composed of wolf-dogs, who had captured many wolves for the recovery programme in the 1970s. Though staff initially argued that the animals&#x27; odd appearance was due to captivity and diet, it was later decided to euthanise them.

In 2018, a study compared the sequences of 61,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (mutations) taken from across the genome of grey wolves. The study indicated that there exists individual wolves of dog-wolf ancestry in most of the wolf populations of Eurasia, but less so in North America. The admixture has been occurring across different time scales and was not a recent event. Low-level admixture did not reduce the wolf distinctiveness.

In September-November 2018, in the Osogovo mountainous region along the border between Bulgaria and North Macedonia a putative grey wolf was recorded by camera to be living with a pack of 10 feral dogs, and by its behaviour and phenotype was assumed to be a wolf-dog hybrid.

== Breed-specific legislation ==
The wolfdog has been the center of controversy for much of its history, and most breed-specific legislation is either the result of the animal&#x27;s perceived danger or its categorization as protected native wildlife.
The Humane Society of the United States, the RSPCA, Ottawa Humane Society, the Dogs Trust, and the Wolf Specialist Group of the IUCN Species Survival Commission consider wolfdogs to be wild animals and therefore unsuitable as pets, and support an international ban on the private possession, breeding, and sale of wolfdogs.

According to the National Wolfdog Alliance, 40 U.S. states effectively forbid the ownership, breeding, and importation of wolfdogs, while others impose some form of regulation upon ownership.
In Canada, the provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Prince Edward Island prohibit wolfdogs as pets.
Most European nations have either outlawed the animal entirely or put restrictions on ownership.
Wolfdogs were among the breeds banned from the U.S. Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton and elsewhere after a fatal dog attack by a pit bull on a child.

==Description==
The physical characteristics of an animal created by breeding a wolf to a dog are not predictable, similar to that of mixed-breed dogs. In many cases the resulting adult wolfdog may be larger than either of its parents due to the genetic phenomenon of heterosis (commonly known as &quot;hybrid vigor&quot;). Breeding experiments in Germany with poodles and wolves, and later on with the resulting wolfdogs showed unrestricted fertility, mating via free choice and no significant problems of communication (even after a few generations). However, the offspring of poodles with either coyotes and jackals, all showed a decrease in fertility, significant communication problems, and an increase of genetic diseases after three generations of interbreeding between the hybrids. The researchers therefore concluded that domestic dogs and wolves are the same species.

Wolfdogs display a wide variety of appearances, ranging from a resemblance to dogs without wolf blood to animals that are often mistaken for full-blooded wolves. A lengthy study by DEFRA and the RSPCA found several examples of misrepresentation by breeders and indeterminate levels of actual wolf pedigree in many animals sold as wolfdogs. The report noted that uneducated citizens misidentify dogs with wolf-like appearance as wolfdogs. Wolfdogs tend to have somewhat smaller heads than pure wolves, with larger, pointier ears that lack the dense fur commonly seen in those of wolves. Fur markings also tend to be very distinctive and not well blended. Black-colored wolfdogs tend to retain black pigment longer as they age, compared to black wolves.
In some cases, the presence of dewclaws on the hind feet is considered a useful, but not absolute, indicator of dog gene contamination in wild wolves. Dewclaws are the vestigial first toes, which are common on the hind legs of domestic dogs but thought absent from pure wolves, which only have four hind toes.

Observations on wild wolfdogs in the former Soviet Union indicate that in a wild state these may form larger packs than pure wolves, and have greater endurance when chasing prey. High wolf-content wolfdogs typically have longer canine teeth than dogs of comparable size, with some officers in the South African Defence Force commenting that the animals are capable of biting through the toughest padding &quot;like a knife through butter&quot;.

Tests undertaken in the Perm Institute of Interior Forces in Russia demonstrated that high wolf-content wolfdogs took 15–20 seconds to track down a target in training sessions, whereas ordinary police dogs took 3–4 minutes.
The scientific evidence to support the claims by wolfdog researchers is minimal, and more research has been called for.

== Health ==
Wolfdogs are generally said to be naturally healthy animals, and are affected by fewer inherited diseases than most breeds of dog. Wolfdogs are usually healthier than either parent due to heterosis. There is some controversy over the effectiveness of the standard dog/cat rabies vaccine on a wolfdog. The USDA has not to date approved any rabies vaccine for use in wolfdogs, though they do recommend an off-label use of the vaccine.
Wolfdog owners and breeders purport that the lack of official approval is a political move to prevent condoning wolfdog ownership.

==Temperament and behavior==
Wolfdogs are a mixture of genetic traits, which results in less predictable behavior patterns compared to either the wolf or dog. The adult behavior of wolfdog pups also cannot be predicted with comparable certainty to dog pups, even in third-generation pups produced by wolfdog mating with dogs or from the behavior of the parent animals. Thus, though the behavior of a single individual wolfdog may be predictable, the behavior of the type as a whole is not.

Due to the variability inherent to their admixture, whether a wolf–dog cross should be considered more dangerous than a dog depends on behavior specific to the individual alone rather than to wolfdogs as a group.

The view that aggressive characteristics are inherently a part of wolfdog temperament has been contested in recent years by wolfdog breeders and other advocates of wolfdogs as pets.

==In popular culture==

<text>The Charlotte (pronounced &quot;shar-lot&quot;) spiral, also known as the candle stick or fadeout, is a figure skating spiral. The skater bends forward and glides on one leg with the other one lifted into the air. The skater&#x27;s torso is upright, but during the Charlotte, the skater&#x27;s torso is as close to the grounded foot as possible. When performed well, the skater&#x27;s legs are almost in a straight vertical split position. The Charlotte requires great flexibility and balance. 

A Charlotte can be performed either forward or backward. It is usually performed backwards, although some skaters have performed it forwards in competition.

The Charlotte is named for German skater Charlotte Oelschlägel, who first performed the move in the early 1900s. Sonia Henie performed the move in some of her films, as well as her Olympic program in 1936. Michelle Kwan and Sasha Cohen picked up the move several decades later.

The position is rarely performed by men, notable exceptions being John Curry, Rohene Ward, Michael Christian Martinez and a few others.

<doc id="505728" wikidata="Q2977617" url="?curid=505728" title="Claude Jutra">
<text>Claude Jutra (; March 11, 1930 – November 5, 1986) was a Canadian actor, film director, and screenwriter.

The Prix Jutra, and the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television&#x27;s Claude Jutra Award, were named in his honour because of his importance in Quebec cinema history. The awards were renamed in 2016, as were streets named for him, following the publication of allegations that he had sexually abused children during his lifetime.

==Life and career==
Jutra was born and raised in Montreal, Quebec as Claude Jutras. His father, Albert Jutras, was a radiologist and a director of the Collège des médecins du Québec. He made the short films &quot;Dément du lac Jean-Jeunes&quot; and &quot;Perpetual Movement (Mouvement perpétuel)&quot; before graduating from the Université de Montréal with a degree in medicine, but turned to filmmaking instead of medical practice after completing his degree. He studied theatre in Montréal (1952–53) and wrote his first original Quebec television play (&quot;L&#x27;Ecole de la peur&quot;) in 1953, and a television series, &quot;Images en boite&quot;, in 1954.

He went to work at the National Film Board of Canada in 1956 where he trained in all facets of filmmaking, although his first film for the NFB, &quot;Trio-Brio&quot;, was permanently lost when the organization moved its head office from Ottawa to Montreal. As a filmmaker, he dropped the s from his surname, a common Québécois surname, because the Jutra spelling was more distinctive. In 1958 he went to France and Africa to work with noted French filmmaker, Jean Rouch.

Claude Jutra&#x27;s career in film, in a certain sense, paralleled Quebec cinema itself. Beginning as an amateur at a time when there was no Quebec cinema, he participated in (and sometime led) several of the principal developments in Quebec: traditional documentaries and docudramas at the NFB; the germinal period of direct cinema; the first steps in the early 1960s toward independent film production; and later trend toward large-budget features, such as &quot;Kamouraska&quot;, a box office failure now revealed to be a major work in the canon of Canadian cinema. Overall, his work had a consistent thematic pattern: young people and the (often traumatic) passage from innocence to knowledge, a theme that has nostalgic overtones.

With financing and production provided by the NFB, Jutra co-wrote and directed the 1971 film &quot;Mon oncle Antoine&quot;, which until very recently has been ranked as the best Canadian movie ever made. As well as directing several cinema vérité shorts such as &quot;Wrestling&quot; and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Toy (1966 film)&quot;, he also co-directed with Norman McLaren and starred in the innovative pixilation Academy Award-nominated short &quot;A Chairy Tale&quot;.

He was offered the Order of Canada in 1972 but declined because he was a Quebec separatist. In 1984, he was awarded the Prix Albert-Tessier, given to individuals for an outstanding career in Québec cinema.

==Death==
Jutra was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in the early 1980s. He was reported missing on November 5, 1986. His body was found in the St. Lawrence River in April 1987, with a note in his pocket reading &quot;Je m&#x27;appelle Claude Jutra&quot; (&quot;My name is Claude Jutra&quot;); an autopsy later confirmed drowning as his cause of death.

==Controversy==
In 2016, 30 years after Jutra&#x27;s death, journalist Yves Lever wrote in the book &quot;Claude Jutra, biographie&quot; and claimed that Jutra was a pederast. Lever said that &quot;one of Jutra&#x27;s victims was under 14 years old.&quot; He also maintained that Jutra&#x27;s proclivities were known by many people in the industry, &quot;but nobody made a big deal out of it.&quot; Lever&#x27;s allegations were not officially proven, as no victims publicly came forward; however, in the wake of the allegations, Québec Cinéma held an emergency meeting to discuss changing the name of the Prix Jutra.

On February 17, 2016, &quot;La Presse&quot; published an interview with an alleged victim of Jutra, who requested to remain anonymous, relating sexual contact ranging from embrace to oral sex from the time the victim was 6 to 16. On the same day and based on the information in the same article, the Minister of Culture of Quebec Hélène David asked Cinéma Québec to remove the name Jutra from its prizes recognizing cinematic achievements in Quebec, which they did. She also mandated the Commission de toponymie (Quebec Toponymy Commission), a sub-agency of Office québécois de la langue française which reports to the Minister of Culture, to assemble a list of all streets and public places in the province bearing the name Jutra, as the first step in a process of renaming them. On the same day, Montreal mayor Denis Coderre announced that the city would remove Jutra&#x27;s name from streets and parks in its jurisdiction.

Of the controversy, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote: &quot;Few legendary figures have fallen so quickly and so completely. Merely 24 hours after the official publication of the first explosive allegation of child abuse against the Canadian cinematic pioneer, the film industry and governments started scrubbing the name Claude Jutra from every trophy, park and street.&quot;

===As director===
Jutra made his debut as a director with &quot;Le dément du lac Jean-Jeunes&quot; - it explored themes that remained throughout his work, a nostalgia for childhood, madness, and troubled waters.

His collaboration with Michel Brault began at this early period. &quot;Mouvement perpétuel&quot; was influenced by Jean Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;Le Sang d&#x27;un poète&quot;. &quot;L&#x27;École de la peur&quot; (1953) was the first television film made in Quebec. Toward the end of the 1950s, he moved to France, and François Truffaut, who became a friend, asked him to direct &quot;Anna la Bonne&quot; (1959), a Cocteau scenario. In 1960, Jutra returned to Canada.

== Film about Claude Jutra==
Jutra&#x27;s close friend, filmmaker Paule Baillargeon, directed the feature documentary &quot;Claude Jutra: An Unfinished Story&quot; in 2002.

Marie-Josée Saint-Pierre used a mix of archival footage of Jutra with animation to create the 2014 short documentary film &quot;Jutra&quot;.

==Legacy==
George Lucas stated in an interview that he shot the first Star Wars film like a Jutra documentary.

Besides the film awards (Claude Jutra Award and Jutra Award), a number of places bear or bore Jutra&#x27;s name, all found in Quebec:

* Claude-Jutra Crescent, Montreal
* Claude-Jutra Park, Montreal
* Place Claude-Jutra, Repentigny, Quebec
* Claude-Jutra Street, Blainville, Quebec
* Claude-Jutra Street, Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville
* Claude-Jutra Street, Quebec City
* Claude-Jutra Street, Levis, Quebec
* Jutra Street, Candiac

Multiple parks and streets later were renamed or scheduled to be renamed after the pederasty controversy in 2016.

<doc id="505730" wikidata="Q193579" url="?curid=505730" title="Cultural assimilation">
<text>Cultural assimilation is the process in which a minority group or culture comes to resemble a society&#x27;s majority group or assimilates the values, behaviors, and beliefs of another group whether fully or partially.

The different types of cultural assimilation include full assimilation and forced assimilation. Full assimilation is the more prevalent of the two, as it occurs spontaneously. When used as a political ideology, assimilationism refers to governmental policies of deliberately assimilating ethnic groups into the national culture.

During cultural assimilation, minority groups are expected to adapt to the everyday practices of the dominant culture through language and appearance as well as via more significant socioeconomic factors such as absorption into the local cultural and employment communities.

Some types of cultural assimilation resemble acculturation in which a minority group or culture completely assimilates into the dominant culture in which defining characteristics of the minority culture are less obverse or outright disappear; while in other types of cultural assimilation such as cultural integration mostly found in multicultural communities, a minority group within a given society adopts aspects of the dominant culture through either cultural diffusion or for practical reason like adapting to another society&#x27;s social norms while retaining their original culture. A conceptualization describes cultural assimilation as similar to acculturation while another merely considers the former as one of the latter&#x27;s phases. Throughout history there have been different forms of cultural assimilation. Examples of types of acculturation include voluntary and involuntary assimilation.

Assimilation could also involve the so-called additive acculturation wherein, instead of replacing the ancestral culture, an individual expands their existing cultural repertoire.

== Overview ==
Cultural assimilation may involve either a quick or a gradual change depending on the circumstances of the group. Full assimilation occurs when members of a society become indistinguishable from those of the dominant group in society.

Whether a given group should assimilate is often disputed by both members of the group and others in society. Cultural assimilation does not guarantee social alikeness. Geographical and other natural barriers between cultures, even if created by the predominant culture, may be culturally different. Cultural assimilation can happen either spontaneously or forcibly, the latter when more dominant cultures use various means aimed at forced assimilation.

Various types of assimilation, including forced cultural assimilation, are particularly relevant regarding Indigenous groups during colonialism taking place between the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. This type of assimilation included religious conversion, separation of families, changes of gender roles, division of property among foreign power, elimination of local economies, and lack of sustainable food supply. Whether via colonialism or within one nation, methods of forced assimilation are often unsustainable, leading to revolts and collapses of power to maintain control over cultural norms. Often, cultures that are forced into different cultural practices through forced cultural assimilation revert to their native practices and religions that differ from the forced cultural values of other dominant powers. In addition throughout history, voluntary assimilation is often in response to pressure from a more predominant culture, and conformity is a solution for people to remain in safety. An example of voluntary cultural assimilation would be during the Spanish Inquisition, when Jews and Muslims accepted the Roman Catholic Church as their religion, but meanwhile, many people still privately practised their traditional religions. That type of assimilation is used to convince a dominant power that a culture has peacefully assimilated yet often voluntary assimilation does not mean the group fully conforms to the accepted cultural beliefs.

The term &quot;assimilation&quot; is often used about not only indigenous groups but also immigrants settled in a new land. A new culture and new attitudes toward the original culture are obtained through contact and communication. Assimilation assumes that a relatively-tenuous culture gets to be united into one unified culture. That process happens through contact and accommodation between each culture. The current definition of assimilation is usually used to refer to immigrants, but in multiculturalism, cultural assimilation can happen all over the world and within varying social contexts and is not limited to specific areas.

== Immigrant assimilation ==
Social scientists rely on four primary benchmarks to assess immigrant assimilation: socioeconomic status, geographic distribution, second language attainment, and intermarriage. William A.V. Clark defines immigrant assimilation in the United States as &quot;a way of understanding the social dynamics of American society and that it is the process that occurs spontaneously and often unintended in the course of interaction between majority and minority groups.&quot;

Studies have also noted the positive effects of immigrant assimilation. A study by Bleakley and Chin (2010) found that people who arrived in the US at or before the age of nine from non-English speaking countries tend to speak English at a similar level as those from English speaking countries. Conversely, those who arrived after nine from non–English speaking countries have much lower speaking proficiency and this increases linearly with age at arrival. The study also noted sociocultural impacts such as those with better English skills are less likely to be currently married, more likely to divorce, have fewer children, and have spouses closer to their age. Learning to speak English well is estimated to improve income by over 33 percent. A 2014 study done by Verkuyten found that immigrant children who adapt through integration or assimilation are received more positively by their peers than those who adapt through marginalization or separation.

== Perspective of dominant culture ==

There has been little to no existing research or evidence that demonstrates whether and how immigrant&#x27;s mobility gains—assimilating to a dominant country such as language ability, socioeconomic status etc.— causes changes in the perception of those who were born in the dominant country. This essential type of research provides information on how immigrants are accepted into dominant countries. In an article by Ariela Schachter, titled &quot;From &quot;different&quot; to &quot;similar&quot;: an experimental approach to understanding assimilation&quot;, a survey was taken of white American citizens to view their perception of immigrants who now resided in the United States. The survey indicated the whites tolerated immigrants in their home country. White natives are open to having &quot;structural&quot; relation with the immigrants-origin individuals, for instance, friends and neighbors; however, this was with the exception of black immigrants and natives and undocumented immigrants. However, at the same time, white Americans viewed all non-white Americans, regardless of legal status, as dissimilar.

A similar journal by Jens Hainmueller and Daniel J. Hopkins titled &quot;The Hidden American Immigration Consensus: A Conjoint Analysis of Attitudes toward Immigrants&quot; confirmed similar attitudes towards immigrants. The researchers used an experiment to reach their goal which was to test nine theoretical relevant attributes of hypothetical immigrants. Asking a population-based sample of U.S. citizens to decide between pairs of immigrants applying for admission to the United States, the U.S. citizen would see an application with information for two immigrants including notes about their education status, country, origin, and other attributes. The results showed Americans viewed educated immigrants in high-status jobs favourably, whereas they view the following groups unfavourably: those who lack plans to work, those who entered without authorization, those who are not fluent in English and those of Iraqi descent.

== Adaptation to new country ==
As the number of international students entering the US has increased, so has the number of international students in US colleges and universities. The adaptation of these newcomers is important in cross-cultural research. In the study &quot;Cross-Cultural Adaptation of International College Student in the United States&quot; by Yikang Wang, the goal was to examine how the psychological and socio-cultural adaptation of international college students varied over time. The survey contained a sample of 169 international students attending a coeducational public university. The two subtypes of adaptation: psychological and socio-cultural were examined. Psychological adaptation refers to &quot;feelings of well-being or satisfaction during cross-cultural transitions;&quot; while socio-cultural refers to the ability to fit into the new culture. The results for both graduate and undergraduate students show both satisfaction and socio-cultural skills changed over time. Psychological adaptation had the most significant change for a student who has resided in the US for at least 24 months while socio-cultural adaptation steadily increased over time. It can be concluded that eventually over time, the minority group will shed some of their culture&#x27;s characteristic when in a new country and incorporate new culture qualities. Also, it was confirmed that more time spent in a new country would result in becoming more accustomed to the dominant countries&#x27; characteristics.

Figure 2 demonstrates as the length of time resided in the United States increase—the dominant country, the life satisfaction and socio-cultural skill increase as well—positive correlation.

In turn, research by Caligiuri&#x27;s group, published in 2020, shows that one semester of classroom experiential activities designed to foster international and domestic student social interaction serve to foster international students’ &quot;sense of belonging and social support&quot;.

In a study by Viola Angelini, &quot;Life Satisfaction of Immigrant: Does cultural assimilation matter?&quot;, the theory of assimilation as having benefits for well-being. The goal of this study was to assess the difference between cultural assimilation and the subjective well-being of immigrants. The journal included a study that examined a &quot;direct measure of assimilation with a host culture and immigrants&#x27; subjective well-being.&quot; Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, it was concluded that there was a positive correlation between cultural assimilation and an immigrant&#x27;s life&#x27;s satisfaction/wellbeing even after discarding factors such as employment status, wages, etc. &quot;Life Satisfaction of Immigrant: Does cultural assimilation matter?&quot; also confirms &quot;association with life satisfaction is stronger for established immigrants than for recent ones.&quot; It was found that the more immigrants that identified with the German culture and who spoke the fluent national language—dominant country language, the more they reported to be satisfied with their lives. Life satisfaction rates were higher for those who had assimilated to the dominant country than those who had not assimilated since those who did incorporate the dominant language, religion, psychological aspects, etc.

== Willingness to assimilate and cultural shock ==
In the study &quot;Examination of cultural shock, intercultural sensitivity and willingness to adopt&quot; by Clare D’Souza, the study uses a diary method to analyze the data collected. The study involved students undergoing a study abroad tour. The results show negative intercultural sensitivity is much greater in participants who experience &quot;culture shock.&quot; Those who experience culture shock have emotional expression and responses of hostility, anger, negativity, anxiety frustration, isolation, and regression. Also, for one who has traveled to the country before permanently moving, they would have predetermined beliefs about the culture and their status within the country. The emotional expression for this individual includes excitement, happiness, eagerness, and euphoria.

Another article titled &quot;International Students from Melbourne Describing Their Cross-Cultural Transitions Experiences: Culture Shock, Social Interaction, and Friendship Development&quot; by Nish Belford focuses on cultural shock. Belford interviewed international students to explore their experience after living and studying in Melbourne, Australia. The data collected were narratives from the students that focused on variables such as &quot;cultural similarity, intercultural communication competence, intercultural friendship, and relational identity to influence their experiences.&quot;

=== United States ===
Between 1880 and 1920, the United States took in roughly 24 million immigrants. This increase in immigration can be attributed to many historical changes. The beginning of the 21st century has also marked a massive era of immigration, and sociologists are once again trying to make sense of the impacts that immigration has on society and on the immigrants themselves.

Assimilation had various meanings in American sociology. Henry Pratt Fairchild associates American assimilation with Americanization or the &quot;melting pot&quot; theory. Some scholars also believed that assimilation and acculturation were synonymous. According to a common point of view, assimilation is a &quot;process of interpretation and fusion&quot; from another group or person. That may include memories, behaviors, and sentiments. By sharing their experiences and histories, they blend into the common cultural life. A related theory is structural pluralism proposed by American sociologist Milton Gordon. It describes the American situation wherein despite the cultural assimilation of ethnic groups to mainstream American society, they maintained structural separation. Gordon maintained that there is limited integration of the immigrants into American social institutions such as educational, occupational, political, and social cliques.

During The Colonial Period from 1607 to 1776, individuals immigrated to the British colonies on two very different paths—voluntary and forced migration. Those who migrated to the colonies on their own volition were drawn by the allure of cheap land, high wages, and the freedom of conscience in British North America. On the latter half, the largest population of forced migrants to the colonies was African slaves. Slavery was different from the other forced migrations as, unlike in the case of convicts, there was no possibility of earning freedom, although some slaves were manumitted in the centuries before the American Civil War. The long history of immigration in the established gateways means that the place of immigrants in terms of class, racial, and ethnic hierarchies in the traditional gateways is more structured or established, but on the other hand, the new gateways do not have much immigration history and so the place of immigrants in terms of class, racial, and ethnic hierarchies are less defined, and immigrants may have more influence to define their position. Secondly, the size of the new gateways may influence immigrant assimilation. Having a smaller gateway may influence the level of racial segregation among immigrants and native-born people. Thirdly, the difference in institutional arrangements may influence immigrant assimilation. Traditional gateways, unlike new gateways, have many institutions set up to help immigrants such as legal aid, bureaus, and social organizations. Finally, Waters and Jimenez have only speculated that those differences may influence immigrant assimilation and the way researchers that should assess immigrant assimilation.

Furthermore, the advancement and integration of immigrants into the United States has accounted for 29% of U.S. population growth since 2000. Recent arrival of immigrants to the United States has been examined closely over the last two decades. The results show the driving factors for immigration including citizenship, homeownership, English language proficiency, job status, and earning a better income.

=== Canada ===
Canada&#x27;s multicultural history dates back to the period European colonization from the 16th to 19th centuries, with waves of ethnic European emigration to the region. In the 20th century, Indian, Chinese and Japanese were the largest immigrant groups.

==== 20th century–present: Shift from assimilation to integration ====
Canada remains one of the largest immigrant populations in the world. The 2016 census recorded 7.5 million documented immigrants, representing a fifth of the country&#x27;s total population. Focus has shifted from a rhetoric of cultural assimilation to cultural integration. In contrast to assimilationism, integration aims to preserve the roots of a minority society while still allowing for smooth coexistence with the dominant culture.

== Indigenous assimilation ==
===Australia===
Legislation applying the policy of &quot;protection&quot; over Aboriginal Australians (separating them from white society) was adopted in some states and territories of Australia when they were still colonies, before the federation of Australia: in the Victoria in 1867, Western Australia in 1886, and Queensland in 1897. After federation, New South Wales crafted their policy in 1909, South Australia and the Northern Territory (which was under the control and of South Australia at the time) in 1910–11. Mission stations missions and Government-run Aboriginal reserves were created, and Aboriginal people moved onto them. Legislation restricted their movement, prohibited alcohol use and regulated employment. The policies were reinforced in the first half of the 20th century (when it was realized that Aboriginal people would not die out or be fully absorbed in white society) such as in the provisions of the &quot;Welfare Ordinance 1953&quot;, in which Aboriginal people were made wards of the state. &quot;Part-Aboriginal&quot; (known as half-caste) children were forcibly removed from their parents in order to educate them in European ways; the girls were often trained to be domestic servants. The protectionist policies were discontinued, and assimilationist policies took over. These proposed that &quot;full-blood&quot; Indigenous Australians should be allowed to “die out”, while &quot;half-castes&quot; were encouraged to assimilate into the white community. Indigenous people were regarded as inferior to white people by these policies, and often experienced discrimination in the predominantly white towns after having to move to seek work.

Between 1910 and 1970, several generations of Indigenous children were removed from their parents, and have become known as the Stolen Generations. The policy has done lasting damage to individuals, family and Indigenous culture.

The New Deal for Aborigines announced in 1939 marked the end of official policies based around &quot;biological absorption&quot; or &quot;elimination&quot; of Indigenous peoples, replaced with cultural assimilation as a prerequisite for civil rights. The 1961 Native Welfare Conference in Canberra, Australian federal and state government ministers formulated an official definition of &quot;assimilation&quot; of Indigenous Australians for government contexts. Federal territories minister Paul Hasluck informed the House of Representatives in April 1961 that:
The policy of assimilation means in the view of all Australian governments that all aborigines and part-aborigines are expected eventually to attain the same manner of living as other Australians and to live as members of a single Australian community enjoying the same rights and privileges, accepting the same responsibilities, observing the same customs and influenced by the same beliefs, hopes and loyalties as other Australians. Thus, any special measures taken for aborigines and part-aborigines are regarded as temporary measures not based on colour but intended to meet their need for special care and assistance to protect them from any ill effects of sudden change and to assist them to make the transition from one stage to another in such a way as will be favourable to their future social, economic and political advancement.

=== Brazil ===
In January 2019, the newly elected Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro stripped the Indigenous Affairs Agency FUNAI of the responsibility to identify and demarcate Indigenous lands. He argued that those territories have very tiny isolated populations and proposed to integrate them into the larger Brazilian society. According to the Survival International, &quot;Taking responsibility for Indigenous land demarcation away from FUNAI, the Indian affairs department, and giving it to the Agriculture Ministry is virtually a declaration of open warfare against Brazil’s tribal peoples.&quot;

=== Canada 1800s–1990s: Forced assimilation ===
During the 19th and 20th centuries, and continuing until 1996, when the last Canadian Indian residential school was closed, the Canadian government, aided by Christian Churches, began an assimilationist campaign to forcibly assimilate Indigenous peoples in Canada. The government consolidated power over Indigenous land through treaties and the use of force, eventually isolating most Indigenous peoples to reserves. Marriage practices and spiritual ceremonies were banned, and spiritual leaders were imprisoned. Additionally, the Canadian government instituted an extensive residential school system to assimilate children. Indigenous children were separated from their families and no longer permitted to express their culture at these new schools. They were not allowed to speak their language or practice their own traditions without receiving punishment. There were many cases of violence and sexual abuse committed by the Christian church. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada concluded that this effort amounted to cultural genocide. The schools actively worked to alienate children from their cultural roots. Students were prohibited from speaking their native languages, were regularly abused, and were arranged marriages by the government after their graduation. The explicit goal of the Canadian government, through the Catholic and Anglican churches, was to completely assimilate Indigenous peoples into broader Canadian society and destroy all traces of their native history.

=== Croatia and Transylvania ===
During Croatia’s personal union with Hungary, ethnic Croatians were pressured to abandon their traditional customs in favor of adopting elements of Hungarian culture, such as Catholicism and the Latin alphabet. Because of this, elements of Hungarian culture were considered part of Croatian culture, and can still be seen in modern Croatian culture.

Throughout the Kingdom of Hungary, many citizens, primarily those who belonged to minority groups, were forced to convert to Catholicism. The forced conversion policy was harshest in Croatia and Transylvania, where civilians could be sent to prison for refusing to convert. Romanian cultural anthropologist Ioan Lupaș claims that between 1002, when Transylvania became part of the Kingdom of Hungary, to 1300, approximately 200,000 non-Hungarians living in Transylvania were jailed for resisting Catholic conversion, and about 50,000 of them died in prison.

=== Mexico and Peru===
A major contributor to cultural assimilation in South America began during exploration and colonialism that often is thought by Bartolomé de Las Casas to begin in 1492 when Europeans began to explore the Atlantic in search of &quot;the Indies&quot;, leading to the discovery of the Americas. Europe remained dominant over the Americas&#x27; Indigenous populations as resources such as labor, natural resources i.e. lumber, copper, gold, silver, and agricultural products flooded into Europe, yet these gains were one-sided, as Indigenous groups did not benefit from trade deals with colonial powers. In addition to this, colonial metropoles such as Portugal and Spain required that colonies in South America assimilate to European customs – such as following the Holy Roman Catholic Church, acceptance of Spanish or Portuguese over Indigenous languages and accepting European-style government.

Through forceful assimilationist policies, colonial powers such as Spain used methods of violence to assert cultural dominance over Indigenous populations. One example occurred in 1519 when the Spanish explorer Hernán Cortés reached Tenochtitlán – the original capital of the Aztec Empire in Mexico. After discovering that the Aztecs practiced human sacrifice, Cortés killed high-ranked Aztecs and held Moctezuma II, the Aztec ruler, captive. Shortly after, Cortés began creating alliances to resume power in Tenochtitlán and renamed it Mexico City. Without taking away power through murder and spread of infectious diseases the Spanish conquistadores (relatively small in number) would not have been able to take over Mexico and convert many people to Catholicism and slavery. While Spaniards influenced linguistic and religious cultural assimilation among Indigenous peoples in South America during colonialism, many Indigenous languages such as the Incan language Quechua are still used in places such as Peru to this day by at least 4 million people.

=== New Zealand ===
In the course of the colonization of New Zealand from the late-18th century onwards, assimilation of the indigenous Maori population to the culture of incoming European visitors and settlers at first occurred spontaneously. Genetic assimilation commenced early and continued – the 1961 New Zealand census classified only 62.2% of Māori as &quot;full-blood Maoris&quot;. (Compare Pākehā Māori.) Linguistic assimilation also occurred early and ongoingly: European settler populations adopted and adapted Māori words, while European languages affected Māori vocabulary (and possibly phonology).

In the 19th century colonial governments &quot;de facto&quot; encouraged assimilationist policies; by the late-20th century, policies favored bicultural development. Māori readily and early adopted some aspects of European-borne material culture (metals, muskets, potatoes) relatively rapidly. Imported ideas – such as writing, Christianity, monarchy, sectarianism, everyday European-style clothing, or disapproval of slavery – spread more slowly. Later developments (socialism, anti-colonialist theory, New Age ideas) have proven more internationally mobile. One long-standing view presents Māori communalism as unassimilated with European-style individualism.

<text>Intelligent Whale is an experimental hand-cranked submarine developed for potential use by the United States Navy in the 1860s.

==History==
&quot;Intelligent Whale&quot; was built on the design of Scovel Sturgis Merriam in 1863 by Augustus Price and Cornelius Scranton Bushnell. In 1864 the American Submarine Company was formed, taking over the interests of Bushnell and Price and there followed years of litigation over the ownership of the craft. &quot;Intelligent Whale&quot; was completed and launched in 1866. When title was established by a court the submarine was sold on 29 October 1869 through a contract made by owner Oliver Halstead and Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson to the United States Navy Department, with most of the price to be paid after successful trials. In September 1872 the first trial was held and was unsuccessful, whereupon the department refused further payments and abandoned the project.

&quot;Intelligent Whale&quot; submerged by filling water compartments, and expelled the water by pumps and compressed air. It was estimated that it could stay submerged for about ten hours. Thirteen crewmen could be accommodated, but only six were needed to make her operational. The only known trial, reported by submarine pioneer John Philip Holland, was made by a certain General Sweeney and two others. They submerged the boat in of water and Sweeney, clad in a diver&#x27;s suit, emerged through a hole in the bottom, placed a charge under a scow, and reentered the submarine. The charge was exploded by a lanyard and a friction primer attached to the charge, sinking the scow.

Following the failed trial in 1872, &quot;Intelligent Whale&quot; was put on display at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and remained there until 1968 when she was moved to the Washington Navy Yard where she remained until being relocated to the National Guard Militia Museum of New Jersey in Sea Girt, New Jersey, where she is currently on display.

The U.S. Navy did not accept a submarine for service until the USS &quot;Holland&quot; was commissioned in 1900.

<doc id="505737" wikidata="Q104840559" url="?curid=505737" title="Assimilate">
<text>Assimilate is a 2019 American science fiction horror film directed by John Murlowski and starring Joel Courtney, Andi Matichak, and Calum Worthy also with Mason McNulty and Cam Gigandet. It is a loose and unofficial adaptation of Jack Finney&#x27;s 1954 novel &quot;The Body Snatchers&quot;.

==Plot==

Zach and Randy are two kids who run a YouTube channel dedicated to exploring their town somewhere in Missouri. However, they don&#x27;t get as many views as they expect to, due to the fact that their town has nothing interesting going on. Zach is in love with a girl named Kayla, a lacrosse player over at the local high school, but she only regards him as a friend, she is concerned over soon having to study overseas as it means leaving her younger brother Joey since their parents don&#x27;t have any time for him. During the day, Zach and Randy meet a neighbor, Ms. Bisette, who is concerned about a strange bug moving in an unnatural, synchronized pattern on her apples. They then notice a boy being dragged by his arm by his mother who the boy is screaming (to onlookers) that this woman is not his mother. But he is ignored on the basis he is just acting out.

One night, Zach and Randy hear screaming from Ms. Bisette&#x27;s house, and when they go in, she screams that something bit her. However, the next day Ms. Bisette claims that nothing happened when questioned by Deputy Josh Haywood. Zach and Randy begin to see disturbing events unfold the next day, with the pastor and sheriff acting emotionless. However, Haywood dismisses the claims, telling the two not to cause any more trouble.

Outside, they run into Kayla, who is worried about the erratic behavior of her parents. Their suspicions are confirmed when Zach witnesses a bug running around the attic, with Kayla&#x27;s mom&#x27;s body in a hamper. However, Haywood finds nothing during a search the next day. Around that time, Kayla&#x27;s mom comes, but also displays the same emotionless behavior. With no other choice, Zach, Randy, and Kayla leave, leaving behind Kayla&#x27;s now clearly distressed younger brother Joey, greatly upsetting Kayla. The three go to Zach&#x27;s farmhouse, where they see Zach&#x27;s dad, an amputee, but he oddly gets up from his wheelchair, having been replaced by a copycat. The townspeople surround Zach and Randy and lock them in the farmhouse, putting two ice coolers in front of them. Zach then witnesses his mom being killed and &quot;assimilated&quot; by the bug. Luckily, Zach and Randy escape and with Kayla&#x27;s help, run to Haywood&#x27;s RV. By now, Haywood has begun to believe Zach and Randy, having killed his double. The four plan to radio the National Guard and send someone in, but the townspeople swarm the RV. In the ensuing chaos, Haywood is dragged out of the window and killed, and Randy leads the assimilated away as a distraction while Zach and Kayla run.

Kayla explains that there is a flower shop van that could serve as an escape vehicle. In order to reach it, they display the same emotions as the copies, fooling the doubles. They pass by the burned corpses of the townspeople, and Zach manages to get the keys. However, Kayla witnesses a process in which the kids are coerced by their parents to be bitten and copied. Kayla poses as a copy and finds Joey, but a single tear is seen by a copy and exposes her ruse. Zach is able to grab Kayla, but Joey runs off to a family cabin in the woods (Kayla having instructed him to). In the forest, Zach finds Randy, but it&#x27;s revealed that Randy was killed and replaced with a copycat, and Kayla and Zach are forced to drown the copy. Zach makes a plan to upload another one of his vlogs to YouTube, hoping to tell the world what is happening. However, since both Zach and Kayla were bitten by the bugs earlier, their copies come to kill them. Zach and Kayla fend off their clones by flooding the room with carbon dioxide (distracting them with images on the monitors), suffocating them, and they are able to upload the vlog onto YouTube.

The two run into the woods into the cabin, where they find Joey staring at the TV screen, having escaped with both Kayla and Joey cuddling each other for comfort as they weep over being orphaned. In a reveal through TV displays, Zach and Kayla watch in horror as feeds from Washington, D.C., Beijing, Agra, Paris, London, New York and Tokyo show copies burning the corpses of dead humans and walking in the same emotionless state as previously seen. Zach, Kayla, and Joey realize their town was among the last to be hit by the copies.

The final scene shows the YouTube video comment section, where it&#x27;s revealed that multiple people are still alive in different cities of the world, specifically Boston, Nanjing and Prague. However, the state of the Earth is unknown, with the copies now outnumbering the humans.

<text>Francisco de Ulloa () (died 1540) was a Spanish explorer who explored the west coast of present-day Mexico and the Baja California Peninsula under the commission of Hernán Cortés. Ulloa&#x27;s voyage was among the first to disprove the cartographic misconception of the existence of the Island of California.

==Exploring career==
It is not known whether Ulloa accompanied Cortés on his first expedition to the New Spain. By the account of historian Bernal Díaz del Castillo, he came to Mexico later while transporting letters to Cortés from his wife. According to some early historians, Ulloa was influential in helping subdue the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan by naval power.

In 1539, at the private expense of Cortés, he embarked on an expedition in three small vessels, sailing north from Acapulco to explore the Pacific Coast, and to seek a sea route through the North American continent that supposedly led to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, proving the existence of a northern passage. The expedition left on July 8 sailing northwards along the coast and reaching the Gulf of California six weeks later. Ulloa named it the &quot;Sea of Cortés&quot; in honor of his patron. When one of his ships was lost in a storm Ulloa paused to repair the other two ships, and then resumed his voyage on September 12, eventually reaching the head of the Gulf.

Unable to find the through-continent route, Ulloa turned south and sailed along the eastern coast of the Baja California Peninsula, landing at the Bay of La Paz. After taking on supplies of wood and water Ulloa rounded the tip of the peninsula with great difficulty and sailed northward along the western shore in the Pacific Ocean.

The voyage eventually reached 28 degrees north near the Isla de Cedros. The fierce winds and high seas he encountered eventually stalled his progress. Accounts differ if Ulloa continued northward or if he turned around to return to New Spain. A personal letter to Cortés on April 5 seemed to indicate that he intended to continue northward, at which point his ship was lost. However, no records note the loss of his voyage, and the fact that later maps from the voyage of Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo included detail of this part of the peninsula indicate that Ulloa returned to New Spain and was able to confer with cartographers.

Díaz del Castillo maintains that Ulloa was able to return to port, and was stabbed to death by a soldier from his crew in 1540. However, in 1543, Cortés indicated that he believed Ulloa was alive as part of a legal investigation as to the whereabouts of the daughter of one of his former pilots, stating that &quot;Ulloa had carried her off and could give the information better than he,&quot; casting further doubt on Ulloa&#x27;s ultimate fate.

Although his discoveries showed that Baja California is a peninsula, legends and maps depicting California as an island persisted intermittently into the 18th century, indicating that Ulloa was unable to convince explorers or cartographers of his discovery.

<doc id="505751" wikidata="Q1932718" url="?curid=505751" title="Strait of Anián">
<text>The Strait of Anián was a semi-mythical strait, documented from around 1560, that was believed by early modern cartographers to mark the boundary between North America and Asia and to permit access to a Northwest Passage from the Arctic Ocean to the Pacific. The true strait was discovered in 1728 and became known as the Bering Strait. The Strait of Anián had been generally placed nearby, but sometimes appeared as far south as California.

== History ==
The source of this idea is unknown. The Martin Waldseemüller map of 1506 or 1507 shows America and Asia separated. A 1562 map by Paolo Forlani shows Asia and North America joined north of about the latitude of San Diego. The strait probably took its name from Ania, a Chinese province mentioned in a 1559 edition of Marco Polo&#x27;s book. The name probably first appeared on a map issued by the Italian cartographer Giacomo Gastaldi in 1562. It appeared on maps by Abraham Ortelius (1564), Bolognini Zaltieri (1567) and Gerardus Mercator (1567). The Zaltieri and Gastaldi maps show it narrow and crooked. Gastaldi and Ortelius have an &quot;Ania&quot; or &quot;Anian&quot; on the east side of the strait. A speculative map of 1578 shows Frobisher Strait extending all the way across Canada and ending at the Strait of Anián. Juan de Fuca, a Greek navigator, sailed in a Spanish expedition in 1592 to seek the fabled Strait of Anián. A 1719 map by Herman Moll shows the strait as a probable bay at 50° North, north of the Island of California. The 1726 edition of a map by Johannes van Keulen shows the strait north of the Island of California with the note that &quot;They say that one can come through this strait to Hudson Bay, but this is not proven.&quot;

== Cultural legacy ==
The Strait of Anián can be seen in the map of Brobdingnag featured in Jonathan Swift&#x27;s classic 1726 novel &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. Anián is also mentioned (as &#x27;Anyan&#x27;) in the John Donne poem &quot;Hymn to God, My God, in My Sickness&quot; among other places such as the Pacific Sea, Jerusalem, and Gibraltar.

The Strait of Anián is mentioned in the prologue of James Clavell&#x27;s 1975 novel &quot;Shōgun&quot; as a possible destination for a sailing voyage undertaken by Francis Drake.

<text>Brent Scowcroft (; March 19, 1925August 6, 2020) was a United States Air Force officer who was a two-time United States National Security Advisor, first under U.S. President Gerald Ford and then under George H. W. Bush. He served as Military Assistant to President Richard Nixon and as Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs in the Nixon and Ford administrations. He served as Chairman of the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2005, and advised President Barack Obama on choosing his national security team.

==Early life and education==

Scowcroft was born March 19, 1925, in Ogden, Utah, the son of Lucile (née Ballantyne) and James Scowcroft, a grocer and business owner. He was a descendant of early 19th-century British immigrants from England and Scotland, along with immigrants from Denmark and Norway. He elaborated upon his relationship with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in a 1999 oral history: &quot;I have close personal ties to some of the church leadership. They would not consider me a good Mormon. I don&#x27;t live by all of the rules the Mormons like—I like a glass of wine and a cup of coffee. But yes, I do consider myself a Mormon. It&#x27;s part of a religious and a cultural heritage.&quot;

Scowcroft received his undergraduate degree and commission in the United States Army Air Forces from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in June 1947. With the establishment of an independent United States Air Force in September 1947, his commission transferred to the USAF. Scowcroft subsequently earned an MA (1953) and PhD (1967) in international relations from Columbia University.

==Career==


Having envisioned life as a fighter pilot following World War II, Scowcroft completed his pilot training in October 1948 following his commissioning as an Air Force Second Lieutenant in 1947 and received his Air Force Command Pilot Wings. However, on January 6, 1949, while on flight training with a North American P-51 Mustang, his aircraft experienced engine trouble after taking-off from Grenier Army Airfield, causing the plane to crash-land. Although his injuries were not critical, Scowcroft assumed that he would never fly again and considered another career within the Air Force. He served in a variety of operational and administrative positions from 1948 to 1953. In the course of his military career, he held positions at the Joint Chiefs of Staff, headquarters of the United States Air Force, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. His other assignments included: faculty positions at the United States Air Force Academy and the United States Military Academy, and Assistant Air Attaché in the American Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.

As a senior officer, General Scowcroft was assigned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force in the office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Plans and Operations, and served in the Long Range Planning Division, Directorate of Doctrine, Concepts and Objectives from 1964 to 1966. He next attended the National War College at Fort McNair, followed by assignment in July 1968 to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. In September 1969, he was reassigned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force in the Directorate of Plans as Deputy Assistant for National Security Council Matters. In March 1970 he joined the Joint Chiefs of Staff organization and became the Special Assistant to the Director of the Joint Staff.



Scowcroft was appointed Military Assistant to the President in February 1972; and was reassigned as Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs in January 1973. He was promoted to lieutenant general on August 16, 1974, and retired from active duty at that rank on December 1, 1975. He had, just a month earlier, during the Halloween Massacre, become the United States National Security Advisor (for him, the first time), replacing Henry Kissinger. Scowcroft&#x27;s continued service in the Air Force would have been contingent on reconfirmation of his rank by the Senate, a distinction that National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster elected to pursue in 2018.

His military decorations and awards included the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster and the Air Force Commendation Medal.

On the 24th anniversary of the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident (in 1991), approximately 50 &quot;Liberty&quot; survivors, including Captain William McGonagle, were invited to the White House to meet with President George H.W. Bush in a meeting set up by former Congressmen Paul Findley and Pete McCloskey. After waiting for over 2 hours, President Bush waved at them as he passed by in his limousine, but did not meet with them in person. Many of the survivors were reportedly disheartened and disappointed with this. Instead, Scowcroft and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu greeted them. Rear Admiral Thomas A. Brooks, who had spoken out in favor of &quot;Liberty&quot; survivors previously, presented them with a Presidential Unit Citation that had been signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson but never awarded. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, a longtime &quot;Liberty&quot; advocate, was also in attendance. This meeting was objected to by the Anti-Defamation League.

Before joining the Bush administration, Scowcroft was vice chairman of Kissinger Associates. He had a long association with Henry Kissinger, having served as his assistant when Kissinger was the National Security Adviser under Richard Nixon, from 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOS/Kissinger&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Scowcroft was long sought after as a respected, professional and largely apolitical or nonpartisan expert (within the standards of fellow White House veterans) and chaired and served on a number of policy advisory councils, including the President&#x27;s General Advisory Committee on Arms Control, the President&#x27;s Commission on Strategic Forces, the President&#x27;s Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management, the Defense Policy Board, and the President&#x27;s Special Review Board (Tower Commission) investigating the Iran–Contra affair. He also served on the Guiding Coalition of the nonpartisan Project on National Security Reform. He was appointed Co-Chair of the Blue Ribbon Commission on America&#x27;s Nuclear Future from 2010 to 2012 alongside Lee Hamilton.

On the morning of September 11, 2001, Scowcroft was in an E-4B aircraft, also known as the National Airborne Operations Command Center (NAOC), on the taxiway, waiting to takeoff for Offutt Air Force Base, when the first hijacked airliner hit the World Trade Center (WTC). Scowcroft&#x27;s aircraft was en route to Offutt when the second hijacked airliner struck the WTC. Scowcroft was involved in observing the command and control operations of both President George W. Bush in Florida, and Vice President Dick Cheney, who was at the White House.

Scowcroft was the founder and president of The Forum for International Policy, a think tank. He was also president of The Scowcroft Group, an international business consulting firm. He was co-chair, along with Joseph Nye, of the Aspen Strategy Group. He was a member of the Inter-American Dialogue, Trilateral Commission, and the Council on Foreign Relations and a board member of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Atlantic Council.

Scowcroft was a leading Republican critic of American policy towards Iraq before and after the 2003 invasion, which war critics in particular have seen as significant given Scowcroft&#x27;s close ties to former President George H. W. Bush. He drew attention for reports of remarks critical of Bush – which he did not deny when reported by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; citing his view that &quot;Bush is &#x27;mesmerized&#x27; by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, that Iraq was a &#x27;failing venture&#x27; and that the administration&#x27;s unilateralist approach has harmed relations between Europe and the United States.&quot; Despite his public criticism of the decision to invade, Scowcroft continued to describe himself as &quot;a friend&quot; of the Bush administration. He also strongly opposed a precipitous withdrawal, arguing that a pull-out from Iraq before the country was able to govern, sustain, and defend itself &quot;would be a strategic defeat for American interests, with potentially catastrophic consequences both in the region and beyond&quot;. Scowcroft went on to stress that the U.S. must &quot;secure the support of the countries of the region themselves. It is greatly in their self-interest to give that support.. unfortunately, in recent years they have come to see it as dangerous to identify with the United States, and so they have largely stood on the sidelines.&quot; The New York Times noted that Scowcroft was &quot;a traditionalist, who believed that the nation should work with allies and international organizations, as opposed to a &#x27;transformationalist,&#x27; like the second President Bush, who argued that America should fight terrorism by spreading democracy in the world.&quot; 

He backed the invasion of Afghanistan as a &quot;direct response&quot; to 9/11 terrorism, a war that would go on to last about 20 years.

President George H. W. Bush presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991. In 1993, he was created an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. In 1988, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2005, Scowcroft was awarded the William Oliver Baker Award by the Intelligence and National Security Alliance.

In 1998, he co-wrote &quot;A World Transformed&quot; with George H. W. Bush. This book described what it was like to be in the White House during the end of the Cold War, as the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s. Notably, both figures explained why they didn&#x27;t go on to Baghdad in 1991: &quot;Had we gone the invasion route, the United States could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land.&quot; In 1994, Scowcroft co-authored the opinion-editorial &quot;The Time for Temporizing is Over&quot; urging President Bill Clinton to order a preemptive strike on North Korea&#x27;s Yongbyon nuclear facility unless it readmitted International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors.

His discussions of foreign policy with Zbigniew Brzezinski, led by journalist David Ignatius, were published in a 2008 book titled &quot;America and the World: Conversations on the Future of American Foreign Policy&quot;.

Scowcroft was a member of the Honorary Council of Advisors for U.S.-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce (USACC). Critics have suggested that Scowcroft was unethical in his lobbying for the Turkish and Azeri governments because of his ties to Lockheed Martin and other defense contractors that do significant business with Turkey.
He was also a member of the board of directors of the International Republican Institute, and served on the Advisory Board for Columbia University&#x27;s School of International and Public Affairs and for America Abroad Media.

Scowcroft endorsed Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 United States presidential election.

In 1989, he was sent to Beijing, China following the Tiananmen Square massacre by President George H W Bush for a sensitive China-related mission 

==Evaluation==
Scholarly evaluations of Scowcroft&#x27;s performance have been generally favorable. For example Ivo Daalder and I. M. Destler quoting other scholars, conclude:

&quot;Brent Scowcroft was in many ways the ideal national security adviser—indeed, he offers a model for how the job should be done.&quot; His &quot;winning formula&quot; consisted of gaining the trust of the key principals of U.S. foreign policymaking, establishing &quot;a cooperative policy process at all levels,&quot; one both transparent and collegial, and keeping an &quot;unbreakable relationship with the president,&quot; thanks to their close friendship and mutual respect. The result was that Scowcroft &quot;proved to be an extraordinarily effective national security adviser&quot; in comparison with others who have held the office, particularly in light of the difficult and transformative period in which he held office.Other evaluations from colleagues and national security veterans in both parties echo similar points. 

In a largely laudatory obituary, T&quot;he New York Times&quot; noted &quot;his appeal for public service was a classic reminder of a less partisan age, when presidents often reached out to experienced talent, regardless of party loyalties.&quot;

The Atlantic Council provided an assessment, with quotes from several experts after Scowcroft&#x27;s death, that noted &quot;Looking back on his time working with Scowcroft in the Nixon administration, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger explained that &#x27;in a period when America was tearing itself apart,&#x27; Scowcroft’s &#x27;steadiness had a calming influence then as did his faith in his country’s ultimate purposes.&#x27; Former US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates argued that what &#x27;set Brent apart as National Security Advisor was that he played fair…he did not take advantage of his close relationship with the president to disadvantage others.&#x27; John Deutch, former Director of Central Intelligence, recalled that “Brent had the ideal temperament to lead the country. He was smart, deceptively articulate with a calm demeanor that often masked his strategic thinking.&#x27;&quot;

==Scowcroft award==
Scowcroft was the inspiration and namesake for a special presidential award begun under the George H. W. Bush administration. According to Gates, the award is given to the official &quot;who most ostentatiously falls asleep in a meeting with the president&quot;. According to Gates, the president &quot;evaluated candidates on three criteria. First, duration—how long did they sleep? Second, the depth of the sleep. Snoring always got you extra points. And third, the quality of recovery. Did one just quietly open one&#x27;s eyes and return to the meeting, or did you jolt awake and maybe spill something hot in the process?&quot; According to Bush himself, the award &quot;gives extra points for he/she who totally craters, eyes tightly closed, in the midst of meetings, but in fairness a lot of credit is given for sleeping soundly while all about you are doing their thing.&quot; Scowcroft had gained a reputation for doing such things to the extent that it became a running gag.

==Personal life==
Scowcroft married Marian Horner in 1951. His wife, a Pennsylvania native, was trained as a nurse at St. Francis School of Nursing in Pittsburgh and graduated from Columbia University. They had one daughter, Karen Scowcroft. Marian Horner Scowcroft, a diabetic, died on July 17, 1995, at George Washington University Hospital.

In March 1993, when Scowcroft was given an honorary KBE by Queen Elizabeth II, his daughter was also received by the Queen.

===Death===
On August 6, 2020, Scowcroft died at his home in Falls Church, Virginia, at age 95. On January 29, 2021, Scowcroft was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>Crystal Cruises is an American cruise line. It was founded in 1988 by Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen Kaisha, and sold to Hong Kong-headquartered conglomerate Genting Hong Kong in 2015. Following insolvency in 2022, the Crystal Cruises brand and two cruise ships were bought by A&amp;K Travel Group, to recommence operations in 2023, with headquarters in Hallandale Beach, Florida. The new company has announced major refurbishments and enhancements for the two ships in a Fincantieri shipyard in Trieste, Italy, including increasing the number of butler suites and reducing guest capacity, and resumed service in July 2023 with shore excursions organized by Abercrombie &amp; Kent.

==History==
The company was founded in 1988 by Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK). Its first ship was &quot;Crystal Harmony.&quot;

On March 3, 2015, NYK announced that it was selling Crystal Cruises to Genting Hong Kong. The sale price was US$550 million in cash, subject to certain adjustment items. On May 15, 2015, GHK announced that it had closed on the acquisition.

On July 20, 2015, Crystal announced that it would expand to provide expedition cruises, river cruises, and private jet travel.

On February 4, 2016, Crystal Cruises signed a purchase option for the , also providing funding for docking costs for the ship in Philadelphia for nine months while it conducted a feasibility study into returning the ship to service. However, the plan was dropped on August 5, 2016, citing technical challenges. It also announced a donation of US$350,000 to cover docking costs through to the end of the year.

In September 2019, Crystal Cruises announced that it would have Broadway-themed cruises available starting in 2020.

In August 2020, Crystal cancelled all cruises for the remainder of the year. Its parent company Genting Hong Kong had suspended payments to creditors citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The new 200-passenger &quot;Crystal Endeavor&quot; was under construction at the time, with delivery scheduled for November 2020; that was delayed for a year because of the suspension of operations at the MV Werften shipyard in Germany. 

In March 2021, Crystal announced all-Bahamas cruises aboard &quot;Crystal Serenity&quot; would start on July 3, 2021, with departures from Nassau and Bimini to work around CDC cruise bans due to COVID-19 in the US. Ports of call within the Bahamas included Harbour Island, Great Exuma, Long Island, and San Salvador. All passengers were required to be vaccinated for COVID-19. The opening booking day set a record for the most bookings on a single day in the company&#x27;s history. Some destinations expressed concerns with the company&#x27;s announcement, lack of consultation with local stakeholders, and negative impact to their existing tourism economy.

Following the insolvency of Genting Hong Kong, Crystal suspended operations of all its cruise ships in January 2022. &quot;Crystal Symphony&quot; and &quot;Crystal Serenity&quot; were subsequently arrested in Freeport, Bahamas over unpaid bills in February, and the company&#x27;s headquarters in the United States closed. Meanwhile, V.Ships Leisure was appointed by the liquidators to manage Crystal&#x27;s ships.

On June 22, 2022, it was announced that A&amp;K Travel Group, owned by Manfredi Lefebvre d&#x27;Ovidio and Geoffrey Kent had bought the bankrupt line&#x27;s brand and two ocean vessels, &quot;Crystal Serenity&quot; and &quot;Crystal Symphony&quot;, intending to return the ships to service in 2023.
